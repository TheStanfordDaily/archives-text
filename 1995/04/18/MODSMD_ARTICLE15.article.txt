# China denies US nuclear plea

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - China
rejected Secretary of State War
ren Christopher's personal
appeal yesterday to abandon a
proposed nuclear deal with Iran.
Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen said international law
allows "cooperation in the
peaceful use of nuclear energy."
Christopher, in a two-hour
meeting with Qian over lunch,
implored the foreign minister to
drop the proposed sale of two
pressurized water reactors to
Iran, telling him it would be
"too dangerous."
But Qian rebuffed Christo
pher, agreeing only to have U.S.
and Chinese experts meet next
summer for further discussions.
"There is no international
law or international regulation
or international agreement that
prohibits such cooperation in
the peaceful use of nuclear ener
gy," Qian said.
Besides, Qian said at a joint
news conference with Christo
pher, the project would be under
the supervision of the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency,
an outside monitoring panel

provided by the nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty.
Christopher voiced his plea to
Qian even as some 175 nations
opened a month-long conference
at the United Nations on
extending the 25-year-old nucle
ar Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The Clinton administration
would like to gain China's sup
port for indefinite extension of
the treaty. Qian is expected to
disclose his government's posi
tion in a speech today and U.S.
officials are hinting Beijing may
go along with the United States.
Despite differences with
China over its detention of dissi
dents and limits on Red Cross
access to them, U.S. relations
with China have improved since
President Clinton last May
ceased conditioning the kind of
tariffs imposed on exports to the
United States to China's human
rights record.
But on the projected deal
with Iran, Qian refused to
budge.
"We respect the view of the
United States," Qian said. "But
what we have done is consistent

with international practice."
American intelligence esti
mates of Iran's capability of fab
ricating nuclear fuel from the
two pressurized water reactors
China intends to provide were
turned over to Chinese nuclear
experts last week, U.S. officials
said.
Administration officials are
skeptical that Iran's aim is to
develop nuclear pov/er for civil
ian purposes.
Its agents have been trying to
buy technology that "does not
match up with a civilian pro
gram," said a senior U.S. offi
cial, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
On the other hand, over
lunch, Qian reaffirmed China's
support for U.S. efforts to stop a
North Korean program that
U.S. officials consider far more
advanced than Iran's.
A 5-megawatt reactor capable
of turning out an estimated
nuclear bomb's worth of pluto
nium a year has been frozen but
North Korea still refuses to
accept South Korean light
water reactors as substitutes.
