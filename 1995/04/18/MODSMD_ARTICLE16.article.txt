(JM settlement rejected
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal appeals court yes
terday threw out a settlement under which owners of
allegedly fire-prone General Motors Corp. pickups would
have gotten $1,000 coupons toward new GM trucks.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with
opponents who branded the 1993 settlement merely a
"sophisticated marketing program" to sell more GM
trucks.
The court also said the $1,000 coupon would be worth
less to rental companies and "less wealthy" truck owners
unable to purchase new GM trucks.
Loud worshipers won't stop
GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) — Two women banned from
two churches for praying too loudly told the bishop yester

day they have been acting on messages from"the heav
ens" and won't turn down the volume.
On Friday, the women told a detective that "they
had a sign from God, that he gave them some inspira
tion that they had to pray in public to save people," he
said.
Joan Sudwoj, 43, and Cynthia Balconi, 60, prayed
quietly during Easter weekend services at Visitation
Roman Catholic Church in Mount Pleasant, about 20
miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
Last week, they were arrested as they tried to attend
Good Friday services at Blessed Sacrament Cathedral
in defiance of a court order.
"I suggested to them that if they do appear in court
that they should have an attorney or a public defend
er," said Bishop Anthony Bosco. "They told me that
Jesus will defend them."
