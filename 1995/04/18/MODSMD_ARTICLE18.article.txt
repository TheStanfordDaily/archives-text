## ENDORSEMENTS We deserve 'Candid' 
### 
Students' Alliance slate
is not ideal but at least
has realistic proposals

DON'T PROMISE WHAT you
can't deliver. It's a sound les
son for all of us. But only one
of the major slates running for
Council of Presidents appears to
have learned it. The Students'
Alliance slate "Let's Be Candid" has
made promises it can accomplish,
and is the team most likely to make
its campaign promises a reality.
Not to say that Let's Be Candid is
the ideal slate. Its members seem to
lack important understanding of the
inner workings of the ASSU and of
the University's old-boy administra
tive network. Frankly, none of the
three slates knocked our socks off.
But, in a weaker-than-desirable
field, Let's Be Candid edges out its
closest competitor, the People's Plat
form slate "We Deserve Better."
Still, it is a refreshing change to
hear about several important, tangi
ble projects — including a resurrect
ed ASSU course guide, a graduate
student guidebook, office hours in
the Co Ho and continued support of
the right to fee refunds through the
Students' Rights Initiative — rather
than the five-year-old myth of an
impending Taco Bell in Tresidder or
vague discussions of graduate stu
dent "empowerment."
The members of Let's Be Candid
bring a diversity of valuable experi
ences. Junior Rachel Hall worked
with the California Post-secondary
Education Commission and man
aged the production of a course guide
at UC-Davis before transferring to
Stanford. Both junior Michelle Gee
and law student Curtis Kin served as
senators this year, and Kin was
involved in the USC student govern
ment as an undergraduate. Junior

Tom Baranowski has been president
of the Interfraternity Council.
Let's Be Candid comes across as a
slate of competent, reasonable peo
ple who are likely to impress Univer
sity representatives. Over the past
few years, we've seen that a profes
sional presentation "through the
proper channels" is much more like
ly to garner effective financial sup
port from the provost than noisy
protests. As the only student advo
cates with direct access to high-rank
ing Stanford officials, the COP
should have the personality and
skills to make a good impression.
More fundamentally, Let's Be
Candid deserves praise for raising an
important issue that no previous
group has addressed: Kin points out
that the ASSU's legal position with
the University is pretty murky. Let's
Be Candid intends to clarify what
rights and responsibilities the stu
dent government has, and how inde
pendent the ASSU really is. A
detailed understanding of these
rights will benefit students long
after the slate leaves office.
The slate intends to battle the
stagnation of the senate with two
long-prescribed but never-imple
mented reforms: a fall quarter plan
ning session and a top-10 list of goals
for both senators and the COP
The Students' Alliance slate does
not understand some practical
aspects of politics as well as We
Deserve Better. Let's Be Candid
members, for example, haven't out
lined a realistic method to fund their
promised publications and have an
overly rosy view of the access Uni
versity administrators will grant.
They have a lot of homework to do
before they can address the internal
problems of the ASSU.
For the first time in several years,
students have the chance to elect a
Council of Presidents that doesn't
promise the impossible and then fail
to achieve it. For its candor alone,
Let's Be Candid deserves a chance.
