# 'Politics with people's lives...'
## Community activists discuss welfare 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Panelists discussing "Community
Perspectives on Welfare Reform" last
night used the forum to rail against the
Republican "Contract With America"
and discuss the plight of the disadvan
taged in America.
On the panel were liana Schatz of the
American Jewish Congress, the Rev.
Floyd Thompkins of Memorial Church
and the Jerusalem Baptist Church in

Palo Alto, Assoc. Political Science Prof
Luis Fraga, Marilyn St. Germaine from
the American Indian Child Resource
Center and Terry O'Day of Stanford
Homelessness Action Coalition.
Sponsored by Stanford Hillel, the
Jewish Student Association, Stanford in
Government, the Black Student Union,
MEChA, Stanford American Indian Or
ganization and SHAC, the event attract
ed an audience of only 20 to Building 370.
All of the panelists agreed that the
current welfare system is in need of re

form. "Let me tell you, the welfare sys
tem sucks," St. Germaine said bluntly.
Thompkins said he experienced the
frustrations inherent in the welfare sys
tem through his work as a pastor. "One
of the things they don't tell you is that
it's very tough to get on welfare," he said.
"And as tough as it is to get on welfare,
it's just as tough to get off."
Thompkins explained that current
regulations require recipients to leave
the welfare rolls as soon as they
get a job, thus sending people out
on their own without any ability
to be self-sufficient.
"We had to help them learn to
creatively lie," he said, explaining
that this kept people on public
assistance until they could sup
port themselves.
Nonetheless, the panelists
said, the welfare-reform measure
in the Contract only hurt the sit
uation. "There's nothing in the
'Contract With America' that
gives people what they need to
become self-sufficient," Schatz
said.
Claiming that 60 percent of
those who voted in the 1992 elec
tion listened to talk radio, Fraga
said the impetus for the Con
tract's welfare reform measure
came from "policy debate by slo
gan." Congressmen are "simply
playing politics with people's
lives," he said.
"If I thought that the truth
was Rush Limbaugh," said

Thompkins, "I would come to the
same conclusion (about cutting
welfare funding). But let me tell
you, Rush ain't got the truth."
Commenting on the Republi
can plan to replace the federal
welfare program with grants to
states, Thompkins said, "If we'd
left it to states' rights, we'd still
have slavery. The whole philo
sophical supposition of states'
rights is profoundly dangerous to
those who find themselves with
out power."
The panelists agreed that the
legitimate problems of the poor
are being ignored in the current
debate. "I am amazed at how
much .. . can (be) reported about
the welfare system without men
tioning jobs," Fraga said.
"Being poor is really a full-time
job," said O'Day, explaining that,
for a homeless person, it takes 40
hours a week just to stay alive.
They also "realize that they are
unemployable," he added. With
no showers and no alarm clocks,
for example, it is nearly impossi
ble to get and maintain a job, he
said.
Health and child care need to
be available and a higher mini

mum wage is necessary, agreed
the panel members, to truly help
those on welfare. "People don't
just get unhomeless," said
Schatz. "There's nothing in the
Contract . . . that gives people
what they need to become self

sufficient."
"I'm frightened that welfare
reform is thought of as cutting,"
Thompkins said. Doing so will
neither balance the budget nor
solve the problems with welfare,
he said.
