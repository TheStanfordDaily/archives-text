## Shacking up for life at 22 
### 
IT'S HAPPENED. All over the coun
try, my friends, peers and classmates
are doing it. They are settling into sex
ual relationships that they mean to main
tain for several years, if not for life. Some
are getting married. Some have entered
into marathon engagements. Some are
just shacking up together. Yikes.
Along with this observation, I am also
witness to another, perhaps more disturb
ing, trend. Seniors who are panicking
about leaving college without discovering
the One, the person that they want surgi
cally attached to their hips. People who
offer only lukewarm congratulations to
the attached or soon-to-be-attached ones,
all the time desperate to be in the same
situation.
We've heard the horror stories from
unattached friends and relatives who
have graduated within the last few years;
stories about how you can't meet intelli
gent people in the "real world," and how
the college years are "fertile ground" for
finding this person. They talk of lost
opportunities and become nostalgic
about the people that surrounded them
in college, even if these were people that
they didn't particularly care for. Implicit
ly, they urge you to look a little harder
and be more aware of "potentials" in
your life.
Hell, if it's my relatives, it's not even
close to implicit. They're about as subtle
as sky-writing when it comes to the sig
nificant others in my life or my brother's.
I don't think I've ever spent a vacation at

home without having to hear at least onp
or two aunts joke about how I'm ready to
be married because I'm about to graduate
from college and I know how to cook.
Great.
It's common knowledge that older gen
erations perceived the end of college as a
signal that it's time to settle down and
find the One. Although most of us have
moved past that ideal, many of us still
have the odd notion ingrained in us that
we must pair up at some point in our early
20s. And therefore some of us are filled
with a sense of trepidation about the
future and the likelihood of ending up liv
ing alone on a cow farm in Utah.
It is clear that these people perceive a
big abyss waiting for us after college. In
some ways, they are right. Post-gradua
tion is the first opportunity for real choice
that most of us will have ever experi
enced. Right now, many of us have
already chosen an occupation or location
for the next year, and are presently gear
ing up to face new challenges. Wouldn't it
be so much easier and simpler if you had
the social and emotional security of a
boyfriend or girlfriend to accompany you
on your new adventures?
Of course it would. But there's a differ
ence between genuinely wanting to settle
down with a person at the age of 22 and
feeling like the settling down process is
important in having a stable life at the age
of 22. For people who are genuinely
ecstatic about their impending surgical
attachments, I have nothing but congrat

ulations. It's the other ones who make me
raise an eyebrow and wonder.
However, I haven't lost all hope. A few
weeks ago I was at a point at which I
believed that almost all of my friends had
gone psycho over relationships. I didn't
want to deal with great people who engage
in self-loathing simply because they're
not a half of a whole. Then I went to a
wedding. Perhaps not the most likely
place to find faith in people who don't
want to be attached.
What struck me was the part when the
bride throws the bouquet over her shoul
der to the eligible women. Never having
been to such a wedding, I expected to see
throngs of women jostling each other for
prime catching positions. What I experi
enced was very different, in that only one
woman actually wanted to catch this
thing. The rest of us hung back, vowing to
let the damned thing hit the floor before
we would touch it. And so, being thor
oughly enthusiastic, that lone woman did
catch the bouquet, and turned to beam an
extraordinarily bright smile at the rest of
us. We congratulated her wholeheartedly
and moved on.
