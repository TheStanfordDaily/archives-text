Students must tell University to invest responsibly

IN 1964, STUDENTS from Stanford
and from universities across the
country hitched down to Mississip
pi to help subvert Jim Crow. Twenty
five years later, seeing injustice in
South Africa, students organized
divestment campaigns and rallied
against indirect university support of
apartheid. Stanford students, once
again, helped to lead the fight.
The students involved were bold,
caring and intelligent. While their deci
sions may seem easy in retrospect —
who now wouldn't go down to Missis
sippi if people of color were denied the
vote and routinely lynched? — they
were extraordinary at the time.
This generation of students is faced
with a similar moral question concern

ing the interdependent issues of envi
ronmental and social destruction; a
question of whether we simply want
the environmental movement to follow
its own course, or whether we want to
branch off and innovate. Do we want
to continue to recycle, rally behind
speakers and sit down in front of
nuclear waste dumps — noble efforts
indeed — or shall we throw paper
monkey wrenches into the grinding
gears of Brobdinagian corporate
destruction?
We must become heirs to the Free
South Africa movement and ask our
universities to divest from, or to cast
their money and votes against, giant
industries exploiting the Earth and its
varied inhabitants. We need to fight

against corporations such as Texaco,
the oil corporation that has paved
through the Burma rain forest, plun
dering the wild and funneling cash
directly to the State Law and Order
Restoration Council — an oppressive
military regime that seized power
against the popular will of the people,
assassinated thousands of student
protesters and has kept Aung San Suu
Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize win
ner, under house arrest for six years.
Many of us don't know that our
tuition and tacit approval of Universi
ty investments is contributing to the
plunder of our natural world. With a
little research it has become apparent
that Stanford, like the corporations
destroying our planet, has given barely

a second thought to where their money
has gone. Stanford has invested to
make money, period.
Stanford, in general has an excel
lent environmental record, and that is
cause for optimism; with a little work,
we can and will do better. However,
until Stanford acts against the corpo
rate destruction that currently is over
running our planet, I do not see how
most of us can stay silent. Albert
Camus once wrote, "I should like to be
able to love my country and still love
justice." Perhaps we should modify
that a little bit: "I should like to be
able to love Stanford and still love jus
tice."
