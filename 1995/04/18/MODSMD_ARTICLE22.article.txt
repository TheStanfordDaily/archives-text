# Stealing artifacts from construction sites is illegal, and not a 'perk'
## 
### 
In an article describing the seismic
rehabilitation of Building 20 (Classics)
that appeared in The Daily on April 5
there was an extended discussion of finds
of archaeological and historical artifacts
by construction workers on unspecified
job sites. The article implied that collect
ing finds for personal use is a "perk"
enjoyed by construction workers; and
that finds might not be reported because

of the resulting delay while they are eval
uated by professional archaeologists or
historians.
The looting of artifacts from archaeo
logical and historical sites is a serious
criminal act that results in the destruc
tion of countless (because they are unre
ported) cultural resources each year. It is
a common practice but every construc
tion worker knows that it is illegal and
unprofessional. The failure to report
archaeological or historical finds is also a
serious criminal act and reputable con
struction contractors understand that
this is unacceptable even if it causes cost
ly delays in project completion. I am con
cerned that Stanford students not

receive the impression that these are
acceptable business practices. Looting,
theft and failure to report finds are unac
ceptable on any construction project, not
just at Stanford.
I called a meeting with the workers
quoted in the article and their foreman to
ask for an explanation. They assured me
that no finds were made in Building 20
and that they understood that the prac
tices described in the article are unprofes
sional and unacceptable. They replied to
a student who said they were writing a
class paper and asked if they had ever
found anything unusual on a job. At no
time were they informed that the student
was writing an article for The Daily. I

believe that this is a serious breach of
journalistic ethics that resulted in harm
to the reputations of these workers and
their construction firm, Dinwiddie Con
struction, who were at risk to lose future
Stanford contracts if the behavior
described in the article had actually taken
place on a Stanford project.
I am satisfied that Dinwiddie Con
struction and its employees committed
no wrongdoing on the Building 20 pro
ject. I am not satisfied with the thought
less, irresponsible and possibly unprofes
sional treatment of the subject by The
Daily.
