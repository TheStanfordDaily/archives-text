# ENDORSEMENTS
## Special-fee requests 
### 
To make informed special-fee
endorsements, six members of The
Daily's Editorial Board met last week
end with representatives of each orga
nization requesting a special fee. Com
posed of Daily staff and Stan ford com
munity members, the board reviewed
the budget that each group submitted
to the ASSU and asked the representa
tive(s) questions about the group's
goals, membership and outside fund
raising efforts in addition to ones
about specific line items in its budget.
After these meetings, the Editorial
Board discussed each group's fee
request and reached majority decision
on how to endorse each, request. The
board tried to include as much infor
mation as possible on the groups in the
endorsement explanations; still, The
Daily encourages all students to pick
up a copy of the elections handbook and
read over the budgets themselves.
IF ANY one trend stands out in this
year's special-fee requests, it is
that many student groups made
clear efforts to cut their budgets. This
was in part because many groups lost
their special fee requests in last year's
elections, but it is clear that student
organizations are realizing that voters
are tired of spiraling special-fee
requests. The responses of some stu
dent groups to this environment have
been positive and admirable; still, The
Daily felt that it could not endorse
some groups.
In making its recommendations on
ASSU special-fee requests, the Editori
al Board used five guiding criteria,
which The Daily published in an edito
rial on April 4:

• Whether the group provides good
value for the dollar.
• Whether the group makes a conscien
tious and reasonably successful effort
to involve and serve a significant por
tion of the student body.
• Whether the group demonstrates ini
tiative in self-funding; that is, whether
its budget reflects that it is actively
seeking revenue sources other than the
special fee.
• Whether the group has responded to
its refund rate and the results of last
year's elections.
• Whether the student body and not
the University and other parties should
be funding the group.
If the group in question met these
criteria sufficiently, it received a "yes."
If it did not meet the criteria suffi
ciently, it received a "no."
Groups that met some well but failed
on others received a "without recom
mendation," meaning that The Daily
Editorial Board could not confidently
endorse the group either way.
A "no recommendation" signals
that the Editorial Board chose not to
make an endorsement on that fee, or
did not meet with representatives of
the group.
The annual costs per student are indi
cated in parentheses; they were estimat
ed using fall quarter's total enrollment
of 14,031 students.
The Daily welcomes responses to its
endorsements from groups or students;
they will be published tomorrow or
Thursday on a space-available basis.
Please submit them as early as pos
sible today at The Daily office, or send
