## Stein gains respect with flexibility, not flamboyance Modest senior leads team into NCAAs 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
You probably don't spot him as
you walk into the spacious Ford
Center training facility. After all,
he doesn't look like what you're
looking for. You expect the co-cap
tain of a collegiate gymnastics
powerhouse to be vocal, confident,
perhaps even cocky. But you find
none of these things in senior
Stanford gymnast Josh Stein. Of
course, once you see him compete,
there is no doubt he's the one.
Clearly, Stein is the best gym
nast on the team. A two-time U.S.
National Team member and last
year's NCAA runner-up, he would
be the best on most any team.
While some of the younger guys
may approach his ability as they
mature and gain experience, at
the moment, he is the man.
"Without a doubt, Josh is a
great athlete," said sophomore
teammate and friend lan
Bachrach. "He's as good as we'd
all like to be."
Stein's greatest strength is his
ability to hit his routines every
time. He doesn't have a spectacu
lar bread-and-butter event, but he
doesn't need one because he
rarely makes mistakes.
"His trademark is definitely
his consistency," said head coach
Sadao Hamada. "He doesn't real
ly have a single strong event and

he has no weaknesses."
And yet, Stein is exceedingly
modest. He speaks of his accom
plishments as if they represent
the norm, showing little pride,
only intensity and the drive to
succeed and improve.
"I don't really consider myself
what Sadao would call a 'Big
Gun,' " he said. "There are defi
nitely guys like [1992 Stanford
Olympian] Jair Lynch who have
really proven themselves and I
don't think I'm at that stage yet."
Hamada disagrees vehemently.
"Josh is definitely in the top
level of gymnasts," he argued. "I
think not including him as one of
the handful of gymnasts who
could actually win NCAAs this
year would be a mistake."
And yet, Stein has not always
been so dominant. In the junior
division, he was successful, mak
ing the junior national team three
times, but never really considered
at the top of his class. As a fresh
man and a sophomore, he con
tributed to Stanford's back-to
back NCAA titles but never really
showed the talent to be a super
star.
Then last year, it all turned
around. He qualified for the 1994
U.S. National team, beating sev
eral highly-talented athletes and
surprising everybody. The take
off culminated at the end of last
season with his spectacular all

around finish at the NCAA cham
pionships. Both he and Hamada
agree that the key to his surge has
been increased confidence.
"Last year, I felt like I devel
oped a lot of strength and lost
some excess weight to reach my
optimal physical condition," Stein
said, "but the key was definitely
performing well at Summer
Nationals and actually making
the National Team. It kind of
showed me where I was at and
what I was capable of accomplish
ing."
Like many gifted athletes,
Stein showed interest in the sport
as early as nursery school and
began competing at the age of
seven, when his family moved to
Houston. The presence of Bela
Karolyi, perhaps the most
renowned gymnastics coach in the
world, made the city a natural
center for the sport.
Throughout his teenage years,
Josh looked to a future on the
U.S. Olympic team. At the time,
the lifeblood of the squad came
out of UCLA. Stanford never
entered his mind as a college pos
sibility.
"After the 1984 Summer
Games, I wanted to go there,"
Stein said of UCLA. "It was the
center of collegiate gymnastics
and for a few years, it was the only
