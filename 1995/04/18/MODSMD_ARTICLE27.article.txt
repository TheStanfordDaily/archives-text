# Birthday wish
## Playoff Kings 
### 
I don't like to think of myself as greedy. Since
it's my birthday, however, I feel I'm entitled to
have just one wish of my own come true.
My beloved Sacramento Kings absolutely
must make the playoffs. If this happens, all other
wishes are icing on the birthday cake. I have suf
fered too long.

Since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985-
86, they were kind enough to tease naive fans like
me by making the playoffs with a 37-45 mark that
first year. Little did any of us realize on April 22,
1986, the date the eventual conference champion
Rockets knocked off the Kings in game three of
the Western quarterfinals, that Arco Arena
would never host another postseason game.
That 10,333 seat box is gone, converted into a
Sprint building. Now the Kings play in a profes
sional-caliber arena with a capacity of 17,317. It's
still Arco Arena and it's still in the middle of a
bunch of undeveloped nothingness. But it finally
has a respectable team.
Bolstered by new, Magic-rip-off colors and
