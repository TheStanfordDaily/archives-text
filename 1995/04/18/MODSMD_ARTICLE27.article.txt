# Birthday wish
## Playoff Kings 
### 
I don't like to think of myself as greedy. Since
it's my birthday, however, I feel I'm entitled to
have just one wish of my own come true.
My beloved Sacramento Kings absolutely
must make the playoffs. If this happens, all other
wishes are icing on the birthday cake. I have suf
fered too long.

Since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985-
86, they were kind enough to tease naive fans like
me by making the playoffs with a 37-45 mark that
first year. Little did any of us realize on April 22,
1986, the date the eventual conference champion
Rockets knocked off the Kings in game three of
the Western quarterfinals, that Arco Arena
would never host another postseason game.
That 10,333 seat box is gone, converted into a
Sprint building. Now the Kings play in a profes
sional-caliber arena with a capacity of 17,317. It's
still Arco Arena and it's still in the middle of a
bunch of undeveloped nothingness. But it finally
has a respectable team.

two rookies who actually rebound,
the Kings started strong and, for
over three months, never let up.
Garry St. Jean, the Kings'
umpteenth coach since the move
from Kansas City, finally had
instilled defense in a previously
generous squad.
After a first 48 games,
the Kings were 28-20 and only two
wins away from their best season in
nine years — in February. The
Denver Nuggets were eight games
back in the rear view mirror for the
final playoff spot. But I had a feel
ing it was too good to be true.
Sure enough, the Kings faltered.
They began to play like the Queens
of old, losing to the Clippers at
home, etc. Before Sacramento
knew what had hit them, the
Nuggets were looking down on the
once-proud Kings.
I watched in disbelief, but then
again, why should I have been sur
prised? This is the same squad that
picked Joe Kleine over Kevin John
son. These are the same Kings that

took the top overall pick in the
draft, picked Pervis Ellison and
shipped him off to Washington
after 32 games in a Kings uniform.
I was used to unbelievable inepti
tude.
As a longtime Kings fan, I envi
sioned all the painful flashbacks. I
remembered opening night in
Sacramento in 1985, when they
gave us a dose of things to come by
blowing a 19-point third-quarter
lead and losing to the Clippers.
I recalled Jan. 11, 1991 — the
day I wore a bag over my head to
Foothill High School to commemo
rate the Kings' 101-59 loss at Char
lotte the night before. The Hornets,
in their third year in the league,
had held the Kings to the lowest
single-game output in the NBA
since the first year of the shot clock,
1955.
Through it all, I remembered
how I still have my first Kings t
shirt in my closet. My longest-last
ing 1985 Christmas present is way
too small and has more holes than a
golf course, but it shows my dedica
tion. I used to wear it or my other
long-since-discarded Kings shirt
the day after every victory to
school. Rare were the times when
Mom had to do any additional laun

dry to assure that my clothes would
be clean.
One year even passed in which I
never had to wear the shirt after a
road game. I remember well listen
ing to Gary Gerould call the Kings'
victory at Philadelphia in the
fourth road game of 1990-91. The
Kings then became the biggest joke
in NBA history, losing their final 37
away games.
Of course, the streak lingered
over the franchise that entire sum
mer. In November 1991 I was just
itching for a chance to kill the
record. But it didn't go easily. On
Nov. 20, I observed the incredible
one-year anniversary of the Kings'
last road win. They had almost
pulled out the shocker the night
before in the Omni, but Atlanta was
just too tough.
On Nov. 24,1991,369 days after
that glorious Philadelphia road
win, I parked my rear end on the
couch to watch consecutive road
loss number 44. The then-pitiful
Orlando Magic were the predators
and Grant Napear, the often
scorned voice of the Kings, was call
ing the action along with cheerlead
er Ted Green.
As I watched somewhat disinter
ested, a funny thing began to hap

pen. The Kings took the lead. And
kept it. They were up by eight early
in the fourth quarter. Though the
Magic battled back to retake the
advantage, the Kings snagged it
right back. I'll never forget when
Grant grinned like a kid in a candy
store and said, "Put it in the book
and send L-Train to the line. The
streak is history!"
I hadn't been that pumped
about the Kings since that date in
three-and-a half years. But this
Sunday, I hope, my euphoria will at
long last surpass that fateful day.
The Kings are 37-41, the Nuggets
one game better. If they stay even,
and the Kings' schedule is tougher,
the Kings' last game of the season
will be the first ever on network TV
in the Sacramento era. At Denver.
Winner goes to the playoffs and is
San Antonio's sacrificial lamb.
Loser goes to the lottery, which has
featured only one team in every
year since its inception (guess who).
I'll be watching. And since I'm
asking for just one present, I hope
you'll root shamelessly with me. Go
Kings or go home.

Jeremy hopes that Marv Albert will
unabashedly yell, "Yes!" if his wish
comes true.
