# Men's linksters sixth in struggle at Tempe
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golfers
went into last weekend's Thun
derbird Invitational knowing
that No. 1 Oklahoma State might
beat them. But they certainly
didn't expect all those other
teams to.
The second-ranked Cardinal
fell victim to stellar play by five
other teams to finish sixth down
in Tempe, Ariz. The squad lagged
19 strokes behind of the top
team, No. 16 Arkansas, and nine
behind OSU, which finished
third.
The finish was the second
worst for Stanford this season,
topped only by their eighth-place
finish back in September at the
Tucker Invitational in Albu
querque, N.M. However, senior
All-Americans Notah Begay and
Casey Martin were both absent
from the lineup then, and the
Cardinal played five strong this
' weekend.
"We just basically got a good
shellacking," said head coach
Wally Goodwin. "We're way
behind everybody in terms of
practice time and tournament
play and such and it's definitely
showing. We have a lot of work to
do."
The weather accounted for a
i great deal of the team's misery as
; well. However, it was cold, harsh

winds that greeted the team
rather than the scorching desert
heat that the squad had prepared
for. While the weather was mild
during the second round, 30-plus
mile-per-hour gusts during the
other two rounds blew any hope
of victory away.
"The conditions were exactly
the opposite of what we expect
ed," Goodwin 3aid. "It was colder
than heck and the winds were the
biggest I've ever seen in Arizona.
"The wind is just a huge equal
izer for us. No wind and we're
one of the best. With wind, we're
just an average bunch of guys."
The team proved their coach
right, posting their worst scores
in the blustery first and third
rounds. During the second round
the conditions more suited the
tastes of the squad as the winds
died down and the Cardinal came
together to score a 1-over-par
289, the best showing of the day.
"It's really hard for us to pre
pare our wind game," said senior
All-American Steve Burdick. "It's
definitely one of the drawbacks to
playing in California vs. playing
in Texas or Arizona or anywhere
else in the Southwest.
"I guess we can always prac
tice by hitting wind-type shots on
nice days, but nothing really can
prepare you for competing in
those conditions except actually
doing it."
The brightest spot for the
squad was the strong play of
senior Notah Begay. The All-
American fired consecutive
under-par rounds to recover
from an off start and finish tied
for sixth at 216.
"Notah really showed his
gamesmanship," Goodwin said.
"All of the guys had problems,
but Notah seemed to handle
himself especially well. Even
when he bogeyed a hole, he hit
some great shots."
The team's mediocre finish
put a damper on the highly-her
alded matchup between Okla
homa State and Stanford, con
sidered by most the top two
teams in the nation by far. The
Cowboys had beaten the Cardi
nal four previous times vs. two
wins by Stanford en route to
taking the No. 1 ranking away
from the Cardinal in February.
However, the average margin of
victory was heavily in Stan
ford's favor and provided proof
that the team could compete
with OSU.
"Maybe too much emphasis
is placed on the rankings,"
Goodwin said. "Sure the meet
was important as far as rank
ings go. If we had won we could
have threatened them for the
top spot, but for the most part,
the rankings are inconsequen
tial right now.
"All we are concerned with is
getting ready for NCAAs. We're
in a constant state of prepara
tion, we'll be preparing all the
way up to the final hole and the
final shot."
