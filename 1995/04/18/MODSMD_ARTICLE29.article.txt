# No. 7 sailing knocks off top-ranked Navy
## Lowry guides squad to 4th at key East intersectional 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
The Stanford sailing team's
national tour continued this
weekend with a stop in
Kingsport, N.Y..
In a test against the best
schools in the country, the No. 7
Cardinal captured a solid fourth
place in the Admiral's Cup,
despite its sub-par sailing.
Stanford uncharacteristically
started slowly in the two-day
regatta. The Cardinal took sever
al races to adjust to unfamiliar
boats in the three-division race.
Half of the 18 races was sailed

each day, with the A and B divi
sions switching boats at the end
of the first day. On Saturday, a
bigger boat, the 420, was used in
the A division, the Flying Junior
in the B division and a single
manned boat, the Laser, in the C
division. The "majority of practice""
time on the Farm has been devot
ed to sailing Flying Juniors, the
boat sailed at District and Nation
al competition.
Breezy conditions hampered
the Cardinal throughout the
early races. Saturday's first race
teamed senior skipper Charles

on course.
Meade with freshman Betsy
Carmichael but the duo sailed
only one race together. The wind
forced coach Steve Bourdow to
replace Carmichael with the heav
ier Dave Thomas, also a fresh
man. The switch may have helped
Stanford in the long run but the
change hurt the A division team
in the short run. Changing crews

challenged Meade to establish a
consistent rhythm.
The B division boat of fresh
man skipper John Meade and
sophomore crew Megan Ireson
started strongly. Comfortable in
Flying Juniors, the younger
Meade sailed well enough to end
the day in third place.
The consistent bright spot of
the day, and the regatta, was
junior Adam Lowry's perfor
mance in the C division.
"He totally held up his end,"
Bourdow said.

Carmichael returned to crew
with Charles Meade in the A divi
sion the second day of competi
tion. Only five races into Sunday,
the duo climbed from sixth to first
place. The team probably would
have captured the division if not
for two poor starts, one a false
start that ended up disqualifying
the boat for that race. Neverthe
less, Meade and Carmichael still
managed to finish third in the A
division.
John Meade and Dave Thomas
formed Stanford's second-day B

division boat. Meade could not
improve on his third-place stand
ing. The freshman had a difficult
time dealing with the unfamiliar
420 boat. Unable to recover from
disappointing early races, Meade
began to take major risks that
hurt his sailing. With only three
top-10 finishes on the day, Stan
ford dropped to eighth in the final
B division standings.
On the other hand, Lowry
matched his Saturday perfor
mance with a strong Sunday. The
junior held his own against the

other top sailors in a challenging
current, notching fourth among
Lasers.
No. 7 Stanford's overall
fourth-place showing placed them
behind champion Tufts, Old
Dominion and St. Mary's, Md.
The Cardinal finished ahead of
top-ranked Navy and host No. 6
Kings Point, N.Y.. Bourdow
wasn't overwhelmed by the com
petition and feels Stanford proved
a point the team has long realized.
"They (Eastern schools] are
definitely going to have to look at

us," Bourdow said. "We already
knew that."
However Stanford's challeng
ing weekend revealed several
mendable weaknesses. On the
water, Bourdow expects practice
to correct tactical problems such
as starting, but the most impor
tant improvements will occur off
the water.
a We have to be able to main
tain a positive mental attitude in
the face of doing poorly," Bour
dow said. "That's just mental
toughness."
