The Stanford sailing team's
national tour continued this
weekend with a stop in
Kingsport, N.Y..
In a test against the best
schools in the country, the No. 7
Cardinal captured a solid fourth
place in the Admiral's Cup,
despite its sub-par sailing.
Stanford uncharacteristically
started slowly in the two-day
regatta. The Cardinal took sever
al races to adjust to unfamiliar
boats in the three-division race.
Half of the 18 races was sailed

each day, with the A and B divi
sions switching boats at the end
of the first day. On Saturday, a
bigger boat, the 420, was used in
the A division, the Flying Junior
in the B division and a single
manned boat, the Laser, in the C
division. The "majority of practice""
time on the Farm has been devot
ed to sailing Flying Juniors, the
boat sailed at District and Nation
al competition.
Breezy conditions hampered
the Cardinal throughout the
early races. Saturday's first race
teamed senior skipper Charles
