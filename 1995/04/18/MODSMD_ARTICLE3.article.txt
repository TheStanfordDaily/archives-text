# Fee reform bill will split voting on student groups
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Created in the wake of the de
feat of the Balanced Funding Deal,
another reform — the Common
Sense amendment — is intended
to reform the special-fee system by
more fairly distributing the cost of
special fees among students while
maintaining the right to a fee re
fund.
The amendment allows each or
ganization to request fees from
one of three voting populations —
undergraduates, graduate stu
dents and the whole student body.
Currently each organization re
quests its fee from the combined
group.

Only the from
which the fee is jested can vote
on the measure and the fee alloca
tion needs majority approval with
the majority constituting 15 per
cent of the total eligible popula
tion.
No person, however, would be
denied services even if that person
was not part of the population
which voted on the fee, said bill co
author Jon Oram, a coterminal
student. However, groups may re
quire such persons to pay the
amount of the group's special fee if
they intend to use the organiza
tion's services, he added.
Oram said that the amendment

would be better than the status
quo. "It is a definite improvement
over the current system," Oram
said. "Groups with a strong con
stituent base will be able to get
something."
"Some student groups serve
only undergraduates and they
don't get funded because the
graduates veto them," said
amendment co-author Scott
Moss, a coterminal student.
"Likewise the Graduate Student
Association serves graduates well,
but can't get funding from under
graduates."

If the plan had been in effect
last year, all of the special-fee
groups except for the You Can
Make A Difference conference —
which did not receive a majority
of the undergraduate vote —
would have received funding,
Oram said, assuming they had
requested their fee from the cor
rect population.
"The amendment would fix the
fee system, provide stability and
retain the right to fee refunds,"
said ASSU Deputy Senate Chair
Michael Choo, an amendment co
sponsor.
Oram estimated that the fees
will total $37 a quarter for under
graduates and $18 a quarter for
graduates if the amendment pass
es, basing his figures on this

year's appropriations requests.
However, this figure does not
include a fee-refund buffer —
which is currently added to spe
cial fees to mitigate the effects of
refunds.
The amendment itself contains
non-binding language about the
elimination of fee-refund buffers,
Oram said.
"When the senate passed [the
amendment] it added a clause to
the bill that says when it's passed,
we're going to have to make by
law changes to implement it,"
Oram said. "We advise the senate
to get rid of the fee-refund
buffer."
While the senate can choose to
ignore this recommendation, "it's
hard to imagine the senate not

getting rid of the fee-refund
buffers," Oram said.
However, if the senate disre
garded the recommendation and
left the buffers in place, student
fees would total approximately
$44 a quarter for undergraduates
and $22 a quarter for graduates,
Oram said.
But Moss said he thought the
elimination of fee-refund buffers
would encourage manipulation of
the system.
"To the extent that getting rid
of the buffer would prevent stu
dent groups from getting the
funds that they need, they would
inflate their budgets," Moss said.
"Every student group would have
to lie to get the funds that they
need."
