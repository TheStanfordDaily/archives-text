# Softball finds Arizona welcome mats rough
## Wildcats, Sun Devils sweep overmatched Cardinal in first trip to desert 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
All things considered, it could have been worse.
The Stanford softball team's first-ever road trip to
Arizona ended predictably, as the Cardinal (10-24
overall, 1-15 in the Pacific 10 Conference) were
swept in doubleheaders against Arizona and Arizona
State.
"They were overpowering," Stanford coach Sandy

Pearce said of Arizona. "There just wasn't a whole
lot we could do [to stop them]."
Against the Wildcats (41-4, 7-3 in the Pac-10) on
Friday, Stanford quickly found out why the Wildcats
are the two-time defending NCAA champion, losing
the first game 25-0.
Arizona used its potent offense to dominate the
game at the plate. After scoring two runs in the bot
tom of the first, the onslaught began in the second.
The Wildcats batted around twice in the inning, scor

ing a school-record 15 runs. Every member of the
powerful Wildcat lineup had at least one hit, and
eight of the nine starters had at least two hits.
The explosion was highlighted by consecutive
home runs off the bats of first baseman Amy
Chellevold, center fielder Julie Rietan (who had come
in to replace starter Wendy O'Brien, who had already
notched two hits and four RBIs) and second baseman
Jenny Daulton. Daulton's shot
was her 18th of the year. Short
stop Laura Espinoza, who came
into the game leading the nation
with '26 home runs, failed to park
one against Stanford. She did,
however, manage to smack three
doubles in four at bats and drive
in four runs.
"They just got on a hitting
roll," Pearce said. "They've been
doing that all year against every
one they play. The funny thing is
[sophomore] Angela [Webb] was
pitching well. She was firing it in
there two inches off the ground
and they were line-driving it
everywhere, hitting every hole
possible."
In the third inning, Pearce
replaced Webb with junior Katie
Beattie, who promptly yielded
eight more runs in just two-thirds
of an inning. Mercifully, Webb
returned to put out the fire for the
remainder of the game. For the
game, Arizona totaled an amazing
21 hits.
Chellevold, the Wildcat leadoff
hitter, showed why she is the
nation's premier catalyst. The
first baseman reached base all five
times she came to the plate, col
lecting two hits and three walks in
the game. She also stole two bases
off Webb and catcher Lynn Ander
son.
"That's why she's an All-Amer
ican," Pearce said. "She's just bril
liant, and we really couldn't find a
way to get her out."
The Wildcats were equally
impressive on the other side of the
field, as sophomore fireballer Cari
Dolan improved to 21-1 by tossing
a two-hit shutout. Dolan struck

out one Cardinal batter and didn't
walk anyone over five innings of
work. (The game was called after
five innings due to the 10-run lead
limit). For Stanford, junior Lynn
Anderson and freshman designat
ed hitter Kelly Richardson each
had one hit.
Game two was an entirely dif
ferent story, as Stanford stayed in
the game throughout, only to fall
victim to a four-run Wildcat rally
in the bottom of the sixth.
Chellevold again provided the
spark for Arizona, finishing with a
hit, a walk and two runs scored.
Espinoza had two more hits, fin
ishing 5-for-7 on the afternoon.
Nancy Evans (18-3) got the win
for the Wildcats, limiting Stanford
to five hits and one run over seven
innings. Evans struck out eight
Cardinal batters and walked
three. Sophomore shortstop Sum
mer Lee collected two hits in three
at bats for Stanford and drove in
junior Amanda Renteria, who had
singled, with the team's lone run
in the top of the third. Webb took
the loss to fall to 4-15.
"[Angela] changed things a lot
in [game two]," Pearce said. "She
pitched them in on their hands
more, and they had trouble with
that. You could see them getting
frustrated."
Still, Arizona managed to bang
out 11 hits in the second game.
Their lower run output, however,
demonstrates Webb's improved
performance.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
journeyed to Tempe for a rematch
with Arizona State, which had
swept Stanford in a doubleheader
at El Camino Park earlier in the
year. The change in site did noth
ing to change the result, as the
Sun Devils took both games by
scores of 3-0 and 11-1.
Stanford hit well in game one,

outhitting the Sun Devils 8-5. As
has been the case many times this
season, however, the Cardinal
were unable to put their hits
together to score runs. Lee and
Renteria continued to benefit
from a mid-season lineup change
that put them at opposite ends of
the lineup, as both players had
two hits in the game. Lee's hits
included a double off the wall in
left, some 225 feet away. The mid
dle of Stanford's lineup failed to
produce, however, and Stanford
remained scoreless.
"Had [Lee's] drive been hit to a
regulation-sized fence, it would
have been gone," Pearce said. Ari
zona State's fences are deeper
than normal, keeping the ball in
the park.
The Sun Devils broke open a
scoreless game with two runs in
the bottom of the third and anoth
er run in the fourth. First base
man Kristin Korb led Arizona
State with two hits and one RBI.
Carrie Breedlove improved to
17-5 with the victory, while Webb
took the loss.
Game two got away from Stan
ford, as ASU erupted for 11 runs
on 10 hits in five innings to put
the Cardinal away.
"We've never played two night
games back-to-back," Pearce said.
"After playing a pretty solid First
game, we just got tired. Angela
was worn out by the fourth game
[of the weekend], so she started
walking people. When that hap
pens, it makes it a lot harder on
the defense."
For the game, Webb walked
eight Sun Devil batters. Stanford
also committed three errors in the
game, leading to three unearned
runs.
"You just can't make mistakes
against these teams," Pearce said.
"They always make you pay."
