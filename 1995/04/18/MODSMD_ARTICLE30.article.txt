All things considered, it could have been worse.
The Stanford softball team's first-ever road trip to
Arizona ended predictably, as the Cardinal (10-24
overall, 1-15 in the Pacific 10 Conference) were
swept in doubleheaders against Arizona and Arizona
State.
"They were overpowering," Stanford coach Sandy

Pearce said of Arizona. "There just wasn't a whole
lot we could do [to stop them]."
Against the Wildcats (41-4, 7-3 in the Pac-10) on
Friday, Stanford quickly found out why the Wildcats
are the two-time defending NCAA champion, losing
the first game 25-0.
Arizona used its potent offense to dominate the
game at the plate. After scoring two runs in the bot
tom of the first, the onslaught began in the second.
The Wildcats batted around twice in the inning, scor

ing a school-record 15 runs. Every member of the
powerful Wildcat lineup had at least one hit, and
eight of the nine starters had at least two hits.
The explosion was highlighted by consecutive
home runs off the bats of first baseman Amy
Chellevold, center fielder Julie Rietan (who had come
in to replace starter Wendy O'Brien, who had already
notched two hits and four RBIs) and second baseman
