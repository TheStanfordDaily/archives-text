# Cycling close to top in home races

The Stanford cycling team, the top-ranked
squad in the country, rode to a respectable finish at
the Stanford Race Weekend despite the absence of
a few key riders and the pressures of hosting the
races. While Stanford finished fourth in the criteri
um and third in the road race — a few points
behind second-place Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo —
the team won the time triad and had impressive
individual performances.
Under threatening skies, the team rode in the
road race at Patterson Pass on Saturday. The race
was highlighted by graduate students Joan Wilson
and Megan Troxwell who broke away from the lead
pack to finish one-two in the women's division. Wil
son rode solo for 35 miles to take the women's road
race title. The women's team, however, was with
out Tracy Timms, one of their top riders who won
this race last year.
"We almost always have tit least one rider who's
head and shoulders above most of the conference
when it comes to climbing," said Coach Art Walker.
"This year we have at least two in Joan and
Megan."
The men's A team was led by Dario Falquier who
finished seventh, and, in the men's C category, Dan
Lyons took second in the 20-man sprint to the fin
ish while Ben Gieger took fourth and Dave Cor
nelius took sixth. However, California outshone all
the competition in the road race by accumulating
209 points to Cal Poly's 153 and Stanford's 147.
The squad came back Sunday morning to win
the team time trial in Woodside. Even though the
men's A team had only two people compared
four-man teams for other schools, the team still
came in third. Ma-Ne Rodriguez, who was out with
mono, came back for the time trial and helped the

men's B team clinch a victory by
two seconds over UC-Davis. "I
think that Ma-Ne coming out for
the time trial helped us hugely,"
Walker said.
The women's team finished sec
ond behind Cal Poly, but Stanford
still won the overall time trial,
accumulating 388 points for a 31-
point victory over UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Finally, in Sunday afternoon's
criterium, Stanford finished fourth
as UC-Davis won the title and Cal
took second. Rodriguez once again
led the B team by winning a field
sprint to take second in the men's B
category. The men's A team took
second and third in a field sprint;
the women's A team, exhausted by
solo efforts the previous day in the
road race, was overtaken by other
schools.
Since national rankings are
computed differently than confer
ence standings, Stanford remains
third in the conference after the
weekend. While Cal needs only one
more win to carry the maximum

allowable 10 wins into the confer
ence championships, Stanford is
now competing with UC-Davis and
Cal Poly for second place.
Walker said that the team was
exhausted after having to organize
the race weekend as well as race in
it. "Puttingon three races is much
harder than racing in three races,"
Walker said. Walker credits many
volunteers who helped with the
organization for making it a lot eas
ier for the bikers themselves.
"We were mostly relieved after
the race to be done with the diffi
cult job of hosting the event," said
grad student Dave Bailey.
However, Walker said that, tak
ing into account the added labor,
the team performed well
Next week, the team will ride at
Chico State in a road race, an indi
vidual time trial and a criterium.
The tough road race includes
unpaved patches and will be up to
98 miles long depending on the cat
egory. In addition, the 10-mile time
trial will be held the same day as
the road race. Stanford is one of the
favorites in the time trial in which
bikers follow each other in one
minute intervals trying to achieve
the fastest time. Finally, the criteri
um will be held on one city block.
