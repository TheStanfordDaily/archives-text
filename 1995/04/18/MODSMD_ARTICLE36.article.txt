# Six students win awards for study abroad
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
So many Stanford students receive scholar
ships of one sort or another that awards have
become an everyday occurrence. But there are
some academic prizes, like the Rhodes and the
Marshall scholarships, that still raise an eye
brow or two when someone wins one.
Take senior Kira Weissman. She is one of
only 10 undergraduates in the United States
selected to receive the prestigious Churchill
Scholarship. The award, sponsored by the
Winston Churchill Foundation of the United
States, pays for graduate work at Churchill
College, Cambridge University, in the fields of
engineering, mathematics, economics and sci
ence.
In addition, electrical engineering graduate
student Andrei Stoica and Patricia Mazon, a
doctoral candidate in history, have won the
esteemed Bundeskanzler award, which pays
for one year of study at a German university
or research institution.
And seniors Andrew Elia and Christian
Heath, along with graduate student Bruce
Lidl, have won DAAD awards. The DAAD (a
German acronym for German Academic
Exchange), like the Bundeskanzler, provides
for one year of study at a German university.
Weissman, who will graduate in June with

a degree in chemistry, said she hopes to com
plete the equivalent of a master's degree
through her Churchill Scholarship. She plans
to focus her research in the area of biochem
istry.
"I was ecstatic when I heard the news over
the phone," Weissman said.
Weissman credits both her time at Stanford
and her adviser, Chemistry Prof. James Coll
man, as invaluable influences on her rese/irch
work.
"Professor Collman helped immeasurably,"
said Weissman. "He took me on as a lab
researcher and helped me out by nominating
me for awards and giving me advice."
Collman called Weissman "exemplary" and
"extraordinary," adding that he rarely
encounters an undergraduate of her caliber.
"She's great, she does a super job," he said.
"She TAs for me in Chem 32 and has been a
lab researcher for me for years.
"And unlike a lot of other technical stu
dents, she writes better than any undergradu
ate I've ever encountered. I'm trying to get her
to edit a book I'm currently working on," he
added.
In addition to her academic accomplish
ments, Weissman is a teaching assistant in the
Chemistry Department and has co-authored
two papers printed in the Journal of the Amer
ican Chemical Society.

As for other award winners, Stoica said he
will pursue a general course of study at the
University of Berlin with his Bundeskanzler
Award.
"Basically my greatest goal is to become
fluent in German," said Stoica. "I've had two
years of German language courses and spent
a summer in Germany, but I want to further
my knowledge of German culture too," he
added.
The Bundeskanzler Award was established
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1990 under an
agreement between Germany and the United
States with the goal of giving students first
hand knowledge of German culture.
Mazon, who could not be reached for com
ment, plans to spend her year in Germany
revising her dissertation and beginning
research on the first female politicians in Ger
many during the Weimar Republic.
Lidl, the winner of a DAAD grant, said he
sees the award as being "integral" to his
future research.
"I'll be studying the process of ideological
reform in the post-World War II German
Social Democratic Party at the University of
Bonn," said Lidl.
Both Elia and Heath, the other DAAD
recipients, will be graduating this June with
degrees in chemistry and German Studies
respectively.
