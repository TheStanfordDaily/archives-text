## Bill seeks to increase access to ASSU records 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Students voting tomorrow
have the opportunity to ratify the
Freedom of Information bill,
guaranteeing students the right
to view most ASSU records.
Although the ASSU already
makes records available to stu
dents in its by laws, the proposed
amendment would "make it im
possible for the senate to sus
pend" these rights, said Donald
Aingworth, graduate senator and
co-author of the bill.
However, the bill "doesn't
change anything in terms of what

people can or cannot do. It just
moves it verbatim," Aingworth
said.
If the bill is passed, students
will be ensured the right to look at
ASSU records, with several excep
tions. These include business
records of ASSU businesses, fi
nancial records for non-funded ac
counts of organizations banking
with the ASSU, Legal Counseling
records and personnel records of
non-exempt employees.
According to the bill, "access
must be open to all and subject
only to administrative require
ments to safeguard the informa
tion."
The reason for the bill is simple,
Aingworth explained. "I don't
trust the senate. They are more
interested in following their own
agendas and their own special

interests.
"Right now, the senate could
deny students' access," he said,
adding that there have been
instances where senators have
provided less than full disclosure.
However, the senate also has the
power to interpret and override
constitutional amendments.
The bill was passed unani
mously by the senate to bring it to
a student vote.
