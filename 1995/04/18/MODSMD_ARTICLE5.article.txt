# Group solicits ideas for new science core
## Current proposal contains several tracks; committee wants faculty input, involvement 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
A committee charged with designing the
new three-quarter science distribution re
quirement is asking science, mathematics
and engineering faculty to submit propos
als for core tracks encompassing certain
common topics.
At meetings today and tomorrow, the
Mathematics-Science-Engineering Core
committee will formally present its propos
al and meet with faculty interested in de
signing and teaching tracks within the pro
posed new core.
The Commission on Undergraduate Ed
ucation recommended a science core in its
report last October. The core, if put into op
eration, would replace current distribution
requirements 4, 5 and 6 (mathematical sci
ences, natural sciences, and technology and
applied sciences).
As proposed, the core would contain sev-

eral tracks covering simi
lar topics with different
foci in a manner similar to
the Cultures, Ideas and
Values core.
"We think it should not
be a single course but a
general program which
has many tracks," said
Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood, the committee

chair and a member of the commission.
"We want there to be certain common fea
tures across all the tracks."
The request for proposals outlines sev
eral areas each core track would cover, in
cluding concepts of science, engineering,
math and laboratory work.
Concepts common to all science core
tracks might include science as a structure
of testable hypotheses, the character of


Osgood
physical law, the interplay
between the physical world and
biological systems and product
design, according to the request.
"The point is not to give a
series of lectures with these top
ics as titles," according to the
request. "The point is to find
problems within and across disci
plines that will exemplify these
ideas."
Laboratory work should be
emphasized so students get
"practical hands-on experience
with what scientists do," said
committee member Jonathan
Eisen, a graduate student in bio
logical sciences.
"It doesn't have to be a . . .
dissecting the frog type of thing,"
he said. The work could involve
computers or work outside of the
laboratory setting, "as long as it
gives you the experience of
designing an experiment, getting
introduced to the problems of an
experiment and gathering and

analyzing data," he said.
Math would be involved in
most areas of this experimenting
and learning process, according
to the request. "It is impossible
to have a serious, sustained
treatment of any area of science
or engineering without the use of
the language and methods of
mathematics."
Those faculty involved in
designing tracks will be asked to
present the committee with let
ters of intent — outlining briefly
who will work on the track and
what it will cover — by May 19,
Osgood said.
More detailed proposals will
be completed this summer, he
said, after which faculty will
look for financial support. If
approved and financed, the pro
gram could be implemented dur
ing the 1996-97 academic year,
at the earliest.
"We want to know how great
the interest is among faculty in
teaching a course like this and
really sustaining a course like
this," Osgood said. By holding
meetings, the committee hopes
to reach "faculty members who
might be interested in teaching

the course but don't know how to
get together with other faculty
members," he said.
Faculty members involved
with the core "should highlight
their own interests, finding prob
lems and examples that illustrate
those," he said.
For example, biology profes
sors could create a track empha
sizing their own field. "You can
do all the science that we expect
and still gear it toward biological
questions," Eisen said.
The difference between a core
and three unconnected courses,
he added, is the sense of cohe
sion. "By trying to make it a
cohesive thing with a few specific
rules as to what gets covered, the
hope is that it will be better,"
Eisen said.
Junior Vu Luu, a science,
technology and society major on
the committee, said he hopes stu
dents will have ample room for
input on the tracks so they will
be satisfied with the results.
But "the most important
thing at this point is just to teach
science in a way that actively
engages non-science students
and to convey the methods and

processes of thinking [about sci
ence]," he said.
Luu said he hopes the role of
science in society will also be
included in the final curriculum,
as it might be "more relevant to
non-science students. Those are
the type of issues they will be
thinking about," he said.
Eisen agreed that discussion
of that role, as well as the basic
tenets of science in the course,
would be an asset to all students.
"Many [Stanfordl students
are going to go into a field in
which a scientific background
will be important, even if it's not
science," Eisen said.
In fields such as law, business
and government "so much of it
involves analysis or interpreta
tion and the use of scientific
data," he said. "We want to make
sure these people would have a
good background and be comfort
able doing this stuff on their
own.
"We want people to be able to
have a fundamental background
in science coming out of Stan
ford," Eisen added. "It doesn't
mean we want to teach them
every nitty-gritty detail."
