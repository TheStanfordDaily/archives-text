# Group solicits ideas for new science core
## Current proposal contains several tracks; committee wants faculty input, involvement 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
A committee charged with designing the
new three-quarter science distribution re
quirement is asking science, mathematics
and engineering faculty to submit propos
als for core tracks encompassing certain
common topics.
At meetings today and tomorrow, the
Mathematics-Science-Engineering Core
committee will formally present its propos
al and meet with faculty interested in de
signing and teaching tracks within the pro
posed new core.
The Commission on Undergraduate Ed
ucation recommended a science core in its
report last October. The core, if put into op
eration, would replace current distribution
requirements 4, 5 and 6 (mathematical sci
ences, natural sciences, and technology and
applied sciences).
As proposed, the core would contain sev-

eral tracks covering simi
lar topics with different
foci in a manner similar to
the Cultures, Ideas and
Values core.
"We think it should not
be a single course but a
general program which
has many tracks," said
Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood, the committee

chair and a member of the commission.
"We want there to be certain common fea
tures across all the tracks."
The request for proposals outlines sev
eral areas each core track would cover, in
cluding concepts of science, engineering,
math and laboratory work.
Concepts common to all science core
tracks might include science as a structure
of testable hypotheses, the character of
