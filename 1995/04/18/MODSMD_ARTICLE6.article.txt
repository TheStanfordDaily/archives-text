# Violence in workplace policy near completion
## 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
A draft of a Stanford University policy
on violence in the workplace is in its final
stages and, if approved, will be officially
published in June.
"One of the purposes of the policy was to
give guidance to people when they are
faced with the incidence of violence in the
workplace," said Asst. Vice President for
Personnel Tina Kass.
According to Employee Relations Spe
cialist Doug Dupen, the interest in forming
a policy stemmed from several incidents
where violence had occurred in the work
place. Although these incidents were han
dled ad hoc, the University thought it

would be wise to have a referenceable poli
cy on the issue, he added.
A committee was formed in fall quarter
of 1994 to address the issue and work out a
policy for the University. This committee
consisted of members from diverse areas of
the Stanford community, including Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington, Di
rector of Counseling and Psychological
Services Alejandro Martinez and School of
Medicine Manager of Employee Relations
Corileen Bossenberry. The committee re
cently completed a preliminary draft of the
policy.
The draft states that all University em
ployees — including faculty, staff and some
students — have a right to a safe
environment free from violence or
threats of violence.
Anyone who violates this policy
will be subject to disciplinary
action up to and including termi
nation. The policy applies not
only to employees, but also to peo
ple contracted to work for Stan
ford.
The draft defines workplace
violence as follows: "Acts of vio
lence include any physical action,
whether intentional or reckless,
that harms or threatens the safe
ty of another individual in the
workplace."
The draft also addresses
threats of violence in the work
place, defining it as including
"any behavior that by its very
nature could be interpreted by a
reasonable person as an intent to
cause physical harm to another
individual."
The preliminary policy offers
guidelines of what employees and
supervisors can do and whom
they can contact in the case of
violence, outlining procedures
and resources such as employee
Help Center counselors, staff
affairs officers, employee rela
tions representatives and the
police.
People who are faced with
workplace violence on campus
"aren't sure what to do," Kass
said. "We have resources such as
the police or employee relations

(personnel) who are equipped to
deal with this problem. This poli
cy makes it clear what they can
do."
She added that the policy
shows that the University will
not accept violence on campus.
"We want to make it very clear
that if this kind of thing comes
up we won't tolerate it," Kass
said.
Lee Lyon, director of person
nel at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center, who actively par
ticipated in the committee's
drafting of the document, added
that the policy affects not only
those who are affected by vio
lence in the workplace, but also
those who observe incidents of it
and might not be sure what
action to take.
The policy went through a
number of committees and in
each case some small changes and
corrections were made, Dupen
said. According to Kass, the draft
now needs to be officially
approved by the University Cabi
net, which next meets May 18.
Lyon added that after the poli
cy is put into place, training
should be instituted for supervi
sors and managers. "This is
beyond the policy," Lyon said.
"Training sessions will be made
available and I suspect we will
deliver brochures."
The policy should be printed in
June in the Administrative
Guide, a manual of the Universi
ty's administrative policy which
is published once a quarter and is
also available electronically on
Folio.
