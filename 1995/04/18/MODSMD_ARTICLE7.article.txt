# Activist LaDuke draws distinctions between industrial, indigenous
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth 
Native American environmen
talist Winona LaDuke stressed
the difference between indige
nous thinking and industrial
thinking — comparing the two to
prey and predator — during a
speech last night in front of about
70 audience members at Cubber
ley Auditorium.
A Native American of the
Chippewa tribe, LaDuke — the
keynote speaker for Women's
Hers to ry month — is the director
of the White Earth Land project
in Minnesota and president of the
Indigenous Women's Network.
LaDuke both introduced her
self and finished her talk in her
native language.
"It is always an honor to speak
to young people," said LaDuke,
adding that she was initially in
spired by her own disagreement
with a speaker who explained that
there was no "Indian problem"
but that the problem lay with the
United States.
LaDuke explained that to un

derstand indigenous thinking,
one must see that the concept of
natural law is "pre-eminent in
spiritual knowledge and tradi
tional ecological knowledge."
Because spiritual and ecologi
cal knowledge is accrued over
time and sustained through
lifestyle, LaDuke said, only in
digenous people can possess it.
According to LaDuke, another
aspect of indigenous thinking is
the recognition of "nations,"
which she defined as "a group of
people sharing a culture, history
and language" as opposed to
"states," which are based only on
shared government.
LaDuke said people can only
sustain societies by using indige
nous thinking. Industrial think
ing, which is created through
man's domination of nature, con
flicts with it.
LaDuke said the loss of indige
nous thinking is especially clear in
the changes in language.
"Words like 'corn' and 'wheat'
