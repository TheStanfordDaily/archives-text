# Activist LaDuke draws distinctions between industrial, indigenous
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth 
Native American environmen
talist Winona LaDuke stressed
the difference between indige
nous thinking and industrial
thinking — comparing the two to
prey and predator — during a
speech last night in front of about
70 audience members at Cubber
ley Auditorium.
A Native American of the
Chippewa tribe, LaDuke — the
keynote speaker for Women's
Hers to ry month — is the director
of the White Earth Land project
in Minnesota and president of the
Indigenous Women's Network.
LaDuke both introduced her
self and finished her talk in her
native language.
"It is always an honor to speak
to young people," said LaDuke,
adding that she was initially in
spired by her own disagreement
with a speaker who explained that
there was no "Indian problem"
but that the problem lay with the
United States.
LaDuke explained that to un

derstand indigenous thinking,
one must see that the concept of
natural law is "pre-eminent in
spiritual knowledge and tradi
tional ecological knowledge."
Because spiritual and ecologi
cal knowledge is accrued over
time and sustained through
lifestyle, LaDuke said, only in
digenous people can possess it.
According to LaDuke, another
aspect of indigenous thinking is
the recognition of "nations,"
which she defined as "a group of
people sharing a culture, history
and language" as opposed to
"states," which are based only on
shared government.
LaDuke said people can only
sustain societies by using indige
nous thinking. Industrial think
ing, which is created through
man's domination of nature, con
flicts with it.
LaDuke said the loss of indige
nous thinking is especially clear in
the changes in language.

have become 'agricultural prod
ucts,' " she said. "Where Native
Americans would call a coal mine
the 'lungs of mother earth,' a min
ing company would describe it by
its price value."
Capitalism also represents an
aspect of industrial thinking,
LaDuke said. She explained that
the capitalistic theory of "taking as
much as you can get demonstrates
society's greedy nature" and is the
opposite of "reciprocity and
give / take relationships, which are
the way things should be done. It is
disrespectful to take more.
"People should recognize the
continuation of colonialism as
manifest in the holocaust of both
people and species," she said. "At
least 2,000 indigenous nations
have been exterminated in the last

500 years, and one nation per year
disappears even today in the Ama
zon forest.
"The mythology of America has
hidden this holocaust, however,"
LiDuke added. "The mythology is
that the Indians just disappeared as
the Europeans moved west. If there
is no victim, there is no crime."
LaDuke said the mythology
surrounding indigenous people
needed to be "debunked" through
better understanding of the strug
gle between cultural nations and
governmental states.
By "painting images" though
informal stories, LaDuke illustrat
ed the struggle of Native Ameri
cans against the government. She
argued that only natural societies
can survive.
"There is great deal of courage
in Indian country," LaDuke said.
"We have to prove that our intel
lectual, political, economical and
scientific forms of knowledge are
valid in an academic setting."
