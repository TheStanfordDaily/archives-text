# List of postal grievances ranks late mail first
## 
### Valerie Hsieh 
In a recent survey on Stanford's postal ser
vice, students, faculty and staff have ranked
the late delivery of mail as their top complaint.
The 138 respondents then listed their other
concerns in order of importance: crowded
postal line; inadequate staffing at key times of
the day; limited hours for parcel pickup; non
receipt of important documents; limited times
to pick up Express mail; unstocked or out-of

order vending machines; misdelivered mail not
reaching the rightful owner and damage to
packages.
The survey — which was distributed in late
March — was conducted by ASSU Deputy Sen
ate Chair Michael Choo and several other stu
dent leaders. According to Choo, surveys were
sent to most residences on campus and were
also handed out in White Plaza for three days.
The purpose of the survey was to pinpoint
specific problems with Stanford's postal ser

vice.
"I think that everyone recognizes that we
have a problem," Choo said. "It's a matter of
recognizing specific problems and how we're
going to address them."
Choo added that students now have a
"unique opportunity" to improve postal ser
vice because the post office's lease is up for
renegotiation for the first time in 35 years. "We
need to demand better services at
this time when we have the
chance," Choo said.
However, according to offi
cials at the Stanford Manage
ment Company, which is negoti
ating the post office lease, the
survey's results will not have
any direct impact on the lease
negotiations.
The post office, which runs as
a branch of the Palo Alto postal
system, currently operates
under monthly leases, pending a
long-term contract. Its prior
lease expired in February.
The lease negotiation is "a
very complicated process," said
Leonie Batkin, manager of lands
management for the Stanford
Management Company.
"The problem is because the
post office is run in a very
bureaucratic way by the govern
ment," she said.
In its negotiation of the
lease, the Stanford Manage
ment Company is working with
the post office's real estate
department. This is completely
separate from the post office's
operations department, which
would deal with concerns such
as those brought up in the sur
vey.

Batkin said that members of
a student committee have been
discussing service complaints
and suggestions with Palo Alto
Postmaster Masayuki Sato and
with representatives of the
Stanford Management Compa
ny.
The student committee —
headed by Choo and Council of
Presidents member Anietie
Ekanem — has also looked into
alternate ways to run the post
office, including making the post
office an ASSU business project
or installing a private mail oper
ation in Tresidder.
Choo said that committee
members are also researching
ways that mail delivery is han
dled at other schools. Stanford is
one of only a few university cam
puses in the nation that has an
on-campus U.S. post office
branch.
Batkin acknowledged that
there have been discussions
about alternatives, but said that
she cannot disclose any informa
tion about those at this time.
A working group comprised of
Batkin, Choo, Ekanem and
Stanford Management Compa
ny's Executive Vice President of
Real Estate Curtis Eeeny plans
to create a proposal by the end
of the school year, Choo said.
The proposal will then go to the
University administration for
feedback.
