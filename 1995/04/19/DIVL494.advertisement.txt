VOTE IN THE SPECIAL FEE ELECTION!
•$2.67 worth?*
KZSU, your Stanford radio station, is ask
ing you for money again. We want you to
vote yes on KZSU's fee assessment in this
week's elections. If our fee is approved,
each student will pay a (refundable) fee of
$8.28 next year ($2.76 a quarter). If our
fee is not approved, you probably won't
have a radio station next year.
•What can you get for $2.76 these days?*
At better fast-food joints, that'll get you a
small cheeseburger and fries. At KZSU,
that'll get you Stanford Football, the Dalai
Lama, Stanford Women's Basketball, Pres
ident Casper, Stanford Men's Basketball,
world music, Stanford Women's Volley
ball, rock music, Stanford Men's Volley
ball, jazz, Stanford Baseball,
hip-hop music, news, local bands, and, just
incidentally, a chance to learn to be a disc
jockey, news reporter, sportscaster. It will
also get you a station that has spent years
getting ready for the next disaster, so
you'll have news and emergency
information before, during, and after any
emergency.

VOTE YES FOR KZSU.
•All we're asking for is $8.28 next year.*
We honestly think it's a bargain.
In 1989, KZSU stayed on the air during
the quake when many big-time stations
went down; we're better prepared now than
we were then. Although the cost of emer
gency preparedness items (such as the
backup generator) is not paid by your fee
assessment, these items are useless if there
isn't a KZSU to use them.
•Does KZSU have too big a budget?"
KZSU is very similar to The Stanford
Daily in the size of its staff and the scope
of its operations, except that KZSU
operates 365 days a year. Yet KZSU oper
ates on a budget one-tenth the size of The
Daily's. How can The Daily spend a
million dollars more a year than KZSU,
then turn around and say we ask for too
much money? Sure, we are asking for a
larger fee, but we can't sell ads, and The
Daily can. And yes, The Daily has printing
costs, which are higher than KZSU's
broadcasting equipment costs. But if you
split out their printing costs, their budget is
still $670,000, nearly six times KZSU's.
The Daily spends, in the editorial depart
ment alone, $97,000 on salaries. Their total
budget for salaries and related costs is
$461,000 — four times KZSU's entire
budget.
