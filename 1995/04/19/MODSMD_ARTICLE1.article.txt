# Preferential system put to the test as election begins
## Partisan politics permeate COP election panel debate 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Amid an atmosphere
of fierce partisanship,
three Council of Presi
dents slates — The "Very
Serious Clowns," "We
Deserve Better" and
"Let's Be Candid" -
each tried to convince
students to vote for them

in a debate last night in Cedro Lounge.
The debate was moderated by Cedro Resi
dent Assistant Brad Vynalek and attracted ap
proximately 30 people — most of whom be
longed to the People's Platform or the Stu
dents' Alliance parties.
Justifying their campaign by saying that if
Ronald Reagan can get elected, they can too, the
Clowns — sponsored by the Hammer and Cof
fin party — said they would create a "Clown
tract with Stanford."
The Clowns slate consists of juniors Sean
Kennedy and Scott Gagner and sophomores
Eric Saxon and Chris Onstad.
The Clowns also promised a "wiener" car to
ferry injured students between classes and a
three-mile high marshmallow to provide trans
portation for all others.
In contrast, "We Deserve Better" — spon
sored by the People's Platform — promised "to
fight for the students," said slate member
Michael Choo, a junior.
This slate includes Choo, fellow juniors Rich
Stolz and Nicole Vazquez and coterminal stu
dent Jon Oram.
"We have the experience to deal with issues,"
Oram said. "Check our records. We will be
proactive."
The slate said it would produce a graduate
student needs assessment survey, empower
students and address financial aid issues.
Freely admitting their limitations, the
"Let's Be Candid" slate — sponsored by Stu

dents' Alliance — said it is the best choice be
cause it will finish what it undertakes, said slate
member Tom Baranowski, a senior.
The Candid slate consists of Baranowski,
law student Curtis Kin and juniors Michelle
Gee and Rachel Hall.
The slate said it will produce a student
coursebook, create a graduate student hand
book, clarify the legal relationship between the
ASSU and the University and enact the four
parts of the Student Rights Initiative — the
creation of a judicial branch, the protection of
the right to special-fee refunds, a strengthened

freedom of information act and an easier
process for putting referenda on the ballot,
Baranowski added.
All three slates recognized the problem of
student apathy but their strategies of dealing
with the issue varied.
"Student apathy is one of the reasons we are
running," Kennedy said. "We will infuse the
system with fun and more students will become
active."
The Clowns will use their salaries as COP

members to "have more Chap
pies, more parties, and more
pranks," Onstad said.
"We Deserve Better," howev
er, will try to create more initia
tives like Bus Back the Axe — a
plan which bused 850 students to
Big Game last fall, Choo said.
"Student apathy stems from

the fact that the ASSU is not
accountable to the students,"
Hall said.
Apathy may also arise from the
reluctance of students to approach
COP members, Gee said. If elect
ed, her slate will have weekly
office hours in the Coffee House.
"In the social atmosphere of
the Coffee House, students can
approach us as students, not as
COP members," Gee said. The
debate was co-sponsored by
Cedro and The Stanford Daily.
