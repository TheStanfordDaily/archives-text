Haitian suspect arrested
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haitian police
have arrested a second suspect in the machine-gun
slaying of far-right opposition leader Mireille
Durocher Bert in, the U.N. military mission said yes
terday.
Gerald Benius, 31, was arrested Monday and is
being interrogated by police and the FBI in connec
tion wit h the March 28 attack, U.N. spokesman Eric
Fait told a news conference.
Members of the U.N. force in Haiti helped
I laitian police arrest Benius, who is being held at the
Petionville police station, Fait said.
Bertin, 35, was a lawyer and top aide to coup lead
ers who overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aris
tide in 1991. She was one of Aristide's most vehe
ment opponents, criticizing him and the U.S. inter
vention that returned him to power in October.
Her assassination, two days before President
Clinton visited Haiti, embarrassed both the U.S.
and Haitian governments.
The first suspect, Claudy Lacroix, was arrested
Friday at his home near the scene of the crime.
U.S. officials have admitted getting information
10 days before Bertin was killed about a plot against
her life.
Brown dwarf stars exist
WASHINGTON (AP) — Researchers using
starlight bent by gravity to probe the halo of the
Milkv Way galaxy say that failed stars called

"brown dwarfs" may make up 20 percent of the
dark, unseen matter in the galaxy.
Kem Cook of the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory said yesterday that a survey of 8 million
background stars over a 400-day period detected
four instances where starlight was bent by the
effect of gravity as it streaked toward the Earth.
Cook said a telescope scanning the heavens
detected what are called lensing events. These
occur when starlight, coming from background
stars much farther out in space, is bent by gravity
as it streaks past celestial bodies closer to the Earth.
This bent light gives a specific instrumental signa
ture that allows astronomers to determine the size
of the celestial bodies causing the lensing.
Cook said the four lensing events detected by his
team were caused by brown dwarfs — starlike
objects that are about 4 percent of the size of the
sun. He said such bodies may account for about 20
percent of the cold, dark matter thought to sur
round the Milky Way.
Brown dwarfs are thought to be spheres of gas
and dust that did not become large enough to ignite
internal nuclear fires of even a small star.
Existence of the unseen matter is based on cal
culations of how much mass the galaxy should con
tain for its billions of stars to move in the way that
has been observed. Astronomers believe there is not
enough lighted, visible matter to account for all of
the mass in the galaxy. The mass which is not seen
must be chilled and without light, and so
astronomers call it cold, dark matter.
