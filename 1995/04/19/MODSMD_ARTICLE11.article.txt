ALEXANDER CITY, Ala. (AP)
â€” Investigators recovered the
black box recorders yesterday
from the wreckage of a military
jet that crashed in flames, killing
eight people, including an assis
tant Air Force secretary and a
two-star general.
The C-21, an Air Force version
of the Learjet, went down in a
residential neighborhood Mon
day evening about four miles
short of the Alexander City air
port.
"It was making an awful
noise," said Minnie Blair, who
was walking her 7-month-old
grandson when the jet roared

into view. "I told my grandson,
'Bud, this thing is going to hit
us.' "
"He must have been a really
good pilot to have kept it away
from the houses," Blair said.
The passenger jet, with two
crew members and six passen
gers, had left Andrews Air Force
Base in Maryland for Randolph
Air Force Base in San Antonio.
The crew reported "fuel man
agement" concerns and the plane
was diverted to Maxwell Air
Force Base in Montgomery, some
50 miles from Alexander City, a
senior Defense Department offi
cial in Washington said. After

that, it is possible that further
problems occurred and they
decided to try for a closer airstrip
at the Alexander City airport,
said the official, who asked not to
be identified. He did not elabo
rate, but said the pilot asked for
permission to dump part of the
plane's fuel load.
Identification of what exactly
went wrong must await comple
tion of the crash investigation, he
said.
The plane's cockpit voice and
flight data recorders were recov
ered from the wreckage. An Air
Force board was formed to inves
tigate the cause of the crash.
