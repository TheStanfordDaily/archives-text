WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton, taking advantage of a
congressional recess to refocus
attention on his presidency, said
last night that he is satisfied he
remains relevant in a Republican
dominated capital.
He challenged Congress to send
him an acceptable welfare bill by
July 4. "I am willing to work with
Republicans. The question is, are
they willing to work with me," Clin
ton told a prime-time news confer
ence shunned by two of the three
major television broadcast net
works.
The president was forced into
the shadows during the Republi
cans' 100-day march. With
Congress out of town and out of the
headlines, Clinton held his first
evening press conference since
Republicans seized power in
November.
For the first time, Clinton
showed some interest in an idea
promoted mostly by Republicans —
abandoning the complex graduated
income tax system and replacing it
with a flat tax of a fixed percentage,

such as seven or 20 percent.
"If we can do it I'm open to it,
but the studies are not promising
on the proposals that are out
there now," he said. He suggested
that a flat tax — first brought to
national attention by Democratic
presidential contender Jerry
Brown in 1992 — could raise taxes
for those under $200,000 while
lowering them for the very
wealthy.
However, Clinton noted that,
having just completed his own
income taxes, the flat tax "has more
appeal than it did a week ago. Many
Americans feel that way."
It was only the fourth prime
time news conference of Clinton's
27-month presidency. Still, of the
"Big Three" broadcast networks, it
was carried live only by CBS,
which also aired House Speaker
Newt Gingrich's address to the
nation earlier this month. The
news conference also was carried
live by cable networks CNN and C
SPAN.
The president opened his 36-
minute news conference with a

seven-minute summary of what
has become his stock stump speech,
highlighting the need for Congress
to put aside partisanship and do
what is right for the country.
He announced he was granting
Montana and Missouri waivers
from federal rules to give them
more flexibility in adopting welfare
programs of their own. That brings
to 27 the number of states with
such waivers.
He also challenged Congress to
complete work on welfare reform
by July 4, so the nation could cele
brate Independence Day by giving
people on welfare "the opportunity,
the responsibility, to move to inde
pendence."
Clinton has proposed a measure
that would require people to return
to work within two years to keep
receiving welfare benefits and
which would provide vouchers for
job retraining.
He criticized the GOP-spon
sored bill as "too weak and too
tough on children." It would deny
welfare benefits to teenager moth
ers.
