# US-Japan trade talks falter
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Two days of high-level
talks aimed at lowering Japanese barriers to U.S.
cars and car parts ended yesterday with no signs of
progress.
Clinton administration officials, in carefully cho
sen words, refused to say whether the absence of any
breakthrough means the United States is any closer
to carrying out a threat to impose stiff tariffs on
Japanese products.
"We have made very little progress," said Com
merce Undersecretary Jeffrey Garten. "There have
been no breakthroughs. We have a very long way to
go."
Private economists said the rise in the yen's value
and the dollar's slide could increase pressure on
Japan to open its markets to more foreign products
and help reduce its huge trade surplus. But analysts
said they doubt the Japanese government is at the
point of exposing its auto industry to more competi
tion.
Japanese officials said they were disappointed in
the lack of progress but promised to continue the
talks at a lower level among staff experts. They

blamed the United States for the deadlock, accusing
the Clinton administration of insisting on numerical
quotas for U.S. exports to Japan.
"We remain optimistic that an agreement with
the US on auto issues is possible in the near future,
provided the U.S. side doesn't insist on a de facto
numerical target," the Japanese said in a statement.
But Ira Shapiro, counsel to U.S. Trade Represen
tative Mickey Kantor, said the Japanese were block
ing progress by defending burdensome regulations
designed to prevent real competition.
He said "the Japanese government continued to
pour cold water" on a U.S. proposal to renew a 1992
plan in which Japanese auto-makers agreed to buy
more imported parts.
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, in an interview
with CNBC, said the administration hopes to avoid a
breakdown in the talks but will not retreat in its
demands.
The administration is threatening to impose
harsh tariffs against more than $1 billion in
Japanese imports if there is no progress in the auto
trade talks.
