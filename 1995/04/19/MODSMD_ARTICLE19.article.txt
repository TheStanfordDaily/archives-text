## ASSU politics are a joke 
### 
THE CURRENT ELECTION for the
Council of Presidents and the
ASSU Senate are a farce. The stu
dents who are running for office and the
voters who will elect them are participat
ing in a meaningless and hollow election
process in which nobody but the candi
dates themselves cares who wins.
Last Wednesday I woke up to find the
Stanford campus transformed. The
rooms and buildings that I know so well
had been invaded by hundreds of colorful
sheets of paper — election flyers. From
my first trip into the bathroom to my
walk through White Plaza I was bom
barded by cute pictures and slogans on all
sides. There was no escape.
My dorm is a perfect example of this
phenomenon. The halls and bathrooms
of Roble Hall usually have the normal
number of flyers for fraternity parties
and group meetings posted in them. A
decent amount of paper but nothing out
of the ordinary. However, as of Sunday
night, there was an average of seven cam
paign flyers in each stall of my bathroom.
The bulletin boards in the halls were
dripping with them, and it was literally
impossible to see through the glass doors
leading out of the lounge. The fact that
fraternity rush is happening concurrent
ly only compounded the situation.
Not only are these flyers a waste of
time, money and trees, they tell me abso
lutely nothing about the candidate who
posted them. If any candidate or slate has
a coherent platform or a list of goals, I

have yet to see it.
The aim of a senate campaign at this
school is not to inform the voting public
on the issues with which a candidate is
concerned, but rather to come up with
the catchiest slogan or funniest graphic
on flyers and signs. There appears to be
two methods to this form of campaigning.
In the first, the candidate attempts to
find a slogan which will rhyme — at least
somewhat — with his or her name. For
example, "Vote for Breen, she's a
dream!" In the second method, the candi
dates or slates work their names into a
popular advertising campaign or the title
of a television show.
I'm glad the candidates have been able
to come up with slogans that are more
interesting than the one I just created,
but they have given me absolutely no
information about themselves with
which I can make an informed decision.
Are they concerned with rising tuition
rates or threats to financial aid? Are they
interested in changing the relationship
that the Stanford post office has with the
University? If they are, they have not
told me.
Many candidates and slates try get
around sticky issues such as these by
affiliating themselves with a political
party. The two most common appear to
be the People's Platform and the Stu
dents' Alliance. From what I remember
reading in past Daily articles, the latter
grew out of a dispute between certain
senators earlier this year. Besides that

fact, I can think of no other characteris
tics which distinguish one party from the
other, and I highly doubt that any stu
dent who was not present that this year's
senate meetings could explain the differ
ences to me. The ASSU Senate is not
exactly on a par with the United States
Congress, and campus political parties
have almost no meaning to the students
who are voting this week.
It is clear that the political process at
Stanford needs major reform. One impor
tant change could be to limit the number
of candidates who are running for office,
or at least to limit the amount of publici
ty they can distribute. The main reason
that these campaigns are so laughable is
that the candidates feel that name recog
nition is the only way to distinguish
themselves from the other names on the
ballot.
As for the winners of this year's elec
tion, don't delude yourselves into think
ing you were elected on any significant
issues. Be satisfied with the fact that you
came up with a catchy slogan, and hope
that maybe next year's campaign will
center around issues that people actually
care about. But don't count on it.

Amanda's editors prefer this slogan:
"Vote for Breen because she's not green."
