# Elders talks responsibility
## Former US surgeon general also defends masturbation 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
In order to keep the country from self-destructing,
citizens and politicians must work to educate Ameri
cans about health and social responsibility, former
U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders said in a
speech last night.
Speaking before a crowd of 1,300 in Memorial Au
ditorium, Elders called on Americans to follow her
"prescription for an ailing society," which focuses on
education, an end to unwanted pregnancies and uni
versal access to health care.
"We've got a health-illiterate society," Elders said.
Children need to be prepared to begin school, and
when they do, they should start their health educa
tion immediately and continue it until graduation,
she said.
That condoms should be distributed to kinder
garten students and the process of masturbation
taught in school are some of the many inaccurate con
clusions made about her views, Elders said.
"I said we needed comprehensive health education
for all our children starting in kindergarten," she
said. "We need to teach children what they need to
know to make good decisions and know when to say
no.
"How can we tell children to say no without telling
them what to say yes to?" she asked to applause.
When she made a comment that students should

be educated about masturbation,
"that got interpreted as we should
teach children how to mastur
bate," she said. "First of all, you
don't need to be taught."
Parents and teachers should
educate children rather than keep
information from them, Elders
said. This is the only way to main
tain the United States' position as
a world leader, she said
"A society that refuses to take
care of its children is doomed to
failure," she said.
An essential part of health edu
cation for older students is AIDS
education, Elders said, because
without a cure or vaccine, "we
know that's all we've got: educa
tion, education, education.
"If we had decided to show as
much on HIV as we've shown on
O.J. Simpson, just think of the
education level on HIV," she
said.
A healthy society also allows
women to "have control of their
own bodies," she said. "I've
never been about abortion. I've
been about preventing unwant
ed, unplanned pregnancies. I've
never known anyone to need an
abortion who's not pregnant."
The Un ited States currently
spends less than 1 pcrcent of its
budget on "keeping people
healthy," Elders said. More
funding should go to education
and programs, especially for
American children, who Elders
said are getting poorer and poor
er.
"We feel that we're going to
balance the budget on the backs
of hungry children," Elders said.
"I'm very concerned about what's
happening to bright people in our
country."
Elders added that a country
that supports defense spending

over health and education cannot
succeed.
"If we're going to be ignorant
and sick, we're going to self
destruct from the inside," she
said. "Then what do we need a
Department of Defense for to pro
tect us from the outside?"
Health education would fur
ther ease budgetary problems by
keeping violence and drug use
down and prisons emptier, Elders
said.
It costs $92,000 to incarcerate
a criminal for a year in a Califor
nia prison, she noted.
The problems states face are
further illustrated by the prison
and parole rate in California,
which is currently 30 percent for
black males under 45 years old,
she said. For the same group, only
18 percent are enrolled in univer
sities.
"We've got to offer bright
young people hope," she said.
"It's cheaper to send them to
Stanford than to send them to
prison in California."
Furthermore, she said, "we
must focus on preventing these
problems rather than correcting
them."
Students today leave school
with "shoes that light up when
they walk and brains that shut
down when they talk," she said.
Elders said she couldn't pre
dict what changes in health care
the country will make next,
although she predicted that the
government will make moves to
provide a broad social program for
women and children in the next
few years.
Much of the change will rely on
individuals, too, she said.
"You've got to each reach out
and be responsible," she said,
"and say 'I will be responsible
even if no one is responsible but
me.

Stanford-in-Government and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
