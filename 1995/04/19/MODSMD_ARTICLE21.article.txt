KZSU non-endorsement
contained leaps of logic
The Daily's non-endorsement of KZSU
contains several errors of fact, some
strange leaps of logic and some just plain
absurdities. After reading it, we wonder if
the Daily folks even listened to what we
had to say when we met with them.
You say that "nearly $15,000 goes to
support the 'news' department," mostly
for AP wira service. Actually, KZSU's AP
wire costs about $10,000 and the entire
news budget is $11,600, as shown in the
Election Handbook. This is comparable to
the $15,000 The Daily spends on news
services. You then go on to suggest that a
subscription to the Chronicle would be
cheaper. It would indeed be cheaper, but
what sort of "radio news" would it be to
read yesterday's papers over the air?
KZSU needs AP news for the same rea
sons the Daily does: to get news promptly
from primary sources. And, like The
Daily, we are bound by copyright laws
and cannot just take stories from copy
righted sources and use them on the air.
And, in an emergency, what good is yes
terday's Chronicle? Or, for that matter,
today's Daily?
Why do you put "news" in quotes? Is
AP news on KZSU somehow less real
than AP news in The Daily?
You say that emergency preparedness
is important, but that the University
should pay for it. As we explained at our

meeting, the University does pay for
emergency preparedness. The standby
generator, the new transmitter building,
cabling to the Emergency Operations
Center, etc., were paid for by special Uni
versity funds. It's worth adding that they
were also made possible by a great deal
of volunteer labor from the KZSU staff.
But, these preparations are of no use
unless there is a radio station there to
use them. If KZSU isn't on the air dur
ing normal times, it won't be on the air
after the earthquake either.
We're curious about the logic of say
ing "it's worthwhile, but the University
should fund it." If the University wants
to spend more money, the only way they
can arbitrarily raise their income is to
raise tuition. Students still pay for it,
they just don't get to vote on it, or
refund it if they disapprove.
The fact is, KZSU is very similar to
The Stanford Daily in the size of its
staff and the scope of its operations,
except that KZSU operates 365 days a
year. Yet KZSU operates on a budget
one-tenth the size of The Daily's. How
can The Daily spend a million dollars
more a year than KZSU, then turn
around and say we ask for too much
money? Sure, we are asking for a larger
fee, but we can't sell ads, and The
Daily can. And yes, The Daily has
printing costs, which are higher than
KZSU's broadcast equipment costs.
But it's still worth comparing KZSU's
budget and The Daily's. KZSU spends
$17,000 on salaries, part of which is

reimbursed. The Daily's total budget
for salaries and related costs is
$461,000 — four times KZSU's entire
budget.
Since you like to make glib sugges
tions to student organizations on how to
cut costs, let me make one for you: If
your staff worked for free, like nearly all
of KZSU's staff does, you could save
$461,000 a year. This would allow you to
eliminate your special-fee request, and
have enough left over to support KZSU
and all other student media, both elec
tronic and print, that are on the special
fee ballot.

MEChA benefits entire
Stanford community
The Daily's decision to leave the
MEChA special fee request without rec
ommendation unfortunately provides a
very skewed and narrow view of the
many aspects of the Chicano / Latino
community and the University as a
whole which benefit from the MEChA
special fee. In a conscientious attempt to
trim our budget, we removed all food
costs, streamlined our event costs and
were still able to add new and diverse
programming at a lower fee request than
in past years. However, as a result of the

ASSU-requested format, we were not
able to itemize the $19,000 which we
will fundraise. The Daily instead chose
to focus on the two most expensive
events supported by the special fee, the
Ballet Folklorico concert and the Cesar
Chavez commemoration, while com
pletely underestimating both the dollar
values of and true rewards from the
events.
Although The Daily deemed the
money spent on the Ballet Folklorico
Concert and the C6sar Chavez Com
memoration excessive, it failed to recog
nize what the programs consist of and
how many people benefit from these
events. In fact, the Cesar Chavez com
memoration attracts participants from
various parts of the Stanford community
as well as all over California and beyond.
This year's event drew a full house of
over 700 people, over half of whom were
Stanford students. We are requesting
only half of the actual cost of the pro
gram for next year.
El Concierto de la Primavera, Ballet
Folkldrico's spring concert, was also
cited as too expensive for The Daily's
standards. Once again, however, The
Daily neglected to mention that the
Concierto de la Primavera actually costs
over $10,000 and for next year we are
requesting less than half of that amount.
For this minimal amount, Ballet Folk
lorico will run two shows on Memorial
Day weekend, as it has for many years,
and will give an additional performance
at a reduced price for local elementary

school children. These shows have con
sistently filled Kresge Auditorium to
capacity.
In addition to the oversights about
the C6sar Chavez celebration and the
Ballet Folkl6rico concert, The Daily
made absolutely no mention of the many
other organizations which serve both the
Chicano / Latino and the entire Stanford
community. These organizations rely on
MEChA's support in addition to their
own fundraising and include Derechos,
Chicanos in Health Education, Stanford
Literacy Improvement Project, Ballet
Folkl6rico, Mujeres at Stanford, and the
Latino Student Association. By not vot
ing for MEChA's special fee, Stanford
students may potentially reject the Ade
lante Mujer Women's Conference, Liter
acy Week, Latino Culture Night and
many more events which depend on
MEChA's support.
We feel that MEChA has met the five
requirements of the Daily for the special
fee recommendation. In addition, the
events sponsored by the MEChA special
fee greatly contribute the Stanford com
munity. The Daily's recommendation
does not truly reflect the significance of
the special fee to the Chicano / Latino
and the Stanford community as a whole.

tions to student organizations on how to
cut costs, let me make one for you: If
your staff worked for free, like nearly all
of KZSU's staff does, you could save
$461,000 a year. This would allow you to
eliminate your special-fee request, and
have enough left over to support KZSU
and all other student media, both elec
tronic and print, that are on the special
fee ballot.

MEChA benefits entire
Stanford community
The Daily's decision to leave the
MEChA special fee request without rec
ommendation unfortunately provides a
very skewed and narrow view of the
many aspects of the Chicano / Latino
community and the University as a
whole which benefit from the MEChA
special fee. In a conscientious attempt to
trim our budget, we removed all food
costs, streamlined our event costs and
were still able to add new and diverse
programming at a lower fee request than
in past years. However, as a result of the

ASSU-requested format, we were not
able to itemize the $19,000 which we
will fundraise. The Daily instead chose
to focus on the two most expensive
events supported by the special fee, the
Ballet Folklorico concert and the Cesar
Chavez commemoration, while com
pletely underestimating both the dollar
values of and true rewards from the
events.
Although The Daily deemed the
money spent on the Ballet Folklorico
Concert and the C6sar Chavez Com
memoration excessive, it failed to recog
nize what the programs consist of and
how many people benefit from these
events. In fact, the Cesar Chavez com
memoration attracts participants from
various parts of the Stanford community
as well as all over California and beyond.
This year's event drew a full house of
over 700 people, over half of whom were
Stanford students. We are requesting
only half of the actual cost of the pro
gram for next year.
El Concierto de la Primavera, Ballet
Folkldrico's spring concert, was also
cited as too expensive for The Daily's
standards. Once again, however, The
Daily neglected to mention that the
Concierto de la Primavera actually costs
over $10,000 and for next year we are
requesting less than half of that amount.
For this minimal amount, Ballet Folk
lorico will run two shows on Memorial
Day weekend, as it has for many years,
and will give an additional performance
at a reduced price for local elementary

school children. These shows have con
sistently filled Kresge Auditorium to
capacity.
In addition to the oversights about
the C6sar Chavez celebration and the
Ballet Folkl6rico concert, The Daily
made absolutely no mention of the many
other organizations which serve both the
Chicano / Latino and the entire Stanford
community. These organizations rely on
MEChA's support in addition to their
own fundraising and include Derechos,
Chicanos in Health Education, Stanford
Literacy Improvement Project, Ballet
Folkl6rico, Mujeres at Stanford, and the
Latino Student Association. By not vot
ing for MEChA's special fee, Stanford
students may potentially reject the Ade
lante Mujer Women's Conference, Liter
acy Week, Latino Culture Night and
many more events which depend on
MEChA's support.
We feel that MEChA has met the five
requirements of the Daily for the special
fee recommendation. In addition, the
events sponsored by the MEChA special
fee greatly contribute the Stanford com
munity. The Daily's recommendation
does not truly reflect the significance of
the special fee to the Chicano / Latino
and the Stanford community as a whole.
