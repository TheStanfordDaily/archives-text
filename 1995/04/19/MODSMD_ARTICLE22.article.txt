# YCMAD meets Daily's criteria, deserves its fee
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily recommendation,
or lack thereof, on You Can Make A Dif
ference shows the inconsistencies and
inaccuracies of its self-proclaimed attempt
at making an informed special-fee
endorsement. It is obvious that though
the Editorial Board asked questions about
the group's goals, membership and out
side fund-raising efforts, it did not listen
to the responses. Following the Daily's
own guiding criteria, YCMAD is deserving
of students' special fees.
YCMAD annually provides the Stan
ford community with a conference whose
quality rivals that of professional confer
ences. Although YCMAD's special fees
were denied last year, it has ensured that
the conference day will remain free of
charge to Stanford students. Despite The
Daily's assertion that YCMAD is just a
one-time conference, the group has
engaged Stanford all-year round. During
the November elections, YCMAD provided
flyers explaining the positions of various
candidates on children's issues. It has also
raised awareness through its new bi-week
ly stall series as well as through various
service events throughout the year. It has
involved a wide range of students through
events co-sponsored by groups as varied
as SIG, SEAS, Hillel, SHAC and SVN.
YCMAD has provided the Stanford
community with many events throughout
the year. In addition to the actual confer
ence, YCMAD has planned a week of

events prior to the event. The conference,
prp-conference events, and activities
throughout the year are planned by vol
unteers; none of the YCMAD staff is
salaried, as misreported by The Daily. In
addition, all of the events are free to the
Stanford community.
YCMAD has raised over $3,000 this
past year in outside revenue from dorms,
departments, the university, and founda
tions.
Even The Daily has praised YCMAD
for its impressive financial improvements.
Besides significantly cutting its budget,
YCMAD has also responded to criticism,
from The Daily in fact, that the group
only plans a one-time event. Although
YCMAD has added on-going activities to
its focus, The Daily has neglected to recog
nize the change.
The Daily claims that YCMAD's ser
vice-oriented conference suggests that it
should possibly seek funding from the
Haas Center. The Haas Center does in
fact provide in-kind donations to YCMAD
in the form of services, such as an office
and a staff advisor. As an independent
student organization, YCMAD does not
receive direct funds from the Haas Cen
ter. YCMAD is not solely a service group;
it also acts to educate and inspire students
concerning real issues in our community.
The Daily has also claimed that
YCMAD continues to choose topics which
fail to raise significant student interest
(this year's conference focuses on chil
dren). The Daily seems to be misinformed
in this case about the support for chil
dren's issues on this campus. The confer
ence has received much support this year

from professors as well as from many stu
dent dorms and organizations.
