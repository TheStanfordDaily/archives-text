# Vote 'yes' for performing arts student organizations
## 
### 
Although The Daily recommended
seventeen groups for special fees yester
day, you endorsed only one of three per
forming arts groups' fees. Given your
criteria for recommendations, this is not
surprising, but as others have pointed
out in the national debate over NEA
funding, "value for the dollar" is a poor
criterion for the funding of arts organi
zations.
It was not so long ago that I stood in
a huge enthusiastic crowd of students,
alumni, and faculty in White Plaza,
holding signs saying "Save the Arts at
Stanford." In that year of massive bud
get cuts, we staved off the demolition of
the Drama department and the gutting
of the Music department. Nonetheless,
the budget cuts that were made weak
ened not only academically-sponsored
performing groups but also the resource
base for student groups. Of over 50 arts
organizations which took part in the
1992 "Arts Alliance," most of them stu
dent groups, fewer than half still exist
today, just three years later. Few new
groups have risen to take their place,
and many of the remaining groups are in

serious financial jeopardy.
It is unfortunate that student fees
must take up the burden of supporting
the arts at Stanford, but they must not
be allowed to fall by the wayside. Voters,
please vote YES for the Stanford Band,
Shooting Star Traveling Children's The
ater, and Stanford Jazz Orchestra this
spring election.
