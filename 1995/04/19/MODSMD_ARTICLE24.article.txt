# Barrio Assistance is one of most-supported groups

### 
We at Barrio Assistance are writing to
The Daily so that the Stanford commu
nity, as a whole, may understand the
importance both of our program and of
the Stanford community's participation
and support of it.
We hope the Stanford community
understands its continued pivotal role in
our program since we began in 1971. As
our 25th anniversary approaches, we
want to thank the Stanford community
for its tremendous support. Whether
participating as a tutor, helping in a
dorm-sponsored event, or voting for our
special fee, we are continuously over
whelmed by the level of interest and
support for Barrio Assistance. We have
consistently been one of the highest-sup
ported groups in the ASSU special-fee
election and one of the lowest-refunded
groups. This past fall, we were amazed
at the significant number of qualified
people who applied for tutoring posi-

tions. Obviously, the Stanford communi
ty recognizes the importance of pro
grams like ours in reaching out to
younger generations and directly illus
trating a deep commitment to the impor
tance of education.
Our special fee covers the cost of a
program that gives nearly 50 children
from East Palo Alto, Redwood City and
Menlo Park the opportunity to come to
Stanford every Saturday morning, eight
times a quarter, and have a warm break
fast, a one-on-one tutoring session with
a regular tutor and lots of fun. We have
a collection of books and games, as well
as all of the basic supplies for school
work. Throughout the year, we have
field trips, a Halloween Haunted House,
an overnight camping trip, a health fair,
a food drive and even a graduation cere
mony. Barrio Assistance also benefits
from outside funding, ranging from
grants for educational software to the
Provost's Fund for workbooks and
books. We have consistently worked to
minimize our costs and operate our pro
gram as efficiently and effectively as pos
sible while maximizing our resources to
create a fun and beneficial program.
We hope the Stanford community will
continue its tradition of supporting Bar
rio Assistance, as it has for more than
two decades. Barrio Assistance truly
illustrates our commitment at Stanford
to the importance of education and of
helping others.
