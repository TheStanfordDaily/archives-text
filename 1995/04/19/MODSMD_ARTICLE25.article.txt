# Creatively coloring Palo Alto
## Colors code parking spaces, aiming to free up parking 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
If you're driving into Palo Alto this
week, you may be reminded of a box of
Crayola crayons. But as of last Monday, you
should take the color of your parking space
seriously.
Aiming to make it easier for shoppers
and workers to find available parking, the
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce has creat
ed a new color-zone parking system in
which downtown spaces will be color-coded
coral, lime, blue and purple.

'Overall, I don't think it will
discourage people from
going there.'

Motorists must rotate their cars, as police
officers will ticket those found in one color
zone for more than two hours. The first
offense will cost $20 and the second and
third will cost $23. Three tickets can be
issued in one day and drivers must abide by
these regulations weekdays between 8 a.m.
and 5 p.m..

Henderson said she does not believe this
will be a big hassle for Stanford students
who shop, work or eat downtown. "It will be

okay," Henderson said. "Most students
walk in or bike or rollerblade. People who
come for the nightlife by car won't be affect
ed since this ends at 5 p.m."
Reaction among Stanford motorists has
been mixed. "In one aspect, it wouldn't be
very helpful," said junior Tami Jones. "If
you want to go somewhere all day, then you
should be able to park there.
"But, at the same time, it will free up
parking spaces," Jones added. "Overall, I
don't think it will discourage people from
going there."
Junior Takashi Terada, a self-pro
claimed movie buff, said he often drives into
Palo Alto to patronize Blockbuster Video
and the Stanford Theater.
"I haven't been there much during the
day but I know parking is bad," Terada
said. "I don't know how much this will help
but it's a step in the right direction."
Henderson said the response so far has
been "very positive." She said 1,300 spaces
exist in downtown Palo Alto and with the
new system, 10 or 15 are always available
— never the case before the new system
was implemented.
For the past four weeks, the city has
eased the new rules into effect. Police
tracked 54,000 cars parked downtown and
warned over 3,250 for violating the color
codes. Now, however, tickets instead of
warnings will be issued.
The new colorful downtown Palo Alto
experiment will exist for at least 11 months.
