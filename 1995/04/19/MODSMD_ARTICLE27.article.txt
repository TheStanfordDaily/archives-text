The "Stanford Five" — as Santa Clara County
Judge Eugene Hyman refers to the alleged burglars
who were arrested March 25 at the Stanford Art
Museum — have gone another court hearing with
out entering pleas.
Seniors Matthew Bengard and Jacob Kuramoto,
sophomores William Kutzkey and Alejandro Queza
da and 1994 graduate Jose Farias — all of whom are
affiliated with the Beta Theta Pi fraternity — cur
rently face felony burglaiy charges.
Kuramoto has also been charged with two misde
meanors: possession of burglary tools and posses
sion of a fixed blade knife on a university campus.
Attorney Edward Mahler, who is representing
Kuramoto, said after the hearing that he expects his
client to "probably" enter a "not guilty plea."
Farias, who is currently a resident of Minneapolis,
missed both hearings held at the Palo Alto Municipal
Court.
Police currently have a warrant for Farias' arrest.
His name has been entered into the National Crime
Information Computer, which means if Farias is
pulled over for any reason in any state he will be
immediately arrested.
The defendants' next court date is set for May 10
in Palo Alto.
Warrants have also been issued for the arrest of
four people who allegedly broke into the president's
office on March 17, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said. They will all be charged with misde
meanor trespassing, but Niemeyer said he could not
release their names yesterday afternoon, as the four
had not yet been arrested.
