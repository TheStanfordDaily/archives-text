Q:Why do people stick their tongue out when
they're concentrating?
— anonymous
A: Have you ever looked around during a final?
Between the people chewing on their pens, tap
ping their feet, ciying or drinking beer, the rest
probably have the tip of their tongue sticking out of
their mouth.
You may have also noticed little kids doing it when
they're eagerly working their Play-Doh or intent on
a challenging dot-to-dot. The same observation can
be made with somebody trying to thread a needle.

The Science Bug
I assumed that this was just some kind of nervous
habit, similar to chewing on pens or tapping your
feet. However, moat evidence suggests that this is
actually a subconscious form of communication.
'Tongue-showing", as it is known among behav
ioral scientists, is a well-documented phenomenon. It
is generally an indicator that someone is concentrat
ing and wants to be left alone. People of all ages do
the "tongue-show," from young children to adults.
Even gorillas have been shown to stick their tongues
out when balancing on wagons or hanging from
chains (demanding tasks in the primate world, I sup
pose).
Tongue-showing has been shown to be propor
tional to the difficulty of the task a person is per
forming. For example, a videotape was made of a
group of people playing pooL The harder the shot the
person was making, the more likely they were to
stick their tongue out. Furthermore, the worse a
player was, the more they stuck out their tongue,
presumably because they had to try harder to make
the shot.
However, most people don't even realize they are
showing their tongue. It is definitely an unconscious
signal, unlike deliberate sticking out of the tongue
which can have other connotations.
Furthermore, it seems that other people truly do
respond to this subliminal "leave me alone" signal.
Experimenters gave a written test to a group of stu
dents. The supervisor told them that he was going to
be working on transcribing an audio tape, and pro
ceeded to put on a big set of headphones and set dili
gently to work.
However, each test booklet had been rigged to be
missing one page. When the students came to the
missing page, they would hesitate before disturbing
the supervisor. An accomplice was placed to time
exactly how long it took each student to get up the
guts to interrupt the supervisor.
Now here's the trick. Half the time the supervisor
just looked like he was concentrating. The other half
of the time, he also put his tongue between his lips.
The results were pretty impressive. If the supervi
sor didn't show his tongue, it took 8 seconds for the
students to get up. If he was sending the subliminal
message, it took 19 seconds. It seems the tongue
show intimidated students from interrupting his
concentration.
Even more though, the students were afterwards
asked why they hesitated, as well as what the teach
er's facial expression was. None of them mentioned
his tongue. Even those who definitely saw the
tongue-show denied that the supervisor was sticking
out his tongue. So the action really seemed to be a
subconscious message.
Another interesting thing people do without
thought is blinking. Most people blink about ten
times a minute and each blink lasts about three
tenths of a second. If someone switched the light out
for that long, you would notice it. But you never see
everything go black when you blink.
A group of researchers showed that this is because
your eye basically shuts down during the blink. They
shined a fiber optic light at the roof of a subject's
mouth so that it actually illuminated the back of the
eye and thus wouldn't be interrupted by a blink. By
Hashing this light either when the person was blink
ing or not blinking, they showed that the sensitivity
of the eye is actually decreased when the person was
blinking. Basically, the brain stops taking visual data
when you blink, so you don't notice it.
So next time you get stuck in a final, you can
amuse yourself by watching people's unconscious
behavior. You can probably even come up with things
that are more interesting than sticking out the
tongue.

Instead of trying to figure out life's mysteries by stick
ing out your tongue, send questions to the Science
