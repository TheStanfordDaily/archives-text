# Developments in Sleep
## Stanford researchers cite insomnia, and other sleep-related symptoms, as serious risk factors for heart problems 
### Jing-Chyi Chao 
Many of us have experienced
insomnia, but probably none of us
ever expected that it could lead to
heart trouble.
In a ground-breaking study,
Stanford researchers found that
middle-aged men who admitted
experiencing sleep difficulty had a
higher incidence of cardiovascular
disease than healthy men.
Roy Oman, currently a research
scientist at the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center, performed the

insomnia research at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Pre
vention as a postdoctoral fellow. He
thinks that psychological rather
than physiological factors may be
involved.
"Sleep-onset difficulty is not a
risk factor itself but a marker for
some other problems such as stress
and work pressure [which] have
been shown to be risk factors for
heart disease," said Oman. When
work pressure and anger frequency
variables are factored in, "sleep dif
ficulty no longer predicts who would

get heart disease, so that suggests
there's something going on between
those three variables."
Such sleep trouble is more likely
to be caused by a stressful lifestyle
rather than any chemical component
in the body, according to Oman.
Sleep-onset difficulty may also be
attributed to "racing mind," the
inability to "shut off thoughts in
one's mind because of stress or
related problems.
Physicians have long hypothe
sized that individuals who suffer
from high blood pressure, cigarette
and alcohol use, obesity, lack of
exercise, highly stressful lives and
"type A" personality are more likely
to suffer a heart attack. These con
ditions induce the buildup of plaque
at the site of an injured arterial
wall. This plaque, composed of fatty
deposits, is in turn covered by con
nective tissue cells, narrowing the
artery. Calcium deposits in the
plaque then harden the artery, facil
itating blockage. When a blood clot
lodges in the narrowed arteiy, blood
flow to the heart is blocked and a
heart attack results.
Oman's results may lead to the
facilitation of diagnosis for a patient
with heart disease, although he said
he doesn't believe that his study —
the first of its kind — will revolu
tionize diagnosis. "If a man comes in
to see a doctor . . . the doctor might
ask the person 'How much stress do
you experience in your daily life?' "
Oman said. "[But since] this is an
open-ended question, the doctor
could simply ask one question, 'Do
you have trouble falling asleep at
night?' " A positive response would
be indicative of potential heart trou
ble.
Oman utilized analysis of data
collected in the Stanford Five City
Project, a general, community
based multimedia education and
intervention program organized to
educate the public about cardiovas
cular risk factors and rates.
The project took place from the
late 1970s to the late 1980s when
participants from a random sam
pling of the population had their
blood pressure and cholesterol lev
els measured and completed an
interview-administered question
naire regarding their health habits.
These questions involved such psy
chological factors as the amount of
work pressure, anger / frustration
levels and sleep difficulty individu
als experienced.

Those who were diagnosed with
heart disease an average of five
years after their initial participation
in the project were selected for
Oman's study. These individuals —
107 men and 53 women, Northern
California residents primarily in
their 50s and 60s — were compared
with healthy individuals of the same
age, gender and ethnicity. After
such variables as high blood pres
sure, high cholesterol level and
smoking were factored in, the psy
chological variables of work pres
sure and anger levels dropped out
but sleep difficulty remained.
"There is a two-fold chance of
being diagnosed with coronary heart
disease if you have sleep-onset diffi
culty," said Oman. The odds ratio of
a male being diagnosed with heart
disease after experiencing sleep dif
ficulty was more than two times
greater than that for a male with
normal sleep patterns.
This relationship did not appear
in the study of the women, however.
According to Oman, this may have
been due to the relatively small
sample size of 53 women or the fact
that these women, with an average
age of 59, were protected from heart
disease by their estrogen levels.
Past studies have shown that men
are much more susceptible to heart
disease than women in the fifth and
sixth decades of life. This disparity
decreases with increasing age.
Follow-up studies may focus
more closely on women to determine
if a correlation exists as well. In
addition, the extent of sleep difficul
ty in those who were diagnosed with
heart disease may be researched and
a follow-up on those individuals sur
veyed may be conducted.
In a related study, Dr. C. Barr
Taylor, who contributed to Oman's
study, found that stressful occur
rences like the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake do not increase the
chances of a heart attack in an indi
vidual who is otherwise healthy.
Taylor, a psychiatry professor at
the School of Medicine and co-direc
tor of the Stanford Cardiac Rehabil
itation Center, and his colleagues
compiled records from five hospitals
in the Bay Area from time periods
during and after the quake.
An increase in the number of
individuals with chest pain and pal
pitations occurred immediately
after the quake but there was no
increase in the number of actual
heart attacks.
