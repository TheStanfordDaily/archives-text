# Stanford, EPA put on the Green Lights

Stanford University and Stanford
Health Services showed their commit
ment to energy conservation and pollu
tion prevention yesterday by signing a
memorandum of understanding with the
Environmental Protection Agency's
Green Lights Program.
The program is a pledge by Stanford to
survey all of the light systems in its acad
emic, administrative and health care fa
cilities and to upgrade the lighting in 90
percent of the areas where it is profitable.
Residential, dining and athletic areas of
campus have not joined the program.
These changes, according to Stan
ford's Energy Management Coordinator

Susan Kulakowski, will provide the
Stanford community with better quality
lighting that also causes less pollution.
In return for this commitment, the
EPA will provide technical assistance, ex
pert advice to help redesign existing light
ing structures and computer software to
help Stanford find the most efficient
lighting. It will also help Stanford publi
cize its involvement in the program.
Kulakowski said that Stanford already
periodically upgrades its lighting system
and that the Green Lights program will
enable Stanford to "get recognition and
support for what we are already doing
and planning to do."
These renovations, Kulakowski said,
will cost Stanford about $5 million over

the next five years. The University cur
rently spends the same amount on all en
ergy-efficient upgrades to facilities. This
covers changes to heating as well as light
ing systems.
The changes will save Facilities an es
timated 20 percent of its annual budget
allotted to lighting because the new sys
tems are energy-efficient and require low
maintenance.
The State of California, Hewlett-
Packard and the California State Univer
sity System are among groups that have
joined the Green Lights program. Cur
rently, about 1,800 organizations across
the country are Green Lights partners
and allies, according to Mike Sten
burg, a senior policy adviser for
the EPA.
"We're especially interested in
showing educational facilities and
their staff that there are environ

mentally preferable alternatives,"
Stenburg said.
"Once word gets out [about
the program], there will be no
reason why everyone won't
become a Green Lights partner,"
said Kulakowski. "It makes
sense to invest in energy-effi
cient programs because [Stan
ford] pays less and we save
energy."
