# New study done by Medical School shows that regular exercise can dramatically improve sleep quality and increase sleep duration

### Nancy Farghalli Contributing Writer 
The average person will sleep a total of 220,000
hours in his or her lifetime. A new study conducted at
the Stanford Medical Center, specifically at the Stan
ford Center for Research in Disease Prevention, has
shown that older people can improve the quality and
duration of their sleep by doing one simple thing;
exercise.
The study — led by Abby King, an assistant pro
fessor of health and research policy at the Medical
Center — is one of the first randomly controlled stud
ies to evaluate the effects of exercise on older people.
It focused on older people who had previously com
plained about their sleep patterns. By incorporating
participants' own reports on sleep quality instead of
measuring physiological traits linking sleep and exer
cise, this analysis did not conform to the standard way
that past studies have examined the connection
between sleep and working out.
"While there have been previous studies reporting
a relationship between physical activity and
quality, the majority have been correlational or obser
vational. They have focused primarily on younger
men and liave tended to report physiological changes
while ignoring the patient's actual sleep experience
and how it might change with an increase in exercise,
" King said.
The Stanford Center for Research and Disease
Prevention narrowed its study to 43 people ranging in
age from 50 to 76. All members had to have expressed
mild to moderate sleep complaints in order to partici
pate. The participants also had to be clean of any sleep
medication such as pills for at least six months.
Lasting for four months, the study compared the
sleep patterns of two groups. The control group con
sisted of 20 volunteers who did not do any exercise
while the experimental group of 23 volunteers initial
ly did not exercise but started mild exercise routines
with the study.
The exercise regimen consisted of four sessions

per week: two hour-long sessions of some type of
stretching and aerobic exercise and two 30-minute
sessions of some exercise in the comfort of the partic
ipants' own neighborhoods, such as walking or jog
ging.
Each participant kept a sleep journal twice during
the study — for two weeks in the beginning and at the
end. The participants reported on sleep duration,

sleep quality and how long it took to fall
asleep.
In their journals, the exercise group
noted better sleep quality, longer sleep
and the ability to fall asleep faster, show
ing that regular exercise, such as brisk
walking, can not only improve the quali
ty of sleep but also lessen the time inter
val it takes to fall asleep.
King pointed out that moderate exer
cise is a safe solution for older people
with mild sleep complaints. She also
added that this study proves again the
importance of physical activity such as
exercise in living a healthy life.
The collected data also showed no dis
crepancy between the sleep patterns of
men and women in their respective
groups. Both men and women in the
exercise group slept nearly an hour
longer than those in the control group.
The average duration of Bleep for the
control group was about 5.9 hours, com
pared to about 6.8 hours for the exercise
group.
Although this study was specifically
tailored around the sleep patterns of
older people, much can be said about
younger people and sleep, King said.
"While we focused on older men and
women because beginning with middle
age the incidence of sleep complaints
tends to rise, it is quite possible that the
results could be relevant for younger

adults," she said.
As a general rule, sleep and exercise are both
important factors in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
While the study shows that exercise can drastically
add to an individual's sleep quality, it also demon
strates that starting regular exercise at an early age
can have a positive influence on a person's life later
down the road.
