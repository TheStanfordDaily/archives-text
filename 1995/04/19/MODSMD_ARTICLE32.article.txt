## Cardinal football team gears up for '96 campaign Installation of more aggressive 4-3 defense, quarterback questions foci of spring practices 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Like an expensive Italian sports car, last year's
version of the Stanford football team seemed to
spend too much time needing repairs in vital areas.
When running properly, it was a sight to behold, as
in the 46-28 embarrassment of Washington.
But when it faltered, you had to watch out for fly
ing parts. A broken tackle leading to a game-winning
touchdown here, a missed field goal there and the
Cardinal was about ready to be put up on blocks and
sold for scrap metal.
Enter new chief mechanic (or head coach) Tyrone
Willingham. Stripping the team bare and rebuilding
a new squad from the left-over parts, he has begun
the arduous task of changing the Ferrari into a
Honda.
With an overhauled coaching staff, Willingham
has already begun to tinker under the hood. For
1995, the Cardinal plans to adopt a new 4-3 defen

sive scheme and break in a new quarterback, among
other pressing concerns over the three-week spring
practice schedule that began April 8.
Adopting a more structured, focused approach to
spring practice than in the past, addressing each
practice and each point of interest with intensity. In
the past few years, practice under Bill Walsh was
more relaxed and not as on time, according to senior
defensive end Jason White. But things have changed
under Willingham, an incessant goal-setter.
Topping the list of concerns this spring is the
competition at quarterback, where fifth-year senior
Mark Butterfield and junior Tim Carey are locked in
a heated battle for the unenviable position of follow
ing Steve Stenstrom's record-setting footsteps. But
terfield has thrown 51 passes in his collegiate career,
and Carey has yet to see game action game in his two
years on the Farm.

place to decide next year's starter,
according to Willingham. More
than anything, the spring offers
the coaches a chance to evaluate
each position and see who will fit
best in the right places.
"We will finalize the quarter
back position when the guys
determine it themselves," he said.
"They have as much to do with
that decision as I do. When that
day arises, we'll make that deci
sion. If it is tomorrow, then that's
when we'll make it. If it is next
fall, we'll make it then."
To help relieve stress on the
new quarterback, whomever it
should be, Willingham said he
plans to adopt a balanced offense
as opposed to the more pass
inclined offense of the Bill Walsh
years. With junior Mike Mitchell
recovered from a nagging ankle
injury which kept him out of eight
games last year, the running back
stables are fully stocked. Sopho
more Anthony Bookman, who led
the team with 577 yards last year,
and junior Quincy Jacobs give
Willingham depth at the halfback
slot.
Expect those three to see plen
ty of daylight, as two bruising
fullbacks and three all-conference
linemen return to open holes for
Willingham's offense. Fullbacks

Adam Salina and Greg Cornelia,
both juniors, right guard Brad
Badger (a junior) and seniors Jeff
Buckey and T.J. Gaynor should
supply the Cardinal with enough
power and experience as trench
warriors to improve on last year's
138 yards-per-game rushing aver
age.
Willingham said he looks to see
first down as a "50-50" decision to
run or pass, with second down
having roughly the same odds,
depending on the yardage needed
for the first down. At most, he
expects a 60-40 slant to the run.
What is most important for him is
maintaining the option to run or
pass on any given down.
The offense will also be multi
ple in nature, in both personnel
and formations.
Looking at Stanford's receiv
ing corps, you don't know
whether to change their diapers
or send them off to a retirement
home. Although junior flanker
Brian Manning and senior wide
receiver Mark Harris have exten
sive game experience, the rest of
the group caught a total of four
passes last year.
Tight end remains another
large question mark. Junior col
lege All-Americans Derek Hub
bard and Greg Clark, who have
been enrolled at Stanford since
winter quarter, join junior
Tommy Hanson to fill departed
Tony Cline's spot as a consistent
blocker and short-yardage receiv

er.
Defensively, the change from a
3-4 alignment to a 4-3 at first
seems just a matter of semantics,
as White moves from a pass-rush
ing outside linebacker slot to a
pass-rushing defensive end posi
tion.
However, a change in defensive
philosophy accompanies the shift
to a 4-3 set. According to Willing
ham, next year's defense will con
centrate on playing aggressively
and forcing turnovers. As far as
any changes in formation, Will
ingham said that this will be a
modified 4-3 with two inside
linebackers, not the traditional
pro-style 4-3 with a sole middle
linebacker.
"There's quite a bit of change
from last year, a lot more moving
around," White said. "My job
hasn't changed a whole lot. But a
strong point of what we're trying
to do is force turnovers."
White also said he hopes the
change in defense can approach
the intensity of the 1992 squad,
which set a new standard for
Stanford defensive teams.
Although nine starters return
on defense, there are no guaran
tees that any will earn their posi
tions back. Willingham stressed
the need to develop a aggressive,
physical approach to both offense
and defense, and a squad that
gave up over 400 yards and 32
points a game is immediately sus
pect.
