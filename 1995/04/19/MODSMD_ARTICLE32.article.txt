## Cardinal football team gears up for '96 campaign Installation of more aggressive 4-3 defense, quarterback questions foci of spring practices 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Like an expensive Italian sports car, last year's
version of the Stanford football team seemed to
spend too much time needing repairs in vital areas.
When running properly, it was a sight to behold, as
in the 46-28 embarrassment of Washington.
But when it faltered, you had to watch out for fly
ing parts. A broken tackle leading to a game-winning
touchdown here, a missed field goal there and the
Cardinal was about ready to be put up on blocks and
sold for scrap metal.
Enter new chief mechanic (or head coach) Tyrone
Willingham. Stripping the team bare and rebuilding
a new squad from the left-over parts, he has begun
the arduous task of changing the Ferrari into a
Honda.
With an overhauled coaching staff, Willingham
has already begun to tinker under the hood. For
1995, the Cardinal plans to adopt a new 4-3 defen

sive scheme and break in a new quarterback, among
other pressing concerns over the three-week spring
practice schedule that began April 8.
Adopting a more structured, focused approach to
spring practice than in the past, addressing each
practice and each point of interest with intensity. In
the past few years, practice under Bill Walsh was
more relaxed and not as on time, according to senior
defensive end Jason White. But things have changed
under Willingham, an incessant goal-setter.
Topping the list of concerns this spring is the
competition at quarterback, where fifth-year senior
Mark Butterfield and junior Tim Carey are locked in
a heated battle for the unenviable position of follow
ing Steve Stenstrom's record-setting footsteps. But
terfield has thrown 51 passes in his collegiate career,
and Carey has yet to see game action game in his two
years on the Farm.
However, spring drills are not necessarily the

Junior Jason White and the rest of the Stanford defense will be learning to adjust to a new defensive
scheme during spring practice.
