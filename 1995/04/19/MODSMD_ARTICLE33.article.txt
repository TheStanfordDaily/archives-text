# Battle in Berkeley
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Cardinal (18-2 overall, 7-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference's
Southern Division): winners of
seven straight, undefeated in the
Pac-10 South, successful in seven
of eight road matches this season.
The Golden Bears (12-4, 4-3 in
the Pac-10): Ranked ninth in the
country, riding a seven-game win
streak, four consecutive Pac-10
South triumphs, and losers of
only one home match.
Something has got to give on
Wednesday as the Stanford
women's tennis team seeks to
hunt down Oski in the Cal-coined
"Big Rematch" in Berkeley at the
Hellman Tennis Center.
Stanford leads the overall
series 31-4; the most recent victo
ry came at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium in early March by a score
of 5-3. In truth, that match was
not as close as the final score indi
cates as the Cardinal was points
away from clinching victory in the
singles competition.
That loss marked the Bears'
third Pac-10 South defeat in as
many attempts, but Cal has since
reeled off four straight conference
wins. Cal and UCLA are the only
teams with any hopes of catching
the Cardinal for the conference
crown.
"They had a few injuries that
now seem to be solved or whatev

er," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan. "That helps
them a lot, and of course that
helps them in doubles too. So I'm
not surprised; I thought they

were good at the beginning of the
year. They weren't getting perfor
mances and they were injured, and
now they seem to be getting perfor
mances and getting healthy. So it's
going to be a war."
An upset of the Bears' nationally
second-ranked doubles squad of
Pam Nelson and Keirsten Alley by
the Cardinal duo of sophomore

Katie Schlukebir and freshman
Ania Bleszynski highlighted Stan
ford's early season triumph. The
Stanford tandem downed their Bay
Area counterparts in straight sets,
6-2,6-2, and have been climbing the
Rolex Collegiate ranks ever since.
They sit currently at No. 11 nation
ally.
Cal's only singles victories came
at the Nos. 2 and 3 spots. Bleszyns
ki fell in a tie-break heartbreaker, 6-
7, 6-2, 7-6. Redshirt senior Kim
Shasby also lost in a tie-breaker to
Alley, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6.

Stanford won two doubles
matches, and appeared on their way
to a third when coaches suspended
the match with Shasby and sopho
more Emily Burt leading 7-6,1-1.
Looking somewhat confused
and apathetic midway through the
season in losses to UCLA and
Texas, Brennan had worried about
the Cardinal's focus. "I think the
girls, especially the newer ones, are
starting to figure out the rhythm
and flow of the season," said Bren
nan. "I'm not worried about focus
now."
