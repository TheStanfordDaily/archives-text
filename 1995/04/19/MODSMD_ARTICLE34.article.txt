# Tough group awaits Sadao Hamada and company in Columbus
## Gymnasts off to compete for NCAA title 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Great teams have only one goal
each season, and the Stanford
men's gymnastics squad is only
three intensely competitive days
away from attaining it.
The Cardinal (10-1-1) will try
to take their third crown in four
years as they begin competition at
the NCAA championships in
Columbus, Ohio. The team,
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion and Western Regional cham
pion, hopes to rewrite the ending
to last year's story, in which the
team finished runner-up to
Nebraska.
"This year, things are differ
ent," said sophomore national
team member Keith Wiley. "We
look better and we're better pre
pared.
"Practices have been good.
We're consistently hitting our
routines and the skills have been
there."
Last season's disappointment
ultimately set the stage for this
year's campaign.
"We started our season with
the goal of winning the NCAA
championship," said freshman
Clarence Miao. "We've had no
short term goals. Everything
we've done has been focused on
this. We've worked really hard all
season for this chance."
Unfortunately, five other
teams share such sentiments.

Besides the two other West region
qualifiers — Oklahoma and the
defending champion Cornhuskers
— Stanford must contend with
East schools Penn State, lowa
and Ohio State. All six squads are
returning to the championship
for the second straight year, but
the Cardinal has not competed
against any of the East region
schools this season.
"It's difficult to predict how
good they'll be," said head coach
Sadao Hamada. "I don't want to
make any assumptions about the
East region teams, but I'm sure
that they are highly competitive.
I'm confident that we can beat
any of the teams from the West
though.
"No matter what, everything
we do must be superb if we want
to win. Physical conditioning,
mental toughness, preparation,
strength, consistency, flexibility,
they all have to be there."
All three East region teams
posted scores in regional competi
tion higher than any of those out
of the West region, prompting
many to call into question
whether Stanford can be competi
tive.
"We try to put the rankings
and numbers out of our mind,"
said sophomore national team
member Jamie Ellis. "Stuff like
that doesn't matter with the dif
ferences between judging in sepa
rate meets.
"But at the same time, some

times you can't help but look at it
and say, 'Wow, they might really
be better than us.' You can try to
pass it off, but it always lurks in
the back of your mind."
The Cardinal will first face off
with the other five squads on
Thursday night at 7 p.m. when

team and individual preliminaries
begin. Each team will compete in
each event and the scores will
determine competition for the fol
lowing two days. The top three
teams will compete Friday night

in the team championships while
the top eight individuals in each
event will advance to the event
finals on Saturday.
"It's hard for me to have a
game plan on Friday because I
know so little about Penn State,
lowa, and Ohio State," Hamada
said. "I don't want to gamble, so
I have to just try to get the guys
to hit consistent routines on
Thursday and ensure a spot in
the team championships.
"I can gather more informa
tion [on Thursday! and try to
change routines and difficulty
according to what I see in the
other teams."
To those familiar with colle
giate gymnastics, the presence of
Stanford in this meet is surpris
ing to say the least. The gym
nasts finished the regular season
ranked ridiculously low at No. 14
after being picked in the presea
son to finish fifth. Injuries and
inconsistency prevented the
team from posting high scores in
late meets against Cal and Illi
nois.
"We are definitely coming in
as an underdog," said sophomore
specialist lan Bachrach. "No one
really thought we'd even be here,
so they may still have questions
about our ability."

Even at the lowest point of the
season, a mistake-ridden victory
against San Jose State, Hamada
remained firmly supportive of
his grand plan for winning the
title.
"Since the very beginning of
the season, I've been training the
team with the goal of peaking at
this meet," he said. "Now, we are
right on schedule. I am very
happy with where we are."
His gymnasts have shown
similar faith in his system.

"Sometimes, you don't agree
with his particular training
plans," said senior national team
member and co-captain Josh
Stein, "but you do it because you
believe that he knows what's
best for the team.
"Coach Hamada definitely has
everything calculated out in his

mind. He always plans ahead to
what he thinks is going to hap
pen and usually he's right."
And yet with all the buildup
that surrounds this weekend, the
team is remarkably collected.
"Obviously, there's a lot of pres
sure," Wiley said, "but the over
all mood is relaxed.
"Our intensity is increased
and we are definitely more moti
vated now, but we are trying to
stay calm about this."
Hamada shows great concern
regarding his team's composure.
"I definitely have tried to pre
pare the team not to panic if it
smells like something is going
wrong." Hamada said. "I think
that is an important part of my
coaching — preparing the team
to be mentally tough."
However, the squad has
already showed that it can han
dle its share of the pressure. At
the MPSF championship the
team got off to a rough start — it
made key mistakes in its first
two events on the vault and par
allel bars — but was able to pull
it together to finish strong and
win the title.
"It's a testament to the char
acter of the team," Wiley said.
"Everyone has such a strong
work ethic and the right frame of
mind. We've been taking every
thing one routine at a time and
not worried too much about the
future. Hopefully, we can do the
same this weekend."
