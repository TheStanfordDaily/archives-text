# Tough group awaits Sadao Hamada and company in Columbus
## Gymnasts off to compete for NCAA title 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Great teams have only one goal
each season, and the Stanford
men's gymnastics squad is only
three intensely competitive days
away from attaining it.
The Cardinal (10-1-1) will try
to take their third crown in four
years as they begin competition at
the NCAA championships in
Columbus, Ohio. The team,
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion and Western Regional cham
pion, hopes to rewrite the ending
to last year's story, in which the
team finished runner-up to
Nebraska.
"This year, things are differ
ent," said sophomore national
team member Keith Wiley. "We
look better and we're better pre
pared.
"Practices have been good.
We're consistently hitting our
routines and the skills have been
there."
Last season's disappointment
ultimately set the stage for this
year's campaign.
"We started our season with
the goal of winning the NCAA
championship," said freshman
Clarence Miao. "We've had no
short term goals. Everything
we've done has been focused on
this. We've worked really hard all
season for this chance."
Unfortunately, five other
teams share such sentiments.

Besides the two other West region
qualifiers — Oklahoma and the
defending champion Cornhuskers
— Stanford must contend with
East schools Penn State, lowa
and Ohio State. All six squads are
returning to the championship
for the second straight year, but
the Cardinal has not competed
against any of the East region
schools this season.
"It's difficult to predict how
good they'll be," said head coach
Sadao Hamada. "I don't want to
make any assumptions about the
East region teams, but I'm sure
that they are highly competitive.
I'm confident that we can beat
any of the teams from the West
though.
"No matter what, everything
we do must be superb if we want
to win. Physical conditioning,
mental toughness, preparation,
strength, consistency, flexibility,
they all have to be there."
All three East region teams
posted scores in regional competi
tion higher than any of those out
of the West region, prompting
many to call into question
whether Stanford can be competi
tive.
"We try to put the rankings
and numbers out of our mind,"
said sophomore national team
member Jamie Ellis. "Stuff like
that doesn't matter with the dif
ferences between judging in sepa
rate meets.
"But at the same time, some

times you can't help but look at it
and say, 'Wow, they might really
be better than us.' You can try to
pass it off, but it always lurks in
the back of your mind."
The Cardinal will first face off
with the other five squads on
Thursday night at 7 p.m. when

team and individual preliminaries
begin. Each team will compete in
each event and the scores will
determine competition for the fol
lowing two days. The top three
teams will compete Friday night
