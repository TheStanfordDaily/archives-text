# Is a broken heart in the cards?

I think my sister is in love. Not
with a guy in her class, not
with a steamy rock star and
not with Grant Hill. (That would
be me.) She's in love with volley
ball, and it's a match made in
heaven.

You want commitment? She's
emotionally and spiritually devot
ed to the sport, practicing hours
and hours every week for both
her high school and club teams.
You want loyalty? She's a one
sport woman through and
through, sacrificing both basket
ball and track to be with the sport
she truly loves. And as far as the
future goes, she's not afraid to
speculate: She can see herself
staying with volleyball all
throughout college, maybe even
beyond. Something tells me she's
into something good.
Like any relationship that's
wonderful from the start, howev
er, I fear that this one may reach
a point where perfection just isn't
enough. My sister's breakup with
volleyball wouldn't be from a lack
of time poured into it, faithless
ness or even another sport taking
its place. The bitter farewell
would occur because she just
doesn't love it anymore, an issue
that many serious athletes face at
least once in their lives. Do I still
love it? Or have I loved it for so

long that I've grown to hate it?
The danger here rises from the
hazy divide between pleasure and
business â€” specifically, between
sports as fun and sports as a job.
Most athletes today get involved
in their sport simply for the love
of it. Yet as time goes on, the
stakes escalate: times must be
faster, averages must be higher,
moves must be stronger. While
some are driven by the pressure,
others watch their desire take a
bashing by the added strains.
In "Hoop Dreams," adoration
for basketball approaches obses
sion. For the two youths, and for
so many thousands more, the
sport isn't just something to do
on a Saturday afternoon with a
few buddies. It beckons life suc
cess. Without a love to play, the
two athletes wouldn't have a
chance; it fuels them, makes
them want to improve and
answer the demands they willing
ly lay on themselves. Yet the out
side world brings something more
to the playground courts: busi
ness, money, fame, gold, starry
eyes. It's the umbrella of capital
ist hoopla that too often puts a
shady cast to an athlete's inno
cent love for a sport.
I believe that the whole concept
of athletics grew out of somebody's
desire to compete and have some
fun. Then a less ingenious person
threw money and prestige into the
deal, and sports suddenly became
fun for some, profit for others.
The hazy divide emerges early.
My sister began playing volleyball
in junior high, which is late by
universal standards. Already by
then, recruiters hide inconspicu
