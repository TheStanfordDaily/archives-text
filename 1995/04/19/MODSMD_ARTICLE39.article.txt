Grad student bothers Rice
A political science graduate student
has harassed Provost Condoleezza Rice
and the staff at the provost's office
three times in the last two weeks.
Ann Fletcher, assistant to the
provost, reported that the male student
came to the office on March 22. March
23 and April 10 and demanded to see
Rice.
The student apparently visited Rice's
office to complain about the condition
of his Escondido Village apartment.
"He was out of the country and there
was some damage done to his apartment
from a broken water pipe," said Stan
ford Police Sgt. John McMullen.
The student had called the office a
few times and asked for an appointment
with Rice but then on March 22 went to
the office because he wanted the
provost to handle the situation directly,
McMullen said.
When the provost's staff told the stu
dent he would have to make a written
request for an appointment with Rice,
the student left the office. The follow
ing day, he returned to the provost's
office and demanded an appointment
with her, McMullen said.
According to McMullen, the student

returned to the Provost's Office on April 10
and again demanded to see Rice. Several
police officers told him that he could not see
her, nor could he enter Building 10 without
an appointment.
"He left. . . . [Then hel was stopping
African-American women in front of the
building and was asking if they were
Provost Rice," McMullen said.
The man demands to see Rice, a political
science professor, on the basis that he is a
student in the Political Science Depart
ment, McMullen said.
"I don't think it is a major issue," Rice
said. "We have people coming in and out of
the office and if a secretary thinks they
might be causing a disturbance, she'll call
the police."
Sex offense reported
On April 10, a female Stanford student
reported a sex offense that occurred in
Memorial Court around 4:30 p.m..
According to Stanford Police Sgt. John
McMullen, an unidentified stranger walked
up to the student and began talking to her.
The male stranger then sat down next to
her in such a way that his erect penis was
visible through his shorts.

When she observed his situation, she
turned her body so that she was facing
away from him. The man then stood up and
faced her so that his erection would again
be visible, McMullen said. The woman
became frightened and left the scene, after
which she called the police. The man was
described as an Asian male, 5 foot 10 inch
es tall and weighing approximately 150
pounds.
Stereo equipment stolen
An unknown suspect or suspects stole
two stereo components from the Phi Delta
Theta house at 680 Lomita Drive on April
7.
The suspects stole a TEAC brand name
stereo receiver and a Pioneer dual cassette
player / recorder from the recreation room
in the fraternity house. The equipment was
worth more than $400, which classifies the
incident as a grand theft.
The suspects entered the house by
unknown means and stole the stereo some
time between 2 a.m. and 11 a.m.. The police
are still investigating the incident.
