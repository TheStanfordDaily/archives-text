# Three-slate COP race, confusion provide proving ground for system
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The ASSU Spring General
Election that begins today repre
sents the second real test of the
preferential voting system used to
choose the Council of Presidents.
And because of the system's lack
of publicity, many students still
may be unaware of exactly how it
works.
In response to a costly 1991
runoff COP election, ASSU sena
tors approved a system of prefer
ential balloting during the 1991-
92 school year. As with Australian
voting rules, the electorate is
asked to rank each slate in prefer
ential order.
"The most superior advantage
of the system is that it allows a
multiple-candidate election to be
decided in a single election cor
rectly taking into account each
voter's desires and their relative
preference for the candidates," ex
plained Neil Crellin, deputy sen
ate chair in 1991-92. "Thus it
saves money by avoiding expen
sive (and typically poorly attend
ed) runoff elections."
However, when the system was
first used in 1992 many students
surveyed by The Daily said they
were confused by the system;
then-ASSU Election Commission
er Enda Hu said hundreds of bal
lots demonstrated a misunder
standing of the way preferential
balloting works.
That year, a slate whose only
promise was to abolish the COP
won the election narrowly over

three other slates, including one
which actually received more
first-place votes than the eventual
winner.
The last two years have seen
only two slates running for COP, a
situation which makes preferen
tial balloting irrelevant. In this

The ASSU Spring General
Election will be held today
and Thursday. Polling
opened this morning at 12
a.m. and will close tomorrow
night at 11:59 p.m. Students
must have a Cardinal or Ice
land account in order to vote
over the World Wide Web.
The ASSU recommends vot
ing in Residential Computing
clusters, Tresidder LaIR or
Meyer Library. There are two
methods of online voting; for
complete instructions on the
electronic election system
please see page 5.
In addition, paper balloting
sites will also be open from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Graduate
School of Business, the Law
School and Tresidder LaIR.
Two forms of identification
are required — a picture ID
and a valid SUID. Any prob
lems and questions should be
directed to Jonathan Berent,
the elections commissioner,

year's election, however, there are
three slates — "We Deserve Bet
ter," endorsed by the People's
Platform, "Let's Be Candid," rep
resenting the Students' Alliance
party and"The Very Serious
Clowns" of the Hammer and Cof
fin party.
For students who attempt to
beat the system, the system might
accidentally beat them.
"There is no way to fool the sys
tem," said Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi. "There's no advantage to
gain from strategic use of their
vote."
"The biggest mistake made in

voting is the incorrect belief that
by expressing your preferences in
incorrect order, you can somehow
give an advantage to your first
choice candidate or slate," Crellin
said. "This belief is false and based
on an extremely flawed under
standing of the preferential sys
tem."
Unlike a ranking system such
as the NCAA top-25 voting, which
is based on points, in the preferen
tial system votes are tabulated in a
series of rounds until one slate
receives a majority. In the first
round, all first-place votes are
counted.
If no slate receives a majority,
the slate receiving the least num
ber of first place votes is dropped
from contention. On each ballot
where that slate appeared first, the

second-place vote then becomes a
first-place vote. The second round
begins the same way.
The system means that a slate
which does not receive the most
first-place votes in the first round
could win the election, as hap
pened in 1992.
A difficulty with the system is
that students may switch their
realistic second-and third-place
votes in an attempt to prevent one
slate from gaining any advantage
over their slate of choice. Students
who only vote for one slate and do
not rank the other two could also
adversely affect election results.
In this spring election — which
runs today and tomorrow — this
could only occur if a student's pre
ferred slate gets the least amount
of first-place votes.

Although there has been little
publicity on the system (the only
mention in the elections handbook
is an instruction to "rank the fol
lowing slates" in the COP section
of the sample ballot), student lead
ers still feel students are aware of
the system.
"It shouldn't really have an
affect on the election as long as
people understand how it works,"
Kasrawi said. "It's not a point sys
tem, and it doesn't do you any good
to put someone further down in
the ranking. In general people
understand how it works."
Undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell agreed: "The most
likely and probable expectation is
that students would vote their
preferences."
In the 1992 election, when the

votes for the "Students First" slate
(which received 24 percent of the
original first place votes) were
redistributed, almost 40 percent of
the voting population did not vote
for either of the two remaining
slates. This was quite unexpected,
as "Students First" and "Indepen
dents: A New Era" (which narrow
ly lost the election to the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate) had
similar political goals.
It seems that voters who
favored "Students First" realized
the competition it could have with
the "Independents" and thought
that by not voting at all for that
slate, "Students First" could have
a better chance. In reality, this
worked the other way.
Due to the increasing biparti
sanship between the People's Plat

form and Students' Alliance par
ties, candidate Chris Onstad of
"The Very Serious Clowns" said
the system could aid his slate if
many of the voters fall on political
extremes.
"In the event that there are a
whole lot of [voters who lean
toward the] left or right who like to
split up the vote and put us in sec
ond place, we have a good chance of
winning," Onstad said.
"Students should be careful to
vote in accordance with the direc
tions, indicating their choices in
actual order of preference," Crellin
said.
COP candidate Michael Choo
agreed: "If people don't choose
their preferences in one, two, three
order and they try to beat the sys
tem, then they will be beaten."

first-place votes in the first round
could win the election, as hap
pened in 1992.
A difficulty with the system is
that students may switch their
realistic second-and third-place
votes in an attempt to prevent one
slate from gaining any advantage
over their slate of choice. Students
who only vote for one slate and do
not rank the other two could also
adversely affect election results.
In this spring election — which
runs today and tomorrow — this
could only occur if a student's pre
ferred slate gets the least amount
of first-place votes.

Although there has been little
publicity on the system (the only
mention in the elections handbook
is an instruction to "rank the fol
lowing slates" in the COP section
of the sample ballot), student lead
ers still feel students are aware of
the system.
"It shouldn't really have an
affect on the election as long as
people understand how it works,"
Kasrawi said. "It's not a point sys
tem, and it doesn't do you any good
to put someone further down in
the ranking. In general people
understand how it works."
Undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell agreed: "The most
likely and probable expectation is
that students would vote their
preferences."
In the 1992 election, when the

votes for the "Students First" slate
(which received 24 percent of the
original first place votes) were
redistributed, almost 40 percent of
the voting population did not vote
for either of the two remaining
slates. This was quite unexpected,
as "Students First" and "Indepen
dents: A New Era" (which narrow
ly lost the election to the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate) had
similar political goals.
It seems that voters who
favored "Students First" realized
the competition it could have with
the "Independents" and thought
that by not voting at all for that
slate, "Students First" could have
a better chance. In reality, this
worked the other way.
Due to the increasing biparti
sanship between the People's Plat

form and Students' Alliance par
ties, candidate Chris Onstad of
"The Very Serious Clowns" said
the system could aid his slate if
many of the voters fall on political
extremes.
"In the event that there are a
whole lot of [voters who lean
toward the] left or right who like to
split up the vote and put us in sec
ond place, we have a good chance of
winning," Onstad said.
"Students should be careful to
vote in accordance with the direc
tions, indicating their choices in
actual order of preference," Crellin
said.
COP candidate Michael Choo
agreed: "If people don't choose
their preferences in one, two, three
order and they try to beat the sys
tem, then they will be beaten."
