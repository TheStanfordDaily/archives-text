# Three-slate COP race, confusion provide proving ground for system
##

The ASSU Spring General
Election that begins today repre
sents the second real test of the
preferential voting system used to
choose the Council of Presidents.
And because of the system's lack
of publicity, many students still
may be unaware of exactly how it
works.
In response to a costly 1991
runoff COP election, ASSU sena
tors approved a system of prefer
ential balloting during the 1991-
92 school year. As with Australian
voting rules, the electorate is
asked to rank each slate in prefer
ential order.
"The most superior advantage
of the system is that it allows a
multiple-candidate election to be
decided in a single election cor
rectly taking into account each
voter's desires and their relative
preference for the candidates," ex
plained Neil Crellin, deputy sen
ate chair in 1991-92. "Thus it
saves money by avoiding expen
sive (and typically poorly attend
ed) runoff elections."
However, when the system was
first used in 1992 many students
surveyed by The Daily said they
were confused by the system;
then-ASSU Election Commission
er Enda Hu said hundreds of bal
lots demonstrated a misunder
standing of the way preferential
balloting works.
That year, a slate whose only
promise was to abolish the COP
won the election narrowly over

three other slates, including one
which actually received more
first-place votes than the eventual
winner.
The last two years have seen
only two slates running for COP, a
situation which makes preferen
tial balloting irrelevant. In this

The ASSU Spring General
Election will be held today
and Thursday. Polling
opened this morning at 12
a.m. and will close tomorrow
night at 11:59 p.m. Students
must have a Cardinal or Ice
land account in order to vote
over the World Wide Web.
The ASSU recommends vot
ing in Residential Computing
clusters, Tresidder LaIR or

methods of online voting; for

In addition, paper balloting

a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Graduate
School of Business, the Law
School and Tresidder LaIR.
Two forms of identification
