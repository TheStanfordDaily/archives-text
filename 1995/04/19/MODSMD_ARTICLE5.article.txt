# Uniting to fight Civil Rights Initiative
## Large Law School group to oppose amendment 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
More than 100 Law School students and
faculty members attended a news confer
ence yesterday to announce their support of
affirmative action and their rejection of the
California Civil Rights Initiative. The
meeting marked the start of a state wide
campaign against the initiative.
The initiative — which is likely to appear
on California's November 1996 ballot —
aims to change the California constitution
to end preferential treatment based on race
or gender in public employment and educa
tion.
The largest group from the Law School
ever to come together for a political issue,
27 faculty members and more than 200 stu
dents have announced their opposition to
the constitutional amendment.
While the proposed amendment de
nounces the use of gender, color, ethnicity
or national origin for the purposes of both
discrimination and preferential treatment,
the real intent of the initiative is to reverse
affirmative action as established in the

Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to the
Law School group.
"It is neutral in language, but not neu
tral in intent," said third-year law student
Troy Christmas.
The Stanford group's message has been
endorsed by faculty and students at other
major law schools in California, including
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall, UC-Davis, Gold
en Gate, Hastings, Loyola, Santa Clara
University, UCLA and the University of
San Francisco.
Law Profs. Barbara Babcock and
William Simon and law students Kim
Mueller and Daniel Weiss spoke at yester
day's conference, claiming that continued
affirmative action practices are necessary
to promote racial diversity.
"Do we live in a society of equality of op
portunity where an African-American male
with the same educational background can
expect to make $10,000 less than his white
counterpart?" Weiss asked the assembled
students.
"Affirmative action has
worked, can work and will work,"
he added.
Babcock said she probably was
chosen to speak at the news con
ference because she has been one
of the beneficiaries of affirmative
action. Supported by massive
applause from the audience, she
described her experience as assis
tant attorney general of the Unit
ed States.
"When I first got to Washing
ton in the Carter Administration,

the press asked me more than
once or twice: 'How does it feel to
have gotten your job because you
are a woman?' I developed a stock
response: 'It feels a lot better than
not getting it,' " Babcock said.
While Stanford as a private
university would not be directly
affected by the initiative, several
Law School faculty members said
they fear that the proposed con
stitutional amendment would
also adversely affect the diversity
of applicant pools at private insti
tutions.
"Stanford Law School has been
a testing ground for affirmative
action for the last 30 years — we
have seen it and it works," Simon

said.
Several students attending the
conference stressed the need for
continued use of affirmative
action in Stanford admission poli
cies.
"There continues to be forms
of preferential treatments at this
institution that benefit whites
and men," said Jon Blazer, a first
year law student.
While the majority of Law
School faculty and a large number
of law students have expressed
their support for affirmative
action, a group of seven law stu
dents expressed concern that
many of the complex questions
related to affirmative action have

not been adequately addressed by
the Law School group.
Scott Kupor, a second year law
student, said he would like the
Stanford campus to engage in a
more complete discussion. "The
real question is whether the gov
ernment should be in the busi
ness of discriminating against
individuals on the bases of race,"
he said.
Other students considered the
Stanford message to be too main
stream. "More diverse faculty
could have been represented,"
said Madhavi Sunder, a first-year
law student, noting that no people
of color were represented among
the conference speakers.
