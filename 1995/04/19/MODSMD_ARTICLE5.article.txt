# Uniting to fight Civil Rights Initiative
## Large Law School group to oppose amendment 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
More than 100 Law School students and
faculty members attended a news confer
ence yesterday to announce their support of
affirmative action and their rejection of the
California Civil Rights Initiative. The
meeting marked the start of a state wide
campaign against the initiative.
The initiative — which is likely to appear
on California's November 1996 ballot —
aims to change the California constitution
to end preferential treatment based on race
or gender in public employment and educa
tion.
The largest group from the Law School
ever to come together for a political issue,
27 faculty members and more than 200 stu
dents have announced their opposition to
the constitutional amendment.
While the proposed amendment de
nounces the use of gender, color, ethnicity
or national origin for the purposes of both
discrimination and preferential treatment,
the real intent of the initiative is to reverse
affirmative action as established in the

Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to the
Law School group.
"It is neutral in language, but not neu
tral in intent," said third-year law student
Troy Christmas.
The Stanford group's message has been
endorsed by faculty and students at other
major law schools in California, including
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall, UC-Davis, Gold
en Gate, Hastings, Loyola, Santa Clara
University, UCLA and the University of
San Francisco.
Law Profs. Barbara Babcock and
William Simon and law students Kim
Mueller and Daniel Weiss spoke at yester
day's conference, claiming that continued
affirmative action practices are necessary
to promote racial diversity.
"Do we live in a society of equality of op
portunity where an African-American male
with the same educational background can
expect to make $10,000 less than his white
counterpart?" Weiss asked the assembled
students.
