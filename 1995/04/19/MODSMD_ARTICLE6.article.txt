# Domestic violence policy creation being considered

Due to an enterprising judge and an in
terested police chief, some members of the
Stanford community are looking at the pos
sibility of introducing a domestic violence
policy on campus.
Judge Eugene Hyman of the Santa Clara
County Court and Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington met last week to discuss
the viability of implementing a policy which
would address the issue of domestic vio
lence. Hyman, in addition to his judging du
ties, has worked on a number of committees
which address the problem of domestic vio
lence in the county.
Hyman said he envisions a strategy
which focuses on recognition and preven
tion of domestic violence. "When freshmen
come in and are taught about date rape,
maybe the topic of domestic violence could

also be addressed," he said.
"I think the reason it has been suggested
is because this is a community that involves
a lot of families ... and there is a potential
for domestic violence because of the stress
ful situation of school," said Carol Nyholm,
assistant director for Escondido Village and
a residence dean.
Both Hyman and Herrington stressed
that the discussions are at a very prelimi
nary stage. At this point, Hyman said,
"we're identifying people who would. . .
form committees."
"We thought we'd gather a small group
of people and sit down and talk about it to
see what would emerge," Herrington said.
"I don't know what will emerge, but at the
very least what will come out of it is more
awareness."
