# Domestic violence policy creation being considered
## 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
Due to an enterprising judge and an in
terested police chief, some members of the
Stanford community are looking at the pos
sibility of introducing a domestic violence
policy on campus.
Judge Eugene Hyman of the Santa Clara
County Court and Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington met last week to discuss
the viability of implementing a policy which
would address the issue of domestic vio
lence. Hyman, in addition to his judging du
ties, has worked on a number of committees
which address the problem of domestic vio
lence in the county.
Hyman said he envisions a strategy
which focuses on recognition and preven
tion of domestic violence. "When freshmen
come in and are taught about date rape,
maybe the topic of domestic violence could

also be addressed," he said.
"I think the reason it has been suggested
is because this is a community that involves
a lot of families ... and there is a potential
for domestic violence because of the stress
ful situation of school," said Carol Nyholm,
assistant director for Escondido Village and
a residence dean.
Both Hyman and Herrington stressed
that the discussions are at a very prelimi
nary stage. At this point, Hyman said,
"we're identifying people who would. . .
form committees."
"We thought we'd gather a small group
of people and sit down and talk about it to
see what would emerge," Herrington said.
"I don't know what will emerge, but at the
very least what will come out of it is more
awareness."
Director of Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services Alejandro Martinez
said he hopes the discussions will
clear up all that domestic violence
entails.
"It is not just someone who has
been severely beaten and must go
to the hospital," Martinez said.
"The most typical form involves
pushing, shoving and acts of vio
lence . . . that can escalate to
much larger problems."
Herrington stressed that the
dimensions of domestic violence
are broader in the Stanford com
munity than at most universi
ties because most students and
some faculty and staff live on
campus. "Domestic violence

here can mean between any two
people living together and in
terms of our community we
have many more opportunities
to experience the problem,"
Herrington said.
Laraine Zappert, clinical asso
ciate professor of psychiatry at
the School of Medicine and the
sexual harassment coordinating
adviser, said that for many people
at Stanford domestic violence
feels like an anathema because
there is a lack of recognition of
the problem in the academic com
munity.
She said, though, that the
media attention that has been
given to the O.J. Simpson trial
has made people more aware that
it is a problem which cuts across
social and class lines.
Herrington added that domes

tic violence tends to be a very
insidious problem because it is so
often hidden, "especially in this
community."
Martinez said the value of a
policy at Stanford would not nec
essarily be to break new ground,
but to stress the commitment to
make the University a safe place.
"What we will need is educa
tion," Martinez said. "We have
people from all over the world and
I they J all need to understand our
community standards."
For now, Martinez said that
what Cowell Student Health
Center can offer is an aware
ness of the resources that are
available in Palo Alto, like the
battered women's shelter. He
added that a policy which would
emphasize an active response to
reported situations would be

the best use of University
resources.
All the parties involved said
the most important aspect of a
policy would focus on awareness
of domestic violence and educa
tion as to its causes and how it can
be prevented.
"We would hope that a policy
might lead to earlier intervention
and knowledge for people that
there is a place to go and some
thing to do," Herrington said.
"Recognition would help so that
the victim would begin to be more
comfortable seeking help."
Hyman said he knows of no
university which has a policy on
domestic violence. "At Stanford, a
policy might eventually be used as
a template with respect to educa
tional institutions in the nation,"
he said.
