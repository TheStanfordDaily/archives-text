"If you were following the media's
take on what was news, you'd

happening in the world today is
the O.J. Simpson trial, and before
that, the Oscars, and before that,
Jordan coming back to the Bulls,"
he said.
Carson said that one only had
to look at the fashion industry to
see how the media and TV can dic
tate fashion mores.
"What... the fashion industry
says is that they can tell us any
thing and we'll buy it," said Car

"If some person makes a jump
shot on TV and points to his shoes
and you believe that it's the reason
he could do it, you deserve to pay
extra," he added.
But Carson did not just point
out problems in the U.S. educa

Carson, the 1995 PfeifTer Dis

the United States near the bottom
of reading and math test scores.
He questioned whether the United
States could continue its role as a
leading center of research and
innovation.
"We ranked 21 out of 22 on that
list. The only nation to do worse
than us was a Third World coun

and dodge bullets on a daily basis,"
Carson said.
He added that the results may
not have been so alarming if it was
an isolated study of inner-city
kids, but it was a test given "across
the board."
