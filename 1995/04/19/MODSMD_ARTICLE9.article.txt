### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
Two cars were involved in a
head-on collision on campus Mon
day afternoon, closing Junipero
Serra Boulevard, for almost three
hours and leaving three people
with moderate injuries.
At approximately 3:16 p.m., a
1994 Toyota 4Runner, traveling
south on Junipero Serra, and a
1994 Mercury Sable, traveling
north on the same road, collided
just north of Stanford Avenue, said
California Highway Patrol Sgt.
Brown.
The Toyota 4Runner was driv
en by Juthica Stangl, 61, a Stan
ford resident. Stangl is the wife of
Peter Stangl, director of Lane
Library at the School of Medicine.
The Mercury Sable was driven
by Lydia Wintemute, 67, a Palo
Alto resident. Lydia's husband,
Norman Wintemute, was also in
the vehicle at the time of the colli
sion.
The three parties involved in
the accident suffered moderate
injuries, including broken bones
and lacerations, Brown said.
The three were transported to
Stanford Hospital, where they all

remain in stable condition. Hospi
tal officials did not know when they
will be released.
Officials from the California
Highway Patrol are currently
investigating the incident.
"We're still trying to piece it
together," said California Highway
Patrol Sgt. Chaney.
Officials do not know at this
time what caused the collision or if
either driver was at fault, Brown
said. He added, however, that no
arrests were made.
No witnesses were at the scene
of the accident when officials
arrived, Brown said.
As a result of the collision, offi
cials had to divert traffic east and
west of Junipero Serra. The road's
closure was due to the position of
the two vehicles and vehicle fluids
on the roadway, including trans
mission fluid and a small amount
of gasoline, Brown said.
He added that a Santa Clara
County work crew had to come out
and clean up the debris on the road.
"There had been a light rain,
and with the fluids on the road, it
would have been dangerous for
other cars," Brown said. Brown
and Chaney refused to reveal theii
first names.
