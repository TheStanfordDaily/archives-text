## Bombing kills at least 26; 300 missing 
### 
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A car bomb
ripped deep into America's heartland yester
day, killing at least 26 people and leaving
300 missing in a blast that gouged a nine
story hole in a federal office building.
The dead included at least 12 children,
some of whom had just been dropped off by
their parents at a day-care center.
There was no immediate claim of respon
sibility for the attack, the deadliest U.S.
bombing in 75 years.
At least 200 people were injured — 58
critically, according to Fire Chief Gary
Marrs — and scores were feared trapped in
the rubble of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building more than nine hours after the
bombing.
Three people were rescued last night and
rescuers said there was a woman trapped in
the basement who said there were two oth
ers down there. She didn't know if they were
dead or alive.
Attorney General Janet Reno refused to
comment on who might have been behind
the attack. President Clinton called the
bombers "evil cowards" and Reno said the
government would seek the death penalty
against them.
Mayor Ron Norick said the blast, which
left a crater 30 feet long and eight feet deep,
was caused by a car bomb. He said the car
had been outside, in front of the building.
"Obviously, no amateur did this," Gov.
Frank Keating said. "Whoever did this was
an animal."

A police source, who requested anonymi
ty, said FBI agents were trying to piece
together a van or a truck that was believed to
have carried the explosives. An axle of the
vehicle was found about two blocks from the
scene, the source said.
Their clothes torn off, victims covered in
glass and plaster emerged bloodied and cry
ing from the building, which looked as if a
giant bite had been taken out of it, exposing
its floors like a dollhouse.
Cables and other debris dangled from the
floors like tangled streamers in a scene that
brought to mind the car bombings at the
U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut
in 1983.
"I dove under that table," said Brian
Espe, a state veterinarian who was giving a
slide presentation on the fifth floor. "When I
came out, I could see daylight if I looked
north and daylight if I looked west."
Police Sgt. Bill Martin said at least 26
people were killed, 12 of them children.
Earlier in the day, paramedic Heather
Taylor said 17 children were dead at the
scene, a figure later disputed by police. Dr.
Carl Spengler, one of the first doctors at the
scene, said the children, all at the building's
day-care center, ranged in age from I to 7
and some were burned beyond recognition.
Reno said that 300 people were unac
counted for by late afternoon. About 20 of 40
children in the day-care center were missing.
The explosion, similar to the terrorist car
bombing that killed six people and injured

1,000 at New York's World Trade Center in
1993, occurred just after 9 a.m., when most
of the more than 500 federal employees were
in their offices.
The blast could be felt 30 miles away.
Black smoke streamed across the skyline,
and glass, bricks and other debris were
spread over a wide area. The north side of
the building was gone. Cars were incinerated
on the street.
Christopher Wright of the Coast Guard,
one of those helping inside the building, said
rescuers periodically turned off their chain
saws and prying tools to listen for pleas for
help, "but we didn't hear anything — just
death."
"We're talking to victims who are in there
and reassuring them that we're doing every
thing within the good Lord's power to reach
them," Asst. Fire Chief Jon Hansen said.
"It's going to be a very slow process."
The building, which opened in 1977, has
offices of such federal agencies as the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
Social Security, Veterans Affairs, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and Housing
and Urban Development, and a federal
employee credit union and military recruit
ing offices.
The bomb was perhaps 1,000 to 1,200
pounds, said John Magaw, ATF director. As
for whether his agency suspected terrorists,
he told CNN: "I think any time you have this
kind of damage, this kind of explosion, you
have to look there first."
