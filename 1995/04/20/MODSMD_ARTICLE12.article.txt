Another gas attack
YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) — The old woman stood
in front of the entrance to Yokohama Station, shop
ping bags in hand, and watched a chemical warfare
unit suit up and head inside.
"Oh my God," she said. "Not again."
A month after terrorists released nerve gas in
Tokyo's subways, a possible copycat attacker let loose
a mystery gas yesterday at the main train station in
Yokohama, just south of the capital.
This time, 300 people got sick as the nation's
ragged nerves were set on edge again.
The attack in Yokohama came after one of Japan's

most trying months since World War 11, in which
cherished beliefs about the nation's security have
been undermined.
Twelve people were killed and 5,500 sickened in
the March 20 nerve gas attack in Tokyo. Ten days
later, an assailant shot and seriously wounded the
nation's top police official.
Last Saturday, stores closed and 10,000 police
mobilized in Tokyo amid fears that the doomsday cult
suspected in the nerve gas case would deliver a terror
ist strike in the capital. Nothing happened.
Police said they believe yesterday's case was a
deliberate attack, and sent hundreds of officers and
chemical weapons experts wearing gas masks to Yoko

hama Station to look for suspicious objects.
But as with the Tokyo subway attack, they made
no arrests and appeared to have no solid evidence.
At least 297 people were taken to hospitals, com
plaining of stinging eyes, coughs and dizziness after
inhaling a foul chemical odor at the station, police
said. No one was reported in serious condition; most
victims were treated and released.
Gore pushes nuclear treaty
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Vice President Al
Gore, pressing for permanent curbs on nuclear
weapons technology, declared yesterday that the US

ultimately wants to eliminate its own arsenal.
With at least 90 votes, a majority, in hand, Gore
took on the wavering and opposing nations with a
detailed response to their arguments and concerns.
Anything short of indefinite extension of the 25-year
old Non-Proliferation Treaty would encourage states
aspiring to obtain nuclear weapons "to hold their
options in reserve," Gore said.
"It will encourage would-be proliferators to lie low
and to clandestinely pursue their objectives," he said
in a speech that ranged from a dry recitation of nucle
ar issues to an echoing of President Franklin 1). Roo
sevelt's admonition in 1936 that Americans faced a
"rendezvous with destiny."
