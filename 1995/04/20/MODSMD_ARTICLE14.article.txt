## ENDORSEMENTS We deserve 'Candid' 
### 
DON'T PROMISE WHAT you
can't deliver. It's a sound
lesson for all of us. But only
one of the major slates running for
Council of Presidents appears to
have learned it. None of them
knocked our socks off, but at least
the Students' Alliance slate "Let's
Be Candid" has made promises it
can accomplish.
The members of Let's Be Candid
bring a diversity of valuable experi
ences that would help them imple
ment their programs successfully.
Junior Rachel Hall worked with
the California Post-secondary Edu
cation Commission and managed
the production of a course guide at
UC-Davis before transferring to
Stanford. Both junior Michelle Gee
and law student Curtis Kin served
as senators this year, and junior
Tom Baranowski has been presi
dent of the Interfraternity Council.
Let's Be Candid also comes
across as a slate of competent, rea

sonable people who are likely to
impress University representa
tives. Over the past few years,
we've seen that a professional pre
sentation "through the proper
channels" is much more likely to
garner effective financial support
from the provost than noisy
protests. As the only student advo
cates with direct access to high
ranking Stanford officials, the COP
should have the personality and
skills to make a good impression.
Admittedly, the Students'
Alliance slate does not understand
some practical aspects of politics as
well as its main opponent does.
They have a lot of homework to do
before they can address the inter
nal problems of the ASSU.
Still, this year students have the
opportunity to elect a COP that
doesn't promise the impossible and
then fail to achieve it. For its can
dor alone, Let's Be Candid
deserves a chance.

Constitutional Amendment: Senate Bill XXV-CA-4
YES ®NO
To allow special-fee groups to apply for funding from either all students, only undergraduate
students or only graduate students.

Although the special-fee
system has problems, the
"Common Sense Fee Reform
Amendment" is a poorly-conceived
and confusing attempt at a solu
tion. The underlying concept is
sound but much of the amendment
is very confusing, notably language
tacked on at the end that would

urge the senate to eliminate fee
refund buffers.
The sponsors of this bill are
approaching this problem in the
wrong way — they hope that the
electorate will pass a flawed amend
ment and promise to fix the prob
lems later. Students should use
some common sense and reject it.

Constitutional Amendment: Senate Bill XXV-CA-7
DYES O NO
To transfer the freedom of information provision of the ASSU from the bylaws to the consti
tution.

IT'S HARD TO argue against
the "Freedom of Information
Amendment," which would
incorporate a previously existing
portion of the ASSU Bylaws into

the constitution. While the effects
of this move may be minimal, the
bylaw's value is clear — it is wor
thy of becoming a permanent part
of the ASSU's premier document.
