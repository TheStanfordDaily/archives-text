# Special- and general-fee endorsements
## 
### 
To make informed special-fee endorse
ments The Daily's Editorial Board met last
weekend with representatives of each orga
nization requesting a fee. In making its rec
ommendations the hoard used five guiding
criteria:
• Whether the group provides good value for
the dollar.
• Whether the group makes a conscientious
and reasonably successful effort to involve
and serve a significant portion of the stu
dent Ixxly.
• Whether the group demonstrates initiative
in self-funding; that is, whether its budget
reflects that it is actively seeking revenue
sources other than the special fee.
• Whether the group has responded to Us
refund rate and the results of last year's
elections.
• Whether the student body and not the Uni
versity or other parties should be funding

the group.
If the group in question met these criteria
sufficiently, it received a "yes. n
If it did not meet the criteria sufficiently,
it received a "no."
Groups that met some well but failed on
others received a "without recommenda
tion, " meaning that The Daily Editorial
Board could not confidently endorse the
group either way.
A "no recommendation" signals that
the Editorial Board decided not to make an
endorsement on that fee or did not meet with
the group.
The annual cost per student in parenthe
ses was estimated using fall quarter's total
enrollment of 14,031 students.
