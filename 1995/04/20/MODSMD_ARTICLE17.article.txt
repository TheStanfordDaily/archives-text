## For sale: futon and frame 
### 
SO I'M SELLING my wool-cotton
blend of softness. It's not on the top
of my spontaneously reproducing list
of things to do, but it's up there. Nope, not
burning the bra, just getting rid of the
futon. The frame feeling was starting to
annoy me anyway.
The deflated, resigned sigh of packing,
storing and moving returns. Once again in
a three-to-nine-month cycle. The nomadic
life is so much simpler.
To fit it all in a backpack.
It's not yet the right moment to get
those cardboard boxes, but it is time to
start slip-knotting those loose ends. Finish
the thesis, sign up for Kaplan, get the
Draw group ready. And find the next esca
lator up.
What's coming is a cauldron of finales
reminiscent of the love-you-like-a-sister
goodbyes in the anemic junior high year
book. The final months usher in a forebod
ing reality that relationships — sometimes
major relationships — may not last when
you move across campus or across the
country, when the face of convenience
turns away. Some will.
Still, it's a tough change if it's a friend,
harder if it's a love.
It's just not easy to find someone who
likes econo-sized Grape Nuts as much as
you do. And no one wants those awkward
ads in the back of the pink section of the
paper in the future. Advertising for the
perfect relationship in hieroglyphics.
Where SW hold out for security, money
and power and DM seek thin, beautiful and

young. It's a Bill Gates meets Christy
Turlington kind of world.
Slap on that $40 per ounce thigh cream.
All that pressure on us for the nirvana
of coupledom. The final good. The ultimate
exchange of mind, body, emotion. And flu
ids, wrapped in latex, with a bow.
After years of lamenting the woes of sin
gular life, someone finally wakes up bleary
eyed with you and hands you the Scope
with a smile. But now you're winning the
gold in a game of bad timing. One of you is
off to Zaire while the other is taking three
months of applied physics. The little
gnome at the crossroads appears. He's
smirking.
And it becomes an option....
The open relationship. A choice rede
fined by every couple — can you or can't
you? Maybe you don't have to turn down
passionate post-latt6 invitations anymore
on moral grounds. Seems like the best of
iill possible worlds. Taste-testing with a
stocked fridge.
Problem is, why look around and risk
turning a good thing into a mess just to
make sure you've got primo goods? The
uncertainty of a better best friend out
there kicks in. It's one thing to hang on
because it's right. It's clearly another to
turn it into a security blanket. Especially
when you still have the one from when you
were a kid.
Most of us will squeeze our eyes shut
and hold tight.
But unless, by luck or by plan, you and
Perfection happen to be skipping down the

same Yellow Brick Road, at some point,
you may have to drop hands. Because if
you don't, someone gets pulled in a direc
tion that really deep down isn't it.
When you're hardly sure how to get to
Oz, how can you know if, yes, you want to
do this whole journey deal together?
Sounds comfy. But it forces decisions
about what to do with the rest of your life
— I'll just follow, and figure it out when we
get there — and that may be a relief. A
temporary one. Where the risk is not tak
ing the time to just listen to yourself.
Alone.
Later — maybe nearly a lifetime later —
one of you may questioningly glance back,
then down at the tightly, too tightly, inter
locked hands, wondering.
If.
Or you may think back to the point
where you let go and, perhaps, ponder the
same darn thing. It's that leap into a
chasm of sorts, guided only by a feeling in
your gut. We're all jumping ofT in some
small way.
Packing up all that stuff again will be
enough to do. The move is coming. And not
too long ago, it seemed that just buying the
queen size futon was commitment enough.

If this doesn't apply to you yet, it will
Clip-n-save for future reference.
