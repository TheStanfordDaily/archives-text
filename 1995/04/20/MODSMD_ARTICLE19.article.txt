SHAC does important
work for the homeless
We are not seeking an endorsement
from The Daily. We are writing to clear up
any misconceptions the endorsement's lit
tle paragraph may have produced about
SHAC. To begin, we do not "serve" anyone
— not the homeless population, much less
Stanford students. We do not throw home
less people stale bread and 51 cents in
change and expect them to be grateful.
While this "service" does fill their needs for
a night, in the long run this charitable
work — if done alone — sends the message
to the homeless that that's all they deserve:
leftovers of a system too poor to take care
of its own people, yet rich enough to fund
more nightsticks to defend its city limits.
True service is a celebration of people —
our community of equally deserving
human beings with the same capacities and
needs. It is valuing all people and fighting
for the unified realization of human value.
Our true servants question suffering and
challenge what causes it. True service to
humans abandons charity. Unless given in
response to misfortune, charity is not a ser
vice. Directing charity at those made to suf
fer in poverty by an unjust system is an
insult. No true service is directed at the

The COP endorsement
slights Serious Clowns
As a member of "The Very Serious
Clowns" COP slate, I am outraged that we
were not mentioned once in your Council
of Presidents endorsement editorial. In
fact, the entire piece (which is pretty
lengthy, I should add) centers solely
around the Students' Alliance Slate. The
other "serious" slate, the People's Plat
form, is mentioned only briefly in the final
one and a half paragraphs, and the Very
Serious Clowns are nowhere to be found.
This kind of behavior Is unbelievably
childish and unprofessional coming from a
student publication. Just like on the ele
mentary school playground, The Daily is
playing favorites to the Students' Alliance,
while quietly neglecting the other slates.
This is a blatant misuse of power on the
part of The Daily. It uses its immense cir
culation to guarantee the victory of the one
slate that would further your own needs
and by doing so, you stifle all competition.
This is not the work of an objective paper.
Its biases shine through like the light of
day, and we Clowns don't like it.
Each COP slate has already had one
article each printed in The Daily, yet with

poor. Rather, it seeks to better all human
beings by unseating the injustice which we
nurture and protect. This is of service to us
all.
The Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition is a group of students, homeless
people and Palo Alto community members
who believe that change proceeds from the
bottom up. We believe in empowering our
selves and empowering the disenfranchised
to work together for justice in the issues of
housing, welfare, unemployment and civil
rights. We, as a Stanford group, cannot
have an impact on campus because the
population with which we work is refused
entrance by the Stanford community. If
you wjint frank discussions about poverty
and homelessness on your campus, invite
poor people onto your campus for dialogue
and discussions of real solutions to poverty.
Don't expect us to smuggle them in under
the banner of "raising awareness" for
show-and-tell.
To say that our group makes "minimal
impact on the Stanford campus" both
ignores the impact of our work with the
homeless community and implies that a
student group must cater to an already
privileged campus in order to be worth
funding. It pits our group against other
issue groups, when in reality, the issues of
race, class, gender, sexuality and ability are
all interconnected as they operate in Amer-

this new endorsement, the Students'
Alliance is given extra publicity, while the
rest of us are left out in the cold. The Seri

KZSU provides a great
service to all students
I am a freshman who works for the sta
tion's sports department, and I was
appalled when I opened the paper and saw
that the "no" box next to KZSU was
checked.
The Daily claims that the amount
requested by KZSU is too great. It seems to
me that it is obvious that the operation of a
major radio station will cost much more
than most of the other fee requests. The
ASSU Ijegal Counseling asks for $83,409,
and its services reach far fewer students
than the station. Aside from the possible
single example The Daily picked out as
wasteful spending, the station is monetari
ly efficient and is managed very well.

ica.
We are seeking support from people
who do not see people as a source of profit
or as problems. If you want an admittedly
small group of people continuing to work
with, not for, the homeless community,
then fund SHAC. Do not be led by a news
paper which fantasizes about its objectivity
and pretends that it makes endorsements
based on budget alone. When has the Issue
of money ever been objective and fair?

CSA fosters awareness
of affairs in Caribbean
On behalf of the Caribbean Students
Association (CSA), I am writing in
response to The Daily's Editorial Board's
decision to not endorse CSA's special fee
request. After reading the Editorial
Board's evaluation, I was quite disappoint
ed, not so much by the decision itself, but
more so by the reasoning used to arrive at
such a decision.
Although CSA is a "fairly new group" on
campus (it was revived in 1991), the organi-

But more important, the station does a
tremendous amount for the University. It
is a source of pride in the Bay Area
because, contrary to what The Daily may
claim, KZSU is widely listened to through
out the Bay Area. The sporting events gain
thousands of local listeners per event (in
some cases KZSU's sporting events are
broadcast on a national level), and these
listeners in turn support our athletic
teams.
KZSU also is a great opportunity for
students like myself to l>ecome involved in
broadcasting. Also, The Daily claims that
the students don't want to listen to what is
played at the station. First, I know person
ally that the sports events are widely lis
tened to and enjoyed by the students. Sec
ond, there are many well-done shows on
the air, whose music does not get played
on commercial radio. There is a great hip
hop show on prime time, and deejays play
jazz, blues and gospel which listeners can
not hear on commercial radio.
KZSU is providing many great services
to the students of Stanford. It would be an
embarrassment for a university such as
ours not to have a radio station of the
quality of KZSU, and students should vote
to grant KZSU its special fee.

some speakers and dance in Diaspora Get-

cational campaign to foster awareness and
involvement in Caribbean affairs, especially
at tills time when many of the islands are in
jeopardy. While it is true that CSA sponsors
social events, such as "chillouts," the Editori
al Board did not mention that during our
first annual Caribbean Weekend last April,
we hosted an Afro-Caribbean Festival, featur
ing African and Caribbean arts, crafts, food,
performances and a steel drum band. Nor
was it mentioned that CSA co-organized the
visit «ind speech of the then-exiled President
of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The visit
was such a success that President Aristide
has continued contact with some members of
CSA.
Since Aristide's visit, CSA has become
well-known throughout the Stanford com
munity and in neighboring areas. Mem
bers have been guests on the WKUP radio
show, campus and Bay Area groups have
solicited our participation in their events,
and CSA was awarded Program of the
Year by the Black Community Services

Because of our programming, we have
been able to donate money to the Bay Area
Haitian-American Council, a grassroots orga

refugees, as well as those still in Haiti. CSA

Banio transportation
costs are unavoidable
In the April 18 issue of The Daily, the
Editorial Board released a list of special fee
endorsements. While I disagree with many
of The Daily's conclusions regarding stu
dent organizations' special fee requests, I
am particularly dismayed by The Daily's
criticisms of Barrio Assistance. According
to the Editorial Board, "Barrio Assistance
is a wonderful group doing a wonderful
thing.... However the main cost for the
group ... is the rental of vans to bring the
children to Stanford on Saturday. This
seems wasteful. With some effort, it would
almost surely be possible for Barrio Assis
tance to find some person or corporation to
donate vans to the program."
Although I do not work directly with
Barrio Assistance, I can confirm that trans
portation is a tremendous problem for
almost every student organization engaged
in public and community service. The Haas
Center, the cultural and community cen
ters, the Office of Student Activities and
the administration have been unable to
resolve the transportation problems that
have plagued student organizations for
many years. In 1993, my predecessor,

has sponsored theme programs featuring
Haitian refugees, grassroots organizers,
Caribbean poets and professors. Two years
ago, CSA, in conjunction with the students
from the Law School, participated in a
nationwide hunger strike to protest the treat
ment of Haitians in Guantanamo Bay. The
members have also worked diligently to
establish relationships with not only load
Caribbean organizations, but also other
CSA's throughout the nation. As for the spe
cial fee that we are requesting, CSA is still
unsure as to how much money will be raised
at the benefit banquet mentioned in The
Daily.
Of course, everyone is entitle \i to his or
her opinion, but let us not forgi>t that organi
zations, such as the Chaparral and the Stan
ford Axe Committee, were once new groups
as well. There are several groups on campus
that have the potential to make a difference;
however, they need the means to do so.
Rather tlian discourage new groups, the
Stanford community should encourage then
as a source of diversity and education. CSA
has proven itself to be a viable organizat ion,
teaching many in the Stanford and local com
muni ties about the long-ignored islands in
the Caribbean.
J. Nadfine Gracia

Paula Estrada, conducted a transportation
needs assessment for Stanford organiza
tions involved in community service; after
one year of interviews, research, meetings
with administrators and yes, discussions
with corporations and other potential
donors, she concluded that the transporta
tion problems were too complicated to
resolve without extensive research.
Clearly, the Editorial Board did not
bother to investigate their whim that "it
would almost surely be possible to find
some person or corporation to donate vans
to the program," for if it had, it would have
learned that Barrio Assistance's trans
portation expenses are probably unavoid
able until the existing, campus-wide trans -
portation debacle is resolved. The Editorial
Board of The Daily has acted irresponsibly
in conducting its basic fact checking.
Moreover, if The Daily's findings with
regard to Barrio Assistance are in any way
representative of the Editorial Board's gen
eral research standards and practices, then
I encourage students to disregard The
Daily's special-fee recommendations and
make their own determinations based on
each individual organization's record,
accomplishments and proven results.

am particularly dismayed by The Daily's
criticisms of Barrio Assistance. According
to the Editorial Board, "Barrio Assistance
is a wonderful group doing a wonderful
thing.... However the main cost for the
group ... is the rental of vans to bring the
children to Stanford on Saturday. This
seems wasteful. With some effort, it would
almost surely be possible for Barrio Assis
tance to find some person or corporation to
donate vans to the program."
Although I do not work directly with
Barrio Assistance, I can confirm that trans
portation is a tremendous problem for
almost every student organization engaged
in public and community service. The Haas
Center, the cultural and community cen
ters, the Office of Student Activities and
the administration have been unable to
resolve the transportation problems that
have plagued student organizations for
many years. In 1993, my predecessor,

has sponsored theme programs featuring
Haitian refugees, grassroots organizers,
Caribbean poets and professors. Two years
ago, CSA, in conjunction with the students
from the Law School, participated in a
nationwide hunger strike to protest the treat
ment of Haitians in Guantanamo Bay. The
members have also worked diligently to
establish relationships with not only load
Caribbean organizations, but also other
CSA's throughout the nation. As for the spe
cial fee that we are requesting, CSA is still
unsure as to how much money will be raised
at the benefit banquet mentioned in The
Daily.
Of course, everyone is entitle \i to his or
her opinion, but let us not forgi>t that organi
zations, such as the Chaparral and the Stan
ford Axe Committee, were once new groups
as well. There are several groups on campus
that have the potential to make a difference;
however, they need the means to do so.
Rather tlian discourage new groups, the
Stanford community should encourage then
as a source of diversity and education. CSA
has proven itself to be a viable organizat ion,
teaching many in the Stanford and local com
muni ties about the long-ignored islands in
the Caribbean.

SHAC does important
work for the homeless
We are not seeking an endorsement
from The Daily. We are writing to clear up
any misconceptions the endorsement's lit
tle paragraph may have produced about
SHAC. To begin, we do not "serve" anyone
— not the homeless population, much less
Stanford students. We do not throw home
less people stale bread and 51 cents in
change and expect them to be grateful.
While this "service" does fill their needs for
a night, in the long run this charitable
work — if done alone — sends the message
to the homeless that that's all they deserve:
leftovers of a system too poor to take care
of its own people, yet rich enough to fund
more nightsticks to defend its city limits.
True service is a celebration of people —
our community of equally deserving
human beings with the same capacities and
needs. It is valuing all people and fighting
for the unified realization of human value.
Our true servants question suffering and
challenge what causes it. True service to
humans abandons charity. Unless given in
response to misfortune, charity is not a ser
vice. Directing charity at those made to suf
fer in poverty by an unjust system is an
insult. No true service is directed at the

The COP endorsement
slights Serious Clowns
As a member of "The Very Serious
Clowns" COP slate, I am outraged that we
were not mentioned once in your Council
of Presidents endorsement editorial. In
fact, the entire piece (which is pretty
lengthy, I should add) centers solely
around the Students' Alliance Slate. The
other "serious" slate, the People's Plat
form, is mentioned only briefly in the final
one and a half paragraphs, and the Very
Serious Clowns are nowhere to be found.
This kind of behavior Is unbelievably
childish and unprofessional coming from a
student publication. Just like on the ele
mentary school playground, The Daily is
playing favorites to the Students' Alliance,
while quietly neglecting the other slates.
This is a blatant misuse of power on the
part of The Daily. It uses its immense cir
culation to guarantee the victory of the one
slate that would further your own needs
and by doing so, you stifle all competition.
This is not the work of an objective paper.
Its biases shine through like the light of
day, and we Clowns don't like it.
Each COP slate has already had one
article each printed in The Daily, yet with

poor. Rather, it seeks to better all human
beings by unseating the injustice which we
nurture and protect. This is of service to us
all.
The Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition is a group of students, homeless
people and Palo Alto community members
who believe that change proceeds from the
bottom up. We believe in empowering our
selves and empowering the disenfranchised
to work together for justice in the issues of
housing, welfare, unemployment and civil
rights. We, as a Stanford group, cannot
have an impact on campus because the
population with which we work is refused
entrance by the Stanford community. If
you wjint frank discussions about poverty
and homelessness on your campus, invite
poor people onto your campus for dialogue
and discussions of real solutions to poverty.
Don't expect us to smuggle them in under
the banner of "raising awareness" for
show-and-tell.
To say that our group makes "minimal
impact on the Stanford campus" both
ignores the impact of our work with the
homeless community and implies that a
student group must cater to an already
privileged campus in order to be worth
funding. It pits our group against other
issue groups, when in reality, the issues of
race, class, gender, sexuality and ability are
all interconnected as they operate in Amer-

this new endorsement, the Students'

KZSU provides a great
service to all students
I am a freshman who works for the sta
tion's sports department, and I was
appalled when I opened the paper and saw
that the "no" box next to KZSU was
checked.
The Daily claims that the amount
requested by KZSU is too great. It seems to
me that it is obvious that the operation of a
major radio station will cost much more
than most of the other fee requests. The
ASSU Ijegal Counseling asks for $83,409,
and its services reach far fewer students
than the station. Aside from the possible
single example The Daily picked out as
wasteful spending, the station is monetari
ly efficient and is managed very well.

ica.
We are seeking support from people
who do not see people as a source of profit
or as problems. If you want an admittedly
small group of people continuing to work
with, not for, the homeless community,
then fund SHAC. Do not be led by a news
paper which fantasizes about its objectivity
and pretends that it makes endorsements
based on budget alone. When has the Issue
of money ever been objective and fair?

CSA fosters awareness
of affairs in Caribbean
On behalf of the Caribbean Students
Association (CSA), I am writing in
response to The Daily's Editorial Board's
decision to not endorse CSA's special fee
request. After reading the Editorial
Board's evaluation, I was quite disappoint
ed, not so much by the decision itself, but
more so by the reasoning used to arrive at
such a decision.
Although CSA is a "fairly new group" on
campus (it was revived in 1991), the organi-

But more important, the station does a
tremendous amount for the University. It
is a source of pride in the Bay Area
because, contrary to what The Daily may
claim, KZSU is widely listened to through
out the Bay Area. The sporting events gain
thousands of local listeners per event (in
some cases KZSU's sporting events are
broadcast on a national level), and these
listeners in turn support our athletic
teams.
KZSU also is a great opportunity for
students like myself to l>ecome involved in
broadcasting. Also, The Daily claims that
the students don't want to listen to what is
played at the station. First, I know person
ally that the sports events are widely lis
tened to and enjoyed by the students. Sec
ond, there are many well-done shows on
the air, whose music does not get played
on commercial radio. There is a great hip
hop show on prime time, and deejays play
jazz, blues and gospel which listeners can
not hear on commercial radio.
KZSU is providing many great services
to the students of Stanford. It would be an
embarrassment for a university such as
ours not to have a radio station of the
quality of KZSU, and students should vote
to grant KZSU its special fee.

jeopardy. While it is true that CSA sponsors
social events, such as "chillouts," the Editori

first annual Caribbean Weekend last April,
we hosted an Afro-Caribbean Festival, featur
ing African and Caribbean arts, crafts, food,
performances and a steel drum band. Nor
was it mentioned that CSA co-organized the
visit «ind speech of the then-exiled President
of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The visit
was such a success that President Aristide
has continued contact with some members of
CSA.
Since Aristide's visit, CSA has become
well-known throughout the Stanford com
munity and in neighboring areas. Mem
bers have been guests on the WKUP radio
show, campus and Bay Area groups have
solicited our participation in their events,
and CSA was awarded Program of the
Year by the Black Community Services

Because of our programming, we have
been able to donate money to the Bay Area

refugees, as well as those still in Haiti. CSA
