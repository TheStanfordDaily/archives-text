Rice is scheduled to present a pre
liminary University budget for the
1995-96 academic year at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting today.

The administration has been
successful in cutting the second in
stallation of $6 million from the
budget, Rice said. The University
plans to cut a total of $18 million
from the budgets last year, this
year and next year.
Budgets for the University's

schools will be cut only slightly,
Rice said. "Initial allocations to the
schools are being held flat in nomi
nal dollars," she said, so the bud
gets will not be increased for infla
tion.
But the allocation for the
Office of Student Affairs —
which took severe cuts last year
in order to make all the savings
of the three-year plan in the first
year — will be increased slightly
by an adjustment for inflation,
Rice said.
Rice said she had no specific
numbers for the budget yet. The

final budget will be presented to
the senate in June, before it goes
to the Board of Trustees for
approval.
At today's meeting, Rice said,
"I'll just talk about the process,
the problems and the things
we're trying to achieve."
In planning the budget, "what
we did was allocate what dollars
we have, which isn't much," she
said.
The University is "trying to
budget conservatively" in order
to leave a contingency for use in

the event of severe cuts in feder
al funding, she said.
Also at today's meeting, the
senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement will
present its recommendations for
changes to the University policy
on granting academic credit for
activity courses, including sports
and music.
Under current policy, up to 12
units of activity credit may be
counted toward the 180 units
needed for graduation. The com
mittee's proposal maintains the

12-unit limit; however, no more
than four of the 12 units may be
from a single department,
according to the recommenda
tion.
The committee was charged
with examining the recommen
dation made by the Commission
on Undergraduate Education in
its October report that no activi
ty courses be given academic
credit for graduation.
After long debate, the commit
tee decided that taking away all
credit "was far more complicated

than anticipated and, moreover,
involved value judgments regard
ing the aims of education at Stan
ford about which there was no
consensus in the committee," the
report said.
Committee Chair and Reli
gious Studies Prof. Van Harvey
explained that the regulations for
how many units are awarded for
different activities are "very com
plicated. That's why we finally
decided what we did for our rec
ommendation," he said.
The committee looked at more

important issues than the exact
distribution of credit, Harvey
continued. "What we thought
was important about the [com
mission's] report was that there
be a very strong distinction
between academic and non-aca
demic units," he said.
"Academic credit," the com
mittee's report said, "should only
be given to courses of substance
in which reading, writing, oral or
other relevant assignments are
completed and subjected to rigor
ous assessment."
