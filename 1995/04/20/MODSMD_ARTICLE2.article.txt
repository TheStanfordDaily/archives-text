Rice is scheduled to present a pre
liminary University budget for the
1995-96 academic year at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting today.

The administration has been
successful in cutting the second in
stallation of $6 million from the
budget, Rice said. The University
plans to cut a total of $18 million
from the budgets last year, this
year and next year.
Budgets for the University's

schools will be cut only slightly,
Rice said. "Initial allocations to the
schools are being held flat in nomi
nal dollars," she said, so the bud
gets will not be increased for infla
tion.
