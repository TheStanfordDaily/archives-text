## National title hopeful Elzie puts squad first 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Great athletes are defined by more
than simply statistics.
Senior co-captain Jene Elzie will go
down as the most highly acclaimed
women's gymnast in Stanford history,
but her legacy will remain not necessarily
because of her individual accomplish
ments. Instead, her devotion to her team
and her impact on the Cardinal program
will stand as her most distinguishing hon
ors.
Elzie will compete in the all-around
competition of the NCAA Individual
Nationals this Thursday at Georgia. She
earned a spot by finishing in the top 12 of
those gymnasts not competing in the
team tournament. She returns to nation
als for the first time since 1993, when she
competed on the uneven bars.
Arriving on the Farm in the fall of
1991, Elzie immediately impacted the
gymnastics scene by qualifying for indi
vidual nationals and earning All-Ameri
can honors during her freshman year.
However, Elzie's greatest joy came when
she realized that Stanford had qualified
for nationals as a team for the first time
ever.
"I remember the whole team got
together in [former teammate] Kerri
Kanuka's room," Elzie said. "We all
stayed up until we heard that we had
made it at about eight in the morning,
and I was screaming all the way back to
my dorm."
The 1993 season brought with it
numerous expectations along with a myr
iad of injuries for Elzie. After an excellent
freshman season she suffered a strained
Achilles tendon, back problems, and
hyperextended her knee during the Pacif
ic 10 Championship. Nevertheless, she
continued to compete and returned to

nationals, although this time without her
teammates.
After Stanford grabbed one of the top
recruiting classes in the country last year,
Elzie hoped that this season would bring
the Cardinal back to nationals. The addi
tion of freshmen Christie Jones, Keri
Monahan, Misty Moore and Amy Neil
promised to fill the holes in the Cardinal
lineup and ensure them a trip to Georgia.
Although she once again endured
numerous injuries that caused her chron
ic pain, Elzie continued to lead the team
with her consistent performances and
steadying presence.
"I have come to the point where I have
been injured so many times that I know
how to deal with them," Elzie said. "I
don't worry about being ready for meets.
Adrenaline is the best pain killer."
Even though the Cardinal team as a
whole did not peak at NCAA regionals the
way it had hoped, one member definitely
did. Elzie recorded the best all-around
score of her career and set a new school
record with a 39.025, averaging more
than 9.75 points on each of the four
events.
"We train everyone so that they peak
at the right time," said Coach Breck
Greenwood. "She [Jen 6] is the epitome of
that."
Growing up in El Cerrito, Calif., just
10 minutes from UC-Berkeley, Elzie's
parents did not groom her to become the
next great Olympic gymnast. Since most
of the children on Elzie's block were
teenagers, her mother Edwina enrolled
Jene in the local YMCA Kindergym pro
gram so that she could have a social out
let.
Unlike most gymnastics prodigies who
start training seriously at six or seven,
Elzie did not fully commit to the sport
