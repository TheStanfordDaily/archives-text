# Even the Worm
## Air, Admiral would make classic finals 
### 
Ah, spring. When, of
course, the thoughts of a
young man turn to sun,
fun — and the NBA playoffs.

March Madness is a different
experience altogether, with the
drama of little-known schools
and players stepping onto the
national stage for what might be
just 40 minutes of fame.
In contrast, the NBA playoffs
are a test of endurance and
allow for a greater amount of
character development in each
series. The teams are all famil
iar with each other, having met
in the regular season. Tt can be
said that the NBA playoffs are
relatively predictable. Some

might think a seven-game series
can get boring. Last year's finals
between the Houston Rockets
and the New York Knicks didn't
exactly catch my attention.
What I would love to see
come June is a championship
series that is entertaining,
exciting and maybe a little
irreverent. My wish for the
1995 NBA Finals is a matchup
between the Chicago Bulls and
the San Antonio Spurs.
Those who know me might
be surprised at my support of
Chicago, since they know I hate
the Bulls almost as much as I
hated the Celtics throughout
the '80s. I hate the Bulls, but I
love to watch Michael Jordan. I
see a classic matchup of gentle
men and reckless renegades.
Leaders and loose cannons. The
regal and the ridiculous.
As far as leadership and bas
ketball royalty, I'm talking
about the jaw-dropping play of
His Airness and the Admiral,
David Robinson. For some rea


Kyle
Utsumi
son, the media had trouble selling
Ewing vs. Olajuwon as the prima
ry rivalry in 1994. It wasn't the
same as Air Jordan vs. Sir
Charles or Michael vs. Magic.
Who deserves to win an NBA title
us much as David Robinson, the
Ail-American man? And who
would believe that after leaving
the baseball diamond, Jordan
could find his way back to the
finals mere months later? (Well,
maybe that's not too hard to
imagine.)
While Jordan and Robinson
might stage a game of "Can you
top this?" it would be just as like
ly for Dennis Rodman to play that
game by himself. It would be
delightfully fun to see what type
of behavior Rodman would dis
play if he were back in the NBA
Finals. Never a Rodman fan when
the Pistons were champs, I find
him to be pleasantly unpre

dictable, disrespectful and unusu
ally talented.
As a coach of a team sport, I
can't imagine having to deal with
the havoc Rodman can create, but
there's something to be said
about his 17.2 rebounds per game
average — he is the best at what
he does. Sure, Rodman some
times does little else, but the
Spurs, with a league-best 59-20,
apparently haven't suffered
much.
Just imagine — Game 7 at the
Alamodome. Jordan goes off for
60 points; Robinson is close
behind with in 50. Rodman, with
green hair, has 25 rebounds, no
points and several near-fights.
With two seconds left, Scottie Pip
pen and Toni Kukoc, upset that
the final play is called for Jordan,
refuse to enter the game. ...
Who wins? I don't know — I
hope I get to find out.

Despite his editor's high hopes,
Kyle doesn't think the Kings have
what it takes to get to the NBA
Finals.
