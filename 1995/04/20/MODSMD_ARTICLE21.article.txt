# Even the Worm
## Air, Admiral would make classic finals

Ah, spring. When, of
course, the thoughts of a
young man turn to sun,
fun â€” and the NBA playoffs.

March Madness is a different
experience altogether, with the
drama of little-known schools
and players stepping onto the
national stage for what might be
just 40 minutes of fame.
In contrast, the NBA playoffs
are a test of endurance and
allow for a greater amount of
character development in each
series. The teams are all famil
iar with each other, having met
in the regular season. Tt can be
said that the NBA playoffs are
relatively predictable. Some

might think a seven-game series
can get boring. Last year's finals
between the Houston Rockets
and the New York Knicks didn't
exactly catch my attention.
What I would love to see
come June is a championship
series that is entertaining,
exciting and maybe a little
irreverent. My wish for the
1995 NBA Finals is a matchup
between the Chicago Bulls and
the San Antonio Spurs.
Those who know me might
be surprised at my support of
Chicago, since they know I hate
the Bulls almost as much as I
hated the Celtics throughout
the '80s. I hate the Bulls, but I
love to watch Michael Jordan. I
see a classic matchup of gentle
men and reckless renegades.
Leaders and loose cannons. The
regal and the ridiculous.
As far as leadership and bas
ketball royalty, I'm talking
about the jaw-dropping play of
His Airness and the Admiral,
David Robinson. For some rea
