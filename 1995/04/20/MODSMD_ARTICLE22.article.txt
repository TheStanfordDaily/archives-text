# Sailors to split for now
## Women head to PCCs as skeleton men crew wants Thompson Trophy 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
This weekend the Stanford
sailing team will be traveling in
opposite directions. The women
will venture south to lovely San
Diego for the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships while five other Cardi
nal sailors will fly across the
country for the Thompson Tro
phy regatta in New London,
Conn.
The Pacific Coast Champi
onships is an important step on
the road to national playoffs. The
field of five schools will be vying
for a single berth to national com
petition. The regatta takes on
added significance because the
site, off the coast of Coronado at

the Navy Yacht Club, also will
host nationals. Needless to say,
this is an important weekend for
the women.
Stanford enters the regatta
with volumes of confidence.
Coach Steve Bourdow doesn't
expect much of a challenge from
the other four teams in the small
pool of participants. California,
UC-Irvine, UC-Santa Cruz and
UC-San Diego haven't reached
the same level as the dominant
Cardinal squad. Heavily favored
to destroy the competition, Stan
ford has goals beyond a first place
finish.
"We have to take the regatta
serious enough to gain experi
ence," Bourdow said. "We also
want to check out the site."
The sailors will be tacking in
Flying Junior boats in both the A
and B divisions. Maneuvering
Stanford's A division boat will be
sophomore skipper Alice Manard
and junior crew Sibyl Diver.
Junior skipper Cinnamon
Hampikian and freshman crew
Susan Bradford will represent
Stanford in the B division. Junior
Gretchen Uznis and freshman
Noelle Marquis could also see time
on the water.
Stanford returns to the East
Coast for the second time in as
many weeks. Last weekend, the
Cardinal captured fourth place in
the prestigious Admiral's Cup.
Beginning Saturday the team

looks to equal its success, with a
fresh batch of sailors. Bourdow
hopes the Thompson Trophy,
hosted by the Coast Guard Acade
my, will give some less experi
enced team members exposure to
big-time competition.
Some of the top schools in the
nation will participate in the
intersectional regatta, including
Navy and St. Mary's, Md. Most
schools in the race are expected to
bring their top teams.
On the other hand, Stanford's
best sailors will take a break from
competition this weekend. The
strength of Stanford's five-man
skeleton crew (the minimum
amount of sailors necessary to fill
the boats) is a testament to the
depth of the program.
At the Admiral's Cup, Stanford
sailors had trouble adjusting to
the 420, a heavier boat than the
usual Flying Junior. In the same
format as the Admiral's Cup, the

three division Thompson Trophy
will sail Flying Juniors in A com
petition, 420's in B, and the sin
gle-manned Laser in the C divi
sion. On day two, racers in the A
and B division will trade boats,
giving four Cardinal sailors expe
rience in 4205.
With experience being the main
objective, Bourdow is sending
three freshmen to Connecticut.
Phil Barrow will skipper in B divi
sion with fellow freshman Barry
Kang crewing in A division.
Rounding out the trio, Danny
Zimbaldi will be at the helm of the
Laser in division C. The senior
leader of the bunch will be A divi
sion skipper Rolf Kaiser, a senior.
Sophomore Don Chennavasin will
crew with Barrow in the B divi
sion.
Bourdow has high hopes for
the entire team. Stanford is shoot
ing for a top-five showing overall
and especially for two of the

promising freshmen.
The lineup for the upcoming
national championships is by no
means set in stone. Zimbaldi has
been battling' for a spot on the
playoff roster throughout the sea
son and Bourdow feels the
Thompson Cup will be "good men
tal preparation."
Barrow will also get a chance to
spread his wings over the week
end. The combination of Stan
ford's remarkable depth and
strong group of freshman sailors
has limited Barrow's participation
in big regattas. Barrow's hard
work will pay off this weekend.
"This weekend will be vety valu
able experience for Phil," Bourdow
said. "This is long overdue."
Although the waters in Con
necticut are much colder than San
Diego's ocean, in its pursuit of
coast to coast success, Stanford
sailing hopes they are equally
friendly.
