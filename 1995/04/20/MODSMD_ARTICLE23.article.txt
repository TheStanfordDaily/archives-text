California called it the Big Rematch. However
Stanford gave the Golden Bears the Big Broom and .
monstrous comeback. Cal experienced the Big Choki
by failing to convert six match points in two separati
doubles matches that could have given the Bears tlx
victory.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal (19-2 overall, 8-0 in tin
Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Division) clinchn
the league title as Stanford swept No. 9 Cal for tin
season, winning a 5-4 nail-biter in Berkeley yesterday
Stanford and Cal split the singles matches 3-3
sending the decision into the doubles competition h
both the Nos. 2 and 3 matches Stanford doubles team:
fought back from late deficits to clinch the match fo
the Cardinal.
"We've never done this before, where we were dov* i
to so many match points and came back to win," coa<!
Frank Brennan said. I thought we were tough, bu
now I know we are.
"To do this against anybody is wonderful, but to d<
it against Cal is just that much better."
A win at the No. 2 doubles position sealed the Car
dinal's eighth straight dual-match victory an<
snapped Cal's win streak at seven. Senior Kirn Sim
by and sophomore Emily Burt (10-2) faced a 5-4 defu-i
in the third set when the No. 3 squad of froshmut
Julie Scott and junior Beth Berris (2-0) tied the du
match with a 3-6, 7-6, 6-0 come-from-behind win ow
Nicole Elliott and Jennifer Poulos.
The Cardinal No. 2 squad fought off two mate!
points in that game, traded breaks and then rxt n i<
its opponents to the decisive tie-breaker. Again, Si .
by and Burt managed to stay alive, eventually takinj
the match, 7-5, 1-6, 7-6.
Scott and Berris provided as
much drama in their battle as
Miko Ando and Vera Vitels
threatened to take the entire
match within the second set with
match point before dropping the
second-set tie-breaker. Scott and
Berris then rolled in the third set,
taking the momentum after Cal's
middle-set choke.
Cal did take the No. 1 match,
which pitted the No. 6 team in the
country, the Bears' Keirsten Alley
and Pam Nelson, against the No.
11 team, Stanford's squad of
sophomore Katie Schlukebir and
freshman Ania Bleszynski (11-4).
Cal cruised in straight sets 6-3, 6-
2.
National powerhouses locked
horns again in the No. 1 singles
match as No. 10 Schlukebir (13-7)
clashed with No. 13 Nelson. The
Cardinal Ail-American dropped
that match in straight sets as
well, 6-3, 6-2. Shasby (15-4), in
her second straight match at the
No. 2 slot, continued to turn
heads as she threw down Poulos,
6-0, 6-3. Poulos currently sits at

No. 14 in the national rankings.
"Kim Shasby was not to be
denied today," Brennan said.
"She ripped through singles and
kept that doubles team alive."
Bleszynski (10-7) adjusted well
to the No. 3 spot, snapping her
losing streak with a straight-set
victory over Alley, 7-5, 6-4.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva (16-
3) uncharacteristically dropped a
match in straight sets as Elliott
played a tough second set in seiz
ing the match 7-5, 6-0.
Scott matched up against
Vitels, a former No. 1 player recu
perating from injury. The Cardi
nal freshman took a close first
frame 7-5. She could not manage
to get over the hump, however, as
Vitels gave the Bears their third
singles match at 5-7, 6-4, 6-4.
Berris, in the lineup for ailing
senior Amy Chiminello, stayed
undefeated for the season, down
ing Ando, 6-4, 3-6, 6-0.
"I've always had alot of confi
dence in Beth," Brennan said.
"She's in kind of a bad spot being
injured with everyone else playing
so well.
"I kept saying to her, 'Beth,
hang in there. When you come
back it's going to be great.' And
sure enough it has."
