California called it the Big Rematch. However
Stanford gave the Golden Bears the Big Broom and .
monstrous comeback. Cal experienced the Big Choki
by failing to convert six match points in two separati
doubles matches that could have given the Bears tlx
victory.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal (19-2 overall, 8-0 in tin
Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Division) clinchn
the league title as Stanford swept No. 9 Cal for tin
season, winning a 5-4 nail-biter in Berkeley yesterday
Stanford and Cal split the singles matches 3-3
sending the decision into the doubles competition h
both the Nos. 2 and 3 matches Stanford doubles team:
fought back from late deficits to clinch the match fo
the Cardinal.
"We've never done this before, where we were dov* i
to so many match points and came back to win," coa<!
Frank Brennan said. I thought we were tough, bu
now I know we are.
"To do this against anybody is wonderful, but to d<
it against Cal is just that much better."
A win at the No. 2 doubles position sealed the Car
dinal's eighth straight dual-match victory an<
snapped Cal's win streak at seven. Senior Kirn Sim
by and sophomore Emily Burt (10-2) faced a 5-4 defu-i
in the third set when the No. 3 squad of froshmut
Julie Scott and junior Beth Berris (2-0) tied the du
match with a 3-6, 7-6, 6-0 come-from-behind win ow
Nicole Elliott and Jennifer Poulos.
The Cardinal No. 2 squad fought off two mate!
points in that game, traded breaks and then rxt n i<
its opponents to the decisive tie-breaker. Again, Si .
by and Burt managed to stay alive, eventually takinj
the match, 7-5, 1-6, 7-6.
