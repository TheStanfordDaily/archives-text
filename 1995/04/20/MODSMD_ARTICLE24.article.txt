# Men will make home golf debut, finale
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Now more than seven months into its sea
son, the Stanford men's golf team will finally
play its home opener this weekend. Unfortu
nately, its first tournament at home will be its
last as well.
The second-ranked Cardinal will begin
competition in its only showing here on the
Farm on Friday morning as it hosts a 25-team
field in the U.S. Collegiate Invitational. The
team's relatively short home season can be
attributed to recent construction on the
greens of its home course, which was closed
for a good portion of the season.
Many of the participating schools are from
the East Coast; the moderately competitive
field is highlighted by top 20 teams Arizona

State and Tulsa. The Sun Devils defeated a
struggling Stanford squad last weekend at its
Thunderbird Invitational, finishing the tour
nament in second place with the Cardinal back
at sixth.
"It shouid be tough," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "There will be some good teams
there and each of them will be a force."
The event provides Stanford a chance to
solidify its standings among the West Coast
teams. The team travels up to Washington
next weekend for the Pacific 10 Champi
onships, which will be followed by District 8
regional championships. This weekend's play
will help to establish rankings which will be
used to determine how the team will be seeded
in the regionals. Stanford should easily quali
fy as one of the top 12 teams from the district,
which includes Washington, Oregon, Califor-

nia, Arizona, western New Mexico am;
Hawaii.
"This tournament is definitely import ;i
for all the teams here," Goodwin said. "It ;;i\
all of us a chance to play against each oth< r.
see how everyone else is playing and also to
show how we stand compared to the other
teams."
Despite the tournament's obvious imp<
tance to the team's standing, its primary -ii:
nificance is of a more emotional nature. It will
mark the final home appearance of the Cardi
nal's four senior All-Americans Notah Ik .
111, Casey Martin, Steve Burdick and Willi.:
Yanagisawa.
"Of course this is going to be a very senti
mental tournament for us," Goodwin said
