# Baseball to face surprising Bears with first on line
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
The California baseball team is standing in
unfamiliar territory — first in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division. Today, however, the
Golden Bears return to the familiar confines of
Sunken Diamond to take on Stanford at 2:30 p.m.
in the opener of a critical four-game series.
California has only one conference crown to its
credit, a shared title back in 1980. Since then, Cal
has earned two appearances in the College World
Series but hasn't registered a better record than
its cross-bay rival since 1989.
This year, while the overall 22-18 record is still
one loss worse than the Cardinal, Cal's 13-7 Six-
Pac mark has placed them atop the powerful con
ference. Cal — picked no better than fourth in pre
season polls behind Stanford, USC and Arizona
State — has rebounded from a slow nonconference
start to keep a half-game lead over USC and one
game advantage over Stanford.
After beginning the year 7-9 and then losing its
Six-Pac opener to Stanford 7-0 on March 4, the
Golden Bears rolled off seven consecutive confer
ence wins, beginning with a 6-4 decision over Stan
ford at Sunken Diamond.
The winner in that contest, sophomore right
hander Keith Evans, has dropped his last three
outings after a 5-2 start. The staff s ace since his
arrival last year, Evans hurled the only complete
game of his career against the Cardinal. His 57
strikeouts lead the squad and place him fourth in
the Six-Pac.
Evans will most likely duel Stanford junior
southpaw Mike Robbins. The versatile Robbins
