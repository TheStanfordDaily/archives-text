# Baseball to face surprising Bears with first on line
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
The California baseball team is standing in
unfamiliar territory — first in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division. Today, however, the
Golden Bears return to the familiar confines of
Sunken Diamond to take on Stanford at 2:30 p.m.
in the opener of a critical four-game series.
California has only one conference crown to its
credit, a shared title back in 1980. Since then, Cal
has earned two appearances in the College World
Series but hasn't registered a better record than
its cross-bay rival since 1989.
This year, while the overall 22-18 record is still
one loss worse than the Cardinal, Cal's 13-7 Six-
Pac mark has placed them atop the powerful con
ference. Cal — picked no better than fourth in pre
season polls behind Stanford, USC and Arizona
State — has rebounded from a slow nonconference
start to keep a half-game lead over USC and one
game advantage over Stanford.
After beginning the year 7-9 and then losing its
Six-Pac opener to Stanford 7-0 on March 4, the
Golden Bears rolled off seven consecutive confer
ence wins, beginning with a 6-4 decision over Stan
ford at Sunken Diamond.
The winner in that contest, sophomore right
hander Keith Evans, has dropped his last three
outings after a 5-2 start. The staff s ace since his
arrival last year, Evans hurled the only complete
game of his career against the Cardinal. His 57
strikeouts lead the squad and place him fourth in
the Six-Pac.
Evans will most likely duel Stanford junior
southpaw Mike Robbins. The versatile Robbins

will make his fifth start to go
with nine relief appearances on
the season. Robbins has gone 2-
1 since taking injured sopho
more Jason Middlebrook's spot
in the rotation.
The Cardinal was also miss
ing junior left-hander Dan Reed

in last weekend's sweep by USC.
While Stanford has been making
do with a patchwork rotation
and the steady presence of
freshman Kyle Peterson, Reed
may return to the mound short
ly-
After the Trojan sweep,
USC's first at Sunken since
1979, the Cardinal plummeted
in the national rankings. Stan
ford dropped 16 spots to 25th in
the latest Collegiate Baseball
poll, five notches behind the No

20 Bears. The Cardinal also
sank to 21st, down from 16th in
the Baseball America poll, which
does not feature Cal.
If Stanford's season-long
three-game losing skid does not
end today, the Cardinal will
have three more chances to get
back into the win column. Fri
day's game, a 2:30 p.m. start,
will be played across the Bay at
Evans Diamond, where Cal
sports an 11-7 mark. Peterson
and freshman Ryan Drese are

slated to toss the first pitches in
the 100 th Six-Pac meeting
between the rivals (Stanford
leads 64-34 in conference play).
Saturday's contest heads back
to Sunken Diamond at 1 p.m.,
while the finale will take place
Sunday at 1 p.m. in Berkeley.
Sunday's contest will be
broadcast live to a national audi
ence, locally on Sports Channel
Pacific. The Cardinal has split
its first two television appear
ances this season.
