# Tonya Harding focuses attention on struggling softball squad at UCLA
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
The only thing task that might be more
arduous than facing a bunch of ferocious
Wildcats in the Arizona desert is meeting a
team of hungry bears and the ever-dangerous
Tonya Harding in smoggy southern Califor
nia. Unfortunately for the young and inexpe
rienced Stanford softball team, that is what
the squad must do when they travel to UCLA
to play the top-ranked Bruins in a double
header at 1 p.m.
Stanford (10-24 overall, 1-15 in the Pacific
10 Conference) is still reeling from an Arizona
road trip that rudely introduced them to
championship-caliber softball. The two-time
defending champion Arizona Wildcats swept a
doubleheader against the Cardinal by a com
bined score of 32-1 with an amazing display of
offensive firepower.
Arizona racked up 32 hits in two games
against Stanford, scoring 15 runs in the sec
ond inning of game one en route to a 25-0 vic
tory.
Despite Arizona's seemingly perfect play,
UCLA poses an even bigger threat to the Car
dinal. The top-ranked Bruins own a 3-1 record
against Arizona this year, including a double
header sweep two weekends ago in Arizona,
where the Wildcats seldom lose.
Although the Bruins can't match Arizona's

offensive attack, UCLA frustrates its oppo
nents by not allowing them to score. Against
the Wildcats, UCLA pitching thoroughly
stymied Wildcat first baseman Laura
Espinoza, who leads the nation with 26 home
runs. In the doubleheader against the Bruins,
Espinoza went O-for-8. Against Stanford this
past weekend, by contrast, Espinoza was 6-
for-7 with three doubles and 5 RBIs.

They were No. 1 before
they got [Harding] and now
they're just that much better'
— Sandy Pearce

Even more impressive is UCLA's silencing
of Ail-American Amy Chellevold. The Wildcat
leadofT batter only managed one hit the entire
season against UCLA, while she collected four
hits and four walks in two games vs. Stanford,
wreaking havoc on the Cardinal defense.
UCLA's pitching staff, deep and experi
enced when the season started, was bolstered
considerably by the addition of New Zealand
national team member Tonya Harding at the
beginning of spring quarter. In a related story,
U.S. Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan
has announced that she will not attend the
doubleheader.

"She's just awesome," Stanford coach
Sandy Pearce said of Harding, noting that she
just shares the name with the famed figure
skater. "They were No. 1 before they got her,
and now they're just that much better."
Harding's presence is particulary ominous
for a Stanford team that has struggled offen
sively in Pac-10 play. Against Arizona, the
Cardinal managed only seven hits in the two
games.
"We can be a good hitting team," Pearce
said. "We just haven't been at various times
this season."
The most distressing part about this season
for Stanford is that, despite playing well at
times, the Cardinal has often suffered lapses
at big moments at the end of close games.
Against UCLA, however, that would be a
blessing in itself for a second-year varsity
squad playing the big bad Bruins for the first
time.
"They're a great team. They're really solid
defensively and they obviously have great
pitching. It'll be exciting to go down there and
play them."
On Friday, the Cardinal traves to Loyola
Marymount for a rematch with the Lions.
Earlier this season, Stanford split a double
header with Loyola.
"It'll be really important to try and get a
couple wins after playing Arizona and UCLA
pretty much back-to-back," Pearce said.
