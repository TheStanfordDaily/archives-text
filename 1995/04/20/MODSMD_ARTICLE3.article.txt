Four sophomores have been charged
with misdemeanor trespassing for an al
leged March 17 foray into the president's
office â€” making this the third time this
month criminal charges have been lev
eled against Stanford students.
Michael Ebstyne, Jonathan
Garfinkel, Rebecca Nesbitt and Rachel
Rucker were all found by police when an
alarm was tripped at about 10:55 p.m. in
Building 10 last month.
According to the police report, the
students were found in the main office
area of the building. When the deputy
motioned for the students to come to
ward him, they asked where they were
and how they could get out of the build
ing, the report stated. The deputy then
informed them that they were in the
president's office.

Rucker said yesterday that the group
had been exploring the attics of the Main
Quad for over an hour and needed to get
out in order to go to the restroom. The
only accessible door was through what
turned out to be the president's office,
she said.
"When we got out, we were very
happy," Ebstyne said yesterday. "We
didn't know we were in the president's
office."
As to why the group did not try to exit
the attic through the door they had orig
inally entered, Rucker said that "we had
gone so far, it would have been pointless
to turn back."
"We weren't dressed in black or any
thing," Ebstyne said.
The group gained access to the
Quad's attics through a door in the
men's bathroom on the second floor of
the religious studies building, Rucker
said.

"Honestly, we were just feeling ad
venturous," she said.
The report stated that the four were
celebrating Garfinkel's birthday, which
is in fact on March 17, according to court
documents.
Police originally released the stu
dents without arresting them.
In another unrelated incident, two
physics majors were caught and arrested
for their illegal entry into the president's
office. Clark Bailey and Jose Alcorta pled
guilty to charges of misdemeanor tres
passing on April 13. Both received sen
tences of 100 hours of community ser
vice and informal probation for six
months.
Warrants in the amount of $500 have
been issued for the four sophomores' ar
rests. However, when the group went to
turn themselves in yesterday, clerks at
courthouse couid not find the
warrants to an administra
tive error. Stanford Police Capt.

Raoui Niemeyer said. "There was
