The American Academy of Arts and Sciences last
Friday announced the election of 162 new fellows
and 21 foreign honorary members, including eight
members of the Stanford faculty elected according
to their contributions in their respective fields.
The new members of the academy from Stanford
are: Anne Ehrlich, senior research scientist in bio
logical sciences; Avram Goldstein, professor emeri
tus in molecular pharmacology; Steven Harris, pro
fessor of electrical engineering and chair of the
Department of Applied Physics; and John Hen
nessy, professor of electrical engineering and also a
computer science professor.
Others honored are Charles Prescott, professor
of physics at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter; William Reynolds, professor of mechanical engi
neering; John Shoven, professor of economics and
the dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences;
and Susan Treggiari, professor in the School of
Humanities and Sciences and professor of classics.
Nominated to the academy by a current member,

each of these professors survived a pool of 800 to
900 applicants and several different election ballots
to be selected as one of the academy's 162 new
members.
Established in Cambridge, Mass., in 1780 by
John Adams to recognize scholars according to their
accomplishments and contributions to science,
scholarship, public affairs and the arts, the academy
consists of 3,300 fellows and 550 foreign honorary
members. The body now includes 190 members
associated with the Stanford community.
Treggiari said she was extremely surprised and
honored because she did not know she was even
being considered by the academy. "I'm still stupe
fied â€” I just found out about [my election] yester
day," she said.
Treggiari called her election an "honor to the
field." There are not many ancient historians select
ed among the historian pool, she said.
Ehrlich's election was also a "complete surprise"
to her, because she, as Treggiari, was not aware of
her nomination. Usually candidates are not aware
they have been nominated, so the news comes as a
big surprise, she said.
