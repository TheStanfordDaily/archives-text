# Ned's Atomic Dustbin is up to new tricks
## 
### Taylor Antrim 
Alex, bassist and sometime
vocalist for the aggro brit
pop unit Ned's Atomic
Dustbin, tells me he's a little in
timidated by the speaker phone.
"I've never used one of these be-

fore," he says. I can hear him moving around
the room, his voice echoing and fading."(lan
you hear me still? I low about now?"
I tell him I can hear him. Hearing and un
derstanding, though, are two different things.
His reverberating British lilt jumbles and
stumbles in my ear. Some unintelligible sell
talk blows by me unheard.
Alex's speaker-phone technophobia seems
somehow indicative of the uncertain success
of Ned's. It's been two years since "Arc You
Normal?" their last semi successful album
and I'd nearly forgotten about the band.
They seemed to have gone the way of the
dodo. Alex's sell conscious stumbling at the
beginning of our interview seemed to torbode
a dubious return of the fun band of yesteryear.
Last minute gropings for success often result
in half-hearted, semi-inspired tunefulness
anyway.
1 ask Alex about the title of the new album
"Brainbloodvolume," hoping the easy ques
tion will shove some ground under his feet.
"The title came from something we read
about," Alex says. " The art of self-trepanation
(sic). You drill a small hole in your own skull.
It gives you a child-like mind, a permanent
high. We actually met an old woman who had
done it, and she's still living."
I'm a little caught off guard. Not a standard
answer, and not what I had expected from
washed up play pop veterans. "Are any of you
planning on it? I ask.
"I've actually already done it. Its alvsoluteb
amazing.'

Alex's voice is fuller now, unhesitating, and
for a moment 1 take him seriously. Really? A
hole in your head? Then I hear his thin,
British laugh. I realize who's putting on who.
Ned's may have a few tricks in store after all.
"You should try it,"he says.
Brainbloodvolume'' begins with "All I
Ask of Myself is That I I lold Together"
a punching, pulverizing track that
makes any old fans of Ned's Atomic Dustbin
wonder who their listening to. The spacer,
near whine of the guitar is the same, and
singer Jonn's voice is familiar, but the crush
ing, industrial edged beat comes from way
out in left field. By the end you feel sucker
punched. It's a great experience, and one that
should have warned me that Ned's wasn't up
to the same old play.
Alex tells me, "It's been two years since the
last album and I think we've grown up a lot.
Everyone in the band has been influenced by
a lot of different music. I've been listening to a
lot of dance and techno and some of the oth
ers have been listening to harder stuff."
l he wide variety of influences shows
through tracks like the strange sample-laden
"l loote," the jingle-jangle "Talk Me Down,"
and the furious and dramatic "Traffic."
"We didn't want to stay in the same place,"
Alex tells me, "but we also didn't want to lose
oui fan base. We ended up not going in one
single direction. 1 think a lot of things are
(.hanging in music; people have wider tastes.
And I think that's reflected on the album."

Alex sounds like a salesman, and I don't
blame him. The new album's only problem is
its tendency to get confused and go in too
many directions at once. What Alex tells me is
variety could also be called disorienting dissi
pation. One track, "Premonition," begins
brilliantly with seared acoustic jacklighting:
Fast, light and hurtful, then it descends into
impersonal techno-by-numbers. And the
juxtaposition of the Connells-esque soothe
pop of I'alk Me Down" with the danccable
meathead dementia of "Borehole' sent me
spinning.
I ask Alex about these swift, careening
shifts in sound. "Yeah," lie savs, .ig.iin impres
sive and confident, once again the master of
his own joke. "There's something for every
one there."
In l l )91 with "God I odder" Ned's Atomic
Dustbin broke upon a waning British pop
scene as its much-needed savior. The
album delighted with blisteringly fast dance
beats and floated on its own frothy surface of
play. The songs, especially the two wildly suc
cessful singles "Kill your Television" and
"Grey Cell Green," hit hard, but they left you
rejuvenated, light-headed and happy. The
two bassists, Alex and Mat, played off each
other, laying sturdy forceful foundations to
the upbeat melodies.
I ask Alex if those songs instant success put
pressure on the band to follow them up.
"I suppose it did make us a little nervous,
but we'd been playing those songs for such a

lung time that when the album
was finally released we were al
ready looking ahead to the next
one. It's important not to be intlu
enced by what people want to
hear."

Their sophomore effort, though, seemed to
do just that. Amid growing grunge hysteria,
Ned's Atomic Dustbin recorded "Are You Nor
mal?" an uneasy album that seemed to mix
hard edges with mindless pop instincts.
I ask Alex about rumors of band disagree
ments. "We got sick of the songs quite quick,
he says. "There was lots of pressure on the per
sonalities because we recorded then toured im
mediately. Afterwards we really got to chill out
a bit and let the music come at its own speed
I rontman Jonn has described the band s
"chill-out" in different terms. "We viewed om
career as a big merry-go-round, and we wen
all just out to have a good laugh. But then
came a point where we realized we need to re
evaluate what we were doing and dig a lot
deeper to find out exactly what we were trying
to achieve."
"Brainbloodvolume" does seem to raise the
stakes. A song like "Stuck" dramatizes what
was once a kind of musical kidding around. Its
contemplative, forceful and intense. This new
found maturity is risky, but overall it raises the
band's credibility.
The hallmark commitment to playfulness
however, has not died completely. I ask Alex
about the future of the band, and he responds
with his characteristic brand of you-don't
know I'm not kidding humor.
"I've no idea what the next album will
sound like. We never know until it is finished.
In 10 years, though, we'll all probably be living
in a mental home. I'll be strapped to a chair,
completely insane."
