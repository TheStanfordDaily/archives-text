# Institute for
## Music Making Machine Musical Arts Benefit Concert at Stanford 
### Allison Otto 
JT TTitil recently, all-female bands were pret-
M /ty much an anomaly in the contempo
rary music field. With the emergence
however of such female artists as the Breeders,
Hole and the Indigo Girls, female performers
are finally receiving some of the recognition
they deserve.
Part of this recognition is perhaps due to the
Institute for the Musical Arts (IMA), a non
profit multicultural organization that sup
ports women pursuing careers in the music
business. They charge minimal fees for the
use of their recording studio in Bodega,
Calif., and they offer numerous workshops
and performances for female musicians.
On stage
This weekend's IMA concert, sponsored by
the Women's Collective, highlights some of the
up-and-coming female performers in the San
Francisco area. Implemented as one of the
many events in conjunction with Herstory
Week, the IMA concert features three all-fe
male bands performing a variety of musical
genres.
The three bands scheduled to perform will
specifically address female issues.
"These bands come with a message. Their
music addresses such political issues as violence
against women, labor rights and gay rights,"
said senior Maria Mireles, who also helped co
ordinate the concert. Mireles also hopes the
concert will raise awareness for Herstory
Week on campus.

Three bands from across the land
MAIKO, an all-female multicultural
percussion group, will open the con- 112

cert Saturday night. It combines
rhythm, poetry and resonating
African drums with a forth
right approach.
"These hips have been
known to spin a man around,"
sang one of MAIKO's members
in a recent performance as she
proudly pointed out her full-fig
ured body. MAIKO projects an
affirmative and accepting image
of the female figure often ig
nored by a society that praises
extreme dieting and slim bodies.
"When MAIKO performed
they brought down the house.
You're being throbbed with it,"
Luo said enthusiastically of the
performance. Luo added that
even though she wasn't a big
drum fan, the authenticity and
infectiousness of MAIKO con
verted her instantly.
Excitement about the up
coming concert also extended to
the performers. "I'm really excit
ed about it coming up," said Wil
low Pearson, Stanford Class of
1992 and member ofVoices, one
of the only lesbian choral en-

sembles in the country.
Formerly a member of Everyday

People, Pearson describes Voices' songs as an
"eclectic mix reflecting the lives of women."
Voices seeks out a variety of cultures and per
forms a diverse medley of songs, including jazz,
gospel-influenced folk, madrigal, blues and
chant. "The

songs we
sing re-

flect the diverse fabric of lesbian identities. Our
two-fold purpose combines lesbian pride and
visibility."
Summarized as "something akin to the Indi
go Girls" by Luo,
The Other Side will close the Saturday night

concert. Com
posed of
for-

mer Stanford grad Carin Anderson and Chris
Weipert, this acoustical duo plays in numerous
clubs (including St. Michael's Art Cafe in Palo
Alto) around the Bay Area and are currently
working on a new CD.
The Other Side addresses women's issues in
a more subtle manner than MAIKO and Voic
es. With lyrics like, "We're here to stay," they af
firmatively recognize lesbianism and its pres
ence in society.
Weipert and Anderson grew up in musical
families and continued their singing careers
into adulthood. Having met through a mutual
friend, the two soon began singing together
and discovered their unique harmony and
complementary singing abilities.
"They're just such cool people," Luo said.
"[They] blend together incredibly."
IMA: past and future

Founded in 1987, the IMA Cultural
Center / Studio Retreat became firmly
established in 1991 at Bodega in what
was once an old artist's colony. A group
of women involved in the music busi
ness began the IMA after noticing that
the popularity of new bands depended
a lot on one's connections and not on
one's abilities. The IMA hopes to
change this.
"They're really unique," said Pearson.
"I don't know any other organization

like it."
IMA offers a medley of concerts twice
monthly by respected female performers. Rem
iniscent of MTV's "Unplugged" sessions, these
concerts provide an informal setting followed
by a question and answer period before the be
ginning of the second set. Workshops are also
offered, covering such topics as composition,
theory and arranging, instrumental instruc
tion and concert production. Previous IMA

board members include Bonnie Raitt, An
gela Davis, and the late Audrey Lourd.
"IMA gives aspiring musicians the
chance to mingle, swap ideas, and help
launch their musical careers," Luo said.
{

J s part of Herstory Week, the con-
Zl cert will naturally highlight the
L JL efforts of women and their ac
complishments in the music field.
"The concert is a celebration of
women," said Mireles. "[Our
L goal] is to raise awareness for the
I Women's Collective, the musi
' cians involved, and the IMA."
Mireles added that although the
concert will honor female perform
ers, everyone is encouraged to at
tend.
"It's going to be a night of in
credibly good music," said senior In
grid Luo, co-coordinator of the con
cert. "This isn't women's issues per

se. It's women's issues through art
I think each person will get their own

message from it."
