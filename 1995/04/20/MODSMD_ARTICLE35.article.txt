# Focus on: iUna Mas!

For those who think you have to stand in
line over a salad bar to get something quick
and tasty to eat at the Stanford Shopping
Center, think again — and add [Una Mas! to
your dining options. Located on the south
east side of the complex, the; Una Mas!
taqueria offers good, cheap Mexican food
and a splashy, casual decor.
With faded paper pinatas, a burnt-out
neon Corona sign and graffiti-inspired

spray-painted murals, the
restaurant has a quirky
California flair. The best
offerings are the fish,
salmon, and shrimp dish
es (like their Grilled
Salmon Taco at $2.95, or
the ('rispy Baja Style Taco
at 52.45), especially the
Shrimp Burrito with
pinto beans, rice, "y salsa
tresca ($6.95).
A caution: II you like
hot food, bring your own
chile. Our salsa gradation
test determined that
"medium" was only
slightly hotter than "hot"
salsa (with a faint barbe
cue flavor), and "mild"
wasn't worth the effort. As
friend K. from Louisiana
noted, "If it doesn't clear
sinuses, it won't make it."

Don't worry — even with its small touch
es, the restaurant maintains its fast-food flair,
with a Bookstore-style line/maze to order
food and a Spanglish menu on the wall above
the cashiers. Our favorites: the "Nito Burri

to" ($1.99) and "El Cheapo Taco" with only
rice, beans, and salsa ($1.25). If you can get
past the names, the food is good, with super
fresh veggies and ample garnishes of gua
camole and sour cream. The "Roasted

Chilies +" burrito boasts strips of over-roast
ed fresh chile, with black beans, rice and corn
salsa ($3.55), and is the way to go for those
not overly fond of cilantro.
Other things are harder to ignore. Like the
occasionally audible music, and a cigar
smoking 14 year-old at the table next to us.
But maybe the kid had a point — the
Strawberry Margarita made with Agave wine
($2.25) left something to be desired. Alcohol,
to be exact — our mixed drinks were border
line F.ANAHs.
All said, jUna Mas! has quick, efficient
service and hearty, filling dishes. It's the per
fect place to go for a study break, or to avoid
those frightening end-of-the-quarter meals
with food service. Plus, it doesn't matter if
you maxed out your Visa at Gap on the way
over: ;Una Mas! is cash only. So bring an ap
petite and kick back and enjoy your meal.
