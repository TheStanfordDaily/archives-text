# SIOUXSIE & THE BANSHEES
## In Concert 
### Elisabeth Morse 
Creeping up the backstairs
slinking into dark stalls
shapeless ami slumped in hath chairs
furtive eyes peep out of holes
She has many guises
she'll do what you want her to
playing dead and sweet submission
cracks the whip deadpan on cue"
Its difficult to write <i review of a show
which was moreot .111 overall experience than
a musical revelation.
II 1 could, I would insist on cheesy Hash
back music to accompany this article.
I remember when I lust really took notice
of Siouxsie. It was the summer after the tenth
grade, and I was hanging out in LA. tor a tew
days with a couple of friends. I laving lived 111
the cultureless town of Philadelphia for the
previous three years, I wasOD'ingon KROQ,
a radio station which now seems to represent
the top 40of "alternative music" in a most ju
venile fashion.
But I would sit day after day at the pool of
my host's house, headphones a fixture of my
outfit. I his was before I decided it was moral
ly wrong to have a suntan and wear anything
but black. As I abused my melanin, "Kiss
Them for Me" was played usually two or
three times an hour. It was cool. I could pic
ture Siouxsie slithering around in her long
yellow dress, kissing suave men, storing up

invitations to glamorous parties.
Gradually, I realized that this was the same
person who used to drape herself in noir —
attitude pouring from her like smoke from a
clove cigarette. I had heard rumors that she
used to collaborate with Robert Smith

(anybody remember the Crea
tures?). I knew that she was

beautiful and elegant, and
tall. Siouxsie's voice was

monumental enough
to send shivers cours
ing through the most
ardent of cynics.
So, years after i
having ensconced \
myself in the dark
side of things, I did

not know what to ex
pect of Siouxsie, the F.ve
of the goth scene. After
all, 011 her new album, |
" The Rapture," she had '
gone so far as to collabo
rate with Morrissey, pos
sibly the whiniest, most
obnoxiously pretentious
partner she could have
chosen.

Dressed respectively in w
leather and lace, friend D '
and I trepidatiously made our
way to the War field. Traffic
wasn't too bad, and parking

wasn't a problem, except for the at
tendant with a power trip who in-

sisted on guiding us into our
space like one of those guys

who directs airplanes with
big orange wands.

We emerged from
our vehicle, locked

it, and proceeded
to snake our way

around the cor
ner, trying to
observe other

somberly-clad people without seeming as it
we were actually looking. When we acciden
tally made eye contact, we would glare and
brush past. One loses goth points lor obvious
curiosity about anyone that isn't famous or at
least notorious.

I love your cape,
said one girl with flam
ing red hair, as she
k handed me a flier

with a picture ot
Peter Murphy

on it. Nobody
has ever de-

As we entered the War field, we were accost
ed by a barrage of acquaintances, friends, ene
mies, past-lovers, and people who we thought
we had met somewhere before but weren't
quite sure. I) pulled out a pink cigarette with a
gold filter, and happily contributed to the
clove-scented smokiness. We socialized,
meaning we issued compliments about outfits
— "oli what a beautiful corset, wow, what kind
of hair dye do you use, yes, purple looks beau
tiful on you ..." We played eye-tag with cute
boys in lots of black makeup, and we com
pared notes on the current club scene.
The opening band, Spiritualized, plaved
an entirely mediocre set which we dul\ ig
nored. Instead we wandered around the
lobby, insisting on the need for fashion police
who might chastise those dressed in too
much PVC (or vinyl). Plastigoths are tack\
Finally, Siouxsie made her appearance. I
was a bit ambivalent about her outfit a
black catsuit with a silver-shimmery kind of
covering thing probably designed to li
"figure flaws" (said I) politically). I also c;u
remember exactly what she played; it <
mostly her old classics such as "( hristii
and "Dear Prudence."
The crowd was pleasantly cra/\ dan
along, singing along, smiling even whei
was off-tune. When someone threw a s\v i;
at her, she exclaimed, "I've never been mi
of a woolly girl." She used a gutted blow <Ji
as an instrument, sinuously and continu
ly writhed, and played a few encores.

I he show was really loud, anu m\
ears were ringing when I left. But 1 w.is,
disappointed. Siouxsie is still amazing
ly cool, she's a brilliant performer, sL
i is immortal in her own world. As niv

friend Casey, who called me first
thing the next morning to chat
about the show, remarked, "She

were going to get scuffed.
