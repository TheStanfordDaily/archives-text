# Reliving those teenage years, Vegetarian Meat mined the braces-and-pimples era for some weird but nifty music
## 
### Mike Noren 
If "Vegetarian Meat" sounds like a band
name a 14-year-old would think of, it's be
cause Alex McAulay and Manish Kalvako
ta thought of it when they started the band at
that very age.
"(At the time) we thought it was a really
funny name," says McAulay, now six years
older. "It's sort of silly when 1 think about it
now. But 1 think it sort of fits the music."
It fits the music because, in a way, Vegetar
ian Meat's debut "Let's Pet" sounds like the
kind of music a 14-year-old would think of.
McAulay and Kalvakota are in college now,
but their simple songs of infatuation and
frustration walk the line between childhood
innocence and teenage cynicism, spicing their
sugary pop with spurts of raw intensity. Yet
they steer clear of generic teen angst and in
stead opt for a light-headed vibe that breathes
surprising freshness into otherwise tired

topics.
"It sounds cheesy, but it's the same
old rock and roll topics — sex, drugs
and rock and roll," McAulay says.

"Well, we don't get much sex, but
we write about it."
Crazy joke of a band
Down-to-earth yet spacey,
Vegetarian Meat attacks tradi
tional pop from all directions.
The charm of "Let's Pet" lies in the
duo's short attention span —
they're just too jumpy to stick to
anyone style. They'll sound like
Devoone minute and Dinosaur
Jr. the next, or they'll put the ir
resistibly sweet "Trip" side-by
side with "Ipecac Ho," their
rowdy punk track about getting
too drunk at a party. McAulay
calls it "weirdo rock and roll"
and says it's the product of six
years in his basement spent ,
saying and playing whatever
came to mind.
"When we started the band,
it was really horrible-sound- t
ing," he says."The lyrics were fl
just terrible. It sounded like j
one of those punk bands where *
it's just little kids fucking
around."
Nevertheless, by age 16, Vege
tarian Meat were playing 18-and-

over gigs in their hometown of Day- ™
ton, Ohio. And even when they
weren't well-received, they were having
fun.

"One time we played this club, and it was
totally deserted," McAulay recalls. "But in

back, Kim Deal (Breeders singer) and Jim
Greer (music critic and current Guided By
Voices bassist) were like the only two people
in there. And we started playing our songs,
and they got this look of horror on their faces
like it was the worst thing they'd ever heard,
and they ran out. We were pretty happy about
that. We'd scared them away."
It was probably their backwards pride that
kept them going so long, and over time they
refined their craft into the distinctive brand of
basement pop that eventually landed them a
record deal with the New York-based indie
label No. 6.
"It somehow evolved from a crazy joke

into a real band," McAula)
says. "Somehow

it just kept going and going and getting bigger
and bigger."
'Weird but nifty'
But at least until their anticipated summer
tour, the group has to plan their rock and roll
careers around their schoolwork. McAulay is a
junior at Brown studying English and creative
writing, and Kalvakota is a sophomore at
Boston University studying political science.
For his classes at Brown, McAulay writes
wild works of fiction which he considers the
literary equivalent of Veg. Meat songs —
"weird but nifty." Yet while his stories are fic
tion, he describes his music as "99 percent au-

tobiographical" — from details
of his two-dollar

sticker atlas to

a love
song

about his tenth grade trip to Germany.
"Well I actually didn't take a 10th grade
trip to Germany," he admits. "But some of my
friends did take a 1 Oth grade trip to Spain, and
1 knew someone else who had just been to
Germany." But even when he bends the truth,
McAulay offers honest insight into his
teenage years, with vivid details that are both
funny and affecting.
In "Pet," he explores young love like a
hard-rocking Daniel Johnston, delivering the
chorus: "Let's pet all night long / and into the
next day / they say it can't be done / but we
can find a way." With his jittery mix of humor
and emotion, it's hard to tell if he's being
sweet or sarcastic.
"I think when 1 originally came up with it,
it was sort of sarcastic," he says. "But some
how when 1 listen to it now, it seems more
naive and straightforward. It's one of those
things I'm not really sure of myself.
"The whole album can sort of be taken on
two levels, 1 guess. On one hand the whole
thing can he taken as sweet and touching and
that sort of thing, but on the other hand it can
also be sort of sarcastic and mean."
Alone in the oddball rock league
Sweet or sarcastic, "Let's Pet" appeals from
start to finish. From the charming, chugging
"Not You" to the kaleidoscopic keyboard-fest
"Star," McAulay and Kalvakota tear through
15 twisted pop gems reminiscent of early
They Might Be Giants or the Pixies.
"Bypass the Telephone" veers out of con
trol like a drunk accordionist trying to cover
Polvo, while "The New Policy" could be the
catchiest hit of xylophone rock since the Vio
lent Femmes' "Gone Daddy Gone."
"The New Policy" also features a special
spoken-word performance by McAulay's
mother. "We were recording the vocals on
that song, and my mom came down (to the

basement), because I had a phone call or
something," McAulay explains. "So I just
got her to say a few words into the mi
crophone." McAulay's mom recited an
eerie little poem which eventually
made it onto the album. "It just comes
out of nowhere, this weird, disembod
ied voice. It was just one of those weird
things that happened and worked out."
Throughout "Let's Pet," McAulay
and Kalvakota achieve a quirky but

full sound, with keyboards and drum
machines backing up their standard
bass-and-guitar set-up. With the
crispness or complexity of a song
like "Graves," it's easy to forget that
Vegetarian Meat are just two peo
ple having fun in a basement.
"There aren't all that many
bands that are just two guys and a
drum machine," he says. "There's
like Ween and They Might Be Giants,
and that's about it." But McAulay
and Kalvakota are happy this way.
"It sometimes seems like when
bands get too many people they
get unwieldy and stuff. We sort of
want to remain small."
And now that both Ween
and They Might Be Giants have
added new members and switched to
more conventional band rosters,
small oddball rock duos are a rare

breed. Vegetarian Meat appear left in a
strange league of their own, but then again,
that's really the only place they'd fit.

Nevertheless, by age 16, Vege
tarian Meat were playing 18-and-

over gigs in their hometown of Day- ™
ton, Ohio. And even when they
weren't well-received, they were having
fun.

"One time we played this club, and it was
totally deserted," McAulay recalls. "But in

back, Kim Deal (Breeders singer) and Jim
Greer (music critic and current Guided By
Voices bassist) were like the only two people
in there. And we started playing our songs,
and they got this look of horror on their faces
like it was the worst thing they'd ever heard,
and they ran out. We were pretty happy about
that. We'd scared them away."
It was probably their backwards pride that
kept them going so long, and over time they
refined their craft into the distinctive brand of
basement pop that eventually landed them a
record deal with the New York-based indie
label No. 6.
"It somehow evolved from a crazy joke

into a real band," McAula)
says. "Somehow

it just kept going and going and getting bigger
and bigger."
'Weird but nifty'
But at least until their anticipated summer
tour, the group has to plan their rock and roll
careers around their schoolwork. McAulay is a
junior at Brown studying English and creative
writing, and Kalvakota is a sophomore at
Boston University studying political science.
For his classes at Brown, McAulay writes
wild works of fiction which he considers the
literary equivalent of Veg. Meat songs —
"weird but nifty." Yet while his stories are fic
tion, he describes his music as "99 percent au-

tobiographical" — from details
of his two-dollar

sticker atlas to

a love
song

about his tenth grade trip to Germany.
"Well I actually didn't take a 10th grade
trip to Germany," he admits. "But some of my
friends did take a 1 Oth grade trip to Spain, and
1 knew someone else who had just been to
Germany." But even when he bends the truth,
McAulay offers honest insight into his
teenage years, with vivid details that are both
funny and affecting.
In "Pet," he explores young love like a
hard-rocking Daniel Johnston, delivering the
chorus: "Let's pet all night long / and into the
next day / they say it can't be done / but we
can find a way." With his jittery mix of humor
and emotion, it's hard to tell if he's being
sweet or sarcastic.
"I think when 1 originally came up with it,
it was sort of sarcastic," he says. "But some
how when 1 listen to it now, it seems more
naive and straightforward. It's one of those
things I'm not really sure of myself.
"The whole album can sort of be taken on
two levels, 1 guess. On one hand the whole
thing can he taken as sweet and touching and
that sort of thing, but on the other hand it can
also be sort of sarcastic and mean."
Alone in the oddball rock league
Sweet or sarcastic, "Let's Pet" appeals from
start to finish. From the charming, chugging
"Not You" to the kaleidoscopic keyboard-fest
"Star," McAulay and Kalvakota tear through
15 twisted pop gems reminiscent of early
They Might Be Giants or the Pixies.
"Bypass the Telephone" veers out of con
trol like a drunk accordionist trying to cover
Polvo, while "The New Policy" could be the
catchiest hit of xylophone rock since the Vio
lent Femmes' "Gone Daddy Gone."
"The New Policy" also features a special
spoken-word performance by McAulay's
mother. "We were recording the vocals on
that song, and my mom came down (to the

basement), because I had a phone call or
something," McAulay explains. "So I just
got her to say a few words into the mi
crophone." McAulay's mom recited an
eerie little poem which eventually
made it onto the album. "It just comes
out of nowhere, this weird, disembod
ied voice. It was just one of those weird
things that happened and worked out."
Throughout "Let's Pet," McAulay
and Kalvakota achieve a quirky but

full sound, with keyboards and drum
machines backing up their standard
bass-and-guitar set-up. With the
crispness or complexity of a song
like "Graves," it's easy to forget that
Vegetarian Meat are just two peo
ple having fun in a basement.
"There aren't all that many
bands that are just two guys and a
drum machine," he says. "There's
like Ween and They Might Be Giants,
and that's about it." But McAulay
and Kalvakota are happy this way.
"It sometimes seems like when
bands get too many people they
get unwieldy and stuff. We sort of
want to remain small."
And now that both Ween
and They Might Be Giants have
added new members and switched to
more conventional band rosters,
small oddball rock duos are a rare

breed. Vegetarian Meat appear left in a
strange league of their own, but then again,
that's really the only place they'd fit.
