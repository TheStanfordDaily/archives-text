# The 						San Francisco Film Festival offers filmgoers an embarrassment of riches

### Gabriela Teodorescu Julie Tsai 
The 38th San Francisco International
Film Festival, which starts today and
runs until May 4, will be serving up a
delectable array ot international film cuisine,
including 149 films from 41 countries rang
ing Irom Armenia to Burkina Faso to Taiwan.
I he festival will screen 23 North Ameri
can, eight world and seven international pre
mieres — a world premiere constitutes the
tirst showing of a film anywhere while an in
ternational premiere refers to the first show
ing outside the country of origin.
Tonight's opening gala features a group of
four films, diverse in both subject matter and
country of origin. Edward Burns' comedy
I he Brothers McMullen explores the navi
gation of sibling relationships and love be
tween three Irish-American brothers living
together in their family's Long Island home
after t heir father s death. (iregory Nava's "My
Family" — which chronicles three genera
tions of a Mexican-American family— has a
stellar cast including Fdward James Olmos,
Jimmy Smits and Ksai Morales. San Francis
co filmmaker Terry Zwigoff presents his
award-winning documentary "Crumb," a
portrait of legendary cartoonist Robert
Crumb ("Keep on Truckin', " Fritz the Cat).
And finally "Smoke,' co-written by Wayne
Wang ("The Jov Luck Club") and Paul Auster,
depicts a chain of random incidents which
connect a group of Brooklynites; it stars
William Hurt and Harvey Keitel.
A few of the festival's highlights:
"Amnesia" is a haunting Chilean film
about responsibility and complicity in the
military.
In the late '60s, Chilean private Ramirez
(Julio Jung) stumbles upon his former
sergeant Zuniga (Pedro Vicuna), who or
dered Ramirez to kill prisoners during his
tour of duty. Director Gonzalo Justiniano
expertly glides from the present story, in
which Ramirez plans revenge for the ma
nipulation he has not forgotten, into deso
late, desert flashbacks in which the soldiers
were imprisoned by their responsibility to
serve. The dark streets of Valparaiso match
the underlyingbanality of the evil which the
military perpetrated against innocent pris
oners and soldiers alike.
The stark scenes flow beautifully with a
score which darts between moving clarinet
solos and resonant opera. Zuniga says at
one point, "What you live is not important
W r hat you remember is important." The
beautiful cinematography and the intense
ending are truly memorable.
.
Kazirnierz Kutz's film "The Converted"
is a masterful political piece about the 1981
Solidarity movement in Poland.
Tomasz is a worker in an industrial town
who goes to a demonstration to spy for the
Communist party. When he gets carried

Wang and Auster make a return for the
closing night screenings as well with their se
quel "Blue in the Face." The movie boasts an
impressive ensemble cast which includes Kei
tel again, Roseanne, Lou Reed, Jim Jarmusch,
Michael J. Fox, Ciancarlo Fsposito, LilyTom
lin and Madonna. Also, British director Peter
Chelsom's "Funny Bones" will be screened;
it's a darkly humorous film about a failed
comic who returns to Blackpool, Fngland,
after bombing in Las Vegas.
The festival also will present achieve
ment awards to several directors. Stan
ley Donen, the director and musical
genius of such films as "Singin' in the Rain,"
"Funny lace," "Charade" and "Bedazzled,"
will be awarded theAkira Kurosawa I ifetime
Achievement Award on Saturday, April 22,
during a ceremony and special screening at
the (.'astro Theatre. Ritzy (black tie optional)
cocktail reception to follow at the Sir Francis
Drake Hotel. Tunisian director Moufida
I latli will receive the Satyajit Ray Award for
her film, "The Silences of the Palace," on
April 29, also during a ceremony and screen
ing of her film. The Satyajit Ray Award is
given annually to a filmmaker "of exception
al promise whose uncompromising aesthetic
vision gives us a new way of seeing ourselves
and the world."
In addition, film tributes will be made to
two legends. One will go to Les Blank, a well-

Though Tomasz escapes then, the next
day he is caught and ruthlesslybeaten up by
the police. Tomasz is thus "converted'' to
the other side. J he film, with appropriately
insistent background music, then carries
you through his dilemma in accepting his
reluctant conversion, with a balance be
tween his supporting wife and his betraying
mother and brother.
Tomasz is brilliantly played by Zbigniew
Zamachowski, one of Poland's best actors
(also seen in Krystof Kieslowski's "W&ite.*)

ing to a life that changes only slightly.

After viewing 'Sonatine," you will see
why this is one of Quentin Tarantino's fa
vorite movies.
The Japanese film, directed by Takeshi
Kitano (who expertly plays the lead* Mu
rak.nva), has all the necessary violence one
would expect from a favored Tarantino
film, but it is also a new and refreshing ren
diti< >n of the gangster genre.
HI he action takes place in Okinawa,
where a showdown is expected between two

known American documentarian of famous
musicians; the other will be given to Suso
Cecchi D'Amico, the Italian screenwriter of
such classics as Vittorio de Sica's "The Bicycle
Thief" and Franco Zeffireili's "The Taming of
the Shrew."
Two late additions were made to the Film
Festival's schedule. The first is "Little
Odessa," a film by James Cray about a family
of Russian immigrants; the cast includes Tim
Roth and Vanessa Redgrave. The second is
"Ludwig," added as part of the tribute to
screenwriter d'Amico, Luchino Visconti's
epic biography of the eccentric 19th Cen
tury Bavarian monarch.

factions of a criminal gang. As the leader of
one side, Murakawa takes his gang to a de
serted beach house to wait for the final
showdown. There they engage in such Zen
activities as Russian roulette, sumo
wrestling and origami making.
The cinematography, especially the blue
tinged dream sequences, is stunning and
the score is subtle yet thrilling. Kitano's un
usual rhythm, brilliantly balanced by the
use of slow and fast motion scenes, draws
one in and leaves an irrevocable impression.
"Viva Castro!" directed by Russian Boris
Frumin, simply fails as a film.
The story is engaging enough, however,
narrating events in the life of Koiva (Pavel
Zharkov), a young Russian man in a Siber
ian town who encounters many mishaps in
his life. His mother is jailed for his father's
crime of stealing coins, and his affair with
his high school music teacher is not going
well.
While the town is preparing for a visit by
Fidel Castro, Kolva has to deal with his can -
cer-stricken father (wonderfully pfaved by
Sergei Donuov, seen recently in "Window
to Paris").
Nevertheless, the cinematography is
nothing unique, the film cuts confusingly
between unrelated scenes, and the end
leaves little impression.

There is also a good collection of films from
women filmmakers from four continents and
a number of movies to interest younger
viewers, including Stanley Donen's

examination of patriarchy and homophobia
in the black church, nationalist and Acrocen

Audre Lorde, Afro-Cuban drum guru Fran
cisco Aguabella, and trumpet master Dizzy
Gillespie; and an examination of the "fringe
bank" evolved from the economic needs of
politically-disadvantaged African-American
businessmen in "No Loans Today."
Though Asia is well-represented by Tai
wan, Hong Kongand Japan, the varied evolu
tion of these films has created an interesting
body of work ranging from examinations on
urbanism to political oppression to a "yakuza
gore-fest" in "Sonatine" that counts no less
than director Quentin Tarantino as one of its

"In the

and "Postman" have

both generated good buzz

in their examinations of life
under the weight of the Chinese gov
ernment.
And the politics and culture of
Latino / Chicano films in the festival span a
wide breadth of topics as well. "Amnesia,"
from Chile, discusses the implications of
subjection to military rule, while "Reina and
Rey" deals with close-to-home issues of im
migration from Cuba to Miami. San Francis
co native Lourdes Portillo's "The Devil Never
Sleeps" and "My Family" explore domestic
dynamics.

A strong Asian film suite this year:
"Box office is democracy.... Buying a tick
et is like voting." So declares struggling
artist Bindy, one of many frazzled Tai
wanese yuppies connected through the
TV / film biz in "A Confucian Confusion."
Though friendsS, lovers and fiances flitter
in and out of the pair's lives, the film centers
around the friendship between Molly, the
executive of a TV production company, and
Qkji, her top aide. As Molly strategizes to
avert the company's impending financial
crisis, her piotosional and personal rela
tionships unravel and tangle into impossi
ble confusion.
While the film's fresh look at the deterio
ration of traditional Chinese values offers
no false consolation for the 112 uture of a
country undergoing whirlwind urban
transformation, there is much more to rec
ommend this movie. Th is includes an unre
lenting — and surprisingly sympathetic —
portrayal of westernized Taiwanese women,
an almost frenetic undercurrent much like
the pace of urban Taipei itself, characters
both torn and drawn to the allures of mod
ern living, and a nicely satiric edge.
Director Edward Yang has done a deftly
complex Asian turn on the theme of single
adults adrift.

Stanley Kwan's "Red Rose, White Rose"
creates an intoxicatingly lush picture of a
well-to-do Chinese man and his two very
different lovers in the 19305. While "Red
Rose, White Rose" is visually idyllic, it lulls
you into the deliberate pace and beautiful
images of vintage films only to startle you
with its insights into the uglier side of self
delusional cruelty in one man's romantic
character.
Those familiar with cross-cultural Asian
film productions will recognize the male
lead Chen-pao ( Winston Chao from"The
Wedding Banquet") and his friend's wife
Chiao-jiu (Joan Chen from Heaven and
Earth* and 'The Last F.mperor"). When
Chen pao and Chiao-jiu begin their affair,
Chen-pao idealizes her as a seductive and
volatile lover. Red Rose. He later marries a
woman who seems to be submissive and
"good," White Rose, but soon experiences
the irony of his assumption s
"Red Rose, White Rose' is a film that re
fuses to rush anywhere, but saves the final
twists of its premise for the end where it
echoes long after the viewing. If you have
the patience for an exquisitely slow movie,
this may well be the most satisfymgly sub
versive.

Barely 30 words were spoken in this en
tire film, and, appropriately enough, "Vive
L'Amour' is about missed connections.
While Tsai Ming-liang's Venice Grand
Prize-winner is set in urban Taipei like I< A
Confucian Confusion," there is no trace of
ambivalently bitter humor here, nor is there
any pretense of productivity. Instead Tsai
Surrounds the three protagonists with spare
interior spaces full of modern conve
niences, in which none of them accomplish
anything lasting in work or relationships.
But Tsai also i inbues ail the more sympa -
thy into their persons by displaying them in
all their pathetic glory, unable to communi
cate or satisfy their own needs, finally creat
ing a, yes, bizarre love triangle in an apart
ment that belongs to none of them.
Real estate agent May ("Eat Drink Man
Woman") uses an unsold apartment as a
place for random lovers, including hand
some Ahjung. When she accidentally
leaves the key in the door, an introverted
teenager uses the apartment for his own
personal space. How the three avoid colli
sion is negotiated in a tragically funny way.
But if anything, Tsai Ming-liang treats these
characters with sympathy and reserves her
critique for the isolation of urban life.
