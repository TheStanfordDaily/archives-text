Who: Da Lench Mob — a Street Politi- ground retrain: "One little two little three

Brought to us courtesy of Lenchmob lence and the constant linguistic assault of

production stamp all over it — not to men- mist" provide the catalysts for a song like

Funk and dub flavors fig

mix. And sample-happy to

sources as diverse as Public

Da Lench Mob

Enemy to Hollywood Squares.
Not unlike Public Enemy or Ice Cube
himself, white supremacy is Da Lench
Mob's primary lyrical target while aggres
sive black masculinity and fraternity
through hip-hop remain its favorite
weapons. Even though the rap trio aren't
doing anything that hasn't been done be
fore, good music abounds on this album.
Ice Cube kicks things off with "Scared
Little Nigga," a diatribe against the perenni
al "Uncle Tom." This brief insert is pure
Cube — inflammatory and uncompromis
ing. It's the perfect setup for "Chocolate
City," a track with a syrupy sweet back-

"Cut Throat." As one of
the best tracks on the
album, its bass line,
beats and synthesized
sounds are blended into
a compelling groove.
Confident lyrics and

perfectly timed rhymes distinguish this cut.
"If you snooze you loose / wouldn't
want to be in your shoes / lit 'em up cause
I'd rather stick 'em up than git 'em
up / stereotyped for life / that's how I'm
livin' / down with the gorillas in the mist
but fuck this!"
Pleasant surprises on the album come
from Lillian Young, an ONYX-inspired
youngster who pushes her way into the
party. Few tracks miss their goals. On the
political hip-hop continuum, "Planet of Da
Apes" proves that they are competent and
can more than hold their own amongst the
distinguished company they keep.
