# 'Tank Girl' offers tempered rawness

### 
1 decided to see "Tank Girl" the day I saw
Kennedy interview Lori Petty on MTV this
spring break. They sat on top of her tank, Petty
in jeans and a black tee-shirt, cowering from
the Arizona sun, Kennedy basking in it. Petty's
dark hair fell flatly and unattractively about
her face. Kennedy, hipped out in alterna
beach-wear, out-charisma-ed and out-talked
Petty by a long shot. Petty was awkward and
pale, kind of ugly, just uncool enough to be
completely endearing and to sell the movie.
In an appropriate move, the producers
managed to get Courtney Love-Cobain off the
Internet (her Trent Reznor-is-a-limp-dick
soapbox of choice) to be Executive Music Co
ordinator. Love-Cobain, with her near
fetishistic penchant for hysteria, is about as
wonderfully uncool as Petty.
Her soundtrack fails when it makes mea
sured, obvious steps towards the offbeat. No
one needs to hear Devo growl to bring their
terminally eighties "Girl U Want" up to date.
No one needs to hear Paul Westerberg and
Joan Jett ravage their way through Cole
Porters "Let's Do It."
Sublimated originality brings out the best
in Bjork's"ArmyofMe." No formula for insta
appeal could have predicted the thrilling dark
ness of Bjork's cyber-moodiness turned rock.
"Ripper Sole" by Stomp is likewise on target
— percussion edged with drama — the stuff
movies are made of.
Hole's "Drown Soda" hits as hard as any
thing on "Live Through This," and the quiet
contemplative prettiness of Veruca Salt's "Au
rora" rounds out the disc's best moments.

Portishead, overrated and undertalented,
turns out "Roads," a semi-cheap attempt at
disco erotica. "Mockingbird Girl," candy
coated alt-pop from the Magnificent Bastards,
is the type of mindless commercial schlock 1
expect Courtney Love-Cobain to kick the shit
out of.
But that's the thing about " lank Girl": It's
I lole tempered by major-label demographics;
it's Lori Petty pretending to like Kennedy.

There are
wonderful mo
ments when
everything fits,
when Tank Girl
doesn't want
anyone to like

her, and then there are moments when you
can't help but blush.
Listen to Ice-T, the consciousness-raising
geek of rap, rant on in "Big Gun" (without a
trace of embarrassment) about the girl that's
"the most venomous feminist" and maybe
you'll see what I mean.
