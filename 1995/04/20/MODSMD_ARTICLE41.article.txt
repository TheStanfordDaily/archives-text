# The 						Boss' 'Greatest Hits' still pays
## 
### 
For being one of the most significant
artists of the '70s and '80s, Bruce Springsteen
is surprisingly misunderstood by the public.
"Born in the USA" was a brutally raw
song, portraying the angst of Vietnam vets
without romanticism. Often, however, the
anthemic chorus was not read as ironic, but
as patriotic sloganeering. Unfortunately for
Springsteen, this brought him fans he didn't
want (such as Reagan), and kept away those
who assumed his music was pure populism.
For his long-time fans, however, Spring
steen's motives were never questionable. His
political views only became stronger with
time. In his own words, he valued the "every
day kind of heroism" which he saw in the
struggle "to lead decent, productive lives."
His lyrics spoke of the cruel realities of Amer
ican life, ranging from the pain of lost love to
the demoralization of unemployment to the
frustration of being trapped within disap
pointing lives.
A self-proclaimed "prisoner of rock 'n'
roll," Springsteen never abandoned his love
even when the world of popular music dele
gated rock 'n' roll to the "oldies" dustbin.
Possibly the last true believer in the music, he
is its final inheritor.
Thus, Springsteen's "Greatest Hits" is an
album his fans have been dreading for years
because its release clearly marks the end of his

mass popularity.
Containing most of the default choices, a
few surprises, and four unreleased tracks, the
album is obviously worth its price. The com
pilation, however, could have been much
more powerful.
While the absence of "Cover Me," "I'm on
Fire", and "I'm Coin' Down" seem a bit odd,
the exclusion of "Tunnel of Love" is inexcus
able.

"Gratest Hits"
Bruce Springsteen

The new tracks are mediocre and, if they
had been saved for a boxed set, room would
have been ample to create an unbelievable
collection of his work.
Essentially, if one is interested in trying
out Springsteen, this is not the album to buy.
Instead, "Born to Run," "Born in the USA,"
and "Tunnel of Love" would make better
purchases, each a breathtaking masterpiece.
Taken together, they are a testimony to the
eternal power of rock V roll. His "Greatest
Hits," however, trivializes that impact.
