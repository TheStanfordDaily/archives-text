# Pavement's 'Wowee Zowee' says it all
## 
### 
"There is no castration fear," sings Steve
Malkmus at the start of Pavement's "Wowee
Zowee." If we wanted to get all Freudian and
testicular about this album, we could see it as
the release of all the wacked-out experimen
tal urges that were repressed in the sweet pop
of last year's "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain."
"Wowee Zowee" eases its way through an
hour of wonderfully lazy and inventive rock
that's less catchy but more interesting than
"Crooked Rain." Pavement's most varied
project to date, their latest is a messy mix of
punk, folk, pop, country and spaced-out
noise bits. Vet in all the confusion, they still
deliver the essentials — engaging melody,
imagination and style from start to finish.
Songs like "Black Out," "Grounded" and
"Pueblo" are classic Pavement, but most of
this album stretches into new directions.
"Best Friend's Arm" alternates explosively
scrambled bursts with awkwardly sedate in
terludes, while "Grave Architecture" lays
down a cheesy groove and works wonders

with it. Even when Pavement edges towards
country and western on "Father to a Sister of
Thought," the results are steadily pleasing.
In addition, Malkmus' vocals are as enter-

"Wowee Zowee"
Pavement

taining as ever, from the repeated and stut
tered chorus of "AT & T" to the Adam San
dier-like falsetto that begins "Brinx Job." Two
years ago, Malkmus sang "I've got style /
miles and miles / so much style that it's wast
ed." This time around, he sings, "I've got all
the glory in the world /1 hope it doesn't floor
you before you go." But it still comes off as a
mix of real arrogance and intentional self
mockery that's puzzling, thoughtful and
funny.
"Wowee Zowee" isn't the breakthrough
everyone expected, nor is it a masterpiece like

Slanted & Enchanted." Its a
flawed treasure, an intention
ally unambitious album from
a naturally ambitious band.
So maybe "Rattled by the
Rush" drags on, and maybe I
can't take Malkmus seriously
when he sings "I don't need
this corporation attitude" in
his best Sex Pistols voice —
I 'm probably not supposed to.
Overall, this is a remarkable
album that leaves you trying to
sort out the sarcastic from the
sincere, the senseless from the
reflective, and the humorous
from the beautiful — only to
find out that Pavement makes
them all pretty much the same.
