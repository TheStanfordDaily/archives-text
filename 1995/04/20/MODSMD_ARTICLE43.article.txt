# Sleeper's too short wake
## 
### 
Sleeper is perfectly suited for modem
rock radio. They play simple, catchy tunes
with just enough energy and attitude to get
heavy airplay for about a month. Then
they're all but forgotten until their hit single
is included on some nostalgia-tinged com
pilation sold on TV: "Totally '905," Volumes
1 through 24, or something like that. It's not
an unpleasant fate, mind you, and Sleeper
seem to be aware that the shelf-life for their
music is very short, so they try their best to
get it right the first time, and the result is
their not-all-that-bad debut CD "Smart."
Slehe Smiths melds lyrics like "I want to
see you boxing naked to the death," with
bouncy, melodic pop structures. Of course,
vocalist/guitarist Louise Wener is no Mor
rissey in terms of emoting that peculiar
English blend of sarcasm, sincerity and self
pity, or even in terms of songwriting ability,
but Sleeper doesn't seem to suffer from a
lack of ideas. It's perfectly content with de
veloping on a small scale; the hooks and
chords are Pixies-like in their simplicity,
and Wener's lyrics paint pictures of cheer
fully dysfunctional relationships and ugly,
insignificant lives. Occasionally, like on
"Hunch," the music attempts a grandiose

sweep, which works as well as the small, sad
ballad "Amuse." The music, although for
mulaic and a bit sterile, still rings pure.
"Inbetweener" and "Swallow" are unde
niably the modern-rock radio "emphasis

tracks;" they are
upbeat, breezy, and
devastatingly sing
alongable. The
slower material on
"Smart" aches as
much as the

"Smart"
Sleeper

Smiths' "Asleep." If there is any weak point,
it is Wener's vocals. On "Delicious" and
"Lady Love Your Countryside," she is too
breathlessly coy for her own good.
After a few listens, "Smart" leaves me
with a modest buzz and a few stray lyrics
bouncing in my head. But whether or not
you want to spend sixteen dollars for a CD
you'll probably listen to for a maximum of
two weeks is your choice. If you're at all in
terested, you'd do yourself a favor by search
ing for "Smart" in you local used-music
store. (Or call me at 7-1766 and buy my
copy. By next week, I II have moved on to
the latest Guided By Voices 1 P.)
