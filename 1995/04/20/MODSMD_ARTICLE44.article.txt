# Failed ambient attempt
## Ska sampler's savory spice 
### 
Bill Laswell, who heads Axiom records, has
produced approximately thirty "cross-cultur
al synergistic" albums like "Be Bop or Be
Dead," "Hallucination Engine" and"The
Trance of Seven Colors.' While these projects
are a more or less noble effort to bridge east
ern and western musical styles, not all at
tempts succeed. "Blues in the East," featuring
(Chinese theatrical composer Liu Sola and Last
Poet Umar Bin Hassan, is a quintessential ex
ample of one such failed attempt. Labeled as
Chinese ambient music, "Blues in the East" is
based on two famous Chinese stories: "The

Broken Zither"
and "Married to
Exile." The for
mer an original
composition by
Sola, where she

"Blues in
the East'
Sola

sings Chinese literature directly, instead or
turning classical texts into lyrics. "The Broken
Zither" is based on a Sichuan lolk opera
melody from Southwest ('hina.
To these styles, Sola writes: "1 have added
the Blues, with its extreme emotional highs
and lows; la//, which frees music by providing
a space for improvisations; and Japanese Noh
Theater, which allows for singing in-between

notes.' 1 have also included
Cospel singing and speech
rhythms of African-American
story-telling."
What does this amount to?
What looks in print a confus
ing conglomeration of differ
ent musical genres sounds out
of-place to the ear. Umar Bin

1 lassan s tierv voice seems out ot place
when juxtaposed with Sola's dreamy Chi

nese lyrics. I he blues fusion with Chinese mu
sical styles comes off as two distinct voices that
should have remained in separate composi
tions.
Nothing really jives together on this album,
despite Sola's assertion that "Chinese music
and the Blues indeed have a lot in common."
While I admit to having very limited knowl
edge (okay ... absolutely none) of Chinese
musical traditions, I still feel that "Blues in the
Fast" sounds like a cross-cultural project, and
not like a synergy of eastern and western
music. Bill Laswell has achieved success in the
past with Mahmoud Maleem Chania and
Pharoah Sanders, but "Blues in the l ast' does
not make the mark.

For those who feel stifled by
the stagnant morass of
commercial music, Contin
uum Records offers an es-
I cape. Welcome to the sweet
shores of ska, a paradise get
away founded with a spirit
of high-powered groovin'
and a serious commitment
to get tin' down. Hut life on

this island hasn't always been so bliss
ful The older folks tell a story of struggle
and rejection, repeated failures and let-downs
that only subsided with a recent splash of ex
citement known as The Third Wave.
The intrepid inaugurators of this era of
post-bore prosperity, appropriately dubbed
The Toasters, rocked the groove establishment
way back in 1984 with their pep-laden blasts
of ska power and relentless dancefloor energy.
"Dub 56", remixed on "The Third Wave"
compilation, is a declaration of pure instru
mental spice and lyrical grace, a style that gave
birth to ska's next generation of rude boys.
Leading the priestly procession of modern
ska is Mephiskapheles, a group whose name is
almost as powerful as their musical entree.
Featured on "The Third Wave' not once but
twice, these wizards of the catchy groove hold

ly create murals of searing hornucopia with
tracks like "Doomsday" and "Saba." Display
ing an uncanny ability to pack a punch and
laugh the whole time, Mephiskapheles has
earned a position as ska's leading authority on
uplifting excitment and flashy zip.
Other tasty treats on "The Third Wave" in
clude the devilishly funny "Night Before", a
track whose chorus proclaims, "1 think I love

y o u
e v c 11
m ore
than I
did the
night
before

"The Third Wave"
Ska

we met." The pranksters of irony responsible
for tli is stab at cheesy love syrup are The
Pietasters, perhaps the funniest of jesters in
ska's royal court. Other choice selections in
clude Mustard Plug's "Too Stoopid", The
Scofflaws' "William Shatner", and "Othello", a
mellifluous vocal investigation by San Fran
cisco's own I )ance I lall Crashers.
Newcomers to the ska game will find Con
tinuum's "Ska: The Third Wave" a wonderful
introduction to a topic that is surprisingly
simple to learn. After that, the ska's the limit.
