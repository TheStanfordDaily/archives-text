# Wry tributes and saucy sounds fill Goo Goo Doll's fifth album
## 
### 
With their fifth album, "A Boy Named
(Joo," the (ion (ioo I)olls have achieved a cer
tain level of catchy, punk-edged pop. I he dri
ving guitar riffs and frenetic energy appeal to
the hedonistic quality lurking in all of us, while
the lyrics at times are surprisingly pensive.
At "A Hoy Named Goo's" best, you get "Flat
lop," a wry tribute to the power of the I \ set.
It's as ebullient a take on angst as you II ever
hear, with an infectious beat that varies be
tween verse and refrain to create a fascinating
rhythm. Strong, ringing chords serve as a
backdrop for caustic lyrics like A television
war between the cynics and the saints / Flip the

"A Boy Named Goo
Goo Goo Dolls

dial and that's whose side you're on." There are
also moments of near-poetic simplicity, such
as "there's knowledge wrapped in blankets on
the streets" that evoke a wistfulness at odds
with the upbeat music.
The only soft-edged song on the album,
"Name, gives you an idea of what the Cioos
would sound like unplugged. The prospect

isn t too repeuent; u notningcise, wun me sin
gle, pervasive guitar chord serves to mirror the
lyrics "a tired so ig keeps playing on a tired
radio." Sensibly relegated to the end of the
album, "Slave (iirl" is a downright annoying
foray into mindless guitar growls and raw vo
cals.
Lead vocalist John is at his best in songs like
"Naked" and "Flat Top." Direct, uncompro
mising, and mercifully clear, he sounds as
honest as you can get when singing lines like
"I'll turn my head off for awhile." In songs like
"Somethin Bad' and "So Long," though, his
voice takes on the self-indulgent whining

characteristic of a group like Cireen Day.
The Goo Goo Dolls are undoubtedly
emerging from the shadow of their greatest in
fluence, the Replacements, for whom they've
played as an opening act. They've got the ex
perience, the occasional radio-friendly gems,
and a polished sound any major record label
would be proud of. But the Goos have yet to
win back their youthful target group, which in
the meantime appears to have been brain
washed by pseudo-punk upstarts. But perhaps
it's for the best — the Goos deserve more than
listeners who look for quick hits and little else.
