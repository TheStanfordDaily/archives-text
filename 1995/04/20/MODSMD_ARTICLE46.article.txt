# Portrait paints itself bland
## 
### 
Watching old sitcom re-runs a few weeks
ago, a group of us cringed when we saw guest
star band Portrait playing at Laura and
Urkel's prom on "Family Matters."
With cheesy songs and choreography, we
laughed that even the deejays at our high
school proms had been better than these

Now, with their sec
ond album "All That
Matters" released, it is
clear that Portrait's
best achievement was
wooing Laura those

several years ago.
Portrait is obviously trying to share in the
success of such legendary R&B quartets as
Boyz II Men and All 4 One, but falls consid
erably short.
Kurt Jackson, brie Kirkland, Irving Wash
ington 111 and Michael Angelo Saulsberry
the guilty members of the group — chose
their album's name because "love is really All
That Matters."
But, if winning over women is their goal,
they should not have included "I Can Call
You" which is only a forum for spewing out
all of the names of girls they have been with:
"Lisa and Sharon, Vanessa or Karen...Ap
parently someone liked their rhythms. Mix
that with the whistles and hoots throughout
the song, and lines like "I want to freak you,"
the song shows the group's weak attempt at
impressing women.

"All That Matters"
Portrait

Ballads like the title track, "Much to
Much," and "Heartstrings" boast fairly
smooth beats. I'hey also include, however,
unimaginative lyrics like "Heartstrings' " "I
got such a good thing / I guess I'm going to
buy you a ring." Such atrocities continuously
repeat throughout the songs, as if they were

actually worth
hearing more than
once.
I lie album's
eighth track, "Lov
ing You is Ah-ight,
basically lets the

title speak for itself. Lhis song shows the
group s lack of range, as the lead singers
vary their voices by about half an octave at
best.
Concluding on a brighter note, Portrait
remakes the Bee Gees' hit from "Saturday
Night Fever," "How Deep is Your Love." This
is their most pleasing song of the album,
probably because it doesn't include any orig
inal lyrics. They slow the song down and add
snapping to the background, but basically
stay true to the Bee Gees' classic, making for
one of few highlights of "All That Matters."
With the abundance of popular R&B
artists, Portrait needed to stand out in some
way, but unfortunately, their only distin
guishing mark is their cheesy lyrics and weak
voices. Perhaps, next time, crafting decent
tunes should be "All That Matters."
