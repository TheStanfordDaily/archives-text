# ALL'S sound still the same
## 
### 
It has been eight years
since ALL sprang live from
the head of the demised
punk-pop legends the De
scendants. Since the begin
ning, AL.L has consistently

put out records and even more consistent
ly toured — and has developed a devout
following of its fiercely independent style
of making music.
While it is always interesting to see what
these guys will do next, it is both refreshing
and unsurprising that — with their recent
release — nothing much has changed. The
band's eighth album, "Pummel" on lnter
scope Records, is their first major-label re
lease. Up until now ALL has been on the
indie label, Cruz Records.
However, with the exception of the
parental advisory sticker, this develop
ment has had little if any effect on the con
tent, style, quality and production of their
music. The self-proclaimed punk-geeks
are still singing about love lost, lust, alien
ation and things that piss them off.
Taken as a whole, "Pummel" is a dis
jointed conglomerate of songs. On one
hand, the album displays a disciplined and
thorough musical maturity that could only
be obtained from a band that claims to

"All the Same"
ALL

tour 5,280 days a year.
Songs like
"Long Distance," "This
World," "Million
Bucks" and "Self Right
eous" exemplify both

the band's tightness and the power pop
recipe that has worked so well for theni.
In particular, "Long Distance" com
bines melodic and unusually solemn vo
cals — "Did you burn my pictures
yet?/ Anything to try and forget / It's all
over, all I can do is stay on the line" — over
roaring guitars and a solid rhythm section.
On the other hand, the album some
times regresses to knee-jerk, angry indeci
pherable noise. Songs like "Uncle Critic"
— "Critic, uncle motherfucking, chicken
shit, jealous, stupid idiot, bastard, wanna
be, fucking critic" — and "Hetero" —
"Straight, normal, hetero guy/ Normal,
hetero, straight guy" — serve as nothing
more than meaningless screaming
tantrums over a racket of spastic guitars
and drums.
All in all, this album is nothing more
and nothing less than was expected. If you
can make it through the muck, you can
find some decent rock V roll.
