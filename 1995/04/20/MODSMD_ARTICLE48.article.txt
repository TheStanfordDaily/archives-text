# Highwaymen should hit it
## 
### 
Prefabricated supergroups can be so dis
appointing. Why is it, one must wonder, that
when you get a bunch of great artists to play
together the result is so often mediocre.
Enter Highwaymen, country / western
music's foyer in the supergroup category. The
band unites four of the greats of outlaw coun
try — the legendary Willie Nelson, super-bad
Johnny Cash, gri/.zly Waylon Jennings and
Rhodes-Scholar-cum-redneck Kris Kristof
fcrson. Yet with all this talent. Highwaymen's
efforts are unfortunately blase.
"The Highwaymen," their debut 1985
album, featured only one truly memorable
sonc. Five years later came "Highwaymen 2,"

again, a disappointment. Now, keeping the five
year cycle, the quartet and producer Don Was
have rolled out "The Road does On Forever."
The good news is that this is the best album
so far. Indeed, the songwriting on " The
Road" is consistently strong, occassionally
brilliant. Robert Farl Keene, Jr.'s title track is a
hard-edged look at a loose waitress who
shoots a cop and her tough boyfriend who
goes to the chair for the crime. Johnny and his
son John contributed the other great song,
"Death and Hell." This track about a prosti
tute continues Cash's recent inclination to get
metaphysical on his listners: "Death and Hell
are never full / and neither are the eyes of

"The Road Goes
On Forever"
The Highwaymen

men." Other strong songs arc Steve Earle's
"The Devil's Right Hand" and the standards
" True Love Travels On A Gravel Road" and
"The End Of Understanding."
The performances of the back-up hand are
also quite good. Particularly noteworthy are
Mickey Raphael on harmonica and some
time-Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff.
But there is a big down side — the vocals.
It is strange that this should be the group's
downfall, since individually each artist (or at
least all but Kris) is so compelling vocally. Put

them together, however, and you realize
none of them can sing. Not a one.
The greater problem is that all four High
waymen can't sing in different styles. Willie's
hemming and hawing clashes with Johnny's
rambling rumbling, which clashes with
Waylon's deep, tuneless voice, which clashes
with Kris's monotony. What makes them
great country singers is a unique, earthy style,
but they don't blend well. Harmony is non
cxistant on the album, and when they sing in
tandem it too often sounds like a train wreck.
On "The Road," good songs and good mu
sicians have been hampered by poor harmo
ny, and it's a shame. The album truly would
have been better had only one, indeed any, of
the artists recorded it individually.
