what's new on video:
Curtis Hanson, the director of "Tht
I land that Rocks the (Cradle," lias created vel
another chilling action thriller — "The
River Wild." Set in treacherous white watei
rapids, "The River Wild" stars Meryl Streep
as Gail, who organizes a white water trip h
celebrate her son's birthday and to salvage
her shaky marriage to Tom (David
Strathairn). But (Jail's plans go awry when
Wade (the goateed villain played by Kevin
Bacon) and his buddies arrive on the scene.
Inevitably, Ciail is forced to wrestle with the
river and to battle with the bad gu\s, and,
well, I won't give away anymore, since the
movie relies on suspense... .While video
doesn't seem to do justice to I lanson s great
cinematography, the plot is intriguing
enough for a look see.
Another currently-released action-ad
venture is "The Specialist," starring
Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, James
Woods, and Fric Roberts. Predictably, "The
Specialist" is chock-full ol gratuitous vio
lence and sex, but few good scenes to hold
the plot together. To sum it up in one sen
tence, Stallone plays Ray, ex-CIA specialist
in explosives hired to help May (Stone) kill
off some Miami underworld thugs who
murdered her family. Frankly, the story-line
is convoluted and confusing, the acting
melodramatic and poor, and the special el
fects overdone.
Fine Line Film's "Naked in New York" is
a comedy, of sorts. F.ric Stolz and Mary-
Louise Parker are lake and Joanne, a couple
whose love life takes a beating when their
professional lives move in different direc
tions. The story line is quirky and oddball
ish, and the star-studded supporting cast,
which includes Ralph Macchio, Timoth\
Dalton, Tony Curtis, Kathleen Turner, and
Whoopi Goldberg, helps to liven up the
rather slow pace of the film.
If you like funny fairy-tale romances
"Princess C2araboo" is definitely worth rent
ing. It's about a young homeless woman
(Phoebe Cates), who is taken in by the
Woralls, a family belonging to the upper
crust of English society. I his mvsteriouj
woman speaks a foreign language, wears .1
turban, and has strange markings on her
buttocks — all of which convince the Wor
ralls and the rest of the Fnglish aristocracy
that she is an oriental princess. But is she? I'd
say anymore would give away the all the
good stuff.. . you'll have to see it for your
self".
