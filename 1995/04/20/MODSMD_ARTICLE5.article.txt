Today's welcome to the prospective class
of 1999 by Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions James Montoya and Nobel Laureate
Paul Berg, who teaches at the Medical
School, will kick off a three-day whirlwind of
events for Stanford's first-ever Admit Week
end.
In the past, this event has been a week
long extravaganza known as Pro Fro Week.
Now a plethora of informative sessions
meant to highlight academic resources and
showcase Stanford students will fill a week
end, according to Elise Maar, assistant direc

tor of admissions.
"We want to try to show off all the
strengths of Stanford and provide as much
information as possible so the students can
make an informed decision," Maar said.
"Hopefully coming here they will learn some
thing new that will persuade them.
"Last year there were two professors who
spoke at events. This year, there are 40 pro
fessors involved in the weekend's activities,"
Maar continued. "There is something to do at
all times."
Events range from campus and depart
ment tours to late-night basketball in Roble
