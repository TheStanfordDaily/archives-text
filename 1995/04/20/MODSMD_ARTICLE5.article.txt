sions James Montoya and Nobel Laureate
Paul Berg, who teaches at the Medical
School, will kick off a three-day whirlwind of
events for Stanford's first-ever Admit Week
end.
In the past, this event has been a week
long extravaganza known as Pro Fro Week.
Now a plethora of informative sessions
meant to highlight academic resources and
showcase Stanford students will fill a week
end, according to Elise Maar, assistant direc

tor of admissions.
"We want to try to show off all the
strengths of Stanford and provide as much
information as possible so the students can
make an informed decision," Maar said.
"Hopefully coming here they will learn some
thing new that will persuade them.
"Last year there were two professors who
spoke at events. This year, there are 40 pro
fessors involved in the weekend's activities,"
Maar continued. "There is something to do at
all times."
Events range from campus and depart
ment tours to late-night basketball in Roble
Gyro to seminars on rehgiocs Life
at Stanford. Students are encour
aged to frequent campus perfor
mances. check out the Coffee
House and attend daises. A higft-
Light is the "Academic Expo.'
which mctudes special Lectures by
professors on a range of topics.
.Admits wii! also get a feei for
the campus through such presen
tations as "The Stanford Lega
cj r " in which professors who
were once Stanford undergradu
ates will relate their experiences
and expiain why they chose to
make Stanford their home.
The majority cf cot Leges com
peting with Stanford for stu
dents are also running their
recruiting programs this week

Of the 2.900 students admit
