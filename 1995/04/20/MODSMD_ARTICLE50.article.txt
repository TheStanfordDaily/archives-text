## 'Red Firecracker' exhausts a culture's exoticization 
### 
Anyone whose exposure to films from
the People's Republic is confined to the
likes of Huang Jianxin's "The Wooden
Man's Bride' and the first three /hang
Yimou films, might be forgiven tor assum
ing that the sole interest of Chinese film
makers lay 111 the oppressed condition of
women in feudal, pre-revolution China.

Red Firecracker,
Green Firecracker

In fact, there have been numerous fine
examples of sue ia! realism that deal with di
verse issues of contemporary PR( for some
time now, often sans bureaucratic ap
proval, e.g. Van Xueshu's "Wild Mountain,'
\ie l ei's "Black Snow," Zhou Xiaowen's re
tent "F rmo and the fledgling Sixth (iener
at ion renegade movement. What is curious
is that no matter how many such films pop
up 011 the festival circuit, the ones that get
picked lip by American distributors invari
ably boast of a long suffering, but beautiful
heroine 011 their publicity posters.
It Cong I is statuesque elegance epito
mizes the Orientalist's ultimate wet dream,
then newcomer Ning ling may well pose a
serious challenge to her pedestal. Ravishing
as the protagonist Chun/hi in "Red Fire
cracker, Green Firecracker," Ning radiates
an ultra-feminine China-doll aura even
when cross-dressing in male attire for most
of the film.
One has to concede that relative to her
long lineage of tormented heroine figures
in PRC cinema, Chunz.hi's predicament
does present itself with an interesting twist.
As the sole surviving progeny of the illustri
ous Cai family, ( hunzhi takes on the tradi
tionally male responsibility of overseeing
its explosives-making empire.
Chunzhi's dilemma arises when a
ruggedly handsome painter arrives to work
in the (!ai manor. Not only does feisty Ni

übao (Wu (iang) challenge the sadistic
command of supervisor Mann (Zhao Xi
aorui), but his unfettered advances toward
his employer prompts (ihunzhi to rethink
her acquiescence to her father's will — she
has been bound to a life of spinsterhood, so
that the Cai fortune will not tail into the
hands ol an "outsider."
Director He Ping does justice to the
source novel by Feng Jicai artfully in the
film's opening stages, thanks in part to
strength of all three lead actors, bravura art
direction, crisp editing, and the unprece
dented use — for the typically static PRC!
film aesthetic — of a hand-held Steadicam
in some exuberant chase sequences.
As the film enters its second half though,

economy of style soon j
gives way to the tire- 112
some circularity of a I
narrative that makes its

point early on, hut by the end, shows dis
turbing signs ot a nervous retreat. Cine
matic energy dissipates as dialogue he
comes so literal that at one point, it teeters
close to embarrassment: "KChunzhi) don't
want to he your master; 1 just want to he a
woman!"
Whether in the guise of master or ser
vant, the heroine-victim composite figure
fetishi/ing the strong yet serene Chinese fe
male ideal appears to have exhausted all
artistic possibility. The fascination of PRC
filmmakers, their overseas sales agents, and
the western audience with such subject
matter ought to be read for what it really is:
the economically-driven tool for the femi
nization and exoticization of culture.
