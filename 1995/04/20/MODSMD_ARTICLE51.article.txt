# Johnny Depp makes perfect fantastical 'Don Juan de Marco'
## 
### 
"I am not Casanova, I am Don Juan,"
Johnny Depp insists in his new film "Don
Juan DeMarco." No doubt about it. Clad in
tight black breeches, sword at his side, and
mask on his face, Depp is indisputably the fa
mous Latin lover. Unfortunately, his shrink
doesn't believe him.
Marlon Brando is Jack, Don Juan's psychi
atrist. Middle-aged and angling towards early
retirement, Jack's life is comfortable. .. and
boring. Knter 1 >on Juan. Jack finds that he has
much to learn about life and love from his
supposedly schizophrenic patient.
"Don Juan DeMarco" is an utterly charm
ing fantasy about the kind of man every
woman dreams of and every man wishes he
could be. This is not your run-of-the-mill ro
mance — rather, the storyline is original and
keeps you guessing. One moment in Queens
and the next on a deserted island or in a sul

tan's harem, the film engages us in tlights of
fancy, teasing the imagination with amorous
possibilities. A genuinely feel-good film,
"Don Juan DcMarco" combines just the right
amount of mushy romance and quirky
humor.
Johnny 1 )epp steals the show, hands down.
Not only does he look like the legendary
amorist with his long hair and earring, but he
sword fights and seduces with the best of
them. His Castilian accent, while fake and
greatly exaggerated, adds to his charm and fits
the slightly off-center mood of the film. It's
rumored that Depp picked up his accent by
watching re-runs of "fantasy Island." Depp's
acting creates a character both honest and in
nocent, suave and debonair.
While Don Juan exists in a world of fantas
tical true love, real life is rarely that perfect.
The parallel story of lack and his wife (played

by Have Dunaway) adds a kernel of realism to
the film. Jack is past the age of sowing the

proverbial wild
oats, and his wife
is content with
placid domestici
ty. Theirs is a
Hawed yet human
love, and their re
discovery of one
another makes

for a sweet and funny tale.
"Don Juan DeMarco" could come across
as an exaggerated, nonsensical, piece-of-fluff
movie. But if you leave your disbelief and
skepticism at home and arrive at the theater
with your imagination (and preferably, a
date), you'll probably get a kick out of this
flick.
