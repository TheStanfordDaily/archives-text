# Love triangle most terrible
## 
### 
When watching "Bar Girls," 1 kept asking
myself the same simple question, over and
over and over again: Do I want to be watch
ing a movie about normal people? What is so
interesting about people who have jobs, fall
in love, have stupid affairs, reconcile with
their loved ones, hug, kiss, drink coffee, and
talk about sex all the fucking time?
Nothing. Nada. Niente. I like movies
which are about people who have experi
ences 1 couldn't possibly have, who have
emotions which are at least somewhat alien
to me, who live through traumas and joys 1
couldn't even imagine happening in my
own life. I am willing to pay to understand

what it might be
like to be chased
by a dinosaur in
the rain, to dis
cover the un
pleasant ries of a
husband who

Bar Girls

stuns your lover with his own books, to leel
the pain of an unsuccessful male gigolo and
his short side-kick in New York in the late
1 %()s.
I do not like movies which tritely show me
the 90210 side ot life. II I wanted to know
about the eating habits of vapid privileged
young cute people, I would hang out with

more frasority members.
Entirely irrelevant is the
sexual orientation of the char
acters of "Bar Girls;" they are
all lesbians. But so what? Do
they do anything particularly
interesting as lesbians? Am I
supposed to be shocked, sur
prised, and then delighted that
lesbians are people just like
you and me? Unlike certain
other Daily contributors, I
learned that lesson long, long
ago.
So the main characters of
"Bar (lirls" are all women, and
women who like other women.
But they are shallow, aimless,
obnoxious women who I cer
tainlv wouldn't want to be at
quainted with, no matter what

my sexual orientation.
I.oretta (Nancy Allison
Wolfe) is the main character. She sleeps with
almost everyone in the movie, and seems to
fall in love at two week intervals. The sex
scenes are at least honest, but gratuitous in a
wavone usuallv finds in the worst I lollvwood
drek.
Rachel (I i/.i 1 VAgostino) is I.oretta's main

lover. She is pretty and ambitious, but also
spews such cliches as "The moment you are
unfaithful to me, even just a little bit, I'm
outta here. Yeah, well, go ahead, make my
day."
"Bar (litis,' is not worth your time. II you
want to see real filmed emotion between

characters who are not strictly heterosexual,
go see "The ( Tying (iame," or "Farewell My
Concubine." If you want to laugh at bad ac
tors portraying self-centered characters in
volved in love triangles we've all seen before,
you couldn't do any worse than "Bar Girls."
