# Trite trilogy 'Erotique' is merely 'Exotica' in wolf's clothing
## 
### 
Not too long ago, Atom Egoyan's multi
sexual intrigue "Exotica," whetted our libidi
nous appetites by exploring themes of fanta
sy, desire and eroticism. Now close at its heel;
comes "Erotique," an international antholo
gy of erotic stories from US director l.izii
Borden, Germany's Monika Trout and Hong
Kong filmmaker Clara Law.
But if the well-done "Exotica" actually sat
isfied your palate, don't bother seeing "Ero
tique," because this entree is raw.
1. "Let's Talk About Sex."
Co-written by sex commentator Susit
Bright, Lizzie Borden's adventure center:
about a struggling Latina actress (Kamali
Lopez-Dawson) who works as a phone-so
operator. But whether she happens to be au

ditioningfora part or working on the phone,
Dawson finds herself at the mercy of the hi
ased tastes held by middle-aged white men.
When she auditions for lead roles, direc
tors try to typecast her in non-speaking

parts, as a prosti
tute, a barmaid,
or other forms of
hired help. At
work, she is di
rected quite dif
ferently. In the

Erotique

anonymous world of phone sex, she must
transform herself into the most requested
male fantasy — a blonde woman with mea
surements of 44-24-36. Va va voom!
This critique and Borden's approach —

both original and exciting — arc betrayed in
the end by the films rather trite resolution.
2. "Taboo Parlor."
Two lesbians, one straight man, exhibi
tionist sex, the man ends up dead....
Moving right along.
3. "Wanton Soup."
Placing this film at the end is certainly a
case of saving the best for last. Clara Law
combines stunning cinematography with a
simple but compelling story. Adrian (Tim
Lounibos) and Ann (Hayley Man) are an ex
uberant couple, reunited after six months of
separation. But while sex is at the forefront of
their minds, and current itinerary, it is not
enough to obscure the problems that they
face.

Ann, born and raised in Hong Kong, is
fiercely proud of her Chinese heritage. Adri
an, is Chinese but has been raised in Aus
tralia. He knows little of Chinese culture, his
favorite foods are burgers at McDonalds and
he dates Chinese women because Aussie
blondes won't look at him. Nobody is right or
wrong here, but by the end — after raucous
Chinese-erotic manual-induced sex — Ann
sees that the two are clearly wrong for one an
other.
Films one and three are certainly worth
seeing. But besides the fact that women have
sex and direct movies too, it's hard to find any
justification for why we should be watching
these films back to back.
