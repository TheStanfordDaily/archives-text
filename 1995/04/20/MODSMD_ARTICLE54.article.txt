Circle of Friends
Focusing on the intertwining
lives of three Irish women attending
college in Dublin, "Circle of Friends"
offers an intriguing look at late
1950s Ireland and the strong influ
ence the Catholic Church had over
daily life.
After spending their child
hood years in a boring small town.
Benny (Minnie Driver) and her friend
Eve (Geraldine O'Rawe) are eager
to experience the grown-up plea
sures of university and city life. On
their first day of school, the pair
bumps into childhood friend Nan
(Saffron Burrows), who has become
quite the socialite. The trio stays
close throughout the film as they
search for true love
While the movie is excellent,
it is not perfect By avoiding Nan's
predicament, "Circle" is able to end
on a high note with its positive
theme intact: True love will outlast
any obstacle even the stringent
Catholic Church.
Priest
Hell hath no fury like a reli
gion scorned. In the same vein,

Priest" traces the brutal path of ac
tion taken by the Church against the
protagonist Father Greg (Linus
Roache) who finds himself outed by
the tabloid press as a gay man.
It takes a tragic revelation
from Lisa (Christine Tremarco), a
14-year-old victim of sexual abuse
by her father, for Father Greg to
begin questioning the inadequacy
of clerical doctrines which have out
lived their historical legitimacy. Un
able to inform the proper authorities
of Lisa's suffering due to the sacred
nature of the confession, Father
Greg resorts to the power'' of faith
to do the right thing
The convenience of such
melodramatic devices - used
again in the too-neat finale have
somewhat undermined the other
wise raw realism of a drab and des
olate English urban landscape Nev
ertheless, McGovern's virtuoso writ
ing manages to convey an acutely
observed sense of blue-collar
humor amid the most poignant of
human confrontations not just be
tween one another, but also against
towering institutions of dogmatic
Catholicism and a legal system

Rob Roy
If you are seduced by the
backdrop of rolling Scottish hills,
the plight of honor and the charm
of broadsword battle, you will be in
cinematic heaven watching "Rob
Roy." This tale of a Highlander's
war against the stifling arm of aris
tocratic oppression is not to be
missed.
All three leads seem perfect
ly cast, Liam Neeson ("Schindler's
List") as the honorable clansman
who places character and loyalty
above all else, Oscar-winner Jessi
ca Lange as his strong but not bit
ter or brash wife Mary, and Tim
Roth ( "Pulp Fiction") as the deli
cious dandy Cunningham, who
wields his sword with a callous
might foreign to his foppish ap
pearance.
In a great battle between the
have and have-nots, complicated by
political intrigue and the conspira
tor's mind-set, the question of honor
and morals are examined not only
from the point of means but also of
ends. Rob Roy" is a tale of an epic
hero, but not one we would care to
trade places with.

Tank Girl
The entire cast of characters
in "Tank Girl" is appropriated from
other movies. Rebecca the tank girl
(Lori Petty) is reminiscent style-wise
of Madonna in her "Borderline"
days and, acting-wise, of her
"Who's That Girl" period. Petty's he
lium-influenced voice and laugh are
extremely grating. The villain,
Keslee (Malcolm McDowell), quotes
poetry, hordes water, and finally
turns into something resembling
Claw of Inspector Gadget. This
transformation is done by the re
constructive surgeon we are well
acquainted with as the eye-guy
from "Blade Runner."
The movie is full of loop
holes. Though the first shot of the
movie is of the Golden Gate Bridge,
everyone has an Australian accents
And, while the earth is suffering an
enormous water shortage (due to a
collision with a comet), beer is in
stunningly high supply.
If you want your brain to be
come mush (or it feels like that al
ready), don t hesitate to see "Tank
Girl But make sure you do some
cool mind-altering substances first.
