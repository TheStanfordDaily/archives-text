Chapter 15 ot rock critic Ciina Arnolds
punk narrative "Route (>(>6: (>ll the Road to
Nirvana is devoted to the International
Pop Underground Convention, the now
legendary indie Bacchanalia that brought
punk-pop separatists worldwide to
Olympia, Washington in the summer ol
1991. in her painstaking description ol the
I PI 1 (for short), Arnold conjures np images
ot a rock is-rule ( amelot, where everv night
is an all-ages show, every day is a Sub Pop
catered barbecue and everybody is a winner.
With such visions of a place and time
where music was more than just music, I
wanted a chapter in my own narrative and
figured that Northampton, Mass. was the
place, spring break was the time and the
1 oud Music Festival was the scene, boasting
a lineup of indie-pop's finest like Helium,
Versus, Small Factory and about 90 other
wonders, three nights and one day ofquali
ty music were a given. And seeing that the
lineup had been e-mailed worldwide via

numerous alt.music newsgroups, the op
portunity for a hipster communion seemed
ripe as well.
A lot has happened in the four years be
tween Arnold s real-life fain tale and what
turned out to be my non event, lor starters,
Nirvana happened and everything is differ
ent. (Except maybe Olympia, which was
home to the Yo yo-a-(io-go, last summer s
sequel to the I IT. Pearl Jam happened and,
after selling a billion albums, IPl'-goer
Fddie Yedder hasn't c| nnt his band to start
his own label, as he had an inkling to do
when he saw the I uga/i way back when. Sub
Pop happened and the label that was on the
verge ol bankruptcy B.N. (Before "Never
mind") is now the world's wealthiest
"indie" imprint A.N. ( \ ft e r Nirvana oris
that Alternative Nation?).
l our years later and all I got from the
I oud Music Festival were a handful ot un
developed photos, a ( D from a niltv new
band, some ticket stubs and a detailed

knowledge ol downtown Northampton.
Didn't get a good journal entry out of it, but
rather this filler column. Maybe it just
wasn't meant to be any more — after all,
how could am tiling sponsored bv Finlandia
Yodka?
Not that the musk wasn't superb, even
memorable. I he main attractions delivered
in a wav vou knew they would. Dynamo
rockets ( ome played ferociously to cap oft
the festival; Yersus broke things up, literally
guitarist Richard Baluyut kept snapping
strings during songs. I ongtime undie ( un
derground / indie heroes Scrawl and Fdsel
bristled and bounced with more energy
than am of the upstarts. More valuable was
the opportunitv to check out the endless list
ot nameless bands. Ibkyo's Sugar Plant
came the furthest and put on the most en
trancing show of the bunch, weav ing their
intricate drowse-pop. Jovsey's bright hopes
Spent did sorta the same thing, only more
catchv and less dense.

Hut in spirit, the i oud Music Festival fell
somewhere between the Olympia love-fests
and 1 ollapaloo/a. And that's nowhere at all.
I acking both the fervent elitism of the for
mer and the lunkhead enthusiasm ofthe lat
ter, the savvy music lovers gathered at the
festival were merely the parts ot the sum and
nothing more. It was neither a til-death-of
corporate-ro<.k- do-we -part community
nor a throbbing, all-for-one mass of hu
manity. I .ise in point: The seated bunch at
the front for the Versus show had to be
roused to its feet by the band and prodded

themselves down at the back of a cavernous
hall. 1 veil a bomb threat at the largest
venues failed to generate any excitement.

maybe hearing something new is good
enough.
Good enough, just not better.
