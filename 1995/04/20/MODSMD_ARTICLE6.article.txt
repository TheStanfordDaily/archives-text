## Caller says three bombs located in house on south end of Mayfield 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
A bomb threat yesterday morn
ing forced students from all houses
on the south end of Mayfield Av
enue to evacuate their residences
— and raised concern over the lack
of a University bomb threat proto
col.
The threat at Stanford was one
of many made across the nation,
which some speculate were copycat
crimes of yesterday's disastrous
Oklahoma City bombing.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, an un
known male called police at about
10:15 a.m. and told the receptionist
he put three bombs set to explode at
noon in a brown house on the south
end of Mayfield. When the recep
tionist asked him why he had set
the bombs, he replied, "Because of
my girlfriend," and then hung up
the phone. Since the call came in
from an outside source, Niemeyer
said it could not be traced.
The police then called Acting Di
rector of Residential Education
Ann Porteus and notified her about

the threat. Based on what the po
lice told her, she made the decision
in conjunction with Acting Dean of
Students Jim Larimore to evacuate
all south-side Mayfield houses
from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., Por

facilities administrators — in addi

Most Row house residents lining
Mayfield Avenue had an attitude of
disbelief or nonchalance about the
bomb threat. Despite the threat,
residents of La Maison Frangaise
were having a barbecue in their
backyard until they were told to
move just minutes before noon.
"I don't believe it — I think it's
all a hoax," said junior Jacob
Solotaroff, a Delta Kappa Epsilon
house resident. "I want my lunch."
Because the houses were evacu
ated during the lunch hour, some of
the houses found ways to get food
and drinks and then lunched on the
grass. "We've got the keg, so every
thing is OK," said sophomore
Roger Arnemann, also a Deke resi
dent.

Some people took the threat
more seriously. "It's an inconve
nience, but considering the poten
tial risk, it's a worthwhile inconve
nience," said junior Eleanor Lewis,
a resident of La Maison Frangaise.
Nevertheless, many of the resi
dents played a few games of volley
ball just in front of the house.
At 1:00 p.m., after Roth, Xanadu
and La Maison Frangaise had been
searched, residents were allowed to
return to their houses. Those hous
