# Students, professors protest comparative studies program
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
For the first time since the University proposed a
Comparative Race and Ethnicity interdisciplinary
program two months ago, students from different
ethnic groups, faculty members and deans gathered
last night to discuss the merits and flaws of the pro
posal.
In the open forum that followed a series of speech
es at Cubberley Auditorium, however, both students
and faculty raised objections to elements of the pro
posed ethnic studies program.
The program first came under fire from members
of the Black Student Union and professors and stu
dents in the African and Afro-American Studies pro
gram, who argued that marginalized faculty and a
disintegration of that program would hurt the Uni
versity.
The proposed interdisciplinary program also drew
criticism from other ethnic communities. Angela
Parker, a member of the Stanford American Indian
Organization, said the ethnic studies program had
the potential "to severely split the ethnic communi

ties from each other."
Other students cited problems with the working
details of the proposed ethnic studies program. In
order for the program to depart from traditional aca
demic assumptions, steps will have to be taken to en
sure the program remains independent, said Kris
Hayashi, a member of Concerned Students for Asian
American Studies.
Hayashi added that Stanford is a "rich, white,
straight, male institution" that funds new sports
centers but cuts ethnic programs and builds a new
science and engineering quad but blames ethnic
studies for draining money.
Despite the criticisms, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven said he only anticipated a
small delay in the establishment of the program.
"Worrying about important details, various interests
... I never thought that would be easy," he said.
Students and professors, however, did seem to
worry about the details — largely over the status of
tenured professors.

She added that unftkr the other
ethnic studaes programs, the Afro-
American Studies program has
been around for approximately 30
years.
