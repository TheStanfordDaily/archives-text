# Taking back the night...
## 
### Samuel Park Staff writer 
Both women and men confronted the
issue of sexual assault and abuse last
night during "Take Back the Night," an
annual march that gathered over 80 stu
dents and sympathizers in White Plaza.
"It's a chance for people to speak out
against rape and sexual assault, and it's
empowering to walk out at night around
campus," said Mary Kussmaul, who orga

nized this year's event. She declared it an
"open megaphone" night and welcomed
people to speak out about their experi
ences.
Led by members of the Women's De
fending Ourselves Collective, the group
marched to the Main Quad holding can
dles and chanting "Women unite! Take
back the night!" and "What do we want?
Safe streets! Safe homes! Safe beds!"
