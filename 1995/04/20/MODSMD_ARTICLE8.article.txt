# Taking back the night...
## 
### Samuel Park Staff writer 
Both women and men confronted the
issue of sexual assault and abuse last
night during "Take Back the Night," an
annual march that gathered over 80 stu
dents and sympathizers in White Plaza.
"It's a chance for people to speak out
against rape and sexual assault, and it's
empowering to walk out at night around
campus," said Mary Kussmaul, who orga

nized this year's event. She declared it an
"open megaphone" night and welcomed
people to speak out about their experi
ences.
Led by members of the Women's De
fending Ourselves Collective, the group
marched to the Main Quad holding can
dles and chanting "Women unite! Take
back the night!" and "What do we want?
Safe streets! Safe homes! Safe beds!"

"For a lot of people the night
symbolizes fear and we feel
empowered by going out into
that fear, standing together
with other people or speaking
out against it," said junior
Rachel Katz.
Once in the Main Quad, sur
vivors rose from the crowd one
after another to share their
experiences through song or
speech. Victims recounted their
personal experiences with sexu
al abuse, date rape and molesta
tion. The crowd expressed soli
darity through clapping and
cheers.
"So much of issues of vio
lence against women is sur
rounded by silence. People don't
talk about it," said senior Jessi
ca Cornette before the rally
began. "I'm not saying that
Stanford isn't safe, but there's
this huge perception that Stan

ford is a country club where
everyone is happy — but things
do happen here."
One alleged rape victim, who
did not disclose her full name,
reminded the crowd that rape
can happen even in a dorm
where "everyone thinks of each
other as brothers and sisters."
She told the crowd about the
empowerment she felt in con
fronting her rapist.
Other victims recounted
experiences that happened
when they were in high school
or as early as middle school, as
one woman spoke angrily
against the man who she says
took advantage of her when she
was 12 and was later acquitted
at the trial.
Most of the stories were told
by female victims, but one man
rose to speak of how rape and
sexual violence affects the vic
tim's loved ones. He exhorted
the crowd to "raise our children
to love and respect women, for
men who love and respect
women."

Although most of the people
in the crowd were female, there
were many men present as well.
"I came to show my support
for what the rally stands for,"
said graduate student Stuart
Finkel. "It's important for this
to happen now and all the time
to give people a sense of commu
nity and keep people's aware
ness high."
The march was originally
supposed to continue to Lake
Lagunita and then back to
White Plaza, but due to a light
rain that began unexpectedly,
the march was redirected to the
Physics Tank.
"Things aren't being done
here at Stanford. Many
resources have lost money.
These things (violence against
women) are considered a non
issue and not given vocal sup
port," Katz said. "Things are
happening behind closed doors,
and people don't talk about it."
"Take Back the Night" is
part of Women's Herstory
Month.
