# Rice offers preliminary budget plan

Provost Condoleezza Rice outlined the Univer
sity's 1995-96 budgeting process before the Facul
ty Senate yesterday, announcing that the Univer
sity will again meet its goal of cutting $6 million
from the budget.
The University is currently in the second year of
a three-year initiative to cut $18 million from its
annual budget.
Rice also announced that the University will ef-

feet substantial cuts — including
personnel cuts — in Central
Stores, the University's mecha
nism for departmental purchases
of laboratory equipment and of
fice supplies.
"We have informed the staff of
Stores that it will be downsized
significantly in the coming
months," Rice said.
"We have been forced to lay off

significant numbers of employees in order to
lower our costs," she said. "However even with
those layoffs we cannot both cover our costs and
maintain competitive prices on many kinds of
products."
Rice said the University is developing a new pro
curement system whereby departments and ad
ministrative units can procure goods through on
line systems rather than through paper ordering
processes.
Rice presented a preliminary budget report to
the senate, promising to give a more detailed pre
sentation with exact numbers in June.
The cuts are key to the University's shift toward
"revenue-constrained" budgeting, meaning the
University plans to spend no more than it collects
in revenue.
Rice said the cuts will come largely from various
administrative units and savings achieved by keep
ing the budgets of certain departments and admin
istrative units constant and not increasing them to
account for inflation.
The budgets of the individual schools are all
being held constant in nominal dollars, Rice said.
In effect, this amounts to about a 3 percent cut in
each schools' budget, because their allocations will
not be increased by the rate of inflation, which this
year was 3.5 percent.
Library services, the Department of Health and
Safety and Student Affairs units will have their
budgets increased to account for inflation, Rice
said.
Other administrative units will not have their
budgets increased for inflation and will face reduc
tions of about 2 to 3 percent.
One factor in the University's budgeting
process that seems to be a particular worry for the
