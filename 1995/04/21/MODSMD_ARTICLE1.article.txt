# Rice offers preliminary budget plan
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice outlined the Univer
sity's 1995-96 budgeting process before the Facul
ty Senate yesterday, announcing that the Univer
sity will again meet its goal of cutting $6 million
from the budget.
The University is currently in the second year of
a three-year initiative to cut $18 million from its
annual budget.
Rice also announced that the University will ef-

feet substantial cuts — including
personnel cuts — in Central
Stores, the University's mecha
nism for departmental purchases
of laboratory equipment and of
fice supplies.
"We have informed the staff of
Stores that it will be downsized
significantly in the coming
months," Rice said.
"We have been forced to lay off

significant numbers of employees in order to
lower our costs," she said. "However even with
those layoffs we cannot both cover our costs and
maintain competitive prices on many kinds of
products."
Rice said the University is developing a new pro
curement system whereby departments and ad
ministrative units can procure goods through on
line systems rather than through paper ordering
processes.
Rice presented a preliminary budget report to
the senate, promising to give a more detailed pre
sentation with exact numbers in June.
The cuts are key to the University's shift toward
"revenue-constrained" budgeting, meaning the
University plans to spend no more than it collects
in revenue.
Rice said the cuts will come largely from various
administrative units and savings achieved by keep
ing the budgets of certain departments and admin
istrative units constant and not increasing them to
account for inflation.
The budgets of the individual schools are all
being held constant in nominal dollars, Rice said.
In effect, this amounts to about a 3 percent cut in
each schools' budget, because their allocations will
not be increased by the rate of inflation, which this
year was 3.5 percent.
Library services, the Department of Health and
Safety and Student Affairs units will have their
budgets increased to account for inflation, Rice
said.
Other administrative units will not have their
budgets increased for inflation and will face reduc
tions of about 2 to 3 percent.
One factor in the University's budgeting
process that seems to be a particular worry for the


Rice
administration is the threat of
cuts in federal funding for
research that may come about as
part of initiatives in Washington
D.C. to reduce government spend
ing.
"Our dependence on the feder
al government is substantial at
this point," said Vice Provost and
Dean of Graduate Research
Charles Kruger. "Something like
$471 million out of our $1.2 bil
lion consolidated budget is spon
sored projects and 87 percent of
that is from the federal govern
ment."

Casper said that though cuts in
federal research support are immi
nent, the nature and extent of the
reductions is uncertain.
"We are working in utter
darkness," Casper said. "Mem
bers of the major committees (in
Congress) have really no clue
how these things will come out.
And since they have no clue, we,
of course, are even more clue
less."
The possibility of decreased
federal funding was one motiva
tion behind the administration's
decision to allocate part of the
University budget to a contingen
cy fund aimed at covering unantic
ipated shortfalls in revenue.
"It is only prudent that we be
able to cover .. . some of the short

fall in revenue that we could expe
rience if things were to go bad in
Washington (later this year),"
Rice said.
Rice said another purpose of
the contingency fund was to ease
the last-minute difficulties that
can arise from uncertainties in the
University's costs and revenues.
"Last year ... at year-end ...
we scrambled around to close the
bottom line in any way we possibly
can, because there's actually an
18-month lag between the esti
mate of revenues and the closing
of the books," Rice said. "I just
don't think we can continue to do
that."
The contingency reserve will
amount to about 2 percent of gen
eral funds, Rice said.
