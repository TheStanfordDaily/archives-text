## FBI issues warrants as Oklahoma search continues 
### 
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - As the rub
ble slowly yielded more dead, the FBI
struck back swiftly yesterday and issued
arrest warrants for two men suspected of
renting the truck that blew apart a federal
building with a half-ton of home-brewed
explosives.
Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 52,
making Wednesday's attack the deadliest
bombing in U.S. history. About 150 people
remained unaccounted for.
Less than a day and a half after the
bombing at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building, FBI Agent Weldon Kennedy said
law enforcement agents are seeking two
white men suspected of using aliases to
rent the truck. The men's identities are
unknown, he said.
Weldon offered no motive for the attack
and no details about the suspects other
than a physical description.
In London, a third man, a Jordanian-

American described by U.S. officials as a
possible witness in the attack, was flown
back to the United States for questioning
yesterday. Italian officials said his bags,
seized in Rome, contained possible bomb
making tools.
But law enforcement sources in Wash
ington, speaking on condition of anonymi
ty, said they did not think he had signifi
cant knowledge of the bombing.
For most of the day, rescue teams using
dogs, fiber-optic cameras and listening
devices crawled through the nine-story
hulk, looking for signs of life.
Gov. Frank Keating reported a firefight
er told him: "You find out whoever did this.
All I've found in here are a baby's finger
and an American flag."
In Washington, Attorney General Janet
Reno announced a $2 million reward for
information leading to arrests in the case.
Investigators said the truck was rented

April 17, packed with fuel-and-fertilizer
explosives and parked outside the office
building, where the blast tore away half
the structure Wednesday morning and
blew a crater eight feet deep and 30 feet
across.
An axle thought to have come from the
vehicle was found about two blocks away,
said a police source who spoke on condition
of anonymity. Major auto parts are marked
with an ID number to thwart thieves. Two
years ago, the vehicle ID number on a piece
of axle enabled investigators to break the
World Trade Center bombing case.
A federal law enforcement official, also
demanding anonymity, said investigators
believe the truck was rented in Kansas.
Dave Russell, a Ryder Truck Rental offi
cial, said the FBI contacted his company
about a truck rented from Elliott's Body
Shop in Junction City, Kan., about 270
miles from Oklahoma City.

CNN reported that three men of Middle
Eastern background were arrested — two
in Dallas, one in Oklahoma City — on
immigration charges and were being ques
tioned in the bombing. However, an official
at the Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice in Washington denied INS had anyone
in custody in Dallas or Oklahoma City.
Some Arab-American organizations
expressed fear of a backlash and said it was
unfair to implicate Muslims.
"Whoever did this, regardless of their
religion or ethnic background, is no more
than an animal," said Nihad Awad, presi
dent of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations in Washington.
In Washington, President Clinton called
on Americans not to "jump to any conclu
sions" about the culprits. Clinton also
announced he has ordered new steps to
protect thousands of federal buildings
nationwide.

More than 400 people were injured in
the blast, which was so powerful that fly
ing glass pierced lungs, slashed one man's
throat and cut another 100 times. Many
were buried helplessly under doors, walls
and concrete beams. One woman had her
leg amputated so she could be freed. The
dead included at least 12 children.
Worried friends and relatives of the
missing gathered at St. Luke United
Methodist Church, where the Red Cross
posted a victims list. Clutching pho
tographs of the missing, some stayed to
eat, talk to counselors or sleep.
Volunteers told of hearing little children
screaming, and seeing tiny faces covered
with blood and plaster.
"I'm 33 years old and I have lived my
life.... They haven't even started theirs,"
Robert Buckner said. "I would have gladly
given my life for one of those lives ... just
one child."
