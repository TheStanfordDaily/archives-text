Here's why you should
decide to join Stanford's
Class of 1999 next year

FIRST OF ALL, congratula
tions. Only 18.8 percent of
applicants to Stanford were
mailed that magic package earli
er this month — and those 2,900
prospective freshmen from all
over the country and the world
have a wonderful opportunity in
front of them.
Of course, you have to make
the big decision first. That's why,
we assume, many of you came to
visit the Farm this weekend. We
know you're going to have a
great time as pro fros (please do
not use the title "Stanford Admit
Weekender") but we also know
that some of you are still weigh
ing your options.
Here's why you should go to
Stanford.
• The weather: Don't say you
haven't noticed, It's beautiful
here. Sure, there's always the
possibility of some rain and the
temperature sometimes falls into
the 50s — but at least we can
guarantee that you will never
have to trudge to class in snow.
(Try get that kind of promise
from the Yale Daily News.)
And for those of you who
appreciate the occasional snow
flake, no worries — Tahoe and all
the snow you could want is just a
few hours away. And the beach is
just a short trip in the other
direction. Start thinking about
those dorm trips next year.
• The people: They're nice.
Stanford students are all
extremely intelligent, but most
of us are also down-to-earth and
relaxed. We like to work, but we
like to have fun, too. It's all part
of the Stanford experience. And
although we all study hard, Stan
ford doesn't suffer from the cut
throat competitive environment
that you find at some other
schools.

• The location: We're in Cali
fornia, for pete's sake. OK, some
of you East Coasters might be a
bit skittish about things like
earthquakes, floods and fires,
but you can't argue with the
statement that it's most exciting
state in the Union.
Stanford is less than an hour
away from San Francisco, a city
that everyone should at least
agree is . . . interesting. Don't for
get you can catch a train up to the
City at a station right near cam
pus. Plus, we're far enough away
from Berkeley to be safe from
catching that weenie disease.
More generally, Stanford's
California location places it on
the edge of the most dynamic
area in the world — the Pacific
Rim. Believe us, the world is
changing fast, and Stanford is
poised to move right along with
it. Don't even try to argue that
New Jersey is where the action is
nowadays.
• Campus life: To provide a
common freshman experience
you'll spend your first year in a
dorm, but after that you'll have
myriad options: the Greek sys
tem, small houses and co-ops,
suites and, of course, more
dorms. There's always some
thing to do on the Farm, ranging
from sporting events to all-cam
pus parties to hanging out at the
Co Ho (ask a student about what
that means). Plus, Stanford's
campus is very safe — at what
other school is bicycle theft the
most common crime?
The only thing East Coast
schools have on us age and tradi
tion. If you want to live in dilapi
dated dorms at a school that
brags about the fact that it pro
duced 10 presidents, go for it.
But if you want to be part of a
tradition of great academics com
bined with stellar athletic and
extra-curricular activities, check
yes and mail in that letter to
Dean Montoya today. Better yet,
go to Old Union and deliver it in
person.
You won't regret it.
