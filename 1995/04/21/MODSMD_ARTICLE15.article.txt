## Learning to pay to learn 
### 
EVERYBODY AGREES: Higher edu
cation needs reform. An issue more
important than affirmative action
and curriculum changes is the affordability
of a college degree. Nothing else matters if
students and their parents — and society
— cannot pay for the privileges of the uni
versity.
One of the latest studies shows that in
the 1980s median family income rose by 15
percent but public university education
costs rose by 27 percent and private univer
sity education by twice that. Stanford stu
dents are hardly exaggerating when they
claim to graduate owing as much as
$100,000.
This debt impacts not only on access to
an elite education but also career choices of
graduating seniors. However much a gov
ernment or public interest or other less
lucrative job might benefit society in intan
gible terms and reward the individual in
quality of life, student loans frequently
shape the decisions.
While Stanford has taken the lead in
suggesting an accelerated track of three
years for undergraduate education, the
issue is not the length of college but its
expense. Students who are serious should
be allowed to spend more time on campus
by spending less money on tuition. Indeed,
if quality of education is considered, the
weakness of public school preparatory
coursework should suggest an extended
stay of five years for a baccalaureate
degree. Students in the slacker generation

are in no hurry to enter the workplace any
way.
The cost-benefit analysis becomes
worse with graduate education. It is diffi
cult to understand why anyone without
independent means would pursue a grad
uate degree in any humanities or social
science field The most prestigious schol
arships permit a student to live at roughly
the poverty level — provided that loans
taken out earlier are deferred — and the
student foregoes any personal life or the
possibility of having a family. Altogether,
the seven years of work, loneliness, haz
ing, uncertainty about even receiving the
degree and the lack of societal and profes
sional support, especially for women and
minorities, make the prospect of a doctor
ate even less appealing. After receiving the
degree, job openings are scarce and
salaries are laughably low. Despite the
talk of an impending boom in retirements
among geriatric faculty, short-term con
tract positions are becoming the norm and
tenure is unobtainable except by super
stars.
Similarly, some professional fields, such
as architecture, have educational, training
and licensing requirements that function
to exclude competition rather than ensure
competence.
Academics themselves may be partly to
blame for the impression that teaching is
easy and research is esoteric. They are an
easy target, however.
At bottom, there is a more pervasive

problem — a lack of respect for learning.
Education is opportunity, but it is not a
commodity. We must support liberal arts
education, along with technological train
ing, for its own sake and not merely as the
pursuit of credentials. We should encour
age curiosity and study, foster creativity
and diligence, reward study and teaching
— for everyone — in many disciplines and
as lifelong pursuits.
In an economy that requires ever more
highly-skilled workers with increasing
international competition, the country
must rethink the structure of higher edu
cation and its support for students. The
educated class and the entrepreneurial
class can be compatible.
The educational experiment is a chal
lenge, regardless of ideologies. Even as tra
ditional students are declining in number,
non-traditional students ranging from the
first in a family to finish high school to the
continuing education devotee to the
returning older student are increasing in
number. The university is one of the few
institutions that has become open: by race,
gender, sexual orientation, disability, age,
marital status. The university must adapt
before the rest of society to these changing
demographics.

Frank urges readers to support tax breaks
for college tuition.
