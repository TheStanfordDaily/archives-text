Law School's defense of preferential treatment is illogical

WE ARE WRITING in response to
the Stanford Law School press
conference announcing opposi
tion to the California Civil Rights Initia
tive (CCRI). The defense of preferential
hiring and admissions rests on precari
ous logic.
First, aggregate numbers do not
explain why certain groups do better or
worse than their counterparts. At the
program, student leaders bemoaned the
fact that women on average earn 60 to 70
percent less than men and that minori
ties on average earn $10,000 less annual
ly than do whites with comparable educa
tional backgrounds. Are these numbers
correct? Yes. Are they helpful to the pref
erential hiring discussion? No.
Any student who has taken introduc
tory statistics understands that using
average figures belies true differences
between groups. In other words, we are
comparing apples to oranges and con
cluding the obvious: Differences exist
between the two. What must be done is
to compare the wages of women to those
of men with comparable education, jobs,
training, et cetera. Some empirical
research has revealed that, when con
founding variables are controlled for,
much of the wage differentials by sex and
ethnic classification disappear.
Second, even assuming that wage dif
ferentials exist, class- and gender-based
discrimination may not be the reason.
For example, women who remain single
earn roughly 91 percent of the salaries of
men in comparable jobs. Black West Indi
ans, who are physically indistinguishable
from African-Americans and who as a
group have much lower salaries, earn
approximately 98 percent of the salaries
of whites. What explains the 9 percent
differential in the case of women and the
2 percent differential for Black West

Indians? The simple answer is that we
cannot know for sure. Statisticians call
such percentages unexplained variation;
irresponsible liberals call them discrimi
nation. It is simply incorrect as a matter
of statistical practice to assume that any
unexplained variation is attributable to
discrimination.
Third, even assuming both that wage
differentials persist and that we may
ascribe their cause to discrimination,
preferential policies may not be the solu
tion. Preferential policy gains among the
better educated and more financially suc
cessful members of minority groups have
often come at the expense of the less edu
cated and less well-off members of the
same groups.
Employers have also suggested anoth
er explanation for the lower success rates
of less-educated minorities: Such individ
uals are too expensive to employ because
employers fear that they will be accused
of discrimination if and when they decide
to terminate employment. Given this dis
parity in successes within "protected"
minority classes, it is no surprise that we
find the elite members of minority
groups rallying in support of preferential
policies while the members of these
groups with lower socio-economic status
es are less convinced of the success and
propriety of such programs.
Fourth, these data notwithstanding,
the purported wisdom of preferential
policies raises the more basic issue of
whether the government should be in the
business of discriminating between per
sons on the basis of group affiliation.
While everyone would cry discrimination
if the government instructed police offi
cers to arrest individuals who belong to
ethnic groups with higher average crime
rates, few seem to raise as much of an
eyebrow when the government employs

group discriminatory practices in its hir
ing decisions. Proponents of preferential
policies have coined the phrase "benign
discrimination" to euphemistically justify
their support, but is there such a thing?
When we throw individual characteristics
to the wind in favor of group statistics, is
this form of discrimination any less
invidious?
Left out of this entire discussion is the
message that proponents of affirmative
action convey to members of protected
groups. Proponents justify their support
on either of two rationale â€” minorities
are physically and/or mentally incapable
of competing with whites or society is so
stacked against historically discriminat
ed-against minorities that they do not
have a fair opportunity to compete.
Believing that the first rationale is with
out merit, we turn to the latter. Cross
cultural studies of ethnic and religious
groups which have been historically dis
criminated against reveal that there is
little correlation between the degree of
discrimination faced and economic
results. Jews and Japanese have been
discriminated against in every country in
which they have settled, yet they never
failed to remain among the most econom
ically successful groups in each of these
countries. In the U.S., overt discrimina
tion against African-Americans has
dwarfed that against Puerto Ricans; yet
African-Americans enjoy a higher overall
occupational status and 20 percent high
er incomes.
Again, even if we were to assume that
discrimination correlates with economic
success, the solution to this problem
should be to eradicate discrimination, not
to further its pernicious effects through
government-sponsored discrimination in
favor of and against certain groups.
The CCRI builds on the provisions of

the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the
14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitu
tion by reinforcing the illegality of
group-based discrimination. Yet the
CCRI will not erect barriers against the
fight to destroy inveterate individual dis
crimination. The same legal avenues
that currently exist for persons suspect
ed of having been victims of discrimina
tion remain; Title VII, Title IX, Section
1983, and the Equal Protection Clause
of the 14th Amendment all continue to
be available to plaintiffs in cases of bona
fide discrimination. Hence, the CCRI
will not disenfranchise any groups, nor
will it restrict the ability of plaintiffs to
challenge discrimination in schools or in
the workplace.
Preferential policies are a complicated
lot; undoubtedly emotions and personal
anecdotes make a dispassionate discus
sion of the issue difficult. Yet the impor
tance of the preferential policies and the
fundamental issues they raise regarding
the proper role of the government in
eradicating discrimination cannot be dis
missed casually. Stanford students owe it
to themselves to become informed voters
in perhaps the most ground-breaking ini
tiative in the history of California and
perhaps the U.S. The Law School's press
conference should serve as the opening
bell, not the closing hymn, for an
informed and open discussion of the
issues.
