Beta fraternity didn't
organize the break-in
I would like to submit this letter for
clarification of a few gross misunderstand
ings regarding the recent events concern
ing the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. The
onslaught of The Daily and its greed for a
sensationalistic story greatly exaggerated
the circumstances surrounding the alleged
museum break-in incident which occurred
over spring break.
First, I would like to clarify the fact that
the Building 10 break-in was an entirely
unrelated event that involved two students
living in Columbae. On the same note, the
alleged museum incident involved one
senior, one junior and two sophomores who
reside in the Beta house. The brothers of
Beta Theta Pi understand that our mem
bers were involved; at the same time, these
students were not acting as representatives
of our fraternity, but independently as indi
viduals who seem to have made a bad deci
sion.
We resent the fact that Stanford police
captain Raoul Niemeyer had passed judg
ment on our organization as a whole before
any investigation began, stating, "I don't

know if the fraternity had anything to do
with the burglary itself, but it's a good pos
sibility." Not only did he implicate our
organization, but he also implied that there
was an actual burglary involved. This sup
position is not only preposterous, but
demeaning and slanderous as well.
The Columbae students have already
been released on misdemeanor charges for
trespassing wliile the Beta residents still
face charges. When asked what they were
doing in Casper's office, the two residents
of Columbae replied, "Just exploring," and,
"We heard that if you go up there, there
are neat things to see." How are these rea
sons different from those given by the
Beta residents? I suppose that matter is for
the judge to decide, but isn't it odd that the
non-fraternity related students got away
with a mere slap on the hand for practically
the same offense? Isn't it also odd that the
potential threat to the president's life is
downplayed by the threat to a few pieces of
artwork that the Beta residents never
knew existed in the first place?
As stated in The Daily, Niemeyer had
told them that "several bombings of the
president's office in the late 1960s makes
breaking into Casper's office a more sensi
tive situation than other forced entries." I
suppose that now that we are in the 19905,

breaking into supposedly empty buildings
that are under reconstruction is more sen
sitive than the president's well-being.
Once again, I would like to emphasize
the fact that this incident was not a frater
nity-sponsored event. The alleged break-in
occurred over spring recess, when school
was out of session. We did not condone this
activity nor did we place long distance calls
from our vacations in Mexico in order to
tell these four guys to go loot the old Stan
ford art museum for some extra beer
money. However, since these individuals
are indeed members of our esteemed orga
nization, we are cooperating fully with the
University, with regards to the concept of
collective responsibility as well as by con
ducting our own internal investigation so
that this matter can be settled as quickly
and cleanly as possible.
The fraternity of Beta Theta Pi regrets
that this incident ever occurred and would
like to apologize to the museum director
for all the stress that we're sure this situa
tion has caused him. The happenings on
the night of March 25 were in no way con
doned or allowed by the values and tenets
of our organization.
Beta Theta Pi is the oldest fraternity
west of the Allegheny Mountains. Alumni
membership is more than 100,000 men.

There are 136 chapters and 10 colonies
located in the U.S. and Canada We here at
Beta Theta Pi are confident that a fair con
clusion will be reached and that our future
is bright. We are a young fraternity at
Stanford and look forward to many years
of brotherhood. This alleged museum inci
dent will in no way jeopardize our housing
status. At this point in time, we are looking
for strong-willed, intelligent young men
who are bound to be leaders. With a suc
cessful rush, Beta Theta Pi will continue to
strive for excellence in mind and spirit

Directory didn't try to
avoid paying its taxes
In the recent Daily article about the
Stanford Directory's existing tax status,
the variety of opinions presented on this
issue were not adequately represented,
even though they were shared with The
Daily. We are writing to provide the com
munity with additional information which
will be helpful in understanding this mat
ter.

The Directory began as a small student
publication that has grown into the prime
directory for the campus. Initially it did not
fall under unrelated business income regu
lations. When questions were first raised
about its tax status, campus and off-cam
pus advisors provided a variety of opinions
on this matter. It was clear to us that the
issue would require further study and con
sideration. Therefore, as The Daily correct
ly reported, we took the responsible action
of ensuring that sufficient funds would be
available to pay all applicable taxes should
it be determined that taxes were owed.
Eventually, despite differing opinions, we
decided that the prudent course would be
to pay all potential tax liabilities for the
Directory. Analysis of past years has been
forwarded for review by accountants.
In closing, we want to assure the Stan
ford community that there has never been
any intention to avoid legitimate tax liabili
ties. That is why we have been diligent in
holding funds in reserve for any potential
tax liability. There was never any intent to
avoid tax liabilities; the intent was simply
to ensure that, in fact, they were owed.
