# Cowell nutritionist leaves Stanford
## 
### Joanna Dickler 
Though body image and health are some of
the most important issues confronting stu
dents, Stanford is temporarily without a nutri
tionist to address these particular needs and
concerns.
Laura Brainin-Rodriguez, the campus
nutritionist, left Stanford Wednesday after
nine years of service at Cowell Student Health
Center in the Health Promotion Program.
Brainin-Rodriguez, who said she will carry
with her from Stanford many "memories and
close friendships," will assume a position as
the Child Health Disability Prevention Pro
gram nutritionist at the San Francisco Depart
ment of Public Health.
During her time at the University, Brainin-
Rodriguez exhibited strong support for
women's health and body-image issues. In
addition to counseling students privately, she
contributed ideas for last year's Body Image
Awareness Week and has been a resource for
the Body Image, Food and Self-Esteem Sup
port Group.
"She was a vital link in Stanford's support
network, especially for women and athletes,"

said John Hall, a live-in counselor at the
Bridge. "In the last two quarters, our number
one issue has been eating disorders and body
image and self-esteem problems.
"One of our main and most successful"
resources has been Brainin-Rodriguez, he
added.
Brainin-Rodriguez bestowed her services on
students and faculty alike. Using what Carole
Pertofsky, director of Cowell's Health Promo
tion Program, termed a "holistic perspective,"
Brainin-Rodriguez worked frequently with
athletes, coaches and trainers and offered
classes to the faculty on such topics as breast
cancer prevention, being "heart-smart" and
using vitamin supplements.
She also gave many presentations to stu
dents around campus to address such concerns
as vegetarianism and eating healthfully with
University Dining Services.
Hall said he is concerned that Brainin-
Rodriguez's position be filled quickly in order
to keep up with student needs.
Though Brainin-Rodriguez worked part
time, Cowell is looking for someone to be a full
time nutritionist, a process that "will take us
through most of this quarter," Pertofsky said.

"Laura is going to be very difficult to replace
because she's extremely talented," Pertofsky
added.
Brainin-Rodriguez cited her reasons for
leaving as both personal — since she lives in
San Francisco, she'll have a shorter commute,
for example — and professional, saying the job
in San Francisco presents an "opportunity for
professional development."
At the San Francisco Department of Public
Health, Brainin-Rodriguez will be working
with both the child health program and
Women, Infants and Children, two federally
funded programs that strive to head off pre
ventable disease and disability.
Brainin-Rodriguez will be shifting her focus
from young adults to children under the age of
18. It is "an opportunity to serve a group of
people" she feels can truly benefit from her
efforts, Brainin-Rodriguez said.
In addition, Brainin-Rodriguez will train
health professionals and oversee the develop
ment of educational programs, duties she did
not have at Stanford.
"It was the recognition that I needed to
evolve into something different," Brainin-
Rodriguez said of her decision to change jobs.
