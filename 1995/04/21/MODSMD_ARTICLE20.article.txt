## The 						two that got away Homeruns and Keith Evans push Bears over the Cardinal

The rich Cardinal red of the Stanford base
ball squad was diluted to a medium shade of
pink yesterday at Sunken Diamond as Cal
mixed stellar pitching with a ninth inning
three-run dinger to whitewash the Cardinal
4-0.
Stanford (22-18 overall, 12-9 in the Pacific
10 Southern Division) never picked up offen
sive momentum in the brisk afternoon wind
as Bears pitcher Keith Evans pitched a four
hit shutout to lead Cal to a victory in the first
of a four-game series against the Cardinal,
who have now dropped four contests in a row.
"Just as quickly as we've gone cold we can
go hot again," said Stanford southpaw Mike
Robbins (3-1), who picked up the loss and
gave up 12 hits in nine innings. "There is no
question in my mind that we are the best
team in the conference."
But that question is soon to be answered,
as the Cardinal play only two more Six-Pac
series before the end of the regular season.
Stanford is trying to avert a slide into home —
the homestretch, that is — having dropped
the last four conference games and slipped
two games behind the first place Bears and

one game back of USC.
This game turned into a pitching war, with
both Evans and Robbins looking good in the
early going. Cal center fielder Ricky Spears
broke a tie ball game with a solo homer in the
fifth inning, taking a Robbins 0-2 pitch that
caught too much of the plate over the fence.
"It got up in the wind and there it went,"
Robbins said. "You can't do that. I knew bet
ter than that."
Robbins nabbed seven of his eight strike
outs in the first six innings and handled Bear
baserunners well, but Stanford's offense sat
idle. Of the Cardinal's four hits in the game,
two came off the bat of third baseman Steve
Carver and the remaining two were con
tributed by Stanford's second and third bat
ters. The second half of the lineup went hit
less.
The contest was still close at 1-0 in the
sixth inning, when Stanford catcher A.J.
Hinch's line drive to center with a runner on
second set up a Cal relay that caught left
fielder Cale Carter at the plate. Two innings
later, with two outs in the eighth, Hinch flew
out to right field with men on first and second,
ending the last of the Cardinal scoring threat.
Looking for insurance runs going into the
top of the ninth, Cal right fielder Gavin
Brown delivered in the form of a three-run
home run that called it a game. Brown bit on
a low Robbins fastball that didn't get away in
time, putting the Bears up by the final mar
gin.
A lead-off single in the ninth by Carver
gave the Cardinal a twinge of hope, but right

fielder Dusty Allen's line-drive to first base
was caught and the Bears flattened Stan
ford's hopes for a final comeback by tagging
first base and turning the double play.
Robbins' full game saw him toss 142 pitch
es compared with Evans' 118 throws in his
first career complete game shutout. Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess kept Robbins in
the game, and fatigue did not appear to be a

problem.
"I felt fine," Robbins said. "To be honest, I
felt better as the game went along. I didn't feel
that good at the start."
Cal's hits were spread evenly through
out the lineup, and designated hitter Mike
Wolger went 3-for-4 with one run on the

Junior Mike Robbins tossed a great game yesterday with the exception of two pitches
that he probably wishes he had back.
day. All but one Bear in the
starting lineup had at least one
hit. Nevertheless, even Cal skip
per Bob Milano doesn't point the
finger at Robbins and fatigue.
"[Stanford] knows him better
than [I do]," Milano said of Mar
quess' decision to keep Robbins
in the ball game for the interim.
"I do know [Robbins], and I
think he's a helluva player. He's
a tough nut to crack on the
mound."
The Cardinal woes at home
continue this season. Stanford is
only 10-12 in Sunken Diamond
but has an impressive 12-6
record on the road. The squad is

7-9 versus ranked opponents,
and four of those nine losses
have come in the last four
games.
Thursday's loss hurts Stan
ford's hopes to win the Six-Pac
this season. While USC controls
its own fate, Stanford can move
past Cal in the rankings if the
Cardinal wins the last three
games of this series.
Today's game, along with
Sunday's contest, will be played
