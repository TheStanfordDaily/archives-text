# Both pitchers shine in duel
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
For those who love tradition
al baseball, a close, low-scoring
pitching duel, Sunken Diamond
was the perfect place to be yes
terday afternoon.
Junior left-hander Mike
Robbins and sophomore right
hander Keith Evans engaged in
a duel that left arms sore in the
stands just from watching.
Both pitchers tossed complete
games and although Robbins
gave up four runs in his nine
innings of work, the pair were
impressive overall, especially in
their ability to make pitches
when they counted.
Judging by the way Evans
looked on the mound, it was dif
ficult to believe that he entered
the game with a three-game los
ing streak. One of three Califor
nia starting pitchers with near
ly identical statistics, Evans
upped his record to 6-5 by giving up
only four hits and striking out
seven in his first career shutout.
"I was pitching well and I got the
breaks," Evans said. "I got pumped
up because I was facing Stanford. I
knew I needed to turn it up a
notch."
Evans, who features good con
trol, faced a tense situation only
once. In the bottom of the sixth
inning, after striking out freshman
center fielder Joe Kilburg to start
the inning, Evans allowed a double
off the right field wall to junior Cale
Carter. Junior catcher A.J. Hinch
lined a single to center and Carter,
after initially hesitating, was
thrown out at home on the relay
from first baseman John Fursten
thal. Down by one run at the time,

Stanford lost a chance to change
the complexion of the game.
Evans had Stanford baffled for
most of the game as the majority of
the outs failed to leave the infield.
The Golden Bear starter, who
throws a two-seam fastball which
moves down and in to right-han
ders, induced the Cardinal to
ground out 15 times and added
another seven outs on strike outs.
Only one Stanford out came on a fly
ball.
However, California was not the
only team to get a good pitching
performance. Robbins, Stanford's
No. 2 starter in the absence of
Jason Middlebrook, tossed his first
complete game of the year.
Almost matching Evans inning
for inning, Robbins scattered eight
hits over the first eight innings.
Unlike Evans, Robbins seemed to
be constantly in trouble, getting
only one perfect inning and allow
ing at least two baserunners in each

of the first four innings. Time after
time Robbins got key outs to wrig
gle his way out of jams.
In the second inning, with run
ners at second and third with only
one out, he induced Economos to
pop up for the second out and
struck out Lewis to end the inning.
In the fourth, Robbins gave up the
leadofT single but racked up the
first out on a fielder's choice.
Economos then dribbled a
grounder for an infield single to put
runners at first and second. A
passed ball by Hinch moved the
pair up and Robbins then walked
Lewis. However, Robbins escaped
the inning with a double-play
grounder to Dallimore.
The only mark against Robbins
was that he noticeably tired in the
ninth, hurrying his delivery and
giving up four safeties and three
runs. This was no surprise as he
tossed over 140 pitches in the game,
an abnormally high tally.

The breaks all went California's
way. During the bottom of the
eighth inning junior Brian Dal
limore reached on an error by third
baseman Peter Economos to lead
off the inning. Sophomore Eric
Sees, failed twice to sacrifice Dal
limore to second and eventually
grounded into a fielder's choice.
The next batter, Kilburg, hit a hard
groundball up the middle which
took an errant bounce but short
stop Ivan Lewis snagged the high
hopper and got the force at second.
Kilburg then stole second easily
and Carter walked before Hinch
flew out to right to end the inning.
In the ninth, senior Steve Carv
er singled to left to start the inning.
Unlike the series against USC, the
Cardinal failed to score in the ninth
as Allen lined into a double play to
the first baseman.Six inches higher
and Stanford would have had two
on and no outs.The Cardinal ended
up with two outs and none on.
