# Netters shooting for perfection
## Unbeaten Stanford to take on LA teams 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
NCAA schedulers might have
once again saved the best for last.
Today's and tomorrow's matches
at Stanford Tennis Stadium are
the last of the regular season, and
they promise to be some of the
best.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal
men's tennis team (21-0 overall,
8-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
will make a final bid for its sec
ond-ever undefeated regular sea
son when it hosts defending
national champion No. 9 USC
(13-6, 4-4 in the Pac-10) today at
1:30 p.m. and No. 4 UCLA (17-3,
7-1 in the Pac-10) tomorrow at
noon.
Cardinal players have been
downplaying the importance of an
undefeated season, concentrating
instead on the matches at hand
and longer-term objectives.
"If we can win these two
matches, it will give us a lot of
momentum going into NCAA's,"
said freshman Scott Humphries.
Junior Ricky Becker added
"more so than going undefeated,
our goal is to win the NCAA
Championship. Many Stanford
teams of the past have won the
national title without going unde

feated, so going undefeated would
just be extra special for us."
The only Cardinal team to ever
go an entire year without losing
was the 1978 championship
squad that featured NCAA Indi
viduals Champion John McEnroe.
Stanford swept USC and
UCLA earlier this month, 5-2 and
4-3, respectively. In all three of
the previous years in which the
Cardinal accomplished road
sweeps in southern California,
the team also swept the homes
tand and won the national cham
pionship.
No. 4-ranked Brett Hansen

(13-5 in dual matches) will lead
today's Trojan attack against the
Cardinal. A senior transfer from
UC-Irvine, he was defeated by No.
7-ranked sophomore Jeff Salzen
stein (18-3), 6-3, 3-6, 6-0 in USC's
last meeting with Stanford.
In No. 2 singles, the Trojans'
No. 47-ranked Adam Peterson
(13-6) will try for his second con
secutive win over No. 25-ranked
Humphries (14-3). The Cardinal
freshman says he will be "ready to
go" despite a minor muscle pull in
his back that kept him out of last

week's action against Arizona and
Arizona State.
Lukas Hovorka (12-7) could not
figure out Stanford's 36th-ranked
freshman Paul Goldstein (18-2)
earlier this month in the No. 3
slot, bowing out 6-4, 6-0 to the
Stanford freshman.
The job of winning will be made
significantly more difficult for the
Cardinal today if it loses the dou
bles point as it did earlier this
month to the Trojans.
But should the Cardinal win

today, it could not ask for a
tougher team to stand in the way
of a perfect season than UCLA,
even though Stanford has beat the
Bruins twice already this year.
Against the Bruins earlier this
month, the Cardinal squeaked out
a 4-3 victory thanks mostly to the
efforts of the 46th-ranked junior
Jim Thomas (18-2) in No. 4 sin
gles, who won the deciding match
in a memorable 12-10 third-set tie
break victory over Matt Breen.
Both players possessed five match
points apiece in that rubber
match.
"Hopefully we can win a match
without Jim providing the last
minute heroics," Becker said.

Thomas admits "it will be very
difficult to be as exciting as the
first time around," but seems up
to the task should duty call.
"I may be the last person left on
the court, and I wouldn't mind it
being 3-3 again, but the odds of
that happening are not good,"
Thomas said.
But the odds of a close match
are very good. The Bruins are led
by the country's 16th-ranked
Robert Janacek, whose 9-10 dual
match record has come against
tough opponents such as Salzen
stein. The Cardinal junior won his
last match against Janacek, 6-3, 3-
6, 6-3.
No. 34-ranked Eric Taino (13-

5) will face Humphries in the No. 2
position. Taino won their last
match, 6-1, 6-3.
Two of the nation's best fresh
men will duel on Court 3, as Justin
Gimelstob matches his team-lead
ing 16-3 record against Goldstein.
The Bruin prevailed in their previ
ous meeting, 6-2, 6-2.
Stanford won all three doubles
matches against UCLA earlier this
month, and such a performance
could once again give the Cardinal
the upper hand.
"They were in the match last
time and that is going to give them
confidence, so it's important for us
to get off to a good start against
them," Thomas said.
