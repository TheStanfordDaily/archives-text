# Netters shooting for perfection
## Unbeaten Stanford to take on LA teams 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
NCAA schedulers might have
once again saved the best for last.
Today's and tomorrow's matches
at Stanford Tennis Stadium are
the last of the regular season, and
they promise to be some of the
best.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal
men's tennis team (21-0 overall,
8-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
will make a final bid for its sec
ond-ever undefeated regular sea
son when it hosts defending
national champion No. 9 USC
(13-6, 4-4 in the Pac-10) today at
1:30 p.m. and No. 4 UCLA (17-3,
7-1 in the Pac-10) tomorrow at
noon.
Cardinal players have been
downplaying the importance of an
undefeated season, concentrating
instead on the matches at hand
and longer-term objectives.
"If we can win these two
matches, it will give us a lot of
momentum going into NCAA's,"
said freshman Scott Humphries.
Junior Ricky Becker added
"more so than going undefeated,
our goal is to win the NCAA
Championship. Many Stanford
teams of the past have won the
national title without going unde

feated, so going undefeated would
just be extra special for us."
The only Cardinal team to ever
go an entire year without losing
was the 1978 championship
squad that featured NCAA Indi
viduals Champion John McEnroe.
Stanford swept USC and
UCLA earlier this month, 5-2 and
4-3, respectively. In all three of
the previous years in which the
Cardinal accomplished road
sweeps in southern California,
the team also swept the homes
tand and won the national cham
pionship.
No. 4-ranked Brett Hansen

(13-5 in dual matches) will lead
today's Trojan attack against the
Cardinal. A senior transfer from
UC-Irvine, he was defeated by No.
7-ranked sophomore Jeff Salzen
stein (18-3), 6-3, 3-6, 6-0 in USC's
last meeting with Stanford.
In No. 2 singles, the Trojans'
No. 47-ranked Adam Peterson
(13-6) will try for his second con
secutive win over No. 25-ranked
Humphries (14-3). The Cardinal
freshman says he will be "ready to
go" despite a minor muscle pull in
his back that kept him out of last
