# Hot Cardinal squad hopes to roll right over USC, Bruins
## Women's tennis on the road in Los Angeles 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
At home, the fifth-ranked Stanford women's ten
nis team (19-2 overall, 8-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) has the familiar feel of the
Stanford Tennis Stadium, the support of the rowdy
men's swimming squad and the other Cardinal
faithful and the comfort of its own locker room.
On the road against No. 27 USC (8-11, 2-6 in the
Pac-10 South) and No. 6 UCLA (14-7,4-4 in the Pac
-10 South), the Cardinal will have none of that and a
whole lot more from the crowds of Los Angeles.
However, Stanford currently rides into town with
eight straight dual-match victories, including previ
ous wins over these teams, and an undefeated dual
match road record. The Cardinal also downed ninth
ranked Cal in a 5-4 thriller on Wednesday.
Friday's opponent, USC, does boast a recent
impressive win over none other than the Bruins,
which the Trojans beat 5-3 on April 15. USC cur
rently carries a two-match win streak, having
defeated the University of Pacific before upsetting
UCLA.

The Women of Troy have struggled in the Pac-10
South, but can turn on the talent at any time, as
indicated by the win streak. The Cardinal downed
them in USC's recent visit to the Farm, 5-1, elimi
nating the need for doubles with five singles victo
ries.
Sophomore Katie Schlukebir, redshirt senior Kim
Shasby and sophomore Sandra Be Silva all ran away
with their matches in straight sets; freshman Ania
Bleszysnki and redshirt senior Amy Chiminello took
three sets to roll past their opponents. Freshman
Julie Scott will seek revenge for a three-set loss
against Melissa Hernando.
After placing second to the No. 1 team in the
country, Georgia, at the National Team Indoors,
UCLA seemed a serious threat to vie for the NCAA
championship in May. Since its visit to StpnfnrH,
however, UCLA has dropped four straight dual
matches, including a pair of extremely disappointing
ones to Pacific and USC.
The Bruins view this last weekend of dual-match
competition as crucial to their NCAA tournament
seeding with No. 5 Stanford and No.
9 California coming to town. Yet
both the Cardinal and the Bears
propelled UCLA into its tailspin.
Stanford, in the midst of a tear,
dropped the Bruins 6-3, as the Car
dinal took the back four singles
matches and the back two doubles
matches for the win. Chiminello
and Scott cruised in straight sets,
and Shasby, starting a run of cham
pionship tennis that only seems to
be gaining momentum, played mind
games with headcase Paige
Yaroshuk for a three-set win, 4-6,6-
2,6-4.
UCLA did hand the Cardinal one
of its two losses this season, a 5-4
defeat at the National Team
Indoors. The exit marked Stan
ford's earliest since the tournament
moved to Madison, Wis., eight years
ago.
However, the Bruins may be
hosting Stanford at the wrong time.
Shasby has been on a roll lately —
she recently moved up to the No. 2
spot in the lineup, trading with
Bleszysnki at No. 3, and seems to be
even stronger there. The Cardinal
doubles squads have also started to
click, as demonstrated by the
incredible comeback in Wednes
day's match against Cal. Both the
No. 2 squad, Shasby and sophomore
Emily Burt, and the No. 3 tandem,
Scott and junior Beth Berris, fought
back from late deficits. Both battled
back from triple match points.
The Cardinal looks to complete
the Pac-10 South circuit with an
unblemished record. With five of six
of the division's teams constantly in
the country's top 10, Stanford
would be making a case for a strong
seed in the NCAA championships
this May at Pepperdine.
