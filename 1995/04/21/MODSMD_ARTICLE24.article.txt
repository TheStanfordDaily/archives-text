# Volleyball sets sights on Final Four appearance
## Spikers' first hurdle takes the form of BYU's Cougars 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team will start climbing to
the NCAA championship summit.
Brigham Young University will
try its hardest to knock Stanford
off on its way to the peak, but the
Cougars will have a hard time dis
lodging an electrified Cardinal
squad.
This weekend is the first round
of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation's tournament to
determine which West Coast
team will be sent to the Final
Four. Stanford feels that it must
win this tournament to reach the
Final Four because it doubts it
would receive the at-large berth
over UCLA or Hawaii. Other than
the Bruins, all the teams in the
tournament are playing for their
season this weekend.
"Any one of these eight teams
could go to the Final Four, so
there's a lot on the line," coach
Ruben Nieves said. "Everybody is
definitely playing for something."
In this extremely competitive
atmosphere, the Cardinal must
fend off quality, hungry teams
three weekends in a row. Its first
opponent, BYU, is the only team
that has defeated Stanford two
times this season. Nevertheless,
the Cardinal is confident of a vic
tory.
"We know it's a team that we
can beat," Nieves said. "We know
it won't be easy though. We have
more confidence facing them than
you might think since we are 0-2
against them."
Although BYU fields middle
blocker Kevin Hambly, who con
vincingly leads the country in
blocking, junior swing-hitter
Mike Lambert feels that Stan
ford's edge in personnel will carry
it to success.
"Our team is a lot more talent
ed, player to player," Lambert
said.
The Cougars spoiled a five
match winning streak for Stan
ford two weeks ago. That match
continues to frustrate Stanford
players because of the low level of
play involved and because of some
very controversial officiating.
"We want a chance to get back
at them," said sophomore setter
Stewart Chong, "to put to rest
any questions about that match."
The quiet but intense rivalry
between these two schools has
developed in a relatively short
space of time. Though every year
Stanford must face perennial
powerhouse UCLA, winning in
Provo, Utah is still one of the
toughest challenges of the season.
Tomorrow will be a rematch of
last year's tournament finals
where the Cardinal beat the then
No. 2 Cougars and eliminated
them from the Final Four.

BYU is one of the top blocking
teams in the nation, but Stanford
kept pace with them in their last
meeting. In the end, the Cardinal
led in every statistical category in
that match, but still could not
pull out a win.

"They have to be given credit
for finding a way to win, for han ;•
ing in there," Nieves said. "Vve
can't have the kinds of lapses that
we've been having. We have to

exert a killer instinct like we did
against USC and Pepperdine."
Beginning this weekend, Stan
ford's margin of error will be vir
tually zero because the team feels
that it must win five straight
matches to gain the NCAA crown.
Lambert will shoulder much of
Stanford's weight through these
intense battles.
"There's no way we could
think that we have a shot at the
national championship if he were
not playing the way he is," Nieves
said.
Nieves also cited the consistent
passing of swing-hitters freshman

Tad Hoffman, sophomore Matt
Fuerbringer and Lambert, and
the steady, reliable setting of
Chong as keys to a successful
post-season.
All technical analyses aside,
the Cardinal is just plain fired-up
to rip through the tournament.
Last year's unbelievable denial to
the Final Four has provided the
fuel for much of its fire. However,
this year's young team is also
roused because it recognizes that
it really can go all the way.
"I'm extremely pumped up,"
Lambert said. "I actually think
I'm going to have to calm down a
little. I need to remain patient, or
else I'll be out there wanting to
kill them in like 10 seconds.
Everyone is going to be just as
pumped."
