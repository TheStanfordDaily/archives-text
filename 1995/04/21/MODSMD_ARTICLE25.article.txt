# Tyra Holt and Jen Dalton lead the women's pole vault movement here on the Farm
## 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
In an event that has been known as one of the last
bastions of masculinity in track and field, pole vault
is no longer just for the boys. The women have now
arrived. Sophomore Tyra Holt and junior Jennifer
Dalton represent the Stanford track team as two of
the top five jumpers in the United States.
USA Track and Field held the first indoor nation
al competition of women's pole vault this year in
Atlanta, Ga. where Holt finished third in the nation
and Dalton ninth. Next year at the Olympics it will
be an exhibition event.
Neither Holt nor Dalton came to Stanford expect
ing to be so successful, especially not in the pole
vault. At the end of last year coaches Casey Roche
and Mark Reiff approached then-freshman Tyra
Holt about competing. As Holt tells the story, her
coaches were in a humorous mood.
"At the end of last year, coach Reiff came up to me
and asked if I would like to do the pole vault because
I have the strength and the speed and best of all, I'm
a little crazy," she says with a smile.
Holt may have been crazy not to try the pole vault
earlier. Until last week she shared the American
record with an 11 feet 6 1/4 inch jump at last
month's Stanford Invitational. The most incredible
part of Holt's amazing rise in the vaulting world is
that she only started six months ago. The new
record holder, Melissa Price, is a high school senior
who has been jumping for almost three years.
When Holt started the pole vault last October,
junior Jennifer Dalton decided that she too would
like to try, and the rest has been pole vaulting histo
ry for the Cardinal duo.
Twice a week, Holt and Dalton join the rest of the
pole vaulters on the team (all men) for practice. The
pole vault requires a complicated combination of
upper body strength, running speed, endurance,
flawless technique and, most of all, fearlessness.
Detractors are quick to point out that women just
don't possess the natural strength to pole vault well.
Holt and Dalton take exception to that comment.
"Sure it's a really technical thing because of the
strength and speed and technique, and what woman
can do that?" Holt asks rhetorically with more than
a little exasperation at the outdated view.
"In high school someone told me that women
couldn't pole vault because it would ruin their pelvic
bones and then they couldn't have children," Dalton
adds with a laugh.
Apparently the NCAA has yet to join the 19905.
Although USA Track and Field officially contests
the women's pole vault, the NCAA has not made any
comment on the future of the sport at the collegiate
level.
Holt and Dalton agree that thp NCAA maintains

a rather dated outlook on women's athletics. Unfor
tunately, collegiate athletics remains mired in a tra
ditionalist view that discourages the introduction of
new events.
"Ten years ago people would have laughed at
women pole vaulting," Holt says. "But now people
are giving us some respect for what we have accom
plished in the past year."
"I would say this has really been a catalyst year
for the women's pole vault," Dalton says, picking up
where Holt left off. "With five women jumping over
11 feet this year we've definitely earned the respect,
and we can do a lot better."
Dalton feels that one reason the Pacific 10 Con
ference and the NCAA have been slow to adopt the
sport is the West Coast concentration of standouts.
With Holt and Dalton from Stanford and Chase
from UCLA all in the top-five in the nation, the Pac
-10 would have a tremendous advantage.
In only six months, Stanford has become the
heart of women's pole vaulting. Dalton attributes
their quick rise to success to the Cardinal men pole
vaulters who have been supporting them through
out the year.
But in contrast to the more experienced men, Dal
ton feels that her relative newness to the sport actu
ally helps in some respects.
"Unlike the guys, we don't have the built-in
habits to resist our coaching. The naivetd helps us to
put our faith in our coaches," she says.
And the coaches Casey Roche and Mark Reiff
deserve much of the credit for the success of the Car
dinal jumping tandem. They have prepared the two
in the last six months from total beginners to
national leaders in the event.
"We owe all of our success to the training that
Casey has given us and the conditioning and
strengthening that coach Reiff has worked with us,"
Dalton says.
Holt brought some of her strength from the great
agricultural Midwest where she grew up in Rinard,
Illinois, a town of about 75 people. Among the corn,
wheat, horses and cows on her family farm, Holt
started her climb to prominence.
"My Dad says I grew up chasing the pigs and cows
and that's why I'm so fast."
In the last three years of high school Holt won
two state 400-meter titles and lost only one race, at
the state championship meet during her senior year
where she finished second.
Losing is something that Holt is not accustomed
to, but shr remains philosophical about the chal
lenge giate competition.
"I li use, I'm not used to it, but you have to
know how to win and how to lose. It's not a matter
of winning or losing but of knowing how to do bet
ter."
Holt is an unassuming woman who seems gen

uinely overwhelmed by the amount of publicity her
American record gained.
"It's just a title, it's nothing," said Holt with a
slight giggle. "I'm just a Midwestern girl."
Roche is confident that I lolt will soon take back
the American record and continue to improve.
"I expect Tyra to beat Price's record and improve
on it without looking back," he says.
Holt sets her goals high though, 13 feet to be
exact — that's the height she hopes to jump at the
USA Track and Field National Championships June
17 in Sacramento to become the first American
women at that height.
"Tyra surely has the potential to do 13 this year
and Jen's not far behind her," Roche says.
"Right now Jen and Tyra's main goal is to jump
13 so they can compete in Europe this summer
against the Chinese and the Russians who lead this
event internationally."
While Holt is a small town product, Jennifer Dal
ton grew up on the West Coast in the glitz and neon
of Reno, Nev., where her father is a high school foot
ball coach. In high school, Dalton concentrated on
two of her favorites: volleyball and basketball, and
although she was offered scholarships for those
sports, Dalton came to Stanford for track and field.

"Volleyball and basketball used to be my passion
back then, but now my passion is the pole vault. I
love it."
In her first two years on the team Dalton concen
trated on the 400-meter hurdles. Like Holt she did a
little gymnastics when she was younger which has
helped in the physically demanding event.
Last week at Mt. San Antonio College, Dalton
jumped a personal best 11 feet to take second place
in a competitive national field, while Holt, fighting a
tough cold, finished in fourth. Throughout the sea
son they have found themselves competing against
one another as much as the opposition. Fortunately,
they can use their common love of the event to bring
themselves closer.
"It's great to have someone to train with because
we can encourage each other," Dalton says as she
hugs a beaming Holt.
After 1996 Holt and Dalton are looking even fur
ther down the road to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,
Australia. By 2000, Holt believes that women will
finally be able to compete in the decathlon like Dan
and Dave, and she hopes to be among the first
women to contest the ten-event challenge.
"We need that equality," Holt says matter-of-fact
ly.'

arrived. Sophomore Tyra Holt and junior Jennifer
Dalton represent the Stanford track team as two of
the top five jumpers in the United States.
USA Track and Field held the first indoor nation
al competition of women's pole vault this year in
Atlanta, Ga. where Holt finished third in the nation
and Dalton ninth. Next year at the Olympics it will
be an exhibition event.
Neither Holt nor Dalton came to Stanford expect
ing to be so successful, especially not in the pole
vault. At the end of last year coaches Casey Roche
and Mark Reiff approached then-freshman Tyra
Holt about competing. As Holt tells the story, her
coaches were in a humorous mood.
"At the end of last year, coach Reiff came up to me
and asked if I would like to do the pole vault because
I have the strength and the speed and best of all, I'm
a little crazy," she says with a smile.
Holt may have been crazy not to try the pole vault
earlier. Until last week she shared the American
record with an 11 feet 6 1/4 inch jump at last
month's Stanford Invitational. The most incredible
part of Holt's amazing rise in the vaulting world is
that she only started six months ago. The new
record holder, Melissa Price, is a high school senior
who has been jumping for almost three years.
When Holt started the pole vault last October,
junior Jennifer Dalton decided that she too would
like to try, and the rest has been pole vaulting histo
ry for the Cardinal duo.
Twice a week, Holt and Dalton join the rest of the
pole vaulters on the team (all men) for practice. The
pole vault requires a complicated combination of
upper body strength, running speed, endurance,
flawless technique and, most of all, fearlessness.
Detractors are quick to point out that women just
don't possess the natural strength to pole vault well.
Holt and Dalton take exception to that comment.
"Sure it's a really technical thing because of the
strength and speed and technique, and what woman
can do that?" Holt asks rhetorically with more than
a little exasperation at the outdated view.
"In high school someone told me that women
couldn't pole vault because it would ruin their pelvic
bones and then they couldn't have children," Dalton
adds with a laugh.
Apparently the NCAA has yet to join the 19905.
Although USA Track and Field officially contests
the women's pole vault, the NCAA has not made any
comment on the future of the sport at the collegiate
level.
Holt and Dalton agree that thp NCAA maintains

a rather dated outlook on women's athletics. Unfor
tunately, collegiate athletics remains mired in a tra
ditionalist view that discourages the introduction of
new events.
"Ten years ago people would have laughed at
women pole vaulting," Holt says. "But now people
are giving us some respect for what we have accom
plished in the past year."
"I would say this has really been a catalyst year
for the women's pole vault," Dalton says, picking up
where Holt left off. "With five women jumping over
11 feet this year we've definitely earned the respect,
and we can do a lot better."
Dalton feels that one reason the Pacific 10 Con
ference and the NCAA have been slow to adopt the
sport is the West Coast concentration of standouts.
With Holt and Dalton from Stanford and Chase
from UCLA all in the top-five in the nation, the Pac
-10 would have a tremendous advantage.
In only six months, Stanford has become the
heart of women's pole vaulting. Dalton attributes
their quick rise to success to the Cardinal men pole
vaulters who have been supporting them through
out the year.
But in contrast to the more experienced men, Dal
ton feels that her relative newness to the sport actu
ally helps in some respects.
"Unlike the guys, we don't have the built-in
habits to resist our coaching. The naivetd helps us to
put our faith in our coaches," she says.
And the coaches Casey Roche and Mark Reiff
deserve much of the credit for the success of the Car
dinal jumping tandem. They have prepared the two
in the last six months from total beginners to
national leaders in the event.
"We owe all of our success to the training that
Casey has given us and the conditioning and
strengthening that coach Reiff has worked with us,"
Dalton says.
Holt brought some of her strength from the great
agricultural Midwest where she grew up in Rinard,
Illinois, a town of about 75 people. Among the corn,
wheat, horses and cows on her family farm, Holt
started her climb to prominence.
"My Dad says I grew up chasing the pigs and cows
and that's why I'm so fast."
In the last three years of high school Holt won
two state 400-meter titles and lost only one race, at
the state championship meet during her senior year
where she finished second.
Losing is something that Holt is not accustomed
to, but shr remains philosophical about the chal
lenge giate competition.
"I li use, I'm not used to it, but you have to
know how to win and how to lose. It's not a matter
of winning or losing but of knowing how to do bet
ter."
Holt is an unassuming woman who seems gen

uinely overwhelmed by the amount of publicity her
American record gained.
"It's just a title, it's nothing," said Holt with a
slight giggle. "I'm just a Midwestern girl."
Roche is confident that I lolt will soon take back
the American record and continue to improve.
"I expect Tyra to beat Price's record and improve
on it without looking back," he says.
Holt sets her goals high though, 13 feet to be
exact — that's the height she hopes to jump at the
USA Track and Field National Championships June
17 in Sacramento to become the first American
women at that height.
"Tyra surely has the potential to do 13 this year
and Jen's not far behind her," Roche says.
"Right now Jen and Tyra's main goal is to jump
13 so they can compete in Europe this summer
against the Chinese and the Russians who lead this
event internationally."
While Holt is a small town product, Jennifer Dal
ton grew up on the West Coast in the glitz and neon
of Reno, Nev., where her father is a high school foot
ball coach. In high school, Dalton concentrated on
two of her favorites: volleyball and basketball, and
although she was offered scholarships for those
sports, Dalton came to Stanford for track and field.

"Volleyball and basketball used to be my passion
back then, but now my passion is the pole vault. I
love it."
In her first two years on the team Dalton concen
trated on the 400-meter hurdles. Like Holt she did a
little gymnastics when she was younger which has
helped in the physically demanding event.
Last week at Mt. San Antonio College, Dalton
jumped a personal best 11 feet to take second place
in a competitive national field, while Holt, fighting a
tough cold, finished in fourth. Throughout the sea
son they have found themselves competing against
one another as much as the opposition. Fortunately,
they can use their common love of the event to bring
themselves closer.
"It's great to have someone to train with because
we can encourage each other," Dalton says as she
hugs a beaming Holt.
After 1996 Holt and Dalton are looking even fur
ther down the road to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,
Australia. By 2000, Holt believes that women will
finally be able to compete in the decathlon like Dan
and Dave, and she hopes to be among the first
women to contest the ten-event challenge.
"We need that equality," Holt says matter-of-fact
ly.'
