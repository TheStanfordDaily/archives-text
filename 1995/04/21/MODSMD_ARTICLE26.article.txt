Rugby
The second-ranked men's rugby team travels to San Diego this weekend to compete for a Final Four
berth at the Regional Playoffs. In order for the squad's dream to come true, they most likely have to
knock off the number one team in the nation, rival California. The Cardinal has not defeated the Gold
en Bears in 17 years.
Crew
The men's and women's crew teams reach the mid-point of their seasons this weekend when they
host Oregon State and Long Beach State on Saturday and UC-Irvine on Sunday at Redwood Shores in
Redwood City.
Softball
The Stanford softball team (10-26 overall, 1-17 in the Pac-10) felt the stick of Tonya Harding yes
terday at top-ranked UCLA (32-2, 15-1 in the Pac-10). The Bruin pitcher not only tossed a 10-0
shutout in the second game of a doubleheader, but also drilled a two-run homer to finish 3-5 on the
day with three RBls. In the opener, the Cardinal fell 11-1. Stanford hitters only managed five hits total
in the two games.
