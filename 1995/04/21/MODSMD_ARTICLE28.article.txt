# Ballons at my burial: plan a two-keg funeral
## 
### 
Ihad the good fortune, last week, to attend
a funeral. He was a wonderful man who I
didn't know at all — a patriarchal grand
father of a large family, loved by more people
than Oprah's seen donuts, cared for by a life
time of friends and acquaintances who all
consecrated a Sunday to sob around a casket.
And now he's dead.
Dozens cry and hundreds grieve yet the
body miraculously stays still. Considering
how little effect so much misery has on the
actual outcome I have to wonder if the famil
iar funeral is the best way to say farewell. So
many in mourning. . . Somber outfits bought
and used only for such occasions. . . Flowers
that only would have made me go all histemic.
Its just not very chipper, is it?
The funeral phenomenon seems to consist
of little more than collecting everyone you've
ever met who's within a plane-flight's reach
and wrecking their whole day by making
them miserable in your honor. Not that it
wouldn't be somewhat of a Scooby snack for
the ego to have everyone talk about how cool
and how cute I was and how many lives I
must have saved in my days as a costumed
vigilante. Bleary eyes and gooshy Kleenex
and a whole bunch of people sullenly blub
bering as a rabbi quotes from Deuteronomy.
Neat for a while, sure, but it's still just
fishing for compliments a little too late, if
you ask me.
After experiencing this recent dose of
Thanatos, I'm starting to think I'd rather

have people giggling than weeping at my
goodbye luncheon. I'm starting to think a lit
tle differently — a little festively.. .
If an egregious burp collapses my lungs
and I accordingly asphyxiate, let there be no
morose commemoration. I want a party. I
want everyone dressed all bright 'n' cheery.
Shiny happy colors and a whole lot of cotton
whites to look cool under the glo-lites.
Or better yet, should a Cheeto lodge in my
artery and I become coffin fodder, let's make
my memorial service a costume party. Come
as your favorite cause of death.
Figure it this way: My funeral is my last big
event. Mine. If you want to say goodbye, write
me a note. If you're feeling sorry for yourself
because you'll miss me, well that's sweet but
misguided. Miss me on your own time. Start
crying once I'm six feet out of earshot. But
while my soulless chassis remains above
ground let's see some ice cream.
So if an all-Twizzler diet has me die of
malnutrition, lets see some smiles. Some
happy faces. Commemorate my death with
the kind of thing that would have annoyed
the hell out of me in life.
The crying and the wailing — it only would
have depressed me. So should I catch the
Motaba virus and have my innards liquefied,
should I fall asleep in a tanning booth and
turn into Dork jerky, I want balloons, I want
a clown. I want someone to announce: "In
lieu of flowers please send Icees to the UJA."
No talk of wasted potential and how awful
for that Coke machine to have tipped over

and crushed a mind so young.
No maudlin Psalms. No jogging through
the valley of the shadow of death. Just crank
up some ABBA tunes and start shakin' some
boo-tay.
Rejoice at my demise — make it a two-keg
funeral. A shiva-wake with good kosher
catering. Like my bar mitzvah, only with
more sequined dancers.
Let the eulogy read: "Well, it's tragic how
his prostate burst right through his ass like
that, but let us recall how Michael was dumb
enough to believe — convinced even — that
there is some kind of life after death. At least
now he knows better."
Let the kaddish end: ". . . ve-al kol Yisroel
ve-imeru I hope they have chocolate milk
wherever he is. Oh well, I get his stereo."
As with life, is seems that your celebration
of death depends entirely on what your goals
are. If you want people's final impression to
be one of ritualistic morbidity instead of rem
iniscent mirth, go on ahead. It's your day.
But if you're planning on laying this body
to rest you'd better book a good band. I want
to be sure everyone's having a damn good
time.
