## Fac Sen postpones vote, awaits federal regulations 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate today postponed its vote on
a recommendation to change the number of aca
demic units granted for activities courses.
The vote was delayed pending investigation of
federal financial aid regulations that might afiect
the decision.
The senate's Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement recommended that the current
limit of 12 units of credit toward graduation in
activities courses be maintained but that a maxi
mum of four of these units be allowed to come from
any one department.
This recommendation came in response to a pro
posal by the Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion last October to eliminate credit for activity
courses altogether.
Senators debated the proposal and the issue of
whether academic credit should be granted for
activity courses at all â€” expressing concern that a
change might make some Stanford students ineligi
ble for financial aid or NCAA competition.
According to federal financial aid regulations, a
student gets aid for "work you are doing that will
get you your degree," said University Registrar
Roger Printup.
A decision not to count the units toward degrees
might jeopardize financial aid, he said.
The NCAA requires that varsity athletes take a

minimum of 12 units of course work during the
quarter in which their sport is in season.
Participation in a varsity sport earns a Stanford
student two units per quarter, so under the com
mittee's proposal after two seasons credits for com
petition would no longer count toward the 180 units
needed for graduation.
If two of an athlete's 12 units for the quarter
were not going to count toward graduation, the
NCAA might rule that the student is not full time
and therefore ineligible to compete, Printup said.
At the senate meeting, Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood, a member of the Commission on Under
graduate Education, explained the commission's
recommendation to discontinue the practice of giv
ing any academic credit for activity courses, saying
"we thought it was silly to give credit where credit
was not due.
Debate focused particularly on athletics courses,
as senators argued for and against their value as
part of education.
"I'm very disturbed by this notion that athletes
can't take a regukir course load," said English Prof.
John Bender.
But Business School Prof. Jerry Porras said
sports have "been an arena for great pride" for
Stanford.
Athletes also learn analytic and problem-solv
ing skills while participating, Porras said, adding
that these skills are important to learn while in
college.
