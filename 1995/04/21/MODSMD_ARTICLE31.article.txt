# Students can't study abroad
## Five students denied opportunity to travel to Kyoto due to their failure to meet language requirement 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
After failing to meet the minimum language
requirements for Stanford's program in Kyoto, five
students were told days before they planned to leave
that they would not be able to attend the Japanese
program this spring.
The students — who had already applied and been
accepted into the program last year — could not
attend because of an Overseas Studies policy that
requires that students complete a certain number of
required classes.
"There is a policy that all students fulfill a minimal
language requirement. They agreed to do so by accept
ing admission (into the programl," said Russell
Berman, director of Overseas Studies.
Because they did not finish the language require
ment, the students were told that they would not be
able to travel to Japan at the beginning of the quarter.
For some students, however, this caused problems.
Junior Jennifer Jennings was told that she would
not be able to attend the program the night before she
was planning to fly to Japan. She had originally
planned to spend an extra week in Tokyo before the
program started.
Another accepted student, junior Yuji Higaki, was
told a week and a half before he was to fly to Japan.
His ticket, however, was refundable.
The students were also forced to find housing at
Stanford and choose classes after they were told they
were no longer a part of the program.
Jennings said that Overseas Studies was not able to
help her. However, Higaki said that Overseas Studies
staff were "really good at taking care of me after
wards."
Both Jennings and Higaki dropped the second

quarter of their first-year Japanese class during win
ter quarter, which is required for the program.
According to Berman, the acceptance letter clearly
spells out that students have to finish the language
requirement.
"In order to participate, students apply and if
accepted they are given a contract they must acknowl
edge," Berman said.
"Students who attempt to go overseas without
meeting the minimal language requirement may be
engaging in a violation of the Fundamental Stan
dard," Berman added.
"By dropping the class, I made a poor decision and
I regret the decision," Higaki said.
"My removal from the program was my fault. I
didn't finish the requirement and that's the bottom
line," Higaki added.
But both students pointed out that there was a
large number of students who were told that they
could not attend the program. The Kyoto program
currently accepts a total of 30 students per quarter.
According to Jennings, there were "extenuating
circumstances [for the students] that were not taken
into consideration" by Overseas Studies. Jennings
said she was forced to drop second-quarter Japanese
because her previous coursework in the Japanese for
Business Professionals course did not prepare her suf
ficiently.
Higaki added that there might have been "serious
oversights" or communication problems in the Kyoto
program.
Students were not the only ones affected by the
expulsion. Since Kyoto combines a spring quarter and
a summer internship, the companies that offer intern
ships were not pleased.
Berman, however, said that he believed "that the
fences have been mended."
