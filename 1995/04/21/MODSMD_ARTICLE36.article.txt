I tic s|>11 ill i<il and geographical i en
ter ol the new San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art is an enormous atrium
lobb\ and grand staircase, shooting six
stories up to a slanted rotunda.
Near its top, the atrium is traversed
by a bridge connecting the staircase to
the filth-floor galleries. Looking down
through the wire mesh floor of that
bridge, one in struck b\ an image that
might hang on the walls ol SFMOMA
itself: bits of light, parts ol people's
heads and a di//ving view through live
floors are mixed together and framed
by white, metallic rectangles.
Such a picture would seem at home
among the works in the museum; one
t ail imagine how it might be executed
by Andy Warhol, Alexander ( .alder or
Henri Matisse. In fact, that piece might
be the museum's centerpiece for, as ol
now, it isn't the art collection which is
the best part of SFMOMA â€” there are
bettei museums with biggei collections
and more famous works. 1 lie most
interesting part of the museum is the
building itself.
Designed In Swiss architect Mario
Botta, the brand-new edifice is a cav
ernous brick bulk. Ii was opened in late
January of this year and is a vast
improvement upon the SFMOMA's old
home: two floors of a Depression-era
building. While its lobby, a black and
gray granite design accented with light
wood, creates a dramatic and attention
grabbing entrance, the galleries them
selves are unobtrusive, airv. I hey're also
well organized; one room flows into
another, leaving the visitor without
question of where lie's already been,
where he needs to go, or whether to
fork right or left.
Currently, the galleries are filled with
displavs including a special exhibition
on tlie design ol the new building, the
photographv ol William Klein, and a
grim multimedia exhibit entitled "Public
Information: Desire, Disaster,
Document.''
flie last includes everything from
photographs ol riots to Warhol images
ol firemen and suicide victims. I he
most interesting part of the exhibit is a
set ol videoc amei as and televisions
rigged with a time-delas device. I lie two
pairs of c ameras and FY screens are
arranged back-to-back, and each camera
is attached to the opposite monitor. I lie
device allows vou to smile into a camera,

then walk to the other screen and watch
yourself grin. Compounding ibis eerie
effect are two mirrors which allow you to
see both screens simultaneously. You
can watch the action in one screen and
then see it reflected in the mirror
moments later.
In addition to the special exhibits,
portions of the museum's permanent
collection are on display. I he collec
tion includes paintings, photography,
sculpture and design objects. Fvett the
whopping 225,000 square feet ol the
new building, however, allow space for
display of a mere 1,500 pieces from
the museum's total collection ol
15,000.
I he permanent collection does con
tain some pieces worth noting.
SFMOMA owns Matisse's "Woman with
the Hat," which spurred a critic to coin
Matisse's stvle ftmve (wild animal). I lie
painting, which depicts the head and
upper body ol Matisse s wile, is a bright
wash of hi illiant hues.
Of course, as with any modern art
museum, the displays at SFMOMA con
tain a number ol pieces of debatable
artistic merit. One such work on display
is an 1.(1) screen, much like those used
to scroll stock quotes, spouting various
absurd and, one assumes, theoretically
pithy phrases: "I like a circle ol bodies
whose hands do what thev should;''

"There is pleasure in stopping my flesh
when it does wrong."
I he museum is also showing a collec
tion <>l photographs ol price tags and
s.iles slips from the Ksprit de Corps
dothing company. Another display fea
tures ,i collection of chairs, which range
from ordinary plvwood designs to those
made of plexiglass and imbedded with
artificial loses.
I Itimately, as should be true with any
museum, voui opinion will rely on your
reaction to the art inside. If you like
modern art, vou'll like SFMOMA.
Whatever your opinion of such work,
the museum is worth a visit. With so
much on display, all but the most die
hard anti-modernists will find some
thing appealing.
At least go to see the building, the
rotunda of which was described by
Newsweek as "a penne from heaven."
It's certainlv worth the Caltrain fare.

To get to SFMOMA, take the C.nltrain to
San Fromisco's Fourth Street station. The

line use n(I Street one block northeast and

to 6 j).m. daily except for Thursdays, when
