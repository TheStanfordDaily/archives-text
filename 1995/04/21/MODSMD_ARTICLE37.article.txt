Spring Quarter. A time lor slowing
down the academic juggernaut and
turning up the volume on lun.
For exotic thrills that don't require a
Swiss bank account or a passport, look
no further than the cultural mecca to
the north. San Francisco is tilled with
cultural enclaves that can overwhelm the
senses of the average Stanford student.
Don't believe it? Fry going to
Chinatown on a Sundav afternoon lot
lunch without someone who knows the
territory. Ihe locals will jostle and toss
you about like yesterday's Dailv in ;i
recycling bin.
But the point of tins trek is to have
tun, right? So while yout senses ill be
assaulted by a cacophony of sights, tastes
and smells, these instructions should
help you to have an enjoyable time
exploring a vibrant ethnic community
and getting out ot there with minimal
damage to vour wallet and sanity
Perhaps the most important thing to
tell you is what to eat when you're up
there. There is a vast assortment of eat
ing establishments and restaurants in
the area, most of which are prettv tasty
and fairly inexpensive. I he competition
for patrons in Chinatown so fierce that
keeps prices low and quality good. A
string of good places to eat is located on
Pacific and Grant Streets.
Be prepared for a shock when vou go
into one of these restaurants. I he ser
vice makes French waiters look conge
nial Fake no offense; it's the style of the
place. While the waiters will probably
get around to taking your order, you'll
have to tackle one of them to get perks
like ice water and a supply of forks they
keep in a drawer for gwc-l(nt's(foreign
devils) who can't handle the tradition
al chopsticks. t

[
Dim Sum is possibl) the lt*asi
painless and most delightful wav to
sample Chinese cuisine without
being surprised at what you get. It's
not so much a particular dish as a
style of cooking and food service, i
An assortment of dishes to titillate *
and tantalize even the most finicky
palate arc- wheeled around the din
ing area. Customers point to what

looks interesting and ii\ served up.
Hi- sin e. however, to .inL il vou n not
quite sure what you're* getting. 1 love all
Dim Sum dishes, but some of m\ Iriends
just can't seem to get past the mental
iiiu ertaintN ol c hewing
on mat inated

<lii( ken feet or nj>ii\ cow tripe.
Most ot tlit,' women wlu> push the
< aits an able to explain what you're
ordering if you're not quite Mire what's
on the plate. But heware: these sweet
women have the stone-cold heart of
ruthless capitalists. lhe\ will trv to sell
von everything the\ peddle on
their pushcarts regardless ol how
mill h vou\e already eaten.
Once vour appetite is satisfied,
you'll he reach to hit the streets
and browse through the shops
that are densely packed along
the streets. I he shop keepers
.in- usually quite hclplul and
greet you with disarming smiles
You can get everything from V
rated fortune cookies lor a Imk k ,t
do/en to Chinese antiques worth
thousands ol dollars.
Most ol the stnil here is compar
atively inexpensive. Delicate porce
lain sculptures that would comple
ment am undergraduate's meager
possessions go lor around $41). (><>
ahead, tub Buddha's belly. Shop
keepers are pretty lenient about you
fondling t he men handise.
| Vnd lot those ol you yvho have a
leys dollars left aftei paying the
tuition bills, Chinatown It.is some
very nice jeyveln shops. II you don't
see anything you like, chances are
the jeweler can probably have it c 1 1>
torn made. You'll appreciate the qual
ity ol the workmanship, and prices are
quite reasonable lor the purity ol gold
you're getting.
I he next matter ol important e is hoys
to get there. I he Caltrain deposits you
in doys ntown San Franc isco lot about
S(>..~>() roundtrip. (latch the HO Stockton
or the lj I nion St. bus from the sta
tion. I he bus passes through some
attractive and "touristy" sections ol
toyvn that you may yvant to come back
to y isit later. When the bus goes though
the Stockton Street tunnel, and you see
all the signs are in ( liinese characters,
you'll know you're in Chinatown. I he
same bus yyill take you back to the
train station lor about tyso bucks
roundtrip.
I highly recommend taking the train
instead ol a cai il you're planning on
just a day trip into the city San
