Fogarty makes delicious red wines as
well. His cabernet sauvignon, made with
grapes grown in Napa Valley's famous
Carneros region, is a very complex wine,
and the '87, a particularly robust vin
tage, may open up to outdo the critically
acclaimed '85 crop, White said.
The pinot noir, like the chardonnay,
is made with grapes grown on 26 acres
of the Fogarty property, and the 2,000
foot elevation, ricn soil and moist cli
mate have proven perfect for those two
grapes.
Wine tasting and tours of the Thomas
Fogarty Winery are available by appoint
ment only, beginning after May 4. To
make an appointment call 851-6777.
Another beautiful winery to visit is
Woodside Vineyards on the King's
Mountain Road in Woodside. Set against
a spectacular backdrop of the heavily
wooded King's Mountain, its views rival

those from the Fogarty winery.
Proprietor Bob Mullen Dought the
property where the wineiy is located in
1961 and built the house ne lives in and
the winery a year later. The two acres of
vineyards on the premises are planted
with half chardonnay and half pinot
noir, which thrive in Woodside.
"Woodside is particularly well suited for
chardonnay," Mullen said. "The climate
is right, and the soil is right."
Mullen's winery also takes care of
vineyards on 19 other pieces of property
in the area, and produces cabernet
sauvignons and zinfandels in addition to
chardonnays and pinot noirs. He pro
vides viticultural services, and usually
purchases the grapes from the vine
yards' owners in return. In fact, he has
just started making a sparkling wine for
the first time with grapes grown on the
property of former Stanford football
head coach Bill Walsh.
Winemaker Brian Caselden has been
in the wine business all his life, having
grown up in Saratoga, and it shows from
his wines — the chardonnay was
absolutely marvelous. It's a lot easier to

make delicious wines "when you're
working with great grapes from
Woodside," Caselden said.
Mullen recently decided to expand
his operations as well, and started
actively planting new vineyards four
years ago. Making wine "started off as a
nobby,' said Mullen, but then became
more serious, although he still clearly
loves his work (as well as the fruit of his
labors).
Woodside Vineyards sells all of its
wine locally — 80 percent is sold right
out of the winery, and the rest is sold in
Robert's Store in Woodside and restau
rants from Palo Alto to Burlingame,
including the Caf6 Pro Bono. The wines
sell for between $10 and $24 per bottle,
and they are well worth every dollar.
Tastings are available to small
groups of at least six to eight people by
appointment. Other tastings are sched
uled for Memorial Day weekend and
the weekends before and after. To
make an appointment for a group tast
ing or request an invitation to one of
the regularly scheduled tastings, call
851-3144.
