# An octopus' garden

Fins, feelers and flippers, alone with
lessons in the dangers and delights of
the underwater world, fill the Monterey
Bay Aquarium, an alternative destina
tion to the beaches for a weekend trip
off the Farm.
Offering a glimpse of life in and
around Monterey Bay, the aquarium
provides a mixture of fun exhibits with a
litde bit of science, although not enough
to take you back to any classes from
which you are escaping.
A tour through the museum, located
on the bay with stunning views through
every window, takes you from the bot
tommost depths to the shores, with sea
animals showing off through the glass at
each exhibit.
A new exhibit which opened in
March and continues through 1997
spotlights a few creatures from farther
away. The "Deadly Beauties," mostly
tropical fish, flaunt their poison just
beyond reach, and graphic descriptions
explain just where the poison lies and
what it can do.
But most of the animals native to the

bay are safer, and the "touch pool" —
an aquarium's version of a petting farm
— lets you test your theories about the
relatively sliminess of starfish and bat
rays.
The kelp forests, the tops of which
are easily visible in the bay outside the
aquarium, are where the guided tour of
the area's depths begins. Massive
lengths of kelp wave peacefully in a two
story tank filled with communities of
sharks, anemones and sardines. On the
first floor, starfish cling to the window.
Climbing up to the second floor, a shark
might swim close by, and scaling the
next set of stairs lets you gaze down into
the habitats pool and visit with a few
waterfowl who favor the surface.
The aquarium's main tour begins
with an exhibit on "Octopus and Kin,"
their suckers clinging to the walls of the
tank. Fossils of the "kin," the chambered
nautilus, are on display.
The path takes a traveler through the
waters of the bay starting with the deep
reefs, where the brightest animals look,
grey from lack of sunlight.
Wolf eels and limpcods, who offer
only a few of the great names awarded
to ocean creatures, stare up from the

murky depths
like inventions
in a science fic
tion movie. Anemones so white they
glow sway gently while shrimp peek out
from crevices in the reef.
On the sea floor itself, the nearly
round flatfish blend in with speckled
rocks like extra-talented chameleons,
leaving a tank that looks empty except
for a few bright eyes. Sea pens stand ele
gantly, reminiscent of quill pens in 18th
Century paintings.
The shale reefs, formed by the glassy
skeletons of a thousand-foot thick layer
of diatoms, are covered now by a selec
tion of color that would make Crayola
proud. Orange and blue sponges and
pink algae cover the reef, while clams
slowly dig their way through, making
the progress in eight years that a drill
bit would make in a few minutes.
Worms, perch and crabs fill the
slough and sandy shore exhibits. When
finally you have emerged from the deep
sea, a chorus of birds in the aviary whis
tle a greeting. A miniature beach lets
you see what's on shore and just below
the surface of the waves all at once.
Despite the lengths of perfect beach,
