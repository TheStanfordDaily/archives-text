# 6 groups lose special fee; amendments pass easily
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Twenty-three student groups re
ceived their special fees while only six
lost them in this year's ASSU General
Spring Election.
In sharp contrast to last year's con
troversial special-fee election, students
this week not only overwhelmingly sup
ported special-fee reform, but they sup
ported the special-fee system in general.
The key 15 percent rule, which states
that a student group cannot receive a
special fee unless it receives the support
of 15 percent of the student population,
did play a role in election results.
However, the future effects of
the rule — which prevented four
groups which received a majority of
votes from receiving their fee in
this year's election — will most
likely be mollified by a special-fee
reform bill which overwhelmingly
passed the students.
The six groups that failed to
gain their requested fee are the
Stanford Axe Committee, Stanford
Cardinal Broadcasting Network
(SCBN), REDWOOD, Shooting
Star Traveling Children's Theater,
the Caribbean Students' Associa
tion and Stanford Hybrid Automo
bile Research Project (SHARP).
The rejection rate of special-fee

groups was much lower this year
than last. Twenty-nine student
groups requested special fees,
seven fewer than last year. Howev
er, last year 19 of the 36 groups
were denied by students.
In addition, last year 10 student
groups did not receive their fees
because they failed to garner the
support of 15 percent of students,
compared to four this year.
Last year's results launched the
current crop of student leaders into
a year-long campaign for special-fee
reform, which culminated in the
Common Sense Fee Reform amend
ment that was overwhelmingly
approved in this week's election.
The amendment, which won
307 more votes than its required
two-thirds majority, will give stu
dent groups three options to solicit
special fees. Instead of being con
strained to soliciting money from

all students, groups can now ask
only undergraduates, only gradu
ates or both for their special fee.
Proponents, including Jon
Oram, a member of the Council of
Presidents-elect, claim the amend
ment will enable student groups to
more easily win special-fee funds.
On the fee front, most major
groups which lost their special fees
last year won the fee this year.
Stanford-in-Government,
which lost last year, won 64.3 per
cent of the votes, delighting its
chair Susie Thomas.
"It ensures ... that we can con
tinue as an organization," she said.
"We couldn't really afford to make
it one year without funding. The
passage of the [Common Sense Fee
Reform] amendment will help
ensure funding of the groups for
future years."
MEChA, a Chicano / Latino stu

dent group, which failed to win a
majority last year, won 2,164 yea
votes — a 58.9 percent approval
rate. Four out of the five ethnic
organizations on the ballot won
their fees.
"We're going to have a lot more
time and a lot more energy to put
into these programs," said Mireya
Samaniego, co-chair of MEChA.
This year "we had to spend a
majority of our time collecting
money. We cut back on program
ming and activities. It's going to
give us more of a chance to concen
trate on our activities."
Stanford Axe Committee, which
received a majority negative votes
last year, got more yeas than nays
this year. However, the group fell
10 votes short of the 15 percent
minimum approval necessary to
gain a fee.
Chair Craig Zajac said this year's

loss all but eliminates the commit
tee as a strong student group.
"We used up all our reserves
over the last year," Zajac said.
"Now we're pretty much flat
broke. We have zero money left for
next year."
Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network, which has lost its fee for
almost a decade, again fell short
and failed to gain 15 percent sup
port by 50 votes.
"It's definitely a disappoint
ment," said spokesman Matthew
Kulikowski. "We're going to keep
going and continue what we're
doing. We have a lot of hope for
SCBN. It's unfortunate, but we're
not going to let that stop us.
There's more behind SCBN than
money. It's motivation. And we
have plenty of that."
The only two groups to receive a
majority of "no" votes this year

were the Caribbean Students'
Association and SHARP.
Of victorious groups, the Stan
ford Jazz Orchestra came the clos
est to losing by the 15 percent rule,
winning its fee by just seven votes.
However, the results for the jazz
orchestra, SCBN and Axe Commit
tee are still preliminary. ASSU
Election Commissioner Jonathan
Berent said 50 voters were not on
the Registrar's list of registered
students. Berent said final tallies
will be announced after he meets
with the registrar to clarify the
problem.
The Freedom of Information
Act, a constitutional amendment
which allows all students access to
ASSU documents, overwhelmingly
passed with 88.1 percent of the vote.
Solomon Lefier, Houman Hem
mati and Smeeta Ramarathnam
were elected to the Student Con-
