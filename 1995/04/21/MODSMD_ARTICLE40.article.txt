The roles in "Therapy" are

Andrew Lloyd Webber's
"Phantom of the Opera" pro

spectacle featuring beautiful
music and a convoluted love

and it appears "The Music of
the Night' may never end.
Conserving theater
San Francisco's American
Conservatory Theater, the
San Jose Civic Light Opera
and the annual "Best of
Broadway" series bring
numerous plays and musicals
to Bay Area stages each year.
Covering all of the bases from
serious theatre to musical com
edy, the two organizations

provide a veritable smorgas
bord of plays.
This year, ACT is looking
at the theater of the past; the
last two productions of
the season are "Othello"
and "Hecuba." William
Shakespeare's tragic explo
ration of the human mind and
sanity runs April 19 through
June 4 at the Stage Door
Iheater, 420 Mason Street.
"Hecuba" will be directed
by ACT Artistic Director
Carey Perloff (daughter of
English Prof. Maijorie Perloff)
and will feature Olympia
Dukakis in the title role of a
new translation of the Greek
drama. "Hecuba" plays at the
Center for the Arts Theater in
the Yerba Buena Gardens,
700 Howard Street from May
3 to June 4.
"Best of Broadway" has
already brought "Blood
Brothers," "Grease" and
"Fiddler on the Roof' to the
Bay Area this year and is con
tinuing its run with Carol
Channing in "Hello, Dolly!"
from May 3 to 28 at the
Orpheum Theatre. Channing
reprises the same title role for
which she won a Best Actress
Tony in the mid-19605, lead

ing to questions about the
character's age.
Located an hour south in
San Jose, the Civic Light
Opera is dedicated to musicals
and its last production of the
year is "A Chorus Line." Once
a long-running Broadway hit,
"Line" provides a light look
behind the scenes of a musi
cal; the show plays May 12 to
27 at the beautiful San Jose
Center for the Performing
Arts in downtown San Jose.
Local talents
In addition to the big power
houses of theater scene,
almost every community up
and down the bay has its own
community theater groups.
From tne well-known
Berkeley Repertory Theater
to the less ambitious Palo Alto
Player, the community com
panies provide inexpensive,
interesting evenings of enter
tainment that vary in quality
from play to play.
Over in the rival's blue and
yellow home base, Berkeley
Rep is producing Eugene
O'Neill's "A Moon for the
Misbegotten" through May 19
at 2025 Addison St., Berkeley.
A companion work to

O'Neill's autobiographical
"Long Day's Journey Into the
Night," "Moon" brings dys
functional relationships and
romances to the stage.
Closer to home, the Palo
Alto Players have two final
productions scheduled in
their 1994-95 season —
"Smoke On The Mountain"
and "Lend Me a Tenor" —
both playing at the Lucie
Stern Theater, 1305
Middlefield Road, Palo Alto.
The former (April 28 through
May 14) is billed as a "foot
stompin' celebration of
Americana"; the latter (June
16 through July 2) as "an
uproarious romp hitting all
the right notes."
In addition to this pair,
small theaters such as San
Jose's Northside Theatre
Company, Mountain View's
Theatreworks and San
Francisco's Common Cultural
Practice and Asian American
Theater Company are always
putting on both original works
and revivals of old favorites.
Ultimately, this small smat
tering of the Bay Area's the
ater offerings represents only
the tip of the proverbial ice
berg.

Center for the Performing
Arts in downtown San Jose.
Local talents
In addition to the big power
houses of theater scene,
almost every community up
and down the bay has its own
community theater groups.
From tne well-known
Berkeley Repertory Theater
to the less ambitious Palo Alto
Player, the community com
panies provide inexpensive,
interesting evenings of enter
tainment that vary in quality
from play to play.
Over in the rival's blue and
yellow home base, Berkeley
Rep is producing Eugene
O'Neill's "A Moon for the
Misbegotten" through May 19
at 2025 Addison St., Berkeley.
A companion work to

O'Neill's autobiographical
"Long Day's Journey Into the
Night," "Moon" brings dys
functional relationships and
romances to the stage.
Closer to home, the Palo
Alto Players have two final
productions scheduled in
their 1994-95 season —
"Smoke On The Mountain"
and "Lend Me a Tenor" —
both playing at the Lucie
Stern Theater, 1305
Middlefield Road, Palo Alto.
The former (April 28 through
May 14) is billed as a "foot
stompin' celebration of
Americana"; the latter (June
16 through July 2) as "an
uproarious romp hitting all
the right notes."
In addition to this pair,
small theaters such as San
Jose's Northside Theatre
Company, Mountain View's
Theatreworks and San
Francisco's Common Cultural
Practice and Asian American
Theater Company are always
putting on both original works
and revivals of old favorites.
Ultimately, this small smat
tering of the Bay Area's the
ater offerings represents only
the tip of the proverbial ice
berg.
