# Explore the coast
## Point Reyes lights the path 
### Sarah Katz. Photo by Frank Guinan 
Just two hours north of
campus is what may be the
windiest, foggiest point on
the Pacific ('.oast, if not in
the country.
It is also a place where
you can hike miles of trails,
relax on sandy beaches, set
whales, deer, birds and
other wildlife, tour a light
house that is more than 100
years old and visit a real,
live oyster farm.
Located on the coast
right up the highway in
Marin County, Point Reyes
National Seashore is a
recreationist's dream, per
fect for an afternoon trip or
several days of camping.
Local legend has it that
Sir Francis Drake and his
crew from the Golden Hind
landed at Point Reyes in
June of 1579 to rest and
make repairs, naming the
area Nova Albion, or New
England. I'his story vies
with others which place the
British explorer in San
Francisco Bay or Santa
Barbara, but believers of the
Point Reyes theory have
given Drake ample recogni
tion, naming a highwax. r>a\
and several restaurants for
the explorer.
After stopping at the
Beat Valley Visitor Center, a
good way to begin a visit to
the park is by driving down
to the famous Point Reyes
Lighthouse. Built in 1870
and managed bv the U.S.
Coast Guard suae 1939, the
little red-and-white beacon
is perched low on a cliff so
that its beam will shine

under the ceiling of the
high coastal fogs that iegu
larly swirl around the point.
I he lighthouse is situat
ed in what is reportedly one
of the windiest places in the
world. I he station there
once recorded a gust of I'l3
mph, a record for this coast.
From Thursday through
Monday, weather permit
ting. you can climb down
the 300-plus steps to the
lighthouse and examine the
equipment on display. (Just
remember you have to
come back up all those
stairs! Fortunately, there are
plenty of benches along the
way.) Though the light
house has been automated
since 1975, there is a small
area where the keepers and
their families used to live
and an exhibition on light
house management.
The lighthouse observa
tion platform is also one of
the best places in the park to
see grey whales, which pass
the point migrating south
from December to February
and north from March to
early May. Sightings are
fairly common: on the after
noon we were there, a moth
er and her calf swam past
the point.
Near the lighthouse,
there are seveial long,
sandy beaches, great for
walking or relaxing if the
sun is out. I he only prob
lem is that you can't swim;
high winds, heavy surl,
undertow and rip currents
make Point Reyes Beaches
North and South too haz
ardous even for wading.
On the other .side of the
point, however, is Drake's

Beach. I his beach is quiet
because it is protected from
ha/ards b\ c lilts — which
tourists are advised to stav
away from due to incoming
titles — making it «i good
hangout lor people trying
to learn how to surf,
although there is no life
guard on duty Drake's
beach (lafe oilers ;i mix of
food for hungry beach
goers: everything Irotn
greasy french fries and
grilled cheese sandwiches to
homemade oyster stew.
If you're still in the mood
fot shellfish aftet a lunch at
the cafe, you can stop at
Johnson's Oyster Farm on
your way bat k up to town.
The little stove sells — what
else? — oysters and othei
fishy amenities, but an
interesting note is the huge
piles of shells that line, and
pave, the road.
1 hough the headlands
ate more than miles
from the visitors center,
they are only a small por
tion of the park. Only a few
roads travel the length of
the area; the majority of the
park is accessible only by
hiking trails, great for
longterm camping or short
walks.
To the northwest, a road
takes you out to the I ItStorie
fierce Point Ranch and the
I ule Klk Reserve, where you
can hike for miles along the
Tomales Point Trail.
I o the southeast, you can
follow a number of trails
down to. the Point Reyes
Bird Observatory, the first
■ of its kind to Ik; established
in the U.S. in 1%3. I he
observatory is a working

reseat < h fat ilit\ but is also
open to the public. For
those not up to the long
walk, the observatory can
iilso be l eached by car ofl of
Highway 1.
Foi shorter walks, you
tan take a number of paths
out of the Wear Valley
Visitoi (Center. A ().(> mile
walk takes you along the
looping Karlhquake Frail,
which follows along the frac
ture /one of the San
Andreas Fault where the
ground moved lb feet in
the 1906 San Francisco
quake, 1 here are frequently
ranger-guided programs on
weekends.
A half-mile walk in the
other direction takes you to
Kule Loklo, a recreated
Coast Miwok Indian village
of wooden lints. One of the
buildings is used for prayer
and other spiritual cere
monies, and two festivals
are scheduled in the village
each year.
Finally, for those who
like nature but love civiliza
tion even more, there are a
couple of small towns locat
ed within the park which
are host to restaurants, gro
cery stores and even the
occasional motel or two.
Fhe Grey Whale restaurant,
for example, located in the
town of Inverness, offers
reasonably priced pizza and
great homemade desserts.
