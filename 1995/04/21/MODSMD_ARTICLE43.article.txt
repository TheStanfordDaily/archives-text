TH€ SHORC BIRD
I lie Slkiie Bird i esi.nirant
is known as the Cape ( od ol

the California coast, lioth its
building and attitude toward
food suit this reputation well.
1 he ambiance is created
by the architectural layout,
which allows foi every table
to have a window view of the
seashore, l'he wood that lines
the floors, walls and ceilings
was taken from old California
railways. While some ina\
find this antique flavor gives
the restaurant a rough edge,
I felt it added deep charm.
l'he menu at the Shore
Bird offers selections from
many local catches, often list
ing the name ol the boat the
seafood was caught on next
to the entree. But the charm
does not end there. Aside
from the two lire places and
outdoor (1111i111> facilities, each

woman who dines here
receives a long stem red rose.
(ientlemen, take note.
Brunch is also a line idea.
Prices drop for delights such
as crab cakes Benedict and
cinnamon-apple I- rem Ii
toast. I lie latt ei which is
actually homemade bread
pudding dipped in bourbon
batter and grilled. Served
with maple syrup it is per
haps the lii st original varia
tion on French toast.
Seafood specialties include
Hawaiian mahi-mahi with
fiery mango gla/e and
seafood ravioli. I he ravioli,
handmade and stuffed with
Dungeness c rab, shrimp, seal
lops and salmon in a rich
bath of tomato-basic cream is
a winner. I lie mahi-mahi was

also wonderful, thick and ten
der with a sweet and savor\
sauce.
I he Shore Bird is in
Princeton-bv-t he-Sea, a sinali
roadside community that
offers beaches to comb, trail
shops to visit and a quiet not
found neat San Francisco.

(look's is primarily out

Dungeness crab salad or
"Crab Louie" (mostly lettuce
with a spare hit of crustacean
on top and a Russian dress
ing).
(look's lacks elegance and
subtlety. (Despite the politi
cally correct recycling bins in
the restaurant for tans and

for last, cheap, filling food, it
serves its purpose quite well.

CHGf CHU'S
A bit wary of eating noth

consecutive days, we decided
to traverse cross-cultural
boundaries for something
Stanford students rarely eat
Chinese food.' People rave
about ( hel (lltu's, but it is

rarely considered a "seafood"
restaurant. About one-fifth ol
the lengthy menu, however,
consists of sin h dishes as
prawns, lobster, scallops and
s(|iiid.
While dishes such as kung
I'ao prawns and squid as well
as ( lief Chit's special prawns
attracted us, we decided on
prawns in lobster sauce and
dry braised lobster. Our
choices weren't disappoint
ing. 1 he first dish is pre
pared with marinated shrimp
stir-fried in black bean-garlic
sauce and blended with
whipped eggs into a special
lobster sauce. I he second
deceptive!) descriptive dish is
shelled lobster tail braised
with garlic, ginger, chile

paste and tomato sauce. I In
former was more flavorful,
while the lobster lacked the
aggressiveb spi( \ charm the
name implied.

scorn
I lie appearance of Scott's
is unobtrusive (somewhat
akin to a candlelit-converted
barn), and the food is di\ine.
I ables are located tastclulh
so that each retains a piivate
and intimate feel, with long
rows of windows (though the
view consisted of parked c ai s)
close jiy.
What makes Scott's
unique, more than the pleas
ant ambiance, is tlu- food.
Creativity pla\s an important
role in preparation here: von
don't simply order a fish, vou
order a dish.
Our choices varied in com
plexity, but all were exquisite.
Made with peppei jack
( heese, scallions and crab,
the Dungeness crab quesadil

la is large enough lor two and
is served with guacamole,
salsa-cruda and sour c ream.
A good start to <1 great meal.
We also tried the jumbo
prawns stuffed with shiitake
mushrooms. Wrapped like .in
egg roll in 11 isj> wanton and
served with vegetables and a
citrus pon/u, these creatures
were stuffed with shiitake
mushrooms and crab. I'hev
had a deliriously unic|ue fla

THG MM MARKET
We started with I lit- Fish
Market, that Palo Alto main
stay that all students and
their parents seems to have
been to. Despite its lack of
flail in food and decor, I he
fish Market delivered <|iiali
ty, freshness and simplicit\.
Rather than offering exot
ic . culinary prepaiations. this
restaurant takes the c|u.intit\
approach — offering even
variety of fish under the sea.
From Hawaiian opakapaka to

New Zealand John l)oiy, the
names on the menu stimulate
when the food doesn't. Ihe
menu c hanges daily and there
are approximately thirty dif
ferent kinds ol fish available.
Reeling in choice seafood
is no small feat, and The 112 ish
Market does it en masse. 1 hey
have their own fishery, boats
and oyster farm.
I he most gourmet the
fish Market gets is somewhat
spic \ ( ajun-stvle fish. What
you get here is fish. It's really,
really good fish that's cooked
we 11, but one yvould not tip
the waiter to get the recipe.
This is a good place to
take your parents or other
folks suspicious of "that fussy,
fancy, avoc ado-rep let e
(California c uisine."

SAM'S
Sam's is probably a tourist
trap, hut I wouldn't kmm
because 1 only ate there once
and intend never to go hack.
I he best thing about the

(afe/restaurant was its phe
nomenal view of the San
Francisco skyline. I lie food
certainly was not worth the
long drive; ii was overpriced
and bland.
I he experience was aes
thetic a!lv pleasing, with lhe
panorama, tablecloths and
candlelight, but at .1 restau
rant where the average
entree is $12. I expected
more ol the food.
I he entrees were probahK
the scariest part ol 1 lie meal.
Mv grilled tuna burger was
awful. I was expecting a tuna
steak tvpe ol thing, .is the
menu said "Iresh line caught
tuna," but what I received

tasted like tuna-spam.
Sam's is dk.is for .1 relax
ill dinner, but don'i expet l

The Mac Arthur Park,
building is actually a histori
cal landmark, originally a

training at Camp Fremont
during World War I. Now,
the facility has great charac
ter, its large central area

divided off into dining sec

The salmon's

with a grilled shrimp,

ner is the pear and

For dinner, Mac Arthur's
features a whole fried ginger

coleslaw, cilantro rice and

fish in tomato-saffron broth
and Maryland crab cakes, as
