Seafood. contrary to every
da\ association, does not
have to taste like something
out ol a bad joke.

TH€ SHORC BIRD
I lie Slkiie Bird i esi.nirant
is known as the Cape ( od ol

the California coast, lioth its
building and attitude toward
food suit this reputation well.
1 he ambiance is created
by the architectural layout,
which allows foi every table
to have a window view of the
seashore, l'he wood that lines
the floors, walls and ceilings
was taken from old California
railways. While some ina\
find this antique flavor gives
the restaurant a rough edge,
I felt it added deep charm.
l'he menu at the Shore
Bird offers selections from
many local catches, often list
ing the name ol the boat the
seafood was caught on next
to the entree. But the charm
does not end there. Aside
from the two lire places and
outdoor (1111i111> facilities, each

woman who dines here
receives a long stem red rose.
(ientlemen, take note.
Brunch is also a line idea.
Prices drop for delights such
as crab cakes Benedict and
cinnamon-apple I- rem Ii
toast. I lie latt ei which is
actually homemade bread
pudding dipped in bourbon
batter and grilled. Served
with maple syrup it is per
haps the lii st original varia
tion on French toast.
Seafood specialties include
Hawaiian mahi-mahi with
fiery mango gla/e and
seafood ravioli. I he ravioli,
handmade and stuffed with
Dungeness c rab, shrimp, seal
lops and salmon in a rich
bath of tomato-basic cream is
a winner. I lie mahi-mahi was

also wonderful, thick and ten
der with a sweet and savor\
sauce.
I he Shore Bird is in
Princeton-bv-t he-Sea, a sinali
roadside community that
offers beaches to comb, trail
shops to visit and a quiet not
found neat San Francisco.
