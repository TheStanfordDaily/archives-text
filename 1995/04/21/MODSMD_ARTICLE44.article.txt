The typical American girl between
ages three and 10 owns eight
Barbie dolls.
Mountain View resident Kvelyn
Burkhalter, however, lias a lew mine
Barbies than the average girl — about
20,000 more.
Burkhalter is the founder ol the
Barbie Doll Hall ol Fame in downtown
Palo Alto, an I 1-year-old studio that
houses tens ol thousands ol different
dolls ranging from the original Barbie
issued in March 1950 to the newest
"Baywatch" Barbie and Ken dolls.
Burkhalter's Hall ol Fame contains a
io|)v of every Barbie doll ever issued In
Mattel, except for a single piece from
1072 — Barbie's little black poodle.
"Some private collectors ma\ have
more, but ibis is the largest collection
open to the general public," Burkhalter
said.
Visitors to the Hall ol Fame see
Barbie as a hippie, an astronaut, a doc
tor, an aerobics instructor, a Pi//a Hut
worker and even as President ol the
United States. Since Barbie First debuted
.If> years ago, the I 1 '/2-inch doll has had
over 300 professional makeovers.
Visitors also see Barbies who walk,
talk and even wink, or thev can check
out Barbie's designer garb, including
outfits from Oscar de la Renta and
(christian Dior.
Younger visitors exclaim over the
new Disney Barbie dolls, including
Cinderella, Peter Pan and Beaut\ and
the Beast, while older people on tour
reminisce about the earlier dolls based
on classic 1 lollvwood movies like "Pastel
Parade" and "Roman Holiday."
In addition to the dolls, visitors see a
wide array ol Barbie accessories, includ
ing a bathroom set, a hot pink convert
ible and a swimming pool complete with
a water slide.
Burkhalter attributed Barbie's popu

larity to hei flexibilit\ and willingness to
adapt to the latest fads and fashions.
"Barbie has been so popular because
she lias followed perlectlv everything we
do, eveivthing the average household
does. She mimics modern society,"
Burkhalter said.
When |ac(|ueliue Kennedy was first
Lady, Barbie followed hei example of
hair stvles and dress. When tlu- profes
sional working woman emerged in the
'80s, Barbie turned into the yuppie
"Day-to-Night doll, whose conservative
daytime business suit was reversible to a
wilder evening g<>wn.
Sold in more than 1 10 countries
around the world, Barbie is
bought at the- worldwide rate ol
two dolls per second. World sales figures
last year were in excess of SI billion.
An original, mint condition Barbie
doll is valued at close to $."i,OOO. accord
ing to collectors. Ihe same doll was
retailed for $.'} in 1050.

Although Burkhaltet has always
been interested in old dolls, she
said she lirst got into Barbies
when she and hei husband
opened a school lot deaf children
in Palo Alto. As part of the
school's lundraising efforts.

Burkhalter bought Barbies, sewed *
costumes for them and rallied them
off.
Her interest in Barbies grew so much
that in IOS F she opened the ball ol
fame, in honor of Barbie's 25th anniver
sary. Burkhalter's original collection
onlv included about 1,000 dolls.
But in the I I years the I l.ill ol Fame
lias been open. Burkhalter s collection
has grown in leaps and bounds, often to
the sin ni ise ol v isitoi s.

hack to l lie studio, i I

seemed like every time we had added a
new dis|)la\ case," Hurkhaltei s.iid.
