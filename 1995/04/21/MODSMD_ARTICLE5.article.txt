# Stanford students join fast
## 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
At midnight on Tuesday, eight
Asian-American students started a
fast in White Plaza to support an
ongoing hunger strike at North
western University.
Late last night, they had not yet
decided whether to continue the
fast.
The hunger-striking North
western students are demanding
an Asian-American Studies pro
gram and have been fasting for nine
days. Although 17 students origi
nally participated in the hunger
strike in support of Asian-Ameri
can Studies, only one is still fasting.

"Only by student action will uni
versities acknowledge student de
mands, not to mention act upon
them," said Davina Chen, a Stan
ford doctoral student who was par
ticipating in the fast.
"We want people to know that
the struggle for an Asian- American
Studies program is not only going
on at Stanford but is a nationwide
effort," she added.
The fasters, a group of both un
dergraduate and graduate stu
dents, have put up two blue tents in
the middle of White Plaza. In addi
tion, they are informing students
walking by about the situation at
Northwestern.

Interested students are encour
aged to sign a support petition for
the Northwestern students' de
mands.
"A lot of students have stopped
and talked; 180 signers is a pretty
good result for a morning," Chen
said.
Asian-American students have
long demanded a Stanford program
that addresses their experiences
and culture. Following last spring's
hunger strike for a Chicano Studies
program, committees were set up to
investigate how to best implement
Chicano and Asian-American Stud
