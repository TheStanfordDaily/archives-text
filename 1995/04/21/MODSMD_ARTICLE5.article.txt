# Stanford students join fast

### Marie Rosencrantz 
At midnight on Tuesday, eight
Asian-American students started a
fast in White Plaza to support an
ongoing hunger strike at North
western University.
Late last night, they had not yet
decided whether to continue the
fast.
The hunger-striking North
western students are demanding
an Asian-American Studies pro
gram and have been fasting for nine
days. Although 17 students origi
nally participated in the hunger
strike in support of Asian-Ameri
can Studies, only one is still fasting.

"Only by student action will uni
versities acknowledge student de
mands, not to mention act upon
them," said Davina Chen, a Stan
ford doctoral student who was par
ticipating in the fast.
"We want people to know that
the struggle for an Asian- American
Studies program is not only going
on at Stanford but is a nationwide
effort," she added.
The fasters, a group of both un
dergraduate and graduate stu
dents, have put up two blue tents in
the middle of White Plaza. In addi
tion, they are informing students
walking by about the situation at
Northwestern.

Interested students are encour
aged to sign a support petition for
the Northwestern students' de
mands.
"A lot of students have stopped
and talked; 180 signers is a pretty
good result for a morning," Chen
said.
Asian-American students have
long demanded a Stanford program
that addresses their experiences
and culture. Following last spring's
hunger strike for a Chicano Studies
program, committees were set up to
investigate how to best implement

ies programs at Stanford.
Students from a variety of eth
nic groups, faculty members and
deans met at a forum Wednesday
night to discuss the proposed
interdisciplinary program on
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, which aims to include
Asian-American and Chicano
Studies as well as the already
established African and Afro-
American Studies program.
The fasting group, which calls
itself "Concerned Students for
Asian American Studies at Stan
ford University," stressed that
they do not want to make any
demands of their own, but that
they are solely acting in stikers
support of the at Northwestern.
Junior Charles Chung, the only
student at Northwestern who is
still fasting, said he "really appreci
ates the support of the students at
Stanford."
"That's one of the things that's
keeping me going — knowing that
there are students across the coun
try who are supporting us in our

efforts," Chung said.
While the hunger-strikers at
Northwestern are reportedly
becoming weaker, the Stanford
fasters are not yet suffering.
"All I can think about when I
notice how hungry I feel now is
how it must have been like to have
been fasting for nine days," Chen
said. "We are not trying to kill our
selves," she added.
The director of Cowell Student
Health Center stopped by White
Plaza yesterday to ensure that
the members of the fasting group
know how to take care of them
selves. The fasters are drinking
fruit juices and eating vitamins.
The hunger strikers at North
western are planning to fast until
their demands are met. According
to their Stanford supporters,
Northwestern administrators
have completely ignored the cam
pus strike, disregarding both its
purpose and its effect on the
fasters.
Seventeen students at Prince
ton University also started a
protest yesterday to push for
their demands for both Asian-
American and Chicano Studies
programs.
