## Hate crime bill fails in House committee 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
A bill that would have expanded
the legal definition of a hate crime
failed to pass earlier this week in the
California Assembly's Committee
on Public Safety.
The bill, which was introduced by
Assemblyman Byron Sher, D-Stan
ford, was intended to broaden the ex
isting statute to include actions
against property owned by entities
such as Stanford and actions direct
ed at groups as well as individuals,
according to Christopher Carlisle,
legislative assistant to Sher.
Such legislation would establish
grounds for prosecuting perpetra

tors of crimes such as last May's
vandalism of Stanford's "Gay Lib
eration" sculpture.
Six out of a committee of eight
voted on the bill, Carlisle said. The
resulting straight party-line vote
fell two short of the mtyority needed
to pass the legislation.
Though disappointed by the
bill's defeat, Carlisle said that hate
crime "is not a dead issue," refer
ring to the recent passage of a simi
lar bill in the state's Senate Com
mittee on Criminal Procedure.
Its 7-0 victory on April 4 af
firmed the support for Senate Bill
911, which is more "strictly drawn"
