## Hate crime bill fails in House committee 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
A bill that would have expanded
the legal definition of a hate crime
failed to pass earlier this week in the
California Assembly's Committee
on Public Safety.
The bill, which was introduced by
Assemblyman Byron Sher, D-Stan
ford, was intended to broaden the ex
isting statute to include actions
against property owned by entities
such as Stanford and actions direct
ed at groups as well as individuals,
according to Christopher Carlisle,
legislative assistant to Sher.
Such legislation would establish
grounds for prosecuting perpetra

tors of crimes such as last May's
vandalism of Stanford's "Gay Lib
eration" sculpture.
Six out of a committee of eight
voted on the bill, Carlisle said. The
resulting straight party-line vote
fell two short of the mtyority needed
to pass the legislation.
Though disappointed by the
bill's defeat, Carlisle said that hate
crime "is not a dead issue," refer
ring to the recent passage of a simi
lar bill in the state's Senate Com
mittee on Criminal Procedure.
Its 7-0 victory on April 4 af
firmed the support for Senate Bill
911, which is more "strictly drawn"
than the Assembly's version,
according to Mike Bosia — princi
pal consultant for the Senate
Subcommittee on Hate Crime
who works closely with the
author of the bill, Senator Milton
Marks, D-San Francisco / North
Bay.
Bosia said SB9II would broaden
the scope of the current hate crime

law by adding to the list of prose
cutable crimes the category of vio
lence directed toward private or
public institutions.
The bill would also add three
probation requirements — anti
violence counseling, victim restitu
tion and community service — to
the ethnic sensitivity training cur
rently required of criminals whose
actions are judged to be motivated
by bigotry.
A third component of the legis
lation would be a $50,000 reward
issued by the governor to anyone

giving information leading to the
apprehension or conviction of per
petrators of hate violence, Bosia
added.
The next stage of legislation for
SB9II, forecast for mid-May,
requires approved fiscal examina
tion by the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
If approved by Appropriations,
the bill would continue to the State
Senate in late May, and then on to
the State Assembly some time
between June and August of this
year.
