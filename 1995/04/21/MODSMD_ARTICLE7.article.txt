# Faculty members weigh benefits of science core

Faculty members were enthusiastic but held
back full support for a proposed new science core
after a committee presented its recommendation
at faculty meetings held Tuesday and Wednes
day.
The meetings were "pretty positive," said
Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood, chair of the
Mathematics-Engineering-Science Core Com
mittee which issued the recommendation. "Peo
ple came away pretty encouraged and enthusias
tic."
The committee held the two closed meetings,
which each drew about 25 people, to encourage
science, engineering and mathematics faculty
members to submit proposals for tracks in the
science core. The Commission on Undergradu
ate Education recommended a three-quarter sci
ence core for non-scientists in its October report.

Now that its recommendation is complete,
Osgood said his committee wants to "serve as a
matchmaker" for faculty members interested in
working together to design tracks.
"We want it to be multidisciplinary," Osgood
said, adding that coordination may be a problem.
"People should be able to bring their own dis
ciplinary interests to a track," he said. "They all
should have common elements, but they can be
covered in different ways. That's a way to en
courage different faculty in different depart
ments to get involved."
Overall, Osgood said, "people were really in
terested in what a [track] like this could be at its
best.... I don't think there was anybody who
thought we shouldn't be doing something like
this."
But Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts said
he isn't sure that there is a problem with the cur
rent system of science requirements.
Roberts said he disagrees with the com mi s

sion's report, which claims that students who
aren't science majors take classes that would not
count toward a science degree in order to fulfill
the science distribution requirements.
In fact, Roberts said, according to a survey
taken of 1,000 students who graduated last
June, more than 70 percent took classes required
for technical majors to fulfill those three DRs.
Between 53 and 66 percent of the students in the
sample were not majoring in the sciences, he
said.
Another major concern is that the plan might
cause problems for students who take the full
year science core and then decide to major in a
science, said Chair of the Mathematics Depart
ment Ralph Cohen.
Because the basic overview of science, tech
nology and math presented in the core wouldn't
count toward the major, students might have
