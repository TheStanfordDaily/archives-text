Capping off a tremendous postseason run, the Stan
ford men's gymnastics squad captured its third national
title in four years on Friday night at the NCAA champi
onships in Columbus, Ohio.
Underrated at No. 14 in the polls, the Cardinal demon
strated an ability to compete with the best, turning in a
near-flawless performance to post a season-high 232.4
and easily outdistance defending national champion Ne
braska and Penn State in the team championships on Fri
day night. The crown completes Stanford's postseason
sweep, which includes both the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and NCAA Western Region titles.
"We were awesome," said head coach Sadao Hamada.
"Everything went the way I wanted it to, all the details,

The finish was good enough to advance both schools to
the team championships on Friday along with Penn
State; host-school Ohio State, Oklahoma and lowa were
eliminated.
"We were mainly concerned with advancing on Thurs

worry about beating everyone."
In Friday's competition, Stanford leapt out to a lead
after the first event — the pommel horse — and ran away
with the title from there. The team never looked back, es
tablishing season highs on the first three events and pro
ducing strong efforts in the rest.
"We established a lead and I felt really comfortable,"
Hamada said. "I was just concerned with letting it get
away from us."
The coach had little to worry about as far as the ad
vantage fostering overconfidence in his team.
"I don't think any of us had any idea," said senior spe
cialist Evan Wells. "We just knew that we had to go out
and hit our sets. All we could do was keep our minds on
our sets and concentrate on hitting our routines."
With the Cardinal gymnasts so focused, Stanford's op
position was simply unable to compete. Penn State
knocked itself out of contention with early inconsistency.
