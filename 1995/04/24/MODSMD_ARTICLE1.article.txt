# Gymnasts vault to win national title
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Capping off a tremendous postseason run, the Stan
ford men's gymnastics squad captured its third national
title in four years on Friday night at the NCAA champi
onships in Columbus, Ohio.
Underrated at No. 14 in the polls, the Cardinal demon
strated an ability to compete with the best, turning in a
near-flawless performance to post a season-high 232.4
and easily outdistance defending national champion Ne
braska and Penn State in the team championships on Fri
day night. The crown completes Stanford's postseason
sweep, which includes both the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and NCAA Western Region titles.
"We were awesome," said head coach Sadao Hamada.
"Everything went the way I wanted it to, all the details,
everything.
"It was definitely a total team effort and everyone had
a crucial contribution to the effort."
The quest started on Thursday night, when the squad
competed in the preliminaries and amassed a then sea
son-high 230.1 points, placing second to Nebraska by 0.4.
The finish was good enough to advance both schools to
the team championships on Friday along with Penn
State; host-school Ohio State, Oklahoma and lowa were
eliminated.
"We were mainly concerned with advancing on Thurs
day," Hamada said. "It didn't really matter to us whether
we finished first, second or third. I just wanted to be con
sistent enough to make the championships and only then
worry about beating everyone."
In Friday's competition, Stanford leapt out to a lead
after the first event — the pommel horse — and ran away
with the title from there. The team never looked back, es
tablishing season highs on the first three events and pro
ducing strong efforts in the rest.
"We established a lead and I felt really comfortable,"
Hamada said. "I was just concerned with letting it get
away from us."
The coach had little to worry about as far as the ad
vantage fostering overconfidence in his team.
"I don't think any of us had any idea," said senior spe
cialist Evan Wells. "We just knew that we had to go out
and hit our sets. All we could do was keep our minds on
our sets and concentrate on hitting our routines."
With the Cardinal gymnasts so focused, Stanford's op
position was simply unable to compete. Penn State
knocked itself out of contention with early inconsistency.
While Nebraska produced a strong effort with a score of
231.525, the Cornhuskers
could not match a Stanford
team that was hitting on all
cylinders.
"We knew that all we had to
do was execute on Friday,"
Hamada said. "I have prepared
this team to be superior to any
one else physically, fundamen
tally, and in skills selection and
difficulty. Simple mathematics
should show that all we had to
do was match their percentage
of hits."
On Thursday, this point was
fully demonstrated as Nebras
ka put together a nearly perfect
program, producing only two
misses vs. Stanford's 10. How
ever, it may just have been the
Huskers' success in the prelim
inaries that may have ultimate
ly led to their downfall.
"Nebraska pretty much did
their best on Thursday," said
sophomore national team mem
ber Keith Wiley. "They hardly
missed anything and so there
wasn't any room for improve
ment.
"Sadao really prepared us for
this type of two-day event. We
always practiced it as if it were
in the format of the NCAAs and
worked to a point where we
could expect to improve on the
second day."
The national title wasn't the
only honor the Cardinal
brought back to the Farm. Indi
vidually, the gymnasts were
showered with accolades as all
five members of the team who
qualified for the event finals
were awarded All-American
status by finishing in the top
six.
The honorees were led by
sophomore specialist lan
Bachrach, who had a stellar
performance en route to win
ning the vault, and senior Josh
Stein, who finished second on
the floor exercise and fourth on
the pommel horse and the still
rings. Among the other three
Cardinal gymnasts to place
highly were Wiley, who finished
sixth on the vault, junior
Andrew Manson, who battled
back from a knee injury earlier
in the season to take fifth on
the rings and sophomore
national team member Jamie
Ellis, who tied for fourth on the
parallel bars.
"The individual awards were
definitely icing on the cake,"
Bachrach said. "Everything we

had went into Friday's competi
tion, so we really weren't con
cerned with how things turned
out on Saturday."
Based on his strong showing,
Stein earned the Nissen Award,
which is annually given to the
top collegiate gymnast in the
nation. The prize was delivered
to the co-captain and national
team member by two-time
Heisman Trophy running back
Archie Griffin, who starred at
Ohio State. Stein is the first
Stanford gymnast to receive
the award since Steve Hug did
in 1978.
"It's obviously quite an
honor for Josh," Wells said.
"Tim IRyanJ and Jair [Lynch]
were great athletes and they
never won it. Even when Jair
went to the Olympics, he didn't
get the award."
Despite all the individual tal
ent displayed by the team, it
was clearly a team effort that
earned them the title more
than anything else.
"This meet is very different
than other years simply
because we are so much a
team," Wiley said. "In the past
we've depended on certain guys
more, but this year, everybody
contributed."
Like a true teammate,
Bachrach backed up Wiley's
assertion with his own.
"It's like Josh said in our cel
ebration afterwards, 'We have
no big guns here.' We really
don't have a guy like Jair that
we need to carry us. We all have
to hit everything if we want to
win."
Each gymnast will take a dif
ferent experience from this sea
son. For the seniors, the senti
ment is clearly one of nostalgia.
Stein, Wells and co-captain
Jason Cohen have all won three
titles, but there is always some
thing special about the last one.
"It was a great way to leave
Stanford," Wells said. "It was
the greatest possible way that it
could have ended."
For the sophomores, the
feeling was more one of
redemption. "After last year's
loss, none of us really knew
what it was like to win a team
championship," Wiley said.
"There was definitely some
thing lacking, a void that need
ed to be filled."
And yet across the divide <>112
years, the team remains unified
in perhaps the simplest reac
tion of all. "It was amazing,"
Bachrach said. "Absolutely
amazing."
