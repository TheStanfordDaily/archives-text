## FBI looks for 2nd bomber 
### 
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - An
Army deserter was questioned yes
terday in the bombing of the feder
al building, as the nation
expressed its grief for the lost chil
dren and other dead with the
tolling of church bells and tearful
moments of silence.
As the investigation widened,
some 20,000 people overflowed the
state fairgrounds, where President
Clinton and the Rev. Billy Graham
joined in a memorial service on
what the president declared a
national day of mourning.
"Today, our nation joins with
you in grief," Clinton said. "We
mourn with you. We share your
hope against hope that some may
still survive." And he promised
every effort "to bring to justice
those who did this evil."
The death toll in the worst ter
rorist bombing in U.S. history
stood at 78, with 150 people unac
counted for. More than 400 were
injured in Wednesday's blast,
caused by thousands of pounds of
homemade explosives packed into

a Ryder rental truck.
A 37-year-old nurse, Rebecca
Anderson, died yesterday of head
injuries she suffered in a fall while
helping after the bombing.
David Iniguez, 23, was picked
up by military authorities in San
Bernardino, Calif., on charges
unrelated to the attack and was
questioned in connection with the
bombing, Justice Department
spokesman John Russell said.
Iniguez went AWOL from Fort
Riley, Kan., on Aug. 23, and was
declared a deserter a month later,
said Air Force Lt. Col. Joan Fergu
son, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
She said Iniguez was awaiting
court-martial for possession and
distribution of marijuana when he
deserted.
On Friday, the FBI arrested a
man it said was the first of the two
"John Does" suspects pictured in
FBI sketches: Timothy McVeigh, a
27-year-old former GI with far
right political views. He was
charged with taking part in the
bombing.

A senior law enforcement offi
cial, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said someone had rec
ognized Iniguez from the "John
Doe 2" sketch of a dark-haired,
square-jawed man with a heavy
brow. But Russell said Iniguez was
not "John Doe 2" and was not a
suspect.
McVeigh, like Iniguez, served at
Fort Riley, as did Terry Nichols,
one of two brothers being held as
material witnesses in the attack.
The FBI said McVeigh had been
infuriated at the government over
the cult disaster at Waco, Texas,
which occurred exactly two years
before the bombing.
McVeigh, who turned 27 yester
day, was being held in the El Reno
Federal Correctional Center on a
bombing charge. Other charges
were expected to follow. The gov
ernment has said it will seek the
death penalty.
Brothers Terry Lynn Nichols,
40, and James Douglas Nichols,
41, were ordered held as material
witnesses.
