Zulu leader urges resistance
UMLAZI, South Africa (AP) - Zulu
nationalist Mangosuthu Buthelezi yester
day urged his followers to "rise and resist"
Nelson Mandela's government, which he
painted as the enemy of Zulu sovereignty

and tradition.
Buthelezi's speech to about 5,000 peo
ple in a soccer stadium near Durban could
unleash a new wave of hostility between
his Inkatha Freedom Party and Mandela's
African National Congress. Thousands of
people have died in fighting between Zulu

supporters of the ANC and those support
ing Inkatha in the eastern province of
KwaZulu-Natal.
"We must resist the central govern
ment, which has given a clear indication of
pursuing plans from which great evil will
arise," Buthelezi said.

Buthelezi expressed fears that a strong
central government would strip provinces
of their power and sideline traditional
leaders, such as the Zulu king.
Inkatha wants international mediation
to settle demands for more autonomy for
KwaZulu-Natal, Buthelezi's stronghold

and home to most of the 8 million Zulus
who make up South Africa's largest ethnic
group.
On Saturday, Inkatha confirmed its
decision to boycott the assembly writing
South Africa's new constitution until
international mediation begins.
