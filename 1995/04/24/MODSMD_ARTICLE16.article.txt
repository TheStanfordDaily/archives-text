After 25 years of Earth
Days, there is still much
to be done on the Farm

EVERY DAY IS Earth Day.
This past Saturday, the
25th anniversary of the
first Earth Day, serves to remind
all of us of the precarious balance
on which the survival of the
Earth rests. Earth Day also
reminds us of our responsibility
to take action to protect our frag
ile planet.
Over the weekend, many envi
ronmental organizations aban
doned the traditional festivals
and celebrations and turned their
attention to working to restore
damaged ecosystems. A coalition
of 25 non-profit groups, led by
Palo Alto-based Bay Area Action,
pooled their resources to restore
14 sites on public lands around
the Peninsula, including Palo
Alto Baylands, Pescadero Marsh
and San Bruno Mountain. Hun
dreds of volunteers removed non
native invasive species and plant
ed native species in their place.
While not everybody was will
ing to perform manual labor for
the Earth on Saturday, there are
many other things people can do
to play their role in creating a
sustainable future. The Earth
Day motto — "Think globally, act
locally" — provides an excellent
synopsis of what people need to
start doing.
People need to be aware of the
nature of the global crisis facing
the Earth today. This means they
have a responsibility to educate
themselves about the rapid
destruction of forests around the
world, the threat to the global cli
mate from emissions of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse
gases, and the need for develop
ment policies around the world to
focus on sustainability rather
than short-term profits.
With this knowledge in hand,
people should alter their

lifestyles to minimize the impact
of their actions on the global
environment.
Perhaps most important, peo
ple need to greatly reduce their
consumption of energy and mate
rial goods. The University has
just signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Environ
mental Protection Agency's
Green Light Program agreeing to
spend $5 million over the next
five years to upgrade lighting sys
tems to make them more energy
efficient; in addition to being
environmentally sound, such
lights should save money, too.
Dorms should also strive to con
serve energy as much as possible.
The University could save money
on utility bills — and encourage
students to be more conscious
about energy consumption — by
sponsoring a campus-wide energy
conservation contest. Dorms could
compete against last year's ener
gy-use levels to strive to be the
most energy-efficient on campus;
rewards could range from free
pizza or ice cream to even mone
tary compensation, if possible.
One way to reduce the deple
tion of natural resources is to
recycle, although it is better to
reduce consumption in the first
place. While recycling, like ener
gy conservation, is ultimately the
responsibility of individuals, the
University could improve recy
cling rates on campus by sponsor
ing a campus-wide recycling con
test and, again, offering incen
tives to the best-performing
dorms. Stanford, meanwhile,
would save money on waste dis
posal fees.
Many of the changes necessary
to make our society sustainable
are economically attractive as
well, such as installing energy
efficient lighting. Students must
also realize, however, that to pro
tect our natural resources, every
one will have to make some sacri
fices which do not make them
better off financially — but
should make them happier never
theless.
