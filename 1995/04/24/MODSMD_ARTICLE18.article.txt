## Nearing twenty something 
### 
THIS IS MY last day as a teenager.
Tomorrow marks the official end
of that seven-year stretch made
of adolescence and innocence. And my
birthday tomorrow signifies the begin
ning of the void — my 20th year.
I won't be able to cling to pure youth
anymore. No longer can I claim to be
just 19 and wise beyond my years. Yet I
can't quite claim to be a member of the
fraternity of adulthood either. I won't
be able to walk into a bar and order a
sweet vermouth on the rocks with a
twist. What can I hope for in this, the
year of the big two-zero? Two voices in
my head send me in opposite directions
on the teeter-totter of being 20.
But Aaron, you're still so young!
Just look at yourself: You still only
have to shave twice a week! You're only
four years removed from learning how
to master the stick shift and ease the
car into first. It seems like yesterday
that you finally made it to high school.
You're still just a kid.
But Aaron, you're getting so old!
Just look at yourself: a college sopho
more with a future to think of and
grown-up concerns to deal with. The
time has come for you to master your
life and ease your career into first. It
seems like you've still got time to spare,
but think of fulfilling your dreams. And
what about the wife and kids?! You'll
be over the hill before you know it.
The college life gives each of these

voices their moments to speak to me.
When parents and alums marvel at
how long it's been since they were in
school, I feel so young. Only people
insane in their youth could keep the
schedules we do and actually survive.
On the other hand, college is our last
hoorah. Only a few more moments and
we'll be thrown into the real world.
We've made the transition to indepen
dence, and there is no turning back
from Stanford.
It's a hard lesson to face, but sooner
or later we realize that we can only feel
immortal for a limited time. It's more
fun looking ahead to growing up. Even
though we're not actually there, the
certainty that we'll arrive someday
makes the journey carefree. Now that
I'm about to be twenty, I'm on the
brink of being grown-up. I'm not sure if
I really do want to drink beer instead of
Kool-Aid.
What are the advantages of getting
older? I will have a year to think about
it before I'm officially an adult at 21,
but I've got a good list going. . . .
Chardonnay. Falling in love for
good. The wife and kids. A real job.
Watching the ball drop on a new mil
lennium. Class reunions. Opening my
time capsule from eighth grade. Watch
ing "Star Wars" at the Stanford The
ater. More and more memories. Listen
ing to U2 on the "oldies but goodies"
station. Grandkids. Wrinkles. Retire

ment and getting some of that Social
Security money back (maybe). Senior
citizen discounts at the bowling alley.
Seeing Haley's Comet come back. Less
hair to wash. Leaving my mark on this
world.
I can only become wiser. I won't get
depressed as more and more flames
appear on my birthday cake each year.
Sure, all the years will be gone, but
think of all the memories. It is going to
be great someday to sit the little ones
on my lap when my hair is all white and
start sentences with, "Yeah, I remem
ber when. . and "Back when I was
your age. ..." They'll beam at me in all
their youth and give me big hugs.
For now I'm only saying good-bye to
the teenage years. If the next however
many years are as fun as the first 20,
then I'm ready. Age is all a matter of
perspective anyway. My kid sister
thinks I'm so old, and my great-grand
ma thinks I'm so young. I guess I'm
somewhere in the middle, just living
each day as it comes.
Twentysomething. It's got a nice
ring to it. And hey, I'm only halfway to
being over the hill.

Aaron invites everyone over for cake
and ice cream at his place tomorrow
night!
