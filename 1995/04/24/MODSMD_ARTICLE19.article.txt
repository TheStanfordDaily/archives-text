Students exhibited shameful behavior at Elders 9 speech

I AM WRITING to express utter disbe
lief and discontent as well as outright
shame to be a part of a student body
that is inconsiderate and disrespectful.
Specifically, I am referring to the treat
ment of the former U.S. Surgeon Gener
al, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, last Tuesday
night in Memorial Auditorium.
After an insightful speech spoken from
the heart, Dr. Elders was half-heartedly
received with a standing ovation. At this
point, many students filed out of the
auditorium, which would have been an
appropriate time to do so. However, the
ensuing display of disrespect represented
sheer ignorance of common courtesy. I
am confident that the guest speaker —
being southern-bred and more sensitive
to etiquette — was not only aware of the

mass exodus of students, but also offend
ed. The exhibition the other night would
be considered rude according to anyone's
book of etiquette and made a poor exam
ple for future guest speakers.
In addition to the indifferent behavior
of the students, it must be stated that
even the ASSU Speakers Bureau and
Stanford-in-Government ineptly respond
ed to the situation. Poor planning and
true inexperience resounded for our spe
cial guest. The question-and-answer ses
sion could have been limited in time or
stopped altogether once students began to
leave. At this point, an announcement
should have been made that interested
students could trek across campus to fur
ther pursue the discussion at Adams
House with Dr. Elders. Instead, I was

amazed to see the student usher convers
ing with members in the audience rather
than controlling the microphone in a pro
fessional way. Unbelievably rude, this
individual certainly wasn't hired for his
manners.
For those students who remained until
the end of the program, they witnessed
further displays of disrespect. During the
question-and-answer session, one student
felt it necessary to launch into an anti
abortion tirade, which simply was inap
propriate for such a forum. Another stu
dent just wanted to argue with the Sur
geon General. Still another challenged
Dr. Elders to justify her motives.
Finally, the fact that The Daily's sub
sequent article failed to mention this inci
dent makes me wonder if the newspaper

condones such poor behavior. The article
mentions that a crowd of 1,300 gathered
in Memorial Auditorium, but it does not
state that fewer than 300 remained until
the end. I also wonder if the writer stayed
until the end of the speech or was even at
the speech. The caption under the front
page photo even incorrectly claims that
the speech took place in Kresge Auditori
um.
I hope that the ASSU Speakers
Bureau can work out its kinks, and other
program organizers will learn from this
incident. Obviously Stanford students
need some etiquette lessons. Let's start
with this one: It is rude to walk away
while someone is talking.
