# Help is available to all suffering from problem of relationship violence
## 
### 
Stanford University needs a domestic
and dating violence policy. I applaud Judge
Eugene Hyman, Chief Marvin Herrington,
Director Alejandro Martinez and others on
the Stanford campus for beginning to rec
ognize that relationship abuse occurs here,
too.
As someone who has worked with the

Support Network for Battered Women,
our local shelter and service agency since
1991,1 know Stanford students, staff and
spouses do seek out assistance for relation
ship abuse problems. As an undergraduate
volunteer at the Support Network, the
first restraining order I helped a batter9d
woman obtain was for a Stanford graduate
student. Students have stayed at the Sup
port Network's shelter. As an instructor of
the Issues in Self-Defense for Women
classes, I met students who had suffered
and were continuing to suffer from abuse
at the hands of their partners. Conducting
a training session for graduate housing

resident assistants, I heard the RAs' suspi
cions about fights they could hear behind
closed doors.
Unfortunately, we at Stanford are not
immune to the problems of dating and
domestic violence. What starts as a slap or
a shove often escalates to hitting, kicking,
punching, cutting, even threats of death.
Warning signs that physical abuse is
imminent include jealousy, possessiveness
and other controlling behavior.
Stanford community members who are
being abused or think they might have
been abused can receive free, confidential
support and services from the Support

Network for Battered Women. The Sup
port Network provides a 24-hour crisis
hotline in English and Spanish, counseling
services, support groups, legal services,
children's programs and emergency shel
ter services. It has an extensive outreach
program and will come talk to Stanford
dormitories about healthy versus violent
relationships. Stanford community mem
bers are also welcome to volunteer with
the agency. For more information, call the
Support Network's office at 940-7850 or
the crisis line at 940-7855.
