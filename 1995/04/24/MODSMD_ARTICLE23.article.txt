The No. 5 Stanford women's tennis team (21-2
overall, 10-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division) completed its perfect Pac-10 South season
this weekend by defeating both No. 27 USC (8-13)
and No. 6 UCLA (14-8).
The Cardinal sent the Bruins spiraling to their
sixth-straight dual-match loss 5-3 by winning four
out of six singles matches. Stanford also ended the
Trojans' two-match victory streak 6-0, as six singles
wins suspended doubles competition.
Stanford took the division crown by a landslide,
winning all 10 matches against six different teams.
With five of the six constantly ranked in the top 10
nationally, the schedule gave the Cardinal eight
matches vs. top-10 opponents. Ranked as high as
second and as low as seventh throughout the season,
Stanford, both on the road and at home, calmly
chalked up enormous victories against California
when the Bears sat at No. 2, UCLA at No. 4 and Ari
zona at No. 5.
"I'm impressed," head coach Frank Brennan said
about the squad's accomplishments. "I was really
pleased. We just had a great year. We're really only a
couple points or games away from being undefeated
[for the entire season]. To go on the road in the Pac
-10 and be undefeated and then to come home and be
undefeated shows a lot of consistency."
The Cardinal's only two losses of the season came
against UCLA at the National Team Indoors in
Madison, Wis., and at home against Texas. Stanford
fell to the Bruins narrowly 5-4 and has shown its
superiority over UCLA in defeating the squad twice
since. Texas took that match 6-3 as the Cardinal
failed to finish games in which they had the advan
tage.
Stanford has, since the Texas loss, reeled off 10
consecutive victories, five against top 10 teams and
six on the road. "The difference might be Ania
[Bleszynski]," Brennan said. "She broke out of her
slump just in time. Her match is worth one-ninth of
the match so to get her beating some people is good."

Junior Ricky Becker follows through in his convincing victory over UCLA's Kyle
Spencer on Saturday.
"Plus, I think everyone's just a
little bit tougher, and doubles
have come together. [Kim] Shas
by and [Emily] Burt are playing
real well, and Katie [Schlukebir]
and Ania are capable of some
quality tennis."
The Cardinal exhibited that
quality tennis yesterday against
UCLA, making its bid for com
fortable seeding in the NCAA
tournament. Stanford stole the
back four singles matches and
took a 4-2 lead into doubles, need
ing only one to clinch the win and
an undefeated conference record.
UCLA's one-two singles punch
of No. 2 ranked Jane Chi and No.
3 Keri Phebus brought the hosts
their only triumphs of the day at
the top two singles positions. Chi
posted a 6-2, 6-2 win over sopho
more Katie Schlukebir (14-8)
while Phebus gave senior Kim
Shasby (16-5) her first loss in
seven attempts, 6-2, 6-4.
The Cardinal dominated the
back four matches, winning three
of the four in straight sets. Fresh
man Ania Bleszynski (12-7) at
No. 3 continued to get back on
track in defeating feisty Paige
Yaroshuk, 6-4, 7-6. Bleszynski
had trouble in her slump of fin
ishing game and match points,
but took the second set tie-break
er and eliminated the possibility
of a Yaroshuk comeback.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva
(18-3) outlasted Diana Spadea in
the No. 4 match despite dropping
the first set 6-3. De Silva came
back fiercely in the second and
third set, taking the match, 3-6,
6-1, 6-2. Freshman Julie Scott
(18-5) stepped up to the net
against Anicia Mendez in the No.
5 spot and sent her to the locker
room quickly with a 6-3, 6-4 vic
tory.
Junior Beth Berris (7-0), fill

ing in for flu-ridden Amy
Chiminello, also continued to roll
since joining the team from
injury in late March. She took
down Bruin Kelly Rudolph with
little difficulty, 6-1, 6-4.
Despite needing only one dou
bles victory to secure the win, the
Cardinal would not find it in the
No. 1 match. UCLA's singles
stars, Chi and Phebus, teamed up
to throw down Schlukebir and
Bleszynksi (11-5) in straight sets,
6-4, 6-2.
Yet the Bruins could find no
more holes in the Stanford lineup
as the Cardinal looked to a famil
iar tandem for victory. Burt and
Shasby (11-2) fought back hard
earlier that week to take the Cal
match in dramatic fashion and
stood as winners of seven straight
matches. They extended that
streak to seven and the Cardi
nal's to 10 by putting down
Spadea and Mendez, 6-3, 7-6.
Shasby then, in both doubles
and singles, has currently posted
unparalleled numbers. She has
won 13 of her last 14 matches and
has moved from No. 3 in the sin
gles lineup to No. 2. She and Burt
received the same promotion in
doubles as well.
"Her confidence is up," Bren
nan said. "She's in better shape,
she's moving real well, and she's
hitting real well. Ever since the
Indoors, she's been getting better
and better."
On the previous day, the Car
dinal seemed to use the Women of
Troy as a punching bag exercise
in its warm-up for the Bruins.
Stanford took all six singles
matches in straight sets for its
fifth sweep of the season. The six
victories effectively canceled the
doubles play.
Schlukebir got rid of Suzie
Italiano quickly, as she did in
their previous meeting, 6-3, 6-2
while Shasby found little chal
lenge in her 6-2, 6-1 victory over
Nicole London. The Nos. 3 and 4
matches found a bit much more
competition, but Bleszynski took

her 7-6 tie-breaker win in the
first set and rolled to a 7-6, 6-0
triumph over Maggie Simkova.
USC's Petra Schmitt extended
De Silva to a first set battle, but
De Silva prevailed 7-5 and took
the second set 6-0 for her second
win over Schmitt this season.

Scott and Berris also coasted
for wins. Scott took Melissa Her
nando down 6-4, 6-2, avenging
for a three set loss to Hernando
in Palo Alto. Berris met Sayaka
Kimura in the No. 6 match and
made a nasty first impression on
Kimura with a 6-4, 6-1 victory.

Junior Ricky Becker follows through in his convincing victory over UCLA's Kyle
Spencer on Saturday.
"Plus, I think everyone's just a
little bit tougher, and doubles
have come together. [Kim] Shas
by and [Emily] Burt are playing
real well, and Katie [Schlukebir]
and Ania are capable of some
quality tennis."
The Cardinal exhibited that
quality tennis yesterday against
UCLA, making its bid for com
fortable seeding in the NCAA
tournament. Stanford stole the
back four singles matches and
took a 4-2 lead into doubles, need
ing only one to clinch the win and
an undefeated conference record.
UCLA's one-two singles punch
of No. 2 ranked Jane Chi and No.
3 Keri Phebus brought the hosts
their only triumphs of the day at
the top two singles positions. Chi
posted a 6-2, 6-2 win over sopho
more Katie Schlukebir (14-8)
while Phebus gave senior Kim
Shasby (16-5) her first loss in
seven attempts, 6-2, 6-4.
The Cardinal dominated the
back four matches, winning three
of the four in straight sets. Fresh
man Ania Bleszynski (12-7) at
No. 3 continued to get back on
track in defeating feisty Paige
Yaroshuk, 6-4, 7-6. Bleszynski
had trouble in her slump of fin
ishing game and match points,
but took the second set tie-break
er and eliminated the possibility
of a Yaroshuk comeback.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva
(18-3) outlasted Diana Spadea in
the No. 4 match despite dropping
the first set 6-3. De Silva came
back fiercely in the second and
third set, taking the match, 3-6,
6-1, 6-2. Freshman Julie Scott
(18-5) stepped up to the net
against Anicia Mendez in the No.
5 spot and sent her to the locker
room quickly with a 6-3, 6-4 vic
tory.
Junior Beth Berris (7-0), fill

ing in for flu-ridden Amy
Chiminello, also continued to roll
since joining the team from
injury in late March. She took
down Bruin Kelly Rudolph with
little difficulty, 6-1, 6-4.
Despite needing only one dou
bles victory to secure the win, the
Cardinal would not find it in the
No. 1 match. UCLA's singles
stars, Chi and Phebus, teamed up
to throw down Schlukebir and
Bleszynksi (11-5) in straight sets,
6-4, 6-2.
Yet the Bruins could find no
more holes in the Stanford lineup
as the Cardinal looked to a famil
iar tandem for victory. Burt and
Shasby (11-2) fought back hard
earlier that week to take the Cal
match in dramatic fashion and
stood as winners of seven straight
matches. They extended that
streak to seven and the Cardi
nal's to 10 by putting down
Spadea and Mendez, 6-3, 7-6.
Shasby then, in both doubles
and singles, has currently posted
unparalleled numbers. She has
won 13 of her last 14 matches and
has moved from No. 3 in the sin
gles lineup to No. 2. She and Burt
received the same promotion in
doubles as well.
"Her confidence is up," Bren
nan said. "She's in better shape,
she's moving real well, and she's
hitting real well. Ever since the
Indoors, she's been getting better
and better."
On the previous day, the Car
dinal seemed to use the Women of
Troy as a punching bag exercise
in its warm-up for the Bruins.
Stanford took all six singles
matches in straight sets for its
fifth sweep of the season. The six
victories effectively canceled the
doubles play.
Schlukebir got rid of Suzie
Italiano quickly, as she did in
their previous meeting, 6-3, 6-2
while Shasby found little chal
lenge in her 6-2, 6-1 victory over
Nicole London. The Nos. 3 and 4
matches found a bit much more
competition, but Bleszynski took

her 7-6 tie-breaker win in the
first set and rolled to a 7-6, 6-0
triumph over Maggie Simkova.
USC's Petra Schmitt extended
De Silva to a first set battle, but
De Silva prevailed 7-5 and took
the second set 6-0 for her second
win over Schmitt this season.

Scott and Berris also coasted
for wins. Scott took Melissa Her
nando down 6-4, 6-2, avenging
for a three set loss to Hernando
in Palo Alto. Berris met Sayaka
Kimura in the No. 6 match and
made a nasty first impression on
Kimura with a 6-4, 6-1 victory.
