The No. 5 Stanford women's tennis team (21-2
overall, 10-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division) completed its perfect Pac-10 South season
this weekend by defeating both No. 27 USC (8-13)
and No. 6 UCLA (14-8).
The Cardinal sent the Bruins spiraling to their
sixth-straight dual-match loss 5-3 by winning four
out of six singles matches. Stanford also ended the
Trojans' two-match victory streak 6-0, as six singles
wins suspended doubles competition.
Stanford took the division crown by a landslide,
winning all 10 matches against six different teams.
With five of the six constantly ranked in the top 10
nationally, the schedule gave the Cardinal eight
matches vs. top-10 opponents. Ranked as high as
second and as low as seventh throughout the season,
Stanford, both on the road and at home, calmly
chalked up enormous victories against California
when the Bears sat at No. 2, UCLA at No. 4 and Ari
zona at No. 5.
"I'm impressed," head coach Frank Brennan said
about the squad's accomplishments. "I was really
pleased. We just had a great year. We're really only a
couple points or games away from being undefeated
[for the entire season]. To go on the road in the Pac
-10 and be undefeated and then to come home and be
undefeated shows a lot of consistency."
The Cardinal's only two losses of the season came
against UCLA at the National Team Indoors in
Madison, Wis., and at home against Texas. Stanford
fell to the Bruins narrowly 5-4 and has shown its
superiority over UCLA in defeating the squad twice
since. Texas took that match 6-3 as the Cardinal
failed to finish games in which they had the advan
tage.
Stanford has, since the Texas loss, reeled off 10
consecutive victories, five against top 10 teams and
six on the road. "The difference might be Ania
[Bleszynski]," Brennan said. "She broke out of her
slump just in time. Her match is worth one-ninth of
the match so to get her beating some people is good."
