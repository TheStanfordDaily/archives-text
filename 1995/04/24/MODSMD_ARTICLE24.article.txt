# Men finish without loss for first time since 1978

USC 2
Stanford 5

The top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (23-0 overall,
10-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
ended its regular season with a
flourish last weekend as the Car
dinal maintained its unblemished
record with 5-2 victories over
both No. 9 USC (14-7, 5-5 in the
Pac-10) and No. 4 UCLA (17-5, 7-
3 in the Pac-10) at Stanford Ten
nis Stadium.
This is only the second time
since World War II that the Car
dinal has finished the regular sea
son undefeated. Stanford
amassed its only other perfect
record during the national cham
pionship year of 1978.
"Only one out of 12 national
championship teams of ours went
undefeated," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "We're very
proud of doing something that
other teams at Stanford haven't
done."
More importantly for Gould
and his Cardinal, the victories
made certain that Stanford will
be the top seed in the NCAA
championships to be held May 13-
21 in Athens, Ga. The Cardinal
handed second-ranked Georgia its
only loss of the season last Febru
ary at the National Indoor Cham
pionships.
Having already defeated UCLA
twice prior to last weekend, Stan
ford needed a victory over USC
Friday to secure the No. 1 seed at
NCAAs. Things were not looking
up for the Cardinal after the Tro
jans took the doubles point by
winning two of three matches.
"All the doubles matches were
close, but we couldn't break their
serve. We did not return well,

with the exception of Ricky Beck
er," Gould said.
But Stanford regrouped before
singles play and was able to pull
out the four needed victories.
"We were pretty calm at half
time. We talked about needing to
win four matches and we won five
out of six. At home it's a little bit
easier to do that. The crowd
helped us," Gould said.
Stanford certainly benefited
from the presence of a near
capacity crowd of about 1,000 on
the stadium courts, but it was on
the backcourts where Stanford
began its best work of the day.
Grant Elliott (21-2) opened the
scoring for the Cardinal with a 6-
2, 6-1 victory over Fernando
Samayoa in No. 5 singles. Ricky
Becker (17-3) followed suit in the
No. 6 slot, notching 6-3, 7-5 deci
sion over Kyle Spencer.
In No. 2 singles, No. 25 Scott
Humphries (16-3) broke in the
last game to defeat No. 47 Adam
Peterson, 6-1, 6-7, 6-4.
Humphries had been serving for
the match in the second set.
Sixth-ranked Jeff Salzenstein
(20-3) then clinched the victory
for Stanford with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2
victory over No. 4 Brett Hansen.
"I knew Hansen was gunning
for me because we had played
twice before and split those
matches," Salzenstein said. "He
got a little rattled by the crowd."
Against UCLA, the Cardinal
captured the doubles point when
Salzenstein and Elliott achieved a
late break against Matt Breen
and Heath Montgomery to win 8-
5 and give Stanford the needed
two-out-of-three doubles victo
ries.
"The doubles point was huge,"


Gould said.
Requiring just three singles
victories this time, Stanford
needed to look no further than
its top three players. In rapid
order, they defeated their oppo
nents to give Stanford the victo
ry, but not before UCLA mount
ed a mini-comeback.
Stanford won the first three
sets in the stadium, but then
play became a little shaky.
UCLA gained early breaks in
each of those matches, and
Elliott and Thomas had already
dropped the first sets of matches
they would eventually lose. The
Bruins seemed to be turning the
momentum back in their direc

tion, but Stanford regained the
upper hand.
Salzenstein continued his tor
rid seven-match win streak with
a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of No. 64 Justin
Gimelstob. The Bruin is a fresh
man who just graduated from
high school last January, but
whose powerful serve and fore
hand make him a bona fide pro
prospect. Salzenstein beat him
by continually playing to Gimel
stob's backhand side.
"I felt like if he had time to set
up with his backhand, he would
hit the winners," Salzenstein
said, "but if he was running I
knew where it would go."
Gimelstob recognized the
Salzenstein's strategy, but only
after the match was complete.
"My backhand pass is one of
my best shots, but it just seemed
like he was reading it today,"
Gimelstob said.

Humphries completed his
weekend sweep by defeating No.
16 Eric Taino, 6-3, 6-2.
"Humphries had lost pretty
badly to Taino twice and to Pert
erson once. To see him come out
and beat those two guys was a
tremendous boost for him psy
chologically," Gould said.
Goldstein clinched the unde
feated season with a 6-4, 6-4 win
over No. 28 Robert Janacek.
After the victory, Goldstein ran
to the net and pumped his fists
in front of the standing room
only crowd in attendance.
Many of the fans stayed to
watch Becker win his match at
No. 6, 6-3, 7-5 over Kyle
Spencer. They also witnessed
Grant Elliott's first legitimate
loss of the season, a 7-6, 7-6
defeat at the hands of Matt
Breen. The Australian freshman
revealed the secret to beating

Elliott after the match.
"Grant, I think, was little bit
off his game at times," Breen
said. "He outplayed me in the
Indoors, where the surface
helped him because he serves
and volleys every point. Out
here, I was able to neutralize his
serve and volley game on the
slower court."
However, the strong team
effort compensated for Thomas
and Elliott's losses.
"It was really good to see
Ricky step up and win the first
set fairly easily in both matches,
and then put them away in the
second instead of going three and
diddling around," Gould said.
"Usually, it's Grant and
Jimmy leading the way. This
time it was nice to see the other
guys pick up and take over and
help them when they were strug
gling."
