USC 2
Stanford 5

The top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (23-0 overall,
10-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
ended its regular season with a
flourish last weekend as the Car
dinal maintained its unblemished
record with 5-2 victories over
both No. 9 USC (14-7, 5-5 in the
Pac-10) and No. 4 UCLA (17-5, 7-
3 in the Pac-10) at Stanford Ten
nis Stadium.
This is only the second time
since World War II that the Car
dinal has finished the regular sea
son undefeated. Stanford
amassed its only other perfect
record during the national cham
pionship year of 1978.
"Only one out of 12 national
championship teams of ours went
undefeated," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "We're very
proud of doing something that
other teams at Stanford haven't
done."
More importantly for Gould
and his Cardinal, the victories
made certain that Stanford will
be the top seed in the NCAA
championships to be held May 13-
21 in Athens, Ga. The Cardinal
handed second-ranked Georgia its
only loss of the season last Febru
ary at the National Indoor Cham
pionships.
Having already defeated UCLA
twice prior to last weekend, Stan
ford needed a victory over USC
Friday to secure the No. 1 seed at
NCAAs. Things were not looking
up for the Cardinal after the Tro
jans took the doubles point by
winning two of three matches.
"All the doubles matches were
close, but we couldn't break their
serve. We did not return well,

with the exception of Ricky Beck
er," Gould said.
But Stanford regrouped before
singles play and was able to pull
out the four needed victories.
"We were pretty calm at half
time. We talked about needing to
win four matches and we won five
out of six. At home it's a little bit
easier to do that. The crowd
helped us," Gould said.
Stanford certainly benefited
from the presence of a near
capacity crowd of about 1,000 on
the stadium courts, but it was on
the backcourts where Stanford
began its best work of the day.
Grant Elliott (21-2) opened the
scoring for the Cardinal with a 6-
2, 6-1 victory over Fernando
Samayoa in No. 5 singles. Ricky
Becker (17-3) followed suit in the
No. 6 slot, notching 6-3, 7-5 deci
sion over Kyle Spencer.
In No. 2 singles, No. 25 Scott
Humphries (16-3) broke in the
last game to defeat No. 47 Adam
Peterson, 6-1, 6-7, 6-4.
Humphries had been serving for
the match in the second set.
Sixth-ranked Jeff Salzenstein
(20-3) then clinched the victory
for Stanford with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2
victory over No. 4 Brett Hansen.
"I knew Hansen was gunning
for me because we had played
twice before and split those
matches," Salzenstein said. "He
got a little rattled by the crowd."
Against UCLA, the Cardinal
captured the doubles point when
Salzenstein and Elliott achieved a
late break against Matt Breen
and Heath Montgomery to win 8-
5 and give Stanford the needed
two-out-of-three doubles victo
ries.
"The doubles point was huge,"
