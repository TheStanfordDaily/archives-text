## Baseball takes three from Cal

The Stanford baseball squad,
streakier of late than a Berkeley
student parading the Cal campus
in the buff, is playing (again) in
its winning form and soliciting
tips from the Energizer Bunny in
hopes of keeping the most recent
trend going and going.
On the heels of losing four key
games in a row — including three
losses to league-leading USC and
a dismal 4-0 loss to California last
Thursday — the Cardinal (25-18
overall, 15-9 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division) rebounded

and declawed the Bears in the
final three games of a four-game
stint this weekend by scores of 6-
3, 7-0 and 16-8.
"These last three games we
have really put it together," said
junior catcher A.J. Hinch, who hit
9-for-20 in the series with three
runs scored and seven RBIs. "We
want to continue this and keep
plugging away."
Sunday's game turned into a
Cal pitchers show, but only
because the Bears were forced to
show most of their pitchers in the
face of Stanford's relentless scor
ing. Cal sported seven hurlers in
the game and had nobody remain
ing in the "bear" bullpen to call
on at the end of the game.
The Cardinal fell behind at
Evans Diamond 7-4 following Pat
O'Hara's grand slam homer off
sophomore right-handed pitcher
Brendan Sullivan in the fourth

inning. In the fifth inning, Cardi
nal sophomore right-hander Tom
Reimers took control of Cal's
offense and halted a Bear drive
that looked to swamp Stanford.
"I knew that the way this game
was heading it was going to be a
high-scoring affair," said Reimers
(3-1), who gave up two hits in
three and a third innings and
picked up the win. "I just needed
to get some outs, keep them from
scoring and wait for our guys to
put up more numbers."
Reimers didn't have to wait
long, as the Cardinal soon blew
the Bears into oblivion. Cal's
four-run fourth inning was more
than matched by Stanford's eight
runs on eight hits in the sixth
inning. The lead was extended to
15-7 in the seventh inning, when
the Cardinal surpassed a season
