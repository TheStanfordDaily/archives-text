## Baseball takes three from Cal

The Stanford baseball squad,
streakier of late than a Berkeley
student parading the Cal campus
in the buff, is playing (again) in
its winning form and soliciting
tips from the Energizer Bunny in
hopes of keeping the most recent
trend going and going.
On the heels of losing four key
games in a row — including three
losses to league-leading USC and
a dismal 4-0 loss to California last
Thursday — the Cardinal (25-18
overall, 15-9 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division) rebounded

and declawed the Bears in the
final three games of a four-game
stint this weekend by scores of 6-
3, 7-0 and 16-8.
"These last three games we
have really put it together," said
junior catcher A.J. Hinch, who hit
9-for-20 in the series with three
runs scored and seven RBIs. "We
want to continue this and keep
plugging away."
Sunday's game turned into a
Cal pitchers show, but only
because the Bears were forced to
show most of their pitchers in the
face of Stanford's relentless scor
ing. Cal sported seven hurlers in
the game and had nobody remain
ing in the "bear" bullpen to call
on at the end of the game.
The Cardinal fell behind at
Evans Diamond 7-4 following Pat
O'Hara's grand slam homer off
sophomore right-handed pitcher
Brendan Sullivan in the fourth

inning. In the fifth inning, Cardi
nal sophomore right-hander Tom
Reimers took control of Cal's
offense and halted a Bear drive
that looked to swamp Stanford.
"I knew that the way this game
was heading it was going to be a
high-scoring affair," said Reimers
(3-1), who gave up two hits in
three and a third innings and
picked up the win. "I just needed
to get some outs, keep them from
scoring and wait for our guys to
put up more numbers."
Reimers didn't have to wait
long, as the Cardinal soon blew
the Bears into oblivion. Cal's
four-run fourth inning was more
than matched by Stanford's eight
runs on eight hits in the sixth
inning. The lead was extended to
15-7 in the seventh inning, when
the Cardinal surpassed a season

high with its 23rd hit en route to
26 total.
"The last three or four weeks
I've felt really confident personal
ly," Reimers said. "I came in here
today knowing that I had another
shot, and the team needed some
body to step up."
Just for good measure, Stanford
bagged one more run in the ninth
inning and Cal scored one fruitless
run in the bottom of the ninth to
set the final score of the drubbing
at 16-8.
Every player in Stanford's line
up collected at least two hits in the
game, and the Cardinal produced
four doubles and two triples
against lackluster Cal pitching.
Seven Cardinal athletes collected
RBIs, and freshman center fielder
Joe Kilburg crossed home four
times in Stanford's longest game of
the season.
Other big performances for the
Cardinal, which were not hard to
find on Sunday, included junior
left fielder Cale Carter (4-for-6,
three RBIs), senior third baseman
Steve Carver (3-for-5, three runs,
three RBIs) and junior second
baseman Brian Dallimore (4-for-6,
two RBIs).
The third game of the series was
also a Cardinal bat show. Stanford
scored in five of the nine innings,
and the offensive action was
launched by Hinch's solo home
run with no outs in the bottom of
the first inning. The Cardinal
scored again in the second after
freshman designated hitter Jon
SchaefTer singled in sophomore
shortstop Eric Sees from second
base.
The Cardinal scored three runs
in the first three innings but also
stranded six baserunners. Those
extra runs weren't needed in the
end, as junior Cardinal right-hand
ed pitcher Todd Bartels silenced
the Bears' bats during his seven
inning outing. He allowed only
three hits and struck out five in a
performance Cardinal catcher
Hinch dubbed "a gem."
"We are streaky, but our pitch
ing is quality up and down the line
up," Hinch said. "Our pitching is
going to keep us in every game, it's
just important for us to come out
offensively and attack and get a

lead, just like we did today."
That lead was extended in the
fourth inning, when Hinch nabbed
the second of his three RBIs on the
day. Stanford scored its fourth and
fifth runs in the fifth inning, the
first off the bat of SchaefTer in the
form of a single lofted over second
base with two out. The score
became 5-0 when Cal pitcher Alex
Franklin tossed a pickoff ball to
first from the mound that soared
over the head of first and allowed
Stanford's second run of the
inning to cross the plate.
J.D. Brammer replaced Bartels
and picked up where he left off.
Brammer worked a stellar two
innings, striking out three and
holding the Bears hitless in the
final two innings.
"We need to have a good last
part of the season to build momen
tum going into regionals," Bartels
said of Stanford's newly-discov
ered velocity heading into the end
of the regular season. "I think we
have Cal against the ropes now."
The three victories of the week
end moved Stanford ahead of Cal
in the Six-Pac and gave the Cardi
nal the edge in the season series, 4-
2. While Stanford still trails USC
for the conference lead with four
weeks to go, the victories over Cal
this weekend bolstered Stanford's
prospects.
"We [were] at a point in our sea
son where we were in a position to
compete for the league title, and
then we found ourselves just as
close to not even making the play
offs," Hinch said. "Spirits were
down a little bit, but it was a must
win situation. It was put up or shut
up time."
Saturday's game, the second of
the series, featured freshman
pitcher Kyle Peterson's fifth com
plete game and eighth victory of
the year. He struck out seven and
gave up three earned runs on nine
hits. Cale Carter went 2-for-4 with
one run scored and one RBI, and
Kilburg scored two runs.
The Cardinal trails conference
leader USC by one game and will
need some help in the form of at
least one loss by the Trojans in
order to capture the Six-Pac title.
"I really feel good about the way
we're playing," Reimers said.
"We're starting to swing the bats
and we're coming up with hits at
big times. USC has just got to
stumble a bit and we're right
there."
