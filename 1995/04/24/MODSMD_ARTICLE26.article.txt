In times of need, heroes
appear in all shapes and forms.
The Stanford baseball team
found a savior Saturday, and
he looked amazingly like junior
Todd Bartels.
The Cardinal pitching staff
entered the crucial four-game
series against California in dis
array. With last year's aces
junior Dan Reed and sopho
more Jason Middlebrook
injured and no true closer,
Stanford needed strong pitch
ing performances against the
Golden Bears.
On Thursday, the Cardinal
received a complete game from
junior Mike Robbing; on Fri
day, freshman Kyle Peterson,
the stopper all season, did his
job by taking the mound for all
nine innings and claiming the
victory. However, the pair
might have been outdone by
the duo of Bartels and Bram
mcr.
