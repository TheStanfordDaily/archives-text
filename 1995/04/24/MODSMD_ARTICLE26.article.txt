# Bartels fills rotation gap

In times of need, heroes
appear in all shapes and forms.
The Stanford baseball team
found a savior Saturday, and
he looked amazingly like junior
Todd Bartels.
The Cardinal pitching staff
entered the crucial four-game
series against California in dis
array. With last year's aces
junior Dan Reed and sopho
more Jason Middlebrook
injured and no true closer,
Stanford needed strong pitch
ing performances against the
Golden Bears.
On Thursday, the Cardinal
received a complete game from
junior Mike Robbing; on Fri
day, freshman Kyle Peterson,
the stopper all season, did his
job by taking the mound for all
nine innings and claiming the
victory. However, the pair
might have been outdone by
the duo of Bartels and Bram
mcr.
Entering the game with a 2-2
record and 7.04 earned run aver
age, Bartels did not exactly instill
fear in the hearts of the California
batters.
"It's been a difficult season,"
Bartels said. "I felt that my stuff*s
been good but I've been hit."
The right-hander had been bat
ted around pretty well by oppo
nents, allowing 32 hits and nine
walks in 23 innings of work.
Opposing hitters were reaching
base 40 percent of the time. Bar
tels reversed his string of disap
pointing performances on Satur
day.
In seven-plus innings of work,
Bartels gave up only three hits
and two walks en route to his
third win of the season. He credits
an added determination and an

understanding of what needed to
be done for his success.
Told Friday during the game
that he was going to start, Bartels
dissected the first two games and
studied how Peterson retired the
Bears.
"They're right on top of the
plate and that tells me that they
don't want the ball inside," Bar
tels said.
Bartels tied his career high by
striking out five batters. Although
the slider is his best pitch, he
eschewed it in favor of the fast
ball.
"Fastballs get them out," Bar
tels said. "I worked them in and
out to get them leaning. Then I
busted them inside with fastballs
inside."
Exhibiting great command,
Bartels spotted his pitches at will,
at times going long stretches with
out wasting one. In his seven
innings, Bartels worked four of
them perfectly, erasing California

batters 1-2-3. The only inning
where Bartels ran into a bit of
trouble was the fifth.
After retiring the first two bat
ters, sophomore shortstop Dan
Cey singled, limping to first base.
Center fielder Gary Johnson then
doubled to left field, which should
have scored Cey. However, a knee
injury that the son of former
major league star Ron "the Pen
guin" Cey suffered recently pre
vented him from going any fur
ther than third base. Bartels
induced the number nine batter,
junior Peter Economos, to fly out
to center, thus ending the threat.
Bartels actually worked into
the eighth inning but failed to
record an out before being
relieved by sophomore J.D. Bram
mer. Bartels struck out Johnson
to lead off the inning, but Johnson
reached base after A.J. Hinch
allowed his 14th passed ball of the
season. After the next batter
walked, coach Mark Marquess,

sensing that Bartels was tiring,
called on Brammer.
"I didn't feel tired but in the
walk I had my ball rise rather
than sink," Bartels said. "He must
have picked up on that and took
me out. I was planning on throw
ing 100 pitches and seeing where
that got me. It got me seven
innings as I threw 97 [on the
game]."
If California thought that it
was having trouble with Bartels'
fastball, Brammer literally blew
the Bears away. A hard-throwing
right-hander, Brammer struck
out three of the six batters he
faced. Throwing exclusively his
low 90s fastball and occasionally
keeping California honest with a
curve ball, Brammer retired all six
batters he faced to preserve the
shutout.
The blanking was the sixth of
the year for Stanford and the first
since the Cardinal won 7-0 at Cal
ifornia on March 4.
