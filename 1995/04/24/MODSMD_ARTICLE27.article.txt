It's over. Despite all the victories, all the
improvement, all the surmounted hurdles, the
1995 Stanford men's volleyball season is over. Sat
urday night, the No. 8 Brigham Young Cougars
stalked into Maples Pavilion and ambushed third
ranked Stanford in a five game nail-biter, 5-15, 11-
15, 15-10, 15-13, 16-14.
In an eerie replay of the last time these two
teams met, the Cardinal (18-7 overall, 14-6 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) lost despite
leading in every statistical category and controlling
most of the match.
"Come playoff time, the teams that win are the
ones that aren't tired to play," said freshman Tad
Hoffman. "[BYU] had more energy — they made
the big plays when they had to. We had big lapses,
and you can't do that on a consistent level to win."
Stanford pounded BYU (14-7, 13-7 in the
MPSF) down in game one with a .500 hitting per
centage. However, foreshadowing what would hap
pen later in the night, the Cougars jump-served to
a 4-0 lead in game two. Cardinal swing-hitters Mike
Lambert and Devin Poolman answered in kind
with blistering jump-serves. With strong blocking,
Stanford eventually won.
In the pivotal third game, BYU came back from
the brink of elimination through strong jump-serv
ing from outside hitters Adam Zuffinetti and Scott
Larkin and setter Jesse Gant. Zuffinetti, a fresh
man, came in off the bench and sparked a Cougar
run that lasted through the rest of the match.
"Zuffinetti did a fantastic job," said coach Ruben
Nieves. "The key to the match was his performance
off the bench. For whatever reason, it was just

enough to steady themselves
out."
The Cardinal had never
encountered ZufTinetti before and
seemed unable to respond to his
attack. He ended the match with a
.647 hitting percentage.
"I came out and just played my
hardest because this was our last
chance," Zuffinetti said.

night, closed out the game by

Stanford rallied in game
four, with sophomore swing-hitter
Matt Fuerbringer putting away
key kills and Chong keeping the
Cardinal alive with spectacular
digs and strong serving. Lambert
aced the Cougars and collected
multiple points off jump-serves,
but he was blocked again on game
point.
Both teams traded leads in
game five. Fuerbringer, who ended
with a match-high 47 kills, pound

ed a kill off a broken play that elec
trified the crowd and kept Stan
ford in the game. Sophomore
opposite hitter Brian Moore came
off the bench to block and the Car
dinal took a 13-12 lead. However,
the Cougars blocked Lambert and
Fuerbringer late to win.
"This is another match where
we clearly outplayed them, but
still lost," Nieves said. "We were
playing well, we were in control,
but somehow it got away from us."
Nieves noted that Stanford's
troubles with receiving the jump
serve, which have plagued the Car
dinal all season, ultimately had
much to do with the season-ending
loss.
"We gave up too many points on
the jump-serve at critical times,"
Nieves. "We improved tremen
dously over the season, but, for
whatever reason, it was a problem
again tonight."
Another problem for the Cardi
nal was the play of Cougar middle
blocker Kevin Hambly. Hambly
hurt Stanford with offense, 29
kills for a .468 percentage, and
defense, with a match-high eight

blocks.
By losing, the Cardinal effec
tively ended its season because it
can no longer secure the automat
ic MPSF bid for the Final Four.
Since its chances of receiving the
at-large bid over No. 1 UCLA or
No. 2 Hawaii are slim, Stanford
can only look ahead to next year.
Thirteen out of 15 players will
return, including all the starters
save senior Brian Garrett.
"The outlook for Stanford is
bright," Nieves said, "but this sea
son was not a success. There were
a lot of successes along the way,
but overall we didn't accomplish
our goal of winning the national
championship.
"It's hard to feel good about it
because we're a group that
wants to be the best — anything
short of that we're not satisfied
with. I still feel good about the
wins, about every one of the
guys, about the way the team
has progressed over the season.
But, ultimately, they didn't play
good enough and I didn't coach
good enough. We didn't get it
done."
