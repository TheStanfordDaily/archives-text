## Armour, Cline go to Buffalo while Stenstrom heads to Kansas City; Fisk reunited with Green in Minnesota 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
After a Saturday of watching names go by, Sun
day provided four Stanford football players with rea
son to celebrate.
Wide receiver Justin Armour, tight end Tony
Cline, quarterback Steve Stenstrom and defensive
tackle Jason Fisk were selected in this weekend's
National Football League draft. Armour and Cline
will team up with the Buffalo Bills, while Stenstrom
was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs, all in the
fourth round. Fisk will be reunited with former

Stanford head coach Dennis Green, now of the Min
nesota Vikings, who selected him in the seventh and
final round.
Many observers believed before the draft that
Stenstrom, who slipped to the final pick of the
fourth round and 134 th overall, would head the list
of Cardinal selections. However, concerns about
Stenstrom's arm strength and mobility apparently
dropped him below nine other quarerbacks, includ
ing USC's Rob Johnson and California's Dave Barr.
With the Chiefs, Stenstrom will enter into an
offensive scheme similar to the one
he mastered at Stanford. After
starting most of his four years
under former head coach Bill
Walsh, Stenstrom become the
school's all-time passing leader.
Walsh, the architert of the "West
Coast" passing offense employed
first by the San Francisco 49ers of
the 1980s and copied by several
NFL squads, has stated that he
believes Stenstrom was the most
prepared quarterback in the draft
for the pro game.
Stenstrom also inherits a quar
terback situation unsettled by the
retirement of 38-year-old Hall of
Famer Joe Montana. While aging
UCLA alum Steve Bono is expected
to start for the Chiefs in the near
future, Stenstrom will likely battle
former Virginia star Matt Blundin

for the current No. 2 spot on the
depth chart.
Stenstrom's favorite targets
Armour and Cline head for a fran
chise on the decline in Buffalo. After
four consecutive AFC titles, the
Bills fell on hard times last year, fin
ishing 7-9 with an aging core of skill-*
players like wide receiver Andrew
Reed and tight end Pete Metzelaars*
However, Father Time may givej
Armour and Cline a chance to con-*
tribute immediately to the Buffalo
offense. Although not blessed with
lightning speed, Armour's soft
hands and precise routes endeared
him to many scouts. Cline, a solid ,
blocker and reciever at tight end, ;
distinguished himself the past two
seasons after ineffective 1990 and
1992 campaigns and a redshirt year
in 1991. i
Unlike the other three players, ;
Fisk was not a sure selection. How- ;
ever, Minnesota grabbed him with ;
the 243 rd overall pick, just prior to
the draft's completion.
