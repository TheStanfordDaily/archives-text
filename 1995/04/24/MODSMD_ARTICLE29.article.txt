UCLA 11 10

The Stanford softball team's
weekend journey to sunny South
ern California offered the squad a
chance to test itself against the
best softball team in America.
The youthful Cardinal quickly
learned it has a long way to go
before it can hope to beat the likes
of Tanya Harding and No. 1
UCLA.
Harding, who asks not to be
confused with the notorious
United States figure skater who
bears her name, single-handedly
dominated Stanford (12-26 over
all, 1-17 in the Pacific 10 Confer

ence) in the second game of a
Thursday doubleheader that
UCLA (33-2, 16-1 in the Pac-10)
swept by a combined score of 21-
1.
"Amazing," Stanford coach
Sandy Pearce said to describe
Harding. "It's easy to see why
[UCLA was] so excited to get her
[at the beginning of spring quar
ter]. She's almost impossible to
stop at the plate and is just as
tough to hit off of."
On the mound, Harding was
practically perfect. The New
Zealand national team member
tossed a two-hitter, blanking the
Cardinal in a 10-0 UCLA white
wash. The Bruin fireballer hand
cuffed Stanford batters all after
noon, frustrating them with per
fectly placed pitches at several
different speeds.
The lone Cardinal highlight

was a double smacked by junior
shortstop Summer Lee, Stan
ford's leading hitter. Lee has
slammed at least one double in
four of her last six games and
leads the team with 10.
As a symbol of her dominating
effort, Harding struck out nine
Cardinal batters while walking
just one to finish the game with
three times as many strikeouts as
hits and walks allowed. With the
victory, Harding improved to 8-0
on the year.
Harding was equally impres
sive at the plate, collecting three
of UCLA's 17 hits, including a
two-run shot in the first inning
which puts her at four on the sea
son. For the game, the Bruins'
star drove in three of UCLA's 10
runs.
"She seems to play at a higher
level [than everyone else],"
Pearce said. "She's a dominating
force in the game."
UCLA jumped on Stanford
early, scoring three runs in the

home half of the first. Unable to
score, the Cardinal managed to
stay in the game behind excellent
pitching from sophomore Angela
Webb. Webb shut the Bruins
down in the second and third, and
she held UCLA to just one run in
the fourth.
Without offensive support
from her teammates, Webb tired
in the fifth and the top-ranked
Bruins broke through with four
runs. UCLA had five hits, includ
ing three consecutive doubles, in
the outburst. The rally began
after Webb retired the first two
Bruin hitters.
"They're very methodical,"
Pearce said of the Bruin attack.
"They're not as explosive (as No.
2 Arizona], but they're very solid.
They just quietly get it done. At
the same time, you can't give up
that many runs with two outs. We
could have stopped that."
In game one, UCLA dominated
throughout, scoring single runs
in the first and second and three
runs in the third to take a 5-0
lead. After a scoreless fourth, the
Bi ..lins scored three more times in
the fifth and sixth to finish off the
Cardinal 11-1.

Stanford's lone run came in
the top of the sixth. As she has
done time and time again this
season, Summer Lee began the
rally with a single. Junior center
fielder Toni Marengo followed
with a single. When junior left
fielder Amanda Renteria
reached on a throwing error, Lee
came around to score an
unearned run off UCLA's Carrie
Burns, who improved to 18-2
with the victory. Burns allowed
four hits, walked none, and
struck out five.
"UCLA's a great team," Pearce
said. "They definitely deserve to
be the No. 1 team in the nation.
They're more consistent than Ari
zona."
The only positive aspect of a
doubleheader sweep may be the
lessons learned by the Cardinal
while playing against the nation's
best team. If Friday's double
header at Loyola Marymount is
any indication, the Stanford team
learns quickly.
After splitting a double header
with the Lions earlier this year at
Stanford, the Cardinal swept Loy
ola on the road, taking both
games by 4-2 scores.
