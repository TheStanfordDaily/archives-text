Stanford i 0
UCLA 11 10

The Stanford softball team's
weekend journey to sunny South
ern California offered the squad a
chance to test itself against the
best softball team in America.
The youthful Cardinal quickly
learned it has a long way to go
before it can hope to beat the likes
of Tanya Harding and No. 1
UCLA.
Harding, who asks not to be
confused with the notorious
United States figure skater who
bears her name, single-handedly
dominated Stanford (12-26 over
all, 1-17 in the Pacific 10 Confer

ence) in the second game of a
Thursday doubleheader that
UCLA (33-2, 16-1 in the Pac-10)
swept by a combined score of 21-
1.
"Amazing," Stanford coach
Sandy Pearce said to describe
Harding. "It's easy to see why
[UCLA was] so excited to get her
[at the beginning of spring quar
ter]. She's almost impossible to
stop at the plate and is just as
tough to hit off of."
On the mound, Harding was
practically perfect. The New
Zealand national team member
tossed a two-hitter, blanking the
Cardinal in a 10-0 UCLA white
wash. The Bruin fireballer hand
cuffed Stanford batters all after
noon, frustrating them with per
fectly placed pitches at several
different speeds.
