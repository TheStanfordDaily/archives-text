# Med faculty laments loss of funds
## 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
School of Medicine faculty expressed con
cern Friday that post-doctoral students
would be hired in place of graduate students
in 1997, when the school loses federal indi
rect-cost money for research and teaching
assistantships.
At a meeting of the Medical School's fac
ulty senate, professors argued over the af
fordability of remitting graduate students'
tuition and providing them with living
stipends for research and teaching assis
tance.
Post-doctoral students have a set salary
and pay nominal tuition and thus could po

tentially be cheaper to hire than graduate
students, who receive full tuition remission
plus stipend, said Don Gibbons, director of
public relations for the Medical School.
Although Oncology Prof. Charlotte Ja
cobs, associate dean of the Medical School,
assured the senate that the University
would never let post-doctoral students be
cheaper than graduate students, faculty
were still concerned.
"Since we don't know how much all this
will cost us," said one senate member, "the
smart money is to hire post-docs, not gradu
ate students."
The federal government recently slashed
the budget of the National Institutes of
Health, reducing the rate of reimbursement

the Medical School can claim for indirect
costs incurred by research. The reduction
means that tuition remission could no
longer come from the Medical School's staff
benefit pool. Under the new system, faculty
would have to charge remission directly to
the grants and contracts.
In the past, $25 million of tuition remis
sion, comprising 18 percent of the staff ben
efit pool, went to fund teaching and research
assistantships, said Ed Caron, director of
Medical School Financial Aid. Stanford is
one of four universities — MIT, Caltech, and
Columbia are the others — allowed to use
money from the staff benefit pool to fund
such positions.
By adding tuition remission
directly to the cost of a grant,
research and graduate assistants
could become too expensive to
use.
Much of the anxiety voiced by
senate members Friday stemmed
from the fact that faculty do not
know exactly how much graduate
students will cost in 1997. The
amount of money the school can
use to pay for post-doctoral stu
dents could be anywhere from 8 to

12 percent of the staff benefit pool
in 1997. If the benefits rate is 8
percent and post-doctoral salaries
do not increase much, then they
could be cheaper than graduate
students, Gibbons said.
But if faculty doesn't hire grad
uate students, then "there won't
be any post-docs in three or four
years," Gibbons said.
Even if they are hired in decent
numbers, graduate students may
still suffer, some faculty said. "Fac
ulty might hire graduates part
time and pay them 75 percent of
what they paid them before but
expect them to do the same
amount of work," said Anatomy
Prof. Larry Mathers, chair of the

senate.
In 1994-5, research and teach
ing assistantships cost $2,503,696,
with $1,693,145 coming from the
departments and $864,551 million
from the Medical Scholars Pro
gram, which is funded by gifts from
alumni, Caron said. Graduate stu
dents holding such positions
received $8,147 each.
Jacobs said that under the new
plans, some departments will be
winners and some will be losers.
For instance, large labs with many
post-doctoral staffers and two
graduate students would benefit
because, despite the elimination of
funding from the staff benefit pool
for the students, salaries for post

doctoral students could be cheap
er.
Stanford's Medical School is
very unusual because most stu
dents spend 5.25 years at Stanford,
often stretching the prescribed
four years to do research and
teaching assistantships, Gibbons
said. The goal at Stanford is to pro
duce "clinical researchers" — doc
tors who research as well as prac
tice, Gibbons said.
"The entire culture and admis
sion of the Medical School is tied
to [research and teaching assis
tantships]. The worse case sce
nario would be if the faculty
didn't offer these positions,"
Jacobs said.
