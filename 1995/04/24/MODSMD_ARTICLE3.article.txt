School of Medicine faculty expressed con
cern Friday that post-doctoral students
would be hired in place of graduate students
in 1997, when the school loses federal indi
rect-cost money for research and teaching
assistantships.
At a meeting of the Medical School's fac
ulty senate, professors argued over the af
fordability of remitting graduate students'
tuition and providing them with living
stipends for research and teaching assis
tance.
Post-doctoral students have a set salary
and pay nominal tuition and thus could po

tentially be cheaper to hire than graduate
students, who receive full tuition remission
plus stipend, said Don Gibbons, director of
public relations for the Medical School.
Although Oncology Prof. Charlotte Ja
cobs, associate dean of the Medical School,
assured the senate that the University
would never let post-doctoral students be
cheaper than graduate students, faculty
were still concerned.
"Since we don't know how much all this
will cost us," said one senate member, "the
smart money is to hire post-docs, not gradu
ate students."
The federal government recently slashed
the budget of the National Institutes of
Health, reducing the rate of reimbursement

the Medical School can claim for indirect
costs incurred by research. The reduction
means that tuition remission could no
longer come from the Medical School's staff
benefit pool. Under the new system, faculty
would have to charge remission directly to
the grants and contracts.
In the past, $25 million of tuition remis
sion, comprising 18 percent of the staff ben
efit pool, went to fund teaching and research
assistantships, said Ed Caron, director of
Medical School Financial Aid. Stanford is
one of four universities — MIT, Caltech, and
Columbia are the others — allowed to use
money from the staff benefit pool to fund
