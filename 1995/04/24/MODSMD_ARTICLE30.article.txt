# Golf set for Pac-10s

The Stanford women's golf
team is going home, so to speak.
The No. 2 Cardinal played its
first tournament of the year at the
Trysting Tree Golf Course on the
campus of Oregon State during
the first week of October and won
the event over such teams as No.
3 San Jose State and No. 4 UCLA.
Now, over six and a half
months later, the team returns to
Corvallis for the Pacific 10 cham
pionships, a three-round, three
day affair which begins this
morning.
"We played very well there in
the fall," said head coach Tim
Baldwin. "[Sophomore] Andrea
Baxter and [senior] Jamille Jose,
especially, were just outstanding
— Andrea ended up winning the
[individual] title over a field of
about 90 golfers
The absence of No. 1 and two
time defending national champi
on Arizona State from that tour
nament victory, however, cannot
be overlooked. The Sun Devils
have captured every tournament
that they have entered this year
with extremely impressive perfor
mances in their last few, winning
by large-margins such as 33

strokes at the Ping / ASU Invita
tional and 48 at the Arizona Invi
tational.
"Arizona State is a fabulous
team; there's no doubt about it,"
said sophomore Mhairi McKay.
"They have the U.S. Amateur
Champion in Wendy Ward and a
two-time U.S. Junior Champion
in Kellee Booth. Heather Bowie,
also, is having an outstanding
season."
McKay, herself, proved no
slouch in the Cardinal's last tour
nament. She golfed her way to a
142 (four under par) and a victory
in the two-day California Colle
giate, held at the Stanford Golf
Course April 15 and 16. With
McKay and junior Vicky Strada
(who finished tied for second)
leading the way, Stanford was
able to tie San Jose State for the
team title.
"We hadn't beaten [the Spar
tans] on our own course in quite
awhile, so it was nice to not lose
to them," Baldwin said. "We've
been see-sawing with San Jose
State all year long in the polls, so
maybe a tie was fitting."
The Spartans, however, will
not participate in this week's
tournament since it is solely a
Pac-10 affair. The nine-team field
(California just began its golf pro
gram and will not be in atten
dance) includes six teams ranked
in the top 25 in the latest Golf
World poll, but only three — Ari
zona State, Stanford and UCLA
— should challenge for the title,
with the Sun Devils as the defi
nite favorite.

"If we play decent golf, then we
shouldn't have to worry about
UCLA," said senior Amy
Lawrence. "Arizona State is the
team to beat."
Teeing it up for the Cardinal
will be the five women who have
played together in each tourna
ment so far this year: Jose,
Lawrence, Strada, Baxter and
McKay. As usual in NCAA golf,
the highest individual score at the
end of each round is dropped, and
the remaining four scores are tab
ulated to get the team's result.
