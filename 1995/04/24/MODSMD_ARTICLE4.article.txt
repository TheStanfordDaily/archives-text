The University last week settled two
separate cases alleging sexual harassment
of female staff members by School of Med
icine faculty.
A settlement was reached Friday in a
lawsuit filed by a former lab assistant who
claimed that she had been sexually ha
rassed by retired Psychiatry Prof. Sey
mour Levine and that the University
failed to respond adequately. The finan
cial settlement is between $100,000 and
$700,000, according to court documents.
In a separate case, Urology Prof.
Thomas Stamey will face financial sanc
tions and has lost his department chair
manship in connection with sexual ha
rassment allegations brought against him
by a female staff member. The case is the
first to be prosecuted under Stanford's
new policy on sexual harassment
In a statement announcing the two set
tlements, University President Gerhard
Casper said, "Allegations about sexual ha
rassment require careful, thorough and

responsible investigation, and such inves
tigation takes time. The full record and
any sanctions must be weighed carefully."
In May 1994, former research assistant
Helen Bae filed suit in Santa Clara Coun
ty Superior Court against the University,

Levine, Casper, Medical
School Dean David Korn
and Medical School Se
nior Assoc. Dean for Fac
ulty Affairs Robert Cut
ler.
The suit alleged that
during Bae's employ
ment between July 1992
and May 1993, Levine
made suggestive com-

ments and unwelcome advances toward
Bae and other women in his office. The
suit claimed that on various occasions,
Levine kissed and hugged Bae against her
will and that at one point he grabbed Bae
and licked her face and nose in an imita
tion of his dog.
The suit also alleged that Casper, Korn,
