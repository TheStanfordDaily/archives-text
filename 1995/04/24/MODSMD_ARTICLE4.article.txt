# University settles harrassment suits
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The University last week settled two
separate cases alleging sexual harassment
of female staff members by School of Med
icine faculty.
A settlement was reached Friday in a
lawsuit filed by a former lab assistant who
claimed that she had been sexually ha
rassed by retired Psychiatry Prof. Sey
mour Levine and that the University
failed to respond adequately. The finan
cial settlement is between $100,000 and
$700,000, according to court documents.
In a separate case, Urology Prof.
Thomas Stamey will face financial sanc
tions and has lost his department chair
manship in connection with sexual ha
rassment allegations brought against him
by a female staff member. The case is the
first to be prosecuted under Stanford's
new policy on sexual harassment
In a statement announcing the two set
tlements, University President Gerhard
Casper said, "Allegations about sexual ha
rassment require careful, thorough and

responsible investigation, and such inves
tigation takes time. The full record and
any sanctions must be weighed carefully."
In May 1994, former research assistant
Helen Bae filed suit in Santa Clara Coun
ty Superior Court against the University,

Levine, Casper, Medical
School Dean David Korn
and Medical School Se
nior Assoc. Dean for Fac
ulty Affairs Robert Cut
ler.
The suit alleged that
during Bae's employ
ment between July 1992
and May 1993, Levine
made suggestive com-

ments and unwelcome advances toward
Bae and other women in his office. The
suit claimed that on various occasions,
Levine kissed and hugged Bae against her
will and that at one point he grabbed Bae
and licked her face and nose in an imita
tion of his dog.
The suit also alleged that Casper, Korn,


Casper
Cutler and the University knew
about Levine's conduct but failed
to respond adequately.
After Bae filed a formal com
plaint with the University in May
1993, Korn appointed an investiga
tion committee that found the com
plaint was justified, the Universi
ty's statement said. Levine received
a letter of censure in January 1994
but has received no other disci
plinary action from the University.
Levine retired earlier this
month but his lawyer, Richard
Posilippo, said that decision was
not necessarily connected with the
settlement or the accusations
against him.
Letters of apology
Among attached exhibits relat
ing to the settlement in the Levine
case is a letter of apology from
Levine to Bae.
"I am sorry for the distress you
experienced working in my labora
tory," the letter states. "I never
intended my conduct to offend you,
and I deeply regret that it did."
A separate letter to Bae signed
by Casper, Korn and Cutler states,
"We are sorry you had the experi
ence you did with Dr. Levine" and
acknowledges that a Medical
School review committee found in
August 1993 that "the charge (of
sexual harassment) is justified, and
appropriate action should be
taken."
In addition, the letter invites
Bae's recommendations for
improving the new policy on sexual
harassment. Bae lists those recom
mendations in another exhibit to
the settlement.
Posilippo said the settlement
provides "closure" to the conflict.
"From Dr. Levine's side, there's no
hard feelings harbored," he said.
Posilippo said much of the ten
sion in the case arose because at
the time of Bae's initial complaint,
Stanford had no formal means of
dealing internally with charges of
sexual harassment. Under the Uni

versity's new sexual harassment
policy adopted in 1993, cases like
Bae's might be handled more ami
cably, Posilippo said.
"Nobody knew quite how to
work through these things," he
said. "The new [policy 1 has a lot
more mediation."
Bae agreed in part, saying, "I do
believe that when I initially came
to the Medical School and to Presi
dent Casper, if they had delivered
an appropriate sanction ... it could
have been resolved earlier."
However, Bae said, the conflict
was more serious than Posilippo's
comments might suggest.
"Throughout this whole process
... it took a lot of doing ... trying
to get Stanford to give up what
records they had.... This was no
misunderstanding," she said.
Bae said she does not think "I'll
ever feel good about what hap
pened to me," but added that "for
the cause, it's definitely been
worth it."
Bae said she will enroll in a mas
ter's program at UC-Berkeley this
fall.
A history of harassment
Documents obtained by The
Daily suggest that Bae's complaint
was just one of a number of sexual
harassment accusations.
A file memorandum dated July
11, 1977 from then-Provost
William Miller indicates that
Levine assured Miller in a meeting
that he would cease his "excessive
ly familiar behavior towards the
female employees."
"Professor Levine told me that
he had learned quite a lesson and
that his intentions were quite inno
cent but that he recognized that
they were not interpreted as such
.. . and that he had corrected his
excessively familiar behavior of
hugging, touching, kissing, and
recognized that it was inappropri
ate; and further, he gave me his
personal assurances that there
would be no repetition of such
behavior," the memo states.
Casper was informed of the
1977 allegations in a September
1993 letter from Korn. Casper sub
sequently forwarded Levine a copy

of Miller's memo.
In a Jan. 5, 1994 letter to
Levine, Casper explained his rea
sons for choosing censure rather
than a more severe punishment.
"Suspension or dismissal seem
to me too severe and would be
detrimental to those who depend
on your presence for their work,"
the letter states. "A reduction in
pay does not seem appropriate to
an offense of this kind, nor does it
... add anything to a formal con
demnation."
Other internal University docu
ments point to separate accusa
tions of sexual harassment
brought against Levine 1986 and
1990. Neither accusation resulted
in a formal complaint.
Other cases
Stamey, meanwhile, has been
removed from his department
chairmanship and will face finan
cial penalties, including a perma
nent reduction in salary, in connec
tion to allegations of sexual harass
ment brought by a female staff
member.
University Communications
Director Terry Shepard said that
Stamey denies that he ever
engaged in sexual harassment.
Stamey is out of town and could
not be reached for comment.
The two sexual harassment set
tlements are the latest chapter in a
long history of harassment cases at
the Medical School.
In 1991, Dr. Frances Conley's
charge of sexism against Neuro
surgery Prof. Gerald Silverberg
attracted national media attention.
Conley left the Medical School for a
year in the wake of the incident.
The same year, two students
accused Prof. Mark Perlroth, a car
diologist, of harassment. He was
disciplined in 1992, but the details
were kept confidential.
In 1993, a Medical Center
administrative assistant filed suit
against Ophthalmology Prof.
Richard Sogg, charging him with
sexual harassment and claiming
that the University did not take
appropriate steps to prevent it.
That case was settled early last
year.
