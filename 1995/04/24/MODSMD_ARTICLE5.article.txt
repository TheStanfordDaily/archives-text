# Campaign factors key in ASSU fee victories
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Last spring, voters in the ASSU elec
tions sent student groups a stunning mes
sage of rebuke, denying over half the spe
cial-fee requests on the ballot. What a dif
ference year can make.
In fact, most groups this year not only
got their fees, but also had higher approval
margins than ever before for those fees.
Last year only 17 out of 36 special-fee
groups got funding, while this year 23
out of 29 were funded. Additionally, the
15 percent rule — which requires that
special fees be approved by 15 percent of
the student population — affected 10
groups last year, while it only affected
four this year.
The importance of the 15 percent
rule may also decrease in the future be
cause of the passage of the Common
Sense Fee Reform amendment, which
would split the student body into three
populations — graduate students, un
dergraduates and both graduates and
undergraduates.
Student leaders attribute the higher
approval of special fees to many factors:
increased publicity of events, more pro
gramming, redoubled campaigning, at
tempts to increase graduate involve
ment and a desire by students not to
have a repeat of last year's special-fee
bloodbath.

pus Chicano / Latino organization
MEChA — which did not have its special
fee approved last year — ascribed this
year's success to increased aware
ness of both the election and
MEChA programming.
"We put a lot of work into cam
paigning. We called people Wednes
day and Thursday and reminded
them to vote," Samaniego said.
"We also made people aware of
activities and co-sponsored many
programs. We tried to get everyone
informed."
MEChA also attempted this
year to involve more graduate stu
dents — many of whom voted
against the MEChA special fee last
year, Samaniego said.
But Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford (SEAS)
member Nick Thompson said he
thought the campus mood was the
decisive factor in the approval of
special fees.
"Last year, very few people got
their special fees approved because
of a backlash against the special
fee system," Thompson said. "The
whole feeling was that people
should not vote for anything and
many liberal organizations got
voted down."
He added that this year, SEAS
was "more organized and more
public" about its events.
Susie Thomas, chair of Stan

ford-in-Government (SIG) —
which had its special-fee request
denied last year — agreed with
Thompson. "There was a lot of
support for special fees because so
many groups did not get their spe
cial fee last year," Thomas said.
Thomas said she thought a
stronger voter turnout also helped
groups, particularly because of the
15 percent rule.
"Groups spent the whole year
mobilizing for this election because
they knew if they did not get their
special fee this year, they would not
survive," Thomas added.
SIG in particular tried to
increase awareness of its programs
and targeted students that it did
not normally reach, such as law
students, Thomas said.
Even groups whose special fees
were approved last year got higher
approval margins this year.
One such group was the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, whose margin of
approval went up nine percentage
points.
Speakers Bureau Director Scott
Moss attributed the increase to
attracting good speakers this year
and increased publicity of events.
In the past, Moss said, graduate
students have not always support
ed the Speakers Bureau strongly,
but because of more publicity
specifically aimed at graduate stu
dents, more of that population
approved its special fee.

Stanford American Indian
Organization co-chair Marissa
Flannery said the results of last
year's election prompted more stu
dents, particularly those in the eth
nic communities, to vote this year.
In addition, the passage of the
Common Sense Fee Reform
amendment last week may make it
easier for more special fees to be
approved. Under the amendment,
those groups who target their ser
vices to one part of the student
population will have their special
fee voted on only by that popula
tion.
"Groups that have undergradu
ate support will not have their spe
cial fees threatened," said amend
ment co-author Jon Oram, a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents
slate-elect, "We Deserve Better."
"People who enjoy the services will
pay for the services and those who
deserve support will get support."
The amendment may also
dimmish some of the effects of the
15 percent rule, said Axe Commit
tee Chair Craig Zajac. Axe Com
mittee did not have its special fee
approved this year or last year
because of the 15 percent rule.
"We would only apply to the
undergraduates for funding,"
Zajac said. "We only need 15 per
cent of the undergraduate vote and
a larger number of undergraduates
vote. By sheer numbers it helps
us."
