# Campaign factors key in ASSU fee victories
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Last spring, voters in the ASSU elec
tions sent student groups a stunning mes
sage of rebuke, denying over half the spe
cial-fee requests on the ballot. What a dif
ference year can make.
In fact, most groups this year not only
got their fees, but also had higher approval
margins than ever before for those fees.
Last year only 17 out of 36 special-fee
groups got funding, while this year 23
out of 29 were funded. Additionally, the
15 percent rule — which requires that
special fees be approved by 15 percent of
the student population — affected 10
groups last year, while it only affected
four this year.
The importance of the 15 percent
rule may also decrease in the future be
cause of the passage of the Common
Sense Fee Reform amendment, which
would split the student body into three
populations — graduate students, un
dergraduates and both graduates and
undergraduates.
Student leaders attribute the higher
approval of special fees to many factors:
increased publicity of events, more pro
gramming, redoubled campaigning, at
tempts to increase graduate involve
ment and a desire by students not to
have a repeat of last year's special-fee
bloodbath.
