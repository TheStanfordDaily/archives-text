# Political parties plan productive year for senate
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Despite winning the Council of
Presidents and eight of the ASSU Sen
ate's 20 votes, neither the victorious
People's Platform nor its rival party,
Students' Alliance, believe that the
Platform will dictate senate actions.
"We will proceed cautiously so as
not to haphazardly implement legisla
tion which does not directly serve the
needs of students," said undergradu
ate voting senator-elect Bill Snen, a
Platform leader. "A majority means
we have to be even more careful of
what we tiy to undertake."
In last week's election, all but one of
the 14 Platform-endorsed senators
won positions in the senate. Of the 12
candidates endorsed by the Alliance,
four won voting spots and two others
were elected to non-voting positions.
Alliance leader Andr6 Vanier, an
undergraduate voting senator-elect,
said that despite his party's shortfalls
on paper, next year's senate, which of
ficially meets May 9 to elect a chair,
should be more partisan than this
year's.
"We will continue to fight for
the rights of students," Vanier
said. "When necessary, we will act
in concert with independent sena
tors to block particularly heinous
Platform initiatives."
The number of votes for each
party actually will remain
unchanged from this year. While
the Platform appears to have an
upper hand on winning majority
votes, constitutional amendments
and bills requiring a two-thirds
majority will need strong biparti
san support.
"Most significant actions take
two-thirds," said graduate senator
elect Alane Murdock. A Platform
member, she said her party "cannot
do things completely on its own."
"It requires the Platform work
ing together with independents,"

said Senate Chair Nawwar Kas
rawi. Disagreeing with Shon, Kas
rawi said he considers the election
results a mandate to the Platform.
"Students are putting their trust
in our hands," he said.
Aiding the Alliance's minority
cause may be graduate incumbents
who this year typically voted
against the Platform.
"We have no 1 fewer) voting sena
tors this year than we did last year,"
said undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell, who won re-elec
tion to a non-voting position last
week. "Yet (last year) we were still
able to focus the debate, define the
issues and make sure that the
ASSU acted on items of importance
to students. That's always been our
plan and that's still our plan today."
Jon Oram, who along with
Nicole Vazquez, Rich Stolz and
Mike Choo was elected to the COP,
clarified some of the promises that
his "We Deserve Better" slate
made.
Oram firmly stated that "there
will be a Taco Bell on this campus

next year." He also pledged an
ASSU information bank — a
World Wide Web homepage that
students can access via the Inter
net — and a graduate student
handbook, but stopped short of
guaranteeing a student course
review publication. "The COP has
a limited [amount! of time and pri
orities we can do," he said.
The Alliance has also supported
expanding Tresidder, and Vanier
added that senate districting may
prove to be another cooperative
issue.
"We've not given up hope,"
Vanier said. "We're looking ahead
to the future. The members of our
party are young and have much to
contribute to the Stanford commu
nity."
Shen stressed that the Platform
must be wary and concerned with
student perception at all times.
"We can only go down from
here," Shen said. "There are people
who are waiting for us to screw up,
and we're not going to let that hap
pen."
