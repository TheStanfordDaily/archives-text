# Coming home
## New BCSC director stresses education 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
There wasn't much fanfare or hoopla,
but last week Stanford welcomed home one
of its own.
Morris Graves 11, the incoming director
of the Black Community Services Center,
said he is "really excited about coming
home to Stanford," adding that he is as
tounded at how the campus he roamed as a
child has developed into a major research
university.
"I am absolutely amazed at how this
place has grown," said Graves. "A lot of the
buildings that are here now, including the
one we're in now [the Black House], were
not here when I was."
Graves, who grew up in East Palo Alto,

"But I'm going to miss my ties to the
[Houston] campus, my church and my
community. But I'm sure in time I will de
velop new networks and ties," he added.
Graves said he will miss the students at
the University of Houston the most. Call
ing them "his kids," Graves said he has
seen many of them come in as undergradu
ates and go on to obtain graduate degrees.
Graves places great emphasis on the
value of a college education, recalling two
teachers who made a "profound impact" on
his undergraduate career.
The first was an English professor who
intimidated Graves because she demanded
that her students read one book a week and
write a review on it. Graves tried to drop
