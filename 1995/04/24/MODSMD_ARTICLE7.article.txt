# Coming home
## New BCSC director stresses education 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
There wasn't much fanfare or hoopla,
but last week Stanford welcomed home one
of its own.
Morris Graves 11, the incoming director
of the Black Community Services Center,
said he is "really excited about coming
home to Stanford," adding that he is as
tounded at how the campus he roamed as a
child has developed into a major research
university.
"I am absolutely amazed at how this
place has grown," said Graves. "A lot of the
buildings that are here now, including the
one we're in now [the Black House], were
not here when I was."
Graves, who grew up in East Palo Alto,
left the area as a teenager to earn his bach
elor's degree from Pfizer College in south
ern California. Both his parents had con
nections to Stanford and the local commu
nity: his mother worked at the Stanford
Medical Center, and his father for Hewlett
Packard.
In addition, Graves said he is pleased to
see how the student body has changed.
"What struck me first when I came on

campus was how diverse the campus had
become," said Graves. "I used to bike
around campus as a kid and saw few stu
dents of color."
Graves said he has mixed emotions
about leaving his post at the University of
Houston, where he served as director of the
Urban Experience Program for 14 years.
"Looking at it from a professional point
of view, this (job at Stanford] definitely
doesn't hurt the resum6," said Graves.
"But I'm going to miss my ties to the
[Houston] campus, my church and my
community. But I'm sure in time I will de
velop new networks and ties," he added.
Graves said he will miss the students at
the University of Houston the most. Call
ing them "his kids," Graves said he has
seen many of them come in as undergradu
ates and go on to obtain graduate degrees.
Graves places great emphasis on the
value of a college education, recalling two
teachers who made a "profound impact" on
his undergraduate career.
The first was an English professor who
intimidated Graves because she demanded
that her students read one book a week and
write a review on it. Graves tried to drop
the class but the instructor
would not permit it.
"Dr. Ida Robinson said that
she'd be damned if she would let
me drop that class. On that cam
pus, there were maybe 17 African
Americans out of 5,000 under
graduates. She had two of us in
there and she was not going to let
me out," Graves said.
"And then there was Lucian
Marquis . . . that guy worked my
butt off," Graves added. "After I
handed in my first paper to him,
he gave it back to me and said I
was incapable of writing. He
made me write draft after draft
until I got it right," he said.
Graves said he carries on the
fervor for education and concern
for students he learned from
those two professors in his own
management style.
"I have always maintained an
open-door policy. There have
been students who have called
me up at one in the morning to
talk over their problems," said
Graves. "Paperwork can wait,
but I have an obligation to the
student, a responsibility to the
young people to be a positive role

model."
While Graves called himself a
team player, he added that he is
not afraid to exercise his own
judgment in controversial situa
tions.
"While I am an advocate for

the student and I am a consen
sus player, I will not hesitate to
admonish students for conduct
I and the community deem
inappropriate. . . . Students
may not always be right," he
said.
