The headlines could have read

card games.
But Zak Dolan, a Stanford
engineering graduate student,
decided he needed to play at the
1994 World Championship of
Magic: The Gathering and
nothing was going to prevent
that — not the drive from Mis
souri to Wisconsin, not losing
the first gear, fourth gear and
reverse on his car and not hav
ing to sleep in his car because all
the hotels were full.
And so it was that Dolan
journeyed and ultimately
emerged at the top of a 512-per
son heap at the August Duelists'
Convention, defeating Lestree

trophy and his column.
Magic is a two-player card game
in which the opponents represent
sorcerers battling each other with
spells, monsters and artifacts —
represented by the cards — for
rule over the land of Dominia.
Players create their own decks
of cards, often buying or trading
for the ones they want, since cards
are packed randomly. Every card
belongs to a certain color, which
has a certain power trait. For
example, black is the color of Pesti
lence, the magic of death which
draws its power from swamps and
bogß.
For now, Dolan's future in
Magic is uncertain. Although he
still plays, he has not competed in
any tournaments recently because
"after winning the World Champi
onship, what do you do?"
Dolan said he has not decided
whether or not he will play in the
world tournament again. "But if
somebody flies me out, 1 probably
will do it,"he added.
Dolan also plans to concentrate
on his studies, which occasionally
suffer from neglect in the name of
Magic. He will continue writing
columns for The Duelist and The
Duelist Companion, endorse soft
ware for Bard's Quest's Daemon
Decks — designing sample decks
and analyzing their strengths and
weaknesses — contribute to a
Magic Tips hotline and write a for
ward to Mastering Magics Cards
II: Deep Magic.
Dolan first acquainted himself
with the game in 1992, when a
friend suggested he try it, and was
attracted to the multi-faceted
aspects of the game. "I liked the
strategy, tactics, variety and color
ful pictures right off," he said,
adding that it has the "trading of
Monopoly, the collection of base
ball cards, the fantasy of Dungeons
& Dragons and the strategies of
bridge or poker."
Dolan said he considers himself
a good negotiator. He learned his
trading style from working as a
negotiator for General Electric,

using strategies and tactics from
chess and playing Monopoly. "I
went a long time without losing,
though it was my mother who
finally beat me."
He also has a trading advantage
because, he said, he knows the val
ues of hundreds of cards. Dolan
has bought about $9,000 and sold
about $11,000 in cards and cur
rently owns 10,000-15,000 cards,
all stored and filed meticulously in
folders and boxes, and most of
which he said he will ultimately
trade.
But acquiring the desired cards
is only part of the game. Each play
er has a distinct playing style and
must create a deck that is compat
ible and effective, which may take
a long time. "It was mostly trial
and error," Dolan said.
He has now created eight differ
ent existing decks. Some are for
league play, one for tournaments,
most for fun. He even has a deck
printed in Italian, for variety.
Many players like a quick kill,
but Dolan said he prefers the oppo
site. "It's possible to make a quick
kill with my decks but they're set
up to torture the opponent and
control the entire game," Dolan
explained.
Because of the analytic, strate
gic nature of the game, Magic
tends to attract college students
and engineers, like Dolan. "I love a
challenge," he emphasized.
Dolan is not aione. Magic is a
phenomenon all over Stanford. A
group meets Saturday nights in
the outside study rooms at Meyer
Library for pick-up games and stu
dents can play by logging on to the
Internet.
But his life is not consumed by
Magic, Dolan claimed. He plays left
prop on the Stanford rugby team
and enjoys reading fantasy and
occasional horror stories. He con
tinues to write articles and is con
sidering expanding his genre.
Dolan said he does not see himself
as the stereotypical fantasy / sci
ence-fiction game addict, despite
being able to find a Lure card in
less than 15 seconds from his huge
collection.
"I get tired sometimes and take
a break," Dolan claimed. "As for
spending habits, I wouldn't call
$2,000 a head out of control."
