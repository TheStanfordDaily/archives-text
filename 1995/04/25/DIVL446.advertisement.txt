An imminent plague
I would very much like to
know what the University is
planning to do about the
mosquitoes which are going
to very soon infest Lake Lag
as there are a number of peo
ple who live right by the Lake
and are already starting to get
bitten. Are they going to
dump thousands of pounds of
bug spray and chemicals on
the Lake or get those little
mosquito-eating fish or they
just going to do nothing at all?
Fire The Daily's staff
I feel the ASSU coverage
by the two reporters from the
Stanford Daily is extremely
biased. It obviously shows
that they are trying to take
over not only the ASSU but
the University as well. Things
definitely need to be changed
at The Daily. All the editors
need to be kicked out, all the
writers need to be kicked out,
and the staff of the Stanford
Chaparral needs to be put in
their place.
Bedtime for bozos
I was just informed that
the Very Serious Clowns slate
did not win the COP elec
tions. Because of this, I've
decided to drop out of school.
I hope you're all happy.
