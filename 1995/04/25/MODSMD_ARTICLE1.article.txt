# Bid day
## Frats rush to reel in new members 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
In a year when filling quotas
and meeting housing require
ments is especially critical to fra
ternities, fewer men took part in
Rush, which ended Sunday. Early
yesterday morning fraternities
submitted their bids to the Office
of Student Affairs.
Due to a new policy, fraterni
ties are now required to fill 90
percent of their house with mem
bers in order to keep it.
This year it is estimated that
only 269 people rushed, down
from last year when more than
300 men took part in the process,
according to Nanci Howe, direc
tor of student activities. Howe
would not release the number of
students who received bids.
Prospective members have
until Friday to decide whether or
not they will accept a bid. Al
though pledge classes have not
been finalized, most Rush chairs
said they are confident that they
will meet the 90 percent quota.
Some fraternities, such as
Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta Pi,
are more concerned about mem
bership since they will lose many
members to graduation this
June. KA President Adam Nash
refused to comment about the fu
ture of his house.
Senior Dan Fox, president of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said SAE
has not had a problem filling their
house. "We have never taken a
single boarder," he said.
According to fraternity repre
sentatives, 26 bids were distrib
uted by both Theta Delta Chi and
Sigma Chi; 24 bids by Phi Delta
Theta; 22 bids by SAE; 16 by
Lambda Phi Epsilon and Delta
Kappa Epsilon; 15 by Delta Ep
silon; and 10 bids by Zeta Psi. The
co-ed Alpha Delta Phi, which
rushed with fraternities, gave out
69 bids. Other fraternities' repre
sentatives were not available or
would not release the number of
bids their organization offered.
Because the Rush process is
only two weeks long, some frater
nity members feel that prospec
tive members do not have enough
time to get a complete under
standing of fraternity life. Jon
Deane, Rush chair of Kappa
Sigma, said rushees ought to
observe fraternities during meal
times and other informal gather
ings in order to get a feel for the
house.
Deke Rush Chair Mark Gesell
said that the dynamics of Rush

make the process work. "Out of
all the craziness it is a pretty effi
cient process," he said. "People
end up where they belong."
For many freshmen the Rush
process is not so natural. "In
deciding to accept a bid you have
to look at the guys in the fraterni
ty and see whether or not you
want to be a part of them and
what they stand for," said fresh
man Jonathan Pappasideris. "You
also have to look at the pledge
class because they will be the peo
ple you bond the most with."
Questions about alcohol, food
service and housing are frequent
ly posed by prospective members.

The academic and social environ
ment of the house is usually of
primary importance to rushees.
Some freshmen choose
unhoused fraternities to gain an
extended group of friends without
sacrificing their freshmen peers.
"I enjoy the University hous
ing," said freshman Wallace
White. "I like to come down to
dinner and see somebody differ
ent each day."
Freshman Frank Tsai had a
more explicit reason for avoiding
housed fraternities: "I didn't like
housed fraternities because they
smell like warm beer and
cigarettes."
