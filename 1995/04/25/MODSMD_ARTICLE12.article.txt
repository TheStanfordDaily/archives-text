# New Web election software encouraged undergrad voting

### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Elections Commissioner Jonathan Berent praised
the new World Wide Web voting system and said it
had a positive effect on undergraduate voter
turnout.
The Web voting system, inaugurated during the
January special election for the Balanced Funding
Deal but given its first real test during last week's
Spring General Election, allowed voters to view
biographies of candidates and information about
student groups seeking a special fee.
"The change to the World Wide Web was perhaps
the best thing we did this year," Berent said. "It was
very user-friendly."
Previous election polling methods have included
HyperCard and Unix.
While total voter turnout was 36 percent, a figure
similar to previous years, 54 percent of undergradu-

ates voted, up from last year.
"There were complaints last year it was difficult
and took too much time," Berent said. "This year we
wanted to make it as simple as possible. Pointing
and clicking seemed to be as easy as it gets."
He said a decrease in graduate voter turnout was
not representative of the voting system. Only 20 per
cent of graduate students voted in the election.
"Last year they had a vested interest voting
against the reform movements that were proposed,"
Berent said, referring to the efforts of the Graduate
Student Tea Party, in which graduate students
organized and refunded special fees to protest pay
ing for services they did not feel they used.
In addition, Berent said the Web system allowed
the Elections Commission to announce results more
quickly. Less than four minutes after polls closed,
Berent already had preliminary results. The only
constraint, he said, was the time it took him to write
down the results.
