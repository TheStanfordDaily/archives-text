## Second bomber still at large FBI search continues as family, friends bury the dead 
### 
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - On
a day when the White House sug
gested the death toll could sur
pass 200, a tiny victim of the fed
eral building bombing was buried
amid hearts and teddy bears. And
the search for her murderers
pressed on.
One-year-old Baylee Almon —
the infant who, photographed in a
fireman's arms, broke hearts
around the world — was the first
of the 80 victims recovered so far
to be laid to rest. "Baylee is in
God's hands," the Rev. Charles
McDade said at her funeral yes
terday.
As suspect Timothy McVeigh
sat in jail, his lawyers sought to
pull out of the case. One of the
lawyers said he doubted anyone in
Oklahoma City could give him a
fair hearing.
Rescuers working as darkness
fell located perhaps eight more
bodies, said Assistant Fire Chief
Jon Hansen. But he estimated
rescuers would have to remove
about 300 tons of debris to free
them.
The hunt for a so-far-unidenti
fied second suspect remained
investigators' top focus. The FBI
said an Army deserter questioned
Sunday had no part in the attack,
then continued to follow leads
across the country. As debris was

hauled out by searchers, agents
combed it for clues.
Searchers once again failed to
reach the day care and Social
Security areas of the building.
They used chainsaws and jack
hammers to whittle away at a
three-story high pile of rubble
pancaked on those areas, but said
they wouldn't get there until
today.
Reporters allowed inside for
the first time saw search dogs gin
gerly creeping and helmeted
workers crawling into spaces
braced with four-by-fours like a
mineshaft.
White House chief of staff Leon
Panetta said the death toll could
rise above 200.
Several funerals and memorial
services were held yesterday. At
one funeral, the three children of
Lola Bolden, a 40-year-old Army
sergeant, wept in a small chapel
where Maj. Ronald Bain, who
worked with her, eulogized: "She
takes with her a part of our bat
talion."
While Weldon Kennedy, the
agent leading the FBl's investiga
tion, reported swift progress with
a probe ranging "literally
throughout the United States,"
major puzzle pieces were still
missing — including the second of
two men pictured in FBI sketches

last week.
John W. Coyle 111 and Susan
Otto, McVeigh's court-appointed
lawyers, filed a request to with
draw from representing McVeigh.
Coyle said his family had received
threats and — with a golfing
buddy dead and other friends
missing — he couldn't dispassion
ately represent McVeigh.
Coyle said McVeigh, 27, had
not talked with investigators, but
wouldn't say why not. "Every cit
izen is entitled not to," Coyle said.
Spc. 4 David Iniguez, 23, an
Army deserter from Fort Riley,
Kan., was released to military
custody. The FBI questioned him
for hours Sunday in Los Angeles
but Kennedy said agents had con
cluded he was not involved in the
case.
Brothers Terry Lynn Nichols,
40, and James Douglas Nichols,
41, were held as material witness
es but not charged. Court appear
ances were scheduled today in
Michigan for James and tomor
row in Kansas for Terry. The
brothers are said to share far
right political views with
McVeigh.
In a speech yesterday, Presi
dent Clinton, repeating a theme
he sounded Sunday after an emo
tional memorial service here,
denounced "the purveyors of

hatred and division, the promot
ers of paranoia." He is seeking
broad new powers to combat ter
rorism.
In Congress, Republicans and
Democrats agreed new anti-ter
rorism legislation is needed.
Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
set a hearing Thursday on ways to

stop terrorism. With Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole, he
plans to introduce a measure com
bining features of a crime bill they
offered earlier this year, an
administration anti-terrorism bill
and proposals Clinton made Sun
day night.
House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt proposed leg

islation that would increase
funding for bombing recovery
efforts in Oklahoma City and
would also give law enforcement
officials more authority to inves
tigate suspected terrorists. In
addition, it would ensure that
the death penalty applies to crim
inals responsible for acts of ter
rorism.

shore up dangerous sections of the collapsed floors. Authorities estimate over 150 people are still
missing.
