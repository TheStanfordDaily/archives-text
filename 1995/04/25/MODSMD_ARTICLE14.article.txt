Chrysler buyout refused
DETROIT (AP) - Chrysler Corp.'s
board of directors formally rejected
Kirk Kerkorian's unsolicited buyout
proposal yesterday and questioned his
ability to raise the money to pay for it.
A board statement said the vote was
unanimous and came after a "thorough
and careful review" of the $55-a-share
proposal made by Kerkorian's Tracinda
Corp. on April 12.
Chrysler made it clear on the day
Kerkorian made the offer that the com
pany wasn't for sale.
If successful, the $22.8 billion deal
would be the second-biggest takeover of
all time behind the $25 billion acquisi
tion of RJR Nabisco by New York
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. in 1989.
Kerkorian is working with former
Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca and has
said he would take $5.5 billion of
Chrysler's $7.3 billion cash reserve to
help finance the purchase.
"Your representatives have said that
you are willing to bet your stake in
Chrysler on such a transaction. Our
directors do not have any interest in
gambling with Chrysler's future,"
Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton
said yesterday in a letter to Kerkorian.

At $55 a share, Kerkorian's 10 per
cent stake would be worth $2 billion.
lacocca would put up $50 million in
stock. Other investors, still to be
recruited, would supply about $3 billion
and Kerkorian would borrow the rest.
Eaton said the refinancing of other
Chrysler debt would require additional
borrowing and the deal ultimately
would cost more than $30 billion.
"Not a single non-Chrysler dollar of
that financing . . . has been lined up,"
Eaton said. "We have grave doubts that
such a financing is feasible.. .. Even if
this immense financing could be accom
plished, the result would be a crippled
company."
Rwandan standoff
KIBEHO, Rwanda (AP) - About
600 refugee holdouts from Rwanda's
latest cycle of horror barricaded them
selves yesterday inside a school strewn
with mangled bodies, facing down army
troops who pointed recoilless rifles and
demanded they come out.
The refugees refused to join 100,000
terrified people trudging through
ankle-deep mud away from the slaugh
ter at the Kibeho camp, closed down by
Rwandan troops in a chaotic, bloody
weekend operation that left at least

2,000 dead from gunfire and stam
pedes.
A report by Human Rights Watch-
Africa acknowledged there were just
200 U.N. troops, too few to confront the
2,000 Rwandan soldiers at Kibeho. But
it said the U.N. force failed to anticipate
the threat posed by the Rwandan army
buildup and didn't call in more U.N.
troops.
After initially saying as many as
5,000 people had been killed, the U.N.
Assistance Mission reduced its estimate
Sunday to "a more scientific count" of
about 2,000 dead and 600 hurt.
About 20 U.N. medical corpsmen,
guarded by 20 U.N. soldiers with auto
matic rifles — some with bayonets
attached — moved onto the school
grounds yesterday to evacuate the
wounded.
Many of the people there apparently
were hard-line Hutus who have the
most to fear from the Tutsi-led army for
the slaughter last year of some 500,000
Rwandans, most of them Tutsis.
A team from Doctors Without Bor
ders arrived yesterday morning in
Kibeho with medical supplies, but sol
diers threatened to bomb their field
hospital if they went inside, said Joelle
Tanguy, executive director of the
group's American branch.
