# Sacramento mail bomb

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - A mail
bomb exploded inside the offices of a tim
ber industry lobbying group yesterday,
blowing out windows and doors. The
employee who opened it was killed.
No one claimed responsibility for the
bombing at the California Forestry Asso
ciation office four blocks from the Capitol
but the FBI was trying to determine if it
might be connected to the Unabom case,
in which a serial bomber has killed two
people and injured 23 over the past 17
years.
An executive with the California
Forestry Association said he suspected
the bombing was the work of environ
mental terrorists.
Several of the Unabom victims have
been in Northern California, including a
Sacramento computer store owner who
was killed outside his business in 1987.
"We're obviously investigating to see
if there is any connection with our
Unabom suspect," said FBI spokesman
Bob Griego in San Francisco.
Police Chief Arturo Venegas said
there was no indication the bombing was
connected to last week's blast at the
Oklahoma City federal building.
The small, heavy package was deliv
ered to the California Forestry Associa
tion in the day's mail, said police
spokesman Michael Heenan. It exploded
just after 2 p.m. when a male employee
tried to open it.
"It blew doors out. It blew windows

out. There is a lot of debris in the hall
way. There are doors laying in the hall
way. There is a lot of glass and ceiling
tiles on the floor," said Fire Department
Division Chief Jan Dunbar.
Gov. Pete Wilson condemned the
bombing as "a barbaric act of cowardice."
No warning was sent to the associa
tion before the package arrived wrapped
in brown paper and about the size of a
shoebox, Heenan said.
The California Forestry Association is
a nonprofit trade group representing
wood products companies and commer
cial forest landowners. In 1993, it filed a
petition seeking to remove the northern
spotted owl from the federal endangered
species list.
"In my personal opinion, this is the
work of extreme environmentalists, not
linked to Oklahoma," said Donn Zea, the
association's vice president for industry
affairs.
He speculated that the bomber might
have confused the association with a gov
ernment agency, a mistake that fre
quently occurs.
Judi Bari, an activist with Earth First!
who was injured in a car bombing in Oak
land in 1990, said she was "horrified" at
the bombing and denied any connection
with her organization.
"Having been the recipient of that
kind of terror, I can't imagine anybody
doing that to another human being," she
said.
