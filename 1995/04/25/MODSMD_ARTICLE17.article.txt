## Editorials Nonspecific budgets 
### 
FOR THE MOST part, the
ASSU Elections Commission
did an admirable job of design
ing a readable, easy-to-use elections
handbook with each of the candi
dates, slates and special fee groups
listed. The step-by-step instructions
for obtaining Netscape and voting
from campus network computers
were also very well done.
Nonetheless, while talking to
representatives of student groups
that were applying for special fees,
we discovered serious problems in
the new type of budgets that the
groups were asked to submit. Gone
were the old line-item budgets that
listed exactly what the money
would be spent on. You could not
look at a program proposed by a
group and get a breakdown of how
much of the event expense went to
food, how much to publicity, how
much to speaker's fees.
Instead, the handbook listed con
glomerated annual budgets for
broad categories like salaries, pub
licity, literature, food and — our

favorite — miscellaneous. Too
often, groups lumped huge
amounts of money under miscella
neous simply because there was no
standard category that pertained to
their unique service. For example,
the Black Student Union listed
$2,300, or 10 percent of its request,
under miscellaneous. Trying to
compare how efficiently a group is
using its money is very difficult for
students to evaluate when they
can't see how the money is being
used.
This problem was not universal,
however. The ASSU Speakers
Bureau had very specific listings of
its unique expenses, like hotel and
meal costs for speakers. Apparently,
the formats of the budgets were not
strict, and there could have been
more information provided for
obscure budgets of other groups.
Next year, the commission should
provide better guidance to groups to
make their budgets more specific —
or it should return to the old sys
tem.
