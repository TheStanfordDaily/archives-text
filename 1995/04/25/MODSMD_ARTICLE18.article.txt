# Computerized voting

### 
EXCUSE THE skepticism, but
we were wary about how
effective the World Wide Web
voting system for this year's ASSU
election would be. After all, for sev
eral years the ASSU has been try
ing various new computer-voting
methods which have all tended to
fall short of expectations.
Are we glad we were wrong. The
Web-based system — the method
was first used in January's Bal
anced Funding Deal special elec
tion — did yeoman's service this
year, meeting all expectations.
Most impressively, the system
was able to tabulate two days
worth of votes — nearly 5,000 bal
lots — in only three-and-a-half
minutes. Elections Commissioner
Jonathan Berent said that the only
thing slowing down the announce
ment of results was how fast he
could write the figures down. After
many late election nights in the
ASSU offices, this was certainly a

welcome change.
The new system is also friendly
and relatively painless. Using
point-and-click simplicity instead
of a text-based system, it didn't
take a master's in computer sci
ence to figure out the ballot. All
undergraduate residences on cam
pus have machines that can access
the Web, and all undergraduate
classes increased their voter
turnout. Paper ballots were still
kindly provided for those who feel
more comfortable off-line — about
180 people this year.
Nice, too, was the option of click
ing on a candidate's name to see his
or her platform statement. This
allowed voters to make more
informed choices.
In short, the system worked well
overall. The ASSU electioneers,
and the folks at Residential Com
puting and Sweet Hall who helped
out, should take pride in a job well
done.
