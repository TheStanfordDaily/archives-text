## Take advantage of Her story 
### 
LET'S TALK FEMINISM. Yeah, I'm
referring to Women's Herstory Cele
bration, which is going on as you
read this column. As a Daily columnist,
I'm exploiting my space to plug something
that I believe in. For Sean Kennedy it was
heroin, for me it's gender equity.
Don't stop reading. I know that the
events for Herstory have almost come to a
close, but due to extenuating circum
stances, I couldn't talk about it until now.
So listen up and give it a chance. I'm here
to dispel a few rumors and inform you of
what's going on during this celebration.
On one level, there's the issue of femi
nism on campus. For a politically and
socially liberal campus, our feminist con
tingent is pretty low-key. Over my four
years here, I haven't seen any public
protests run by the Women's Center, nor
have I seen the women who usually hang
out there engage in men-bashing. In fact,
you might be surprised to hear that there
are men who are staff members of the
Women's Center as well.
So what does the Women's Center
actually do? A difficult question for the
Women's Collective to answer. Like the
ethnic centers and the LGBCC, the
Women's Center has tried over the years
to appeal to a broad audience, one that is
not limited to the communities for which
it was originally developed. I'd like to
think that the Women's Center serves
the entire Stanford community by creat
ing a space and a forum for the discus

sion of gender issues that affect every
body affiliated with Stanford, not just
women.
Yeah, right. Unfortunately, that day
has not yet hit this university. Most Stan
ford students have never actually been in
the Women's Center, unless perhaps thev
live on west campus and therefore go to Ye
Olde Safer Sex Shoppe instead of Cowell. I
don't blame you. It's not a very exciting
place. And you know, all of those femi
nists, you have to keep your distance. You
might get sucked into a discussion about
increasing the Women's Center's out
reach to frosh, Stanford's sexual harass
ment policy, or something equally fright
ening.
Oh wait, back to the subject. The Her
story Celebration. Here's an opportunity
for you to see the grand product of the time
and energy of the Women's Collective, its
member groups and the organizations that
are housed in the Women's Center. Believe
it or not, this includes a number of sorori
ties, the Graduate Women's Network,
Stanford Women Engineers and a variety
of other organizations.
Hey, you're the ones who voted thou
sands of dollars for the Women's Collec
tive. Why not use this as an opportunity to
see what it is that you are going to pay for
next year?
Besides checking up on your monetary
investments, there are a variety of other
reasons for attending one or two of the
Herstory events. For one, you are joining

in a discourse about issues that affect pret
ty much every man and woman at Stan
ford, regardless of political or social affilia
tion. The issue being discussed might h**
"Challenges of Women's Health," a topic
which might seem distant from you, but in
the end, it is we and the people that we love
who are affected by these topics.
Perhaps even more important, you
would be making good use of a resource
that will not be available to you forever.
Things like Herstory Celebration are few
and far between in the real world. Most
people outside of college campuses do not
have high-profile speakers coming into
their homes and classrooms to discuss
issues of feminism.
Lately, through my growing introspec
tion over my impending departure from
Stanford, I've realized what a unique
opportunity we're all offered at this uni
versity. We are constantly offered pro
grams and events that are interesting,
educational, sometimes controversial,
truly accessible and, best of all, free. So
take advantage of the situation and see for
yourself what the Women's Collective real
ly does.

This year's award for Most Empowered
Woman definitively, without a doubt, goes
to Ms. Lu-leng Chua. Congratulations,
Lu!
