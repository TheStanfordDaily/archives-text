# Students left Dr. Elders' speech because she was not worth listening to
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Greg
Martellotto's letter of April 24, in
which he chastises the student body
for inappropriate behavior during the
recent talk by Dr. Joycelyn Elders. He
complains that the audience insuffi
ciently appreciated her insights, left
early and challenged her views. As one
who attended Dr. Elders' talk (and
indeed left early), I'd like to respond to
some of his points.

First, Martellotto argues that the
lack of enthusiasm shown by the
crowd evidences a disrespect for Dr.
Elders and for the many fine insights
that she offered. I was disappointed by
her talk, and I feel that my response
(leaving early) was appropriate. Like
most students, I became aware of Dr.
Elders through her outrageous quota
tions that periodically surfaced in the
headlines. I hoped that she would add
some substance to her views and deliv
er the thoughtful analysis that sound
bites can't convey. Instead, her speech
was a collection of these sound bites,
including such gems as, "God teaches
children how to masturbate." Realiz
ing that the thoughtful analysis would

not be forthcoming, I left. Very few
public figures are worth listening to
when they have nothing interesting to
say. Dr. Elders is not one of them.
Second, Martellotto misunderstands,
as I initially did, the role that Dr.
Elders performs. She came to Stanford
(and most probably to her former
office) to provoke and proclaim, not to
analyze and discuss. She performs this
role well, pleasing her supporters and
antagonizing her detractors. It is
understandable, and indeed expected,
that she would provoke certain mem
bers of the audience, who would then
take issue with her comments and dis
agree with her. Had I stuck around, I
would have probably done the same.

Criticizing the audience whom she pro
voked is not only silly, but it misunder
stands her role as a public figure.
I'm confused as to why Martellotto
is so offended by an audience that, by
his account, gave her a standing ova
tion. Furthermore, his characteriza
tion of Dr. Elders as "southern-bred"
and therefore "more sensitive to eti
quette" is strikingly at odds with the
candor and rejection of convention on
which she has built her fame. It's bad
enough that Dr. Elders gave a disap
pointing speech. Do we really have to
be harangued by Greg Martellotto as
well?
