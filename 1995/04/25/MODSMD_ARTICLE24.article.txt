## What is the proper role of government in society? Government intervention is here to stay 
### Martin Carnoy 
Government interven
tion in our economic lives
is here to stay. The simple
reason: Despite all their com
plaints, the vast majority of citi
zens demand it. When tainted
Jack-In-The-Box meat kills
some children in Washington, or
an oil tanker spills oil in Alaska,
or companies move their plants
to Asia, there are immediate
calls for government help. Fact
is, when anything goes wrong,
citizens want their government
to set it right.
This makes perfect sense. In
democracies, government ideal
ly represents citizens' collective
will. Part of that will is to create
a society that works for the ben
efit of the citizenry at large.
Most of the history of this cen
tury has been about the possibil
ities and limits of what govern
ment can and cannot accomplish
in creating that desired society.
The revolutions in Russia and
China, the New Deal in the
United States and various forms
of social democracy in Europe,
were all attempts to make gov
ernment more responsible for
citizens' welfare. That some of
the attempts failed meant both
that government cannot do
everything and that conditions
in the world economy changed
drastically, making the old
forms of government interven
tion inappropriate. But the
attempts also showed that gov
ernment is capable of doing a lot
of equalizing the distribution of
income, of promoting the cre
ation of new technology, and of
building vast infrastructures of
education, transportation and
other services that contribute to
higher productivity and social
well-being.
Under new global economic
conditions, government plays a
new role in managing economic
development. In Japan and the
four or five Asian "tigers," it is
crucial to those societies' rapid
growth. Government "steers"
development through close ties
with private industry and by
providing strong incentives for
some economic sectors and con
straints on others. It also makes
strategic decisions about how
much to promote exports, how
much to allow the growth of
domestic consumption versus
domestic savings, and how much
and where to invest in research
and development, education and
infrastructure. Even the free
market-oriented World Bank

Study in the Behavioral Sci
ences.

now agrees that a well-orga
nized, "interventionist" govern
ment can be a key factor in pro
moting and sustaining high
rates of economic growth.
For the United States, the
problem is somewhat different.
Having achieved a high stan
dard of living, we are wondering
less how to get competitive and
more how to stay competitive.
We are also a diverse, immigrant
society with a national culture

'When government
intervenes ... it Is cor
recting the gross
social inefficiencies of
the free market.'

that glorifies individuality and
self rather than collectivity and
cooperation. Here, more than in
most countries, our culture
makes it easy to forget that indi
vidual possibilities today are as
much defined by the nature of
government intervention over
the past two generations as they
are by our individual effort. At
the same time, we continue to be
terribly concerned about collec
tive problems, such as the envi
ronment, health care, educa
tion, racial and gender inequali
ty, and who we are as a nation in
the new global information age.
And we continue to expect gov
ernment to do something about
these issues.
Those who argue for reducing
the government's role claim
that its inherent inefficiency is
dragging us down economically,
and that it simply cannot solve
problems of inequality, environ

ment and education without
treading heavily on our much
more precious individual rights.
But there is little evidence that
on the whole this is true. Gov
ernment is often "inefficient,"
but it is also doing things that
the private sector would not
touch, or when it does, often
does less efficiently. Check the
prices of state-run auto insur
ance plans versus private sector
insurance, for example, or the
Edison Project's inability to
launch a national chain of pri
vate schools that would cost the
same per student as the Palo
Alto school district now spends.
And when government inter
venes in smog control, or clean
ing up the water, or reducing
race and gender discrimination
in labor markets, it is correcting
the gross social inefficiencies of
free market behavior.
As far as individual rights go,
it is very important to be wary of
governments, but it is just as
important to be wary of private
enterprises using their enor
mous economic power to influ
ence or even prevent the exercise
of individual rights. Think about
the tobacco, small arms and
insurance industries as three
examples of businesses success
fully shaping individual health
choices in the face of quite dif
ferent majority preferences.
THAT SAID, the citizenry
in developed countries is
right to demand that gov
ernment do a lot better than it
has in the last 20 years. Faced
by a whole new set of conditions
in the global economy, govern
ments have either not adjusted,
or, as in the United States, have
adjusted by allowing an
increased share of national out
put to go to corporate profits

and the top one percent of
income earners â€” this in the
name of "getting the govern
ment off people's backs." No
wonder that people are dissatis
fied, and that they trust govern
ment less and less to deliver the
goods.
But taking government out of
the picture will simply exacer
bate this dissatisfaction. Wages
after taxes could rise in the
short-run, but a whole block of
social services that people have
taken for granted, including
public college education, health
care, social security and police
and fire protection would either
have to be paid for privately or
would deteriorate markedly.
Government would also have to
cut infrastructure investment
and its support of research and
development. In the not-so-long
run, this could have a serious
impact on productivity. And nei
ther is there any evidence that
once taxes were reduced, after
tax wages would continue to
rise. Remember, the same team
arguing for a reduced govern
ment role in the economy is also
pushing for holding down
wages, for hiring replacement
workers in strikes and for reduc
ing health and safety standards
on the job. Welcome to the brave
new world of the 19205. Once
they understand what it's
about, Americans won't buy it.
The concept of "reinventing"
rather than eliminating govern
ment's economic role is a right
way to go. We need greater effi
ciency in government programs
and need to pare many down.
However, unless government
also represents the interests of
the vast middle class against the
powerful claims of a tiny percent
of wealthy economic "winners,"
efficiency will not mean much.
