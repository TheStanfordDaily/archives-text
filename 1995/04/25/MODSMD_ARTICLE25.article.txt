# The 						public sector has a long record of failure

### Bill Evers 
Economists and political
scientists traditionally speak
of the minimal functions of
government as national defense,
police protection, adjudicating dis
putes and protecting against over
all pollution of the human environ
ment.
Even these activities are not
carried out solely by government:
People join neighborhood-watch
groups and companies hire securi
ty guards. People seek to reduce
social disorder through ostracism
and social pressure. Companies in
contractual disputes sometimes
settle them through private arbi
tration. Private groups like the
Nature Conservancy and the
Audubon Society buy land to pre
serve wildlife for human enjoy
ment. Just because something has
historically been done by govern
ments doesn't mean it should be or
will be in the future.
Of course, local, state, and
national governments do much
more than these traditional mini
mal functions. Most of these addi
tional activities the government
doesn't perform well. A few years
ago, I read an article in the New
York Times that sought to give
examples of successful government
programs. It listed only three:
Head Start, the public school sys
tem and Social Security.
When I read this article, I
thought to myself: This is a pretty
thin record of success with which
to justify the hundreds of billions
of dollars spent on welfare-state
and regulatory programs — pro
grams which go beyond the tradi
tional minimal functions of gov
ernment.
Let's look at the record. The
gains of children enrolled in Head
Start vanish after a few years. I
count this program a failure. Social
Security is prospectively bankrupt
— scheduled to fail. Public schools
are a moderate success in the afflu
ent suburbs; they fail miserably in
the cities. Children of the same
socioeconomic background show
greater scholastic achievement in
Catholic schools than in public
schools.
Why do governments try to do
much more than their traditionally
minimal functions? Because once
you have in place a coercive mecha
nism that is recognized as legiti
mate and that can collect taxes and
give orders that have to be obeyed,
people will try to bend it to their
own purposes, whether self-serv
ing or ideological.
Wealthy yacht owners will try to
get Coast Guard help without pay
ing the full cost. Badly-managed
companies like Lockheed and
Chrysler will try to get bailouts.
Ranchers will tiy to get use of graz
ing land at below-market prices.

Bill Evers is a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution.

Farmers will try to get subsidized
water. Auto-makers and steel
makers will try to get protection
from competition from abroad.
Campers, hikers, and nature
lovers will try to get those with
other priorities to pay for more
parks.
Under these circumstances,
government bureaucrats are only
too happy to expand their budgets
and increase the jurisdiction of
their agencies. Politicians are like
wise glad to satisfy special interest
groups who will help them get re
elected.
Politicians often say that things
the government does that are
beyond the traditional minimal
functions promote equality. But I
don't believe it. The facts show
that despite a myriad of new "anti
poverty" programs since the New
Deal, the distribution of income in
the United States has remained
virtually unchanged. Anti-poverty
talk in American politics is mostly
justifying rhetoric for big govern
ment that benefits the wealthy and
well-organized.
The 20th Century's biggest
Utopian experiment in equality —
Soviet Russia — turns out to have
been an edifice of corruption, invid
ious inefficiency and special privi
lege that rested on a foundation of
sacrificed human corpses.
In the face of this record of gov
ernment failure, people basically
have two different responses. One
set of people believe the only effica
cious way to fix society's problems
is to raise taxes, expand the size of
government and spend more
money on government programs.
They think that the only way for
society to thrive is for government
to manage it, in detail. If govern
ment solutions haven't worked so
far, the only answer (according to
government proponents) is more
money and more power in the
hands of government officials, and
more imaginative government pro
grams.
The other set of people see
themselves as defenders of "civil
society," that is, all institutions and
elements outside of government —
namely businesses, charities,
churches, voluntary associations,
families, and individuals. This
other set of people think that given
a civic order of property rights and
civil liberties, civil society will
thrive and flourish on its own.
These critics of big government
say that governments cannot per
form well and should not be expect
ed to. The critics say government
action is largely an arena in which
well-organized interest groups seek
special privileges and subsidies at
the expense of the less-organized.
The solution — say critics of big
government — is: rolling back the
size and scope of government, cut
ting taxes, deregulating to let civil
society flourish on its own, remain
ing profoundly skeptical of pro
posed new government programs
and vigilantly defending our liber
ties against government intrusion.
