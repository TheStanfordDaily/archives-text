# How credible is the current assault on government?
## 
### David B. Abernethy 
THE DOMINANT IDEA in Ameri
can politics since the Republican
electoral victories of last Novem
ber is the claim that government is far
more likely to exacerbate our society's
problems than to solve them. Indeed,
government is perceived by many sup
porters of the "Contract With America"
as being itself one of the country's more
serious problems. The federal govern
ment has been subjected to particularly
withering assault by conservative propo
nents of the Contract. Washington-based
bureaucracies, it is repeatedly charged,
are costly and inefficient, sponsor failed
programs, are distant from and insensi
tive to ordinary people, restrict our free
doms and distort our economic incen
tives through myriad bureaucratic regu
lations — to name only a few items in the
long litany of these agencies' alleged
misdeeds.
Let's assume that there is merit to
each and every one of these charges.
Does it logically follow — as conserva
tives would have us believe — that our
country would be better off if the size,
cost, and regulatory scope of the public
sector were reduced? Not necessarily.
Conservatives need to address several
flaws in their own argument before they
can persuasively link their diagnosis of
the problem (government failure) with
their prescription for a cure (govern
ment shrinkage).
First, they routinely ignore or take for
granted a large number of government
activities that are widely considered ben-

eficial, either to society as a whole or to
the particular constituencies with which
the critics themselves identify. All insti
tutions in the public as well as the pri
vate sector need careful, balanced cost
benefit analyses of their work. But
descriptions of an entire sector that
itemize only its negative features while
neglecting its positive ones are hardly
fair, much less analytically thorough.
Conservatives dismiss radical critics of
the capitalist system for making this
mistake. The conservative cause is not
helped when its adherents fall into pre
cisely the same trap, using criteria for
evaluating the public sector that are just
as one-sided and selective as those
employed by left-wing critics of the pri
vate profit sector.
Second, many of the House Republi
cans' actions during the first hundred
days of the new Congress raise doubts
about the sincerity of their promise to
reduce government. Not surprisingly,
the new holders of political power have
quickly learned that power can be quite
useful when it is they who hold it. An
enormous amount of attention during
those hundred days was focused on
devolving public functions from Wash
ington to the state capitals. But this
"reform" does not by itself limit the
scope of government. Rather, it dispers
es policy responsibilities from one set of
politicians and bureaucrats to other sets
of the same kinds of people. If govern
ment is so inherently flawed, why this
touching faith in the capacity of another
level of government to do a much better
job of problem-solving than Washington?
Lofty rhetoric about devolution aside,
House Republicans are busy using the
federal government for their own redis
tributive purposes. My reading is that
they intend to shift resources and oppor

tunities from cities to suburbs, from the
poor to the holders of property, and from
racial / ethnic minorities to people of
European descent. In order to imple
ment this regressive shift in policy and
cope with its socially disruptive conse
quences, public sector institutions must
be kept strong and adaptable. And in
order to respond to the demands of reli
gious conservatives to regulate personal
behavior and interpersonal relations in
new ways, the capacity of government
agencies to intrude in peoples' private
lives must, if anything, be strengthened.
Liberals need government. But so do

conservatives. For both, public institu
tions and mechanisms — including the
power to tax, spend, and regulate behav
ior — are among the most important
instruments available for moving Ameri
ca's society and economy in directions
the group in power prefers.
A third issue the critics of government
need to address is the powerful tendency
of the public sector in a democracy to
mirror civil society. This means that
many problems people attribute to gov
ernment can ultimately be traced back to
the behavior of ordinary people, acting as
citizens in political life and as private
individuals to attain personal and group
goals through their own actions. Thus,

blame for huge government deficits
should not be shouldered entirely by
glad-handing politicians and greedy
bureaucrats. Surely much of the respon
sibility lies with the electorate, disposed
as we are to favor candidates who in
effect promise us something for nothing.
To take another example, what appears
to be Capitol Hill gridlock on such issues
as abortion and school prayer may be a
direct result of gridlock in the larger soci
ety on these issues. To the extent that
the polity reflects the society, reassigning
tasks from polity to society will not nec
essarily solve a country's problems. In
many situations government becomes a
convenient scapegoat, vulnerable to
attack for shortcomings shared by the
very people who express contempt for it.
I am not arguing that "government
knows best," nor that it is able to solve
our society's problems efficiently and
effectively. Such claims fly in the face of
impressive evidence about the malfunc
tion of all types of public sector institu
tions here and abroad. Conservatives in
particular have accumulated this evi
dence over the years — and very effec
tively communicated it to the American
electorate in 1994. My point is rather that
in the current climate of opinion the pub
lic sector is being subjected to a barrage of
criticism that is one-sided, unfair, hypo
critical, and frequently misdirected. That
the federal government in particular does
a poor job of handling some of our coun
try's most serious, sensitive, and contro
versial problems hardly constitutes proof,
in and of itself, that non-government
actors (to say nothing of state govern
ments) will do better. Supporters of the
"Contract With America" would do well
to show greater humility and uncertainty
when prescribing alternatives to public
sector programs currently in place.
