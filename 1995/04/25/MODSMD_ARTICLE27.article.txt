# Stanford profs' salaries increase
## 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
Being a Stanford professor
remains a relatively lucrative
proposition. The University's
average faculty salaries increased
for the third straight year, keep
ing them high above the national
average.
Professors earn $99,900, asso
ciate professors earn $68,100 and
assistant professors earn
$53,800, according to a study for
the American Association of Uni
versity Professors. These figures
represent contracted salaries
which do not include benefits,
summer teaching, extra loads,
stipends or other forms of remu
neration.
"Stanford salaries, not surpris
ingly, are in the upper 5 percent of
salaries," said Daniel Hamer
mesh, an economics professor at
the University of Texas at Austin
who compiled the survey. Stan
ford faculty salaries are well above
the $56,000 national average for
research universities.
The average doctoral salary for
a professor is $92,940, while at
Stanford professors earn $99,900,
according to Bonnie Gardner,

managing editor of Academe.
"Stanford salaries are ahead of
similar institutions," she said.
Salaries for professors at Stan
ford rose 4.5 percent over last
year; for associate professors, 5.9
percent; and for assistant profes
sors, 6.3 percent.
"Stanford's increases far out
pace the national averages,"
Hamermesh said.
Assoc. Provost Kathy Gillam
said the salary program for next
year has not been announced yet.
But she noted the importance of
having a competitive salary pro
gram in order to recruit and retain
prominent faculty.
"Stanford has great people who
work here and to keep them here,
reward them for their good work
and recruit new people, salaries
are increasing," Gillam said.
Although faculty salaries rose
nationally 3.4 percent, Gardener
said that accounting for inflation
leaves a real increase of only .7
percent.
From 1970 to 1981, faculty
salaries on average fell nationally,
Gardener said, but they have
increased during the past two
years.
"Good news about this survev

is that it is the second straight rise
in salaries," Gardner said. "We're
kind of optimistic for the trend to
continue because two years in a
row we've seen an increase."
Hamermesh said he thinks the
trend may continue. "The number
of kids of college-going age is
increasing, thereby increasing the
demand of professors," he said.
However, he also noted that
public schools, especially in Cali
fornia, will be keeping salaries low
due to budget crunches and pri
vate schools will not need to raise
salaries as much to compete.
Hamermesh also compared
professors' salaries unfavorably to
those in other professions such as
health care, law and engineering.
In 1979, the average lawyer made
46 percent more than the average
professor and in 1993, 70 percent
more. In 1979 doctors made 29
percent more and in 1993, 55 per
cent more.
"There has been a substantial
decline for professors in regards to
other occupations. From 1979
we've lost out compared to other
professions." Hamermesh said.
"It's reflection of the relative
value society seems to place on
professors," he added.
