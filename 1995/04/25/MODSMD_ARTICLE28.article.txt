# Going wireless
## University tests new computer network system

If a new pilot program proves
successful, students and faculty
may soon be able to check their
electronic mail from Wilbur
Field, the banks of Lake Lagunita
or Stanford Stadium.
Metricom Inc., of Los Gatos, is
currently sponsoring an on-cam
pus test of its Ricochet communi
cations system, which combines
radio receivers and tiny transmit
ters with a unique wireless
modem that allows users to tap
into the computer network with
their laptop computers from any
where on campus.
Fifteen Metricom modems are
being tested on campus, mostly
by staff members. Although tech
nical kinks are still being ironed
out, Stanford's Director of Net
working Systems Sandra Senti
said these problems should be
resolved soon and test adminis
trators plan to expand the num
ber of modems to 25.
Milt Mallory, a network spe

cialist at Stanford, was part of
Metricom's first test which began
about a year ago. "The tests are
going pretty well — there are still
some big speed problems but the
conductivity is getting better."
Mallory, who still uses the sys
tem free of charge, said his job
description — basically fixing the
net — made the new modem
especially useful.
"I wander around campus on
foot fixing things on SllNet so it
is definitely worth it for me," he
said, adding that he didn't think
the modem would be as useful for
students or professors with free
stationary network connections.
As one of several guinea pig
campuses — another is UC-
Berkeley — Stanford may expand
the trial program to the student
and faculty bodies sometime soon
if administrators decide it is
worth the trouble and current
problems such as the substantial
slowness and the high costs of the
system are addressed.
In the test runs, the equip
ment and installation process are

free. However, if the system is
made available to the entire Uni
versity population, Metricom will
sell the connection service and
modems, providing free installa
tion.
Although universities will
receive a 33 percent discount, the
service will cost $200 initially for
each modem and $20 per month.
Senti said that even though the
service may only be beneficial for
some portions of the University
population, others may find it
useful.
"For certain populations, like
commuters, it makes a lot of
sense. For classrooms, it makes
a lot of sense," she said. "For
people who live in dorms, it's
not going to make a lot of sense
since they'll already be able to
log on from their rooms free of
charge."
The modems function by
bouncing signals to and from a
series of transmitters called Pole
Tops because they were original
ly expected to be placed on the
tops of telephone poles.
