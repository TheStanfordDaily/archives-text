## Four golfers enough to take title at home Seniors shine but Woods quits 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team showed
last weekend that despite all the hype sur
rounding freshman phenom Tiger Woods,
the Cardinal is not a one-man squad.
No. 2 Stanford won its fifth title in 11
tries this season by winning on its home
course at the U.S. Intercollegiate. Despite

'Tiger has had a great year
and he has carried us in a
few tournaments, but for us
to win, its going to take
great play from everybody/

the loss of Woods to an injury, the team
was able to rebound from a tough sixth
place finish in Tempe, Ariz, last week with
a three-stroke victory over No. 6 Arizona
State.
"It was a good confidence booster," said
senior All-American Steve Burdick. "It
definitely brought us together, and we
really put together some really solid
rounds."
The loss of Woods meant that the Car
dinal would be forced to record the scores
of all four of its remaining players. Usual
ly in collegiate golf, five rounds are played
while only four of those scores are record
ed. The squad also played the third and
final round without a fifth man because
NCAA regulations do not allow for a sub
stitution.
"It was definitely a lot of pressure,"
Burdick said, "knowing that there was so
little room for error."

Not that many rival coaches would have
considered the Cardinal especially handi
capped. Without Woods, who will likely be
a consensus Ail-American, Stanford is
equipped with Burdick and three fellow
senior All-Americans. Since winning the
NCAA championship last year, the team
has been labeled a Dream Team of sorts,
but has had some difficulty due to lack of
practice time.
"It was great to sort of bring it back to
the way it was last spring," Burdick said.
"I've been kind of slumping this season,
and it was great to play solid golf again.
It's a good sign going into Pac-lOs."
Individually, Stanford dominated the
awards ceremony. Senior Casey Martin
took the title with a seven-under-par 206,
three strokes ahead of California's Charlie
Wi. Fellow senior Notah Begay 111 finished
one stroke back at 210 in third place.
William Yanagisawa and Burdick rounded
out the Stanford finishers with scores of
216 and 224, respectively.
Woods left the tournament after the
11th hole of the second round complaining
of soreness in his shoulder. He was strug
gling at eight-over-par and apparently felt
pain from the first tee shot of the day. He
underwent an MRI on Sunday morning
and according to team physician Amy
Ladd, suffered scarring in his right rotator
cuff but no tearing. The scarring appar
ently resulted from a high school baseball
injury.
As the top collegian in the nation by
scoring average, the loss of Woods for the
tournament was a major blow. At the same
time, however, the team realizes that he is
only one player.
"Tiger has had a great year and he has
carried us in a few tournaments," Burdick
said, "but for us to win, it's going to take
great play from everybody.
"We really showed what kind of play
each guy on this team is capable of."
