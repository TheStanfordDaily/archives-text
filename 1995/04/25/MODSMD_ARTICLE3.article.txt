Addressing the many difficul
ties that arise from taking time off
from Stanford, the Personal
Leave for Graduate Students
Committee presented a near-final
draft of the University's first ma
ternity and paternity leave policy
for graduate students to the Com
mittee on Graduate Studies yes
terday.
Even so, difficulties remain for
graduate students, who could risk
financial aid by taking a leave.
The maternity and paternity
leave policy will be finalized and
inserted in the Graduate Students
Handbook by next fall, said Assoc.
Dean of Graduate Policy George
Dekker. The policy represents a
formalization of current leave
policies with minor modifications
and clarification on the impact of
leaves on health insurance and fi
nancial aid.
The Committee on Graduate
Studies was pleased with the poli
cy, Dekker said, although the
graduate leave committee will
have to clarify a sentence concern
ing financial aid before the draft is

finalized.
According to Dekker, the draft
ed policy is vague about the effect
of a leave on financial aid. If a stu-

dent is guaran
teed four years of
financial aid, a
one-quarter
leave should not
have any effect
on financial aid
eligibility,
Dekker said.
While the
leave should not

have an impact on guaranteed aid,
there is no iron-clad guarantee for
most students that they will con
tinue to receive financial aid,
Dekker added. A student can
"jeopardize his chances" by taking
a leave, he continued.
According to Dekker, the main
goal of the policy is to "alert stu
dents to problems that could
arise" from a leave. Since Stanford
has a lack of available information
on maternity and paternity leave
for graduates, the committee
sought to collect all available poli
cies and put them together.

The leave policy, however,
"articulates what pretty much
was in current practice," Dekker
added. It is, however, "about as
specific as it can be."
The policy also clarifies the
registration category for students
on medical leave. Since students
must register for health insur
ance during autumn quarter, an
autumn leave currently jeopar
dizes the insurance.
The changed policy, however,
allows graduate students on
autumn leave to receive health
insurance on their return,
Dekker said.
After examining the current
leave policy and other pertinent
information, the committee
decided to put together the new
policy. "We try to make it clear
that leave is an option of students
rather than the University,"
Dekker said. "The main thing is
giving people advice .. . and to
make sure they know the conse
quences.
"We got interested when the
University had no maternity or
paternity leave policy," Dekker
said. "Obviously, maternity leave
is not the only thing so we looked

at the whole topic of personal
leave."
The committee discovered that
the current graduate leave policy
makes taking a leave very diffi
cult. "We discovered that there
are many, many factors that
make it a tricky business to go on
leave," Decker said.
For example, students who are
on "financial aid packages and
external support can be affected
by a leave, especially one more
than a quarter ... and especially
if it occurs early [in the academic
yearj," Dekker said.
Graduate students, who typi
cally support themselves with
outside financial support, could
have their funding cut if their
leave is too long, Dekker added.
The students could also meet
with difficulty in their classes. If
a student has to take required
classes that are in a sequence,
problems can arise, Dekker said.
"If you are out of step with the
sequence, it can really screw up
progress," Dekker said.
The problem is especially
acute when graduate students
are working on research projects.
With a leave "any length of
time, [students] may not be able
to get back on board," Dekker
said.
On the whole, Dekker said, the
shorter a leave the better it is.
