Addressing the many difficul
ties that arise from taking time off
from Stanford, the Personal
Leave for Graduate Students
Committee presented a near-final
draft of the University's first ma
ternity and paternity leave policy
for graduate students to the Com
mittee on Graduate Studies yes
terday.
Even so, difficulties remain for
graduate students, who could risk
financial aid by taking a leave.
The maternity and paternity
leave policy will be finalized and
inserted in the Graduate Students
Handbook by next fall, said Assoc.
Dean of Graduate Policy George
Dekker. The policy represents a
formalization of current leave
policies with minor modifications
and clarification on the impact of
leaves on health insurance and fi
nancial aid.
The Committee on Graduate
Studies was pleased with the poli
cy, Dekker said, although the
graduate leave committee will
have to clarify a sentence concern
ing financial aid before the draft is

finalized.
According to Dekker, the draft
ed policy is vague about the effect
of a leave on financial aid. If a stu-

dent is guaran
teed four years of
financial aid, a
one-quarter
leave should not
have any effect
on financial aid
eligibility,
Dekker said.
While the
leave should not

have an impact on guaranteed aid,
there is no iron-clad guarantee for
most students that they will con
tinue to receive financial aid,
Dekker added. A student can
"jeopardize his chances" by taking
a leave, he continued.
According to Dekker, the main
goal of the policy is to "alert stu
dents to problems that could
arise" from a leave. Since Stanford
has a lack of available information
on maternity and paternity leave
for graduates, the committee
sought to collect all available poli
cies and put them together.
