# Top-ranked cyclists break away from the pack

### Rajen Sheth Contributing writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
cycling team chalked up impres
sive wins in the Chico State Week
end Invitational by winning the
long road race and the individual
time trial and placing a close sec
ond in the criterium.
The weekend was marked by
several individual triumphs in
addition to the team win. Several
cyclists placed in the top 10 in
their respective events and a
Stanford team member won the A
category in each of the three
events.
The road race, which for riders
in some categories was 98 miles
long, was one of the longest of the
year. However, Stanford survived
the trek to accumulate 228 points,
winning the road race by 75. In
the men's A category, graduate
student Dario Falquier and junior
John Schlesinger placed one-two
as they were in the lead for 80
miles. Junior Andrew Lewis
placed fifth in the A race, while
senior Mike Cummer was third in
the B's, grad student Dan Lyons
was runner-up in the C's and Ben
Geiger placed third in the D's.
The women's team was missing
grad student Joan Wilson who
won last week's road race at Stan
ford; it was led by grad student
Megan Troxwell.
"I'd say pretty much every
Stanford rider rode very strongly
in the road race," Geiger said.
While the team finished the
race far in front, the length had
some effect on many riders.
Schlesinger said he had to fight
severe dehydration to finish sec
ond as he rode hard to break from
the other riders at the beginning,
and then he and Falquier rode
alone for most of the race.
"Twenty miles into the break,

we were hitting washboards and
potholes for a four mile stretch,"
Schlesinger said. "I was thinking,
'Jesus, we're going to have to be
out there for another 60. This is
really hell.' "
"I was just happy to survive,"
Upton said.
However, coach Art Walker
was happy about the training ben
efit of the long race. "I think the
mileage will be really helpful for
all who did the road race," Walker
said.

1 was thinking...
this is really hell.'

In the individual time trial,
Stanford attained 215 points to
win by 56 over its nearest com
petitor. The 10-mile race was
highlighted by grad student Dave
Bailey, who set a new course
record with a time of 21 minutes,
19 seconds. The record was previ
ously held by a national team
cyclist who raced for Chico in
1981.
The men's A category was
rounded out with a third place fin
ish for Falquier and a sixth place
finish for Schlesinger. Stanford
dominated the men's D category
as Geiger and Dave Cornelius
placed one-two. Once again, in the
women's division, Troxwell led
the A team with a second place
finish.
Finally, in the criterium —
which was raced on a downtown
city block — Stanford narrowly
lost by four points to California.
