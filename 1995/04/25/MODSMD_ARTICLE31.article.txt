# UOP blasted by lacrosse

Pacific 1
Stanford 25

The women's lacrosse squad needed two wins
this weekend to ensure its first undefeated
league season in memory. Collectively, its oppo
sition barely showed up.
After opening the weekend with a forfeit over
Humboldt State on Saturday, Stanford awaited
Pacific, who came to Maloney Field on Sunday
after an earlier loss to UC-Santa Cruz. The
tired Tigers delivered a feeble effort as the Car
dinal lit up the Maloney Field scoreboard for 25
goals.
"I think they were very tired and didn't even
really try," said junior co-captain Peppie
Stephenson.
The Tigers attained one of their objectives —
to score a goal against the Western Women's
Lacrosse League regular season champions.
UOP's score came in the latter stages of the
first half on a free position shot. By then, how
ever, the Cardinal had the contest well in hand.
At halftime, the margin was 15.
"It's easy to let down if you're ahead," senior
attacker Amy Leib said. "We tried to work on
plays, try people at new positions."
Senior goalkeeper Emily Chang kept the meager
Tiger attack at bay. Although her saves count was
low, UOP was unable to generate offense by going
behind the net and passing to a cutter in front of the
goal as Chang was there for interception after inter-
ception.
Offensively, a slew of Cardinal
players gave the Tigers
headaches. While nobody in par
ticular stood out as leading the
carnage, the crisp team execution
gave players reason to be happy.
"The thing I was the most
impressed with was the way we
passed and worked as a team,"
junior co-captain Hannah Flatau
said.
Although UOP offered little
resistance, the Cardinal juggled
its lineup to give players experi
ence for the upcoming Western
Women's Final Four. By virtue of
its wins this weekend, the Cardi
nal clinches the top seed in
Northern California. As a result,
the squad will bypass this week
end's qualifying tournament and
earn a free trip to the Western
Women's Final Four on May 6
and 7.
Instead of playing for its post
season life, the Cardinal will
entertain a San Francisco club
team this Sunday at 1 p.m. The
Maloney Field contest, although
meaningless in the standings, is
expected to provide stiff competi
tion for Stanford. The squad,
which features Stanford coach
Kay Cowperthwait, has defeated
the Cardinal twice in earlier
matches this season.
"We always learn a lot when we
play them because we know a lot
of them," Flatau said. "Also, it's
not as much of a grudge match as
some of our games against colle
giate teams have been."

Nobody on the squad has been
in the current position in previ
ous years — with the privilege of
bypassing the qualifying tourney.
In the past, UC-Davis has earned
the No. 1 NorCal seed while the
Cardinal has battled its way
through to qualify for the Final
Four.
After dispatching the No. 1
Southern California seed in the
Final Four, Stanford has fallen to
UC-Davis in the Western
Women's Championship the past
two years. This year, the Cardinal
may meet the same opponent in
the final. However, Stanford will
be the favorite this time around,
with two victories over the Aggies

dominating team in

— Hannah Flatau

already under its belt.
In light of the squad's recent
just-short finishes in the postsea
son, Flatau feels that asserting
the club's strength through an
undefeated league regular season
delivers a critical message.
"It was important to ensure
that right now we're the dominat
ing team in Northern California
women's lacrosse," Flatau said.
"Last year, we were hosting the
Final Four and almost lost in our
qualifying tournament, which
would have been kind of embar
rassing. This year, we're hoping
to win it all."
