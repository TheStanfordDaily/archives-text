# Classic row at Redwood
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
After improving steadily through the first
few weeks of the spring season, the Stanford
crew teams enjoyed a successful weekend in the
Stanford Classic at Redwood Shores.
The men lost to Oregon State on Saturday by
four seconds despite a fast time of five minutes,
54 seconds.
That same time earned a victory over Long
Beach State later that day. On Sunday, the
squad improved by a second and dispatched UC-
Irvine by roughly the same margin.
Meanwhile, the women's varsity registered
key victories over Oregon State and UCLA on
Saturday. The junior varsity teams also posted
wins, while the novice eights lost to the Beavers
but knocked off the Bruins.
"It went pretty much as expected," said
sophomore Anne Dubinsky. "We went in know
ing we had really good chances of winning."
Conditions were ideal for a Stanford squad
that saw its first two events of the spring wiped
out by torrential rains.
"It was a beautiful day," Dubinsky said. "The
water was really flat for Redwood Shores. A lot
of times, we get a strong headwind during the
second half but there was no headwind."
Prior to last weekend, both squads had made
trips to San Diego and Pullman, Wash., with a
home race sandwiched in between vs. UC-Davis.
The San Diego match proved to be a difficult
challenge, especially for the men, who failed to
reach the finals and brought up the rear in the
petite finals. Among the five teams finishing
ahead of the Cardinal in San Diego were squads
that later lost to Stanford.
"I think we've been learning a lot because
we've been beating teams that earlier in the year
beat us," said senior captain Josh Breen.
The women found themselves in a similar
boat, placing sixth in the finals for the Whittier
Cup. Like the men, they have suffered through
a lack of practice time due to the incessant rain
fall.
However, the squad started to rebound with
its home debut April 8. The varsity, JV and
novice women's squads all defeated UC-Davis,
while the men's varsity defeated the Aggies as
well.
In Pullman last weekend, the women fell to
Washington State in the final 10 strokes while
defeating Gonzaga. The men destroyed the
Cougars and, at the 1,000-meter, halfway point
posted a course record. The men also tied the
Zags and knocked off Pacific Lutheran.
