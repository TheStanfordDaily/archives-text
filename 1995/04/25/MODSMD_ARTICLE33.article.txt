# Women sailors breeze in PCCs
## Young men settle for 11th at Thompson Trophy 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
Stanford sailing's performance over the weekend
might best be captured by the introduction to ABC's
"Wide World of Sports." The women convincingly
experienced the thrill of victory at the Pacific Coast
Championships while the men suffered the agony of
defeat in managing only llth-place at the Thomp
son Trophy regatta.
Dominance is an understatement in describing
the women's performance at the Naval Yacht Club
in San Diego. In moderate wind conditions, Stanford
blew away the field en route to securing a spot in the
national championships. The Cardinal finished in
first place in 15 out of 16 races, with its one blemish
a second-place showing. UC-Santa Barbara finished
a very distant second in the overall standings fol

lowed by California.
Many schools had conceded victory to the Cardi
nal before the regatta, limiting the pool of competi
tion to only four schools. Coach Steve Bourdow also
expected Stanford to triumph, but wanted to take
more than a first place result away from the contest.
"They were clearly better than all the other
teams," said Bourdow. "Our goal was to win and
learn something about the site."
A place in the national championships means
Stanford will return to San Diego at the end of May
to face 15 other qualifying schools. The Cardinal
used this weekend to gain an important edge going
into championship competition against much more
challenging schools. Bourdow was hoping his sailors
would achieve a comforting knowledge of the regat-

ta site.
"They did an excellent job get
ting comfortable," Bourdow said.
"That gives us a psychological
edge."
In additional to the mental
preparation, the women picked
up some tactical experience as
well. The San Diego course is rel
atively short, translating into a
great emphasis on starting and
avoiding mistakes. As Stanford
discovered this weekend, more
work is required to recover from
mistakes because boat speed is
less of a factor on the short
course.
This weekend, however, the
two Stanford boats worked hard
enough to be perfect and near
perfect. The A-division boat of
sophomore skipper Alice Manard

and junior crew Sibyl Diver
breezed to seven first-place bul
lets out of eight, while the B-divi
sion duo of junior skipper Cinna
mon Hampikian and freshman
crew Susan Bradford did one bet
ter in posting a spotless record.
Freshman Noelle Marquis saw
limited time as a crew in two of
the later races. The five sailors
combined to garner the praise of
their coach.
"They're definitely a higher
quality of Stanford team," said
Bourdow. "It's the same people;
they definitely stepped it up.
The Stanford men were unable
to match the performance of their
female teammates. A group that
included three freshmen was
unable to crack the top 10, filling
just short with an llth-place
result in a 20-team field.
The team received a rude wel
come from the Thames River's
bizarre conditions. A conflict
between the natural sea breeze

and sporadic weather system
caused numerous problems for a
Cardinal unit attempting to gain
experience against the best
schools in the country.
Freshman skipper Phil Barrow
participated in his first varsity
start. Barrow manned the A-divi
sion boat with sophomore crew
Don Chennavasin and ended the
competition in 15th-place. The
tricky winds made starts chal
lenging and hampered Barrow's
performance throughout the
regatta.
Senior skipper Rolf Kaiser also
had a rough regatta. The B-divi
sion team of Kaiser and freshman
crew Barry Kang experienced
problems like Barrow and Chen
navasin, finishing one slot better
than the A-division team at 14th
place.
Bourdow was disappointed
with the results of the two teams,
but only because he sees their
potential. "Both have the ability

to be in the top 10."
Cardinal freshman Danny
Zimbaldi not only cracked the top
10, but earned an impressive
third-place in C-division races.
Zimbaldi handled the conditions
and pressure of the prestigious
regatta like an experienced veter
an. His ability to handle the sin
gle-manned Laser in the unpre
dictable winds scored points with
Bourdow, as Zimbaldi is currently
battling fellow freshman John
Meade for the skipper position in
Stanford's B-division playoff
boat.
"I imagine he's not completely
satisfied with third," Bourdow
said. "One of his biggest goals is
to stay positive in adverse condi
tions, he accomplished that."
Considering the team's overall
showing, Bourdow's disappoint
ment didn't linger. The regatta
will not affect Stanford's rank
ings, so any experience gained by
the Cardinal is positive.
