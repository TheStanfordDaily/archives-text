# Play ball, finally
## Don't blame the game for the strike or kill it by boycotting the ballpark 
### 
Better late than never, I suppose. The
game of baseball has gone through a lot
of changes recently. Two expansion
teams. A new divisional and playoff structure.
An almost-amazing season in which the likes
of Matt Williams, Ken Griffey Jr. and Tony
Gwynn had opportunities to break some of the
longest standing marks in the record book.
And a bitter and divisive strike that neither
side won but both you and I lost.

For nine months, they haggled and argued
and bargained and never seemed to get any
where closer to making a deal. Finally, in the
waning moments before the curtain opened on
what we all knew to be a monumental farce
(the replacements had hearts, but they still
weren't cool), they realized that beginning a

season like that would send the game to its
grave and returned to their senses. So we'll
get to see real ball in 1995.
I was one of the millions of bitter fans who
sat and watched all the crap fly back and forth
between the two sides. I vowed that even if
baseball returned, I would not grace the fool
ish owners or players with my presence or dol
lars.
But as the Marlins prepare for the Dodgers
in Miami later today to kick off the somewhat
shorter-than-usual 1995 season, I have to
admit I've had a change of heart. I'll probably
be at the Giants home opener on Friday. In
fact, I'll probably spend a large portion of my
spring quarter up at the 'Stick.
What's the reason for the switch? I'm not
going to blame the game.
For 13 years, between the ages of five and
18, I lived and died baseball. Nothing could
compare to the game. There was something
magical about the way the sun played over the
rich green of the infield grass, something spe
cial about the sound of a line drive coming off
of a hardwood bat, something mystical in the
solitary figure of a pitcher taking his position
on the mound. I have never felt more alive
than in those moments that I watched fast
balls hurtle towards me as the scent of pine
resin filled my nostrils and all the sounds

around me suddenly faltered.
Ironically, the darkest day of my life was
the day I decided to come to Stanford. For on
that day, I consciously realized that my base
ball-playing dreams were over and conceded
defeat.
Over the past three years that I have been
physically separated from the game, I have
also grown apart emotionally. While I have
often lamented my lack of interest in what I
once considered the cornerstone of my being, I
was thankful that this was the case when the
strike went into effect last August. If I had
been as obsessed as I was just a few years ear
lier, I would have been crushed.
Not everyone was as fortunate as I was. I
hate to think what happened to the spirits of
the millions of kids who were in love with the
game and following every pitch of that almost
magical season. They watched as forces they
probably couldn't understand extinguished
the cause of so much joy. I wonder what they
felt when their parents explained to them
what the problems with their heroes were.
But I won't blame the game for these bro
ken hearts. The game isn't the cause of the
problems. It's the industry that has grown up
around it, intent upon exploiting our love,

that is the source of our pain.
There are people who, unlike
myself, still plan on boycotting
the games. This strategy will cer
tainly hurt the owners, if the fans
stay home in large numbers. But
it also may kill the game.
Yes, there's a possibility (even
a certainty) that if Major League
Baseball falls, some sort of Super
League would form. But what
happens in the interim?
What happens to kids who

grow up in this type of environ
ment? How do we keep the magic
alive when those who are sup
posed to feel it with the most
strength never learn what it's all
about?
We need to walk a fine line. We
can't let the owners and players
treat what is rightfully ours so
shabbily. But we can't punish
them so much that they're forced
to pack up and go home (take a
look at San Diego, Pittsburgh and
now Montreal). Punishing them
only hurts the game.
I hope that the players remem
ber the symbiotic relationship
that they have with us. Since

their return, they seem to under
stand that they owe us more than
just field time in exchange for our
dollars and adoration. But how
long will this last?
If they forget and tank the
1995 season like last year's, I'm
afraid that even the magic of the
game won't be enough to make
the fans forget the idiocy of those
who make the game possible. And
that would be too bad.

Seth Goldstein says he still is
going to feel chills when the Mar
lin pitcher throws that first pitch
to the first batter of the year. Even
if they're all scumbags.
