# Men give awards, Knight wins MVP
## 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team logged its last points,
final assists and closing rebounds
well over a month ago. Still, how
ever, there were some loose ends
which needed to be tied up.
Misty-eyed goodbyes, heart
felt thanks, soulful accolades —
these were just a few of the
things that still needed to be put
to rest. And on Sunday, all was
taken care of in fine fashion at
the Stanford Basketball Awards
Banquet.
The pageantry and revelry
were kept to a minimum which
was more than fitting for a team
that all season long stressed
often-overlooked fundamentals
like hard work, class, team and
tons of sweat. And while persper
ation levels were kept to a mini
mum at the grand gala, levels of
laughter, mirth and family were
sky-high.
Bob Murphy from radio sta
tion KNEW kicked off the
awards program by recounting a
tale of junior swingman David
Harbour's bug-eating debacle in
Oregon. Apparently during the
road trip to Oregon this season,
Harbour — who Murphy joked
was considering majoring in
entomology — felt it necessary to
dispose of a spider at the dining
table by swallowing it.
Hearing junior forward Dar
ren Allaway, a native of England
and the team's Most Valuable
Accent, retell the sordid tale
brought plenty of chuckles and
guffaws. But through the happi
ness and joy of reliving the mem
ories of a successful 20-win,
NCAA tournament season, one
could not help but feel a tinge of
finality and sadness particularly
with graduating guard Warren
Gravely, center and co-captain
Bart Lammersen and forward
Todd Manley.
Ijammersen, alongside fellow
co-captain forward Andy Pop
pink, was also awarded the
Howie Dallmar Coaches award,

presented to the Stanford players
who displayed excellence on and
off the court.
Sophomore point guard
Brevin Knight earned the Hank
Luisetti Most Valuable Player
award. Knight broke or tied five
Pacific 10 Conference, school or
Maples Pavilion records and
averaged 16.6 points (10th in the
Pac-10), a team-high 6.6 assists
(fifth in the Pac-10), and 2.8
steals (first in the Pac-10).
Knight was also a first-team
All-Pac-10 selection as a sopho
more which puts him in the posi
tion to be named All-Pac-10 for
three years, placing him in the
company of luminaries like Tyus
Edney, Harold Miner, Adam
Keefe, Don Mac Lean, Ed O'Ban
non and Gary Payton. Knight
and All-Pac-10 shooting guard
Dion Cross formed what could be
argued the West Coast's most
dominating backcourt.
Other honorees were Allaway
as the team's best defensive play
er, Harbour as Most Inspira
tional and freshman center Tim
Young as Most Improved Player.
Harbour was also a first team
All-Pac-10 academic selection,
and Young was named to the All-
Pac-10 first team as well as an
honorable mention for Basket
ball Weekly's freshman All-
American team.
An announcement was also
made regarding the closing of a
deal which has the Cardinal play
ing in an early season four-team
tournament in North Carolina
next year. The Tar Heels are slat
ed to be the Cardinal's opponent.
Arrangements are also being
finalized for a made-for-TV invi
tational next season at the San
Jose Arena featuring Stanford,
California, DePaul and Seton
Hall.
As head coach Mike Mont
gomery said, "Good things hap
pen to good people." And with the
top six players returning, along
with an infusion of raw freshman
talent, next season will have
plenty of good people and should
be real good.
