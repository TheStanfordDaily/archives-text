After putting the brakes on
a four-game skid by storming
past California three times
over the weekend, the rejuve
nated Stanford baseball team
will shift its attention to non
league foe San Jose State
tonight at 7 p.m.
The sub-.500 Spartans will
try to complete a sweep of the
Cardinal in the contest at
6,000-seat Municipal Stadium.
Sam Piraro's squad knocked
off the Cardinal 9-4 in the
team's only previous meeting
at Sunken Diamond on April 4.
Meanwhile, Stanford has
upped its record to 25-18 and
15-9 in the Pacific 10 South,
one game behind league leader
USC. Although tonight's game
will not affect the Six-Pac
standings, the Cardinal hopes
to continue its winning streak
and improve its seeding for the
NCAA Regionals.
Much like last year, the Car
dinal has struggled in games
outside the conference, espe
cially midweek games. Stan
ford has posted just a 10-9
record outside the Six-Pac in
1995.
