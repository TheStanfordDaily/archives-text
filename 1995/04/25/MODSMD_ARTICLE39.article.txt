# Group formed to protect Zapata murals

A committee formed to examine ways to
preserve the Casa Zapata murals during
upcoming renovations is seeking a student
member to help form regulations governing
the future care of the murals.
Called the Oversight Group and falling
under the jurisdiction of Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds,
the committee has met once and plans to do
the bulk of its work this quarter — finishing
prior to the scheduled summer Stern Hall
renovations.
According to Keith Guy, director of Hous
ing and Dining Services, the group was
formed in response to student concerns
voiced at a January meeting involving the
Office of Residential Education, Dining Ser
vices administrators and Chicano student
groups.
"The murals are in no danger of being
destroyed or damaged during the renova
tions at Stern this summer," said Guy, the
group's chair. "The primary objective of the
group is to come together and make sure we

know what to do to protect the murals."
According to Oscar Valadez, a master's
student in civil engineering, concerns about
the murals are widespread.
"We realize that the University will not
be out there destroying the murals." Valadez
said. "The murals at Zapata are significant
to the community and we have been very
vocal in saying that they are not to be
touched.
"The murals present many educational,
historical and political statements," he said.
"They present diversity of perspective to the
Stanford community as a whole and expose
them to things that they would not normal
ly be exposed to."
In addition to renovation-inspired wor
ries, community members have voiced con
cerns regarding the maintenance of the art
work and preservation of a historical record.
The departure of muralist and former
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga after
his wife Cecilia was laid off from the Office
of Student Affairs last year, according to
some committee members, has left no one
directly responsible for the murals' upkeep.
However, Guy said the University will

take charge. "The University owns the
murals because they are on University build
ings and so therefore it is our responsibility
to protect and preserve them," he said.
One long-term goal of the community,
Valadez said, is the preservation of the
murals' history.
"When Tony was here he passed on the
history of the murals to the students living
in Zapata," he said. "But now that he is gone
and many of the students who knew the his
tory of the murals have since graduated, the
question is: How will we preserve their his
tory?"
Another concern the committee will tack
le will be ways to deal with future damage to
the murals in Burciaga's absence.
Committee member Cesar Cervantes,
facilities supervisor at Stern, said one possi
bility was to let the murals naturally wear
away — as often occurs with murals —
rather than having somebody from the Art
Department continuously touch them up.
"There are no words to state the impor
tance of the murals — they are invaluable.
Many people are attached to them, including
myself," he said.
