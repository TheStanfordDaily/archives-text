# Committee to rule on election violations
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
ASSU Hearings Officer Chi-Ming Chien
said the ASSU Senate will create a commit
tee following its meeting tonight to decide
whether seven candidates in last week's
election must declare expenditures from
material published in El Aguila, a campus
Chicano / Latino newsmagazine.
Other incidents under investigation in
clude a possible e-mail misrepresentation
by candidate Andre Vanier and an alleged
mass-mailing violation where special-fee
proponents campaigned on e-mail mailing
lists.
Chien, who has the jurisdiction to decide
himself, has chosen to defer the ruling to a
yet-to-be-named committee because he said

the issue is "too highly politicized for me to
make a decision single-handedly."
At tonight's meeting, Chien said, the
senate will choose a member to nominate
this committee. Following nomination of
the committee, Senate Chair Nawwar Kas
rawi will declare a special senate meeting to
seek approval for the committee, Chien
said.
Short biographies of five senate candi
dates, one Council of Presidents candidate
and a senior class president candidate were
included in one page of a four-page election
spread in the latest edition of El Aguila.
"It's not an endorsement of any kind,"
said freshman Cecilia Balli, editor of El
Aguila. "It's something we put together and
decided to do."
Three of the five featured candidates won

voting positions. In addition, the slate of the
featured COP candidate won the election.
The other three pages consisted solely of
information and encouragement for stu
dents to vote for the MEChA special fee and
other ethnic special fees. MEChA is a Chi
cano / Latino student organization.
"It's up to (the) hearings committee to
determine whether the material is editorial
matter or not in a publication. If they deter
mine it is editorial matter, it would be pro
tected under the bylaws," Chien said.
If the committee deems that the four
page insert constitutes editorial matter, the
candidates will not be responsible for the
views expressed in the spread.
However, if the committee decides the
spread is not editorial matter, the candi
dates will have to declare the endorsement

on their campaign expenditure lists. Each
senate candidate can spend no more than
$90 on the campaign.
El Aguila's budget for the 12-page issue
was $1,248, according to Publications
Board Director Danny Bressler. Election
rules state that candidates must declare 1.5
times the cost of production. Since only one
seventh of one page was used per candidate,
the amount senators may have to declare
will be approximately $22.25.
If the addition of these costs drives a can
didate's campaign budget over $90, the can
didate may be disqualified. Candidates filed
their campaign records yesterday.
Chien said he will act as the prosecutor
and present the facts about this case and
other possible violations.
Vanier, who won a voting sen
ate seat, wrote a portion of anoth
er student's e-mail which was sent
individually to Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity members last week. The
committee will decide whether
Vanier's use of another student's
e-mail account constitutes a viola
tion of election guidelines.
Both Vanier and the student —
who wishes to remain anonymous
— said Vanier had permission to
add to the message.
Chien said he is unsure whether
he will pursue a possible mass-mail
violation by one member of Barrio
Assistance. Election rules state
that e-mail lists cannot be used for
campaign purposes. Chien said
that "somebody in the group didn't
know about the rules."
