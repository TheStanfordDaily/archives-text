A female Stanford prospective
freshman escaped unharmed
from a kidnapping after being
driven around campus and Palo
Alto in the assailant's car last
week, police said.
Friday evening at around
7:30 p.m., the woman was
standing outside Tresidder
Union when the kidnapper
"used a ruse" to lure her toward
his car, Stanford Police Sgt.
Rick Tipton said.
The kidnapper then forced the
woman inside his car and drove
away, Tipton said.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said that the kidnapper
first asked the woman whether
she was a "pro fro."
"Obviously it's somebody
that's familiar with this place
that would know that term,"
Niemeyer said. The kidnapper
told the woman, a juvenile,
that he had some papers that

she needed to have, Niemeyer
said.
After driving around for a
short while, the man "stopped in
a secluded area and attempted to
kiss the unwilling victim," Tipton
said.
The female then started to cry
â€” at which point the suspect
"seemed remorseful" and drove
her back to campus, leaving her
at the Quad, Tipton said.
Police are searching for a
white male, around 28 years of
age, of medium height and
weight with short dirty-blond
hair. His car was described as a
boxy two-door sedan with dark
exterior paint and a dark interi
or.
An area-wide all-points bul
letin has been issued with the
suspect's description, but
Niemeyer said police have few
clues.
"We don't really have any real
dynamic clues that would lead us
to the identity of this individual,"
Niemeyer said.
