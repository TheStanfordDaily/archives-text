# Students hit the road for good causes

If you haven't had luck finding a
corporate internship for this summer,
you might want to keep your bike out
of University storage and just ride it
all summer long.
Eveiy June, Bike Aid unleashes
about 100 young, service-oriented cy
clists on a nine-week, cross-country
trek. Participants leave after raising
approximately $3,000 dollars on their
own to help fund community develop
ment projects overseas.
While a Stanford student, Nazir
Ahmad started Bike Aid with friends
Sean Skelton and Brian Bower in
1985. Bike Aid began as part of a new
organization he had formed a year be
fore with his brother, called the Over
seas Development Network (ODN),
designed to fund community service
projects in third-world countries.
"The '80s were a paradoxical time.
Government policy did very little to
advance public service. Selfishness
became okay," Ahmad said. "We also
saw the beginnings of what I'd call a
public service movement. People were
more critical. There was less sloga
neering.
"Stanford played a significant lead
ership role in promoting public ser
vice. Our efforts were encouraged,
sustained and nurtured by the Uni
versity," he said.
Departing from San Francisco,
Seattle, Portland, Texas or Montreal,
participants ride approximately 70
miles in a day to reach their final des

tination in Washington, D.C. On the
days they aren't biking, the cyclists
offer service and educational projects
for the communities they pass
through.
"It was the best experience of my
life," said senior Jacinda Mawson, a
tri athlete who comes from a family of
avid cyclists. "I decided to do Bike Aid
because it was a goal of mine since
high school to ride my bike across the

country. The best part of the trip was
the group of people I was working
with."
Bower said that Bike Aid encour
ages personal growth as well as physi
cal fitness. "Bike Aid does a lot for
everybody involved, from experienc
ing the basic dynamics of living with a
group without getting on each other's
nerves to perspectives on the issues
brought up by people from different

college campuses."
Ahmad agreed that the cyclists
benefit more than just physically.
"Spending time with the group re
quires doing a lot of problem-solving
as a team and community. Riders are
not only visiting places, they're also
experiencing vulnerability to weather
and other natural conditions."
