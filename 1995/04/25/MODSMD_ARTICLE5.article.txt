# Students hit the road for good causes

### Tory Foster 
If you haven't had luck finding a
corporate internship for this summer,
you might want to keep your bike out
of University storage and just ride it
all summer long.
Eveiy June, Bike Aid unleashes
about 100 young, service-oriented cy
clists on a nine-week, cross-country
trek. Participants leave after raising
approximately $3,000 dollars on their
own to help fund community develop
ment projects overseas.
While a Stanford student, Nazir
Ahmad started Bike Aid with friends
Sean Skelton and Brian Bower in
1985. Bike Aid began as part of a new
organization he had formed a year be
fore with his brother, called the Over
seas Development Network (ODN),
designed to fund community service
projects in third-world countries.
"The '80s were a paradoxical time.
Government policy did very little to
advance public service. Selfishness
became okay," Ahmad said. "We also
saw the beginnings of what I'd call a
public service movement. People were
more critical. There was less sloga
neering.
"Stanford played a significant lead
ership role in promoting public ser
vice. Our efforts were encouraged,
sustained and nurtured by the Uni
versity," he said.
Departing from San Francisco,
Seattle, Portland, Texas or Montreal,
participants ride approximately 70
miles in a day to reach their final des

tination in Washington, D.C. On the
days they aren't biking, the cyclists
offer service and educational projects
for the communities they pass
through.
"It was the best experience of my
life," said senior Jacinda Mawson, a
tri athlete who comes from a family of
avid cyclists. "I decided to do Bike Aid
because it was a goal of mine since
high school to ride my bike across the

country. The best part of the trip was
the group of people I was working
with."
Bower said that Bike Aid encour
ages personal growth as well as physi
cal fitness. "Bike Aid does a lot for
everybody involved, from experienc
ing the basic dynamics of living with a
group without getting on each other's
nerves to perspectives on the issues
brought up by people from different

college campuses."
Ahmad agreed that the cyclists
benefit more than just physically.
"Spending time with the group re
quires doing a lot of problem-solving
as a team and community. Riders are
not only visiting places, they're also
experiencing vulnerability to weather
and other natural conditions."

Education graduate student Charlie Schiegel and UC-Santa Cruz graduate Heather Lawson participate in the sum
mer biking program.
Bower added that people
besides the bicyclists themselves
profit from the program. "The
people who benefit from Bike Aid
most are the communities in
other countries who get seed
money for projects. Everybody
who does Bike Aid raises money
before the trip. Each shoots for a
goal of $2,000-$3,000, which goes
into a fund at ODN, a large per
centage of which goes towards
individual development projects,"
he said.
The bikers stop for one or two
nights in different towns and
cities to perform community ser
vice. "They depend on the gen
erosity of others and the local
community service that they do
can be a catalyst for local hero
ism," Ahmad said.
Ahmad said he hoped to start
something that would last, unlike
other new, highly publicized but
temporary public-service organi
zations. "When we started Bike
Aid there were things like Live
Aid and Hands Across America
starting up. We were looking at
founding something a little bit

more grass-rootsy, not as glitzy,
something that would not be a
flash in the pan," he said.
Ahmad reasoned that a cross
country bike trip would be a suit
able context for mainstream
America's involvement with
international development issues
due to cycling's universal usage.
"Cycling is the most common
form of transportation, other
than walking, in the world," he
said.
When it started, Bike Aid had
no regular corporate financial
support, depending mostly on
students and volunteers.
"We had little money and little
experience but it made us pretty
resourceful." Ahmad said. "We
faced extraordinary skepticism
when getting started. I went to a
foundation to ask for some
money, and the person said, 'I
could give you some money but
that would make you think that it
could be done. I won't extend
your agony by giving you false
hope.' "
Ahmad said that the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service and former
University President Donald
Kennedy both proved particularly
instrumental to the student orga
nization.
The students' dedication to

the cause, Ahmad added, was
most helpful in realizing Bike
Aid.
"I worked in a tiny office in the
[BechtelJ International Center
with Sean Skelton. We were going
like mad, making zillions of phone
calls, barely getting by in a tiny
little office," Bower recalled.
"The first thing we had to do
was put together a brochure. It
was rough. Lots of hand-folding
and printing. We mailed them to
all college campuses in the coun
try," he added.
As Ahmad hoped, Bike Aid has
lasted. "It has been sort of like
working on one's dream in a way,
so you get pretty devoted. The
first three years I spent a lot of
time on it, as did many others
involved. My personal role dimin
ished relatively after that. I chair
the board, but it's a shared lead
ership now," he said.
Ahmad commented on how
Bike Aid has changed over time.
"We haven't really expanded
much in size, but we've gained a
lot in quality. We've learned from
our mistakes. It's more focused
now. Now, Bike Aid has a new
unifying theme for community
service every year," he said.
The year Mawson went on the
trip, the theme was AIDS aware

ness. "We had an HIV-positive
person with our group. Working
with him made me feel less
accomplished, because there I
was, a healthy young woman,
fully able to ride across country.
He's still not fully diagnosed with
the AIDS virus, but he's not
asymptomatic. He had lots of dif
ficulties — especially fatigue —
which made our sore butts seem
less important," she said.
Mawson's group worked at an
AIDS hospice in Utah, did chores
for AIDS patients who were
unable to leave their houses,
made safer sex packets and, since
they were in the neighborhood,
also undertook some flood victim
relief in Missouri.
The experience changed Maw
son's view of AIDS. "I began to
see it as a problem in our own
community when I met young
people, and people in the hetero
sexual community with AIDS.
For example, I met a woman who
was a year younger than me who
was HIV-positive. She'd caught it
from her boyfriend. That hit
home. I thought that kind of
thing could never happen to
someone like me," Mawson
added.
"I'd like to ride my bike around
the world some day," she added.

nights in different towns and
cities to perform community ser
vice. "They depend on the gen
erosity of others and the local
community service that they do
can be a catalyst for local hero
ism," Ahmad said.
Ahmad said he hoped to start
something that would last, unlike
other new, highly publicized but
temporary public-service organi
zations. "When we started Bike
Aid there were things like Live
Aid and Hands Across America
starting up. We were looking at
founding something a little bit

more grass-rootsy, not as glitzy,
something that would not be a
flash in the pan," he said.
Ahmad reasoned that a cross
country bike trip would be a suit
able context for mainstream
America's involvement with
international development issues
due to cycling's universal usage.
"Cycling is the most common
form of transportation, other
than walking, in the world," he
said.
When it started, Bike Aid had
no regular corporate financial
support, depending mostly on
students and volunteers.
"We had little money and little
experience but it made us pretty
resourceful." Ahmad said. "We
faced extraordinary skepticism
when getting started. I went to a
foundation to ask for some
money, and the person said, 'I
could give you some money but
that would make you think that it
could be done. I won't extend
your agony by giving you false
hope.' "
Ahmad said that the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service and former
University President Donald
Kennedy both proved particularly
instrumental to the student orga
nization.
The students' dedication to

the cause, Ahmad added, was
most helpful in realizing Bike
Aid.
"I worked in a tiny office in the
[BechtelJ International Center
with Sean Skelton. We were going
like mad, making zillions of phone
calls, barely getting by in a tiny
little office," Bower recalled.
"The first thing we had to do
was put together a brochure. It
was rough. Lots of hand-folding
and printing. We mailed them to
all college campuses in the coun
try," he added.
As Ahmad hoped, Bike Aid has
lasted. "It has been sort of like
working on one's dream in a way,
so you get pretty devoted. The
first three years I spent a lot of
time on it, as did many others
involved. My personal role dimin
ished relatively after that. I chair
the board, but it's a shared lead
ership now," he said.
Ahmad commented on how
Bike Aid has changed over time.
"We haven't really expanded
much in size, but we've gained a
lot in quality. We've learned from
our mistakes. It's more focused
now. Now, Bike Aid has a new
unifying theme for community
service every year," he said.
The year Mawson went on the
trip, the theme was AIDS aware

ness. "We had an HIV-positive
person with our group. Working
with him made me feel less
accomplished, because there I
was, a healthy young woman,
fully able to ride across country.
He's still not fully diagnosed with
the AIDS virus, but he's not
asymptomatic. He had lots of dif
ficulties — especially fatigue —
which made our sore butts seem
less important," she said.
Mawson's group worked at an
AIDS hospice in Utah, did chores
for AIDS patients who were
unable to leave their houses,
made safer sex packets and, since
they were in the neighborhood,
also undertook some flood victim
relief in Missouri.
The experience changed Maw
son's view of AIDS. "I began to
see it as a problem in our own
community when I met young
people, and people in the hetero
sexual community with AIDS.
For example, I met a woman who
was a year younger than me who
was HIV-positive. She'd caught it
from her boyfriend. That hit
home. I thought that kind of
thing could never happen to
someone like me," Mawson
added.
"I'd like to ride my bike around
the world some day," she added.
