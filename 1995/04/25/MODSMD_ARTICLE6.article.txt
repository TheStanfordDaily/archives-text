## Race in June may be last for Stanford's solar car 
### Sonia M. Giordani 
Afterburner, Stanford's third solar car, will race for
the first time this June in Sunrayce 1995. But the
1,800-mile trip from Indiana to Colorado may be the
last for the Stanford Solar Car Project.
The six-year-old student group may end construc
tion due to the difficulties involved in raising funds, a
lack of broad-based student commitment and the grad
uation of leading project members.
"I have told the students that the project is coming
to an end with this race," explained Senior Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs for the School of Engineering John
Bravman, a materials science engineering professor.
Funding for the project has come from ASSU spe
cial fees and generous donations from corporations
such as Boeing, which donated a $60,000 mold with
which students crafted the Afterburner's body. Funds
also came from the project members' fund-raising ef
forts.
Funding fell short despite the team's "amazingdili
gence to get outside funds," Bravman said. "The
School of Engineering has ended up financing more
than it hoped to."
Money is not the only problem for the project. An
other critical concern is student participation. When
the deadline to fde a special-fee request came around,
project leaders — co-terminal student Christopher
Shaw, senior lan Hutagalung and juniors Dorian West
and Katherine Von Re is — could not guarantee that
the project would not be burned out after Sunrayce
1995. All four leaders will have graduated by Sunrayce
1997, leaving commitment to the group uncertain at
best.
"I think it is fair to say that this project has suc
ceeded because of the grit and determination, the ded
ication and entrepreneurship of a small number of stu
dents," Bravman said.
According to Shaw, who has worked with the pro
ject for the last five years, the questions were a matter
of goals, leadership and funds.
"The excitement has worn off. There is less and less
student involvement — students willing to take up the
