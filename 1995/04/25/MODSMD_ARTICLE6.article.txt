## Race in June may be last for Stanford's solar car 
### Sonia M. Giordani 
Afterburner, Stanford's third solar car, will race for
the first time this June in Sunrayce 1995. But the
1,800-mile trip from Indiana to Colorado may be the
last for the Stanford Solar Car Project.
The six-year-old student group may end construc
tion due to the difficulties involved in raising funds, a
lack of broad-based student commitment and the grad
uation of leading project members.
"I have told the students that the project is coming
to an end with this race," explained Senior Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs for the School of Engineering John
Bravman, a materials science engineering professor.
Funding for the project has come from ASSU spe
cial fees and generous donations from corporations
such as Boeing, which donated a $60,000 mold with
which students crafted the Afterburner's body. Funds
also came from the project members' fund-raising ef
forts.
Funding fell short despite the team's "amazingdili
gence to get outside funds," Bravman said. "The
School of Engineering has ended up financing more
than it hoped to."
Money is not the only problem for the project. An
other critical concern is student participation. When
the deadline to fde a special-fee request came around,
project leaders — co-terminal student Christopher
Shaw, senior lan Hutagalung and juniors Dorian West
and Katherine Von Re is — could not guarantee that
the project would not be burned out after Sunrayce
1995. All four leaders will have graduated by Sunrayce
1997, leaving commitment to the group uncertain at
best.
"I think it is fair to say that this project has suc
ceeded because of the grit and determination, the ded
ication and entrepreneurship of a small number of stu
dents," Bravman said.
According to Shaw, who has worked with the pro
ject for the last five years, the questions were a matter
of goals, leadership and funds.
"The excitement has worn off. There is less and less
student involvement — students willing to take up the
eigns and put in the time," Shaw
said. In terms of funding, Shaw
noted that budget cuts have
squeezed departments and that
companies are less willing to
donate materials to the project for
its third car.
Student commitment to the
Solar Car Project is by necessity
intense, given the nature of the
project which demands that stu
dents completely build and assem
ble the car within a limited budget.
West, a mechanical engineering
m*\jor in his second year with the
project, said he commits 60 to 80
hours each week. "You can't
expect to spend only a couple of
hours each week — you can't build
a whole suspension or steering sys

tem like that," he said.
When West joined in 1993, he
said that about 60 people attended
a project meeting. "After that, the
number dropped off exponential
ly," West said. Although there is a
lot of interest, he added, the sheer
hours of work are daunting to stu
dents.
Though a time-intensive and
challenging venture, Assoc.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Mark Mungal said the project
offers invaluable hands-on experi
ence — for students willing to
make a commitment.
"There aren't very many 'co-op'
experiences," said Hutagalung, a
chemical engineering major. He
added that Stanford engineering
classes take a very classroom-ori
ented approach.
Combining academics and
hands-on experience may be one
approach to saving the project.

The Department of Mechanical
Engineering is discussing
prospects for increasing students'
motivation to get involved by inte
grating hands-on projects such as
the solar car and the hybrid elec
tric car into the formal curriculum
"so that students won't feel so dis
connected from what they are
studying," said Mungal, the pro
ject's advisor.
Bravman agreed that the pro
ject will have to be re-vamped if it
is to continue. At other schools
with successful programs, some
150 students and a dozen faculty
members are voluntarily involved.
"The conditions are really differ
ent," he said. "You can't make it
happen by command."
MungEd said he sees a tenuous
future for the project. "I really
don't know if it will continue —
it's really in the hands of the stu
dents," he said.
