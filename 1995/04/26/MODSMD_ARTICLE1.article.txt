### Elisabeth Morse Staff writer 
The Supreme Court of the Navajo Nation con
vened today at the Stanford Law School to hear ar
guments on whether three schools on Native
American land are private and therefore not re
quired to follow Navajo Nation procedures in
choosing their governing boards.
The Supreme Court listened to arguments in
the Rough Rock Community School v. Navajo Na
tion case outside its customary courtroom in Win

dow Rock, Ariz., for the fourth time ever in the
court's existence.
Chief Justice Robert Yazzie said it is important
to hold Navajo Nation hearings in universities to
accurately depict Navajo judiciary processes.
"There is a conception that Indian judges do not
have a notion of due process, and we are here to say
that those conceptions are incorrect," he said.
In addition to Yazzie, the Supreme Court in
cludes Assoc. Justices Wayne Cadman and Ray-
