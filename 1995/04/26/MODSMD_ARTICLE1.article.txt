# Navajo Supreme Court hears case at Stanford Law School

### Elisabeth Morse Staff writer 
The Supreme Court of the Navajo Nation con
vened today at the Stanford Law School to hear ar
guments on whether three schools on Native
American land are private and therefore not re
quired to follow Navajo Nation procedures in
choosing their governing boards.
The Supreme Court listened to arguments in
the Rough Rock Community School v. Navajo Na
tion case outside its customary courtroom in Win

dow Rock, Ariz., for the fourth time ever in the
court's existence.
Chief Justice Robert Yazzie said it is important
to hold Navajo Nation hearings in universities to
accurately depict Navajo judiciary processes.
"There is a conception that Indian judges do not
have a notion of due process, and we are here to say
that those conceptions are incorrect," he said.
In addition to Yazzie, the Supreme Court in
cludes Assoc. Justices Wayne Cadman and Ray-

Three justices of the Supreme Court of the Navajo Nation hear a case about schools on Native Amer
ican land in the Law School yesterday. One of the judges, Raymond D. Austin, is a visiting profes
sor at the Law School.
mond Austin, who is a visiting
professor at the Law School.
Lawrence Ruzow, attorney for
Rough Rock, argued that as com
munity schools — or privately
run schools which receive federal
aid — the three schools do not
fall under the jurisdiction of the
Navtyo Nation.
One of the schools is located in
Arizona and the other two are in
New Mexico.
The definition of a private
school was also debated between
Ruzow and Frank Seanez, attor
ney for the Navajo Nation.
Whereas Ruzow claimed that
a private school is a school char
tered by a sovereign, which sets
its own personnel policy and
determines its own curriculum,

Seanez argued that private
schools charge tuition — a prac
tice that the group of community
schools discussed in the case do
not follow.
If the community schools were
ruled private, Ruzow said, the
Navtyo Nation would have the
right to regulate the schools in
aspects such as employment
preferences, mandatory atten
dance and possibly the mandato
ry placement of the Navajo lan
guage on curricula.
Ruzow also claimed that fed
eral funding would probably not
be jeopardized if the schools were
determined to be private, as they
would still be considered tribal
organizations and thus eligible
for funding.
The schools were originally
organized under the laws of the
Navajo Nation, Seanez said.
Therefore, even though they
later chose to incorporate under

state laws, their status as com
munity schools should not
change.
Ruzow began his argument
with a brief history of the educa
tion of Native Americans.
"Prior to European contact,
Navajo education was communi
ty-based. Education had a local,
community focus," Ruzow said.
With the arrival of Europeans,
he said, Navajo children were
taken away from their communi
ties and given largely "Anglo"
educations.
The goal of schools such as
Rough Rock is to bring the
responsibility of education back
into individual communities,
Ruzow said.
He also raised the issue of
qualifications for becoming a
school board member — under
Navajo Nation laws, board mem
bers must have some type of pre
vious experience as educators.

Ruzow said this requirement
might prevent certain members
of the Navajo community from
joining the school boards.
Seanez said that even though
certain members of the Navajo
tribe could potentially be prohib
ited from becoming board mem
bers, no one has ever been reject
ed or has filed a complaint about
the requirements.
The justices interrupted both
attorneys regularly throughout
the hearings to ask questions.
"These judges and federal
judges are extremely forceful in
the way they ask questions," said
Lydia Fillingham, a second-year
law student who watched the
case yesterday.
"We try to instill as much tra
dition and custom as possible,
with values such as kinship and
respectability," Cadman said of
the Navajo judiciary process.
"Indians generally don't inter

rupt each other."
"The Navajo Supreme Court
is an imposition of Western-style
adjudication," Yazzie said.
A written decision for the case
should be issued in two to three
months, Yazzie said. All court
room discussion took place yes
terday.
Cases tried by the Navajo
Supreme Court are decided first
according to tribal custom and
tradition, then tribal codes, state
and federal law. However, past
cases are used only for guidance,
not precedence.
Navajo disputes are also
often resolved by a process
called "peacemaking," which
involves both parties coming
together without courtroom
mediators to discuss their
grievances.
Peacemaking "is about heal
ing. Win or lose is not the ulti
mate goal," Yazzie said.
