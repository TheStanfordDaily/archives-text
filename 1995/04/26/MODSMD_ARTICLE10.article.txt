Ginger Rogers dies at 83
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ginger Rogers, whose
glittering string of Depression-era musicals with
Fred Astaire helped Americans forget the empti
ness of their wallets and the grumbling in their
stomachs, died yesterday. She was 83.
Rogers, who won an Oscar for the 1940 drama
"Kitty Foyle," died at her home in Rancho Mirage
near Palm Springs.
She became one of Hollywood's highest-paid
female stars in the 19405, appearing in hits such
as "The Major and the Minor," "Lady in the
Dark" and "Weekend at the Waldorf."
But it was her celluloid partnership with
Astaire that made her a legend.
Labor costs down
WASHINGTON (AP) — Fresh reports show

labor costs rising at the slowest pace on record,
consumer confidence in the economy jumping
to a five-year high and falling mortgage rates
helping to revive sales of existing homes.
Analysts said the reports yesterday were
consistent with the Federal Reserve's goal of a
slower but still-growing economy and low infla
tion.
The Labor Department said its Employment
Cost Index edged up just 2.9 percent in the year
ending March 31, the smallest increase since it
began tracking worker pay and benefits in
1981. The increase was held back by the slowest
growth on record in the cost of benefits, such as
health care.
The index is considered one of the best
gauges of wage inflation pressures since
employee compensation represents about two
thirds of the cost of a product.
