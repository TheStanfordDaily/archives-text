OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -
Two brothers in Michigan were
linked in conspiracy charges yes
terday with Oklahoma bombing
suspect Timothy McVeigh, and a
motel manager in Kansas said he
recognized the man in a new FBI
sketch of "John Doe 2" as a ner
vous guest with a foreign accent.
The fast-breaking develop
ments in two states came as res
cuers raked through the rubble for
bodies and this grieving city con
tinued to bury its dead. The pace
of recovering bodies quickened
and the death toll rose to 96.
In Michigan, federal prosecutors
charged James Nichols, a 41-year
old farmer, and his brother, Terry,
40, with conspiring to make explo
sive devices. They were accused of
conspiring with McVeigh, the 27-

year-old Army veteran charged in
the explosion that destroyed the
Alfred P. Murrah federal building
last Wednesday.
A court affidavit said James
Nichols told FBI agents last Fri
day that McVeigh "had the knowl
edge to manufacture a bomb" and
that the three men made "bottle
bombs" in 1992. Last year, the
Nichols brothers made small
explosive devices, the court docu
ment said.
McVeigh was not accused in the
Michigan case and the charges
against the Nichols brothers are
not related to the Oklahoma
bombing, authorities said. The
brothers each face a maximum 20-
year prison sentence and $500,000
fine on the counts.
In Washington, a federal law

enforcement official said the vehi
cle McVeigh was driving when he
was stopped for traffic violations
shortly after the bombing showed
traces of nitrates and high explo
sives, but that it was not yet possi
ble to conclusively link them to
the bombing.
The FBI released an enhanced
sketch of the most wanted man in
America, a square-jawed individu
al linked to the nation's deadliest
domestic terrorist attack.
In Junction City, Kan., the
manager of the Great Western Inn
said he recognized the sketch as
the man who stayed in Room 107
on April 17 â€” two days before the
bombing.
"He spoke broken English. He
was not 100 percent American,"
said the manager.
