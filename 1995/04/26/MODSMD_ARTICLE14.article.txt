Stanford should cut out
weaker classes instead of
imposing a science core

IN THEIR continuing efforts to
reform the University's system
of undergraduate require
ments, Stanford faculty and
administrators are pushing for a
new science core.
The core would consist of three
courses, arranged into tracks
much like the current Cultures,
Ideas and Values program. It
would replace the three mathe
matics- and science-oriented dis
tribution requirements.
However, just as CIV has fre
quently fallen prey to large cours
es filled with disinterested stu
dents and professors, a science
core would not likely accomplish
the faculty's objectives.
The problems which they raise
regarding the current DR system
center around the fact that stu
dents can squeak by without tak
ing "real" science courses.
To solve this problem, the facul
ty should remove courses from the
math and science DR lists which
do not live up to their expectation
of what a real science course
should be.
Although students in "fuzzy"
majors may complain that courses
such as "Natural Hazards and
Man" are necessary for the non
technically inclined, there does
exist an important set of knowl
edge which any student should be
required to study.
The scientific method, mathe
matical proof techniques and
other concepts introduced in these
courses can aid students in any
future endeavor.
In much the same way, students
in "techie" majors are required to
take no less than eight social sci
ence, philosophy and humanities
courses because of the lessons they
can learn — how to write a paper,
for example.
While it is important that any

liberal arts college maintain both
breadth and depth in its curricu
lum, Stanford should also strive to
offer students as wide a range of
choices as possible. But the facul
ty's science core proposal over
steps the amount of change that
the University's system of require
ments needs.
It will likely devolve into the
same sort of tracked systems
under which freshmen groan each
year in CIV Rather than taking
upper-level courses, students will
be required to take classes which
are specifically marked as require
ments.
In addition, students who are
considering majoring in the sci
ences — the core will not be
required — will have difficulties if
they later on conclude that they
would rather major in the human
ities. Suddenly, they would be
required to take a three-quarter
sequence of classes despite the fact
that they already took some cours
es in the sciences.
In this way, the science core will
further limit Stanford students'
academic options — forcing them
to put themselves on one side of
the science / humanities barrier
the moment they arrive on cam
pus.
This is a poor way to run a top
university like Stanford; the facul
ty should encourage experimenta
tion and breadth rather than
scripting students' curricula
before their first, day of class.
Courses which clearly do not
introduce students to the sciences
should be dropped from the list of
DRs. And if the list becomes too
small, the University should strive
to teach more reasonably rigorous
courses — and add those to the list
instead.
Rather than dramatically
changing the system once again,
Stanford should weed out DR
courses that are two easy. Once
that is accomplished, the other
math and sciences courses which
already satisfy DRs will be ade
quate to teach students the funda
mentals of those fields.
