College radio should expose students to new music

IN THEIR LETTER of April 19, Mark
Lawrence and Alex Gould rightly
point out some of the factual errors
and truly bizarre assertions that The
Daily used to justify its recommendation
against funding the KZSU. Their replies
to The Daily's claims that the station
should get a subscription to The New
York Times instead of maintaining an
AP wire, that the University should pay
for the station's emergency functions,
and that the size of the fee request is too
large stand on their own and do not need
further elaboration.
Strangely, Lawrence and Gould did
not respond to The Daily's claim that
KZSU should not be funded because it
does plays "obscure music" rather than
the "popular music" that all Stanford
students presumably want to hear. In
making this claim, The Daily displays a
sad ignorance of the purpose of college
radio stations — and indeed, of the col
lege experience as a whole. KZSU does
not play the popular music that you can

hear on all the big-time radio stations
located in the Bay Area, and that is
exactly as it should be.
One of the main purposes of college
radio is to provide a forum for the kinds
of music that do not fit into the narrow
ly market-minded, programming selec
tion that the owners of commercial sta
tions think will appeal to the target
audiences that their advertisers are try
ing to reach. By providing a forum for
such non-commercial music, college
radio functions somewhat like public
radio and television — and all of the
arguments that have been made in favor
of those media can also be made in favor
of KZSU.
But it is not as a public service nor as
a favor to "corporate strangers" that col
lege radio stations like KZSU choose to
play non-commercial music. College
radio stations play an eclectic assort
ment of unusual, experimental and off
the-beaten-path forms of music precisely
because one of the purposes of going to

college in the first place is to broaden
one's perspective. While attending a uni
versity, students expect to encounter
new and challenging ideas in their class
es and to think in ways that they would
not normally think.
They expect to meet people with back
grounds different from their own and to
encounter a variety of cultural perspec
tives. They expect to see the drama
department put on plays that they
haven't already seen, and they expect to
take classes on subjects that they know
relatively little about. They should also
expect the college radio station to play
music that they are not already familiar
with. KZSU allows students to expose
themselves to kinds of music that they
cannot hear elsewhere. It provides a
unique opportunity for them to discover
that they enjoy a type of music that they
would otherwise never have known
about.
Is everyone in the student body going
to enjoy every strain of music that KZSU

plays? Of course not. But if students
take the time to listen to a variety of
shows played on KZSU and think of the
time they spend listening to the station
as part of the horizon-broadening experi
ence of being at a place like Stanford,
then they can profit from it as much as
the "techie" who takes a class on literary
theory or the freshman from a small
Midwestern town who shares a room
with a student from Zambia.
To criticize KZSU for playing unusu
al, non-commercial music makes about
as much sense as chiding your professors
for asking you to read books that aren't
on the current best-seller list. Do the
editors of The Daily approach other
aspects of Stanford life with the same
closed-minded "Give us what we already
know and like" attitude? If not, why do
they make an exception for KZSU? If so,
then why are they in college in the first
place?
