# The
						Daily lags behind other college papers by not being on the Web
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily is extremely far
behind other college newspapers in uti
lizing electronic publishing. As of March
13, there were at least 21 daily campus
newspapers available through the World
Wide Web (see http://beacon
www.asa.utk.edu/resources/papers.html
for a listing of these)
These papers come from top schools
such as Yale, Princeton and Brown,
and provide an extremely useful
means of obtaining local information
whenever you have access to the Web.
For current students, it can provide
means of searching both current and
past issues of The Daily for useful

information. For the vast number of
alumni on-line, Internet access to The
Daily would provide an excellent
means of keeping in touch with their
alma mater. Let's get with the pro
gram and increase the accessibility of
The Daily.
