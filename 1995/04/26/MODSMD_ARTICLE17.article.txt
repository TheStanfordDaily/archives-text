# Stanford students should boycott new cafe which does not allow reading
## 
### 
I am writing to call on all Stanford
University students, staff and faculty to
boycott the recently-opened University
Cafe on University Avenue for its dis
crimination against students. The cafe
has a policy prohibiting anyone from

reading, doing paperwork, using laptop
computers and so forth at its tables after
6 p.m. — a policy necessarily aimed pri
marily at our community — and of kick
ing out those who violate this rule.
The evening of April 24, I was quiet
ly grading papers as I sipped an outra
geously-priced cup of coffee and nib
bled at a brownie. A woman named
Chantal Turner came up to me and
told me that I would have to leave
unless I was willing to move to the
extremely cramped counter. There
were several tables free at this time,
and I told her that I would be happy to
share the space if other people wanted
to sit at the table. She said this would
not be acceptable and told me I had to
leave. She then claimed she was the
manager, that I was now trespassing
and that if I did not vacate the premis
es that she would call the police. She
promptly did this and had me evicted

from the cafe — for sitting quietly at a
table with some papers!
Several other people in the cafe were
also harassed by her, including a man
reading a book and a woman with a
portable computer, and the officer who
came to the scene informed me that the
Palo Alto police had been there that
evening several times to throw people
out for such "offenses." He also said
that he knew of no other establishment
in Palo Alto with a similar rule.
The University Cafe's policy is not
only bad business sense; it is also a
direct insult to our community and a
frivolous waste of valuable police time.
Few businesses in this area would sur
vive without Stanford's support; I there
fore encourage students to make their
economic power felt by shunning this
horrible place.
