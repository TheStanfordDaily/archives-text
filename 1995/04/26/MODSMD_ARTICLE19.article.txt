## An intolerant atmosphere 
### 
BEFORE I CAME to Stanford in
1991, I'd always dreamed of col
lege as the epitome of free thought
and debate, a place where every view
point from the far left to the far right
and everything in between was repre
sented and tolerated. I even saw the
overhaul of the Western Civilization
program at Stanford as a positive exam
ple of this notion. Cultures from all over
the world would now be represented in a
required introductory freshman course,
giving students a wide range of view
points and opinions. I couldn't wait to
be exposed to new thoughts and ideas at
Stanford, and to hear them discussed
and debated in a liberated and educated
atmosphere.
Well, my first expectation was satis
fied more than I'd ever expected. Stan
ford classes encouraged me to delve
deeply into every new idea or theory to
which I was exposed. Even now, I have
no complaints about the wealth of new
ideas which Stanford introduced to me.
Unfortunately, I realized by my
sophomore year that my second expecta
tion of Stanford as a tolerant atmo
sphere for free speech and debate had
been dashed. In fact, I can even remem
ber the moment I realized this fact. Dur
ing a class discussion, the subject of gov
ernment reparations for African-Ameri
cans was raised.
Now, the suggestion of reparations to
the descendants of slaves is controver

sial to say the least, and one cannot
expect everybody to agree with the idea.
But when a student raised his objections
to the idea in a calm and thoughtful
manner to the class, he was literally
shouted down by other members of the
group, accused of racism and insensitiv
ity. I noticed during the rest of the quar
ter that this student rarely raised his
hand in class again. In fact, the discus
sions in general grew weaker as the
quarter progressed, as fewer and fewer
people were willing to disagree with or
even just talk about controversial sub
jects. I often left that class disappointed
and angry that many intelligent and
insightful students felt too intimidated
to contradict the most vocal viewpoint.
However, my experiences in that
class pale in comparison to the acts of a
group of students this past autumn. I
am sure that everybody is now familiar
with the Stanford Review and the con
troversy over its "Smoke Signals" col
umn, which depicted an uncomplimen
tary caricature of a Native American
chief.
I understand and agree with the con
cerns of Native American students that
the chief was offensive and did not at all
represent their incredibly rich heritage.
I was encouraged to see that an open
discussion between the editors of the
Review and a group of concerned stu
dents took place. However, this only
came after a number of students

bypassed discussing the issue with the
Review staff and instead took their con
cerns directly to President Gerhard
Casper, demanding that he take away
the University's support of the newspa
per. Even worse, these students also
called upon the Stanford community to
take the remaining issues of the Review
from its distribution points and destroy
them, thus depriving individual stu
dents from forming their own opinions
on the matter.
Stanford University is a symbol of
the availability and excellence of higher
education in the United States. But it
appears that the principles upon which
America was founded are no longer rep
resented on this campus. Once a group
of students attempts to deprive its peers
from forming their own judgments or
from stating their personal opinions on
controversial issues, this university can
no longer portray itself as a democratic
or "liberal" institution. How can we ever
expect Stanford to be a world-renowned
bastion of new ideas and open debate
when many residents of the community
are too intimidated to raise an opposing
view?

Amanda encourages freshmen to speak
their mind in CIV section, and if anyone
yells at them, to refer them to her.
