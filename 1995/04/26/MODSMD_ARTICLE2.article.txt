# Schools will suffer having no increases for inflation
## As belts tighten, class sizes grow and TA ranks diminish 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
With no budget adjustment for inflation, the Uni
versity's seven undergraduate and graduate schools
will be among the hardest hit by next year's round of
budget cuts.
Budgets for the Schools of Humanities and Sci
ences, Engineering, Earth Sciences, Business, Educa
tion, Medicine and Law will be held flat at nominal dol
lars, Provost Condoleezza Rice announced at a Faculty
Senate meeting last week.
The cuts — which are part of the University's plan
to trim $ 18 million from its budget over three years —
reflect that the budgets are not being adjusted for in
flation, which is currently 3.5 percent. In the 1995-96
fiscal year, the second year of the plan, $6 million will
be cut from the University's budget, Rice said.
Some of the biggest cuts will translate into an in
crease in section sizes for classes in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences as teaching assistant positions
are cut, said the school's dean John Shoven.
Plans for sections taught by TAs call for a 10-per
cent increase in size.
Although fewer TA positions will be available,
Shoven said the school is still committed to support
ing graduate students for their first four years. Fifth
and sixth-year graduate students will be most affect
ed by the change, he said.
"It's certainly not a pleasure to announce that
step," Shoven said.
The School of Humanities and Sciences, which last
year had a base operating budget of about $86 million,
faces a 2 percent loss, which Shoven said is "$1.6 mil
lion short of what we would need to continue every
thing we're doing this year."
Shoven said the school may face a smaller cut be
cause of negotiations with the University. "By em
phasizing the centrality of the school to the Universi
ty, we have made a strong case to the provost for allo
cating more resources to us, with some success," he
said in his State of the School Address yesterday.
More money will be made up by "selective staff re
ductions," Shoven said. These cuts will come "mostly

through attrition.... When vacancies occur, we'll ask
if jobs can be restructured," he said.
Shoven said he had no specific numbers for the
amount of staff who might be affected.
Faculty computer money has also been eliminated
from the provisions the University provides, Shoven
said. Gifts and other fundraising will compensate for
that money, he said.
This year's base budgets for the other schools,
which will remain steady in nominal dollars for next
year, are as follows: $5.7 million for the School of
Earth Sciences; $36 million for the School of Engi
neering; $8 million for the School of Education; $25
million for the Graduate School of Business; $15.7
million for the Law School; and $64.6 million for the
School of Medicine.
Law School Dean Paul Brest said his school hopes
to avoid layoffs, though he said he didn't have specific
figures for how much money the school would lose.
Deans of the other schools could not be reached for
comment.
"We're tightening our belts," said Brest. "It's all
over the place. It's a mixture of budget cutting here
and there, but I think we can do it without layoffs.
"I don't think it's worse than past years," he added.
"All parts of the University have to share in a Univer
sity-wide problem and I just don't think you can deal
with an amount [of cuts] that size and exempt any
part of the University."
Although a 2-percent cut represents "a major
amount of money," Shoven said, "I don't think the...
picture is bleak. The belt is tight, but it's not exces
sively tight."
The school will be able to make the cuts, he said.
"But I'm not trying to say it will be painless."
Because the University and the school are plan
ning for possible decreases in federal funding, the
budget situation could end up differently than expect
ed, Shoven said.
"Things might evolve better than or worse than
the contingency plans," he said. "We're recognizing
that there are dark clouds coming off of Washington,
