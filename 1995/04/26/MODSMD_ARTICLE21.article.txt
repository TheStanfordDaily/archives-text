## Henry Robles 'Obnoxious' undergrads should be barred from law library 
### 
OK, I'M only going to say this once:
Undergrads should be banned from
Crown Law Library. That's right.
Purged. Expelled. Banished. Barred.
It's not that hard to do. Just give law
students a special sticker to affix to their
student IDs. You got the sticker, you're in.
You don't, you're out. Simple as that. Prob
lem solved. Coffee Nips all around.
Don't misunderstand. I don't have any
thing against undergrads in themselves.
They can't help being obnoxious, supercil
ious, arrogant or misguided. It comes with
the status. But can't they be themselves
somewhere else? Our existence as law stu
dents is tortured enough without having to
endure contact with the undergraduate
species, thank you very much.
Besides, they have two libraries of their
own in which to conduct their social hour
or exchange Secrets to Beautiful Nails.
Huge libraries. I mean, have you seen
Meyer? The U.S.S. Enterprise could land in
the middle of it without so much as stirring
dust off the shelves. And Green! The banis
ters in the stairwell are made of polished

chrome, my dear.
Of course, I suppose one can't blame
undergrads for being curious about the law
library. They don't know any better. It's
only natural for them to fantasize about
exchanging coy winks and furtive glances
with law students across tables in the fed
room or about having lusty encounters
with future Supreme Court justices among
the forbidden stacks stored in the cage in
the library basement.
Lusty encounters, cage, forbidden
stacks It's no wonder the mere thought
of making a trip to the law library is
enough to send undergrad imaginations
into overdrive, conjuring up visions of a
flesh circus the likes of which have not been
seen since the last days of Caligula.
I wouldn't be so opposed to undergrads
in the law library if they actually used
library resources or if they actually — gasp!
— studied. But they seem to think that the
sign at the law library entrance — "No
Food. Drinks Okay." — is a license to use
Crown as a place to cool off after their Buns
of Steel workout.
Take, for example, the cutesy couple I

encountered on the first floor the other
day. He: tall, baseball cap, sport sandals,
athletic shorts. She: frosty lipstick, pony
tail, aerobic shoes, athletic shorts. Juice
Club poster children. Y'all know the kind.
So, anyway, there I was, minding my
own, casually searching for a lost volume of
the Securities Law Reporter when I heard
what seemed to be the water being drained
out of deGuerre Pool. Startled, I peeked
around a stack to investigate, and there at
a carrel sat Biff and Betty, their lips locked
around drinking straws, fervently sucking
the life out of what was once 32 ounces of
thirst-quenching Juice Club power.
Don't you know I tried to be friendly.
"Would you mind enjoying your drink
more quietly?" I said. "The noise is really
distracting."
I expected them to yield to someone with
actual authority to be in the library. I
didn't expect to be leveled with a jujitsu
chop of logic and reason.
"Hey man," Biff said, using the back of
his hand to wipe fruity froth from the cor
ners of his mouth, "The sign said 'Drinks
Okay.' This is a drink. So it's okay."

Staggering, isn't it?
A friend tells me a similar thing hap
pened to him. There he was in his carrel on
the third floor, poring through a volume of
antitrust, when suddenly he felt the collec
tive IQ of the room plummet faster than
the Mexican stock market. He turned
around just in time to see undergrads
Junior and Veronica take over the carrel a
few feet away and start a game of You Say
Something, I Giggle. At first, my friend
decided to ignore them.
But the giggling was just too much.
"Excuse me," my friend said finally, mak
ing sure to address Veronica. "Would you
mind going somewhere else to talk? I'm
really trying to study."
Veronica — horrified, of course — made
this smacking noise with her lips. "But the
books I need are in here," she moaned.
I mean. The mall is that way.
I'm telling you, there's no reasoning
with these people. It's too bad D-Con
doesn't make an undergraduate-size ver
sion of their popular Roach Trap. It would
be the perfect answer to a pesky problem.
"And no messy residue!"

Of course, it wouldn't fix the other prob
lem of bike-riding undergrad desperados
tearing through Law School breezeways,
terrorizing law students and sending law
faculty scurrying for cover. But at least
that problem would be kept outside.
Inside the library, the tables would
remain free of old issues of Glamour and
Cosmo. The stalls in the men's bathroom
would not be inscribed with this month's
installment of Contemporary Fecal Verse.
The carrels once again would be occupied
by diligent law students reading and brief
ing cases for tax class.
For now, such a blissful state will have
to remain imaginary. The world would be
such a better place if Stanford administra
tors listened to me. Who knows? Maybe
they're reading this right now. Attention,
Condi Rice! Repeat after me: "Undergrads
should be banned from the law library."
That's right. Purged. Expelled. Banished.
Barred.
Oops. I forgot I was only going to say
that once.
