Valentin Y. Mudimbe, a professor in the
Department of French and Italian, delivered
the keynote speech for Africa Week last night,
speaking on the week's theme: "Education,
Knowledge, and Africa."
This year's theme is unique in that it "pon
ders the nature of things and the fate of the
human race," said Motlatsi Mokoena, presi
dent of the Stanford African Students Associ
ation, which organizes the annual event.
The purpose of this year's Africa Week —■
which will run through Saturday — is to
encourage Westerners to rethink the way they
view the world, according to Mokoena.
"Education, knowledge, Africa. These
things are about representing and transform
ing something that is out there and letting it
materialize into another text, another experi
ence, another vision," Mudimbe said.
Mudimbe encouraged his audience in Bech
tel International Center last night to abolish
old concepts of race, gender and difference
among cultures while reconceptualizing a dia
logue and belief system more inclusive of all
cultures.
"We need a rethinking of the politics of col
laboration among different cultures on the

basis of the fact that we have to live and share
our intellectual and epistemological experi
ences," Mudimbe said.
Mudimbe challenged the arbitrary nature
used in defining race, drawing laughter from
the crowd when he argued that it is just as
senseless to divide racial groups based on bio
logical differences such as lactose tolerance as
it is to judge people on the basis of their out
ward appearance.

No one is born an African,
European or American. One
becomes an African, Euro
pean or American.
— Valentin Y. Mudimbe

"Don't judge me, please follow me,"
Mudimbe said.
Mudimbe — who was educated in Zaire,
France and Belgium — also stressed the
importance of being aware of the paradoxes of
education and the promotion of knowledge in
Africa.
He contrasted the idea that Africa is
"under-scholarized" relative to Asian and

European countries — as one person out of
four residing in Saharan countries is illiterate
— to the idea that Africa is "hyper-scholar
ized" as the financial support for African edu
cation is 10 times superior to that of some
Western European countries.
Mudimbe criticized the Western perpetua
tion of certain dichotomies — such as primitive
/ civilized, abnormal / normal and
educated / illiterate — as being essential parts
of reality. Rather than being concrete, univer
sal actualities, he argued, these classifications
are mere conceptual tools which allow people to
analyze and structure what they are perceiving.
"No one is born an African, European or
American. One becomes an African, European
or American. No one is born a woman, a male,
but one becomes these things through pro
cesses of education and socialization,"
Mudimbe said. "It is education we should
think about."
The remainder of Africa Week includes a
panel discussion by linguistics scholars and
South African Stanford students today, a cul
tural night tomorrow featuring a variety of
entertainment and Africa Night as the final
event on Saturday. Africa Night will include
dinner, dancing, performances and a recogni
tion of successful Africans throughout the
Bav Area.
