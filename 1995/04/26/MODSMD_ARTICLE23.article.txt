## And the leaves that are green turn to brown

:Why do leaves turn colors in the fall?
â€” curious in Columbae
A:l'm not sure why somebody would be asking
me this now, instead of a few months ago when
it would have been a bit more apropos. Howev
er, I'm going to go with the hunch that they were
enjoying the rolling green Foothills and wondering
why it all has to be so ephemeral. In any case, here's
the low-down on leaf color.
Hopefully you all remember from high school that
the green color in plants is due to chlorophyll, the
large molecule which absorbs light to produce energy
in that wonderful process known as photosynthesis.
When the leaves change color in the fall, it's due to
the fact that this chlorophyll is being removed from
the leaves. With all the green removed from the leaf,
you see the colors that are left.
The yellowish color of many leaves is due to caroti
noid pigments, which are related to vitamin A and

other anti-oxidants that are found in vegetables. In
fact, these molecules actually serve a similar function
in plants as they do in the human body.
In humans, anti-oxidants are responsible for scav
enging oxidants (so it's not just a clever name). Oxi
dants are a family of molecules which can break
down and damage other molecules in the body, oxi
dizing them much like a rusting a piece of metal. Oxi
dants are believed to be responsible for the aging of
the body and even cancer and other diseases, so eat
your veggies.
In a plant, the carotinoids serve to protect the
fragile chlorophyll molecule from light that is too
intense. In mutant plants, which are missing the
carotinoids, the leaf will look green in faint light, but
will bleach out in bright light, as the chlorophyll is
destroyed. Through various processes, it seems that
if too much light hits the plant, oxidants that are pro
duced will quickly damage the chlorophyll. Hence the
need for anti-oxidants.
But if the carotinoids are there to ju-otect the
chlorophyll, why don't they get removed with the
chlorophyll? You see, the plant doesn't just let the
chlorophyll drift away once it's done photosynthesiz
ing for the year. Before it lets the leaf drop, it wants
to get back some of the material it has invested. In
particular, nitrogen is a valuable commodity, since it
can not be created from photosynthesis using air and
water, like most other cellular components. Thus,
the tree actively breaks down the chlorophyll and
various proteins to get back the nitrogen, in fact, up
to three-fourths of the nitrogen in a leaf can be sal
vaged before the leaf drops.
However, the carotinoids contain no nitrogen, so
it's not really worth it for the tree to go through the
effort of breaking it down for recycling. So you're left
with the yellow color.
The bright oranges and reds are actually due to an
entirely different process. As the tree begins break
ing down its chlorophyll, it starts creating a set of pig
ments known as anthocyanins, the same molecules
that make the difference between red and green
grapes.
It's not known for certain why the tree makes
these, but the best answer we have now is that the
anthocyanins are just a random by-product of
metabolism. Each anthocyanin consists of sugar
molecules linked to a benzene molecule. So the idea
is that at the end of a leafs life, it ends up producing
extra sugars that it doesn't have anything to do with.
These, by default, end up linking onto a benzene ring
to form anthocyanins, giving all the bright colors..
Another question that isn't quite answered is
what triggers the tree to drop its leaves. It is known
that most trees rely on the length of the day to tell
them when winter is approaching. But in order for
the tree to be able to "measure" the length of the day,
it needs some type of biological molecular clock. This
can't be an ordinary metabolic process, however,
because the speed of most metabolic reactions is
highly temperature dependent.
However, researchers are beginning to crack this
one as well. Recent discoveries suggest that this tim
ing depends on some cyclical regulation of gene
expression, which is not influenced by temperature.
Of course, around here things generally just turn
bixrwn, and a long time before autumn at that. This
is just when the plants die, due to lack of water or
excessive heat Once the plant is dead, the chloro
phyll breaks down naturally, leaving us with it's
brown remains.
So get out there and enjoy it while there's time.
The Foothills will soon be green no longer, and it
would be a shame to have only completed problem
sets to show for it
