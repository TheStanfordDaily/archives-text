# Distinction between mono- and polyunsaturated fats found to be misleading

Olive oil and corn oil might not be
that different after all — especially
when it comes to cholesterol.
Results from a meta-analysis
study conducted by Dr. Christopher
Gardner, a postdoctoral fellow at the
Stanford Center for Research in Dis
ease Prevention, suggest that there
is no need for individuals to differen
tiate between mono- and polyunsatu
rated fats in their diets in an effort to
improve their cholesterol levels.
After reviewing a recent journal
article that reported no differences
between the two fats, Gardner even
tually uncovered other studies relat
ing unsaturated fats to cholesterol
levels. "We did a massive literature
search and we found 23 studies that
had compared monos to polys specif
ically and virtually none of them
found any differences," Gardner
said.
Discarding nine of the studies
which did not conform to his strict
criteria, Gardner analyzed the
results of the remaining 14 compar
ing the effects of the two unsaturat
ed fats on the human body. Subjects
were administered diets consisting of
either high levels of mono- or
polyunsaturated fats along with
standardized levels of total fat, satu
rated fat, dietary cholesterol, carbo
hydrates and fiber.
The studies were randomized clin
ical trials with at least 10 individuals
on each diet. One-half of the group

subsisted on a diet high in monoun
saturated fats while the other half
subsisted on a diet high in polyunsat
urated fats.
Those individuals who ingested
diets high in monounsaturated fats
showed no difference in either LDL
(low-density lipoprotein) or HDL
(high-density lipoprotein) choles
terol levels with those who ingested
diets high in polyunsaturated fats.
The meta-study, providing an
overview of the 14 clinical trial stud
ies, pooled the data from the previ
ously published reports. "We were
interested in seeing if there were any
small but consistent differences
between polys and monos that the
individual studies couldn't pick up
themselves. Quantitatively, [there
was] no difference between poly- and
monounsaturated fats for LDL or
HDL cholesterol levels," Gardner
said.
Since saturated fats, found in var
ious animal products and tropical
plant oils, have been shown to cause
an increase in the level of LDL
("bad") cholesterol — as opposed to
HDL ("good") cholesterol — in tho
body, doctors have recommended the
ingestion of unsaturated fats, which
lower LDL levels, for decades.
The distinction between bad and
good cholesterol arises from the dif
ferences in composition and in func
tion of the two major types of choles
terol found in the body: LDL and
HDL. Low-density lipoproteins con
tain mostly cholesterol, which they

transport to tissues around the body
for use in biosynthesis (of cell mem
branes among other things) and to
be deposited. These lipoproteins are
deemed bad, because it seems that
they play an essential role in the
development of several fatal human
diseases. Cholesterol build-up in the
bloodstream can lead to fatty
deposits inside arteries, contributing
to reduced blood flow and hardened
arteries. Heart attacks, strokes and
other forms of vascular disease can
also result.
On the other hand, high-density
lipoproteins (of a higher density
because they contain less cholesterol
than LDL's) serve as acceptors of
cholesterol, removing it from the
bloodstream and returning it to the
liver where it is used to synthesize
bile. It is in the bloodstream that
cholesterol causes most of its prob
lems and HDL's are therefore
deemed good cholesterol.
Normally, LDL levels are two to
five times greater than HDL levels in
the body. Ingested fats are transport
ed in two lipoprotein complexes
which carry cholesterol, indirectly
affecting the levels of cholesterol in
the blood.
Thus, total cholesterol level does
not determine one's risk for heart
disease but the ratio of LDL to HDL
does — the lower the ratio, the small
er the risk. Such health factors as
cigarette smoking lower HDL while
exercise increases HDL, and chemi
cal factors like high estrogen levels

lower total cholesterol and LDL and
increase HDL, making women less
susceptible to heart disease.
Because of a 1985 study which
claimed that monounsaturated fats
were better for the body than
polyunsaturated fats, many doctors
recommended the ingestion of such
monounsaturated fats as olive,
canola and peanut oil over polyun-

for LDL or HDL choles
terol levels.'

saturated fats like corn and sunflow
er oil. The 1985 study reversed the
results of studies conducted two
decades earlier which recommended
polyunsaturated fats.
After years of physicians recom
mending mono- over polyunsaturat
ed fats, this study may give health
conscious individuals one less con
cern. "If [people] are worried about
their cholesterol, they shouldn't
worry about putting walnut oil ver
sus almond oil in something or cook
ing with olive oil versus corn oil,"
Gardner said.
However, Gardner still believes
there may be other possible benefits
to monounsaturates over polyunsat
urates. "Monounsaturated fats are
less susceptible to oxidation than
polyunsaturated fats," he said. Oxi
dation results in the breakdown of
substances in the body and may have
negative effects on health.
Not all hold Gardner's view
regarding unsaturated fats. In her
study of individuals with non
insulin-dependent diabetes, Dr. Ann
Coulston, research dietitian at the
General Clinical Research Center at
the School of Medicine, has found
that diets rich in polyunsaturated
fats as opposed to monounsaturated
fats tend to decrease HDL levels in
those individuals with the disease.
However, she emphasizes that her
research focuses exclusively on those
with diabetes and that non-insulin
dependent diabetes patients tend to
already have lower levels of HDL.
After Gardner initially announced
his results, gathered with the help of
Psychiatry Prof. Helena Kraemer, a
statistics expert, the researcher was
bombarded by the media. He cau
tions, however, that the public and
the scientific community should
have a chance to examine his data,
which have not yet been published.
Gardner's future studies may
focus on determining the proper bal
ance of carbohydrates and unsatu
rated fats in a healthy diet.
