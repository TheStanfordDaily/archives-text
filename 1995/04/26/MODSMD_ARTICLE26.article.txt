# Attention: all those with enlarged prostates
## New laser surgery, safe and highly effective, solves common problem for males 
### Prithika Balakrishnan Contributing writer 
Using a laser to clear away unwanted prostate
tissue, Stanford urologist John Kabalin has pro
posed a new method of surgery to combat urina
tion problems resulting from an overgrown
prostate gland. The new method has fewer com
plications and is just as effective as the standard
treatment.
Kabalin, who pioneered the laser treatment,
presented his results showing the laser
surgery's success at the annual meeting of the
American Urological Association on Monday.
Kabalin's results come from a study of over
200 men who received the surgery — called laser
prostatectomy — at Stanford and at the nearby
Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
Kabalin, an assistant professor of urology at
the School of Medicine, began performing laser
prostatectomy in 1991; his study is one of the
largest to date and one of the first focusing on
long-term effects of the surgery, he said.
"Our results show that clinical efficacy for
the laser surgery is comparable to that of the
standard surgical procedure," said Kabalin,
adding that both procedures have an 80 to 90
percent success rate.
As men age, the prostate gland, which encir
cles the urethra, often becomes enlarged. This
condition is known as benign prostatic hyperpla
sia. The enlarged gland blocks the urethra and
the flow of urine, causing problems such as
incontinence — an uncontrollable, involuntary
urination often due to injury or disease of the
urinary tract — and abnormally frequent urges
to urinate.
Those who suffer from prostate enlargement
are susceptible to a specific type of incontinence,
called overflow incontinence. This is the phe
nomenon of chronic urine retention, in which
the sufferer is unable to empty the bladder nor
mally due to the obstruction of the enlarged

prostate. The bladder is always full, leading to
constant dribbling of the overflow.
To at least some degree, the condition affects
almost all men older than 60. As a resul,t, hun
dreds of thousands of men in the United States
each year undergo the standard treatment for
benign prostatic hyperplasia, a surgical proce
dure known as TURP. In this procedure, an
instrument is passed through the urethra,
allowing the physician to look at the prostate
and cut away as much of the extra tissue as pos
sible.

Laser surgery uses the
same basic procedure, substi
tuting a laser for the instru
ment. However, the after
effects of TURP — bleeding
and a greater chance of devel
oping incontinence — do not
occur in laser prostatectomy,
according to Kabalin.
Since 1991, Kabalin has
found that laser surgery
patients experience virtually
no bleeding and require less
anesthesia than those under
going traditional TURP. They
also have less likelihood of
developing incontinence as a
result of the surgery (The
physical stress that surgery
causes to the urinary tract is
the presumed cause of this
subsequent incontinence).
Kabalin said, "You see incon
tinence in 2 percent of the
men who undergo the tradi
tional TURP procedure. But
we have not seen a single case
of incontinence after laser
prostatectomy. It simply
doesn't happen when the pro
cedure is done properly."

The technique takes advantage of laser tech
nology already used in medical procedures but
also uses a new method to redirect the laser to
shoot sideways instead of straight. A collabora
tive effort of engineers at two companies, Bard
Inc. of Georgia and Trimedyne Inc. of Irvine,
Calif., worked on redirecting the laser using a
metal reflecting dish placed at the end of the
laser fiber.
The study was carried out with the help of
Gunars Bit 6, a physician assistant at the V.A.
hospital.
