## Tennis brats, tennis studs and baseball 
### 
It's nice to know that there are still some brats
left playing the game of tennis. One of the
newest on the scene is Justin Gimelstob, a
UCLA freshman who will turn pro sometime in the
near future.
I talked to the New Jersey native after his indi
vidual and team loss to top-ranked Stanford last
Saturday. He was obviously upset at my intimation
that Cardinal junior Jeff Salzenstein had tooled
him by exploiting his backhand passing shot — a
hitherto unexploited weakness in his game.

His crankiness made him curt, distant and
unwilling to say anything substantive for the edifi
cation of Stanford Daily readers. When I ended the
interview by asking if he was looking forward to a
possible rematch with Stanford at the NCAA cham
pionships in May, he replied with relish, "I'm not
gonna give you any bulletin board material. I look
forward to playing anyone." I guess he did say
something for your edification. . . .
Still on the subject of tennis, how about the No.
5-ranked Cardinal women's team? Everyone
expected the preseason-No. 1 men to dominate this
year, but who could've guessed the women would
also go undefeated in the Pac-10 South and enter
the NCAA championships with more momentum
than a 20-foot wave crashing into the coast of Pep
perdine, Calif., the site of this year's final dance.
I must admit that I doubted whether last year's

runners-up could rebound from
the loss to graduation of Laxmi
Poruri and Kristine Kurth.
But head coach Frank Brennan
went out and got the needed
replenishment in star freshmen
Ania Bleszynski and Julie
Scott, and has his returning
players primed to avenge last
year's heartwrenching loss to
Georgia. Without the disadvan
tage of playing on the Bulldogs'
homecourt this year, the Cardi
nal's chances look better than a
cold beer on the Fourth of
July....
Has anybody noticed the Major
League exhibition standings? The
New York Mets stand atop the
National League with a 9-3
record, tied with the Chicago
Cubs. If any of you are Wrigley
bleacher bums or Mets fanatics,
you are surely already placing
your bets and talking smack,
respectively.
But as they say in Wrigleyville,
you would do better to just "shut
up and drink your beer." You
should be heeding the familiar
rule of thumb, "That team which
finishes first during spring train
ing will usually finish last in the
real season." By this convoluted
form of logic, New York Yankee
fans have much to cheer about —
at 4-8, the Bronx Bombers are
mired in the American League
cellar. Never underestimate the
genius of George Steinbren

On a sad note, any joy Steve
Stenstrom might have derived
from being drafted by the Kansas
City Chiefs was stripped away by
the sudden death last Monday of
his younger brother, Jeff. A 19-
year-old freshman linebacker at
Cornell, Jeff had contracted
meningococcal meningitis, a
highly infectious bacterial dis
ease, and had been hospitalized
since last Thursday in Ithaca,
N.Y. after complaining of severe
headaches. Stenstrom flew to
Ithaca to be at his brother's bed
side last Friday and ended up pay
ing no attention to the weekend
draft.

Joe likes the Yankees over the
Braves in the World Series,
unless Ron Gant somehou
returns to Atlanta.
