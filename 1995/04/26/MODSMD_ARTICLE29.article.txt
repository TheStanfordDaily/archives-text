## Women water polo hopes for nationals 
### Seth Goldstein Editorial staff 
Women's water polo has always
had a home on the Farm, as Stan
ford has maintained a squad for
the past 15 years. Recently, how
ever, the sport has gained more
respect from both national offi
cials and the Athletics Depart
ment.
With 25 varsity teams nation
wide, and plans for 25 more to
gain varsity status over the next
few years, women's water polo
hopes to soon become an officially
sponsored NCAA event. Stanford,
which is scheduled to move its
squad into the varsity ranks for
the 1996 season, is one of the
schools leading the charge.
"[Stanford has] had a team for
a while," said sophomore Alice
Cathcart, "but it's really been in
the last two or three years that
we've seen a huge surge in popu
larity."
The Cardinal fields a team con
sisting of the results of this recent
upswing. Most of the squad's
starters are sophomores and
freshmen. And because the pro
gram, as a varsity sport, can now
recruit, it anticipates an even
greater influx of new young tal
ent.
While gearing up for the inau
gural season, the team has com

piled a 14-11 record in 1995. This
performance includes a fifth-place
finish at the Western Region's
National Qualification tourna
ment at UC-Pavis this past week
end. The top four teams received
automatic bids to the national
championships at Maryland the
weekend of May 12, but Stanford
still hopes for an at-large bid. The
squad will discover its fate on
Tuesday.
The Cardinal began the week
end in a group with Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo and UC-San Diego.
On Friday, it demolished the Mus
tangs 17-3, but fell to the Tritons,
the eventual second-place finisher,
10-2.
The squad's 1-1 showing quali
fied it to move on to the next level
of play where it faced San Diego
State. The Aztecs, soon-to-be
crowned Western Regional cham
pions, made short work of Stan
ford in an 11-3 victory.
Next up were the rival Califor
nia Golden Bears, who fell to Stan
ford for the first time in five years,
9-4.
"We were fired up and came out
really strong in the first quarter,"
said freshman Julie Baker. "We
lapsed once or twice, but never let
them back into the game."
Finally, in Sunday's battle with
UC-Santa Barbara for fifth place,
the Cardinal eked out a 9-8 win.
