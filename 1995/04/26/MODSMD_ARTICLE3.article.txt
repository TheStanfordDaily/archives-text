Linking societal and political
well-being to the arts, three-time
Pulitzer Prize-winning play
wright Edward Albee argued for
the importance of supporting
artistic expression in American
society.
Albee, who wrote such plays as
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
and "Three Tall Women," began
his speech last night in Memorial
Auditorium with a humorous au
tobiographical account.
Despite his serious theme,
Albee often kept the 500-plus au
dience in laughs. "At 14 I found
myself at the Valley Forge Mili
tary Academy," he said, "but I
mustn't say anything terrible
about that school because there
are spies everywhere."
In a topic familiar to the pre
dominantly student audience,
Albee criticized his college experi
ence. He said that upon arrival at
Trinity College in Hartford,

Conn., he knew he would be un
happy when he saw the list of re
quired courses.
"Since I was the one being edu
cated, I expected to have some say
in my education," Albee said.
"When I did not go to any of the
required courses . . . they ex
plained to me that they owned the
real estate and they would edu
cate me the way they wanted to."
The second half of Albee's
speech was more politically ori
ented, dealing with the relation
ship between art and society.
"There is a relationship between
how we allow ourselves to be gov
erned and our political and moral
health," he said.
He then described the different
environment in which the arts
were expanding in the 19605. "It
was an aesthetic time under . ..
[John F.] Kennedy, off-Broadway
was expanding .. . art galleries
and museums were showing
young artists," Albee said.
