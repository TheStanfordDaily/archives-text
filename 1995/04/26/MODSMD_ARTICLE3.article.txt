Linking societal and political
well-being to the arts, three-time
Pulitzer Prize-winning play
wright Edward Albee argued for
the importance of supporting
artistic expression in American
society.
Albee, who wrote such plays as
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
and "Three Tall Women," began
his speech last night in Memorial
Auditorium with a humorous au
tobiographical account.
Despite his serious theme,
Albee often kept the 500-plus au
dience in laughs. "At 14 I found
myself at the Valley Forge Mili
tary Academy," he said, "but I
mustn't say anything terrible
about that school because there
are spies everywhere."
In a topic familiar to the pre
dominantly student audience,
Albee criticized his college experi
ence. He said that upon arrival at
Trinity College in Hartford,

Conn., he knew he would be un
happy when he saw the list of re
quired courses.
"Since I was the one being edu
cated, I expected to have some say
in my education," Albee said.
"When I did not go to any of the
required courses . . . they ex
plained to me that they owned the
real estate and they would edu
cate me the way they wanted to."
The second half of Albee's
speech was more politically ori
ented, dealing with the relation
ship between art and society.
"There is a relationship between
how we allow ourselves to be gov
erned and our political and moral
health," he said.
He then described the different
environment in which the arts
were expanding in the 19605. "It
was an aesthetic time under . ..
[John F.] Kennedy, off-Broadway
was expanding .. . art galleries
and museums were showing
young artists," Albee said.
"It was a time when the feder
al government understood that it
had a responsibility to the nation
al aesthetic of this country and the
National Endowment for the Arts
was born," he added. "No country
is completely educated unless it is
aesthetically educated."
Art is important, Albee argued,
"because you hold up a mirror to
people and you say, 'This is how
you are, this is how you behave.' "
He said people often do not want
to see this mirror because they
might have to change their lives.
Albee then insisted that with
the declining support for the arts
and the federal government's cur
rent attack on the NEA, American
society is near an internal commu
nication collapse.
"We are very close to a time

when there will be no communica
tion any longer between the peo
ple who make art and those for
whom it is made," he said.
After listing how the majority
of popular American art forms are
escapist, Albee asked, "So what?
Why do we care?
"What distinguishes us from
the animals?" Albee said. "We are
the only animal who consciously
creates art, and we use art to
define consciousness to our
selves."
Albee insisted that America has
a more debilitating form of censor
ship than many authoritarian
societies because "the censorship
we impose on ourselves is the non
participation in art.
"Be fearful of any government
which wishes to take away your
opportunity to either participate
or not participate in the arts," he
added. "Remember that in a
democracy you end up with exact
ly what you deserve."
