### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
The Stanford softball team (12-
26) hopes to continue its two
game winning streak today in a 3
p.m. doubleheader vs. the College
of Notre Dame (3-19) at El
Camino Park.
Stanford put the brakes on a
12-game skid by knocking off Loy
ola Marymount for its first win
since April 1. After splitting a dou
ble dip with Loyola Marymount
earlier this year at Stanford, the
Cardinal swept the Lions on the
road last Friday, taking both
games by 4-2 scores.
Stanford's offense was
strengthened by coach Sandy
Pearce's second lineup change of
the year. Hot-hitting junior
Amanda Renteria, who provided
punch after being moved to the
ninth spot earlier this year, was
moved to the third spot in an
effort to take advantage of sopho
more Summer Lee's ability to get

on base.
"We got some production out of
it [against Loyola]," Pearce said.
"We'll see how it works out the
rest of the season against some
Pac-10 teams."
Lee's average of .434 leads the
squad by 107 points. In the most
recent NCAA statistics, Lee's .446
was 20th-best in the nation and
fourth in the Pac-10. Lee also
sports a team-leading 18 RBIs.
On the defensive side, right
hander Angela Webb (6-19) will
take the mound once again for the
Cardinal. Webb has started exclu
sively since freshman phenom
Jessica Schulman was sidelined
with a stress fracture in her back.
Schulman is out indefinitely, leav
ing the pitching chores to Webb.
Despite the 1-17 Pac-10 mark,
the Cardinal's 12 overall wins are
seven more than last year's total.
With a sweep over the Argonauts,
the Cardinal would set a varsity
record for most consecutive victo
ries.
