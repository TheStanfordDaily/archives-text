# Spartans extend non-league woes
## Baseball is 10-10 out of Six-Pac 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Stanford 3 1
San Jose St. 6 |

The beady eyes of the powers
that-be, those who will be select
ing the at-large bids to the NCAA
baseball regional tournament in
one month, were fixed on San
Jose State's Municipal Stadium
last night.
If you happen not to be a Stan
ford fan, it was a sight for sore
eyes. If you are a Cardinal fanatic,
it was a sore sight for the eyes.
The Spartans raked Stanford
against the proverbial coals, sti
fling a batting order that had
been on fire three days ago and
capitalizing on Cardinal errors to
nab the 6-3 victory.
The loss dropped the Cardinal
to 25-19 overall and served as a
disappointing interlude between
last weekend's three-game muti
lation of California and the all
important conference series
against Arizona starting on Fri
day. Stanford (15-9 in the Six-
Pac) remains one game back of
league-leading USC, and the loss
to SJSU did not affect the league
race. But the game could mean all
the difference in the world if
Stanford fails to win the confer
ence and depends on an at-large
bid to play postseason ball.
The Spartans sport a 18-28-1

record and perhaps should have
been, in the eyes of the NCAA, an
easy feast for the Cardinal.
Junior second baseman Brian
Dallimore single-handedly scored
the first run for the Spartans,
committing three consecutive
errors with no outs in the bottom
of the first inning as SJSU took a
1-0 lead. The first Spartan hit off
junior southpaw Mike Robbins
scored the second unearned run
of the inning and San Jose State
hit the dugout after the first lead
ing Stanford 2-0.
The Cardinal took the lead in
its next at bat, beginning with
freshman designated hitter Jon
Schaeffer's single that scored
Dusty Allen on a Spartan fielding
error. Moments later sophomore
shortstop Eric Sees slipped a ball
through the SJSU infield and
scored both Dallimore and Scha
effer to put Stanford up 3-2.
The top of the Cardinal order
was silenced by Spartan hurler
Chris Townsend, who gave up
three runs in his three complete
innings of work. But the bottom
batters stepped up to the plate
and picked up the Stanford slack.
SJSU looked to right-handed
pitcher Israel Long in the fourth
inning, pulling Townsend after he
was rocked by the Cardinal in the
third.
The Stanford fifth inning saw
the return of senior first baseman
Dusty Allen, who has been out of
the position he occupied for three
years all season because of a hand
injury.
Robbins gave up his first
earned run in the bottom of the
fifth inning, when the Spartans
tied the game on a blooper over
third base. San Jose State took
the 4-3 lead on a sacrifice fly with
only one out in the inning, but
Robbins squirmed out of a poten
tial disaster by collecting the final
two outs without giving up anoth
er hit. Robbins surrendered four
runs (two earned) on six hits and

collected two strikeouts in five
innings before being replaced by
sophomore right hander Brendan
Sullivan in the sixth.
A hit-and-run infield pop fly in
the sixth inning scored a Spartan
base runner all the way from first
after Dallimore vacated his sec
ond base position to cover the bag,
and the Spartans took a 5-3 lead
into the top of the seventh inning.
San Jose State padded the lead
off sophomore right-handed
pitcher Tom Reimers in the bot
tom of the eighth, and the Cardi
nal were unable to get any scoring
opportunities in the top of the
ninth.
