# Ruggers' season ends with heartbreak
##

Seventeen years of torturous frustration could
have ended for the Stanford rugby program this
weekend in San Diego. Make that should have
ended for Stanford at the Pacific Coast Territori
al Championships.
The Territorial Championships serves as the
western regional playoff, and its victor receives a
precious berth into the college rugby Final Four.
Eight teams compete in the event, but the tour
nament really comes down to a battle between
two teams â€” California and Stanford.
Cal boasts a No. 1 ranking while the Cardinal
carries the No. 2 spot. Cal has dominated the col
legiate level, capturing 12 out of the last 14
national titles. Stanford, on the other hand, has
failed to defeat Cal for 17 consecutive years and
consequently failed to reach the Final Four over

that span. Always the bridesmaid, never the
bride.
Stanford started the tournament on two very
positive notes. On Friday, the Cardinal over
whelmed an outmatched Western Washington
team 25-0. Stanford posted five tries on the day,
but failed to score all of its conversions. The usu
ally reliable freshman Dave Warter was ham
pered by a thigh bruise, but fortunately the added
points didn't impact the game.
Stanford coach Franck Boivert even had the
luxury of playing his reserves in the second half.
The easy victory allowed some less experienced
Cardinals to strut their stuff and also allowed the
team as a whole to observe the conditions.
The playing field bordered the San Diego
Beach, adding a noticeable wind factor. The team
playing with the wind received a definite advan

Stanford's second game against UC-Santa Bar

bara perfectly illustrated the importance of the
wind advantage.
Going against the wind in the first half, the
Cardinal went into the break trailing 3-0 against
Southern California's top-ranked side. The sec
ond half brought a reversal of sides, and of the
Cardinal's fortunes. Stanford dominated the sec
ond period and shut out the Gauchos on its way
to a convincing 17-3 triumph. The wind aided
Stanford's already strong kicking game and
enabled the Cardinal to control the playing field.
"In the second half we had the wind and just
got the job done," Boivert said.
But in all reality Western Washington and
UCSB were merely warm-up matches. Let's call
it foreplay. Sunday's match against Cal was the
real deal, the ultimate reason the team traveled
to San Diego, the reason the team has trained all
