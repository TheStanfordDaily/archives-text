# Ruggers' season ends with heartbreak
## 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
Seventeen years of torturous frustration could
have ended for the Stanford rugby program this
weekend in San Diego. Make that should have
ended for Stanford at the Pacific Coast Territori
al Championships.
The Territorial Championships serves as the
western regional playoff, and its victor receives a
precious berth into the college rugby Final Four.
Eight teams compete in the event, but the tour
nament really comes down to a battle between
two teams — California and Stanford.
Cal boasts a No. 1 ranking while the Cardinal
carries the No. 2 spot. Cal has dominated the col
legiate level, capturing 12 out of the last 14
national titles. Stanford, on the other hand, has
failed to defeat Cal for 17 consecutive years and
consequently failed to reach the Final Four over

that span. Always the bridesmaid, never the
bride.
Stanford started the tournament on two very
positive notes. On Friday, the Cardinal over
whelmed an outmatched Western Washington
team 25-0. Stanford posted five tries on the day,
but failed to score all of its conversions. The usu
ally reliable freshman Dave Warter was ham
pered by a thigh bruise, but fortunately the added
points didn't impact the game.
Stanford coach Franck Boivert even had the
luxury of playing his reserves in the second half.
The easy victory allowed some less experienced
Cardinals to strut their stuff and also allowed the
team as a whole to observe the conditions.
The playing field bordered the San Diego
Beach, adding a noticeable wind factor. The team
playing with the wind received a definite advan
tage, especially in the area of the kicking games.
Stanford's second game against UC-Santa Bar

bara perfectly illustrated the importance of the
wind advantage.
Going against the wind in the first half, the
Cardinal went into the break trailing 3-0 against
Southern California's top-ranked side. The sec
ond half brought a reversal of sides, and of the
Cardinal's fortunes. Stanford dominated the sec
ond period and shut out the Gauchos on its way
to a convincing 17-3 triumph. The wind aided
Stanford's already strong kicking game and
enabled the Cardinal to control the playing field.
"In the second half we had the wind and just
got the job done," Boivert said.
But in all reality Western Washington and
UCSB were merely warm-up matches. Let's call
it foreplay. Sunday's match against Cal was the
real deal, the ultimate reason the team traveled
to San Diego, the reason the team has trained all
year.
Stanford even had its own Cin
derella story in the form of senior
Alan Gonzalez. A former football
player, Gonzalez has battled
injuries throughout his four years
on the Farm and the weekend's
matches were his only of the season.
Gonzalez scored a try against Santa
Barbara and doled out some punish
ment.
"Yeah, it was a Big Game all
right," Boivert said in reference to
the classic battle. "Unbelievable —
in all my years of coaching I have
never seen such an intense game."
Stanford hoped it had learned
from April's match against Cal,
when the Cardinal fell victim to the
Golden Bears' reputation as much
as its play on the field.
Playing with the wind, Cal
opened up a 5-0 lead in the first half.
The try would be the Bears' only
one of the match and the only scor
ing in the first half. The halflime
score didn't reflect the Cardinal per
formance. Unlike the previous
match, Stanford took the initiative

in pressuring Cal by running the
ball down the Bears' throats. The
Cardinal, however, failed to capital
ize on numerous opportunities.
"We went into the game to jump
at them and be right in their face,"
Boivert said. "In the first half, we
sold ourselves short."
By the start of the second half,
the underdogs had long since
earned the support of an overflow
ing crowd. The uncommon roar of a
crowd might have hurt the Cardinal
in the long run. Stanford stormed
onto the field with intensity and
emotion, but perhaps too much.
According to Boivert, in the final
half, Stanford "basically committed
suicide." Although the team played
with fire, the team did not play with
intelligence. After trailing 8-0, Stan
ford scored two conversions to cut
the deficit to 8-6. At this point, how
ever, the Cardinal was showing
signs of faltering. Players became
anxious and overaggressive. The
product of Stanford's lack of control
was numerous Cal penalty kicks.
The match stayed within reach, but
mistakes prevented Stanford from
ever grasping the lead.
The seesaw score jumped from
11-6 to 11-11 on a try by sophomore
Trung Ngo. Ngo performed out
standingly throughout the match,

but also contributed to the numer
ous Cardinal fouls. Although Stan
ford dominated play and controlled
the ball throughout the half, the
score was knotted up at 14 with two
minutes remaining.
Boivert credits junior Jeff
Siemen's brilliant play as a main
reason the Cardinal dominated the
game flow. Siemen won many balls
in the air and displayed incredible
field coverage.
Bolstered by Siemen, Stanford's
dream seemed to be very realistic
with two minutes left. Stanford had
squandered numerous opportuni
ties to score, but still had a shot to
win the match. At this crucial
moment, Stanford's biggest enemy
wasn't Cal, but itself. Another care
less foul gave the Bears a penalty
kick, making the score 17-14.
Boivert reacted with disbelief.
"I was looking at the game plan
being played so well," Boivert said.
"I had faith we were going to win."
Stanford ends the season on a
negative note, but the season's
accomplishments put the loss in
perspective.
"At the beginning of the year we
weren't sure we were going to have
a winning record, and then we were
one minute away from the national
championship," Boivert said.
