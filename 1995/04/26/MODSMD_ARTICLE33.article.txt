Josh Stein
For senior gymnast Josh Stein, the Athlete of the Week award
pales in comparison with his other recently acquired prizes. He
guided the No. 14 men's gymnastics squad to its third national
title in four years, surprising everybody but those wearing Cardi
nal red. After placing third in the all-around in Athens, Ga., last
weekend, the unassuming Stein claimed the Nissen Award as the
nation's top senior gymnast.

returning in late March from a wrist ii\jury. In last weekend's sea
son-closing victories over UCLA and USC, Berris stepped in for ail

Rudolph and USC's Sayaka Kimura.
