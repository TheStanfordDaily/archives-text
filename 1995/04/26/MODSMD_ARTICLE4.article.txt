# Election vote valid says ASSU Senate

Amid charges of election viola
tions, the ASSU Senate last night
validated the results of last week's
election, the first step in the
process to approve election re
sults.
In order to approve the results
of the election, the senate must
certify those results at next Tues
day's senate meeting, said senate
chair Nawwar Kasrawi. Valida
tion means that the senate agrees
there have been no system-wide
election violations, while certifica
tion means that there have been
no specific election violations.
However, the senate failed to
schedule a special meeting to ap
prove the nomination of a hear
ings commission to look into al

leged elections violations. The
senate has to appoint a commis
sion before next Tuesday's meet
ing since candidates cannot be pe
nalized after certification, Kas
rawi said. Only a hearings com
mission has the power to penalize
candidates.
Undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell said there were
11 possible violations of the elec
tion rules, which included the fol
lowing: alleged e-mail fraud; the
status of El Aguila — a campus
Chicano / Latino news magazine;
not allowing nicknames on the
ballot; the use of Office of Devel
opment phone facilities for cam
paigning purposes; the imputed
value of such facilities; alleged
phone harassment; and alleged
acts of vandalism of campaign
posters.
Senators questioned Berent
extensively about the use of the
Office of Development phone
bank last week by members of the
People's Platform party to

encourage students to vote for
Platform candidates and certain
special fee groups.
Undergraduate senator Ed
Malone said the use of Office of
Development phones gave an
unfair advantage to certain candi
dates because there was no equal
access, adding that the value of
the resources should be reported
on candidate financial declaration

statements.
"Unlike [ASSUJ resources,
University resources don't have
to be equally accessible," Berent
said.
University resources can be
used as long as they are not
abused and the use of them does
not interfere with the functioning
of the University, he added.
"If the University gave a gratu

ity that can be quantified, then it
does constitute a campaign
expense and should be reported,"
Berent said.
In other senate action, the sen
ate approved the nomination of
Stanford-in-Government Chair
Susie Thomas as chair of the
ASSU Nominations Committee.
The committee is responsible for
appointing students to University

committees.
"I think the only way the stu
dents have a voice in the adminis
tration is ... through these chan
nels," Thomas said. "In the past,
these seats have gone unfilled or
filled by students who do not
show up."
Thomas said she would try to
recruit students using "ads, flyers
and e-mail lists," as well as specif

ically targeting graduate stu
dents. "I will make a concerted
effort to reach populations that
would not otherwise know about
this," Thomas said.
Thomas said she was confident
she would find people to serve on
committees. "Given the intensity
of the campus, this is something
students should be interested in,"
she said.
