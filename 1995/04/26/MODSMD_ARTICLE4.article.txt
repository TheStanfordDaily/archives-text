Amid charges of election viola
tions, the ASSU Senate last night
validated the results of last week's
election, the first step in the
process to approve election re
sults.
In order to approve the results
of the election, the senate must
certify those results at next Tues
day's senate meeting, said senate
chair Nawwar Kasrawi. Valida
tion means that the senate agrees
there have been no system-wide
election violations, while certifica
tion means that there have been
no specific election violations.
However, the senate failed to
schedule a special meeting to ap
prove the nomination of a hear
ings commission to look into al

leged elections violations. The
senate has to appoint a commis
sion before next Tuesday's meet
ing since candidates cannot be pe
nalized after certification, Kas
rawi said. Only a hearings com
mission has the power to penalize
candidates.
Undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell said there were
11 possible violations of the elec
tion rules, which included the fol
lowing: alleged e-mail fraud; the
status of El Aguila â€” a campus
Chicano / Latino news magazine;
not allowing nicknames on the
ballot; the use of Office of Devel
opment phone facilities for cam
paigning purposes; the imputed
value of such facilities; alleged
phone harassment; and alleged
acts of vandalism of campaign
