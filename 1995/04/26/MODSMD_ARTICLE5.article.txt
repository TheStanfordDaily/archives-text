In his second annual State of the School Ad
dress yesterday, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven discussed how the school is
strengthening its academic programs and mi
nority recruitment efforts despite budgetary
constraints.
In exploring these new methods to improve
the School of Humanities and Sciences,
Shoven said he felt it was necessary to address
the school's budgetary situation.
"As of right now, relative to a 'current ser
vices budget' — that is, how much it would cost
next year to do the same things that we are
doing this year — it appears that we face a bud
getary shortfall of about 2 percent," he said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice announced last
week that all schools' budgets will be held flat
at nominal levels.

One action that will be
taken in response to the
shortfall will be to raise the
average size of teaching assis
tant sections by 10 percent.
This move will, however, de
crease the number of teach
ing positions offered and
therefore hit fifth- and sixth
year graduate students hard,
Shoven said.

"All in all, the cuts will be painful, but we've
weighed the options carefully and feel that we
have found the best way to deal with the bud
get realities that we face," Shoven said in the
speech at Annenberg Auditorium.
Despite the budgetary constraints, the
school hopes to add extra muscle by focusing
on diversity, both in its faculty and students.
"So far we have carefully evaluated and dis
cussed 21 new appointments, 20 promotions

and seven re appointments. Of the new ap
pointments, about 25 percent are members of
underrepresented groups, which is an im
provement over our record last year," he said.
In addition, the school's efforts to improve
its recruitment and retention rates for minori
ty graduate students have met with success so
far this year, Shoven said.
"We have admitted 58 students — which is
a slight increase over last year," he said.
Shoven also pointed to the Undergraduate
Admissions Office's Yield Enhancement Pro
gram as an example of the school's determina
tion "to identify and enroll the nation's most
intellectually curious and accomplished stu
dents."
The enhancement program includes the in
stitution of an early decision option and the
new President's Scholars Program, which pro-
