## Summer program in Moscow started

Stanford Overseas Studies, in
collaboration with the University
Summer Session program, will
offer a nine-week intensive lan
guage program to help interested
students learn Russian.
The new program, called the
Stanford-Moscow Summer Inten
sive Russian Language Program,
will also serve as a stepping stone
to create more interest in the Stan
ford in Moscow overseas study pro
gram that already exists, said Rus
sell Berman, director of Overseas
Studies.
The summer program will con
sist of nine weeks of intensive
Russian study starting in late June
and ending in late August. The first
five weeks will be spent at Stanford
and the last four weeks in Moscow.
"The program will enable stu
dents to begin learning Russian in
the summer and participate in the
Moscow program — making the
[Stanford in Moscow] program
even more accessible to Stanford
undergraduates," Berman said.
The number of students who
participate in the Stanford in
Moscow program is relatively small
— only 10 attended this fall com
pared to 12 the year before.
Director of the Stanford in
Moscow program Maxim Brater
sky said he is confident that "there
are more Stanford students willing
to participate in the Moscow pro
gram but we have a language
requirement that is quite strict."
The Stanford in Moscow pro
gram requires three quarters of Uni
versity-level Russian classes. Other

Stanford overseas programs have
similar language requirements.
The new summer program
would give students the chance to
learn the basics of Russian and
continue on with the Stanford in
Moscow program.
However, Berman added that
the summer course is not only
geared toward those students who
want to take part in Stanford in
Moscow. It is also for the benefit of
undergraduates who "aren't inter
ested in the full program but want
to learn the language," he said.
In the past there has only been
an autumn quarter program in
Moscow, but beginning with the
1995-96 academic year there will

ttlsn be a winter program offered,
Herman said. Offering the program
during more than one quarter each
year might attract more students
to the Stanford in Moscow pro
gram, he said.
The autumn program consists
of courses such as history, politics
and art. The winter program,
unlike the autumn one , will focus
on internships or academic
research. Bratersky said he has
already been busy contacting vari
ous organizations and businesses
in Moscow to establish internships
in fields such as banking, journal
ism and technology.
Applications for the Moscow
programs are due May 1.
