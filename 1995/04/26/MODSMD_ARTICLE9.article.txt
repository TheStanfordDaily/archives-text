# Students snooze for science and profit

### Tracy Jan 
While many Stanford students
headed south right after finals to
Loe Angeles and Mexico for spring
break, a group of 10 students
remained on campus to sleep
their way through the week.
William Dement, Sleep and
Dreams professor and director of
the Stanford Sleep Center, held
an experiment over the break
which analyzed the effects of
sleep. What made these students
relinquish a week of fun in the
sun to stay in their dorm rooms?
Sleep debt.
For every night a student does
not receive eight to 10 hours of
sleep, he or she incurs a sleep
debt. The average sleep debt for
college students is 50 to 100
hours.
According to Dement, this area
has never been a research priori
ty. "Evidence shows that all lost
sleep accumulates as a debt and
does not dissipate," he said. "It
impairs people. If you get rid of it,
you do better.
"It is better to get a lot of sleep
during spring break than party
ing at Ft. Lauderdale," he
advised. "You can get depressed
due to lack of sleep."
"Sleep debt costs America $100
billion a year in loss of productiv
ity and accidents," reported fresh
man Kate Singer, a participant in
the sleep study. Lack of sleep,
leading to poor concentration and
performance, makes a person irri
table and more likely to fall asleep
at the wheel or in class.
"Instead of sleep interfering
with the amount of time I have to
study, I now see sleeping as an
opportunity to rest," Singer said.
She is interested in taking Sleep
and Dreams next year. The course
will be offered only if 1,000 stu
dents sign a petition.
The students remained in their
dorm rooms over spring break
and were encouraged to sleep as
much as possible. To bring on
sleep, the blinds were drawn in
their rooms and the telephone
ringer was turned off. "We got rid
of distractions. No alarm clocks,
no nothing. We just slept as much
as we could, then we got up,"

junior Jensen Wong said.
According to Wong, an experi
ment testing the effect of receiv
ing enough sleep had never been
done before. "Although this 'dirty
study' was not tightly controlled,
it is a jumping-off point for more
research funding," he said.
"I wanted to be part of the
study because reducing any sleep
debt was a welcome option for me.
It was fun," Wong said. He said he
expected to sleep off his debt and
get back to a baseline schedule.
However, he said it never hap
pened.
"It is hard to erase months,
even years, of sleep debt," said
Wong. "I got to a point where I
couldn't sleep anymore."
Meeting in the early evening
the participants took perfor
mance tests focusing on memory,
reaction time and alertness. For
example, a square would appear

on the computer screen while the
student clicked on keys corre
sponding to the top, bottom, left
or right of the screen.
They also memorized four
pairs of words such as kitchen and
fork. After playing a game of
"Simon Says,"the students had
to match up the words, now sepa
rated into columns.
Besides daily computer tests,
the students also kept two run
ning logs and a daily sleep journal
of how they felt physically and
emotionally right before going to
bed and right after waking up and
a mood scale.
While many students in the
study complained that the testing
became tedious toward the end of
the week, all agreed they were
more efficient after they had sig
nificantly reduced their sleep
debts.
In addition, the students were

paid $20 for each day of the exper
iment.
Due to the experiment, fresh
man Siuping Low discovered that
she is a "morning person. I can't
sleep past 9 o'clock. The experi
ment was good because I learned
something about myself. Now
when I get really tired around 10,
I just sleep."
Now that spring quarter has
started and the work begins to
pile up again, Wong said "getting
back into the swing of things is
kind of hard."
"In the sleep-deprived mode
that we are in, it is hard to get up
in the mornings. The alarm clock
is almost painful," Wong said.
Singer said it was interesting
to participate in research. Once
an insomniac, she said the experi
ment did help to change her sleep
ing patterns. "I now have a better
attitude towards sleep," she said.
