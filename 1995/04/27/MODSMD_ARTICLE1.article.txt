## Commencement procession cancelled, dismissed as 'mob scene' 
### Colleen Krueger Senior staff writer 
Graduating seniors already planning
massive human tic-tac-toe games and
buying inflatable rubber dolls for their
graduation procession can cease their
preparations — the traditional proces
sional is being scrapped this year.
In an effort to shorten Commence
ment ceremonies and move the event
stage closer to its audience, the tradition
al procession of graduating seniors will
not be included in this year's ceremonies
at the Stanford Stadium, said Lois Wagn
er, director of University events and ser

vices at Stanford Events. The decision
was part of a larger overhaul of Com
mencement Weekend, Wagner said.
In the past, seniors have spent nearly
an hour parading across the stadium field
in various costumes, engaging in such
tomfoolery as wrestling matches, mas
sive conga lines and marriage proposals,
along with the ever present messages on
the tops of mortar-boards.
"Essentially what we're eliminating is
a procession which hasn't been a proces
sion for several years," Wagner said. "It's
been an enormous mob scene."
Beyond shortening the ceremony by
about 45 minutes and moving the stage

closer, Wagner said the change will de
crease the time relatives and friends have
to sit in the often-blistering sun, allow
parents and students to find each other
more easily before and after the ceremo
ny and give students a chance to sleep in
or go out to breakfast on graduation
morning. Wagner emphasized that stu
dents will still take part in processions
during their individual diploma-granting
ceremonies and into the spiritually fo
cused baccalaureate celebration.
"Clearly something is being taken
away, but at the same time something is
being gained," Wagner said. "We
felt that the gains outweighed the
losses in this situation."
But many members of the
senior class have expressed strong
opposition to the change, which
they say would mean the elimina
tion of an essential Stanford tra
dition they have been looking for
ward to for years.
"I'm really disappointed," said
senior Joe Chevalier. "I was look
ing forward to participating in all
this nuttiness — now I guess
we're all going to march into the
stadium in orderly rows. ... I
have friends who aren't even
going to buy caps and gowns now."
Senior Class President Sarah
Marie Martin said she had cer
tainly underestimated the feroci
ty of such opposition when the
class presidents agreed to the
change.
"Initially, when we contacted
people to see what they thought
about it, people were negative and
somewhat apathetic," she said.

"But since the letter (notifying
seniors of the change) has come
out.. . people are really upset."
The original proposal from Stan
ford Events would have had seniors
seat themselves individually before
the event, Martin said. The compro
mise version that the class presi
dents agreed to has seniors assem
bling together before the ceremony
and proceeding together to their
places in the stands through the
stadium tunnels.
"The decision was made with
the full approval of the senior
class presidents," Wagner said.
"We gave them the proposals and
they went out and talked to folks
and came back with an indication
that this would be acceptable."
Wagner and Assistant to the Pres
ident Jean Fetter met with the
class presidents in February,
Martin said.
But Senior Class President
Kevin Harrington said he felt the
decision to change or eliminate
the procession had been made
before administrators ever talked
to students.
"We just tried to compromise,"
he said. "It seemed pretty clear
that there was no way things were

going to be the same as last year."
Another possible reason for the
change could be the fact that, in
the past, relatives and alumni have
complained that the procession is
irreverent and vulgar. "[Com
plaints are] certainly there, they
certainly happen," Wagner said.
While calling such considera
tions "secondary," both Harring
ton and Martin admitted com
plaints probably had some effect
on the decision.
"I think it makes sense that if
parents, relatives and alumni call
and are disgusted it's going to
affect administrators and their
decisions," Martin said.
Though he is somewhat
resigned to the fact that the tradi
tional procession will not take
place this year, Harrington said
he encourages students to regis
ter their complaints.
"I have a friend who's going to
have a hunger strike in White
Plaza," he added.
And although Martin personal
ly supports the change, she too
encouraged people who are
strongly opposed to "do some
thing about their opinions, like
get together a petition or some

thing to make sure their feelings
are known."
"Some of the reasons (for the
change) are certainly valid,
though," Martin said. "This way,

people's grandmothers in
wheelchairs won't be dehydrating
in the sun."
But even the "grandmother
question" seems to provoke con

troversy.
"My grandmother's coming all
the way from Missouri, and she'd
sit outside all day to watch me
graduate," Harrington said.
