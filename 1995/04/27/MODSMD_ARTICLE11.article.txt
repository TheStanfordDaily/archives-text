# Hillel remembers Auschwitz liberation
## 
### Alda Leu 
Half a century has passed since the end of
World War 11, but for millions of Jews across
the country and here at Stanford, this day
marks the memorial of more tragic events.
Today, the Jewish holiday known as Yom
Hashoah — translated as the Day of Devasta
tion — is celebrated. This year also commem
orates the 50th anniversary of the liberation
of the concentration camp at Auschwitz.
Each year members of Hillel, a Jewish stu
dent organization, organize several programs
in remembrance of the community's devas
tating losses during the Holocaust.
Hillel's annual memorial will feature two
events this year, each with a different
approach and intent, said Rabbi Ari Cartun.
The first, last night's discussion with Holo
caust survivors, provided the factual back
ground to the Holocaust events, he said.
"In a few years there will be no Holocaust
survivors left, so it's important to get as
many witnesses' testimony as possible into
the public record now," Cartun said.

Tonight's evening of commemoration is
the more artistic and emotional segment, Car
tun said. At 7:30 p.m., the community will
gather for a memorial walk, which will leave
from Littlefield Plaza at the Business School
and proceed along Lasuen Avenue. At the
Lasuen Eucalyptus Grove, a service will be
held featuring prayers led by sophomore Jim
Finsten and songs led by Cantor Adi Wyner.
The "River of Souls" walk will feature
hundreds of floating candles trailing along
the pond, surrounded by lighted graves with
lucite faces of Holocaust victims.
"It is a bonding experience with more of a
community worship rather than 'God wor
ship' specifically," said senior Jessica Cohen,
who designed the artistic representations.
"This event, through its influential vehicles
of sound and sight, will make people feel
more connected with the Jewish community
and encourage them to reflect on their pur
pose as a Jew."
Holocaust Commemoration Day falls on a
different day each year under the Roman cal
endar because of the lunar Jewish calendar,

and its date has a particular significance to
the Jewish people.
Selected by the Israeli Knesset in 1953,
Yom Hashoah precedes Israeli Independence
Day by exactly one week, symbolizing the cre
ation of a homeland for persecuted Jews in
exile during the Holocaust.
The date is recognized by Jews across the
world, although the actual evacuation of
Auschwitz took place on Jan. 17, 1945.
Almost six million Jews — 72 percent of
all the Jews in Europe — were killed in the
Holocaust.
According to Cohen, many Stanford Jews
who do not attend other Hillel activities take
part in the Holocaust commemoration.
"There are two reasons that the Holocaust
is significant to us," Cartun said. "One, to
memorialize the dead — we do that several
times a year at memorial services at the end
of festivals. Secondly, the destruction of the
European Jewry was so utter and so com
plete and has so radically changed the course
of Jewish settlement in the world that it mer
its its own day."
