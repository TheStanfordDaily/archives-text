Unabomber mocks victim
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The Unabomber
taunted one of his injured victims for opening a
mysterious package that blew up, calling him a
"techno-nerd" in a letter released yesterday.
The text of the letter to Yale Computer Science
Prof. David Gelernter was distributed by the FBI
the same day another letter from the elusive
bomber was published by The New York Times.
"People with advanced degrees aren't as smart
as they think they are," the letter to Gelernter said.
"If you'd had any brains you would have real
ized that there are a lot of people out there who
resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are
changing the world and you wouldn't have been
dumb enough to open an unexpected package from
an unknown source," it added.
Gelernter was badly injured when a mail bomb
exploded in his office on June 24, 1993.

The letter was one of four mailed the same day
as the Unabomber's latest package, which killed a
timber lobbyist Monday in Sacramento.
Court strikes down gun law
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court
struck down a federal law banning gun possession
within 1,000 feet of schools yesterday, saying the
states — not Congress — have the authority to
enact such criminal laws.
The 5-4 decision throwing out the 1990 Gun-
Free School Zones Act stood in sharp contrast to
a longstanding court trend of deference to con
gressional power to regulate interstate commerce.
Congress stole power reserved to the states
when it enacted the law, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote as the court refused to reinstate
a former Texas high school student's conviction
for taking a gun to school.
