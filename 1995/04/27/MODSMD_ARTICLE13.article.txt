New details of Timothy McVeigh's
activities in the days before the
Oklahoma bombing surfaced yes

chilling warning to a friend that

pen.
Investigators also were trying to
trace McVeigh's movements after
the explosion that gutted the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building,
a source told The Associated Press.
One theory was that McVeigh
dropped off a still-missing col
league before he was arrested for
traffic and weapons violations.
Three witnesses placed McVeigh
in front of the federal building
moments before the explosion —
apparently before the truck carry
ing the bomb arrived, according to
the same source.

Revelations of McVeigh's
actions in the days before the
bombing came in a Wichita, Kan.,
courtroom as prosecutors sought
to take the friend, Terry Nichols, to
Oklahoma The judge granted their
request but delayed it until May 5
so Nichols could appeal.
As the investigation advanced,
the city and the nation paused to
observe a moment of silence at 9:02
a.m. — the precise moment of the
blast one week ago. Bells rang,
tears flowed and heads bowed as
searchers stood amid the ruins of
the collapsed federal building. The
death toll stands at 98.
In court, U.S. Attorney Randy
Rathbun said McVeigh called
Nichols from Oklahoma City on
April 16 and asked him to pick
McVeigh up. Nichols, 40, lives in
Herington, Kan., about 270 miles

north of Oklahoma City.
Rathbun, quoting what Nichols
told the FBI after he was taken in,
gave this account of what hap
pened next:
Nichols picked McVeigh up, and
as the two men drove north,
McVeigh told Nichols: "Something
big is going to happen." Nichols
responded: "Are you going to rob a
bank?" and McVeigh repeated,
"Something big is going to hap
ft
pen.
The bomb exploded the next
morning in Oklahoma City.
Minutes before the blast, and
apparently before the arrival of the
truck carrying the 4,800-pound
bomb, three witnesses saw
McVeigh in front of the federal
building, a law enforcement official
in Washington told the AP on con
dition of anonymity.
