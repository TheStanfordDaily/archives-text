## Settling harassment 
### 
Med School harassment
cases bring up questions
about progress on policy

LAST WEEK, the University
settled two sexual harass
ment cases involving profes
sors in the School of Medicine.
One case, involving Psychiatry
Prof. Seymour Levine (now retired)
included a financial settlement of
somewhere between $100,000 and
$700,000 (the exact figure wasn't
disclosed). In addition, Levine and
other University officials wrote let
ters of apology to Helen Bae, the
former staff member in Levine's
lab who brought the suit.
In the other case, Urology Prof.
Thomas Stamey faces financial
penalties and lost his department
chairmanship after a woman
brought sexual harassment
charges against him. Stamey has
denied that he harassed the
woman.
These cases stir mixed feelings.
One the one hand, harassment
cases at Stanford are receiving the
serious punishment they warrant,
and progress in policy is being
made. On the other hand, one is
left with the feeling that more
work can still be done to let people
know harassment will not be toler
ated at this university.
Especially shocking in the sec
ond respect is the case of Levine.
When Bae first brought her
charges, the only punishment
Levine received was a letter of rep
rimand. This meager punishment
was meted out even though Levine
had previous harassment com
plaints logged against his name,
dating back to 1977.
The initial punishment was
obviously inadequate. It was so
minor that Helen Bae had to file a
law suit to receive just compensa
tion — a suit which has now been
settled. The University needs to
take from this case the lesson that
letters of reprimand alone are
almost never adequate when sexu

al harassment has occurred. Real
penalties — including loss of
money and loss of professional
standing — are often more appro
priate.
Fortunately, Stanford has been
learning its lesson for a couple of
years. Since Bae worked in
Levine's lab, the University has
created a new sexual harassment
policy that seems well written. The
policy allows accusers to maintain
different degrees of anonymity at
their discretion and approach a
panel of harassment advisers for
anything ranging from casual
advice to a formal investigation.
This policy has sparked more
than 50 consultations in its first
year. The Stamey case, now set
tled, was the first formal com
plaint under the plan. Clearly, the
situation is improving.
But Stanford must not rest on
its laurels. Specifically, the Univer
sity must address three areas:
acceptance, punishment and pub
licity of sexual harassment cases.
First, officials must let everyone
know that sexual harassment is
not acceptable at Stanford. The
harassment policy and advisers
have done well at this task, which
should reduce future harassment.
Second, Stanford must serious
ly punish harassment cases, not
just give slaps on the wrist. Hit
harassers in the pocketbook and
people will notice. Remember that
letters alone seldom suffice. Of
course, as University President
Gerhard Casper has pointed out,
these complaints must be investi
gated fully before punishment. Yet
we should also remember that the
incidence of false harassment com
plaints is most likely small, due to
the risk borne by the person bring
ing a harassment claim.
Which leads to the third point
— publicity. Stanford must come
up with a way to publicize cases
and settlements, even those in
which the participants are anony
mous, so people know that they
can complain without fear of retri
bution and that their problems
will be taken seriously.
