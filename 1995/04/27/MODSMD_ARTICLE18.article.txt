## Beyond supermarket justice 
### 
AFEW MONTHS ago, when the coun
try was in the throes of a bizarre
example of greed and power, when lit
tle kids were reshuffling their baseball cards
in a hands-on brush with supply-side eco
nomics, and when national security seemed
a sure bet, I was buying milk. Non-fat, of
course.
The woman ahead of me was making
benign supermarket chat with the man
behind the counter as he dragged a carton of
Tropicana over a laser beam that came dan
gerously close to self-awareness.
Treading softly into the realm of sports,
that common ground between the social
classes where people connect without
offense, talk turned to the empty ballparks.
The woman, obliquely mentioning that she
was the president of the local Little League,
chimed in that "the kids are so disappointed
they can't go to the big games. It breaks my
heart."
Glancing up from the register as the
computer chirps slowed to a stop, the man
behind the counter tried to pique her inter
est in social change. "If you could get all the
kids in Little League to send handwritten
letters to the players, owners and Robert
Reich, we could get the game going again. I
know we could."
The orange juice lady looked up, briefly,
dismissively. Her pen stopped filing in the
blank lines of her check. Then, without
reflection, she retorted, "Well, it's really not
my problem." With that, she grabbed her
paper-inside-plastic bag and swished out.

The man just shrugged. I bought my
milk.
Baseball's back, the kids are happy, but
the tinny echo of her dictum remains.
The 50th anniversary of the liberation of
Auschwitz is hovering. And we're approach
ing the final chances to actually speak to
witnesses of that dark event about the
banality of evil and the ease of a slip into the
"it's not my problem" frame of mind.
On Holocaust memorial day, it's almost
cliche to start quoting Santayana about
remembering the past. Guarding against
complacency and reviewing the Milgrim
experiment. Looking for insight into our
selves we ask, again and again, where was
America? Where was humanity? It's still
hard to say.
Today, we don't have neat rows of brain
washed teens chanting their undying com
mitment to a dictator. But we do have a
resurfacing of xenophobia, of let-me-take
care-of-mine, and of get-the-undeserving
out-of-my-way.
But amidst this sharp political climate,
there's room for hope.
Last week, in die middle of America,
good people dropped their kids off on the
second floor, went to do their work â€” and
the side of the building crumbled.
Contradicting pessimism, and paradoxi
cal to nature, humanity was there. In an
outpouring of support for the victims of
Oklahoma City, there was a salve for the
wounds of "cowardice and evil" Heroes
risked their lives and sometimes, like a res

cue nurse with four children of her own,
actually had life snapped away. Where
hopes were charred like the ruins of that
building, people recognized that it was their
problem.
This time, it seemed, what's wrong with
the world was standing very close to what's
right.
The pain close to home is a reminder of
raging injustices, below the front page fold,
in far away places, of people who perhaps
don't look enough like us to tug at our
insides. In the midst of watching history in
motion, we have the ambivalent luxury of
bearing witness, again, and making
informed decisions in light of a brutal past.
Reflections on the Holocaust and human
evil lead to ambiguity and frustration, but
they are worth some time and thought.
Hopefully more time than it takes to ring up
some milk.
Beyond supermarket justice.
A hiatus from baseball is not comparable
to widespread evil, but the sentiment of,
"It's not my problem," transcends bound
aries. Like the rescue workers, bolstered by
compassion and altruism, who stepped
inside a teetering building held together by
loose wires and sliding slabs of concrete, it is
our problem.
It's up to us to remember. It's up to us to
act.

In memory, with hope.
