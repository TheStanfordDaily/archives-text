'Anal-retentive 9 law students should be kept from public

OK, I'M ONLY going to say this
once: Law students should be
banned from all public places on
campus. That's right. Boycotted.
Exiled. Vanquished. Tarred and feath
ered.
It's not that hard to do. Just give
each law student a large blue-and-yel
low beanie to affix to his or her
bogged-down noggin. You've got the
beanie, expect to be caned and lashed
off campus grounds. You don't, you're
safe. Problem solved. Keystone Lites
all around.
Don't misunderstand. I don't have
anything against law students in
themselves. They can't help being
anal-retentive, obnoxious, snooty,
haughty or self-important. It comes
with the status. But can't they be
themselves somewhere else? Our expe
rience as Stanford undergraduates
should not be tainted by having to
endure contact with the pre-judicial
subspecies, thank you very much.
Forget jurisprudence, due process,
habeas corpus and all that. Just get rid
of them. A simple application of some
good old easy-going common sense
should make it clear that these law

types are a stain on the Stanford door
mat, an eyesore on an otherwise pleas
ant, fun place.
I wouldn't be so opposed to law stu
dents walking around on campus if
they actually — gasp! — retained some
semblance to good-natured humans.
But they seem to think that the large
stone letter flanking Palm Drive —
"S" — is a license to use Stanford as a
place to practice their butt-clenched,
shnozz-raised, briefcase-toting speed
walk.
Take, for example, the pathetic cou
ple I encountered in White Plaza the
other day. He: A sour expression of
perceived oppression, wrinkle-free
Dockers and a turtleneck. She: a sour
expression of self-imposed repression,
showcasing the very outfit the store
window mannequin was wearing. GAP
poster children. Y'all know the kind.
So anyway, there I was, minding my
own, casually flipping through an old
issue of Cosmo, when I heard what
seemed to be the cries of a hundred
drowning lemmings. I looked up to
investigate, and there speed-walking
by, were Fred "Lips" Mandarich and
Amanda Hugginkiss, arguing about in

flagrante delicto, quid pro quo, lipsus
linguae and other cool Latin phrases.
Don't you know I tried to be friend
ly. "Would you mind not walking in
front of me?" I said. "Your presence is
really irritating."
I expected them to yield to someone
with actual authority to be lounging
on the beautiful grounds of our lush
campus. I didn't expect to be leveled
with a karate kick of wit and elo
quence.
"I'm sorry," Lips said, using the
butt of his Cross pen to straighten his
thick glasses, "I wasn't aware of the
policies regarding unrightful appear
ance with intent to annoy."
I mean. The mock-trial courtroom is
the other way.
I'm telling you, there's no reasoning
with these people. It's too bad that
taking a large steel-toed boot to
defenseless rodents is not politically
correct. "And plenty of messy residue!"
Of course, it wouldn't fix the other
problem of uncoordinated law stu
dents, unable to negotiate the bikers
riding through Law School breeze
ways, panicking and jumping into
passing bicycles. I understand. It's

hard to walk in a straight line after
staring at old editions of Black's Law
all day. But at least that problem
would be kept within the confines of
the Law School.
Outside the Law School, the grass
would remain free of diligent law stu
dents reading briefs and writing prac
tice depositions. The paths would no
longer present the problem of bike
fearing law students who have yet to
master the basics of ambulation. The
Coffee House once again would be
occupied by relaxing undergrads, swill
ing beer and piecing together the
details of their behavior at the last
campus party.
For now, such a blissful state will
have to remain imaginary. The world
would be such a better place if Stan
ford administrators laughed off whiny
law students. Wait, never mind. They
already do. Attention Gerhard Casper!
Repeat after me: "Law students should
be banned from campus public areas."
That's right. Boycotted. Exiled. Van
quished. Tarred and feathered.
Oops. I said it twice.
