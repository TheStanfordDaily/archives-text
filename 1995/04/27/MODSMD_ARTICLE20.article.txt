# Oversensitivity about Elders is unnecessary and reflects ignorance
## 
### 
In defiance of a wise man's advice to
"never argue with a fool â€” people won't
be able to tell the difference," I must
respond to Greg Martellotto's letter crit
icizing the administration of Dr. Joyce
lyn Elders' speech. He complains that
the Q&A "could have been limited in
time or stopped altogether once stu
dents began to leave."
Before the speech, Dr. Elders clearly
told us she wanted to remain on stage

as long as the audience had questions;
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and Stan
ford-in-Government do not make a prac
tice of saying "screw you" to speakers'
wishes. Martellotto could not have
known this, but I suppose it is unfair to
expect utter ignorance of facts to pre
vent him from exercising his God-given
right to foam at the mouth.
So in spite of his ridiculous concern
that Dr. Elders is "southern-bred and
more sensitive to etiquette," he appears
far more sensitive than the good Doctor.
Also, regardless of Dr. Elders' wishes,
what brand of "etiquette" would allow
his hypersensitivity to trump the aggre
gated desires of eager questioners, a
willing speaker and hundreds of people

who remained to hear the exchanges?
Martellotto also whines about the
tone of Q&A: One student "just wanted
to argue with the Surgeon General."
Well, why on earth did we bring Elders
here, to exchange gardening tips? Some
of us agree with her views, some dis
agree. His concern for etiquette appar
ently prevents him from appreciating
what was an intelligent, exciting politi
cal conversation between Stanford stu
dents and a major figure in health poli
cy.
Another brilliant complaint: Stu
dents only gave Dr. Elders a "half
hearted standing ovation." Is there such
a thing? What should we have done,
applauded on piggyback? Released

streamers from the ceiling? Dr. Elders
was in good spirits for the remainder of
the evening; I can guarantee you that
she did not spend the flight home cry
ing, "Well, sure, I got a standing ova
tion. . . but, boy, was it half-hearted."
Dr. Elders is a grownup; she wasn't
offended by any of the zillion "etiquette
breaches" that only Martellotto seems
to have perceived. Perhaps if he could
get over his hyper-concern about other
people's sensitivities being offended, he
could flrd something more socially pro
ductive to do with his time than writing
asinine letters to The Daily.
