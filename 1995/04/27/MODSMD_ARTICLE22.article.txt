'Library scandal 9 can be settled with more respect and sensitivity

IAM WRITING in response to Henry
Robles' vilification and chastisement
of the entire undergraduate commu
nity and, in particular, his demand that
the undergraduate population be
banned from the law library. My initial
reaction was one of anger and disbelief
— I could not believe that a member of
the Stanford community would, in try
ing to support a position, no matter how
deserving this claim is, call upon such a
primitive line of defense. In other words,
I found it highly amusing and slightly
offensive that people enrolled at such an
elite university would appeal to the "us
them" paradigm that has created ten
sion, strife and incredible misunder
standings between innumerable groups,
both on this campus and throughout the

world. I'd like to address what I see as
the real issue underlying my potential
expulsion from the law library and from
who knows how many other facilities
that Stanford now so freely offers
me....
Let me first say what I do not think
this issue is all about. I do not feel that
the issue is whether or not all under
graduates are inherently ill-intentioned,
giggling, immature, adolescent-like or of
the dimwitted persuasion. I think that
most people on this campus would be at
least skeptical of the claim that all
undergraduates fit the colorful and yet
highly negative description you have
provided, based on a handful of your
own encounters.
The issue is not whether or not

undergraduates, by the very virtue of
being undergraduates, should be
banned from the law library, as you
suggest. To my knowledge, Stanford
undergraduates contribute much, in
terms of money, insight and vitality, to
the community and to the University.
From my experience, friends that study
at the law library are often students
who cannot find their resources any
where else or, needing to "get away
from it all" (the dorm, the crammed
cubicles of Green at finals time), opt for
a different environment. And I know no
undergraduate students who would
object to a graduate student setting foot
into Green or Meyer, simply because he
or she was a graduate student. The
issue, I feel, is simply one of what, as

people and as students, we need and
deserve to thrive in the Stanford com
munity.
What this means is that there are
some behaviors which, in certain envi
ronments (such as libraries), are simply
inappropriate. As a general rule of
thumb, loud or boisterous talking or bla
tant displays of affection do not belong
in a library. Again, I do not feel that
these behaviors are necessarily accurate
characterizations of the undergraduate
community. I do not even feel that they
are innate qualities in any particular
group of people, and to not realize that,
I feel, means that you are missing out
one of the main parts of a Stanford edu
cation.
I do not claim to have a quick-fix

solution to the "library scandal," but
something tells me that there may not
be one. As a student, I would like to sim
ply urge people to be more respectful,
more sensitive and more flexible with
respect to others' concerns. There is,
perhaps, a shortage of these basic
human attributes and behaviors which
has contributed to conflicts such as
these. In a way, I am saddened that this
had to become an issue at all; but, on
the other hand, it gave me a chance to
get on my soapbox and tell people that
we cannot assume that we are any bet
ter than anyone else, or that the next
person deserves any less respect than we
do. Respect goes both ways.
