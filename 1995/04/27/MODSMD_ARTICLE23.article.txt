## Tennis players take aim at Pac-10 individual titles Can De Silva surprise the field again? 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's tennis
squad (21-2 overall, 10-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division) has proved its superiori
ty as a team in the Pac-10. Now,
its members have the chance to
shine individually at the Pac-10
championships in Ojai, Calif., this
weekend.
Five singles competitors and
three doubles squads will test
their mettle against the top play
ers around the Pac-10 South and
from other Pac-10 schools such as
Washington, Washington State
and Oregon.
Stanford reigns as eight-year
Pac-10 South champions and cur
rently holds a 10-consecutive
dual-match win streak. The team
navigated its way through a tough
Pac-10 schedule without defeat,
an impressive statistic given the
fact that five of the six teams in
the division rank among the top
nine teams in the nation.
Now the Cardinal has the
opportunity to turn even more
heads with possible doubles and
singles Pac-10 championships.
Yet Stanford refuses to allow the
weekend's festivities in Ojai to
disrupt the wave of momentum
that will send it down the coast to
Pepperdine next week for the
NCAA championships.
"I think it gives us the rest
that we sorely need, mental more
than physical," said head coach
Frank Brennan. "They'll go all
out; it's just that some of them
have motivational problems if it's
not a team thing. My feeling
about Ojai is that it gives you a

chance to decompress a little bit.
"It's really fun," he continued.
"It's different because it's an indi
vidual competition, it's a beauti
ful sight, and you can't really
hurt yourself, you can only help

yourself. If you play well, you
knock a few people off, it adds to
your confidence."

by storm as a freshman, hopes her good fortune continues in 1996.
five entries to the singles draw and
two doubles teams, leaving two sin
gles and one doubles opening for
the northern Pac-10 schools. Addi
tional teams from the Pac-10 South
fill in any remaining slots.
The Cardinal singles lineup fea
tures sophomore All-American
Katie Schlukebir, seeded third in
the draw overall, and freshmen
Ania Bleszynski, seeded seventh.
Red hot redshirt senior Kim Shas
by will not make the trip due to an
intense academic load.
"If Katie gets to the finals and
plays [Keri] Phebus or something,
that could be great," Brennan said.
"She needs a couple more wins to
keep her confidence going. It's a
real good opportunity for Ania to
decompress. She's scraped out a
few good wins. Now she should go
out there and open up with both
barrels and play the kind of tennis

she knows how to play."
The Pac-10 should not need any
reminder of Stanford's third com
petitor, sophomore Sandra De Silva,
who shocked the tennis community
in Ojai last year. De Silva returns to
the site where she came from her
No. 6 position in the Cardinal lineup
to win the Pac-10 singles champi
onship as a freshman. Julie Scott, a
freshmen this season, looks to pull a
"De Silva" in this year's draw, com
ing off an impressive dual-match
season at the No. 5 slot.
The Cardinal's final singles
entry, redshirt senior Amy
Chiminello, has the most experi
ence in the Stanford lineup, and
will try to utilize it throughout the
bracket.
Stanford doubles, on fire as of
late, seeks to take advantage of hav
ing an additional third team in the
bracket. California is the only other
team to enter three squads in the
draw. Schlukebir and Bleszynski,
the Cardinal's No. 1 tandem, seek
revenge for a recent loss. Seeded
second overall, the Cardinal duo

can find a rematch of last week's
match against Pam Nelson and
Keirsten Alley of Cal, the top seed,
if both tandems reach the finals.
With the absence of Shasby,
Chiminello and sophomore doubles
specialist Emily Burt will team up
for the bracket. Shasby and Burt
had been on a tear in recent match
es, clinching both the Cal and
UCLA dual-match victories for the
Cardinal.
A new doubles squad of Scott
and junior co-captain Beth Berris
will get oriented with each other
during the tournament. Brennan
will most likely officially enter that
team at the No. 3 doubles position
for the NCAA championships,
allowing Chiminello to concentrate,
both mentally and physically, on
singles.
In addition to these two draws,
the tournament will release an invi
tational draw for the teams' lower
players, announced at the onset of
the tournament. Berris, Burt and
junior Wendy Sacks will most likely
represent the Cardinal.
