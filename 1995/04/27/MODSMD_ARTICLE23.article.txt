## Tennis players take aim at Pac-10 individual titles Can De Silva surprise the field again? 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's tennis
squad (21-2 overall, 10-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division) has proved its superiori
ty as a team in the Pac-10. Now,
its members have the chance to
shine individually at the Pac-10
championships in Ojai, Calif., this
weekend.
Five singles competitors and
three doubles squads will test
their mettle against the top play
ers around the Pac-10 South and
from other Pac-10 schools such as
Washington, Washington State
and Oregon.
Stanford reigns as eight-year
Pac-10 South champions and cur
rently holds a 10-consecutive
dual-match win streak. The team
navigated its way through a tough
Pac-10 schedule without defeat,
an impressive statistic given the
fact that five of the six teams in
the division rank among the top
nine teams in the nation.
Now the Cardinal has the
opportunity to turn even more
heads with possible doubles and
singles Pac-10 championships.
Yet Stanford refuses to allow the
weekend's festivities in Ojai to
disrupt the wave of momentum
that will send it down the coast to
Pepperdine next week for the
NCAA championships.
"I think it gives us the rest
that we sorely need, mental more
than physical," said head coach
Frank Brennan. "They'll go all
out; it's just that some of them
have motivational problems if it's
not a team thing. My feeling
about Ojai is that it gives you a

chance to decompress a little bit.
"It's really fun," he continued.
"It's different because it's an indi
vidual competition, it's a beauti
ful sight, and you can't really
hurt yourself, you can only help

yourself. If you play well, you
knock a few people off, it adds to
your confidence."

by storm as a freshman, hopes her good fortune continues in 1996.
