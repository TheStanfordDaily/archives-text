# Men hoping to tune-up for NCAA run
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
When your team begins and
ends the regular season ranked
first in the nation, there is not
much to play for at an individuals
tournament scheduled smack in
the middle of the last dual match
of the year and the start of the
NCAA championships.
True, this tournament is the
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships. But it is hard to imagine
that after a perfect regular sea
son, the Stanford men's tennis
team (23-0 overall, 10-0 in the
Pac-10 Southern Division) will
have anything on its mind besides
its impending trip to Athens, Ga.,
for a shot at something a lot big
ger than a Pac-10 crown. Today
through Sunday in Ojai, Calif.,
the Cardinal will play matches
that can only be seen as prepara
tion for a final shot at the nation
al championship.
Putting motivation problems
aside, Stanford's top five singles
players will compete amongst a
field of the Pac-10's top 32 play
ers for the Pac-10 Individual
Championship, and all three Car
dinal doubles teams will vie for
the doubles title.
Stanford head coach Dick
Gould thinks the tournament will
be a welcome change of pace for
his well-tested team.
"Now we have to go down to
Ojai, sharpen up, and stay
healthy. It will be a nice change
from the blood and guts of the
dual meets."
Gould will be looking especially
for his doubles teams to improve
their play. Stanford has lost the
doubles point to good teams more
than once this season, the last
instance coming against USC last
Friday.
"It is going to be very difficult
to win NCAAs without the dou

bles point," Gould admitted.
The Cardinal's second-ranked
duo of freshmen Scott Humphries
and Paul Goldstein (36-6 overall)
are seeded atop the doubles draw
and will face Vuk Tapuskovic and
Roland Kupka of Arizona in the
first round.
Juniors Jim Thomas and Ricky
Becker (23-9), ranked 34th

nationally, will meet Arizona
State's Sargis Sargsian and Ser
gio Elias today. Sargsian is the
nation's No. 1-ranked singles
player.
Junior Jeff Salzenstein and
sophomore Grant Elliott (26-6)
will play Kyle Spencer and


Aaron Green â€” Daily file
Freshmen Paul Goldstein and Scott Humphries, ranked second
nationally, will be competing for the Pac-10 doubles title this weekend.
Manuel Ramirez of USC in first
round action. Stanford's No. 3
tandem has been placed in the
same half of the draw as
Humphries and Goldstein. The
freshmen defeated their elder
teammates in a semifinal third
set tiebreak of the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships held
earlier this year.
In singles, the No. 6-ranked
Salzenstein (34-9 overall, 20-3 in
dual matches) is seeded second
in the tourney. He will face Nick
Williams of Washington, whom
he defeated in the quarterfinals
of the Rolex / NorCal Intercolle
giate Championships, 6-2, 6-2,

last November. Barring any
upsets, the Stanford junior cap
tain appears headed for a third
round match against Arizona's
No. 1 singles player, Jan Ander
son, or UCLA's top singles play
er, Justin Gimelstob.
Also in Salzenstein's half of
the draw is teammate Thomas
(23-9, 18-4 in the Pac-10 South).
Thomas is ranked No. 54 and
will face fourth-seeded Michael
Hill of California in a tough first
round match. Hill defeated
Thomas at the Rolex / NorCal
tournament, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
In the other half of the draw,
the No. 25-ranked Scott
Humphries (25-7, 16-3 in the
Pac-10 South) received an alpha
betical fifth through eighth seed
and will square off against
UCLA's Heath Montgomery in

the first round.
Humphries could meet team
mate Elliott (26-2, 21-2 in the
Pac-10 South) in the third
round, but only if Elliott can
overcome Cal's Casey Louie and
Sargsian. Elliott, who had an 18
dual-match win streak snapped
in the season's final meeting
with UCLA, lost to Louie in the
Rolex/NorCal tourney.
The No. 49-ranked Goldstein
(29-6, 20-2 in the Pac-10 South)
faces Fernando Samayoa of USC
in the first round. If he wins that
match, Goldstein would likely
face Bruin Robert Janacek fol
lowed by Trojan Brett Hansen.
No. 6 singles player Becker
will compete along with fresh
men Charles Hoeveler and
Misha Palecek in the Open Divi
sion.
