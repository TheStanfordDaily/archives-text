# Men hoping to tune-up for NCAA run
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
When your team begins and
ends the regular season ranked
first in the nation, there is not
much to play for at an individuals
tournament scheduled smack in
the middle of the last dual match
of the year and the start of the
NCAA championships.
True, this tournament is the
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships. But it is hard to imagine
that after a perfect regular sea
son, the Stanford men's tennis
team (23-0 overall, 10-0 in the
Pac-10 Southern Division) will
have anything on its mind besides
its impending trip to Athens, Ga.,
for a shot at something a lot big
ger than a Pac-10 crown. Today
through Sunday in Ojai, Calif.,
the Cardinal will play matches
that can only be seen as prepara
tion for a final shot at the nation
al championship.
Putting motivation problems
aside, Stanford's top five singles
players will compete amongst a
field of the Pac-10's top 32 play
ers for the Pac-10 Individual
Championship, and all three Car
dinal doubles teams will vie for
the doubles title.
Stanford head coach Dick
Gould thinks the tournament will
be a welcome change of pace for
his well-tested team.
"Now we have to go down to
Ojai, sharpen up, and stay
healthy. It will be a nice change
from the blood and guts of the
dual meets."
Gould will be looking especially
for his doubles teams to improve
their play. Stanford has lost the
doubles point to good teams more
than once this season, the last
instance coming against USC last
Friday.
"It is going to be very difficult
to win NCAAs without the dou

bles point," Gould admitted.
The Cardinal's second-ranked
duo of freshmen Scott Humphries
and Paul Goldstein (36-6 overall)
are seeded atop the doubles draw
and will face Vuk Tapuskovic and
Roland Kupka of Arizona in the
first round.
Juniors Jim Thomas and Ricky
Becker (23-9), ranked 34th

nationally, will meet Arizona
State's Sargis Sargsian and Ser
gio Elias today. Sargsian is the
nation's No. 1-ranked singles
player.
Junior Jeff Salzenstein and
sophomore Grant Elliott (26-6)
will play Kyle Spencer and

Freshmen Paul Goldstein and Scott Humphries, ranked second
nationally, will be competing for the Pac-10 doubles title this weekend.
