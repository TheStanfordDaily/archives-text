# Off to the Final Four
## Women's rugby team qualifies for championship play in Princeton 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
It's amazing what you can accom
plish if you take things seriously. This
weekend a determined Stanford
women's rugby team found out how
much it could accomplish in earning a
spot in the women's collegiate rugby
Final Four.
Stanford's berth into the national
championship tournament is the Car
dinal's reward for capturing the Pacif
ic Coast Territorial Championship
last weekend in Santa Cruz. In an

intense battle, the women upended
the favored defending champion Ore
gon State.
Stanford's first match pitted the
Cardinal's against Reed College. The
Northwest is rapidly becoming a
hotbed of women's rugby, and an out
standing Reed team demonstrated the
strength of the region.
Reed jumped out to an early 7-0
lead on a penalty try that followed a
blatant Cardinal foul. Stanford, how
ever, walked off the field at half time
with the momentum after evening the
score at seven with a last minute try

and conversion by the reliable junior
Amanda Edwards.
Junior Kalie Kim showed a sign of
brilliance to come by crossing the goal
line for the Cardinal. Kim played
spectacularly throughout the week
end and garnered tournament MVP
honors. Kim's tremendous level of
play probably earned her a spot on the
United States National Team, which,
coincidentally, is coached by Stanford
coach Franck Boivert.
The score didn't remain tied for
very long in the second half. Junior
flanker Jin Sun Park scored the sec

ond Cardinal try of the match, and a
successful conversion by Edwards
made the final score 14-7. The low
scoring reflects Stanford's dominant
defensive performance and patient
offense. The Cardinal employs a
sophisticated multiphase offense that
relies on patience and ball control, as
opposed to the quick strike.
"They have grown into a good
rugby team because they think about
their game," said Boivert. "They go
into the game with a tactical pur-
pose."
When the Cardinal stepped
onto the field for the final match
against Orgeon State, there was a
different feeling surrounding the
team. Stanford's performance
against Reed proved the team to
be more focused than in previous
matches.
Stanford inflicted all of its
damage against the Beavers in
the first half. Edwards put the
Cardinal ahead with a try and
conversion to make the score 7-0.
Stanford's next score came at the

hands of Park, who continued her
excellent play and scored her sec
ond try of the tournament.
Boivert recognized the flanker's
consistency.
"She was all over the place,"
Boivert said. "She's very quiet
but gets the job done."
The first half closed with a 12-
0 Stanford lead. The 12 points
would be the only points of the
entire match, for either team.
The same Cardinal plan of attack
that defensively controlled the
Reed game did itself one better in
shutting out Oregon State.
"Stanford played brilliantly,
they [the women] had their best
game of the season," said Boivert.
"Their intensity was excellent

throughout the whole game."
The final four takes Stanford
across the country to Princeton,
N.J., where the Cardinal will join
Penn State, Princeton and Air
Force in championship play.
Stanford will square off
against Penn State in the first
round. Preparation for the tour
nament will be made difficult by
the fact that the Cardinal knows
very little about the three other
schools. Boivert's game plan,
however, doesn't rely on scouting
reports, but Stanford's own abili
ty.
"It's very difficult to evaluate
the competition; therefore, we are
going to play our best rugby,"
Boivert said.
