It's amazing what you can accom
plish if you take things seriously. This
weekend a determined Stanford
women's rugby team found out how
much it could accomplish in earning a
spot in the women's collegiate rugby
Final Four.
Stanford's berth into the national
championship tournament is the Car

play probably earned her a spot on the
United States National Team, which,

defensive performance and patient
offense. The Cardinal employs a
sophisticated multiphase offense that
relies on patience and ball control, as
opposed to the quick strike.
"They have grown into a good
rugby team because they think about
their game," said Boivert. "They go
