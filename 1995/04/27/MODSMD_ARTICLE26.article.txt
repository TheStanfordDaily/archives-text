# Stuck in the pack as ASU rolls through
## Women's golf takes third place at Pac-10s 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
The second time wasn't a
charm for the Stanford women's
golf team this week.
Playing at the Trysting Tree
Golf Course on the campus of
Oregon State, where it had won a
tournament earlier in the year,
the Cardinal was not only unable
to grab a victory at the Pacific 10
Conference championships but
also saw how much of a gap there
was between the league's champi
on and its also-rans.
No. 1-ranked and two-time
defending national champion Ari
zona State pummeled the nine
team field — California just
began its golf program this past
year and did not elect to partici
pate in the tournament — and
expanded its lead in each round of
the three-day event.
Leading by nine strokes after
Monday's competition and 18
after Tuesday's, the Sun Devils
finished with a team score of 858
(six under par), which left them

33 strokes better than their near
est competitor. Their dominance
was evident in that the best three
rounds shot by any team during
the tournament were all played
by their golfers.
With Arizona State playing on
a different level, the rest of the
conference had to be content with
a battle for the second-place spot.
While No. 2 Stanford held a two
stroke edge over No. 4 UCLA
after the first day's play, the Bru
ins capitalized on the Cardinal's
erratic play Tuesday to take a
four-stroke lead heading into the
final day of competition. When
UCLA shot their third-consecu
tive 297 (nine over par) Wednes
day, it was enough to hold off the
Cardinal and a few others for the
runner-up trophy.
Stanford placed third with a
896, five strokes worse than the
Bruins, and barely better than
Arizona (897) and Oregon (898),
which finished in fourth and fifth,
respectively.

Arizona State All-American
Wendy Ward, who has placed in
the top two in every tournament
that she has played this year, won
the individual title, firing a five

under-par 211. Arizona's Heather
Graff (212) played her best golf of
the year, en route to a second
place finish, while Sun Devil
Kellee Booth's third-place show
ing (213), included a course
record 66 in yesterday's competi
tion.
Sophomore Andrea Baxter led
the way for the Cardinal, shoot

ing a 217, good enough for fifth
place. Fellow sophomore Mhairi
McKay (218) finished in a tie for
sixth, while junior Vicky Strada
(229) ended tied for 22nd. Seniors
Amy Lawrence (233) and Jamille
Jose (235) rounded out the scor
ing for the Cardinal, finishing
tied for 28th and 32nd, respec
tively.
