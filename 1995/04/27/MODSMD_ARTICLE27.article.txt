# Cardinal wins two
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
During a season in which
the Stanford softball team
has suffered several beatings
at the hands of more talent
ed and more experienced
opponents, the Cardinal
finally had a chance to give a
beating to someone else yes
terday. Stanford took advan
tage of the opportunity and
demolished the College of
Notre Dame 25-1 and 8-0 in
a doubleheader at El Camino
Field.
Stanford (14-26 overall, 1-
17 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) continued to show the
offensive firepower that has
carried the Cardinal through
a four-game winning streak.
Beginning with a Sunday
doubleheader sweep at Loy
ola Marymount, the Cardi
nal has put together its
longest consecutive win
streak since it began play as
a varsity sport last year.
"We're really playing
well," coach Sandy Pearce said.
"I'm proud of the level we've come
up to [as a team]. We play great
defense [and] we're really hitting
the ball well, (but] we just haven't
put it all together yet."
Yesterday's first game showed
that Stanford can be tough when it
does play well in all phases of the
game. The 25-run outburst was
highlighted by a 21-run rally in the
third inning. Four Cardinal play
ers had multiple hit games, led by
sophomore shortstop Summer
Lee's 2-for-3 performance. The
Cardinal leadoft hitter also walked
twice and scored four runs.
Stanford hit five doubles in the
contest, getting one each from
Lee, who leads the team with 11
doubles, junior center fielder Toni

Marengo, sophomore outfielder
Karla Starr, freshman third base
man Dawn Kobata and freshman
second baseman Becky Unruh.
Junior first basemen Caryn Oki
naga tripled in the game for one of
the Cardinal's seven extra-base
hits.
"When you score 21 runs [in
one inning], you kind of lose
count," Pearce said.
Although Stanford has always
managed to get enough base hits
to stay in games, prior to the Loy
ola series the Cardinal had trouble
putting hits together to produce
runs. For the Loyola game, how
ever, Pearce moved hot-hitting
Amanda Renteria from the ninth
spot to the No. 3 spot; Stanford
has scored at least four runs in
every game since the switch.
"I think it will real'- help us,"
said freshman pitc ■ T
Schulman, who sat h
and 16th games with ... >

ture in her back. "Amanda's been
hitting so well and Summer gets
on base a lot, so hopefully she'll
get to drive in some runs."
In the first game, Renteria was
2-5 with five RBIs, proving Schul
man's point. Junior catcher Lynn
Anderson had two hits, including
a triple. Unruh also had two hits
for Stanford.
Pearce let more of the bench
see action in the second game,
keeping the score more
respectable. Karla Starr led the
Cardinal, going 3-for-4. Okinaga
continued her torrid hitting, fin
ishing 2-for-3 with a double and
her first home run of the year.
Junior left fielder Katie Beattie
went 3-for-3 for Stanford, and
sophomore Megan Mackh
smacked a long triple in her first
action of the year.
"It was great to see Megan get
that triple after not playing that
much this year," Pearce said.
