With my most sincere condolences to Steve Sten

Double Bogey: With all due respects to
Tiger Woods, I think the freshman golf sen
sation might agree with me on this one â€”
The Daily is guilty of following the hype. Last
weekend, Woods was forced to leave the U.S.
Intercollegiate held at Stanford's home course

because of an injury. Without Woods, the Cardinal
won the team title, edging No. 6 Arizona State.
Senior Casey Martin, playing his final competition
at home, won the individual title, shooting a
seven-under 206. The Daily didn't run a photo of
Martin or any of the other three seniors who
pulled out the team's fifth championship of the
year, but a photo of Tiger "swinging before his
injury."
1996 + 4 = ?: Former Laker Magic Johnson
announced last week that he would like to return
to USA Basketball for the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta. When told that the competition for the
point guard spot had just been intensified, Dallas
Mavericks rookie and former Cal star Jason Kidd
said, "I guess I'll have to wait until 2002." Just
what Winter Olympic event are you expecting to
compete in, Jason?
Add Magic: In Sunday's paper, Johnson was
quoted as saying he would have liked to come back
to the NBA to play for the Lakers in the playoffs
(playoff rosters were due Monday). Is the NBA
starting to remind anyone else of the WWF?
