With my most sincere condolences to Steve Sten
strom and his family.
Double Bogey: With all due respects to
Tiger Woods, I think the freshman golf sen
sation might agree with me on this one â€”
The Daily is guilty of following the hype. Last
weekend, Woods was forced to leave the U.S.
Intercollegiate held at Stanford's home course

because of an injury. Without Woods, the Cardinal
won the team title, edging No. 6 Arizona State.
Senior Casey Martin, playing his final competition
at home, won the individual title, shooting a
seven-under 206. The Daily didn't run a photo of
Martin or any of the other three seniors who
pulled out the team's fifth championship of the
year, but a photo of Tiger "swinging before his
injury."
1996 + 4 = ?: Former Laker Magic Johnson
announced last week that he would like to return
to USA Basketball for the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta. When told that the competition for the
point guard spot had just been intensified, Dallas
Mavericks rookie and former Cal star Jason Kidd
said, "I guess I'll have to wait until 2002." Just
what Winter Olympic event are you expecting to
compete in, Jason?
Add Magic: In Sunday's paper, Johnson was
quoted as saying he would have liked to come back
to the NBA to play for the Lakers in the playoffs
(playoff rosters were due Monday). Is the NBA
starting to remind anyone else of the WWF?
Peak Performance: If you read about or fol

know that every year coach
Sadao Hamada focuses the
entire season on peaking at the
NCAA championships. Even in
the past few years, when the
Cardinal was highly-ranked and
a favorite to win the NCAA
crown, Stanford got stronger
when the title was on the line.
This year, Hamada's tactics
worked once again, as the Car

dinal, ranked No. 14 entering
the post-season, brought home
its third NCAA trophy in the
past four years. The balanced
squad won the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation and NCAA
Western Region titles, then
capped the year off with a sea
son-high score of 232.4 to
return to the victory stand.
Who's Next?: The NCAA
title captured by the gymnasts
brings Stanford's total for the
1994-95 school year to four, one
short of the national record.
UCLA won five titles in 1987-88

and the Cardinal matched that
number in 1991-92. As the
spring seasons come to an end,
teams to keep an eye on are
men's (No. 1) and women's (No.
5) tennis and men's (No. 2) and
women's (No. 2) golf. In the
past four years, Stanford has
racked up 17 NCAA titles, more
than any other school in the
nation.

After visiting Mo and Carie this
weekend, next week, Kyle takes
a look back at the ol high school
days.
