### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Peter Tuttle, a computer consultant at the
Stanford Data Center who was affectionately
known as the "techie's techie," died April 6 of
complications from AIDS-related pneumonia.
He was 54.
A memorial service for Tuttle will be held
today at 10:30 a.m. in Memorial Church with a
reception following in Turing Auditorium.
"This is a devastating loss," said Manager of
Network Integrations and Services group Tony
Navarrete. "Stanford brings in very special stu-
dents and faculty. It is often over
looked that they bring in special
staff.
"Peter almost had folk-hero
admiration here. He was one of the
nicest people I've ever met,"
Navarrete said.
Born in Boston on Jan. 13,
1941, Tuttle studied at Manor

Hall in Cambridge, Bard College in
New York and Boston University.
He moved to California in 1970
after accepting a position in the
University Wide Informations
Systems group at UC-Berkeley.
His career at Stanford began in
1977. He lectured at the Data Cen
ter and wrote teaching aids related
to the database system SPIRES,
which was developed at Stanford.
Considered an expert in his
field, Tuttle earned the reputation
for helping computer novices and

whizzes alike.
"Peter was the kind of person
that you could ask the most tech
nical or stupid questions and he'd
make you feel like what you were
asking was important," said
Navarrete.
For his dedication and consis
tent availability to students, Tut
tle received the University's Amy
J. Blue Award for staff excellence
in 1992.
Tuttle kept busy outside of the
computer lab as well. He volun

teered many hours to Project
Open Hand, an organization that
provides food for those living with
HIV and AIDS. He won a volun
teer of the month award for this
effort.
Also involved with the Boy
Scouts of America, Tuttle was rec
ognized with the Scouter of the
Year award in 1992.
Tuttle is survived by his wife of
24 years, Kathy, his son Ethan, his
daughter Abby, his sister Susan
and his father W. Norris Tuttle.
