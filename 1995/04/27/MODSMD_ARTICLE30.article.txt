Declaring the new global problems of the
21st Century to be over-population and envi
ronmental decline, Undersecretary of State
for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth spoke yes
terday afternoon to a near-capacity crowd at
Fairchild Auditorium.
Wirth, who was the keynote speaker for the
eighth annual Boething Lecture on Forests
and the Human Predicament, focused on bio
diversity, forests and humai: populations.
Paul Ehrlich, president of the Center for
Conservation Biology — the organization
sponsoring the event — introduced Wirth,
describing the former U.S. senator who got his
doctorate at Stanford as the "bright light on
the environmental front in Washington at the
moment."
"What I wanted to do today was share some
thoughts on a series of issues that increasing
ly define the next generation, the student gen
eration of leadership, and that are more and
more a part of the overriding mission of this
and all nations," Wirth began.
All over the globe, nations are beginning to
recognize their opportunity and their respon
sibility to look beyond the crisis of the moment
for the underlying causes, Wirth said. These
causes are making the world ever more com
plex and are redefining the priorities of long
term national security and global stability, he

added.
"We only need to contrast the experiences
of me and my children's generation to get a
sense of the shift," Wirth said. "In 1961,1 was
in the U.S. Army when the Berlin Wall went
up and we all thought that we were going to
war with central Europe.
"Thirty years later, my children sat on the
top of the remains of that same Berlin Wall,"
he added. "What a dramatic shift in genera
tional perspective."
Wirth said the void left by the end of the
Cold War has evoked various suggestions
about our national purpose. Some think we
ought to just worry about the defense of our
country but Wirth said he feels this ignores
our responsibility to ensure progress and hope
for the world of tomorrow.
A basic theme throughout Wirth's speech
was that times have changed and that we, as a
nation, need to follow those changes. In
today's world, new causes of international sta
bility — adding to the many old ones — are
problems such as soil erosion, air pollution,
overgrazing, lack of a fresh water supply,
shortages of forests, infectious diseases and
many others, he said.
One of the most important issues of the
21st Century is sustainable development —
the central concept agreed to at the 1992
Earth Summit, Wirth said.
"It means that the economies of the world,
including our own, should attempt to meet the

needs of today's generation without compro
mising or stealing from future generations,"
he said. "It's a concept rooted in the recogni
tion of the mutually reinforcing nature of eco
nomic, social and environmental progress.
"When the environment goes bankrupt so
does the economy," Wirth added. "This has
happened and is happening in places all over
the world."
The rapid degradation of life-support sys
tems for the entire globe illustrates our inter
dependence with nature and our changing
relationship with the planet, Wirth said. The
future of our nation and the world hinge on
whether we can strike a sustainable, equitable
balance between human numbers and the
planet's capacity to support life, he said.
"We are thinking about these things now
because the world's population has doubled
since 1960 and we have a growing capacity to
use resources and consume wastes," Wirth
said.
Wirth concluded by offering an agenda for
the future, adding that the world is looking to
the United States to set a precedent and is cry
ing out for our leadership.
"Our legacy depends on our ability to
understand and react to the new challenges of
the 21st Century," Wirth said. "The future
stability of the world is in the balance and it is
important to recognize the interdependent
nature of the new world order unfolding
before us."
