# No pain, no gain: Lycia on music

and the circle fades."

Some music, some emotions, should only
be addressed in the daytime, or at least in
the company of other people. Similar to
the difference between watching a horror
movie alone in a creaky old house at night
and seeing the same movie in the daytime in
a crowded theater, there is music which is so

depressing that one must be exceedingly

careful of downward effects it may have
Lycia, consisting of Mike Vanport-

fleet and David Galas, produces al
bums that are rivaled only by me-

dieval religious paintings in
their combination of gloom
and beauty. Albums such as i

"lonia," "Day in the Stark
Corner," "Wake" and

their latest, "The Burn
ing Circle and then
Dust," darkly and ele-

gantly evoke themes
and images of loss,
death, isolation and
despair.

However, Van
portfleet, Lycia's
founder, does
not describe the
group's songs or
song writing as solely
saddening: "I don't
set out for it to be de
pressing, 1 set out for
it to be emotionally

effective in one way or
another. Like when

Tangerine Dream does a
soundtrack to a movie and

it's really moody, no one
refers to that as being de

pressing, it just fits the mood
of the movie.

"I see what I do in the same
way. 1 personally prefer music which

is more wall of sound and moody, so
even if I'm really happy, I'm still going to

write that kind of music. I would probably
throw up it I had to sit and write happy music
all the time; I would definitely quit music be
cause for me it's like if you are a painter, you
can experiment, or you can paint like Nor
man Rockwell. It may look nice, but is it art?"
Galas concurred: "That's kind of how I
feel, too. Even if I'm in a great happy mood, I
might be recording the darkest song I've ever
heard in my life, but it cheers me up to hear a
great great moody song. I'll be like, 'Oh, God,
this is great.' It will burn right through you."
"Plus, what one person might perceive as
being depressing, another person might per
ceive as being beautiful. ... Someone will lis
ten to 'a Stark Corner,' and say ' That's the
most disturbing and depressing thing I've
heard,' and then two days later, I will get a let
ter saying it's the most beautiful thing they've
ever heard, so I guess it all depends on who is

receiving it and what their mind state is,
more than what my mind state is," Vanport
fleet finished.
Based in Arizona, Vanportfleet and Galas
are well-acquainted with symbols of heat
and burning, and expect that their brand
of "moodiness" to change when they move to

the midwest next year.
"I'm sure that when we

move to Ohio, jour

music) will

still be

isolat

Ed but it will
be blizzard iso

lated instead of desert isolat

ed. T lie blizzard one is more frightening be
cause it is the more isolated one, kind of like
in the end of that movie, 'The Shining.' The
other one [the desert] is just like being dizzy
and standing in the sun. It's like the differ
ence between hot and cold. Hot, you are
more dizzy, but cold you are much more
aware, much more uncomfortable," Van
portfleet said.
Galas and Vanportfleet are moving to
Ohio both in order to be more conveniently
located for touring, and for a change in
weather patterns.

Despite dissatisfaction with current mete
orological conditions and exorbitantly de
pressed songs, Vanportfleet and Galas would
not entirely describe their music as a reflec
tion of their mental states.
"Most people listen to Lycia that meet us
are probably a little surprised. I think a lot if
it has to do with how 1 write music. I write it

slow with lots of affect, which
will give a natural

moodiness to it

but then,
m y

lyrics are
dark too. For

'lonia,' and 'Day in a
Stark Corner,' I probably wasn't too

happy and that was reflected. But I think a lot
of it has to do with (my] listening to darker
music since the early '80s. That can rub off on
you, too.
"I started out in the early '80s listening to
the typical stuff: Joy Division, Killing Joke,
Bauhaus, and 1 made evolution like a lot of
people that I know that have been fans of
dark music since then, listening to some of
the 4AD stuff, the industrial stuff. Then up to
today, it's a steady evolution." Vanportfleet
mused.

Lycia started casually. "I was in high
school and I had a guitar," Vanportfleet said,
"and I wanted to be the next Pete Townsend.
Then I got into punk, and then started play
ing with some bands here in Phoenix and
then listening to darker music and kept on
playing in bands until one day I started
Lycia."
The name Lycia is also mostly incidental:
"In college," explained Vanportfleet, "I stud
ied a lot of Greek mythology and geography
with a pretty strong concentration on the
Mediterranean, so I wanted something
Greek and I wanted something vague. I
didn't want something with a meaning be
hind it. So I pretty much just went to look at
some old maps of ancient Greece and I just
liked the way [ Lycia] looked. It was short and
I thought it looked good, and it was vague,
with no meaning behind it; but it still evokes
the Greek imagery."

After the recent release of a
live album, a side project
/--•iiori "Bleak," and"The

rturmno Circle and Then
Dust, Lycia is touring,
partially to "take a big live
i • •. ,l .

oreak right now so that
we are not just sitting
t in the studio. If we

hadn't been prepar
ing to do these live
shows, then we

would probably
lave another album
lone already," Van-
Jortfleet said.

Vanportfleet en
oys touring, but
lialas describes it

is a harrowing ex
perience: "I had a
hard time touring.

I sometimes don't
like it and just the
whole getting

ready for it and the
stress and a lot of
anxieties before you

tour. We're not a live

take the world and it's like, 'I could

tour forever,' and then the tour ends and
someone says, 'Do you want to do another

tour,' and you're like 'Oh God, not again.'"
Lycia will be playing in San Francisco this
Saturday. "From the little bit of traveling I've
done," Vanportfleet said, "[San Francisco] is
definitely a hot spot."
"San Francisco is so beautiful and I was so
surprised how friendly the people are," Galas
said, "In Phoenix, we get glared at."
Hopefully, the show won't be too depress
ing; it's a long drive home.

.. in the fire, in the pain
the hurtling spiral hums again, for the last time
ami then it fades
the dust it settles all around
and through the fire comes better days
and all these memories burn away
and the circle fades."

Some music, some emotions, should only
be addressed in the daytime, or at least in
the company of other people. Similar to
the difference between watching a horror
movie alone in a creaky old house at night
and seeing the same movie in the daytime in
a crowded theater, there is music which is so

depressing that one must be exceedingly

careful of downward effects it may have
Lycia, consisting of Mike Vanport-

fleet and David Galas, produces al
bums that are rivaled only by me-

dieval religious paintings in
their combination of gloom
and beauty. Albums such as i

"lonia," "Day in the Stark
Corner," "Wake" and

their latest, "The Burn
ing Circle and then
Dust," darkly and ele-

gantly evoke themes
and images of loss,
death, isolation and
despair.

However, Van
portfleet, Lycia's
founder, does
not describe the
group's songs or
song writing as solely
saddening: "I don't
set out for it to be de
pressing, 1 set out for
it to be emotionally

effective in one way or
another. Like when

Tangerine Dream does a
soundtrack to a movie and

it's really moody, no one
refers to that as being de

pressing, it just fits the mood
of the movie.

"I see what I do in the same
way. 1 personally prefer music which

is more wall of sound and moody, so
even if I'm really happy, I'm still going to

write that kind of music. I would probably
throw up it I had to sit and write happy music
all the time; I would definitely quit music be
cause for me it's like if you are a painter, you
can experiment, or you can paint like Nor
man Rockwell. It may look nice, but is it art?"
Galas concurred: "That's kind of how I
feel, too. Even if I'm in a great happy mood, I
might be recording the darkest song I've ever
heard in my life, but it cheers me up to hear a
great great moody song. I'll be like, 'Oh, God,
this is great.' It will burn right through you."
"Plus, what one person might perceive as
being depressing, another person might per
ceive as being beautiful. ... Someone will lis
ten to 'a Stark Corner,' and say ' That's the
most disturbing and depressing thing I've
heard,' and then two days later, I will get a let
ter saying it's the most beautiful thing they've
ever heard, so I guess it all depends on who is

receiving it and what their mind state is,
more than what my mind state is," Vanport
fleet finished.
Based in Arizona, Vanportfleet and Galas
are well-acquainted with symbols of heat
and burning, and expect that their brand
of "moodiness" to change when they move to

the midwest next year.
"I'm sure that when we

move to Ohio, jour

music) will

still be

isolat

Ed but it will
be blizzard iso

lated instead of desert isolat

ed. T lie blizzard one is more frightening be
cause it is the more isolated one, kind of like
in the end of that movie, 'The Shining.' The
other one [the desert] is just like being dizzy
and standing in the sun. It's like the differ
ence between hot and cold. Hot, you are
more dizzy, but cold you are much more
aware, much more uncomfortable," Van
portfleet said.
Galas and Vanportfleet are moving to
Ohio both in order to be more conveniently
located for touring, and for a change in
weather patterns.

Despite dissatisfaction with current mete
orological conditions and exorbitantly de
pressed songs, Vanportfleet and Galas would
not entirely describe their music as a reflec
tion of their mental states.
"Most people listen to Lycia that meet us
are probably a little surprised. I think a lot if
it has to do with how 1 write music. I write it

slow with lots of affect, which
will give a natural

moodiness to it

but then,
m y

lyrics are
dark too. For

'lonia,' and 'Day in a
Stark Corner,' I probably wasn't too

happy and that was reflected. But I think a lot
of it has to do with (my] listening to darker
music since the early '80s. That can rub off on
you, too.
"I started out in the early '80s listening to
the typical stuff: Joy Division, Killing Joke,
Bauhaus, and 1 made evolution like a lot of
people that I know that have been fans of
dark music since then, listening to some of
the 4AD stuff, the industrial stuff. Then up to
today, it's a steady evolution." Vanportfleet
mused.

Lycia started casually. "I was in high
school and I had a guitar," Vanportfleet said,
"and I wanted to be the next Pete Townsend.
Then I got into punk, and then started play
ing with some bands here in Phoenix and
then listening to darker music and kept on
playing in bands until one day I started
Lycia."
The name Lycia is also mostly incidental:
"In college," explained Vanportfleet, "I stud
ied a lot of Greek mythology and geography
with a pretty strong concentration on the
Mediterranean, so I wanted something
Greek and I wanted something vague. I
didn't want something with a meaning be
hind it. So I pretty much just went to look at
some old maps of ancient Greece and I just
liked the way [ Lycia] looked. It was short and
I thought it looked good, and it was vague,
with no meaning behind it; but it still evokes
the Greek imagery."

After the recent release of a
live album, a side project
/--•iiori "Bleak," and"The

rturmno Circle and Then
Dust, Lycia is touring,
partially to "take a big live
i • •. ,l .

oreak right now so that
we are not just sitting
t in the studio. If we

hadn't been prepar
ing to do these live
shows, then we

would probably
lave another album
lone already," Van-
Jortfleet said.

Vanportfleet en
oys touring, but
lialas describes it

is a harrowing ex
perience: "I had a
hard time touring.

I sometimes don't
like it and just the
whole getting

ready for it and the
stress and a lot of
anxieties before you

tour. We're not a live
band, we don't play live

in the garage and grunge
hnrc all the time and so it's

i.:.. j -r i lar( ] ant j difficult,
uui aitv.l a vvhile, you do your

first show, and you are in love. Its

" great and you feel like you could
take the world and it's like, 'I could

tour forever,' and then the tour ends and
someone says, 'Do you want to do another

tour,' and you're like 'Oh God, not again.'"
Lycia will be playing in San Francisco this
Saturday. "From the little bit of traveling I've
done," Vanportfleet said, "[San Francisco] is
definitely a hot spot."
"San Francisco is so beautiful and I was so
surprised how friendly the people are," Galas
said, "In Phoenix, we get glared at."
Hopefully, the show won't be too depress
ing; it's a long drive home.
