# Look ma, Shakespeare's got no clothes

### Linda Friedlieb 
For the second time this season, the
American Conservatory Theater has
posted signs in a theater lobby warning
patrons of impending male nudity. The first
occasion was the groups production of Tony
Kushner's "Angels in America," which con
tinues to raise eyebrows and issues at the
Marines Memorial Theatre.
Now the ACT warning signs have multi
plied. In addition to male nudity, cautionary
notes state that there will be brief female nu
dity and that cigars will be smoked on stage.
With all of these warnings, we could easi
ly misconstrue ACT's newest production to
be an avant garde wonder designed to shock
even the most modern of theater patrons.
Instead what we find inside the Stage
I >oor I heater is a non-radical production of
William Shakespeare's "Othello."
Ultimately a story of trust and betrayal,
Othello" is the tale of a Venetian Moor (the
title character played by Steven Anthony
Jones), his love for his wife Desdemona
(Maura Vincent), and the malevolent ma
nipulations of his "ancient" lago (Tony
Amendola).
Don't get me wrong, though. This version
of "Othello," directed by ACT Associate
Artistic Director Richard Seyd, definitely
wouldn't have appeared on stage in 1604,
when the Bard first completed this adapta
tion of the Italian romance, "II Moro di
Venezia."
Aside from the fact that ACT casts women
in the female roles (unlike 17th Century
British troupes), this production of "Othel
lo features a modernist set designed by Kate
Edmunds which emphasizes the internal
mind rather than external props.
A black and gray frame provides a univer
sal backdrop, squares and rectangles are cut
out to serve as doors and windows, and min
imal props are brought in to provide texture.
All color comes from sheets of light and col
ored beams are also used to create an atmos
phere of suspicion and mistrust which en
velopes the stage.

In addition, content-wise, there is a hint
of the homo-erotic in the relationship be
tween Othello and lago, highlighted through
the body language and word emphasis of
Jones and Amendola.
I he male nudity— which occurs as Oth
ello takes a bath assisted by lago — appears
extraneous unless the scene is intended to
suggest a more intimate relationship than
that of the average servant and master. In the
written version of the play, the scene takes

place only "in a garden."
Ultimately, "Othello" should really be ti
tled "lago," honoring the villain who steals
the show rather than the tragic hero. Amen
dola takes us on a ride as he plots and
schemes his way through scene after scene.
Using Shakespeare's asides and apostrophes,
he lures us into the role of conspirator in his
Machiavellian schemes.
Amendola uses his facial expressions to
provide comic relief, lifting his eyebrows

high after Cassio (Kemi Sandri) says"I never
knew a Florentine more honest (than Iago)."
As Othello, James takes more than a mo
ment to settle into his skin, but in the end
turns in a fine performance as the Moor dri
ven mad by jealousy and innuendo. One ex
ception to the fine-performance generaliza
tion comes in a scene when Othello falls into
an epileptic fit brought on by his imagina
tion and confusion concerning his wife's
faithfulness; Jones literally flops to the floor,
causing us to wince in pain and at first think
he might have died a few scenes earlier than
expected.
Vincent, as the idealized Desdemona,
shows as much spunk and alacrity as can be
expected of a female in a Shakespearean
work, and Domenique Lozanoas her servant
Emilia (the unfortunate wife of malevolent
Iago) turns in an excellent finishing perfor
mance as she confronts her spouse with his
treachory and exposes him to unbelieving
Venetian officers.
Providing comic relief as Roderigo, J)an
Hiatt (most recently featured in "Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern are Dead") sports
the only American accent in the cast, adding
an extra-foppish twist to his portrayal of the
desperately lovelorn suitor, mourning his
own loss of Desdemona.
Ultimately, almost every Shakespearean
tragedy ends with a minor character survey
ing the carnage before him and offering to go
and report the tragic happenings to the soci
ety at large.
In the case of Othello, that minor charac
ter is Lodovaccio, an uncle to Desdemona.
Here, I take his place in offering a report on
a tragedy whose performance is far from
tragic.
