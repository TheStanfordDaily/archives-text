# Stanford Savoyards are on guard with 'Yeomen'
## 
### Gabriela Teodorescu 
A dashing soldier, a lovelorn maiden,
Beefeaters in the Tower of London and
a cast of talented Stanford affiliates are
the ingredients in a concoction of chivalry
and intrigue in "The Yeomen of the Guard,"
the Stanford Savoyards' newest Gilbert and
Sullivan production. Gonsidered their best
collaboration by both lyricist Gilbert and
musical maestro Sullivan, the operetta incor
porates twists and turns that are rare to the
duo's repertoire.

"It's a really good show musically, one of
Sullivan's best," said lan Stockdale, a 14-year
Savoyard veteran. "It's the most serious of the
operettas. Not everyone ends up happily ever
after."
Set in 16th-Century England, "Yeomen"
tells the suspenseful and desperate tale of the
debonair Colonel Fairfax, wrongly impris
oned and sentenced to death for sorcery. The
backfiring escape schemes by his admirer
Phoebe, and the wandering comedian lack
Point, help wind the tale against the mysteri
ous backdrop of the Tower of London. Addi
tionally, the Yeomen and the townspeople
play a uniquely integral role in the story,
adding atmosphere and excitement to the
production.
Stockdale is also quick to point out the
comic quality of the show, along with its dar
ing plot and musical ensembles. "There's a
lot of good comedy. Its a really ambitious
show dramatically," he said.
True to Gilbert and Sullivan tradition, the

show features eloquent and bantering chorus
numbers, including "I Have a Song to Sing,
O!," made popular by Peter, Paul and Mary,
and a rich selection of duets, trios and quar
tets. "The chorus is so important in Sullivan,"
said cast member Ruth Leibig. "Being in the
chorus is a part in itself for both men and
women. It makes the production bigger and
more fun."
In their 22nd year, the Savoyards are a self
supported drama group composed of stu

dents, staff, alumni and the community.
Many members get their first taste of dra
matic production, either on or off stage,
through the involvement. In addition to pub
licizing and funding their two annual shows,
the Savoyards build the set and costumes
themselves. All told, close to 100 people col
laborate for each show, including a 30-mem
ber orchestra and a cast of between 35 and 45
actors.
Named after the Savoy Theatre in London,

which housed the first operettas and was es
pecially built for Gilbert and Sullivan pro
ductions, the Savoyards draw primarily from
the comic opera of the two 19th-century
dramatists.
"It is more universal in appeal, and
Gilbert's themes still apply to us today," said
Buff Wright, a member of the chorus and
Savoyard for 10 years. Indeed, the music and
plot touch audiences because of their mod
ern truths and in spite of historical distance.

"Yeomen" debuted in 1888 and ran for 14
months after its London debut, a hugely suc
cessful run for the collaborators' most oper
atic work. While appealing with touches of
intrigue, the operetta also engages the audi
ence with the dual themes of matrimony and
despair. With this more serious side amidst
elegant music and typical Gilbert and Sulli
van lightness, "Yeomen" promises a feast of
entertainment.
