### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Stanford virologist Carlton Schwerdt, who
laid the groundwork for the polio vaccine, died
March 25 of leukemia. He was 78.
Memorial services for Schwerdt will be held
May sat 11 a.m. in Memorial Church.
Schwer dt served as a professor of microbiol
ogy and immunology at Stanford for nearly 30
years.
"Scientists working all over the world have
benefited directly from his mentoring during a
long and distinguished career that extended al
most until the time of his death," said Edward
Mocarski, chair of the Department of Microbiol
ogy and Immunology at the School of Medicine.
Schwerdt remained active
until recent months, serving as
a mentor for Stanford students.
A true outdoorsman, he built his
own cabin in the Sierras last
year, according to his wife, Lor
rie Barnes-Schwerdt.
"He was an extremely sweet,
gentle person," said Leon
Rosenberg, a close friend of
Schwerdt and a retired profes
sor of microbiology and
immunology. "I never met any
body who didn't like him."
A native of Tenafly, N.J.,
Schwerdt began his life-long tie
with Stanford as an undergrad
uate. It was during his under
graduate years that he began
working on isolating the polio
virus with his biochemistry pro
fessor, Hubert Loring.
In 1947, Loring and Schw
erdt, then a research assistant at
Stanford, reported they had iso
lated the virus responsible for
infantile paralysis, which crip
pled many children of the era.
"It was his moment of fame,"
said Barnes-Schwerdt of the dis

covery that paved the way for
Jonas Salk's development of the
polio vaccine in 1955.
Schwerdt worked at Johns
Hopkins University and UC-
Berkeley before coming to Stan
ford as an associate professor in
1956. While at UC-Berkeley, he
used a method called crystalliza
tion to split the polio virus,
allowing for improvements in
the vaccine.
Schwerdt was promoted to
full professor in 1961. He and
his first wife, Patricia, a senior
research assistant at Stanford
who died in 1975, conducted
joint studies of vitamin C and its
potential in combating the com
mon cold virus.
Schwerdt published several
articles and book chapters. He
was honored with a fellowship
in the American Association for
the Advancement of Science. In
addition to his work on the polio
vaccine, he is credited with sig
nificant research on other virus
es, including measles.
Schwerdt is survived by his
wife, his son Christopher, two
daughters — Elizabeth Tilles
and Karen Janssen — six grand
children and three step-chil
dren.
