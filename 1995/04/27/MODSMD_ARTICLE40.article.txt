# Focus on: Gambardella's

### Justin Pollard 
If you love delicious Italian cuisine and are
not afraid of a little flavor, Gambardella's is
the place for you. Inconspicuously set off of
Oak Grove Avenue in Menlo Park, the restau
rant boasts a cozy atmosphere and a delight
ful menu. Drawing heavily on the culinary
tradition of northern Italy, chef and owner
Andy Gambardella has created one of the
finest dining experiences on the Peninsula.
Gambardella's ambiance is not overly for
mal; while the service is exceptional, the
friendly staff will make you feel right at
home. Be forewarned, however, that the
quality of the food is reflected in the prices.
The restaurant is a great place to take your
parents or celebrate a special occasion.
The chains of drying garlic and chile pep
pers hanging in the middle of the small din
ing room serve warning that Mr. Gambardel
la's style is not for the faint of heart; he uses
those ingredients in hearty quantities — as

well as plenty of delectable mushrooms, sun
dried tomatoes and truffle oil. The menu is
extremely varied, however, and every cus
tomer should be able to find at least a few
choices to his liking.
For antipasti start off with the funghi
miste con aglio e olio, an amazing assortment
of wild mushrooms sauteed with sun-dried
tomatoes, garlic and white truffle oil. You'll
want to mop up the truffle oil with focaccio
and 1 wouldn't be afraid to do so. Another
great starter is the melanzane ripieni — egg
plant stuffed with fontina cheese and sauteed
in garlic sauce. 1 also highly recommend the
calamari al positano, which is calamari
sauteed with hot chile peppers, white wine
and garlic. As far as salads, the insalata di ce
sare is excellent.
As you munch your appetizers, you will be
tempted to eat large quantities of the home
made focaccio bread with the sun-dried
tomato-based spumato spread. Difficult as it
may be, resist that urge — entrees come in
healthy portions and you'll want to save
room for dessert.
All of Gambardella's pasta is made fresh
in-house, and the menu offers a great selec
tion, from capellini to tagliarine. 1 enjoyed
the fusilli amalfi, a sauce of fresh tomatoes,
sun-dried tomatoes, shitake mushrooms and
pine nuts served over corkscrew pasta. While
the seasoning is generous, the blend of tastes
is scrumptious. Another great dish is the fet
tucini vegetali — fettucini with artichoke
hearts, roasted peppers, onions and garlic in
a fresh tomato-based sauce.
The daily specials are also a great place to
look for pastas. Every day there is a different
ravioli del giorno; the spinach and cheese
stuffed ravioli with chanterelle, shitake and oys

ter mushrooms sauteed in a brown butter sauce
with white truffle oil is very good, although it
comes in a smaller portion than most dishes.
The gamberoni fra diavolo is one of Mr.
Gambardella's signature dishes; the blend of
herbs and red pepper flakes in the tomato
and garlic sauce make you wonder if he didn't
strike some sort of deal with the devil him
self. Seafood is also regularly found on the
specials menu — a common dish is the pasta
tuttomare — spaghetti in a brothy tomato
sauce with garlic, mussels, clams, calamari
and shrimp. The salmone alia griglia served
with lobster ravioli had a nice light sauce; the
salmon, however, was slightly firm.
The wine list is well chosen and offers a

broad selection of both Italian and domestic
wines. Try the Albola pinot grigio or the
Macrina verdicchio classico.
For dessert, don't miss the house-special
cioccolato fango, a flourless chocolate cake
with a molten center served with fresh
whipped cream and strawberries. By the time
you take your last bite, you'll realize why you
went easy on the focaccio.
