# Melissa Ferrick brings her raw and untempered acoustic style to Stanford
## 
### Story by Mike Nichols graphic by Peter Lagerquist 
Sitting in the lobby of the Phoenix hotel,
my roommate and I sift through the
pages ot Rolling Stone and idly gaze to
VHI, which is playing one of the few granted
interviews with Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.
It is a hotel I have been to before, its squiggly
painted pool and odd outdoor sculpture a
mainstay for San Francisco touring musicians
who haven't quite made it to the penthouse
suite in the downtown art deco Hilton.
And thank (iod. How could any other at
mosphere inspire creativity and vibrancy; how
could any other place suit the character of a
musician who drove herself from 1..A. to the
(iitv, rather than coasting there on the back off
a magic bus?
Melissa Ferrick is a real person, who does
her own laundry and picks out her own
clothes in the morning. Only, on this morning
she happens to be opening for Weezer at the
Fillmore.
OK, so maybe she's a hip real person.
Melissa Ferrick is just about the greatest
person you could hope to chat with over a beer
or coffee. She's eloquent and articulate — but
honest and forward. She is willing to open up
her personal life to you, and brings anecdotes
to your lips as easily as if you had known her
has a peer — for years. I had a lengthy list of
near 30 questions ready to ask her, prepared to
blockade every conversational lag with the
brick and mortar of pointed and meaningful
journalistic queries like, "Are your songs a
means to an end or an end to a means?"
Yes, I was prepared to snap back song titles
and song quotes. The only information I
didn't have was Melissa trivia. But it turned
out not to matter. The whole evening was so
lax and wonderful that I only actually asked
four of my questions. And it was a struggle to
get those in the conversation, which flowed
along as naturally as the emotional vocals off
Melissa's music.
She is thin, like a strung out musician
worked gaunt, but dressed appropriately in
black leather pants and matching dark top. If it
weren't for that, you might not even be able to
guess she was an artist. Her aura is comfort
able, slight and clearly casual yet energetic.
Her dark red lipstick, brings out her washed
blue eyes that aren't afraid to look at you
straight. This is certainly not a stare-into-your
drink interview. In fact, it's really just a con
versation.
0000 Eeee 0000
Oh, God. I feel for her. I mean, you should

see the Fillmore. It is absolutely teeming with
pre-nubile adolescents primarily here to see
Weezer. My first concert was Stryper, way back
in 1985. I was wearing some atrocious outfit
suitable for my heavy metal days: bleached
jeans, a sleeveless T-shirt and more bandannas
than you can shake a stick at. At least I wasn't
in polyester paradise, or wearing a silk shirt
nabbed from the back of dad's closet, collar
lapels waving in the wind like winged ap
pendages ready to carry me into flight.
The Fillmore was filled with more 10- to
15- (yep, they're that young) year-olds than I
had seen in years, many still donning back
packs, filled with the homework they
promised their parents they would do before
the show, or as simple fashion statements as
trendy as Weezer's latest video.
This is the MTV generation at its worst.
This audience is absolute Hell. And they all,
every last one of them, have come to hear that
"Buddy Holly" song. I'm feeling a great sym
pathy for Melissa right now.
But not to worry. After a rough start she set
tles in to really making the frets on her guitar
smoke, yelling "Weeeeeeezer!" into the micro
phone playing along with some pencil-necked
geek (geeks are cool now) who shouts obscen
ities at her.
Her playing style is aggressive, body rock
ing with the guitar to the rhythm of her songs,
torso as much a part of the music as her voice.
While the stage is large, her presence is larger,
tilling it without having to run from one end
to the next, emoting rather than depending on
a large back-up band.
When Melissa was touring with the
Lemonheads for her 1993 debut, "Massive
Blur," she did promotions with them. "They
made me sit at the table and sign stuff, like
anyone want's me to sign ... Lemonheads
records, and 1 look over at Evan and say 'I feel
really weird signing your record,' and he's like,
'Yah, that is kind of weird. But that's OK Melis
sa, you can sign it.' So I'm like signing it really
tiny.
"But then this girl comes up to me and
goes, 'I've never seen a girl break a string be
fore, you're so cool.' And went and bought the
record and gave it to me (to sign], and that
made the whole thing worthwhile."
This is no lullaby folk artist. This woman
rocks.
Growing Up as an Artist
Melissa is the consummate musician. She
started playing guitar at 17 when she learned

to play "99 Red Balloons" using the
dots on her guitar frets. "I wrote
about 60 songs with the same four or
five chords. These poems I had writ
ten. And that's how I started."
But that's certainly not how she
continued. Much like countless teen
musicians, Melissa found a great love of
music, but she chose to pursue it as far
as Berklee. "Not U. (ial-Berkeley," sht
says with a smile, under
standing something of
Stanford weenie-suspi
cion. "The Berklee Col
lege ot Music in Boston.
But I was only there for
two years.... I think if I hadn't
quit I would have done a joint
undergraduate and master's
program over five years, but
then again, what are you
going to do with a degree
in song writing?"
Certainly not write
songs. "If you graduate,
you never make it.
Everybody who goes j
there quits who actu- J
ally does something." 4|
Music school for
Melissa was a little
like living with Aero
smith in a house of mir
rors. "There are like 3,000
guitar players who are guys
with long hair and are really
skinny that go out with re
ally weird girls and they buy
the Steve Vai 'Real' b00k...
and learn every single Steve
Vai lick that he's ever played.
There's really a lack of indi
viduality there."
But, there were a few peo
ple who stood out. Melissa
went to school with Juliana
Hatfield, among others, and
found her experimental
niche for a while. But this
proved ultimately unsatisfac
tory. Melissa was tired of insti
tutionalized practice. It was
time to get out and play.
So what better place to
make the grade than New
York? Planning to crash on a
friend's floor for a few weeks while

looking for work, Melissa — tapped for cash
and needing her guitar to play— sold her
four-track recorder and hit the road with that
money. "I moved to New York with that $ 150,"
she recalled with a grin.
But although luck turned up two day jobs
that provided rent money, and weekly gigs at
hot-spots like The Knitting Factory offered
chances to

play live, she became discouraged when a
demo didn't garnish much response. "I was re
ally bummed because 1 was sure I was going to
get signed." Then again, she was only 19.
So she moved back to Boston where her fol
lowing was bigger, but she had little inclina
tion about what was just around the corner. A
week after seemingly folding her hand of cards
on the big city, a call came in offering Melissa
the chance to do a show with Morrissey — a
show that turned into an opening slot in
his tour. She didn't even have
an album out.

And so it
was from the
rock bar circuit
to the arena. But this
is no small transi
tion.
"Before
the Morrissey thing
the largest audience was
like 200 people. But the
thing that stayed the
same was that when
I did shows at
places like the Garden
and Wembley, it was still
just me and the guitar, so
that when it was a bigger
place it wasn't like the
music got any bigger, it
was just louder."

Back in the Studio
The transition from touring
to the recording studio did
affect her musical style.
"Massive Blur," her first
album, was an effort ro
manced by the magnitude of
being a first album. Working
mostly solo, it was a new op
portunity to have a drummer
and bassist; it was also a
unique experience to be able
to craft songs in a recording
studio. The result was a
large, layered sound,
heavily emphasizing
melody, but

not at all isolat
ing the quality of the
recording to
this. While

the core of
the songs always
remained
Melissa and
her guitar, the
sound was at
times difficult to
reproduce live.
The dif-

ference with
"Willing to Wait,"
Melissa's sopho
more release, is
that she has truly
revealed herself in
this work. It is
very much a
what-you-hear is

what-you-get record, where the

songs not only touch upon the artist, but
truly expose her.
When Melissa says, "I'm not tying to be
anything other than who I am" it may sound
clichd at first, but you soon realize she is right

because she "doesn't have the full band and the
lights and the smoke ... it's just really about
songs. I'm just a girl who writes songs."
A large part of this revelation comes
through with the bare quality of "Willing to
Wait," where only four songs have drums and
"on at least eight of the 12 tracks the vocals are
live." And these overdubs are the only thing
not live on the entire album.
"It was a very scary record for me. It's total
ly naked, there's no production at all. There's
no layering of guitars, no guitar solos."
But this effort is more than just a desire to
honestly play on stage what she produces in
the recording studio, it is an effort to discover
the essence of each song. In her words, "when
a song is there... you can do a million things
with it." However you play a song is your pre
rogative, she seems to say, but here is where
you start.
Writing "Willing to Wait"
This is a record of songs as they were writ
ten over a seven month period, whereas "Mas
sive Blur" was a collection of reworked songs
written over six years. Consequently, there is a
greater thematic continuity and a story-telling
quality that relates to a more concise period of
time in her life.
And emotional / personal consistency is
important for an artist who doesn't write
"about 'real things' [as much as] about what's
inside." She writes about feelings and emo
tions that spring from somewhere inside her
lean body.
"Most of this record was written on the
road... when I was doing press and was asked
what I would do for my next album I would
say 'I promise I will not write a road song'...
and I didn't. I'm so proud of myself. There's
not one song that's like 'I'm on the road again.
Motel smells like a fishbowl.' Everybody's sec
ond album is like that. Write what you feel, not
what you're seeing."

HOW MUCH: Free

Good advice.
Universal appeal
By the time she parts from the stage, some
of the Weezer teens have stood up for her act
and are really into the music. Gratifying
knowing that this is the MTV generation
adoring an artist performing music that is
both unreleased and video-less. And for all the
folks who showed up specifically to see Melis
sa, it's nice to see that her music can bridge this
gap-
Having toured with the likes of Paul West
erburg, Mark Cohen, Dwight Yoakam and
John Hiatt, Melissa has a gift of crossing musi
cal frontiers.
"Although I have opened for very different
people, my stuff always seems to cross that
barrier, it doesn't bum anybody out."
But perhaps that's because she has discov
ered something of the essence of a song. "Look
at 'MTV Unplugged,' " she says. "If the song is
there you can put anything, or nothing, on top
of it." It is clear that she herself understands
music as content as well as form.
When asked if there was anything she
wanted to close with, Melissa says with deter
mination: "I just want everyone not to forget
that every single heavy act that they love, like
REMand all these bands, all these cool, hip al
ternative bands, all play fucking acoustic gui
tars."
Amen to that.

Jt's hard to be dispassionate about Melis-
Isa Fcrrick's music. But this comes not
■from a strong style that repels some lis
teners and attracts others. Rather, it comes
from the woman herself. With impas-
Isioned tones and aggressive guitar, her
music is a stif ring breed of new folk.
Ferrick also does not shy away from
controversy in her lyrics. On songs like the
title cut from "Willing to Wait," the grating
cry of "'Cause I am the one / Who makes
you want me/'N I am the one/Who
makes you need me /1 am the one / Who
lets you tease me / Deceive me / Now get
down on your knees and please me," fol
lowed by the disturbing chant "Abuse me
abuse me abuse me...." leaves little room
for doubt that Melissa is an artist more in
touch with substance than appearance.
For an artist who feels that all of her
songs "come from repressed memories,"
Ferrick is remarkably in touch with that
hidden side of herself.
She also believes that "First lines are
where it's at" And with starting lyrics like
"1 am not smooth /1 am not soft /1 am
not angry or mean / I'm just a little shut
oft" from the song "I Am Not,* it is easy to
see that she knows how to set a mood.
"I think that if we were thrown every
dysfunction and character defect, we
would all kill ourselves. So they come in

waves for a reason ... when you're really
being tested, that's a writing time."
And even though such an effort reveals
venerability, the honesty creates a sound
that shines with sincerity in a plastic
music industry satisfied with virtual mu
sicians, it's a pleasant surprise to meet a
real artist.
The finest tracks from "Willing to
Wait" are the soulful song "I Am Not," a
solo piece whose emotional vocal intona
tion flushes the work out better than any
back up instrumentation, and "Faking"
another feeling love song; Two other great
tracks are "Falling on Fists," full, aggres
sive and reminiscent of "Massive Blur,"
and the title track, a rhythmically mili
taristic song filled with suppressed tension
and sarcastic tones.
"Gotta Co Now" is both one of the
more challenging songs on the album and
one of its best A heavily political track, it
blends montages of childhood rules and
oaths like "look both ways / Before you
cross your heart / And hope to die / For
your sins," with a heavy critique of racial
and religious stereotypes. While this track
may never make radio play, its power is
unparalleled.
In short, "Willing to Waif is album
that reflects not only the stale of mind of
Melissa Ferrick, but the woman herself.

VHI, which is playing one of the few granted
interviews with Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.
It is a hotel I have been to before, its squiggly
painted pool and odd outdoor sculpture a
mainstay for San Francisco touring musicians
who haven't quite made it to the penthouse
suite in the downtown art deco Hilton.
And thank (iod. How could any other at
mosphere inspire creativity and vibrancy; how
could any other place suit the character of a
musician who drove herself from 1..A. to the
(iitv, rather than coasting there on the back off
a magic bus?
Melissa Ferrick is a real person, who does
her own laundry and picks out her own
clothes in the morning. Only, on this morning
she happens to be opening for Weezer at the
Fillmore.
OK, so maybe she's a hip real person.
Melissa Ferrick is just about the greatest
person you could hope to chat with over a beer
or coffee. She's eloquent and articulate — but
honest and forward. She is willing to open up
her personal life to you, and brings anecdotes
to your lips as easily as if you had known her
has a peer — for years. I had a lengthy list of
near 30 questions ready to ask her, prepared to
blockade every conversational lag with the
brick and mortar of pointed and meaningful
journalistic queries like, "Are your songs a
means to an end or an end to a means?"
Yes, I was prepared to snap back song titles
and song quotes. The only information I
didn't have was Melissa trivia. But it turned
out not to matter. The whole evening was so
lax and wonderful that I only actually asked
four of my questions. And it was a struggle to
get those in the conversation, which flowed
along as naturally as the emotional vocals off
Melissa's music.
She is thin, like a strung out musician
worked gaunt, but dressed appropriately in
black leather pants and matching dark top. If it
weren't for that, you might not even be able to
guess she was an artist. Her aura is comfort
able, slight and clearly casual yet energetic.
Her dark red lipstick, brings out her washed
blue eyes that aren't afraid to look at you
straight. This is certainly not a stare-into-your
drink interview. In fact, it's really just a con
versation.
0000 Eeee 0000
Oh, God. I feel for her. I mean, you should

see the Fillmore. It is absolutely teeming with
pre-nubile adolescents primarily here to see
Weezer. My first concert was Stryper, way back
in 1985. I was wearing some atrocious outfit
suitable for my heavy metal days: bleached
jeans, a sleeveless T-shirt and more bandannas
than you can shake a stick at. At least I wasn't
in polyester paradise, or wearing a silk shirt
nabbed from the back of dad's closet, collar
lapels waving in the wind like winged ap
pendages ready to carry me into flight.
The Fillmore was filled with more 10- to
15- (yep, they're that young) year-olds than I
had seen in years, many still donning back
packs, filled with the homework they
promised their parents they would do before
the show, or as simple fashion statements as
trendy as Weezer's latest video.
This is the MTV generation at its worst.
This audience is absolute Hell. And they all,
every last one of them, have come to hear that
"Buddy Holly" song. I'm feeling a great sym
pathy for Melissa right now.
But not to worry. After a rough start she set
tles in to really making the frets on her guitar
smoke, yelling "Weeeeeeezer!" into the micro
phone playing along with some pencil-necked
geek (geeks are cool now) who shouts obscen
ities at her.
Her playing style is aggressive, body rock
ing with the guitar to the rhythm of her songs,
torso as much a part of the music as her voice.
While the stage is large, her presence is larger,
tilling it without having to run from one end
to the next, emoting rather than depending on
a large back-up band.
When Melissa was touring with the
Lemonheads for her 1993 debut, "Massive
Blur," she did promotions with them. "They
made me sit at the table and sign stuff, like
anyone want's me to sign ... Lemonheads
records, and 1 look over at Evan and say 'I feel
really weird signing your record,' and he's like,
'Yah, that is kind of weird. But that's OK Melis
sa, you can sign it.' So I'm like signing it really
tiny.
"But then this girl comes up to me and
goes, 'I've never seen a girl break a string be
fore, you're so cool.' And went and bought the
record and gave it to me (to sign], and that
made the whole thing worthwhile."
This is no lullaby folk artist. This woman
rocks.
Growing Up as an Artist
Melissa is the consummate musician. She
started playing guitar at 17 when she learned

to play "99 Red Balloons" using the
dots on her guitar frets. "I wrote
about 60 songs with the same four or
five chords. These poems I had writ
ten. And that's how I started."
But that's certainly not how she
continued. Much like countless teen
musicians, Melissa found a great love of
music, but she chose to pursue it as far
as Berklee. "Not U. (ial-Berkeley," sht
says with a smile, under
standing something of
Stanford weenie-suspi
cion. "The Berklee Col
lege ot Music in Boston.
But I was only there for
two years.... I think if I hadn't
quit I would have done a joint
undergraduate and master's
program over five years, but
then again, what are you
going to do with a degree
in song writing?"
Certainly not write
songs. "If you graduate,
you never make it.
Everybody who goes j
there quits who actu- J
ally does something." 4|
Music school for
Melissa was a little
like living with Aero
smith in a house of mir
rors. "There are like 3,000
guitar players who are guys
with long hair and are really
skinny that go out with re
ally weird girls and they buy
the Steve Vai 'Real' b00k...
and learn every single Steve
Vai lick that he's ever played.
There's really a lack of indi
viduality there."
But, there were a few peo
ple who stood out. Melissa
went to school with Juliana
Hatfield, among others, and
found her experimental
niche for a while. But this
proved ultimately unsatisfac
tory. Melissa was tired of insti
tutionalized practice. It was
time to get out and play.
So what better place to
make the grade than New
York? Planning to crash on a
friend's floor for a few weeks while

looking for work, Melissa — tapped for cash
and needing her guitar to play— sold her
four-track recorder and hit the road with that
money. "I moved to New York with that $ 150,"
she recalled with a grin.
But although luck turned up two day jobs
that provided rent money, and weekly gigs at
hot-spots like The Knitting Factory offered
chances to

play live, she became discouraged when a
demo didn't garnish much response. "I was re
ally bummed because 1 was sure I was going to
get signed." Then again, she was only 19.
So she moved back to Boston where her fol
lowing was bigger, but she had little inclina
tion about what was just around the corner. A
week after seemingly folding her hand of cards
on the big city, a call came in offering Melissa
the chance to do a show with Morrissey — a
show that turned into an opening slot in
his tour. She didn't even have
an album out.

And so it
was from the
rock bar circuit
to the arena. But this
is no small transi
tion.
"Before
the Morrissey thing
the largest audience was
like 200 people. But the
thing that stayed the
same was that when
I did shows at
places like the Garden
and Wembley, it was still
just me and the guitar, so
that when it was a bigger
place it wasn't like the
music got any bigger, it
was just louder."

Back in the Studio
The transition from touring
to the recording studio did
affect her musical style.
"Massive Blur," her first
album, was an effort ro
manced by the magnitude of
being a first album. Working
mostly solo, it was a new op
portunity to have a drummer
and bassist; it was also a
unique experience to be able
to craft songs in a recording
studio. The result was a
large, layered sound,
heavily emphasizing
melody, but

not at all isolat
ing the quality of the
recording to
this. While

the core of
the songs always
remained
Melissa and
her guitar, the
sound was at
times difficult to
reproduce live.
The dif-

ference with
"Willing to Wait,"
Melissa's sopho
more release, is
that she has truly
revealed herself in
this work. It is
very much a
what-you-hear is

what-you-get record, where the

songs not only touch upon the artist, but
truly expose her.
When Melissa says, "I'm not tying to be
anything other than who I am" it may sound
clichd at first, but you soon realize she is right

because she "doesn't have the full band and the
lights and the smoke ... it's just really about
songs. I'm just a girl who writes songs."
A large part of this revelation comes
through with the bare quality of "Willing to
Wait," where only four songs have drums and
"on at least eight of the 12 tracks the vocals are
live." And these overdubs are the only thing
not live on the entire album.
"It was a very scary record for me. It's total
ly naked, there's no production at all. There's
no layering of guitars, no guitar solos."
But this effort is more than just a desire to
honestly play on stage what she produces in
the recording studio, it is an effort to discover
the essence of each song. In her words, "when
a song is there... you can do a million things
with it." However you play a song is your pre
rogative, she seems to say, but here is where
you start.
Writing "Willing to Wait"
This is a record of songs as they were writ
ten over a seven month period, whereas "Mas
sive Blur" was a collection of reworked songs
written over six years. Consequently, there is a
greater thematic continuity and a story-telling
quality that relates to a more concise period of
time in her life.
And emotional / personal consistency is
important for an artist who doesn't write
"about 'real things' [as much as] about what's
inside." She writes about feelings and emo
tions that spring from somewhere inside her
lean body.
"Most of this record was written on the
road... when I was doing press and was asked
what I would do for my next album I would
say 'I promise I will not write a road song'...
and I didn't. I'm so proud of myself. There's
not one song that's like 'I'm on the road again.
Motel smells like a fishbowl.' Everybody's sec
ond album is like that. Write what you feel, not
what you're seeing."

HOW MUCH: Free

Good advice.
Universal appeal
By the time she parts from the stage, some
of the Weezer teens have stood up for her act
and are really into the music. Gratifying
knowing that this is the MTV generation
adoring an artist performing music that is
both unreleased and video-less. And for all the
folks who showed up specifically to see Melis
sa, it's nice to see that her music can bridge this
gap-
Having toured with the likes of Paul West
erburg, Mark Cohen, Dwight Yoakam and
John Hiatt, Melissa has a gift of crossing musi
cal frontiers.
"Although I have opened for very different
people, my stuff always seems to cross that
barrier, it doesn't bum anybody out."
But perhaps that's because she has discov
ered something of the essence of a song. "Look
at 'MTV Unplugged,' " she says. "If the song is
there you can put anything, or nothing, on top
of it." It is clear that she herself understands
music as content as well as form.
When asked if there was anything she
wanted to close with, Melissa says with deter
mination: "I just want everyone not to forget
that every single heavy act that they love, like
REMand all these bands, all these cool, hip al
ternative bands, all play fucking acoustic gui
tars."
Amen to that.

Jt's hard to be dispassionate about Melis-
Isa Fcrrick's music. But this comes not
■from a strong style that repels some lis
teners and attracts others. Rather, it comes
from the woman herself. With impas-
Isioned tones and aggressive guitar, her
music is a stif ring breed of new folk.
Ferrick also does not shy away from
controversy in her lyrics. On songs like the
title cut from "Willing to Wait," the grating
cry of "'Cause I am the one / Who makes
you want me/'N I am the one/Who
makes you need me /1 am the one / Who
lets you tease me / Deceive me / Now get
down on your knees and please me," fol
lowed by the disturbing chant "Abuse me
abuse me abuse me...." leaves little room
for doubt that Melissa is an artist more in
touch with substance than appearance.
For an artist who feels that all of her
songs "come from repressed memories,"
Ferrick is remarkably in touch with that
hidden side of herself.
She also believes that "First lines are
where it's at" And with starting lyrics like
"1 am not smooth /1 am not soft /1 am
not angry or mean / I'm just a little shut
oft" from the song "I Am Not,* it is easy to
see that she knows how to set a mood.
"I think that if we were thrown every
dysfunction and character defect, we
would all kill ourselves. So they come in

waves for a reason ... when you're really
being tested, that's a writing time."
And even though such an effort reveals
venerability, the honesty creates a sound
that shines with sincerity in a plastic
music industry satisfied with virtual mu
sicians, it's a pleasant surprise to meet a
real artist.
The finest tracks from "Willing to
Wait" are the soulful song "I Am Not," a
solo piece whose emotional vocal intona
tion flushes the work out better than any
back up instrumentation, and "Faking"
another feeling love song; Two other great
tracks are "Falling on Fists," full, aggres
sive and reminiscent of "Massive Blur,"
and the title track, a rhythmically mili
taristic song filled with suppressed tension
and sarcastic tones.
"Gotta Co Now" is both one of the
more challenging songs on the album and
one of its best A heavily political track, it
blends montages of childhood rules and
oaths like "look both ways / Before you
cross your heart / And hope to die / For
your sins," with a heavy critique of racial
and religious stereotypes. While this track
may never make radio play, its power is
unparalleled.
In short, "Willing to Waif is album
that reflects not only the stale of mind of
Melissa Ferrick, but the woman herself.

mainstay for San Francisco touring musicians
who haven't quite made it to the penthouse
suite in the downtown art deco Hilton.
And thank (iod. How could any other at
mosphere inspire creativity and vibrancy; how
could any other place suit the character of a
musician who drove herself from 1..A. to the
(iitv, rather than coasting there on the back off
a magic bus?
Melissa Ferrick is a real person, who does
her own laundry and picks out her own
clothes in the morning. Only, on this morning
she happens to be opening for Weezer at the
Fillmore.
OK, so maybe she's a hip real person.
Melissa Ferrick is just about the greatest
person you could hope to chat with over a beer
or coffee. She's eloquent and articulate — but
honest and forward. She is willing to open up
her personal life to you, and brings anecdotes
to your lips as easily as if you had known her
has a peer — for years. I had a lengthy list of
near 30 questions ready to ask her, prepared to
blockade every conversational lag with the
brick and mortar of pointed and meaningful
journalistic queries like, "Are your songs a
means to an end or an end to a means?"
Yes, I was prepared to snap back song titles
and song quotes. The only information I
didn't have was Melissa trivia. But it turned
out not to matter. The whole evening was so
lax and wonderful that I only actually asked
four of my questions. And it was a struggle to
get those in the conversation, which flowed
along as naturally as the emotional vocals off
Melissa's music.
She is thin, like a strung out musician
worked gaunt, but dressed appropriately in
black leather pants and matching dark top. If it
weren't for that, you might not even be able to
guess she was an artist. Her aura is comfort
able, slight and clearly casual yet energetic.
Her dark red lipstick, brings out her washed
blue eyes that aren't afraid to look at you
straight. This is certainly not a stare-into-your
drink interview. In fact, it's really just a con
versation.
0000 Eeee 0000
Oh, God. I feel for her. I mean, you should

see the Fillmore. It is absolutely teeming with
pre-nubile adolescents primarily here to see
Weezer. My first concert was Stryper, way back
in 1985. I was wearing some atrocious outfit
suitable for my heavy metal days: bleached
jeans, a sleeveless T-shirt and more bandannas
than you can shake a stick at. At least I wasn't
in polyester paradise, or wearing a silk shirt
nabbed from the back of dad's closet, collar
lapels waving in the wind like winged ap
pendages ready to carry me into flight.
The Fillmore was filled with more 10- to
15- (yep, they're that young) year-olds than I
had seen in years, many still donning back
packs, filled with the homework they
promised their parents they would do before
the show, or as simple fashion statements as
trendy as Weezer's latest video.
This is the MTV generation at its worst.
This audience is absolute Hell. And they all,
every last one of them, have come to hear that
"Buddy Holly" song. I'm feeling a great sym
pathy for Melissa right now.
But not to worry. After a rough start she set
tles in to really making the frets on her guitar
smoke, yelling "Weeeeeeezer!" into the micro
phone playing along with some pencil-necked
geek (geeks are cool now) who shouts obscen
ities at her.
Her playing style is aggressive, body rock
ing with the guitar to the rhythm of her songs,
torso as much a part of the music as her voice.
While the stage is large, her presence is larger,
tilling it without having to run from one end
to the next, emoting rather than depending on
a large back-up band.
When Melissa was touring with the
Lemonheads for her 1993 debut, "Massive
Blur," she did promotions with them. "They
made me sit at the table and sign stuff, like
anyone want's me to sign ... Lemonheads
records, and 1 look over at Evan and say 'I feel
really weird signing your record,' and he's like,
'Yah, that is kind of weird. But that's OK Melis
sa, you can sign it.' So I'm like signing it really
tiny.
"But then this girl comes up to me and
goes, 'I've never seen a girl break a string be
fore, you're so cool.' And went and bought the
record and gave it to me (to sign], and that
made the whole thing worthwhile."
This is no lullaby folk artist. This woman
rocks.
Growing Up as an Artist
Melissa is the consummate musician. She
started playing guitar at 17 when she learned

to play "99 Red Balloons" using the
dots on her guitar frets. "I wrote
about 60 songs with the same four or
five chords. These poems I had writ
ten. And that's how I started."
But that's certainly not how she
continued. Much like countless teen
musicians, Melissa found a great love of
music, but she chose to pursue it as far
as Berklee. "Not U. (ial-Berkeley," sht
says with a smile, under
standing something of
Stanford weenie-suspi
cion. "The Berklee Col
lege ot Music in Boston.
But I was only there for
two years.... I think if I hadn't
quit I would have done a joint
undergraduate and master's
program over five years, but
then again, what are you
going to do with a degree
in song writing?"
Certainly not write
songs. "If you graduate,
you never make it.
Everybody who goes j
there quits who actu- J
ally does something." 4|
Music school for
Melissa was a little
like living with Aero
smith in a house of mir
rors. "There are like 3,000
guitar players who are guys
with long hair and are really
skinny that go out with re
ally weird girls and they buy
the Steve Vai 'Real' b00k...
and learn every single Steve
Vai lick that he's ever played.
There's really a lack of indi
viduality there."
But, there were a few peo
ple who stood out. Melissa
went to school with Juliana
Hatfield, among others, and
found her experimental
niche for a while. But this
proved ultimately unsatisfac
tory. Melissa was tired of insti
tutionalized practice. It was
time to get out and play.
So what better place to
make the grade than New
York? Planning to crash on a
friend's floor for a few weeks while

looking for work, Melissa — tapped for cash
and needing her guitar to play— sold her
four-track recorder and hit the road with that
money. "I moved to New York with that $ 150,"
she recalled with a grin.
But although luck turned up two day jobs
that provided rent money, and weekly gigs at
hot-spots like The Knitting Factory offered
chances to

play live, she became discouraged when a
demo didn't garnish much response. "I was re
ally bummed because 1 was sure I was going to
get signed." Then again, she was only 19.
So she moved back to Boston where her fol
lowing was bigger, but she had little inclina
tion about what was just around the corner. A
week after seemingly folding her hand of cards
on the big city, a call came in offering Melissa
the chance to do a show with Morrissey — a
show that turned into an opening slot in
his tour. She didn't even have
an album out.

And so it
was from the
rock bar circuit
to the arena. But this
is no small transi
tion.
"Before
the Morrissey thing
the largest audience was
like 200 people. But the
thing that stayed the
same was that when
I did shows at
places like the Garden
and Wembley, it was still
just me and the guitar, so
that when it was a bigger
place it wasn't like the
music got any bigger, it
was just louder."

Back in the Studio
The transition from touring
to the recording studio did
affect her musical style.
"Massive Blur," her first
album, was an effort ro
manced by the magnitude of
being a first album. Working
mostly solo, it was a new op
portunity to have a drummer
and bassist; it was also a
unique experience to be able
to craft songs in a recording
studio. The result was a
large, layered sound,
heavily emphasizing
melody, but

not at all isolat
ing the quality of the
recording to
this. While

the core of
the songs always
remained
Melissa and
her guitar, the
sound was at
times difficult to
reproduce live.
The dif-

ference with
"Willing to Wait,"
Melissa's sopho
more release, is
that she has truly
revealed herself in
this work. It is
very much a
what-you-hear is

what-you-get record, where the

songs not only touch upon the artist, but
truly expose her.
When Melissa says, "I'm not tying to be
anything other than who I am" it may sound
clichd at first, but you soon realize she is right

because she "doesn't have the full band and the
lights and the smoke ... it's just really about
songs. I'm just a girl who writes songs."
A large part of this revelation comes
through with the bare quality of "Willing to
Wait," where only four songs have drums and
"on at least eight of the 12 tracks the vocals are
live." And these overdubs are the only thing
not live on the entire album.
"It was a very scary record for me. It's total
ly naked, there's no production at all. There's
no layering of guitars, no guitar solos."
But this effort is more than just a desire to
honestly play on stage what she produces in
the recording studio, it is an effort to discover
the essence of each song. In her words, "when
a song is there... you can do a million things
with it." However you play a song is your pre
rogative, she seems to say, but here is where
you start.
Writing "Willing to Wait"
This is a record of songs as they were writ
ten over a seven month period, whereas "Mas
sive Blur" was a collection of reworked songs
written over six years. Consequently, there is a
greater thematic continuity and a story-telling
quality that relates to a more concise period of
time in her life.
And emotional / personal consistency is
important for an artist who doesn't write
"about 'real things' [as much as] about what's
inside." She writes about feelings and emo
tions that spring from somewhere inside her
lean body.
"Most of this record was written on the
road... when I was doing press and was asked
what I would do for my next album I would
say 'I promise I will not write a road song'...
and I didn't. I'm so proud of myself. There's
not one song that's like 'I'm on the road again.
Motel smells like a fishbowl.' Everybody's sec
ond album is like that. Write what you feel, not
what you're seeing."

HOW MUCH: Free

Good advice.
Universal appeal
By the time she parts from the stage, some
of the Weezer teens have stood up for her act
and are really into the music. Gratifying
knowing that this is the MTV generation
adoring an artist performing music that is
both unreleased and video-less. And for all the
folks who showed up specifically to see Melis
sa, it's nice to see that her music can bridge this
gap-
Having toured with the likes of Paul West
erburg, Mark Cohen, Dwight Yoakam and
John Hiatt, Melissa has a gift of crossing musi
cal frontiers.
"Although I have opened for very different
people, my stuff always seems to cross that
barrier, it doesn't bum anybody out."
But perhaps that's because she has discov
ered something of the essence of a song. "Look
at 'MTV Unplugged,' " she says. "If the song is
there you can put anything, or nothing, on top
of it." It is clear that she herself understands
music as content as well as form.
When asked if there was anything she
wanted to close with, Melissa says with deter
mination: "I just want everyone not to forget
that every single heavy act that they love, like
REMand all these bands, all these cool, hip al
ternative bands, all play fucking acoustic gui
tars."
Amen to that.

Jt's hard to be dispassionate about Melis-
Isa Fcrrick's music. But this comes not
■from a strong style that repels some lis
teners and attracts others. Rather, it comes
from the woman herself. With impas-
Isioned tones and aggressive guitar, her
music is a stif ring breed of new folk.
Ferrick also does not shy away from
controversy in her lyrics. On songs like the
title cut from "Willing to Wait," the grating
cry of "'Cause I am the one / Who makes
you want me/'N I am the one/Who
makes you need me /1 am the one / Who
lets you tease me / Deceive me / Now get
down on your knees and please me," fol
lowed by the disturbing chant "Abuse me
abuse me abuse me...." leaves little room
for doubt that Melissa is an artist more in
touch with substance than appearance.
For an artist who feels that all of her
songs "come from repressed memories,"
Ferrick is remarkably in touch with that
hidden side of herself.
She also believes that "First lines are
where it's at" And with starting lyrics like
"1 am not smooth /1 am not soft /1 am
not angry or mean / I'm just a little shut
oft" from the song "I Am Not,* it is easy to
see that she knows how to set a mood.
"I think that if we were thrown every
dysfunction and character defect, we
would all kill ourselves. So they come in

waves for a reason ... when you're really
being tested, that's a writing time."
And even though such an effort reveals
venerability, the honesty creates a sound
that shines with sincerity in a plastic
music industry satisfied with virtual mu
sicians, it's a pleasant surprise to meet a
real artist.
The finest tracks from "Willing to
Wait" are the soulful song "I Am Not," a
solo piece whose emotional vocal intona
tion flushes the work out better than any
back up instrumentation, and "Faking"
another feeling love song; Two other great
tracks are "Falling on Fists," full, aggres
sive and reminiscent of "Massive Blur,"
and the title track, a rhythmically mili
taristic song filled with suppressed tension
and sarcastic tones.
"Gotta Co Now" is both one of the
more challenging songs on the album and
one of its best A heavily political track, it
blends montages of childhood rules and
oaths like "look both ways / Before you
cross your heart / And hope to die / For
your sins," with a heavy critique of racial
and religious stereotypes. While this track
may never make radio play, its power is
unparalleled.
In short, "Willing to Waif is album
that reflects not only the stale of mind of
Melissa Ferrick, but the woman herself.
