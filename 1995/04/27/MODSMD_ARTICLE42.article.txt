## Mike Noren Home's 'IX' is maniacally thoughtful 
### 
Too often, it seems that bands use the
term "experimental" to justify the over-use
of noise, lack of melody or just playing re
ally really slowly. In the midst of countless
alt-rock feedback solos, it's refreshing to
hear a band like Home.
On its debut album "IX," Home intri
cately weaves sounds, moods and styles
into a twisting-and-turning masterpiece.
From start to finish, "IX" lays down layers
of keyboards, vocals and guitars that inter
act to form explosive melodies that sound
like accidents but aren't.
In the group's fierce exploration of
hooks and patterns, tracks like "Freedohm
Rd." and "Concepcion" recall a mellower
and less guitar-based Rodan. The songs
create a sonic depth and focus that's com
plemented by the loose and unstable vocals
of Eric Morrison and Andrew Deutsch.
Even though Deutsch is being sarcastic
when he wails "Let's compose a sing
along" in "My Friend Maurice," Home

nevertheless appeals on a very direct level.
On the surface, certain lines and grooves
stick in your head the same way that an old
Cars song might. But while there is a defi
nite pop element to Home's work, the am
bition and innovation at the core of these
songs leave Home well outside of the alter
native rock sphere.
Along with bands like the Thinking
Fellers and Red Krayola, Home backs up
great pop songs with a rich array of musi
cal tricks, giving the entire album a deeply
exciting flow.
"Reprint" piles on intensity through
hectic style and tempo changes, and "Lost
It" features happily screamed vocals over a
thick, bouncing wall of guitar noise and
odd percussion. Yet neither song is at all
messy. Even the full-speed punk of "In My
House" maintains an exactness and clarity
amid the swirls of blind energy.
With repeated listens, it becomes clear
that "IX" is a carefully thought-out work of
art; the arrangements maintain purpose,
direction and an almost classical beauty,
even as they threaten to hurtle off the
tracks.
