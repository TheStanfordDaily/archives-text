# Susan Werner
## Last of the Good Straight Girls 
### 
The cover for Susan Werner's album says
much about her music. It's an uncomplicat
ed cover for an uncomplicated album. "Last
of the Good Straight Girls" is straight-for
ward with no surprises — and some nice
songs along the way.
Yes, nice songs, but not nice as in good.
Just nice in a sarcastic way, considering how
Werner doesn't take any risks by simply re
signing herself to folksy elevator music. She's
Carole King without the feeling, James Tay
lor without the catchy melodies. It's just her
and the guitar sometimes, and too often
that's not enough.
As she goes through her songs about peo
ple losing and loving and losing again, Wern
er comes across as a country-singer with am
bitions of being Sheryl Crow. Unfortunately,
there's not much exciting about her voice or
music. The lyrics are banal, as if she had
made them up as she went along. To make
things worse, the instrumental support is
tiresome and repetitive, as notes are repeated
over again.
The biggest problem, however, is Werner's
voice.
Her voice is not intimate or heartfelt
enough to do justice to the issues she deals
with. It's hard to sympathize with her tales of
love lost and longing regained when her
voice is so distant and cold.

Songs like "Sonic Other Town" and
"Much at All" are only nice to listen to when
you're doing your Christmas shopping at
Macy's or while choosing between deli
brands at the grocery store. The blandness of
her music makes so little mark on the listen
er's brain that the brain itself becomes free to
concentrate on more pressing matters, like
which is the better brand, Oscar Meyer or
Deli Slice?
The back of the album's cover provides a
few more clues as to the album's contents. It's
a full close-up of Werner, showing her face in
all its glory: clean and smooth, but also bor
ing and uninteresting. Just kke the music it
self.
