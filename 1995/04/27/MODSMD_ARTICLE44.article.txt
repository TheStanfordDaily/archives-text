# The 						Orb
## Orbus Terrarum 
### 
Have you ever done it to an ambient
techno record? If the answer is no, then The
Orb's fresh release, "OrbusTerrarum," may
be a perfect beginning. You'll be astounded
at how easy it is to slip this one in, and after
that, there are only a few buttons to push. I
suggest "Play" for starters. Then, relax and
treat your virgin ears to sheer titillation.
Trust me, it's safe.
As preparation for your first listening
euphoria, The Orb offers a pair of truly
transcendental warm-up albums: "The
Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld"
and "u.f.orb." These projects were devel
oped years ago with the needs of the inex

perienced in mind — you may be surprised
to learn that The Orb practically invented
the bat and baseball glove of the ambient
world with waves of oceanic listening plea
sures and a myriad of surprisingly tender
and well connected sound effects. At first
an escape from the harsher "umph-umph"
of more traditional brands of techno, The
Orb's relaxing invention soon gained mass
appeal.
Now, these ambient travel agents plan to
guide your passions into pleasure worlds of
the past. Welcome to Jurassic Park techno
style, as The Orb visits the prehistoric
"Orbus Terrarum," a beast whose arms
spew out surges of auditory saturation and
whose feet walk to the beat of a West Indi
an rhythm.
Masters of the placid maelstrom, pio
neers of the subdued frenzy, The Orb has
never failed to convert seemingly incom
prehensible sophistication into digestible
relaxation. These missionaries of the para
doxical musical edge — like a professor of
passion and understanding — convert a
dense topic matter into simple academic
fodder. And after you get into it, you'll
wonder why you ever worried about doing
it in the first place.
It is understandable that "Orbus Ter
rarum" may seem scary at first: With over
70 minutes of album to deal with, it is hard
to know where to start. Perhaps the short
est of tracks, "Oxbow Lakes," is the perfect
place to get your feet wet and learn about
The Orb's pacific palette.
Opening with a rich piano chord pro
gression that will bring rushes of nostalgia
to even the most callous of listeners, this
ambient investigation wanders into a tran
quil rush of techno-inspired sound effects.
The most striking aspect of this and other
tracks is the energetic rhythm that hides its
head underneath a veil of seemingly inno
cent stress-reducers.
The dense piano motif pops its head in
at perfect interludes, almost to remind the
listener just where this journey came from.
Other tracks to investigate include "White
River Junction" and "Slug Dub."
, In a time of countless ambient suitors, it
is important to choose a partner that will
always be there to comfort you. The Orb,

founders of the experience, offer a pleasure
that few others can: originality .. . and it
gets better every time.
