# Wilco
## A.M. 
### 
In these days of short attention spans
and fleeting success, the compelling ten
dency of alternative-music hands is to, well,
disband. Take Uncle Tupelo.
The Bellevue, 111. group recorded four
well-received albums in the early '90s. In
1993, the group released its most fully real
ized work, "Anodyne," placing it on the
threshold of mainstream acclaim. Then one
of the group's co-founders quit, and Uncle
Tupelo disappeared.
Sort of. The group's chief songwriter, Jeff
Tweedy, cobbled together four of the musi
cians who played on "Anodyne" to form a
new group named Wilco. Though the title
of the band's first release, "A.M.," giddily
suggests the dawn of a new day, the ele
ments that made Uncle Tupelo an under
ground favorite remain — tuneful
melodies, emotional honesty and a sound
that crosses Bob Mould with John Fogerty.
The result is a lilting, listenable collection
of confessional pop.
The album neatly divides into three styl
istic sections. Despite Tweedy's acknowl
edged fascination with early punk, his writ
ing is rooted in solid, Midwestern guitar
rock. "A.M." 's first several tracks lay down
a rollicking jangle behind Tweedy's raspy
tenor. On "Box Full of Letters," Tweedy de
fends his sporadic correspondence to a for
mer companion: "I can't find the time," he
sings convincingly, "to write my mind the
way I want it to read."
You might say that Wilco suffers from
similar uncertainties. It could explain why
midway through the album, the band shifts
from the Replacementsesque drive of
"Shouldn't Be Ashamed" to the bluegrassy
"That's Not the Issue" and the unabashed
country of "It's Just That Simple," com
plete with the creamy wail of a steel-pedal
guitar.
They find surer footing among the lan
guid songs that are the true highlights of the
album. On "Pick Up The Change," a
twangy, honeysuckle cut, Tweedy pleads
with his departed lover for a second chance.
The key to Wilco's irresistible, offbeat
charm are Tweedy's affecting vocals — gen
tle, intimate and undeniably sincere. On
"Passenger Side," which analogizes rela
tionships to road trips, he croons "I'm
gonna spill my beer / If you don't learn how
to steer," making even self-consciously stu
pid words sound heartfelt.
The album's last track, "Too Far Apart,"
offers a plodding, understated melodic line
enhanced by layers of sounds, including a
couple of electric guitars and organ. It's a
minor masterpiece and a fitting close to an
album that's smart, endearing and uni
formly excellent. Wilco delivers on "A.M.";
here's hoping that this time, they stick
around past lunch.
