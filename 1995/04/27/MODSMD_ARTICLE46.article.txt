## Mmalo-We 
### 
"World music" has always been a precari
ous term because more oftan than not, the
music is simply the adaptation of western
popular music to indigenous musical styles.
At best (as with Paul Simon's "Graceland" or
even The Talking Heads' "Remain in Light"),
the results can be simply astounding. At
worst, the mix can seem forced or false, as if
one style is compromising itself for the other.
Bayete's new album, "Mmalo-We" is a mix
of the two extremes. This South African
group, basically a vocal and keyboard band
formed around the lead singer and co-writer
Jabu Khanyile, can be both entrancing and
annoying, often within the same song.
A long-time veteran of the South African
musical scene, the 36-year-old Khanyile has
finally been freed from the artistic shackles of
apartheid and indeed, he states that the new
album's aim is "to show that Africa is now all
one."
His group's new album, however, is decid
edly fragmented. Besides frequently switch
ing between English and Zulu, the musical
styles seem haphazardly combined. While
the vocals suggest a mixture of reggae, rap
and soul, the supporting music is simple,
bland keyboard exercises. Although the band
approaches the polyrhythmics characteristic
of much African music, the presentation can
weaken the music's intentions.
Basically, the presence of the keyboard is
too strong. The music never comes close to
sounding "real." While this lack of true in
strumentation may be an asset for techno
hands, it is a definite drawback in the genre of
world music. Instead of sounding organic,
the band sounds robotic, which should be
avoided by groups trying to emphasize their
natural roots.
Thus, while Bayete's music does not fufill
its potential, it does deliver some definite
pleasures. The vocals are beautiful, and the
simple, almost child-like melodies are a de
light.
The album carries with it a definite sense
of excitement and freshness and that can de
finetly be enlightening today.
