# Soul Coughing
## Ruby Vroom 
### 
The bands name hints at a juxtaposition
of the celestial with the trivial, and Soul
Coughing'sdebut album does indeed fit such
a characterization. On "Ruby Vroom," the
New York-based group mixes up rap, jazz,
funk and rock, with results ranging from star
formation to lukewarm fusion.
Front man Michael Doughty's haphazard
and often hyper-referential lyrics, rendered
in so-what-I'm-white rap or so-what-I
can't-sing vocals, dominate the record. They

are supported by Sebastian Steinberg's
thumping upright base, Yuval Cabay on
drums, M'ark I)e Gli Antoni's bizarre sam
ples and Doughty himself on guitar.
Despite some of the repetition and even
boredom brought about by Doughty's
Dadaist tendencies, his occasional moments
of divine inspiration are this album's salva
tion. The obra maestra here is undoubtedly
"Screenwriter's Blues," a funky spoken word
piece a la MC 900 ft. Jesus.
Doughty's poetry and humor reach a
peak in this twisted ode to Los Angeles, fea
turing a smug "radio man," teenagers who
are "aesthetically pleasing in other words
fly," and the protagonist, driving to Reseda at
5 a.m. for a rendezvous with a model from
Ohio: "Because we are all in some way or an
other going to Reseda, someday, to die." A
frenetic hip-hop hook constitutes the ideal
background.
Unfortunately, some of the smart-ass raps
and sing-songs here are not as interesting, and
others border on just plain annoying. On the
nasal opening track, "Is Chicago, Is Not
Chicago," Doughty waxes existential about a
whole city, and just ends up bugging the shit
out of everyone. And other than a Fugazi ref
erence that makes you wonder what else you
missed, the anti-pop culture tirade "Casiotone
Nation" is musically and lyrically tedious.
A few slower tracks, more folk and guitar
oriented, indicate another direction Soul
Coughing could explore. In the moving
"True Dreams of Wichita," Steinberg's bass
recalls Lou Reed, and Doughty asks, "Will
you grip her love like a driver's license?" The
target of the vaguely Mercury Rev-esque
"Sugar Free Jazz" is obvious: "Paleolithic eon
/ Put the fake goatee on." The beautiful clos
ing track features a guitar strumming out
"Duke of Earl," a tripped-out girl (perhaps
"Janine" herself) singing "The Lemon Tree"
in the background, and the lines: "If you were
the Baltic Sea and I were a cup / Janine I'd
drink you up."
Such moments almost make listening to
all the filler tracks (or just pushing the skip
button) worth it, but it's tempting to imagine
an album by Soul Coughing made up of
nothing but Screenwriters and Janines.
