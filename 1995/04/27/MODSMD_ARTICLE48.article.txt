# Laika
## Silver Apples of the Moon 
### 
Laika was the first dog to travel the cos
mos, which makes it a particularly appropri
ate namesake for a band that's venturing into
unexplored soundscapes. The space race is
on and Laika is sending its eclectric, 21st
Century pop signals hack to earth from the
finish line.
Along with cohorts Stereolab, this quartet
combines technology and a variety of musi
cal genres to create music that's engrossing
and accessible despite being out there. You
could call the band's debut "Silver Apples of
the Moon" techno music for people who
don't like techno, but that would just be
putting limits on something that barges
through them: Much more than space-age
sound effects, Laika's mix consists of tasty
jazz bits, nifty samples and moog arrange
ments, frantic rhythms and elegant vocals.
Together, the ingredients form some
beautiful sounds, if nothing more than that.
"Sugar Daddy" opens the album with its
chaotic blur of chirps and buzz, thinning into
a stately bass groove and tinny percussion
that calm everything unsettled around it. The
understated chanting of Moonshake castoff
Margaret Fiedler and Guy Fixsen maintain
