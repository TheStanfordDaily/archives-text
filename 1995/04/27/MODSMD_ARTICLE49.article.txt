often seemed obscured in Moonshake's hec
tic, guitar-driven hodge-podge, it flourishes
in a supporting role in Laika's well-orches
trated whole.
"If You Miss" begins memorably, throb
bing and crackling in anticipation of an on
coming thunderstorm. When it rains, it
comes down in a serenely syncopated drizzle,
a twinkling tinkle that sounds like the stars
Fiedler grabs for in the lyrics. "44 Robbers"
lifts the foreboding peace with its off-kilter
dynamics and John Frenett's bounding bass.
Fiedler's vocals move briskly amid the
squeaks and skronks, telling her this-place
is-a-mess story vividly and rapidly as if it
were a grown-up nursery rhyme. With a
fuzzed-out horn snippet and some stardust
ed synthesizer effects, the song is pop from
the future, no mere figment of imagination
because Laika listened to its.
