# Profs, TAs against bigger section size
## H&S dean says increase is financial need 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Plans to increase section sizes as a
means of cutting the School of Humanities
and Sciences budget will worsen the quali
ty of education provided, professors and
teaching assistants say.
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven announced Tues
day that section sizes for humanities and
sciences classes will be increased next year
by 10 percent to help the school make the
2 percent budget cut it faces.
"I think that's a serious mistake," said
Economics Prof. John Taylor. "Even
though it seems like a small change, it will
have an impact on the interactions in the
class," such as dialogue on the subject and
the opportunity to ask questions, he said.
Small sections are essential for the
open atmosphere of discussion in many
classes, said Jeremy Buchman, a third
year political science graduate student and

TA.
"Especially if you take large lecture
classes, sections are where you have dis
cussion, where you have more intimate
session," Buchman said. "When I've had
smaller sections, the discussion tended to
go much better."
Most of his sections have had 12 or 15
students, Buchman said. While a section
can be too small and "you do need some
critical mass to be able to get discussion
going ... the trouble is when it gets too
big," he said.
"The reason we're having sections is be
cause the classes are [up to] a couple hun
dred students," said Erin Sawyer, a sec
ond-year religious studies graduate stu
dent and TA. "The point of sections is to
give people a chance to discuss the materi
al in small groups."
When sections are bigger than even 20
or 25 students, Sawyer said, the section
starts to become too much like the
lecture and the purpose of divid
ing into smaller groups is defeat
ed.
Large sections are "not partic
ularly conducive to discussion,"
she said.
In moderate-size sections, "I
like to let my students run the dis
cussion," Buchman said. "We
have a lot of leeway for discussion.
I don't like to play traffic cop.
"It's tough when you have 20
people," he said, "because you
then have to play traffic cop more
just to be able to maintain some
order."
In addition to disrupting edu
cation in sections, the changes
will put more pressure on already
overburdened TAs, Sawyer said.
More students mean that, as a
graduate student, "you'd definite
ly be spending more time on your
TA classes and less time on your
work," she said. "We're already
having problems ... because peo
ple don't feel like they have time."
The TA work "makes it really
hard to specialize in your field,"
she said. TA time commitments
"have really kind of messed up a
lot of people's graduate progress,"
Sawyer said. Adding to sections
would only make conditions
worse, she added.
Along with the 10 percent

increase in section sizes comes a
decrease in the number of posi
tions available for graduate stu
dents.
TA positions will still be guar
anteed to graduate students for
their first four years of study,
Shoven said on Tuesday, but stu
dents who take longer to finish
their degrees may need to find
funding elsewhere.
The stipend that comes with
work as a TA is "quite important
if you don't have outside fund
ing," Buchman said. "After my
fourth year, for example, unless
I've got outside funding that
allows me to work on my disserta
tion, I'll need either [TA posi
tions! or a research fellowship to
pay for food and rent and other
luxuries like that."
"Having fewer [TA positions]
available for older graduate stu
dents would cause quite substan
tial harm," Buchman said. "Plus,
I think there's something to be
gained from having older stu
dents TA."
But the students face the
biggest loss, Taylor said.
Sections in the Economics 1
class he teaches have 25 students
at most right now, he said, a size
he feels is already too large.
"I don't know what the alterna
tives are," Taylor added. "There's
a cost in terms of education in
increasing these section sizes.
That's not a place to be aiming [for
budget cuts]. It's a very important
part of the curriculum."
