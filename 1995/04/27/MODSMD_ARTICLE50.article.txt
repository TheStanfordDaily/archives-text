## Anxious, Restless 
### 
From the first instant of "Anxious, Rest
less," skiploader's debut EP on Geffen
Records, the listener is bombarded musically
and vocally. The Portland-based band's first
production is a quick and gritty attack. For
15 minutes, Kevin Higgin's guitar grinds out
coarse, edgy chord progressions slapped over
Craig Koozer's bass line and Jeff Turner's
powerful, staccato rhythm section.
The music is tense and jittery with many
stops and starts. Vocalist and guitarist Tom
Ackerman's lyrics and melodies fit well with
this music. His sentences are choppy and jum
bled, his melodies are terse and tight. Acker
man's voice is what Afghan Whig Greg Dulli's
would sound like if Dulli smoked even more
cigarettes and drank six times more coffee.
There is no doubt that this F.P hits you
square between the eyes and causes you to
take notice. However, this direct confronta
tion is hard to handle at times. Ackerman's
lyrics are almost entirely autobiographical.
In the liner notes he even explains exactly
what each song is about, totally destroying
their enigmatic and mysterious quality, ren
dering them mundane and somewhat banal.
For example, it's unnecessary for Ackerman
to reveal that "n2o" is about his own sexual ex
perimentation at age 14. "First I had him in my
mouth / Then 1 had him in my body /1 was
drunk but I think I liked it /1 guess this proves a
lot of nothing / improves nothing."
My god, we just met. The lyrics themselves
are thoughtful and honest, but the unnecessary
explanation demystifies what could have been
intriguing. This "red badge of courage" tactic is
a turnoff to the solid underlying rock and roll.
Much to skiploader's credit, the "Anxious,
Restless" EP is a promising start. The music is
energetic and fresh. The band is tight and at
times Ackerman's lyrics are well thought out
and expressive. Most importantly, this band
has maintained originality and innovation in
a time of so many copycats and recipe bands.
