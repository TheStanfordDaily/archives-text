## Yuen Ping Low 'Farinelli' sings past mediocre acting 
### 
When a film is touted by its marketing per
sonnel as the shocking story of the cast rat o, the
viewer it thus attracts must approach it with
heightened anticipation for a 110-minute
spectacle of lather-rich Baroque intrigue.
Imagine, here is a Belgian art house (lick that
can be sold as an 18th-Century soap-fest
chock full of hair-raising exposes to the quin
tessential chat-show junkie of the '90s!
Indeed, "Farinelli" would lend itself even
more immediately to contemporary identifi
cation if its men were not uniformly dressed
in campy tights and its arresting accompany
ing soundtrack were not quite so resolutely
classical. The subject matter itself makes pure
fodder for tabloid consumption.
Born in 1705 Naples, the prepubescent
Carlo Broschi was savaged without his con
sent so that his already-conspicuous vocal tal
ents could be preserved beyond puberty and
physiology. The prodigious castrato could
then combine the virile male voice with a
three-and-a-half octave feminine virtuosity
As it turns out, Farinelli (Stefano Dionisi),
the nickname that came to endear itself in the
hearts and loins of many a female fan, soon
finds himself ensconced in the realm of musi
cal greats. A bitter love-hate rivalry with the
legendary Handel (Jeroen Krabbe) ensues;
while the angst-ridden star wages an inner
struggle between fraternal loyalty to his
mediocre composer brother Riccardo (Enri
co 1.0 Verso), and Farinelli's personal ardor
for artistic transcendence.

In terms of setting and artifice, the Oscar
nominated biopic threatens to leave opera afi
cionados in the audience — opera queens in
particular — swooning in orgasmic unison.
Our octave-scaling acrobat strikes a pose in
facial masks of foundation, exuberantly flow
ing capes and gravity-defying headdresses
that would put any Las Vegas chorus girl to
utter shame.
It is to director Gerard Corbiaus credit
that the material's potential for descending
into absurdity and absolute pathos is held in
check. Several set-pieces are drawn out with
equal parts of subtle style and surrealistic
splendor — note the thunderous impact of
Farinelli's startling pause in the course of a
performance, provoked by the nonchalant
book-reading preoccupation of a beautiful
woman amid the sell-out audience.
Farinelli and Riccardo's bizarre relation
ship — the former seduces and the latter
"plants the seed" — results in a menage a trois
of sorts that comes to an astonishing fruition
at the film's resolution. Unfortunately, much
of the script's underscoring of Farinelli's tor
mented psyche and Riccardo's self-serving de
pendence is let down by pedestrian acting.
Yet, all those contemplating "Farinelli" can
well be reassured that like it or not, there is
never a dull, unsung moment.
