# The 						Basketball Diaries' records the downward spiral of poet Jim Carroll
## 
### 
"The Basketball Diaries," directed by Scott
Kalvert, careens and crashes like one long bad
trip as it follows the wild teenage life of Jim (Car
roll, a contemporary poet and artist.
Carroll, played with extreme clarity by
Leonardo DiCaprio, illustrates early in the
movie the starkness of his world, which re
volves around basketball and cocaine: "You
gotta have presence on the court. You either
play like a cheetah or a chimp.... Me, 1 play like
a cheetah."
Off the court, Carroll continues to live the
life of a cheetah. Wildly and without remorse,
he prowls the slums of New York with his child
hood friends in search of trouble and drugs.

Night alter night, he and his friends roam the
streets, randomly mixing liquor and narcotics,
until they eventually reach the lonely black
pavement of the basketball courts. There they
play until all of their anger and sorrow desert
them — and morning arrives.
During the day, Carroll cuts out of his
Catholic school in order to play pranks and
jump 30-foot cliffs, challenging death as he
back-flips off the ledge into the sludge of the

Manhattan River below.
Still, (Carroll manages to play basketball with
relative ease, fooling his overworked mother
and his ultimately sleazy coach.
Carroll's life soon descends, though, into a
dizzying drug addiction. He begins to rob
others, mugging them in the streets for co
caine money. At one point, he and his best
friend Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) pop a vari
ety of pills before an important basketball
game. The result is calamitous as they careen
into each other, steal the ball from fellow
team members and miss catching the ball by
several feet. Kalvert directs this descent per
fectly with hallucinatory, reeling imagery,

ending in bleakly depicted downers.
Their consequent expulsion leaves them
free to roam the streets. High on drugs, they
become extremely violent, breaking into
shops, stealing cars and permanently resid
ing in seedy crack houses.
Carroll's eventual salvation comes ironi
cally when his mother telephones the police.
"The Basketball Diaries" isn't flowery or
gelled over with a shiny Hollywood ending.
Instead, the movie is gruesomely stark and
realistic, and the viewer is left agreeing with
Carroll when he remarks: "You know this game
never ends."
