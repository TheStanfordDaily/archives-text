# There's lots to like in Sandra Bullock's romantic 'While You Were Sleeping'
## 
### 
"While You Were Sleeping," directed by
John Turteltaub, isn't a thriller or an intriguing
mystery, or even a movie about a bomb plant
ed on an LA. bus. It's a simple romance story
revolving around an average girl named Lucy
Moderatz (Sandra Bullock).
Lucy lives a lonely life as a token booth at
tendant for the Chicago Transit Authority. She
reflects, "I have a cat, I have an apartment —
sole possession of the remote control: That's
very important." At Christmas she decorates
the tree alone, and makes conversation with
the cat. During the remainder of the season

she politely declines the advances of Joe lr.
(Michael Rispoli), the landlord's son, as he
struts around wearing his gold chain and Joey
Buttafuoco pants.
Her life changes one day when she notices
the handsome man, Peter (Peter Gal
lagher), who passes by her booth. She remarks,
"We haven't actually talked yet, but we will one

day. I know it I know it." Lucy's mediocre
existence and everyday fears are exactly what
make her an appealing and believable character.
Before Lucy can actually get up the nerve to
talk to her mystery man, he tumbles into the
path of an approaching train, is knocked un
conscious and falls into a coma. Things get even
more troublesome when Lucy is mistaken for
his fiancee by the hospital staff and Peter's well
meaning family.
The Callaghan's, having lost contact with their
yuppie son, invite Lucy to their house for the hol
idays in the hopes of renewing the family bonds.

Only Peter's younger brother, Jack (Bill
Pullman), is suspicious. His doubts lead him
to speak more with Lucy, who is simultane
ously becoming attracted to lack.
This complex situation finally reaches its
peak when Peter emerges from his coma, and,
strangely enough, doesn't recognize Lucy.
Although "While You Were Sleeping" seems
a bit unbelievable, Lucy is a sympathetic char
acter to anyone who has ever lacked the guts to
approach someone else and to everyone who
realizes that love runs deeper than looks.
