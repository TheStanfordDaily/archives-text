A combination of energy, subtlety and
brilliant acting, "Frank Fig Says Hello"
is warped — in an intriguing way. Set in
the turbulent 19605, the characters in the play
remain somehow untouched by political tur
moil. But make no mistake, Frank Fig and com
pany are quite busily occupied in their own
lives. And that's 36 characters, mind you. Quite
a feat, considering that there are only two actors
in the play.
Energy and Hyperspeed
On the surface, "Frank Fig Says Hello" is a
cartoonish, hyperspeed production which por
trays the life of a young boy living in a small
town on the border between Ireland and
Northern Ireland.
"We just want to provide an energetic hour
and a half," said senior Mike Oristian, who
plays Frank Fig. And energy is certainly a cur
rent which runs— literally— throughout the
show. Geoff Sobelle exerts himself by playing
the 35 or so other characters. Pat McCabe wrote
the piece for only two actors, despite the many
characters.
The play contains many unusual dramatic
elements. Both actors pantomime well, and the

physical stunts, many of them precisely and ex
citingly staged, make the play a new experience.
"The hyperreality of the play is so unique,
especially at Stanford," Oristian said. "This
show has both depth and childishness."
Perception and Reality
At the end of Pat McCabe's piece, Frank says
forlornly, "1 just want to watch the orange sky,"
and his friend Joe responds, "The sky's not or
ange, Frank."
In many ways, the simple quote reveals the
deeper meaning and subtlety behind the Red
Hoop Players' new production. The orange sky
and the perception of its color is a statement
about the warped representation of reality,
which plays a big part in Frank Fig's life.
Piglet, a young boy growing up in Ireland,
lives in a world of his own imagination, and
while the characters he meets throughout his
life are eccentric and interesting, the audience is
never sure if they are real. That's the point. It
doesn't matter, because Piglet is disturbed but
highly imaginative. What his mind sees is better
than the reality.
The reality is that his life is falling apart —
his mother is occasionally in the mad house, his
dad is depressed and no longer plays his saxo
phone. He has one good friend, Joe, but every
one else seems to be against him.
"The play is about reality and the represen
tation of reality," director Caroline Laskow said.
"McCabe chose not to hide the unreality, the
theatricality of watching one character change
into another."
Life and Drama

In real life, producing such a com
plex piece was as difficult as constant
ly switching characters. Fall quarter,
Oristian approached L.askow and So
belle about doing a production to
gether.
Laskow then chose "Frank Pig" after
seeing the play's premiere at Dublin's
Gate Theatre when in Ireland the previ
ous summer. The play is based on Mc-
Cabe's novel, "The Butcher Boy."
"When I read the script, I thought,
'Oh cool, we get to do Irish accents,'"
Oristian said. But preparing for the play,
while fun, has been hard and demand
ing.
"It's the biggest thing I've ever done,"
said Sobelle. Sobelle said the hardest part
has been being comfortable enough
with the play to know when the next
change of character comes for him.
The play has some political overtones
which seep, however. The orange from
the orange sky can also refer to Protes-

tant Orange in the politically charged context of
the Irish border.
Laskow, a communication major who grad
uated in March, said that while the play has po
litical overtones, that is not the main element of
the show. McCabe, an Irish writer and play
wright, insisted in interviews that the play is not
political, Laskow said.
Although life around the world in the 1960s
was transforming rapidly, "Frank Fig" is about
breaking out of boredom in an isolated region.
"The play is very much influenced by the claus

trophobia of living in a small town in a small
country in the 19605," said Laskow.
In the end, whether one interprets it political
ly or not, the play resonates on many levels.
The orange sky is a repeated theme which
floats in whenever Frank is at his lowest points
— it is a reminder of his childhood and his lost
innocence.
"The orange sky... it's wonderful because it
is a resting point, a landmark that is comforting
to the character," Sobelle said. And in Piglet's
disturbed and disturbing world, comfort might
be the most important thing.
