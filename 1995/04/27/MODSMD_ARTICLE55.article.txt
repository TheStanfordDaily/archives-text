Foreign films — well, here's your chance to
whip out that foreign language dictionary
that's been collecting dust for the last couple
years (or you can cheat and just read subtitles).
"Belle Epoque," a current release di
rected by Fernando Trueba, takes us back to
Spain in the 19305. A young soldier named
Fernando, played by Jorge Sanz (muy guapo),
goes AWOL and runs off to the countryside to
find a new life for himself. An older gentle
man, Don Manolo, befriends Fernando and
invites him to stay in his home. The real fun
begins when Don Manolo's four beautiful
daughters arrive home for the summer holi
days. As you might expect, there's quite a bit of
romping about, tumbling in haylofts — you
know, the usual stuff. The story is funny, orie

inal and racy. Well worth the $3 at Block
buster.
"The Wedding Banquet," directed
by Ang Lee, brings East and West together in a
comic story that is guaranteed to please. Wai-
Tung (Winston Chao) likes his life as it is, but
his parents think that it's time for their only
son to marry and give them grandchildren.
But Wai-Tung has a lover already ... and he
doesn't think Dad's going to like Simon
(Mitchell Lichtenstein) very much. So, Wai-
Tung concocts a brilliant plan — he marries a
nice Chinese girl (who happens to need a
green card) to please his parents. But when
Mom and Dad arrive from China to celebrate
his wedding, the farcical marriage gets com
pletely out of hand. "The Wedding Banquet"

is a colorful, funny, fast-paced film.
"Camille Claudel" is the story of the
passionate love affair between Claudel and her
famous lover Auguste Rodin. This French
film, nominated in 1989 for Best Foreign Film,
relies less on dialogue than on pregnant si
lences and artistic cinematography. Isabelle
Adjani and Gerard Depardieu both give bril
liant performances as Claudel and Rodin, re

spectively. Perhaps the film's only drawback is
that it is long — 2 hours 40 minutes.
If you're not in the mood to read subtitles,
you might want to check out Roman Polans
ki's "Bitter Moon." Fiona and Nigel
(Kristin Scott Thomas and Hugh Grant, both
from "Four Weddings and a Funeral") have
been married for seven years and decide to go
on a cruise to put some of the spice back into
their love life. Romantic sparks fly in unex
pected directions when they meet an Ameri
can writer and his bombshell French wife. The
relationships are portrayed with a sharp, bit
ing edge. This movie is dark and cynical. A
thought-provoking film — I reserve judg
ment on this flitfk... See it and decide for
yourself.
