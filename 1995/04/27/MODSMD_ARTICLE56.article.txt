Don Juan DeMarco
"Don Juan DeMarco" is an
utterly charming fantasy about the
kind of man every woman dreams of
and every man wishes he could be
One moment in Queens and the
next on a deserted island or in a sul
tan's harem, the film engages us in
flights of fancy, teasing the imagina
tion with amorous possibilities
Johnny Depp steals the show as the
legendary amorist creating a char
acter both honest and debonair.
"Don Juan DeMarco" could
come across as a nonsensical,
piece-of-fluff movie. But if you leave
your skepticism at home and arrive
at the theater with your imagination
(and preferably, a date), you'll get a
kick out of this flick.
Erotique
Not long ago, Atom Egoy
an's multisexual intrigue "Exotica"

whetted our libidinous appetites by
exploring themes of eroticism. Now
close at its heels comes "Erotique,"
an international anthology from
American director Lizie Borden,
Germany's Monika Treut and Hong
Kong filmmaker Clara Law.
But if the well-done "Exotica"
satisfied your palate, don't bother
seeing "Erotique," because this en
tree is raw,
Films one and three — "Let's
Talk About Sex" and "Wanton
Soup" — are certainly worth seeing.
But besides the fact that women
have sex, and direct movies too, it's
hard to find any justification for why
we should be watching these films
back to back.
Bar Girls
When watching "Bar Girls," I
kept asking myself the same simple
question: What is so interesting

about people who have jobs, fall in
love, have stupid affairs, drink cof
fee and talk about sex all the friggin'
time?
Nothing. Nada. Niente.
The main characters of "Bar
Girls" are all women, and women
who like other women. But they are
shallow, aimless, obnoxious women
who I wouldn't want to be acquaint
ed with, no matter what my sexual
orientation.
"Bar Girls," is not worth your
time. If you want to see real filmed
emotion between characters who
are not strictly heterosexual, go see
"The Crying Game" or "Farewell My
Concubine."

Newcomer Ning Jing may
pose a serious challenge to the

pedestal of Orientalist fantasy Gong
Li. Ravishing as the protagonist,
Ning radiates a China-doll aura
even when cross-dressing in male
attire for most of the film.
Director He Ping does justice
to Feng Jicai's source novel, thanks
in part to three strong lead actors,
bravura art direction, crisp editing,
and the unprecedented use of a
hand-held Steadicam.
As the film enters its second
half, though, the narrative's econo
my of style gives way to tiresome
circularity, which makes its point
early on but later signals signs of a
nervous retreat.
The heroine-victim compos
ite figure fetishizing the strong-yet
serene Chinese female ideal has ex
hausted all artistic possibility.
