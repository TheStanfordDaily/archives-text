## Kristie Lü Stout Kitsch of distinction: The low-down on low brow 
### 
Bonjour, baby.
LikeSnapple'sCremed'Vanilla, I'm hereto
irk your grammatical sensibilities and freak
with your tastebuds | insert canned applause
here]. I'm here to give you the low-down on
low-brow.
Sooooo, those of you in the backward
baseball-cap crowd who don the Eddie Bauer
instead of the Members Only 4', listen up.
Those of you who sprinkle feta instead of Bac
o-Bits® on your warm spinach salad, don't
turn that dial. Just read on because this is (in
sert drum roll here| ... the mondo-bitchin
treatise on bad taste.
Had taste feels like wet velour, tastes like EZ
Cheese and smells like Newts momma after a
meal at Buenoßueno. It knows all the words
to the latest Tom Jones album and whines
"coochie coochie" when it has one two many
Yoo Hoo cocktails. It's fuschia. It's can
dyflipped. It's stalking Martha Stewart with a
vengeance. Kitsch me. The numero uno em
bodiment of bad taste is that mecca of neon,

Las Vegas. Las Vegas is low brow because it
showcases a plethora of kitschy resorts that
try so hard to be what they ain't. Caesar's
claims to be a Roman metropolis. The lobby
of the Mirage, moist with dewy palms, claims
to be a tropical rainforest. The Luxor claims to
be a pharaoh's posthumous playpen.
But even the most myopic of all Mr. Mag
goo's would know that these virtual resorts are
anything but real. They, like Pamela Ander
son's breasts, are pho-neeee. Other examples
ofbad tastiness that fall under this category in
clude astroturf, pink flamingos, Spam®, roco
co lawn ornaments, Cool-Whip®, spray-on
hair (CFC-free, of course), vinyl, zirconia
rings and Kurt Cobain impersonators. I rving
so desperately to resemble the real thing but
never quite making it, these items are slapped
(Slap!) with the bad taste label.
OK. OK. OK. Here we go with embodi
ment ot bad taste No. 2: John Tesh. Although
some may call him a "Yanni-be," Tesh's desire
to resemble the king of muzak is not the fac

tor that grants him the bad taste label. It's his
insipidness that makes this male Mary Hart
so gosh-darn repugnant. His music, trying
soo freaking hard to please everyone, has ab
solutely no nuance. It's bland. It's lukewarm.
It tastes like poi. Other examples from the
John Tesh School of Bad Taste include the
Gap, 1 lallmark messages, Bob Hope, McDon
ald's, Katie Couric and "Forrest Gump."
These Numb and Number products lack so
much elan vitale that they become, like
Lawrence Welk on valium, bland and taste
less.
Now, before you fold up this newspaper
and go back to your Ralph Lauren reverie,
wait, lust wait. Bad taste is not bad. Repeat
after me: bad taste good. Now, it's bad if you
model your fingering abilities after John Tesh,
but not if you model it after R. Crumb or
Lynda Barry. Bad taste, if carried with just
enough attitude to fool even Mr. T, can turn
into an amusing and even respectable charac
ter trait. As Baudelaire once spewed forth,

"Bad taste is the aristocratic pleasure of not
pleasing." The nobles of pop trash are more
low brow than Gary Coleman in day-glo. But,
unlike everyone's favorite fallen kiddie star,
the pop trash nobles have the gonads to get
away with being low brow. Jackson Pollack
got away with it when he wore his splatter
painted dungarees to black-tie soirees. Marcel
Duchamp got away with it when he renamed
a urinal. Michael Stipe got away with it when
he smeared his eyebrows blue on the MTV
music awards. These icons of kool got away
with it because they are established icons of
kool. But, WARNING: don't try this at home,
kiddo. Pollack, Duchamp and Stipe are
skilled professionals.
Voila. Now you know everything you
needed to know about bad taste but were
afraid to ask that Heather Locklear lookalike
behind the Estee Lauder counter at Nieman's.
Congrats.
Now, go tie-dye your Armani pocket-t
fuschia.
