# Res Ed attempts again to find permanent head
## 
### Akin Salawu Staff writer 
Lacking a full-time director for four
years, Residential Education began inter
views and public forums this Monday in
what will be the second attempt in two
years to find a new leader.
The post of permanent director has
been vacant since Alice Supton resigned in
April 1993. After holding the post for 13
years, Supton had been working part-time
for the two years before her resignation.
Until recently, Diana Conklin and Ann
Porteus had been sharing the position as
acting co-directors of Res Ed. Earlier this
month, Conklin moved into a new position
as manager of undergraduate residential
facilities, leaving Porteus as the sole act
ing director.
At a series of open forums, candidates
will discuss their backgrounds in student
affairs, their philosophies on experience
outside the classroom and how residen
tial living contributes to the lives of stu
dents and their ideas on building commu

nity.
Students, faculty and staff are encour
aged to attend the forums to meet and
question the candidates. There will be
evaluation forms available after each
forum so that members of the Stanford
community can state their opinions about
each candidate to Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds â€” who will be
making the final decision, said Nadine
O'Leary, Edmonds' assistant.
The four candidates, all women, have
varying backgrounds in education and
university administration.
Nancy Kane, associate dean of the Col
lege of Arts and Sciences at George Mason
University, was the first to be interviewed.
She has a doctorate in higher education
administration from Florida State Univer
sity.
Jane Camarillo is the North area direc
tor at UCLA where she received a doctor
ate in psychology.
Sally Walker is a research assistant at
Harvard University. She is
expecting a doctorate in admin
istration, planning and social
policy from Harvard in June and
has a master's degree in educa
tion in student personnel from
Indiana University.
Porteus, the fourth finalist,
has a doctorate in educational
psychology from Stanford.
The selection process is still
in its primary stage, O'Leary
said. The current round of inter
views should be completed by
May 16. A final choice will be
made by Edmonds "hopefully
before Dead Week" this June,

O'Leary said.
The responsibilities of the job
include managing Res Ed, resi
dential computing, field offices,
residence deans and graduate
residence office staff. The direc
tor will work with the vice
provost for student affairs, the
vice provost for undergraduate
education and appropriate Uni
versity committees to establish
criteria for the recruiting, select
ing, training, supporting and
evaluating of residential fellows.
The director is also responsi
ble for developing and adminis
tering a budget of approximately
$4 million, and aiding the devel
opment of educational programs
and activities.
Open forums will continue
through May 15.
