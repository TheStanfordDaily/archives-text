### Akin Salawu Staff writer 
Lacking a full-time director for four
years, Residential Education began inter
views and public forums this Monday in
what will be the second attempt in two
years to find a new leader.
The post of permanent director has

April 1993. After holding the post for 13

evaluation forms available after each

University, was the first to be interviewed.
She has a doctorate in higher education
administration from Florida State Univer
sity.
Jane Camarillo is the North area direc

ate in psychology.
Sally Walker is a research assistant at
