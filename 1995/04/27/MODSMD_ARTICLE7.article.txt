# Economist Krueger elected to science academy
## 
### Joanna Dickler 
Economics Prof. Anne Krueger
didn't expect the phone call she received
Tuesday morning telling her the Na
tional Academy of Sciences had elected
her as one of its newest members.
"I'm delighted and surprised,"
Krueger said.
The academy is a private organiza

tion of scientists and engineers that
strives to further science and its use for
the general welfare, according to an
academy release. Election to the acade
my, which was established in 1863 by a
congressional act of incorporation, is
considered one of the highest honors a
scientist or engineer can attain.
On Tuesday the academy announced
the election of 60 new members and 15

foreign associates, bringing the total
number of members to 1,733. Those
elected were chosen on the basis of their
distinguished and continuing achieve
ments in original research.
Krueger joins 104 other Stanford fac
ulty currently serving on the academy,
in addition to five members affiliated
with the Hoover Institution.
A member of the faculty since 1993,

Krueger came to Stanford from Duke
University. She is a prominent expert
on international economics and eco
nomic development, has taught at the
University of Minnesota and served as
vice president for economics and re
search at the World Bank.
Currently, Krueger is researching
preferential trading arrangements
and the economic difficulties aris
ing from the protectionist policies
followed in developing countries
such as Mexico. The author of
many books and journal articles
concerning international eco
nomics, her research has garnered
several awards, including the
Bernhard-Harms Prize from the
Kiel Institute of World Economics
and the Robertson Prize from the
National Academy of Sciences.
The academy has benefited
from Krueger's expertise in the
past when she participated in
task forces it sets up to help the

scientific community make con
tributions to society. Now that
she is an official member,
Krueger said, "it doesn't really
impact my career, it's just an
honor â€” a very nice one."
Krueger serves as president
elect of the American Economic
Association, the nation's largest
association of practicing
economists. In addition, she is
currently directing a project on
the political economy of U.S.
trade relations at the National
Bureau of Economic Research,
where she is a research associate.
Krueger doesn't have any
immediate plans to celebrate her
election to the academy. "I'm so
far behind in work right now,"
she said. "I'm just trying to catch
up."
