# Fifty years later
## Survivors and relatives tell how the Holocaust affected their lives 
### Ben Decker Contributing writer 
Yesterday Stanford students remembered the vic
tims of the Holocaust during an evening discussion
with survivors and an American general who fought
to liberate Dachau, a Nazi concentration camp.
"Every year after Passover, we celebrate Holo
caust Commemoration Day," said Car a Goodman, a
member of Hillel, a Jewish student organization.
"This year marks the 50th Anniversary of the end of
the Holocaust and the liberation of many concentra
tion camps."
Speakers included Dr. Charles Stevens, who spent
four years hiding in Nazi-occupied Poland; General
Kenneth G. Wickham, who served as a colonel in the
U.S. Army; and Debra Trilling, the daughter of a con
centration camp survivor.
Stevens was the first to speak. "The most impor
tant story of the Holocaust is, of course, the s ix mil
lion Jews killed by the Germans," he began, "but an
other important story is that of the Jews who man
aged to avoid being captured by the Germans and sur
vived."
Born in Belgium in the late 19305, Stevens was
only five years old when his parents placed him in a
Protestant orphanage to protect him from the

Gestapo. "Generally, children survived by being hid
den. Today these survivors are referred to as hidden
children — I was one of those hidden children," he
said.
To protect him, Stevens' parents convinced him he
was not Jewish. He was baptized as a Catholic and re
calls, "I did not know I was Jewish until a year after

the war was over."
During the war Stevens remembers that "there
was little food, clothing or medical care. Our food was
filled with worms and my head bled from bee." But he
said he considered all this "very normal" because he

had never known anything better.
After the war was over,
Stevens was reunited with his
parents and immigrated to the
United States, where he later
received his doctorate in nuclear
physics at the University of
Michigan.
Wickham next told his story of
the April 1945 liberation of
Dachau. At the time, Wickham
was a colonel in the 45th

Infantry. After Munich was
taken, he was given the job of
securing the city and the sur
rounding area.
The general said he remem
bers Munich as "600,000 people
in chaos." He was placed in
charge of assuring the safety of
the entire population and over
100,000 German prisoners of
war.
While surveying the area,
Wickham visited Dachau, located
outside the city. "It was not a
huge place," Wickham said, "but
bodies were everywhere. They
were naked and emaciated. It

looked as if they were being pre
pared for cremation."
At the time it was captured
Dachau held 32,000 prisoners.
"They slept in bunkholes, like
sardines in a can," Wickham said.
"Among both the survivors and
camp guards, I saw hate like I'd
rarely seen before. Someone said
war is hell — well, it certainly is."
Following Wickham, Debra
Trilling spoke about the experi
ences of her mother in the War
saw Ghetto — famed for the
stand its residents took against
the Nazis during the German
occupation. Trilling studies the

trauma of children of Holocaust
victims.
"Many of us live with the
desire to know but a reluctance
to ask questions," Trilling said.
"Not until two days ago did I
learn many of the details of my
mothers experience."
Trilling stressed that the
Holocaust is definitely an "event
that [needs] to be taught and
remembered." But she said she
also felt that Jewish people need
to concentrate as much on the
positive aspects of their cultural
tradition as on their past victim
ization.
