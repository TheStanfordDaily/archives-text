Who We Are...
Forbes Marshall is working to be a developed
company in a developing country. We're India's
leading manufacturer of steam engineering and
process controls. That means we make everything
from boilers and valves to funky things like Vortex
flowmeters and handheld efficiency analysers.
We've got 700 employees, offices in every major
Indian city, plus agents in 9 countries overseas.
We're also proud of our reputation in Indian
Industry for our progressive work environment and
active recruiting of women, minorities and the
physically challenged.
Who We're Looking For...
We're looking for Stanford folk to come work in
India for a year or more, depending on how you
like it here. We're interested in hiring majors in
Product Design, STS, Industrial, Mechanical and
Electrical Engineering. We'll also talk to anyone
who feels that they might have something special
to contribute beyond a techie degree.

Farhad Forbes (BS,MS'79, Sloan Fellow '91)
Malcolm McWhorter (Professor Emeritus, EE)
Dev Patnaik (PD '92)
Bob Becker (PD '93)
Rob Swift (IR '93)
What You Need...
Let's face it, living and working in a foreign
country like India can be pretty tough. You
need to have that special mix of flexibility and
chutzpah to thrive and be productive in a
wigged-out, wierded-out, frustrating, yet
exhilarating environment.
What You Get...
We'll give you more freedom and
responsibility than any US company in their
right mind can offer you straight out of college.
We'll also provide you with an apartment,
medical coverage, assorted extras, plus
money for beer or whatever else floats your
boat.
If you're interested, you should mail/fax/e-mail
your resume to us, pronto. We'll be setting up
campus interviews in the coming weeks.
