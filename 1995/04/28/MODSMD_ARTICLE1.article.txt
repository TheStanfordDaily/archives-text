# Voucher anxieties
## Fight over legislation causes Moe to worry 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
Just 18 months after 70 per
cent of California's voters reject
ed a controversial student vouch
er initiative, Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe and other vouch
er supporters are organizing to in
troduce a new voucher proposal
for the November 1996 ballot.
Like the failed Proposition
174, the new initiative would give
primary- and secondary-school
students vouchers worth a speci
fied amount of money to use for
tuition at public or private
schools.
"Our first concern is to free
kids from schools that are bad and
let them choose schools that are
good. I think that also public
schools would improve under the
initiative," Moe said.
Moe, along with UC-Berkeley
Law Profs. John Coons and Steve
Sugarman, introduced two new
voucher proposals the day after
Proposition 174 was defeated in
November 1993.
Shortly thereafter, wealthy
businessmen William E. Obern
dorf and John T. Walton contact
ed the three to organize and fi
nance the new campaign for stu
dent vouchers.
Oberndorf and Walton found
ed the San Diego-based American
Education Reform Foundation to
organize political support for the
voucher initiative.
Since then, however, political
and philosophical differences
within the foundation have
threatened to divide the move
ment for student vouchers.
Moe's group wants to address
public concerns related to Propo
sition 174, while other voucher
supporters are pushing for pro
posals very similar to the defeated
proposition.
"The public was afraid that
Proposition 174 would under
mine funds for public schools,
that the new private schools
would not be accountable and
that poor children would not be
treated fairly," Moe said.
