# Voucher anxieties
## Fight over legislation causes Moe to worry 
### Marie Rosencrantz 
Just 18 months after 70 per
cent of California's voters reject
ed a controversial student vouch
er initiative, Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe and other vouch
er supporters are organizing to in
troduce a new voucher proposal
for the November 1996 ballot.
Like the failed Proposition
174, the new initiative would give
primary- and secondary-school
students vouchers worth a speci
fied amount of money to use for
tuition at public or private
schools.
"Our first concern is to free
kids from schools that are bad and
let them choose schools that are
good. I think that also public
schools would improve under the
initiative," Moe said.
Moe, along with UC-Berkeley
Law Profs. John Coons and Steve
Sugarman, introduced two new
voucher proposals the day after
Proposition 174 was defeated in
November 1993.
Shortly thereafter, wealthy
businessmen William E. Obern
dorf and John T. Walton contact
ed the three to organize and fi
nance the new campaign for stu
dent vouchers.
Oberndorf and Walton found
ed the San Diego-based American
Education Reform Foundation to
organize political support for the
voucher initiative.
Since then, however, political
and philosophical differences
within the foundation have
threatened to divide the move
ment for student vouchers.
Moe's group wants to address
public concerns related to Propo
sition 174, while other voucher
supporters are pushing for pro
posals very similar to the defeated
proposition.
"The public was afraid that
Proposition 174 would under
mine funds for public schools,
that the new private schools
would not be accountable and
that poor children would not be
treated fairly," Moe said.
His proposal includes mea
sures to regulate private schools
through rules about financial dis
closure and teaching standards.
Under this initiative, the
vouchers would also be tilted in
favor of low-income children to
address educational inequalities.
They would be given larger
vouchers and granted first priori
ty to receive vouchers while the
system is gradually phased in.
However, libertarians within
the voucher movement oppose the
increased regulations proposed by
Moe's group. Others, such as rep
resentatives for religious schools,
are pushing for universal subsi
dies for private schools.
Moe expressed concern that
Walton and Oberndorf have gone
too far in their attempt to include

all factions of the voucher move
ment.
"I am afraid that this is moving
too much in a libertarian direc
tion and that the new proposi
tions look too much like Proposi
tion 174," Moe said. "If they
abandon our principles, we will
leave."
Splitting from Walton and
Oberndorf's group, which has
already assured funding for the
voucher campaign, would require
Moe's group to raise funds else
where.
"Money is very important,
unfortunately," Moe said. "There
are a lot of people who don't know
very much about (the voucher ini
tiative) and who are very influ
enced by media and campaigns."
However, Moe said that since
his group is attempting to address
public concerns about student
vouchers he expects their initia
tive to gain broad support.
He also expects to be able to

raise $30 million independently to
promote the voucher proposal
before the '96 elections, if neces
sary.
Education Prof. Michael Kirst
acknowledged that Moe's propos
al "is skillfully designed to
address the public concerns."
"The public wants accountabil
ity, regulations and a scheme that
does not hurt public schools,"
Kirst said.
Kirst did express concerns,
however, that the student vouch
er initiative is an "unknown and
unknowable experiment," as the
proposal depends on the future
supply and demand for private
schools.
"I would like someone to exper
iment with it somewhere, but Cal
ifornia is an awfully large system
to experiment with. You are talk
ing about experimenting with five
million children," Kirst said.
Moe said he recognizes the
political and practical difficulties

associated with introducing stu
dent vouchers in California.
But he stressed that the prob
lems with California's public edu
cation system are all too obvious
to voters."I think that if we can
introduce vouchers in California,
other states would follow," he
said.
According to Moe, the problem
of reconciling views within the
voucher movement will delay the
actual filing of a new voucher
proposition for another couple of
months.
Moe said he expects the Cali
fornia Teachers Association
(CTA), which spent more than
$10 million to defeat Proposition
174 in 1993, to remain opposed
also to any new voucher initiative.
"The unions will always oppose
market initiatives no matter
what; it is a survival issue for
them," he said.
The CTA could not be reached
for comment.
