### Marie Rosencrantz 
Panelists at the Law School yesterday laud
ed the United States for finally submitting a
domestic human rights report mandated by
the United Nations since 1992.
John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state
for human rights, and Paul Hoffman, former
legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California, discussed the
report in front of more than 60 people.
The report was the first ever to be present
ed by the United States in accordance with its
obligations under the U.N. International Con
vention on Civil and Political Rights.
The human rights treaty entered into force
in 1976 but was not ratified by the United
States until April 1992. It has to date been rat
ified by 127 countries.
"The U.S. has always been wonderful in
imposing human rights standards on other
countries but poor in applying them to our
selves," Shattuck said. "It is a long overdue
process for the United States to begin to apply
domestically what it has for long been advo

cating abroad."
In his speech, Shattuck stressed the impor
tance of establishing a "global structure on
human rights." He noted that the number of
people killed by their own governments is four
times as great as the number of people killed
in international wars.
Shattuck cited historical international
human rights violations such as the Holocaust
and the recent genocide in Rwanda as exam
ples.
In addition, he pointed to human rights vio
lations in U.S. history like the enslavement of
African Americans and the destruction of
many Native American civilizations.
Hoffman, however, argued that the U.S.
ratification of the U.N. human rights treaty is
merely a small step in the right direction.
He noted that the convention has no
enforcement mechanism to ensure that the
United States follows its regulations.
While most of the provisions in the treaty
are already addressed in the U.S. Constitu
tion, Hoffman provided examples to show
instances when legislation falls short of the

rights protected in the convention.
For example, the protection of due process
rights of prisoners under the treaty is more
extensive than it is in U.S. law.
Referring to Native American rights, pris,-
oner's rights and women's rights, among oth
ers, Hoffman said, "I think you can make the
argument in all these instances that the U.S.
does not fully live up to the convent."
The United States also reserves the right to
impose capital punishment on people younger
than 18 years old, which is prohibited under
the U.N. treaty.
According to Shattuck, the death penalty is
hotly debated in the U.S. legislative bodies.
"We do not rule out the possibility of radical
change (in current U.S. law)," he said.
Shattuck has requested a review of all state
law to ensure t hat it satisfies the obligations of
the convent.
The assembled audience in general reacted
positively to the panel discussion. "I think we
got a very good view of what the convent
means for the U. 5.," said Nader Mousavi, a
first-year law student.
