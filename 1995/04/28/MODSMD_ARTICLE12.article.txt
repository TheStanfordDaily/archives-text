# Feds sue to block Microsoft merger
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The govern
ment yesterday dealt a potentially fatal
blow to Microsoft Corp.'s $2 billion
purchase of Intuit Inc. when it sued to
block the deal as a threat to competi
tion.
The Justice Department's antitrust
division charged that Microsoft's buy of
Intuit, Inc. — maker of the highly pop
ular Quicken personal finance program
— "would likely lead to higher prices
and lessened innovation" in the grow
ing market for such programs. The suit
was filed in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco. The purchase would be the
biggest software merger ever.
The merger "threatens to harm con
sumers in other important areas of
commerce" such as home banking ser
vices for personal computers, the
department said.
At the very least, the lawsuit delays

the merger, a stock swap valued at $1.5
billion when the deal was announced
Oct. 13, 1994. Microsoft's stock price
has since increased, boosting the price
tag to more than $2 billion.
Microsoft and Intuit agreed not to
close the deal until resolution of the
Justice Department's lawsuit, said
Steven C. Sunshine, a deputy assistant
attorney general who handled the case.
He added the government is seeking an
expedited trial, but no date is set
Intuit's stock plunged following the
filing, closing down $10.25 at $72.75 a
share on the Nasdaq Stock Market,
while Microsoft lost $1 to close at
$78.62 1/2 a share.
"Allowing Microsoft to buy a domi
nant position in this highly concentrat
ed market would likely result in higher
prices for consumers who want to buy
personal finance software and would

cause those buyers to miss out on the
huge benefits from innovation," said
Anne K. Bingaman, the department's
assistant attorney general for
antitrust.
There are an estimated 7 million
Quicken users, representing about 70
percent of the personal money-manage
ment software market, the Justice
Department said. Microsoft's Money
had a 22 percent share of the market.
To pave the way for the Intuit acqui
sition, Microsoft agreed to give the
Microsoft Money prpgram to rival Nov
ell Corp.
"This so-called fix just won't work,"
Bingaman said. "Novell simply can't
replace Microsoft — with its leading
position in the personal computer soft
ware industry — in competing against
an entrenched, dominant product like
Intuit's Quicken," she added.
