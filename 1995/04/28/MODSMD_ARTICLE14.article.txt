Next year's COP should
start now to accomplish
some of its many goals

After they took much of
the ASSU Senate and the
Council of Presidents,
members of the People's Plat
form celebrated — and with good
reason. However, with the school
year winding down fast, the
incoming COP needs to start lay
ing the groundwork for the year
to come if it is — as the slate
promised — going to have a sig
nificant impact on student life at
Stanford.
This means putting aside the
mean-spirited rhetoric that was
all too common during the cam
paign and starting to work on
some ideas that will actually
make a difference to students. It
also means taking a serious look
at the results of last week's elec
tion — and perhaps even bor
rowing some ideas from the com
petition.
First, the numbers. "We
Deserve Better"only won a plu
rality of first-place votes thanks
to the strength of the other two
slates. The fact that the Hammer
and Coffin representatives —
perennial joke candidates — did
so well indicates that many stu
dents are still convinced that the
ASSU is an ineffective and irrele
vant organization; the biggest
task of the next COP is to try to
change that perception.
Another interesting fact from
the election is that graduate stu
dents were — compared to last
year — relatively silent. The
ASSU should not, however, use
graduate students' reluctance to
vote as an excuse to ignore half
the student population; grads
have unique needs that the ASSU
could address if it made an effort
to discover them.
The incoming COP made lots
of promises during the campaign;
to many, we fear, to all be ful

filled. Still, they appear to be very
eager to represent students in an
active manner. If the slate can
focus this energy on attainable
goals and priorities, "Deserve"
could fare better than its prede
cessors. Here are some sugges
tions:
• Better communication: The
COP — as well as the rest of the
ASSU — needs to develop a bet
ter way to communicate with the
students that they represent.
Such a network should not just
be used to proudly announce
accomplishments — students
need an efficient mechanism to
funnel problems and suggestions
to their leaders.
• Realistic and specific goals:
As usual, the winning slate
promised a lot more than it can
probably pull off. Besides the
inevitable push for "Taco Bell in
Tresidder," however, the slate's
members should pick a couple
more specific goals, announce
them to students and focus on
them right away. For example, an
ASSU course guide could be pro
duced fairly quickly if someone is
willing to take on the task. This
COP should.
• Productive advocacy: Each
year the COP meets with the
administration on large issues like
tuition hikes or student group
fund-raising — yet students still
seem to come up short. If it is to be
an effective advocate of student
interests, this Platform slate will
need to do its homework better
than its predecessors. That means
talking with students and admin
istrators throughout the yea, and
making goals and expectations
very clear. We don't want to see
the COP declare victory (again)
when Stanford pegs tuition
increases at a level that is sub
stantially greater than inflation.
For as long as we can remem
ber, COP members have done
more for their resumes than for
the Stanford student community.
"We Deserve Better" has the
enthusiasm to accomplish more
than that — if it stavs focused.
