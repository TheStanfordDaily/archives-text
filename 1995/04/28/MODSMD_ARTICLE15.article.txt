Senior class must protest elimination of procession

IT HAS COME to my attention that
the University has made a decision
to eliminate one of the best and
most anticipated parts of the gradua
tion ceremony, namely, the graduation
procession.
I am upset mostly because no one
asked me what I thought about such a
foolish decision until after that ridicu
lous decision was made — not our
senior class presidents (who are so
important that I could not name them
without going to the ASSU and ask
ing), not Lois Wagner, not anybody.
There were no open forums, no
announcements in The Daily, no phone
calls from our senior class presidents,
nothing. I don't want to sound like
Oliver Stone, but if you wanted to seem
like you had asked for a response from
the senior class without really getting
one, wouldn't you turn to having those
amorphous entities (i.e. the senior class
presidents) call their fellow classmates
(read: talk to their best friends while
watching Seinfeld)?
It's not that I dislike our class presi
dents; I don't even know them. But
when the University suggests abolish
ing one of our campus's greatest and

most representative traditions, a ritual
in which almost every senior partici
pates, they should have said "no!" Not
"Let's compromise." Not "You're in
charge — whatever you say, boss." Not
"I guess it really would save those tiger
salamanders." Just say "no/" Hell, look
at Nancy Reagan: She said it and was
able to run this great nation of ours.
Get some cajones. Stand up to the
whimsical decisions of stuffy elders
who make that anal-retentive law stu
dent look like a hippie on the best of
illegal narcotics.
Resist the apathy. We must band
together as a class and protest. Let's
show up at the doorstep of Gerhard
Casper's office to voice our opposition,
naked. That would certainly get his
attention, not to mention the flak he
would receive from his wife for having
been caught with so many young,
strapping, topless youths in his office.
Gerhard would certainly veto the
change.
We must face the facts. The real
motive behind this decision was the
"irreverence," not the logistics. Lois
Wagner's reason for the change — that
shortening the graduation ceremony

will give seniors more time to sleep in
and go to breakfast with relatives and
give a brief repose from the sun to
their poor deceased grandmothers in
wheelchairs — is complete and utter
bullshit. Forty-Five minutes is not
going to give anyone enough time to
sleep in and go to breakfast with their
families, and when has the University
started to care about keeping people
out in the sun for long periods of time?
If they did care about giving us more
sleep, breakfast with our families and
less time in the sun, then they might
have considered cutting out some of
the early morning events on Saturday,
or at least starting them at noon. But
the University did no such thing. The
one event that was targeted for termi
nation was the "irreverent" one.
Just looking at Lois Wagner's choice
of words in yesterday's Daily article —
that our procession is "an enormous
mob scene" — we know that she does
not like or approve of it. It seems pret
ty obvious that this is the real reason
for her decision to eradicate our proces
sion. After all, every other major uni
versity has serious graduation cere
monies; ours should too. Bullshit! Well,

Lois, if all your friends start becoming
pederasts, does that mean you should
too? (Don't answer; it was rhetorical.)
If we are unable to stop this
frivolous decision by the administra
tion (and we should be able to by peti
tion, protest, hunger strike, refusal to
attend ceremonies, rolling administra
tion offices with toilet paper, package
bombs that explode whip-cream, et
cetera), then I will personally make the
graduation ceremonies irreverent just
to piss off Lois Wagner and any other
administration official who is in
cahoots with her. And anyone is wel
come to join me. After all, I read some
where that the cap and gown is option
al, so I just won't wear them, or any
thing else for that matter. This is not a
vain threat. (Ask anyone in Ram's
Head.)
What we are dealing with here is an
attempt to evade the truth, to convo
lute the facts, to pull a fast one over on
the senior class. If it gets by us seniors
now, no future senior coalition will be
able to reverse the irreparable damage
to this time-honored tradition.
