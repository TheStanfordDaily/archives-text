## Do we even want diversity? 
### 
Diversity itself is diverse, it
may be the latest fashion, but its
supporters should recognize the
tensions within the concept and take care
to distinguish among the types of diversi
ty. Otherwise, they will make the mis
take of equating diversity with liberal
values.
Racial diversity and viewpoint diversi
ty, in particular, are commonly confused.
Racial diversity simply means people of
different races; viewpoint diversity
involves people who hold different view
points.
Whether it is political liberalism or
cultural conservatism, a person's race
should not be taken as somehow deter
mining his viewpoint. They might be
related, but not with a biological or logi
cal necessity.
Most proponents of superficial racial
diversity would be wary of genuine view
point diversity. Tolerating and encourag
ing a wide variety of viewpoints might
mean taking in and taking up neo-
Nazism, Ku Klux Klan white supremacy,
paramilitarism or religious fundamental
ism. Real diversity turns out to be moral
ly empty.
If it is to avoid hypocrisy, diversity
must mean something more than multi
plying differences. It must answer the
questions, "What diversity counts?" and
"How is that diversity measured?" Even
then, diversity may not achieve the goals
sought.

The typology of diversity must look to
its structural levels. Diversity can exist at
several levels, which are only partly com
patible with one another.
At the broadest level we might picture
a society that contains within it a wide
range of different institutions, each of
which internally is the same. An example
of such an institution is an historically
black college or a women's college. It dif
fers significantly from other institutions
because it is more or less uniform inter
nally. Unless some diversity is allowed at
this level, minorities can never form
majorities.
At another level we might want all
institutions to be integrated. No institu
tion would differ from any other institu
tion, but each of them would contain a
spectrum of individuals. An example
would be every college having some black
students and some female students. This
diversity is the most easily envisioned,
but it can compromise the other forms of
diversity and it may result in a lack of
choice at the institutional level.
At an intermediate level we might
interpose another layer. Regions could
vary. The Bay Area could have a powerful
and vibrant gay and lesbian culture,
while other areas were considerably
straighter. This diver sity is old-fashioned
"pluralism." It would work if people were
solely one-dimensional, and if everyone
could move easily to the best locale for
that trait which they valued.

Finally, we might imagine individuals
themselves as blending everything else.
This would occur with race if mixed mar
riages became the most common or most
desirable. Or it could be possible with
viewpoint if we all adopted conceptually
complex thinking, incorporating multiple
perspectives and contradiction.
Before we rush to embrace diversity,
we should look at other approaches taken
by the left that have been taken over by
the right. The rhetoric of oppression, vic
timization and revolution is used by
everyone, from those proclaiming the
martyrdom of straight white Christian
men to those purporting to "rescue"
unborn fetuses by murdering doctors.
The bad-boy image now characterizes
reactionary radio talk show hosts.
In contrast, the left has failed in
deploying the tactics of the right. The left
used to give offense and regard sensitivi
ty as nonsense. As if it were a matter of
etiquette and decorum, the left has
turned around, so that it wishes to be
sensitive always and offensive never.
Unfortunately for the left, the right like
wise can claim sensitivity and decry
offensiveness, but on behalf of an alto
gether different set of individuals and
groups.

Diversity will succeed if it progresses
beyond a buzzword.
