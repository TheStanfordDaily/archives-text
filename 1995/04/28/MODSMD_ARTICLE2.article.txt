# Computer may have been used illegally More ASSU violations?

### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
In the aftermath of the con
tentious ASSU spring election,
hearings officer Chi-Ming Chien
may have uncovered another pos
sible violation of campaign regula
tions.
Chien attempted yesterday to
look at the Council of Presidents
computer to see if it had been used
by members of the People's Plat
form party to make campaign
fliers and materials.
Under the equal access rules in
the ASSU Constitution, ASSU re
sources that are unavailable to all
students may not be used during
the election. The computer, which
is in a locked room and has a pass
word on it, is not available to all
students, Chien said.
According to Chien, he waited
for three hours for COP members
to allow him access to the comput
er. "I tried to get in touch with the
COP members. I spoke to (ASSU
Senate Chair] Nawwar [Kasrawil
personally and I asked someone to
come down, but no one showed
up."
Platform senator-elect Bill
Shen was at the office, but he said
he did not have the authority to
allow Chien to use the computer.
Chien has asked Nominations
Committee Chair Susie Thomas
to appoint a hearings commission
to look into the many alleged cam
paign violations and requested
that the COP convene a special
senate meeting in order to appoint
such a commission.
COP member Mork Murdock
said the COP probably will not call

a special meeting, though he is not
certain. Murdock said he does not
think any senator will be able to
attend such a meeting between
today and Tuesday.
Chien said a hearings commis
sion, if called, would look into all
alleged campaign infractions.
These include the alleged illegal
use of the COP computer, oOP
elect member Mike Choo's alleged
use of his position in the ASSU to
get access to Office of Develop
ment phone banks, the imputed
value of such phone banks, phone
harassment and e-mail violations.
"I want to make sure that judi
cial processes are not overlooked,"
Chien said. "I feel there are things
that need to be dealt with judicial
ly prior to certification."
The ASSU Senate must certify
the election next Tuesday before
its results are made official
Only a hearings commission
has the power to penalize candi
dates for campaign infractions.
But the commission must issue its
findings before the election is cer
tified.
Students' Alliance Chair Andre
Vanier said he thinks a hearings
commission should be formed.
"The senate is constitutionally re
quired to have an independent
hearings commission," Vanier
said. "So far the People's Platform
has refused to appoint an indepen
dent commission."
However, Chien said he is
doubtful that a hearings commis
sion will be formed to investigate
the matters. Even in the absence
of such a review, the senate may
certify the election results on
Tuesday.
