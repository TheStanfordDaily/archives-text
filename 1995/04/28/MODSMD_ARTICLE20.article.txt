## Tanya comes to the Farm Harding leads UCLA's No. 1 softball squad into twinbill against Cardinal 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
Brace yourselves, Stanford. Tanya Harding is
coming.
That's right. Stanford students fearless enough
to trek to El Camino Field Sunday at noon will get
a chance to watch New Zealand National Team
member Harding and the rest of the NO. I UCLA
Bruins softball team.
For Stanford (14-26 overall, 1-17 in the Pacific
10 Conference), the pair of games against UCLA
will be the team's third doubleheader of the week.
The Cardinal spanked the College of Notre Dame
yesterday 25-1 and 8-0. The team's second consec
utive sweep gave the Cardinal its first four-game
winning streak in team history. On Saturday,
Stanford will entertain Oregon in a doubleheader
at 1 p.m.
Stanford traveled to Oregon earlier this year,
only to lose both games of a doubleheader to the
Ducks with scores of 3-1 and 6-0. In those games,
however, the Cardinal possessed the services of
freshman phenom Jessica Schulman, who led the
team in wins and ERA prior to suffering a stress
fracture in her back that has left her out of action
indefinitely.
"Those games (at Oregon] were the First games
1 sophomore) Angela fWehbl had to pitch both ends
of a doubleheader," Stanford coach Sandy Pearce
said. "The first game was really close, but she just
got tired by the end of game two. Now she's used to
pitching both games and should do much better."
Webb (6-19) has performed admirably in Schul
man's place, as the experience of pitching every
game has served her well. Webb's ERA is 1.40 in
her last four games.
"Angela has improved a lot this season," coach
Sandy Pearce said. "If she can continue to pitch
like she has I the fast four games), we should do
well on Saturday."
Stanford will face the Ducks with a revamped
offensive lineup, as Pearce has shuffled the batting
order for the second time this season in an attempt
to revive a struggling offense.
Hot-hitting Amanda Renteria, the team'sjunior
left fielder, has been moved from the ninth spot in
the order to the third spot in an effort to allow her
to drive in more runs. Renteria is hitting .327 for
the season, second on the team to sophomore
shortstop Summer Lee, who is 20th in the nation
