## Tanya comes to the Farm Harding leads UCLA's No. 1 softball squad into twinbill against Cardinal 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
Brace yourselves, Stanford. Tanya Harding is
coming.
That's right. Stanford students fearless enough
to trek to El Camino Field Sunday at noon will get
a chance to watch New Zealand National Team
member Harding and the rest of the NO. I UCLA
Bruins softball team.
For Stanford (14-26 overall, 1-17 in the Pacific
10 Conference), the pair of games against UCLA
will be the team's third doubleheader of the week.
The Cardinal spanked the College of Notre Dame
yesterday 25-1 and 8-0. The team's second consec
utive sweep gave the Cardinal its first four-game
winning streak in team history. On Saturday,
Stanford will entertain Oregon in a doubleheader
at 1 p.m.
Stanford traveled to Oregon earlier this year,
only to lose both games of a doubleheader to the
Ducks with scores of 3-1 and 6-0. In those games,
however, the Cardinal possessed the services of
freshman phenom Jessica Schulman, who led the
team in wins and ERA prior to suffering a stress
fracture in her back that has left her out of action
indefinitely.
"Those games (at Oregon] were the First games
1 sophomore) Angela fWehbl had to pitch both ends
of a doubleheader," Stanford coach Sandy Pearce
said. "The first game was really close, but she just
got tired by the end of game two. Now she's used to
pitching both games and should do much better."
Webb (6-19) has performed admirably in Schul
man's place, as the experience of pitching every
game has served her well. Webb's ERA is 1.40 in
her last four games.
"Angela has improved a lot this season," coach
Sandy Pearce said. "If she can continue to pitch
like she has I the fast four games), we should do
well on Saturday."
Stanford will face the Ducks with a revamped
offensive lineup, as Pearce has shuffled the batting
order for the second time this season in an attempt
to revive a struggling offense.
Hot-hitting Amanda Renteria, the team'sjunior
left fielder, has been moved from the ninth spot in
the order to the third spot in an effort to allow her
to drive in more runs. Renteria is hitting .327 for
the season, second on the team to sophomore
shortstop Summer Lee, who is 20th in the nation
and fourth in the Pac-10 in hitting
with a .434 average. As the team's
leadoff hitter, Lee must get on
base for Renteria and the rest of
the Cardinal to be productive.
"I liked the production (four
runs in each game against Loyola
Marymount last Fridayl," Pearce
said. "We just have to see how we
fare against Pac-10 pitching."
Saturday's doubleheader will
give Stanford a chance to test its
now lineup against a mediocre
Pac-10 opponent.
"They're definitely beatable,"
Schulman said. "It's going to be a
good two games."
"Oregon is not a dominating
team," Pearce said. "They're
nowhere close to a UCLA or an

Arizona."
The real test for Stanford will
come on Sunday, as the big, bad
Bruins come to town. UCLA
bombed the Cardinal 11-1 and 10-
0 in a doubleheader in Los Angeles
last weekend.
Preparing for the top-ranked
Bruins inevitably means trying to
find a way to stop Harding. In Los
Angeles, Harding was 3-for-3 with
three RBIs in the second game
against Stanford. One of her three
hits was her fourth home run in
only eight games this season.
Harding was equally impressive
on the mound, dominating Stan
ford with a two-hitter in which the
fireballer struck out nine Cardinal
batters.
"We have to pitch her in on her
hands more to try and jam her,"
Pearce said "Angela's been work
ing on that in practice. She has to
hit her spots to be effective."

Against Arizona two weeks ago,
Webb was much more successful
in the second of two games by
pitching the Wildcats inside.
"It's her National Team experi
ence (that makes Harding so
good|," Schulman said. "I played
against players on the national
teams this summer on my club
team, and the competition at that
level is so high that they just play
at another level."
Schulman, who is from Los
Angeles, added that she is looking
forward to getting another shot at
her hometown school.
"It's exciting to play them. I
grew up watching them, and I
know almost every girl on the
team," she said. "They're a great
team but they are beatable. We
just have to play our game. We've
been scrappy all year long, and
we're capable of giving them a real
close game."
