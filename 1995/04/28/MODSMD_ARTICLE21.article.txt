# Cardinal hitters poised to flatten Arizona hurlers
## Weak Wildcat pitching staff should provide little challenge 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The race is on.
With six games left in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division
schedule for the Stanford base
ball team, every game becomes a
must-win situation. The No. 17
Cardinal (25-19 overall, 15-9 in
the Six-Pac) currently resides a
game behind the division-lead
ing USC Trojans (34-16, 16-8 in
the Six-Pac), and Stanford's
opportunity to move up in the
standings has arrived.
The Cardinal will take on the
unranked University of Arizona
(18-30, 5-19 in the Six-Pac) in a
three-game series that means
virtually nothing to the Wildcats
but everything to Stanford. The
two teams, polar opposites, are
on sharply contrasting sides of
the competitive spectrum. Ari
zona, residing at the bottom of
the standings, has only pride to
play for.
"At this point, we aren't going
to the regionals, we can't even be
.500," Wildcat left fielder Menno
Wickey said last week. "What we
are playing for now is the future
of the younger players and
pride."
The Cardinal, on the other
hand, looks to repeat as Six-Pac
champion and turn back the
Trojans' attempt to wrest away
the crown.
"We expected (USC| to be our
main competition," freshman
pitcher Kyle Peterson said. "If
we win the rest of our Six-Pac
games, that forces USC to win
five Ito tie for the title]."
Stanford will attempt to pull
off the three-game sweep start

ing this afternoon. At 2:30 p.m.
at Sunken Diamond, Kyle Peter
son will take the mound and try
to shut down Arizona for the sec
ond time this year. Peterson, at
8-1 and sporting a 3.08 ERA,
won his first start against the
Wildcats going seven innings in
an 18-3 romp on April 2.
"They're a good hitting
team," Peterson said. "They
swung the bat well against me."
Featuring the talents of
junior Scott Kidd and Wickey,
the Wildcats score an average of
7.4 runs each game. Arizona is
batting .301 on the year, thanks
to a trio of high batting averages.
Kidd, currently resting at .357,
leads the team, while freshman
center fielder Diego Rico is hit
ting .341 with 11 stolen bases.
Wickey, the leadoff batter for the
Wildcats, ranks third on the
team with his .337 batting aver
age but has scored 55 runs to go
with his 17 stolen bases and
eight home runs. The latter
three statistics are team highs.
While the Cardinal starting
pitchers, Peterson this aft' r
noon, juniors Dan Reed or Todd
Bartels, the Pac-10 Pitcher of
the Week, on Saturday and
junior Mike Robbins on Sunday,
might be slightly apprehensive
about facing the Arizona batters,
Stanford's hitters have no such
qualms with the Wildcat hurlers.
The Arizona pitchers, who
might as well come to Stanford
with the words "batting prac
tice" printed on their uniforms,
give new meaning to the word
"meat." While the Wildcats have
a moderately high staff ERA of
6.44 throughout its games, the

figure jumps to a ballistic 8.06 in
conference games. The Cardinal
batters, led by the triumvirate of
senior Steve Carver and juniors
Cale Carter and A.J. Hinch, will
get their chance to add to the 38
runs Stanford has scored against
Arizona this year.
Carver went nuts on Arizona's
hurlers in Stanford's three-game
sweep of the Wildcats on the road
at Frank Sancet Field back in
April. The third baseman went 6-

for-14 with two homers, including
a grand slam, and eight KBIs.
Carter drove in five runs on 8-for
-14 hitting, while Hinch was also
no slouch, knocking in seven runs
on 6-for-13 hitting. If this terrify
ing threesome comes anywhere
close to duplicating its perfor
mance in series, Arizona will have
a extremely long weekend.
Peterson, however, warned
against taking the Wildcats for
granted.
"We're definitely confident,"
Peterson said. "But we're not
over confident. We know any
thing can happen in baseball."
Last week provided proof for

his statement. After being swept
by USC two weeks ago, the Cardi
nal took three of four against Cal
to propel itself back into second
place, but fell to San Jose State in
a non-conference game on Tues
day. In addition, Stanford defies
conventional baseball wisdom by
struggling at home and being
nearly invincible on the road. The
Cardinal is 5-7 in the Six-Pac at
home but has taken 10 of 12 when
visiting other teams.
However, three wins against
Arizona will go a long way
towards changing the face of that
statistic and the complexion of
the Six-Pac race.
