## Track team competes in Fresno to qualify athletes for Pacific 10 Championships 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
With several runners competing at
the Penn Relays in Philadelphia, the
rest of the Cardinal track team will
head to Fresno this weekend for the
second annual California-Nevada

State Championships, to which all col
leges in both states are invited.
Numerous runners ran season-best
performances at last year's meet,
which was held at UCLA; this year the
hopes are for more of the same.
"It's great competition and it's set
up for you to (run a personal record I,"

said junior 800-meter runner Joe
Karlgaard.
This weekend's events and the Big
Meet against California May 6 at
Stanford Stadium are the last oppor
tunities for Stanford athletes to quali
fy for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in Tucson, Ariz., on

May 19 and 20.
Over on the East Coast, in
Philadelphia, a strong contingent of
mainly distance runners are looking
to take on some of the nation's best.
The highly successful women's dis-
tance medley relay team that
placed sixth at the NCAA Indoors
will also compete.
On the men's side, 19 athletes
have already qualified for the con
ference championships. A maxi
mum of 24 athletes may compete
for a team at the Pac-lOs.
"This will be the first year in a
long time that Stanford will take
24 athletes to the Pac-lOs, all of
whom of have hit the qualifying
standard," said Karlgaard, evi
dently confident of the perfor
mances for the next two week
ends.
Last weekend the Stanford
track teams traveled to Bear
country in Berkeley to compete in
an open track meet. In the sunny
heat that Saturday, 18 athletes
turned in personal-best perfor
mances, a sure indication that the
Cardinal squad is peaking at
exactly the right time.
This is no accident. Head coach
Vin Lananna, who is presently in
Philadelphia with the Penn Relay
participants, has curtailed the
bulk of the workouts for his run
ners over the last few weeks by
cutting down mileage while
increasing fast, speed-intensive
sessions.
The next three weeks are the
time to peak, since strong perfor
mances would let the Cardinal
qualify for the Pac-lOs and the
NCAA championships at the end
of May. For many on the Stanford
track team, there are only two
more chances to get an invitation
to the postseason party.
At last weekend's meet at Cali
fornia, junior sprinter Jimmie
Johnson turned more than a few
heads as he blazed through the
200-meter, showing the competi
tion that he is ready for the
upcoming challenges. At the
three-way meet against Oregon
and Fresno State on April 8,
Johnson scared his coaches when
he pulled up after the mile relay
grabbing his hamstring. It turned
out to be little more than a mus
cle cramp, but it reminded every
one just how quickly a great run
ner can fall victim to injury.
Speaking of injuries, junior
Ail-American 400-meter runner
Rene Rodriguez is sitting out this
season with hamstring problems

of his own, which hurts Stan
ford's chances of scoring well at
the Pac-lOs. Sophomore shotput
ter and discus thrower Pete
Swanson, who has a broken toe, is
also lost for the year.
The field event combination of

senior co-captain Dave Popejoy in
the hammer and Swanson in the
shot was a pleasantly dependable
duo in all meets thus far. Others
will have to step up to the challenge,
and this weekend's competition
should provide the perfect venue. I
