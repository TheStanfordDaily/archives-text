# If it wasn't for those pesky Bears
## Bikers in title hunt

Coming off convincing victories
at Chico State last weekend, the
Stanford cycling team heads off to
Reno, Nev., this weekend to com
pete in the second-to-last race
before the conference champi
onships.
The Cardinal moved into second
place in the West Coast Cycling
Conference (WCCC) last weekend,
inching closer to first-place Cali
fornia. Both teams are competing
for regular season points, which
will be added to their scores at the
conference races to be held at Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo on May 13
and 14.
At Reno, the team will race in
an individual time trial, a team
time trial and a criterium. The
weekend starts with the criterium
at the Reno Airport. Cyclists will
take between 20 and 45 laps
around a 0.9 mile long track with
four right turns. The following
day, the team will travel to Cold
Springs to race in the two time tri
als. The time trial, held on a nor
mal road open to traffic, is 14
miles long; cyclists must travel
back and forth on a seven-mile
long track.
"This race is going to be differ
ent than the rest because it is at
altitude," said graduate student
Megan Troxell, one of Stanford's
top cyclists.
Unlike all of their other races,
the Reno race is held in the moun
tains at a 4,500 feet elevation.
However, Reno is also the site of
the national competition in early
June, so this weekend gives the
team a chance to practice at the

high altitude.
Stanford hopes to keep its
momentum from the previous
race, in which Stanford won two
events and Stanford men's cyclists
placed first in each of the A cate
gories. However, many key cyclists
are not making the trip this week
end. Graduate student Dave Bai
ley, who set the course record last
week at Chico in the time trial, will
stay home to race in an individual
event at the Hellyer Velodrome.
Also, Stanford will be without
sophomore Ben Gieger, junior
John Schlesinger, senior Mike
Cummer and graduate student
Dan Lyons, all of whom finished
around the top of their categories
in the criterium and time trial at
Chico. With their absence, Stan
ford will need strong performances
from graduate student captain
Dario Falquier, Troxell and senior
Tracy Timms.
In addition to the team competi
tion, Falquier and Troxell will try
to accumulate points in the season
omnium, a composite of all the
points from all the events in which
the cyclists race. Both are in con
tention for the overall title this
season.
Stanford will try to attain its
eighth- and ninth-event victories
by winning the two time trials. A
team can take points from 10
events into the conference champi
onship, so the squad is racing to
get 10 victories before the season
ends. Cal has already attained
"perfection" by winning 10 events.
So, this weekend, the team
hopes to inch even closer to the top
of the conference as it looks for
ward to the bigger competitions in
the near future.
