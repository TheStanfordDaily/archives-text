# Sailors off to fight for bid to national race

The most important leg of the sailing season
begins this weekend for Stanford. Ten other
schools will join the Cardinal in the waters off
Long Beach, Calif., for the Western District
Championships. Come Sunday, Stanford hopes
to be one of two teams still remaining on the
road to the National Championships, which will
also be held at Long Beach in May.
The District Playoffs combine two regattas
into one event. The team racing competition will
take place Friday and will be followed by fleet
racing on Saturday. Team racing requires a far

greater effort for the sailors to work together
than the individually-oriented fleet racing. The
conditions will also vary between the two events:
The team races will be held in a protected bay,
making the wind less predictable and sailing
tricky, while the fleet races will be sailed outside
the bay in the ocean, making for a steadier
breeze but choppier seas.
Stanford coach Steve Bourdow believes the
bay conditions will be very similar to those at
Stanford's practice facility. The added advantage
probably isn't necessary, however.
The Cardinal team racing unit goes into the
competition as the heavy favorite. Depth distin
guishes the Cardinal from other top teams such
as California and UC-Irvine. Stanford brings
three solid boats to the table, while the other
schools usually can only offer one or two.
The preliminary competition will take place in
a round-robin format; then the pool of six
schools will be narrowed down to a final four.
The small field of competition means mistakes
will be less damaging, and the competition will
remain reasonably tight.
Senior Charles Meade will join freshman crew
Betsy Charmichael in one Stanford boat. Fresh
man skipper John Meade and sophomore crew
Megan Ireson will operate the second boat, and
freshmen Danny Zimbaldi and Heather Rodger
will handle the third. The competition allows
Bourdow to replace sailors throughout the races,
and junior Adam Lowery will be ready and wait
ing should Bourdow call him into action.
"I think our chances are very good," said
Bourdow. "If someone is having a bad day, we
can replace."
