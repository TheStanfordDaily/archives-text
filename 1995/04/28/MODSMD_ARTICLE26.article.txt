# True tales of nookie negotiation
## 
### 
My neighbor hooked up last weekend.
My sweet, studious, in-bed-by-11,
hasn't had her front-snap fumbled
over in months if ever, Episcopalian girl-next
door took a stranger to bed and made enough
noise to keep me from falling back to sleep.
Not that 1 disapprove. Nor am I entirely
surprised. She had mentioned only that after
noon that she was thinking of doing some
thing wild. Something new. Something that
would put her mom back in therapy. Some
thing that would require a lubricant.
But it only took a day — not even, a night
— for her to consummate that caprice with
hardened flesh. Within hours of the notion's
birth she had showered, shaved, sauntered
partyward, scoped a chiseled target, danced
him senseless and lured him into her single. A
six step program successfully executed.
The next morning she's washing sheets.
With the goal of mackin' in mind she dis
patched herself to that den of debauchery and
picked herself a winner. She went to that
party with intent. That's all it took.
Now I'm not that much of a hound, but
I've had my nights of impure thought. I've
secretly hoped not to walk home alone. But
never in my lascivious laps around the DKE
pool room did I suspect — certainly not expect
- to succeed. Sure it'd be nice, but a shame
less fantasy is all I'd ever consider it.
But here's my neighbor. Gentle and sweet.
A vague whim flutters through an ordinarily
reserved skull and within hours becomes a
consolidated, gooey fact; leaving me with the
obvious question: If in the handful of times I
(and the hundreds of times my male friends)
deliberately visit a party for fornicative pur
poses our egos consistently get churned into
butter, why should this first-timer's thoughts
produce action instantaneously?
Ryun ithe wants mr I have n sixth wnw about them* things

The answer is, sadly, not a matter of some
"beginner's luck," but a simple factor of gen
der. She's a girl.
No matter how often boys are accused of
having the socially defined upper hand, no
matter what your status characteristic theo
ries say about gender, it is still women who
are the allocators of action. The mighty
female remains the negotiator of nookie.
Roar.
Despite any crap about pending equality or
male-dominated societies, despite any anec
dotes of once taking some guy for coffee after
a class or a glance unsubtly chucked, it is still
the he who must make the first move. And it
is still the she who says yes or no.
And, should the decision be affirmative
and a date is set, it is only the she who knows
beforehand how far the evening will go. It is
only the she who knows whether to wear the
lucky undies. (This is not because girls are
more discriminating and boys are always will
ing to go as far as they can get. That whole bit
is an unfortunate, common, insensitive and
hypocritical misconception, although true.)
My reserved, focused, Little Mermaid
renting neighbor needed only nod yes and the
entertainment she had only vaguely enter
tained became, for her, a reality. The choice
was entirely hers.
The boy in question is, then, little more
than an instrument. A mindless beneficiary
of fortunate timing that requires no batter
ies. His was selected, fairly randomly, from a
menu of tushies. She had options in this
hunt. The kind of options only very few, very
tall, men might ever know.
But she chose. And she took. Used him and
then confidently dumped his sorry ass when
he called her two days later. No embarrass
ment or regret about it. She enjoyed what

they had done but that's about all he could
expect from her unless he should ever need to
borrow her bio notes. Go and be happy you
have a story to tell all your friends.
I'm not sure how this verification of
empowerment makes me feel. Part of me says'
that I now know what I truly want from my
senior year: to be picked out, picked up.
unabashedly used and then promptly tossed
away, never to be called again. I want her to
sit down beside me on a Coffee House couch
and say, "Listen: I don't know you, you don't
know me. But 1 think your the hottest hunk
of hooey I've laid eyes on all day. Why don't
we skip outta this spot and find something a
bit more sticky to do." And the next morning
add, "Oh sure baby, I'll call you tomorrow."
That's right, do to me what you mistakenly
say guys do all the time. Fulfill a fantasy in
your frenzied revenge for something I've
never done. Make me your meat.
But another part of my brain, one a little less
connected to the ego, whispers something
about fairness find stupidity. While gay men
are spared this ridiculously archaic tradition,
we stupid heterosexual males are stuck playing
a stupid game where the stupid girl gets to
decide everything. And before you go saying
that we'd only take advantage if we were given
the chance, consider that perhaps we disgust
ing, club-carrying, hunter-gatherer men
wouldn't abuse that power if it were not so
alien to us.
Yeah, sure we wouldn't.
