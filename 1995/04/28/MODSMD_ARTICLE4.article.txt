# Two fraternities may lose houses
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Although no official decisions
will be made until Monday at the
earliest, three fraternities have
met with University officials over
the past week to discuss the fate of
their houses.
Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Alpha
and Theta Xi all face the risk of not
having enough members to fill 90
percent of their houses following
Fraternity Rush, which could po
tentially lead to a loss of the hous
es under a policy set by the Uni
versity in February.
Officials say that any house va
cated by a fraternity will go in this
year's housing lottery.
The fraternities have all met
with Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn, Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe and
Interfraternity Council Vice Pres
ident Bud Vigil.
Although the fraternities could
receive enough bids over the week

end to satisfy the 90 percent rule,
officials say it does not look good
for the Betas and KAs.
"We were willing to make some
reasonable allowances, but the in
dication is that neither group was
close" to filling its house, Dunn
said.
The 90 percent limit is just one
criterion, although an important
one, in making the housing deci
sion. Other criteria include
whether the fraternity has a histo
ry of disciplinary problems and
how often fraternity members de
pledge.
Unlike the other two fraterni
ties, the Taxis are close enough to
the 90 percent level that they
probably will keep their house be
cause they have already satisfied
other criteria, said Taxi President
John Lach.
"We had a very successful
Rush," Lach said, pointing out
that they have between 11 and 13
people pledging.
None of the decisions, however,
has been finalized, Dunn said.
Results can only be calculated
after the hid cards come in to the
Row Office on Monday. That
means that if either the KAs or
Betas have a successful weekend
getting new members — or keep
ing current members in the house
next year — they will likely keep
their residences.
"We have not made any official
decisions," Dunn said. "We've
been trying to do everything we
can to help. It's been disappointing
to see these fraternities be unable
to recruit the number of men they
need to sustain their houses."
Both fraternities also have to
take graduation into consideration
before they know exactly how

many members they will have next
yew\
The KA house holds 52 people
and the Beta house holds 38. For
the KAs, the large size of their
house "makes a big impact," Dunn
said.
If the fraternities lose their
houses, it is still unclear whether
other fraternities or sororities will
be able to reside in the houses,
Dunn said. Zeta Psi, Kappa Kappa
Gamma and Sigma Nu have all
applied for a house this year, but
the earliest that any of them could
get a house is the fall of 1996.
The University is currently
examining its housing polity relating
to unhoused Greek organizations.
According to Howe, in the past
when a fraternity lost its house
other students were able to draw
into the house as an upperclass
residence.
The presidents of the Betas and
KAs declined to comment yester
day.
