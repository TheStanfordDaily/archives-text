## New junior faculty program announced 
### Marcus Jackson 
Stanford assistant professors
in the social sciences will soon be
able to take advantage of a new fel
lowship program designed to give
them the time and financial re
sources to prepare for tenure re
view.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven announced the
new program during his second
annual State of the School Ad
dress earlier this week.
According to Christopher
Ponce, associate dean for develop
ment in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, "The idea behind
this plan. . . is to look at the junior
faculty in the sociul sciences at the
time they come up for reappoint
ment, pick the best of those and
give them support for tenure re

view."
The new program would join
two other currently existing fel
lowship programs in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Last April, a $25 million dona
tion from Stanford alumni
William Hewlett and David
Packard created the Terman Fel
lowships program which provides
resources to science and engineer
ingjunior faculty.
That was followed last fall by a
$1 million anonymous donation
which created the Dean's Fellows
program in the humanities. The
program provides selected junior
faculty in the humanities with a
year off to prepare scholarly work
for their tenure reviews.
Closely resembling the human
ities fellowships, the new pro
p-am will provide junior faculty
in the social sciences with a
research account of $5,000 and a
year of paid leave.
"They'll receive a half-year's
salary and benefits and the other
half will be taken from sabbatical
credits that have been accrued or
borrowed," Ponce said.
"They would not have to worry
about where their salary is com
ing from during sabbatical,"
Shoven said. "They would have
no teaching obligations and no
income sacrifice."
According to Shoven, the over
riding objective is to entice
prospective faculty members.
"Our goal is to make Stanford the
best place in the country for them
to start their careers."

The School of Humanities and
Sciences is still finalizing the
issue of funding for the new pro
gram.
Because the other fellowships
were created by large donations,
Shoven said "it is a fund-raising
priority for me to find someone
who will support social scientists
in the same way."
Until then, he said, the school
will be able to fund the program
so that it won't have to be placed
on hold pending the discovery of a
donor.
Ponce said he anticipates that
the first social science fellowship
award announcements will be
made in the spring of next year
and that there would be two to
three fellows selected in any given
year. •
Shoven said he hopes that the
new fellowships "will make Stan
ford more attractive to startirig
assistant professors and give
them every chance to succeed."
