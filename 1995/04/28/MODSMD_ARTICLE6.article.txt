# Twin senators not two close for comfort

When next year's ASSU
Senate chair calls on the top
vote-getter, "Senator J. Cas
tro" will not be specific
enough.
Identical twins Joaquin and
Julian Castro not only received
the most votes for ASSU Sen
ate in last week's election; they
also each received an identical
811 votes.
In junior high school, they
held different girlfriends with
the same name. Currently
they're dating roommates.
And their Draw number two
years ago —16 —is the same as
their birthday.
Freaky? They don't think
so.
"We don't particularly sub

Julian said. "We get asked that

Back to back, twins Julian and Joaquin Castro get ready for next year's senate.
both the student and community
levels. They hope* that by working
together — not a new idea for these
two — they can obtain money to
purchase SAT manuals and create
volunteer SAT preparation work
shops in East Palo Alto.
"The ASSU does have a role in
solidifying student support to focus
attention on problems," Julian said.
"The Faculty Senate and the
administration have to listen."
The two have literally spent their
entire lives together. In fact, they
have never been separated for more
than seven weeks, when last year
Julian worked as a White House
intern while Joaquin remained at
the Castro home in San Antonio.
Three years ago, when it came
time to decide their college plans,

they realized they couldn't yet leave
each other "I thought (going to the
same college| would be really neat
and comfortable," Julian said.
Since the only two schools to
which both were admitted were UC-
Berkeley and Stanford, it was not a
hard decision. "We just weren't
ready for separation yet," Joaquin
said.
Currently, the juniors are both
double-majoring in political science
and communication. Although they
may attend separate law schools,
they fantasize of creating a Castro &
Castro law firm in San Antonio.
The only question is whose name
will come first.
Joaquin and Julian have always
been competitive, whether in aca
demics or as doubles partners in
high school tennis. "We used to yell
at each other on the court," Julian
said.
"I was always a little better in
sports," Joaquin added. "But he

always edged me out in GPA."
At Stanford, however, they have
worked together. Julian is currently
a resident assistant in Naranja, and
this year Joaquin is applying to be
an RAin that dorm. Both spent
exactly the same amount of money
in the ASSU election and each flyer
with Julian's name had Joaquin's.
And vice versa.
They have had the same class
schedule almost every quarter.
The two were members of the
Stanford Democrats last year. Cur
rently both work on Derechos, a
Chicano / Latino student group
focusing on law.
This senate campaign was the
first time either brother ran for
political office, and they said they
are unsure whether they want to
make government service a future
career.
"Maybe we'll be councilmen in
two separate city council districts at
the same time," Joaquin said.
