The Stanford College Republicans are set to
trek to Southern California today, and mem
bers hope to return Sunday with one of their
own as the area director of the California Col
lege Republicans.
More than 50 Stanford students have signed
up to attend the state College Republican con

vention, which runs this weekend at the Atri
um Marquis hotel in Irvine.
Scheduled speakers include California Gov.
Pete Wilson, who is a presidential candidate;
former U.S. Rep. Michael Huffington, a Stan
ford alumnus who lost a close race for the U.S.
Senate last November; commentator Bruce
Herschensohn; presidential candidate Alan
Keyes; and California Attorney General Dan
Lundgren.

Stanford College Republicans President
Adam Ross said the convention is the highlight
of the year and that, bv making a strong show
ing, the Stanford chapter can improve its rela
tive strength among other state chapters and
also as a student group on campus.
"We are making a strong statement. . . that
Stanford is a player in the state College Repub-
licans and really demonstrating to
people that there Ls a strong Repub
lican presence at Stanford," said
Ross, a senior.
He added that in the past, the
club's organizational structure has
been weak. Along with low student
interest, the strength of the group
has decreased, he said.
However, Ross said he is confi
dent that a strong showing at the
convention will increase the group's
prestige among college chapters and
lead to an area directorship position.
Elections for area positions are Sun
day.
"Someone in the club is going to
run for area director," he said. "We
haven't specifically decided. It's a
very good possibility that come Sun
day, the area director will be a Stan

ford student."
An added bonus for Stanford stu
dents is an all-expense paid weekend
advertised as a "Free Trip to L.A.
Steve Lesher, a candidate for
chairman of the California College
Republicans, is paying for accom
modations at the hotel — a total of
almost $700 for the Stanford dele
gation — as well as for a luxury bus
to transport the students to and
from Orange County.
However, Ross said, while Lesh
er — a junior at the University of
Southern California — is donating
his money to help more students
from Northern California attend
the convention, there is absolutely
no requirement for Stanford mem
bers to vote for him.
"Steve Lesher is generous
enough to provide us with trans
portation and lodging down in
Southern California, and for that
we're very grateful," Ross said. "But
we're not endorsing Steve Lesher

per se. It violates (Office of Student
Activities] rules for the Stanford
College Republicans to endorse any
candidate for public office."
However, USC junior Matt
Harper, lasher's campaign man
ager, said the Stanford chapter did
endorse Lesher, adding that the
candidate would probably not
have funded the delegation with
out an endorsement. But Harper
agreed that individual delegates
are under no commitment to vote
for Lesher.
"As in any free election, a get
out-the-vote campaign is exactly
what's the key to winning," Harper
said, adding that it is common for
College Republican candidates to
financially support chapters after
receiving an endorsement.
Lesher, whom Harper compared
with conservative evangelist Pat
Robertson, is supporting his cam
paign — and 20 college chapters —
with his own money.
