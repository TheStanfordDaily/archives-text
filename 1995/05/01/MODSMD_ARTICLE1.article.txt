# Crackdown on e-mail crimes
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Students trying to forge e-mail on Stanford's sys
tem should be wary — the University is cracking
down on pesky e-mail hackers.
Users forging e-mail messages could now be
brought to Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole as vio
lators of the Fundamental Standard, announced
Dennis Michael, manager of Distributed Computing
Operations.
According to Cole, e-mail forging cases will first
be brought before Steve Hansen, computer security
officer in Distributed Computing and Communica
tions Systems. However, if "the forgery was suffi
ciently serious in nature, then I believe it would be
forwarded to me for another review."
According to Michael, e-mail forging in the last
few months "has really picked up."
"It's fraud. It has always been against policy,"
Michael added.
Over the past week, the University has caught
several students forging e-mail messages, including
one who sent a message pretending to be University
President Gerhard Casper.
Steps will also be taken to prevent students from
forging if it doesn't die down, Michael said.
If people "don't start being responsible," system
administrators will install Kerboros authentication
— the most hack-proof form of computer security —
on the news server, Michael said. In order to post
messages to newsgroups, a user would have to first
enter his or her Leland password to confirm identi
ty.
University officials have not yet approved use of
this system, he said.
Last week, a student posted a message to
alt.sex. wanted from another account. The girl whose
account was used was hassled to no end by people
who saw the message, Michael said.
Even if the forging dies down, the Leland system
will install a program with digital signatures, mark
ers which verify a user's identity. This has already
been approved and should not inconvenience stu
dents, Michael said.
Presently, e-mail forging is relatively easy. For in
stance, junior Shimpei Yamashita taught the
method to students in Computer Science 197 last
Wednesday. Despite Yamashita's warnings not to
forge mail, some students in the class were caught
sending fraudulent mail. It is undecided if they will
be penalized, Yamashita said.
