Bosnia refuses extended truce
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — The
Bosnian government refused yesterday to extend a
frayed four-month truce but pledged to restrain its
army if rebel Serbs do not attack or block food aid.
The government's rejection came despite a
last-ditch effort by U.N. special envoy Yasushi
Akashi to avert the resumption of full-scale war
after the truce officially expired at noon (3 a.m.
PDT) today.
Agreeing to renew the truce would mean "we
participate in the legalization of the occupation of
our country," said Bosnian Prime Minister Haris
Silajdzic after meeting Akashi. "This is something
we shall not do."
14 escape from L.A. prison
SANTA CLARITA, Calif. (AP) — Fourteen max

imum-sccurity prisoners scaled a razor-wire fence
early yesterday and 10 — half of them murder
defendants — got away in the biggest escape from
the Los Angeles County jail system.
Housing developments near the 2,800-acre Peter
J. Pitchess Honor Rancho were placed under guard
as more than 100 sheriffs deputies and three air
craft mounted a manhunt, said Capt. Jeff Springs,
a sheriff s spokesman.
The inmates escaped a 96-man housing module
through a hole in the roof and possibly used a simul
taneous disturbance in another module as a diver
sion to make their break at 3:15 a.m., Springs said.
Deputies patrolling the perimeter spotted the
inmates going over the 20-foot fence and caught
four immediately.
The other 10 vanished into the darkness. They
included five murder defendants, two men facing
carjacking charges and three drug defendants, said
Deputy Diane Hecht.
