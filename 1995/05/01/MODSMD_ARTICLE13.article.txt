# US puts embargo on Iran

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - President
Clinton said yesterday he will end
U.S. trade and investment with
Iran, denouncing Teheran "as
inspiration and paymaster to ter
rorists" and urging Russia to scut
tle an Iranian nuclear deal.
"I am convinced that institut
ing a trade embargo with Iran is
the most effective way our nation
can help curb Iran's drive to
acquire devastating weapons and
support terrorist activities," Clin
ton said in a speech delivered last
night.
The action, which White House
officials concede could cost thou
sands of American jobs and cause a
slight short-term increase in fuel
prices, deprives U.S. companies
and their subsidiaries of the lucra
tive Iranian oil market. It also will

eliminate U.S. exports, which
totaled $326 million in 1994.
Clinton's plan was outlined in a
speech prepared for the World
Jewish Congress, an audience sen
sitive to Middle East terrorism.
Aides said Clinton will sign an
executive order later this week,
acting under the Emergency Pow
ers Act.
They said Clinton will declare
Iran's nuclear ambitions and sup
port of terrorism a threat on the
United States and Middle East
peace.
"To do nothing more as Iran
continues its pursuit of nuclear
weapons would be disastrous,"
Clinton said. "And to stand pat in
the face of overwhelming evidence
of Teheran's support for terrorists
would threaten to darken the

dawn of peace between Israel and
her neighbors."
He also singled out Iraq and
Libya as nation's that "hunger for
nuclear and other weapons of
mass destruction. Our policy
toward these rogue states is sim
ple: They must be contained."
As part of a gradual heighten
ing of Iranian sanctions, Clinton in
March killed a $1 billion oil con
tract between Conoco and Iran.
The executive order did not stop
American companies from buying
Iranian oil through foreign sub
sidiaries and selling it abroad.
Clinton said his latest order
would close that $3.5 billion loop
hole, as well as prohibit trade and
U.S. investment with Iran — clos
ing off Iran to U.S. private sector
business.
