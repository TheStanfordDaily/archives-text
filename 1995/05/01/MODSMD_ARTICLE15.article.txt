## Editorials Drop on-line Draw

FULL MOON on the Quad.
Sunday Flicks. Big Game.
Although it's only a centu
ry old, Stanford does have
unique traditions. We feel that
one of them should be brought
back.
We're talking about, of course,
the Draw. As undergraduates
should know, the annual housing
lottery has started. Just like last
year, it is being administered
over the computer network via
Axess; students have to log in
over the next two weeks to indi
cate their preferences, and draw
numbers will be assigned ran
domly.
It wasn't always this way. As
current juniors might remember,
before last year the Draw was a
far more, well, interesting pro
cess. Draw groups had to march
to a room in Tresidder, where
their chosen leaders were charged
with the mission to extract the
lowest number possible.
Students used to pull all sorts

of stunts to "prepare" for the
Draw, including wearing wacky
costumes, singing songs and par
taking in other ceremonies
before pulling out that magic
number. No more. There's just
not much you can do while sit
ting in front of a computer down
in the cluster.
Although the argument for the
on-line Draw — that it is more
efficient — is valid, a Stanford
tradition was definitely lost when
the University took the fun out of
the lottery last year. Before, you
knew your draw number as fast
as you could open the envelope;
now, students don't find out until
the end of May.
And though the Draw ritual
certainly wasn't as ingrained as
Big Game or even Full Moon on
the Quad, it was a tradition
enjoyed by students that made a
difficult experience a bit less
stressful.
Next year, Stanford should try
to bring that tradition back.
