DON'T GIVE CREDIT where
credit isn't due. So argued a
professor at the Faculty
Senate meeting on April 19. He
was referring to the debate on
whether academic credit toward
graduation should be awarded for
activity courses.
The debate began with the Com
mission on Undergraduate Educa
tion's recommendation last Octo
ber to eliminate activity course
credit altogether. A senate commit
tee later altered the recommenda
tion to keep the current limit of 12
units of credit — but changed the
rules so that only four of the units
can come from the same athletics
courses.
The senate has postponed its
vote on this matter to investigate
federal financial aid regulations; it
ought to drop the matter entirely.
Any decision to discount activity
units would gravely hurt varsity
athletes, who may become ineligi

ble for financial aid or NCAA com
petition if denied credit.
The NCAA requires athletes to
take a minimum of 12 units of
course work during the quarter in
which their sport is in season. Par
ticipation in their sport earns var
sity athletes two units per quarter;
without these units, athletes
would be forced to take more class
es to keep their full-time student
status. However, for many athletes
more classes would be impossible
to handle simply because — with
several hours of practice every day
— they don't have the time to
study for them.
Student athletes work hard to
balance rigorous academic course
loads with time-consuming sports.
They bring this university well
deserved recognition while pursu
ing the same degrees as other
undergraduates.
It would be tough to find anyone
deserving more credit.
