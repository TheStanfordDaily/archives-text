## Out-of-country experience 
### 
Breath-taking beaches, cloud
forest canopies, swinging salsa
clubs and a tour bus with the
block Stanford "S" in the front window.
We didn't exactly blend into Latin
American biodiversity and culture in
our gringo packs of camera-toting eco
tourists, but we did manage to have a
wonderful time traversing Costa Rica
during the 1995 Field Seminar.
Never did I guess that I would spend
a spring break in the tropical forests of
Costa Rica with a group of my fellow
Stanford students, professors and alum
ni. Yet this is an example of the
unknown but probable opportunities we
anticipated when we decided to come to
the Farm. And true to many experiences
at Stanford, the Field Seminar com
bined the rigors of academic study, the
camaraderie of incredible friends and
the inspiration of once-in-a-lifetime
experiences. Inevitably, during a few
moments of the trip I said "Aha!" to life.
It was in the casual conversations
there in the tropics that one of Stan
ford's greatest attributes became
apparent to me — its ability to foster
discourse between diverse human
beings. It happened in places not spec
tacular in their own right, just fortu
nate to be the happenstance settings for
honest dialogue between people.
Sometimes underneath the rain for
est canopy during a long hike. Some
times on long, winding bus rides over

typically bumpy Latin American roads.
Sometimes over Costa Rican Imperiales
late at night after the sun retired. . . .
Sometimes in a crowded double at Flo
Mo. Sometimes in White Plaza between
lecture and lunch. Sometimes over dou
ble lattes late at night in the Co Ho.
These shared reflections don't just hap
pen at Stanford, but we can take pride
that they take place so often here.
During the Field Seminar I connect
ed with three groups of Stanford people
in ways I never had before:
• My fellow students: The Field Sem
inar allowed me to talk with my Stan
ford friends about things beyond figur
ing out the marginal cost curve in Econ
51. Without the pressure of academic
deadlines, we were able to enjoy lighter
conversations and discuss academic
matters like the real-life aspects of con
servation and community development
in Latin America.
• My professors: Sometimes we have
the opportunity to get to know our pro
fessors on a personal level at offices
hours or special dinners. The Field
Seminar gave us the chance to go river
rafting, rain forest hiking and salsa
dancing (!) with our professors. It was
great to learn from them in the field
and share informal time in their compa
ny.
• Our alumni: We knew none of them
before the trip, but by the end they were
our best pals — part of the gang. It is

certainly true to say that we learned
from each other. Their experience
beyond Stanford fascinated all of us and
convinced us that there is life beyond
senior year. Our research presentations
enlightened the alums to the salient
issues of the Field Seminar.
David Chubb from Denver remarked,
"How fabulous that, for a few days in
Costa Rica, I could enjoy . . . the com
panionship of dedicated, idealistic and
fun-loving Stanford undergradu
ates. . . . And the really nice thing was
all of you acted like you enjoyed being
around us old farts, even when we
weren't buying you beer."
It has now been four weeks since we
returned from the easy-flow, tranquilo
life of Costa Rica. Even given the oppor
tunities I have ahead of me at Stanford,
I am sure the Field Seminar will remain
one of the highlights of my academic
career. I can still imagine the beach at
Corcovado, where the rain forest meets
the Pacific, and a few people from Stan
ford stand there, soaking it all in.

The 1996 Field Seminar will travel to
Peru. Anthropology Prof. John Rick
will lead the trip, focusing on the arche
ology of ancient Peru through the rise of
the Inca Empire. Undergraduate schol
arships will be available. Check for
applications in the fall.
