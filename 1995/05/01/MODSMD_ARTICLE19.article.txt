Eliminating procession removes Commencement 6 charm 9

WE READ WITH shock and disbe
lief that the Commencement pro
cession for graduating seniors
was being canceled. However much of a
"mob scene" it may be, the fact remains
that hundreds of graduating seniors look
forward to it with eagerness and excite
ment. Canceling the procession would be
tragic and would take away a large part of
the charm of Commencement. We urge
Events and Services to reconsider its deci
sion.
All of us attended the Commencement
ceremonies last year. Of course, we awaited
the procession with the greatest enthusi
asm. The Commencement speaker was
excellent, the award ceremonies were digni
fied, but it was only when the graduating
seniors waltzed into Stanford stadium on
their wacky walk that we thought, "This is
what makes Stanford special."
Director of Events and Services Lois
Wagner argues that the cancellation will
decrease the time relatives and friends
have to sit in the sun. But as Senior Class
President Kevin Harrington pointed out in
The Daily last Thursday, his grandmother
would "sit outside all day" to watch him
graduate. So would our families. One of
our favorite memories of Commencement
from last year was when we wheeled in the
grandfather of a graduating senior. He was
perspiring, even though he was in the

shade, and he was clearly uncomfortable.
But throughout the "mob scene," he was
smiling. At the end, he turned to us and
said, "Shari is graduating, and she's down
there having fun. I am so proud of her."
This is the spirit of Stanford's Commence
ment, and the procession symbolizes it
more than any other event at graduation.
Let's not destroy it.
Certainly, having the students on the
field and the parents up in the stands makes
it more difficult for them to find each other
after the ceremony. But this is part of the
fun — yelling out names, looking for famil
iar faces, bumping into more, hugging
friends on the way and celebrating the joy of
graduation from a great university.
Another supposed justification for can
celing the ceremony is that it will enable
students to sleep in or go out to breakfast
on graduation morning. If the administra
tion is so concerned about our sleep, maybe
they should consider having a real Dead
Week instead of canceling a procession we
will gladly stay up all night to make. And
we plan to go out to dinner before and after
Commencement. Missing breakfast before
graduation is not a big deal.
The Daily article on Thursday revealed
that the senior class presidents "contacted
people to see what they thought about it
(the cancellation of the procession)." Real
ty? We don't remember any such contact.

Those contacted could not have been a rep
resentative sample; no senior we have spo
ken to is happy with the decision to cancel
the procession.
Decisions on such matters are not a
matter of compromise. Kevin's comment
that "it seemed pretty clear that there was
no way things were going to be the same as
last year" is revealing. It suggests the deci
sion would have been made regardless of
the results of the senior class presidents'
"talking to folks."
It is a concern that parents and alumni
have complained about the procession, call
ing it irreverent. If, however, Stanford
were to destroy everything about it that
was irreverent, it would be eliminating a
lot of things that differentiated it from
highbrow, stiff upper-lipped schools. Also,
the parents and alumni are not graduating
— we are. Next year, we will be alumni. We
will be receiving that call for a donation.
We are talking about quite a few people
here who will not be pleased if they lose
their Commencement procession.
Commencement is an occasion for the
students graduating from Stanford to cele
brate. It is, literally, their moment in the
sun. The procession makes a statement
that is very important: For four years, we,
the Class of 1995, slaved away at pro
grams, problem sets, papers and projects.
We interned at government offices, com pa

nies and non-profit organizations. We
talked, laughed and learned together. In a
couple of hours, we will go our own sepa
rate ways — to graduate and professional
schools, to jobs in industry or elsewhere.
But this moment, this one hour in the sun,
when we can revel in our accomplishments
together as the Class of 1995, is special.
The procession demonstrates that, even
though we have graduated from one of the
finest universities in the world, we can still
have fun.
This is an important statement about
the educational atmosphere that Stanford
fosters. In our four years at Stanford, we
have watched ourselves and this place
change in many ways. We have a lot of
affection for Stanford, even as it becomes
different from what it used to be only a few
years ago. This change, however, is not for
the better. We strongly urge the Director of
Events and Services, the senior class presi
dents or whoever else in the administration
that is making the decision, to give us our
Commencement procession.
We believe we have earned it.
