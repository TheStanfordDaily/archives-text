For a moment, the Stanford baseball squad was
on top of the world.
It may not have been heaven or the Elysian
Fields, but Stanford's one-day stint at the top of the
Pacific 10 Southern Division this weekend was a
bliss the team hopes to experience again before the
regular season is over.
The Cardinal (27-20 overall, 17-10 in the Six-
Pac) took two of the three games this weekend
against Arizona (21-33, 7-22 in the Six-Pac) at
Sunken Diamond, beating the Wildcats 7-1 on Fri
day before dropping the second contest 8-6 and win
ning the rubber game 4-3.
Stanford claimed a tie for the lead in the Six-Pac
briefly after Friday's victory over Arizona. USC had
dropped its first game against California on Friday,
opening the way for the Cardinal to move up in the
standings. The ecstasy was short-lived, however;
Stanford's loss to the Wildcats on Saturday, cou
pled with USC's victory over Cal in the second game
of that series, gave the Trojans another one-game
lead in the conference race with nine games remain
ing.
"Even though [Arizona] is in last place, they are
very capable, especially offensively," said Cardinal
junior southpaw Mike Robbins (4-3), who tossed
122 pitches on Sunday en route to his second
straight complete game in Six-Pac play.
The Wildcats took a quick lead, scoring twice in
the first inning and once again in the third to go up
3-0. Stanford had only one hit under its belt
through five innings as the Cardinal offense was as
psyched and enthusiastic as the dreary, rainy Cali
fornia skies.
First baseman Troy Kent, who had an all-star
day, was the individual who finally got things start
ed for Stanford. Not only did he go 2-for-3 with one
RBI and one run scored, but his intangibles on
defense stifled what had the look of a Wildcat romp.
Kent's heroics began when he rescued the Cardi
nal from certain disaster after Arizona loaded the
bases in the sixth inning. Wildcat Colin Porter hit a
line drive down the first base line that had multiple
bases written all over it, but Kent made the stellar
diving catch to retire the side and keep the lead at
3-0.
"The play of the game is the line drive down first
base," head coach Mark Marquess said. "If that
goes down, they score three and we're out of it."
Kent returned in the bottom of the sixth to col
lect only Stanford's second hit of the game. The hit

sparked a rally, and the Cardinal cut the lead to 3-2
on a sacrifice fly from catcher A.J. Hinch and an
RBI single off the bat of third baseman Steve Carv
er. Stanford took the lead in the next inning after an
RBI single by Kent and a dropped fly ball by Wild
cat Menno Wickey sent freshman Jay Pecci home.
Robbins gave up six of the 11 hits in the first
three innings and seemed to settle down as the con
test progressed. The Cardinal bats followed that
same trend, starting sluggish but heating up in the
final four innings.
"I personally felt good today, better than I've felt
in a while," Robbins said. "I've been giving up a lot
of hits lately and can't really figure out why."
Marquess had nothing but praise to offer for his
starting pitcher, who has had the misfortune of
pitching quality games on occasions when the Car
dinal bats were in hibernation.
"[Robbins] was spectacular," Marquess said. "I
don't think he had his good stuff, and we were ane
mic with the bats in the first six innings. He could
have gotten depressed, but he hung around and fin
ished it out."
In the second game of the series, Arizona beat
the Cardinal by virtue of a seven-run eighth inning.
The Wildcats entered the top of the inning down 6-
1 after Stanford third baseman Steve Carver
knocked a three-run homer out of Sunken Diamond
in the bottom of the sixth. But Arizona blazed back,

collecting six hits and scoring all seven runs with
two outs in the eighth.
In the disastrous eighth, none of the three Car
dinal pitchers who took to the mound could stop
Arizona. Starting right-hander Todd Bartels was
replaced by sophomore righty Tom Reimers early in
the inning, and reliever J.D. Brammer came in for
Reimers after the Wildcats scored four runs. But
even Brammer couldn't put Arizona away before
three more Wildcats had crossed the plate.
The loss returned the Cardinal to the point at
which it had begun the weekend, one game behind
USC. With the season close to its end, the defeat
was ill-timed.
"Where we are right now in the season, every
game is so big. If you're not ready to play and not
excited, something is wrong with you as far as I'm
concerned," Robbins said.
Stanford was ready for the first game against
Arizona on Friday. The Cardinal's big hitters were
hot, as left fielder Cale Carter went 3-for-5 with
three RBIs, catcher A. J. Hinch scored three runs on
a 2-for-3 performance and third baseman Steve
Carver drove in three runs and hit 3-for-4.
Freshman pitcher Kyle Peterson threw 134
pitches, scattered seven hits and went the distance,
giving up only one run and striking out five. The
right-hander extended his sensational season
record to 9-1 overall and 7-0 in the Six-Pac.
