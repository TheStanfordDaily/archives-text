# Relief pitching may be the weakest link in Stanford's armor

For a brief recap of how the Stanford baseball
team's season has gone, just review the weekend
series against Arizona.
The three-game set stands as a microcosm of
the entire year for the Cardinal. Throughout the
season, Stanford's offense has relied on the hit
ting of juniors Cale Carter and A.J. Hinch and
senior Steve Carver. The trio have combined to
bat well over .350 and Hinch and Carver are the
leading the team in home runs. Also, Carver,
Hinch and Carter are 1-2-3 on the team in runs
batted in.
The Cardinal's pitching, originally deemed the
best in the nation by many publications in the
preseason, has its hopes residing in the arms of
freshman Kyle Peterson and junior Mike Rob
bins. While these five Cardinal players have
done an admirable job leading the way through
the first 44 games of the season and two of the
last three, Stanford needs others on the team to
step up. Baseball is a team sport and while five
players of their caliber form an excellent nucleus,
there are holes in the Cardinal that must be filled
quickly if Stanford hopes to recapture the Six-Pac
and surge into the NCAA Regionals.
The most pressing need of the Cardinal was
obvious during the three games against the Wild
cats. The Stanford bullpen is in disarray. During
Saturday's game, Stanford was cruising along
until the top of the eighth inning when junior
Todd Bartels tired and head coach Mark Mar
quess removed him for a relief pitcher. Marquess
called on Tom Reimers, last year's closer, to finish
the game. Reimers, after posting a 2.45 ERA with
nine saves as a freshman, has struggled all year,
sporting an ERA of 4.97 while saving no games.
In the Six-Pac, Reimers has had trouble with
his control, having walked nine in 13 1/3 innings
after issuing free passes to only 18 batters in over
62 innings last year. This appearance was no dif
ferent as he walked the first batter he faced.
Reimers got the next two batters out but bis con
trol failed him again. Normally Reimers gets
ahead in the count and uses his split finger fast
ball to induce outs but on Saturday, he was
unable to do so. Arizona rallied, saddling Reimers
