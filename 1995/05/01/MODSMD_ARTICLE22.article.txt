# Relief pitching may be the weakest link in Stanford's armor
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
For a brief recap of how the Stanford baseball
team's season has gone, just review the weekend
series against Arizona.
The three-game set stands as a microcosm of
the entire year for the Cardinal. Throughout the
season, Stanford's offense has relied on the hit
ting of juniors Cale Carter and A.J. Hinch and
senior Steve Carver. The trio have combined to
bat well over .350 and Hinch and Carver are the
leading the team in home runs. Also, Carver,
Hinch and Carter are 1-2-3 on the team in runs
batted in.
The Cardinal's pitching, originally deemed the
best in the nation by many publications in the
preseason, has its hopes residing in the arms of
freshman Kyle Peterson and junior Mike Rob
bins. While these five Cardinal players have
done an admirable job leading the way through
the first 44 games of the season and two of the
last three, Stanford needs others on the team to
step up. Baseball is a team sport and while five
players of their caliber form an excellent nucleus,
there are holes in the Cardinal that must be filled
quickly if Stanford hopes to recapture the Six-Pac
and surge into the NCAA Regionals.
The most pressing need of the Cardinal was
obvious during the three games against the Wild
cats. The Stanford bullpen is in disarray. During
Saturday's game, Stanford was cruising along
until the top of the eighth inning when junior
Todd Bartels tired and head coach Mark Mar
quess removed him for a relief pitcher. Marquess
called on Tom Reimers, last year's closer, to finish
the game. Reimers, after posting a 2.45 ERA with
nine saves as a freshman, has struggled all year,
sporting an ERA of 4.97 while saving no games.
In the Six-Pac, Reimers has had trouble with
his control, having walked nine in 13 1/3 innings
after issuing free passes to only 18 batters in over
62 innings last year. This appearance was no dif
ferent as he walked the first batter he faced.
Reimers got the next two batters out but bis con
trol failed him again. Normally Reimers gets
ahead in the count and uses his split finger fast
ball to induce outs but on Saturday, he was
unable to do so. Arizona rallied, saddling Reimers
with the blown save.
Brammer, having been suc
cessful against Cal, failed to put
out the Wildcat fire, allowing his
inherited runner and two other
Arizona batters to score.
The game was indicative of the
bullpen troubles that have
plagued the Cardinal. Reimers
struggled early causing Marquess
to go to search frantically for
someone to fill the role. Junior
Mario Iglesias pitched well early
on in the year but rapidly disap
peared as his 11.88 ERA and .405
batting average against in the Six-
Pac would attest. Robbins filled
the role for a short time, notching
a pair of saves, but injuries to
junior Dan Reed and sophomore
Jason Middlebrook made it neces
sary for Robbins to enter the
starting rotation.

Sophomore Brendan Sullivan
currently leads the team with
four saves, but he has been hit
hard in conference games. A Six-
Pac ERA of 5.59 and .381 batting
average against does not consti
tute effective relief and his trou
bles with left handed batters is a
problem.
Brammer has been effective
for the most part, but he is the
only reliever who has seen signifi
cant action in the pen with an
ERA significantly under five.
The situation has forced Mar
quess to leave in his starters
much longer than most managers
would prefer. Peterson has gone
the distance in exactly half of his
12 starts while Robbins went nine
innings in two of his last three
starts.
What this means for the duo
and Stanford in the short term
remains to be seen but the arm
problems of last year's work hors
es, Middlebrook and Reed, does
not bode well for the future.
