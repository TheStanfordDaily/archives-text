# Men's golfers to Pullman for Pacific 10 tournament
## Can they roar minus Tiger? 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
With more than just the conference title on the
line, the second-ranked Stanford men's golf team
jaunts up to Pullman, Wash, this week to compete in
the Pacific 10 Championships.
Facing a tough battle with No. 9 Arizona State, the
Cardinal looks to break away from the Sun Devils and
secure the top seeding in the upcoming NCAA West
Regional. Coming into the tournament, which runs
Monday through Wednesday, Stanford wields a slim
two-point margin. A win this week by ASU would
close the margin and put the two teams in a tie for
first place
"Everything's up for grabs," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "It doesn't matter much for national rank
ings since we're not playing Oklahoma State [cur
rently ranked No. I], but they [ASU] have a chance to
even things up."
The obstacles faced by the squad extend far beyond
their Pac-10 competitors, however. First and fore
most is the loss of their top scorer, freshman Tiger
Woods. Woods was forced to withdraw from last
weekend's U.S. Collegiate Invitational by a sore right
shoulder, the result of scarring on his rotator cuff; he
will stay behind this week.
The players have shown that despite the loss of
what some consider the top player in the country,
they can handle themselves just fine. After Woods'
unexpected departure last week during the second
round, the remaining four golfers, senior All-Ameri
cans Notah Begay, Steve Burdick, Casey Martin and
William Yanagisawa, pulled it together to come from
behind and finish in first place, with Martin taking
top individual honors.
"Those seniors really showed how strong they
are," Goodwin said. "Not that they don't usually look
strong (they almost always do), but when the heat
was on and they were playing four count four, they
finished great, absolutely great."
Goodwin draws Woods' replacement from a talent
ed pool of junior varsity players, many of whom would
be starting at other schools. Making his second
appearance with the traveling team this year is senior
Jerry Chang, who will play as the fifth man. Sopho
more Conrad Ray, who saw action earlier in the year
at tournaments in Albuquerque, N.M. and Japan, will
also accompany the team as an alternate.
Regardless of whether the squad comes to the table
at full strength, it must still contend with perhaps its
