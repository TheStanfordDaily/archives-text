# Men third, women fifth for tracksters in Fresno
## 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
This past weekend the Stanford
track and field team took off in two
distinctly different directions. A small
group of mostly distance runners flew
off to Philadelphia to compete in the
101st Penn Relays, while the rest
headed to Fresno for the Califor
nia / Nevada State Championships.
For many teams, such as last year's

national champion Arkansas, the
Penn Relays is the largest meet of the
season before the NCAA champi
onships.
"If an athlete can't get fired up for
the Penn Relays, you probably have a
problem getting him motivated for any
track meet," said Arkansas men's
coach John McDonnell.
Against the nation's best middle
distance teams, the women's dis
tance medley relay got motivated,
finishing fourth in 11 minutes
22.23 seconds behind perennial
powerhouses Villanova, George
town and Wake Forest. Friday, the
women's 6,000 meter relay team
finished sixth in 18:07.08 just one
second behind Dartmouth.
On Saturday, yet another sunny
day in Philadelphia, 46,810 people
crowded Franklin Field for the
largest attendance ever at a sport
ing event at the University of Penn
sylvania. In the collegiate hammer
throw , senior co-captain Dave
Popejoy enjoyed the large turnout
to finish third with a strong throw
of 225 feet and eight inches behind
Georgetown's Kevin McMahon and
St. John's Roman Linscheid.
While the elite group raced
against national competition on the
East Coast, the bulk of the team
splashed through the wet weather
of the West Coast at the California /
Nevada State Championships at
Fresno City College. The weather
was worse, the crowds smaller, and
the competition much more local at
Ratcliffe Stadium.
Local Fresno State won the meet
the championships this weekend.
The Stanford men finished third
with 93 points behind the Bulldogs
and Cal's Golden Bears. The

women, competing without their
strong distance core, finished fifth
with 47 points well behind UCLA
and Cal who finished one-two.
The men's throwers continued
to excel as senior Toby Norwood
and freshman Adam Connolly took
the top two spots in the hammer
throw. Junior Jimmie Johnson
blazed through the preliminaries
of the 200-meters to hold the sec
ond fastest qualifying time to the
finals. The difference between Cal
State-Los Angeles's Barry Smith
and Johnson required a look at the
photo â€” Smith edged Johnson by
0.01 seconds for first place in the
final.
In the 3,000-meter steeplechase,
sophomore Bryan Zmijewski took
first place by seven seconds with a
time 0f9:04.63. Senior Erik Spayde
nipped Cal's Craig Magness to take
second in the 1,500-meters in
3:48.78 behind Fresno State's All-
American miler Kipp Ortenburger.
Freshman Ryan McCalmon took
fourth place in 3:49.78.
For the women, sophomore
Leila Burr ran the fastest prelimi
nary time in the 1500-meters on
Saturday. In Sunday's final, Bun
took third in 4:36.99 behind Cal's
Lisa Lopez and Cal State-L.A.'s
Marisa Avendano. In the field
freshman Sami-Jo Small contin
ued to perform well in the javelin
with a 146-3 throw good enough
for second place. Senior Florence
Adu triple jumped 39-11 1/4 for a
third place finish.
