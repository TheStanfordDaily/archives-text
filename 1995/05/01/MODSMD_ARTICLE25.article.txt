The Stanford softball team
can summarize its perfor
mance this season with the
words "Sometimes you're the
Louisville Slugger, sometimes
you're the ball."
After winning four consec
utive games and demolishing
the College of Notre Dame 25-
1 on Wednesday, Stanford (14-
32 overall, 1-21 in the Pacific
10 Conference) continued its
up-and-down play by dropping
four games in two doublehead
ers to Oregon and UCLA over
the weekend.
Yesterday's matchup pitted
the Cardinal against the No. 1
ranked Bruins. On a dreary,
rainy day at El Camino Field,
Stanford proved that it can
hang around with the best

Through the first three innings of
game one, neither team was able
to score a run.
UCLA finally broke through
with four runs in the top of the
fourth. Jennifer Brundage started
the rally with a one-out single to
left. She advanced to second on a
wild pitch and sophomore Angela
Webb then walked Tanya Hard
ing. A sacrifice moved both run
ners into scoring position. After
another walk loaded the bases,
Bruin left fielder Jenny Brewster
singled to center on a 3-1 count to
drive in two runs. The next batter,
catcher Cindy Valero, smacked a
triple over Beattie's head in right,
scoring Odom and Brewster.
Stanford came right back in
the home half of the fourth, as
junior left fielder Amanda Rente
ria continued her recent hot-hit
ting with a single to center. Two
more singles loaded the bases. A
groundout by Katie Beattie
scored Renteria with Stanford's
only run of the game.
"They make it tough by being
so solid defensively," Pearce said.
"They make you work extremely
hard for every single run."
By the top of the fifth, Webb
was showing signs of fatigue, as
the control problems that cost her

dearly in the fourth returned.
Brundage, first baseman Alleah
Poulson and Brewster singled in
runs to make it 7-1. A bases-load
ed walk to Valero increased the
margin to 8-1 before Webb finally
retired the side.
"Angela pitched a beautiful
ball game," Pearce said. "Those
guys [from UCLAJ are going to
get hits when they see you
enough times, and we played two
games against them just two
weeks ago and she pitched both
games."
In the top of the sixth, UCLA
added three more runs to bring
the final margin to 11-1.
Brundage smacked a long home
run to left, a solo shot, and Brew
ster tripled off the wall in left to
drive in two more.
"The two Jennifers killed us,"
Pearce said. "We just couldn't
seem to get them out. They're
great hitters."
The Cardinal dropped the sec
ond game by an identical margin.
With the two wins, UCLA
improved to 38-4 overall, 18-2 in
the Pac-10.
Against Oregon on Saturday,
Stanford improved dramatically
on the offensive front. In two
games at Oregon over spring
break, the Cardinal scored a total
of one run. On Saturday, Stan
ford scored twice in each game.
Despite the increased production,
Oregon took the first game 7-2
and won the second game 5-2.
