# Honor code survey to be discussed
## At Casper's request, SCLC takes on revision as first task of the year 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council will meet on May 17 to discuss the
results of last spring's Honor Code survey,
the council decided last week in its first
meeting of the academic year.
The SCLC — an annually appointed
council composed of six chosen faculty
members, five students, the ASSU Senate
Chair and a member of the Council of
Presidents — was charged early last year
by University President Gerhard Casper
with the task of evaluating the survey,
conducted by the Judicial Affairs Office.
According to SCLC member Derek
Miyahara, the council is looking to draft a
comprehensive report that will evaluate
the Honor Code's future status.
The Honor Code, a 73-year-old docu
ment, says that students, individually

and collectively, will not "give or receive
aid in examinations" or in-class work. It
also holds students to the standard of tak
ing "an active part in seeing to it that oth
ers . . . uphold the spirit and letter of the
Honor Code."

Only 1 percent of the respon
dents said they felt the code
should be abolished.

The results of Stanford's survey were
distributed to SCLC members, who, ac
cording to Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, will be reviewing the data as prepa
ration for the May 17 meeting.
The results of the poll — released pub
licly last October — indicate that nearly
90 percent of the undergraduate popula
tion supports the basic tenets of the code.

Fifty-five percent of the survey's re
spondents said they strongly believe in the
Honor Code, while 35 percent believe "it is
a good idea." Only 1 percent of the respon
dents said they felt the code should be
abolished.
In spite of such high approval, howev
er, three widely publicized cheating inci
dents that occurred in March 1993 have
called into question the extent to which
students take the Honor Code seriously.
The survey's results indicate that
unauthorized collaboration on assign
ments occurs more than twice as often
among undergraduates today as it did 18
years ago.
In addition to reviewing Stanford's
survey, members will discuss a survey re
cently conducted at MIT as a comparative
basis for evaluating the effectiveness and
popularity of Stanford's Honor Code,
Miyahara said.
