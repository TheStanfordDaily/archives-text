## New committee charts its course 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Members recently named to a commit
tee to design the curriculum for a proposed
Asian-American Studies major hope to
channel their diverse academic and ethnic
backgrounds into a successful program.
Five professors and two students were
named late last week to the committee,
which will formulate one part of the new
program in Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity proposed by Humanities and
Sciences Dean John Shoven in Februaiy.
The program calls for majors in Chicano
Studies, Asian-American Studies and
African and Afro-American Studies, as well
as a variety of degree programs that con

David Palumbo-Liu was brought to Stan

next fall.

from different angles
with respect to the pro
gram," she said. "I really
want to have input and
try to work with those
communities."
Most important, No
mura said, is "not to lose
sight of what everyone
else's position is and
what people have to lose
or have to gain."

Siu said she can bring yet another per
spective, having completed an ethnic stud
ies program at another university.
A second-year doctoral student, Siu
earned her undergraduate degree in an
thropology from UC-Berkeley, with a
minor in ethnic studies, an experience she
said has given her "a critical perspective to
analyze various issues and ideological posi
tions.
"I have the advantage of understanding
what ethnic studies and Asian-American
Studies is about," she said. "I also have a
