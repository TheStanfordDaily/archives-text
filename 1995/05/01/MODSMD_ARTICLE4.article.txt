# Asian-American Studies takes off
## New committee charts its course 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Members recently named to a commit
tee to design the curriculum for a proposed
Asian-American Studies major hope to
channel their diverse academic and ethnic
backgrounds into a successful program.
Five professors and two students were
named late last week to the committee,
which will formulate one part of the new
program in Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity proposed by Humanities and
Sciences Dean John Shoven in Februaiy.
The program calls for majors in Chicano
Studies, Asian-American Studies and
African and Afro-American Studies, as well
as a variety of degree programs that con
centrate on comparative ethnic studies.
History Prof. Gordon Chang — who
along with Comparative Literature Prof.
David Palumbo-Liu was brought to Stan
ford in 1990 to teach Asian-American
Studies — will chair the committee.
Palumbo-Liu will also serve on the com
mittee, along with Religious Studies Prof.
Rudy Busto, Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy and Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako.
Junior Liane Nomura and anthropolo
gy graduate student Lok Siu are student
representatives to the committee.
The committee has not yet received its
specific charge from Shoven, said Chang,
who has taught Asian-American Studies

at several universities. The committee
hopes to meet for the first time next week
and aims to produce a report by the end of
next fall.
For the ethnic studies program to suc
ceed, Stanford's various ethnic groups will
need to work together, Nomura said. "All
of the different communities are coming

from different angles
with respect to the pro
gram," she said. "I really
want to have input and
try to work with those
communities."
Most important, No
mura said, is "not to lose
sight of what everyone
else's position is and
what people have to lose
or have to gain."

Siu said she can bring yet another per
spective, having completed an ethnic stud
ies program at another university.
A second-year doctoral student, Siu
earned her undergraduate degree in an
thropology from UC-Berkeley, with a
minor in ethnic studies, an experience she
said has given her "a critical perspective to
analyze various issues and ideological posi
tions.
"I have the advantage of understanding
what ethnic studies and Asian-American
Studies is about," she said. "I also have a


Chang
critical perspective on what needs
to be done to make it better."
Palumbo-Liu, who has worked
in the field of Asian-American
Studies since 1978, said he and
Chang have "both learned what
things to do and what not to do" in
an ethnic studies program.
Several professors involved
with the committee have also
researched Asian issues on an
international level. Abernethy said
his investigations of colonialism in
Asia and Africa will add to the
development of the international
aspect of the ethnic studies pro
gram, one focus of Shoven's pro
posal.
"I feel it's very important to
study race and ethnic relations
comparatively," Abernethy said.
"I'm interested in seeing that we
have a broad and inclusive curricu
lum."
Members of the committee said
Shoven's proposal is a good start
ing point for an Asian-American
Studies program that, with enough

support, can be very successful.
"We all wish there were more
resources that could be put at our
disposal," Palumbo-Liu said.
But, Abernethy said, "we
already have a very strong program
in | East] Asian studies... which at
some point one hopes could be
linked with the specific study of
Asian-American life."
Along with resources, commu
nication with students will be
essential throughout the process,
committee members said.
"We need to find ways to reach
out to all the different sectors of
the Stanford community," Chang
said. "We think this is a program
that should be of importance not
just for Asian Americans but for
many at Stanford."
"One of the most important
things that I want to bring to the
committee is a continued rigorous
discussion with students here on
campus," Siu said.
"I think there's a lot of poten
tial," Siu said. "I know that there's
a lot of work to be done as we 11....
I think it's going to be a long strug
gle and we need to stay vigilant and
critical of ourselves and what we're
bringing to Stanford."
