## Several renovations planned for Stern 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
As students begin entering their pref
erences for the housing lottery, they
might think twice about how they rank
Stern Hall.
The building, along with four Row
houses and several apartments in Escon
dido Village, will be renovated and re
modeled under the Capital Improvement
Program — a 10-year project to "reno
vate older residences and bring them up
to the standards of new dorms," said
Rodger Whitney, associate director of
Housing and Dining Services.
According to Whitney, students will
appreciate many of the planned changes
in Stern and other student residences.
Among the improvements will be
wiring for in-room connections, which
will be in every facility on campus within
the next five years. In addition, current
furniture will be replaced with newer,
modular wooden pieces and individual
rooms will feature padded computer
chairs.
Stern will also become "lighter and
brighter," Whitney said. "Contempo
rary" lights, along with light sensors for
energy efficiency, will be added to every
residence this year.
The biggest changes planned for
Stern, however, are in its external archi
tecture. The dormitory will be land-
scaped, repainted and carpeted,
and grass will grow again in Stern
courtyards. In addition, the Stern
entryway will be redesigned so it
has an entrance, complete with
office, on the west side. North and
south Stern, which exist as sepa
rate entities, will be linked.
"We struggled with what to do
with Stern architecturally," Whit
ney said. Although Stern has a
"post-modern*' style, "as we look
at it today, [it is] like a factory," he
added.
"We want to finish Stern in a
way in the '90s that builds on a
style of 1948. ... It's not a radical
overhaul, but things students will
appreciate," he said.
The basement of Stern will also
be cleaned up to allow for more
dorm activities and study areas.
Part of the new and improved
Stern will be better accessibility
for students with disabilities. "We
intend to go beyond the letter of

the law," Whitney said, referring
to the Americans with Disabilities
Act. As a result, three dorms in
Stern — Larkin, Twain and Casa
Zapata — will be fully accessible at
the first floor level, Whitney said.
Resident fellows will also be
pleased with the new and
improved Stern. The RF apart
ments will be transformed into
two- or three-floor townhouses.
The new RF townhouses will
cause the loss of one student space
in each Stern dorm, for a total of
six spaces. The lost rooms will be
made up through more efficient
use of space in Row houses.
The remodeling of Stern and
other student residences marks
the third year of the Capital
Improvement Program, designed
to remodel one large dorm, four
Row houses and several Escondido
apartments every year. In the pro
gram's first two years, the Univer
sity renovated Wilbur and Flo
rence Moore Halls and a number of
Row Houses and apartments.
The four Row houses being reno
vated this summer are Grove-May
field, Haus Mitteleuropa, Sigma

Alpha Ep6ilon and Slavianskii Dom.
Much of the work will take the
form of deferred maintenance, such
as installing better plumbing, elec
tricity and fire sprinklers. Stern, for
example, needs a new roof and fire
sprinklers. However, Whitney
added that "we need to rejuvenate
in every sense of the word."
This year, work on the resi
dences will begin in the middle of
June and is expected to be com
pleted by mid-September, Whitney
said. It is an "extremely tight plan
ning and implementation pro
gram," he added.
All told, the Capital Improve
ment Program this year will cost
about $15 million to $16 million.
Whitney said students should not
feel the prices, other them a 1 per
cent room-rate increase.
The program does not end with
Stern. Toyon Hall will be remod
eled next year, followed by Laguni
ta Court and Branner Hall. Whit
ney dismissed the idea that more
venerable dorms will undergo
drastic changes, saying that "in
the older buildings [we are] not
doing anything but preservation."
