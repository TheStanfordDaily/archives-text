# Draw system gets a number of changes
## 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
This year's undergraduate hous
ing lottery features some minor
changes from previous years, includ
ing the elimination of Draw numbers
from 3,500 to 5,000.
According to Manager of Housing
Assignment Services Bill Georges,
the range of random numbers as
signed to housing applications has
changed and now consists of three
pools of numbers: 1 to 2,000 for
guaranteed / preferred applications,
2,001 to 3,000 for guaranteed / not
preferred applications and 3,001 to
3,500 for unguaranteed applica
tions.
In previous years, there were only
two pools of applications: 1 to 3,000
for guaranteed / preferred applica
tions and 3,001 to 5,000 for unguar
anteed and guaranteed / not pre
ferred applications.
Georges said the main reason for
this change was to consolidate Draw
numbers, thereby eliminating
student confusion about what the
number actually means.
"A lot of numbers were never
drawn in previous years ... only
about half were drawn," Georges
said. "By having fewer numbers,
it will make it easier for students
to understand their position rela
tive to other students in the
Draw."
Georges said that in previous
years students were often con
fused about the 3,001 to 5,000
pool, which encompassed both
unguaranteed and guaran
teed / not preferred applications.
Under the old numbering sys
tem, a guaranteed / not preferred
student who drew 5,000 was

assigned to housing before an
unguaranteed student who drew
3,001 — even though the
unguaranteed student's number
was better,
"This was confusing for a lot of
students so we decided to separate
the pools into guaranteed / not
preferred and unguaranteed,
Georges said. "The new number
ing system makes it clearer that
unguaranteed applications have
the lowest priority for housing."
Georges said the new number
ing system will not affect students
who decide where to live based on
last year's cut-off numbers.
"We always tell students that
the cut-off numbers change every
year," Georges said. "It is best to
use those numbers to tell you the
relative popularity of certain resi
dences."
Georges added that the pro
gression of the 10-year Capital

Improvement Program should
also affect Draw numbers this
year. Stern Hall, Grove-Mayfield,
Haus Mitteleuropa, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and Slavianskii Dom will
all be renovated this summer.
Synergy will have an elevator
installed.
"The popularity of the resi
dences is leveling out because
there are not the extremes of real
ly run-down dorms to really nice
ones," Georges said.
Open houses and information
al meetings will run Monday
through Thursday. Students have
until May 14 to submit their
housing applications through
Axess.
Draw results will be
announced May 28 on Axess and
will no longer be posted at Hous
ing Assignment Services or at
local residences offices as they
have been in previous years.
