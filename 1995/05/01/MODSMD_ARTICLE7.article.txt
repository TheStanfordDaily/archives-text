# Remembering Vietnam
## Panel reflects on war 20 years after its end 
### Sonia M. Giordani 
Vietnamese immigrants and
Vietnam War veterans came to
gether in an emotionally-charged
panel discussion Friday night to
reflect on the 20th anniversary of
the fall of South Vietnam — a wa
tershed that lives on in the hearts
of both Vietnamese and Ameri
cans today.
"For those of us on either side,
there will never be a time when we
can completely forget the pain and
suffering," said veteran Robert
Chastain, a 44-year-old entrepre
neur and first-year Stanford law
student.
The panel was the final event of
the Stanford Vietnamese Associa
tion's three-day commemorative
series — entitled "Vietnam: 20

Years After the Fall" — discussing
the implications of the North Viet
namese takeover of Saigon on
April 30, 1975, which brought to
an end the long and confusing
war.
"I was scared of the Viet Cong,
of the communists, but I was also
scared of the Americans — they
dropped bombs," recalled panelist
David Anh, a teaching assistant at
UC-Berkeley, who was crippled at
the age of 13 when a bomb was
dropped on his village.
Like fellow Vietnamese pan
elists Quang Phung, Luan
Nguyen and Canh Viet Le, Anh
immigrated to the United States
in the aftermath of the war.
