## Panel reflects on war 20 years after its end 
### Sonia M. Giordani 
Vietnamese immigrants and
Vietnam War veterans came to
gether in an emotionally-charged
panel discussion Friday night to
reflect on the 20th anniversary of
the fall of South Vietnam — a wa
tershed that lives on in the hearts
of both Vietnamese and Ameri
cans today.
"For those of us on either side,
there will never be a time when we
can completely forget the pain and
suffering," said veteran Robert
Chastain, a 44-year-old entrepre
neur and first-year Stanford law
student.
The panel was the final event of
the Stanford Vietnamese Associa
tion's three-day commemorative
series — entitled "Vietnam: 20

Years After the Fall" — discussing
the implications of the North Viet
namese takeover of Saigon on
April 30, 1975, which brought to
an end the long and confusing
war.
"I was scared of the Viet Cong,
of the communists, but I was also
scared of the Americans — they
dropped bombs," recalled panelist
David Anh, a teaching assistant at
UC-Berkeley, who was crippled at
the age of 13 when a bomb was
dropped on his village.
Like fellow Vietnamese pan
elists Quang Phung, Luan
Nguyen and Canh Viet Le, Anh
immigrated to the United States
in the aftermath of the war.
Phung, 35, an electrical engineer
in Berkeley, described the seven
years he lived under the newly
installed Communist government
in South Vietnam.
"Before 1975, I didn't worry
about how to fill up my stomach,"
said Phung. "After 1975, every
body had to worry, everything was
scarce. We didn't know why."
Phung also described the efforts
made to flee South Vietnam follow
ing the war. "Many people tried to
escape," he said. "I'm just a very

lucky guy to make it to the United
States."
Audience member Huy Mai, a
Stanford sophomore, shared his
family's experience. Though Mai's
father was sent to a re-education
camp at the end of the war, Mai
remembers the deaths of many
close relatives.
"Wasn't it a blessing that the
war was finally over?" he asked.
Panelist Le, an entrepreneur
whose family managed to escape
shortly after the American with
drawal from Vietnam, said recent
trips to his native land convinced
him that communism's triumph
did not put an end to the people's

suffering.
"Even though they weren't
dying by the millions in war, they
died by the thousands in re-educa
tion camps," he said.
Two American veterans of the
war spoke of the lingering memo
ries of their service in Vietnam,
recalling both the exotic beauty of
the Vietnamese countryside and
the chilling violence of battles.
The fall of Saigon left Chastain
feeling "as if all the deaths on both
sides, all the destruction, was
worthless."
"We were fighting to stay alive,"
said David Arocha, currently the
admissions supervisor at Fre

mont's Ohlone College. "We were
only thinking of surviving our 13
months and getting home."
"I'm still confused," said Chas
tain. "It seemed so clear when I
was 18. I volunteered — I wasn't
drafted. I really did think I was
doing something patriotic. Now I
realize that the North Vietnamese
were doing their duty."
Although 20 years have passed
since his release from service,
Chastain noted that such memo
ries do not fade.
"The impact is still with me
today. The pain stays with me, the
remembrances stay with me," he
said.
