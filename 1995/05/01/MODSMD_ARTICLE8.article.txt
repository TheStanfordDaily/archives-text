### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Speakers at Saturday's You Can Make A Differ
ence Conference emphasized the national and far
reaching importance of focusing on the needs of
American children.
Despite the inclement weather, more than 150
Stanford students, faculty and community mem
bers participated in the day-long conference, which
included workshops devoted to possible solutions to
the problems that face children growing up in an in
creasingly hostile social environment.
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds opened the conference by emphasizing
that children in the United States are living in a cri
sis situation
"The [American] Dream is no longer. Can we st ill
turn the situation around? This is what will be dis
cussed today," Edmonds said. "Our goal is progress

and to be a positive influence....
While we must be realistic, we
must accept the challenges."
Stanford alumnus James Stey
er, founder of the Children NOW
advocacy group, said that while
there has been progress on the
issues of child welfare, a great deal

still needs to be done.
"Our work is cut out for us,"
said Steyer. "Seeds of hope and
change have been planted. Five
years ago we could not get many
people to focus on the issue. Now
everyone from Newt [Gingrich] to
Clinton talks about child welfare
... but who will lead the way?"
Closing keynote speaker Joseph
P. Marshall Jr., co-founder of the
Omega Boys Club of San Francis
co, said the magnitude of problems

surrounding child welfare is not an
excuse for doing nothing.
"I know you can make a differ
ence," said Marshall. "The ques
tion is, are you willing to make it?"
Marshall said there are three
things he would like done that
would immediately benefit inner
city youngsters and prevent them
from falling into the trap of gangs
and drug addiction.
Job opportunities and commu
nity involvement are one solution,

but he added that guns on the
street remain a problem.
"Kids today have access to fire
power unimagined when I was a
kid," Marshall said.
In addition, the lack of commu
nity involvement has allowed the
spread of crack cocaine — a "perni
cious drug that destroys anything
it touches," he said.
Junior Berkeley Young, one of
the conference's coordinators, said
she felt the day went well.
