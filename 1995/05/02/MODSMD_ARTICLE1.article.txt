# Looking forward
## Chicano Studies is under construction 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Working from a basic outline
for a new ethnic studies major,
members of the Chicano Studies
curriculum committee will meet
for the first time next week to
begin developing a comprehensive
curriculum in the field.
"I look forward to some hard
work — but some very fruitful
work — to institutionalize the ex
amination of a broad set of issues
that has very often been minimal
ly represented in traditional disci
plines," said member Luis Fraga,
a political science professor and
director of the Stanford Center
for Chicano Research.
The new curriculum will be
part of the program in Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
proposed by Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven in Feb
ruary in response to a student
hunger strike last spring.
The ethnic studies program
will also offer majors in Asian-
American Studies, African and
Afro-American Studies and a vari
ety of comparative aspects of race
and ethnicity, such as economic
racism and relations between two
ethnic minorities.
An Asian-American Studies
curriculum committee was also
named last week. Stanford has
had an independent program in
African and Afro-American Stud
ies for 25 years.
