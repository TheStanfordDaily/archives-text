# Looking forward
## Chicano Studies is under construction 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Working from a basic outline
for a new ethnic studies major,
members of the Chicano Studies
curriculum committee will meet
for the first time next week to
begin developing a comprehensive
curriculum in the field.
"I look forward to some hard
work — but some very fruitful
work — to institutionalize the ex
amination of a broad set of issues
that has very often been minimal
ly represented in traditional disci
plines," said member Luis Fraga,
a political science professor and
director of the Stanford Center
for Chicano Research.
The new curriculum will be
part of the program in Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
proposed by Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven in Feb
ruary in response to a student
hunger strike last spring.
The ethnic studies program
will also offer majors in Asian-
American Studies, African and
Afro-American Studies and a vari
ety of comparative aspects of race
and ethnicity, such as economic
racism and relations between two
ethnic minorities.
An Asian-American Studies
curriculum committee was also
named last week. Stanford has
had an independent program in
African and Afro-American Stud
ies for 25 years.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo,
Anthropology Prof. Renato Ros
aldo, Spanish Prof. Guadalupe
Valdes and freshman Cecilia Balli
join Spanish Prof. Yvonne
Yarbro-Bejarano, the commit
tee's chair, and Fraga to form the
committee.
They plan to present a prelim
inary curriculum to the Faculty
Senate for final approval by the
end of fall quarter. Students may
be able to declare a major in
Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity as early as winter
quarter.
A second student position has
not yet been officially filled.
Camarillo and Rosaldo each
have more than 20 years of expe
rience in the field of Chicano
Studies. Also a former dean of
undergraduate studies at Stan
ford, Camarillo said he brings
his experience and"the larger
University curriculum for
undergraduates to bear on the
topic."
Balli said she hopes to take on
the planning of a Chicano Studies
curriculum from the students'
perspective. Already planning to
major in the new comparative
msyor, Balli said she represents
the student body.
"I'm interested in being a link
between the Chicano community
and this academic program at the
University level," Balli said. "I
obviously have a very personal
interest, too. I'm excited about

being able to have an input on my
own nwyor.
"I've heard what the students
want out of this program," Balli
said, "and I think that's just as
important as what the faculty
and administration want out of
this program."
Balli said she also plans to sur
vey graduate schools about their
reaction to the ethnic studies pro
gram "to make sure that when
students graduate with this
major on their diploma they have
a chance to further their educa
tion."
Committee members were
excited about the emphasis
Shoven's proposal places on the
comparative aspects of ethnic
studies.
"I think it's a wonderful idea,"
Camarillo said. "I think it's inno
vative."
The comparative focus is "the
future of ethnic studies in this
country," said Camarillo, who
concentrates on comparative eth
nic studies in his own work.
Shoven's proposal "allows for
a lot of work to be done by these
curriculum committees," Balli
said.
But the proposal is open and
"it's been interpreted in many
different ways," she added. "Peo
ple are assuming all different
things about it already."
"It's very clear that there are
many details that need to be
worked out," Fraga said. "And
these details can be worked out in
a way that will receive the sup
port of an overwhelming majority
of the members of the Faculty
Senate."
