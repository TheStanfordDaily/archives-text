Nuclear negotiations
WASHINGTON (AP) — North Korea notified
the United States today it is ready to resume
negotiations on its nuclear reactor program after
a 10-day suspension.
North Korea, which had refused to accept
South Korean-model lightwater reactors to
replace a shutdown gas graphite reactor, attached
no conditions in its note, State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
The talks collapsed in Berlin on April 20 over
North Korean objections to the South Korean
model.
However, the experimental reactor remained
shut down. It had been suspected by American
analysts of producing plutonium for nuclear
weapons.
The U.S. and North Korea agreed last October
to replace the reactor.

Prisoners get visitors
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Two American
women had a tearful reunion with their husbands
in a maximum security prison near Baghdad and
said they hoped the men would soon be released.
"I cannot begin to say how good it was to see
my husband, and I know that Kathy feels the
same way," Linda Barloon told CNN after she and
Kathy Daliberti were allowed into the Abu Ghraib
prison on Sunday.
Before the visit, William Barloon, 39, and
David Daliberti, 41, had had no link to the outside
world in two weeks.
The men were arrested March 13 after crossing
into Iraq from Kuwait. On March 25, they were
sentenced to eight years in prison for entering the
country illegally. The men, employees of U.S.
defense contractors in Kuwait, say they crossed
the border inadvertently.
