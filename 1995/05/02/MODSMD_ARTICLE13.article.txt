# Search for bomb's survivors ends

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -
The FBI released yet another
sketch of the elusive John Doe 2
yesterday as agents chased clues in
Arizona, Oklahoma and a Kansas
lake where the Oklahoma City
bomb may have been mixed.
Outside the shaky ruins of thd
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Build
ing, officials acknowledged the
inevitable: It is time to give up the
search for signs of life and switch
to heavy machinery to remove
bodies.
"I think they need to do what
ever is necessary to ensure the
safety of the rescue workers," said
Jim Texter, whose wife, Victoria,
was still missing. "Nobody wants
to be responsible for more hurt."
The death toll reached 137,
including 15 children. About 50
people were missing.

FBI agents also sought as "wit
nesses" two men who in recent
months stayed at a cheap Arizona
motel near one used by bombing
suspect Timothy McVeigh. The
two men may also have spent the
night of the bombing in a motel
180 miles from Oklahoma City.
Outside Junction City, Kan.,
where the Ryder truck that carried
the bomb was rented, agents
searched the woods and sent
divers into Geary State Fishing
Lake looking for evidence that
materials for the bomb were mixed
nearby and that tools and equip
ment used in the mixing were
thrown into the water.
The search was prompted by
witness reports of a Ryder truck at
the site after April 17, the day
McVeigh allegedly rented his
Ryder truck, said a senior federal

official in Washington, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
Investigators have found a
receipt for one ton of ammonium
nitrate in a search of Terry
Nichols' house in Herington, Kan.,
the Washington official said. The
receipt bore McVeigh's finger
print, the official said.
The receipt could establish a
link between the bombing and
Nichols, a friend of McVeigh's now
being held as a material witness.
Meanwhile, the FBI hoped a
third sketch of John Doe 2 — the
man who was with McVeigh when
he allegedly rented the truck —
might bring new leads. In the new,
profile view, the suspect appears
stocky and wears a baseball cap.
He is very tan and muscular and
may be a weightlifter, FBI agent
Weldon Kennedy said.
