## Editorials Aiding junior profs 
### 
LAST WEEK, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences
John Shcven announced the
creation of a new fellowship pro
gram designed to attract and
retain junior faculty in the social
sciences.
Similar to existing programs
that focus on the sciences and
humanities, this program's fellow
ships would be given to two or
three junior faculty members each
year
The recipients would be allowed
to take a paid year sabbatical to
prepare for the review they must
undergo in order to become
tenured professors; they would
also be provided with a research
account of $5,000.
Although Stanford has always
attracted great professors, it's nice
to see that the University is trying
to do more to recruit top scholars
early on and encourage them to
stay here throughout their
careers. By giving young faculty
some of the perks normally

enjoyed only by their tenured
peers, Stanford is saying that it
appreciates their work â€” and real
ly wants to keep them around.
It's also nice to see that the
social sciences are finally getting
the same attention given other
sections of the University. (Last
April alumni William Hewlett and
David Packard donated $25 mil
lion to fund engineering / science
fellowships, and the Dean's Fel
lows program in the humanities
was started up in the fall.)
In short, this program's goals
makes it worthy of its relatively
small cost by demonstrating the
University's commitment to its
junior faculty, and by extension,
its future.
With top-ranked departments
in political science, economics and
psychology, Stanford might be
tempted to rest on its august lau
rels. But it is the University's con
tinuous efforts to improve its aca
demics that keeps it ahead of the
field.
