# Grad student leave
## 
### 
ASSOC. DEAN of Graduate
Policy George Dekker and the
Personal Leave for Graduate
Students Committee recently made
it easier for students to take a leave
of absence. However, the new leave
policy does not take adequate mea
sures to ensure financial aid for stu
dents who go on extended leave.
The committee is currently final
izing the draft of the University's
first maternity and paternity leave
policy for graduate students. The
policy consolidates previous rules
into a comprehensive plan, while
modifying and clarifying the effects
of taking leave on health insurance
and financial aid. Although the
drafted policy has been called vague
on the issue of the effect of student
leave on financial aid, Dekker has
said that a one quarter absence
should not adversely effect a stu
dent's financial aid eligibility.
Nevertheless, Dekker has also
said that most students cannot be

guaranteed aid after an extended
break. This is unacceptable. The
policy should include provisions to
ensure students that when they
must take leave, they will not be
jeopardizing their futures.
Students who must take mater
nity or paternity leaves do not need
the extra hassle of worrying about
losing their insurance or financial
aid. The policy's stated goal is to
advise students and make them
aware of the consequences of a
leave. Although this is important, it
is not enough â€” simply telling stu
dents that they will risk their liveli
hood by leaving does little good.
Rather, the policy should aim to
maintain insurance benefits and
financial resources to make leaving
students feel more secure.
While the committee should be
applauded for trying to make the
policy on leaves clearer, their
attempts could and should go fur
ther towards making leaves easier.
