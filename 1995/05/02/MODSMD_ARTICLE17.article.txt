Law students used pseudo-rational style of debate

IAM SURPRISED that no one has
pointed out the major yet insidious
flaws in the argument against prefer
ential treatment presented by several law
students in their letter to The Daily of
April 21. These students use a pseudo
rational style of debate in order to sell
their one-sided ideas under the guise of
logic; that is, they make appeals to our
logic while defying it.
First, the students appeal to basic
knowledge of statistics by saying "any stu
dent who has taken introductory statistics
understands " Later they say "what
explains the nine percent [wage] differen
tial in the case of women. .. ? Statisticians
call such percentages unexplained varia
tion." By calling the variation "unex
plained," the students give an impression
that the difference is caused by unknown,
irrelevant, and / or multiple factors. In
other words, perhaps chance or individual
variation.
It seems that these students are hardly
students of statistics themselves. They fail
to mention the capacity of statistics to cal
culate the probability that a wage differ
ential is insignificant through the deter
mination of alpha, power, standard error,
confidence interval and other such mea
sures. With a rigorous design, statistical
results can possess a high probability of
indicating significant differences. Their
statement that "it is ... incorrect... to
assume that any unexplained variation is
attributable to discrimination" reminds
me of tobacco company researchers who
constantly claim that no research has

shown that cancer can be attributed to
smoking. Regarding wage differentials
between racial / ethnic / gender groups, it
appears reasonable to assume that part of
the variation can be explained by the
mechanism of discrimination, given the
many well-documented effects and cases
of historical and contemporary discrimi
nation.
The students state that "using average
figures belies true differences between
groups. In other words, we are comparing
apples to oranges...." Fine enough. How
ever later they say "women who remain
single earn roughly 91 percent of the
salaries of men in comparable jobs," as if
this comparison of average figures makes
a reasonable argument. Later, of course,
they shoot down this weak defense of
preferential treatment without citing the
statistical significance, if any, of this abso
lute number.
The students say "compare the wages
of women to those of men with compara
ble education, jobs, training... [then]
much of the wage differentials by sex and
ethnic classification disappear." Given
that this research is credible, this one-on
one comparison misses other mechanisms
of discrimination such as the proliferation
of job titles.
As women have increased their partici
pation in the labor force, especially in
high positions, new job titles with lower
wages and benefits are created which
have identical job tasks as the counter
part men's title. For example, while a
man could be promoted to the position of

"operations manager," a woman would be
promoted to the position of "technical
coordinator." In this manner, more
women can be assigned these lower-pay
ing job titles, and the company can dodge
charges of discrimination by saying that
the woman was in a different job position.
Women also become shunted more often
into jobs with less upward mobility. Thus,
men and women with the same job title
could very well have comparable wages
while discrimination still exists. A variety
of other characteristics such as quality of
education and training are also related to
how discrimination can exist statistically
when "similar" men and women are com
pared.
There are a host of other problems
with the students' letter, and for the sake
of brevity I will only mention them in
summary. First, they make the same
apples-to-oranges mistake by stating that
Jews and Japanese have been more suc
cessful than other minorities despite dis
crimination, ignoring their varied circum
stances of histoiy and culture. Second,
they attempt to discard preferential policy
based on its current flaws rather than
attempting to refine it for better applica
tion, much like those who opposed the
refinement of a flying machine, given so
many failures. Third, they decry unfair
police action against minorities, yet ignore
the fact that the "crime" of discrimination
is constantly being committed, and using
their police analogy, the officers should
arrest the offenders (the discriminators).
Fourth, they unfairly make the impres-

sion that all proponents of preferential
treatment intend to effect "benign dis
crimination." Fifth, they claim that we
should eradicate discrimination, but never
specify how that will be done (a common
conservative ploy), thereby ensuring that
nothing will be done to counter discrimi
nation. Finally, the students make a
rather slippery move by stating that "the
same legal avenues" will exist for individ
uals to battle discrimination. This state
ment seems rather harmless, yet the
removal of current policies switches the
scenario from the legitimization of dis
criminees' experiences by the government
to the denial of discrimination unless an
individual can prove through expensive
legal battles that discrimination exists in
the face of company gainsayers.
Most important, though, I find their
initial premise — that current wage dis
crimination does not even exist — an
insult to every person who has experi
enced and does experience discrimination.
The efforts of these law students are
faintly reminiscent of those who claim the
Holocaust never happened, except these
students focus on denying the present
reality in America.
Indeed, preferential policies are a com
plicated lot, and the law students have
introduced many important points in this
debate. However, I conclude that their
claim for dispassionate, open discussion is
only a cover for their pseudo-rational
arguments and precarious logic.
