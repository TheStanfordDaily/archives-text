## Casper: Vive la difference 
### 
IF I HAD wanted to march into Stan
ford Stadium on June 18 to the tune
of "Pomp and Circumstance," I
wouldn't be here. Even as a pro fro, I had
heard about the madness at Commence
ment. It's part of what made Stanford dif
ferent and less anal-retentive than our
East Coast counterparts. Part of what
made me think Stanford was so cool —
simply because I could get a good educa
tion with a sense of humor. That vision of
Stanford is slowly fading from sight, as
the administration continues to reshape
this campus into something far less inter
esting than it once was.
Regarding Commencement, we have
all heard the excuses: the heat, the length
of the ceremony, and the undignified
nature of revelry. Bullshit. Utter and
complete bullshit. What the administra
tion cares about is appearing stodgy
enough to keep the alumni dollars rolling
in. Oh yeah, and to please the grand
mothers in wheelchairs.
Come on, Casper. Usually you manage
to do a better job cloaking your plans to
turn this place into Ivy League Junior
University. I mean, over the last three
years of your administration, I've
watched you drop the hammer on some of
the most exciting aspects of this universi
ty. Almost every time, you manage to save
face with a convenient excuse or by plac
ing responsibility on one of your peons.
You and your followers have done
some real damage to this place in the

name of essential budget cuts: You've
jeopardized the funding and therefore the
very existence, of the performing arts
divisions of the University, you've tried to
push your plan for a three-year under
graduate career, making us feel like
grades and a "solid" transcript are more
important than feeling well-educated and
intellectually fulfilled, and you've fired
Cecilia Burciaga, one of most dynamic
and compassionate women that I've ever
known.
On the non-budget front, you've alien
ated both students and faculty by under
estimating our intelligence and by mak
ing us feel like money, not people, is the
lifeblood of this university. Perhaps more
importantly, you haven't taken the time
to address the issues that we really care
about, whether it be the sexual harass
ment policy, the development of new aca
demic programs, or something less seri
ous, like the procession.
I don't mean to be petty and cruel.
This is honestly what's been going on.
And your latest move to reform the Com
mencement ceremony into something
stale beyond words is simply a reflection
of this drive to make Stanford into an Ivy
League school with better weather.
You've been able to deal with Stanford's
corporate troubles, but the price you have
paid is that you have alienated those of us
who you supposedly represent and lead.
You are taking this university in direc
tions that we don't want it to go.

Let me explain something. Commence
ment is not for you, nor for rich alumni. It
is for me, my fellow graduates and our
loved ones. Suppose my family really,
really wanted to have time to go out to
brunch, and therefore, wanted gradua
tion to be shortened. Truth be told, they'd
rather see me enjoying myself in the pro
cession than listen to you recite some
canned speech about "What the future
holds for the Class of 1995."
Perhaps the most amusing part of your
whole plan is that it will backfire. We plan
to have as much fun as possible during
Commencement, regardless of whatever
containment system you're putting up to
keep us in the stands. Do what you have
to do. I'd love to tell my grandkids how I
got arrested during my own graduation.
So, Mr. Casper, I issue you a challenge.
Admit that you misjudged the sentiment
of the senior class and let us have our 45
minutes of fun. Or meet me and other
seniors today at noon as we rally in White
Plaza and voice our opinions, and tell us
face-to-face why you think we need to be
sedated.

To express your opinion on this issue to
President Casper, Events and Services
and the senior class presidents, send e
mail to procession@cs.stanford.edu and
it will be forwarded directly to their e
mail accounts.
