## Procession fiasco reflects lack of administration guidance 
### John Hall 
UNDER NO cir
cumstances
should students
partake in any sopho
moric revelry that might
be construed as a "mob
scene." Such disorgani
zation reflects a gross
mismanagement of pre
cious University
resources, and is unbe-

coming of Stanford graduates. There

procession is no longer consistent with
University policy. Sorry.
Nonetheless, students are instructed
to think back fondly on their idyllic
years of study here, and should give
freely as alumni. Please walk quietly to
your seats and make your checks
payable to "The Stanford Fund." Thank
you for coming.
Such conflicting messages have
become the trademark of Stanford's
administration and faculty relation
ships with students in recent years:
Graduate admissions officers and corpo
rate recruiters say that a Stanford
degree is as valuable as they come, but
the faculty changed the grading system
to be more like the "standard" of Har
vard and company. There are countless
plans for making Tresidder Union more
useful to students, but it's been decided
to cut meeting space and add more

administrative offices anyway. The U.S.
News ranking of Universities really
doesn't mean anything, but the Devel
opment Office putting more pressure on
young alumni before they really have
any income to speak of, because it will
help with the U.S. News criteria. And
until students threatened to disrupt
graduation, administrators wanted to
crack down on any signs of originality
there.
Changes like this leave students con
fused about what Stanford is trying to
do and cause them to question whether
the folks guiding their education really
have -their best interests in mind. It
doesn't take a Stanford grad to realize
that this sort of cynicism doesn't bode
well for alumni donations.
Granted, no single administrator or
faculty member actually intends this
sort of antagonism. The vast majority of

University employees that students
interact with are decent, considerate
people who want to do what's best for
both students and the University.
That's what makes the whole situation
so unfortunate. Because the image that
students are getting from all these
changes is one of antagonism, conde
scension and mistrust of students. It's a
dangerous path on which to be leading
the nation's leading University.
What's lacking is an official student
friendly philosophy and confidence in
Stanford's uniqueness from the Presi
dent's Office and the faculty senate.
Administrators have been stuck in the
entrenched budget-cutting mindset for
so long that they're beginning to see
students as the enemy rather than the
customer. Faculty members seem preoc
cupied with comparisons with Harvard.
Neither group seems to think much

about the impact that their attitudes
have on students' feelings for the Uni
versity.
Ironically, most students want to feel
good about Stanford, and want to see it
excel as an institution. They're not
morons. They know that improving
Stanford's reputation and respect
among other universities can only add
to the value of their diploma and their
marketability — which is what makes
the recent rash of changes seemingly
aimed at quelling "unruly and disre
spectful" students so bizarre.
A friend of mine who graduated in
'92 and is now finishing his film degree
at USC isn't going to attend the big cer
emony there. His reasoning? "Stan
ford's graduation was one of the best
things I've ever done. It meant a lot to
me. I don't see any reason to try to top
it." Voild.
