## Baggers face Santa Clara Is there any way to get rid of those pesky non-conference blues? 
### Seth Goldstein Editorial staff 
It's a tale of two schedules.
Within the difficult Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion, the No. 19 Stanford baseball team has
racked up a fairly impressive 17-10 record, trail
ing offensive powerhouse USC by only one game.
However, when dealing with less competitive
out-of-conference foes, the Cardinal can't seem
to keep its head above water, struggling to main
tain a .500 record at 10-10.
Tonight, the squad has a chance to get on the
good side of the break-even mark against non
conference opponents as it makes the short trip
down Route 101 to the University of Santa Clara
for a 7 p.m. start at Buck Shaw Stadium.
Stanford hopes the Broncos (30-15-1) prove
less dangerous than they were a few months ago.
During a home-away-home series in February,
the Cardinal dropped 2-of-3 to its neighbors from
the south.
Sophomore Tom Reimers (3-1, 4.97 ERA)
makes his first collegiate start for head coach
Mark Marquess. The right-hander was the
team's closer last season, as he racked up nine
saves with a 2.45 ERA during the
1994 campaign. Reimers' note
worthy freshman season earned
him the team's Most Valuable
Freshman award, which he
shared with Jason Middlebrook,
and Honorable Mention All-Six-
Pac recognition.
However, the 1995 season has
not been as kind to Reimers. A
pitcher who relies on his normally
excellent control, he has experi
enced bouts of wildness at times

this year, walking nine in just
over 13 innings in Six-Pac play
this year. After losing the role of
stopper, Reimers has been rele
gated to middle relief and set-up
action.
Injuries to Middlebrook and
junior Dan Reed have thinned out
Stanford's pitching ranks and
forced Marquess to tap Reimers
for today's start. If the sophomore
can return to the fine form he dis
played last year, the Cardinal
should expect to triumph. If not,
the team may have trouble.
Stanford has been saved by
the rising star of Kyle Peterson,
who at times this season has

appeared to be carrying the
squad. The freshman earned Six-
Pac Pitcher of the Week honors
for the third time this season by
virtue of his dominating perfor
mance in a 7-1 against Arizona
last Friday. He allowed just one
unearned run on seven hits while
striking out five and walking
four en route to his sixth com
plete game of the year.
Peterson, a likely selection for
the Freshman All-American
team, sports a 9-1 record and a
team-low 2.79 ERA in twelve
starts this year. He also leads the
squad in strikeouts (68) and oppo
nent batting average (.229).
