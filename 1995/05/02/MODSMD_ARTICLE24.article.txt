# Stoner administers last rites to tradition
## Stop beating a dead horse 
### 
Tuesday night. Opening night for major
league baseball last week. Only game
all day, and it's at night, on cable.
Already in a bitter mood about baseball, I
started cursing the thought of all these tra
ditions in all sports going astray.
If I were Prez or Commissioner or Acting
Commish, everybody would laugh. But hey,
look what people do to Bud Selig. In any
event, unlike Selig, I would try to do some
thing before striking becomes the ultimate
sporting tradition, like:

Put baseball back on network TV:
What's with this cable opener? Who came up
with the brilliant idea of putting only one
game on Night One and then opening the
season for real the next day?
The same people who came up with the
idea of not airing baseball on network TV
until the All-Star Game. Then they say that
we have too many games on TV (ESPN,
superstations, local TV) so they cut back the
ESPN night games. Then they say that the
superstations can't broadcast in competition
with national TV.
Look, they already took the game away
from us for six months. Now that we have it
back, it would be nice to those of us who
don't have cable to see somebody other than
the A's and Giants. I'm sure that those with
cable would also much rather watch baseball
than most of ESPN's other night-time pro
gramming, now that college hoops is over.
Put all baseball playoff games on
network TV: Bud Selig and his owner-bud
dies also came up with the heinous idea to
only put certain playoff games on TV. This,
supposedly, will make it better for the fans.
Huh?
Of course, with the strike last year, this
was the last of our October worries. But wait
until this year . .. unless they do it again.
Nix excess wild card teams: Hockey

and basketball are still the worst,
with 16 teams in the postseason
mess. And football has the heinous
idea of adding wild card teams,
going from one to three in the span
of two decades. Then baseball sur
rendered.
With their three-division align
ment (scrap that too), baseball own
ers / rich clowns needed another
postseason club to avoid a post-sea
son bye. With three divisions, I
guess this makes sense. But why
break off the West and East and add
the Central? Dumb.
Make basketball end before
school does: Why do the NBA
playoffs drag on for eternity? Back
in elementary school I traditionally
ragged on my Laker- or Celtic-fan
buddies when they lost in the finals
to the other one (not like my team
was there).
Somewhere along the way, as
series were stretched to show key
games on TV, the playoffs began
lasting until mid-June. Now unless
the Finals end in a sweep there is
virtually no chance of rubbing it in
to the loser's fans. No way should a
sport's season last almost eight full
months like the NBA's.
Bring back the old arc: When
players go from not shooting threes
at all to gunning in one season,

something is wrong. The three
point shot should be, say, 1.5 times
tougher than a two. Nowadays,
with the 21-inch closer arc, we've
got people making 19 in one playoff
game on 68 percent shooting.
While we're at it, I can bury
three-pointers at the college line.
Nineteen-foot-nine is way too close,
regardless of how long it's been that
way.
Want to increase scoring? Start
calling real fouls.
Kill the concept of instant
replay, anywhere: Football folks
have it right, now. I don't want to
see boneheads in some booth stall
the action for five minutes and then
make the wrong call anyway.
In college hoops, they hardly ever
use replay, but when they did in the
Kentucky-North Carolina game in
the NCAAs this year, they still
called the technical on the wrong
guy. Make the refs / umps take
responsibility for calling the game
with human eyes.
Stop destroying old arenas:
In two games, most likely, the
Boston Garden will be dust. This
comes on the heels of the demolition
of Chicago Stadium. What's next —
Madison Square Garden? At this
rate, Arco Arena will look old in 10
years.
Hoops isn't the only one to
blame. Baseball wrecks old ball
parks as often as they strike. Of
course, as badly as they've screwed
up, they need something like a new

ballpark to bring back fans.
Football teams should stay
put: Baseball, with all its self-pro
claimed monetary problems, hasn't
seen a franchise change cities since I
was born. Basketball's most recent
switch became a glorious squad that
plays in Sacramento (so, what's
wrong with that?) But football
squads can't stay put.
With all the talk that football
should realign divisions, so the NFC
West will not feature St. Louis, New
Orleans, Atlanta and Carolina, they
should come up with a division for
all the teams that have gone else
where in the last 13 years — the
Raiders, Rams, Colts and Cardinals.
Heck, two of these now play in a city
where a team moved from. Why
move in the first place? And the city
with the most loyal fans — Balti
more — is still stuck with the CFL.
To say LA Raiders is still weird.
But St. Louis Rams? Arizona Cardi
nals? My dad still says Baltimore
Colts.
After all this, I think I'm still the
most bitter about the tradition that
won't die. Contraiy to a certain
source, NBC still wouldn't take my
beloved Kings (TNT did), and
Sacramento is once again absent
from the playoff lineup. Now the
Kings will be back in the lottery
again. Hey, they shouldn't even
have a lotteiy.

Jeremy denies that midterms art
the true cause of his bitterness.
