# Stoner administers last rites to tradition
## Stop beating a dead horse 
### 
Tuesday night. Opening night for major
league baseball last week. Only game
all day, and it's at night, on cable.
Already in a bitter mood about baseball, I
started cursing the thought of all these tra
ditions in all sports going astray.
If I were Prez or Commissioner or Acting
Commish, everybody would laugh. But hey,
look what people do to Bud Selig. In any
event, unlike Selig, I would try to do some
thing before striking becomes the ultimate
sporting tradition, like:

Put baseball back on network TV:
What's with this cable opener? Who came up
with the brilliant idea of putting only one
game on Night One and then opening the
season for real the next day?
The same people who came up with the
idea of not airing baseball on network TV
until the All-Star Game. Then they say that
we have too many games on TV (ESPN,
superstations, local TV) so they cut back the
ESPN night games. Then they say that the
superstations can't broadcast in competition
with national TV.
Look, they already took the game away
from us for six months. Now that we have it
back, it would be nice to those of us who
don't have cable to see somebody other than
the A's and Giants. I'm sure that those with
cable would also much rather watch baseball
than most of ESPN's other night-time pro
gramming, now that college hoops is over.
Put all baseball playoff games on
network TV: Bud Selig and his owner-bud
dies also came up with the heinous idea to
only put certain playoff games on TV. This,
supposedly, will make it better for the fans.
Huh?
Of course, with the strike last year, this
was the last of our October worries. But wait
until this year . .. unless they do it again.
