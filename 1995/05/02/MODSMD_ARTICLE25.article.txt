# Schlukebir, Bleszynski capture doubles title
## Both reach semifinals in singles competition 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
In seizing the Pacific 10 doubles crown
and advancing two of its singles representa
tives to the semi-finals of the draw, Stanford
(21-2 overall, 10-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) once again demon
strated its conference dominance at the Pac
-10 Individual Singles and Doubles Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif., this weekend.
Sophomore Katie Schlukebir and fresh
man Ania Bleszynski ran away with the
doubles crown this weekend, cruising
through four consecutive victories, three in
straight sets and one default. The Stanford
No. 1 doubles squad finished their string of
success against Susie Italiano and Nicole
London of USC, who had eliminated Stan
ford's other two teams consecutively. The
Pac-10 champs bulldozed the Trojan tan
dem, 6-2, 6-3.
"This was the quality tennis," said head
coach Frank Brennan. "The last team they
played was scaiy. They had a lot of talent
and they're a brand new team for USC, and
they're really good. So that was a good win
although they are not an established team.
But our team played really well. They felt
good about it. They felt they were really rip
ping and playing the kind of tennis that they
need to play as a power No. 1 team."
On its way to the finals the Cardinal
clashed head on in the semifinals with a
rival California duo of Nicole Elliott and
Jenifer Poulos, who posed little threat to the
young Stanford crew as they breezed into
the championship round, 6-2, 6-2. Another
squad from Cal, Miko Ando and Vera Vitels,
set up that meeting by defaulting in the
quarterfinals.
Schlukebir and Bleszynski, currently the

No. 11 doubles team in the nation according
to the most recent Rolex Collegiate Rank
ings, seemed to gain momentum as the tour
nament moved along. Thus they started a
bit slowly in their first set of the first round,
beating Arizona's Melody Falco and
Stephanie Sammaritano in a tie-breaker, 7-
6. Emotion from that victory spilled over
into the next set as the Wildcat duo could
not maintain that level of competition. Stan
ford took the match 7-6, 6-1, and the rest is
Pac-10 history.
Freshman Julie Scott and junior Beth
Berris, the Cardinal's new No. 3 doubles
team, demanded some of the doubles spot
light as well, advancing to the semifinals. An
upset victory over the No. 6 tandem in colle
giate tennis highlighted the Cardinal's jour
ney through the draw. Scott and Berris met
Cal's No. 1 squad of Keirsten Alley and Pam
Nelson in the quarterfinals and threw them
down, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
"That's huge because it gives them a lit
tle more confidence as a team," Brennan
said. "It gives them some more matches and
a nice win, and if we do happen to bump into
Cal again, Nelson and Alley have to feel like
they can't beat the No. 3 team." Scott and
Berris's run ended, however, as they collid
ed unsuccessfully with London and Italiano,
6-4, 7-5.
The third Cardinal doubles competitors,
sophomore Emily Burt and redshirt senior
Amy Chiminello, found elimination in the
second round of play versus none other than
Italiano and London, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5. They
blew past their first round opponent, Wash
ington State's Emma Lin and Linnette Vis
agie, 6-3, 6-0.
Despite the lack of a title, Stanford found

additional success in the singles
draw, sending two players to the
semifinals and three to the quar
terfinals. Schlukebir, Stanford's
No. 1 player, and Bleszysnki, the
No. 3, again directed the Cardinal
march, but both could not man
age to extend the path to the
finals as they met two of the
hottest players in college tennis,
Cal's Nelson and UCLA's Keri
Phebus, in the semifinals.
"It [singles] went about
according to schedule," Brennan
said, referring to what he wanted
to get from the tournament.
"Katie had a real good win over
[Keirsten] Alley, who plays three
for them, and played really well.
Then she played this Reka
[Cseresnyes], who plays No. 3 for
Arizona State, and beat her, and
was really playing some good ten

nis, and most importantly, get
ting some wins. Overall, she had
a good week."
The All-American sophomore
rolled through the draw, defeat
ing Arizona's Angela Bernal (7-6,
6-0) in the first round, Alley (6-4,
3-6, 6-4) in the second, and
Cseresnyes (6-4, 6-4) in the third.
Her meeting with Nelson, howev
er, ended that streak as she fell, 6-
3, 6-0.
Bleszynski extended her semi
final opponent, Keri Phebus, fur
ther in a grueling three-set
matchup. The freshman looked
primed for an upset with a 4-2
lead in the third set. But Phebus,
the No. 2 ranked player national
ly and the eventual champion,
stormed back to take the match,
6-3, 3-6, 6-4. However, Bleszysn
ki, who had broken out of a slump
in Berkeley last week, continued
to gain momentum for the NCAA
championships in the first three
rounds of the draw with three
straight set victories against Cal's

Elliott, Arizona State's Kara
Schertzer, and Arizona's Vicky
Maes, the No. 1 player for the
Wildcats.
"Ania was great," said Bren
nan. "She started her climb out
of the grave against Cal, thank
god. So she was on her way. She
was getting her confidence back.
She still wasn't playing great.
Then she went down to this tour
nament and really opened up
with both guns. She was good.
She was really relaxed and hit
ting the ball a ton. She's an
extremely powerful girl, and she
was moving like a panther. Her
athletic ability, now that she's
relaxed, is really starting to show
through."
"But probably her best match
was the final match against Phe
bus. She's ranked two or three in
the country, she's probably the
odds on favorite to return to the
NCAA finals. And Ania just
stayed right in there with her. It
was a great match: Ania's slug
ging and Phebus is retrieving and
it was really a well played match."
Stanford's other freshman suc
cess story, Scott, also reached the
quarterfinals where Nelson put
her away. Yet Scott turned some
heads with big victories, head
lined by a first round upset of
USC's No. 1 player, Italiano, 6-4,
6-1. Scott also shocked Arizona's
No. 3 competitor, Sammaritano,
in straight sets, 6-1, 6-4.
"This is exactly what we like to
have happen. Our No. 5 player,
who may be underrated because
she plays No. 5 and doesn't get
the quality wins, goes off and gets
to play the No. 1 from USC and
beat her," said Brennan. "And
play the No. 3 from Arizona who
is ranked way ahead of her and
beats her. And actually her last
match with Nelson was really
good again. She was taking it to
Nelson, slamming it around and
running like a deer, and coming to
the net. That's sort of the general
consensus that 'Gee, this kid can
really play tennis'."
Pac-10 singles defending
champion, Stanford sophomore
Sandra De Silva, cruised through
the first round and Washington
State's Nerelle Weil, 6-1, 6-2, but
couldn't muster last year's Ojai
magic as she fell to London in the
second round, 7-6, 6-0. The fifth
Cardinal competitor, Chiminello,
fell in the first round to UCLA's
Diana Spadea, 6-0, 6-2.
