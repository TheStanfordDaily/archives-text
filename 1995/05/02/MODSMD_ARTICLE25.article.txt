## Both reach semifinals in singles competition 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
In seizing the Pacific 10 doubles crown
and advancing two of its singles representa
tives to the semi-finals of the draw, Stanford
(21-2 overall, 10-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) once again demon
strated its conference dominance at the Pac
-10 Individual Singles and Doubles Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif., this weekend.
Sophomore Katie Schlukebir and fresh
man Ania Bleszynski ran away with the
doubles crown this weekend, cruising
through four consecutive victories, three in
straight sets and one default. The Stanford
No. 1 doubles squad finished their string of
success against Susie Italiano and Nicole
London of USC, who had eliminated Stan
ford's other two teams consecutively. The
Pac-10 champs bulldozed the Trojan tan
dem, 6-2, 6-3.
"This was the quality tennis," said head
coach Frank Brennan. "The last team they
played was scaiy. They had a lot of talent
and they're a brand new team for USC, and
they're really good. So that was a good win
although they are not an established team.
But our team played really well. They felt
good about it. They felt they were really rip
ping and playing the kind of tennis that they
need to play as a power No. 1 team."
On its way to the finals the Cardinal
clashed head on in the semifinals with a
rival California duo of Nicole Elliott and
Jenifer Poulos, who posed little threat to the
young Stanford crew as they breezed into
the championship round, 6-2, 6-2. Another
squad from Cal, Miko Ando and Vera Vitels,
set up that meeting by defaulting in the
quarterfinals.
Schlukebir and Bleszynski, currently the

No. 11 doubles team in the nation according
to the most recent Rolex Collegiate Rank
ings, seemed to gain momentum as the tour
nament moved along. Thus they started a
bit slowly in their first set of the first round,
beating Arizona's Melody Falco and
Stephanie Sammaritano in a tie-breaker, 7-
6. Emotion from that victory spilled over
into the next set as the Wildcat duo could
not maintain that level of competition. Stan
ford took the match 7-6, 6-1, and the rest is
Pac-10 history.
Freshman Julie Scott and junior Beth
Berris, the Cardinal's new No. 3 doubles
team, demanded some of the doubles spot
light as well, advancing to the semifinals. An
upset victory over the No. 6 tandem in colle
giate tennis highlighted the Cardinal's jour
ney through the draw. Scott and Berris met
Cal's No. 1 squad of Keirsten Alley and Pam
Nelson in the quarterfinals and threw them
down, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
"That's huge because it gives them a lit
tle more confidence as a team," Brennan
said. "It gives them some more matches and
a nice win, and if we do happen to bump into
Cal again, Nelson and Alley have to feel like
they can't beat the No. 3 team." Scott and
Berris's run ended, however, as they collid
ed unsuccessfully with London and Italiano,
6-4, 7-5.
The third Cardinal doubles competitors,
sophomore Emily Burt and redshirt senior
Amy Chiminello, found elimination in the
second round of play versus none other than
Italiano and London, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5. They
blew past their first round opponent, Wash
ington State's Emma Lin and Linnette Vis
agie, 6-3, 6-0.
