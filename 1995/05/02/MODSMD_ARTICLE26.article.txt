## Humphries takes conference title Salzenstein advances to semis 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (23-0 overall,
10-0 in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division) continued to put
together the final pieces of a
dream season last weekend in
Ojai, Calif, winning two singles
titles and placing second in two
doubles tournaments.
No. 25-ranked freshman Scott
Humphries (30-7 overall, 16-3 in
dual matches) scored three upset
victories en route to Stanford's
first Pac-10 Singles Champi
onship since Alex O'Brien won
for the Cardinal in 1992.
In rapid succession,
Humphries surprised No. 1-
ranked Sargis Sargsian of Ari
zona State, No. 4-ranked Brett
Hansen of USC and No. 17-
ranked Michael Hill of California
to take the prestigious title in a 7-
6, 5-7, 6-4 nailbiter. It was
Humphries' first singles title
since winning Junior Wimbledon
last summer.
The amazing thing is how well
the game of the Cardinal's No. 2
singles player matched up against
his opponents, all of whom play
in the No. 1 slot for their respec
tive schools.
"I knew I had a pretty good
chance going in," Humphries
said. "My serve-and-volley game
matches up well against baselin
ers like Sargsian and Hansen."
Humphries looked more the
nation's top player against
Sargsian, disposing of the Sun
Devil with ease, 6-4, 6-3 in their
quarterfinal match.
"I went out and kind of took
the match to him," Humphries
said. "I wasn't gonna let him dic
tate the match and get into a
groove, which is what he likes to

do."
Humphries had an even easier
time with Hansen in a 6-4, 6-0
semifinal victory for the Cardi
nal. Fourth-ranked players rarely
lose a match as badly as Hansen
did, but when they do it is usual
ly because of a mental break
down. This match was no differ
ent. After a service break gave
Humphries the first set, it was all
downhill for the Trojan.
"I stayed on him, got an early
break in the second set, and men
tally he was done," Humphries
said.
In the championship match,
Humphries came up against what
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
called "a red-hot Michael Hill."
Hill arrived at the finals with
some impressive victories under
his belt. He defeated Stanford's
No. 54-ranked Jim Thomas (23-
10, 18-4 in dual matches) in the
first round, 6-1, 7-5; UCLA's No.
16-ranked Eric Taino in the quar
ters, 7-6, 6-3; and Stanford's No.
6-ranked Jeff Salzenstein (37-10,
20-3 in dual matches) in the
semis 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. It was Hill's
second consecutive three-set vic
tory over Salzenstein, who Gould
said had a "good solid tourna
ment," including a 6-4, 1-6, 7-5
quarterfinal defeat of UCLA's
top singles player, Justin Gimel
stob, for the second time in as
many weeks.
The final match began like a
heavyweight title bout â€” the two
contenders felt each other out
without outplaying the other.
Hill had his chances when he led
5-3 and was serving for the first
set. But Humphries broke back
and ended up taking the first set,
7-6 (9-7).
After Hill took the second set,
