## Humphries takes conference title Salzenstein advances to semis 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team (23-0 overall,
10-0 in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division) continued to put
together the final pieces of a
dream season last weekend in
Ojai, Calif, winning two singles
titles and placing second in two
doubles tournaments.
No. 25-ranked freshman Scott
Humphries (30-7 overall, 16-3 in
dual matches) scored three upset
victories en route to Stanford's
first Pac-10 Singles Champi
onship since Alex O'Brien won
for the Cardinal in 1992.
In rapid succession,
Humphries surprised No. 1-
ranked Sargis Sargsian of Ari
zona State, No. 4-ranked Brett
Hansen of USC and No. 17-
ranked Michael Hill of California
to take the prestigious title in a 7-
6, 5-7, 6-4 nailbiter. It was
Humphries' first singles title
since winning Junior Wimbledon
last summer.
The amazing thing is how well
the game of the Cardinal's No. 2
singles player matched up against
his opponents, all of whom play
in the No. 1 slot for their respec
tive schools.
"I knew I had a pretty good
chance going in," Humphries
said. "My serve-and-volley game
matches up well against baselin
ers like Sargsian and Hansen."
Humphries looked more the
nation's top player against
Sargsian, disposing of the Sun
Devil with ease, 6-4, 6-3 in their
quarterfinal match.
"I went out and kind of took
the match to him," Humphries
said. "I wasn't gonna let him dic
tate the match and get into a
groove, which is what he likes to

do."
Humphries had an even easier
time with Hansen in a 6-4, 6-0
semifinal victory for the Cardi
nal. Fourth-ranked players rarely
lose a match as badly as Hansen
did, but when they do it is usual
ly because of a mental break
down. This match was no differ
ent. After a service break gave
Humphries the first set, it was all
downhill for the Trojan.
"I stayed on him, got an early
break in the second set, and men
tally he was done," Humphries
said.
In the championship match,
Humphries came up against what
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
called "a red-hot Michael Hill."
Hill arrived at the finals with
some impressive victories under
his belt. He defeated Stanford's
No. 54-ranked Jim Thomas (23-
10, 18-4 in dual matches) in the
first round, 6-1, 7-5; UCLA's No.
16-ranked Eric Taino in the quar
ters, 7-6, 6-3; and Stanford's No.
6-ranked Jeff Salzenstein (37-10,
20-3 in dual matches) in the
semis 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. It was Hill's
second consecutive three-set vic
tory over Salzenstein, who Gould
said had a "good solid tourna
ment," including a 6-4, 1-6, 7-5
quarterfinal defeat of UCLA's
top singles player, Justin Gimel
stob, for the second time in as
many weeks.
The final match began like a
heavyweight title bout — the two
contenders felt each other out
without outplaying the other.
Hill had his chances when he led
5-3 and was serving for the first
set. But Humphries broke back
and ended up taking the first set,
7-6 (9-7).
After Hill took the second set,
7-5, Humphries and his Bear
opponent stayed with each other
until the final game of the match,
when a couple of unforced errors
by Hill effectively handed
Humphries the game, set, and
match.
"He just kind of flaked out —
which he has been known to do,
but hasn't done in a while,"
Humphries said.
Humphries also used the tour
nament to avenge an early season
defeat to USC's Lukas Hovorka.
Humphries knocked out the Tro
jan in the second round, 6-4, 6-7,
6-1.
Humphries attributed his
recent success to overall improaa®
ments made in his game since his
first match with Hovorka.
"Compared to where I was in
the fall, my game is starting to
come in. It is sharpening up, and
timing-wise that's great going
into NCAAs," Humphries said.
Humphries nearly swept the
entire tournament, finishing sec
ond in the Pac-10 Doubles Cham
pionship along with partner Paul
Goldstein. The No. 2-ranked dou
bles team (39-7) fell to USC's
Brett Hansen and Fernando
Samayoa in the finals, 6-3, 6-7, 6-
4.
The Trojan duo jumped out to
a 6-3, 2-0 lead in the match before
a 15-minute rain delay allowed
Humphries and Goldstein to
regroup and get back into the
match. The Cardinal's top dou
bles team was unable to pull out
the final set, however, and with
that lost its first doubles tourna
ment in recent memory.
But the road trip to Ojai was

not without its rewards for the
Cardinal's freshmen tandem.
Their 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (17-15) defeat
of USC's Adam Petersona and
Lukas Hovorka in the quarterfi
nals was recorded as the make-up
of a final-round match that was
rained out earlier this year at the
Pacific Coast Doubles Champi
onships. Humphries and Gold
stein saved four match points in
garnering their fifth doubles
crown in as many tries.
In other singles action, Stan
ford's No. 49-ranked Paul Gold
stein (29-7, 20-2) was upset in the
first round by USC's Fernando
Samayoa, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1.
"Paul lost serve in the third set
and boom it was all over," Gould
said.
The Cardinal's Grant Elliott
(26-3, 21-2 in dual matches) of
L_Palo Alto lost his first-round
match to Cal's No. 20-ranked
Casey Louie of Sunnyvale, 6-7, 7-
6, 6-1. After Elliott let a match
point get away in the second set,
Louie made him pay.
"Grant played very well
against a friend of his. It just
seemed Grant would win two or
three long tough points, but then
would give up two or three quick
points," Gould said.
Junior Ricky Becker was
responsible for Stanford's other
singles title in Ojai. He won the
Men's Collegiate Invitational by
defeating Eric Lin of UCLA, 6-1,
7-6. The Invitational is akin to
the basketball's NIT — it hosts
the top players from the Pac-10
not competing in the in the Pac
-10 singles championships' draw
of 32 .
"Technically, all it makes me is
the 33rd best player in the Pac
-10, which I think is funny and
unindicative of my place in the
conference," Becker said.

Becker wishes he could have
played better in the Pac-10 Dou
bles Championship with partner
Jim Thomas because they needed
to hone their game with NCAAs
fast approaching two weeks from
now.
"I look at Ojai as a negative
because I cared more about dou
bles than singles," Becker said.
The No. 34-ranked Thomas
and Becker (23-10) lost their
first-round doubles match to
ASU's Sargsian and Dave Critch
ley, 7-5, 7-5.
Also in the Invitational, fresh
man Charles Hoeveler lost in the
semifinals of the singles and,
along with partner Misha Pale
cek, lost in the doubles champi
onship match.
"Charles did a great job and he
and Misha did a good job in dou
bles," Gould said.
In a perfect world, Gould
would have liked all his players to
have gotten the maximum
amount of work in singles and
doubles before NCAAs May 13-
21, but he realizes that would
have been impossible.
"I wish they all could have
played nine or ten matches, but
the only guy that's gonna do that
is the guy who wins the entire
tournament," Gould said.
As it was, Stanford players
achieved enough positive results
to provide them with some added
momentum for their impending
trip to Athens, Ga.
"This tournament got the guys
attention. They were really drag
ging in practice on Monday and
Tuesday. In the first few matches,
everyone looked a little tired, a lit
tle sluggish, a little let down.
When the dual-match season
ended, everyone just said, 'Phew.'
But now we are set up pretty well
for nationals," Gould said.
