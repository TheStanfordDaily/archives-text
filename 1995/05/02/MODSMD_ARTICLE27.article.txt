# Ivy League boats pack too much punch for Cardinal
## Outrowed on the East Coast 
### Julie Choe 
With just less than three weeks until the Pacific
10 Championship, both the men's and women's
crew team headed east for some tough competition
this past weekend. The men faced No. 1 Princeton
and a strong Cornell squad in New Jersey to prepare
for the Pac-lOs. Meanwhile, the women's crew met
Harvard and Yale at the Charles River in Boston in
an equally tough race.
Although the weekend trips ended in losses for
Stanford, both coaches and athletes were very opti
mistic. For the men, it was their first trip to Prince
ton and they knew that they would be facing a very
tough league.
Although Stanford lost a total of 12 seniors last

year, the young team is showing a great deal of
potential this season. Men's coach Wieslaw Kujda
believes that "we are technically and physically
strong, but we're lacking in racing gear." The races
are won by seconds, yet "we have to race the entire
race ... that means the entire 2,000 meters," Kujda
said.
Currently, Stanford stands among the top five
teams in the Pac-10 and the Cardinal hopes to
improve its ranking at the Big Row at California this
weekend. During these upcoming weeks, the men's
team hopes to gain more experience to help make a
few important changes for a better race. That expe
rience includes more trips to the East to see how the

top teams in the nation are racing.
The men hope to make three treks
to the other coast next year, includ
ing a possible berth at nationals.
In the other matchup of west
versus east the Stanford women's
crew team finished behind both
Harvard and Yale over the week

end. Despite the disappointment,
the race gave them a good idea of
what to expect in the future. Har
vard and Yale are among the top
five teams in the nation and if
Stanford manages to finish second
in the Pac-10 this season, the Car
dinal will have the valuable oppor
tunity to race against the elites of
the sport.
"We learned a lot by rowing
with higher ranking teams," said
senior captain Kara Johnson. "It

was a good experience."
Right now, the Cardinal women
trail Washington and Washington
State in the Pac-10 rankings.
Along with the men, they are look
ing towards the Big Row where
both teams will meet Cal, which
the Cardinal has defeated several
times this year. The Stanford
women hold a respectable No. 10
spot in the nation and hope to
improve on their ranking this
weekend.
