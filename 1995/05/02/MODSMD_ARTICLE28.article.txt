## Disqualification ends sailors' dreams of fleet championships 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
Last year, the Stanford sailing team managed
to obtain a berth in the Fleet Racing National
Championships through a protest against UC-
Irvine at the District Championships.
This year in Long Beach, the shoe was on the
other foot. A bitterly frustrating protest prevent
ed the squad from qualifying for the champi
onships; however, the Cardinal was able to earn a
spot in the Team Racing Nationals.
Team racing kicked off the event on a positive
note for the Cardinal. Stanford's three boat squad
dropped its first race of the round robin competi
tion to UC-Irvine, but quickly recovered. The
teams of senior Charles Meade and Freshman
Betsy Charmicheal, freshmen Danny Zimbaldi
and Heather Rogers, and freshman John Meade
and sophomore Megan Ireson evened the record
against the Anteaters and then failed to surrender
a race throughout the remaining action.
The series of victories led the Cardinal to a first
place finish in the Team Racing District Champi
onships. Second-place finisher Irvine will join the
Cardinal in Long Beach at the end of May for the
national championships.
Zimbaldi's strong team racing performance
aided the Cardinal's success and earned him the
skipper position in Stanford's B division fleet rac
ing boat. Coach Steve Bourdow's selection
resolved an ongoing competition between the two
freshmen, Zimbaldi and Meade, for the B division
slot.
Bourdow's decision proved to be wise early on
in Saturday's races. Zimbaldi and crew Rogers

sailed solid and ended their impressive day in sec
ond place. The team excelled in the heavier winds
which complement Zimbaldi's tactical ability.
The team of the elder Meade and crew
Charmichael continued to sail as they have done
all year. Far and away the best sailor of the cham
pionships, Meade demonstrated a composed
intensity that allowed his boat to dominate the A
division. Saturday afternoon, when many teams
felt the physical drain of the seven previous races,
Meade proved why he is an Ail-American candi
date.
"He came in at the break and said 'I'm going to
turn it up a notch,' " Bourdow recounted. "And in
the last five races he did â€” he was clearly the best
sailor there."
Stanford topped the scoreboard at the end of
the day with a comfortable 15 point margin over
California. Stanford seemed well on its way to the
national championships before things took a dis
tinct turn. More specifically, the wind and condi
tions took a distinct turn.
Low wind and choppier water affected Stan
ford's performance. The light breeze hurt Zimbal
di the most; Bourdow had a hunch he would have
to switch B-division teams to accommodate the
lighter breeze. In the first race of the day, Zimbal
di false started and only managed to crossed the
finish line eighth out of 11 boats. The race
revealed a definite decrease in boat speed and
Bourdow decided to call on Meade, who is better
suited for lighter conditions.
Meade stepped into action and took awhile to
get into the flow of the regatta. His B-division
