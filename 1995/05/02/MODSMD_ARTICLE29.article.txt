# Short-handed cyclists return from Reno with mixed results

The Stanford cycling team closed out its regular
season schedule this weekend at the University of
Nevada at Reno Race Weekend and now seeks to
defend its national championship as the postseason
begins.
In threatening weather and strong winds at
Reno, the team raced in a criterium, an individual
time trial and a team trial. Although the squad was
missing several cyclists, it still managed to win the
individual time trial and several individuals also
placed high in their respective categories.
Eight teams raced, including California and UC-
Davis, the Nos. 2 and 4 teams in the West Coast
Cycling Conference (WCCC). Stanford entered the
competition in second place, a few points behind Cal.
In the University of Nevada Kinetics Criterium held
on Saturday, the Cardinal felt the absence of the
missing riders as it finished in third place almost
300 points behind the Golden Bears' 392, falling into
third place in the conference.
In the men's A category, graduate student Dario
Falquier, the team captain, was Stanford's top fin
isher, coming in tenth out of 14 entrants. However,
in the men's C category, graduate student Matt
Lyon finished third, and graduate students Shanti
Amagasu, John Suh and Dave Cornelius finished
third, seventh and ninth, respectively, in the men's
D race. In the women's race, graduate student
Megan Troxell had another strong race as she fin
ished second in the women's A category.
Strong gusts of wind with speeds of up to 46 mph
caused problems in the criterium. Troxell described
the winds as "horrible" and said that a rider from
Foothill College in her race was toppled over by a
gust of wind and was taken to the hospital.
The weather improved for the time trials on Sun
day, and the Stanford team came out shining. How
ever, although Stanford had the strongest perfor

mance, the squad finished second behind Nevada
due to the lack of available cyclists. Because the Wolf
Pack registered more cyclists than any other team,
Nevada automatically won the race since all their
riders finished the race. As a result, the squad
received enough points to break into the top 12 and
qualify for the WCCC championships in two weeks.
Although the Cardinal knew that it had lost going
into the races because they couldn't field a women's
team, they pulled off wins in both men's categories.
Troxell raced in the men's A race to fill out the four
person team, and the team, which also included grad
students Falquier, Dave Bailey and Keish Doi, fin
ished one minute ahead of the competition at 14
minutes, 50 seconds. The men's B team of Cor
nelius, Amagasu, Lyon and grad student John Suh
also won its category, finishing ahead of two Nevada
teams.
In the 14-mile individual time trial, Stanford pro
ceeded to earn its eighth event win of the season as
it won three of the six categories. In the men's A
race, Falquier and Bailey finished first and second
and Doi finished tenth. Bailey originally was going
to stay in the Bay Area to participate in another
race, but bad weather canceled the race and allowed
him to race in Reno in the time trial, his specialty. In
the men's C category, Lyon finished second, and Suh
and Cornelius finished one and two in the D catego
ry. Troxell won the women's A race while junior
Kelly Herndon finished fifth.
The races also helped two riders in the season
omnium standings, the composite of all individual
points. Troxell moved past Julie Henderson of Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo into first place in the women's
omnium, and Falquier remained in third place but
edged closer to the leader in the men's race. Also, in
another individual, non-collegiate race this week
end, Stanford grad student Joan Wilson, a favorite
for the road race at the collegiate nationals, placed
