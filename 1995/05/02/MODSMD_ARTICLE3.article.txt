# Overseas studies key to future, directors say
## 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
Overseas studies may be the key to
Stanford students' future participa
tion in a world increasingly without
substantive economic and cultural
boundaries, according to directors of
Stanford's overseas campuses.
The University has a decades-old
history of overseas studies programs
around the globe, which directors say is
challenged by budget cuts even as stu

dent interest in international educa
tion grows.
The directors of Stanford's seven
current campuses — Oxford, Berlin,
Moscow, Florence, Paris, Kyoto and
Santiago — are attending a two-week
long conference on different issues af
fecting international study. Issues of
importance to Stanford's directors in
clude technology, internships and ex
panding research opportunities.
Ten years ago marked the last time
that the directors of Stanford's over

seas programs gathered together, and
it is a very different group traveling
from different countries that reflect
the changes in overseas studies. In
stead of Cracow, there is Moscow. In
stead of Salamanca, there is Santiago.
These directors, in interviews with
The Daily, touched on common issues
such as the importance of overseas
study in an international world, the
value of cross-cultural exchange and
the difficulties of budget restructur
ing.

An international future
"The world is becoming internation
al — that is simply the case," said
Karen Kramer, director of Stanford-in-
Berlin. Many of the directors echoed
Kramer's statement by focusing on the
increasingly international direction of
world economies and business, as wit
nessed by the European Economic
Community and NAFTA.
"The next century is going to be a
time of really big international
economic spaces," said Edmundo
Fuenzalida, director of the Santi
ago program. "This is the time to
get the education in that kind of
economic space and students need
experience in this type of environ
ment."
Universities must be aware of
the changes in the world, said
Terry MacDougall, director of the
Kyoto program. "The university
of the late 20th Century has to
have a global dimension, and that
is why Stanford has integrated
international education into its
curriculum."
For example, many stressed
the importance of language.
"Graduating from an elite univer
sity such as Stanford, students
should be able to do business and
communicate with other peo
ples," said Maxim Bratersky,
director of Stanford-in-Moscow.
He added that students who go
overseas may not work in that
country after graduation, but the
experience widens perspectives
and allows students to look at
problems and solutions different
ly-
Fuenzalida insisted that over
seas studies is one of the best
opportunities at Stanford because
it is the best preparation the Uni
versity can provide for the future.
"Remember that you will live in
the future, not the present," he

added.
Budget bothers
The cost of overseas studies is
a crucial issue in Stanford's fiscal
restructuring environment but
directors insisted the benefits of
the program exceed its costs.
Nevertheless, budget con
straints have hit many of the
overseas centers. Two years ago,
the Florence program was put
on probation because of cost-cut
ting measures, Campani said.
Although the center's future is
now secure, it has moved to a
smaller location.
At the Berlin center, staff has
been reduced and the focus had
been on making the center more
efficient, Kramer said.
"Most cuts have not been so
perceptible*," she added, "It has
really been helpful though that
some donors have taken up the
slack."
For example, longtime Univer
sity donor Helen Bing has
increased her contribut ions to the
overseas programs significantly,
so that each center is able to fund
field trips and cultural excursions
for students without depending
on the constraints of the Univer
sity budget.
Stanford, nevertheless, is
spending money to increase com
puter accessibility at the centers.
"It is exciting that new technolo
gies like the World Wide Web
allow the centers to be more close
ly linked to the intellectual envi
ronment on campus," Kramer
said.

Experiencing other cultures
Each director said cultural
exchange is one of the most pow
erful reasons to study overseas.
Overseas programs allow stu
dents to experience the world in a
way which they cannot if they are
simply tourists, said Linda Cam
pani, director of Stanford-in-Flo
rence. "Students are offered tools
to learn about a new culture."
The guideline for going over
seas should be "do with us what
you can't do on your own," said
Estelle Halevi, director of Stan
ford-in-Paris.
"Paris is a foreign and an urban
experience, as well as an immer
sion experience," Halevi said. The
emphasis is to integrate students
into French institutions and allow
them to experience another cul
ture through classes at French
universities and internships at
places such as the Mus6e d'Orsay.
"Call it inter-cultural compe
tency," Kramer said. She
explained that since the Berlin
Wall came down in 1989, students
have been learning to understand
the mindset of East Germans and
the changes underway.
Even at Oxford, "students
might speak the same language
but not be saying the same
thing," said Geoffrey Tyack,
director of the Oxford program.
Although Oxford is the only pro
gram in which students do not
live with families, Tyack said it
allows participants other opportu
nities for exchange.
"Students can play sports, par
ticipate in drama or in choir in

conjunction with the colleges at
Oxford," he said.
Internships and research
opportunities increase students
access to the culture, while teach
ing them about their goals, many
directors said. "Our internship
programs make students much
better prepared to see what kind
of environment and career they
want to work in," Kramer said.
"Getting students involved in
the production of knowledge is
important, because they can have
a say in what they are learning,"
MacDougall said.
The Moscow program is look
ing to expand its horizons by also
providing internship opportuni
ties, maybe at such institutions as
the Carnegie Endowment or at
joint-venture companies. It is also
looking to add tutorials or
research opportunities soon.
Research begun at overseas
centers often leads to other
internships or long-term projects.
"Many students produce honors
theses which come out of their
research-related internships,"
Kramer said.
At Oxford, through a tutorial
system, students can choose
almost exactly what they would
like to study, Tyack said. In this
way, "Oxford can cater to almost
any academic interest," he added.
"If we do something in the cen
ters, it is to prepare citizens of the
world," Fuenzalida said.
Kramer added, "Many stu
dents come back and they all say
that their perspectives have been
expanded."

you can't do on your own," said
Estelle Halevi, director of Stan
ford-in-Paris.
"Paris is a foreign and an urban
experience, as well as an immer
sion experience," Halevi said. The
emphasis is to integrate students
into French institutions and allow
them to experience another cul
ture through classes at French
universities and internships at
places such as the Mus6e d'Orsay.
"Call it inter-cultural compe
tency," Kramer said. She
explained that since the Berlin
Wall came down in 1989, students
have been learning to understand
the mindset of East Germans and
the changes underway.
Even at Oxford, "students
might speak the same language
but not be saying the same
thing," said Geoffrey Tyack,
director of the Oxford program.
Although Oxford is the only pro
gram in which students do not
live with families, Tyack said it
allows participants other opportu
nities for exchange.
"Students can play sports, par
ticipate in drama or in choir in

conjunction with the colleges at
Oxford," he said.
Internships and research
opportunities increase students
access to the culture, while teach
ing them about their goals, many
directors said. "Our internship
programs make students much
better prepared to see what kind
of environment and career they
want to work in," Kramer said.
"Getting students involved in
the production of knowledge is
important, because they can have
a say in what they are learning,"
MacDougall said.
The Moscow program is look
ing to expand its horizons by also
providing internship opportuni
ties, maybe at such institutions as
the Carnegie Endowment or at
joint-venture companies. It is also
looking to add tutorials or
research opportunities soon.
Research begun at overseas
centers often leads to other
internships or long-term projects.
"Many students produce honors
theses which come out of their
research-related internships,"
Kramer said.
At Oxford, through a tutorial
system, students can choose
almost exactly what they would
like to study, Tyack said. In this
way, "Oxford can cater to almost
any academic interest," he added.
"If we do something in the cen
ters, it is to prepare citizens of the
world," Fuenzalida said.
Kramer added, "Many stu
dents come back and they all say
that their perspectives have been
expanded."
