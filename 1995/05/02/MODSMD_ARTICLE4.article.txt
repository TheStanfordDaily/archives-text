A major ideological force dur
ing the Cold War era, 82-year-old
Stefan Thomas Possony died
April 26 in his Los Altos home
from complications resulting
from a massive stroke.
Possony was the creator of for
mer President Ronald Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, com
monly known as "Star Wars."
A Hoover Institution Senior
Fellow, Possony was praised in a
statement by Hoover Director
John Raisian for being "one of
America's most influential schol
ars in the field of international se
curity affairs."
He offered "critical insight and
understanding of World War II
and the tumultuous era since. My
colleagues and I greatly valued
and benefited from his long asso
ciation with the Hoover Institu
tion," said Raisian.
Hoover Senior Fellow Peter
Duignan worked closely with
Possony during his time at the in
stitution. He recalled Possony's
"distinguished record" and said
he "revitalized" Hoover with his
ideas.
"He was one of the scholars
who was a major underpinning of
Cold War ideology," said Duig
nan. "His authority and predic
tions were on par with [George]
Kennan."

Like Kennan — who authored
the theory of containment to ad
vocate holding communism in
one part of the world — Possony
predicted that the Soviet Union
would collapse due to internal
nationalist tensions. But while
Kennan advocated containment
and the selective use of American
resources to defend areas of na
tional interest, Possony said
America should have fought
communist threats wherever
they appeared.
Born in 1913 in Vienna, Aus
tria, Possony received his doctor
ate in economics and history from
the University of Vienna in 1935.
At the start of World War 11, he
served in the French military and
gathered intelligence on German
bombing targets.
After escaping to the United
States as the Nazis advanced into
France in 1940, Possony joined
the Institute for Advanced Study
as a Carnegie Fellow at Princeton
University. He then worked on
numerous government intelli
gence projects before joining
Hoover in 1961.
In 1983, the International
Strategic Studies Association cre
ated, in his honor, the Possony
Prize for Peace.
The Hoover archives will
maintain a large collection of his
papers on military science, inter
national relations and Soviet for
eign policy.
