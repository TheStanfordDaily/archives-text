# Graduation procession may go on
## Protests prompt rethinking; noon rally planned for today 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Graduating seniors will once again be sitting in
the grass of Stanford Stadium — opening up the pos
sibility of the return of the traditional irreverent
Commencement procession.
As a result of backlash from seniors angered by
last week's decision to cancel the procession and have
students sit in the bleachers during Commencement
exercises, University administrators have agreed to
restore the traditional seating plan and possibly the
procession if enough students show interest.
The four senior class presidents met with admin-

istrators yesterday to discuss the fu
ture of graduation and the group de
cided that seniors must be seated by
9:45 a.m., said Terry Shepard, direc
tor of University communications.
The stage will be placed farther back,
as has been done in the past, and the
graduating seniors will sit on the
grass.
Students will be allowed to hold
the procession if they so choose. To

discuss the issue, an open town meeting for all stu
dents will be held in the Ujamaa Large Lounge at 9
p.m. tonight, said Senior Class President Sarah
Marie Martin.
The class presidents have two weeks to let the Uni
versity know if students want a procession this year.
"If students want it to be like last year, they can,"
said Eric Chen, senior class president.
In spite of the productive meeting, a protest will be
held at noon in White Plaza today. Students will read
statements and letters expressing their feelings on
the issue, said senior Greg Siegel, organizer of the
rally.
Eventually, Siegel predicted that the crowd will
march over to University President Gerhard
Casper's office to present him with a petition, which
was started two days ago. The Stanford Band plans to
perform at the event.
If students opt to hold a procession this year, they
will be responsible for informing their parents of the
change since the University has already mailed out
invitations with the 9:45 a.m. starting time. The pro
cession would begin at 9 a.m., Shepard said.
Yesterday's meeting was sparked by the numer
ous responses the senior class presidents received fol
lowing announcement of the change. The presidents
said they received nearly 50 e-mail messages and 50
phone calls from seniors upset over the change.

According to the class presi
dents, the University was open to
the change. "They were really
willing to work with us. ... It
didn't seem the University was
trying to crack down on us," Mar
tin said, referring to the usual
hoopla during the procession.

The presidents said they felt
the University did not anticipate
the outpouring of hostility against
the change.
"It seemed to me that there
was some misunderstanding,"
Shepard said. "We want to
arrange a Commencement that
[seniors] are happy with."
The University hoped to short
en Commencement and also make
the ceremony more intimate by
bringing the stage closer to the

stands, Shepard said. The proces
sion was eliminated because of
space constraints, not because the
University opposes its rowdiness,
he added.
To bring back the procession,
student input will be critical,
Martin said. Lois Wagner, direc
tor of University events, said it "is
really in the hands of the senior
class."
The senior class presidents said
they are attempting to reach the

full student body — including
underclassmen, since this year's
decision may affect future gradua
tion ceremonies. "Not everyone is
going to be happy," Chen said,
adding that "we will try and get
the most [people] happy."
Although this year's procession
problems may be solved, the situa
tion is still unclear for next year.
According to Martin, there may be
additional meetings to determine
next year's policy.
