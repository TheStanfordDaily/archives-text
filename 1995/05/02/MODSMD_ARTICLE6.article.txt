# A 						first, but not last, glimpse at medical school
## Youth medicine program grads are now pre-meds at Stanford 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
Senior Angel Fabian is one of hundreds of pre
meds at Stanford. But he got here a little earlier
than the rest.
When he was in high school, Fabian participat
ed for two summers in the Stanford Medical
Youth Science Program, a seven-year-old pro
gram to encourage underprivileged high school
students from Northern California to pursue in
terests in science and medicine.
"It was a wonderful program — bringing stu
dents, low-income minority students, on campus
who had an interest in the medical field. It was

empowering and motivational,"
he said.
Fabian credits the program
with helping him excel at Stan
ford.
"It helped me become familiar
with the campus and getting into
college and surviving college," he
said. "The mentorship already
there with pre-med and medical
students was a lot of help like
wise."
Students in the program spend
a summer on campus, attending
lectures given by Stanford profes
sors, performing research projects,
volunteering at Stanford Hospital
and taking field trips to places like
the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Stu
dents even perform the same
anatomy labs as first-year medical
students.
The first few groups to go
through the program are graduat
ing from college now, and some are
even attending medical school,
said program coordinator Marilyn
Winkleby.
Another Stanford junior, Imel
da Gonzalez, completed the pro
gram in 1990 while attending Sali
nas Valley High School.
"It offered an introduction to
college life and proved to me that
schools like Stanford were accessi
ble to us and that we could apply
and get in," Gonzalez said. "It pro
vided motivation. If I could suc
ceed in a program — I could do it
at a college level."
Twenty-two students from an
applicant pool of 360 are selected.
The students selected are from
low-income backgrounds with a
barrier to education, such as fami
ly problems or divorced parents.
They also have expressed an inter
est in science or medicine.
"The goal of our program is to
introduce low-income deserving

students into the fields of science
and medicine, to give them confi
dence, other options and opportu
nities," said senior Bobby Yeh, the
program's co-director.
"I think the academics are
incredible. At Stanford, students
can see lecturers and realize that
Stanford is not out of their reach
and that they can do anything they
want," Yeh added.
Returning counselor Pamela
Shenouda, a senior, said the pro
gram gives participants confi
dence. "They spend these five
weeks at Stanford University and
they see that they can do it," she
said.
The program is very successful,
with almost 100 percent of stu
dents attending four-year schools,
including many Ivy League col
leges, Winkleby said.
"A lot of students come to the
program not thinking in terms of
going to Stanford or Harvard, even
though they have great grades.
They haven't realized that oppor
tunities exist," she said.
Former participants say differ
ent parts of the program appealed
to them.
Gonzalez extolled the virtues of
dorm living. "The best part was
the residential life," she said. "We
lived in the Roth house where we
had discussions carried on in dorm
rooms and hallways, and learned a
lot about people."
"The participants learned a lot
about other cultures, other peo
ple," Fabian said. "It was a great
learning and growing experience. I
never had lived with people from
other cultures before."
Shenouda added that the coun
selors received their own reward.
"The best part is seeing the kids
finally getting what they deserve
— the opportunity to concentrate
on academics and friendships and
not having to worry about bringing
a paycheck home or caring for their
younger siblings because their par
ents are trying to make a living."
