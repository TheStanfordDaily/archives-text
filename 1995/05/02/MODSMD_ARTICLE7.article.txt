The annual Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Days (BGLAD) celebration kicks
off tonight at 8 p.m. in Annenberg Auditorium
when keynote speaker Michelangelo Signorile
— best-selling author of the novel "Queer in
America" — will talk about "being out and
proud" in today's world.
BGLAD runs through May 19 and is aimed
at increasing awareness of gay and lesbian is
sues in the Stanford and Bay Area communi

ties, said junior David Barba, chair of BGLAD
'95.
"We want to showcase our community to
the straight community. The events that we
have planned are for us and about us," Barba
said.
BGLAD's emphasis over the past few years
has been on the complexities of identity and ex
pression in the gay community, according to
Troy Gilbert, assistant director of student ac
tivities and adviser to the Lesbian, Gay and Bi
sexual Community Center.

"It's wonderful that we have a committed
community that puts on a program like this
every year. BGLAD is really about lesbian, gay
and bisexual identities and their manifesta
tions in society, art and literature," Gilbert
said.
Barba said the diverse topics the schedule
covers this year exemplify the relevance of art
forms, politics and health to gay, lesbian and
bisexual issues — centered around the theme
of coming out and being out in
1990s society.
Featured events include a
health series that will focus on
women and HIV / AIDS, relation
ships and body image.
"We're really trying to hit
some of the cutting-edge health
issues and shed some light on
their emotional and psychological
aspects," said organizer Chris
Kodama, a senior.
In addition, several lectures
and workshops led by nationally
acclaimed figures will probe a
wide range of topics, ranging
from trans-genderism to resume
writing and interviewing from a
gay perspective.
"I'm enthusiastic about the
entire schedule. I think there is
something for everyone and for
all tastes," Barba said.
Activist and literary critic Jew
elle Gomez will read from her
works — many of which have
appeared in anthologies of lesbian

fiction — on May 10 at 7 p.m. in
Cypress South, Tresidder Union.
Matt Coles, national director of
the Lesbian and Gay Rights Pro
ject of the American Civil Liber
ties Union, will discuss military
and constitutional policies
regarding lesbians, gays and
bisexuals at the Law School on
May 11 at 8 p.m.
BGLAD events will include
Stanford faculty as well. Asst.
English Prof. Sharon Holland
will lead a seminar on the inter
section of race and homosexuality
in black poetry on May 18.
An art exhibit, a community
service workshop and a comedy
night are also among the activi
ties planned during the program,
which lasts for two-and-a-half
weeks. A final dance at Elliot Pro
gram Center on May 19 will con
clude this year's festivities.
"We want to fill the gap that
exists because of the lack of Uni
versity-sponsored education on
[lesbian, gay and bisexual issues].
BGLAD is a testimony that [les
bian, gay and bisexual] issues
affect how all of us look at life and
interpret life," Gilbert said.
