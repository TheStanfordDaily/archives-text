Bicycle thieves caught
Two Hay ward men were arrested last
week on suspicion of stealing almost 30 bicy
cles from campus.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, police seized 15 bicycle frames in
various stages of disrepair and 14 functional
bicycles — most of them mountain bikes
ranging in cost from $200 to $600. Many of
the bicycles still were attached to steel bike
racks.
Stanford Police Deputy Jeff Bell arrested
David Andrew Aguilar, 28, and David Ray
mond Wright, 30, at about 9:30 a.m. last
Thursday on Stanford Avenue near Bowdoin
Street.
At the scene of the arrest, police found
three bicycles in the suspects' 1976 brown
Cadillac. Later that day, Stanford Police
Detectives Tim Schreiner and Mark Swine
ford went to Wright's house, where they dis
covered what police refer to as a bike "chop
shop," where stolen goods are stored and
prepared for sale, Niemeyer said.
Not only did Wright have a large shed in
his backyard where he was refurbishing the
stolen bicycles, he also constructed his own
bike rack using all the stolen pieces of Stan
ford bike racks, Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said police have been investi
gating Wright for the last few months. On
Jan. 28 at about 6 a.m., freshman Kailee
Wong saw Wright loading several bicycles
into his black truck, Niemeyer said.
Wong, a member of the football team,
asked Wright what he was doing. When
Wong didn't receive a satisfactory answer,

he told Wright to put the bicycles back,
according to Niemeyer. Wong also memo
rized the truck's license plate number, which
he later gave the police.
"We didn't have enough information at
the time to charge fWright], but we've been
investigating him," Niemeyer said.
Students also reported other sightings of
the men.
Junior Nicki Harris, a resident of Roth
House, said she saw two men in a brown
Cadillac "driving really slowly by" last Tues
day at about 10:30 p.m. She reported the
incident to the police.
In addition, Harris said that on Thursday
at about 9:30 a.m., the two men pulled their
car into Roth's driveway. A bicycle was in the
back seat of their car and the car's trunk was
also slightly ajar.
Earlier on Thursday, at about 6 a.m., a
student reported to the police that he had
seen two men loading three or four bicycles
into a truck.
Wright and Aguilar were booked at Santa
Clara County Main Jail on Thursday. As of
Friday, Aguilar was being held in lieu of
$6,000 bail in addition to a no-bail warrant
for violation of an earlier probation. Wright
was being held on $4,000 bail.
Suspicious package delivered
A heavy package with no return address
was delivered to a Stanford residence on
Tuesday, prompting fears of the re-emer
gence of the "Unabomber" — and a call to
the Stanford Police.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul

Niemeyer, the department's bomb expert
was dispatched to the Stanford residence
and the suspicious package was X-rayed.
The package turned out to be a picture
frame.
The "Unabomber," named for his early
choice of university and airline officials as
targets, was involved with a recent attack
against a former Bay Area forest official.
Edward Teller, a Hoover Institution
senior research fellow, was the intended
recipient of the package, Niemeyer said.
Patty Weible — who serves as the secre
tary of Teller's wife and was present when
the package was delivered — said she
thought it was best to call the police, espe
cially considering Teller's notoriety as the
inventor of the hydrogen bomb.
The package was heavy and crudely
wrapped, Weible said. In addition, the pack
age was addressed to "Mr. Edward Teller"
rather than "Dr. Edward Teller."
"It looked very, very suspicious," Weible
said. "The man who delivered it just left... .
There was nothing to sign like there normal
ly is with a UPS delivery.
"We weren't expecting the picture
frame," Weible added. "It turned out to be a
surprise gift from a family friend."
Teller was out of the country at the time
of the package's delivery.
Niemeyer added that campus police and
postal officials are warning people to be wary
of suspicious packages. Tips for identifying a
mail bomb include excessive postage, dispro
portionate weight, no return address and
misspelled names and titles.
