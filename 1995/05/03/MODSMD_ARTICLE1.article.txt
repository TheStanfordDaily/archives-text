# Protesting 'party poopers'
## Seniors use nudity, beer to demonstrate commitment to restoring traditional Commencement procession 
### Marie Rosencrantz Contributing writer 
Running naked around White Plaza yesterday,
Nikki Bergstrom was only one of more than 100 se
niors who in one way or another showed their com
mitment to continue the traditional Commence
ment procession that was canceled last week by Uni
versity administrators.
During the noon rally, more than 600 signatures
were collected in support of the procession.
"The administration has said that if they see
enough support for the procession they will rein
state it, and that is why we are here. It is ours and we
are entitled to it," said senior Quinn Moo, one of the
rally's organizers.

Late last night, the four senior class presidents
held a meeting to follow upon the noon rally. During
the meeting, Senior Class President Sarah Marie
Martin confirmed that the University administra
tion has conceded to student concerns and agreed to
allow graduating seniors to hold the procession if
they so choose.
A committee was formed to seek student input as
to what kind of procession students really want. The
17 committee members are scheduled to present
their findings to administrators in two weeks.
"Judging from the response from my class, my
suggestion is to leave the ceremony exactly as it
was," Martin said. "I think that the University un-

derestimated how much students
care about this."
A crowd gathered in White
Plaza yesterday afternoon to listen
to Moo and other students who
expressed their rage over the can
cellation of the procession.
Although the meeting resembled a
celebration more than a protest —

with lots of beer flowing and a per
formance by the Stanford Band —
it was clear that the student orga
nizers got their message across.
Chants such as "We back the
walk!" and "Party poopers!" could
be heard from the group. Many
students attached silver-colored
ribbons to their clothing to support
the procession.
Laura de Ney, a senior who
attended the rally, hinted that
seniors will react very strongly if
the procession fails to happen.

"The big plan is that all seniors
strip during [University Presi
dent Gerhard] Casper's speech,"
she said. "They can have orga
nized chaos or they can have
rebellion."
The four senior class presidents
met with University administra
tors Monday to discuss last week's
cancellation of the Commence
ment procession. Administrators
agreed to reinstate the procession
if enough students support it.
"We have now seen that people

do support (the procession)," said
Senior Class President Eric Chen.
According to the senior class
presidents, the administration's
decision to eliminate the tradition
al procession was part of an effort
to shorten the Commencement
ceremonies and to move the event
stage closer to the audience.
"I think it was never the inten
tion to lose the spontaneity and fun
of Commencement day," said
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe.

However, many students con
sider the procession — during
which graduating students in pre
vious years have engaged in
wrestling matches, danced around
in costumes and even brought
inflatable pools to the Stanford
Stadium — as one of the highlights
of Commencement Weekend.
"We just want to sit in the mid
dle of the field, run around and cel
ebrate in our way," said senior
Charles Goodan, one of the rally's
organizers.
