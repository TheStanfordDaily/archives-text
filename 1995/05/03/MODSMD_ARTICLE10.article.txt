Two arrested in bombing case
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - FBI agents hunt
ing the elusive "John Doe 2" raided a Missouri
motel yesterday, capturing two men who traveled
a path of cheap motels from Arizona to Oklahoma
that paralleled the movements of bombing sus
pect Timothy McVeigh.
Gary Alan Land and Robert Jacks — objects of
an FBI all-points bulletin — were arrested at day
break in Carthage, Mo., as material witnesses in
the Oklahoma City bombing.
Land, a 35-year-old drifter with a record of
petty crimes, bears a passing resemblance to the
heavyset, square-jawed figure in the sketch of
John Doe 2, wanted in the nation's worst domes
tic terrorist attack.
Asked if Land could be the muscular, tattooed
John Doe 2, FBI spokesman Dan Vogel said: "We
don't know that. We have not determined

whether he is or not."
Foster testifies to Senate
WASHINGTON (AP) — Blending poignant
details of a life in medicine with a firm defense of
his integrity, Henry W. Foster battled yesterday
to salvage his nomination for surgeon general. "I
am a doctor Who delivers babies," he told lawmak
ers probing his views on abortion.
At a day-long Senate hearing, Foster pledged to
lead a national campaign against teen pregnancies
if confirmed.
After three months of controversy, Foster slid
into the witness chair with a pledge to "set the
record straight." He conceded earlier understat
ing the number of abortions he performed in four
decades as an obstetrician but said it was an "hon
est mistake" made without a complete review of
the records.
