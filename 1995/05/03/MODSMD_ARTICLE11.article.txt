# Clinton to let in Cubans
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
sudden reversal of policy, President
Clinton agreed yesterday to allow
some 20,000 Cubans into the Unit
ed States after months of detention
at Guantanamo Bay. But he said
any more Cubans who flee their
country will be forcibly returned
home.
Cuban-American leaders
expressed delight that people
detained at the U.S. naval base in
Cuba would be permitted to
migrate, but they complained bit
terly that future refugees would
be turned away.
Some Republicans accused Clin
ton of shutting the doors on a safe
haven that for 35 years has beck
oned Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro's
communist state.
"How sad it is that the United
States is now viewed as an accom

plice in Castro's repression of the
Cuban people," said Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee.
Answering Helms' charges on
the Senate floor, Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., said Clinton's decision "was
a difficult one." While endorsing
Clinton's policy, Graham said the
return of future refugees to Cuba
"causes great concern to many peo
ple, including myself."
There were indications of a seri
ous rift in the administration over
the new policy. Dennis Hays, the
State Department's coordinator for
Cuban affairs, and his deputy,
Nancy Mason, asked to be reas
signed in protest of the decision to
repatriate fleeing Cubans, officials
said.
Hays headed the U.S. delegation

to three rounds of talks with Cuban
officials on migration issues, most
recently two weeks ago in New
York.
The decision to admit refugees
from Guantanamo stemmed large
ly from fears of civil disturbances
by Cubans frustrated by their cap
tivity and angry about a policy that
until now excluded them from the
United States. U.S. officials say
20,916 Cubans are now being held
at Guantanamo.
The White House said that "rel
atively few" of the Cubans in Guan
tanamo would not qualify for
admission to the United States;
those deemed ineligible will be
returned to Havana. The remain
der will be gradually admitted to
the United States under a policy
that allows up to 20,000 legal
entrants each year from Cuba
