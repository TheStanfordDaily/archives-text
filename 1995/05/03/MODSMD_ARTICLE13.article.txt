University's plans to ax
Commencement antics
are very poorly conceived

«T' m as mad as hell, and I'm
I not going to take it any
JLmore," shouted Peter
Finch in Network.
All across campus the past few
days, students have been thinking
and talking in the same vein.
The reason? The University's
announcement that the Com
mencement procession is can
celled — an announcement and
decision that were poorly timed,
poorly executed, poorly thought
out and just plain poor.
University officials say that the
ceremony was too long and the
stage too far out in the football
field. So they deleted the proces
sional and moved students into
the stands. Most students don't
buy it, and believe that officials
are embarassed by some of the
antics of the graduates. An atmo
sphere of hostility has grown. Stu
dents are on the move.
Perhaps not since the Rodney
King protests — certainly not
since last year's hunger strike —
has an issue so ignited and unit
ed the students on this campus.
Is this a sad commentary on the
priorities of Stanford students?
Maybe. But it is also a strong
signal to the University that stu
dents do care about the pro
gramming for them and are will
ing to take an active role when
something they care about gets
cut.
Yes, the procession is silly.
That's just the point. Commence
ment is not just a beginning — as
unoriginal minds love to point out
— but a chance to release all the
exuberant energy of having
climbed that Stanford mountain.
Commencement without proces
sion is like sex without orgasm; it's
nice, sure, but lacks its climactic
moment. Tossing hats in the air,
despite its Freudian significance,

is not enough. Students want clo
sure. We've done the work, we
want to celebrate, and do so in
front of our friends in the stands.
So students have begun to
sound their message. Now Uni
versity officials — who either
ignorantly or callously extermi
nated the "wacky walk" with the
complicity of the senior class pres
idents — are listening. After
receiving a flood of phone calls
and e-mail opposing the change,
administrators have agreed to let
the graduates sit on the field once
again. The procession is also open
for question once more. Students
have two weeks to let our feelings
be known in an effort to bring it
back.
Yesterday's noon rally and
night meeting were good starts,
but more work is needed. All stu
dents should speak up to let the
University know we want the pro
cession for ourselves and our pos
terity.
Start by phoning, writing or e
mailing the President's Office;
Lois Wagner, director of Universi
ty Events; and the senior class
presidents: Eric Chen, Paula
Strange Dybdahl, Kevin Harring
ton and Sarah-Marie Martin. Or e
mail procession@cs.stanford.edu
and get them all at once.
Next, wear a shiny silver ribbon
to show your solidarity with the
movement. Seniors, get younger
students involved, too. And don't
forget to wear something shiny
and silver to graduation to show
senior power.
Also try writing a letter to the
President's Office and the Devel
opment Office saying that you will
not donate any money to Stanford,
ever, if there is no procession. This
one hits 'em where it counts.
And finally, if all else fails and
Commencement rolls around, pro
ceed. Proceed with the procession.
Walk out of the stands, onto the
field and take a victory lap. Wres
tle, slide, toss inflatable toys and
have fun. Know that we've earned
it, and we'll take it.
See you on the field.
