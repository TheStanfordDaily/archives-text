## Graduation should be fun 
### 
RIDICULOUS. UNBELIEVABLE.
An abomination. These are just a
few of the choice remarks which I
have heard in the past few days from dif
ferent students on campus. No, they
were not talking about the continued
lack of a Taco Bell at Tresidder or Aman
Verjee's most recent article in the Stan
ford Review. It was a catastrophe of even
more immense proportions: the cancella
tion of the traditional procession at Com
mencement.
Although deep down Stanford stu
dents are just as driven and focused as
our counterparts in the Ivy League, we
like to believe that we have a much more
carefree and relaxed attitude about our
studies and our career goals. Our Califor
nia location certainly lends itself to that
picture. What better way to portray this
image to the stuffed shirts in Boston and
New Haven than to buck tradition at
graduation and actually have some fun?
What other university actually allows its
students to play around on a Slip 'N Slide
in their caps and gowns or pop cham
pagne corks on the field before the cere
mony even begins?
Fortunately or not, I had the opportu
nity to attend commencement at the Uni
versity of Washington last June. Of
course, I was proud of my brother for
finally finishing school and I wanted to
see him receive his diploma. After five
and-a-half years and a number of pot
holes, my parents figured we'd all better

be there to take pictures and prove to the
relatives that he was actually graduating.
But I would be hard pressed to think of a
more boring spectacle than the one I wit
nessed that June afternoon.
The University of Washington is a
huge school. Luckily, it splits up its cere
monies in order to keep each one under
about four hours or so. After scrambling
for seats in the wooden bleachers of the
basketball arena and then waiting for
another hour, the audience was forced to
watch several thousand graduates
march into the arena in neat little rows
of four and calmly take their seats in
long rows of chairs. There were no
games, no laughter. Yes, there were a
few smiley faces or Christmas lights on
the caps of some students, but they were
few and far between. Somebody even
blew bubbles, which probably caused
quite a stir within the school's adminis
tration.
As for the ceremony itself, it will suf
fice to say that I read over 100 pages of a
not very interesting book during it. Some
students halfheartedly tossed their caps
into the air when the president
announced that the Class of '94 was offi
cially graduated. And then they filed out
of the basketball arena in the same order
ly fashion in which they entered.
Is this what we want to happen at
Stanford? I know, I know. UW is a big,
state school and our Commencement will
hopefully never become quite so imper

sonal. But with the eradication of the
procession, we are definitely on the road
to this sort of situation. I just don't
understand why the administration feels
that that the procession reflects poorly
on our academic prestige. Do they really
think that the incredible accomplish
ments and discoveries made by Stanford
students and researchers over the past
century can not stand on their own as
proof of the excellence of this university?
As for our so-called senior class presi
dents, they agreed to this decision auto
cratically, without gauging the opinion of
the class they assume to represent. I did
not receive any form of notification about
the decision-making process and neither
did any other senior I have talked to. The
presidents should acknowledge the over
whelming rejection of this proposition by
the senior class and fight to restore the
procession.
Like every other member of the senior
class, I have paid upwards of $100,000 to
Stanford and spent thousands of hours
studying in order to receive that little
piece of paper on June 18th. Give us a
break! Shouldn't we be allowed to have a
little fun on the last day before the real
world finally hits us?

After this ridiculous decision is reversed,
Amanda plans to run around the track
naked during Commencement. Maybe.
