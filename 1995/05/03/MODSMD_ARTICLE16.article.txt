In wake of bombing, never stop trying to eradicate hate

WEDNESDAY MARKED the one
week anniversary of the horrific
bombing of a federal building in
Oklahoma City. Seven days after the
tragedy, rescue workers finally reached
the building's second floor day care cen
ter. Viewing the pictures of dying chil
dren and grieving parents has conveyed
the horrors of this event all too clearly.
Here at Stanford, we often feel
removed from this type of violence.
After all, in our bubble of a world, the
most frequent crime is bicycle theft. Yet

the world's grim realities rarely touch
this campus directly, very few of us will
remain in this safe enclave forever.
As the Oklahoma bombing indicates,
no one is safe from the random violence
of our world. Murders are no longer
confined to international terrorism or
ghetto riots. Violence touches each seg
ment of our society, from commuters
on a New York subway to secretaries in
Boston abortion clinics. The proximity
of these recent tragedies amplify their
effect. Few people can identify with the

victims of Rwanda's horrific genocide
yet anyone can envision her mother rid
ing a New York subway or imagine her
child playing in a day care center.
Sadly, many of us self-interested
beings feel such grief about the Okla
homa blast because we can imagine
ourselves as one of the victims. In addi
tion to our sympathy, we feel fear —
fear that we are not immune to such
terrors. Whatever your personal
response, I urge everyone to take a
moment to reflect on the senseless

tragedy that occurred in Oklahoma City
and the other senseless violence that
plagues our world.
In Oklahoma, the most innocent of
all victims, children, suffered for the
hate sewn by their elders. I have no pol
icy prescription for current or future
leaders except this: Understand the
extent of this tragedy and never, ever
stop searching for a way to eradicate
the hate that inspired it.
