# Stanford should cancel its development plans for Stanford West site
## 
### 
In your editorial "A greener Stan
ford" on April 24,1 am surprised that
you did not mention the best way Stan
ford could help the environment — stop
its obsession with development. Stan
ford is presently trying once more to
push through its plans to develop Stan
ford West. This will destroy the last
unspoilt stretch of local land along San
Francisquito Creek.
To me, Stanford's charter is to teach
and promote research — not to engage
in real estate development. Stanford
obviously disagrees, given its emphasis
on development. Its plans for Stanford
West have no educational purpose —
expanding the Shopping Center and
building rental housing is pure com
mercial development. (So much for
Stanford's tax-exempt status!) And
what other university has a full-time
public relations apologist constantly
defending its plans for further develop
ment?
When I read that Stanford is going
to spend $5 million to upgrade its light
ing system, yet continue its plans to
destroy its remaining local unbuilt

spaces, I wonder where its priorities lie.
More energy-efficient lighting is obvi
ously a good thing, and I wish Stanford
well on its public relations campaign to
portray itself as environmentally car
ing. Personally, I would like to see it
make some hard calls, and cancel its
plans for Stanford West. That would
show that it really does care about the
environment.
