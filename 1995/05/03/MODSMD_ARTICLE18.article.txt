# Editorial contained errors; science core would be but one option to fulfill DRs
## 
### 
I am writing to correct the errors in
your editorial 'Scientific knowledge' of
Wednesday, April 27. You misunder
stand the recommendations in the CUE
report, and what the Design Committee
for the core course in Engineering,
Mathematics, and Science has proposed.
The core course will be one option by
which students may fulfill the distribu
tion requirements in Areas 4, 5, and 6,
not a replacement for those areas. It will
not be required of non-science majors.
When the new courses begin, all stu
dents will still be able to satisfy the DRs
in the technical areas as they do now, by
taking three courses, one in each area,

that are certified to meet the require
ments. (The CUE has also recommended
changes here, but this is independent of
their recommendation to develop the
core courses. Our committee has so far
not considered these additional changes
to the DR system, which would, in any
event, require action by the Faculty Sen
ate.) In particular, anyone considering a
major in the sciences or in engineering
would likely satisfy some or all of the
reqirements early on. If they decide later
that their interests lie in the humanities
or social sciences they would not have to
begin again with one of the tracks in the
core.
