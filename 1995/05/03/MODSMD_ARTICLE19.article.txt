# Athletes should have to maintain the same course load as others
## 
### 
Appreciation for Stanford athletes is
misplaced when it extends to excusing
them from having to handle the same
course load as other students. It's true
that their sports take up a lot of their
time; but those hours ought to come out
of their extracurricular time. If that
means that they have less time for par

tying, dating or just hanging out, then
that's only a reasonable price to be paid
for all the benefits they earn by being
on sports teams. Besides, athletes tend
to be quite disciplined, and their team
commitments only reinforce this; in
most cases, they are fully able to do
their sport, take a full course load, and
still have time left over. Harvard, for
example, makes no special academic
allowances for their athletes, and the
athletes do just fine — in fact, when as
an undergrad I played on teams there, it
seemed that, typically, the academic
performance of those who dropped off
teams due to perceived time pressures
actually suffered once they lost the dis
cipline that the rigorous daily practice
schedule imposed upon them.
Finally, if Stanford cuts athletes
some academic slack, it ought to do the
same for all students who can show
that they take part in time-consuming
extracurricular activities: dancers, writ
ers, those doing community service,
even Daily editors — not to mention
those students who hold down jobs dur
ing the quarter! Athletes, as admirable
as they are, deserve no special break —
or rather, no special penalty of not
being pushed to get a full academic
experience out of their years at Stan
ford.
