# Hospital cuts $28 million
## Eliminates 150 jobs, attempts to increase revenue 
### Carolyn Sleeth 
Stanford Hospital will cut more than $28 million
from its 1995-96 budget by eliminating 150 hospital
jobs and implementing a variety of recommendations
aimed at generating $6 million in new revenue, hospi
tal officials announced earlier this week.
The cost reductions are an attempt to make the hos
pital as "lean as possible," said Felix Barthelemy, direc
tor of human resources for Stanford Health Services.
Of the 150 eliminated positions, most were the re
sult of attrition with only 74 people losing their jobs —
58 people will be laid off involuntarily and another 16
will take early retirement. The hospital is avoiding
more layoffs by retraining staff members and moving
them into growing areas. The hospital has about 4,000
employees.
Thirty percent of layoffs will come through the con
solidation of departments and the elimination of dated
services. In addition, management areas are being
trimmed and 125 staff positions will be eliminated.
"I am proud of the staff for willing to be flexible,"
said Malinda Mitchell, chief operating officer for SHS,
which operates the hospital, Stanford University Clin
ic and affiliated group practices.
The generation of new revenue will come from the

implementation of more outpatient services, especially
in the ambulatory surgery and treatment areas.
Key goals in reducing costs are not only to keep pa
tients satisfied but to actually improve patient care,
Mitchell said.
"Most of the recommendations come from the peo
ple in patient care. Physicians on the task force evalu
ate the recommendations at quality checks to see
whether the changes will affect patient care," Mitchell
said. "We monitor both patient satisfaction and com
plaints through surveys and there has been a general
rise in patient satisfaction.
"At the same time we've had to make these changes,
the staff has continued to be compassionate and re
sponsive to patients," she added.
This year marks the sixth year of budget reductions
under the hospital's Operations Improvement Pro
gram. Approximately I,ooojobs — 311 through layoffs
— will have been cut in the six years of the program.
No layoffs will occur in bedside nursing, which was
drastically affected in the earlier years of the Opera
tions Improvement Program.

very positively and they have a good understanding of
