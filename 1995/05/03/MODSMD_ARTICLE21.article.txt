Q:WiU drinking milk and orange juice make
you sick?
— anonymous
A:I don't know about the reader who sent this
one in but my parents told me this one all the
time. They even had one data point to back it
up... one time my sister puked in the morning, and
my parents said, "Look, she just ate a bowl of cereal
and a gloss of orange juice." Not the kind of scientif
ic evidence the Bug usually looks for, but I was
young then.
So tonight, in the name of science, I took the
plunge. Sixteen ounces of milk, washed down with
another sixteen ounces of OJ. By the end of this arti
cle, I should be able to tell you whether it's had any
effect or not.
In fact, it shouldn't make any difference. There's

no reason that it would make you sick, at least
according to the Stanford Medical Center. No cases
of early morning food poisoning from people who go
overboard with the balanced breakfast thing. (Of
course, they couldn't tell me whether I could safely
generate tremendous burps by eating baking soda
and letting it react with triS acid in my stomach. I
assume that means the answer is no.)
So why does the rumor abound? Some people told
me they thought it was because the milk would cur
dle when it mixes with the OJ. This can't be true,
because you can mix milk and OJ in glass and it
doesn't curdle. You can get it to curdle if you heat it
up to boiling on the stove, but that takes some seri
ous heat. Also, there's a lot more acid in your stom
ach than in a glass of orange juice, so the milk would
curdle down there before it curdled with the OJ.
And think about Juice Club. Half of those drinks
have dairy products mixed with orange juice. No bad
vibes there.
The only way it could cause some gastro-intesti
nal hubbub is psychological If you have some taste
aversion to milk and orange juice, the thought of
what you just consumed could make you feel sick to
your stomach.
On a similar topic, many people have asked why
orange juice tastes bad after you've brushed your
teeth. In fact, there is an ingredient in toothpaste
that actually affects the chemical receptors in your
tongue, altering the sensation of certain flavors.
Orange juice happens to be particularly affected by
this monkey wrench in the taste buds.
Well, I'm feeling no ill harm from that OJ and
milk, so we'll go on to the next question.
Q:What causes heartburn?
— anonymous
A:Other than Food Service, you mean? The
basic root of heartburn is acid from your stom
ach coming back up the esophagus. While the
stomach has an extra-tough lining of mucous to pro
tect it from acid, the esophagus is not quite so well
prepared, and you can get a burning sensation.
So, you ask, what causes this "acid reflux," as it's
known in academic circles? Basically, there is a cir
cular muscle, the esophageal sphincter, which keeps
things from traveling back up the way they came
down. Under certain conditions, this sphincter
relaxes at the wrong time, leading to heartburn.
This relaxation is most often caused by eating too
much food, particularly foods high in fat. Unfortu
nately, it can also be triggered by caffeine, alcohol,
chocolate and nicotine.
It is interesting that nicotine is implicated here.
Someone once asked me why they suddenly had to
go to the bathroom if they smoked a cigarette after
eating dinner. Although 1 had never heard of this, I
eventually found that nicotine does act to relax cer
tain muscles in the digestive system. Thus it's possi
ble that smoking a cigarette loosens up the lower
sphincter, which controls excretion. The fact that
nicotine relaxes the upper sphincter lends a little
support to this theory.
Most people's solution to heartburn is antacids.
These are aluminum-based products that actually
neutralize the acid, both in your esophagus and in
your stomach. No acid, no heartburn.
If you're really having problems, there are pre
scription drugs available. Rather than destroying
the acid after it's made, they block the chemical mes
sengers that tell your stomach cells to excrete acid.
Fortunately, your digestive system works perfectly
fine with these lower levels of acid in the stomach, so
there's no harm done.
Incidentally, almost everybody gets some acid
reflux — it's just that some people are more sensi
tive to acid in the esophagus than others.
