# Storing the Mona Lisa
## Scientists explore a holographic future 
### Steven Kasapi 
In August of last year, researchers at
Stanford demonstrated the first digital
holographic storage device. Using off
the-shelf optical components, the Stan
ford group stored a digitized picture of
the Mona Lisa holographically and read
it back.
Holographic data storage has been a
dream since the 1960s because the
potential payoff is enormous. Whole
libraries of information could be stored
in a crystal the size of a sugar cube and
any part of it could be accessed in a frac
tion of a second.
But whether or not holographic stor
age goes to market will depend strongly
on how well it competes with existing
storage technology.
The information bottleneck
Text, photographs, sound and video
are rapidly consuming modern storage
media and pushing even the fastest
devices to their limits.
Cable and phone companies will soon
allow customers to view movies on
demand. However, making thousands of
videos, texts and songs available to mil
lions of customers simultaneously is still
a formidable challenge. Today's storage
media are barely up to the task.
Magnetic storage devices, the most
common storage medium, record infor
mation in small magnetic patches or
"domains." Higher information density
requires finer media, smaller distances
between the readout head and the disk
and new tricks to control the head posi
tion very precisely.
An optical compact disc encodes ones
and zeros as reflecting and absorbing
spots on a metalized disc. The spots on
the disc are read by focusing a laser
beam onto the disc and observing
whether the beam is reflected or not.
()w> of the advantages of optical com
p; liscs is that they are easily and
inexpensively mass-produced. The
reflecting and absorbing spots are just
peaks and valleys on the metal surface
so copies of a master disk are simply
stamped out.
Although mass-produced optical
compact discs cannot be modified, new
optical media based on a phenomenon
called the "magneto-optical effect" allow
the information to be rewritten many
times.
Existing optical compact discs con
tain about 40 million bytes per square
centimeter while magnetic media con
tain about one-sixth of that density.
Magnetic media make up for the lower
density by using several disks in a single
sealed package. Although access times
for optical media are slower than for
magnetic disks, the gap will probably
narrow as technology matures.
Magnetic media density has been
increasing steadily by 60 percent every
year. According to Mark Kryder of the
Research Center in Data Storage at
Carnegie Mellon University, by the year
2001 magnetic storage density should
reach 160 megabytes per square inch.
The information density in an optical
disc is limited by how tightly light can be
focused. Shorter wavelengths of light
can be focused to smaller spots.
Researchers at IBM Almaden Research
Labs recently demonstrated a fivefold
data density increase using short-wave
length blue lasers.
Magnetic and optical media will prob
ably continue to evolve for the next 10
years or so. As they reach their practical
limits, however, new methods for stor
ing data may find a market.
Holographic data storage
The tacky hologram trinkets in drug
stores contain an enormous amount of

information. Many views of the object
are stored and reproduced by the holo
gram. Theoretically, a hologram the size
of a sugar cube can store thousands of
gigabytes of information and allow data
transfer rates of over 100 megabytes per
second.
To make a hologram, an object is illu
minated by an expanded laser beam and
a photographic plate is placed near the
object. The diffuse light reflected from
the object illuminates the plate while a
second laser beam, expanded to cover
the entire holographic plate, also illumi
nates the photographic plate.
The waves of light from the object
and the expanded laser beam combine to
form an intricate pattern of light and
dark swirls called an interference pat
tern. The interference pattern is record
ed by the photographic plate.
Developing the photographic plate
creates dark patches where there was
light and transparent patches where

there was none. Shining an expanded
laser beam through the developed pho
tographic plate "decodes" the wave
information of the light from the origi
nal object, reproducing the light from
the original object.
Non-digital holographic data storage
has already been demonstrated. For
example, researchers at Nippon Tele
phone and Telegraph in Japan recorded
simple animation in holographic crys
tals.
In an article in Science last year,
Prof. Lambertus Hesselink of the Stan
ford Electrical Engineering and Aero
nautics and Astronautics Departments,
his graduate student John Hensen and
research associate Matt Bashau demon
strated the first holographic system for
storing and retrieving digital informa
tion. In their experiment, a digitized
image of the Mona Lisa was stored in a
hologram and retrieved.
Their apparatus stored "pages" of

digital information in a crystal about the
size of a sugar cube. Each page was cre
ated by passing a beam of light through
a device called a spatial light modulator,
which consists of many pixels, each of
which can be turned on or off to pass or
block the incident light.
The recording crystal was a material
called iron-doped lithium niobate. Elec
trons in this material migrate from
regions of high light intensity to regions
of low intensity during exposure, creat
ing a pattern of electronic charge that
reflects the holographic interference
pattern. The pattern of charges in the
crystal modifies the optical properties of
the crystal, allowing it to store holo
grams.
The Stanford group's hologram con
tained many pages of data. The trick
was to record each page at a different
angle. The process of encoding many
pages in the same crystal is known as
"multiplexing."

To multiplex the different pages,
Hesselink and his co-workers rotated
the crystal slightly for each recorded
page. A small section of crystal was able
to hold 308 pages of data. In fact, only a
small portion of the crystal — about
1/100 th — was used.
To read back the image, a laser beam
was passed through the crystal to read
out the information. For each angle of
rotation a different two-dimensional
pattern was reproduced corresponding
to the original pattern created by the
spatial light modulator.
Hesselink and his collaborators used
a two-dimensional array of detectors to
detect the pattern and then passed the
information to a computer which decod
ed and displayed the image.
The natural ability of holograms to
recreate entire pages of data is one rea
son they are potentially so fast. This
"massive parallelism" is a unique fea
ture of holographic storage.

However, holographic data storage is
prone to errors. Without any correction,
the accuracy of the demonstrated sys
tem is about one error in every thousand
characters read. To overcome large inac
curacies, several pixels were used to
encode each bit of information, resulting
in a loss of data capacity. Improvements
in storage material and other optical
components will improve the accuracy
of the device.
The pattern in the lithium niobate is
also easily erased by the light used to
read the holographic data. Fixing of the
pattern is crucial in any real device, thus
holography will probably only be suit
able for read-only data storage.
Writing to the lithium niobate crystal
is also relatively slow. In Hesselink's
experiment each frame took several sec
onds and the entire recording process
took several minutes. Readout was con
siderably faster at about one-thirtieth of
a second for each frame.

Hesselink admitted that holographic
data storage will probably not replace
magnetic or optical disks in the near
future. However, he stressed, future
data storage systems requiring trillions
of bytes of information storage will pre
sent new problems for existing media.
"As they start getting into terabytes
(one thousand billion bytes), they are
going to have problems," Hesselink
pointed out. Although engineers can add
more platters to magnetic storage
devices, the system complexity will
rapidly become prohibitive. Thus, Hes
selink said, the need for new and more
powerful data storage will emerge.
The first commercial holographic
storage devices might start appearing
within the next three years, Hesselink
predicted. It is likely that they will start
showing up in high-capacity, read-only
storage devices, such as "video-on
demand" and on-line information sys
tems.
