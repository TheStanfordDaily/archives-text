# Sleep Center addresses nighttime disorders

For many people, getting a good night's sleep is
more than just a routine — it's a challenge.
One out of three people experiences insomnia or the
difficulty of falling asleep at some point in their lives.
Over 17 percent of the population has chronic insom
nia that lasts throughout their lives.
Researcher's at the Stanford's Sleep Disorders Clin
ic are trying to reduce those numbers.
According to Dr. Alexander Clerk of the center,
insomnia can be controlled by improving what is
known as one's sleep hygiene (see text box).
In addition to insomnia, the center treats a multi
tude of other sleep-related disorders, including nar
colepsy, a condition of feeling excessively sleepy during
the daytime and often falling asleep without notice.
Symptoms of this disorder include cataplexy, the loss
of muscle tone in response to high emotions. A nar
coleptic patient can fall out of his or her chair if emo
tionally charged.
A possible source of this problem is genetic, Clerk
said. Patients of narcolepsy can be treated by stimu
lants to control daytime sleep attacks and depressants
to control cataplexy.
Yet another sleep disorder is sleep apnea, the lack of
a continuous sleep. This condition is usually caused by
obstructions in the airway, either from some external
source or from the person's own tongue. The blocking
of the airway results in noticeable snoring, stoppages

of breathing followed by sudden waking and excessive
daytime sleepiness.
Sleep apnea can also be controlled, most easily by
using a good pillow and sleeping position. One uncom
mon way to open the airway is with the use of a con
trolled positive airway pressure machine. This dental
device keeps the airway open and clear by pumping
free air into the patient's mouth.
The sleep center also engages in research into other
medical disorders not directly classified as sleep disor
ders. For example, patients suffering from depression
are treated at the center by REM sleep deprivation.
REM sleep is the stage of sleep characterized by
heightened brain electrical activity, loss of muscle tone
and rapid eye movement. By controlling the amount of
REM sleep, doctors can control whether or not a
patient dreams, which seems to have therapeutic
effects in people suffering from depression.
The center is one of the best in the country and the
only one geared toward training sleep medicine spe
cialists — half of the country's sleep specialists receive
training at the center at some point in their careers. A
new bill recently approved by Congress may soon pro
vide more funding for the center's research activities.
In addition, the Fellows Program at the center is
funded by the National Institute of Aging and consists
of a two-year fellowship for two or three doctors. Some
doctors fund themselves and attend three-month
training seminars at the center. Neurologists, psychia
trists and pulmonary physicians are the main partici
pants in the program.
