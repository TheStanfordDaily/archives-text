## The
						Doctor is in Becker solid as a rock for Cardinal at No. 6 singles 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
jyiyone well acquainted with
junior Ricky Becker knows that
the personality of his gregarious
mother, Barbara, has certainly
rubbed off on him.
Take for instance the following
story, a family favorite of the
Becker household in Roslyn, N.Y.:
At a 1986 pro tournament in For
est Hills, N.Y., Mrs. Becker
approached the world's then-No.
1 player, Boris Becker, and half
jokingly bragged, "You're my
favorite player, but there is a 12-
year-old Becker named Ricky who
is going to be better than you one
day, and one day there is going to
be a match — Becker vs. Becker
— and you're going to lose." Boris
and his coach politely chuckled at
Barbara's tongue-in-cheek
remark, then drove off on their
German motorcycle.
The element of chutzpah is not
out of character for anyone in the

Becker family. Teammates and
coaches of the top-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal's No. 6 singles play
er are all too aware of this fact.
"Ricky is just a kick in the
butt," says Stanford assistant
coach John Whitlinger. "He's a
great guy to be around. Some
times I want to kill him and other
times I think he's one of the
greatest guys in the world."
What really matters to
Whitlinger, however, is Becker's
ability to win matches. And Beck
er has done that. In his three
years with the Cardinal, Becker
has amassed a sterling 36-5 sin
gles record, including a 17-3 dual
match record in 1995, his first
year as a full-time starter. Almost
all of his home match wins have
come on Court 7 of Stanford Ten
nis Stadium, known in some cir
cles as Becker's Bleachers for the
six small rows of bleachers often
populated by Becker enthusiasts.
Standing almost right on top of
the court, the fans in the bleach

ers often provide Becker with
invaluable verbal assistance
between points. They exhort him
to play better by calling out his
nickname, "Doctor" — a name
which reflects the surgeon-like
precision of his slice-and-dice
style of play. And they sometimes
heckle the Doctor's opponents —
a fact Becker appreciates for sev
eral reasons.
"Unless you're concentrating
really well, if a ball rolls in the
direction of hecklers and you have
to go pick it up, you're going to be
like, 'Oh, shoot. Here it comes.'
Becker's Bleachers definitely give
me a home court advantage,"
Becker says.
Becker also enjoys verbal
assaults because it makes him feel
more at home 3,000 miles from
the less polite section of the coun
try in which he grew up playing
tennis.
"Throughout the country, my
