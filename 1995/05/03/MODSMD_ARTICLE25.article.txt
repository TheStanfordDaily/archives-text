## The 						Doctor is in Becker solid as a rock for Cardinal at No. 6 singles 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
jyiyone well acquainted with
junior Ricky Becker knows that
the personality of his gregarious
mother, Barbara, has certainly
rubbed off on him.
Take for instance the following
story, a family favorite of the
Becker household in Roslyn, N.Y.:
At a 1986 pro tournament in For
est Hills, N.Y., Mrs. Becker
approached the world's then-No.
1 player, Boris Becker, and half
jokingly bragged, "You're my
favorite player, but there is a 12-
year-old Becker named Ricky who
is going to be better than you one
day, and one day there is going to
be a match — Becker vs. Becker
— and you're going to lose." Boris
and his coach politely chuckled at
Barbara's tongue-in-cheek
remark, then drove off on their
German motorcycle.
The element of chutzpah is not
out of character for anyone in the

Becker family. Teammates and
coaches of the top-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal's No. 6 singles play
er are all too aware of this fact.
"Ricky is just a kick in the
butt," says Stanford assistant
coach John Whitlinger. "He's a
great guy to be around. Some
times I want to kill him and other
times I think he's one of the
greatest guys in the world."
What really matters to
Whitlinger, however, is Becker's
ability to win matches. And Beck
er has done that. In his three
years with the Cardinal, Becker
has amassed a sterling 36-5 sin
gles record, including a 17-3 dual
match record in 1995, his first
year as a full-time starter. Almost
all of his home match wins have
come on Court 7 of Stanford Ten
nis Stadium, known in some cir
cles as Becker's Bleachers for the
six small rows of bleachers often
populated by Becker enthusiasts.
Standing almost right on top of
the court, the fans in the bleach

ers often provide Becker with
invaluable verbal assistance
between points. They exhort him
to play better by calling out his
nickname, "Doctor" — a name
which reflects the surgeon-like
precision of his slice-and-dice
style of play. And they sometimes
heckle the Doctor's opponents —
a fact Becker appreciates for sev
eral reasons.
"Unless you're concentrating
really well, if a ball rolls in the
direction of hecklers and you have
to go pick it up, you're going to be
like, 'Oh, shoot. Here it comes.'
Becker's Bleachers definitely give
me a home court advantage,"
Becker says.
Becker also enjoys verbal
assaults because it makes him feel
more at home 3,000 miles from
the less polite section of the coun
try in which he grew up playing
tennis.
"Throughout the country, my

Eastern section is known as the one
with the most tempestuous players.
But I won the sportsmanship
award there before coming to Stan
ford, so now some of my teammates
joke that I am 'the best of the
worst.'
"I'm just not used to everyone
being so mellow. Growing up there
was a lot of trash-talking in juniors,
which I was not a part of, but I
think is hitting me now," Becker
says.
On occasion, Becker feels the
urge to lash out against himself for
not crushing players who he
believes have no business playing
on the same court as him. On these
off-days, inhabitants of Becker's
Bleachers oflen hear him shout,
"This is a mockery!" or "Good ten
nis this is not!" or "The weight
transfer on that shot was pitiful!"
or "This is so indicative of my [fill in
the blank with any shot] today!"
Becker explains: "A lot of the
time I'm playing players who I
think I should beat routinely, but

when I do poorly against them, I
attribute it to my poor play more
than their good play — which I
guess I shouldn't do, although it's
hard not to sometimes."
When Becker's emotions get the
best of him, he will sometimes
begin overhitting on short balls.
But Whitlinger takes a mild
approach to Becker's antics that
seems to work.
"Sometimes things bother Doc a
little bit so you've got to rope him
in," Whitlinger says.
Becker is easily coached because
he can draw on many different tal
ents. He combines many attributes
on the court, but all agree his great
est asset is his heart.
"The key is that he's a very good
competitor," says Stanford head
coach Dick Gould.
Adds Becker's doubles partner,
Jim Thomas: "The best thing about
playing with Ricky is that I know
the guy is never gonna give up."
Becker credits his early coach,
Robbie Wagner — with whom
Becker still trains in the off-season
— for molding him into the player
that was able to jump from being
ranked No. 7 in the East as a 14-
year-old to being ranked No. 7 in
the country as an 18-year-old.

"Robbie Wagner really instilled
the fight-hard attitude in me. He
has helped me motivation-wise,
and Gould and Whit have really
helped me strategy-wise and
stroke-wise," Becker says.
In addition to his tenacity, Beck
er has developed a full-court game
since arriving on the Pacific 10
Conference scene in 1992 as an
accomplished baseliner with a solid
return of serve.
"Doctor is a much more versatile
player than when he entered
school," Gould says."He was basi
cally a backcourter. Now he's very
comfortable serving and volleying.
His forehand is a weapon. He has a
much better feel for the flow of the
match. He has a very good sense of
mixing at the right time — going
from being very aggressive to very
passive. His doubles play has
improved tremendously. He's mak
ing a gigantic contribution to the
team.
"We've turned into such a good
team this year not just with people
like [Scott] Humphries and [Paul]
Goldstein stepping in, but also
because of people like Grant
[Elliott] and Ricky getting a chance
to start and stepping up," Gould
adds

By choosing to play for Stanford,
Becker forewent a chance to play at
the top of Harvard's lineup and
achieve a national ranking. As he
stands now, he might well be the
best No. 6 singles player in any col
lege's lineup. Gould realizes how
fortunate his team is to have such a
rock to shore up his lineup.
"Never mind No. 6 singles. I
think Doc compares very favorably
to any player in the country,"
Gould says."He can beat any guy
on any team we play on any given
day. He's a great player and win
ning Ithe Collegiate Men's Invita
tional last week at] Ojai is indica
tive of that."
Along with Elliott, who won 21
of 23 matches playing alongside
Becker at No. 5 singles this year,
the Doctor has earned a second
nickname, "The Rock," which he
now inscribes on the back of his
Nikes. His and Elliott's steady play
were major factors in the Cardi
nal's 23-0 run and its impending
trip to the NCAA Championships
as the top seed. The Cardinal is
indeed in the midst of a dream sea
son in which Becker is happy to
participate.
"It's a treat to be on this team. I
feel like I'm living through a part of

Stanford history. You hear about
seasons like this, and it's kind of
cool to be living through one, but
it's still unfinished business until
we win NCAAs," Becker says.
Seasons like this one are just a
part of the reason why Becker
decided to turn down the Crimson
for a chance to wear Cardinal red.
"I'm definitely getting better by
coming here because I practice day
in and day out with potentially good
pro players such as Salzy [Jeff
Salzenstein], Goldie [Goldstein],
and Hump [Humphries]," Becker
muses. "Had I stayed closer to my
friends and family back East, I
would only be practicing with
decent tennis players who will
probably become good attorneys or
at least forces in the working
world."
And speaking of the future,
what of his mother's expectations
of an impending Becker vs. Becker
match-up? The less famous tennis
playing Becker shies away from
such premature comparisons. In
fact, that is one subject on which
the Doctor is uncharacteristically
humble:
"If Boris asked to play No. 6 sin
gles for Stanford, I think Coach
would give him the nod."

Jim Thomas: "The best thing about
playing with Ricky is that I know
the guy is never gonna give up."
Becker credits his early coach,
Robbie Wagner — with whom
Becker still trains in the off-season
— for molding him into the player
that was able to jump from being
ranked No. 7 in the East as a 14-
year-old to being ranked No. 7 in
the country as an 18-year-old.

"Robbie Wagner really instilled
the fight-hard attitude in me. He
has helped me motivation-wise,
and Gould and Whit have really
helped me strategy-wise and
stroke-wise," Becker says.
In addition to his tenacity, Beck
er has developed a full-court game
since arriving on the Pacific 10
Conference scene in 1992 as an
accomplished baseliner with a solid
return of serve.
"Doctor is a much more versatile
player than when he entered
school," Gould says."He was basi
cally a backcourter. Now he's very
comfortable serving and volleying.
His forehand is a weapon. He has a
much better feel for the flow of the
match. He has a very good sense of
mixing at the right time — going
from being very aggressive to very
passive. His doubles play has
improved tremendously. He's mak
ing a gigantic contribution to the
team.
"We've turned into such a good
team this year not just with people
like [Scott] Humphries and [Paul]
Goldstein stepping in, but also
because of people like Grant
[Elliott] and Ricky getting a chance
to start and stepping up," Gould
adds

By choosing to play for Stanford,
Becker forewent a chance to play at
the top of Harvard's lineup and
achieve a national ranking. As he
stands now, he might well be the
best No. 6 singles player in any col
lege's lineup. Gould realizes how
fortunate his team is to have such a
rock to shore up his lineup.
"Never mind No. 6 singles. I
think Doc compares very favorably
to any player in the country,"
Gould says."He can beat any guy
on any team we play on any given
day. He's a great player and win
ning Ithe Collegiate Men's Invita
tional last week at] Ojai is indica
tive of that."
Along with Elliott, who won 21
of 23 matches playing alongside
Becker at No. 5 singles this year,
the Doctor has earned a second
nickname, "The Rock," which he
now inscribes on the back of his
Nikes. His and Elliott's steady play
were major factors in the Cardi
nal's 23-0 run and its impending
trip to the NCAA Championships
as the top seed. The Cardinal is
indeed in the midst of a dream sea
son in which Becker is happy to
participate.
"It's a treat to be on this team. I
feel like I'm living through a part of

Stanford history. You hear about
seasons like this, and it's kind of
cool to be living through one, but
it's still unfinished business until
we win NCAAs," Becker says.
Seasons like this one are just a
part of the reason why Becker
decided to turn down the Crimson
for a chance to wear Cardinal red.
"I'm definitely getting better by
coming here because I practice day
in and day out with potentially good
pro players such as Salzy [Jeff
Salzenstein], Goldie [Goldstein],
and Hump [Humphries]," Becker
muses. "Had I stayed closer to my
friends and family back East, I
would only be practicing with
decent tennis players who will
probably become good attorneys or
at least forces in the working
world."
And speaking of the future,
what of his mother's expectations
of an impending Becker vs. Becker
match-up? The less famous tennis
playing Becker shies away from
such premature comparisons. In
fact, that is one subject on which
the Doctor is uncharacteristically
humble:
"If Boris asked to play No. 6 sin
gles for Stanford, I think Coach
would give him the nod."
jyiyone well acquainted with
junior Ricky Becker knows that
the personality of his gregarious
mother, Barbara, has certainly
rubbed off on him.
Take for instance the following
story, a family favorite of the
Becker household in Roslyn, N.Y.:
At a 1986 pro tournament in For
est Hills, N.Y., Mrs. Becker
approached the world's then-No.
1 player, Boris Becker, and half
jokingly bragged, "You're my
favorite player, but there is a 12-
year-old Becker named Ricky who
is going to be better than you one
day, and one day there is going to
be a match — Becker vs. Becker
— and you're going to lose." Boris
and his coach politely chuckled at
Barbara's tongue-in-cheek
remark, then drove off on their
German motorcycle.
The element of chutzpah is not
out of character for anyone in the

Becker family. Teammates and
coaches of the top-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal's No. 6 singles play
er are all too aware of this fact.
"Ricky is just a kick in the
butt," says Stanford assistant
coach John Whitlinger. "He's a
great guy to be around. Some
times I want to kill him and other
times I think he's one of the
greatest guys in the world."
What really matters to
Whitlinger, however, is Becker's
ability to win matches. And Beck
er has done that. In his three
years with the Cardinal, Becker
has amassed a sterling 36-5 sin
gles record, including a 17-3 dual
match record in 1995, his first
year as a full-time starter. Almost
all of his home match wins have
come on Court 7 of Stanford Ten
nis Stadium, known in some cir
cles as Becker's Bleachers for the
six small rows of bleachers often
populated by Becker enthusiasts.
Standing almost right on top of
the court, the fans in the bleach

ers often provide Becker with
invaluable verbal assistance
between points. They exhort him
to play better by calling out his
nickname, "Doctor" — a name
which reflects the surgeon-like
precision of his slice-and-dice
style of play. And they sometimes
heckle the Doctor's opponents —
a fact Becker appreciates for sev
eral reasons.
"Unless you're concentrating
really well, if a ball rolls in the
direction of hecklers and you have
to go pick it up, you're going to be
like, 'Oh, shoot. Here it comes.'
Becker's Bleachers definitely give
me a home court advantage,"
Becker says.
Becker also enjoys verbal
assaults because it makes him feel
more at home 3,000 miles from
the less polite section of the coun
try in which he grew up playing
tennis.
"Throughout the country, my


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Junior Ricky "The Doctor" Becker has signed a death certificate of 17 of his 20 dual-match opponents
this season.
Eastern section is known as the one
with the most tempestuous players.
But I won the sportsmanship
award there before coming to Stan
ford, so now some of my teammates
joke that I am 'the best of the
worst.'
"I'm just not used to everyone
being so mellow. Growing up there
was a lot of trash-talking in juniors,
which I was not a part of, but I
think is hitting me now," Becker
says.
On occasion, Becker feels the
urge to lash out against himself for
not crushing players who he
believes have no business playing
on the same court as him. On these
off-days, inhabitants of Becker's
Bleachers oflen hear him shout,
"This is a mockery!" or "Good ten
nis this is not!" or "The weight
transfer on that shot was pitiful!"
or "This is so indicative of my [fill in
the blank with any shot] today!"
Becker explains: "A lot of the
time I'm playing players who I
think I should beat routinely, but

when I do poorly against them, I
attribute it to my poor play more
than their good play — which I
guess I shouldn't do, although it's
hard not to sometimes."
When Becker's emotions get the
best of him, he will sometimes
begin overhitting on short balls.
But Whitlinger takes a mild
approach to Becker's antics that
seems to work.
"Sometimes things bother Doc a
little bit so you've got to rope him
in," Whitlinger says.
Becker is easily coached because
he can draw on many different tal
ents. He combines many attributes
on the court, but all agree his great
est asset is his heart.
"The key is that he's a very good
competitor," says Stanford head
coach Dick Gould.
Adds Becker's doubles partner,
Jim Thomas: "The best thing about
playing with Ricky is that I know
the guy is never gonna give up."
Becker credits his early coach,
Robbie Wagner — with whom
Becker still trains in the off-season
— for molding him into the player
