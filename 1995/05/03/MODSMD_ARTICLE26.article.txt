# Olympic greatness transcends sport

"May they display cheerfulness and concord so
that the Olympic torch may be carried on with
ever greater eagerness, courage and honor for the
good of humanity throughout the ages."
-Remarks of the Olympic Committee president
In a little more than a year, thousands of ath
letes from all over the world will make their
pilgrimages to the United States, eyes shining
and muscles taut, to join the biggest, longest
party that Atlanta has ever thrown.
It's a party that has a history reaching into the

legends of 2,500 years ago. It features more con
fetti, balloons and television coverage than a
night at the Oscars; it has more highs and lows
than any drive through the Cascades. The
Olympics reveals life as drama, and sports as life.
As the opening day of this 100 th anniversary
of the modern games approaches, the nation
wakes up from its sleepy patriotic apathy and ral
lies behind the athletes that wear Old Glory on
their warm-ups. Barriers between Sonics and
Suns fans fade; embittered Charger fans tem
porarily quell their 49er hatred; baseball lovers
and haters stand side by side. The divisions

between the people of these 50 states — from the
color on their jerseys to the color of their faces —
lose importance. A nation of different teams and
beliefs turns into one team: Team USA
Two days ago, eager die-hards woke up before
the crack of dawn and headed to their local gro
cery store to wait in line for Olympic tickets. They
stood in the morning cold not for butter, bread or
milk, but because they want to go to the party in
Atlanta. They want to wave an American flag
above their heads and feel some good old-fash
ioned nationalistic pride.
The Olympic Games have stuck remarkably
faithfully to the vision Baron Pierre de Coubertin
brought to the revamped modern games. The dis
tinguished Frenchman was not a sports fan in
the normal sense of the word, but he was a believ
er in the qualities that sports ignites in people. He
saw a different tint to the concept of internation
al competition. Rather than war, why not pro
mote some understanding?
This concept still rings true, although the
mere idea of competition between countries — at
any level, in any realm — is bound to mar the
purity of de Coubertin's dreams. In some sense,
it's not simply Zola Budd vs. Mary Decker, it's
two nations vying against each other. Each ath
lete represents the strongest that country has to
offer. She or he symbolizes the country's
endurance, discipline, ambition. And, let's not
forget, sportsmanship.
We've all heard of Wilma Rudolph, who
couldn't walk until the age of eight due to polio,
yet sprinted to three gold medals in 1960. That
same year Ethiopian barefooted marathon run
ner Abebe Bikila won Africa's first gold medal.
Four years later, he returned (with shoes this

time) and won it again. Jesse Owens, who took
home an unheard-of four gold medals in 1936,
perhaps captured the "Olympic spirit" perfectly
when he aided his German rival in the long jump.
In our own time, we've seen Kim Zmeskal and
Mary Lou Retton, Evelyn Ashford and Carl
Lewis, Pablo Morales and Summer Sanders, the
United States ice hockey and basketball teams.
As a country, we unite. For once, we're not com
peting within the borders.
Yet there's an obvious risk with international
sports rivalry. The athletes of 1936 experienced it
in Berlin when swastika flags hung from the
rafters. In 1980 and 1984, Americans and Soviets
did not compete against each other due to boy
cotts. Eleven Israeli athletes were murdered by
terrorists during the 1972 Munich games. It's
not entirely a party after all. The outside world
can't help but seep into the Olympics, bringing
the dimensions of politics, people and conflicts
along with it. The victories bea>me that much
more important, and the differences that much
more tragic.
The Olympic Games, in fact, are life. They are
realized dreams, crashed hopes and all degrees of
profundity in between. They unite us as a coun
try, and we join scores of other nations under an
umbrella of our universal love for sports. We try
to look beyond our differences for a few weeks,
respect other countries and consider athletes for
their sheer skill rather than their place of birth.
Everywhere, from tiny villages to sprawling
metropolises, people love sports. And just as sure
ly as sports love is universal, so are differences.
One hundred years of Olympics isn't enough to
help people look past them, but it's a start.
Let the games begin.
