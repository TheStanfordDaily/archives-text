Freshman Scott Humphries, ranked 25th in the nation and
Stanford's No. 2 singles player, stunned three higher-ranked
opponents to take the Pac-10 singles championship. Humphries
and doubles partner Paul Goldstein earned a berth in the doubles
final in Ojai, Calif., last weekend before their long win streak was
snapped. Humphries and Goldstein's three-set quarterfinal victo
ry ended with a 17-15 marathon tie-breaker.

Freshman Ania Bleszynski and sophomore doubles partner Katie
Schlukebir never dropped a set en route to claiming the Pac-10 dou
bles championship. After posting five losses in the regular season,
the Cardinal's top doubles squad dropped only nine games combined
in its semifinal and final victories. Bleszynski and Schlukebir also
reached the semifinals of the singles tourney, where Bleszynski held
a two-game lead in the third set before dropping the final four games
to No. 2 Keri Phebus of UCLA.
