Stanford 8
Santa Clara 6

Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Sta
dium could have easily been a cor
ral instead of a baseball diamond
last night as the Stanford baseball
squad bucked the Broncos and
lassoed in an 8-6 non-conference
victory.
Stanford (28-20 overall, 17-10
in the Six-Pac) was led by junior
second baseman Brian Dal
limore's two home run perfor
mance. He ended the game 3-for
-4 with three RBIs and two runs.
The scoring began early in the
first inning when junior right
fielder Dusty Allen cleared the
bases with a one-out double, scor
ing freshman center fielder Joe
Kilburg, junior left fielder Cale
Carter and junior catcher A.J.
Hinch. Dallimore roped a RBI sin
gle over shortstop the next at-bat
and scored Allen before the Bron
cos could get the third out, and
the Cardinal had a quick 4-0 lead
after one inning.
Santa Clara starting pitcher
Mike Frank hit three Stanford
batters in the first two innings
after making contact with only six
opponents all year coming into
the Cardinal game.
In the third inning, Dallimore
struck again, collecting his second
RBI of the game after he lined a
curve ball over the left field fence
for his second home run of the
season. Junior first baseman
Troy Kent stepped up and
knocked the next pitch 370 feet to
the right center field wall for a
triple, and Jay Pecci lined a single
over third base to score Kent and

extend the lead to 6-0.
"I got some really good pitches
to hit, he kept giving me fastballs
to hit," Dallimore said. "I haven't
been hitting well this year, but we
found something that worked
tonight."
Sophomore right hander Tom
Reimers made his first collegiate
start against the Broncos, shut
ting down the Santa Clara bats in
the first two innings.
Santa Clara got on the board
in the third inning on a sacrifice
fly after Reimers balked and
advanced a runner to third base.
But the Cardinal answered in the
top of the fourth as A J. Hinch
launched his sixth triple of the
season down the first baseline
and went home on a passed ball to
run the score to 7-1.
Reimers got out of a jam in the
fourth inning, loading the bases
on a walk with only one out before
he struck out the eighth Bronco
batter and forced the ninth batter
to ground to second.
In the fifth inning, Dallimore
continued his monster night at
the plate, launching his second
home run of the game over the
wall to give the Cardinal an 8-1
lead.
The Cardinal pitching slack
ened in the bottom of the fifth
inning as Reimers loaded the
bases for the second straight
inning with no outs. Sophomore
Brendan Sullivan took over at the
mound and gave up three quick
RBI singles and a sacrifice before
Stanford could collect three outs
and maintain an 8-5 lead.
Santa Clara finally woke up in
the ninth inning when Frank, the
Broncos' starting pitcher, home
red to right field and cut the lead
to 8-6. But the run was too late
and freshman right-hander Kyle
Peterson collected his first save of
the season as the Cardinal won its
fifth game in seven tries.
