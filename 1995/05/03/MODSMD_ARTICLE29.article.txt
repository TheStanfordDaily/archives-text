# Softball needs wins

If the NCAA handed out victo
ries or tournament berths based
on strength of schedule, the Stan
ford soflball team would be one of
the top 10 teams in the nation.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
only winning on the field counts
in the standings. Consequently,
the team is welcoming a chance to
escape Pacific 10 Conference com
petition in a doubleheader at
Santa Clara today at 5 p.m.
Stanford (14-30) has found its
first-ever journey through the
Pac-10 a tortuous one, with only
one victory (a 9-6 win at Oregon
State) against 21 losses to show
for many valiant efforts.
The Cardinal's problems begin
with its schedule. Four of Stan
ford's nine conference opponents
are ranked in the top 20, and
three are in the top 10. Top
ranked UCLA and No. 2 Arizona
have faced the Cardinal in six of
its last 10 games.
"The Pac-10 is without a doubt
the toughest conference in the
nation," Stanford coach Sandy

Pearce said. "It's tough competi
tion, but it causes us to elevate
our level of play."
Stanford was able to elevate its
game for a while against UCLA
on Sunday, staying even with the
No. 1 Bruins through three
innings of the first game. Eventu
ally, the experience and athleti
cism of UCLA took over, leading
to the 11-1 final score,
"We definitely showed that we
belong out there," freshman
pitcher Jessica Schulman said.
"We may not have all the abilities
they have, but the heart and the
effort is there and we can compete
against them. We also learn a lot
by playing them that we can use
against other teams."
The Cardinal will get a chance
to apply what it has learned today
against Santa Clara. Though not
a bad team by any stretch, the
Broncos do not pose as many
problems for Stanford as the
opponents the team is used to
playing.
"They're not even close to a
UCLA or an Arizona," Schulman
said, adding that if Stanford can
play at the level it has against
those teams, the squad will be
able to handle the Broncos.
To do that, the Cardinal will
have to continue to get produc
tion from junior shortstop Sum
mer Lee, who leads the team
with a .430 batting average that
ranks fourth in the Pac-10.
In fact, Lee has hit safely in
19 of her last 23 games. Junior
left fielder Amanda Renteria
(.330) is also hitting well of late
for the Cardinal. The rest of the
lineup, however, has struggled at
times against top teams. Junior
catcher Lynn Anderson hit the
ball hard versus UCLA, but sev
eral of her teammates had trou
ble getting around against the
likes of Bruin fireballer B'Ann
Burns.
To their credit, however,
Burns is 20-3 on the year and
wreaks havoc on every opposing
lineup she faces. Santa Clara will
offer a more reasonable test for
the Stanford offense.
