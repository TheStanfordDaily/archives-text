# KAs, Betas lose Row houses
## Lack of membership makes houses available in Draw

Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta Pi
will both lose their houses next year
and the two fraternity houses will
become undergraduate residences
available in the Draw.
Following a week of private
meetings, Dean of Students Jim
Larimore and Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe announced
yesterday that these two fraterni
ties did not submit their pledge
housing contracts — a mandatory
form requiring all housed fraterni
ty members to refrain from partici
pating in the Draw and committing
to live in the fraternity house —
and will lose their house at the end
of this quarter.
"They were having difficulty
meeting a reasonably sized pledge
class," Howe said. "Clearly they
didn't have it."
Both fraternities failed to garner

enough pledges to effectively fill
their respective houses. However,
Howe said she could not disclose
the actual number of pledges.
"They realized that they could
not sustain their house. That's why
they didn't turn [their forms] in,"
Howe said.
Representatives of both frater
nities refused to comment yester
day.
Not only will members of these
two fraternities lose their house,
they will also be unable to list their
former houses as one of their pre
ferred residence choices in the
Draw, said Bill Georges, manager
of Housing Assignment Services.
He said that members will be
charged a preferred year for every
year they lived in the fraternity
house.
"We want to have a clear break
between the old community of the
fraternities and the new communi
ty" of all students, Georges said.

"We found in the past that if we
allow some fraternity members to
stay on in the house, it really still
was viewed as a fraternity house to
the students who were assigned
there randomly in the Draw. It
wasn't a successful residence."
After Rush ended last week, the
two fraternities realized they would
be short of pledges and initiated the
contact with the University, Lari
more said.
He stressed that the University
is not summarily evicting the fra
ternities and praised them for com
ing to the administration. "This
wasn't a decision based on discipli
nary problems," he said.
"It was a difficult decision," said
Interfraternity Council President
Trey Stolz. "There's nothing really
I could do. I tried to talk to IHowel a
bit... I tried to argue for them but
that was all I can do."
