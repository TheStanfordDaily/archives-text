# KAs, Betas lose Row houses
## Lack of membership makes houses available in Draw

Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta Pi
will both lose their houses next year
and the two fraternity houses will
become undergraduate residences
available in the Draw.
Following a week of private
meetings, Dean of Students Jim
Larimore and Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe announced
yesterday that these two fraterni
ties did not submit their pledge
housing contracts — a mandatory
form requiring all housed fraterni
ty members to refrain from partici
pating in the Draw and committing
to live in the fraternity house —
and will lose their house at the end
of this quarter.
"They were having difficulty
meeting a reasonably sized pledge
class," Howe said. "Clearly they
didn't have it."
Both fraternities failed to garner

enough pledges to effectively fill
their respective houses. However,
Howe said she could not disclose
the actual number of pledges.
"They realized that they could
not sustain their house. That's why
they didn't turn [their forms] in,"
Howe said.
Representatives of both frater
nities refused to comment yester
day.
Not only will members of these
two fraternities lose their house,
they will also be unable to list their
former houses as one of their pre
ferred residence choices in the
Draw, said Bill Georges, manager
of Housing Assignment Services.
He said that members will be
charged a preferred year for every
year they lived in the fraternity
house.
"We want to have a clear break
between the old community of the
fraternities and the new communi
ty" of all students, Georges said.

"We found in the past that if we
allow some fraternity members to
stay on in the house, it really still
was viewed as a fraternity house to
the students who were assigned
there randomly in the Draw. It
wasn't a successful residence."
After Rush ended last week, the
two fraternities realized they would
be short of pledges and initiated the
contact with the University, Lari
more said.
He stressed that the University
is not summarily evicting the fra
ternities and praised them for com
ing to the administration. "This
wasn't a decision based on discipli
nary problems," he said.
"It was a difficult decision," said
Interfraternity Council President
Trey Stolz. "There's nothing really
I could do. I tried to talk to IHowel a
bit... I tried to argue for them but
that was all I can do."
This changing of the guard
could possibly lead to currently
unhoused fraternities and sorori
ties receiving a house for the
1996-'97 year.
In the upcoming months, Howe
said, her department will review
its policy on the determination of
Greek housing. "We need to have
a clear and fair process on who to
put in there," she said. "We don't
have that now."

Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority
and Sigma Nu and Zeta Psi frater
nities have all applied for future
housing.
For a fraternity to be housed, a
new administration policy
requires that members occupy 90
percent of the house. And while
the goal is 100 percent, Howe said
the administration wants "to give
houses some flexibility from year
to year."
"Fraternities that are the
strongest are those who have an
active, engaged, vibrant full
house," she said.
This year, however, there were

40 spaces among the 10 fraternity
houses not occupied by fraternity
members, Howe said. "That's
almost a house [in itself]," she
added.
Each of the eight remaining
unhoused fraternities received
enough pledges to fulfill the 90
percent requirement, Howe said.
This year, 350 people partici
pated in Rush events. Two hun
dred fifty of those received bids,
Howe said. However, she said that
not only did many students
decline their bids, some "who were
offered bids were never going to
take them."

With the Draw already in
progress, housing officials are now
forced to publicize the opening of
90 new undergraduate spaces.
Resident assistants and house
managers for the two houses have
yet to be chosen, and — until
today — students have not been
notified of the logistics of each
house.
Information on the two houses
can be found on a new Axess
notice, Georges said. Students
who have already submitted their
preferences for the Draw —
Georges said seven students have
already done so — will have the

opportunity to change them in
light of the additional housing
options.
Although there will be no open
houses at either house, Georges
said the KA and Beta houses will
probably draw well. The Beta
house, renovated two years ago,
has many single rooms, and the
KA house, though not yet refur
bished, has virtually all two-room
doubles, he said.
Over the summer, Facilities
will determine whether any fur
ther additions need to occur to
acclimate the houses to a coed
environment, Georges said.
