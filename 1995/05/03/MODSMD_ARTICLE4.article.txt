# SEAS begins push for greener Texaco
## 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
If Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford has its way at a
meeting this morning with the Uni
versity's Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility, the Universi
ty will encourage Texaco Corpora
tion to become more sensitive to en
vironmental and human rights is
sues.
Today's meeting is one small
step in a long struggle by activist
and student organizations nation
wide to change Texaco's practices.
The corporation has been ranked as
one of the 10 worst polluters in the
country for two years in a row by
the Council on Economic Priorities.
SEAS also claims that Texaco
currently supports the Burmese
military regime responsible for the

killings of university students and
the arrest of Nobel Peace Prize win
ner Aung San Suu Kyi.
At the annual Texaco sharehold
ers' meeting next week, the Univer
sity Board of Trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility will represent Stanford,
which owns approximately $6 mil
lion in Texaco shares.
In its biggest campaign of the
year, SEAS hopes to convince the
advisory panel to make a recom
mendation to the trustees' commit
tee to vote in favor of a proxy reso
lution on human rights that is ex
pected to come up at the sharehold
ers' meeting, according to SEAS
member Nick Thompson.
The resolution, while not a di
rect address of the Burma situa
tion, would force Texaco to consider
its human relations role in general
and reevaluate its actions in coun
tries like Burma, Thompson said.
"If [the advisory panel mem
bers] agree with us, I'm almost pos
itive" that Stanford will vote in
favor of the proxy resolution,
Thompson said.
At today's meeting, Thompson
will present the Burma case to the
advisory panel this morning,
while two other SEAS members
will address Texaco's actions in
the United States and Ecuador.
According to Gary Malone,
director of investment responsi
bility for Stanford Management
Company, SEAS must make "an
allegation of substantial social
injury" toward Texaco in order
to get the advisory panel to
embark on an investigation of
the matter.
If the student group does make
such an allegation, then the advi
sory panel is "obligated to investi -
gate the allegation and see
whether it has merit," Malone
said.
After an investigation, the
advisory panel would recommend
a "course of action" to the
trustees' committee, Malone said.
Among the things it might rec
ommend would be talking to Tex
aco directly, forming alliances
with other institutions and then
addressing their demands to Texa
co and voting on a proxy resolu
tion. As a last resort, the panel
could recommend that Stanford
sell its Texaco shares. However,
Malone said, this would be seen as
a failure in getting Texaco to
reform its policies.
