# Amid debate, ASSU confirms election
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
After over an hour of debate, the
ASSU Senate last night confirmed
the spring election results, prevent
ing further investigation into any
election violations.
Election Commissioner Jonathan
Berent and Hearings Officer Chi-
Ming Chien's decision to curb
any further action on pursuing
election violations was opposite
the position the two took prior to
last week's meeting, when Chien
said he would vigorously push for

the creation of a hearings com
mittee.
But this week Chien said since
the Nominations Commission had
not recommended a hearings com
mittee to the senate, any violations
should be taken up by the senate in
its certification process.
An angry Berent loudly told the
senate that to not confirm the re
sults would lead to another $6,000
election.
