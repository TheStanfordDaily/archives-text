# Amid debate, ASSU confirms election
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
After over an hour of debate, the
ASSU Senate last night confirmed
the spring election results, prevent
ing further investigation into any
election violations.
Election Commissioner Jonathan
Berent and Hearings Officer Chi-
Ming Chien's decision to curb
any further action on pursuing
election violations was opposite
the position the two took prior to
last week's meeting, when Chien
said he would vigorously push for

the creation of a hearings com
mittee.
But this week Chien said since
the Nominations Commission had
not recommended a hearings com
mittee to the senate, any violations
should be taken up by the senate in
its certification process.
An angry Berent loudly told the
senate that to not confirm the re
sults would lead to another $6,000
election.
Students' Alliance senators and
a number of independent graduate
senators attempted to filibuster
the bill. However, when graduate
senator Curtis Kin, an Alliance
member, and another graduate
senator decided to move to a vote,
Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi
was able to cast a decisive vote
which brought the issue to the
floor.
The bill passed 10-5 with two
senators abstaining.
Throughout the last two weeks,
Chien had promised that allega
tions of electronic mail mass-mail
ing, use of administration
resources and e-mail forgery would
be investigated.
He said that in the last week he
contacted Nominations Commis
sion Chair Susie Thomas, mem
bers of the Council of Presidents
and one graduate senator, and
asked them to create a hearings
committee and call a special meet
ing. "None of this happened," he
said.
Although Chien originally
planned to act as prosecutor before

the never-created hearings com
mittee, he said yesterday that none
of the allegations "have a standard
preponderance of evidence for elec
tions violations."
Undergraduate senator Ed Mal
one, in one of two harangues which
both concluded with his resigna
tion, called the election "a travesty,
a mockery of due process."
He criticized the senate, the sen
ate chair and the election commis
sion for not moving more quickly
to form the hearings committee.
Following the vote, Malone's sec
ond was well-received by most sen
ators.
Malone appeared a third time
only to pace through the senate
holding a sign which read "Due
Process."
Both Kasrawi and COP member
Mork Murdock said a meeting was
not called because it was not in the
interests of the senate.
"So far as I know, they conclud
ed that they weren't going to try to
appoint a hearings committee,"
Kasrawi said.
"Ideally there should have been
a hearings committee three weeks
ago," Murdock said. "The senate,
nom com and election commission

failed to put that in its place. Tak
ing that action Friday would have
been irresponsible at the time."
In other action, the senate
approved a bill condemning any
future federal cuts in financial aid.
The bill grants $1,000 from the
senate discretionary fund to pay
for an ad in The Daily which pro
ponents hope will "initiate a Uni
versity-wide education campaign
on the impact of federal student aid
cuts to Stanford students."
Deputy Senate Chair Mike Choo
said the bill's intent is to "raise
issues of awareness of cuts in fed
eral financial aid."
The senate also approved the
quarterly allocations of the Com
munity Service Board, Publica
tions Board and Program Board.
The funding is retroactive to the
beginning of the quarter.
The senate allowed Club Sports
to transfer $17,500 from its
reserve account to allow 11 teams
to participate in national tourna
ments.
In addition to Malone, graduate
senators Donald Aingworth and
Sandeep Singhal attempted to
resign. However, their requests
were denied.
