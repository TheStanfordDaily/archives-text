# BGLAD speech defends 'outing'
## Signorile says public revelation will help to end discrimination 
### Samuel Park Staff writer 
Only weeks after Rolling Stone publisher Jann
Wenner was publicly "outed" as gay in the main
stream media, activist Michelangelo Signorile last
night defended the practice that he was once demo
nized for in the media.
Speaking before a crowd of about 120 people at
Annenberg Auditorium, Signorile stressed the im
portance of "outing" as a means of ending discrimi
nation and normalizing homosexuality. Outing
refers to publicly revealing the sexuality of public
figures, a practice that Signorile pioneered in the
mid-'Bos as a columnist for Outweek magazine.
"I wasn't into gratuitously outing people, but
only when it was relevant to a larger story, relevant
journalistically," Signorile said. He later cited as an
example diver Greg Louganis' outing by a New York
Times sports writer when the Olympic gold medalist
took on the role of a gay man in the gay off-Broadway
show "Jeffrey."
"The story itself ... is more important than the
subjects themselves. It may sound cold, but the pub
lic's right to know or need to know ... is ultimately
more important," Signorile added.
When Signorile revealed the sexual preferences of
such icons as Malcolm Forbes, many newspapers
and magazines at the time criticized him. Time mag
azine coined the term "outing" for what Signorile
was doing.
"They had to come up with a word that was vio
lent, nasty and separate," Signorile said, who is still
amazed that the media is "calling for intellectual
analysis of the same person they had demonized."
"When I look at it now several years later, it's
amazing to see how much [further] America has
come on the issue of the closet," Signorile said.
"We now view the closet as something that needs
to be broken down. We need to create a world where
the closet is not the place where you want to stay in,"
Signorile added.
As keynote speaker of the Bisexual, Gay and Les
bian Awareness Days at Stanford, Signorile ex-
pressed admiration at the orga
nization of the events.
"It's the kind of stuff we
never had when I was in college
13 years ago," Signorile said.
As a journalism student at
Syracuse University, he was
part of a small group of gay stu
dents that was not politically
active.
"We were lucky to have our
wine and cheese from the admin
istration. It never dawned on us
that we needed to be more visi
ble," Signorile said.
After graduating from Syra
cuse, Signorile worked as an
entertainment publicist and
then as a freelance writer for
national magazines.
He later got involved with the
gay organization ACT UP! and
eventually wrote a column for
Outweek magazine, where he
began "outing" people. Now a
contributing writer for Out mag
azine, Signorile authored the
national best-seller "Queer in

America,"in which he analyzed
the relationship between gays,
the closet and the media.
Signorile ended his speech by
urging gays to come out of the
closet. "Deep down we're hiding
something about ourselves that
we shouldn't be hiding," he said.
"When it comes to our libera
tion, the only ones who are going
to save us are ourselves."
