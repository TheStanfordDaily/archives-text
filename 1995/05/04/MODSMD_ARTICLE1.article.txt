# Casper to tell school's state
## Fac Sen will debate science core 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The University's accomplishments this year
and its path for next year will be the focus of Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper's State of the
University address today.
Casper will give his annual address at 4:15 p.m.
in Kresge Auditorium.
In an overview of the University during the past
year, Casper will speak about research on under
graduate education at Stanford and new programs
that have developed from discussions and debate,
a University press release said.
This year, the Faculty Senate has passed a
number of recommendations made by the Com
mission on Undergraduate Education in its report
released last October, resulting in the strengthen
ing of the language requirement and a new option
to minor for students.
Casper will discuss these changes and other de
cisions still to come, the release said.
"Today, as we survey our work lives, we are
spending much less of our time and energy in deal
ing with problems of the past or reacting to crises
of the present and much more in productively seiz
ing the day," Casper said in the release.
Several other recommendations from the com
mission, which was chaired by History Prof.
James Sheehan, are still being developed or debat
ed by the senate.
At today's Faculty Senate meeting, members of
the Mathematics-Engineering-Science Core com
mittee — a committee working on the commis
sion's recommendations for changes in the science
requirements — will report on its progress, com
mittee chair and Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood
said. The committee sent out requests for propos
als for possible tracks in the core at the end of
March; proposals must be submitted by May 19.
The proposed science core will include several
tracks — each with three courses — spanning a
year of study. The core would give students anoth
er option for fulfilling the science, engineering and
mathematics distribution requirements.
Science, engineering and math faculty have
been asked to design possible tracks, working from
a basic set of requirements for
material that needs to be cov
ered.
The committee has gathered
additional statistics about how
students fulfill the three science
DRs now, which Osgood said he
thought would interest faculty
members.

Several faculty members have
inquired about the tracks and
the program already, Osgood
said.
"There's certainly interest in
it," Osgood said. "There's also
skepticism. That's natural. No
one knows quite what the pro
gram will look like."
Casper will address the issue
of science and technology and
how it will change the University
during the second part of his
State of the University address.

the release said.
"The Internet will make it
unnecessary for students to trav
el long distances," Casper said in
the release. "Computer bulletin
boards and other electronic fora
will become more structured and
organized."
The changes will leave a big
question to be answered, Casper
said. "Will technological substi
tution be complete or will the
University as a physical space
continue to attract students?"
