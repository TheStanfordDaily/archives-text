Serbs attack Zagreb
ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) â€” Serb
missiles spread terror through the
heart of the elegant capital yester
day, smashing into a children's hos
pital, a theater and other sites. One
policeman was killed and 64 people
were injured, including children
and foreign ballet dancers.
Twenty-one dancers from the
Vienna-based Danube Ballet Com
pany, who were wounded during a
rehearsal at the Academy of Dra
matic Arts, were rushed to the Hos
pital of the Sisters of Mercy. A
Briton, a Pole and a Moldovan
dancer were among the injured, as
was Croatia's prima ballerina.
The Children's Hospital was hit

by one missile, which landed in the
inner courtyard, scattering shrap
nel through windows and walls.
Six people were injured, includ
ing children, hospital employees
said.
The policeman was killed 15
minutes after the impact when he
tried to defuse a still-live cluster
bomb carried by the missile,
authorities said.
The Serbs' attack was in revenge
for their loss of lives and land to a
Croatian army offensive this week.
Croatian President Franjo Tudj
man warned of retaliation if Zagreb
was attacked again. "If such a crim
inal attack is conducted only once
again, Croatia will undertake most
decisive steps," he said.

Race-based aid supported
WASHINGTON (AP) - In the
midst of its review of affirmative action
programs, the Clinton administration
defended the use of blacks-only schol
arships at the University of Maryland.
In a brief filed yesterday with the
Supreme Court, the administration
argued in support of race-based schol
arships used to correct previous segre
gation at the university's College Park
campus.
The administration's action sug
gests that scholarships similar to the
one in question would survive the
sweeping White House review of affir
mative action. Administration officials
cautioned against such speculation,
however.
