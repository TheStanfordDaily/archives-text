# Foster gains GOP support
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Benefiting from
his high-stakes hearings, Henry Foster won
key Republican support yesterday in his
struggle for confirmation as surgeon gener
al. Democrats warned they might obstruct
legislation if the GOP blocks a vote by the
full Senate.
Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont became
the first Republican on the Labor and
Human Resources Committee to declare his
support for Foster, saying the 61-year-old
obstetrician had done a "superb job in taking
care of the lingering, critical issues" in his
two days in the witness chair.
An advocate of sexual abstinence for teen
agers, Foster offered a glimpse of his physi
cian's style when asked how he would coun
sel a young, unmarried woman who came to
his office with an unwanted pregnancy.
"I say you have a dilemma by your own
definition ... I say, there are only three
rational things that you can do: You can
have the baby and keep it, you can have the

baby and put it up for adoption, or you can
have an abortion," Foster said. "But which
of those you choose has to be based on your
own underpinnings, your moral values, your
support system, your minister."
A former medical school dean, Foster
renewed the central points of Tuesday's tes
timony. He reaffirmed that he had per
formed 39 abortions in four decades as a doc
tor; that he heeded ethics standards of the
time when he performed sterilization opera
tions on four retarded women; that he didn't
know about a federal program that left men
untreated for syphilis in Tuskegee, Ala.,
until it became public knowledge in 1972.
Jeffords' announcement left supporters
searching for one more vote to guarantee
committee approval on a panel with nine
Republicans and seven Democrats. A vote is
expected within several weeks.
Uncommitted Republican Bill Frist
showed sympathy for Foster in both days of
hearings.
