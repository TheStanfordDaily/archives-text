## Gross incompetence 
### 
By ignoring its Bylaws
ASSU elevated politics
above student interests

CALLING THE ASSU incom
petent is nothing new. How
ever, actions — or lack there
of — taken by senators since the
election suggest the organization
has reached a new level of inepti
tude.
The ASSU showed an utter lack
of responsibility in not appointing
a hearings commission before the
spring elections. Because one was
not created, the senate was never
able to investigate allegations of
elections violations, which ranged
from illegal use of electronic mail
to unfair access to University
phone banks for campaigning.
In the long run, we all lose if an
organization that is supposed to
represent us fails even to try to cor
rect appearances of impropriety.

The recent hearings com
mittee scandal shares a key
characteristic of previous
ASSU screw-ups — failure
to take responsibility.
The ASSU failed to follow
the language of one of its
Bylaws, which specifically
requires that the senate cre-

ate a committee during winter
quarter to investigate elections vio
lations. When the senate neglected
to do so, we didn't hear any outcry
and Senate Chair Nawwar Kas
rawi, who is of
the senate, was conspicuously
silent.
True to ASSU form, the senate
tried half-heartedly to rectify its
mistake earlier this quarter. It
appointed a nominations commis
sion chair, who has the authority to
create a hearings commission.
Unfortunately, the chair was
appointed just last Tuesday, leav
ing her only a week to create a com
mission and investigate the
charges before the election was
slated to be certified by the senate.
Despite the obstacles, there was

time to do it. Unfortunately, mem
bers of the current COP and Sen
ate Chair Kasrawi didn't consider
it necessary because they felt that
it was not in the interests of the
senate. They ignored calls for a
special senate meeting to create
the new committee and pushed
through the bill that certified the
election. That bill passed 10-5 with
two abstentions.
That a committee to investigate
alleged elections fraud is not in the
interests of the ASSU Senate
might be true; that it is not in the
interests of the students those sen
ators are supposed to represent is
just plain false.
There were a number of suspi
cious election activities in the
recent campaign and there was cer
tainly enough evidence for hear
ings. Not surprisingly, few dis
agreed with that after it became
clear that investigations weren't
going to happen.
At Tuesday's meeting, COP
member Mork Murdock criticized

the senate, the nominations
commission and the elec
tion commission — every
one except for himself, it
seems — for failing to cre
ate the hearings committee.
However, as a former ASSU
senator himself, Murdock
should have known that a

committee needed to be appointed
— and we didn't hear anything
from him before the current fiasco.
Murdock also argued that con
vening a special meeting on Friday
to create the hearings committee
would have been "irresponsible at
the time."
Maybe, but failing to do any
thing in response to allegations of
elections violations is even more
irresponsible, as is intentionally
ignoring ASSU Bylaws.
Although we have our doubts,
we will attribute the latest ASSU
foul-up to the same cause as all the
rest — gross incompetence.
Students can be relieved that at
least this senate is on its way out.
We can only hope that the new one
is somewhat more capable.
