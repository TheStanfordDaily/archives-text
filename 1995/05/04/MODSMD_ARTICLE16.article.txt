Directory tax scandal showed irresponsibility of Howe

AS A CONCERNED graduating
senior, I am incensed and outraged
by the ineptitude of one adminis
trator at this University, whose actions
could end up costing us all a bundle. In
addition, she has lied to us all and, maybe
more important, the Internal Revenue
Service.
I am speaking of Nanci Howe who, in
denying responsibility for the Directory's
unpaid taxes, has claimed that the Direc
tory's finances do not fall under her juris
diction, that the Directory is not a project
of the Office of Student Activities and
that she simply was not aware that the
Directory had to pay taxes. None of these
assertions are true.
The day-to-day operations of the Direc-

Tory are run by students. However, Nanci
Howe mandates that all major decisions
concerning the Directory are approved by
her and that all payroll and petty-cash
spending is run by Student Activities. In
addition, Nanci Howe has taken revenues
from the Directory in the past and spent
them to fill holes in her budget.
And for Nanci Howe to say that the
Directory is not a project of the Office of
Student Activities is an insult to my intel
ligence. She said in a memorandum in
1991 that the Directory "is a University
project managed by the Office of Student
Activities." Whether the Directory filed
for voluntary student organization status
two weeks ago or not is irrelevant: When
the Directory was making its profits,

Nanci Howe declared herself in charge of
the Directory and spent its profits at her
discretion.
Finally, there is no question that
Nanci Howe knew she had to pay taxes
on the Directory's profits. University
Accounting Officer Chris Canellos has
already said that he has told her for at
least two years that the Directory must
pay taxes on its surplus revenue. Even if
he hadn't, as early as May of 1992, the
Office of Student Activities knew the
Directory may have to pay taxes. Why
didn't Nanci Howe make an effort to find
a definite answer?
The fact is she hasn't paid the taxes to
the IRS that she knew she had to pay at
least two years ago, if not three. Now that

the IRS knows, there is talk of an ASSU
audit which would cost the students and
administration of Stanford thousands of
hours and thousands of dollars that we
just don't have.
With the costs of the indirect-cost
scandal still so fresh in so many of our
minds, the present administration should
conduct an investigation into this situa
tion immediately. If these recently sur
faced facts are all found to be untrue,
then Nanci Howe will be vindicated. But
if they are true, then she must be held
responsible for the student costs and
scarred reputation her actions will surely
bring.
