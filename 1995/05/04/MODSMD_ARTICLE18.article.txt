## Relationship off-roading 
### 
ONCE UPON a time, I thought the
deal was that you meet your soul
mate during freshman year. And
you live in the same dorm. In a stroke of
housing randomness, like little fxshies
ready to spawn, you're matched for life. Ta
da.
That's how it worked for everyone's par
ents, with their quaint fairy tales: I thought
he was such a geek (giggle)... We were
trapped in the library during the blizzard of
'69 (knowing 100k).... She lived across the
hall and I ignored her (sigh)....
A Harry and Sally thing. It should hap
pen to you.
So you hang out. You're friends. You
hang out more. You're best friends. You get
together. You fight and make up. End of
story. Start naming the babies.
My theory died a sudden and brutal
death when freshman year ended without
fireworks. There was still next year. There
was still time.
But yesterday, I heard the line from
someone who's been out there for 10 years.
Someone who can look back with glassy
eyes to Stanford days of yore and give mem
ories a good stretch. The finality of her
words was chilling. She said, "Finding the
right one? Child, it just gets harder from
here on out."
Great.
What everyone wants to hear. That this
is the prime of everything — best times,
best friends, best chance to get hitched —
so we should get ready to pack it in with the
rest of the old hags. Order the J Crew rock
ing chair.

And you hear that relationships are a
five-unit class, or an honors thesis if you're
a co-dependent type, so who has time any
way. All those mixed messages.
Hag shmag.
If the sage is right, there's time to move
into the fray. Check out the fuss. But first,
you've got to make yourself attached.
Before you start searching.
See, in a twist of romantic irony, attrac
tiveness jumps exponentially when one of
you in the coyly staring duo is attached.
Committed. Spoken for. Simply because
it's taboo.
Take a look around. (Look, but don't
touch.)
Everyone's frolicking. Traversing the
campus on the big search, as unsubtly as
salamanders heading down to the lake. To
do the springtime mambo. And to figure
out what frolicking is anyway, as if anyone
really knows.
Tevas, tanktops and torsos. Time to
start jogging. Again.
Lust settles like pollen while you're
turning pasty thighs to Kentucky Fried
crisp in the sun. Suddenly, that guy next to
you reading the same page of Nietzsche for
the 10th time starts looking hot.
And when you remember that he's in
one of those monogamous relationships
that seem remarkably like marriage except
for the joint tax-returns part, he looks hot
ter. Much hotter. And you realize you're
sweating.
Our most wanted are always attached,
and they are wanted because they are
attached. People who have that aura of

don't-hit-on-me-I'm-taken are just more
interesting than everyone else. They're
alluring. They're aloof. Maybe they have
something to say, they're probably worth
it, but it doesn't matter. You just find your
self wanting.
It's always more fun to play with some
one else's toys.
"Taken" means that someone else has
done the prescreening and given the
thumbs up. And a taken one, by definition,
has relationship savvy. Or at least a clue.
Bingo, that's a keeper. You know the value
of the prize that everyone wants.
The illusion of scarcity. Place your bets.
People moan that the best get snagged
early. As if we're picking fruit, and after
awhile, only the rotted-out, sickly ones are
left. Rolling around, pathetically.
Really, the off-the-market ones may just
appear to be the best. But the idea works.
We sit around like a bunch of saps and
covet.
Time for someone to covet you.
If you're not hitched, pretend. Of course
you 're involved. Get creative with your tale
of Harry back in Jersey. Because it's just
better to go out of bounds.
Relationship off-roading.
Oh, if you really are involved, even if it
wasn't a freshman tango, hold tight to your
find. Because someone out there is stalking.
