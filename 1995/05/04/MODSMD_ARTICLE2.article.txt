# A 						familia parted

### Colleen Krueger Senior staff writer 
Just one year after Chicano / Latino students led
a highly publicized hunger strike combating what

they felt was a lack of institution
al respect for their community,
many of those same students are
disappointed that very little has
changed at Stanford.
But for one family — a family
which served as the inspiration
and the catalyst for last year's ac
tion — everything has changed.
They are the Burciagas, and
their name, for some, has become

synonymous with last year's student uprising.
A little over a year ago, Tony and Cecilia Burcia
ga were the resident fellows at Casa Zapata — where
Tony says the couple spent nine years "building a
loving and tolerant familia." Cecilia, then the high
est-ranking Chicana administrator at Stanford, was
a vice provost for student affairs and had spent 20

years in various positions over
seeing Chicano, faculty and stu
dent affairs.
Then, over spring break last
year, Cecilia was told "very firm
ly and clearly that I was no longer
wanted at Stanford, and it was
time to wash the institutional
memory clean," she said in an
interview Tuesday. Cecilia was
laid off — a victim of budget cuts
— and despite student protest,
was not offered another position
within the University.
One year later, the Burciagas
have found themselves in "a dif
ferent world," Tony said.
Diagnosed with cancer last
January, Tony had a 10-pound
malignant gastrointestinal tumor
removed earlier this year — only
to be told less than two weeks ago
of the existence of five more
tumors. He just finished
chemotherapy treatments last
week, and will undergo another
treatment in three weeks.
Cecilia's new position at the
soon-to-be-opened California
State University at Monterey Bay
requires that she spend most of
this year apart from Tony, who is
staying at the couple's home in
Menlo Park so Cecilia's son can
graduate from high school with

his class. Her new health insur
ance plan is not as comprehen
sive as her Stanford plan, she
said, and she left 11 months of
sick leave unused that she could
have spent with Tony during his
illness.
While Tony said he tries not to
focus on the negative, Cecilia
admitted that the "profound
sense of aching and anger" she
feels has not yet disappeared.
"I hope [ProvostJ Condoleezza
Rice is happy," Cecilia said, "She
has devastated my family. I will
never understand why they did
this to me.
"Every time I go to the hospi
tal with Tony, the anger comes
back," she said. "I remember, so
clearly, going to meet with |Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs] Mary Edmonds for three
minutes and then being sent off
to see Condi.
"It was so strange. Condi was
talking about 'Oh, Cecilia, I
remember when I first came, you
were the first to take me to the
Faculty Club,' and I just couldn't
believe what was happening. It
was so political and so well calcu
lated," Cecilia remembered.
In fact, the March 21, 1994,
lay-off of Cecilia Burciaga was
simply one of several "indigni
ties" community members cited
as leading to their non-violent
protest; an incident of racist com
ments made at a May Flicks

screening of a short film about
pesticides was probably the more
immediate stimulus for action.
Nonetheless, it is the image of
the Burciagas — holding hands
in the rain and visibly moved by
the student's devotion — that
many will remember from the
hunger strike, which started
exactly a year ago today.
"When the hunger strike was
called, we didn't know about it —
we were so caught by surprise,"
said an emotional Tony, stopping
frequently to regain his compo
sure. "When we heard about the
strike, I took my bike and I went
to see what was going on. It was
so touching to see people starving
for their convictions and for
Cecilia and myself... we were so
touched and humbled."
Cecilia remembered the pain
she felt, as a mother, when some
of the mothers of the four female
hunger strikers came to see their
daughters.
"It just devastated me," she
said. "But at the same time, their
actions inspired so many."
The Burciagas were both
openly critical of the current
direction of Stanford's adminis
tration.
"There is a tremendous sense
of institutional depression
there," Cecilia said. "People are
feeling powerless and beaten
down.
"It's not just the staff I worry

for, it is now the students," she
added. "I spoke to a friend in Stu
dent Affairs yesterday and she
was told . .. not to spend so much
time with students! In Student
Affairs? It really hurts me."
Tony pointed to a series of
recent administrative decisions,
including the proposed cancella
tion of the graduation procession,
which indicate that students'
opinions and needs are no longer
valued at Stanford.
"[University President Ger
hard] Casper makes these very
political decisions and tries to
blame them on his 'peons,' "
Tony said.
Both Cecilia and Tony agreed
that, although they still keep in
touch with their Stanford famil
ia, coming back to campus to pick
up mail can be painful and diffi
cult. Nonetheless, Tony said it is
getting easier to focus on the real
Stanford — the students.
"When I first left, I didn't pick
up The Daily, it didn't concern
me anymore and it was just too
painful," Tony said. "Now I do
pick up The Daily and it is a good
feeling to read it, even though I
am not a part of it.
"It just makes me remember
that, in the end, it's the students
at Stanford that call the shots,
not the president or the faculty,"
he added. "You are the ones with
the power. As long as that will be
I'm not afraid of Casper."
