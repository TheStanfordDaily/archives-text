## Seniors on the road to recovery Chiminello and Berris put pain in its place—in the past 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The season is young. The Stanford
women's tennis team has just blown
the visiting Fresno State Bulldogs off
the courts of the Stanford Tennis Sta
dium 9-0 without their No. 2 and 3
players in the lineup. The girls walk
off the court, put the sweats back on
and begin making their way back to
the dorms for dinner.
In the corner of the women's ten
nis office, however, stands co-captain
Amy Chiminello, a 6-1, 6-1 winner at
the No. 3 position, three spots above
her usual No. 6 slot. One does not
sense celebration, relief or relaxation
on the face of the seasoned redshirt
senior. As she laces up her shoes, puts
on the headphones, and heads over to
the exercise bike, she responds to the
surprise of the office's inhabitants, "I
need to work harder than that [6-1, 6-
11. It was like 45 minutes, and I hard
ly even broke a sweat. That's not a
workout."
A 45-minute workout, consisting of
preying upon virtually a noncompeti
tive opponent, would not quite cut it
on the journey back from two surgical
operations to correct her toes. Not
after she had missed 18 consecutive
months of college tennis dating back
to the 1993 NCAA championship
tournament. Not after she had been
bedridden twice for a total of four
weeks. Chiminello would not find sat
isfaction in one mere victory.
It takes a lot more than that to
come back from an extensive injury,
as the other Cardinal co-captain,
junior Beth Berris can attest. Berris
began to feel pain in her right wrist a
month before last year's NCAA
championship tournament, which the
Cardinal lost in the final round.

Berris dismissed it at the time,
accepting the bumps and bruises that
any athlete has to fight through on a
daily basis.
However, the discomfort grew into
excruciating pain as the season wore
on, and Berris had to remove herself
from the singles lineup for the cham
pionships in Georgia. The application
of ice and cortisone was not effective.
"Every time I hit a forehand, it felt
like a knife was going through my
wrist," remembered Berris. She took
the summer off from tennis complete
ly after the disheartening Cardinal
loss, to allow her wrist to heal on its
own.
Chiminello did the same, hoping
that rest and relaxation would facili
tate the disappearance of 12 to 15
blisters on each foot and the return of
her toes from a scrunched, pulled
back position.
Neither player had her hopes real
ized. Berris felt as if her wrist strength
had returned coming into this season
in the fall, yet the beginning of prac
tice brought back the pain and sent
her to surgery, a place all too familiar
for Chiminello, who had been to the
operating table twice by that time.
In the fall of 1993, Chiminello
underwent surgery to remove joints
in eight different toes of her two feet.
The process was not unfamiliar to her
doctor, who had performed the exact
surgery before, but only on one toe of
one foot. He had never seen such an
extensive case of this problem.
The procedure sent Chiminello
straight to bed for the next two
weeks; she then began her recupera
tion. Exercises and physical therapy
with marbles and towels began the
process, and in January, doctors told
her she could begin running again and
hitting carefully.

Disaster accompanied those direc
tions, however, as Chiminello would
soon discover. She had a tough time
trusting her feet, running only
extremely gingerly.
Finally mustering the courage to
run 100 percent for the first time
since May 1993, she fell to the floor of
a Boston tennis court, writhing in
agonizing pain. "I felt like I had bro
ken all of my toes or something. I
screamed and went to the floor," she
reflected.
Despite the surgery, Chiminello's
toes had fused together without the
benefit of casting. She hit the table for
the second time in five months in
order to let doctors intentionally break
her toes and ensure that they would
heal properly. In order to do so, they
inserted pins into her toes so they
could align themselves appropriately.
"If I wore sandals, you would've
been able to see the pins sticking out
of my toes," Chiminello said. "I didn't
wear sandals very much needless to
say."
At that point, the 1994 season
became out of the question, and she
redshirted, aiming for a comeback for
the beginning of this season.
Berris's surgery, "a six compart
ment release," sought to repair what
was deemed a tendon and ligament
problem. "The day I found out that I
had to have surgery was the worst,
the worst day of my life," said Berris.
After the surgery in November doc
tors told the junior she would miss
between six and 10 weeks of the sea
son, depending on how effective the
surgery was and how quick her recu
peration went. The recovery entailed
mostly physical therapy, which began
only two weeks after the surgery.
