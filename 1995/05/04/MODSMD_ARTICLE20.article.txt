## Seniors on the road to recovery Chiminello and Berris put pain in its place—in the past 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The season is young. The Stanford
women's tennis team has just blown
the visiting Fresno State Bulldogs off
the courts of the Stanford Tennis Sta
dium 9-0 without their No. 2 and 3
players in the lineup. The girls walk
off the court, put the sweats back on
and begin making their way back to
the dorms for dinner.
In the corner of the women's ten
nis office, however, stands co-captain
Amy Chiminello, a 6-1, 6-1 winner at
the No. 3 position, three spots above
her usual No. 6 slot. One does not
sense celebration, relief or relaxation
on the face of the seasoned redshirt
senior. As she laces up her shoes, puts
on the headphones, and heads over to
the exercise bike, she responds to the
surprise of the office's inhabitants, "I
need to work harder than that [6-1, 6-
11. It was like 45 minutes, and I hard
ly even broke a sweat. That's not a
workout."
A 45-minute workout, consisting of
preying upon virtually a noncompeti
tive opponent, would not quite cut it
on the journey back from two surgical
operations to correct her toes. Not
after she had missed 18 consecutive
months of college tennis dating back
to the 1993 NCAA championship
tournament. Not after she had been
bedridden twice for a total of four
weeks. Chiminello would not find sat
isfaction in one mere victory.
It takes a lot more than that to
come back from an extensive injury,
as the other Cardinal co-captain,
junior Beth Berris can attest. Berris
began to feel pain in her right wrist a
month before last year's NCAA
championship tournament, which the
Cardinal lost in the final round.

Berris dismissed it at the time,
accepting the bumps and bruises that
any athlete has to fight through on a
daily basis.
However, the discomfort grew into
excruciating pain as the season wore
on, and Berris had to remove herself
from the singles lineup for the cham
pionships in Georgia. The application
of ice and cortisone was not effective.
"Every time I hit a forehand, it felt
like a knife was going through my
wrist," remembered Berris. She took
the summer off from tennis complete
ly after the disheartening Cardinal
loss, to allow her wrist to heal on its
own.
Chiminello did the same, hoping
that rest and relaxation would facili
tate the disappearance of 12 to 15
blisters on each foot and the return of
her toes from a scrunched, pulled
back position.
Neither player had her hopes real
ized. Berris felt as if her wrist strength
had returned coming into this season
in the fall, yet the beginning of prac
tice brought back the pain and sent
her to surgery, a place all too familiar
for Chiminello, who had been to the
operating table twice by that time.
In the fall of 1993, Chiminello
underwent surgery to remove joints
in eight different toes of her two feet.
The process was not unfamiliar to her
doctor, who had performed the exact
surgery before, but only on one toe of
one foot. He had never seen such an
extensive case of this problem.
The procedure sent Chiminello
straight to bed for the next two
weeks; she then began her recupera
tion. Exercises and physical therapy
with marbles and towels began the
process, and in January, doctors told
her she could begin running again and
hitting carefully.

Disaster accompanied those direc
tions, however, as Chiminello would
soon discover. She had a tough time
trusting her feet, running only
extremely gingerly.
Finally mustering the courage to
run 100 percent for the first time
since May 1993, she fell to the floor of
a Boston tennis court, writhing in
agonizing pain. "I felt like I had bro
ken all of my toes or something. I
screamed and went to the floor," she
reflected.
Despite the surgery, Chiminello's
toes had fused together without the
benefit of casting. She hit the table for
the second time in five months in
order to let doctors intentionally break
her toes and ensure that they would
heal properly. In order to do so, they
inserted pins into her toes so they
could align themselves appropriately.
"If I wore sandals, you would've
been able to see the pins sticking out
of my toes," Chiminello said. "I didn't
wear sandals very much needless to
say."
At that point, the 1994 season
became out of the question, and she
redshirted, aiming for a comeback for
the beginning of this season.
Berris's surgery, "a six compart
ment release," sought to repair what
was deemed a tendon and ligament
problem. "The day I found out that I
had to have surgery was the worst,
the worst day of my life," said Berris.
After the surgery in November doc
tors told the junior she would miss
between six and 10 weeks of the sea
son, depending on how effective the
surgery was and how quick her recu
peration went. The recovery entailed
mostly physical therapy, which began
only two weeks after the surgery.


Matthew Lawrence — Daily
Senior co-captains Amy Chiminello and Beth Berris have fought back from injuries to lend
leadership and experience to a young Stanford women's tennis squad.
After therapy, doctors allowed
her to practice for limited
amounts of time beginning in
January. The first time, she
stepped onto the court for only 15
minutes, a time period which
grew slowly, about five minutes
every couple of days.
"That was hard," Berris
recalled. "I was so excited to play.
It's like just getting a little teaser.
I really wanted to play and I
couldn't."
As Berris's practice time grew
and grew, her hunger to join the
team did as well. She had been
exercising her leadership all year
without being able to back it up
with successful play, and her
desire to get back into competi
tive tennis increasingly rose.
"It wasn't so hard to be out of
tennis for a while. I could experi
ence Stanford as a normal stu
dent. But when I started to play a
little, like 15 minutes a day, that
was probably the hardest part of

my recovery.
The middle of February
marked her first full practice, one
that had been anticipated from
that first 15-minute tease. The
comeback became a reality a little
over a month later when she
entered the Cardinal lineup at
the No. 3 doubles spot with fresh
man Julie Scott in a dual match
versus San Diego State Universi
ty, which the duo won, 6-1, 6-1.
Berris has not blemished those
winning ways and is undefeated
since her return in both singles
and doubles. A permanent seat in
the lineup with Scott at the No. 3
doubles position and a come from
behind, match-saving victory at
California highlight her come
back. She has posted a 5-0 singles
record, sitting seventh in the
lineup, undoubtedly prepared to
compete if necessary.
"As far as games, I feel I'm
ready. I'm No. 7, so if someone is
injured, I have to be ready to
play, and I feel I'm ready to play
an NCAA match. I think I can do
it."
Chiminello had been at the
zenith of her collegiate career

when her injury made her obso
lete. She had been consistently
beating players that now rank
among the top 10 this season
such as Kori Davidson, Jane Chi,
Keri Phebus and Kelly Pace.
She envisions her fifth year,
next season, as an opportunity to
get back to that caliber of tennis,
but this season has by no means
been a let down. Chiminello's
matches, played mostly at the
No. 6 singles position, have pro
vided virtually an automatic
point for the Cardinal through
out the season. She has compiled
a 17-1 dual-match record, boost
ing her Stanford career record to
63-5, good for 11th in Stanford's
all-time women's tennis record
book.
As if intended by nature, she
has stood as a leader for this
young, impressionable team. As
co-captains, she and Berris found
themselves helping a team of four
freshmen and three sophomores
adjust to the grind of college ten
nis.
Chiminello thrived in the posi
tion — whether it was bouncing
through practice with that

immortal enthusiasm or grinding
through a third set 21-19 loss in a
tie-breaker, she was there setting
an example.
"I think I bring positive energy
and enthusiasm to the team," she
said of her role. "And also I think
leadership and experience. I've
never been in a leadership posi
tion on the team, like I've never
played one or two, but I don't
think that you need to be."
"I was quoted as saying that
she's the heart and soul of the
Stanford tennis team and I think
that's very true," said head coach
Frank Brennan.
"You have to remember that I
didn't get to play for 18 months,"
Chiminello explained. "I cherish
it. Every time anybody's moaning
or when I'm moaning, I think,
'My God, I couldn't do this for 18
months. This is great.' "
The senior took Scott and Ania
Bleszynski under her wing at the
onset of the season, showing
them the ropes of collegiate ten
nis: how to balance tennis, school
and a social life — and how to
relate with Brennan. She began
as Bleszysnki's doubles partner

at the beginning of the season,
providing a necessary spark for
the freshman. She then switched
to playing with Scott for the bulk
of the season, creating a team of
two players who both utilize their
quickness.
For the two youngsters, she
was anything from a workout
partner to just a friend. Ex-Stan
ford tennis player Heather Wil
lens gave Chiminello that service
as a freshman, and Chiminello
wanted to do the same for Scott
and Bleszynski.
"I think every coach takes
their senior captain, if you will
and says, 'Look, we got two fresh
men here, clue them in that this
is what it's going to be like and
get them acclimated."' Brennan
said.
While Chiminello led by exam
ple throughout the season in her
matches and in practice, Berris
could not do that. Joining the
team full time in February, she
had missed five months of court
time with the team.
"It's hard because being co
captain, you say things and you
have to lead by example, and I

couldn't do that," she said. "I
thought a lot of times my voice
wasn't weighted as much as it
could have been because I wasn't
out there proving myself."
Berris felt she had to make up
for her on-court absence and did
so by coming out to practice when
she didn't have to, by attending
workout sessions which she could
perform, and by traveling with
the team. "I think people got to
know me just through who I am
and that's how they decided to
value my opinion. And then when
I got back obviously helped."
Berris brings a different per
spective to the team than her co
captain. "I think I'm like the one
who tries to make people relax
and try to make them feel
good. ... I think you can work
hard and play hard. It's hard
when you're out there to think
it's not life or death."
While Chiminello gets people
going when they need to, Berris
helps them unwind when they get
too tight, and with a team which
has seven underclassmen out of
II players, that combination may
be the key to ultimate success.
The season is young. The Stanford
women's tennis team has just blown
the visiting Fresno State Bulldogs off
the courts of the Stanford Tennis Sta

an NCAA match. I think I can do
it."
Chiminello had been at the
zenith of her collegiate career

when her injury made her obso
lete. She had been consistently
beating players that now rank
among the top 10 this season
such as Kori Davidson, Jane Chi,
Keri Phebus and Kelly Pace.
She envisions her fifth year,
next season, as an opportunity to
get back to that caliber of tennis,
but this season has by no means
been a let down. Chiminello's
matches, played mostly at the
No. 6 singles position, have pro
vided virtually an automatic
point for the Cardinal through
out the season. She has compiled
a 17-1 dual-match record, boost
ing her Stanford career record to
63-5, good for 11th in Stanford's
all-time women's tennis record
book.
As if intended by nature, she
has stood as a leader for this
young, impressionable team. As
co-captains, she and Berris found
themselves helping a team of four
freshmen and three sophomores
adjust to the grind of college ten
nis.
Chiminello thrived in the posi
tion — whether it was bouncing
through practice with that

immortal enthusiasm or grinding
through a third set 21-19 loss in a
tie-breaker, she was there setting
an example.
"I think I bring positive energy
and enthusiasm to the team," she
said of her role. "And also I think
leadership and experience. I've
never been in a leadership posi
tion on the team, like I've never
played one or two, but I don't
think that you need to be."
"I was quoted as saying that
she's the heart and soul of the
Stanford tennis team and I think
that's very true," said head coach
Frank Brennan.
"You have to remember that I
didn't get to play for 18 months,"
Chiminello explained. "I cherish
it. Every time anybody's moaning
or when I'm moaning, I think,
'My God, I couldn't do this for 18
months. This is great.' "
The senior took Scott and Ania
Bleszynski under her wing at the
onset of the season, showing
them the ropes of collegiate ten
nis: how to balance tennis, school
and a social life — and how to
relate with Brennan. She began
as Bleszysnki's doubles partner

at the beginning of the season,
providing a necessary spark for
the freshman. She then switched
to playing with Scott for the bulk
of the season, creating a team of
two players who both utilize their
quickness.
For the two youngsters, she
was anything from a workout
partner to just a friend. Ex-Stan
ford tennis player Heather Wil
lens gave Chiminello that service
as a freshman, and Chiminello
wanted to do the same for Scott
and Bleszynski.
"I think every coach takes
their senior captain, if you will
and says, 'Look, we got two fresh
men here, clue them in that this
is what it's going to be like and
get them acclimated."' Brennan
said.
While Chiminello led by exam
ple throughout the season in her
matches and in practice, Berris
could not do that. Joining the
team full time in February, she
had missed five months of court
time with the team.
"It's hard because being co
captain, you say things and you
have to lead by example, and I

couldn't do that," she said. "I
thought a lot of times my voice
wasn't weighted as much as it
could have been because I wasn't
out there proving myself."
Berris felt she had to make up
for her on-court absence and did
so by coming out to practice when
she didn't have to, by attending
workout sessions which she could
perform, and by traveling with
the team. "I think people got to
know me just through who I am
and that's how they decided to
value my opinion. And then when
I got back obviously helped."
Berris brings a different per
spective to the team than her co
captain. "I think I'm like the one
who tries to make people relax
and try to make them feel
good. ... I think you can work
hard and play hard. It's hard
when you're out there to think
it's not life or death."
While Chiminello gets people
going when they need to, Berris
helps them unwind when they get
too tight, and with a team which
has seven underclassmen out of
II players, that combination may
be the key to ultimate success.
The season is young. The Stanford
women's tennis team has just blown
the visiting Fresno State Bulldogs off
the courts of the Stanford Tennis Sta
dium 9-0 without their No. 2 and 3
players in the lineup. The girls walk
off the court, put the sweats back on
and begin making their way back to
the dorms for dinner.
In the corner of the women's ten
nis office, however, stands co-captain
Amy Chiminello, a 6-1, 6-1 winner at
the No. 3 position, three spots above
her usual No. 6 slot. One does not
sense celebration, relief or relaxation
on the face of the seasoned redshirt
senior. As she laces up her shoes, puts
on the headphones, and heads over to
the exercise bike, she responds to the
surprise of the office's inhabitants, "I
need to work harder than that [6-1, 6-
11. It was like 45 minutes, and I hard
ly even broke a sweat. That's not a
workout."
A 45-minute workout, consisting of
preying upon virtually a noncompeti
tive opponent, would not quite cut it
on the journey back from two surgical
operations to correct her toes. Not
after she had missed 18 consecutive
months of college tennis dating back
to the 1993 NCAA championship
tournament. Not after she had been
bedridden twice for a total of four
weeks. Chiminello would not find sat
isfaction in one mere victory.
It takes a lot more than that to
come back from an extensive injury,
as the other Cardinal co-captain,
junior Beth Berris can attest. Berris
began to feel pain in her right wrist a
month before last year's NCAA
championship tournament, which the
Cardinal lost in the final round.

Berris dismissed it at the time,
accepting the bumps and bruises that
any athlete has to fight through on a
daily basis.
However, the discomfort grew into
excruciating pain as the season wore
on, and Berris had to remove herself
from the singles lineup for the cham
pionships in Georgia. The application
of ice and cortisone was not effective.
"Every time I hit a forehand, it felt
like a knife was going through my
wrist," remembered Berris. She took
the summer off from tennis complete
ly after the disheartening Cardinal
loss, to allow her wrist to heal on its
own.
Chiminello did the same, hoping
that rest and relaxation would facili
tate the disappearance of 12 to 15
blisters on each foot and the return of
her toes from a scrunched, pulled
back position.
Neither player had her hopes real
ized. Berris felt as if her wrist strength
had returned coming into this season
in the fall, yet the beginning of prac
tice brought back the pain and sent
her to surgery, a place all too familiar
for Chiminello, who had been to the
operating table twice by that time.
In the fall of 1993, Chiminello
underwent surgery to remove joints
in eight different toes of her two feet.
The process was not unfamiliar to her
doctor, who had performed the exact
surgery before, but only on one toe of
one foot. He had never seen such an
extensive case of this problem.
The procedure sent Chiminello
straight to bed for the next two
weeks; she then began her recupera
tion. Exercises and physical therapy
with marbles and towels began the
process, and in January, doctors told
her she could begin running again and
hitting carefully.

Disaster accompanied those direc
tions, however, as Chiminello would
soon discover. She had a tough time
trusting her feet, running only
extremely gingerly.
Finally mustering the courage to
run 100 percent for the first time
since May 1993, she fell to the floor of
a Boston tennis court, writhing in
agonizing pain. "I felt like I had bro
ken all of my toes or something. I
screamed and went to the floor," she
reflected.
Despite the surgery, Chiminello's
toes had fused together without the
benefit of casting. She hit the table for
the second time in five months in
order to let doctors intentionally break
her toes and ensure that they would
heal properly. In order to do so, they
inserted pins into her toes so they
could align themselves appropriately.
"If I wore sandals, you would've
been able to see the pins sticking out
of my toes," Chiminello said. "I didn't
wear sandals very much needless to
say."
At that point, the 1994 season
became out of the question, and she
redshirted, aiming for a comeback for
the beginning of this season.
Berris's surgery, "a six compart
ment release," sought to repair what
was deemed a tendon and ligament
problem. "The day I found out that I
had to have surgery was the worst,
the worst day of my life," said Berris.
After the surgery in November doc
tors told the junior she would miss
between six and 10 weeks of the sea
son, depending on how effective the
surgery was and how quick her recu
peration went. The recovery entailed
mostly physical therapy, which began
only two weeks after the surgery.


Matthew Lawrence — Daily
Senior co-captains Amy Chiminello and Beth Berris have fought back from injuries to lend
leadership and experience to a young Stanford women's tennis squad.
After therapy, doctors allowed
her to practice for limited
amounts of time beginning in
January. The first time, she
stepped onto the court for only 15
minutes, a time period which
grew slowly, about five minutes
every couple of days.
"That was hard," Berris
recalled. "I was so excited to play.
It's like just getting a little teaser.
I really wanted to play and I
couldn't."
As Berris's practice time grew
and grew, her hunger to join the
team did as well. She had been
exercising her leadership all year
without being able to back it up
with successful play, and her
desire to get back into competi
tive tennis increasingly rose.
"It wasn't so hard to be out of
tennis for a while. I could experi
ence Stanford as a normal stu
dent. But when I started to play a
little, like 15 minutes a day, that
was probably the hardest part of

my recovery.
The middle of February
marked her first full practice, one
that had been anticipated from
that first 15-minute tease. The
comeback became a reality a little
over a month later when she
entered the Cardinal lineup at
the No. 3 doubles spot with fresh
man Julie Scott in a dual match
versus San Diego State Universi
ty, which the duo won, 6-1, 6-1.
Berris has not blemished those
winning ways and is undefeated
since her return in both singles
and doubles. A permanent seat in
the lineup with Scott at the No. 3
doubles position and a come from
behind, match-saving victory at
California highlight her come
back. She has posted a 5-0 singles
record, sitting seventh in the
lineup, undoubtedly prepared to
compete if necessary.
"As far as games, I feel I'm
ready. I'm No. 7, so if someone is
injured, I have to be ready to
play, and I feel I'm ready to play
an NCAA match. I think I can do
it."
Chiminello had been at the
zenith of her collegiate career

when her injury made her obso
