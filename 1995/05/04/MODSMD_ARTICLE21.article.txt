# Scottish sensation takes Stanford by storm
## Mhairi McKay leads the No. 2 golfers into battle 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
Purple argyle socks.
That's what the best golfer on the No. 2-ranked
Stanford women's team wore to her first IM basketball
game last year.
OK, she was a freshman — but purple argyle socks?
"Hey, it's just natural for me to wear them," she said.
"No one wears white socks when they do athletics back
home. Then again, I don't play that much basketball."
"She had a tough time dribbling and shooting the
ball," said senior Amy Lawrence of her golfing (and
occasional hoops) teammate. "In fact, she had a tough
time all together, but she really had loads of fun out
there."
Luckily for Stanford, sophomore Mhairi McKay does
more than just air-ball four-foot jumpers. The native of
Glasgow, Scotland, is an integral part of the Universi
ty's quest for a record-tying fifth national title this
school year.
A first-team All-American as a freshman, McKay led
a young Cardinal team to a seventh-place showing at
last year's NCAA championships, placing 10th individ
ually.
She returned to the Farm a savvy sophomore, part
of a five-women starting lineup that has been together
now for the last two years. This season McKay has
already garnered victories in the Oregon Invitational,
the Santa Clara Invitational and the California Colle
giate.
"Mhairi is a fabulous golfer," said head coach Tim
Baldwin. "As good as she was last year, she's even bet
ter this year. But that has come from a lot of hard work
and dedication to the game."
This past summer, McKay — who hits the ball as
solidly as anyone — found herself "shanking" balls as
she participated in tournaments back in the United
Kingdom. This shocking development reached its low
point as McKay, for the first time in years, badly sliced
two consecutive shots in one event.
Mired in the worst slump of her young career,
McKay asked Baldwin for help when she returned to
Stanford in the fall. He directed her to Tom Quinn, a
swing specialist in Modesto, Calif., who worked with
McKay for several weeks.
"He totally redid my swing," McKay said of Quinn.
"I needed to get more consistency out of it. Hopefully,
it's coming along now."
Her four-under-par 142, which easily outdistanced
the rest of the field at the California Collegiate held at
the Stanford Golf Course in mid-April, was a clear indi
cation that McKay was back and better than ever.
"We had question marks about Mhairi at the begin
ning of the year," Baldwin said, "but she has laid to rest
those criticisms with her play of late. She has a new
found confidence."
Challenges of a different nature were presented to

McKay when she left her native Scotland to enroll at
Stanford. Upon first arriving at the Farm, she was
afraid that her new acquaintances would not be able to
understand her accent. But her fears quickly dissipated
as dorm mates and golfers alike took the time to pick up
the nuances in her speech, and vice versa.
"I think my accent has been drastically reduced,"
McKay said. "Being around Americans all the time will
do that to someone."
McKay had always hoped to attend university in the
United States. She wanted to go to a place that stressed
both academics and athletics, as she had seen a few
friends from home cross the Atlantic to attend
unknown schools, not being able to do much with their
education after graduation.
The two schools that provided her with this oppor
tunity and offered her full scholarships were Stanford
and Duke; she chose the former because Stanford is a
bit more of a golf power.
The fact that Janice Moody, a senior at San Jose
State, attended school down the road from the Farm
also persuaded McKay. Moody, McKay's relative equal
on the golf course, was a neighbor of hers in Glasgow
and the two played on the Scottish and British Junior
Ladies Golf Teams together.
"We have a joke that we are going to live 15 minutes
apart from one another all our lives," McKay said. "It
was nice to have a friend from home in the area to ease
the transition. She was there if I needed to talk to some

one, and that was important."
Not to say that her Stanford teammates didn't wel
come her. She and fellow newcomer Andrea Baxter,
now McKay's roommate, were immediately taken
around to see the best that the campus had to offer.
"The team is very close. We hang around each other
on and off the course," McKay said.
"We're the only ones who can put up with each
other," Baxter added. "We have tons of energy and we
keep everyone else on the team young."
McKay especially eryoys all that Baldwin has done
for her. If she has had a problem, golfing or otherwise,
he has been one of the first people to whom she has
turned.
"Tim takes care of us, but still treats us like adults,"
McKay said. "I think he is a great coach and a great per
son.
McKay and the rest of the Stanford women's golf
team have just a few more days to prepare for the West
ern Regionals, which take place May 11-13 in Tucson,
Ariz. The results from that event determine placement
for the all-important NCAA championships.
While the Sun Devils look to be extremely strong in
those tournaments, McKay warns against the folly of
not giving the Cardinal the respect it deserves.
"Arizona State is a beatable team," McKay said.
"Their golfers are no more capable of pulling out a
national championship than ours are."
Or, at least, of donning a pair of purple argyle socks.
