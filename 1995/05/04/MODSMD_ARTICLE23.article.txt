## Hideo Nomo makes debut 
### 
A lthough the San Francisco Giants defeated
/\ the Los Angeles Dodgers Tuesday with an
JL Xamazing four-run rally in the bottom of
the 15th inning, there was one Dodger who could
call the day a great success.
For Japanese pitcher Hideo Nomo, it seems
the major leagues and Dodger Blue suit him just

fine. In his mayor league debut, the right-hander
threw five innings of one-hit ball — against the
powerful Giants lineup no less. The poise dis
played by Nomo after walking the bases loaded
in the first inning brings back fond memories of
another non-English speaking Dodger rookie
who was as impressive as he was captivating.
Of course I'm talking about Fernando Valen
zuela, who burst onto the National League scene
in 1980. Fernando-mania was the talk of Los
Angeles, as the chubby teenager from Mexico —
who was quiet and shy among teammates and
the press — turned in one stellar performance
after another. Throughout his career with the
Dodgers, Fernando was always a fan favorite. He
brought out pride in Mexicans and Mexican-
Americans who followed his every pitch. Tomor
row, Valenzuela will take the mound as the start
ing pitcher for the San Diego Padres, a start
scheduled to coincide with Cinco de Mayo.
While Nomo has passed his first test in the
majors, he is still far from proving that he can
have the same impact on the league and on base
ball fans as Fernando did. So far, the interest
raised in his home country of Japan certainly
equals the hubbub that surrounded Valenzuela
in his first year with the Dodgers. Nomo was fol
lowed throughout the past few days by close to
100 members of the Japanese press, and the
game — which started at 4:35 am. in Japan —
was televised live.
But what type of impact will Nomo make here
in the States? Even with the large Asian-Ameri
can population in the Bay Area, attendance
remained dismal as a result of the players' strike.
But I think more than anything, Asian-Ameri
can sports fans across the nation are just not pre
pared to see an athlete from Japan in one of the
major professional leagues. Most were probably
stunned. Imagine a Japanese player in the NFL.
The NHL? Not terribly likely. The NBA? Never!
If an athlete from the Far East ever has a sub
stantial career in major professional athletics in
the United States, it will be in Mqjor League
Baseball. If Nomo doesn't have what it takes to
stick in the majors, it may be a long time before
another player ventures to the West or until gen
eral managers take on such a risk again. But if he
can ride his 90-plus mile-per-hour fastball to suc
cess, Nomo may open doors for other Japanese
players. Free trade between the two nations may
be a possibility at last. And at long last, the grow
ing Asian-American population in the United
States might have representation in the league
which so many of them follow and love.
