I know a guy who goes to shows
When he's at home and he blows his nose
He don't use tissues, or his sleeve
He don't use napkins, or any of these
He uses magazines...
—the Flaming I.ips* Wayne Coyne
Butt-head: How come he keeps singing about these people he
knows? Who gives a rat's ass?
Reavis: I know a guy
His hair is orange
He sucks!
It's not the typical way for a hand to get its first bit of main
stream exposure, but the Flaming Lips — Wayne Coyne,
Michael Ivins, Ronald Jones, and Steven Drozd — aren't the
typical mainstream band.
"When that first happened, I laughed," says Flaming Lips
drummer Steven Drozd. "Beavis and Butt-head cutting us

down, it was great."
But rather than cut the hand down, Beavisand
Butt-head really just marked the conversion

of the Flaming Lips from a weird punk
pop cult hand to full-fledged alterna-

tive favorites. And while hard-core
I.ips fans might be disappointed

with the transition, the flam
ing Lips are living a hit more
comfortably now, and A

they deserve it.
During the
course of our
early-morn
ing phone conver
sation, a slightly
groggy Steven
Drozd gets frus
trated with his cof
fee maker ("Hey
man, what's wrong
with my coffee

here?") and com
plains about his cord
less phone ("It's one of
these brand new Pana
sonic's and it doesn't stay

charged for very long —
I've got to get back closer to
my station.") He tells me that

most of the band lives about ten
blocks from the site of the recent
Oklahoma City bombing, hut other

than that, the group has everything to be
happy about.
After nearly a decade of churning out fascinat-

ing though underappreciated releases, the Flaming Lips
are finally getting some hard-earned recognition. But it's been
a long and rocky road up to this point. The band's first three al
bums, released on Restless Records, barely got into stores due
to lack of interest and lack of promotion. To make matters
worse, two weeks after their fourth, and arguably best, record
"In a Priest Driven Ambulance" was released, Restless Records
folded, making the album nearly impossible to find until it was
re-released earlier this year.
By 1990, the band had developed a small but devoted fol
lowing, but instead of having more attention placed on its
music, the band became best known for rumors of people
burning at concerts or other freakish incidents.
"It's an old legend — folklore from the mid-eighties," says
Drozd, describing one of the more prominent rumors from be
fore he was in the band. "The story was that some fanatic was
following the Lips around. The guys were like, 'Hey, we'll see
you later,' but the guy kept following them. They got to the
hotel, and the guy was still there. I think Wayne or somebody
ended up saying, 'Leave us alone, go to hell,' or something. And
the guy yelled "Shine On Sweet Jesus" and set himself on fire.
And the Lips just took off.

"But I don't know about that story," Drozd adds. "1 dont
want to dispel the myth or blow the magic or anything, but I
think it's a bullshit story."
Despite their cult-band status, the band soon got a deal
with Warner Brothers Records, but their next album,
"Hit to Death in the Future Head" (on which they did
the pubic hair album art thing years before the Black Crowes),
was delayed six months. In that time, the group's newly-added
guitarist and drummer both left the band, leaving frontman
Wayne Coyne working to salvage what was left of the Flaming
Lips.
Coyne recruited Ronald Jones to plav guitar and asked
Drozd to join the group 011 drums. "I thought about saying no
just because 1 didn't want to ruin my favorite band," Drozd
says. But he decided to accept the offer, and the new line-up
went to work on what would ultimately be their commercial
break-

through album, "Transmissions from the Satellite Heart."
Despite the new record's can't-lose mix of sickeningly catchy
pop ("She Don't Use Jelly," "Be My Head") and honestly bril
liant rock ("Moth in the Incubator," "Slow Nerve Action"), it
wasn't until nearly two years after its release that the album re
ceived the widespread attention that it enjoys now.
The band finished "Transmissions" in April of 1993, and they
followed it with months and months of touring with Porno for
Pyros, the Butthole Surfers and Stone Temple Pilots, the Grifters
and Codeine, Red Red Meat, Lollapalooza and Candlebox.
"We kept touring and touring, and all of the sudden, some
thing happened," Drozd says. "We have a song that everyone
likes. We were on the Candlebox tour at this point, and we
started noticing that these people that seemed like they would
never listen to our music — people with like bi-level haircuts
and Corona shirts — were singing along with our songs. It was
kind of bizarre."

Even more bizarre was their recent guest appearance on
Beverly Hills 90210. The Lips were on stage at the Peach
Pit After Dark, lip-syncing to "She Don't Use Jelly" in
front of the whole 90210 gang.
"Well, we tried to start a rumor that Tori Spelling had a
crush on Wayne, but it didn't really go anywhere," Drozd says.
"1 think the thing was, if people didn't get the joke, fuck em.
For us to be hanging out with those people is pretty funny. And
they are idiots. Don't be fooled. 1 didn't think you were, but
they're spoiled little brats. Tori Spelling sucks.
"We got in trouble because we had a trailer right outside
where they were shooting the scenes, and we ended up getting
really drunk, and they don't allow alcohol on the premises," he
adds. "So it was ridiculous, but I'm glad we did it."
Following their exhausting tour schedule and trip to 90210,
the band has finally found time to return to the studio to work
on a follow-up album, for a tentative September release.
They've completed seven songs, with plans for five or six more.
"There are definitely some of the same Flaming Lips weird
rock elements that there've always been," Drozd savs, de-

scribing the new material. Some of the crazy guitars,
or whatever you want to call that stuff.... And

I think Wayne's singing is very, very good
.. these davs."

Coyne, the band's chief lyricist,
spins spacy pop adventures,

some of which have been in
spired by the writings ol

Charles Fort, a 19th centu
rv writer who investieat

Ed various mysterious
unexplained events.

"He's a trip,
Drozd says."He
wasn't a scientist
or anything, but
he would like re
search and ched
out these phe
nomena, like
frogs falling from
the sky and stuff.'
Suddenly the
song "Frogs'
makes just a little

r more sense: "I'm
looking at the
sky / I'm waiting on the

rain / I'm waiting for the
frogs to fall down on me.'
"So von know, Drozd

adds, "Wayne might be reading
that one day and come up with
something, or he might just get in

spired from taking a shit or something. I
really don't know what he does."

But there's more to the band's full, atmospheric
sound than Coyne's light-headed storytelling
With layers of instrumentation piled on top o
each other, the Lips' musical creations are far more intricat*
than the "She uses va-a-aseline" chorus that everyone know
and hums. Trying to describe the group's sound, Drozd stum
bles through a few half-hearted attempts before ultimate!;
drawing a blank.
"I don't want to do the blank meets blank meets blank, be
cause that really sucks," he says."I don't know. Fuck. Well, it's.
pretty loud live show. You can count on that.... I don't know
Just don't use the word psychedelic.
Perhaps the best real insight into the Flaming Lips' ap
proach to music is Wayne Coyne's manipulating and accom
modating interview style.
"I think Wayne is pretty good at answering those kinds o
questions," Drozd says, "because he can dodge the question bu
give you another answer that you can use."
Just as Coyne's answers can give you what you need in .
backwards and round-about way, the Lips' slippery melodie
tend to float sweetly over your head, leaving you slightly con
fused but still naively satisfied.
