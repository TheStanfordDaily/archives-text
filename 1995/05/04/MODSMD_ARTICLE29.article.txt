# EURO-TRASH BAND KMFDM IS MORE THAN A PRETTY FACE
## 
### ELISABETH MORSE; GRAPHIC BY JOE ROSENBLUM 
KMFDM. Nobody knows what it stands
for. The hand claims it's meaningless.
But what I wanted to know is if there is
anything behind the facade formed by the un
filled name of a well-known industrial band.
Are their lives and music as empty as their
moniker? In a 45-minute phone conversation
with KMFDM's founder and leader, Sascha
Konietzko, responses were most forthcoming,
highly amusing and covered a large span of
topics. I don't know if my original philosophi
cal questions were answered but I certainly
learned a good deal about a band which ad
mits that it "sucks."
In the typical contradiction that seems in
herent to Sascha, he called me 40 minutes late
and then asked me to hold for a minute. Hack
on the line, his German accent was barely no
ticeable and we jumped right in.
On Touring
"Compared to other bands, we don't
hardly tour at all. It's a nice balance between
touring and recording. We just try to have a
lot of fun, destroy a lot of gear and just, like,
kick ass. We arc not really feeling that we are
entertainers or in the show business or
something, we just go out and have a good
time and do some punk rock shows."
Punk Rock?
"Of course, in a way. We are scum bags."
Serious Rebellion?
"Of course its serious. 1 mean, personal
ly, I 'm really pissed oil. I 'm always pissed off
at a lot of things. I mean, what can I write
lyrics about? Certainly not love songs or stu
pid stuff about ripping off my sweater or
shit. 1 write about stuff that pisses me off."
So what pisses you off?
"Like everything. Like you know. Like id
iots, bureaucrats, hypocritical people, any
thing. 1 mean, anything that has to do with
how dumb and ignorant people are and how
stupid they can be.... Led into doom with
out looking around. You know, that kind of
stuff. Normal issues, kitchen table issues."
What should people be like, then?
"Well, I don't really care that much about
people, at the same time. You know, it could
be a nice place sort of, could be nice, or
the world could be a nice place. But it's not.
So we might as well just celebrate and watch
things going down. There is no such thing as
the message of you know, 'Listen up, every
body, here's the singer,' sort of thing. Its
more like I'm singing what I'm pissed off at,
other people may or may not be able to
identify with it, but it seems like a lot of peo
ple do really and say, 'Oh, that's really cool
stuff.' So 1 just have to laugh."
Do you really hate everything?
"No, I don't really hate everything."
Let's try this: What do you like?
"What I really like is Mozart. Oh man, you
can see the whites in my eyes when I say
'Mozart.' Absolute joy. I mean, I don't know a
single piece by Mozart that I don't totally
dig."
What else?
"I like reading a lot. I read everything. I
just read for a third time 'A Prayer for Owen
Meany,' by John Irving. I just finished that.
Last night, I started the Johnny Rotten
book."
How about appreciation of Loyal Pissed
Off Fans?
"1 appreciate fans that don't look at us
like we're Pearl jam or something like that
— a product. You know, young people in
this country have a really hard time figuring

out when they grow up what is real and what
is advertising and they're all being sold.
Something like KMFDM and bands like that
seem to be more real than glamorous kinds
of product like U2 nowadays, or Nine Inch
Nails, speaking of hypocrites..."
And your attitude towards fame?
"I do sign autographs, but I don't say that
I don't give a fuck about it. I like having my
ass kissed. I like [fame] to a certain extent,
like a spoiled brat likes something. I'm just
going out to have a good time, so why not
get some of the appreciation, sort of. I'm
certainly not exploiting [fans], and I'm not
ripping them off. I'm not charging 30 bucks
for my T-shirts. So it's a fine line, like always,
you don't see things in black and white, you
see them in as many gray shades as you can."
Clicht, but true.
And Money (also a previous album title)?
"I do make money off of [KMFDM]. I'm
not making a fortune or anything, but I can
buy myself some equipment and I can buy
myself something to eat and a place to
sleep."

Hmmm, Priorities. Continue.
"I mean, I like to make money. Seriously,
I do. I mean, I'm working very hard, I have a
publishing music production company, like
a mail order company, so I'm working 25
hours, 8 days a week. But I want to make
money for things that are right, you know. I
don't want to take money for shit."
Oh, I see. What about your Not-So-Under
ground-Anymore Status?
"Well, that's the problem, really. If it were
up to us, up to me and En Esch (KMFDM's
lead singer), then we would like probably. ..
. I mean, I don't know. We would probably
make records just because we like making
records, but I don't know. Man, it's fucked
up, it's twisted, I don't know what to say."
Talk about the New Album, "Nihil."
"Nowadays, I'm doing KMFDM mostly
and |En Esch] is doing not really much at
all. On 'Angst' for example, he had quite
some input to say the least; he didn't have
hardly any input on 'Nihil.' I liked it a lot, I
didn't have to compromise anymore. I
mean, I just totally went by myself. Like

'Hey, hey, here we go.'
"It seems like making 'Nihil' really gave
me a lot of energy. I sort of liked it. 1 think
'Nihil' is definitely the best KMFDM record
to date."
Musical Integrity?
"I wouldn't he ashamed to rip something
good off, hut unfortunately 1 don't."
How was Seattle when you were recording
there?
"It sucked. It was boring. It was stupid. ..
kind of lame-assed."
(Sascha gets a cigarette. There is a slight
break in conversation.)
1 realize as a Stanford student, I Need to
Ask. (I know it's nerdy...)
Are you on the Net?
"Sometimes. It's all right. My modem
just exploded yesterday, so I'm getting a new
one tomorrow. It's not like I want to do it,
it's more like I have to do it, because other
wise, there's so many messages there. Right
now we are running a bulletin board and
stuff, and soon, we are going to have our
own page. It's all right, but I can't just sit
there and answer messages three hours a
day."

ly, I 'm really pissed oil. I 'm always pissed off
at a lot of things. I mean, what can I write
lyrics about? Certainly not love songs or stu
pid stuff about ripping off my sweater or
shit. 1 write about stuff that pisses me off."
So what pisses you off?
"Like everything. Like you know. Like id
iots, bureaucrats, hypocritical people, any
thing. 1 mean, anything that has to do with
how dumb and ignorant people are and how
stupid they can be.... Led into doom with
out looking around. You know, that kind of
stuff. Normal issues, kitchen table issues."
What should people be like, then?
"Well, I don't really care that much about
people, at the same time. You know, it could
be a nice place sort of, could be nice, or
the world could be a nice place. But it's not.
So we might as well just celebrate and watch
things going down. There is no such thing as
the message of you know, 'Listen up, every
body, here's the singer,' sort of thing. Its
more like I'm singing what I'm pissed off at,
other people may or may not be able to
identify with it, but it seems like a lot of peo
ple do really and say, 'Oh, that's really cool
stuff.' So 1 just have to laugh."
Do you really hate everything?
"No, I don't really hate everything."
Let's try this: What do you like?
"What I really like is Mozart. Oh man, you
can see the whites in my eyes when I say
'Mozart.' Absolute joy. I mean, I don't know a
single piece by Mozart that I don't totally
dig."
What else?
"I like reading a lot. I read everything. I
just read for a third time 'A Prayer for Owen
Meany,' by John Irving. I just finished that.
Last night, I started the Johnny Rotten
book."
How about appreciation of Loyal Pissed
Off Fans?
"1 appreciate fans that don't look at us
like we're Pearl jam or something like that
— a product. You know, young people in
this country have a really hard time figuring

out when they grow up what is real and what
is advertising and they're all being sold.
Something like KMFDM and bands like that
seem to be more real than glamorous kinds
of product like U2 nowadays, or Nine Inch
Nails, speaking of hypocrites..."
And your attitude towards fame?
"I do sign autographs, but I don't say that
I don't give a fuck about it. I like having my
ass kissed. I like [fame] to a certain extent,
like a spoiled brat likes something. I'm just
going out to have a good time, so why not
get some of the appreciation, sort of. I'm
certainly not exploiting [fans], and I'm not
ripping them off. I'm not charging 30 bucks
for my T-shirts. So it's a fine line, like always,
you don't see things in black and white, you
see them in as many gray shades as you can."
Clicht, but true.
And Money (also a previous album title)?
"I do make money off of [KMFDM]. I'm
not making a fortune or anything, but I can
buy myself some equipment and I can buy
myself something to eat and a place to
sleep."

Hmmm, Priorities. Continue.
"I mean, I like to make money. Seriously,
I do. I mean, I'm working very hard, I have a
publishing music production company, like
a mail order company, so I'm working 25
hours, 8 days a week. But I want to make
money for things that are right, you know. I
don't want to take money for shit."
Oh, I see. What about your Not-So-Under
ground-Anymore Status?
"Well, that's the problem, really. If it were
up to us, up to me and En Esch (KMFDM's
lead singer), then we would like probably. ..
. I mean, I don't know. We would probably
make records just because we like making
records, but I don't know. Man, it's fucked
up, it's twisted, I don't know what to say."
Talk about the New Album, "Nihil."
"Nowadays, I'm doing KMFDM mostly
and |En Esch] is doing not really much at
all. On 'Angst' for example, he had quite
some input to say the least; he didn't have
hardly any input on 'Nihil.' I liked it a lot, I
didn't have to compromise anymore. I
mean, I just totally went by myself. Like

'Hey, hey, here we go.'
"It seems like making 'Nihil' really gave
me a lot of energy. I sort of liked it. 1 think
'Nihil' is definitely the best KMFDM record
to date."
Musical Integrity?
"I wouldn't he ashamed to rip something
good off, hut unfortunately 1 don't."
How was Seattle when you were recording
there?
"It sucked. It was boring. It was stupid. ..
kind of lame-assed."
(Sascha gets a cigarette. There is a slight
break in conversation.)
1 realize as a Stanford student, I Need to
Ask. (I know it's nerdy...)
Are you on the Net?
"Sometimes. It's all right. My modem
just exploded yesterday, so I'm getting a new
one tomorrow. It's not like I want to do it,
it's more like I have to do it, because other
wise, there's so many messages there. Right
now we are running a bulletin board and
stuff, and soon, we are going to have our
own page. It's all right, but I can't just sit
there and answer messages three hours a
day."
