# Strikers' demands not yet fully met
## 
### Colleen Krueger Senior staff writer 
To those who argue that last
year's hunger strike achieved
no real results, Cecilia Burcia
ga has this to say: "If it made no
difference, then why are you
still writing about it, why are
you even remembering it?"
At the same time, however,
both of the Burciagas admitted
they could be much happier
with the University's response
to some of the protesters' de
mands.
Like so many of those in
volved in the hunger strike —
which started exactly one year
ago today — the Burciagas said
they are simultaneously disap
pointed and encouraged by the
administration's efforts to follow
through with the agreements it
made with strikers.
The hunger strikers asked the
University for four concessions: the
establishment of a Chicano / Latino
Studies program, a University-wide
grape boycott, the establishment of
a community center in East Palo
Alto and a high-level job offer for
Cecilia Burciaga. After three days of
protest, the hunger strikers and
University officials agreed to form
committees to look into the first
three demands.
A year of committee meetings
and complicated administrative
action has followed, but now that
the dust has cleared the results
fall a bit short of the hunger strik
ers' hopes: a comparative ethnic
studies program has been formal
ly proposed, but University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper rejected the
University-wide ban on grapes.
The East Palo Alto community
center is — optimistically put —
on hold.
Both Burciagas said they feel
the creation of an ethnic studies
program marks a true victory for
their community.
"I think anything is a foot in the
door, for not having any kind of
study program for the last 20 to 25
years," Tony said. "If people aren't
happy, there is room to change. It
can be broadened and bettered."
Cecilia said the new program is
one of a host of positives she tries to
see as coming out of a very turbu
lent time.
"The program is something that
will be good for all ethnic commu
nities, not just for our communi
ty," she said.
The committee which examined
Stanford's policy on grapes recom
mended that both student resi

dences and administrative units
have the choice to boycott. Howev
er, Casper — who throughout his
time at Stanford has consistently
shied away from stating his person
al political beliefs or officially con
necting the University to any par
ticular doctrine — said he felt that
a grape boycott is too political an
issue to institutionalize and that
administrative units should not
have the choice to boycott grapes.
According to Tony Burciaga, the
outcome was inevitable.
"The grape issue is very politi
cal, the decision on President
Casper's part was so obvious," he
said.
"We were able to keep grapes
out of many programs and dorms
until we brought the issue to the
forefront," he continued, "but it
had to come to the forefront, it had
to be pushed. It was just another
needling point."
Cecilia said she is "profoundly
disappointed" with the outcome of
the grape policy — not only with
the administration, but with mem
bers of the committee who she said
"allowed Casper to say the commit
tee did not recommend a boycott."
As for the community center in
East Palo Alto, Cecilia stressed
that Provost Condoleezza Rice had
wanted to be involved in what
Cecilia called "opening doors" in
East Palo Alto.
"Many people operate under the
assumption that East Palo Alto is a
predominantly African-American
community," she said, "but it is
simply that the power structure is
black. If you look at the demo
graphics, it is Samoan, it is Latin
American ... it is many different
groups.
"That's still a very important
project, and one I hope people don't
forget about," she added. "It's hard
for students to do things of a sus
tained nature on a volunteer
basis."
With or without University
involvement, however, Tony said
he is sure that students of his com
munity will continue to serve East
Palo Alto.
