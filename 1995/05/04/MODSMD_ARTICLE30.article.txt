# Noel Coward's Love triangle depicts bittersweet 'Design for Living'
## 
### Sam Park 
I he problem with love triangles is that one
I person gets two much love, and the two
I others have to fight each other for atten
tion. Not so in Noel Coward's bittersweet ro
mantic comedy "Design for Living," opening
tonight at the Eleanor Prosser Studio.
" The three main characters are in a very
complex relationship. It is something that is
almost inconceivable: a perfect love triangle.
All of them love each other," said director
Andy Paul. " They're trying to figure out how
to be happy together."
The complexity of the situation is what
makes this 1931 play so different from the rest
of Coward's work, according to Paul. Coward
is better known for his farces set in high soci
ety, like "Blithe Spirits" and "Private Lives."
"I love Coward. He's extremely witty and
his characters are so alive," Paul said. "He has
a wonderful feel for flamboyant characters
who would be impossibly rude if they didn't
have very hig hearts."
The play follows the changing relation
ships between Otto (Sasha Aickin), Cilda
(Sheila McDonald) and Leo (Adam Seelig),
three artists living and loving together and
apart. Their interaction allows Coward to ex
plore the possibilities and impossibilities of
different kinds of love and what happens to
those who live outside social conventions.
"There's a lot of witty banter going back
and forth between them. They're always play
ing games with each other," Aickin said. "My
character, Otto, is a painter, and he is a little
more reserved than the others. He's young
and dashing."
Auditions were held at the beginning of the
quarter, and rehearsals started almost imme
diately. Cast members have been working

every night for at least two hours for the past
five weeks. Since rehearsals began so quickly,
the actors had to sink right into the role.
"1 had to prepare to get into the bantering
mood and I was practicing the lines all over"
the pace, Aickin said.

The cast members at first rehearsed their
scenes separately, with the trio Otto, Gilda
and Leo joining the others at a later time.
"When we all started working together
(the trio] infected the rest of the cast with the
witty banter," said Amie Rooney, who plays

Helen. "We're getting silly but not so silly that
we forget the magnitude of the play or the im
portance of this for Andy."
Her character is one of many who serve as
foils for the love trio. Rooney said they are
there to create conflict.
"My husband and I are socialites. We're
part of Gilda's new life and we come to re
claim her," Rooney said. "As socialites, we arc
not too appreciative of what we see unfolding
in front of us."
Ift he audience finds th e relat ionsh ipsha rd
to understand, the tensions are equally com
plex for characters within the play, according
to Rooney.
"The dynamics of this relationship are for
eign and hard for those outside the three to
understand," Rooney added. "They're all
struggling to understand them, forming their
own conclusions and judgments."
Paul chose the play as his senior project out
of a long admiration for the British play
wright. Known for his many witty, sophisti
cated comedies of manners, Coward was a fa
vorite of Paul's since senior year of high
school, when he wrote a term paper on Cow
ard's oeuvre.
"I picked 'Design for Living' because it's my
favorite. It isn't done very often. There are a cou
ple of Coward plays that are slam-bang, pure
comedies that are done more often, but this is
deeper and has more substance," Paul said.
