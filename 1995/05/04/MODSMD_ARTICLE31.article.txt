# Focus on: Woodside Bakery and Cafe
## 
### Chris Levinson 
There's nothing like the first time. Or so
they keep telling me. Woodside Bakery and
Cafe lives up to the hype. "This place is hop
pin' quips friend T. (who asks to go by his
full name, forcing me to explain that you can't
mess with a writer's style). Something to keep
in mind if you plan to just show up — the wait
can cost you up to 30 minutes, so it's best to
think ahead.
It's a neighborhood hang out where people
take a break from wood-fired pizzas to table
hop and shoot the breeze with the family
from down the street. The brass of the open
kitchen meets the hushed tones of the tiled
floor in the accompanying bakery, shut down
during dinner hours. If this rain ever ends,
make your way to the patio out back. A per
fect spot.
And this place is family friendly. Just about
every table boasts a toddler in varying stages of
maturity. The little girl in the pinafore occupy

ing the chair closest to us is fascinated with T.
Or maybe she wants our bread, little diskettes
of pizza dough cooked in those miraculous
ovens. I find that the Cafe is yet another estab
lishment on this olive oil kick, replacing the
time honored crock of butter — I've never
found a bowl of oil all that appealing. This
bread with an herb tint sings on its own.
On to what matters . . . real food. We are
seated at a table by the door, which leads to a
night ofbumping. A minus? Not so. Looking
up with each nudge allows for a close-up and
personal viewing of passing dishes. Every
thing here is large. The plates, the forks —
and, thank you very much, the food.
First, a trio of Caesar salads flies by (also
available eggless) in small $2.75 and large
$6.75 sizes. Next I catch a glimpse of the
"bricked" chicken breast with sauteed wild
mushrooms laid to rest on a bed of garlic
mashed potatoes, tasty at $12.75. As I impa
tiendy dig into bread diskette No. 2, I'm hit by
a shot of cold air from the open door. "It's Bill
Walsh," T. informs me. What was he eating?
Here 1 can't help you. He opted for take-out.
Finally — our turn. T. looks pleased with
his calzone that arrives in grand splendor. A
dome packed with goodies including chicken,
ricotta, oven-roasted mushrooms, fontina,
arugula and rosemary not even tipping the
scales at $9.50. T. serves me well, polishing it
off along with a glass of Handley Cellers
Chardonnay at $5.
Sitting in the corner, Joan Baez twirls her
tagliatelli with roasted chicken, $9.25. Yes, a
shameless mention of a celebrity sighting,
"But it's Joan Baez!" defends T. And the tagli
atelli looks divine.
It's tough deciding between the pastas —
linguine with Manila clams and black mussels

in a saffron-fennel broth for $12.25, risotto
mingled with portobello, cremini, domestic
and porcini mushrooms, all bathed in white
wine, herbs and parmesean cheese at $12.75
or maybe the straightforward spaghetti, any
thing but dull with its pairing of parsley,
crushed red pepper, garlic and olive oil at
$7.25.
My final decision deserves noting. Pap
pardalle vegetali — roughly translated as
sheets of pasta, a wide cousin of fettucini,
tossed in a winter vegetable sauce and garnish
— for a clean $8.75.1 too was skeptical. Win
ter vegetables usually tend toward your root
varieties, bitter and unappealing. Not these.
By the meal's close, my plate is lined with a
thin layer of sweet puree worthy of a piece of
that bread posing here as a mop. Nice.

Maybe it is the warm in the warm sour
dough bread pudding with rum sauce that
catches my eye, $4. But T. makes a bee line for
the deep dish apple pie studded with raisins
and cinnamon cream, $4. It disintegrates on
contact so don't try to be demure. This is
food, not a test of manners, or of wills. Enjoy
— and use your fingers.
