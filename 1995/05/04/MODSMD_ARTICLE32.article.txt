dance department's largest con
cert of the year, the 17th annual
W "Spring Migration," plays at Roble
Dance Studio through this weekend and ex
hibits the artistic talents of students and
alumna Stephanie Schaaf in a collection of
eight works.
Though some may perceive modern dance
as inaccessible, bizarre or subversive, that's
only half of the picture. Dance as a physical
and mental form ot expression rejuvenates it
self constantly in the arena of modern dance,
and "Spring Migration" offers students to be
.1 part of such an exploration.
All-student vOork
Though many elements remain consistent
— the focus on student choreography and
performance, .111 emphasis on modern dance,
and a willingness to experiment with the
boundaries of expectations — this was the
first year in a long time that students choreo
graphed every piece.
Its a strong evening of very complete
pieces," said modern dance instructor Diane
Frank, adding that this is the first all-student
"Spring Migration" in her seven years at
Stanford. "There's an enormous range of so
phisticated dances that are .ill fully realized."
In past years, faculty have often con
tributed works performed by students, and
Frank said there's 110 reason they won't con
tinue to in future performances.
However, the dance department still ac
tively aims to promote role models for stu
dents of dance. l ast year the department in
stituted the Mary Edith Clifford Grant which
will commission an alumna to contribute a
work. This year, Stephanie Schaaf, an alumna
of the dance education program, choreo
graphed a piece called "(io Between" for the
concert.
"We wanted (students] to see people

who d graduated and went on to professional
careers in dance with professional compa
nies, 1 ' Frank said.
Frank noted that students should not con
sider a Stanford education and a career in
dance an unlikely combination.
"We want to encourage current students
to see themselves embrace a life of dance, not
in spite of their college education, but to see
that the intelligence and sensitivity they
bring to bear can be carried 011 111 dance,"
Frank added.
"It's like science," Frank said, making the
analogy to what's traditionally considered
the more "techie disciplines. "You start with
.1 hypothesis and have the imagination, wit
and clarity to follow it through."
I his is an astute observation, especially
considering the pressures, both academic
and financial, students weigh when they
commit large amounts of time to the arts.
" I here should be a place for this 011 cam
pus," Frank stressed.
Vouth increment
Hut student energy and plans certainly are
in abundance at the beginning of the year,
when the show begins it's long production
process. Indeed, there were some 13 pro
posed projects at the beginning of the year
although just seven of these 13 now make up
the show, in addition to Schaaf s work.
The cast is smaller this year, and many
faces start looking familiar after a few num
bers. The choreographers are also younger
this time around, a fact that bodes well for fu
ture shows since many younger artists are
gaining valuable experience.
The modern group pieces thrive on sud
den moments that startle the audience, deft
contact group work where dancers interact
with each other, and the occasional exclama
tion.

Another quality
notable in this year's
show is the unusually
strong female presence.
Though dance tradi
tionally has more
women than men par
ticipating, "Spring Mi
gration '95" has only
one male dancer.
"I wish there were
more men who were as
adventurous as the fe
males," Frank said.
But on the positive
side for this dance con
cert, it seems to have re
sulted in a rich exami
nation on women's re
lationships and identi
ties.
"I think it strongly
puts forward the place
of women in the
world," Frank added.
"Women moving in
very unconventional
ways, powering each
other with a great de
gree of ferocity."

Entertainment Values
In addition to the messages they put for
ward consciously and unconsciously, the
dances are entertaining on many levels.
Though there are other dance styles in the
concert, the most featured style is modern
dance. Much of the technique of modern
dance evolved out of traditional forms like
ballet, but modern also involves the bending
of the torso in different directions. The per
formance values for modern dance likewise
seek to bend the boundaries of what is tradi
tional dance.
In "2 Improvisations," sophomore Heidi
Schweiker bounds out solo to the middle of
the stage. "High speed pink," Schweiker an
nounces matter-of-factly, then just as sud
denly spins around and runs off to begin the
next phrase. Dancers weave in and out of the
spotlight, in groups and individually, all
dressed in some permutation of pink. Frank
characterized the unusual piece as a guerrilla
improvisation, a work in progress.
Junior Sarah Margolis' piece, "On the
Edges of Mesa, Traveling," explores ritualized
movements. Set to Indian music, the dancers
frequently begin with the motion of remov
ing a shirt, but never actually removing it.
From there, the dance takes off as the dancers
explore unusual possibilities tor movement,
sometimes individually, often with a partner.

Schaaf's "Go Between" is danced by six
students in unobtrusive costume. The work
flows so coherently that the final movement
— the dancers turn their heads to face the
same direction in unison — comes as a quiet
shock
In addition to the modern pieces, there's a
lyrical dance set to Tracy Chapman's "Mat
ters of the Heart." And the concert closes with
an exuberant, energetic tap number, "Under
the Lamplight," that makes full use of stair
case and lamppost props choreographed by
freshman Adrienne Ruth.
Collaborative creativity
Frank and the dancers are quick to point
out the collaborative effort that dance re
quires. Although each dancer's movement is
unique, each group often met with all the
other groups to perform their pieces and ex
change opinions.
Margolis said that watching her fellow
performers doesn't provide her with new
ideas, but it does help her evaluate her own.
"I look at them and I can ask myself'[Does]
what I'm doing unfold like that?' "
This individual yet collaborative explo
ration is vital to an art form that is enriched
by diversity in rhythm and style. Both Mar
golis and Schweiker agreed that an aspect ot
choreography is to adapt to this diversity. "I
have to try to imagine how the movement in

my mind would look on another dancer,"
Schweiker remarked.
Even as a choreographer, Margolis insists
that she does not tell her dancers how to
move. "I give them assignments," she re
marked. "I have this phrase, and 1 tell them to
do what they want with it. The material
comes out of me."
In this way, every dancer participates in
the creation of a dance. "They're in there re
searching the dance, too," Frank commented,
stressing the importance of allowing dancers
to become active participants in the concep
tion of a dance. "A lot of times, especially
with younger dancers, what they see is how
its made." By being allowed this freedom,
each dancer gets to explore the movement in
a dance.
"It's reallyabout fluency," I rank added. "It
focuses your attention until you start speak
ing your own language."
C letting to know all of the dancers' style
well is one ol the challenges of choreography,
Schweiker remarked. But she emphasized the
value collaborative choreography. "I can dis
cover things in other people's body that I
never can in mine."
Frank agreed."... [There's an] innate re
spect for difference. You don't really dance
well with other people until you know them,
and as you work on that, you respect them
even more."
Slarl vOilh a movement
For both Margolis and Schweiker, the idea
for a dance stems from movement.

"For me, I will start with movement and
then it will develop. I'll push the movement
and see where it goes," Schweiker said.
Margolis agreed. For example, the dance
Margolis choreographed for "Spring Migra
tion," "On the Edge of the Mesa, Traveling"
began with the concept of clothing, Margolis
explained. She started thinking about the act
of putting on and removing clothing — the

removal of a tie or a
shirt, zipping up the
back of a gown, putting
on buttons. She then ex
tended those actions
outward into a move
ment. It later expanded
even further as she con
tinued to consider what
clothing really is. "What
does it feel like? What is
this movement becom
ing? For me, it has to do
with how I approach the
movement as a per
former," Margolis said.
Both she and
Frank, however, empha
sized that this is not the
meaning of the dance.
"These are the mecha
nisms that release a
dance," Frank ex
plained. "It's a starting
place."
Compared to the
movement, the music
actually plays a sec
ondary role.
"I do like the
music and the dance to
complement each

other," Schweiker said. But for Schweiker
also, the music is not as important as the
movement of a dance, and she will often not
choose the music until after she's done with
the creation of the dance itself. "At times,
music can limit you," she added.
Both Margolis and Schweiker also agree
that choreography of a dance is filled with
unanticipated occurrences. "It's all a happy
accident," Margolis commented. "I think the
most unexpected thing would be if every
thing turned out as we had expected."
"Sometimes in choreography, the best
things are surprises," Schweiker remarked,
agreeing that many things don't happen as
planned. Margolis mentions having to sub
stitute for one of the other performers one
evening in a role she was not very familiar
with.
"I was taking the place of one of my
dancers, and Kaney (one of the dancers)
looked back, and if she'd leaped where she
would have normally, she would have
crashed right into me. But she saw immedi
ately what was going on and leapt forward,
and it was beautiful," Margolis said. "If I'd
choreographed that, I would have been a ge
nius."
Room for accidents
The test of a true choreographer, then, is
to allow room for such accidents.
"Good choreography is the investigation
of an idea, of movement," Frank emphasized.
"It leads you, as ou take in new informa
tion."
For each of the choreographers, the dance
is quite clearly an exploration in movement.
"This is absolutely larger than technique,"
Frank commented. "In the end, there's a
dance intelligence."

" I like the reality of the power of the move
ment," she added. "I like the freedom, the
risk, the trust, and the conspiracy involved. I
like that the imagery is not safe."
In addition to "Spring Migration's" sense
of adventure, each dance also reflects the ex
traordinary dedication of these women.
They've spent many hours in rehearsal to
choreograph as well to perform in several of
the dances.
"It takes a toll on your body," Schweiker
admitted. She emphasized also the amount
of time spent outside of rehearsal preparing
tor the show. "Dance work happens not only
in the studio"
In her sophomore year, this is Schweiker's
first large solo choreographic project. She in
sists, however, that any dancer is capable of it.
"Choreography is something that can be
done from an early age," she remarked.
These as well as the other Stanford per
formers have put together a show that is truly
worth seeing.
" I hese are women who are moving in
very traditional, unconventional ways,"
Frank remarked.
"Unconventional" is definitely the word.
Modern dance is not ballet like the more tra
ditional dances. It's a very rich and diverse art
form, finely represented at "Spring Migra
tion."

comes out of me."
In this way, every dancer participates in
the creation of a dance. "They're in there re
searching the dance, too," Frank commented,
stressing the importance of allowing dancers
to become active participants in the concep
tion of a dance. "A lot of times, especially
with younger dancers, what they see is how
its made." By being allowed this freedom,
each dancer gets to explore the movement in
a dance.
"It's reallyabout fluency," I rank added. "It
focuses your attention until you start speak
ing your own language."
C letting to know all of the dancers' style
well is one ol the challenges of choreography,
Schweiker remarked. But she emphasized the
value collaborative choreography. "I can dis
cover things in other people's body that I
never can in mine."
Frank agreed."... [There's an] innate re
spect for difference. You don't really dance
well with other people until you know them,
and as you work on that, you respect them
even more."
Slarl vOilh a movement
For both Margolis and Schweiker, the idea
for a dance stems from movement.

"For me, I will start with movement and
then it will develop. I'll push the movement
and see where it goes," Schweiker said.
Margolis agreed. For example, the dance
Margolis choreographed for "Spring Migra
tion," "On the Edge of the Mesa, Traveling"
began with the concept of clothing, Margolis
explained. She started thinking about the act
of putting on and removing clothing — the

removal of a tie or a
shirt, zipping up the
back of a gown, putting
on buttons. She then ex
tended those actions
outward into a move
ment. It later expanded
even further as she con
tinued to consider what
clothing really is. "What
does it feel like? What is
this movement becom
ing? For me, it has to do
with how I approach the
movement as a per
former," Margolis said.
Both she and
Frank, however, empha
sized that this is not the
meaning of the dance.
"These are the mecha
nisms that release a
dance," Frank ex
plained. "It's a starting
place."
Compared to the
movement, the music
actually plays a sec
ondary role.
"I do like the
music and the dance to
complement each

other," Schweiker said. But for Schweiker
also, the music is not as important as the
movement of a dance, and she will often not
choose the music until after she's done with
the creation of the dance itself. "At times,
music can limit you," she added.
Both Margolis and Schweiker also agree
that choreography of a dance is filled with
unanticipated occurrences. "It's all a happy
accident," Margolis commented. "I think the
most unexpected thing would be if every
thing turned out as we had expected."
"Sometimes in choreography, the best
things are surprises," Schweiker remarked,
agreeing that many things don't happen as
planned. Margolis mentions having to sub
stitute for one of the other performers one
evening in a role she was not very familiar
with.
"I was taking the place of one of my
dancers, and Kaney (one of the dancers)
looked back, and if she'd leaped where she
would have normally, she would have
crashed right into me. But she saw immedi
ately what was going on and leapt forward,
and it was beautiful," Margolis said. "If I'd
choreographed that, I would have been a ge
nius."
Room for accidents
The test of a true choreographer, then, is
to allow room for such accidents.
"Good choreography is the investigation
of an idea, of movement," Frank emphasized.
"It leads you, as ou take in new informa
tion."
For each of the choreographers, the dance
is quite clearly an exploration in movement.
"This is absolutely larger than technique,"
Frank commented. "In the end, there's a
dance intelligence."

" I like the reality of the power of the move
ment," she added. "I like the freedom, the
risk, the trust, and the conspiracy involved. I
like that the imagery is not safe."
In addition to "Spring Migration's" sense
of adventure, each dance also reflects the ex
traordinary dedication of these women.
They've spent many hours in rehearsal to
choreograph as well to perform in several of
the dances.
"It takes a toll on your body," Schweiker
admitted. She emphasized also the amount
of time spent outside of rehearsal preparing
tor the show. "Dance work happens not only
in the studio"
In her sophomore year, this is Schweiker's
first large solo choreographic project. She in
sists, however, that any dancer is capable of it.
"Choreography is something that can be
done from an early age," she remarked.
These as well as the other Stanford per
formers have put together a show that is truly
worth seeing.
" I hese are women who are moving in
very traditional, unconventional ways,"
Frank remarked.
"Unconventional" is definitely the word.
Modern dance is not ballet like the more tra
ditional dances. It's a very rich and diverse art
form, finely represented at "Spring Migra
tion."

dance department's largest con
cert of the year, the 17th annual
W "Spring Migration," plays at Roble
Dance Studio through this weekend and ex
hibits the artistic talents of students and
alumna Stephanie Schaaf in a collection of
eight works.
Though some may perceive modern dance
as inaccessible, bizarre or subversive, that's
only half of the picture. Dance as a physical
and mental form ot expression rejuvenates it
self constantly in the arena of modern dance,
and "Spring Migration" offers students to be
.1 part of such an exploration.
All-student vOork
Though many elements remain consistent
— the focus on student choreography and
performance, .111 emphasis on modern dance,
and a willingness to experiment with the
boundaries of expectations — this was the
first year in a long time that students choreo
graphed every piece.
Its a strong evening of very complete
pieces," said modern dance instructor Diane
Frank, adding that this is the first all-student
"Spring Migration" in her seven years at
Stanford. "There's an enormous range of so
phisticated dances that are .ill fully realized."
In past years, faculty have often con
tributed works performed by students, and
Frank said there's 110 reason they won't con
tinue to in future performances.
However, the dance department still ac
tively aims to promote role models for stu
dents of dance. l ast year the department in
stituted the Mary Edith Clifford Grant which
will commission an alumna to contribute a
work. This year, Stephanie Schaaf, an alumna
of the dance education program, choreo
graphed a piece called "(io Between" for the
concert.
"We wanted (students] to see people

who d graduated and went on to professional
careers in dance with professional compa
nies, 1 ' Frank said.
Frank noted that students should not con
sider a Stanford education and a career in
dance an unlikely combination.
"We want to encourage current students
to see themselves embrace a life of dance, not
in spite of their college education, but to see
that the intelligence and sensitivity they
bring to bear can be carried 011 111 dance,"
Frank added.
"It's like science," Frank said, making the
analogy to what's traditionally considered
the more "techie disciplines. "You start with
.1 hypothesis and have the imagination, wit
and clarity to follow it through."
I his is an astute observation, especially
considering the pressures, both academic
and financial, students weigh when they
commit large amounts of time to the arts.
" I here should be a place for this 011 cam
pus," Frank stressed.
Vouth increment
Hut student energy and plans certainly are
in abundance at the beginning of the year,
when the show begins it's long production
process. Indeed, there were some 13 pro
posed projects at the beginning of the year
although just seven of these 13 now make up
the show, in addition to Schaaf s work.
The cast is smaller this year, and many
faces start looking familiar after a few num
bers. The choreographers are also younger
this time around, a fact that bodes well for fu
ture shows since many younger artists are
gaining valuable experience.
The modern group pieces thrive on sud
den moments that startle the audience, deft
contact group work where dancers interact
with each other, and the occasional exclama
tion.

Another quality
notable in this year's
show is the unusually
strong female presence.
Though dance tradi
tionally has more
women than men par
ticipating, "Spring Mi
gration '95" has only
one male dancer.
"I wish there were
more men who were as
adventurous as the fe
males," Frank said.
But on the positive
side for this dance con
cert, it seems to have re
sulted in a rich exami
nation on women's re
lationships and identi
ties.
"I think it strongly
puts forward the place
of women in the
world," Frank added.
"Women moving in
very unconventional
ways, powering each
other with a great de
gree of ferocity."

Entertainment Values
In addition to the messages they put for
ward consciously and unconsciously, the
dances are entertaining on many levels.
Though there are other dance styles in the
concert, the most featured style is modern
dance. Much of the technique of modern
dance evolved out of traditional forms like
ballet, but modern also involves the bending
of the torso in different directions. The per
formance values for modern dance likewise
seek to bend the boundaries of what is tradi
tional dance.
In "2 Improvisations," sophomore Heidi
Schweiker bounds out solo to the middle of
the stage. "High speed pink," Schweiker an
nounces matter-of-factly, then just as sud
denly spins around and runs off to begin the
next phrase. Dancers weave in and out of the
spotlight, in groups and individually, all
dressed in some permutation of pink. Frank
characterized the unusual piece as a guerrilla
improvisation, a work in progress.
Junior Sarah Margolis' piece, "On the
Edges of Mesa, Traveling," explores ritualized
movements. Set to Indian music, the dancers
frequently begin with the motion of remov
ing a shirt, but never actually removing it.
From there, the dance takes off as the dancers
explore unusual possibilities tor movement,
sometimes individually, often with a partner.

Schaaf's "Go Between" is danced by six
students in unobtrusive costume. The work
flows so coherently that the final movement
— the dancers turn their heads to face the
same direction in unison — comes as a quiet
shock
In addition to the modern pieces, there's a
lyrical dance set to Tracy Chapman's "Mat
ters of the Heart." And the concert closes with
an exuberant, energetic tap number, "Under
the Lamplight," that makes full use of stair
case and lamppost props choreographed by
freshman Adrienne Ruth.
Collaborative creativity
Frank and the dancers are quick to point
out the collaborative effort that dance re
quires. Although each dancer's movement is
unique, each group often met with all the
other groups to perform their pieces and ex
change opinions.
Margolis said that watching her fellow
performers doesn't provide her with new
ideas, but it does help her evaluate her own.
"I look at them and I can ask myself'[Does]
what I'm doing unfold like that?' "
This individual yet collaborative explo
ration is vital to an art form that is enriched
by diversity in rhythm and style. Both Mar
golis and Schweiker agreed that an aspect ot
choreography is to adapt to this diversity. "I
have to try to imagine how the movement in

my mind would look on another dancer,"
Schweiker remarked.
Even as a choreographer, Margolis insists
that she does not tell her dancers how to
move. "I give them assignments," she re
marked. "I have this phrase, and 1 tell them to
do what they want with it. The material
comes out of me."
In this way, every dancer participates in
the creation of a dance. "They're in there re
searching the dance, too," Frank commented,
stressing the importance of allowing dancers
to become active participants in the concep
tion of a dance. "A lot of times, especially
with younger dancers, what they see is how
its made." By being allowed this freedom,
each dancer gets to explore the movement in
a dance.
"It's reallyabout fluency," I rank added. "It
focuses your attention until you start speak
ing your own language."
C letting to know all of the dancers' style
well is one ol the challenges of choreography,
Schweiker remarked. But she emphasized the
value collaborative choreography. "I can dis
cover things in other people's body that I
never can in mine."

unanticipated occurrences. "It's all a happy
accident," Margolis commented. "I think the
most unexpected thing would be if every
thing turned out as we had expected."
"Sometimes in choreography, the best
things are surprises," Schweiker remarked,
agreeing that many things don't happen as

" I like the reality of the power of the move
ment," she added. "I like the freedom, the
risk, the trust, and the conspiracy involved. I
like that the imagery is not safe."
In addition to "Spring Migration's" sense
of adventure, each dance also reflects the ex
traordinary dedication of these women.
They've spent many hours in rehearsal to
