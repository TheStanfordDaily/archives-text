## Aïda Croal MAKE WAY FOR APACHE INDIAN 
### 
Among the few positive legacies of British
colonialism are the rich intercultural expres
sions of subordinated peoples forced into
proximity with one another. If such is the
case, then Apache Indian is the quintessential
inheritor of this legacy.
Who ever heard of a music style that fuses
Jamaican club and reggae with Indian
Bhangra and American rap? Nobody. But
that was before Apache Indian pushed his
way into Britain's music scene and collective
psyche with his debut, "No Reservations."
Recorded in Birmingham, England and
Kingston, Jamaica, "No Reservations' fea
tured such artists as Sly Dunbar, Bobby Dig
ital and Maxi Priest. Not only did Apache
reach across borders and bodies of water to
cultivate his original form, but, where con
tent was concerned, he boldly ventured into
volatile subject areas.

Tackling topics ranging from the arranged
marriage and caste systems within Indian
culture to AIDS and safer sex issues for black
British youth. Apache Indian risked his repu
tation to discuss taboo subjects openly.
Two years later, with a new release titled
"Make Way for the Indian," Apache Indian
has no cause for regrets. The messages in his
music remain pertinent and his music ever
funky.
On the album's title track, Apache trades
the mike with U.S. rapper Tim Dog in an un
forgettable ragga jam. Here, old school hip
hop beats are seamlessly united with synthe
sized ragga music — a refreshing change
from the U.S. rap trend that jaggedly inserts a
brief ragga moments into conventional hip
hop tunes.
Indeed Apache's style reflects a deep respect
and understanding of both forms. "If you're
African or American /or Englishman / you

love Indian / cause if you're
around the way/check out
the rhymes we say / peace to
hip hop and reggae!"
Here the union between
ragga and rap is as perfect as
its ever going to get.
Vocally versatile, Apache
also has no problem switch
ing gears. While uAr
magideon Time" displays a
ballad-making talent on par
with any of his reggae peers,
"Boba," is a beautiful
Bhangra tune, sporting flutes
and a selection of Indian per
cussive instruments. The
songs aren't simply compe
tent expressions of their re
spective musical forms, they
push these forms to new
heights.
This album draws on rich
cultural heritages to inno
vate, create and raise musical
standards. Undoubtedly, we
must make way for Apache
Indian.
