# JOE HENDERSON
## Double Rainbow 
### 
There are numerous influential musicians
who deserve respect and attention but who
remain virtually unrecognized by the general
listening public, lazz artists fall into this cat
egory— more now than ever — particularly
since jazz does not appear to be aligned with
any socio-political movement or trend.
Whereas earlier jazz artists had the Lost
Generation, the Depression, the Beat Gener
ation, theGivi! Rights movement, right wing
groups and so on, to either push them into
the limelight or to denounce them as the
originators of devil's music, jazz musicians
today come to prominence through hard and
fast promos and PR campaigns sponsored by
record labels. In this manner, Kenny G and
the like become famous and inappropriately
categorized as jazz musicians.
Joe Henderson, on the other hand, is one
of those deserving artists who is often over
looked. Although Wynton Marsalis, who was
featured on Henderson's "Lush Life" album,
will never cease to garner attention, Hender
son continues to go unrecognized by many.
Nevertheless his tenor saxophone — a little
bit less breathy and more straightforward
than a Lester Young's — has a distinct sweet
tone that stands out.
In his newest release, "Double Rainbow,"
Henderson delivers a third tribute to leg
endary jazz composers (the first was Billy
Strayhorn, the second Miles Davis). Divided
into "Suite I" and "Suite II," "Double Rain
bow" covers 12 songs by Antonio Garlos
Joabim. Most closely associated with Stan
Getz or the movie "Black Orpheus," Joabim's
works are transformed here by Henderson

into jazzy arrangements tinged with a Brazil
ian spice.
"Suite II" stands out as the stronger half of
the album with Herbie Hancock almost
stealing the show and Christine Mcßride and
Jack Dejohnette carrying the rhythm. In this
section, Henderson's How sounds similar to
his earlier "Lush Life." In the first half, how
ever, this style is somewhat dwarfed. The
heavy Brazilian flavor of the selected compo
sitions does not mix smoothly with Hender
son's tenor.
"Ligia," the fourth track, drags on uncom
fortably, typifying this incompatibility. Nev
ertheless, "Suite I" should not be dismissed
or passed over. The second song offers an al
ternative interpretation of "Dreamer," which
Stan Getz fans may be quick to judge, but
even quicker to discover that the Henderson
version is excellent.
