## The
						Basketball Diaries 
### 
There is a sense of danger lurking beneath
every song in the soundtrack for"The Bas
ketball Diaries" — whether it's the relentless
percussion underscoring P.J. Harvey's
"Down by the Water," or the maniacal guitar
arrangements in "People Who Died," by the
Jim Carroll Band.
The feeling evoked is appropriate, consid
ering what kind of story the songs serve as
supplement for. Based on the novel by the
same title — a cult classic by Jim Carroll —
the film chronicles the highs and lows of the
poet's bouts with drug abuse and street vio
lence. The soundtrack effectively elicits that

world of alienated youth, where death and
danger turn dreams into hallucinations. Its
the musical equivalent of an unflushed toilet
— not pretty and not something you want to
face in the morning.
Though the album is star-studded by the
likes of Harvey and Soundgarden ("Blind
Dogs"), it's Carroll, poet and rebel, who gets
the mike most often in the end.
His voice-over appears on three tracks,
reading short excerpts from his book over
background music by Graeme Revell, the
film's composer.
Carroll's voice, hinting at years of hard
liquor and heavy drugs abuse, casts an eerie
authenticity over the whole album. Clearly,
for all the noise made by bands like The Cult
and Flea, Carroll is the star. The others arc
just opening for him.
Aside from the voice-overs, Carroll sings
"Catholic Boy" with Pearl Jam and leads
"People Who Died," from 1980. It is this very
song that provides the emotional center of
the album.
First, we get Carroll reading from "Di
aries": "Bobby died of leukemia. He got it two
days ago, but he had such a strong body — he
was always the best at sports — that he kept
fighting it off."
Then there's the song, fast and rebellious:

"Bobby got leukemia / Fourteen years
old / He weighed 65 / When he died / These
are people who died, died. ... All my
friends / They died."
It's an old song, but it still manages to star
tle, and in the end it sums up all the feelings
of death and despair often found in the
album.
Hopelessness, despair. ... It could all
make for a pretty depressing album, but "Di
aries" is anything but. Highly charged and
energetic, the soundtrack manages to pro
vide the perfect background for Carroll's
tale. It's the kind of soundtrack that you
could easily lock yourself in a room with and
listen to happily ever after.
