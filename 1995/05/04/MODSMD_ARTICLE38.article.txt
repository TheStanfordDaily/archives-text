# JIMI HENDRIX
## Band of Gypsys 
### 
The first Jimi Hendrix release since last
year's "Blues," "Band of Gypsys" represents
the long-awaited arrival of this Hendrix clas
sic on disc. Recorded on New Year's Eve in
1969, this recording is a fascinating and dy
namic look at the collaboration of the Hen
drix, Buddy Miles and Billy Cox trio.
What makes this live recording even more
special is its historical importance. The last
official recording by the legendary guitarist,
this album shortly preceded the dissolution
of the Band of Gypsys and Hendrix's untime
ly death.
"Band of Gypsys" is not just another live
Jimi album. Rather, it represents a sound he
explored outside of the Jimi Hendrix Experi
ence band. Drummer Buddy Miles and
bassist Billy Cox provide a much tighter
foundation for Hendrix's rolling guitar notes
and famous musicianship.
The album's sound also finds itself im
mersed in a new funk philosophy. While the
attitude of psychedelics still shines through
in the length and free motion of much of the
music (the track "Machine Gun" is a stagger
ing 12'/2 minutes long), this album clearly
serves as a preamble to '70s funk. On tracks
like "Changes" (written by Miles), guitars
sound a bit twangier, the base line a bit hip
per and the drums a little firmer than on
other Hendrix recordings.
Another stylistic adventure is "We Gotta
Live Together," a track filled with soul on par

with Sly & the Family Stone. A faintly audible
audience echoes in the background as Hen
drix stirs the song from its structured begin
ning to a swirling eddy of fanatical guitar, re
turning once again to his free-form roots.
Ihe finest track is the opener, "Who
Knows." A prime example of Hendrix's song
writing ability and guitar mastery, it also fea
tures haunting vocal work by Miles, who
backs up Hendrix in a distinct but unobtru
sive style. I he most moving moment of this
piece comes when Hendrix coaxes other
worldly sounds from his guitar and Miles
cries out in tandem. The two create a stun
ning dialogue of sound that can be marked as
one of the definitive moments of creativity in
the history of R&B. Miles voice itself turns
into a guitar, soloing unabashedly like the
scat of L-lla Fitzgerald or l.ouis Armstrong.
A unique union of musicians and a short
lived testament to Black Power, the Band of
Gypsies left only this single recording to re
mind us of their unique musical vision — yet
one so familiar with Hendrix at the helm.
