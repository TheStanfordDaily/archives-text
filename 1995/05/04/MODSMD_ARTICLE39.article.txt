# ISRAEL VIBRATION
## On the Rock 
### 
Though physically-disabled and once
poverty-stricken, Israel Vibration has proven
with its latest album, "On the Rock," that the
group is spiritually flourishing.
Albert "Apple" Craig, Cecil "Skelly"
Spence and Lascelle "Wiss" Bulgin met at
Kingston's Mona Rehabilitation Center in )a
maica 20 years ago. They were all inflicted
with polio.
Through Rastafarian beliefs and music,
the three men dealt with their disabilities to
produce nine expressive reggae albums.
Like its predecessors, "On the Rock" finds
its greatness through paradox. Their instru
mental back-up band, Roots Radics, uses no
synthesized music, and the trio sings with
lively, even jovial voices. Vet, despite their ap
parent simplicity, Israel Vibration sings
about real issues and each song sends a pow
erful message of hope to its listeners.
For Israel Vibration, a song isn't worth
singing if it doesn't have a message. To quote
the album's third track, "Rebel for Real,"
"there's got to be a message in the music / so
the knowledge of the children will increase."
Songs like "Ambush," an anti-racism tune,
make it clear that Israel Vibration receives
much of its inspiration from Rasta great, Bob
Marley. Marley's songs "Buffalo Soldier" and
"Ambush in the Night" are both alluded to
here. "I'm just a buffalo soldier, survival is my
game.. . / You ambush in the night, giving 1 a
fight."
In fact, they call themselves, "torchbearers
of Bob Marley's musical and spiritual legacy."
"On the Rock" also includes lighthearted
love songs. A take-off of the Beatles' classic,
"Love is All You Need," features Skelly on lead
vocals sounding like a young boy with a
crush.
In the title track — the album's most pow
erful song — Israel Vibration sings of how
black Jamaicans are destined to a life "on the

rock." They condemn the tact that many Ja
maicans are poverty-stricken, incarcerated,
or in some cases both. "Who no pan the rock
lock up in a penitentiary / On the rock dem
cell never empty."
Reggae artists often say the beat of their
music is the heartbeat. "On the Rock" proves
no different as it features pleas for unity,
equality and love, overcoming obstacles to
achieve greatness.
