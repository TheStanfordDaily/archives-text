# 'Tradition' of the procession is only five years old

An integral part of the recent debate over
the University's decision to eliminate the
Commencement procession is the assertion
that a long-standing and beloved piece of
Stanford tradition is being destroyed.
There's just one problem with that argu
ment: The procession's outrageousness is
anything but a long-standing tradition.
"I was struck by this idea that there'd
been eons and eons of tradition," said

Jonathan Reider, associate director of un
dergraduate admissions and a Stanford his
tory buff. "I was amused about this contro
versy."
Commencement was first held in the
Stanford Stadium in 1985 — the first year
that there was a single, unified entrance
procession. "If it's fun, it's fun," Reider
said. "But this is not something the Class of
1926 did."
Lois Wagner, director of Stanford
Events, was involved in the decision — now
rescinded — to change the procession. She

said the 1990 procession was the first in the
so-called "tradition" of irreverence. That
year, she said, "there were [a small number]
of students who ran out into onto the field."
"There's always been frivolity within the
procession," she said. Before 1990, "they're
having a great time, but they're marching
in." In 1990, however, students broke out of
marching lines and onto the field, where
they spun around, played frisbee and were
"just there," she said.
Wagner said few previous processions
were as rowdy as last year's. "Our impres

sion of 1994 was that it was unlike any other
year," she said. "There were almost no se
niors who actually processed around the
field."
An interesting glimpse into the history of
the procession is provided by graduation
videotapes kept by the Stanford Events of
fice.
A screening of graduation tapes from
1989 through 1994 shows a tradition in de
velopment. The following is a year-by-year
