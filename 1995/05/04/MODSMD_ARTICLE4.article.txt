# 'Tradition' of the procession is only five years old
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
An integral part of the recent debate over
the University's decision to eliminate the
Commencement procession is the assertion
that a long-standing and beloved piece of
Stanford tradition is being destroyed.
There's just one problem with that argu
ment: The procession's outrageousness is
anything but a long-standing tradition.
"I was struck by this idea that there'd
been eons and eons of tradition," said

Jonathan Reider, associate director of un
dergraduate admissions and a Stanford his
tory buff. "I was amused about this contro
versy."
Commencement was first held in the
Stanford Stadium in 1985 — the first year
that there was a single, unified entrance
procession. "If it's fun, it's fun," Reider
said. "But this is not something the Class of
1926 did."
Lois Wagner, director of Stanford
Events, was involved in the decision — now
rescinded — to change the procession. She

said the 1990 procession was the first in the
so-called "tradition" of irreverence. That
year, she said, "there were [a small number]
of students who ran out into onto the field."
"There's always been frivolity within the
procession," she said. Before 1990, "they're
having a great time, but they're marching
in." In 1990, however, students broke out of
marching lines and onto the field, where
they spun around, played frisbee and were
"just there," she said.
Wagner said few previous processions
were as rowdy as last year's. "Our impres

sion of 1994 was that it was unlike any other
year," she said. "There were almost no se
niors who actually processed around the
field."
An interesting glimpse into the history of
the procession is provided by graduation
videotapes kept by the Stanford Events of
fice.
A screening of graduation tapes from
1989 through 1994 shows a tradition in de
velopment. The following is a year-by-year
account of the state of the
entrance:
• 1989: Though certainly far
from staid, the processional actu
ally proceeds. Students are wear
ing various types of novelty head
gear, holding aloft signs and car
rying balloons. The graduating
class stays together as a group
and follows the track around the
field.
• 1990: The first group of stu
dents break ranks. Ten or 20 stu
dents leave the marching group
and head onto the football field.

True to Wagner's description,
they are spinning, tossing a fris
bee and just hanging out.
• 1991: A serious depletion of
the marching ranks is noticeable
for the first time. Some students
leave the marching group, run
onto the field and quickly return
to the crowd. lied latex balloons
are prevalent and soap bubbles
are spotted. While one student
rollerblades along with the pro
cessional, many head onto the
grassy field. Cartwheels, baseball,
frisbee, a man being pulled on a
cart and an Interstate 91 highway
sign from Vermont are spotted.
• 1992: Four people wear a cow
costume; others play catch with a
stuffed panda, play baseball, fly

kites and wear assorted costumes.
More bubbles and bicycles show
up, as do star-shaped mylar bal
loons. A Slip 'N Slide appears for
the first time. Nonetheless, many
still spend at least some time in
the processional.
• 1993: Another Slip 'N Slide
and more bubbles are seen. A
bicycle-built-for-two appears, as
do dogpiles and kicklines. People
wear robes covered with Twister
mats and light bulbs and fence
with plungers. Hats are decorated
with airplanes, flamingoes and
various twirly things. Still, many
students, at some point, do march
on around the track.
• 1994: As amused graduate
students march, undergraduates

eschew the walking part of the
processional. Rather than circling
the field and entering the ceremo
ny area from behind, students
run across the field and stage to
reach their seats. Rollerbladers
are more prevalent as are those
with truly outrageous headgear.
Many play frisbee, many
dance, many engage in dogpiling.
Someone unicycles in. There are
lots of balloons and signs, includ
ing one reading "Hilary, will you
marry me?" Someone wears the
Brazilian flag. A group of men in
Speedo swimsuits emulate profes
sional wrestlers. A group of
women in gowns sit in an inflat
able pool and bathe in bottled
water.
