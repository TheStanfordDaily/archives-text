## The 						Bends 
### 
After watching Radiohead lead singer and
lyricist Thorn Yorke churn raw power during
a solo acoustic performance of "Killer Cars"
(shortly after the "Pablo Honey" tour), one
simply cannot be blamed for eagerly antici
pating the British fivesomes' next release.
With their hit single "Creep," a loser's an
them for the '90s, Radiohead paradoxically
rocketed wallowing in self-hatred from the
realm of the pathetic to that of the totally hip.
And it's no wonder with a song that so mas
terfully ridicules both the narrator and his
pitiful state of mind. Just when the lyrics "I'm
a creep /1 am a weirdo" start to grate in
comes a burst of feedback and guitar noise
that refuses to let the track slip into a bub
bling vat ofVelveeta.
Radiohead's sophomore release, "The
Bends," however, sorely lacks this yeah-I
know-so-suck-it attitude. Absent the black
humor that rescued the debut album's self
deprecating lyrics from their sea of pity,
songs off " The Bends" never quite propel
themselves beyond their trite subject matter.
Everyone who has ever gotten tooled by a
significant other wishes they were bullet
proof. In "bullet proof... i wish i was," Yorke
laments his lack of such shielding — and
that's it. "My Iron Lung" takes a baby step
forward by hinting that romantic difficulty is
just a facet of the postmodern condition (i.e.
"We scratch our eternal itch / Our 20th-cen
tury bitch / And we are grateful for our iron
lung) but the metaphor remains the only
fresh lyrical facet.
Musically, the band has matured (read,
tamed their wilder instincts). Not that un
leashing ravaging guitar in a feedback frenzy
is the only ticket to powerful songs, but the
more subtle guitars allow Yorke's uncharac
teristically limited and sadly predictable
melodies to dominate what, musically, could
have been stronger songs.

Only two songs really escape this distress
ing travesty: "Planet Telex" and "Just (You
Do It To Yourself)." Unfortunately, "Just"
falls victim to derivative chord progressions
stolen from — of all places — Love and
Rockets' "No New Tale to Tell."
Perhaps even less forgivable, Radiohead
chose to blatantly imitate other bands' trade
marked styles (i.e. "Nice Dream" and "bullet
proof ... i wish i was," The Sundays; "My
Iron l.ung," The Beetles; "Bones," R.E.M.).
It's as if they are attempting to shed their own
distinct sound.
All this taken under consideration, it
would have been better to await that yearly
Pap Smear.
