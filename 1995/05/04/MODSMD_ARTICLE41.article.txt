# LEFTOVER SALMON
## Bridges to Bert 
### 
Fritos? Cheetos? How 'bout potato chips?
These and more arc found in a Variety Pack
by Frito Lay. If "Bridges to Bert" were a Vari
ety Pack by Leftover Salmon, their selection
would be slightly larger than just the cheesy
sauce in their "I'asta on the Mountain."
The lyrics of "Nothing But Time" recount
an undying love and passion; "Rodeo Geek"
tells the true story of a cross-dressing bucka
roo; and in "Zombie Jamboree," a little danc
ing "back to back / belly to belly" goes on.
A handful of instruments join together to
bounce the lyrics. The scatting electric guitar
replaces an old jazz singer while the acoustic
guitar strums a slower melody. Pumping
strong syncopated beats, the accordion spells
the banjo which spins notes across the
strings. The fiddle pulls the notes up and
down the scale while fingers and strings
dance on the mandolin in "Just before the
Evening."
On "Bridges of Time." Leftover Salmon
uses the keyboard to follow the ancestral line
of music. When the song switches from a
random chord progression by a nondescript
instrument to a medieval fugue on the
"organ" to a Renaissance sonata and then
New Age piece on the "piano," all taste of
Leftover Salmon's prominent Cajun spice is
left behind.
Reggae, Bluegrass and Calypso beats also
fill out the album to provide a Variety Pack of
sounds to which the Yiddish sound of "Dark
Eyes" offers a taste of another place. It's the
Irish tunes of "Whiskey Before Breakfast"
that gives a flavor of another beverage.
Leftover Salmon is not Dannon as the
group makes no mention of fruit and berries,
and it is a far call from Nature Valley as the
band can't even compare to peanut butter or
cinnamon granola bars. But it does come
close to Frito Lay: Leftover Salmon would be
good with a bag of chips.
