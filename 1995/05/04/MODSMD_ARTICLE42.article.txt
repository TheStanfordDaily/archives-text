## Yuen Ping Low 'AMATEUR'S' INTRIGUE OOZES CASUAL BRUTALITY 
### 
At first glance, the signs that surround
writer-director Hal Hartley's fourth full
length feature appear ominous. (Collective
ly, a respectable budget made possible by
multi-national co-financing (1-rance, the
United States and Britain), the above-the
title presence of a major French star (Is
abelle Huppert), and a bright-lights, big-

city milieu (Manhattan) all suggest the
abandonment of I lartley's specialty — dc
constructing the small-town, mid-Ameri
can condition.
Nevertheless, unifying threads ol char
acter, form and style continue to impose
their reassuring presence upon the singu
larly 1 lal I larllev vision — one of parental
oppression, creative strangulation, capital
ist exploitation, and ultimately, existential
angst that confound the (Ireat American
Way.
In Hartley's second film 'Trust," the
Martin Donovan character Matthew
considers his electronic assembly line job
to be economic prostitution. In "Amateur,
this motif is resurrected by two women:
porn actress Sofia (I.lina Lowensohn), and
Isabelle (Huppert), an ex-nun-turned
hardcore- fiction-writer.
Never before has the spirituality of a
Hartley character been so tenderly laid out
as Isabelle's. Here, Hartley stages his most
bizarrely poignant moment to date, by way
of the memorable scene where Isabelle ex

plains her sexual inex
perience and uncom
mon vocation — she left the convent to an
swer her calling as a nymphomaniac — to
Thomas (again Donovan), an amnesiac
who finds himself sprawled on a cobble
stone Tribeca street one day and cannot re
call his potentially sinister identity.
As Isabelle, Thomas and Sofia eventual
ly run into each other, hot on their heels are
a couple of sharp-suited corporate hitmen.
In the Hartley cosmos though, aggressive
behavior is more than relegated to orga
nized crime; it represents an omnipresent
force from which there is no escape.
While the violent sphere is domestic in
"Trust," "Amateur" has brutality oozing
from every pore of downtown Manhattan's
human tapestry: a mother of two at a
street-corner phone booth, the waitress in
Isabelle s favorite diner and Sofia's earnest
accountant friend who undergoes a meta
morphosis following electric-shock treat
ment. Tragic after-effect of torture, or
cathartic release ol energies socially re
pressed?
Aesthetically, the- somber dark blues and
grays lend a noirish twist to the primaries
and pastels ot Hartley's first two teatures.
Sonically, the haunting score by Jefl Taylor
and Ned Rifle undermines the cool surface
textures to lament the impossibility of
emotional gratification for the Isabelle-
Thomas-Sofia trio, each an unqualified in
nocent in his / her own way.
Despite its anesthetic and modernist fa
cade, "Amateur" is really crafted upon the
mechanics of the human heart.
