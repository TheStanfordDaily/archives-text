# 'THE CURE'S' PRESCRIPTION IS A DISAPPOINTING PLACEBO
## 
### 
Somebody thought, "Lets make a really
cute, really touching, really powerful, yet di
gestible movie about children dealing with
AIDS." So director Peter Morton ("thir
tvsomething") brings us "The Cure."
This film tells the story of Kric, a fatherless
11 -year-old boy played, by brad Renfro ("The
Client"), who brings sunshine into the life of
I)exter, Joe Mazzello ("Jurassic Park"), who is

HIV-positive. Eric
decides they are
going to find the cure
to AIDS. They try
n i A

Buttertingers and poisonous flowers — but
they don't work.
The film's depiction of living with HIV is
insulting. In one scene, a derelict named Pony
corners the boys in a warehouse. So — in a
moment of selfless love — Dexter slits his
wrist and threatens Pony by saying "My blood
is poison. One drop could kill you." Dexter
thus chases Pony away.
Everyone's terrified of Dexter, including
Eric's evil mother. She's a drunk, a chain
smoker and a child abuser who tells Eric to
stay at least seven feet away from "that little
AIDS boy."
Then we have Dexter \ perfect mother,
I inda, played by Annabella Sciorra (lungle
Fever). Poor Eric, whose mother never cooks
for him, realizes that although I )exter is dying
of AIDS, he at least has a real mother.
Watching Sciorra in this movie is akin to
watching a wounded race horse — she seems
to be aching for a different movie than I lorton
had in mind.
The entire film hinges on our belief that all
prepubescent middle-class white boys are nat
urally stupid and reckless. While in the hospi
tal, I )exter and Eric play a game where I )exter
pretends to be dead, scaring the physician who
then rushes in to check his heart beat. Fright

eningly enough, the audience laughs.
At the end, Linda tells Eric he found the
cure by being Dexter's friend. So that is the
cure for AIDS.... Being a friend.
"The Cure" tries to be cutesy and ends up
trite. In an overworked scene, it depicts the
boys as they try to raft to New Orleans on four
tires. Then it tries to be deep, by creating an
underlying tension because Dexter has AIDS
or is 1 HV-positive - the movie never distin
guishes between the two.
The virus defines every character. There's
Dexter, who has AIDS. There's l.inda, whose
son h.is AIDS There's 1 ric, whose friend has
AIDS. Do not, under any circumstances, part
with anything of value, including your time,
to see this picture.
