# FAUX FRENCH ACCENTS AND FAMILIAR AMERICAN CHARM INSPIRE FRENCH KISS
## 
### 
When Harry first met Sally, Meg Ryan took
her place in the hearts of America as the
perkiest star to hit the screen in years. She
managed to charm, seduce and bewitch —
and all this before the infamous orgasm-at
the-deli scene.
Since then, Ryan has made a career out of

playing Sally in various guises; "French Kiss,"
originally titled "Paris Match," does not dis
appoint in this regard. The movie is a roman
tic comedy straight off the rack, yet it man
ages to keep the audience interested and defi
nitely delivers that familiar warm fuzzy feel
ing by the time the credits roll.
The basic premise involves Kate journey
ing to Paris — where her cheating fiance has
succumbed to the enticements of an oh-so
beautiful mademoiselle — to win back her
man. En route to the city of light, Kate meets
Luc, a carefree French thief played with gusto
by Kline. Luc stuffs his latest illegal acquisi
tion into Kate's knapsack to get through cus
toms and voila!— the connection is made.

The search for Mr. Fidelity and his new
galpal becomes intertwined with Luc's trou
bles with the law as the Ryan smile works its
magic on the unsuspecting thief.
While the romantic plot may be somewhat
predictable, the subplot involving Luc and his
contraband adds an unexpected twist or two
to the storyline.
Lawrence Kasdan ("The Big Chill"), who
usually contributes to the screenplay, only di
rects here. Hut while the movie lacks some of
the punchy Kasdan dialogue, high quality
performances abound. Ryan clearly has no
trouble with her ever cute Sally role, although
die hard fans might be expecting a little more
zaninessout of Kate.
Timothy Hutton is underused as the
cheatin' Charlie, lean Reno is quite fine as the
dogged gendarme pursing Luc, and Susan
Anbeh certainly looks gorgeous as the person
ality deprived seductress. Despite all of this,
even the Ryan smile, it is Kline's spectacular
performance as Luc that really makes the film.
The Kasdan-Kline combo has worked be
fore and it works again as Kline not only does
the French accent to the hilt, but manages to
convey all the emotion lying behind Luc's
money centered, supcrsuave tough-guy exte
rior without overdoing any of it.

Never mind the predictability, or the
sometimes silly punchlines. The Ryan charm
paired with Kasdan and Kline make this flick

pretty damn fun to watch. And don't forget
the warm fuzzy feeling.. .ah, l'amour.
