# Plot floats away in breezy' Smoke on the Mountain'
## 
### Linda Friedlieb 
'Smoke on the Mountain" is a harrowing
experience for a '90s Midwestern lew.
Set in a Bible Belt meeting in 193N North
Carolina, the Palo Alto Players' latest pro
duction is a gentle parody filled with blue
grass gospel and familial relationships ex
posed through a "witnessing."
The Sanders family has been invited to the
Mount Pleasant Baptist Church — a place
where dancing is forbidden, where donation
envelopes reading "For Creater Glory in the
Hereafter, Praise Be" are taped to the back of
each chair and where an electric light bulb
demonstrates that "Baptists are pushing on
into the modern world."
Pastor Mervin Oglethorpe (L.J. Mitchell)
a nervous, boyish looking young preach
er — begins "Smoke" .is he climbs on stage,
records the attendance (275) on a blackboard
and plays a few notes on the piano, while
checking his watch every few minutes.
It seems he sent the singers to the local
"Eat 'N' Run" — "a place that is usually true
to its name" — and they have yet to return.
Although the singers finally make an appear
ance, their arrival is only the beginning of the
chaos.
What "Smoke" lacks in plot — there is
none— it attempts to make up for in ener
gy-
The Sanders are a Bible-bound family: pa
triarch Burl, his brother Stanley, his wife
Vera, the twins Denise and Dennis and last,
oft-forgotten June. All but June sing and play
a variety of musical instruments in the (ami-

lv show and each is a
full-blown character.
Iu n e (Maxi m i I i -
enne Ewalt) is a mile
a-minute talking imp
who ostensibly lacks
any musical talent and
thus plays instruments
like the triangle and
the tambourine (the

kind that music teachers always told us we
didn't need any ability to play) and provides
sign language translations for some of the
songs.
A Scarlett O'Hara wannabe, Denise (Se
bastian Ryder who mystically has brown hair
in the play but blonde in this photo) is an un
abashed tlirt on her year off from Bible
school (the family can only afford to send
one twin each year).
"This is my year off from Bible school. 1
have plenty of time to make a picture," says
the aspiring actress, to the consternation of
her parents. "I think Christians should not
have to see Walt Disney movies only," she
complains, subtly critiquing the regulations
and restrictions of religion while admitting
that she really enjoyed "Snow White."
Her twin Dennis (Gus Kambietz) is a shy
boy whose avocation is preaching. But at first
he has his twin speak for him, saying "Dennis
wants to know if Jesus would mind it we'd
put a little swing in it."
After the preacher assures them that
"lesus would be open-minded," the duo

launch into a performance of "Christian
Cowboy" drawing on numerous non-reli
gious musical traditions.
Vera (Kathryn Tenney) sings and tickles
the ivories, but is more known for her ability
to quote the correct Bible verse for every oc
casion. When she and Pastor Mervin disagree
on any issue, their conflict escalates into a
run-on exchange of Biblical references forc
ing other family members to interrupt with a
song rather than wait for voluntary conflict
resolution.
Dad Burl (Mike Halloran) is a kind of af
fable patriarch figure, fairly stereotypical and
easily forgettable when compared to the
more striking figures in his family. His broth
er Stanley (Michael Ahem), a well-meaning
ex-convict, provides .1 dour presence on
stage, nearly breaking our hearts when he be
gins Act II with a rendition of "Everyone
I lome But Me," .1 tunc about his shame at his
inability to leave iai 1 to see his mother.
The beauty of "Smoke on the Mountain"
comes in the details: Pastor Mervin recording
the total of the Sunday school collection at 38
cents, Denise admitting she stole her sister's

purse and ate her breath mints on the way to
an illicit audition, the pastor's rage as he real
izes the girls are dancing during "I'll Live a
Million Years."
But each moment exists solely in isolation.
The plot threads that hold this tapestry to
gether are badly frayed and eventually the
question "What's the point?" loses its answer
amid the musical notes.
At one point, Pastor Mervin suggests,
"Let's take up an offering." We should offer
him a plot to go with the talent and humor on
this "Mountain."
