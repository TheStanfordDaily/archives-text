The Basketball Diaries
"The Basketball Diaries," directed
by Scott Kalvert, careens and crash
es like one long bad trip as it follows
the wild teenage life of Jim Carroll, a
contemporary poet and artist.
Carroll, played with extrerriß clarity
by Leonardo DiCaprio, clearly illus
trates the starkness of his world, re
volving around basketball and co
caine: "Vou gotta have presence on
the court. You either play like a
cheetah or a chimp... Me, I play
like a cheetah."
Carroll's life descends into a dizzy
ing drug addiction. At one point, he
and his best friend, Mickey (Mark
Wahlberg), pop a variety of pills be
fore an important basketball game.
The result is calamitous as they ca
reen into each other, steal the ball
from fellow team members and miss
catching the ball by several feet,
Kalvert directs this descent perfectly
with hallucinatory, reeling imagery.
"The Basketball Diaries" isn't flow
ery or gelled over with a shiny Holly
wood ending Instead, the movie is

gruesomely stark and realistic, and
the viewer is left agreeing with Car
roll when he remarks: "You know
this game never ends."
Farinelli
When a film is touted by its market
ing personnel as "the shocking story
of the castrato," the viewer it thus at
tracts must approach it with height
ened anticipation for a 110-minute
spectacle of lather-rich Baroque in
trigue.
Born in 1705 Naples, the prepu
bescent Carlo Broschi was savaged
without his consent so that his al
ready-conspicuous vocal talents
could be preserved beyond puberty
and physiology.
In terms of setting and artifice, the
Oscar-nominated biopic threatens to
leave opera aficionados in the audi
ence — opera queens in particular
— swooning in orgasmic unison It is
to director Gerard Corbiau's credit
that the material's potential for de
scending into absurdity and ab
solute pathos is held in check Note

the thunderous impact of Farinelli's
startling pause in the course of a
performance, provoked by the non
chalant book-reading preoccupation
of a beautiful woman amid the sell
out audience.
Unfortunately, much of the script's
underscoring of Farinelli's tormented
psyche and Riccardo's self-serving
dependence is let down by pedestri
an acting. Yet, all those contemplat
ing "Farinelli" can well be reassured
that like it or not, there is never a
dull, unsung moment.
While You Were Sleeping
"While You Were Sleeping," direct
ed by John Turteltaub, isn't a thriller
or an intriguing mystery, or even a
movie about a bomb planted on an
LA. bus. It's a simple romance story
revolving around an average girl
named Lucy Moderatz (Sandra Bul
lock).
Lucy lives a lonely life as a token
booth attendant for the Chicago
Transit Authority. She reflects, "I
have a cat, I have an apartment —

sole possession of the remote con
trol: That's very important." At Christ
mas she decorates the tree alone,
and makes conversation with the
cat.
Her life changes one day when
she notices the handsome man,
Peter Callaghan (Peter Gallagher),
who passes by her booth. Before
Lucy can actually get up the nerve to
talk to her mystery man, he tumbles
into the path of an approaching
train, is knocked unconscious and
falls into a coma. Things get even
more troublesome when Lucy is mis
taken for his fiancee by the hospital
staff and Peter's well-meaning fami
ly
Only Peter's younger brother, Jack
(Bill Pullman), is suspicious. His
doubts lead him to speak more with
Lucy, who is simultaneously becom
ing attracted to Jack.
Although "While You Were Sleep
ing" seems a bit unbelievable, Lucy
is a sympathetic character to anyone
who has ever lacked the guts to ap
proach someone else.
