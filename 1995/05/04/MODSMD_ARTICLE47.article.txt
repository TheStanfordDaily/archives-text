## Joe Rosenblum Think you're free? Step into Marsh McLuhan's 'The Medium' 
### 
Marshall McLuhan has recently been re
vived by the Saratoga International Theater
Institute theater company, under the direc
tion of the highly acclaimed Anne Bogart.
The play, " The Medium," poses some inter
esting questions based on the work of
McLuhan, who is now seen as a communica
tions guru 30 years after his ground-breaking
works, sort of the Nostradamus of his field.
Everything could be okay, a stylized
McLuhan comforts in the po-mo intricacy of
"The Medium." We are in control of technol
ogy. We hold the remote control, right? We
have the will to turn our TVs off and on,
right? We, by free will, choose to buy the Pearl
Jam album,right? We command the comput
er, we dial the telephone, we send the e-mail,
we choose to use a thermally-insulated
stainless-steel coffee mug!
On the other hand, he says that you are
hallucinating this experience. If you've never

done the drugs, maybe you've vicariously
tripped with Val Kilmer / Jim Morrison in
the movie "The Doors." Like you've vicari
ously made love to Sharon Stone in "Basic In
stinct;" like you vicariously shot up the finest
heroin in "Pulp Fiction." You can no longer
be innocent of anything once you have tra
versed the sea of the 'R-rated' movie.
And you think you are reading a column
in a newspaper, which in actuality you are su
perficially accomplishing â€” but really you
are symbolically participating in the post
modern condition. Sit back and relax, you
are experiencing the drug-like sensation
caused by the futile illusion that you are mas
ter of your own destiny.
Secretly you are attracted to these greasy
pages of slander and aphrodisiac on many levels.
You like it. You need it. You feed on it and you
hunger tor it. You do not hunger for informa
tion (though information controls your life),

you hunger for technology, for media. You suf
fer from the scopophilia of the masses. You
probably like to watch the O.J. Simpson trial.
Yes, you are one of the masses, you are not
an individual. Or you are an individual but
you don't matter because you are really just a
demographic.
Media causes you to worship your televi
sion and your rock idols and your contempo
rary heroes. You bought Pearl Jam's new
album, or you are alternative. You bought
Pavement. Or you are further removed from
the mainstream and you symbolically bought
nothing. You are constantly subject to innu
merable media as they surround you and in
fluence you. You even voluntarily pollute
your body with media: sugar, chocolate, caf
feine, nicotine, alcohol, THG, LSD.
You know that the truth is that there is no
Truth, yet you still went to see "True Lies."
And you laughed at all the stupid jokes.

You are trapped in a simulation of the sub
lime nature of reality from which the post
modern condition forbids you to escape (a
freakish scream sounds, then the click of a re
mote control).
Or maybe not.
1 drink Coca-Cola because I like it. 1 wear Levi s
because I think they're hip. 1 fly United because
they have better service. / make these choices.
Marshall McLuhan may have predicted
our servile relation to media, but he was op
timistic enough to think that maybe, if we
click our heels twice and think critically
about our relationship to our TVs, that we
would actually be in control.
Oh yeah, and the play was good too.

Modus Ensemble presents "The Medium" thi.
