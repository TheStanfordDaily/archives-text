# Hunting for a new dean
## Committee soliciting an Engineering School head 
### Marcus Jackson 
The School of Engineering has recently
initiated a search to find a successor to out
going Dean James Gibbons.
Gibbons, an electrical engineering pro
fessor, will leave his current position as
dean of the School of Engineering next fall
to assume the job of special counsel to the
president and provost for industry rela
tions.
A 12-member committee has been
formed to find a new dean for the school.
The committee, which consists of nine sci
ence and engineering faculty, two engineer
ing graduate students and Asst. Provost
Ann Fletcher, is chaired by Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Joseph W. Goodman.

All suggestions and nominations must be
received by the end of May. The new dean
will take over during the 1995-96 academic
year.
"The provost has asked us to have all of
our nominations in by the beginning of fall
quarter," Goodman said. "Jan. 1 would be
the earliest the new dean would start,"
The Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees made specific recommenda
tions as to who should be part of the search
committee. From these suggested mem
bers, Provost Condoleezza Rice made the
final selections.
As to the criteria that have been outlined
for potential candidates, Fletcher said, "our
primary consideration is nation
al and international academic
reputation."
The committee has sent let
ters to all faculty in the School of

Engineering asking for input on
the attributes the new dean
should have. Nominations for
candidates are being sought from
within and outside the Universi
ty.
"We're still thinking about
whether or not we'll enlist the
aid of a search firm," Goodman
said. "This is a national search."

Goodman added that the com
mittee is making an effort to con
sider candidates who are women
or members of minority groups.
"There are good candidates
who are women and minorities
so we want to be sure to find
them and evaluate them in the
context of Stanford University,"
he said.
