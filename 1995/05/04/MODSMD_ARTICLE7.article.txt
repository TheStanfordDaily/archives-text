# June date set
## Building to begin 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Three weeks after the Board of
Trustees approved two new grad
uate residences, details are being
finalized and construction will
begin on one residence in June.
The graduate student housing
at Governor's Corner, which will
hold 248 residents, is scheduled to
open in the fall of 1996, according
to Patricia Polhemus, project co
ordinator.
An additional 220 students will
live in the Stanford Graduate
School of Business Residential
Learning Center, scheduled to
open in June 1997, according to
Rodger Whitney, associate direc
tor of Housing and Dining Ser
vices.
The new residences will more
than compensate for this Septem
ber's dismantling of the Manzani
ta trailer park, which holds 150
graduate students.
"We'll be down this next year,
but the net will be 318 graduate
student spaces. This is a real step
forward," Whitney said.
Construction for the still
unnamed residence at Gover
nor's Corner will begin in June,
Polhemus said. It will be built in
the current site of the Gover
nor's Corner parking lot, which
will be relocated near the driving
range. The price tag will be about
$16.2 million, Whitney said.
Both Polhemus and Whitney
said they are excited about the
new project. The design strikes a
"balance between privacy and a
sense of community," Whitney
said.
The residence will contain 124
apartments, each with two bed
rooms, a full kitchen, a small din
ing room, a shared bathroom and
a living room. Modular wooden
furniture, similar to that used in
newly renovated undergraduate
dorms, will be offered. Each
apartment will be 575 square

feet, according to Polhemus. In
room wiring will also be
installed.
Polhemus stressed the impor
tance of having two separate bed
rooms. "There used to be very
few places where graduate stu
dents could get a room of their
own. Now it's understood. This
is their home," she said.
The two-and-a-half acre resi
dence will consist of three stucco
buildings — two four-story com
plexes and one three-story build
ing. Each building will have an
elevator for disabled access,
Whitney stressed.
Composing the community
area between the three buildings
will be a large wooden deck cen
tered around an old heritage oak
tree, said Polhemus. The tree
will be spared in construction
because "it is healthy and makes
a really pretty shape," she added.
Around the deck will be com
munity rooms, including three
lounges, a laundry room, a music
practice room and a computer
lab. The landscaping will be
"fairly naturalistic," Polhemus
said.

Other features of the Gover
nor's Corner housing project will
be parking spaces available for
all residents, security for bicycles
and the extension of the Mar
guerite shuttle service to the
area.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
Residential Learning Center is
currently entering the planning
stages. This project — funded by
the Business School so it will
have a place to house executives
during a summer training pro
gram — will cost approximately
$28 million, Whitney said. The
residence will be built at the cur
rent site of the Manzanita trail
ers and will consist of two-room
suites with a formal dining com
mons.
During the academic year, the
Business School will reserve 60
beds for executives, but will give
priority of the remaining 220
beds to first-year Business
School students, Whitney said.
The University is in the pro
cess of choosing an architect for
the Business School residence,
Polhemus said.
