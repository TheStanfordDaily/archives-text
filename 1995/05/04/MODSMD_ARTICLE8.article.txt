# Texaco investment will be examined

### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Students for Environmental Action
at Stanford came away with a partial vic
tory from yesterday's meeting with the
University's Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility.
Members of the panel said they would
immediately begin an investigation into
Texaco's environmental and human
rights record, said Harry Turner, man
aging director of the Stanford Manage
ment Company. In addition to outside
experts, SEAS members will have input
during the entire research process, he
said.
Turner said this is the first time stu
dents will be involved in the research

process of the company, adding that he
welcomes the comments of students and
was "impressed" with the SEAS presen
tation.
"Basically, the quality of the presen
tation was really excellent," Turner said.
"They gave us a good beginning to work
with and told us what needs to be done."
Turner said he will try to "move expe
ditiously" on the issue of whether the
University will vote for a corporate
proxy measure. If enough stockholders
vote for the proxy, Texaco's corporate di
rectors wili have to reexamine the com
pany's impact in the areas of the envi
ronment and human rights.
Turner added, however, that he does
not think that Stanford could support
the current proxy vote. The University's

Special Council for Investment Respon
sibility, which needs to review the
panel's recommendations, will not meet
anytime before next Monday's share
holder voting deadline, he said.
"These two groups meet separately
about three times a year," said SEAS
member Nick Thompson. "We don't an
ticipate them both meeting together in
time for the proxy vote next Monday."
SEAS member Kelly Naylor said
while she was disappointed that the
panel could not endorse the proxy, she
recognizes and accepts that change
comes slowly.
"To some extent we underestimated
the time frame of what was necessary to
get the University to vote on the
proxy," Naylor said. "But we
are pleased at the fact that the
panel was very receptive to our

ideas."
Naylor said she is also
pleased that SEAS will have
continued influence in the deci
sion-making process.
"We need to share our
research with them and contin
ue to move the process for
ward," she said.
