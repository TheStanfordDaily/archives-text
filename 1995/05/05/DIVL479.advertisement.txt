Education has its rewards. And here's proof! Students can get coupons good for *50
off economy class or *100 off business/first class tickets on Korean Air. Just fill out the
Sk\ PASS frequent flyer application above and mail. (Yes, current members are eligible
for the discount. Just reapply.) Once you redeem a coupon and travel on Korean Air,
be sure to save your tickets or boarding passes. Why? You can use them in upcoming Fall
promotions for great stuff, like notebook PCs and Korean Air tickets. Amazing, isn't it?
Your education is already helping you go places.
