# Hunger strikers host info session, candlelight vigil
## 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Reflecting on the events of
last spring's hunger strike, stu
dents from the Chicano / Latino
community gathered together
yesterday to talk about the hurt,
frustration and anger that they
felt last year during the strike.
"We are gathered out here
tonight in remembrance of the
hunger strike and I feel that it is
very symbolic that our candles
keep going out and we have to try
to keep them lit. This is like our
struggle and we must keep fight
ing, no matter what," said junior
Keri Castaneda.
This time last year the Stan
ford community witnessed a
three-day hunger strike in the
Quad by the Chicano / Latino
community.
The hunger strikers asked the
University for four concessions:
the establishment of a
Chicano / Latino Studies pro
gram, a University-wide grape
boycott, the establishment of a
community center in East Palo
Alto and a high-level job offer for
Cecilia Burciaga.
After three days of protest,
the hunger strikers and Univer
sity officials agreed to form com
mittees to look into the first
three demands.
"The events that led up to the
strike and the strike itself put a
lot of stress on the people in
volved; people suffered during

and before the strike. We felt
that the community as a whole
was getting beat up," said senior
Tamara Alvarado, one of the
fasters.
"When Cecilia Burciaga was
fired we were full of anger at the
University and suffering from
pure frustration at that point
and that is part of what led to the
hunger strike," said junior
Vanessa Alvarado, a Council of
Presidents member.
Yesterday's meeting began
with the short film "No Grapes,"
which captured the hurt and
anger that the immigrants who
work in the fields go through and
the effects that the pesticides in
grapes have on workers.
Last spring, when the film
"No Grapes" was shown during
Sunday Flicks, it was met with
laughter and rude remarks that
offended many in the Chi
cano / Latino community.
Felipe Barragan, co-chair of
MEChA, commented on the mis
conception that this event was
what mobilized the
Chicano / Latino community to
strike. According to Barragan,
students had been planning tl e
strike for months.
Vanessa Alvarado said that
the United Farm Workers tar
geted grapes because they are the
largest agricultural industry in
California and have the largest
amount of pesticides of any fruit.

Junior Leyda Garcia and freshmen Cecilia Balli and Ernesto Mar
tinez (l-r) commemorate the one-year anniversary of the 1994
hunger strike at a candlelight vigil last night.
"We saw the urgency of the
situation and the need for Stan
ford to move on this issue.
Stanford is one of the top col
leges in the nation and we felt
that if a university like ours
took a stand the rest would
too," said faster Eva Silva, a
graduate student.
"The hardest part was calling
my mom and telling her that I
was going to stop eating for this
cause and hearing her cry. When

this kind of thing happens, it
affects everyone," said faster
Julia Gonzalez Luna, a graduate
student.
Graduate student Rod
Hernandez said the students
have the power to change the
University.
"A professor stopped me and
said, 'We should have supported
you guys a long time ago.' The
strike really opened the eyes of
the faculty and the students
when it came to grape issues and
Chicano Studies," said Gonzalez
Luna.
Members of the Chicano com
munity at the discussion showed

that they still possess very
strong feelings about the hunger
strike.
This feeling was apparent at a
candlelight vigil held in the Main
Quad last night, where many
students in the Chicano / Latino
community voiced their feelings
on various issues, ranging from
the firing of Burciaga to the state
of Chicanos and Latinos
throughout the nation.
"This has had a major impact
on the Chicano community. It
has been a major stepping stone
and it isn't over. The struggle
will always continue," Vanessa
Alvarado said.
