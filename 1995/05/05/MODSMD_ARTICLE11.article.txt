## Marchers mourn Kent State victims 
### 
KENT, Ohio (AP) — Kent State remem
bered with the tolling of a bell, a chalk message
in a parking lot and silence.
There were peace signs and people dancing
barefoot. Peter, Paul and Mary sang "Blowin'
in the Wind." Some Lit candles.
About 3,000 people showed up yesterday to
mark the 25th anniversary of the day that a
cluster of National Guardsmen opened fire
and killed four students during an anti-war
protest.
Some in the crowd weren't born back then.
Others remember all too well.
In the hilltop parking lot where the slain
students fell, silent candlebearers stood vigil
from midnight until a bell tolled at exactly
12:24 p.m., the moment the shooting began.
Around them, people chalked peace signs,
flowers and messages into the blacktop. "Has
anything in the way of change become real?
HAVE WE LEARNED?" one said.
After singing "Blowin' in the Wind" with
the Kent State Chorale, Peter, Paul & Mary
performed at an evening benefit concert.
Earlier in the day, the school's victory bell
rang 15 times — once for each of the 13 stu
dents killed or wounded and once for each of
two students killed at Jackson State Universi
ty in Mississippi 10 days later.
Around a stark granite memorial to the
dead, near 58,175 daffodils decorating the hill
side — one for each American killed in the war
— students, former students and others
paused to remember Allison Krause, Jeffrey
Miller, Sandy Scheuer and Bill Schroeder.
Mary Ann Vecchio, whose moment of agony
kneeling near Miller was frozen in a Pulitzer
Prize-winning photograph, stood on the spot
where he died. The photo, taken by student

photographer John Filo, was distributed
worldwide by The Associated Press.
Vecchio was a 14-year-old runaway when
she kneeled, her arms upraised in horror, over
Miller as he lay dying.
"Teach love. And compassion," she said in
an impromptu speech at the candlelight vigil.
"I ask all the people who are teachers ... to
step back, take a breath and think about it."
It was the first time Mary Travers of Peter,
Paul and Mary had seen the memorial, dedi
cated in 1990. Manv have criticized it as too lit

tle, too late. Travers said the memorial suits its
purpose.
"As a memorial, as a physical thing, it's
enough," she said. "The real memorial, of
course, and the responsibility of the university,
is to infuse the student body with the moral
questions that it produces."
"I think people have to remember," said
Chris Valenti, a 22-year-old Kent student. "I
like to come to them (the anniversaries), read
books about them (the students). It's interest
ing to me."
