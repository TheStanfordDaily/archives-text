Wilson hired alien
SAC HAM ENT O, Calif. (AP) — Democrats called
Gov. Pete Wilson a hypocrite yesterday and demand
ed an investigation after he acknowledged an illegal
immigrant had worked as a maid in his home.
A Wilson campaign source, meanwhile, said
aides were checking on the immigration status of
all domestic help the governor and his current
wife, Gayle, have employed in the past dozen
years to make certain there were no additional
embarrassments.
"Wilson got caught in his dirty little secret.
Wilson broke the law," said California Democrat
ic Party Chairman Bill Press. "Wilson should be
investigated by the U.S. Justice Department. Wil
son should be prosecuted just like any other com
mon criminal."
A spokesman for the governor, Sean Walsh,
called Press' statements "ridiculous."
Wilson, a Republican who ran for re-election
last year on a platform of denying education, wel
fare and other benefits to illegal immigrants,
issued a statement confirming that starting in
1978 he and his first wife, Betty Hosie, employed
a maid who was in the country illegally.
Wilson, who is planning a 1996 presidential
run, also said that he had not paid Social Security
taxes on the maid's income but would do so.

Prospects for car deal poor
WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) - Nego
tiators from the United States and Japan voiced
increasing pessimism yesterday over chances of
agreement in a contentious trade fight involving
autos, while President Clinton warned of a
"strong response" if no deal is reached.
The administration continued to insist that
yesterday and today represented the make-or
break period for its 20-month campaign to force
open Japan's market to American-made vehicles
and auto parts.
Without significant progress, officials said, the
president's National Economic Council was likely
go forward with a list targeting more than $1 bil
lion in Japanese products for punitive tariffs in
the largest such trade action in U.S. history. The
council is scheduled to meet over the weekend.
In Washington, meanwhile, Clinton told the
Detroit Free Press that "the United States is com
mitted to taking strong action" if no deal is
reached.
"I have worked for over two years on this,"
Clinton said in an interview for today's edition of
the Free Press. "We've tried all those other things
and they have not worked, so we are going to have
to be very strong; and to be strong you have to be
prepared to take strong action if your words fail."
