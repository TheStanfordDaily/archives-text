WASHINGTON (AP) - Bruce
Lindsey, a White House lawyer and
one of President Clinton's closest
advisers, has been told by Whitewa
ter prosecutors he is a target of
their investigation, three individu
als familiar with the case said yes
terday.
Lindsey received the formal noti
fication late this winter, as the
expansive Whitewater probe
stretched closer to the Oval Office,
one of the sources said.
A target is someone who is likely
to be indicted, according to the U.S.
Attorneys' Manual. All three
sources spoke on condition of
anonymity and are familiar with
the investigation.
Prosecutors are investigating
whether Lindsey, the latest mem
ber of Clinton's Arkansas inner cir
cle ensnarled in controversy, tried
to conceal bank withdrawals by the
1990 Clinton gubernatorial cam
paign.
White House officials, noting
that 1990 campaign spending was
made public five years ago, quickly
jumped to the defense of Lindsey,
who was the '90 campaign's trea
surer.
Without confirming that Lind
sey was a target, presidential
spokesman Mike McCurry said,
"The president has known the sta
tus of the inquiry for some time. He
is convinced Bruce did nothing
wrong."
Aides, even privately, say the

president shows no signs of distanc
ing himself from Lindsey, who is
now White House deputy counsel.
The development became public
two days after Arkansas banker
Neil Ainley pleaded guilty and
promised to cooperate with White
water prosecutors. Lindsey expects
Ainley, former president of the
Perry County Bank in Perryville,
Ark., to accuse him of ordering that
the withdrawals be hidden from the
Internal Revenue Service, one of
the sources said.
Ainley was indicted Feb. 28, but
the sources were not sure whether
Lindsey was notified before or after
Ainley's indictment that he is a tar
get.
Prosecutors are under pressure
to move against Lindsey because
the statute of limitations on the
alleged infractions expires at the
end of this month.
Ainley is accused of conspiring to
hide a $30,000 campaign withdraw
al from Clinton campaign's account
in Ainley's bank before the 1990
primary and $22,500 in with
drawals before the general election.
Lindsey has acknowledged he
was involved in obtaining the
$30,000 withdrawal. Although all
the cash was withdrawn in one day,
Lindsey obtained it through four
checks of $7,500 each. Federal
statutes aimed at thwarting money
laundering require banks to report
any cash transaction of $10,000 or
more to the IRS.
