## Editorial Give us a little peek 
### 
Administration should
allow students, faculty
to see a detailed budget

AFTER VIGOROUSLY dis
cussing and deciding opin
ions on the Commencement
procession and ASSU Senate, we
Editorial Board members set our
sights on a recent announcement
that the schools at Stanford were
having their budgets cut (by not
having their budgets increased for
inflation next year), forcing larger
sections and fewer teaching assis-

tants in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
All the Edit Board had to
do was suggest some other
places in the budget to cut
the money
That is when we were
struck dumb.
None of our board mem
bers — indeed very few stu-

dents, staff or faculty at this Uni
versity — could intelligently carry
out this task. The reason is that we
do not have enough information on
Stanford's upcoming budget.
Those who make the budget hold it
very tightly to their chests, and the
rest of us get only a peek, at best.
From time to time, administra
tors claim they want students to be
intelligently involved in the school.
Surely this is important. Yet if stu
dents cannot see a detailed budget,
they cannot participate intelligent
ly. At best, students will forward
half-informed suggestions and exe
cute half-baked actions. At worst,
rumors will take the day.
What about faculty? They are
the ones who theoretically govern
many aspects of the University,
remember. Few administrators
would be willing to publicly contra
dict this statement. Yet it is just as
hard for most faculty members to
find out detailed budget informa
tion — and it is hard to govern well
without knowing the financial side
of things.
And let us not forget the staff,

who in many ways really run the
University. These are the same
people who are most affected by
cuts, who bear the brunt of lay-offs
and structural changes. Surely
they should be allowed to see the
budget that affects them so much.
But none of these groups can see
the document. The faculty,
through its senate, gets a brief per
sonal overview from the provost
after most decisions have been
made, and a half-hour or so to ask
questions on the spot. True, the
University releases a budget plan
which is very helpful, but it is just
an overview (the 1994-95 plan was
80 pages). Trying to comment

intelligently from this docu
ment is like trying to write a
paper from Cliffs Notes.
Why do top officials keep
the budget sealed tightly
when, ideally, there are
many reasons to make it
public? One is tempted to
say they must be hiding

something, but that is too
easy and cheap an answer — and
very likely wrong.
The real answer, at least in part,
is that no one has to show the bud
get, and it is simpler not to. If, for
just one example, you must make
tough budget choices, why face the
hassle of fielding dozens of extra
suggestions from people who prob
ably are trying to protect some per
sonal interest? Also, why risk giv
ing detailed financial information
to people who might misinterpret
it or misuse it?
Why? Because the University
should. No, there is no legal obli
gation to reveal detailed budgets.
There is, however, a moral issue.
If Stanford officials — including
the trustees — are really going to
support student and staff involve
ment in the University; if they are
going to claim that faculty are in
charge of some areas; if they are
going to show that they trust
their students and employees;
then they should follow through
by making a detailed budget pub
lic.
It's onlv fair.
