Fruitful public dialogue requires calm, open discourse

WE ARE WRITING to protest the
tone of Jennifer Chien's letter
printed in The Daily on Tuesday,
May 2. The sort of strident, hate-mon
gering vitriol typified by Chien's letter
has no place in either our University's or
our nation's dialogue.
Laced throughout her letter are a
panoply of unrepentantly ad hominem
attacks. She repeatedly questions the
intellectual honesty of the original let
ter's authors — who wrote to criticize
the defense of racial preferences in hiring

and admissions — and characterizes
them as ignorant, malevolent, snake-oil
salesmen. She says they are "slippery,"
"[poorl students of statistics," who use
"ploys" and "pseudo-logic" to "sell" their
"one-sided ideas."
However, Chien does not content her
self with mere name-calling; she proceeds
to indict her opponents by malicious
comparison. She compares the original
authors to tobacco company researchers,
whom she implies have no regard for
truth. Chien's hate-mongering reaches

its regrettable nadir in her penultimate
paragraph, in which she compares peoplt
with whom she disagrees to Holocaust
revisionists.
Oddly enough, Chien does not engage
in these tactics out of a lack of cogent
arguments. She presents a number of
substantive, though debatable, points.
Unfortunately, these are lost in the
morass of vituperative rhetoric compris
ing the bulk of her letter.
In closing, we express our hope that
Chien will take this opportunity to

reflect upon the necessity of dispassion
ate, open discourse in confronting impor
tant and emotionally-charged issues. In
his recent speech in the aftermath of the
Oklahoma City tragedy, our president
emphasized the importance of holding to
a calm and civil tone in our public dia
logue; perhaps we all have something to
learn from Mr. Clinton in this.
