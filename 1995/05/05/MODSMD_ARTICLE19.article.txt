## An illiterate bibliophile 
### 
I DON'T READ anymore. I wonder if
anyone reads nowadays. I do buy
books, though.
I regularly visit the bookstore.
There, I browse and leaf through trade
paperbacks, a few displayed full front
while the rest show merely spines. They
form much more than a visual experi
ence: the subtle sound of flipping pages,
suggesting that to pick up a book and
look through it is to meet its author and
learn its contents; the many sizes and
sometimes surprising weights of differ
ent volumes; the taut texture of the
cloth binding on a reprinted classic or
the slick surface of the latest best-sell
er; the virgin pages, with a fresh scent
of ink and faint odor of woodiness.
The sight of books is alluring as well.
I judge books by their covers. The
graphic design of books has improved
over the years, or perhaps it is only my
own sense of style. I like the extremes:
the proliferation of tiny books, impulse
purchase items like chewing gum, jux
taposed with the stacks of huge books,
bought only as gifts or as remainders on
sale. The marketing of literature
through the ages — there is a subject
for a doctoral dissertation in our con
flict over the "canon."
While I no longer read, I am always
scanning, skimming, underlining, high
lighting, jotting notes in margins. ... I
frequently make allusions and drop ref
erences, cite and quote, discuss and

debate, contributing counterfeit coin to
the marketplace of ideas — as in talking
about "The Bell Curve." I occasionally
glance at abstracts in obtuse scholarly
journals and reviews in pretentious
periodicals. I sometimes listen to books
on tape and interviews with authors on
the radio. And I cannot help but see
movie adaptations.
I want to write books. I imagine
myself as Thoreau, with a library con
sisting of only my own work. I want to
make books. I could learn the arts and
crafts of papermaking, binding, callig
raphy, typography, layout and origami.
I might even destroy books. Eccentric
actor Crispin Glover, with his obscure
projects, is carrying on that tradition of
altering already published work as a
performance art, different than burn
ing books as the heretic's heretic.
Nonetheless, I am suited to be an
academic. Perversely, I like to read foot
notes (on the perversity of footnotes, cf.
"Pulp Fiction"). I look forward to
perusing Gibbon for no other reason. I
have heard praise for the late historian
John Boswell on this account.
In any event, I cannot quite recall
when I became an illiterate bibliophile.
Perhaps I was reading Jorge Luis
Borges or another author of his ilk. I
remember reading in college, but books
that were not required for class. I
remember reading in law school, until
my eyes worsened and I needed reading

glasses. I may have read at work, but it
is a different kind of reading, a boring,
stressful, mechanical process.
At my lowest point, I could barely
manage a newspaper article; for one
thing, they are all so depressing. I rely
on headlines. Surprisingly, The Wall
Street Journal, with its multiple sub
headlines and much-touted center
columns, turns out to be the best fish
wrapping for the purpose.
Now and then, I also try a magazine
article, usually while in the bathroom. I
am working my way up slowly, from the
reprints in Harper's to the articles at
the front of the Atlantic, to the culture
section of The New Republic. Now that
the New Yorker is like Vanity Fair, I
may hazard a few of its shorter pieces.
I don't know what I would read if I
did read. Catalogs are my primary
source material. My current favorite is
from Levenger, an expensive outfit
whose motto is "Tools for Serious Read
ers." They sell gargoyles, lapdesks,
lamps, chairs, bookcases and wallets,
among other things. No books.
Can't wait for hypertext. I assume
the hyper refers to the reader.

Baker used to complain he could not
finish Proust; Frank has never even
started Proust.
