## Xanadu bike thief faces 25 years to life 
### Carolyn Sleeth 
Jed Harlan Miller may now face a life sentence
after being convicted of stealing two bikes from
Xanadu last spring.
Miller — the first person in Santa Clara Coun
ty to be charged under the state's "three strikes,
you're out" law — was sentenced Wednesday to
prison for 25 years to life, although he only has
one violent crime on his record.

Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer caught
Miller speeding near Wilbur Hall on March 9,
1994, in a stolen pickup truck with two mountain
bikes in the back.
At the sentencing Wednesday, Santa Clara
Superior Court Judge Paul Teilh said that it was
"unfortunate that the third strike need not be a
violent felony." Miller was convicted of auto
theft, grand theft and petty theft.
Harlan's past two "strikes" both occurred

more than eight years ago. In 1981, he was con
victed of assault with a knife — he had been
stabbed and disabled in the fight but still pled
guilty.
In 1986, Miller committed a residential bur
glary in San Francisco.
Since then, Miller has been in and out of jail
on misdemeanor counts, according to Charles
Gillan, the public defender representing Miller.
