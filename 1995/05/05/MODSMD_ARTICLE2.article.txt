## Xanadu bike thief faces 25 years to life 
### Carolyn Sleeth 
Jed Harlan Miller may now face a life sentence
after being convicted of stealing two bikes from
Xanadu last spring.
Miller — the first person in Santa Clara Coun
ty to be charged under the state's "three strikes,
you're out" law — was sentenced Wednesday to
prison for 25 years to life, although he only has
one violent crime on his record.

Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer caught
Miller speeding near Wilbur Hall on March 9,
1994, in a stolen pickup truck with two mountain
bikes in the back.
At the sentencing Wednesday, Santa Clara
Superior Court Judge Paul Teilh said that it was
"unfortunate that the third strike need not be a
violent felony." Miller was convicted of auto
theft, grand theft and petty theft.
Harlan's past two "strikes" both occurred

more than eight years ago. In 1981, he was con
victed of assault with a knife — he had been
stabbed and disabled in the fight but still pled
guilty.
In 1986, Miller committed a residential bur
glary in San Francisco.
Since then, Miller has been in and out of jail
on misdemeanor counts, according to Charles
Gillan, the public defender representing Miller.
When he was arrested last
spring at Stanford, Miller had only
been out of prison for eight days.
The "three strikes" law passed
through the state legislature soon
after the kidnaping and slaying of
12-year-old Polly Klaas of
Petaluma.
The law went into effect on

March 7, 1994, making Miller the
first person in Santa Clara Coun
ty to fall under the new law.
In an interview yesterday,
Gillan expressed strong opposition
to the "three strikes" law, which
has been criticized by some as pun
ishing non-violent crimes rather
than those it was intended to
deter.
"The law is ridiculous and
appalling," Gillan said. "The [per
son] who drafted it has the writ
ing skills of Beavis and Butthead.

"When the law passed there
was a lot of commotion because
people felt it was racially motivat
ed," he added. "Jed is a white guy.
... People will hold him up as
proof that the law is even-hand
ed."
The prosecuting attorney,
Cameron Bowman, said at
Wednesday's sentencing that
Miller is a "career criminal,
unable to exist outside prison set
tings ... who has shown violent
tendencies."
