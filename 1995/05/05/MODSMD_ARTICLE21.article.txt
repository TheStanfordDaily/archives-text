## Discovering the politics of meaning in Palo Alto 
### 
An unfortunate consequence
of Leland Stanford's decision to sit
uate his university on barren pas
ture is that the school's geography has
encouraged a relentless, horizontal
sprawl. The farther the boundaries of
Stanford extend, the more recessed from
the surrounding community its students
become. You can still stroll to Palo Alto
on a Thursday evening for dinner, but
you probably won't make it back in time
for both "Seinfeld" and "Friends."
It is somewhat unsurprising, then,
that only a smattering of students
attended to the appearance of Cornel
West and Michael Lerner at Printers, Inc.
bookstore on California Avenue last
week. The crowd that gathered there
Thursday numbered about 100 or so, but
they were predominantly middle-aged
and suburban — not exactly your average
CIV lecture.
For West and Lerner, co-authors of a
new book, "Blacks and Jews: Let the
Healing Begin," discussing politics with
such a group is preaching to the choir.
West, who is black, and Lerner, a Jew,
arguably stand as the eminent liberal
intellectuals in America today. Their
book addresses the deterioration of rela
tions between blacks and Jews — two of
the country's greatest progressive forces

— since the 19605. The two men contend
that the hate the two groups aim at each
other is both misdirected and counter
productive, and weakens their historic,
shared battle against racial injustice.
But West and Lerner are drawn
together because they share a common
vision that goes beyond the conciliation of
blacks and Jews. Last week, both spoke of
creating of a new progressivism — one
based not on the ideologies of left or right,
but on uplift and compassion and the pur
suit of social and economic equality.
Not that those ideas are anything new.
Over the last few years, Lerner has
expounded on his self-titled "politics of
meaning" in the pages of his magazine,
Tikkun. The politics of meaning, he has
written, are about "how to build a society
based on love and connection, a society in
which the bottom line would not be prof
it and power, but ethical and spiritual
sensibility and a sense of community,
mutual caring and responsibility." No
less a figure than Hillary Rodham Clin
ton in 1993 proclaimed Lerner's views an
elixir for American society's ills. But the
politics of meaning soon capitulated to
the meaning of politics: Liberals attacked
Lerner for sounding disturbingly like Pat
Robertson; conservatives said he sounded
disturbingly like Jimmy Carter.

Soon enough, the Clintons backed
away from the politics of meaning, claim
ing that while it all sounded nice, you'd
never get it past Congress. Chastened,
Lerner lashed out at Clinton and took his
campaign to the streets, beginning a
grass-roots mobilization campaign that
remains in its embryonic stages. After his
talk last week, volunteers fanned out into
the audience, encouraging signatures and
enlisting new recruits.
Is this all empty posturing, more
vague idealism than useful prescription?
Maybe. But the need for a calmer, more
reasoned, more ethical conception of pol
itics has never been greater. Standing on
the edge of a millennium, confronted
with a widening gulf between rich and
poor, understandably skeptical about
their chosen leaders, Americans are
starving. And this malaise, it seems, now
afflicts even the heretofore privileged —
which suggests why a white man two
weeks ago was moved to commit the most
horrific human cataclysm ever wrought
on our nation's soil.
No one can explain the motivations of
such an individual; to the extent that we
remain incredulous at the carnage, the
action defies explanation. But it is safe to
say, and outrageous for conservatives to
deny, that a climate of hate and intoler

ance pervades our society. When the
country's leading talk-radio loudmouth
conflates feminists with the minions of
Adolph Hitler; when a candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination says
"America is the only country where all its
poor people are fat," then it is plain that
we have developed an uncivil discourse, a
culture of intemperance.
President Clinton made a healthy, if
politically foolish, decision to take on the
these insidious elements last week. Yet
the true battle — one that Stanford liber
als, sans speech code, should now take up
— is not exorcising expressions of hate,
but hate itself. That can only be done by
identifying the conditions that foment
hate and intolerance, the same ones that
motivate the playground bully: anxiety,
paranoia and self-loathing. James Bald
win recognized those truths 30 years ago,
when he advocated that blacks display a
"tough love" toward their white oppres
sors, for white America's racism
stemmed from insecurities about itself.
Today, who among us does not feel
insecurity — about our jobs, our identi
ties, our lives? UCLA political scientist
James Q. Wilson says, "We are living in
the most risk-averse, nervous period in
our history." Suffering, for one, doesn't
discriminate; so maybe the solutions can

be encompassing as well. Last week, Ted
Koppel hosted a session of Nightline from
Decker, Mich., home of the Michigan mili
tia. Toward the end of the tense meeting,
a woman spoke up. She talked about how
people have stopped caring about each
other, how we as a nation have abandoned
any notion of ethical responsibility. She
talked about love. Not too long ago,
maybe all the way until April 19, most
people, including myself, would have
scoffed at such maudlin sentiments. That
night, the audience applauded.
Curing what ails us, to be sure, is a
task that would perplex kings. Yet we still
gaze at government for answers, discard
those we have lost patience with, and in
the end find that Newt Gingrich helps as
little as Bill Clinton. The politics of mean
ing, alas, won't make it to Washington
anytime soon. So where does it begin?
Perhaps it begins with something as sim
ple as what Cornel West and Michael
Lerner, the black and the Jew, offered
each other when they finished speaking
in Palo Alto: an embrace.
