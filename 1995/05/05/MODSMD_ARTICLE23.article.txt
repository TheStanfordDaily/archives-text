# Rinc-a-Delt to rock the Farm next week

### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
After toiling relentlessly for six months, the
Stanford Concert Network and the residents of
Rinconada are putting the finishing touches on
next weekend's 1995 Rinc-a-Delt concert festi
val at Wilbur Field.
"We've worked hard to bring in a wide vari
ety of bands and music," said junior Greg
Siegel of the Stanford Concert Network. "The
bands are coming from a lot of different genres
and a broad musical experience."
In addition to the bands, organizers of this
year's festival plan to have carnival attractions
and concession stands.
"We've made it into the biggest party of the
year," said Siegel, comparing it to Lollapalooza.
Among the bands that have been confirmed:
Broun Fellinis, The Cherry Poppin' Daddies,
Marginal Prophets and The Strangers.
Rinc-a-Delt began 19 years ago as a parody
party "in retaliation" against the fraternities,
said Corky Gainsford, Rinc-a-Delt's director of
music and entertainment. While the genesis of
the festival has long faded, the idea of a free
event has grown, he added.
"The frat part is pretty much faded. This

year, we began referring to it as 'Rinc-a-
Palooza,' " said Gainsford. "It's gotten bigger
in the past years, but we've kept it free and
open to all Stanford students."
Gainsford said that the effort and resources
required to hold an event of this magnitude
were formidable.
"It's been a long, hard, painful process,"
said Gainsford. "It was basically trying to find
who was available, who was here and who we
could afTord."
Steph DiChiara, financial director of Rinc-a-
Delt, said that while the Stanford Concert Net
work received special-fee funding for the event,
Rinconada had to raise more than 65 percent of
the money to pay for the event by selling 1,000
flowers and delivering them on Valentine's
Day, donating wages from working at gymnas
tics meets and "dorm begging."
"We may end up working past Rinc-a-Delt to
meet our goal of $7,000," DiChiara said.
Organizers anticipate a "fun-filled day in
the sun." Last year's festival — which featured
"They Might Be Giants" as the headlining
band — drew over 6,000 people.
"Last year, we were very successful," said
Siegel. "I can't say yet who the headlining band
for this year's festival is, but I can tell you that

it's a nationally known group."
Last year, organizers advertised and attract
ed people outside of Stanford, but this year
they decided not to in order to limit the event's
"commercialization," Siegel said.
"We sold tickets last year through BASS
ticket outlet and we got about 2,000 tickets
sold," said Siegel. "But this year we decided to
limit the commercialization of Rinc-a-Delt and
will not be selling tickets to the general pub
lic."
"This year, we concentrated on the Stanford
community," said Daniel Rochberg, Rinc-a-
Delt's publicity director. "Last year it really
went commercial and we wanted this to be a
party just for Stanford."
And rather than concentrating on getting
big-name entertainment, organizers thought
that they should return to the "traditional
role" of Rinc-a-Delt.
"The tradition of Rinc-a-Delt has been to
bring up-and-coming bands to campus,"
Rochberg said. For example, the Red Hot Chili
Peppers played at the event in 1989.
In past years, Rinc-a-Delt has been held in
Frost Amphitheater but organizers decided to
move the event's location because the
amphitheater is currently being renovated.
