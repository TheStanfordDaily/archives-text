# Gavilan residents apprehend bike thief

After three days of watching a suspicious
man sleep in their lounge and use their bath
rooms, a group of Gavilan residents decided late
Monday night to take the matter into their own
hands.
Their initiative resulted in a call to the Stan
ford Police and the subsequent arrest of Mihai
George Garduza — a 32-year-old Mountain
View resident — for suspicion of stealing a bicy
cle from a Stanford Law School student.
Just before midnight on Monday, approxi
mately 20 Gavilan residents cornered Garduza
outside the dormitory.
"There were about 20 of us that were all
together. We just approached him and asked
him where he was from [andl ... what he was
doing here," said senior Sonya Sethi, a resident

assistant in Gavilan.
According to Sethi, Garduza gave the stu
dents conflicting stories about where he was
from."He said he was from Romania and then
he said he was from Luxembourg. We thought
he had a German accent," Sethi said. "He also
gave us a bogus name."
Freshman Danny Bramzon, a Gavilan resi
dent, said that Garduza said he was looking for
a student named Dan Gunther, "who doesn't
exist on the Stanford campus." Bramzon said
that Garduza was dressed in nice clothing and
was clean-shaven.
After questioning Garduza, the residents
decided to call the police, Bramzon said.
When the police arrived at the scene, they
also questioned Garduza and eventually seized
his bicycle, which turned out to have been stolen
from a Law School student.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul

Niemeyer, the student left his bicycle unlocked
in a rack at about 5:45 p.m. on Monday, and
when he came back at 8:30 p.m. it was gone.
Garduza admitted to stealing the bicycle,
Niemeyer said.
Garduza was booked into San Jose Main Jail
for possession of stolen property. He said he
stole the bicycle because someone stole his bike.
"I don't think this guy is a real serious bike
thief; he's just an opportunist," Niemeyer said.
"I think he's kind of a campus groupie. He's
been up at the Berkeley campus before too."
Gavilan residents said that Garduza had
been hanging out in their dormitory since Sat
urday. He apparently slept in the residence's
lounge, showered in the bathroom and even
"bummed a cigarette off someone," Sethi said.
"Everyone noticed him because you don't
usually see a 40-year-old guy hanging out in a
dormitory," Sethi said.
