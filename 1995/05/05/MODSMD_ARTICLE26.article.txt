## After losing 23 straight to Cal... Track hopes to end Big Streak 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
California. Weenies. You know,
the school that stole our Axe.
They're coming to Stanford Stadium
this Saturday. It's Big Meet time,
and the Stanford track team hopes to
come away with the victory in its last
dual meet of the season and the last
Big Meet ever at Stanford Stadium.
However, history is working
against the Cardinal men's squad.
Cal has won the last 23 of the annu
al meetings and boasts a 57-41-3
record in the 101 meets dating back
to 1893.
The Stanford women lead the
cross-bay series 8-7 in the 15 years
they hav'„ competed. Last year, the
Golden Bears barely won the meet at
Berkeley with a 73-72 victory.
"Every meet you want to win and
this is no different," said senior co
captain Tovi Abello. "But it is Cal
and I wouldn't say I wouldn't really
enjoy it if we won."
In fact this is a meet that holds
great importance not only for the
present team but also for alumni on
both sides of the Bay. At a press con
ference on Tuesday, former Stanford
coach Payton Jordan, the last coach
to beat Cal back in 1971, fondly
remembered the lore of the Big Meet.
"There was always something dif
ferent happening. Cal has always
been the Big Meet and today it still is
the Big Meet."
Senior co-captain Christy Boyd
spoke with another alumnus at the
track on Wednesday. Former U.S.
Senator Alan Cranston, a familiar
mainstay on the oval in his USA team
sweats spoke with Boyd giving her
encouragement as he remembered
his own Big Meet victory in the late

1930s when he ran for Stanford.
"There's a lot of emotion in
my last dual meet on the track in
the stadium," Boyd said. "We're
confident that if we get out there
and keep our composure, as we
have all year, we'll surprise a lot
of people with how good we are.
"There's no point in getting all
hyped up about it. It's gonna hap
pen when we get to the track."
Best of all for the Cardinal,
this year the squad has an
extremely good chance of win
ning. The Stanford men match
up well with Cal's runners in the
sprints and hurdles. If freshman
Anthony Bookman and senior
Branyon Davis can maintain
their early form in the 100- and
200-meter dashes they should be
able to neutralize Cal's sopho
more Jerod Cherry.
In the sprints, sophomore
Jimmie Johnson — who won a
disputed 200-meter race at the
California / Nevada State Cham
pionships last week — will be the
workhorse, hopefully providing
five first place points in both the
200- and 400-meter races.
Stanford's middle distance
core will be helped by the loss for
the season of Cal's four-time Ail-
American runner Richie Boulet
to bronchitis.
"(Cal's not having] Boulet
makes a significant difference,
but they have other back up peo
ple like [senior Craig] Magness,"
said Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna.
Magness remains the primary
threat in the 800 and 1,500-
meter races. Magness boasts a 3
minute, 48.88 second best time in
the 1500 meters from last week's
State Championships. Fortu
nately, Stanford's Erik Spayde
ran 3:48.78 to take second place
at the Championships ahead of
Magness. Look for the 1500
meters to be a close, strategic
race from start to finish. Stan
ford boasts a strong group of run
ners who can all run under 3:50,
while Cal squarely lays its hopes
on Magness.
In the 800-meters Magness
has run 1:49.98, more than two
seconds faster than any of Stan
ford's runners. Cal's freshman
Ethan Taub beat Stanford senior
Dan McGinn by 0.5 seconds at
last week's championships.
McGinn and junior Joe Karl
gaard, who has run just as fast as
Taub this year, should be able to
take Taub to a photo-finish if
they run a strong race utilizing
their deeper 800-meter team
mates.

In the longer distances Stan
ford has a distinct advantage. In
the 3,000-meter steeplechase
sophomore Brian Zmijewski, the
state championships winner, and
junior Mark Fadil should easily
finish one-two ahead of Cal
senior Andy Bupp. At 5,000-
meters sophomore J.J. White
should continue to shine after his
14:02.87 run at last week's Penn
Relays, almost 20 seconds faster
than Cal's Mark Douglas. Junior
Rob Reeder and sophomore Greg
Jimmerson will also challenge
Douglas at the longest distance
on the track.
Stanford also possesses the
advantage in the throwing events
behind the amazing strength of
senior co-captain Dave Popejoy,

'Tighten your belt,
hold your breath
and pray.'

the 1994 Pacific 10 runner-up in
the hammer, senior Toby Nor
wood, freshman Adam Connolly
and sophomore Justin Strand.
The Cardinal should easily sweep
the hammer and the discus but
will hurt with loss of sophomore
Pete Swanson to a broken toe in
the shot-put.
The Cardinal's weakness for
both men and women is the
jumps where Cal has several
standouts.
The Stanford women should
contest closely the short sprints.
Relying on their distance
strength, they should dominate
most of the middle and distance
events. Freshman Sara Moore
and junior Dena Dey will control
the 800-meters, while sophomore
Monal Chokshi will feel the com
petition from Cal senior Lisa
Lopez, the State Champion in the
1,500 and 3,000 meters last
week.
Freshman Kortney Dun
scombe and freshman Sarna Ren
fro should provide many points in
the 3,000- and 5,000-meters after
a highly successive showing at
the Penn Relays. The relays are a
weak spot for the Cardinal but
with a good showing in the indi
vidual events the Cardinal should
be able to come away with the
win.
If Stanford performs at its
best, the team should come away
with the victory this Saturday.
"A close loss would not be sat
isfying," Lananna said.

Magness remains the primary
threat in the 800 and 1,500-
meter races. Magness boasts a 3
minute, 48.88 second best time in
the 1500 meters from last week's
State Championships. Fortu
nately, Stanford's Erik Spayde
ran 3:48.78 to take second place
at the Championships ahead of
Magness. Look for the 1500
meters to be a close, strategic
race from start to finish. Stan
ford boasts a strong group of run
ners who can all run under 3:50,
while Cal squarely lays its hopes
on Magness.
In the 800-meters Magness
has run 1:49.98, more than two
seconds faster than any of Stan
ford's runners. Cal's freshman
Ethan Taub beat Stanford senior
Dan McGinn by 0.5 seconds at
last week's championships.
McGinn and junior Joe Karl
gaard, who has run just as fast as
Taub this year, should be able to
take Taub to a photo-finish if
they run a strong race utilizing
their deeper 800-meter team
mates.

In the longer distances Stan
ford has a distinct advantage. In
the 3,000-meter steeplechase
sophomore Brian Zmijewski, the
state championships winner, and
junior Mark Fadil should easily
finish one-two ahead of Cal
senior Andy Bupp. At 5,000-
meters sophomore J.J. White
should continue to shine after his
14:02.87 run at last week's Penn
Relays, almost 20 seconds faster
than Cal's Mark Douglas. Junior
Rob Reeder and sophomore Greg
Jimmerson will also challenge
Douglas at the longest distance
on the track.
Stanford also possesses the
advantage in the throwing events
behind the amazing strength of
senior co-captain Dave Popejoy,

'Tighten your belt,
hold your breath
and pray.'

the 1994 Pacific 10 runner-up in
the hammer, senior Toby Nor
wood, freshman Adam Connolly
and sophomore Justin Strand.
The Cardinal should easily sweep
the hammer and the discus but
will hurt with loss of sophomore
Pete Swanson to a broken toe in
the shot-put.
The Cardinal's weakness for
both men and women is the
jumps where Cal has several
standouts.
The Stanford women should
contest closely the short sprints.
Relying on their distance
strength, they should dominate
most of the middle and distance
events. Freshman Sara Moore
and junior Dena Dey will control
the 800-meters, while sophomore
Monal Chokshi will feel the com
petition from Cal senior Lisa
Lopez, the State Champion in the
1,500 and 3,000 meters last
week.
Freshman Kortney Dun
scombe and freshman Sarna Ren
fro should provide many points in
the 3,000- and 5,000-meters after
a highly successive showing at
the Penn Relays. The relays are a
weak spot for the Cardinal but
with a good showing in the indi
vidual events the Cardinal should
be able to come away with the
win.
If Stanford performs at its
best, the team should come away
with the victory this Saturday.
"A close loss would not be sat
isfying," Lananna said.
Payton Jordan provided some
good advice to Lananna on how to
win the Big Meet: "Tighten your
belt, hold your breath and pray."
