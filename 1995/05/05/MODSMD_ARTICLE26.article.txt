## After losing 23 straight to Cal... Track hopes to end Big Streak 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
California. Weenies. You know,
the school that stole our Axe.
They're coming to Stanford Stadium
this Saturday. It's Big Meet time,
and the Stanford track team hopes to
come away with the victory in its last
dual meet of the season and the last
Big Meet ever at Stanford Stadium.
However, history is working
against the Cardinal men's squad.
Cal has won the last 23 of the annu
al meetings and boasts a 57-41-3
record in the 101 meets dating back
to 1893.
The Stanford women lead the
cross-bay series 8-7 in the 15 years
they hav'„ competed. Last year, the
Golden Bears barely won the meet at
Berkeley with a 73-72 victory.
"Every meet you want to win and
this is no different," said senior co
captain Tovi Abello. "But it is Cal
and I wouldn't say I wouldn't really
enjoy it if we won."
In fact this is a meet that holds
great importance not only for the
present team but also for alumni on
both sides of the Bay. At a press con
ference on Tuesday, former Stanford
coach Payton Jordan, the last coach
to beat Cal back in 1971, fondly
remembered the lore of the Big Meet.
"There was always something dif
ferent happening. Cal has always
been the Big Meet and today it still is
the Big Meet."
Senior co-captain Christy Boyd
spoke with another alumnus at the
track on Wednesday. Former U.S.
Senator Alan Cranston, a familiar
mainstay on the oval in his USA team
sweats spoke with Boyd giving her
encouragement as he remembered
his own Big Meet victory in the late
