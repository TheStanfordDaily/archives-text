# Ultimate to fight Banana Slugs UCSC just one of 20 foes at Western Regionals

"I had a dream the other night,"
said men's ultimate captain Andrei
Straumanis, "that we made it to the
finals at nationals and we were watch
ing Georgia and East Carolina in the
other semifinal game. I wanted Geor
gia to win because they were stronger
and I wanted to beat the stronger
team."
The Stanford ultimate teams travel
down to UC-Santa Cruz this Saturday
and Sunday, hoping to capture first or
second place in the Western Regional
and continue their dreams of getting
to and winning nationals. Twenty
teams from Washington, Oregon, Cali
fornia and Arizona will compete
against the Stanford clubs, including
powerhouse host UC-Santa Cruz.
Both the men's and women's teams
are relying on younger players to step
up and make significant contributions
this weekend. However, the two teams
have traveled different paths to get to

this point, and are not expected to
compete at the same level. The women
roll in ranked second in the nation to
the Banana Slugs, expecting a second
seed, whereas the men are ranked
ninth and should receive either the
third or fourth seed.
The women did not make it to
nationals last year, placing third in
their region, so they have a little extra
desire to make it this year.
"We expect to go to nationals," said
grad student Sharon Amick. "We just
need to execute."
They have played No. 1 Santa Cruz
three times this year, winning once
and losing twice, and hope to defeat
them a second time to even up the
score.
Last weekend, however, the
women's ultimate team had to do some
serious soul-searching. The Cardinal
suffered an upset loss to UC-Davis and
immediately afterwards were beaten
badly by Santa Cruz. Stanford hopes
the poor performance last weekend
will serve as a wake-up call for the

regional tournament.
"I think it's going to get us psyched
up for this weekend," grad student
Lena Ting said. "At times this season
we've gotten complacent, not finishing
strong, but what happened last week
end helps us know what we have to
do."
The men's ultimate team is on a dif
ferent track this year. After placing
second at nationals last year by losing
a controversial championship game to
East Carolina, the determined Cardi
nal has not performed at quite the
same level this year. Although still an
excellent team, Stanford is a definite
underdog.
Pushing a number of rookies to do
their best, it has been a year of
tremendous growth for the men.
"We thought it was going to be a
rebuilding year," grad student Strau
manis said, "but the rookies are play
ing like veterans, and if the veterans
play like gods, which they're supposed
to do under pressure, we can win
this tournament."
The underdog situation is an
unfamiliar one for a team that
has been dominant for the last
few years, but also makes victory
much sweeter.
"Last year was pretty easy,
and nationals was a given," said
co-captain Jesse Roach, a senior.
"It's less of a sure thing this
year. If we don't make it, it'll be
a disappointment but if we do,
it'll mean that much more."
Though not favored to con
tend for the championship, the
men have no plans to bow out
early. In fact, they expect to sur
prise everyone with a victory.
"We'll win, but it's not going
to be easy," Straumanis said.
"Our offense has been really con
sistent, and if we can create 10
turnovers per game, we'll win."
The women, too, have high
hopes of success.
"If we get mentally prepared
and psyched-up," Ting said, "and
just go out and have fun, we def
initely have the talent to win."
