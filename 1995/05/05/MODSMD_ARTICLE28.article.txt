# Golfers in the rough at Pac-10s, place 8th
## But Chang shines in place of Woods 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Continuing an awful Jekyll
and-Hyde act, the second-ranked
Stanford men's golfers showed
their very worst side at this week's
Pacific 10 championships in Rich
land, Wash.
The Cardinal was left in the
dust, finishing near the bottom of
the pack in eighth place and 54
strokes behind conference champi
on No. 9 Arizona State. Less than a
week after an inspiring comeback
gave Stanford the U.S. Intercolle
giate title at home, the team posted
its worst finish of the season.
"What can you say?" said head
coach Wally Goodwin. "We just did
not have it this week.
"Golf is a funny sport. It's not
likp a lot of other sports in that you
play great one week and not so
great the next. Even the very best
players in the world are like that so
of course, collegiate players will be
like that too."
For the defending national
champion Cardinal, it was just dif
ficult to get into the same kind of
zone that it experienced last week.
Even with an outstanding perfor
mance on a windy second day, the
team was unable to overcome bal
looning scores in the first and final

rounds.
"We just found ourselves in a
position where we were turning in
scores that we didn't want to
count. Most of the time we were
counting at least two really high
scores."
Almost the entire team was
prone to the slump. While senior
All-American William Yanagisawa
turned in a strong performance,
finishing sixth individually, fellow
senior Ail-Americans Notah Begay
111, Casey Martin and Steve Bur
dick struggled. Begay, who had
been unstoppable of late, finished
25th, with Martin and Burdick
placing 35th and 53rd respectively.
Senior Jerry Chang was one of
the few silver linings what was a
very cloudy day for the Cardinal.
As the No. 6 player on the squad,
he has been limited in his opportu
nities to compete with the varsity
squad. Yet, Chang fired a 297 to
place 20th, finishing behind only
Yanagisawa on the team.
"I think I had the same attitude
as a lot of the other Pac-10 teams,"
Chang said. "This was probably my
last collegiate competition, and so
while it was just another tourna
ment for the other guys, I was real
ly motivated to go out and go out
strong."
Chang and sophomore Conrad

Ray, who finished 56th, were
pushed into the fray after fresh
man starter Tiger Woods injured
his rotator cuff in last week's home
meet. The situation was only
aggravated by an atypical five
count-six scoring system at the
tournament, which called for
Goodwin to play six golfers as
opposed to the usual five.
"A lot of people would say that
Tiger'B loss hurt us pretty bad,"
Chang said, "but even if he had
been here we would have finished
low. The entire team has to per
form for us to succeed."

However, Stanford's misfor
tunes were not limited to its own
performance. The conference com
petition was especially sharp, due
in part to a number of teams on the
bubble to qualify for regional play.
"Our finish was really two
sided," Chang said. "It was a com
bination of a year when a lot of the
Pac-10 teams played well and just
us playing very average.
"We've already qualified for
regionals, so for us, it was a lot less
important, while for a lot of other
teams, it was a time to really grind
it out."
