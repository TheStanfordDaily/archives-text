# Lacrosse can win West
## 
### Julie Choe 
The season comes to an end for the
Stanford women's lacrosse team this
weekend, but not without a fifth trip to
the final four of the Western Women's
Lacrosse League. The Cardinal, seeded
No. 1 in the North, earned an automat
ic berth in the semifinals, where it will
meet Arizona, the second seed of the
South. Stanford expects to advance and
avenge its second-place finishes to a
tough UC-Davis team over the past two
years.
The Cardinal women own an untar
nished record of 9-0 in the Western
League and a respectable 18-5 finish
altogether. Their toughest match will
come against UC-Davis if the Aggies can
knock off UC-Santa Barbara in the
other semifinal. The Cardinal has

already defeated the Aggies twice earlier
this year.
"I think we have the ability to win ...
as long as we play our own game and not
worry about them," said Dara Kaplan.
The freshman attacker believes that the
long rivalry between the two Northern
California teams makes the game more
of a psychological battle.
Despite past frustration in their two
consecutive losses at the finals, head
coach Kay Cowperthwait believes that
the Stanford women can win it all.
There seems to be no question about the
improved Cardinal's skill level, but it all
could come down to who wins the mind
game under pressure.
