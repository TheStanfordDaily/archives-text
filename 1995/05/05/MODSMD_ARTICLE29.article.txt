# Lacrosse can win West
## 
### Julie Choe 
The season comes to an end for the
Stanford women's lacrosse team this
weekend, but not without a fifth trip to
the final four of the Western Women's
Lacrosse League. The Cardinal, seeded
No. 1 in the North, earned an automat
ic berth in the semifinals, where it will
meet Arizona, the second seed of the
South. Stanford expects to advance and
avenge its second-place finishes to a
tough UC-Davis team over the past two
years.
The Cardinal women own an untar
nished record of 9-0 in the Western
League and a respectable 18-5 finish
altogether. Their toughest match will
come against UC-Davis if the Aggies can
knock off UC-Santa Barbara in the
other semifinal. The Cardinal has

already defeated the Aggies twice earlier
this year.
"I think we have the ability to win ...
as long as we play our own game and not
worry about them," said Dara Kaplan.
The freshman attacker believes that the
long rivalry between the two Northern
California teams makes the game more
of a psychological battle.
Despite past frustration in their two
consecutive losses at the finals, head
coach Kay Cowperthwait believes that
the Stanford women can win it all.
There seems to be no question about the
improved Cardinal's skill level, but it all
could come down to who wins the mind
game under pressure.
Kaplan, junior attacker Wendy Kula
and junior defender Hannah Flatau
lead the way for the Cardinal,
along with a strong co-captain
duo of junior midfielder Peppie
Stephenson and senior goalkeep
er Emily Chang. Behind the play
of these stars and others, the
squad pasted Pacific in the final
game of its season two weeks ago
and earned the right to bypass
last weekend's qualifying tourna
ment. While others vied for the
chance to play this weekend, the
Cardinal was honing its skills
against a San Francisco club
team.
With a two-week layoff since
its last official game, the squad
has had plenty of time to focus on
the weekend. Regardless of the
outcome, a bright future lies
ahead for Stanford. The experi
enced squad will lose five seniors
this year, but the younger mem
bers of the team have shown that
they have the ability to step up to
the challenge in the future.
Although Cowperthwait will
be saddened by the loss of the
seniors, the season is not over
yet. And the Stanford women
hope for the chance to face their
old rival one more time. Davis
may have the home-field advan
tage, but the Cardinal women
have the talent to claim the
crown this year.
