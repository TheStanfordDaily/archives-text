## Three students intend to run for ASSU Senate chair 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Two senators-elect and the current Publi
cations Board director will run for senate
chair when the new ASSU Senate meets for
the first time Tuesday night.
Alane Murdock, the current senate secre
tary and a graduate senator-elect, said yes
terday that as senate chair she would move
the "real discussions" of the senate outside of
the formal meetings. There, she hopes that it
will be "easier to have a very full discourse on
things."
Her two opponents both began their
ASSU careers with the Publications Board.
Stephen Russell, an undergraduate senator
re-elected for a second term next year, served

last year as Publications Board director.
Danny Bressler was Russell's deputy direc
tor last year and is director this year.
Both Bressler and Russell agreed that as
senate chair they would strongly enforce the
ASSU Constitution and its bylaws. This
year, Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi and the
senate have been criticized for ignoring the
constitution.
"There is a tendency in the ASSU to take
the easy way out and ignore the constitution
in favor of legislative practicality," Russell
said.
A junior economics major, Russell said he
would push toward rearranging the struc
ture of the senate to eliminate "partisan
bickering" and restore the senate's
credibility among students.
"As senate chair, I would strictly
enforce the constitution, attempt to

make more senators aware of its
intricacies and encourage senators
to sign declarations affirming their
support of it and the bylaws," he
said.
Bressler, a junior science, tech
nology and society major, said the
tenet of a structured, ordered senate
is having members who "behave

themselves and have ordered meet
ings." As chair, he said he will make
constitutional decisions once and
not renege on them.
"You have to enforce the rules
equally for everyone," he said. "I
think a lot of people feel the same
way."
Murdock, who will be a cotermi

nal student in biology next year,
said the senate needs a cooperative
attitude in order to be productive. "I
can do that for the senate," she said.
"Hopefully, next year we can set
a definite standard for interpreta
tion, so senators and students can
have fair representation and full
knowledge of the rules," she said.
