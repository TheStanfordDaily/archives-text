Santa Clara 2 2

There's nothing quite like a
big inning to wake up some quiet
bats.
After being held scoreless in
game one, the Stanford softball
team (15-31 overall, 1-21 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) bounced
back with a four-rally in the
fourth inning of game two en
route to a 7-2 victory and a dou
bleheader split Wednesday at
Santa Clara.
"Our bats certainly came alive
[in game two]," Stanford coach
Sandy Pearce said. "We've been
hitting the ball hard for several
games, so it was nice to see us
bunch some hits together to score
some runs."
In game one, things looked as
if the offensive woes that have
plagued Stanford throughout its
inaugural journey through the
Pac-10 would continue to plague
the Cardinal in the non-confer
ence doubleheader. The Cardinal
managed only two hits in the
game, dropping a 2-0 decision to
the Broncos.
Stanford's inability to score
meant that a solid pitching per
formance by Angela Webb was
wasted. Webb, a sophomore from
Modesto, Calif., allowed only four
hits in six innings of work. The
Broncos scored single runs in the
home halves of the third and
sixth innings.
Jennifer Accord got the victory
for Santa Clara. She improved to
21-26 for the season. With the
loss, Webb fell to 7-24.
"She's a really good pitcher,"
Pearce said of Accord. "She's
very quick. She threw harder
than we're used to, and that
threw us off at first. Eventually
we started to hit the ball hard,
but our shots went right at peo
ple."
