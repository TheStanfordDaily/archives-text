Stanford 0 T'
Santa Clara 2 2

There's nothing quite like a
big inning to wake up some quiet
bats.
After being held scoreless in
game one, the Stanford softball
team (15-31 overall, 1-21 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) bounced
back with a four-rally in the
fourth inning of game two en
route to a 7-2 victory and a dou
bleheader split Wednesday at
Santa Clara.
"Our bats certainly came alive
[in game two]," Stanford coach
Sandy Pearce said. "We've been
hitting the ball hard for several
games, so it was nice to see us
bunch some hits together to score
some runs."
In game one, things looked as
if the offensive woes that have
plagued Stanford throughout its
inaugural journey through the
Pac-10 would continue to plague
the Cardinal in the non-confer
ence doubleheader. The Cardinal
managed only two hits in the
game, dropping a 2-0 decision to
the Broncos.
Stanford's inability to score
meant that a solid pitching per
formance by Angela Webb was
wasted. Webb, a sophomore from
Modesto, Calif., allowed only four
hits in six innings of work. The
Broncos scored single runs in the
home halves of the third and
sixth innings.
Jennifer Accord got the victory
for Santa Clara. She improved to
21-26 for the season. With the
loss, Webb fell to 7-24.
"She's a really good pitcher,"
Pearce said of Accord. "She's
very quick. She threw harder
than we're used to, and that
threw us off at first. Eventually
we started to hit the ball hard,
but our shots went right at peo
ple."

a Cardinal loss against powerhouse UCLA.
The Cardinal looked to change
its fortune immediately in game
two, scoring its first run of the
doubleheader in the top of the
first. The Broncos came back,
however, tying the game with a
run in the bottom of the second.
At this point, though, Stanford
took over. The Cardinal scored
twice in the third and four more
times in the top half of the fourth.
Hot-hitting junior left fielder
Amanda Renteria led the hitting

attack for Stanford, collecting
three hits, including a fourth
inning double, in the game.
Freshman third baseman Dawn
Kobata also doubled and had
three hits.
"1 Renteria and Kobatal really
hit the ball well," Pearce said.
"Amanda's been on a tear in the
last 15 games or so."
With the three hits Wednes
day, Renteria's batting average
improved to .340, second on the
team to junior shortstop Summer
Lee, whose .430 average ranks
fourth in the Pac-10 and 19th in
the nation.
Even more important than the

number of hits Stanford collected
was the clutch hitting the Cardi
nal registered during the third
and fourth inning rallies. Sopho
more right fielder Katie Beattie,
who had two hits in the game,
came through with three RBIs,
getting her hits at crucial
moments in the game. Senior
Karla Starr drove in two runs in
the fourth for Stanford.
For the game, the Cardinal
banged out 12 hits to produce
their seven runs. Webb pitched
well again in game two, limiting
the Broncos to five hits and two
runs. She improved to 8-24 with
the victory.

"I liked the run production,"
Pearce said. "What I really liked is
that we were able to score against
Accord when she came in [in the
fourthl. We were really glad she
came in, because she's a much
better test for Washington."
Stanford will get a chance to
test its offense on Saturday, as
the Cardinal travel to Seattle for a
1 p.m. doubleheader against the
20th-ranked Huskies.
Washington (43-20, 12-10 in
the Pac-10) is a solid squad that is
also on fire. Beginning with a dou
bleheader against Stanford at El
Camino Field on March 30, the
Huskies have won 20 of their last

26 games.
"They're a great team," Pearce
said of the Huskies. "They have
solid pitching and they can score a
lot of runs. Their record would be
even more impressive if they
didn't play in the Pac-10." All of
Washington's conference losses
have been against UCLA, Arizona
or California, all of whom are
ranked in the top 10.
Stopping Washington starts
with stopping Shelley Brown. The
Huskies' leading hitter smacked a
three-run homer in the second
game against Stanford, helping
her team to an 11-0 victory. In the
first game, the Cardinal hung

around for four innings, as fresh
man phenom Jessica Schulman
kept the Huskies quiet. In the
fifth, though, Washington broke
through for two runs. Five more
in the sixth and one run in the
seventh led to an 8-3 final score.
With Schulman unable to pitch
due to a stress fracture in her
back, the task is even more diffi
cult.
"It's always tough to go up
there and play," Pearce said.
"They have a great stadium with
lots of fans. The last time we
played them they were at the end
of a 10-game road trip, so it will be
a real challenge for us."
