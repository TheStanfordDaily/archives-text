# Lambert Cup, not the Axe, is Big Row prize
##

It may not be as well known as
its more-publicized cousin, but
the Lambert Cup still embodies
the same ongoing battle as the
Axe.
"It's the traditional race
against Cal," said Stanford men's
crew coach Wieslaw Kujda. "Each
team will feel the intensity of the
rivalry."
The Cardinal will battle for the
coveted cup tomorrow when it
makes the short trip over the Bay
and up Route 880 to the Oakland
Estuary, home course of the
Golden Bears. Races are sched
uled to begin at 11 a.m. To help
interested spectators reach the
event, a van will be leaving from
the Encina parking lot at 10 a.m.
Although Stanford's men's
squad (6-2 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) is currently ranked
fourth in the conference to Cali
fornia's (4-1) second-place rating,
Kujda is optimistic about his
squad's chances.
"We started very slow this sea
son," he said. "But each race,
we've progressively made up
more time on the boats that have
beaten us."
However, he wisely stops short
of making any guarantees.
"It will be a good, competitive
race," he said. "I can't predict

anything more than that, though.
"I think the team is just get
ting to the point where it wants to
be. This race will answer that
question."
Meanwhile, the women's varsi
ty boat (5-1), currently ranked
third in the conference behind
Washington and Washington
State, is favored over the fifth
place Golden Bears.
"I will be disappointed if we
don't win," said women's coach
Jocelyn McCandless, "but, as I've
seen before, anything can happen
in a race."
Like the men's team, the
women started the season slowly,
but have steadily improved. At
the Crew Classic in San Diego at
the beginning of the spring sea
son, the team's top boat finished
nine seconds off the Cougars'
time. Two weeks ago, on WSU's
home course, the rowers barely
lost as they were only a half-sec
ond behind.
The Cardinal women hope to
continue to improve tomorrow.
The young varsity boat, with five
sophomores, still has things to
learn and to prove. A win would
reclaim the Lambert Cup from
California, which has won Big
Row the past five years.
The Bears will defend the prize
vigorously, however, and they
have the estuary on their side.
California's home course is not
protected — it's in open water. As
a result, the wake of barges and
ships passing by and the generally
choppier waters of the Bay affect a
boat's course.
"This course is kind of tricky,"
Kujda said. "It's not a straight
course. They cannot set buoys to
mark the course because the
water is too rough."
Added McCandless : "There's
definitely more variables than
we'd like to see."
Traditionally, Cal has used this
to its advantage, especially at one
key point in the 2,000-meter race.
The Golden Bears know the spe
cial nature of their course and
have been known, at times, to use
this expertise to get away with
things they probably shouldn't
have.
"I can only stress to the refer
ees and to the Cal coaches that
they should watch out for this,"
Kujda said.
Cal's possible bending of the
rules is not something that should
worry the rowers, however.
"This is only a concern for
coaches, for me," Kujda said.
"They're [the rowers] going to go
do the job they've been learning to
do all year."
