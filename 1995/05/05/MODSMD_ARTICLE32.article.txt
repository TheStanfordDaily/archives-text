## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
The already sparking Stanford Athletic
Hall of Fame will add six new members in a
June 14 induction ceremony. Jennifer Azzi,
Kathy Jordan, Payton Jordan, James
Lofton, Ken Margerum and Kim Oden all
went on to illustrious careers after leaving
their mark on Stanford.
Lofton (Class of 1978) is a certain Pro
Football Hall of Famer in a few years. The
speedy Lofton, who also starred in track at
Stanford, owns the school record for touch
down receptions in a season with 12 in
1977, a year the Cardinal won the Sun
Bowl. In track, he set two Stanford records
that still stand, a 26 foot, 11 3/4 inch in the
long jump and a :20.5 time in the 200-meter
dash.
Lofton's speed and hands made him a
natural sixth overall pick in the NFL draft
for the Green Bay Packers, where he
enjoyed the best years of his 16-year career.
Lofton earned three AFC Championship
rings with the Buffalo Bills between 1990
and 1992, and holds the NFL record for
most career receiving yards with 14,004.
Azzi, a 1990 graduate, was the leader of
Stanford's first women's basketball nation

al championship team in her senior year. In
that year, she claimed the Naismith Award
as the best player in the nation. Azzi, a
great shooter, passer and defender, holds
the school mark for career three-pointers
with 191 and is second in assists and steals
behind Sonya Henning by the narrowest of
margins.
After graduation, Azzi earned gold
medals for the U.S. National Team at the
World University Games and Goodwill
Games in 1990. After playing professionally
in Europe, she now hopes to earn a spot on
the Senior National Team that will play in
the Olympics under Tara VanDerveer.
Margerum (Class of 1980) followed
Lofton as an All-American wide receiver in
1979 and 1980. His 30 career touchdowns
(all receiving) are still the Stanford career
record, and his 2,430 career receiving yards
were the Cardinal standard until Justin
Armour eclipsed the mark in his final game.
Margerum also hurdled for Stanford and
accompanied Lofton on the 400-meter relay
squad. As one of only five two-time first
team All-American football players in Stan
ford history, he played for the Chicago
Bears for six seasons, earning a Super Bowl
ring after the 1985 season, before closing
his career with San Francisco.

Oden (Class of 1986), was one of the top
volleyball players in the world in the 1980s.
The four-time All-American paced the Car
dinal to final four berths in every season for
Stanford and earned the Collegiate Player
of the Year her final two years.
She joined the U.S. National Team in
1986 and went on to become the Olympic
Team captain in 1988 and 1992. Oden has
also served as an assistant to current Stan
ford coach Don Shaw and played profession
ally overseas.
Kathy Jordan (Class of 1979) took home
four national tennis championships at
Stanford in 1978 and 1979, two in doubles,
one team and one in singles. After joining
the pro ranks, Jordan earned seven Grand
Slam doubles titles and achieved the rank
ing of fifth in the world — still the highest
ever for a Stanford woman.
Track coach Payton Jordan coached five
NCAA champions from 1956 to 1979,
including Lofton. Stanford also finished
second in the nation in 1963. He was the
head coach of the U.S. Olympians in 1968
when Bob Beamon established a 24-year
world record in the long jump. Jordan also
coordinated the U.S. vs. Soviet Union track
meets at Stanford Stadium during the
height of the Cold War.
