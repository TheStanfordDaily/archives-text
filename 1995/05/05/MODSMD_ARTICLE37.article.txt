# 'A Mid-spring-quarter Night's Dream'
## 
### 
1 recently had a dream which explained
everything. Here's how it went:
I'm sitting at my desk, doing an assignment
for CS001A: "How to Turn on Your Macintosh
Computer," when suddenly it occurs to me
that I had done my taxes on a solar powered
calculator on a cloudy day.
"Oh no," I exclaim. "They're going to make
me give back the Lion King stapler!" I begin to
sweat, which is bad because I'm wearing flan
nel boxers. A vague panic sweeps my room,
and then vacuums and does the laundry just to
be extra nice.
I begin to sense that someone very impor
tant is arriving. A soft wind blows. A bagpipe
plays 'Climb Every Mountain.' A red carpet
rolls out a joint.
And then he arrives.
He is tall and handsome, dressed in Hari
Krishna robes and a rather conservative tie.
He has ratty Safeway-shampoo-hair and lumi
nescent fingernails which change color when
ever I pronounce the words T or 'thesis.' His
voice is loud and ethereal and in his right hand
he holds a tortoise on a leash.
"Good day Mr. Michael. I bring a modest gift
for you, a little Prozac for the soul. Ask and I
shall answer. You have about four minutes."
At first I am frightened, but when I notice a
zit on his chin the fear subsides and I am able
to remember the great question: "Who the hell
are you and why haven't I manifested my
mutant powers yet?" I ask.
"I am the one sent to kibble your cortex and
you are already weird enough without
telekinesis. Call me Beatrice."
His knowledge of Second Temple Judaism
sets me at ease. "Why can nothing ever stay
the same?" I ask.
"Boredom became sublime only when God
ran out of things to do. Infinity is overrated
and stagnation is a waste of good nookie time.
If you want something that will remain forev
er go buy a box of Q-tips."
"Then show me Grace," I ask.
The scene instantly transforms into a pris

tine pasture empty of all things but the unend
ing green grass, a few hills and a bucket.
"But where is Grace?" I ask.
"She had an appointment. But do you not
see the wonder?"
I look around me and notice that, yes, it was
a rather pretty mountain range off in the dis
tance, even with all those damn nuns.
"But what of Complacency?" I ask.
"What?" Beatrice exclaims, "A boy with
your background wants to settle for ade
quate! Didn't your mother always leciure you
about raising things to their highest poten
tial?"
"Can we not get Oedipal today?"
"Watch it, I'm into spite." And in a perfect
rendition of my mother's voice he recounts,
"When a friend comes over to cry, always offer
them toilet paper, not tissues, for their tears.
For in elevating purpose we aid in the comple
tion of creation. Toilet paper spends it's entire
life wondering just when it's going to get cov
ered in poo. If it's an optimistic roll it can hope
to soak someone's snot. But for it to catch a
tear, the embodiment of our finer emotions, is
for it to transcend. Let nothing decrease in
holiness â€” an object should only be raised in
its use. A knife used for murder can later be
used to cut the noose, but a brothel can never
become a church."
"Okay mommy."
The landscape begins to swirl. The earth
becomes fluffy and I no longer feel my weight.
Several fruits walk past and complain about
not feeling fresh.
I cry out: "But how can I trust you? I can
not even trust my own thoughts. All of my
opinions fire formulated by disagreeing with
people. So how can I ever believe in you?"
"You can believe me," Beatrice says, now
using his own melodious voice, "because you
created me. Look, everyone constructs their
own realities. They decide for themselves
what is real and what is truth in their exis
tence. Since you invent your reality and I am
now a part of it, then A equals C and you
invented me. Whatever I say to you is really

of your own design. If you don't believe me,
ask my tortoise."
So I do. "What is the secret to Happiness?"
I ask.
The tortoise stands up on her aged hind
legs, looks me in the eye and belches in my
face.
"I see. She is most wise."
"Thank you," says the tortoise who then
transforms into a turtle for effect, "but I am
late. Flies to fry and lies to speak and miles to
go before I weep."
The turtle removes her collar and runs off.
"Don't leave," I call. "I need help. My mind
is aflutter."
"Fret not," says Beatrice placing a hand on
my rear. "My aunt Sylvia was a flutter and she
married a dentist. See, everything's works out
Fine in the end. Now lie down, it is time for you
to wake up."
I take a seat on a tree stump and acciden
tally sit on an camouflaged elf. Beatrice stands
before me, bows slightly and grants me (in
imperfect but charming iambic pentameter)
his sardonic apology:
"Gossamer tones and vermilion lies,
showing all things great then the great thing dies.
Who am I but to follow the command,
of the mighty wise from the godly land ?
At one of my peaks kind sirs/ma 'ams have seen
me behave what appears to be quite mean.
Cousins I have who'd have kinder been,
But fun, not charity, is this sprite's sin."
From his mouth he takes a wad of gum and
sticks it to my forehead. He high-fives me and
disappears.
"Wait! What of the Future?" I ask.
There is no answer. All I can hear is some
one laughing very loudly and the sound of an
elf begging me to get my ass off him.
