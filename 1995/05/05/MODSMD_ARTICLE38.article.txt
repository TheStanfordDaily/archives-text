## 2-hour chase ends with capture of 'Da Hoover Fellas' leader; a nation stunned 
### Josh Walker Editorial staff 
HOOVER TOWER, Calif.
George Shultz, former Secretary of
State and Distinguished Hoover
Fellow, was arrested late yesterday
evening on charges that allege him
to be the leader of the "Da Hoover
Fellas," a street gang that has been
terrorizing the Stanford communi
ty.
The two-hour chase across the
Stanford campus culminated at
Hoover Tower where a stunned
crowd of 50 onlookers stood in
silence as Shultz was carted away
by Stanford Police for a variety of
counts including charges of con
spiracy, defacing of property, and
resisting arrest.
Senior Research Fellows
Edward Teller and Milton Fried
man were brought in for question
ing about the incident. Police are
still searching for Joseph McNa
mara, former San Jose Police
Chief, who was seen leaving
Hoover Tower just moments
before police arrived.
Investigators allege Shultz is
the ringleader of Da Hoover Fellas,
a rag-tag group of distinguished
scholars and researchers that has
been linked to several major crimes
in the last six months. According to
insiders, members of Da Fellas
include Teller, Friedman, McNa
mara and several other Fellows
and their secretaries.
Hoover director John Raisian
refused to comment.
Stanford University Provost
and Hoover Fellow Condoleezza

Rice, in a press conference held just
one hour after the arrest, tried to
distance herself from Shultz,
claiming her ignoi ance of any of Da
Fellas alleged activities.
"To be completely honest," said
Rice in front of a bustling crowd
gathered on Stanford's main quad
rangle, "George always seemed to
be up to something from the start.
I le always told those creepy stories
around the water cooler. And, oh,
those sagging pants."
Shultz, who according to police
goes by the street name "Pigg
Pen," remained stone-faced and
silent as detectives led him to a
waiting patrol car. As the car
pulled away, small smatterings of
applause emerged from the law
enforcement officers gathered at
the scene.
"We got him," said Stanford
Police Deputy Jeff Bedly. "We
finally got him. And he ain't get
ting away. No doubt about that."
What comes as a large shock to
many at Stanford and the nation at
large comes as no real surprise to
the Stanford Police Department,
which has been working in con
junction with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation on this case since
last November.
According to police, in the past
two years a variety of graffiti has
appeared on various buildings on
the Stanford campus containing
obscene and violent slogans tagged
by Da Fellas, Pigg Pen and other
gang members.
It was not until last fall, though,
that links between the deface
ments and Hoover were made. For

weeks, employees of
the Visitor Informa
tion Service and the
Hoover Library had
been finding graffiti,
empty 9-mm bullet
shells, broken St. Ides
bottles and other
gang paraphernalia
scattered throughout
the main lobby and
the observation plat
form of Hoover
Tower. No signs of
break-in were evi
dent.
When police
received repeated
calls from students at
Stanford's Graduate
School of Business,
located across the
street from the tower,
complaining of loud
rap music being
blasted in the area,
many officers were
prepared for some
thing large. The FBI
was called for assis
tance.
"At first we just
ignored the calls, fig
uring they were just
grad students com
plaining," said Stan
ford Police Capt.

Raoul Niemeyer. "But when we
finally sent a patrol unit out, it was
determined that the music was
coming from the 11th floor of the
[Hoover] tower."
Final connections between
Shultz and Da Hoover Fellas were
not concrete, however, until sus
pects arrested for bike theft last
week confirmed Shultz's status of
gang leader.
According to suspects David
Andrew Aguliar and David Ray
mond Wright, both of Hayward,
California, they were hired out by
Shultz and Da Fellas to steal bikes
on the Stanford campus. When the
two men began having doubts
about their role in the gang, Shultz
reportedly threatened to "do
[them] in real good."
In a series of photos, the two
suspects identified Shultz as Pigg
Pen and pointed out several other
scholars.
These claims were all supported
by testimony provided by an inside
informant, referred to by police as
"The Admiral." The information
that this source provided ultimate
ly led to the arrest of Shultz.
After receiving a warrant for his
arrest at 5 p.m. Thursday, an all
points bulletin was released and
promptly responded to by Coffee
House security guard Steve
Janowitz. As Janowitz tried to stall
Shultz from leaving the building,
he said, the suspect doused him
with a double latte and ran.
This sparked the two-hour
chase, leading across campus,
through construction sites, into
the attic above University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's office and
through the steam tunnels below
Hoover Tower. Shultz was finally
ambushed on the 11th floor of the
tower, the apparent gang head
quarters.
After a brief scuffle that left
three officers with deep thigh and
shin contusions, Shultz was sub
dued.
Found at the scene were several
sets of Holiday Inn sheets and

bathrobes, 17 street signs, two bol
lards and what appeared to be a
mismatched set of dorm lounge
furniture. Various photos of Shultz
posing in his gang-banging gear
were recovered from the site and
released to the press.
Shultz was brought in on sever
al charges, including carrying a
concealed weapon, a switchblade
that was discovered hidden in his
sock garter.
"This is really just the tip of the
iceberg," said Niemeyer. "We've
connected Pigg Pen to over a dozen
crimes in the past few months."
According to unconfirmed
sources, Shultz is being questioned
regarding grand larceny, arson and
vandalism, as well as six outstand
ing parking tickets, mail fraud
relating to Columbia House
Records and public indecency in
possible connection to three local
exposure incidents.
"This should really close down
those Fellas thugs for sure," said
Deputy Bedly. "The people of Stan
ford can now be able to sleep safer
now that Pigg Pen has been taken
away."
Investigators are still on the
lookout for Shultz's car, a powder
blue late-model Lincoln with
hydraulics and polished gold trim,
hoping that what is found inside
will contain important clues to the
crime life of Shultz and Da Fellas.
Any information of the car's
whereabouts can be called into the
Stanford Police department.
The charges that Shultz faces
are an undeniable mar on a career
that has included many honors and
distinctions, including several fed
eral government positions and
numerous national and interna
tional awards. Sources say the
shock wave of this event has bewil
dered Washington. The White
House was not available for com
ment.
Former President Ronald Rea
gan, besieged by reporters at his
ranch last night, said that he sim
ply "did not recall" George Shultz.
