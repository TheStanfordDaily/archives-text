# Maples to host AIDS quilt, Meyer sponsors quilting bee

### Alda Leu 
This weekend Stanford students and fac
ulty members will prepare for the Universi
ty's largest-ever AIDS Memorial Quilt dis
play in Maples Pavilion.
Although the actual display will take place
from May 25-28, this weekend students from
dormitories and student organizations at
Stanford will participate in a campus-wide
quilting bee to sew panels for the Stanford
NAMES Project AIDS Quilt.
Meyer Library will host the quilting bee in
rooms 142 and 143 from noon until 5 p.m.
this Saturday and Sunday as well as next

weekend. The project received donations
from local fabric shops and will have sewing
machines available for the volunteers, said
sophomore Bess Kennedy, a Quilt Display
Committee member.
Participants will construct 6-by-3-foot
panels to mimic the size of coffins in memory
of those that have died from AIDS. These
panels will then be sewn into 12-by-12 foot
squares and sent to join the official quilt in
San Francisco, Kennedy said.
Parts of the quilt have visited Stanford in
the past — in the Jackson Library at the
Graduate School of Business last
year, for example — but this is
the biggest display ever at Stan
ford.
"There have been small displays
on campus but certainly nothing of
this size. This is the first organized
quilting bee on campus for this
cause," said committee member
Andrew Harker, a budget planner

at the Provost's Office.
The committee will sell T-shirts,
pins, bookbags and literature
about the AIDS Quilt in White
Plaza during the week preceding
the exhibit.
The project has also already
raised funds through a joint effort
with the Stanford Bookstore, sell
ing tickets for Bookstore discounts.
But the bulk of the almost $10,000
raised comes from donations from
the University's Faculty and Staff
Services, and Student Affairs
Offices.

The surplus money will go to
local AIDS organizations — Aris
in Santa Clara County and Ellipse
in San Mateo County, said Hark
er.
Started by Cleve Jones and
Mike Smith a decade ago, the first
complete exhibit of the AIDS
Memorial Quilt in Washington
D.C., spanned the area of 14 foot
ball fields in 1990. Since then, the
quilt has continued to grow.
This year, Stanford's display
will consist of 1,000 panels —
those made here at Stanford and

also those shipped from San Fran
cisco.
"My first experience with the
AIDS Memorial Quilt had been so
powerful that I wanted to share
that experience with the Stanford
community," said Kennedy, who
saw part of the quilt while in high
school.
The next scheduled presenta
tion of the complete AIDS Quilt
will occur in the fall of 1996 in
Washington, D.C. and will include
the panels made in the quilting
bees this weekend at Stanford.
