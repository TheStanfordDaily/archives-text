## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Gabe Lucas will not be returning next year
to serve his second term as ASSU financial
manager because he will be leaving Stanford
to take a job.
Lucas' sudden announcement leaves the
ASSU scrambling to find a replacement. The
next financial manager will be chosen by a
committee consisting of Lucas, one Council of
Presidents member, one undergraduate sena
tor and one graduate senator, Lucas said.
Lucas said he hopes to announce the choice
at next Tuesday's ASSU Senate meeting.
"I was presented with a great opportunity

to work with a firm," Lucas said. "The job
meets personal and family needs."
Lucas said he interviewed with the firm last
fall but did not expect the offer.
Certain personal family events, which made
it hard for him to stay at Stanford, strongly
influenced him to take the job, Lucas said.
"I definitely have mixed feelings about leav
ing," Lucas said, adding that serving again as
financial manager "would have been an oppor
tunity for me to move forward on long-term
projects such as space issues, develop new
business projects, strengthen the banking sys
tem and work on better education projects for
senators."
In order to make sure the new financial

manager has adequate knowledge of ASSU
financial procedures, Lucas said he will stay
an extra month past graduation to train the
person.
Lucas said he is confident that an accept
able replacement will be found.
Senators expressed regret at Lucas' depar
ture.
"Gabe is a great business manager who will
surely be missed," said undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell.
COP member Mork Murdock agreed. "Gabe
has done a fine job as financial manager and
he, more than any financial manager, has been
able to work with the business project side of
things," Murdock said.
