# Casper muses on the Farm's future

### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper used his annual State of the
University address yesterday to
discuss why Stanford attracts fac
ulty, staff and students and what
the role of the university should be
in the future.
At his speech before the Acade
mic Council yesterday in Kresge
Auditorium, Casper addressed the
university's place in society, espe
cially as improved technology de
creases the importance of the phys
ical school.
Now that such issues as the indi
rect-cost dispute with the federal
government — a suit which claimed
wrongdoing by Stanford in report
ing its overhead costs on research
— have been settled, Stanford is
"on course," Casper said.
"We are spending much less of
our time and energy in dealing with
problems of the past or reacting to
crises of the present and much
more in productively seizing the

day," Casper said.
But the relationship between
the University and the federal gov
ernment did not end with the indi
rect-cost settlement, Casper said.
"The budget pressures that all
governments feel undoubtedly
mean that we will face cutbacks in
the support of education and re
search and its infrastructure," he
said.
As government agencies like the
Department of Defense and the Na
tional Endowment for the Human
ities are cut, Casper said, "the cu
mulative impact on research-inten
sive universities could be devastat
ing without anybody intending
such a result."
"Institutions such as Stanford
are built over generations stone by
stone," he said. "They also can be
destroyed by removing stone after
stone until the edifice crumbles at
an accelerating pace.
"All of us — faculty, students
and staff — are in this together,"
