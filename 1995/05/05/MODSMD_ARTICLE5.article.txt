# Casper muses on the Farm's future

### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper used his annual State of the
University address yesterday to
discuss why Stanford attracts fac
ulty, staff and students and what
the role of the university should be
in the future.
At his speech before the Acade
mic Council yesterday in Kresge
Auditorium, Casper addressed the
university's place in society, espe
cially as improved technology de
creases the importance of the phys
ical school.
Now that such issues as the indi
rect-cost dispute with the federal
government — a suit which claimed
wrongdoing by Stanford in report
ing its overhead costs on research
— have been settled, Stanford is
"on course," Casper said.
"We are spending much less of
our time and energy in dealing with
problems of the past or reacting to
crises of the present and much
more in productively seizing the

day," Casper said.
But the relationship between
the University and the federal gov
ernment did not end with the indi
rect-cost settlement, Casper said.
"The budget pressures that all
governments feel undoubtedly
mean that we will face cutbacks in
the support of education and re
search and its infrastructure," he
said.
As government agencies like the
Department of Defense and the Na
tional Endowment for the Human
ities are cut, Casper said, "the cu
mulative impact on research-inten
sive universities could be devastat
ing without anybody intending
such a result."
"Institutions such as Stanford
are built over generations stone by
stone," he said. "They also can be
destroyed by removing stone after
stone until the edifice crumbles at
an accelerating pace.
"All of us — faculty, students
and staff — are in this together,"
Casper added. "We are going to get
nowhere if we rely on university
presidents and provosts alone to
get the word out [about the impor
tance of universities]."
This year, Stanford has shown
its commitment by discussing and
implementing recommendations of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education, which released a
report last October outlining sug
gested changes in the distribution
requirements, science, cultures
and language courses, as well as in
other areas, Casper said.
Stanford is attractive because of
"the creativity represented by
these efforts and much more," he
said. "One of the distinguishing
features of Stanford is its pioneer
ing spirit, its passion for ideas,
innovation and entrepreneurship.
"While ivy can be found on cam
pus, it is not the dominant plant,"
he added.
People come to Stanford,
Casper said, because of the excel
lence of its faculty, students, staff
and setting. This excellence will be
what continues the tradition of
universities as technology makes
"virtual" learning more accessible,
he said.
Progress means "software pro
ducers may well become competi
tors of universities," he said.
Casper said universities play a
variety of important roles in the
areas of education and professional
training: credentialing its gradu
ates for the workforce, social inte
gration, providing a rite of passage,
networking, knowledge assess
ment and creation, selecting of aca

demic elites, fostering a worldwide
community of scholars and trans
ferring knowledge.
But as important as the univer
sity is in its current form, the world
is changing and higher education
must follow suit, Casper said.
"Let us remember that the
world may need us, but it does not
owe us anything," he said. "Unless
we make the case for our work in
its entirety and pursue it rigorous

ly and efficiently, the world may
tire of us and develop new
approaches that it will consider
adequate substitutes, even though
they may not be adequate in fact."
Despite all technological
advances, Casper said, "the univer
sity as a physical space will remain
attractive to the extent that we will
make it more valuable to people to
interact personally and face-to-face
in learning and research."
