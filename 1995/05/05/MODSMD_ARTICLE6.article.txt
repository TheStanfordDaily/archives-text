# Mahood to assume Fac Sen chair in '96
## Senate also hears report on science core 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
received an interim report from
the committee charged with de
signing a three-quarter core se
quence to teach science, engineer
ing and mathematics principles to
nontechnical majors.
Initially proposed by the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, the core sequence would
give students an alternative to
separately fulfilling natural sci
ences, technology and applied sci
ence and mathematics distribu
tion requirements.
In addition to the committee's
report, English Prof. John Ben
der, the vice chair of the senate,
announced the results of this
year's organizational elections.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood will
serve as Faculty Senate chair next
year.
Mahood gained prominence

last year when, as chair of the sen
ate's Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, she
spearheaded a movement to
toughen Stanford's grading poli
cy.
Last June, the senate approved
a new grading policy based on rec
ommendations from Mahood's
committee. The national media
quickly latched onto the policy
change as an emblem of wide
spread frustration with grade in
flation at the nation's top univer
sities.
The senate received an interim
report on the science core design
committee's progress from com
mittee chair Brad Osgood, profes
sor of mathematics.
Osgood said current plans pro
vide for three science core tracks.
In addition to introducing stu
dents to general scientific con
cepts, each track will include a
laboratory component, a discus
sion of mathematical principles
and their applications and an
introduction to the use of comput
ers and technology as tools for
learning and research.
The goal of the core, Osgood
said, is "for students to have a
serious encounter with the pro
cess of engineering, mathematics
and science."
The commission's report,
which was released last October,
stated that "few non-scientists

are drawn to the kinds of courses
required for science majors;
instead they usually fulfill Areas
4, 5 and 6 with courses specifical
ly designed to attract non-special
ists."
However, Osgood said new
data from the Registrar's Office
seem to contradict that claim.
"The statements are ... in the
aggregate, false," Osgood said.
Osgood presented figures on
860 humanities, languages and
literature, social sciences and
interdisciplinary majors who
entered Stanford in 1991.
The data indicate that 65
percent of the students fulfilled
the mathematics DR by taking a

calculus class; 34 percent ful
filled the technology and
applied science DR with com
puter science 105 or 106; and 33
percent fulfilled the natural sci
ences DR with Chemistry 31, 32
or 33.
Osgood urged further study to
determine whether nontechnical
majors take additional science
and mathematics courses after
they fulfill the DRs and when in
their academic careers those stu
dents take scientific courses.
Chemistry Prof. Michael Fayer
stressed that even if most stu
dents do not deliberately seek out
easy nontechnical courses, the
science core should consider that

there are some students who do.
"It's those people who want to
take the easy way out who I want
to reach the most" with the sci
ence core, Fayer said. As such,
Fayer said, it might be wise to
eliminate "the softer courses"
from the list which fulfill the sci
ence DRs.
Chemistry Prof. John Brau
man also warned that the science
core might not be as attractive to
some nontechnical majors who
take courses in technical fields as
preprofessional preparation.
For instance, Brauman said, a
human biology major might take
chemistry because he plans to go
to medical school.
