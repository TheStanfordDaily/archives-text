# Austin teaches Native American law

Justice Raymond Austin had intend
ed to go to graduate school in psychology
and work in clinical psychology. But, he
said, "I fell on law accidentally."
Austin usually walked past the law
school at Arizona State University, but
one day a friend convinced him to take
the mock LSAT being held for minorities
that weekend. He ended up applying to
three law schools that day and getting
unanimously accepted. When he did not
get into any graduate psychology pro
grams, his fate was sealed.
Now an associate justice on the Nava
jo Nations Supreme Court and a judge
on the Arizona Court of Appeals, Austin
is working toward a greater understand
ing and respect for Native American legal
issues at Stanford.
A graduate from the law school at the
University of New Mexico-Albuquerque,
Austin is now a Herman Phleger Distin
guished Visiting Professor at Stanford,
teaching Native American Common Law
and Legal Institutions.
"I'm satisfied. It's been a great oppor
tunity," Austin said. "I've done a lot for
Indian tribes, which I probably would
not have done had I been in psychology."
His class focuses on federal Native
American law, federal government poli
cy, tribal, state and federal relation
ships and traditional law, as well as on
an awareness of Native American cul
ture.
"He teaches from a Navajo perspec
tive," said Hilary Tompkins, a second
year law student taking the class.
Stanford decided to offer Austin's

class because of the strong interest
among students. "Students originally
developed this class," said Yvonne Yazz
ie, faculty secretary of the Law School.
There were not enough written materi
als for a course reader, so students sup
plemented the class with speakers, one of

whom was Austin, who made a very
strong impression at the time, Yazzie
added.
Professionally, the course is impor
tant for someone working in Native
American law. "It also enlightens the

about an area of law that's been
ignored by legal educators," Tomp
kins noted.
Austin agreed: "It is important
to have courses on federal Indian
law, because practicing law any
where in the country, you will prob
ably deal with an issue involving
Indian law at least once."
One of Austin's goals in teaching
is to give students an understand
ing about Native American tribal
culture, he said. Students can then
take this knowledge to address
issues upon entering society.
"There is a lack of awareness of
Indian issues, especially in the way
federal courts handle criminal and
civil jurisdiction," he added.
Currently, whether jurisdiction
of a case belongs to the tribal, state
or federal courts depends on where
the crime was committed and the
race of the parties involved. But
"jurisdiction should be looked at
geographically. A tribe should have
complete power within its bound
ary," advocated Austin. "This will
eliminate confusion."
Austin cited historical prece
dent for this system, saying the
Europeans once dealt with tribes
on a nation-to-nation basis. "And
tribes are mentioned in the Consti
tution as separate nations," he
added.
Austin also championed the
recent return of the Native Ameri
can peace-making system.
In this system, "someone wise,
with knowledge of the traditions
and laws" serves as the peacemak
er. The involved parties, their rela
tives and the community attend the
trial and try to "get to the root of
the problem," he said. During the
ensuing discussion, anyone can
offer a solution. Usually, those with
knowledge offer teachings and
advice.
"There is an atmosphere of
respect, friendliness and peaceful
ness. There are no judges, lawyers,

procedures or appeals. It's inexpen
sive and much more effective,"
Austin said.
Unlike the adversarial system,
which tends to split the communi
ty, the peace-making system leaves
the community intact, emphasized
Austin. "The ultimate goal is har
mony."
There is opposition from the fed
eral courts and non-Native Ameri
cans to this system and to giving
tribes complete jurisdiction. "It's a
matter of ignorance. People are
scared of alien situations," Austin
said. "A lot of people have no idea
that there are still Indian tribes in
this country — not like the Indians
they see in the movies."
Education is the remedy, he
added, and much progress has
already been made — including in
Austin's class — which will hold a
peace-making demonstration on
Tuesday.
There are also more Native
American lawyers and more edu
cated Native American people who
can bring these issues to discus
sion. They are learning to work
within the American system and to
influence congressmen, Austin
added.
After his professorship ends in
June, Austin said he plans to go
back to his job in Window Rock,
Ariz., and sit on the Arizona Court
of Appeals. He also wants to bol
ster available law literature by
writing on Native American com
mon law.
Austin added that he does not
rule out teaching again, though he
admits that it takes a great deal of
work, "especially preparing and
making sure people understand
what you're talking about."
Austin served on the Indian
Legal Programs Committee at Ari
zona State University Law School,
assisting in fund raising, incorpo
rating Native American legal
issues, recruiting and retaining
Indian students and setting policy.
He has also taught courses at the
National Indian Justice Center in
Arizona and lobbied in Washington,
D.C., on behalf of Native American
issues.
