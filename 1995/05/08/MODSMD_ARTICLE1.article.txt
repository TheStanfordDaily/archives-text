# 50 years after victory
## Veterans remember V-E Day 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Fifty years ago today, World War II ended in Eu
rope. Not even half a century, however, is enough
to fade the memories of the people — including
some Stanford faculty — who risked their lives to
preserve America's most treasured values, democ
racy and freedom.
Though eventual American victory was obvious
near the end of the war, V-E Day brought incredi
ble excitement to the soldiers who had fought for its
arrival.
Hoover Senior Fellow Peter Duignan, who was
stationed in the South Pacific in the 40th Infantry
Division of the U.S. Army, said he felt "great relief
nnd great satisfaction."
"We ran around a bonfire naked in the rain," he
said.
Sociology Prof. Joseph Berger was stationed
near Paris. He remembers Paris being dark
throughout the war, but on V-E Day,"the whole
city was ablaze."
"It was one of the most memorable nights of my
life," Berger said. "People were dancing, singing,
hugging. Everything was lit up."
Perhaps such excitement arose because of the
tremendous confidence the soldiers had in their
cause.
"I felt the war was fully justified," said Hoover
Senior Fellow IxnvisGann. Gann was born Ludwig
Ganz i 11 Germany, but moved to England at the age
of 14 and changed his name. He was stationed with
the British Army in West Berlin during the war and
served as an interpreter.
"Guilty feelings didn't exist. I have met few peo
ple who have had any guilty feelings on that score,"
he said.
Berger contrasted the sentiments of World War
II veterans with those of the Vietnam vets. "It is so

a >nzing to hear the Vietnam vets
a id the terrible feelings they have
about that war," he said. "I have
none of those feelings. Germany
was a nationalist, racist state that
was engulfing Europe.
I was absolutely convinced
that it was a necessary war and a
just war. Fifty years later, I think
it was a necessary and a just war,"
Berger said.
The soldiers didn't realize just
how important their cause was
while fighting, as they didn't learn
of Hitler's concentration camps
until after the war.
"We didn't know about the tor
tures. It was all rumors — no pic
tures," said Duignan. "The first
real insights were after the war
when the U.S. Army occupied the
death camps and sent newsreels
back every week."
"None of us realized the scale of
destruction," said Gann, whose
Jewish family members were all
killed.
Buffer, who is Jewish, recently

went to Auschwitz to try to find
out anything he could about his
parents, who were killed there.
"There was little to find," he said.
"It was a horrendous experi
ence for me," Berger said. "There
were suitcases with names of peo
ple piled up. There were eyeglass
es, dolls, the ovens.
"It was painful, but then I
knew it was possible that people
could do that. They could dehu
manize others. That's a rather
important lesson to have," he said.
Berger's parents were from the
Warsaw ghetto. "I walked the
streets and tried to get in touch
with my feelings," he said. "It was
like closing a loop with my past."
Besides ending the mass
killings in the camps, the Allies'
victory over Hitler had other great
efTects. Berger called World War II
the "single most defining event of
the 20th Century."
It led to the Truman Doctrine,
the Marshall Plan, the notion of
containment of communism, the
Cold War and NATO, according to
Berger.
The men agreed that the victo
ry was also a tremendous boost for
the American ego. "Americans

emerged from the war thinking,
'We are on top.' It was a surge of
self-confidence," said Gann.
"World War II was really the
defining period for the United
States," Duignan said.
"We came of age and assumed
control of the free world. We no
longer felt backwards to Europe.
For the first time, American
artists came to dominate high cul
ture," he said.
Some of the racism in the Unit
ed States also came to an end fol
lowing the victory, according to
Duignan. "'Hyphenated Ameri
cans' gained new legitimacy and
new respect," he said. "They
broke the monopoly of the
WASPs."
Duignan gave the examples
of Japanese Americans and
Catholics. "They were empowered
by their moral service in World
War II,"he said.
Though the war resulted in
serious and dramatic changes for
the entire world, the men involved
said they actually had fun during
the war.
"It isn't regarded as kosher to
say I enjoyed myself in the war,
but a lot of people did," said Gann.

He attributes some of his fun to
the fact that he met his wife, Rita,
while stationed in Berlin.
"It was kind of fun," agreed
Duignan. "It was like an extended
walk in the tropics."
"I got to meet and throw
pineapples at Gen. Mac Arthur,"
Duignan said.
Mac Arthur landed near Duig
nan's group and asked Duignan to
get some pineapples for him. Duig
nan agreed, before realizing that
pineapples were out of season.
After finally finding eight
pineapples, he made it back to
the site just in time to see
Mac Arthur's bomber making its
way down the runway for take
off. Duignan, an athlete in
school, threw the pineapples like
footballs to Mac Arthur waiting
in the bomber's door. ''1 think I
got at least two in," said Duig
nan.
Though Berger said he felt
frustrated that his poor eyesight
blocked him from becoming a
fighter pilot, he still felt satisfac
tion from serving in the war. "I
felt very proud," he said. "And I
worked very hard. I felt a sense
of pride that I was a part of this."
