# Construction set to start on science quad

Construction on the first phase
of the new Science and Engineer
ing Quad is set to begin the week of
May 22 — just seven months after
Stanford alumni William Hewlett
and David Packard donated $77.4
million to help fund the $108 mil
lion project.
Phase one of the new project
involves the conversion of the
western part of Serra Street
between Lomita Drive and Cam
pus Drive — into a landscaped
mall and the construction of new
utilities to support the new quad,
said Michael Kuntz, a civil engi
neer with Facilities Operations.
Construction for the first phase
is scheduled to be completed Jan.
1, 1996, in time for the opening of
the Gates Information Sciences
Building and the Center for Inte
grated Systems, Kuntz said.
The new Serra Street mall will
feature broad pedestrian sidewalks
with granite curbs like those on
Palm Drive and a separate area for
bicycles, said Jeffrey Tumlin, a
manager for Transportation Pro
grams.
In addition, the mall will fea
ture hydraulic bollards that can be
raised and lowered to permit access
for emergency vehicles and Mar
guerite shuttles. A number of trees
will also be planted.

The construction of the Serra
Street mall will result in the loss of
about 35 parking spaces.
Transportation Programs is
also planning to expand its Mar
guerite shuttle service next fall to
compensate for lost parking.
Tumlin said details of the new
schedule are still being finalized.
The purpose of the new mall is
to "separate bicyclists and pedes
trians for the safety of both" and
to "basically try to add order to the
whole situation," Kuntz said.
The mall will serve "as a model
for bicycle-transit corridors.... If
this works, we are envisioning
expanding it around campus,"
Kuntz added.
Kuntz. said the conversion of
the Serra Street mall was "going to
happen anyway" even before
Hewlett and Packard made their
donation. The plans for the new
quad resulted in only a few minor
modifications to the mall.
However, he said the new plans
resulted in doubling the utilities
project. Phase one calls for the
replacement of outdated utilities,
improvements to existing utilities
and the construction of new utili
ties — electrical, gas, water,
chilled water, steam lines and
sewer lines — to support the new
quad.
The total cost of the first phase
of construction is just over $3 mil
lion.
