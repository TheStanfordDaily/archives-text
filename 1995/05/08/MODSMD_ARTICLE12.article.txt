# Black women discuss bigotry at Stanford
## 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
As a child in Nigeria sophomore Ije Ude had
always been told of the bigotry in the United
States.
It was not until this year, however, that her
apprehensions were confirmed. Last quarter
when Ude was on her way to an evening study
group she stumbled into the wrong dorm.
Ude was trying to get to Synergy House but
got lost behind the maze of Row houses. When
Ude realized her error she knocked on the closest
door and asked a resident if she was at Synergy.
Ude vividly recalls the animosity of his
response. "He told me that I was not at Synergy
and he said, 'This isn't the front door either' and
mumbled 'black bitch'. "
Although Ude was angry and resentful, she
said she was not shocked. "I've never really felt
welcome at this campus," she said. "I've always
felt like I have to defend myself."
Ude said the problems she faces as a black
woman at Stanford are similar to those obstacles
that black women face throughout the United
States.
"If it was just because I was a woman he
wouldn't have said 'black bitch'; he would have
just said bitch," Ude said. "And if a black guy
was at the door I wonder if he would have said
anything at all. He might have felt afraid to say
it to a black man. But because I am a woman he
felt he could call me a black bitch."
As a black female, Ude said she feels twice as
vulnerable to discrimination and abuse. Ude is
certain, however, that racism is more pro
nounced than sexism in her life — and her cer
tainty is reinforced every day.
"If someone is black it seems like their abili
ties are questioned to see if they belong here,"

Ude said. "But if you are white no one questions
you about your SAT score or your GPA; they
assume you belong here."
Recent trends against affirmative action have
only served to perpetuate the stereotype that
minorities are less qualified for higher educa
tion, sophomore ReShon Anderson said.
"One of my teachers assumed that I got into
this school because of affirmative action, and
that really offended me," Anderson said.
Like most black women, Anderson said the
discrimination in her life can be attributed to her
race and not to her gender. "When I'm in a class
room the first thing people will notice about me
is not that I'm a woman, but that I'm black,"
Anderson said. "I could dress up and look like a
boy, but I'm still black."
According to Anderson, black people expect to
encounter racism on a predominately white
campus like Stanford. She assumes that there is
tension when she enters a classroom of white
people.
"I have been called so many hate names, nig
ger-this and nigger-that, and have been infuriat
ed," Anderson said. "It is terrible, because if I
call the police and say someone called me a nig
ger, all they are going to do is say 'shut up nig
ger' because they do the same thing."
The "in-your-face" racism that Anderson
describes was something Krystal Evans encoun
tered every day in her hometown of Memphis.
"At home I hear racist remarks all the time.
I've learned to turn my ear from it," Evans said.
"When I'm at home I have to be constantly
aware of the fact that I'm black. I'm black before
I am anything. I have to be on my guard both
here and there."
Sometimes Evans is careless enough to let
her guard down. But not for long. "I can get
sucked into believing that everyone is cool with

the diversity thing here so that when I am chal
lenged with a racist comment or a racist person,
I don't know how to react," Evans said.
Kim Thompson has not been forced to deal
with the kind of blatant racism that Evans
describes. She explains that her race and her
gender have almost always been an advantage
for her. In jobs, college applications and other
programs she finds she often has an advantage
because she is a black woman.
Thompson stresses that her outlook would be
entirely different if she was not raised in Seattle.
Her optimism is partially due to her admitted
inability to recognize the "behind your back"
racism that she says is prevalent in the North
west.
Thompson said she does not like to think of
herself in racial terms. Instead, she asserts that
she has not come across what she would call dis
crimination at Stanford.
It is the subtle discrimination that eludes
detection which freshman Janelle Thompson
said she finds troubling.
"There is always discrimination, but it is
sometimes difficult to identify its faces," she
said. "It is assuming you go in the lower
trigonometry class. It does not have to be a bla
tant incident."
Of course, there is a danger of becoming
desensitized to discrimination. Janelle Thomp
son said that she is afraid that she has become
accustomed to racism since it has surrounded
her for so long. Yet she emphasizes that it is
important to recognize and expose prejudice in
order to eradicate it.
"Now that people grow older and are more
educated I hope that people will not seek out dif
ferences so much," she said, pausing. "But of
course, they will. They simply learn to hide it bet
ter."
