# Panel questions roles of art in today's society
## 
### Samuel Park Staff writer 
With the role of art increasing
ly questioned in America, the
issue of public funding for the
arts versus the artist's right of
self-expression was debated at
Kresge Auditorium on Saturday
afternoon.
A quiet crowd of about 45 peo
ple listened as the panel of
lawyers and public figures grap
pled with the many concerns
raised by exhibiting art in public
places.
One such concern is often com
munity reaction to an exhibit.
"Communities can often articu
late important interests in limit
ing and even in censoring art . . .

in the interest of morality, of pro
tecting children or of preventing
violence," said moderator Erwin
Chemerinsky, a law professor at
USC. "This often collides with the
rights of individual artists to
express themselves."
The panel was part of a lawsuit
settlement between the City of
Menlo Park and Brazilian artist
Zoravia Bettiol. Bettiol sued the
city last year when the city hall
removed two of her woodcuts
after a clerical worker complained
that the works were a form of sex
ual harassment. The works
depicted nude figures, some in
sexual poses.
"For me it's a very strange sit
uation to find here in the United
States in a democratic time at the

last century," said Bettiol, pre
senting an artist's point of view at
the symposium. "What we have to
censor and fight against is Rwan
da and Bosnia massacres."
Panelist Lawrence E. Stone,
assessor of Santa Clara County,
defended the city's side of the
issue.
"For a publicly funded project,
you can't be on the leading edge.
The government is inevitably dif
ferent from a private patron,"
Stone said. "Artists don't have an
inherent right to be supported by
the public.
"It is appropriate for con
stituents to question how much is
being spent, what is the purpose
and intent of the project and to
consider the taste and standards

of the community" where the
work is presented, Stone later
added.
Another panelist, litigator
Fred Blum, also defended the
city's point of view, saying that a
community has a right to decide
what images become attached to
its public places.
"The city is the ultimate con
sumer, and it has the right to take
I the work) down, though maybe it
shouldn't," Blum said.
Bettiol's response was that the
artist's feelings should be respect
ed.
"We have to have more oppor
tunities to reflect together and
find out the reason why this soci
ety is so rooted in repressive
morality," Bettiol said.
