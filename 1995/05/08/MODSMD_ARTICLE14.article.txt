## US to keep ties with Russia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With Republican lead
ers demanding a hard line against Russia, Presi
dent Clinton pledged yesterday to nurture ties
with Moscow despite its plans to sell nuclear
goods to Iran. "Crises come and go," he said. "But
interests endure."
The conciliatory remarks came after the GOP
leadership, warning that U.S. aid to Russia could
be jeopardized over the nuclear issue, told Clinton
to stand Firm in his summit talks.
"Your job wasn't to go to Russia to make
Yeltsin happy," House Speaker Newt Gingrich
told the president via television.
On the eve of his four-day trip to Russia and
the Ukraine, Clinton again denounced "the tragic
war" in the republic of Chechnya and warned that
Moscow's plans to sell Iran nuclear technology
and equipment could give atomic weapons to an
unstable neighbor.
"If this sale goes forward, Russian national

security can only be weakened in the long run,"
Clinton said in remarks prepared for delivery to
the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a
pro-Israeli lobby.
Still, the president said the U.S.-Russian rela
tionship is mature enough to withstand differ
ences. ''The interests of Uie American people are
best served by supporting Russia's transition to a
more free and open society," Clinton said.
"We must not hold our relationship hostage to
any one issue," he said.
Gingrich and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas said failure by Moscow to drop the
pending nuclear deal could prompt Congress to
cut foreign aid to Russia.
The administration and Congress view Iran as
a terrorist nation that cannot be trusted with a
nuclear arsenal. Officials expect Clinton to share
with Yeltsin classified information about Iran's
nuclear weapons effort.
