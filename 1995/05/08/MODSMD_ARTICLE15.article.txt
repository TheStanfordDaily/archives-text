# Serbs kill eight, destroy churches

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) — Shells fired by rebel
Serbs slammed into a Sarajevo
suburb yesterday, killing at least
eight people and injuring up to 40
others near a tunnel that is a life
line for the besieged capital.
Serb fighters also blew up two
Roman Catholic churches in
northern Bosnia and tried to set
fire to another as part of an appar
ent reprisal campaign for a suc
cessful offensive against Serbs in
neighboring Croatia last week.
The attack on Butmir — a key
government-held suburb outside
the Serb siege lines — was the

worst in the Sarajevo area since 68
people died in the shelling of a
downtown market on Feb. 5, 1994.
Mortar shells hit near the
entrance to the tunnel, which runs
under the Sarajevo airport. The
tunnel is used to bring food and
supplies to Sarajevo when Serbs
shut off the U.N. airlift and the
one remaining road. The govern
ment army also uses it to move sol
diers and guns.
The Kosevo Hospital morgue
received the bodies of a woman
and seven men. U.N. officials said
they had confirmed 11 wounded,
although all area hospitals had not

been checked. Prime Minister
Haris Silajdzic told The Associated
Press that 40 people were wound
ed.
Most of those killed were wear
ing army uniforms, said a U.N.
spokesman, Maj. Pierre Chavancy.
The United Nations wasn't per
mitted to examine the site of the
blast and it was not immediately
known if the tunnel was damaged.
Chavancy said the shell was
fired from a Serb position. Serbs
denied responsibility, as they have
in connection with the deadliest
previous mortar attacks in Saraje
vo.
