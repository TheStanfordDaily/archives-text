PARIS (AP) — Jacques Chirac,
the conservative mayor of Paris,
finally won France's presidency in
his third attempt, defeating Lionel
Jospin in a runoff election yester
day to end 14 years of Socialist
rule.
The right already controls 80
percent of the seats in parliament
and Chirac's victory gives conser
vatives their first chance since
1981 to exercise full control over
foreign and domestic policy.
"I will be the president of all
French people," Chirac declared in
his victory speech. "I know the dif
ficulty of the task that awaits us."
Jospin congratulated Chirac,
wished him good luck and said his
supporters had helped launch the
troubled Socialist Party back on
the road to recovery.

With all votes counted except
for overseas possessions, Chirac
led Jospin 52.7 percent to 47.3 per
cent.
Jospin had narrowed a large
deficit in the polls in recent days,
creating suspense in the battle to
succeed Francois Mitterrand,
France's longest-serving president.
The Socialist Mitterrand, 78
and ailing with prostate cancer, is
expected to step down in about a
week after 14 years in office. He
sent telegrams congratulating
Chirac and thanking Jospin for "a
campaign of force and hope."
Champagne corks popped in
Chirac headquarters, and support
ers erupted into a chorus of "La
Marseillaise," the national
anthem, when the projections were
flashed onto TV screens. Later,

tens of thousands of revelers flood
ed into the Place de la Concorde,
waving flags and splashing in
floodlit fountains as honking horns
echoed throughout Paris.
President Clinton congratulat
ed Chirac in a message relayed by
the U.S. Embassy in Paris, accord
ing to a statement read by presi
dential spokesman Mike McCun-y.
Alain Juppe, the foreign minis
ter expected to become Chirac's
prime minister, said the winner
prevailed through "courage and
tenacity," after trailing badly just
three months ago behind conserva
tive Premier Edouard Balladur.
Chirac, mayor of Paris for 18
years and twice a prime minister,
had lost in the first round in 1981
and was beaten by Mitterrand in
the runoff in 1988.
