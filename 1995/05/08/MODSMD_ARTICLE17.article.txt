Fatal twister strikes
DALLAS (AP) â€” A tornado that barreled
through the Texas Panhandle yesterday snatched
a man from the front porch of his trailer and
dropped his hody 130 feet away, raising the state's
death toll from a string of powerful storms to 17.
The twister skipped through a rural area near
Amarillo, touching down at least three times with
in eight miles. It destroyed eight mobile homes,
heavily damaged three houses and seriously
injured four people, officials said.
Airport gunfight
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A man firing an

assault-style rifle was wounded yesterday in a
gunfight with police at Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport.
The man began firing into the air when a guard
kept him from entering a restricted area through an
exit-only door, Airport Police Chief James Welna said.
Police chased him to the baggage claim area,
where he fired more than 20 shots from what
looked like an automatic weapon in an exchange
of fire with three officers.
The gunman was wounded when the battle
moved outside the terminal.
Suspect David DeMatthew, 28, was in serious
condition with wounds in his hip and shoulder,
Welna said.
