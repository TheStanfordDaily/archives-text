Stanford should respond
to requests and improve
its investment policy

STANFORD IS COMMITTED
to investing responsibly in
rhetoric; now the University
should take measures to put its
words into practice.
In a meeting last week with the
University's Advisory Panel on
Investment Responsibility, Students
for Environmental Action at Stan
ford requested that Stanford's
Board of Trustees vote in favor of a
proxy resolution at Texaco's annual
shareholders meeting encouraging
the corporation to improve its
human rights record.
Texaco is one of the few American
corporations to invest in Burma,
which has been ruled by a nightmar
ish military regime for over 30
years. The Burmese government's
"environmental and human rights
abuses are among the worst on the
planet" according to Atossa Soltani
of Rainforest Action Network.
Texaco also spent over 20 years
damaging Ecuadorian rain forests
while exploring for oil and has left
behind a plethora of toxic waste sites
upon ending its operations there.
These factors and others have led to
Texaco being named one of the top
10 polluters in the country by the
Council on Economic Priorities.
The advisory panel has already
started to look into the Texaco
shareholder resolution, but Stan
ford Management Company Manag
ing Director Harry Turner said he
did not believe the Board of Trustees
Special Committee for Investment
Responsibility (which makes all
final decisions) would have time to
meet to discuss the shareholder res
olution before the today's vote.
Still, the advisory panel's recep
tiveness and cooperation are to be
highly commended. For the first
time ever, students are involved in
researching investment responsibili
ty issues, and the APIR has already
begun investigating Unocal, another

company that invests in Burma, to
prepare for proxy resolutions at its
annual shareholder meeting later
this month. However, recent events
show that the University's invest
ment responsibility policy has room
for improvement.
For one thing, the University's
short-term decision-making process
on investment responsibility issues
should be improved, so that quick
decisions can be made when neces
sary. However, as the parties respon
sible for ensuring that Stanford
invest responsibly, the APIR and the
SCIR should have already been
aware of and considering the Texaco
shareholder resolution before being
notified by SEAS, and should be bet
ter prepared when future issues
arise.
Stanford's examination of its
investments should not end with
Texaco or Unocal, but should be an
ongoing process. Stanford should
request access to records on corpora
tions' environmental and social per
formances from environmentally
and socially responsible mutual
funds and other sources, and com
pile its own resource base from
which to evaluate corporations.
In evaluating its investment poli
cy, Stanford should consider the fact
that many environmentally and
socially responsible investment
funds often outperform mutual
funds which are not concerned with
responsible investing. The reason
behind this is that companies which
are forward-looking enough to
invest in cleaner, more modern tech
nologies and research and develop
ment are those which will prosper in
the long term, especially as environ
mental regulations inevitably stiff
en. Unethical corporations are also
often punished in the marketplace
by increasingly informed con
sumers.
Perhaps investing more responsi
bly will actually improve the perfor
mance of Stanford's endowment
funds. Even if it doesn't, however,
the University as a whole will have a
much clearer conscience.
And that cannot be measured in
monetary terms.
