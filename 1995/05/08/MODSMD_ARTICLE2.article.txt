# Compared to some schools, TAs happy

Graduate student teaching assistants may
not be thrilled about the increase in section
sizes announced by the School of Humanities
and Sciences two weeks ago.
But unlike graduate students at a number
of universities across the country who are
striking to gain union status to secure fair
wages and workloads, most Stanford TAs see
their jobs as more than the sum of their pay
checks and say they have no plans to unionize.
"As a graduate student TA I'm afforded
the opportunity to come to school here and to
fund my education," said Sanford Dickert, a
sixth-year graduate student in electrical engi
neering who has been a TA for 19 quarters.
"To get into Stanford in the first place is a
unique opportunity. We then have the oppor
tunity to earn money as TAs," Dickert added.
Over the past three years, California's UC
system has been the scene of a series of battles
between graduate student employees and the
UC administration. TAs, research assistants,
readers and tutors have organized strikes at
UC-Berkeley, UCLA and UCSD to win formal
recognition of graduate student groups as of
ficial collective bargaining units with the
power to negotiate contracts.
Their goal is to join public universities like
the University of Michigan and the Universi
ty of Oregon which already have union agree
ments with their graduate student employ
ees.
Graduate student concerns at public uni
versities have included benefits, class size,
grievance procedures and the openness of job
postings, said Susan Shepler, a fifth-year
graduate student at UC-Berkeley and the fi
nancial secretary of the school's Association
of Graduate Student Employees (AGSE).
AGSE staged a six-week strike during au
tumn semester of 1992. Although the admin

istration still refused to recognize the stu
dents as a union body, Shepler said, the strike
"spurred organization at other UC campus
es."

Public universities are
not the only ones experienc
ing the backlash ofgraduate
students fearful for their
stipends and other benefits.
As universities across the
country tighten their belts,
TAs at private institutions
have begun to worry about
the security of their finan
cial aid and have set out to
win union status.

Only last month, graduate students at Yale
University organized to boycott classes for a
week to protest the administration's persis
tent refusal to acknowledge Yale's Graduate
Employee Student Organization as a union.
And TAs at different universities have
been communicating by electronic mail to dis
cuss the issues they face, said Erin Sawyer, a
second-year religious studies graduate stu
dent at Stanford.
"A lot of decisions are made without the
consultation of the TAs," said Sawyer. "It
might be nice to get some representation."
But unionizing takes a lot of cooperation
among students, she said.
Students or part-time employees?
Being a graduate student these days, espe
cially a doctoral student, poses all of the tradi
tional intellectual challenges of graduate stu
dent life â€” but with additional financial con
cerns as well as uncertainty about future job
prospects, said Assoc. Dean of Graduate Poli
cy George Dekker.
