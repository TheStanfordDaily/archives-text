# Compared to some schools, TAs happy

Graduate student teaching assistants may
not be thrilled about the increase in section
sizes announced by the School of Humanities
and Sciences two weeks ago.
But unlike graduate students at a number
of universities across the country who are
striking to gain union status to secure fair
wages and workloads, most Stanford TAs see
their jobs as more than the sum of their pay
checks and say they have no plans to unionize.
"As a graduate student TA I'm afforded
the opportunity to come to school here and to
fund my education," said Sanford Dickert, a
sixth-year graduate student in electrical engi
neering who has been a TA for 19 quarters.
"To get into Stanford in the first place is a
unique opportunity. We then have the oppor
tunity to earn money as TAs," Dickert added.
Over the past three years, California's UC
system has been the scene of a series of battles
between graduate student employees and the
UC administration. TAs, research assistants,
readers and tutors have organized strikes at
UC-Berkeley, UCLA and UCSD to win formal
recognition of graduate student groups as of
ficial collective bargaining units with the
power to negotiate contracts.
Their goal is to join public universities like
the University of Michigan and the Universi
ty of Oregon which already have union agree
ments with their graduate student employ
ees.
Graduate student concerns at public uni
versities have included benefits, class size,
grievance procedures and the openness of job
postings, said Susan Shepler, a fifth-year
graduate student at UC-Berkeley and the fi
nancial secretary of the school's Association
of Graduate Student Employees (AGSE).
AGSE staged a six-week strike during au
tumn semester of 1992. Although the admin

istration still refused to recognize the stu
dents as a union body, Shepler said, the strike
"spurred organization at other UC campus
es."

Public universities are
not the only ones experienc
ing the backlash ofgraduate
students fearful for their
stipends and other benefits.
As universities across the
country tighten their belts,
TAs at private institutions
have begun to worry about
the security of their finan
cial aid and have set out to
win union status.

Only last month, graduate students at Yale
University organized to boycott classes for a
week to protest the administration's persis
tent refusal to acknowledge Yale's Graduate
Employee Student Organization as a union.
And TAs at different universities have
been communicating by electronic mail to dis
cuss the issues they face, said Erin Sawyer, a
second-year religious studies graduate stu
dent at Stanford.
"A lot of decisions are made without the
consultation of the TAs," said Sawyer. "It
might be nice to get some representation."
But unionizing takes a lot of cooperation
among students, she said.
Students or part-time employees?
Being a graduate student these days, espe
cially a doctoral student, poses all of the tradi
tional intellectual challenges of graduate stu
dent life — but with additional financial con
cerns as well as uncertainty about future job
prospects, said Assoc. Dean of Graduate Poli
cy George Dekker.
"The feeling of being closed-in financially


Dekker
is stronger today. It's true here lat
Stanford] and it's true every
where else," Dekker said.
Stipends for TAs at Stanford
vary across five classifications
based on the number of hours the
student will work as well as the
duties to be undertaken, Dekker
said.
TAs working an average of 20
hours per week this year were
awarded $3,838 per quarter in
addition to a nine-unit tuition
remission.
The cost of living for a single
student on campus was estimated
to be approximately $2,973 for
three months of rent, food and
modest personal expenses,
according to the Financial Aids
Office.
At Yale, graduate students this
year were awarded anywhere

from $1,380 per semester for a 15-
hour work week to $4,830 for a
17.5-hour week, according to the
graduate student handbook. In
addition to the stipends, all gradu
ate students are awarded tuition
fellowships of $19,000, said Jonas
Zdanys, associate dean of Yale's
Graduate School.
Dekker and Zdanys noted that
graduate student TAs and
research assistants are in a nebu
lous category, since they are both
students and part-time employ
ees.
Looking at the stipends as a
source of income, it is easy to
conclude that the graduate stu
dents are badly underpaid,
Dekker said. "However, it must
also be seen as financial aid for a
program that is bound for a high
degree which will qualify them
for an above-average paying
career," he added.
The debate over whether
teaching and research assistants
could organize as unions came

before the National Labor Rela
tions Board as early as 1974,
when the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists (SURP) peti
tioned to unionize.
"Some of them were working
for professors on long-term pro
jects and might have thought that
the professors were keeping them
too long," recalled Physics Prof.
Emeritus Arthur Schawlow, who
was the acting chair of the
Physics Department that year
when SURP presented the peti
tion.
However, after the NLRB
ruled that "the research assis
tants are not employees of an
employer, but students who
receive pay for their research
work as a form of financial assis
tance," SURP fizzled out.
'They're missing the point'
Today, Stanford's graduate
students appear to have no inten
tion of unionizing.
"There has not been any talk

of any |TA unionizing efforts)
going on, as far as I've heard,"
said Paul Abramson, president of
Stanford's Graduate Student
Association.
"A TA union at Stanford would
simply be unnecessary. We have
our own TA organization and I
think it functions very well. We
have grievance procedures of dif
ferent sorts," said Robert McMil
lan, a third-year graduate student
in economics.
In the Economics Department,
a head TA assigns the others to
sections. If any problems arise —
"if we're overworked, if we have
problematic students, if there's
tension with the professors" —
the TAs go to the head TA to fig
ure out how to deal with the situ
ation, McMillan said.
"It's like a union but without
the adversarial baggage that goes
along with unions," he added, not
ing that graduate student unions
could increase the tension
between graduate students and

their departments' faculty and
staff.
The protesters at Yale are
"missing the point," said Kara
Buckley, a fourth-year Stanford
graduate student in political sci
ence, commenting on Yale's strik
ing graduate students. "We are
compensated for our work. I don't
feel neglected."
The stipends themselves are
"enough to live on," said Dickert.
Although the stipends do not
allow for many luxuries, the antic
ipated benefits in the long run
make students more willing to
accept some limitations now, he
said.
Knowing that "sometimes it
hurts," Dickert works two jobs
during the summer in order to
have some savings to dip into dur
ing the academic year.
Moreover, the compensation is
not limited to the stipend itself,
said Buckley. The experience to be
gained as a TA is a benefit in
itself, she said.

country tighten their belts,
TAs at private institutions
have begun to worry about
the security of their finan
cial aid and have set out to
win union status.

Only last month, graduate students at Yale
University organized to boycott classes for a
week to protest the administration's persis
tent refusal to acknowledge Yale's Graduate
Employee Student Organization as a union.
And TAs at different universities have
been communicating by electronic mail to dis
cuss the issues they face, said Erin Sawyer, a
second-year religious studies graduate stu
dent at Stanford.
"A lot of decisions are made without the
consultation of the TAs," said Sawyer. "It
might be nice to get some representation."
But unionizing takes a lot of cooperation
among students, she said.
Students or part-time employees?
Being a graduate student these days, espe
cially a doctoral student, poses all of the tradi
tional intellectual challenges of graduate stu
dent life — but with additional financial con
cerns as well as uncertainty about future job
prospects, said Assoc. Dean of Graduate Poli
cy George Dekker.
"The feeling of being closed-in financially

is stronger today. It's true here lat
Stanford] and it's true every
where else," Dekker said.
Stipends for TAs at Stanford
vary across five classifications
based on the number of hours the
student will work as well as the
duties to be undertaken, Dekker
said.
TAs working an average of 20
hours per week this year were
awarded $3,838 per quarter in
addition to a nine-unit tuition
remission.
The cost of living for a single
student on campus was estimated
to be approximately $2,973 for
three months of rent, food and
modest personal expenses,
according to the Financial Aids
Office.
At Yale, graduate students this
year were awarded anywhere

from $1,380 per semester for a 15-
hour work week to $4,830 for a
17.5-hour week, according to the
graduate student handbook. In
addition to the stipends, all gradu
ate students are awarded tuition
fellowships of $19,000, said Jonas
Zdanys, associate dean of Yale's
Graduate School.
Dekker and Zdanys noted that
graduate student TAs and
research assistants are in a nebu
lous category, since they are both
students and part-time employ
ees.
Looking at the stipends as a
source of income, it is easy to
conclude that the graduate stu
dents are badly underpaid,
Dekker said. "However, it must
also be seen as financial aid for a
program that is bound for a high
degree which will qualify them
for an above-average paying
career," he added.
The debate over whether
teaching and research assistants
could organize as unions came

before the National Labor Rela
tions Board as early as 1974,
when the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists (SURP) peti
tioned to unionize.
"Some of them were working
for professors on long-term pro
jects and might have thought that
the professors were keeping them
too long," recalled Physics Prof.
Emeritus Arthur Schawlow, who
was the acting chair of the
Physics Department that year
when SURP presented the peti
tion.
However, after the NLRB
ruled that "the research assis
tants are not employees of an
employer, but students who
receive pay for their research
work as a form of financial assis
tance," SURP fizzled out.
'They're missing the point'
Today, Stanford's graduate
students appear to have no inten
tion of unionizing.
"There has not been any talk

of any |TA unionizing efforts)
going on, as far as I've heard,"
said Paul Abramson, president of
Stanford's Graduate Student
Association.
"A TA union at Stanford would
simply be unnecessary. We have
our own TA organization and I
think it functions very well. We
have grievance procedures of dif
ferent sorts," said Robert McMil
lan, a third-year graduate student
in economics.
In the Economics Department,
a head TA assigns the others to
sections. If any problems arise —
"if we're overworked, if we have
problematic students, if there's
tension with the professors" —
the TAs go to the head TA to fig
ure out how to deal with the situ
ation, McMillan said.
"It's like a union but without
the adversarial baggage that goes
along with unions," he added, not
ing that graduate student unions
could increase the tension
between graduate students and

their departments' faculty and
staff.
The protesters at Yale are
"missing the point," said Kara
Buckley, a fourth-year Stanford
graduate student in political sci
ence, commenting on Yale's strik
ing graduate students. "We are
compensated for our work. I don't
feel neglected."
The stipends themselves are
"enough to live on," said Dickert.
Although the stipends do not
allow for many luxuries, the antic
ipated benefits in the long run
make students more willing to
accept some limitations now, he
said.
Knowing that "sometimes it
hurts," Dickert works two jobs
during the summer in order to
have some savings to dip into dur
ing the academic year.
Moreover, the compensation is
not limited to the stipend itself,
said Buckley. The experience to be
gained as a TA is a benefit in
itself, she said.
