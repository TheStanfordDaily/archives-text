## Listening to our conscience 
### 
IN A WORLD where injustice prevails
because a few fail to think of others,
change lies in the hands of those who
rise up to act with conscience. Stanford
now has a unique opportunity to catalyze
change, not with its academic prowess or
intellectual knowledge, but with its
money.
In an effort to turn a profit on our
endowment fund, we have invested $5.9
million in Texaco and $3.4 million in Uno
cal, two multinational oil corporations
who operate in Burma. In their endeavors
to make money for themselves and share
holders like Stanford, these two compa
nies have supported a military dictator
ship and plundered the tropical rain
forests.
Since 1962, the State I-aw and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC), a brutal
military dictatorship, has controlled
Burma. The SLORC allowed free elections
in 1990, but failed to recognize the 84 per
cent victory of Nobel Peace Prize winner
Aung San Suu Kyi and the pro-democracy
opposition party. Since then, the SLORC
has turned to exploiting Burma's natural
resources to finance its oppressive regime.
Oil companies such as Texaco and Unocal
fund 65 percent of the regime's budget.
Stanford must summon the courage to
stand up for environmental and social jus
tice and use its millions to speak to Unocal
and Texaco, for the Burmese forests and
citizens cannot.
Stanford must be willing to put finan

cial windfall aside and instead place the
restoration of environmental responsibili
ty and democracy as a higher priority. It is
time that our university — recognized
around the world as a leader in challeng
ing old ideas and asserting new thoughts
— show these multinational corporations
and other large investors that we won't
stand for seeking a profit with no regard
for the long term impact on the planet or
its people.
We cannot afford to be morally compla
cent on issues such as these. Silence and
inaction slowly breed acceptance. And in
this case, our tacit transfer of money
finances large-scale destruction and
oppression. Criticism and protest would
not come slowly if Stanford itself were
directly clear-cutting invaluable forests or
stealing the political voice from people.
For some tragic reason, we allow moral
obligation to disappear when we are indi
rectly involved a half a world away.
Given this trend and the slow-moving
processes in an institution such as Stan
ford, change does not come easily. Bureau
cracies are resistant to changing course
and progressing in a new direction. Just as
we cannot allow financial profit to keep us
from confronting these corporations, we
cannot let the status-quo seduce us away
from voicing what we know to be right and
true. The issue is on the table. Our invest
ment is exposed. Let us do something.
And when we do decide to walk the
walk, let us not get disheartened by the

small voice Stanford has in multi-billion
dollar entities such as Texaco and Unocal.
Widespread change explodes when small
actors realize that trend is not destiny.
Stanford is in a position to shape a new
discourse and movement for environmen
tally responsible investment. We must
join with others like the City of Berkeley,
the University of Washington and the City
of Seattle in vowing not to support any
activities which oppress the Burmese peo
ple or devastate their natural environ
ment.
Only by acting with social conscience
on issues such as these can we hope to
mend the systemic failure which facili
tates the activities of multinationals such
as these. Until the price at the gas pump
reflects the true cost of deforesting land
and stealing from future generations, we
must actively protest. If ever there was an
opportunity to think globally and act local
ly, this is it. We cannot afford to oppress
our social conscience in a way not unlike
how the SLORC stifles democracy in
Burma. In choosing our investments, we
must let our hearts guide us.

Aaron encourages anyone interested in
working on a campaign to make Stanford
a more responsible investor to join Stu
dents for Environmental Action at Stan
ford on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. in the Sequoia
Room of Tresidder Union.
