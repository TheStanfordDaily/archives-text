Stanford should consider environment when developing

STANFORD ALUMNUS Derek C.
Oppen's May 3 letter to The Daily is
very appropriate in questioning
Stanford's lack of concern on how its
development impacts the natural environ
ment. Our campus is growing at what
seems like an unstoppable rate, with new
buildings erected every year.
It is very refreshing to see our alumni
demand that Stanford take responsibility
for its development actions. We have seen
generous Stanford alumni donate to cre
ate, sustain and improve teaching,
research and residential facilities. Thus
they have an enormous power to mandate
certain aspects of their buildings' pro
gramming. Obviously, from an environ
mentalist's viewpoint, the ideal solution to
preventing the destruction of land would
be to halt any further development, as Mr.
Oppen suggested. And we agree. However,
in some cases development may be neces
sary to strengthen a university's capacity
to provide resources. Energy and environ

mental conservation does not necessarily
mean that we have to mandate technologi
cal regression. Hence, we would like to
offer other suggestions.
First, we would like to chsillenge all
alums who fund the construction of a
future Stanford building to demand that
it be designed and built in an environmen
tally responsible manner. The structure
should be energy efficient with as much
natural daylighting, natural ventilation
and natural heating and cooling as possi
ble, thereby reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. Any demolition or wastes gen
erated during construction should be recy
cled if possible instead of taking up landfill
space. Today, sustainably harvested, non
toxic, recycled / recyclable materials are
easily accessible and have proven to be
good for construction. Therefore, when we
say that buildings at Stanford should be
environmentally sound, we mean that
they should have as little impact on the
natural environment as possible.

Second, we would like to encourage
current Stanford students to make their
voices heard and demand the same
regarding their classrooms, buildings and
dormitories. Shouldn't students have a
say about their environment, be it built or
natural?
Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford has been collaborating with the
Utilities, Planning, and Project Manage
ment departments to create the Stanford
Energy & Environment Forum (SEEF) to
be held today. The mission of SEEF is to
drive us to continuously enhance the
environmental soundness and energy effi
ciency of Stanford by providing an ongo
ing exchange of information about energy
and the environment between all mem
bers of the Stanford community (stu
dents, faculty, and administration). An
expressed goal of SEEF is to provide a
forum in which the students' voices are
easily heard, and also to encourage mem
bers of the Stanford community to inte-

grate energy and environmental consider
ations into all decision-making processes.
This first SEEF will focus on integrating
environmentally sound architecture into
a university setting. The guest speaker,
Alan Short, is a British architect
renowned for his innovative energy-effi
cient and environmentally conscious
designs.
Stanford does not have to go as far as
canceling all of its plans for development
(although that would be the most effective
solution to preserve precious land). Our
vision is to have all future construction at
Stanford go "green." If Stanford can inte
grate this goal into their Facilities Design
Standards and into all their planning deci
sions, then we can be proud of our univer
sity for its commitment to protecting the
environment.
