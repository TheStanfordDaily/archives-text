# Editorial shouldn't have told students to withhold gifts over the procession
## 
### 
In its editorial on the issue of the pro
cession at Commencement The Daily called
upon fellow students to threaten to with
hold financial contributions to the Univer
sity forever if the administration does not
concede the students' right to have such a
procession, and to make of it the circus
that it has become in recent years.
Back — way back — when I was presi
dent, the threat to withhold contributions
was usually made by alumni who were
angered by student behavior on campus. It
might be considered refreshing to see the
roles so neatly reversed, to see this weary
old weapon being wielded by the young
against the values of the old, for a change. I
should perhaps warn you, that back then
when we examined the giving record of
alumni who made such threats, we often

found that they were folks who had never
given anything to Stanford anyhow.
Without entering into the merits of the
case for or against the God-given right to
hold Frisbee contests and enjoy water
slides during the Commencement proces
sion, one question does occur to this read
er, however: Is there any issue that would
be, in The Daily's editorial judgment, too
trivial to warrant your invoking this ulti
mate weapon of disgruntled graduates, the
threat to deny all further support of your
University? For if it is, as The Daily main
tains, your Commencement, surely it is
also your University.
