# Political economy breeds willingness to be ignorant
## 
### 
I just wanted to say thanks for printing
Romesh Ratnesar's piece on "politics of
meaning." Being a DSA supporter and

early reader of Tikkun, I sadly missed the
Cornel West-Michael Lerner appearance at
Printer's Inc. However, I suspect Mr. Rat
nesar's thoughtful words more than cap
tured the heart of the discussion. I would
only add that not only does our political
economy reward and nurture selfishness,
materialism and intemperance â€” it also
breeds a willingness to be ignorant. It is
heartening to know that another person
has not sacrificed his ability to reason and
to empathize.
