# Competing in Pac-10 is very different from playing in Ivy League

As a Stanford athlete I would like to
respond to Larry Beyer's assertion (Letters
to the Editor, May 3) that athletic units
give athletes an undeserved special break.

First of all, athletic units do not satisfy any
of the major or DR requirements that all
students must fulfill to receive a diploma
By granting athletes, many of whom
receive little or no athletic financial aid,
this token number of units (12 over four
years), the University allows athletes to
earn credit that can keep them above the
12 unit per quarter minimum should ath
letic pressures necessitate dropping a class.
Although such a system is not needed at
Harvard, the athletic pressures, demands,
and expectations on Harvard athletes do
not come close to those of Stanford ath
letes. There is a little more effort, pressure
and sacrifice involved in repeating as
national champions, or even being competi
tive in the Pac-10 than in competing for
country club bragging rights at the Har
vard-Yale game. Surely one unit a quarter
is not too generous a gift to the Stanford
athletes, who carry on the most successful
athletic tradition in the NCAA
