## Track says farewell to Stadium but not to Big Skid Late rally gives Cal men 24th in a row over Cardinal; women also fall 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
The meet had all the suspense of a
great drama. The California Golden
Bear track team came across the bay to
confront Stanford at home on a Satur
day set to highlight over a century of
track and field between the two schools.
In the last scene of the fourth act of this
drama, Cal had the final word, winning
86-77 on the men's side and 75-70 over
the Cardinal women.
"There's nothing for us to be disap
pointed about," said senior co-captain
Christy Body. "I mean we're disappoint
ed we lost, but there's nothing to be
ashamed of because we did the best that
we could."
For the men, it was the 24th consecu
tive loss going back to 1971.
"Nine points just breaks your heart.
There was great coaching and great
effort by the athletes on both sides," said
Payton Jordan, the last Stanford coach
to defeat Cal's men. After the meet he
told the team, "You lost, but you didn't
lose because you gave 110 percent."
The meet started auspiciously at high
noon. The sun found its way out of the
clouds and Stanford found itself off to an
early lead on both the men's and
women's sides. Up at Angell Field,
senior co-captain Dave Popejoy took con
trol of the hammer throw with a 231-1
throw for a Big Meet and school record.
The throw was the third best in the
nation in 1995 and the sixth best ever in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
Senior Toby Norwood followed Pope
joy with a throw of 207 feet to take sec
ond. Cal's Travis Nutter ruined the
sweep as he took third place ahead of
sophomore Justin Strand and stand out
freshman Adam Connolly.
Meanwhile, down in the stadium
Cal's long jumpers swept the event
behind Pac-10 leader Lee Adkins, who
jumped 23-10 3/4 for first place. Stan
ford junior Jami Webb and sophomore
Brian Manning missed third place by a
little more than an inch, a foreshadow
ing of the Cardinal's day to come.
"The enthusiasm was there all the
way," Manning said. "In the back of our
minds, given the history, we knew that

we'd have to try our hardest to beat Cal.
There were a lot of disappointments like
my performance in the long jump, but
it's a lot better losing when you know
you did your best."
The women gained an early lead after
freshman Sami Jo Small's win in the
javelin and freshman Kortney Dun
scombe's first place finish to lead a Car
dinal sweep in the 5,000 meters. The
score between the two bitter rivals
changed several times throughout the
day, and Stanford depended on its
strength in the middle and distance
events to counter Cal's performances in
the weight events and the jumps.
Sophomore Monal Chokshi effectively
neutralized Cal's Lisa Lopez, a double
champion in the 1,500 and 3,000 meters
at the state championships a week ago.
Chokshi and junior co-captain Dena Dey
led a one-two Cardinal win in the 1,500
with Lopez in third.
Later, Dey and freshman Sara Moore
provided eight needed points in the 800
meters to give the team a two-point lead
with seven events left to contest.
The Cardinal men found their
strength in familiar places, the throws
and the distance events. In addition to
Popejoy's win in the hammer, junior
John Roldan led an unexpected Stanford
sweep in the javelin with a personal best
throw of 191-7. Strand and freshman
Josh Gleason took two-three to give the
Cardinal a 25-11 lead after four events.
Perhaps the most pleasant surprise of
the afternoon came from the 400-meter
relay team. Freshman Anthony Book
man, senior Branyon Davis, junior Jami
Webb and junior Jimmie Johnson ran an
emotional race in a season best 40.51 to
take the win from Cal by only 0.07 sec
onds. Their win gave the team a 19-point
lead after five events.
"It was comforting to see that lead,
but you know Cal is a great team," Pope
joy said. "The first half of the meet was
our strength and the second half was
theirs, I was just anxious about that sec
ond half."
In fact, Stanford led Cal until the
16th event of the day, the 200 meters.
Junior Jimmie Johnson, who earlier

won the 400 meters in 46.41, and
senior Branyon Davis challenged
Cal's Kevin Devine, and Jerod
Cherry up to the last 40 meters. It
was there that Johnson pulled up
and fell to the track, grabbing his
hamstring as he had at a meet
against Oregon and Fresno State
earlier this season.
Without Johnson's points in the
200 meters, Davis provided the sole
point in the event against Cal's
eight points from first and second,
and Cal pulled itself to a tie with
Stanford at 70-70 with three
events to go.
Later in the day Chokshi
returned for the women in the
3,000 along with Dunscombe to
challenge Lopez once more. Dun
scombe took an early lead and kept
it to the finish with a 9:55.68 win
followed by Chokshi in second
place, leaving Lopez in third once
more.
The 5,000 meters was the next
event on the track for the Cardinal
men, and they established them
selves as the pace-setters with
seven athletes entered against
Cal's two. The lead alternated
between several different Cardinal
runners, but sophomore Greg Jim
merson possessed the lead with
one lap to go in the twelve-lap race.
Cal's Mark Douglas, who had beat
en Jimmerson a few weeks earlier,
sat close on his heels. With 200
meters to go, Stanford sophomore

J.J. White demonstrated his fine
form with a powerful kick, passing
Jimmerson and sprinting to the
finish for first place in 14:36.21.
Jimmerson began to fade 50
meters from the finish and Dou
glas capitalized to steal second
place as the only Cal runner in the
top eight.
The Cardinal lead was a slim
three points with the triple jump
and mile relay left. Stanford knew
that Cell's Lee Adkins and Len
Ozolinsh would be hard to beat,
and their fears proved true as the
Cal duo took one-two. Manning
took third in 49-2 1/2 as Cal now
took the lead for the first time in
the meet with only one event left to
decide the outcome.
Cal's men entered the mile relay
with a slim four-point lead. With a
win in the relay, Stanford could
win the meet by one point and
break its 23-year losing streak in
Big Meets.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Johnson, the relay's anchor,
remained sidelined after his ham
string cramp in the 200 meters.
The burden fell upon Travis Clark
to anchor his team to victory.
Sophomore Tad Heath ran the lead
leg, and after his hand-off to
Branyon Davis the Cardinal had a
slight lead. On the third leg fresh
man Jeff Allen had extended the
lead to 10 meters as he passed the
baton to Clark.
With three events already under
his belt, Clark still managed to run
a fast first 200 meters, but then
Cal's Jesse Wilson took over. To
the enthusiastic cheers of his team

mates who now lined the last
straight-away, Wilson passed
Clark and motored home to the fin
ish to seal the Cal come-from
behind victory.
"I thought I'd go by him in the
end of the race," Wilson said after
the race. "They ran really strong."
The mile relay reminded Wilson
of his senior year in high school
where he dropped the baton on the
anchor leg at the state champi
onships, a mistake he did not let
himself repeat.
For the women, Stanford held
onto a one-point lead going into the
last two events, the triple jump and
the mile relay.
The Cardinal women were
never in the mile relay as Cal took
the lead on the first leg and refused
to slow down en route to a three
second win. The triple jump was
the only event left for the women
to challenge Cal's four-point lead.
Cal's Amy Littlepage jumped to
first place, securing her team's vic
tor ahead of Stanford senior Flo
rence Adu and senior Anne Lee,
who finished two-three.
Despite the narrow defeat, head
coach Vin Lananna offered noth
ing but praise for the Cardinal.
"We hit them where they hurt
and neutralized them for most of
the meet," Lananna said. "I'm
very, very proud of how these kids
performed. The men and women
were remarkable on a day when
they dug when they needed to dig
and dove when they needed to dive.
This meet just validates the fact
that we are on our way to a great
team."
