## 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
Some 52 years after its first
dedication, Angell Field was
again dedicated to become the
new site of Stanford track and
field, Thanks in large part to
the contributions of aiumni
Charles "Chuck"" Cobb and
Otis Chandler, construction is
expected to begin in June on a
new nine-lane all-weather
track next to the varsity tennis
courts and the track house.
"This is the rebirth of
Angell Field and is the begin
ning of a new era that will pre
serve the name Angell Field
for the future ahead," said
Franklin "Pitch" Johnson,
founder and chairman of Asset
Management Company in Palo
Alto and a member of Stan
ford's 1950 Pacific Coast Con
ference champion mile relay
team.
Chuck Cobb originally
approached Athletics Director
Ted Leland about developing
Angell Field. In the years after
track moved to the stadium,
Cobb felt that the great memo
ries of Angell Field had been
overlooked and wanted to
restore the field to prominence
in memory of all those who
competed there.
Cobb competed as a hurdler
on the track and field team
under former coach Payton
Jordan, later served as U.S.
Ambassador to Iceland and is
presently the chairman of the
once-defunct Pan American
World Airways.
Cobb and Otis Chandler
provided the bulk of the $1.5
million required for the radical
renovation of the now dilapi
dated track site.
