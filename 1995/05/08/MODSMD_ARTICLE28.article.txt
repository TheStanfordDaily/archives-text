# Angell Field is once again track's home
## 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
Some 52 years after its first
dedication, Angell Field was
again dedicated to become the
new site of Stanford track and
field, Thanks in large part to
the contributions of aiumni
Charles "Chuck"" Cobb and
Otis Chandler, construction is
expected to begin in June on a
new nine-lane all-weather
track next to the varsity tennis
courts and the track house.
"This is the rebirth of
Angell Field and is the begin
ning of a new era that will pre
serve the name Angell Field
for the future ahead," said
Franklin "Pitch" Johnson,
founder and chairman of Asset
Management Company in Palo
Alto and a member of Stan
ford's 1950 Pacific Coast Con
ference champion mile relay
team.
Chuck Cobb originally
approached Athletics Director
Ted Leland about developing
Angell Field. In the years after
track moved to the stadium,
Cobb felt that the great memo
ries of Angell Field had been
overlooked and wanted to
restore the field to prominence
in memory of all those who
competed there.
Cobb competed as a hurdler
on the track and field team
under former coach Payton
Jordan, later served as U.S.
Ambassador to Iceland and is
presently the chairman of the
once-defunct Pan American
World Airways.
Cobb and Otis Chandler
provided the bulk of the $1.5
million required for the radical
renovation of the now dilapi
dated track site.
Otis Chandler, for 20 years the
publisher of the Los Angeles
Times, was captain of the 1950
team and once possessed the
third- best shot-put throw in the
world.
The new track will be named in
honor of Cobb and his family
while the throwing and jumping
areas will be named in honor of
the Chandler family.
James Lofton, National Foot
ball League star and 1978 NCAA
long jump champion for Stanford,
was just one of many distin

guished alumni and boosters on
hand to participate in the cere
monies.
"I think it will be great to have
a track outside the stadium,"
Lofton said. "It'll be nice to have a
really specific track for the team
to bring the fans closer to the
action. Now you'll be able to run
with the wind instead of against
the cross-winds [of the stadium
track]."
Also in attendance was middle
distance runner Ben Eastman. On
March 26, 1932, at Angell Field,
he set the world record in the 440-
yard race in 46.4 seconds. Two
weeks later he set another world
standard in the 880-yard race in
1:51.3, making Angell Field the

site of two world records in two
weeks. Both of Eastman's times
would have won at the Big Meet
this Saturday, 63 years later.
The ceremonial ground-break
ing was scheduled to follow the
completion of the Big Meet in the
stadium. Unfortunately, Califor
nia continued its winning ways by
defeating the Cardinal in an
extremely close meet.
After Cobb and Chandler broke
the ground with the first digs of
the shovel, Pitch Johnson could
not help but take one last jab at
the Golden Bears.
"I hope they can dig another
hole six feet long and six feet deep,
and next year we can bury Oski in
it."
