## Tucker, Stanley to share reins 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The women's basketball team made its first
step toward filling out the depleted coaching staff
with Friday's announcement that Stanford is hir
ing 1992-93 Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the
Year Marianne Stanley.
Stanley, who is taking an administrative assis
tant position immediately, will become co-head
coach with Amy Tucker on Oct. 1. With the depar
ture of Tara VanDerveer to the USA Olympic Bas
ketball Team, the Cardinal asked the former USC
head coach, VanDerveer's friend and sometime

rival, to help lead the team.
"It's a real coup for the Stanford program to
attain someone of Marianne Stanley's experience,"
said Tucker, who has been women's basketball
associate coach for 10 years.
Stanley offers an impressive resumd. A former
head coach at Old Dominion, Penn and USC, she
lists five national championships among her
accomplishments. Stanley tallied her first two
titles as a player for Immaculata in 1973 and 1974
and coached Old Dominion to national champi
onships in 1979, 1980 and 1985.
