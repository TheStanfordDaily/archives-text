# Plank and Jenkins resign
## Tucker, Stanley to share reins 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The women's basketball team made its first
step toward filling out the depleted coaching staff
with Friday's announcement that Stanford is hir
ing 1992-93 Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the
Year Marianne Stanley.
Stanley, who is taking an administrative assis
tant position immediately, will become co-head
coach with Amy Tucker on Oct. 1. With the depar
ture of Tara VanDerveer to the USA Olympic Bas
ketball Team, the Cardinal asked the former USC
head coach, VanDerveer's friend and sometime

rival, to help lead the team.
"It's a real coup for the Stanford program to
attain someone of Marianne Stanley's experience,"
said Tucker, who has been women's basketball
associate coach for 10 years.
Stanley offers an impressive resumd. A former
head coach at Old Dominion, Penn and USC, she
lists five national championships among her
accomplishments. Stanley tallied her first two
titles as a player for Immaculata in 1973 and 1974
and coached Old Dominion to national champi
onships in 1979, 1980 and 1985.
"Having Marianne here will be
fabulous," VanDerveer said. "Our
team will now be able to take advan
tage with working with one of the
premier coaches in the country."
This will be Stanley's second
tour of duty with Stanford. From
January to October of 1994, Stan
ley was promotions director of
women's basketball following her
departure from USC.
"I can't tell you how excited I
am about coming back to Stanford,
and about getting a chance to sit on
the bench in a coaching situation,"
Stanley said.
USC, the site of her last coach
ing job, fired Stanley in 1993 — the

year she was named the Pac-10
Coach of the Year — after she sued
the university to gain equal pay
with the school's men's basketball
coach, George Raveling. Stanley
lost that lawsuit and is currently
appealing.
Stanley had not received anoth
er offer to coach until Stanford's;
some have speculated that schools
blacklisted her because of her legal
action against USC.
As with any situation with two
leaders, one will have the final say.
That role will fall to Tucker, who
has spent the past 13 years as an
assistant under VanDerveer.
According to Stanley, who will be
consulted in every decision, this
will not pose a problem.
"I realize this is a temporary
position for me," Stanley said. "My
only agenda is to perform my

coaching duties to the best of my
ability, to help develop the players
and the program and to help con
tinue the success that Tara and her
staff have achieved over the last 10
years.
"I'm confident I can help the
team and help keep the level of the
program up until Tara returns. I'm
also looking forward to working
with Amy Tucker. I have great
respect in her ability as a coach. I
think we'll work veiy well together
this season at Stanford."
The makeup of next year's
coaching staff remains to be deter
mined following the departures of
assistant coaches Julie Plank and
Carolyn Jenkins. The Athletics
Department announced Friday
that both submitted their resigna
tions approximately two weeks
ago. The positions remain unfilled.
