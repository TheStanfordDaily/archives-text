## Voice mail system will pilot in Stern 
### Alda Leu 
Private voice mailboxes will be
offeree! to Stanford students next
fall if a pilot project implemented
last week in Stern Hall earns stu
dent approval.
Forty selected students in Stern
Hall are receiving free voice mail
services, including the private mail
boxes, until the end of the quarter
for testing the new system.
This system allows the caller to
leave a message for a specific person
in the room, as well as for both
roommates — the only option avail
able on the current program.
"It is a test to see if they like it,"
said Anne Crowley, a manager at
Student Communication Services'
client service center. "Then we'll
have the summer months to fine
tune how we are going to adminis
ter it and set the rates. We will be
able to offer it to the Stanford com
munity in the fall."
The private mailboxes were re
quested by many students during
phone registration at the beginning
of the year, Crowley said. Cus
tomers also inquired about the ser
vice throughout the year.

Student Communication Ser
vices decided to purchase the re
quired software for the mailboxes
last month during its annual soft
ware update.
The system then needed a trial
run. "We were looking for a group
of students that had mostly dou
bles, triples or quads," said Crow
ley. "Stern has almost all dou
bles."
Of the 20 rooms that have par
ticipated, none have complained
about the new system, said Crow
ley. And unless all 20 rooms re
spond negatively to a survey during
the third week in May, the system
will likely be offered next year.
"I think it's great," said sopho
more Shawn Wrobel, a Burbank
resident. "I was sick and tired of
hearing my roommate's messages,
and now I don't have to worry
about it anymore."
One potentially problematic
area is that the stutter dial tone, in
dicating unheard messages, is iden
tical for all waiting messages, but
Crowley remains confident that
this will pose no major obstacle con
sidering the successful implemen
tation at other schools.
