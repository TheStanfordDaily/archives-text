# Baseball to battle Sac State
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball squad
will look to polish its blemished
non-conference record today as it
travels to Sacramento State in a
make-up contest rained out three
weeks ago.
The Cardinal (28-20 overall,
17-10 in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division) sports a measly 11-10
record against non-conference
opponents this season. The squad
might need to improve that mark
if the team fails to win the Six-
Pac and relies on its overall
record and performance to nab a
bid into regional competition.
The Hornets are only 25-25 on
the season but might nonetheless
pose problems for the streaky
Cardinal. Freshman right-hand
ed pitcher Kyle Peterson will take
the mound for Stanford with a 9-
1 record and 2.78 ERA. Peter
son's first collegiate start came
against the Hornets earlier in the
season, when he pitched five
innings, allowed four runs on
nine hits and struck out four.
As the ace of the Cardinal
staff, Peterson leads the team in
wins (9), starts (12), innings
pitched (97), ERA (2.78), strike
outs (68), complete games (6) and
