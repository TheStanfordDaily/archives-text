# Baseball to battle Sac State
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball squad
will look to polish its blemished
non-conference record today as it
travels to Sacramento State in a
make-up contest rained out three
weeks ago.
The Cardinal (28-20 overall,
17-10 in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division) sports a measly 11-10
record against non-conference
opponents this season. The squad
might need to improve that mark
if the team fails to win the Six-
Pac and relies on its overall
record and performance to nab a
bid into regional competition.
The Hornets are only 25-25 on
the season but might nonetheless
pose problems for the streaky
Cardinal. Freshman right-hand
ed pitcher Kyle Peterson will take
the mound for Stanford with a 9-
1 record and 2.78 ERA. Peter
son's first collegiate start came
against the Hornets earlier in the
season, when he pitched five
innings, allowed four runs on
nine hits and struck out four.
As the ace of the Cardinal
staff, Peterson leads the team in
wins (9), starts (12), innings
pitched (97), ERA (2.78), strike
outs (68), complete games (6) and

opponent's batting average
(.228).
Stanford sunk Sacramento
State in the only other meeting of
the teams early this season, post
ing a 7-4 victory at home in
February. But the Hornets have a
7-6 series lead since Mark Mar
quess took the Cardinal helm in
1977, including a three-game
sweep last season.
Hot Stanford batters include
senior third baseman Steve Carv
er, who has hit safely in 16 of his
last 19 games, batting .443 with
six home runs and 36 RBIs in that

stretch. Junior first baseman
Troy Kent is also on fire, hitting
safely in seven of his last eight
games and batting .357 in the
stretch.
Including today's game
against Sac State, the Cardinal
has five more games against non
conference foes, allowing the
squad ample opportunity to
appreciate its stock by the time
the regional selection committee
goes to work.
The game against the Hornets
will start a marathon week for the
Cardinal after having the last six
days off. USF will visit Sunken
Diamond on Tuesday at 2:30 p.m.
before the Stanford squad travels
to Arizona State for a three-game
series this weekend.
