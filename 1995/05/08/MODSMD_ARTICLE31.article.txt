# Seattle's not a hit for softball

Washington 910

When you're a young team
playing a more talented opponent,
mistakes will kill you.
That is the lesson the Stanford
softball team (15-33 overall, 1-23
in the Pacific 10 Conference) took
from its weekend doubleheader at
Washington (45-20, 14-10 in the
Pac-10), as a combined nine
errors helped the Huskies take
two games from the Cardinal by
scores of 9-0 and 10-0.
"You just can't allow that

many errors against good teams,"
Stanford coach Sandy Pearce
said. "When their pitchers are
throwing that well, you can't give
away runs."
To make matters worse, saying
that Husky pitchers were throw
ing well is a gross understate
ment. In the first game, Washing
ton pitcher Stephanie Burns
tossed her first career no-hitter at
the Cardinal, marking the first
time that Stanford has failed to
collect a hit in a game this season.
"She had some help [from her
defense]," Pearce said. "We hit a
lot of good, hard shots that went
right at people. But she was hit
ting her spots unbelievably well
and she threw very hard."
After a scoreless first inning,
Washington got things going with
a three-spot in the home half of

the second inning. Sara Pickering
keyed the rally with an RBI dou
ble, the only extra-base hit of the
game. All three runs were
unearned.
Stanford managed to stay in the
game until the fourth, as sopho
more pitcher Angela Webb was
doing her best to match Burns. In
that inning, the Huskies scored
four times, followed by a two-run
rally in the fifth to provide the
game's final margin.
The Huskies were efficient,
getting their nine runs off of nine
hits, although Stanford's four
errors certainly helped.
"Part of it was being out of
position [when the ball came off
the bat]," Pearce said. "The girls
got poor jumps on some balls and
that makes the plays a lot harder
and contributes to [their] making
errors. This [number] was a lot
more than we normally make. We
usually play solid defense."
Heather Tarr led Washington,
going 3-for-3 with three runs
scored. Pickering and Kara Gus
tine each had two hits for the
Huskies.
Were it not for all the errors,
this game would have easily been
described as a classic pitcher's
duel between Webb and Burns.
Burns' no-hitter improved her
record to 18-11 on the year, while
Webb fell to 8-25. Only four of the
nine runs allowed be Webb were
earned.
Burns, on the other hand,
faced the minimum number of
batters, as she picked off Summer
Lee after walking her in the third
inning. Were it not for the walk,
Burns would have recorded a per
fect game.
"Angela pitched well," Pearce
said. "They're a great hitting
team, so you know they're going
to get their hits eventually. On
the other side, it was just [Burns']
day."
The second game began much
as the first game ended, as the
Huskies erupted for seven runs in
the first, aided in large part by
three Cardinal errors.
"We weren't really in the game
after that," Pearce said. "We kind
of let down a little."
Webb allowed no more runs
until the bottom of the fourth,
when the Huskies added three
more to open up a 10-run lead.
With Stanford unable to score in
the top of the fifth, the game was
called after five innings due to the

10-run rule.
Husky Shelley Brown sparked
the squad, smacking a bases-loaded
triple in the seven-run first. The hit
was one of only six hits by Wash
ington batters in the game, as
another good performance by Webb
was wasted amid sloppy defense.
Tami Storseth extended her
hitting streak to 11 games and
scored twice for Washington.
Gustine had a two-run double in
the first.
"Angela's learned a lot [pitch
ing both games] this year,"
Pearce said. "She's gotten some
valuable experience and is a much
better pitcher."
Husky ace Eve Gaw was
almost as impressive as Burns,

allowing just one Cardinal hit in
five innings of work. Gaw, who
has won 19 of her last 24 deci
sions and is within one win of the
all-time Husky record for wins in
a season (held by Burns),
improved to 24-8 with a 1.50
ERA, while Webb dropped to 8-
26. The Huskies have won four
straight and 20 of their last 22.
"[Gaw is] a great pitcher,"
Pearce said. "She throws really
hard and hits her spots. I'd say
she's as good as the pitchers at
UCLA and Arizona, and she
might be better than the pitchers
at [No. 8] Cal."
Stanford, on the other hand,
must regroup before a home dou
bleheader against No. 2 Arizona
this weekend.
"Our defense will come
around," Pearce said. "We've
been a good defensive team all
year."
