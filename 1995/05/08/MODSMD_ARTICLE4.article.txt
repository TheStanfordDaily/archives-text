# Panel discusses goals of affirmative action
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Contributing writer 
Three Stanford professors dis
cussed how affirmative action has
impacted their departments and
addressed the current debate over
the issue at a panel discussion Fri
day afternoon.
Anthropology Prof. George Col
lier, Linguistics Prof. John Rick
ford and Law Prof. Sally Dickson,
director of the Office of Multicul
tural Development, spoke of the
need to redefine the goals of affir
mative action and change misper
ception < that tend to stigmatize its
beneficiaries

"How many times have you
heard the words 'bias,' 'prefer
ence,' 'unfair' and 'reverse discrim
ination'?" Dickson asked the gath
ering of 50 in Meyer Library's
forum room.
Dickson said the phrases of the
issue define the current debate.
"Descriptors are accepted as a defi
nition," she said.
However, the panelists tried to
move away from these catch phras
es and instead set out clearer inter
pretations of what affirmative ac
tion should be.
"Employers must do something
affirmative to seek applicants for
employment and make a 'good
faith effort' to ensure there are
women and people of color," Dick
son said.
"It means trying to find the best
person, looking with special atten
tion at women and people of color,"
Collier added.
In the discussion afterward,
senior Bliss Temple said, "Affirma
tive action is about what the
Idepartments] need, not the vic
timization of women and people of
color, lit is| tapping into human
potential."
Panelists said affirmative action
in their own departments worked
in the same way.
Rickford talked about a paradox
which occurs often in his field of
study. Linguistics often involves
observing people in a natural set
ting, he said. This is more easily
done when the observer is of the
same ethnicity as those being stud
ied, which, he said, "creates a need
to hire people of color."

He explained that especially in
the growing area of black linguis
tics i>eople relate to someone of
their own race more easily and
these linguists can better observe
the relaxed, vernacular language.
Rickford also said that "women
and minorities have raised the
issue of the applications of linguis
tics. [How can we use it) to try and
solve racial problems?"
Collier agreed that affirmative
action has a positive impact on his
department. "Bringing women in
opens intellectual spaces" in gen
der studies, he said.
Anthropology Prof. Jim (iibbs
raised the issue of stigmatization
by affirmative action. People need
to "counter the misstatement put
out there that jminoritiesl have
been taking the jobs of white
males," he said. "People of color
have become the scapegoat."
Dickson, however, reminded
the audience that believing "affir
mative action causes racist atti
tudes is the silliest idea." Indeed,
ones of the goals of affirmative
action is that it "will change per
ceptions, and people will no longer
have mental stereotypes," she
