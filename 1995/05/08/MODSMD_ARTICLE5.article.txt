## 
### Alda Leu 
An 18-member committee comprised of Stan
ford students, faculty and staff was recently ap
pointed to search for a new dean of students to
replace former Dean Michael Jackson, who left
the University in late March.
The committee, chaired by Dean of Under
graduate Admissions James Montoya, will sort
through piles of applications in the coming
weeks.
The deadline for the submission of applica
tions was Saturday, with faxes still coming in

throughout the weekend, according to Nadine
O'Leary, executive assistant in the Office of the
Vice Hrovost for Btudent Affairs.-
More than 50 applications were submitted by
Friday, said Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds.
Candidates will be invited to the Stanford
campus for interviews near the end of the
month, O'Leary said. Three final candidates will
be selected by the committee, with Edmonds
casting the deciding vote.
The committee is on a tight time schedule to
determine a list of three unranked candidates for

Edmonds by early June. "That's why they are
working weekends and nights. We want to have
the candidates here for interviews by the first of
June," Edmonds said.
Jim Larimore will continue to serve as acting
dean of students until a permanent dean is
found.
Jackson's permanent replacement is expect
ed to be selected by early June and will begin by
Sept. 1. Jackson left his position to serve as the
vice president of student affairs at USC.
"It doesn't happen often that
people leave a position like this in
the middle of the year, but there's
certainly nothing wrong with
that," said O'Leary.
Jackson's move prompted a
nationwide search, with advertise
ments in the Chronicle of Higher
Education, on-line networks and
at conventions.
In addition, Edmonds sent out
over 300 letters to colleagues for
suggestions, O'Leary said.
Edmonds said the committee is
looking for "humanity, fairness,
sensitivity to ethnic diversity ...
someone with good interactive
skills and someone who shares our
vision, that is, supports our aca
demic vision of the University."
A primary concern of the new
dean of students would be minori
ty involvement at Stanford.
The dean of students also over
sees student organizations such as
fraternities and sororities, as well
as New Student Orientation, the
Judicial Affairs Office and Tresid
der Union.
