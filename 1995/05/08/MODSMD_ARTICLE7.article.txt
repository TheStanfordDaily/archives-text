# Cinco de Mayo
## Students celebrate Mexican victory with food and dance 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Remembering past struggles of Mexicans, Stan
ford's Chicano / Latino community celebrated Cinco
de Mayo this weekend with speakers, food and perfor
mances of traditional music and dance.
Cinco de Mayo celebrates the Mexican victory over
an invading French army — then considered to be the
best in the world — in the Battle of Puebla on May 5,
1862.
"The stoiy has become more malleable to take on
different meanings," said history graduate student
Steve Pitti, one of the speakers at the opening event
Friday. "The overall theme is not to count the under
dog out. I think that is significant in countering politi
cians, employers and anti-immigration forces who
seek to bringdown Mexican Americans."
The weekend-long celebration — sponsored by El
Centro Chicano, the Chicano / Latino student group
MEChA and Casa Zapata — included Mariachi music
by the Stanford Mariachi Cardenal and traditional
dances by Ballet Folklorico de Stanford.
"It's a good opportunity to participate in Mexican
culture, to see the murals [in front of El Centro] and to
ask questions," said sophomore Jos6 Gutierrez.
Oddly, the holiday is more popular here in the Unit
ed States than it is in Mexico, said El Centro's Irvine
Fellow Evelia Jimenez. She added that Sept. 16, the
day of Mexican independence, is more widely celebrat
ed in Mexico.
Jimenez said that was one reason the holiday's cel
ebrations were being held over the weekend.
"We thought it was important to commemorate the
day itself," said Jipi6nez.
The festivities kicked off on Friday at El Centro and
continued yesterday at Casa Zapata with mid-day
mass and a speech by Visiting History Prof. David
Gutierrez, who spoke of the need to "define the future
of the Mexican American in this country."
"I think it's a great opportunity
because it's the first time since the
'60s to redefine a sense of purpose
and place," he said. "Despite the
crisis of affirmative action and
immigration, we need to come
together in a cohesive whole to
debate these issues and what they
mean to us."
After the speech, Ballet Folk
16rico performed dances from dif
ferent parts of Mexico in the court
yard.
"The costumes and dances are
representative of different
regions of Mexico," said junior
Olivia Diaz. "The dress I am

wearing is from the Veracruz
region. It's made of very sheer
white cotton and reflects an
African influence."
Junior Nicole Vazquez donned
a more colorful and ornate dress
from the Jalisco (southwest
coastal) region.
"The dress has a little myth
that goes along with it," she said.
"It goes back to the era of the Mex
ican revolution. Ladies would
smuggle letters and weapons in
the folds of the long skirt because
none of the Spanish soldiers would
search there."
In addition to the Ballet Folk
lorico performances, Mexican food
was served, from the better known
tacos and burritos to deep-fried
snacks served with chili sauce
called duritos.
