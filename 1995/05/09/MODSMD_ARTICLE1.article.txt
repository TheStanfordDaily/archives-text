### Carolyn Sleeth Contributing writer 
The first Westerner ever to be chosen for the
job, Stanford alumnus Robert Hass was selected
as the country's new Poet Laureate last week.
Created in 1937, the position of Poet Laure
ate involves giving the U.S. Librarian of Con
gress advice on the poetry collection and raising
awareness on the importance of literature.
Hass, currently an English professor at UC-
Berkeley, said the position is a way "to call at
tention to literature and to good writing."
"I am honored and not ungrateful for the po
sition," Hass said, adding that he always keeps
in mind that he is "only as good as tomorrow's
work."
"It will be hard to get enough solitude to com
plete my work, and the public aspect [of the job]
will be a big struggle," he added.
Hass will replace Rita Dove, the first black
and youngest Poet Laureate. A one-year posi
tion, the Poet Laureate gives readings of his or
her work and organizes literary programs for
the Library of Congress.
The Poet Laureate earns a $35,000 salary and
has use of an office in the Jefferson Building in
Washington, D.C. Hass said he plans to com
mute from Berkeley to Washington.
Hass is currently a visiting professor at the
University of lowa's Writing Workshop, but said
he plans to return to UC-Berkeley in the near fu
ture.
He received his doctorate from Stanford in
1976. Remembering the Univer
sity fondly, Hass said, "It was
people like Wallace Stegner who
made the program so warm and
welcoming to new writers. . . .
The profs really encouraged
writers; they weren't preoccu
pied with their own criticism.
"I remember Yvor Winters,
a teacher of poetry, was the
dominating presence in the
Stanford English Department,"
Hass said, though he added he
did not always agree with Win
ters. "He was so passionate and
I disagreed with him. To him,
writing was a matter of life or

death and I had never met any
one like that."
English Prof. Emeritus
Albert Guerard, director of
freshman English when Hass
was at Stanford, said Hass was
one of the more "effective mem
bers of his staff and certainly
[had] more literary inclination
than others."
A student at Stanford during
the Vietnam War, Hass was a
"vigorous protester," Guerard
said.
English Prof. Diane Middle
brook was in her first year as an
assistant professor when Hass
received his doctorate. "He is a
splendid choice for the role" she
said. "He is the kind of poet who
gives a good name to poetry."
"I remember that we started

an alternative university and
started teaching our own cre
ative writing courses (at Stan
ford)," Hass said. "We young,
self-important graduate stu
dents thought we could teach
better than our professors.
"We wanted to get some con
tact with the East Palo Alto com
munity, so we started free cre
ative writing courses to anyone
who wanted them," he said.
His previous writings include
"Field Guide" — his first work
which centers on California
landscape — and two other col
lections, "Praise" and "Human
Wishes."
Hass has also spent time writ
ing haiku and translating the
works of Polish author and poet
Czeslaw Milosz.
