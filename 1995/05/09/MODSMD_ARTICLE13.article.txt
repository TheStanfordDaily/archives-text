Anti-terrorism under fire
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton demanded immediate congres
sional action on his anti-terrorism pack
age yesterday, disregarding Republican
warnings that an FBI promotion could
stall the legislation. "It needs to pass
and pass now," he said.
In a slap at House Speaker Newt Gin
grich, the president said, "Nothing can
justify turning this bill into a political
football."
Gingrich suggested Sunday that
Attorney General Janet Reno's decision
to make Larry Potts the FBl's deputy
director "will further slow down the ter
rorist legislation and will mean even
greater concern over civil liberties,
which I don't think is inappropriate."

Anti-government groups have criti
cized Potts since he oversaw the 1992
siege at the home of white separatist
Randall Weaver in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, a
situation begun by the U.S. Marshals
Service. He also oversaw the 1993 stand
off and ultimate demise of the Branch
Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.
Potts was censured for his role in the
Weaver episode after an FBI sharpshoot
er accidentally killed Weaver's wife. But
Potts is a trusted associate of FBI Direc
tor Louis Freehand has been commend
ed for his leadership in the Oklahoma
City bombing investigation.
Gingrich spoke of the "genuine fear"
many rural Americans have of the feder
al government and said the Potts promo
tion was "sending a signal that watching
the FBI is not illegitimate."
