# Europe commemorates V-E Day

### 
BERLIN (AP) â€” Where Nazi Ger
many surrendered in ruins 50 years ago,
the victorious powers came together
with democratic Germany yesterday to
remember the dead and pledge peace for
the future.
The bells of Berlin's churches tolled
for 15 minutes as Vice President A 1 Gore,
Prime Minister John Major of Britain,
President Francois Mitterrand of France
and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin of
Russia arrived for a ceremony in the
Schauspielhaus Theater, reconstructed
from wartime ruins.
The leaders were in Paris earlier in
the day for a military parade and flyover
by jets sending streams of red, white and
blue smoke above the Champs-Elysees.
On Sunday, London played host to a rec
onciliation prayer ceremony and a peace
festival Ln Hyde Park.
In Berlin, there was no military show,

no festival.
Here, on May 8, 1945, Nazi Germany
surrendered unconditionally. Adolf
Hitler had committed suicide eight days
before and the world was just learning
the horrific toll of the death camps.
"Germany unleashed the most terri
ble war there had ever been and it expe
rienced the most terrible defeat that one
could imagine," President Roman Her
zog said, delivering his country's main
statement on the war's end.
President Clinton, who is to attend
Victory Day celebrations in Moscow on
Tuesday, honored American veterans in
ceremonies in Washington and Virginia.
Commemorations were also held in Lon
don, Moscow and other cities.
All the speakers drew applause from
the audience of more than 1,300. But the
applause seemed especially warm as Mit
terrand, 78, recalled his time as a prison

er of the Nazis.
Even in that dark hour, he said, his
guards were starting to resist Nazi ideol
ogy, and after the war he resolved that
France and Germany, age-old enemies,
should never go to war again.
"The enemy of yesterday is the friend
of today," said Mitterrand, who belonged
to France's collaborationist Vichy gov
ernment before joining the resistance.
V-E Day, he said, was "a victory of
Europe over itself."
Gore recalled how Gen. Dwight Eisen
hower, the supreme Allied commander,
said after V-E Day:"The success of this
operation will be judged 50 years from
now. If at that time, Germany is a stable
democracy, we will have succeeded.
"As a young American born after
World War II," Gore said, "I wish to
report to Gen. Eisenhower: Mission ful
filled."
