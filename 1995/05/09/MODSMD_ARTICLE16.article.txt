State of the University
address should focus on
specific Stanford issues

Last Thursday, University
President Gerhard Casper
delivered his third "State of
the University" address, in which
he focused on what Stanford does
well and the changing role that
universities will play in the future.
Casper started his speech with
a brief discussion of the Oct. 17
indirect-cost settlement —
arguably the most significant
piece of news since his last address
— but he quickly moved toward a
discussion of the role of the uni-

versity over the past millen
nium and predictions on
how it will have to adapt in
the future in the face of
competition from other
sources of education.
All this was very interest
ing — but is the president's
annual speech on the state
of Stanford University real-

ly the proper forum for such dis
course?
There are plenty of forums per
fect for academic discussions on
the role of the Ivory Tower. We feel
that Stanford's annual "State of
the University" address should not
be one of them.
In the future, President Casper
could try to focus more on specific
problems Stanford faces and their
solutions. It would be nice to hear
from our president about things
that truly affect us on a day-to-day
basis.
This is not to say that he should
have devoted his hour-and-a-half
speech to, say, the advantages and
disadvantages of the Commence
ment procession. He could, howev
er, tackle more concrete concepts
than the growing role of technolo
gy in education.
Here are some of the themes
that need more attention:
• Alumni satisfaction: Alumni
giving remains relatively low,

which implies to us that Stanford
graduates still don't feel a strong
connection with their alma mater.
Alumni concerns are as important
to Stanford's future as general
trends in education. Although
Casper has made improving alum
ni giving a priority, he didn't really
touch on it in his state of the school
address.
• Campus services: Stanford's
president probably doesn't care
about a Taco Bell on campus —
and we don't blame him. Still,
there are a number of service
related issues that his administra
tion should be involved in, like
changes in Tresidder and graduate
housing. Giving issues like these
more visibility would do a lot to
show students and other commu-

nity members that Stan
ford is trying to improve
life on campus; why not
use the state of Stanford
address to do this?
• Ethnic studies: The new
program in comparative
studies or race and ethnici
ty is becoming a reality and
will be a part of Stanford

for a long time to come. Although
Casper mentioned its creation in
his address, something as signifi
cant as this is to Stanford's future
might deserve more attention.
These suggestions should not be
construed as criticism of President
Casper's speech; indeed, it present
ed some very interesting thoughts
on the historical role of the univer
sity over the last millennium and
its future.
But is that what the "State of
the University" address should be
about? We think not. The speech
should focus on what is going on
specifically at Stanford, not on the
problems facing universities in
general.
Every year, the Stanford com
munity and beyond read the
address for a hint of the direction
that the University will be taking.
Instead of reading about Stan
ford in the next millennium, how
ever, we'd like to hear more about
the Stanford of today.
