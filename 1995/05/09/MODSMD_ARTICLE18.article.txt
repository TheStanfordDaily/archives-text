## Won't you be my neighbor? 
### 
SEVENTY-TWO percent of all Amer
icans say that they do not know
their neighbors.
It's a sad commentary on our society,
but I can't really blame anybody. After
all, if we live in cities and towns that don't
actually have neighborhoods, how can we
be expected to know and trust our neigh
bors? However, I think a more important
question must be addressed: Why is it
that we think apathy is an acceptable
state of social activity?
It's interesting to note that the afore
mentioned 72 percent are not even those
who have been slapped with the label of
Generation X, that absolutely inane
nametag with which we are stuck. We,
who are accused of being the pinnacle of
laziness and apathy. That 72 percent is
representative of an older group of peo
ple, those who supposedly took such an
interest in politics and social issues dur
ing their youth. Those are the people who
are so critical of our generation, people
who wax nostalgic over the sit-ins and
the protests and the jailings of earlier
decades, and who see the youth of today
as too self-centered to even care about
what happens outside of our personal
realms of existence. People who berate us
for being politically and socially apathet
ic.
Yet this same 72 percent admits freely
that they do not know the people who live
next door. This, in my eyes, is an example
of personal apathy. An unwillingness to

pull ourselves off of our sofas and talk to
the people around us, making connec
tions that allow us to trust each other and
develop support systems. It goes beyond
the political apathy that supposedly
plagues today's youth. It goes beyond
having last week's drink-in seen as the
only type of protest that can get Stanford
students mobilized. It goes beyond the
fact that most Stanford students won't
make time to read a real newspaper every
day and find out what the rest of the
world is doing.
Of course, as students who, for the
most part, live on campus, we are well
acquainted with our neighbors and there
fore have not yet fallen prey to personal
apathy. We know all of the people who
live in our hallway, and oftentimes, all of
the people in our dorm or house. They are
the people with whom we eat, sit through
house meetings, hang out, and have fun.
We have made connections with them,
and they have become part of our growing
network of friends and acquaintances.
But what happens next year, when you
and your draw group move on to a differ
ent place, as do the other draw groups
from your residence? They are the same
people that you love and care about, but
they are no longer within your personal
realm of existence. For the personally
apathetic, these people then become non
existent. Luckily, we all live in a relative
ly contained area, and no matter what, we
are bound to eventually run into most of

these people in class or at the post office,
so the consequences of being lazy are not
too severe. But what happens over the
summer, when people graduate, or when
your friends go abroad?
We get lulled into believing that we will
never fall into the dreaded 72 percent.
That we will swim against the whirlpool
of apathy and proudly become part of the
enviably active 28 percent, those lucky
devils. Is it really that easy? To start com
bating this particular form of apathy,
what we need to do is become aware that
it surrounds us. We need to stop rational
izing our behavior with platitudes like,
"Well, we didn't call each other back last
time, so we kind of stopped talking." Or
even worse, "Well, I guess we weren't
that close to begin with."
We need to take the time and make the
effort to keep in touch with the people
that we care about. We'll all be moving on
to different places soon enough. We need
to stop taking our political and social apa
thy to new depths of self-centeredness.
We need to take steps to fight the inertia
that too easily overtakes our personal
lives and to stop pushing ourselves into
that 72 percent. There's time enough for
that after graduation.

Sudha would like to point out that Abhi
and Clark could never be accused of being
personally apathetic.
