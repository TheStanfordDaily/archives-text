Videos could never replace professor-student interaction

SOME RECENT commentators see
high costs and high tech together
creating a situation where tradi
tional in-the-flesh teaching will be
replaced by video tapes. I agree with
President Casper that universities like
Stanford will survive, but I can't believe
that lectures will generally go.
Excellent lecturers like Eugene Weber
will still be in demand, at least for tapes.
Moreover, any institution that can fea
ture his likes in person will have a con
siderable leg up; lots of students would
be eager to pick up human vibes from
them, ask them questions and get clues
from their faces or gestures, trail them
into the Quad or even their diggings.
That human aspect is valuable even in

lesser talents. Warm contacts have been
close to the true substance of education
since Socrates.
All the talk about efficiency and cost
cutting misses the main point: every
where you look, you see signs of a
Rousseauistic revolt against artificiality,
the bloodless abstractness of modern
life.
In music, says Terry Teachout in
"Commentary," there is a major return
of tonality, e.g. with Gor£cki. In
women's fashion, the "simply beautiful"
is back, according to Time. In primary
schooling, Ernest Boyer, director of the
Carnegie Foundation for Education, pro
claims an era of old-fashioned common
sense. In visual art, the representational

is "big" again. Folks, especially uprooted
Hispanics, are flocking to earthy kinds of
religious expression.
In sum, people need — particularly
now — a sense of some reasonable conti
nuity with the past and with nature
and / or the spirit. Departure from veg
etable rootedness, weaning, the mirror
problem (Lacan), alienation (Marx), the
discontents of civilization (Freud), secu
larization and "hollow men" (Eliot) are
in a series of stages of abstraction lead
ing to crisis and a yearning for some rea
sonable coherence, a feeling of "flow
from the source," whether paternal
authority and blessing or maternal milk
and love.
A good professor, male or female and

of any color, a real live human being, can
make all the difference in tentative ado
lescence. Looking back from retirement,
it wasn't just with students who consid
ered me their mentor that I made signif
icant contacts almost daily. We all know
le courant passe. Canned music is no
substitute for the creaking, groaning
wood of cellos, the deeply-involved hum
ming of certain pianists, the feeling of
fleshly-psychic contact that they give.
If Stanford wants to survive as a true
university, it should look more to the lib
erally human, the humanities, and less
to gadgetry, efficiency schemes and
clumsy social engineering.
