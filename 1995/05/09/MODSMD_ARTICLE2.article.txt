# Revisiting WWII resistance efforts
## Prof warns of selective memory 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Memory is selective, said Columbia University His
tory Prof. Istvan Deak, who used yesterday's com
memoration of the 50th anniversary of the Allied vic
tory in Europe during World War II to question the
validity of giving hero status to resistance groups of
that era.
In a speech at the History Corner, Deak, whose spe
cialty is Eastern European and Russian history, said
most people today think of members of such groups as
"patriots" fighting Nazi tyranny.
"Resistance movements, often glamorized by folk
lore or Hollywood, were much more complex than
their superficial presentations," Deak said. "Complex
issues and the reality of politics [during and after
World War ll] led to a falsification of memories."
Citing another side effect of selective history, Deak
said the memory of Nazi collaboration continues to be
played down. Unity and national strength were seen
as paramount concerns to the leaders of European na-
tions desperately trying to
rebuild.
While there were more than a
million people tried for collabora
tion, only a few thousand were
actually ever sentenced, Deak
said.
"In the first years of the war,
collaboration in many occupied
countries was not a bad alterna
tive," said Deak.
Deak also said resistance fight
ers were not always the gallant
and patriotic figures romanti
cized in national lore.

"Certainly there were internal
conflicts between resistance
groups," said Deak. "The Ger
mans killed Jews, but Jews were
also in danger from resistance
groups themselves. Jewish fight
ers were not only in danger of
being shot by the Germans, but
by other partisan groups."
Deak talked about the
tremendous costs the resistance
placed on ordinary civilians, par
ticularly those who lived in the
country.
"They were not angels. They
would come in and kill villagers
who were suspected of collaborat
ing. And as the fighters lived off
the land, they took supplies and
food from any village they could,"

said Deak. "Then if it looked like
they [villagers] were helping the
resistance, they would be shot by
the Germans."
Even though many collabora
tors were tried after the war,
resistance fighters were hailed as
heroes. Few were questioned
about their tactics of "illegal
retribution and vigilante justice,"
Deak said
And while May 8 marked the
end of the war for the Allies, the
fighting was not over in many
parts of Europe. Conflicts
between resistance groups grew
even stronger, according to Deak,
boiling over into civil war in
much of Eastern Europe.
"May 8 is V-E day, but victory

for whom?" asked Deak. "In
Eastern Europe, the fighting and
retribution kept going."
And in countries formerly
occupied by Nazis, those who
were once under German control
took revenge.
"Germans were killed or
deported, and women who associ
ated with the Germans were pub
licly humiliated," said Deak.
On that point, Deak asked
what separates resistance from
"banditry or terrorism."
"What is terrorism?" Deak
asked. "The dilemma is that
groups like the Intifada or the
Oklahoma City bombers call
themselves resistors or freedom
fighters."
