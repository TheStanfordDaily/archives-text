# Thai Cafe employee has acted impolitely in his treatment of customers
## 
### 
Yesterday, a friend of mine was on
her first visit to the Thai Cafe (on the
ground floor of the Psych building). She
did not know the fast military pace in
which the line moves. Unfortunately,
she also forgot to pick up her drink from
the machine before she got to the guy
taking the order. So she stepped back
and went to the machine and returned
to give him her order. He basically yelled
at her and asked her to go to the back of
the line. He said she was cutting in,
although all the customers in the line
seemed fine with her giving her order. In
fact some of them, including myself, told
him that he was being unfair. But he
continued to be rude and intimidating to
my friend, who was completely caught
by surprise.
Another incident involved a guy who
was reading in line and took an extra
second to look at the menu before giving
the order. Again, a similar confrontation
with the man taking the order hap-

pened. (This one, however, I did not wit
ness.)
Who runs the Thai Caf6? Where can
this kind of treatment be reported and
corrected?
