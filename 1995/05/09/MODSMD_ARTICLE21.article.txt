# Civility just disguises the 'anti-sympathy' felt about discrimination
## 
### 
I would like to respond to the letter
from May 5 vilifying me as a hate-monger.
What I despise is exactly the "calm and
civil tone" that prejudiced people affect in
order to disguise their lack of sympathy,
in fact their anti-sympathy, for minori
ties. I think it would be better if indeed
we were honest and stated our passionate
views plainly, rather than using eco
nomics and statistics ineptly, to maintain
a false appearance of rational advantage.
In this regard, William Vogt and Jay
Bhattacharya wrote a very insightful let
ter about the hatred and name-calling
they apparently saw in my letter, and
paid little attention to my arguments
which they saw as being drowned by the

hateful "bulk" of my letter. (Perhaps they
should count the words, I would say.)
In addition, Vogt and Bhattacharya
accused me of implying that "those" law
students "have no regard for the truth." I
would agree wholeheartedly with this
statement. In my view, the law students
do not have much regard for truth or
they would not have denied the reality of
discrimination and its effects.
Vogt and Bhattacharya call for "open
discourse," much as the law students did.
However, if the law students had been
truly interested in an "open discourse,"
they would have researched the issue
more thoroughly to discover the complex
ities of the issue. Instead, they denigrated
the arguments in favor of preferential
policies by setting up a straw man. Also,
they implied that defenders of preferen
tial policies are ignorant of statistics. Of
course, Vogt and Bhattacharya chose to
ignore this statement, instead attacking
my own behavior.
Dante once said that the hottest circle
in hell is reserved for those, who in the
time of crisis, choose to do nothing. I
would say that the hottest circle in hell is
reserved for those, who in the time of cri
sis, deny that any wrong is being done.
Perhaps these are one and the same.

Finally, I would like to apologize to
anyone who was offended by the tone of
my letter. I am not a hateful person, but
perhaps this was poorly conveyed in my
writing. I have always and still do wel
come discourse from all points of view,
which all contain parts of the truth.
