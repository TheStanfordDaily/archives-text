# Tell them to wait: Don't stand in long line just to pay for food at CoHo
## 
### 
The Coffee House has a problem: You
go in and order food, the sandwich-mak
ers work quickly and then you wait...
and wait... just to pay. The second cash
register is almost never staffed.
Here's what you can do. If you wait
more than five minutes to pay, politely
tell the person at the register where you
will be sitting and that you will be glad
to pay when someone is available to take
your money.
The managers will quickly fix the
problem if enough people do this!
