## Global climate change and the politics of risk Anticipate outcomes before experimenting 
### Stephen H. Schneider 
AWARENESS THAT pollu
tion can degrade our envi
ronment is hardly new.
That was dramatically learned
centuries ago when uncontrolled
coal burning fueled the infa
mous London smogs. Unique
about modern-day environmen
tal problems is that the scale is
no longer local but global, and
that potentially irreversible
effects are likely, thus it is no
longer acceptable to "learn by
doing." When the laboratory is
the Earth, we need to anticipate
the outcome of our global-scale
experiments before we perform
them.
One of the most potentially
serious global change problems
is the synergistic effects of cli
mate change and habitat frag
mentation. People fragment nat
ural habitats for farmland, set
tlements, mines or other devel
opment activities. If climate
changes, individual species of
plants and animals will be forced
to adjust if they can. In the past
they typically migrated with
changing climate as spruce trees
did when the last ice age ended
10,000 years ago. But could all
the migrating species that sur
vived the last ice age make it
across freeways, agricultural
zones and cities of the 21st cen
tury?
This problem raises several
controversial questions. Should
we anticipate this global change
risk and respond by setting up
interconnected nature reserves
as a hedge against some species
going extinct if the climate
changes? How much is it worth
to protect the survival of a
species or a habitat? What is the
value of life — of humans or
other species?
Good science is necessary to
help answer how such biological
conservation practices can take
place in the most economically
efficient way. What policies soci
ety should choose to respond to
the advent or prospect of global
change projections, however, is
not a scientific question per se,
but a political value choice about
how to take risks and about who
pays the "insurance" premiums
to reduce risks or compensate
losers.
Policy choice is normative,
that is it depends on the norms
or values of the decision mak
ers — be they consumers, vot
ers, CEOs or cabinet minis
ters. Just because some
economists or politicians
choose not to value the preser
vation of biological diversity
very highly, for example, does

not mean that the majority of
the public feels the same way,
or would continue to feel the
same way if they learned more
about the problems.
The problem of global climate
change involves a large degree of
uncertainty; however, several
aspects of the issue are well
understood and have brought
about consensus in the scientific
community. Scientists agree, for
example, that approximately six
billion tons of carbon are emit
ted as carbon dioxide (COo) to
the atmosphere every year from
industrial activities, mainly the
burning of fossil fuels. There is
widespread consensus that the
C0 2 concentration buildup in
the atmosphere, combined with
buildups of other greenhouse
gases have trapped in the lower
atmosphere roughly an addition
al two watts per square meter of
energy over the entire Earth
since the industrial revolution.
Climatologists also generally
agree that the global surface air
temperature has warmed up on
average approximately 0.5° ±
0.2° Celsius in the past century.
Uncertainties become more
significant when we move to pro
jections about the future. The
combination of increased popu
lation and increased energy con
sumption per capita is expected
to contribute to increased CO2
and sulfate emissions over the
next century, but the extent of
the increase is uncertain. Cen
tral estimates of emissions imply
a doubling of current concentra
tions by the middle of the 21st
century, leading to projected
warming ranging typically from
1 degree to more than 5° C by
the end of the 21st century.
Warming at the low end of
this uncertainty range could still
have significant implications for
ecosystem adjustments, whereas
warming of 5° C or more in the
time frame of a century or less
would have catastrophic effects
on natural and managed ecosys
tems, produce serious coastal
flooding, and involve other
impacts on natural and human
systems. The overall cost of
these impacts could run into
tens of billions of dollars annual
ly in the U.S. alone.
Analysts from a variety of dis
ciplines have been attempting to
gauge the impacts of global cli
mate change on agriculture,
water supplies, biodiversity and
economic growth under various
scenarios; others are attempting
to get a better sense of the prob
abilities of the different climate
change scenarios. In tandem
with this work on impact assess
ment, many economists have
been seeking to estimate the
abatement costs to the world
economy of particular countries
of strategies designed to reduce
CO9 emissions.
investigators assessing the
economic costs of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions typi
cally have considered the costs of
reaching given targets for emis

sions reductions, or alternative
ly, the costs of given taxes on
fuels that contribute to green
house gas emissions. In my view
virtually all of the models suffer
from an important omission that
biases upward the estimation of
the costs of policies to avoid cli
mate change by reducing green
house gas emissions — the
neglect of price-induced techno
logical change.
Climate change policies, by
raising the prices of convention
al fuels, can stimulate more
rapid development of alterna
tive, non-fossil fuel technologies
and lower the prices at which
these technologies break even.
Such induced technological
change mitigates, perhaps sub
stantially, the costs of climate
policies. Larry Goulder, associ
ate professor in economics, and I
have made preliminary calcula
tions which show strong reduc
tions in the cost of emissions
abatements policies as a result of
possible induced innovations.
I am not suggesting that
induced technological change
become the principal basis for
introducing policies such as car
bon taxes that reduce green
house gas emissions through
higher prices of carbon-based
fuels. The main reason to intro
duce a carbon tax, for example,
is its potential to internalize the
COo-related externalities associ
ated with fossil fuel combustion
and thus to help avert signifi
cant levels of global climate
change. By recognizing induced
technological change, however,
we lower the minimal environ
mental benefits necessary to jus
tify a given COo reduction policy
on overall cost-benefit grounds.
