# Opportunity was missed in Berlin
## 
### Thomas Heller 
Except for the host city
of Berlin, anxious to recap
ture its aura as a world capi
tal, no one was very excited by the
recent Conference of the Parties
(COP) of the Convention on Cli
mate Change. The COP was sup
posed to fill in detailed rules to meet
the general commitments to limit
global warming undertaken in the
1992 Earth Summit's Rio Conven
tion. Perhaps, there was little disap
pointment in the inability of the 150
nations who signed the Convention
to agree on any of the key issues of
substance or procedure because
hopes for consensus were so
depressed going in. Although recent
weather data are consistent with
the scientific community's broadly
held view that there exists a sub
stantial risk of rapid growth of the
world's average temperatures, there
is a clear absence of political will to
attack the problem. Because the
dangerous effects of global warming
are a half century away, of unclear
economic magnitude and distribut
ed across regions in pattern hard to
specify with current climate models,
governments seize on scientific
uncertainty as a reason for inaction.
In the end, the results of Berlin sim
ply lived up to low expectations that

Studies, attended the Conference
of the Parties in Berlin.

there would be no major progress
because the politics of global warm
ing are not yet ripe.
What is even more upsetting
about the COP is that there was an
important viable compromise on the
issue of Joint Implementation (JI)
that was ignored by the delegates.
The idea of JI is simple. Anyone
with obligations to stabilize emis
sions in those countries that have
agreed to such a target are permit
ted by JI to comply with those obli
gations by actions in their home
country or abroad, wherever cutting
emissions is least expensive. Global
warming is ideally suited for such
an international market because
the location in which greenhouse
gasses are emitted or removed from
the atmosphere does not matter.
While there are plenty of tricky legal
and economic issues to be resolved
to make JI work properly, the basic
idea is common-sense economics. It
would allow whomever has a target
under the Rio Convention to meet it
through the lowest cost methods
they can discover. To rule out this
option is to decrease the chances
that nations which have relied heav
ily on fossil fuels will take their obli
gations to heart.
JI offered the best chance to
begin building a new international
regime for climate change because it
responded to two key concerns that
have been expressed by wealthy and
poorer parties to the Convention.
Rich nations are afraid to take on
increasing commitments to reduce
emissions because they fear the
costs will harm their stagnant
economies. Poorer nations are

unwilling to cut the growth rate of
their emissions or use their
resources as sinks for global emis
sions unless they are compensated
for their development losses. JI
promises both to minimize compli
ance costs for emitters and to bring
investment resources to nations
that host JI projects. Nevertheless,
the COP, after long debate, chose to
eliminate any serious incentives for
first world emitters to take action in
Latin America, Asia or Africa. The
hard question is why this opportu
nity was missed.
The answers to this dilemma
may lie in an unexpected direction.
It is obvious that climate change is a
global problem and that there must
be a global response. The natural
forum for such issues would seem
the United Nations and that is
where the action has taken place.
Yet the weak results of Berlin may
be a sign that the best paths to com
prehensive solutions do not lie
through universal negotiations.
While the arguments that lead to
such a heterodox conclusion need
far more detail, several aspects of
the UN process stand out as diffi
culties that were apparent at COP.
First, diplomacy is a restricted
world. The delegates were on the
whole not economically informed or
inclined. They are often more
attuned to broad principles of inter
national law and state regulatory
solutions to polity problems than
are their colleagues in their home
governments who are leading much
of the world toward more open mar-
