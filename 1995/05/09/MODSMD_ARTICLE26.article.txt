# We are inactive in face of uncertainty

WHAT DO YOU remem
ber the most about
1990? Your first crush?
Junior prom? SATs? The fall of
communism? Probably not. The
heat, right? I don't know how
many times I caught myself say
ing, "Wow! This is the hottest
year ever!" Who could ever for
get such a scorcher?
Nineteen ninety marked the
hottest year on record. If that
doesn't mean much to you, then
you can understand why essen
tially nothing is being done
about global warming. More
immediate concerns engage us
on a daily basis. Getting back
that wacky walk thing, typos on
your r£sum6, the lifecycle —
these are all things much more
tangible and, therefore, more
important.
But we have scientists and
politicians who are paid to deal
with things such as global warm
ing, right? So what's the problem?
The problem is one of uncer
tainty. It seems that when faced
with the element of uncertainty
regarding something currently
external to our economic frame
work, our decision-making pro
cess fails.
Just as one goes to a doctor to
diagnose and treat an illness,
beginning in the late '80s, the
public and decision-makers
turned to science for some
answers to a series of natural
catastrophes (recall the massive
flooding, droughts, and heat
waves of that time). These con
cerns culminated with the Rio
Summit in 1992 where world
leaders and scientists met to
address the issue of climate
change.
The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, comprised of
the world's leading climatolo
gists, concluded that within the
next 50 years we could expect a
rise in average global tempera
ture of several degrees, with pos
sible catastrophic consequences
to agriculture, low-lying regions,
fragile ecosystems and their
countless species. This diagnosis
led to the prescription that we
stem this future problem by tak
ing action today.
"Action" has amounted to a
non-binding international agree
ment to reduce carbon emissions
to 1990 levels; an agreement ini
tially stalled by the Bush admin
istration, later signed by Clinton,
and currently being pursued
under a "voluntary mandate" in
the U.S. The fact is, the majority
of industrialized countries are
not on track to achieve target
reduction levels. This in turn
compounds the problem further
by providing little incentive for
developing countries to avoid our
dirty path to industrialization.
The reasons for this inaction
lie in the fact that pollution is a
cost that is currently external to

economic considerations. To
internalize it we must invest in
emerging technologies, develop
sustainably and stop subsidizing
fossil fuel use. However, any
decisions to increase energy effi
ciency, limit emissions of green
house gases or stop massive
deforestation are seen to have
costs far greater than any possi
ble benefits future generations
may reap from them.
Without definitive conclu
sions from science, the possibili
ty of global climate change is
dwarfed by the certainty of bud
getary constraints. Policymak
ers remain paralyzed by their
constituencies who don't see
beyond their quarterly reports.
Viewed in this way, science's
remedy does not make economic
sense and is politically impotent.
George Bush's chief of staff,
John Sununu, argued that
strong measures today are not
necessary, and that our money
could be best spent on research
which will eventually minimize
costs to industry by providing
better technologies in the
future. This line of reasoning,

Our inability to act
stems from not
recognizing that our
actions today are
indeed choices.

however, does not hold up to
scrutiny. Given that there is a
probability of global climate
change, substantial reduction
measures today will necessarily
reduce the total costs of abate
ment in the long run while pro
viding insurance against a
threshold level of atmospheric
carbon being reached.
This inability to act also
stems from not recognizing that
our actions today are indeed
choices. There is a built in credi
bility to "the way it is" that
allows the status quo not to be
viewed as one option among
many. It is all too easy to accept
that the way things are done
today as the best way things can
be done tomorrow. Addressing
global climate change requires a
rethinking of the countless
choices that have brought to
bear a modern society that views
global environmental uncertain
ty an acceptable risk.
In order for the costs of pollu
tion to be internalized by the
economy, the people who run
that economy (that is, every
body) must internalize the
threat that global climate
change represents. Don't look to
feel global warming anytime
soon. Don't dismiss it, either.
Science is doing its best to pro
vide the public with the likely
scenarios — it remains up to us
to choose a path. In keeping
trust with companies like Texa
co and Unocal, a typically risk
averse culture is betting the
farm on the infinite adaptability
of the Earth and humankind.
