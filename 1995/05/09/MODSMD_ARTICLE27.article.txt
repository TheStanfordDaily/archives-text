# Abatement costs outweigh the benefits

UNDER A TYPICAL pro
posal for greenhouse gas
abatement, the United
States and other industrialized
Organization for Economic Coop
eration and Development
(OECD) nations would unilater
ally agree to stabilize their car
bon emissions between 1990 and
2000, reduce them to 80 percent
of this level by 2010, and stabilize
them thereafter. Under this pro
posal, low-income developing
nations would be allowed to
increase their emissions through
2020, but would thereafter be
expected to participate in global
stabilization efforts.
Using a computer model we
can calculate the direct annual
losses due to this type of agree
ment. By 2000 the costs in the
U.S. approach 1 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP)
and after 2020 the costs rise to
nearly 2.5 percent. Other investi
gators have arrived at broadly
similar quantitative results.
In percentage terms, the costs
to the U.S. of carbon dioxide
(COo) abatement appear modest.
Recall however, that the GDP is
an astronomical number. The
U.S. today is spending about 2
percent of GDP on all forms of
environmental protection. Until
a consensus is reached on both
the benefits and costs of CO2
abatement, it is difficult to argue
the need for drastic immediate
measures to achieve global emis
sions stabilization. A slower and
more deliberate approach might
make better sense.
From a political perspective,
the impact of C0 2 reduction on
individual industries is perhaps
even more significant than the
impact on the economy as a
whole. This would be particularly
troublesome in the case of a uni
lateral agreement. As a first step
toward a global agreement, it is
often suggested that the OECD
countries take the lead and adopt
unilateral measures to reduce
carbon emissions.
In any sector where energy
inputs are significant, a unilateral
agreement to limit carbon emis
sions would have serious impacts
on our international competitive
ness. These sectors include basic
industries such as steel, alu
minum, copper, petroleum refin
ing and petrochemicals produc
tion. Furthermore, coal is the
most carbon-intensive of our fos
sil fuels, and this could virtually
wipe out any prospects for coal
exports from the U.S.
In the absence of exemptions
from carbon taxes, the OECD's
energy-intensive manufacturing
industries would tend to move to
countries such as China, India,
and Brazil. The resulting increase
of carbon emissions in those
nations would partially offset the
reductions undertaken unilater
ally by the OECD countries.
If we were to introduce modest
emissions taxes during the next
few decades and have them rise
at a sufficiently rapid rate we
would eventually turn to high
cost renewables and to unconven
tional energy carriers such as
hydrogen.
More aggressive policies would
be to stabilize global emission
flows at their 1990 levels or limit
stocks of C0 2 to a concentration
of 415 parts per million by vol
ume. Both policies would entail
substantial near-term adjust
ment costs. But our simulations
show that they would have little
potential benefits until 2050 and
thereafter. In terms of costs and
benefits, how does this add up?
Abatement costs would have a
high impact in the first half of the
21st century. The benefits would
not be realized until the second
half and beyond. At anything like
a conventional 5 percent real cost
of capital, it is hard to see how the
uncertain and distant future ben
efits could outweigh the relatively
near-term costs.
Since global temperatures are
not likely to rise significantly
during the next several decades,
and aggressive C0 2 abatement
policy is unwarranted for the
near term. Such policies, if imple
mented, could cost many hun
dreds of billions of dollars. Even
after 2020, there would still be
enough time to adapt the global
economy to a sharp decline in
carbon emissions if we learn that
such action is warranted.
