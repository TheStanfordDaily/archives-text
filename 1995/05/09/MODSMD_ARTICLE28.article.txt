## Eighth-inning double ends Cardinal's hopes of victory

Stanford 6
Sacramento State 8

If fate should have it that the Stanford baseball
squad makes an appearance in regional playoff com
petition this season, it would be to the team's
utmost benefit to reevaluate its current attitude
toward non-conference competition.
The team's policy today seems to go something
like this: Who cares. And last night the Cardinal
stuck to its frequently adhered-to theme, dropping
its 11th non-conference game of the year at Sacra
mento State, 8-6.
The loss to the Hornets (26-25) dropped the 18th
ranked Cardinal to 28-21 overall and 17-10 in Six-
Pac competition. More telling, however, is the less
than-stellar 11-11 non-conference record that Stan
ford now wears like a scarlet letter.
The Cardinal was rocked at the plate early, and
freshman right-hander Kyle Peterson was knocked
silly in an abnormally vicious fashion. Peterson (9-
1), who slipped out of Sacramento with a no-deci
sion, gave up nine hits and six earned runs in three
and two-thirds innings of work. Three of those runs

came in the first two innings of play.
The scene was just as messy on the Hornets'
mound. Chris Schwarze worked only one inning for
Sac State, giving up three earned runs and walking
five batters in the first frame. But Hornet hurler
Dan SwafTord provided some stability in the next six
innings, silencing Stanford at the plate until he
fatigued in the eighth inning. He gave up three runs
on nine hits in the six and two-thirds innings he rode
the mound.
The Cardinal began the game in fine fashion, col
lecting two runs on two stolen bases by freshman
center fielder Joe Kilburg, a sacrifice fly by senior
third baseman Steve Carver and an RBI single to
right field by junior second baseman Brian Dal
limore. Stanford returned in the second inning to
score another run on junior left fielder Cede Carter's
sacrifice double play ground-ball.
But the Hornets stung back. They collected three
runs in the first two innings on five hits before
adding three more runs on four hits in the forth
inning.
Stanford trailed Sac State 6-3 for most of the
game. The Cardinal finally swarmed the Hornet
pitching staff in the eighth inning, collecting five
hits in the top of the inning to score three runs and
earn the 6-6 tie.
The Hornets took the lead for good in the bottom
of the frame, pounding Stanford sophomore reliever
