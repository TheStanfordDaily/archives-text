# A
						little champagne on the way to Champaign
## Both ultimate squads qualify for championships in Illinois 
### John Fabian Contributing writer 
Sunday evening after the
games were over, the Stanford
men's and women's ultimate fris
bee teams celebrated their pend
ing trip to nationals in Cham
paign, 111., with a little champagne
of their own. Their faces red from
both sunburn and happiness, they
had a little party on the field to
celebrate the first time that both
the men's and women's teams
have traveled to nationals in the
same year.

Saturday afternoon, the
women, who were seeded first in
their pool, defeated Humboldt
State University, UC-Santa Bar
bara and UC-Berkeley. These vic
tories propelled the squad to the
championship against the No. 1
team in the country and their
toughest competition of the year,
UC-Santa Cruz.
"We definitely played well,"
said graduate student Sharon
Amick. "It was a really good team
effort. We really came together."
Having lost twice to Santa
Cruz this year, the women knew

what to expect. However, they
could not quite get past the
Banana Slugs and were forced to
an all-or-nothing second-place
game against Santa Barbara,
which had won the losers' brack
et.
In a difficult battle, the women
found themselves tied 12-12 with
the Gauchos in the final game.
After having placed third the last
two years, the women did not
want to stay home again. They
sucked it up and scored the last
three points, defeating the Gau
chos 15-12.
"We played with a lot of heart
in the end," said Amick. "We
came out and said, 'We want this
game!' "
The men, ironically, faced a
very similar course to that fol
lowed by the women. Seeded sec
ond in its pool, the men's team
defeated Humboldt State, region
al top-seed Santa Barbara, Berke
ley and Las Positas College.
"We were pretty flat in the first
game," said senior captain Jesse
Roach. "We were down game
point, then scored two in a row to
win. Then we pretty much
crushed Santa Barbara. We beat
them 13-11, but were in control
for the whole game."
They rolled on to defeat Berke
ley and to crush Las Positas 12-4.
This put them in position to face
— you guessed it — Santa Cruz in
the championship game on Sun
day.
Like the women, the men faced
a very tough opponent in the
Banana Slugs, and could not quite
pull out the win. They lost a 9-5
lead early and were beaten 15-10.
"It was a super windy day,"
said Roach. "Their older guys
