# A 						little champagne on the way to Champaign
## Both ultimate squads qualify for championships in Illinois 
### John Fabian Contributing writer 
Sunday evening after the
games were over, the Stanford
men's and women's ultimate fris
bee teams celebrated their pend
ing trip to nationals in Cham
paign, 111., with a little champagne
of their own. Their faces red from
both sunburn and happiness, they
had a little party on the field to
celebrate the first time that both
the men's and women's teams
have traveled to nationals in the
same year.

Saturday afternoon, the
women, who were seeded first in
their pool, defeated Humboldt
State University, UC-Santa Bar
bara and UC-Berkeley. These vic
tories propelled the squad to the
championship against the No. 1
team in the country and their
toughest competition of the year,
UC-Santa Cruz.
"We definitely played well,"
said graduate student Sharon
Amick. "It was a really good team
effort. We really came together."
Having lost twice to Santa
Cruz this year, the women knew

what to expect. However, they
could not quite get past the
Banana Slugs and were forced to
an all-or-nothing second-place
game against Santa Barbara,
which had won the losers' brack
et.
In a difficult battle, the women
found themselves tied 12-12 with
the Gauchos in the final game.
After having placed third the last
two years, the women did not
want to stay home again. They
sucked it up and scored the last
three points, defeating the Gau
chos 15-12.
"We played with a lot of heart
in the end," said Amick. "We
came out and said, 'We want this
game!' "
The men, ironically, faced a
very similar course to that fol
lowed by the women. Seeded sec
ond in its pool, the men's team
defeated Humboldt State, region
al top-seed Santa Barbara, Berke
ley and Las Positas College.
"We were pretty flat in the first
game," said senior captain Jesse
Roach. "We were down game
point, then scored two in a row to
win. Then we pretty much
crushed Santa Barbara. We beat
them 13-11, but were in control
for the whole game."
They rolled on to defeat Berke
ley and to crush Las Positas 12-4.
This put them in position to face
— you guessed it — Santa Cruz in
the championship game on Sun
day.
Like the women, the men faced
a very tough opponent in the
Banana Slugs, and could not quite
pull out the win. They lost a 9-5
lead early and were beaten 15-10.
"It was a super windy day,"
said Roach. "Their older guys

really stepped up, and their
throws in the wind made the dif
ference."
Finally, the men faced the chal
lenge of winning the second-place
game. Luckily, Las Positas, who
has never beaten the Stanford
men, scored an upset over Santa
Barbara.
"We had a mental edge over
Las Positas," said Roach. "They
came out strong, but we beat
them 15-10."
Both teams attributed their
victory to solid team play.
"I said we had to execute as a
team," said Amick, "and we did."
"I would hesitate to say any
one person stepped up," said
junior Mike Payne. "The veterans
who were expected to step up did.
We also saw a lot of younger play
ers make some great plays. We
didn't play our best ultimate, but
we developed that team psycholo
gy that takes individual talent and
develops it into a winning team."
After being the fourth seed in
the tournament, the victory and
the trip to nationals seemed very
sweet to the men.
"We showed them who the real
nitz was," said junior Chris Sarno.
And for the women, it was a tri
umph that allows them to forget
two straight third-place finishes.
"I was in shock at first," said
Amick. "I couldn't believe we
weren't third place for the third
year in a row. But now we know
we can do it, and we can go to
nationals and execute."
When the men's game was
complete, it was finally time to
party.
"It was nice because the
women had advanced a little while
before us," said Roach, "and when
we won our game we had a little
champagne fiesta on the field."
