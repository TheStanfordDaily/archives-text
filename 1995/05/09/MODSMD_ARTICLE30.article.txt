The Stanford women's
lacrosse team knows just how
sweet revenge can be. Seeded first
in the Northern Division, the
Cardinal finally defeated a tough
UC-Davis team 8-6 to capture the
Western Women's Lacrosse
League.
It was the final chance for the
Stanford women to avenge two
consecutive years of losing to the
Aggies in the final. Next year,
they will leave the league to join
other Division I teams in their
quests for an NCAA champi
onship.
Stanford played an all-around
great game in the semifinal
matchup against Arizona.
"Everything just connected and
we wanted to go into Sunday's
final with that momentum," said

junior attacker Wendy Kula.
Senior goalkeeper Emily Chang
agreed that the squad came out
strong and had a solid game.
The 21-2 romp over Arizona
was a mtyor boost for the Cardi
nal as Stanford headed into what
was considered a "mental game"
against the defending champions.
However, the team's confidence
was almost shattered when junior
co-captain Peppie Stephenson
was ejected from the game in the
first half. Despite a Cardinal goal
within the first few minutes of
the championship match, the
team had to recover from the loss
of one of their key defenders.
"It was hard because she's a
very big leader on the team with a
big presence on the field," Kula
said. "So, when she was gone,
there was a bit of an adjustment
period for us."

The women's lacrosse team downed defending champion UC-Davis
en route to the league title.
An adjustment period was
exactly what the team needed as
the Cardinal headed into the sec
ond half trailing the Aggies by
two goals. During half time head
coach Kay Cowperthwait
encouraged her team and made
them believe that they could win
it all.
"As a whole, we weren't play
ing our game [but] the coach told
us that we could win as long as we
didn't get frantic," freshman
attacker Dara Kaplan said.
Once Stanford calmed down
the Cardinal got back together.
Sophomore attacker Hope Holi
day started off the second half
with a goal that turned out to be
the momentum Stanford needed.
Sophomore defender Rachel Price
replaced Stephenson in what was
a new position for her while
junior Hannah Flatau anchored

the Stanford defense. Kaplan
scored two goals and was named
the offensive MVP while another
freshman attacker, Carole
Fakhry, added three goals. Kula
and senior Eileen Gorman each
scored one.
Stanford faced not only a phys
ically aggressive Davis team but
also a mentally aggressive Aggie
squad. "The game got frenzied,
and we felt a lot of mental pres
sure," Chang said. "The juniors
and seniors had the rivalry hang
ing over our heads, so it was a
really mental game."
The Aggies also had the home
field advantage, so the Cardinal
had to block out the Davis crowd
to concentrate on its game. They
toughed it out until the very end
to dethrone the Aggies for the
first time in two years.
"We got our revenge, and we're
so glad we won before leaving the
Western Women's Lacrosse
League," said Chang. "We wanted
to prove that we can do it out
here."
