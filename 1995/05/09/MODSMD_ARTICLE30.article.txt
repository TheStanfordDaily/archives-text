The Stanford women's
lacrosse team knows just how
sweet revenge can be. Seeded first
in the Northern Division, the
Cardinal finally defeated a tough
UC-Davis team 8-6 to capture the
Western Women's Lacrosse
League.
It was the final chance for the
Stanford women to avenge two
consecutive years of losing to the
Aggies in the final. Next year,
they will leave the league to join
other Division I teams in their
quests for an NCAA champi
onship.
Stanford played an all-around
great game in the semifinal
matchup against Arizona.
"Everything just connected and
we wanted to go into Sunday's
final with that momentum," said

junior attacker Wendy Kula.
Senior goalkeeper Emily Chang
agreed that the squad came out
strong and had a solid game.
The 21-2 romp over Arizona
was a mtyor boost for the Cardi
nal as Stanford headed into what
was considered a "mental game"
against the defending champions.
However, the team's confidence
was almost shattered when junior
co-captain Peppie Stephenson
was ejected from the game in the
first half. Despite a Cardinal goal
within the first few minutes of
the championship match, the
team had to recover from the loss
of one of their key defenders.
"It was hard because she's a
very big leader on the team with a
big presence on the field," Kula
said. "So, when she was gone,
there was a bit of an adjustment
period for us."
