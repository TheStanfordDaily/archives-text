# The 						Hammer of the gods
## David Popejoy is the Thor of Stanford track 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
They call him the "Pope," but
this senior is no holy pontiff. He
is David Popejoy, the Stanford
record holder in the hammer
throw.
Popejoy's list of credits and
awards read like a shopping list
for success. A three time All-
American, Popejoy has compet
ed at almost every level except
the Olympics. And Popejoy
knows that the 1996 Olympic
Games in Atlanta would be the
perfect capstone to an already
impressive career.
He and roommate senior
Toby Norwood, who also throws
the hammer for the team,
immerse themselves in the
world of international throwing.

"Toby and I have watched the
Olympics about 100 times, and
we've made our own mix tape of
the throws we like the best,"
says Popejoy.
When it comes to approach
ing the event, Popejoy sees the
hammer as an intellectual pur
suit as much as his personal
obsession.
"The feeling of acceleration
hooks you on the hammer. You
move like a roller coaster, but
you don't have to go to Great
America to do it.
"The hammer is more form
than strength. You don't have to
be super-strong to be a good
thrower. I actually think a lot of
strength would hurt a thrower.
The hammer is a learning pro
cess for as long as you throw it.
It's different for every person;

everyone needs to learn their
own style and make their own
niche."
And Popejoy carves out his
niche in Stanford history with
performances like his school
record breaking 231 feet one
inch (70.44 meters) throw at the
Big Meet last Saturday, the
third-best in the nation this year
and the sixth-best ever in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
"It was a big disappointment
not breaking the school record
last year. It was getting to be a
monkey on my back. This week I
just told myself that I was going
to relax. I told Toby that I was
going to throw over 70 meters
last Monday and on the last
throw Saturday I just decided

Senior David Popejoy of the Cardinal track team is one of the best throwers in the nation and has placed
his sights on Olympic competition. He has just set a new Stanford record In the hammer throw.
that I was going to just do it."
The throw was good enough to
give the Stanford team an early
lead against the California Gold
en Bears, who won in one of the
most competitive Big Meets ever.
The hammer leads off each track
meet and Popejoy's excellence in
the event almost guarantees
points from the beginning. It's a
role that Popejoy is used to filling
after four years of competition.
This year Popejoy enjoys the
contributions of his fellow throw
ers. Norwood throws the ham
mer along with sophomore Justin
Strand and freshman Adam Con
nolly. The four throwers are in
the top 10 of the Pac-10, and
together they've provided a huge
scoring machine for the Cardinal.
Unfortunately, they compete
above the Stadium at Angell
Field and often are overlooked by
the fans.
"You bust your butt every day
and work hard to have such a

good throwing crew, and we want
people to see how good we are,"
says Popejoy. "You do get ham
mer groupies though, and they
know who you are, so there's a
little more intimacy with the
smaller crowds."
That closeness is shared not
only by the fans of the hammer,
but by the throwers themselves.
Popejoy remains the team
authority on the hammer, and in
his own quiet way he tries to help
his teammates in all aspects of
the sport.
"Dave is an excellent coach to
the rest of us," says Norwood.
"He's willing to help, and he tells
me things I never even thought
about. He's not only a great ath
lete and a great thrower, but he
can communicate a lot about the
sport and that helps a lot."
As a captain for three years
and as a NCAA qualifier each of
those years, Popejoy exemplifies
his philosophy of leading by
example. On an individual basis
he and his coaches feel that he
has scratched only the surface of
his potential.
"He's done well, but there's a

potential for much more," says
Robert Weir, the Stanford track
and field throwing coach and a
former Olympic hammer and dis
cus thrower for Great Britain.
"It's my job and Dave's job to
improve on what he's done. It
[the school record] has been
something that is long overdue. I
don't want to put pressure on
him, but he's capable of 235 or
240 or more. It's good to see a
breakthrough after all these
months."
Popejoy now holds the school
record, but he won't be satisfied
until he's put it out to 235 or 240
feet. Although he is the best ham
mer thrower in Stanford history,
freshman Adam Connolly, son of
former Olympians Harold and
Pat Connolly, is already showing
that he will be the next great
thrower.
"Adam is the heir apparent, he
will be the future of Stanford
hammer throwing," says Pope
joy. "I feel I can throw 235 or 240
and I know that Adam is coming
soon, but I want him to have to
wait a few years to break my
record."
