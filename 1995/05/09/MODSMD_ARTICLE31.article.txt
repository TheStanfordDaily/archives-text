# The
						Hammer of the gods
## David Popejoy is the Thor of Stanford track 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
They call him the "Pope," but
this senior is no holy pontiff. He
is David Popejoy, the Stanford
record holder in the hammer
throw.
Popejoy's list of credits and
awards read like a shopping list
for success. A three time All-
American, Popejoy has compet
ed at almost every level except
the Olympics. And Popejoy
knows that the 1996 Olympic
Games in Atlanta would be the
perfect capstone to an already
impressive career.
He and roommate senior
Toby Norwood, who also throws
the hammer for the team,
immerse themselves in the
world of international throwing.

"Toby and I have watched the
Olympics about 100 times, and
we've made our own mix tape of
the throws we like the best,"
says Popejoy.
When it comes to approach
ing the event, Popejoy sees the
hammer as an intellectual pur
suit as much as his personal
obsession.
"The feeling of acceleration
hooks you on the hammer. You
move like a roller coaster, but
you don't have to go to Great
America to do it.
"The hammer is more form
than strength. You don't have to
be super-strong to be a good
thrower. I actually think a lot of
strength would hurt a thrower.
The hammer is a learning pro
cess for as long as you throw it.
It's different for every person;

everyone needs to learn their
own style and make their own
niche."
And Popejoy carves out his
niche in Stanford history with
performances like his school
record breaking 231 feet one
inch (70.44 meters) throw at the
Big Meet last Saturday, the
third-best in the nation this year
and the sixth-best ever in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
"It was a big disappointment
not breaking the school record
last year. It was getting to be a
monkey on my back. This week I
just told myself that I was going
to relax. I told Toby that I was
going to throw over 70 meters
last Monday and on the last
throw Saturday I just decided
