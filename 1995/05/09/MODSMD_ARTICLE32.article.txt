### Julie Choe Contributing writer 
Yet another grueling Stanford-California
matchup took place at the Big Row this past week
end. It was a bittersweet meet for the Stanford
teams, however: The women took the Lambert Cup
home this year while the men were defeated by the
Golden Bears.
Stanford women's crew coach Jocelyn McCand
less was very enthusiastic about the victory mainly
because this was the first time that her squad has
won since 1989. The women's varsity, junior varsity
and novice teams all won.
"It's a significant accomplishment for Stanford
women," McCandless said.
The varsity women came out with a very good
start and immediately surged ahead by a few sec
onds, which was enough to stay in control. However,
it was the novice team that had the most exciting
race of the day. The all-freshmen team had to race
every bit of the 2,000 meters in a dramatic come
from-behind victory.

Although the Stanford women (ranked third in
the Pacific 10 Conference) were expected to down
Cal (ranked fifth) thi3 year, there were no guaran
tees.
"One of the things that we were worried about at
Cal was that the weather would be a really big fac
tor, but we were blessed with nice weather on Sat
urday," McCandless said. "I'm very excited about
how all three groups did."
Unfortunately, the Lambert Cup continues to be
an elusive goal for the Stanford men. Both varsity
and junior varsity boats raced well, but the rowers
did not compete as aggressively as they needed to.
"One hundred percent isn't enough," said head
coach Wieslaw Kujda. "The beauty of the races is
that it stimulates you to do something extra, but we
haven't done that yet."
Despite its loss this year, the Cardinal team has
slowly but steadily closed the gap on Cal each time
the two have raced each other. Kujda was hoping for
a big surprise at the Big Row, but there wasn't
enough mental preparation for
the race.
"If they put the same amount
of work into their mental prepa
ration as they do into their phys
ical preparation, they would be
much faster," Kujda commented.

"Our guys are really tough. . . .
In my opinion it's one of the best
crews I've ever had in terms of
physical potential."
The Stanford men's crew may
have the physical capability, but
they still have a lot of room for
improvement. Along with the
women, they will head to the
Pac-10 championships at Red
wood Shores in two weeks. The
men hope to finish in the top

three to qualify for nationals, a
feat which they can accomplish,
according to Kujda.
As for the women, they need
to finish in the top two in order
to move onto the nationals.
McCandless believes that the
women's crew team has the
chance to move into the top two
if they beat first-place Washing
ton or second-place Washington
State.
