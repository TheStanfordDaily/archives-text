# Problems in our athletic tradition
## 
### 
"So you're going to Stanford,
right?"
Yeah.
"Y'all are the Cardinals,
right?"
No, we're the Cardinal.
"The what?"
The Cardinal. The color, not
the bird.
"What the hell is that supposed
to mean?"

One of the msyor reasons I
decided to come to Stan
ford instead of other presti
gious academic institutions was
the existence of a top-notch ath
letics program here on the Farm.
Attending a school in a major ath
letic conference with national sig
nificance — like the Pac-10 —
was key. I felt that being part of
an athletic tradition that extend
ed beyond one rivalry or confer
ence was an important part of the
college experience.
Overall, I've been happy with
my choice in terms of athletic
prestige. In my time here, we've
crushed a national powerhouse in
a bowl game, sent teams to the
Final Four in basketball and won

more national championships
that any other school in the same
time period.
OK, the Stanford football team
may not be Nebraska or Penn
State and the basketball squad
isn't UCLA, but they are heads
and shoulders above the Ivies.

Even if our teams can't always
compete with the best in the busi
ness, at least competition is an
option for us.
However, there are a few
things about Stanford's athletic
traditions that bother me. Just a
couple of little things that have
gotten under my skin. Others
may stage protests over the uni-

versity's grape policy or the termi
nation of the graduation procession,
but I have my own little crusades to
wage.
Tops on my hit list is our nick
name, the Cardinal. The color, not
the bird. I won't even touch the
1972 decision to switch from the
Indians to our current namesake.
It's better to let sleeping dogs he.
But did they have to choose a color?
Was this some sort of latent Har
vard envy? (Just as an aside —
while I may not entirely approve of
"the Cardinal", it is much better
than the student body's choice for a
new name back in '72, the "Thun
derchickens".)
I mean, it's kind of difficult to
root for a color. There are no redly
catchy slogans or cheers that go
along with it. It's hard to heckle
opposition players and fans. I don't
know, it may be just me (and it
probably is), but I have had a hard
time getting fired up about being
part of the Cardinal.
I'm also sick of explaining to
eveiyone outside of the Stanford

community that the Cardinal is a
color and not a member of the wild
kingdom. I'm sick of seeing the look
on their faces when I finish with my
explanation.
Another target in my killing
spree would be our mascot, the
Tree. My biggest problem with the
Tree is, well, that it's a tree. I think
the process by which they select the
new Tree is worthy of admiration —
it shows that the dude has sack —
but let's face the facts. It's a tree.
It's our mascot. It's a tree.
Does that feel wrong to anyone
else? The Tree is a pathetic display.
It's a sham of a mockery of a farce.
When I see that goofy-looking thing
dancing around our athletic events,
I just feel like ridiculing it, not sup
porting it. I often find myself wish
ing that the other team's mascot
would come over and beat the Tree
down. Now that would be entertain
ing.
The final enemy in my diatribe
will be the Tree's owner, the Leland
Stanford Junior University March
ing Band. I might take some flak for
my opinions, but I believe the Band
is almost as bad for Stanford athlet
ic tradition as the Tree.
I admit, I once liked the Band. I
thought it was pretty cool that Stan

ford didn't have some stuffy march
ing band with crusty uniforms and
big hats like those dudes who stand
outside of Buckingham Palace. I
used to laugh at their irreverent
brand of humor and be glad that
they were different from other
bands.
But Lately I haven't been happy
with the Band. I've realized that
their hijinks aren't really funny at
all. In fact, most of them are mean
and in bad taste. The only group the
Band really amuses is itself.
There's something to be said for
traditional bands. The USC and
Notre Dame bands may not be as
witty or animated as our own, but at
least they don't deliberately offend
people while acting as representa
tives of their universities. And per
haps more important, they know
how to play their instruments.
These three things — nick
names, mascots and marching
bands — may seem like such piddly
little things when thinking about
athletic tradition. But they actually
matter quite a lot. And until we
make some changes to the Cardinal,
the Tree and the Band, we won't be
able to build a strong athletic tradi
tion, regardless of how many cham
pionships we win.
