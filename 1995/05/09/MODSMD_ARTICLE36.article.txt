Wallet thief sighted
Stanford Police are circulating a descrip
tion of a thief who may be responsible for
the recent rash of thefts in campus
libraries.
The description was obtained from a stu
dent observing an incident in Meyer
Library a week ago, when a wallet was
taken from an unattended backpack, said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
On May 2 around 7 p.m., freshman Lana
Chin went to the bathroom and left her
backpack unattended. When she returned,
her backpack was gone.
An unidentified student observed a black
male take the backpack and leave a note on
the desk, according to Niemeyer. The stu
dent said the suspect looked like a non-stu
dent, was between 6 feet and 6 feet 4 inch
es tall, unshaven and wearing dark cloth
ing.
"The officers who were called thought he
might still be in the building, so they cor
doned it off," Niemeyer said. Nevertheless,
the suspect was not found, he said.
The victim described the suspect as a
black male, somewhere in age between his
late 30s and mid-40s. The thief was also
described as tall, thin and with bad breath.
On the same day, just before 10 p.m.,
Natali Aziz, a medical student, had her wal

let taken from her unattended backpack in
the Medical School Office Building.
A man who fit the same description was
seen around the library, Niemeyer said. He
was described as unkempt and with body
odor. Niemeyer added that police believed
he might be a vagrant.
Also on May 2, a wallet was taken from
senior Kirandeep Kang, who left her jacket
with her wallet unattended in Green
Library East. The theft happened between
5:20 and 6 p.m.
That evening, Niemeyer said, Kang got a
call from a man who stated he worked for
Wells Fargo Bank. She identified the voice
as that of a black male in his forties,
Niemeyer said.
The man told Kang that her wallet had
been found and asked if she wanted to deac
tivate her ATM card, Niemeyer said. When
Kang told the man she had already deacti
vated her ATM card, the man asked a cou
ple more questions and then terminated the
phone call, Niemeyer said.
"He tried to get her to give out her PIN
number," Niemeyer said. "If anyone calls
and poses as a bank or a police member, do
not give out your PIN number."
Niemeyer asked for students to be on the
lookout for the suspect. "If you know who
he is, you can call in confidentially," he
added. "If you see him, call 911 immediate

ly, because we would like to question him
and we have one witness who would be able
to identify him."
Freon exiles 3 Brannerites
A good-natured attempt at cleaning a
refrigerator turned gaseous for three Bran
ner freshmen yesterday afternoon when a
pipe burst, sending freon into their room.
Three fire trucks and two police cars came to
the scene.
Lisa Nagatoshi, Zenobia Austin and
Becky Zimmerman were taking turns ham
mering away ice which had enveloped the
top portion of the refrigerator's freezer
when they broke the pipe.
"I was just chipping away at it," Zimmer
man said. "All of a sudden this stuff comes
spurting out."
The three evacuated their room and went
to a nearby room to call 911.
"The amount of freon which leaked was
minimal," said Raul Ponce, a Facilities
supervisor. "You just have to open your win
dows and get out of the room."
The refrigerator was removed from the
room to prevent the carpet from getting wet,
he said.
