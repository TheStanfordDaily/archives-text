The Santa Clara County District At
torney's office filed charges of grand
theft and insufficient funds yesterday
against a computer consultant who al
legedly stole a total of $20,232 from
Stanford.
Eldy Nodal, a computer consultant
hired by Stanford Instructional Televi
sion Network (SITN), allegedly used
several means to approve money pay
ments to her through Stanford's Ac
counts Payable division, the branch of
the University which cuts checks.
According to the police report,
Nodal forged the initials of Imelda
Oropeza, publications editor for SITN
and Nodal's immediate supervisor, and

the words "OK to pay" on seven invoic
es.
Four other invoices contained no
initials but had the words "OK to pay"
forged by Nodal, the report stated. Ac
counts Payable made payments on
each of these invoices, as well as on two
additional invoices which lacked writ
ten or initialed authorization for pay
ment to Nodal.
Another invoice, which contained
no written authorization, was later ap
proved via telephone by Saundramal
Onabajo, SITN purchasing assistant.
Steve Jung, an audit manager for Stan
ford's Internal Audit department, said
Onabajo did not have the authority to
approve these payments, according to
the police report.
Onabajo did not return phone calls

yesterday.
In the last allegedly illegal payment,
Nodal sent an e-mail message to Ac
counts Payable in which she autho
rized payment for one invoice to her
self.
"She quite clearly approved her own
payment," Stanford Police Detective
Mark Swineford said. "And Accounts
Payable paid her for this."
Jung supplied the police with most
of the invoice information, the report
stated. He also told police that payment
of any invoice without the presence of
an authorized agent's approval is in vi
olation of the University's regular
business practice.
The primary control that Accounts
Payable uses to determine if an invoice
should be paid is the invoice's number,

Jung told police. As long as no two in
voices share the same number, each
will be processed, the report stated.
Jung was out of town yesterday and
could not be reached for comment.
"We have procedures, several differ
ent ones, for different things and it is a
very complicated process," said Nile
Jones, manager of Accounts Payable.
"We do have a very solid, systematic
procedure for making payments.
"I don't know what happened in this
case," Jones added.
According to the police report,
Nodal was hired by the University to do
computer consulting through her com
pany, LDN Computer Consultant, in
November 1993. Oropeza hired her to
