### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
The Santa Clara County District At
torney's office filed charges of grand
theft and insufficient funds yesterday
against a computer consultant who al
legedly stole a total of $20,232 from
Stanford.
Eldy Nodal, a computer consultant
hired by Stanford Instructional Televi
sion Network (SITN), allegedly used
several means to approve money pay
ments to her through Stanford's Ac
counts Payable division, the branch of
the University which cuts checks.
According to the police report,
Nodal forged the initials of Imelda
Oropeza, publications editor for SITN
and Nodal's immediate supervisor, and

the words "OK to pay" on seven invoic
es.
Four other invoices contained no
initials but had the words "OK to pay"
forged by Nodal, the report stated. Ac
counts Payable made payments on
each of these invoices, as well as on two
additional invoices which lacked writ
ten or initialed authorization for pay
ment to Nodal.
Another invoice, which contained
no written authorization, was later ap
proved via telephone by Saundramal
Onabajo, SITN purchasing assistant.
Steve Jung, an audit manager for Stan
ford's Internal Audit department, said
Onabajo did not have the authority to
approve these payments, according to
the police report.
Onabajo did not return phone calls

yesterday.
In the last allegedly illegal payment,
Nodal sent an e-mail message to Ac
counts Payable in which she autho
rized payment for one invoice to her
self.
"She quite clearly approved her own
payment," Stanford Police Detective
Mark Swineford said. "And Accounts
Payable paid her for this."
Jung supplied the police with most
of the invoice information, the report
stated. He also told police that payment
of any invoice without the presence of
an authorized agent's approval is in vi
olation of the University's regular
business practice.
The primary control that Accounts
Payable uses to determine if an invoice
should be paid is the invoice's number,

Jung told police. As long as no two in
voices share the same number, each
will be processed, the report stated.
Jung was out of town yesterday and
could not be reached for comment.
"We have procedures, several differ
ent ones, for different things and it is a
very complicated process," said Nile
Jones, manager of Accounts Payable.
"We do have a very solid, systematic
procedure for making payments.
"I don't know what happened in this
case," Jones added.
According to the police report,
Nodal was hired by the University to do
computer consulting through her com
pany, LDN Computer Consultant, in
November 1993. Oropeza hired her to
do consulting for SITN.
Nodal worked for SITN, main
ly in their offices, from Novem
ber 1993 until July 1994, the
report stated. To receive pay
ment, she submitted her invoices
to Oropeza for processing and
payment. According to the
report, SITN opened a blanket
purchase order account with the
Accounts Payable department to
pay the invoices Nodal submit
ted.
The report stated that Nodal
terminated her work at Stanford
near the middle of July 1994.
saving her son was severely ill.

On Aug. 3, 1994, Oropeza
received a credit memo from
LDN Computer Consultant
which stated that the company
had inadvertently faxed two
invoices directly to Accounts
Payable which had been paid.
The memo stated that there was
a credit balance of $5,696 on the
account and that a refund check
would be sent after 120 days,
according to the report.
Oropeza informed Wray Brett,
administrative services manager
for SITN, about the possible
overpayment and it was decided
that Nodal would be contacted
immediately. According to the
report, Oropeza contacted Nodal
and requested an immediate
refund. Nodal said a check would
be sent that day.

Brett refused to comment on
the case.
On Aug. 9, 1994, SITN
received a check for the amount
of $6,416, which was a refund for
three invoices. In September,
SITN was informed that the
check had been returned unpaid
because of insufficient funds in
Nodal's account, the report stat
ed.
After Brett contacted Nodal,
Nodal sent a letter to SITN stat
ing that LDN Computer Consul
tant was unable to pay due to a
possible bankruptcy, the report
stated. For this infringement,
she is being charged with insuffi
cient funds, a type of fraud.
A warrant has been issued for
Nodal's arrest.
"I have not been able to make

contact with her as of yet, but I
have made contact with her fam
ily," Swineford said. "My hope is
that we will be able to make
arrangements for her to come in
and surrender."
Swineford also said that,
based on the financial records he
has, the funds paid to Nodal by
Stanford have all been spent.
Although the University was
paying Nodal for her work,
Oropeza told the police there was
no written contract between the
University and Nodal's company.
According to University Gen
eral Counsel Michael Roster,
Stanford usually wants some
type of documentation of con
tracted work. "There usually
should be some kind of written
arrangement," Roster said.
