# Focusing on energy and environment
## New group emphasizes ways to create change at Stanford 
### Nikita Agrawal 
Students, faculty and administrators
explored ways to promote energy effi
ciency and reduce utilities costs through
"green" architectural design at the first
Stanford Energy and Environment
Forum yesterday afternoon.
The objective of the forum, which fea
tured architect Alan Short as keynote

speaker, is to improve environmental
soundness and energy efficiency of the
University through exchanges of infor
mation and ideas.
"SEEF is a great way to create some
dialogue between faculty, students and
administration. It's one way in which
students can channel their energies into
the environment and make sure that
their voices are heard," senior Tanya

Chan, the forum's co-chair, told the
gathering of about 30 in Tresidder's Oak
East Lounge.
"We want to bring out issues of how
Stanford can conserve energy and lessen
the impact on the natural environment,"
Chan said, adding that planners hope to
hold additional forums in the future.
