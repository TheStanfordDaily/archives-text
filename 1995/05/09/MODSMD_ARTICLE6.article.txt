# Focusing on energy and environment
## New group emphasizes ways to create change at Stanford 
### Nikita Agrawal 
Students, faculty and administrators
explored ways to promote energy effi
ciency and reduce utilities costs through
"green" architectural design at the first
Stanford Energy and Environment
Forum yesterday afternoon.
The objective of the forum, which fea
tured architect Alan Short as keynote

speaker, is to improve environmental
soundness and energy efficiency of the
University through exchanges of infor
mation and ideas.
"SEEF is a great way to create some
dialogue between faculty, students and
administration. It's one way in which
students can channel their energies into
the environment and make sure that
their voices are heard," senior Tanya

Chan, the forum's co-chair, told the
gathering of about 30 in Tresidder's Oak
East Lounge.
"We want to bring out issues of how
Stanford can conserve energy and lessen
the impact on the natural environment,"
Chan said, adding that planners hope to
hold additional forums in the future.
A vital goal of the forum was to
encourage the University to inte
grate energy and environmental
concerns into decision-making
processes. According to Chan,
students hoping to incorporate
environmentally sound — or
"green" — designs into the devel
opment and construction of the
new Science and Engineering
Quad planned a forum to explore
related issues.
"The new quad is a wonderful
opportunity for Stanford to
become an environmental leader
by building an energy-efficient
and environmentally friendly
complex," Chan said.
Planners of the forum recog
nized that they were not working
in a vacuum. Current University
efforts to institute energy-effi
cient technologies for lighting,
heating, cooling and water sys
tems in existing campus buildings
are being led by the Stanford
Total Energy Management pro
gram.
The program is a campus-wide
initiative geared toward improv
ing the efficiency of utility gener
ation, distribution and use,
according to Susan Kulakowski,
utilities energy management
coordinator.
"Stanford University has
adopted the idea of being a total
energy manager. The goal of our
program is to recapture valuable
financial resources that are wast
ed in excessive utility costs,"
Kulakowski said.
According to Kulakowski, utili

ty costs are approximately $32 to
$33 million. "These are costs that
we need to reduce by proactively
managing the utility system.
Wasteful expenses take away
from resources that should be
going to academics and research,"
she said.
After conducting walk
throughs and audits of campus
buildings, the program proposes
modifications — such as lighting
and other energy retrofits — that
increase savings and lower energy
consumption.
Energy-efficient retrofits are
investments that pay back in
three-and-a-half years or result in
a 14 percent yield, Kulakowski
stated. "This is a smart invest
ment for Stanford because it has
the added benefit of being cost
effective and environmentally
sound without sacrificing occu
pant comfort."
Allowing Stanford students to
develop real-world applications of
energy-efficient technologies and
economies by using Stanford as a
microcosm of the larger world is
the focus of Biology Prof. Stephen
Schneider's Earth Systems 179
class, which was discussed at the
forum. Students research and
propose ways to eliminate energy
inefficiencies on campus.
"It is essential to introduce
students to the nature of these
environmental design problems
and the subsequent societal
challenges in overcoming them,
because they will have to deal
with them later in the future.
By examining problems on a
micro-level, hopefully we can
reach some conclusions about
macro-level efficiency," Schnei
der said.
