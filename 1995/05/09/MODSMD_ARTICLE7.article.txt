# Cost cuts at NASA may help Stanford
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
A new NASA plan to cut costs
through outsourcing research
projects may result in increased
space research at Stanford and
possibly a NASA-Stanford re
search institute.
According to Michael Mar
laire, chief of external affairs at
NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, this option is
being discussed as part of an on
going effort to streamline costs.
"There is a possibility that the
space research program could
evolve into something involving
Stanford and the University of
California, culminating in an in
stitute of some sort," he said.
Marlaire emphasized that
NASA and University adminis
trators are only in preliminary
contact, saying that "it is prema
ture to comment" on what sort of
relationship might be formed.
"Discussions are underway,"
said Larry Horton, University di
rector of government and com
munity relations. The issue of
outsourcing Ames' research is "a
very complicated matter," he
said. "It'll take a while for things
to work out."
According to Thursday's San
Francisco Chronicle, this most
recent budget-cutting proposal
would nullify NASA's earlier
plans to eliminate research at
Ames. NASA is attempting to cut
$5 billion from its $14 billion bud
get in an effort to placate a tight-
fisted Congress and keep that body
from cutting the space agency's
budget on its own, the Chronicle
reported
"NASA, as well as all federal
agencies, is under heavy scrutiny
by Congress" and is looking for
new ways to do things and be more
efficient, Horton said.
However, any institute created

by Ames and Stanford would be
"funded primarily by NASA," said
Marlaire.
The report which outlines
NASA's new plan cited the Ames
staff's "unique, world-class experi
ence" in space research, according
to the Chronicle.
Ames' scientists are research
ing topics such as the origins of
solar systems and the conditions
needed for human existence in
space. The center is also noted for
its wind tunnels, used to aid
designers in creating high-tech

new aircraft.
A joint Stanford-NASA insti
tute would do "the same kind of
space work ... the whole gamut of
the space program," said Marlaire.
The latest budget-reduction
proposal is still not definite. A
NASA spokesman told the Chroni
cle that this report is "pre-decision
al."
While discussions are continu
ing between Stanford and NASA,
Horton said that "they're just dis
cussions. You can't read anything
into them."
