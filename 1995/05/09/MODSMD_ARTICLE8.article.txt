# Shooting Star theater plays for sake of kids
## New group will perform at local schools 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
"Dear Danny. I liked your
show and I want you to come
again. I learned that when some
one needs help, help them. Even
if you are scared you need to try
to help someone and maybe
someday they will help you. Love,
Jessie, Grade 1."
Letters like these are precious
to sophomore Danny Zeibert,
who has saved them since high
school, when he directed his first
children's theater.
Wanting to bring such enthu
siasm to the Farm, Zeibert estab
lished The Shooting Star Travel
ing Children's Theater early fall
quarter. After five months of
practicing, painting and publiciz
ing, the theater raised its curtain
Saturday in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um to take young children on

"An Enchanted Journey."
The group is scheduled to per
form its play at 15 schools
around Stanford this spring, in
cluding schools in East Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Los Altos. Mem
bers opened their season with a
show at the Community Carni
val on Florence Moore Field on
April 22.
It is obvious the children love
Zeibert's shows. They scream,
cheer and move five feet closer to
the stage when the monster cap
tures the hero. Zeibert said he
can definitely sense "excitement
in the air."
Zeibert said he set high stan
dards for himself and the cast.
"We really want to present shows
with the highest artistic quality
to show what theater can be," he
said. "We want to get kids excit
ed, not only about theater, but

about learning, too."
Zeibert added that the group's
purpose is two fold. Not only do
members want to introduce local
children to theater but they also
see this as an opportunity to draw
surrounding communities into
Stanford.
"We want to incorporate stu
dents, activities and the communi
ty," said sophomore Molly Billings,
the group's head administrator.
By performing the play on cam
pus as well as at local schools, the
group wants "to draw the commu
nity to Stanford with their kids,
and then they will be more likely to
come see other groups' shows,"
Billings added.

"It is like two different worlds
between Stanford and the sur
rounding community," Zeibert
said. "We want to get people in the
community excited about what's
going on at Stanford, for the sake
of all groups."
The play's villain, sophomore
Gautam Deshpande, said the the
ater group helps showcase Stan
ford's abilities. "Stanford has such
a well spring of talent. This brings
that to surrounding schools and
the community," he said.
Deshpande added that he
enjoys performing for children,
particularly since the play allows
some of the actors to interact with
the kids and some scenes take
place off the stage, right in front
of the audience. At crucial points
in the play, certain characters ask
the children questions like, "How
do I get out of this problem?"

according to Deshpande.
"It feels a little more comfort
able acting for kids," he said.
"They're not expecting realism so
you can have a little more fun
with your character. You can be
playful. Older students expect
something more rigid."
Though full of chase scenes,
sword fights and a damsel in dis
tress, "An Enchanted Journey" is
not an ordinary fairy tale. Rewrit
ten by Zeibert and other group
members, this fairy tale is defi
nitely one of the '90s.
Zeibert described how the
princess has "a lot of spunk and
tricks the giant."
In painting the backdrops,
freshman Ivana Lee, one of the
show's head artists, said, "We
tried to make it more ethnic. It is
not just a picturesque fairy tale in
the Old English sense," describ

ing a piece of her handiwork, the
Chicana fairy.
Designed to look like a story
book, the scenery consists of sev
eral 8-by-20-foot boards which
open like pages. "Painting was a
formidable task to begin with
because you saw these huge,
white canvases," Lee said.
"I had a lot of help, though, so
it took shape really fast," she
added.
Though the group failed to get
its special fee in last month's
ASSU election, members said
they hope to perform three plays
next year. Zeibert also said he will
be looking for new members for
the group.
"We really want to get as many
people involved as possible," Zeib
ert said. "Everyone is made to
feel welcome. It is a very welcom
ing atmosphere."
