A collection of personal papers
belonging to the late Pulitzer
Prize-winning author and English
Prof. Emeritus Wallace Stegner
recently left Stanford for the Uni
versity of Utah.
Stanford relinquished the col
lection late last month, in accor
dance with Stegner's wishes.
According to Director of Special
Collections Margaret Kimball,
Stegner decided 10 years ago to
leave his personal papers to the
University of Utah, where he at
tended college as an undergradu
ate.
"We all tried to change his
mind, but this was a decision that
was made a decade ago," said Bill
McPheron, a curator at Stanford
Libraries.
Stegner — who taught writing
at Stanford for 26 years and start
ed the Stegner Fellowship Pro
gram in 1956 — died in May 1993
as the result of injuries from an au
tomobile accident in Arizona.
Stegner was the author of 16
volumes of fiction and a number of
essays and works of non-fiction.
His novel "Angle of Repose" —
which tells of a man who research
es his pioneer origins in order to
come to terms with his own trou
bles — won the 1972 Pulitzer
Prize for fiction.
The collection of Stegner's per
sonal papers — which includes 40
years of correspondence between
Stegner and his agent, letters to
and from former students, diaries
and several manuscripts — was
never given to Stanford but was in
stead only "on deposit here," Kim
ball said.
However, Stanford still has a
smaller collection of Stegner's pa
pers, including source materials
for two of his books and materials
related to his students in the Cre
ative Writing Program.
"There is still a Stegner collec
tion at Stanford," Kimball said.
"Researchers will have to work
with the materials here, as well as
those at the University of Utah."
She noted that the University of
lowa also holds some of Stegner's
papers.
Kimball expressed regret at the
loss of the Stegner collection. "I'm
sorry to see the collection split up.

We did know it was coming
though," Kimball said. "The loss
is unfortunate, but it is also nice
that Stegner's desire for his
papers to go to Utah was ful
filled. ... He felt a very strong
connection to Utah."
English Prof. Ron Rebholz
agreed. "I'm terribly disappointed
about the loss. This is a big loss
for the future," he said, noting
that "people will definitely study
Stegner in the future because he
is truly a great writer."
He added that researchers can
gain valuable insight on the
author's style and intention by
studying revisions in Stegner's
manuscripts.
