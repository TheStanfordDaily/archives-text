## Stanford College Republicans thrown out of state convention for forging signatures 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Despite the largest turnout
ever by a Stanford College
Republican delegation at a
statewide convention, the Stan
ford contingent was disquali
fied from voting during a cru
cial election at a recent conven
tion in Irvine.
Representatives voted on
April 29 that Stanford had
forged membership documents
and should be disqualified from
electing the state chair.
The California College
Republican board discovered
that Stanford had reported 500
members, far more than the
actual membership of 200,
according to club president
Adam Ross. However, while
the convention alleged that the
Stanford organization misled
the convention in order to
increase its votes for the chair,
Ross said no one from the
group submitted the extra sig
natures.
"In one instance, some came
from the phone book," said
Adam Butera, a sophomore at
Cal State-Sacramento who
attended the convention. "Only
three people filled in the
names," he said, basing his
argument on similar handwrit
ing and the same pen for
repeated signatures.
However, the reason for the
controversy and subsequent
alliances may have been the
vast amount of politicking
which took place before and
during the convention.
Ross said that when he
spoke before the entire conven
tion to defend his group the
alliances were based on politics,
mostly between the supporters
of chair candidates Steve Lesh
er of USC and Rezwan Pavri of
UCLA.
"This entire thing was very
political," Ross said. "This was
completely, 100 percent politi
cally motivated. We did nothing
wrong. Neither I nor anyone in
the Stanford College Republi

cans submitted any of these
'extra membership forms.'
"I don't know where they got
these forms although I certain
ly have some suspicions," Ross
said. However, he refused to
elaborate on who may have sub
mitted the extra members.
"There was a team of [Col
lege Republicans] led by Steve
Lesher who were running and
they had the endorsement of
Stanford," said Tim Galvin,
administrative vice president of
the Stanford College Republi
cans. "It's the belief of many
people it was that group that
did the forgeries to increase
Stanford'B membership."
Lesher, who ultimately lost
to Pavri, paid the hotel and
transportation costs for Stan
ford and approximately 20
other delegations.
Butera agreed that insider
factions play a meyor role with
in the College Republicans.
"There was definitely that feel
ing within the convention ... of
are you moderate or are you
conservative?"
California College Republi
can rules state that a delegation
receives one vote for every 10 of
its members.
Thirty-two Stanford stu
dents attended the conven
tion. When the state board dis
covered the discrepancy, it
penalized the Stanford group
so that the number of voters
was decreased by 70 percent to
17.
"I was not going to stand for
our club getting smeared for
doing nothing wrong," Ross
said. "I stood up (before the
entire convention) and chal
lenged the board's ruling which
arbitrarily cut our delegate
power by 70 percent."
After he was "essentially
told to leave the stage," Ross
said someone in the audience
moved to expel the Stanford
delegation from the conven
tion. The motion passed and
Stanford lost all voting privi
leges.
