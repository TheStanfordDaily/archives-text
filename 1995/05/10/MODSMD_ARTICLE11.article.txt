## US, Russia to talk NATO 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - With Rus
sia unlikely to cancel a nuclear
deal with Iran or halt its crack
down in Chechnya, President
Clinton looked to Boris Yeltsin
for a face-saving summit agree
ment to strengthen Moscow's
ties with NATO.
Despite the chill over their
differences, Yeltsin gave Clinton
a warm Kremlin greeting yester
day, heartily embracing the
president as he arrived for a cel
ebration of the 50th anniversary
of the defeat of Nazi Germany.
"It's been so long, Bill," Yeltsin
exclaimed.
Although Clinton attended
some memorial ceremonies, he
pointedly boycotted a show of
Russian tanks, missile launchers
and other military hardware.
Aides said he did not want to
give any hint of support to Rus
sia's suppression of indepen
dence-minded Chechens.
The last time the two leaders
met was in December when
Yeltsin stunned Western leaders
in Budapest, Hungary, angrily

accusing them of trying to sow
seeds of mistrust by expanding
NATO eastward toward Russia's
borders. U.S. officials believe
Yeltsin may have softened his
views in recent weeks after
repeated U.S. assurances that
NATO poses no threat to Russia.
"We hope, of course, that
there's going to be progress, but
I can't say we expect it," State
Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns said. "It is entirely up to
the two of them."
Nevertheless, Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and
Russian Foreign Minister
Andrei Kozyrev will bore into
the NATO problem today when
Clinton and Yeltsin meet.
At an elegant dinner in the
Grand Kremlin Palace, Clinton
urged Yeltsin to act in tandem
with the United States.
"With Russia's turn to democ
racy, the alliance for freedom
stands on the verge of great new
possibility," Clinton said.
"Together, we can face vistas of
promise which separately we

could never even imagine."
The heirs to the World War II
victory also face tough chal
lenges, Clinton said, among
them terrorism, proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and
"killing based on ethnic, reli
gious or tribal differences."
In talks with British Prime
Minister John Major, Yeltsin
underscored Russian worries
about enlarging NATO and
urged the alliance not to move
too fast. Yeltsin's policy adviser,
Dmitry Ryurikov, said the Rus
sian leader remarked that
"events shouldn't be pressed,
and a solution should be found
which would suit the interests of
Europe, Russia and the whole
world."
Struggling to get relations
back on track, Clinton paid
solemn tribute to the 27 million
Soviets killed in World War 11.
Today's session at the Krem
lin marks the sixth meeting
between Clinton and Yeltsin in
over nearly two-and-a-half
years.
