KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) - Sol
diers blocked routes into a city of
600,000 that was placed under
quarantine yesterday after more
than 100 people died of a mysteri
ous disease that may be caused by
one of the world's deadliest viruses.
A consultant for the World

Health Organization said the Ebola
virus was responsible for the
deaths. The U.S. Centers for Dis
ease Control and Prevention said it
was sending a team of investigators
equipped with protective suits and
respirators immediately, in cooper
ation with the World Health Orga

nization.
"With the little we know, we're
going to have to assume that this
could be Biosafety Level 4," the
highest level of concern of infection,
said Dr. Rima Khabbaz, an infec
tious disease specialist at the cen
ters.
