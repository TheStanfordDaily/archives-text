# Republicans introduce budget

WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate Republicans
unveiled their long-promised plan to balance the
budget yesterday, proposing big savings in Medi
care, anti-poverty efforts, mass transit and scores of
other programs.
Senate Budget Committee Chair Pete Domenici, R-
N.M., presented his plan half a year after the GOP
seized control of Congress on a campaign pledge to end
_ relentless federal deficits. His proposal claims to trans
form this year's $175 billion shortfall into a $2 billion
surplus by 2002 — the first time since 1969 that the
government's ledger would emerge from the red.

To get there, Domenici would reduce projected
spending by an unprecedented $961 billion over the
next seven years. Two-thirds of the savings would
come from Medicare, Medicaid and other benefit
programs like welfare and aid to farmers and veter
ans. Most of the rest would come from general gov
ernment programs ranging from road building to
judges' salaries, and from the resulting drop in
interest payments on federal borrowing.
More than 100 programs would be eliminated,
including the Commerce Department and President
Clinton's national service program.
