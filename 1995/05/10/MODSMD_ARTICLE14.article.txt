Security tightened
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Secret Service
closed down the lane of traffic on Pennsylvania
Avenue nearest the White House late yesterday
afternoon in the most visible tightening of presi
dential security since the Oklahoma City bomb
ing.
"One lane of Pennsylvania Avenue is being
closed down," said Secret Service Spokesman
David Adams. "I can't get into any particulars of
why it is being done. We do not discuss security
measures at the White House."
Asked if the shutdown of the lane is permanent
or temporary, Adams said: "It's a strong, perma
nent, temporary shutdown."
The Secret Service and the White House
emphasized that the entire street is not being
closed at this time.
The lane on the south side of the avenue was
closed with a long procession of wooden barri
cades hung with streamers of yellow plastic tape.
The permanent closing of all six lanes of Penn
sylvania Avenue in front of the executive mansion
is a central recommendation of a draft report of
the panel that has been reviewing White House
security.

John Doe 2 a child?
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) â€” In a strange turn in
the Oklahoma bombing, the FBI is investigating
whether the person in the sketch of John Doe 2 is
the husky 12-year-old son of a key figure in the case.
There has been no suggestion that the boy,
Josh Nichols, had any part in the bombing.
Rather, FBI agents want to know if he was with
Timothy McVeigh in Junction City, Kan., when
McVeigh rented the truck allegedly used in the
attack two days later, a source close to his family
told The Associated Press yesterday.
A law enforcement source in Washington con
firmed that "some investigators think there is a
fair chance that (Terry) Nichols' son Josh was at
the rental office in Junction City when the truck
was rented."
McVeigh is the only person charged in the
bombing. Terry Nichols is being held in Kansas as
a material witness and faces separate charges of
conspiracy to make small bombs in Michigan.
Jim Donahue, who hired Terry Nichols as a ranch
hand at his Kansas farm last year, described Josh as
"a pretty husky kid," strong for his age, with a flat
top haircut. But Donahue said he doubted whether
Josh could be the person depicted in the sketch.
