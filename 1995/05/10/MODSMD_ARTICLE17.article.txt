Although Stanford has
already announced the cre
ation of its new program in
comparative studies in race and
ethnicity, there are still a lot of
details that need to be hammered
out.
Two committees composed of
students and faculty have been
chartered to design curricula for the
Asian-American Studies and Chi
cano Studies components of the
new program, which could start
accepting mtyors as early as next
winter quarter. The committees are
meeting for the first time this week.
Although the committees have
not received specific instructions
from Humanities and Sciences
Dean John Shoven, they should
remember that the major was cre
ated to compare different cultures
and ethnicities, not to study one
race in particular. As they ponder
how to formulate aspects of the
new program, committee members
should try to stay close to this ideal.

History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, a
member of the Chicano Studies
committee, explained it well: The
comparative focus of the new pro
gram "is the future of ethnic stud
ies in this country."
This is not to say that the pro
gram should not include courses
that focus on just one ethnicity; it
most certainly should. However,
students who major in comparative
studies in race and ethnicity should
be strongly encouraged to take as
many courses as possible that
extend beyond their stated focus.
The comparative studies pro
gram has the potential to keep
Stanford on the cutting edge of
American academia since it is a
unique idea that could eventually
widen into other areas, like the
social sciences.
Before that happens, the two
committees need to lay a strong
foundation; they would do that best
by focusing on the comparative
aspects of the proposed program.
