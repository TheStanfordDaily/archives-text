# Joining committees
## 
### 
HOW WOULD you like to rub
elbows with Casper, Condi or
the Board of Trustees? As
students, most of us have little
opportunity to have our opinions
heard by the bigwigs of this Univer
sity. However, more than 100 stu
dents every year have the chance to
actually make a difference from the
top down. How? By joining a Univer
sity committee.
The ASSU is currently accepting
student committee membership
applications for the 1995-96 aca
demic year, but the deadline to apply
is approaching fast — this Friday.
A variety of committees have
positions available to both under
graduate and graduate students.
Some of them meet with the Board
of Trustees, some with the Academ
ic Council and some with the Deans
of Humanities and Sciences or Stu
dent Affairs. They deal with issues
ranging from the direction of CIV to
the treatment of laboratory animals.
On a committee, students may help

influence the future of Residential
Education, distribution require
ments, athletics, Tresidder Union,
overseas studies and more.
While these committees will most
likely reward their members with an
excellent opportunity to help shape
University policies, it is important
that students seriously evaluate
their time commitments for next
year before they apply. R6sum6
packers should look elsewhere. Uni
versity committee appointments
carry with them a huge responsibili
ty to the students.
Student representation is vitally
important to the functioning of the
committees and should hopefully
work towards a better atmosphere
for all students on campus. Students
on committees should be willing to
solicit input from fellow students
and should regularly share the infor
mation they collect with the admin
istrators and faculty members.
If you want to make a difference,
apply now.
