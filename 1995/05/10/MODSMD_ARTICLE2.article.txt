With chants including "Western Lodgingyou're
no good, treat your workers like you should" and
"Don't check in, check out," about 40 people, in
cluding nearly 20 Stanford students, protested and
picketed outside of the Stanford Park Hotel yester
day evening.
The demonstrators were protesting in support
of a recent labor dispute at the Lafayette Park
Hotel, where similar protests have occurred.
The Western Lodging Group — which owns
both the Stanford Park and Lafayette Park Hotels

— is currently engaged in a quarrel with workers
at its Lafayette site in the East Bay. No employees
from the Stanford Park Hotel were among yester
day's protesters.
Three employees — all recently fired from the
Lafayette hotel — claim they were laid off because
they tried to establish a union. The Lafayette Park
Hotel just hired the American Consulting Group to
help resolve its conflict with its employees.

the activities of the Western
Lodging Group.
"I am out here giving support
to the workers," said Jim Keck,
the president of the United Stan
ford Workers. M I know how these
union-busting companies work —
they pick on small groups, usual
ly consisting of minorities."
Keck, who said his wife, a trav
el agent, told him that the Stan
ford Park Hotel charges outra
geous room rates, is angry that
"they don't want to share any
thing with their workers."
Most of the Stanford students
in the picket lines were members
of either the Chicano / Latino stu
dent group MEChA or the newly
created Resistance Action orGa
nizing Education (RAGE).
"We believe in social equality
and this here is discrimination,"

said co-chair of MEChA Felipe
Barragan, a sophomore. "Our
organization endorses this
protest."
Jim DuPont, president of the
hotel union, was also in the picket
lines. "The Western Lodging
Group has engaged in illegal
activities, such as bribing workers
to not organize a union and
threaten ones who did," DuPont
said.
However, David Issel, the gen
eral manager of the Stanford
Park Hotel, said he did not under
stand the reasons for the picket.
"The dispute is not with us. The
Stanford Park Hotel is equitable
with its workers," he said.
"I don't think the picketers
know anything about our employ
ees and what we do and don't do,"
Issel said.
Sophomore Eron Danziger,
who was at the protest, said he
believed in workers' rights. "The
hotel should stop putting profits
above people," he said.
