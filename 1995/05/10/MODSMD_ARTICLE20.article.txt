## Human nature's dark side 
### 
WHAT MAKES HUMAN beings
good or evil? This is a question
which people have been asking
for centuries, so I certainly won't
attempt to give a definitive answer in the
small space which I occupy here. But cer
tain events of the past weeks have put
this question in the forefront of my
thoughts, the most obvious case being
the Oklahoma City bombing.
This bombing has captured the hearts
and minds of people around the globe, due
to the unexplainable savagery and lack of
compassion which the perpetrators
demonstrated to their victims. We are all
wondering right now how anybody could
take the lives of innocent children and
employees of the federal government.
There have been vague connections to the
militia movement and a hatred towards
the federal government but the question
still remains: How could a man like Tim
othy McVeigh load that truck with explo
sives with the sole intention of taking
dozens of innocent human lives?
Coinciding with the Oklahoma bomb
ing were reports of continued atrocities
and "ethnic cleansing" in Rwanda and
Bosnia, where citizens of the same coun
tries are hacking each other to death
with machetes or interning each other in
concentration camps. At this point it
appears that there is no apparent solu
tion to these conflicts, as the hatred and
resentment run too deep for any rational
diplomatic agreement.

After hearing reports of these stories
on the news every night, I often wonder if
my worst fears about human nature are
true. Maybe people are inherently evil, or
at least extremely selfish and self-cen
tered. Maybe if given the opportunity, a
person will always take advantage of
another person who is placed in a subor
dinate position in society, such as in a
scapegoated ethnic group.
The 50th anniversary of the liberation
of Dachau has just occurred, reminding
the world of the horror of Nazi Germany.
Once again we are asking ourselves how
an atrocity of such magnitude could have
been perpetrated by Hitler and his
henchmen. And how could the German
population as a whole acquiesce to the
Holocaust which was happening right in
front of them? Those of us in the United
States would like to think that institu
tionalized mass murder such as that
could never happen here, that it was
some genetic or historical proclivity in
the German people in general which led
them to ignore the actions of their gov
ernment and their compatriots and allow
the Holocaust to take place.
I hate to admit it, but I don't agree
with that view. The events in Germany
or Rwanda or Bosnia may seem like exot
ic, far-away problems to those of us on
the insulated Stanford campus, but they
are much more related to our own lives
than we might like to think. Regardless
of what nationality they are, these people

are still members of the human race, just
like ourselves. They still eat, they still
sleep, they still search for meaning in
their lives.
But of course we all think, "I would
never take a machete and hack my neigh
bor to pieces" or "I would never allow an
entire ethnic group to be annihilated by
my own government." The Rwandans
and the Serbians probably used to think
the same thing. Can you honestly believe
that if you grew up in a volatile society
such as that of a Rwandan village that
the conditions of your life might not lead
you to participate in the carnage which is
happening there?
We found to our horror last month
that America is not immune from sense
less acts of violence and murder. I hope
that our own country is not heading
down the road to a society controlled by
the mob and the people with the most
guns. I hope that the growth of the mili
tia movement is not an indicator of a
more violent and volatile period to come.
Maybe this new round of violence will
teach us something. But unfortunately,
history has proven time and time again
that we don't learn from our past mis
takes. For once in my life, I hope I'll be
proven wrong.

Until now, Amanda has never been
wrong.
