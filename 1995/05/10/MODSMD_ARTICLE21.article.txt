Tradition is more than a mascot and a marching band

WE WERE SADDENED by Seth
Goldstein's recent column enti
tled "Problems in our athletic
tradition" which blamed Stanford's nick
name, mascot and band for an allegedly
weak athletic tradition. It wasn't the
petty whining that hurt, but the
appalling disregard for the true meaning
of Stanford athletics. Anyone who choos
es to complain about insignificant
aspects of Stanford's athletic tradition
rather than acknowledge the sizable con
tributions of all of our teams obviously
does not understand what Stanford
sports are really about.
For whatever reason, Mr. Goldstein
chose to blame secondary aspects of
Stanford athletics for a weak athletic
tradition. This is an unfounded, not to
mention rather imbecilic, criticism. Look
at it from our perspective: While we
would criticize Mr. Goldstein's article as
being a sadly typical example of the sort
of hollow blustering one would expect

from an embittered high-school jock, we
would not cite it as the primary reason
for the supposed collapse of Stanford
journalism. Herein lies the difference
between Mr. Goldstein and the Band
(and, we suspect, a sizable number of
Stanford students).
Regarding the nickname "the Cardi
nal," Mr. Goldstein states: "It's hard to
heckle opposition players and fans ... I
have had a hard time getting fired up
about being part of the Cardinal." There
are countless fans who, unlike Mr. Gold
stein, have no trouble whatsoever "get
ting fired up" about our teams; they
appreciate the skill and teamwork dis
played by Stanford's athletes, and are
somehow able to overcome the tremen
dously huge obstacle presented by our
nickname. While we would prefer the
name "The Robber Barons" or "The
Fightin' Nachos," we realize that a
team's worth is not determined by its
nickname. As for heckling, we really

don't see what Stanford's moniker has
to do with Mr. Goldstein's ability to par
ticipate in that worthy spectator sport.
Maybe he needs lessons.
Mr. Goldstein reveals the truth about
Stanford's mascot in an almost Zen-like
fashion: "It's a tree. It's our mascot. It's a
tree." No shit, Seth. The Tree is a mascot.
Mascots are not real. In fact, they are
fake. What's more, they are goofy. All of
them. Do you really think fans would get
more fired up by a dancing bear? Or a
dog? A hamster, perhaps? Come on.
Repeat with us, Seth: "The Tree is a mas
cot. The Tree is not a real tree. It's OK if
it dances around. Bears don't really dance
around either. Only mascot bears. My
world view should not be affected by the
sort of silly dancing costumed person I
see on a basketball court."
Mr. Goldstein was right about the
Band, though. We suck. We're scum. But
luckily, he pointed it out to us in the
nick of time. It's not too late to change!

From now on, we will wear big hats,
punish mirth makers and play only the
USC fight song. That is, if we can learn
to play our instruments. Those three
notes are pretty hard.
We don't mind being criticized. Sure,
what Mr. Goldstein wrote about us was
obviously the product of a disease-addled
mind â€” but we can take it. It's all a
matter of image versus substance.
Apparently, Seth's definition of a strong
athletic tradition is one that has an
appropriate mascot (whatever fuzzy
creature that may be), a really grrr
macho-tough nickname and a traditional
marching band. Our definition includes
talented, hard-working athletes, loyal
fans and a band that does its best to pro
vide creative entertainment and support
for Stanford teams. Hmmmm. You be
the judge.
