# Antics get old when the less clever join in

### 
Many thanks to The Daily for the rare if
recent historical perspective on the Com
mencement hyinks. iJf you went further
back, into the antiquity of the late 1970s
when the ceremony was still held in Frost
Amphitheatre, you would find the speeches
were just as dull but the procession rather
more intimate and, er, dignified. Of course,
we weren't as smart then.
I assume, because the seniors are free to
frolic among themselves any day of the
year, that the real joy to the Wacky Walk is
performing in front of a captive audience.
Maybe someone should poll those prospec
tive spectators on the matter. Irreverence
often is funny until the less clever join the
act and then it gets old. A cohort of stu
dents rarely knows when to quit, leaving
everyone watching to endure an even more
tiresome ritual than what was leavened by

the irreverence to begin with.
I refer you to the Stanford Band on that
score.
