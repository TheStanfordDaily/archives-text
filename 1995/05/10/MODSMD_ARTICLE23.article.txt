# Union is boycotting Stanford Park Hotel
## 
### 
On April 1,1995,400 workers and sup
porters met to protest against the
Lafayette Park Hotel in Contra Costa
County. When the largely immigrant hotel
workers started a campaign to unionize,
Ellis Alden, the owner of the posh hotel,
hired a union-busting company, American
Consulting Group. TThe demonstrators
were protesting the firing of three hotel
workers, all active leaders in the organizing
drive to unionize. The hotel charged the
workers with theft. They were caught eat
ing leftover hotel food that otherwise
would have gone into the trash. Employees

say that eating leftovers was never a prob
lem with management before workers
became interested in unionizing and agents
from the union-busting firm were brought
onto the property.
In their attempts to unionize, the hotel
employees sought help from Local 2850,
the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees (HERE) union. HERE Local
2850 has filed unfair labor practice charges
against the hotel with the National Labor
Relations Board. Union organizers point
out the irony of a luxury hotel whose man
agement hires high-priced union-busters to
prevent impoverished, minimum-wage
workers from forming a union and bar
gaining collectively. They are currently in
the midst of a boycott against the Lafayette
Park Hotel as one way of applying pressure
on Alden.
Why should this concern the Stanford
community? Although there are many rea
sons, the most obvious is because in addi
tion to the Lafayette Park Hotel, Alden
owns the glamorous Stanford Park Hotel,

just a quarter of a mile away from our own
doors. Workers and union organizers have
launched a boycott of the Stanford Park
Hotel in order to increase pressure on
Alden and in protest of the similar condi
tions of workers here. The business of
destroying unions — invading people's
lives, demolishing friendships, crushing
people's wills and shattering families — is
not one which anyone should support or
tolerate.
People who want to get involved should:
Come meet with workers and union orga
nizers at an informational meeting next
Tuesday at 6 p.m. at the Asian American
Activities Center, actively boycott the Stan
ford Park Hotel and the Lafayette Park
Hotel and call them to let them know of
your decision; and inform your relatives
and friends of the situation and encourage
them to boycott Alden's hotels as well.
