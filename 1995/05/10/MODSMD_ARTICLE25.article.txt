Q: Why are there so many kinds of cheese?

A: After eating in Food Service for a year, you
start to think that cheese is a bright-orange,
plasticized polymer that tends to encrust
your food. However, before today's Cheez Whiz and
Easy-Cheese were developed, cheese enjoyed a long
and glorious history, proliferating into the thou
sands of varieties we eryoy today.
Before you find out how to make a specific type
of cheese, though, you need to know the fundamen
tal principles governing cheese making. Changes in
any of these steps allows the formation of the great
cheese spectrum.
Cheese making begins with milk, to which a
coagulating agent is added. This causes the solid
constituents of the milk (protein, fats, etc.) to sepa
rate out from the liquid. When the curd is separat
ed out, it is known as fresh cheese, and is basically

similar to cottage cheese or cream cheese.
Often, cheese is pressed to remove excess liquid,
then allowed to ripen. This is how you form solid
cheeses, such as cheddar, Swiss and Parmesan.
Ripening involves allowing the cheese to sit at a cer
tain temperature and humidity for a period of time
ranging from days to years. During this time,
numerous chemical processes are going on in your
cheese. Fats are broken down into fatty acids and
proteins are broken down into amino acids.
Interestingly, lactose, a milk sugar that much of
the population is allergic to, is almost completely
broken down after 20 days of ripening. As the lac
tose breaks down, it forms lactic acid and other
acids. These acids, in turn, act on the proteins in the
cheese, giving the proteins the smooth, solid form
characteristic of hard cheeses. Much of the flavor of
the cheese is produced at this stage as well, with the
release of volatile fatty acids, ketones, esters, pep
tides and even ammonia and hydrogen sulfide.
So along the way in this process, you get to make
the choices that determine what kind of cheese
you're going to get. First off, you get to choose the
kind of milk. Nonfat or whole? What kind of ani
mal? Cheese has been made from every mammal
including cows, goats, sheep, water buffalo, llamas,
horses and yaks.
You also get to choose the coagulating agent. If
milk sits out long enough, bacteria will start grow
ing which produce acid, that can cause coagulation
(this is how milk curdles). Some cheese is made by
adding such bacteria to the milk; these bacteria also
give distinctive flavor to the cheese and the acidity
keeps other microorganisms from proliferating.
You can also use various juices (lemon juice, for
example) or other extracts to provide this acidity.
Also commonly used is rennet, an extract
obtained from the fourth stomach of butchered
calves (how appealing). Rennet contains an enzyme,
rennin, that serves as the coagulating agent In fact,
it has been hypothesized that cheese was discovered
by early people who used animal stomachs as carry
ing vessels and found that their milk coagulated
when placed in this organic Tupperware.
The ripening process is affected by the time and
conditions of the aging, as well as the acidity, mois
ture and texture of the cheese. Microorganisms are
also often added at this stage to produce specific fla
vors. For example, Roquefort cheese is formed
when cheese is aged in a cool, wet atmosphere that
allows the proliferation of a specific type of blue
mold, giving it the marbled blue color.
String cheese is made by taking the cheese curd
in a big mass and stretching it out mechanically.
This causes all the protein molecules to line up
together and thus the cheese tears easily along this
line.
Then there's processed cheese. This starts with a
real cheese (believe it or not), which is melted down
and mixed with salts such as anhydrous sodium
phosphates and sodium citrates. These prevent the
separation of fat and protein, giving the cheese a
smoother texture. The cheese is then colored, and
other fillers are often added. The processed cheese
can then be poured into whatever container is need
ed, whether it be plastic wrap or an aerosol can.
You may be interested to know that cheddar
cheese is not naturally orange. I always figured the
orange color was a byproduct of the cheese-making
process. In fact, it is colored with annatto, the seed
from the tropical annatto tree, and an extract of
paprika. No one knows how this started, but it
stuck.
And, of course, now the cheese manufacturers
take advantage of this ... take some artificial
cheese product, color it fluorescent orange, and
everyone thinks it's real cheese.
