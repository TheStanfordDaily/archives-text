# Where there's smoke...
## Afters years of decrease, the number of smokers holds steady; doctors express concern 
### Prithika Balakrishnan Contributing writer 
A recent study by three researchers
at the University of Colorado Medical
School has shown that the number of
adult smokers in the United States
has remained static since 1990. At the
same time, the proportion of adoles
cents who smoke has changed little in
the last 10 years, where before it was
shrinking.
The study by Carl Bartecchi,
Thomas MacKenzie and Robert Schri
er in the May issue of Scientific Amer
ican also reports that due to the grow
ing demand for cigarettes in develop
ing countries, cigarette production has
increased at a higher rate than world
population growth, a pattern which is
projected to continue in the 19905.
The results of this recent study —
which used information from the Cen
ters for Disease Control — portray a
current situation in stark contrast to
the largely positive trends of the pre
ceding decades. In the early 19605,
medical research sparked public infor
mation campaigns and government
assessments of the dangers of tobacco,
leading to a significant drop in the
number of American smokers, from a
peak of 41 percent to the current level
of 25 percent.
Yet, despite the continuation of
medical evidence connecting smoking
with human diseases including can
cer, the trend of decreasing tobacco
consumption has dwindled.
Bartecchi, MacKenzie and Schrier
attribute this development in tobacco
consumption to "aggressive market
ing and permissive regulations."
Recent price wars between premium
and discount brands have also flat
tened the decline in cigarette use.
In the past, tobacco companies
were able to maintain a high profit
margin despite lower consumption
because smokers were willing to sacri
fice for their cravings. The addiction
of veteran customers allowed the
manufacturers to increase cigarette
prices at a rate outpacing inflation
with little fear of losing sales.
However, the rising popularity of
discount brands has made tobacco
cheaper and thus more accessible. The
market share of discount brands —
which make only five cents profit per
pack compared to 55 cents per brand
name pack — increased from 10 per
cent in 1987 to 36 percent in 1993,
causing a series of price cuts by major
brands.
According to the researchers' find
ings, low levels of government restric
tions have further helped stem the
decrease in smoking. There have been
few restrictions on the marketing of

tobacco in recent decades.
Most of the restrictions currently
placed on cigarette sales were institut
ed shortly after a surgeon general's
report in 1964 formally acknowledged
that smoking causes cancer and other
diseases. Current requirements for
warning labels on packages, restric
tions on advertisements directed at
people younger than 25 years and the
shift from television and radio adver
tisements to print media are all a
result of legislation passed three
decades ago.

All new attempts at instituting leg
islation concerning cigarettes have
failed. Since 1971, the United States
legislature has passed no further
restrictions on advertising. Instead,
tobacco companies have increased
expenditures on advertising fourfold
from 1975 to 1992, measured in con
stant U.S. dollars. For example, Philip
Morris, one of the two biggest tobacco
corporations in America, spends $2
billion on advertisements a year, more
than any other U.S. company.
Dramatic changes in how tobacco
companies advertise are also a poten

tial cause for stabilization of cigarette
use. The industry has begun to con
centrate on promotions, sponsorship
of sporting events and the distribution
of free cigarettes. Competitions such
as the Camel motocross and the Vir
ginia Slims tennis tournament are
widely televised and provide the tobac
co industry with a way out of the elec
tronic media advertising ban.
According to the research group,
"in the 93-minute broadcast of the
1989 Marlboro Grad Prix, the Marl
boro name flashed on the screen or

was mentioned by the announcers
5,933 times for a total of 46 minutes."
Tobacco companies have switched
their emphasis to minorities, women
and children, according to Bartecchi,
MacKenzie and Schrier — another
probable explanation for the stabiliz
ing of cigarette consumption among
youths and adults. The R.J. Reynolds
company's "Old Joe Camel" campaign
of 1988 especially targeted adoles
cents, increasing from 0.5 to 32 per
cent the proportion of teenage smok
ers who bought the Camel brand of
cigarette over the next two years.

On the whole, the medical com
munity — including the physicians
and scientists of Stanford Medical
School — have reacted to the stabi
lization of tobacco consumption with
dismay. Dr. Martin Brown, director
of Stanford's Cancer Biology Depart
ment, said he was "very surprised
and very shocked" at the
researchers' results.
"What disturbs me the most is that
smoking is once again being regarded
as a fashionable pursuit, especially
among the young white middle and

upper class," Brown said.
The research by Bartecchi,
MacKenzie and Schrier ends with a
call for a "multidisciplinary strategy
to control the global epidemic" of
tobacco smoking, including a plan
which emphasizes intervention pro
grams targeted specifically at children
and adolescents.
The researchers advocate increased
government regulation of tobacco
advertisements, restrictions on access
to cigarettes by minors and higher
tobacco taxes as important first steps
in fighting smoking.
