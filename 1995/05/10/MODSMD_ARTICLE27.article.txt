# Doctors discover a worrisome source for the fire in your belly: bacteria that cause ulcers
## 
### Anand Ramachandran Contributing writer 
People usually think of stress and high levels of
stomach acid as the causes of ulcers. However,
recent discoveries in microbiology may add to the
list of ulcer-causing agents.
A bacteria called Helicobacter pylori has been
positively identified as an ulcer-causing agent by a
panel of the National Institutes of Health. The
corkscrew-shaped bacteria was identified as early
as 1983 but had never been accepted as a source of
ulcers until now. In addition, the bacteria has also
been identified as a carcinogenic substance since
being connected with two stomach cancers.
The discovery of the ulcer-causing bacteria
could lead to a vaccine to prevent ulcers.

Helicobacter is quite a common strain of bacte
ria. According to a recent article in Science,
"approximately 50 percent of the world's popula
tion is infected."
Such a high infection rate can be attributed to
the fact that many people become infected while
still infants and remain infected throughout their
lives. In developing countries, high population
densities and low sanitation produce a favorable
environment for H. pylori — in these nations, up
to 80 percent of 20-year-olds are infected. Even in
the United States and other developed countries,
gastric ulcers and cancers pose a significant health
threat.
Much money is spent in this country for
antibacterial therapy and antibiotics. But H. pylori
appears to build up a resistance to such treatments

during the therapeutic process. This resistance to
treatment has sparked the search for a vaccine or
other long-term solution to helicobacter infections.
These studies, continued at the Stanford Medi
cal School by Microbiology and Immunology Profs.
Lucy Tompkins and Stanley Falkow, have found
several interesting phenomena related to H. pylori.
First of all, the bacteria maneuver around in the
stomach's mucous layer by five or six arm-like
flagella. Once in the mucous layer, the bacteria
release a strong chemical base to neutralize the
stomach's gastric acids, thereby promoting bacte
rial colonization.
The bacteria also attach themselves to gastric
epithelial cells which form the inner lining of the
stomach. A certain receptor for this attachment is
more common in individuals with blood type O,
making such individuals more susceptible to H.
pylori-induced ulcer disease.
A new model has been developed in mice to test
the effects of various antigens that are produced
by H. pylori. One of the two strains of H. pylori
bacteria produces some proteins that aid the bac
teria in attaching to the stomach lining. It may be
that these proteins are the source of the ulcera
tion problems. Mice immunized with these pro
teins were protected from the Type 1 H. pylori
strain. This means that a vaccination to prevent
bacterial ulcers may not be far off, since the mice
showed responses very similar to those of
humans.
Although nearly half the population is a carrier
of the H. pylori bacteria, only about 10 percent
will actually develop ulcer disease. Among the
symptoms of such ulcer disease is gastritis or
inflammation of the stomach lining. Untreated,
this gastritis can eventually lead to complete
destruction of the epithelial cells or even cause
certain stomach cancers. Persons infected with H.
pylori are three to 12 times more likely to develop
the cancer.
