## Baseball dominates Dons with six-run third inning

San Francisco 1
Stanford 8

What a difference a day makes.
Give the Stanford baseball squad
24 hours and it will give you nine
hits, one two-run homer and an 8-
1 shellacking of the San Francisco
Dons.
Coming off a disappointing
show in Sacramento Monday
night, the Cardinal (29-21) came
out with its bats a-blazing and
scored seven runs in the first

three innings to put visiting USF
(23-33) away before the conces
sion stand sold its first hot dog.
After scoring once in the first
inning on junior left fielder Cale
Carter's RBI single to center,
Stanford scored six runs on four
hits in the third frame. The scor
ing binge was highlighted by
senior right fielder Dusty Allen's
two-ran home run with two outs
in the inning.
"I've been a little frustrated
lately with myself," Allen said of
his recent struggles at the plate.
"But I can't expect a whole lot
having just come back from the
injury, and I'm still not 100 per
cent. It's been frustrating, but

the season is definitely not over."
Two of the Cardinal's runs in
the third inning came home after
junior catcher A.J. Hinch dou
bled to right field. In addition,
junior first baseman Troy Kent
tripled to left center and scored
junior second baseman Brian
Dallimore. Kent had another
good outing, batting 3-for-4 with
two RBIs and one run scored.
Freshman designated hitter Jon
Schaeffer's RBI single rounded
out the scoring.
Junior left-hander Mike Rob
bins (5-3) started for Stanford
and worked seven strong innings,
striking out eight Dons and giv
ing up only one run on four hits.
Robbins was relieved by sopho
more righty Tom Reimers in the
eighth inning and junior south
paw Dan Reed in the ninth.
"I didn't really feel like I threw
all that well today," Robbins said.
"I got a little lucky out there. I
was throwing the ball right down
the plate and [the Dons] were get
ting themselves out."
However, Cardinal head coach
Mark Marquess was pleased with
Robbins' performance.
"Mike has pitched in a lot of
situations this year, long stretch
es, short stretches, and he has
been in a lot of roles," Marquess
said. "We got a good pitching per
formance today, got some key hits
and that made all the difference."
Marquess also wanted to get
Reed some time on the mound

before he begins making more
regular and lengthy appearances.
USF starter Jason Blakely (1-
4) took the loss for the Dons,
working two and two-thirds
innings and giving up seven runs
on six hits. Blakely walked four
batters, but even the Cardinal
hurlers had some control prob
lems as Robbins and Reimers
gave up a total of seven walks.
The Dons finally got on the
board in the seventh inning on a
RBI ground ball to second base.

But Stanford matched USF in the
following frame when Kent drove
in Dallimore to collect his second
RBI of the night.
Other quality performances
were turned in by Hinch, who
went l-for-2 with one run scored
and two RBIs, and Carter, who
knocked in one RBI while batting
2-for-3. Freshman lead-off hitter
Joe Kilburg worked his job well,
walking twice and scoring twice
on RBIs by Carter and Hinch.
The Cardinal's season-long

struggles in non-conference con
tests continue to nag the squad,
but members of the team insist
the problem is not a lack of inten
sity or focus.
"We have definitely had some
mental lapses in our mid-week
games, especially pre-league non
conference," Allen said of Stan
ford's 12-11 non-league record. "I
don't really know what to attest it
to. We've had the intensity, but
our performance sometimes
doesn't seem to come up to par."
