# Ugly skies, ugly victory as both sides are sloppy
## 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The rains came yesterday
afternoon, but not in great
enough quantities to wipe out
the Stanford baseball team's
game.
In front of an announced
attendance of 236, the Cardinal
defeated the University of San
Francisco in a game that meant
virtually nothing to both
squads. However, non-confer
ence wins have been few and far

between and Stanford will glad
ly take any victory.
The atmosphere for the
game was dreary and silent.
Similar to iruyor league base
ball's current situation, actual
attendance was probably half of
the announced figure and the
noise the crowd made barely
registered on the decibel meter.
The only sounds from the
stands came from the 30 or so in
the Dons' cheering section after
a couple of questionable calls
from the umpires and the ping of
the Cardinal's aluminum bats in
the bottom of the third inning.
Even the game's only ejection
failed to cause much commotion.
Paul McDaniels, the left fielder
for USF, was tossed after arguing
a third strike call and throwing
his bat but this did not generate
much attention. Many only
noticed his departure when star
ing into the expanse and observ
ing 5-foot-5-inch Troy Nakamura
batting in his place a few innings

later. McDaniels probably had a
better time viewing the game
than watching it; he took in the
rest of the afternoon on the grass
with a couple of female friends.
The play on the field did not
help cause excitement. Except for
the middle innings, pitching for
both teams could have been bet
ter. Junior left-hander Mike Rob
bins departed in the eighth
inning with a win but had prob
lems spotting his fastball,
uncharacteristically walking five
and hitting one batter. However,
he only gave up four hits and one
run. Dons starter Jason Blakely
did not fare as well giving up
seven runs in less than three
innings. Stanford helped Blakely

out in the first inning, getting
thrown out twice to end a poten
tially big inning.
Sophomore Tom Reimers
pitched in relief of Robbins but
continued to have problems with
his control, walking two in his
one inning of relief. Junior Dan
Reed, who pitched the ninth,
ended the game with a one-two
three inning but did not look
ready. Reed, returning from a
stiff shoulder, pitched with a
hitch in his motion and short
armed the ball making it appear
as if he was playing soft toss with
catcher A.J. Hinch. The only stel
lar pitching performance came
from USF reliever Sean Buller —
nicknamed "Ferris" bv his team

mates — who did not take the day
off by shutting down the Cardi
nal with a pickoff in the third
inning and perfect fourth, fifth
and sixth innings.
The fielding and baserunning
also failed to impress. The teams
combined for four errors and four
botched stolen base attempts.
Dons shortstop Jermaine Clark
continued his bad fielding by
making errors number 25 and 26,
causing his fielding average to
drop to .870. Blakely added to
USF's woes by hitting Hinch in
the back on an attempted pickoff
and senior Steve Carver picked
up a ground ball cleanly but
threw in the dirt to first base for
Stanford.
