Dick Dale & His Del-Tones, whose surf-guitar
licks figured prominently in the film "Pulp Fic
tion," will be the centerpiece of this weekend's
Rinc-a-Delt festival at Wilbur Field, concert orga
nizers confirmed yesterday.
Dale's "Misirlou" frames the opening scenes
of "Pulp Fiction" — the Quentin Tarantino
movie that won an Academy Award for best
screenplay and overflowed Flicks earlier this
quarter.
"People will be really excited" about the
band's appearance, said senior Greg Siegel, gen
eral manager of the Stanford Concert Network.

"Anyone who owns the 'Pulp Fiction' soundtrack
knows Dick Dale sets the tone of the soundtrack.
He sets the tone for the whole movie," he said.
The Concert Network has been working with
dorm representatives from Rinconada for six
months to organize Saturday's concert, which
features four other bands along with Dale, as well
as concession stands and other diversions be
tween noon and 6 p.m., Siegel said.
The Strangers, a "Dave Matthews-esque hip
pie-rock" band from Oregon will open the show
at noon, followed by the Marginal Prophets, a
two-man hip-hop band from San Francisco that
Siegel called a "really fun" band. "They're really
big in the City," he said.
Dale is scheduled to appear on the scene

around 1:30 p.m., after which the Cherry Poppin'
Daddies — ail Oregon band with a "Frank Sina
tra on acid" sound that takes "lounge songs and
goes into punk with them," according to Siegel —
will take the stage.
Another San Francisco product, the Broun
Fellinis, will close out Rinc-a-Delt with acid jazz.
"They're going to be a great close to the show,"
Siegel said.
Rinc-a-Delt organizers received confirmation
just yesterday that Dale would attend the festi
val, Siegel said. The guitarist of more than 40
years is playing two dates in San Francisco this
weekend and is hitting the Rinc-a-Delt scene be-
fore his Saturday show.
Dale will perform third in the
five-band set for time reasons,
Siegel said. He added that organiz
ers didn't want one band to head
line the show, as is traditionally the
case.

"We really wanted to make it
much more of a festival," he said.
But Dale will still be a main
attraction. "He's just going to rip
the place apart," Siegel said. "His
shows are amazing. Anyone who
likes guitars at all will just love this.
"People were just waiting to
hear what the main act would be,"
Siegel said of the festival. "Now
that we've got it, people are going
to be excited to hang out."
