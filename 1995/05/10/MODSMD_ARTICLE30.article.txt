Final Four. It has a nice ring to it. This past
weekend, the Stanford women's rugby team
traveled to the women's collegiate Final Four
in Princeton, N.J., in search of a national
championship. The tournament pitted the
Cardinal against traditional powerhouses in
battles for national respect and recognition.
The Cardinal performance garnered plenty
of publicity, including a front page article in
the New York Times. The results of the week
end's matches, however, were not as favorable
â€” Stanford fell to Penn St. 17-0 and Air Force
15-12.
The Cardinal entered the competition with
a sizable handicap. Because of a tight budget,

the women had to take a red-eye flight into
New York and arrived at Princeton with less
than a day before the beginning of competi
tion. Unfortunately, jet lag reared its ugly
head in the Cardinal's national semifinal
match against Penn State.
Coach Franck Boivert described the
squad's opening five minutes against the Nit
tany Lions as "horrible" and blamed the
effects of travel for Stanford's lackadaisical
effort. Careless mistakes plagued Stanford
and the team did not possess enough energy or
intensity to recover from its errors. Within the
first five minutes of the contest, Penn State
bolted out to a quick 12-0 advantage. Stanford
eventually found its form and began to even
the flow of the game.
Although Penn State dominance of the

match had long since faded in the second half,
Stanford was still unable to put a point on the
board. After its disastrous opening, the team
played with emotion and fire. Unfortunately
for Stanford, the desire didn't translate into
offensive results. Penn State's size advantage
damaged the Cardinal's chances, and Stanford
failed to gain possession of the ball during
many of the line outs. (A line out in rugby is
the equivalent of a soccer throw in, except
both teams are trying to grab the ball.) Penn
State also brought a competitive advantage to
the match, having played against many of the
strong East Coast teams.
Stanford held Penn State to only five points
after its tough start, but couldn't overcome
the disadvantages of size and experience to
crack the Nittany Lion defense. The match
concluded with no points on Stanford's side of
the scoreboard.
Despite the loss, Boivert credited one play-
