Final Four. It has a nice ring to it. This past
weekend, the Stanford women's rugby team
traveled to the women's collegiate Final Four
in Princeton, N.J., in search of a national
championship. The tournament pitted the
Cardinal against traditional powerhouses in
battles for national respect and recognition.
The Cardinal performance garnered plenty
of publicity, including a front page article in
the New York Times. The results of the week
end's matches, however, were not as favorable
— Stanford fell to Penn St. 17-0 and Air Force
15-12.
The Cardinal entered the competition with
a sizable handicap. Because of a tight budget,

the women had to take a red-eye flight into
New York and arrived at Princeton with less
than a day before the beginning of competi
tion. Unfortunately, jet lag reared its ugly
head in the Cardinal's national semifinal
match against Penn State.
Coach Franck Boivert described the
squad's opening five minutes against the Nit
tany Lions as "horrible" and blamed the
effects of travel for Stanford's lackadaisical
effort. Careless mistakes plagued Stanford
and the team did not possess enough energy or
intensity to recover from its errors. Within the
first five minutes of the contest, Penn State
bolted out to a quick 12-0 advantage. Stanford
eventually found its form and began to even
the flow of the game.
Although Penn State dominance of the

match had long since faded in the second half,
Stanford was still unable to put a point on the
board. After its disastrous opening, the team
played with emotion and fire. Unfortunately
for Stanford, the desire didn't translate into
offensive results. Penn State's size advantage
damaged the Cardinal's chances, and Stanford
failed to gain possession of the ball during
many of the line outs. (A line out in rugby is
the equivalent of a soccer throw in, except
both teams are trying to grab the ball.) Penn
State also brought a competitive advantage to
the match, having played against many of the
strong East Coast teams.
Stanford held Penn State to only five points
after its tough start, but couldn't overcome
the disadvantages of size and experience to
crack the Nittany Lion defense. The match
concluded with no points on Stanford's side of
the scoreboard.
Despite the loss, Boivert credited one play-
er for breaking the Cardinal out
of its early funk. Throughout
most of the match, sophomore
Tara Kini excelled at her wing
position.
"She fielded the ball extremely
well and played with a lot of con
fidence," Boivert said.
In assessing the outcome of
the match, Boivert chose to focus
on the Cardinal's positive
rebound.
"In the second half, we finally
woke up," said Boivert. "We got
back into the rhythm."
Stanford learned a valuable
lesson in the Penn State match.
If you don't come out strong, the
competition at this level will
make you pay the price. In the
consolation match, the Cardinal
set a goal to play "full out" in the
first 10 minutes of the game.
Against the Air Force Acade
my Stanford improved dramati
cally. The team put together a
beautiful progression of ball
movement to score its first try in
tournament action. The score
remained equal at 5-5 for much
of the first half before a physical
ly bigger Air Force team pushed
the ball over for a late try and
conversion. The 12-5 halftime
score left the door wide open for a
Stanford comeback.
Boivert made several key
adjustments in the second half to
help Stanford overcome the dif
ference in size. The team imple

mented a new technique in the
scrums that allowed Stanford to
control balls it had been losing in
the first half.
"It was pretty awesome
because our scrum was so much
smaller than theirs," Boivert
said.
Outstanding efforts by three
forward row players keyed Stan
ford's success in the scrums.

gain the advantage against the
Falcons.
Stanford closed the lead to
three points with a penalty try
and a conversion by junior Aman
da Edwards. The Falcons
achieved little offensive success
in the second half, failing to score
a point. Sophomore Debbie Mer
rill solidified the Cardinal
defense with consistent solid
tackling.
Finding offensive success
tough to come by, Air Force
switched tactics and adopted a
ball-control style of play. The
taller Falcons possessed the same
advantage in line outs as Penn

State. Air Force forced the ball
out of bounds to maintain posses
sion of the ball and chew up time.
The Falcon tactics prevailed in
the area of line outs and the Car
dinal lost its momentum in the
match, falling by a final margin
of three points.
The weekend's results provid
ed more than immense experi
ence for a young Cardinal team.
Three of its members, juniors
Kahlie Kim, Jennifer Kearns and
Amanda Edwards, earned spots
on the Ail-American team. Stan
ford's impressive placement on
the Ail-American team is a reflec
tion of the increased national
respect for the Stanford program.
"We proved to the nation we
belonged there all right," Boivert
said. "We realized how close we
are to winning a national champi
onship."
Boivert expects the national
exposure to provide a boost to the
program. Whether it's through
increased recognition or experi
ence, Stanford women's rugby will
take nothing but positives away
from the Final Four experience.
"We know exactly what we
need to do to improve the pro
gram," Boivert said. "The recog
nition is great for people who play
a game that requires a lot of dis
cipline, courage and teamwork."
