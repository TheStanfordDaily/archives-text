Dara Kaplan
While she doesn't boast the colorful wardrobe, freshman attack
er Dara Kaplan is dubbed "Punky" by her women's lacrosse team
mates, as in Punky Brewster. But Soliel Moonfrye never earned
Offensive MVP honors in the Western Women's Lacrosse League
Final Four like the Stony Brook, N.Y. native, who posted three
goals in the squad's 8-6 championship victory over UC-Davis.

David Popejoy
The third-best throw in the nation at Saturday's Big Meet was
just another notch in senior David Popejoy's impressive list of
accomplishments. The three-time All-American hurled the hammer
231-1 for the sixth best toss in Pac-10 history. The track team came
up just short in its quest to end Cal's Big Meet win streak in the last
track meet at Stanford Stadium.
