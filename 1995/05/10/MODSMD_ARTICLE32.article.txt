# The
						Real Deal — in it for the cash
## 
### 
When this column debut
ed back in January, I
didn't expect many peo
ple — aside from the true sports
fans born and bred in New York
— to actually read it. But I was
proven wrong when random
people around campus began
offering me their comments at
parties and the like. I guess this

column has managed to fill
some warped niche in The
Daily. Some have told me it has
filled the void created by the
graduation of Schwartz (on
Sports) and Tish Williams
(freshmen: you don't know
what I'm talking about, but if
you're curious, ask one of the
actives in your fraternity).
In any case, the Real Deal
has provoked many questions.
In this, my penultimate column

of the year, I attempt to answer
all of the various and sundry
questions put to me thus far:
Yes, this column is read
mostly by fraternity men.
No, contrary to popular
belief I do not play a varsity
sport at Stanford.
Yes, I really think the Knicks
will win the NBA champi
onship.
No, I would not be writing
this shady column if they
didn't pay me for it.
Yes, I am the same Joe
Bialowitz who covers the No.
1-ranked men's tennis team.
No, contrary to how he
comes off in the tennis articles,
No. 6 singles player Ricky
Becker is not arrogant. He is
just a friend from New York
who is very quotable and is not
afraid to be cocky when he has a
right to be.
Yes, I think Spike Lee should
be banned from Madison
Square Garden, especially dur
ing the Pacer series.
No, I have not given up on
John Starks yet. When the
Knicks win it all, he will silence
all doubters who are still telling
the following joke: "Did you

Deal
