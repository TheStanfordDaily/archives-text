# Birdie bashers boast perfect league mark
## Badminton brings no dual losses to this weekend's Stanford Open

With so many sporting events
and activities taking place daily
on campus, the Stanford bad
minton club has suffered from a
lack of recognition although it has
made a name for itself in the bad

position to win the Northern Cal
ifornia Intercollegiate League.
The six-team conference, which
consists of Cal, Davis, University
of the Pacific, Solano and City
College of San Francisco, is the
only organized badminton league

schools in the nation dropped
their scholarship programs, the
NCAA decided to scrap the whole
program," Stanford coach Bill
Pickthorn said.
Stanford's year-round season
consists of six tournaments and
three dual meets. The squad prac
tices three days a week and does
physical conditioning twice a
week.
Standout players for the Cardi

ranked No. 3 in the country in the
