# Birdie bashers boast perfect league mark
## Badminton brings no dual losses to this weekend's Stanford Open 
### Reggie Norris 
With so many sporting events
and activities taking place daily
on campus, the Stanford bad
minton club has suffered from a
lack of recognition although it has
made a name for itself in the bad
minton community.
However, Stanford's prowess
will take center stage this Satur
day and Sunday from 9 am. to 7
p.m. in Ford Center, where the
Cardinal will host an open tour
nament.
So far this season Stanford has
enjoyed nothing but success.
After placing second in the UC-
San Diego Sun God Invitational
in October, winning the Stanford
Tournament in February and
leading the pack at the Solano
City College Tournament a few
weeks ago, the team turned its
attention to league competition.
Stanford breezed through its
three dual meets, beating Califor
nia 12-3, UC-Davis 11-4 and
Solano 13-2. Because the stand

ings are based on an accumula
tion of points, the team stands in
position to win the Northern Cal
ifornia Intercollegiate League.
The six-team conference, which
consists of Cal, Davis, University
of the Pacific, Solano and City
College of San Francisco, is the
only organized badminton league
in California due to the NCAAs
refusal to sponsor a national tour
nament.
"Since the two top badminton
schools in the nation dropped
their scholarship programs, the
NCAA decided to scrap the whole
program," Stanford coach Bill
Pickthorn said.
Stanford's year-round season
consists of six tournaments and
three dual meets. The squad prac
tices three days a week and does
physical conditioning twice a
week.
Standout players for the Cardi
nal include Lilly Chen, who is
ranked No. 3 in the country in the
under-22 age group and second
among doubles competitors. A
skilled freshman who will
attend the Olympic Festival this
summer, Chen enjoys the "com
fortable tension and friendly
atmosphere on the court."
On the other hand, fellow
freshman Greg Louie is just

making himself comfortable.
After joining the team just
three weeks ago in time for the
Solano City College Tourna
ment, Louie was runner-up in
singles competition and fin
ished third in doubles. Stan
ford's top doubles team of
seniors Olivia Wang and Nikki
Toyama placed second in the
Stanford tourney and captured
the title in the Solano City Col
lege Tournament.
As for the future of Stanford

badminton, Pickthorn says"it
looks real good. We have a very
strong freshman class coming
in. We also have a lot of depth."
With all these pluses, the Cardi
nal looks to sweep competition
in the league next year.
Always looking for new play
ers, Pickthorn summed up the
experience as "a lot of fun. We
encourage people to come out
and join. Whatever level and
whatever age â€” all are wel
come."
