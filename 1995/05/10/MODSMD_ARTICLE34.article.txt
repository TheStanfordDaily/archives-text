Men's basketball
After a stellar 1994-95 campaign, Stanford's starting backcourt
of sophomore Brevin Knight and junior Dion Cross has been invit
ed to try out for the U.S. National Team.
Knight and Cross will join 41 other top players at the four-day
trials in Colorado Springs, Colo., next month. The 1990 USA
Men's World University Games team will be named the day after
the tryouts have concluded, June 13.
Florida coach Lon Kruger will lead the selected squad at the
1995 World University Games from Aug. 24 to Sept. 2 in frukuo
ka, Japan.
Stanford is one of only five schools to receive multiple invita
tions to the trials. Defending national champion UCLA and
Georgetown each will send three players, while North Carolina,
Villanova and the Cardinal feature two.
Knight and Cross both were named to the All-Pac-10 squad
after their prominent revisions to the Cardinal record books.
Knight averaged 16.6 points, 6.6 assists and 2.8 steals en route to
erasing five conference, school or Maples Pavilion marks.
Cross paced the Cardinal scoring attack with 16.8 points per
game and placed his name in the Stanford record books six times.
Possibly the best shooter in school history, Cross led the Pac-10 in
free-throw shooting with 83 percent and in three-point shooting
at 48.0 percent. For much of the year Cross was among the top
five in the nation in shooting beyond the arc.
Wrestling
After one of their best seasons in years, Stanford wrestlers con
tinue to earn honors. Names from the current squad and from
years gone by combined to take honors at the U.S. National Open
last weekend at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
Three of the Cardinal's five grapplers at the meet competed in
the 136.5-pound division. Juniors Jimmy Aguirre and Matt Cano
and senior Jay Jackson all landed in the top 12 of the 38 competi
tors in the class, falling one victory shy of an All-America award.
Juniors Tod Surmon and freshman B.J. Sanchez battled in the
149.5-pound class. Surmon wrestled for five rounds and Sanchez
one less in the 52-athlete division.
Former wrestlers enjoyed even more success as Dave No wick
earned fifth place in the 114.5-pound Greco-Roman class. Nowick,
now in his second year of medical school at Colorado, qualified for
the final World Team trials next month. Nowick is the first Cardi
nal wrestler since 1976 to place in a Greco-Roman event at the
National Open, following current head coach Chris Horpel.
Horpel's former assistant Dave Schultz earned his seventh
national crown by taking the 163-pound freestyle class.
