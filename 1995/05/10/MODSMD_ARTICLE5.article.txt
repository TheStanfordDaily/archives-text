# Tuition trimming
## Federal bill could end government subsidy for children of employees 
### Jamie Taylor Editorial staff 
If Congress passes a proposal
to remove federal funding from
tuition-assistance programs
geared toward families of faculty
and staff at research uni
versities, Stanford may have to
examine its own benefits pro
gram.
The White House Office of
Management and Budget has pro
posed cutting federal funds for tu
ition-benefit programs from uni
versities that subsidize under
graduate tuition for families of
employees. For children of em
ployees attending any accredited
institution, the University will
supply an amount up to one-half
of Stanford's tuition to help cover
costs.
The federal government pro
vides about $1 million of the ap
proximately $4 million benefits
budget that covers tuition assis
tance for dependents of employ
ees, according to John Franklin,
Stanford's director of total com
pensation.
"This proposal does not place
us in jeopardy," Franklin said,

adding that if Congress decides to
act on the proposal and cut feder
al funding, Stanford would "sim
ply have to go through avenues to
examine how we can deal with the
cuts. It would just be another
stress on the University budget,
but [tuition compensation!
wouldn't just go away."
Franklin said, however, that
"with the mood in Washington
right now of cutting the budget,
I'm afraid this proposal will be ac
cepted by Congress."
Stanford pays for all employee
benefits through a monetary pool
created by a surcharge on salaries.
Because many faculty salaries —
including benefits — are funded
by federal research grants, the
government has a vested interest
in decreasing costs. Sirice the tu
ition-assistance program is non
taxable, removing funding from
the program is the easiest way to
cut costs.
"The government's rationale
for this is that employers in the
private sector don't usually have
tuition-grant benefits for their de
pendents," Franklin said. "But
most universities have compara
ble programs."
Harvard University, however,
does not provide tuition benefits
to dependents of staff and facul
ty, although it does subsidize par
tial tuition for employees to con
tinue their own education at Har
vard, said Ellen Cirillo, associate
director of human resources at
Harvard.
The University of Chicago, on
the other hand, has a more gen
erous program than Stanford,
providing subsidies for tuition for
both undergraduate and gradu
ate schools and allowing spouses
of employees to partake in the
program.
Franklin said the tuition assis
tance program helps Stanford
maintain a competitive edge.
"It is very helpful in recruiting
faculty and staff. When you're
competing with Ivy League
schools, you need to provide
incentives to get excellent faculty
and this is just another aspect

that makes Stanford attractive,"
he said. "It's like a business. It's
what we do that is important to
our community."
About 650 Stanford students
benefit from the program, which
began in 1969. Before then, the
University tuition-benefit pro
gram subsidized the entire
tuition only at Stanford. This,
however, was unproductive,
because of Stanford's tough
admission requirements,
Franklin said.
"It's a great thing; a terrific
benefit," said History Prof. Jack
Rakove, whose son will be attend
ing Stanford and utilizing the
tuition benefit program next
year. "A lot of faculty count on
it."
Rakove added that there
would be "a lot of pressure from
faculty" to maintain the pro
gram, even if federal funding was
removed.
The Office of Management
and Budget proposed the plan
after examining a report issued
by the General Accounting Office
about a year ago, which detailed
federal support received by five of
the top 10 research universities.
