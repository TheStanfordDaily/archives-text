# Tuition trimming
## Federal bill could end government subsidy for children of employees

If Congress passes a proposal
to remove federal funding from
tuition-assistance programs
geared toward families of faculty
and staff at research uni
versities, Stanford may have to
examine its own benefits pro
gram.
The White House Office of
Management and Budget has pro
posed cutting federal funds for tu
ition-benefit programs from uni
versities that subsidize under
graduate tuition for families of
employees. For children of em
ployees attending any accredited
institution, the University will
supply an amount up to one-half
of Stanford's tuition to help cover
costs.
The federal government pro

proximately $4 million benefits
budget that covers tuition assis

ees, according to John Franklin,
Stanford's director of total com

"This proposal does not place
us in jeopardy," Franklin said,

adding that if Congress decides to
act on the proposal and cut feder
al funding, Stanford would "sim
ply have to go through avenues to
examine how we can deal with the
cuts. It would just be another
stress on the University budget,
but [tuition compensation!
wouldn't just go away."
Franklin said, however, that
"with the mood in Washington
right now of cutting the budget,
I'm afraid this proposal will be ac
cepted by Congress."
Stanford pays for all employee
benefits through a monetary pool
created by a surcharge on salaries.
Because many faculty salaries —
including benefits — are funded
by federal research grants, the
government has a vested interest
in decreasing costs. Sirice the tu
ition-assistance program is non
taxable, removing funding from
the program is the easiest way to
cut costs.
"The government's rationale
for this is that employers in the
private sector don't usually have
tuition-grant benefits for their de
pendents," Franklin said. "But
