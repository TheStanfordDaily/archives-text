## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The first woman to hold the po-

sition in several
years, graduate
senator Alane
Murdock was
elected as chair
of the new
ASSU Senate
last night.
Murdock, a
People's Plat
form member,
defeated under
graduate sena
tor Stephen
Russell, a mem
ber of the Stu
dents' Alliance,
and Publica
tions Board Di
rector Danny
Bressler, an in
dependent. In
the final round,
Murdock re-

ceived 11 votes, while Bressler re
ceived six and Russell received
three.
"I'm very excited about taking
this on and aiding the senate in ac
complishing its goals," Murdock
said.

Murdock said that as senate
chair she will work to enhance
communication among senators
and to eliminate partisan bicker-

ing, which has
been a problem
this year. "I
want to work
on changing
the tone of Ben
ate meetings,"
Murdock said.
Communica
tion can also be
improved if
more work is
done outside
senate meet
ings, she
added.
"Meetings
are when
things come to
fruition," Mur
dock said. "We
need to com
municate well

outside of
them in order to have the best pro
posals and in order to work effec
tively together. There should not
be so much debate on the floor."
To accomplish this goal, Mur


Alane Murdock
dock said she will bring back the
senate steering committee —
which consists of committee chairs
and the senate leadership — and
will open informational discus
sions with any interested parties
outside of senate meetings.
Murdock said she wants to
address the problem of senate dis
cretionary funding cycles. Accord
ing to the ASSU Constitution, she
said, groups are unable to spend
funds for a given quarter until they
have been approved by the senate.
However, since the senate does not
vote until the sixth week of the
quarter, groups are left in limbo
and end up violating the constitu
tion by spending their funds.
"I definitely want to make a
clear and definite ruling about the
sweatshirts to alleviate the vague
ness of the [policyl," Murdock
added.
Another problem which
plagued this year's senate was that
several projects were not finished
on time, Murdock said. She cited

as an example the fact that the
senate never created a hearings
commission to look into violations
from last month's election.
Murdock said she would solve
this problem by setting a firm
schedule for the senate in advance.
She added she also would like to
improve student access to the
ASSU by utilizing technology such
as the World Wide Web.
During the meeting, senators
questioned the candidates on their
commitments to the constitution
and how they would behave as sen
ate chair, as well as on their char
acters and their biases due to party
affiliation.
Despite having his party's can
didate for senate chair defeated,
Students' Alliance leader and
undergraduate senator Andr6
Vanier said that his party would
work for greater senate harmony
next year.
People's Platform leader and
undergraduate senator Bill Shen
echoed that sentiment.
"Alane will not become tangled
in partisan bickering and political
grandstanding," Shen said. "She
has proven to us that she's fair
and just."
