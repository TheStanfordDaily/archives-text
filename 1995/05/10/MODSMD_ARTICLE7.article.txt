## Collins becomes first female to pilot space shuttle in NASA mission

When people graduate from Stanford,
some leave California to work in New York
and Chicago, while others opt to travel in
Europe. Eileen Collins decided to leave
Earth altogether.
Collins, who graduated in 1986 with a
master's in operations research, made his
tory in January when she became the first
female NASA pilot, flying the Space Shut
tle Discovery in Mission 63, the first-ever
rendezvous with the Russian space station
Mir.
Collins' original ambition was to be a
pilot in the Air Force. But in 1978, the year
she received her bachelor's degree from
Syracuse University, NASA first began se
lecting women astronauts. After flying in
the Air Force for seven years, Collins ap
plied for an Air Force degree program at
Stanford.
Going back to school after seven years
was a difficult experience because, she
said, "I had to relearn all my derivatives."
Collins said the women first selected by
NASA in 1978 — and Sally Ride, the first
woman to fly in space in 1983 — "opened
the doors for me as a pilot," adding that
her main inspiration was "how much I en
joyed flying" which she began her junior

year of college.
But there was discrimination against
women when Collins first joined the Air
Force. Women were not allowed to fly com
bat airplanes, a rule that was changed in
1993. NASA has recently hired two more
women pilots.
Collins said Stanford's academic atmos
phere helped her prepare for space. "It was
very challenging and very difficult. I had to
discipline myself to study, to set priorities
and to really concentrate and learn the ma
terial that I needed to learn for my select
ed career field," she said. "I felt the cur
riculum was really difficult. The process of
learning I went through at Stanford has
helped me develop my thinking process
that stays with me today."
She added that she learned a number of
the techniques for flying a shuttle at Stan
ford, such as a technique involving
Kalman filters which is important in navi
gation.
While one would expect an astronaut to
be nervous on the day of her first flight,
Collins said she was excited rather than
anxious. "The day we launched on the mis
sion, I was very confident and very sure of
myself," she said. "The reason is NASA

Stanford has heiped
me develop my think
ing process that stays
with me today.'
