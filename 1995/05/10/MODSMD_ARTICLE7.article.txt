# Alumna soars above Earth in Discovery
## Collins becomes first female to pilot space shuttle in NASA mission 
### Kate Stinger 
When people graduate from Stanford,
some leave California to work in New York
and Chicago, while others opt to travel in
Europe. Eileen Collins decided to leave
Earth altogether.
Collins, who graduated in 1986 with a
master's in operations research, made his
tory in January when she became the first
female NASA pilot, flying the Space Shut
tle Discovery in Mission 63, the first-ever
rendezvous with the Russian space station
Mir.
Collins' original ambition was to be a
pilot in the Air Force. But in 1978, the year
she received her bachelor's degree from
Syracuse University, NASA first began se
lecting women astronauts. After flying in
the Air Force for seven years, Collins ap
plied for an Air Force degree program at
Stanford.
Going back to school after seven years
was a difficult experience because, she
said, "I had to relearn all my derivatives."
Collins said the women first selected by
NASA in 1978 — and Sally Ride, the first
woman to fly in space in 1983 — "opened
the doors for me as a pilot," adding that
her main inspiration was "how much I en
joyed flying" which she began her junior

year of college.
But there was discrimination against
women when Collins first joined the Air
Force. Women were not allowed to fly com
bat airplanes, a rule that was changed in
1993. NASA has recently hired two more
women pilots.
Collins said Stanford's academic atmos
phere helped her prepare for space. "It was
very challenging and very difficult. I had to
discipline myself to study, to set priorities
and to really concentrate and learn the ma
terial that I needed to learn for my select
ed career field," she said. "I felt the cur
riculum was really difficult. The process of
learning I went through at Stanford has
helped me develop my thinking process
that stays with me today."
She added that she learned a number of
the techniques for flying a shuttle at Stan
ford, such as a technique involving
Kalman filters which is important in navi
gation.
While one would expect an astronaut to
be nervous on the day of her first flight,
Collins said she was excited rather than
anxious. "The day we launched on the mis
sion, I was very confident and very sure of
myself," she said. "The reason is NASA

Stanford has heiped
me develop my think
ing process that stays
with me today.'

trains their astronauts so well.
By the time I flew in space, I was
so familiar with the space shuttle
and launch system. The more
you practice something, the bet
ter you can control your emo
tions. "
Collins, however, was not the
only person who was confident
about her mission. Her advisor
at Stanford, Operations
Research Prof. Don Iglehart,
knew when Collins applied that
she had a bright future.
Iglehart said he was
impressed by the recommenda
tion he received from Collins' Air
Force commanding officer."I
said at that time that she might
be the next Sally Ride for Stan
ford. There was no way to doubt
her," he said.
Iglehart added that, while
Collins was at Travis Air Force
Base before coming to Stanford,
she was chosen out of more than
100 pilots to be the piloting
instructor for that squadron.
"She obviously had something
special," he said.
For Collins, there is "no such
thing" as a normal work day. She
may do simulations of space
walks and living in space or she
may focus on classroom work,
survival training or paperwork.
Recently, Collins has been work
ing at Mission Control in Hous
ton, talking to astronauts who
are in space. On other days, she
speaks to the public about her
mission and why the space pro
gram is so important to the Unit-

Ed States.
Being in space, Collins said,
"is different from anything that I
could ever experience here on
Earth." For example, most peo
ple take for granted that hair
goes down that we can place
things down on a table and have
them stay there. The hardest
challenge about having no gravi

ty, according to Collins, is that
you have to be organized and
remember where you put things.
There is also an effect on the
body. The fluids shift, the face
tends to get fat and one can get a
little congested. "You can use
your fingertips to move around,"
she said. Also, being in micro
gravity means that "you can turn

upside down and pretend that
the ceiling is the floor."
Collins remains optimistic
about opportunities for women
in NASA and in the job market in
general. "It's a process. As the
years go by, we are seeing more
and more women in various jobs.
Pretty soon, there'll be no more
'new'jobs" for women, she said.
