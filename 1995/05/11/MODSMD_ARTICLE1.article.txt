# Service charge
## Ticket office policy may up event prices 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Students may have to pay
more for their Flicks tickets next
year because of a policy that re
quires tickets to be sold through
Stanford Ticket Office.
The policy affects tickets sold
for all events held at Memorial
Auditorium, Dinkelspiel Audito
rium and Frost Amphitheater,
said Larry Davidson, associate di
rector of Stanford Events.
Although Davidson said the
policy had been enforced in previ
ous years, student group leaders
said they had never heard of the
policy and have never complied
with it.
The extra cost will be due to
the service charge that the ticket
office adds to all tickets sold. The
charge could range from 25 cents
to $1.05 per ticket, said ASSU
Speakers Bureau Director Scott
Moss.
The cost would either be paid
for by the group sponsoring the
event or by students in the form
of higher ticket prices, Davidson
said.
If the policy were enforced, it
would cost the Speakers Bureau
between $1,500 to $10,710 a
year, Moss said.
"We do not have anywhere
near that kind of money," Moss
said. "We would have had to elim
inate one of our speakers. People
would not want Joycelyn Elders
or John Sununu canceled so
