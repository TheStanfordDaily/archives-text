# Service charge
## Ticket office policy may up event prices 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Students may have to pay
more for their Flicks tickets next
year because of a policy that re
quires tickets to be sold through
Stanford Ticket Office.
The policy affects tickets sold
for all events held at Memorial
Auditorium, Dinkelspiel Audito
rium and Frost Amphitheater,
said Larry Davidson, associate di
rector of Stanford Events.
Although Davidson said the
policy had been enforced in previ
ous years, student group leaders
said they had never heard of the
policy and have never complied
with it.
The extra cost will be due to
the service charge that the ticket
office adds to all tickets sold. The
charge could range from 25 cents
to $1.05 per ticket, said ASSU
Speakers Bureau Director Scott
Moss.
The cost would either be paid
for by the group sponsoring the
event or by students in the form
of higher ticket prices, Davidson
said.
If the policy were enforced, it
would cost the Speakers Bureau
between $1,500 to $10,710 a
year, Moss said.
"We do not have anywhere
near that kind of money," Moss
said. "We would have had to elim
inate one of our speakers. People
would not want Joycelyn Elders
or John Sununu canceled so
Tresidder Ticket Office can get
$6,000."
Moss said the Speakers Bureau
may be able to reach a compromise
which would allow the Ticket
Office to sell season passes to those
outside the Stanford community,
while the Speakers Bureau would
continue to give out tickets for free
in White Plaza
"We do not sell tickets," Moss
said. "To have a $1 service charge
on nothing is a bit strange."

According to Davidson, this pol
icy has existed for many years but
was not enforced this year. He said
in previous years both Flicks and
Speakers Bureau have complied
with the policy.
However, both Moss and Flicks
Business Manager John Hall said
that their organizations have never
heard of a mandatory policy.
"The policy has never been
enforced in at least the last four
years with regards to the Speakers
Bureau," Moss said. "We use
Tresidder Ticket Office only to
extent that it is useful,"
Moss said Speakers Bureau had

used the services of the Ticket
Office in the past only because the
group did not have enough people
to distribute tickets in White Plaza
"The policy has never been
enforced," Hall said. "Flicks chose
to sell through the Ticket Office
one year. We found the service
unnecessary and very expensive. It
required us to raise prices to the
students."
Davidson said the extra revenue
generated would go to support the
operational expenses of the Ticket
Office.
Hall, however, questioned why
student activities should be sup

porting the University. "This will
be one more way that the Universi
ty finds to siphon money away
from student activities and student
events into inefficient operations,"
Hall said. "The only reason for the
Ticket Office [surcharge] is not
that student groups need the
money, but because the Lively Arts
needs it."
Hall added that the policy would
harm student groups. "This is in
no one's best interest," Hall said.
"To force pass sales through the
office ... would really not be bene
ficial for us since it is an adminis
trative burden on Flicks."
