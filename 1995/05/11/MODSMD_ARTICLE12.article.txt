# COP will travel to UN conference in Seoul

All four members of this year's Council of
Presidents will travel to Seoul, South Korea, in
three weeks to take part in the 1995 World Youth
Leaders Conference, which is commemorating
the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.
The UN, which normally invites only a single
student government president, made an excep
tion this year upon discovering Stanford had not
one president but four.
"A lot of people are under the assumption that
a student government only has a president," said
COP member Vanessa Alvarado. "We explained
to them that we had a council of presidents. We

received a letter back inviting all of us."
Joined by fellow COP members Lisa Lee,
Mork Murdock and Anietie Ekanem, Alvarado
said she is excited to be representing Stanford to
an international convention.
"Hopefully, we'll get a better understanding of
the social problems that youth faces throughout
the world," she said.
The five-day conference, which begins on May
30, will discuss problems of youth in society and
determine the future of younger generations in
the 21stCentuiy.
The Stanford delegation will participate main
ly in the committee on problems and treatment
of today's youth, Murdock said. Ekanem will be a
panelist on the education subcommittee and will

work with Murdock on an overall declaration
which Murdock said would "assert some kind of
a collective vision for the future" as a conclusion
to the conference.
"None of us have ever been to an internation
al conference of this magnitude," Murdock said.
"The main thing is to contribute to the discus
sion at large and see if we can have an impact on
the conference."
Because the UN does not normally invite four
students from one school, it could only cover two
students' expenses, Alvarado said. The COP
members will pay for the additional expenses out
of their own pockets, she said.
"All four of us agreed to help each other out. I
don't think it will be a financial burden," she said.
