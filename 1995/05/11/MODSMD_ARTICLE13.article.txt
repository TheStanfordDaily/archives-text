Yeltsin rejects Clinton's pleas
MOSCOW (AP) — In a summit of modest
results, Boris Yeltsin spurned President Clinton's
pleas yesterday to halt the bloody repression in
Chechnya and to abandon a nuclear technology
sale to Iran. Their restrained appraisal of the
talks suggested widening differences.
"In playing this relationship out, there will come
times when there will be differences," a subdued
Clinton said at a joint news conference with Yeltsin.
But he said, "Our people will be safer as a result of
this meeting. It was an advance for security."
Yeltsin, after six months of hesitation, declared
that Russia will formalize military ties with
NATO, the Western alliance that once was
Moscow's enemy.
Yeltsin made clear, though, that he remains
deeply suspicious of NATO's plans to expand east
ward toward Russia's doorstep.
Most prominent were Clinton's objections to
Russia's brutal crackdown in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya. The president said he urged
Yeltsin to declare a permanent cease-fire, but the
Russian president appeared unmoved.
Under intense pressure from Clinton and
threats from congressional leaders to cancel U.S.
aid for Russia, Yeltsin agreed not to sell Iran a gas

centrifuge that could be used to produce weapons
grade enriched uranium.
Yeltsin withdrew that part of the deal after
Clinton presented intelligence documents sug
gesting that Iran is trying to become a nuclear
power.
Storms plague Louisiana
SLIDELL, La. (AP) — A second day of torren
tial rain in the New Orleans area flooded thou
sands of homes yesterday in this suburb sand
wiched between a swamp and a marsh, forcing
some people to swim out their windows to safety.
The death toll rose to six. New Orleans city
workers found the body of a child in the water
flowing to drainage pumps.
Boats, dump trucks and National Guard trucks
carried people to drier ground, cruising Slidell
streets filled with rushing, murky water that
lapped at window ledges. One shelter had to be
evacuated when it, too, was flooded.
Slidell got 14 inches of rain yesterday on top of
7 inches the day before. Picayune, Miss., about 30
miles to the northeast, got 19 inches by noon.
"This really caught us off guard," said Audrey
Smith, who awoke to find floodwaters lapping at
her front door in Slidell.
