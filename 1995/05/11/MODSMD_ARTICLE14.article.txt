OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -
Terry Nichols, the army buddy of
accused Oklahoma bomber Timo
thy McVeigh, was brought to Okla
homa yesterday to face charges
that he and McVeigh carried out
the attack.
Nichols, like McVeigh, was
charged under a federal anti-ter
rorism law that carries a possible
death sentence.
Three weeks after the deadliest
terror attack on U.S. soil, Nichols,
40, declined to challenge his trans
fer to Oklahoma from Kansas. A
court appearance was scheduled
for Thursday.
Wearing a bulletproof vest,
Nichols was whisked from the fed
eral courthouse in Wichita, Kan.,
and flown to the federal prison out
side Oklahoma City where
McVeigh is being held without bail.
As he left the courthouse, a woman
yelled, "Baby killer!"
Prosecutors built their case on
evidence that included a fertilizer
receipt and back-and-forth trips
between Oklahoma and Kansas.

"I think he's well informed of
what's going on," said his public
defender in Kansas, Steve Gradert.
Prosecutors said that Nichols
was with McVeigh in Oklahoma
City on April 16, three days before
the blast that left 167 people dead,
and that they drove back to Kansas
together. Nichols lives in Hering
ton, Kan.
In addition, a law enforcement
source in Washington told The
Associated Press that investigators
have evidence that Nichols took
another trip to Oklahoma City
after the Ryder truck that carried
the bomb was rented in Kansas.
The official did not say exactly
when that trip might have been
made, but the truck, packed with
4,800 pounds of fertilizer-and-fuel
oil explosives, was not rented until
April 17, and was blown up on the
morning of Wednesday, April 19.
The official refused to detail the
evidence.
Given that the truck was
destroyed and McVeigh was arrest
ed alone in Perry, Okla., shortly

after the bombing, investigators
are trying to find out how Nichols
got back to Kansas where he
turned himself in on April 21. One
theory is that another person may
have driven him back to Kansas.
At a court hearing in Wichita
last month, prosecutors described
a close association between Nichols
and McVeigh. After serving in the
Army together, the two ran a mili
tary surplus business, sometimes
shared a house and traveled
together.
Authorities also believe they
shared extreme anti-government
views. Prosecutors have suggested
McVeigh bombed the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building to avenge
the cult disaster at Waco, Texas,
that took place exactly two years
earlier. More than 80 cult members
died as the Branch Davidian com
pound went up in flames.
Federal investigators said that
they found a receipt for possible
bomb materials in Nichols' home
and that McVeigh's fingerprint
was on the receipt.
