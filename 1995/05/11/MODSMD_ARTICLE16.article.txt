## Editorial Foothills on reserve 
### 
The University should
keep hills permanently
free from development

THE FOOTHILLS are as
integral a part of Stanford as
Palm Drive or Hoover
Tower. But right now there is
nothing preventing the University
from transforming those beautiful
rolling hills into condominium
complexes or faculty housing. In
fact, Stanford officials have
recently threatened to do just that.
Most people who use the
Foothills regularly or just enjoy
looking at them think that they
are a protected nature preserve.
Besides the fact that they contain
no public roads and few buildings,
those little brown signs that read
"Stanford Foothills Academic
Reserve" are deceptively park
like.
But according to Leonie Batkin,
lands management manager for
the Stanford Management Compa
ny, "Stanford has the ability to
develop the Foothills in the future
according to the needs of academic
programs and the University."
The designation "academic
reserve," given to most lands out
side of the core campus, means
only that "as reasons come up,
either academic or housing, the
land will be developed," Batkin
said.
While Stanford administrators
have promised they have no plans
to develop the Foothills in the near
future, others tell a different story.
Former Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss,
for one, has said that Stanford offi
cials have dropped "suggestions"
at meetings that they would devel
op the Foothills, apparently to
encourage Palo Alto officials to be
more cooperative regarding the
University's Stanford West devel
opment project off Sand Hill Road.
Whether these threats are hol
low or not, it is not hard to imagine
the University being in severe
enough financial straits in the

future to warrant trying to earn
revenues by constructing housing
or other buildings in the Foothills.
One more big earthquake would
suffice.
And given Stanford's seemingly
insatiable appetite for develop
ment, one could easily foresee Uni
versity administrators attempting
to put buildings in the Foothills for
the simple reason that no more
open space was available on cam
pus.
Surely, as soon as Stanford put
forth concrete plans to develop the
Foothills there would be a massive
uproar protesting them. There is,
however, a better solution.
The University should redesig
nate the Foothills a nature pre
serve, like Jasper Ridge. The
Foothills are an area of majestic
natural beauty â€” a legacy that
should be preserved for all future
generations to enjoy.
Research has shown that open
space is necessary for people to
maintain their sanity. Open space
as beautiful as the Foothills
inspired geniuses like John Stein
beck and Ken Kesey.
While Stanford's land use policy
should be explicitly rewritten to
prevent development of the
Foothills for commercial or resi
dential use, the land could also
continue to serve as a resource for
research. Just as there are build
ings in Jasper Ridge (and channels
through which new buildings for
research purposes only can be con
structed), similar provisions could
be incorporated into the Foothills
land use plan while maintaining
the designation of nature preserve.
Members of the Stanford com
munity should contact University
officials to insist that the Foothills
be protected from development
forever now, so there will be no
temptation to develop them in the
future.
By acting when there is no
immediate threat, proponents of
preserving the Foothills would
gain an upper hand on the Univer
sity.
John Steinbeck would be proud.
