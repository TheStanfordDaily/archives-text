University should invest responsibly, not in Texaco

IT IS INCREDIBLY frustrating when
the politics and bureaucracy of the Uni
versity prevent committees and the
Advisory Panel for Investment Responsi
bility (APIR) in particular, from fulfilling
our role and acting upon student senti
ment. We are referring to Stanford's
financial investment in Texaco, and fortu
nately, all is not lost with their upcoming
proxy issue. The slowdown in the process,
which would result in no action on the res
olution, is happening because the APIR
must decide that substantial social injury
is occurring, meet again and then recom
mend a course of action for the Stanford
Board of Trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR).
Fortunately, the SCIR can act without
recommendation from the APIR. The
SCIR has been forwarded the information
regarding the Texaco and Burma share
holders' resolutions and will hopefully act
upon these issues so Stanford can cast a
vote in the May 22 shareholders' meeting.
We have both repeatedly expressed our
concerns with the Texaco issue to the
Director of Investment Responsibility, the
chair of the APIR and other members of
the APIR. We have assisted SEAS in lob
bying the APIR and Harry Turner, the
managing director of the Stanford Man
agement Company, to address this issue.

Our concerns have also been forwarded to
the chairperson of the SCIR.
We recently sent a letter to University
President Gerhard Casper and Mr. Turner
expressing our concerns about the future
of the Advisory Panel for Investment
Responsibility. We had reason to believe
the University was going to disband the
APIR and the investment responsibility
review process. Turner has reassured us
the APIR will not be disbanded, although
resources for investment responsibility
research and the APIR will decrease next
year. The letter follows:
"Dear gentlemen:
"The Advisory Panel for Investment
Responsibility was established to make
recommendations to both the Stanford
Committee on Investment Responsibility
(SCIR) and the President of the University
on investment responsibility issues. In the
past, investment responsibility centered
around South Africa, and while the social
issues related to South Africa have signifi
cantly decreased, the need for Stanford's
leadership in investment responsibility
still remains strong.
"Increased Student Activism. The Stu
dents for Environmental Action at Stan
ford (SEAS) see Stanford's role in invest
ment responsibility as vital to maintaining
the University's generally environmentally

sound investment record. This student
group has recently completed research
efforts which identify areas where Stan
ford could improve its investment policy.
For example, it has been discovered that
Texaco is contributing to the deterioration
of the Burmese rain forest. Stanford cur
rently owns 93,000 shares (worth
$5,928,750.00) in Texaco Oil Company.
"Tobacco. It has been proven in both
court rooms and medical laboratories that
tobacco and related products are harmful.
Increasingly, evidence shows that more
and more people are being harmed by
smoking and second-hand smoke as a
direct result of tobacco promotional and
marketing campaigns. Despite the tobacco
industry's claim that aggressive advertis
ing simply serves to convert existing
smokers to their respective brands, stud
ies indicate these campaigns also serve to
attract new smokers, particularly teens. A
recent study surveyed minors and almost
one-third of those minors had received
promotional items from tobacco compa
nies. Another study experts cite showed
that Camel increased the 'company's
share of the cigarette market for minors
from less than 0.5 percent to almost 33.0
percent between 1988 and 1993' and that
'in 1992, Camel was the only major brand
of cigarettes to show a sales increase,

which ... is attributable to sales to
minors.'
"In addition to the evidence above, sec
ond-hand smoke and smoking among
pregnant women causes substantial social
injury to non-smokers. Given these facts,
we believe Stanford's investment policy
stance on this important social issue will
serve as a model for other institutions.
Just as South Africa served as a focal point
for establishing new investment policies,
so too can tobacco. Stanford's time to act is
now.
"We see an increased need for the role
of the SCIR and the APIR. We understand
the APIR charter has been reaffirmed for
the upcoming year, but we are unclear as
to what this means given the fact that a
'dedicated full-time director of Investment
Responsibility' is not deemed necessary by
the Stanford Management Company."
The next meeting of the APIR is May
31, where we will discuss Texaco, other
proxy issues, Stanford's tobacco holdings
and your concerns. Please contact either of
us to voice your opinion about investment
responsibility issues at Stanford.
