## Coulda, shoulda, woulda 
### 
MY SISTER'S already packing for
college. I told her to mellow and
graduate first. But she can't wait.
Though she has chosen to head into
Bear territory, plastered her room with
Cal paraphernalia and yanked the Stan
ford license plate holder ofT the car, I have
this need to give her sisterly advice. So she
can learn from my mistakes.
I started writing a letter about every
thing I coulda, shoulda, woulda done, so
she could look at it now and then. What
inspiration.
It started out like this: "So Amy â€” let
me tell you some stuff from post-diploma
land. If I could do college over, I'd pick a
major that would get strange looks from
the relatives instead of one that compels
them to share their dreams. So you won't
have to explain, 'Um, I don't do that kind
of psych.' Do something where they'll give
you a raised eyebrows 'Uh huh . .. inter
esting ... and what'll you do with that?'
routine.
Be bold and irrelevant. Unsafe.
Oh, I would have partied more, studied
more, decided what to do with my life ear
lier. I should have practiced the piano and
played tennis...."
Then right before the part where I told
her to pick more daisies, I stopped.
I started thinking. Where does this get
me, where does it get anyone, rehashing
what I would have done? Unless you say,
"OK, this is what I'm going to do tomor
row," this whole line of thought is pretty

unproductive. And cheesy on paper.
We all have regrets.
Even my friends who seem to have it all
together cany theirs around like tattered
luggage that keeps getting heavier. You'd
think they'd look back and say, "Yeah, I
did it right." Most don't. One wishes that
she'd taken more art classes, done the pre
med core on the side. Another would've
spent more time doing nothing.
I know what they're talking about.
The fantasy of doing it differently.
Changing something, maybe just one
thing, and having it all come out better
somehow. (If you'd asked him out before,
you two would be together, and he
wouldn't be engaged.) Very attractive, but
dangerously unreal. Because it still
wouldn't end up like the fantasy.
Focusing on where you wish you could
be, what you hoped life would be like and
why it's not that way, is a fme strategy for
living in the past. A way to stay immobilized
and protected. Especially when the future is
scary, you can imagine instead of act.
It's familiar to me.
The bottom line is that all this rumina
tion doesn't really get me anywhere. I've
found that decisions don't get any easier as
you get older; choices keep coming, and
they have increasingly more impact on the
rest of life. More than a major.
Maybe you sleep late and wait for the elf
in your dreams to figure it out for you. So
you wake up with all the answers, a clear
view and intrinsic motivation to move

toward your destiny. Almost religious, in a
way. Then you realize the elf was just a
remnant of Yoda, and that's where the des
tiny stuff came in. So where are you?
Thinking about what you shoulda done,
what you coulda done, a long time ago. And
calculating where you would be today.
That's when you know that something
has to give. Maybe it's time for that jog. I
work on my fagade.
I can hold on to the coulda, shoulda,
woulda routine instead of looking at deci
sions and seeing them for what they were.
Doing the best I could at the time. The
strength comes from looking back and
moving on. Reflection without regrets.
I could tell Amy everything I wish some
one had told me, to save her some of the
pain of figuring it out, but I'm sure I'll
miss something. That's how it works.
Because it's her journey, not mine. So
she'll have her own struggles. And maybe
there's something good about that.
Now I'm trying to write the so-you're
going-off-to-college letter again. So far, it's
shorter, and it's something like this:
"Have a great time in college; call me, call
me, call me. Especially if you actually need
anything. And remember, don't even try to
get me to take off my red shirt."

Julie forgives Dean Montoya for his mis
take and reminds him that little Zach will
be applying in 2001.
