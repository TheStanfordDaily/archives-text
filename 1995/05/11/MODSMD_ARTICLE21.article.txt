## Stanford to host free conference Athlete's body is focus of three-day event linking academics and athletics 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
In a revolutionary merger of
athletics and academics, "The
Athlete's Body in History, on the
Field, and in Society," a free con
ference open to the public, opens

tonight with the hope
of proving that the two
disciplines are not as
dissonant as they're
often assumed to be.
The conference,
which runs through
Saturday, is the result
of one year of collabora
tion between the
Department of Com-

parative Literature and
the Department of Athletics.
According to Hans Gumbrecht,
professor of comparative litera
ture, the idea arose in response to
the disconnection often felt
between the sciences and the
humanities on campus. Many
times the "typical Stanford
humanist" feels alienated due to
the University's strong science
tradition, he said.
"To overcome that situation,
rather than consider the divisive
ness, we should take advantage of
it in a way no other school can
do," he said.
Last March, Gumbrecht and
other collaborators formulated
a successful colloquium offered
to the Stanford community
called "Beyond Dualism." Bol
stered by the positive feedback
and high participation, organiz
ers brainstormed to offer a sim
ilar event this year which would
weld the two sides together.
This time, however, they want
ed to include the practical fields
in the science-humanities aca
demic interface. Athletics, they
decided, would provide the per
fect door.
"Despite the overwhelming
presence of sports in our society,

it's almost never talked about in
an academic context," Gum
brecht said. "This will add an
interacademic side to the issue [of
athletics], and it will be interest
ing to see how the practical expe
rience side comes in."
Under normal circumstances,

the fields, courts and
stadiums of sports are
worlds away from the
classrooms and labo
ratories of academia.
But this rare partner
ship is possible at an
institution like Stan
ford, Gumbrecht said,
where academic and
athletic caliber
remarkably coexist.

Upon the conception of "The
Athlete's Body," the Athletics
Department was immediately
supportive and viewed the confer
ence as a way to demonstrate its
serious commitment to the over
all student-athlete. "When we
first contacted the Athletics
Department, we didn't have a
clue as to whether [Athletic
Director] Ted Leland would be
interested. But his enthusiasm
was fabulous from the first
moment," Gumbrecht said.
Rick Schavone, Cardinal div
ing coach and director of special
projects in the Athletics Depart
ment, spearheaded the project
from the athletic side of the con
ference. "It's really exciting for us
academically," he said. "It's never
been done before, at Stanford or
anywhere. Most undergraduates
don't get introduced to academics
and physical education, but there
is a science to everything [ath
letes] do."
Collaborating with the human
ities side was enjoyable and inter
esting, Schavone said, citing a
mutual awe between the two
departments. "It's a natural
