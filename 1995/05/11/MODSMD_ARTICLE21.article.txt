## Stanford to host free conference Athlete's body is focus of three-day event linking academics and athletics 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
In a revolutionary merger of
athletics and academics, "The
Athlete's Body in History, on the
Field, and in Society," a free con
ference open to the public, opens

tonight with the hope
of proving that the two
disciplines are not as
dissonant as they're
often assumed to be.
The conference,
which runs through
Saturday, is the result
of one year of collabora
tion between the
Department of Com-

parative Literature and
the Department of Athletics.
According to Hans Gumbrecht,
professor of comparative litera
ture, the idea arose in response to
the disconnection often felt
between the sciences and the
humanities on campus. Many
times the "typical Stanford
humanist" feels alienated due to
the University's strong science
tradition, he said.
"To overcome that situation,
rather than consider the divisive
ness, we should take advantage of
it in a way no other school can
do," he said.
Last March, Gumbrecht and
other collaborators formulated
a successful colloquium offered
to the Stanford community
called "Beyond Dualism." Bol
stered by the positive feedback
and high participation, organiz
ers brainstormed to offer a sim
ilar event this year which would
weld the two sides together.
This time, however, they want
ed to include the practical fields
in the science-humanities aca
demic interface. Athletics, they
decided, would provide the per
fect door.
"Despite the overwhelming
presence of sports in our society,

it's almost never talked about in
an academic context," Gum
brecht said. "This will add an
interacademic side to the issue [of
athletics], and it will be interest
ing to see how the practical expe
rience side comes in."
Under normal circumstances,

the fields, courts and
stadiums of sports are
worlds away from the
classrooms and labo
ratories of academia.
But this rare partner
ship is possible at an
institution like Stan
ford, Gumbrecht said,
where academic and
athletic caliber
remarkably coexist.

Upon the conception of "The
Athlete's Body," the Athletics
Department was immediately
supportive and viewed the confer
ence as a way to demonstrate its
serious commitment to the over
all student-athlete. "When we
first contacted the Athletics
Department, we didn't have a
clue as to whether [Athletic
Director] Ted Leland would be
interested. But his enthusiasm
was fabulous from the first
moment," Gumbrecht said.
Rick Schavone, Cardinal div
ing coach and director of special
projects in the Athletics Depart
ment, spearheaded the project
from the athletic side of the con
ference. "It's really exciting for us
academically," he said. "It's never
been done before, at Stanford or
anywhere. Most undergraduates
don't get introduced to academics
and physical education, but there
is a science to everything [ath
letes] do."
Collaborating with the human
ities side was enjoyable and inter
esting, Schavone said, citing a
mutual awe between the two
departments. "It's a natural


The Athlete's Body
blend," he said. "Being a coach at
Stanford, it's a combination you've
got to believe in."
In preparation for the event,
and to gauge interest and generate
more thoughts, Gumbrecht held a
seminar last quarter with compar
ative literature department chair
Jeffrey Schnapp on sports and cul
ture. After the success of the semi
nar, both professors felt better
informed about the idea of sports
in culture, as well as more confi
dent about lining up speakers for
the conference. They found that
sports was indeed an academic
topic and the two disciplines gelled
smoothly.

"The Athlete's Body" will fea
ture panel discussions, lectures
and forums on topics ranging from
the history of sports to issues of
technology, ethnicity and gender.
Internationally recognized human
ists will unite with renowned ath
letes in a joint attempt to explore
the many dimensions of r ,fUl 'tics.
The event kicks off ton if, ri res
ge Auditorium at 8 p.n.., where
Leland will chair a panel discussion
on "Sports and Race," featuring
Barbara Jordan, Tiger Woods and
others. The forum will also feature
Henry Louis Gates, a visiting pro
fessor from Harvard who will
speak on "O.J. Simpson and the
Representation of the Black Body."
On Friday morning at Arrillaga
Family Sports Center, visiting pro
fessors from Amherst College and
Ohio University will consider

"Sport and its Historical Tradi
tion." This topic will also be dis
cussed by a panel with Summer
Sanders, Skip Kenney, Jenny
Thompson and others. The? confer
ence continues through Saturday
evening, and will address "Sports
Appeal," "Sports and Technology,"
"Sports, Sex and Gender,"
"Embodiments" and "Sports Pro
fessionalization and Broadcasting."
"I'm nervous about it like it's
before a meet," Schavone said.
After a year of study and anticipa
tion, it is finally time to see the
results of the grand experiment —
and see how this one-of-a-kind
event affects our way of thinking.
"Sports have had bigger impact
on civilization that we all think,
and we need to explore that and see
what direction it's taken us," he
said.
