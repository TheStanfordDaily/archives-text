# Cardinal gunning for ASU
## Golfers tee off at Tucson tourney 
### John Lawson Contributing writer 
The climax of the 1994-95 golf
year is upon the second-ranked
Stanford women's team.
Today through Saturday at the
Randolph Park North Golf
Course at Arizona the Cardinal
will compete in the penultimate
event of the season, the Western
Region Championships.
The top 20 teams west of the
Mississippi River have descended
on the city of Tucson to make
their bid for an invitation to the
NCAA championships, which will
be held in Wilmington, N.C., in
two weeks. The 11 teams with the
lowest scores after this three-day,
three-round affair has concluded
will receive those sought-after
invites.
The West, due to its usual
moderate supply of sunshine and
warm temperatures during the
winter months, has always been
the premier region for collegiate
golf, and this year is no exception.
It possesses the top six teams in
the nation, including No. 1 Ari
zona State, No. 3 San Jose State,
No. 4 UCLA, No. 5 Oklahoma and
No. 6 Tulsa.
But the rare inclement weath
er that has drenched this part of
the country — and the Bay Area
in particular — has not made it
an easy ride for the Cardinal to
their best national ranking in
years.

"We really lost a lot of practice
time to the rain this year," said
head coach Tim Baldwin. "Our
course, and the practice range as
well, got extremely saturated, and
that left us far behind schools like
Arizona State in terms of prac
tice."
The two-time defending
national champion Sun Devils
have looked all but unbeatable
since January, winning several
tournaments by extraordinary
margins. Their golfing prowess
was on display most recently at
the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship two weeks ago, when
Arizona State crushed the rest of
collegiate golfs best conference,
running away to a 33-stroke vic
tory.
"Arizona State is an outstand
ing team," said sophomore Mhairi
McKay, just recently named First
Team All-Pac-10. "They have
tremendous talent, including the
U.S. Amateur Champion in
Wendy Ward and a two-time U.S.
Junior Champion in Kellee
Booth." In fact, all five Sun Devil
starters are either first or second
team All-Pac-10.
In that tournament, Stanford
finished a disappointing third,
barely turning away challenges
from conference also-rans such as
Arizona and Oregon.
"We didn't play very good team
golf at the Pac-lOs," Baldwin

said. "There was always a score
we wanted dropped that had to be
counted." In NCAA golf, the high
est individual score at the end of
each round is thrown out, and the
remaining four scores are tabu
lated to get the team's result.
Although the team's play has
not been outstanding of late,
Baldwin realizes that his squad
should have no problem qualify
ing for the NCAAs. However,
there are some incentives for good
golf this weekend.
"The better we do in the
regionals," he said, "the better
practice times and the better pair
ing we receive once we're in
Wilmington. So there is more to
this tournament than placing in
the top 11, although you never
know what can happen. The West
is always strong."
Teeing it up for the Cardinal
will be McKay and fellow sopho
more Andrea Baxter, junior Vicky
Strada and seniors Jamille Jose
and Amy Lawrence.
