# Contract not renewed
## Greenwood is gone 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Big time college athletics often rests
upon one simple axiom. Win and win
often.
Despite bringing steady improvement
and national recognition to a program not
previously accustomed to great success,

Stanford women's gymnastics coach
Breck Greenwood was not rewarded with
a contract extension for the 1996 season.
"I was told that the program hadn't
accomplished enough, that we weren't as
successful as we were supposed to be,"
Greenwood said. "They saia there was a
lack of success and excitement."
The Athletics Department told
Greenwood last week that he
would not coach for the Cardinal
next year, creating a difficult sit
uation for the rest of the coach
ing staff as well as for the team.
Assistant coach Lisa Mitzel-Izzi
is taking care of the team affairs
in the absence of a permanent
head coach.
Greenwood began coaching on
the Farm in 1989. His 1992
squad was the first Cardinal
team ever to qualify for the
NCAA championships, where it
finished 10th.
But after failing to qualify the
next two seasons, Greenwood
learned that his job could rest on
how well the team did this year.
The best recruiting class in the
country and four returning
seniors loaded the Cardinal with
talent and created expectations of
a trip to the NCAAs. However,
Stanford finished 15th in the
country, an excellent finish but

just short of qualifying for the
national championships.
Despite the pressure placed
upon him, Greenwood did not
pass this urgency onto his team.
"I wouldn't do that to them,"
Greenwood said. "There is
enough pressure on them
already."
The firing comes at an unfor
tunate time for Greenwood. With
a promising recruiting class to
complement the talented
returnees, he may have been on
his way to creating another Stan
ford powerhouse. The program
will now take on a different look,
something that has caused some
anxiety among the gymnasts.
"It's really hard right now,"
said freshman Christie Jones.
"All of us are very stressed out
about it. We really don't know
what is in store for us next year."
Greenwood may now look into
other career options. Despite the
difficult circumstances, he
remains optimistic.
"This is the end of my coach
ing career," Greenwood said.
"It's time to get on with a new
phase in my life. Maybe this is a
blessing in disguise."
