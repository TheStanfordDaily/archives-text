# After two years in the making, new IM sport opens with a bang
## Floor hockey brings back the glory days 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
The line began forming in the
Ford Center lobby around 7 p.m.
Signups for spring intramural
sports weren't until the following
morning, but that didn't stop
students from camping out.
It's not unusual to see a clump
of sleeping bags in Ford the
evening before signups, but 7
p.m. was definitely earlier than
usual. Come on, don't these peo
ple have books to read and papers
to write? Was an intramural
sport more important than
studying? When talking about
the new sport of floor hockey, the
Ford campers' answer was a
resounding yes!
Recall your glory days in sev
enth grade P.E. when you used to
hustle up and down the wooden
gym floor desperately trying to
steal the puck or deliver a nasty
check. Feel the rush of emotion
as you fondly relive the goal you
scored in leading your team to
the junior high lunch time recess
county championship. Ahhh, the
good old days. Ahhh, IM floor
hockey.
The idea was born two years
ago as two young intramural
staffers tossed back some brew at

a local pub. Hoping to recapture
the glory of their own past, the
pair thought floor hockey and
intramural competition would
make a perfect pair. The two
mavericks, however, were low on
the chain of command and
nobody would take their idea
seriously.
"It's too dangerous," objected
an older staff member.
"You'll only scratch up the
floor," said a facilities supervisor.
The two swallowed their ini
tial setbacks with humility, but
they never lost sight of their
dream. Over the following two
years, the pair rapidly ascended
through the ranks of the intra
mural department.
This year, senior Brad Sharpe
is executive student director of
intramurals; junior Kris Atteber
ry will assume a director's posi
tion next year. Their positions of
power mean more than a fat pay
check. People actually listened to
the floor hockey idea and despite
some reservations gave the intra
mural department the green
light to begin a floor hockey
league.
"Once I got into the position
where I could make decisions it

was easy to get the league going,"
Sharpe said.
With approval of facilities and
the athletic department, half of
the work was over. The second
half, creating the rules, however,
turned out to be equally challeng
ing.
Sharpe and Atteberry devoted
several hours to researching cur
rent IM floor hockey programs
around the country. The duo
sought the assistance of UC-San
Diego, unquestionably the moth
er of floor hockey on the colle
giate level, in forming a set of
rules that put safety first. They
understood that a serious floor
hockey injury, such as a puck in
the mouth or a check through the
glass, would signal the end of the
league.
The two called upon the ser
vices of fellow intramural direc
tors, seniors Rob Ross and Dave
Delia Lana to help them develop
the strict regulations enforced in
the Sunday games. The quartet
spent many an evening in the
intellectual environment of the
Stanford bowling alley and final
ly produced a set of tough but fair
rules. Unless players would like
to inspect the confines of the
penalty box they must obey
restrictions against checking,
playing in the crease and high
sticking.
"The majority of the rules we
have are in place for safety rea
sons," Sharpe said. "If we didn't
have them in place, we couldn't
play the sport."
A player participating in the
sport for the first time quickly
realizes the game of floor hockey

is drastically different than ice
hockey.
"This is not ice hockey, you
can't play that way," Sharpe said.
"It's not going to be the Kings
against the Flyers in the best of
seven for the Stanley Cup."
Although safety is the primary
concern, Sharpe, who also serves
as a referee, does allow some
room for contact. Quoting a pop
ular rhythm and blues song,
Sharpe added, "I see nothing
wrong with a little bump and
grind."
The players thrive on the little
contact that is permitted. Many
students spend the four hours
each Sunday bouncing from team
to team in the six time slots
packed into the evening. The
games are divided into three 10-
minute periods. A remarkable 24
teams comprise the league,
impressive for a first year sport.
Two types of players pick up
hockey sticks and run around in
the sauna-like conditions of Ford
Arena. According to Atteberry,
one style is the ultra-intense, bor
derline psycho, win-at-all-cost
player who constantly bends the
rules. The other level is fun-lov
ing and relaxed, out for a carefree
game of slapshots and casual con
tact. Atteberry admits that
future changes have to address
this difference. ?
"We have to find a way to
amend that discrepancy in the
future," said Atteberry, unwill
ing to reveal future intramural
plans.
Without a doubt, the league
will have to respond to the
demands of popularity in future
seasons. Although floor hockey
possessed a personal significance
to Sharpe and Atteberry, the
immediate popularity of the sport
came as a surprise.

"I don't know if I thought peo
ple would sleep out just to play
floor hockey," Atteberry said.
"Some people come out on Sun
days wearing NHL [National
Hockey League] jerseys and knee
pads, that's really going all out."
One of the players who
camped out in Ford and now
devotes his Sunday nights to the
draining, intense, challenging
semi-contact sport is Jeff Spi
vack. The junior sports a San
Jose Sharks jersey and has
gained fame for his vocal support
of teammates. Spivack captains
West Lagunita's team, Lag's
Frogs, but is one of the many
players who have the energy to
fill in for five other teams. A huge
fan of the NHL's Washington
Capitals, Spivack enthusiastical
ly welcomes the opportunity to
put the biscuit in the basket come
game time.
"It's all the excitement of ice
hockey without the busted
bones," Spivack said. "I'm sore
for the next four days, but the
thrill of foiling an opposing net
minder [goalie] is definitely
worth it."
The excitement of players like
Spivack must delight Sharpe and
Atteberry. What started out as
two buddies reminiscing about
junior high sports has grown into
one of the most popular intramu
ral sports at Stanford.
If you ever feel the itch to
throw on an old pair of sneakers
and run around in striped socks
like a chicken with its head cut
off, pay a visit to Ford Sunday
nights. There is a good chance
you could hook on with a team
that needs an extra goon or two.
Then, you can relive a little bit
of the past. As Atteberry said,
"Glory days, that's all that it's
about."
