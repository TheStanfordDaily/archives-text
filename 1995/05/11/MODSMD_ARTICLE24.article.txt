# After two years in the making, new IM sport opens with a bang
## Floor hockey brings back the glory days

The line began forming in the
Ford Center lobby around 7 p.m.
Signups for spring intramural
sports weren't until the following
morning, but that didn't stop
students from camping out.
It's not unusual to see a clump
of sleeping bags in Ford the
evening before signups, but 7
p.m. was definitely earlier than
usual. Come on, don't these peo
ple have books to read and papers
to write? Was an intramural
sport more important than
studying? When talking about
the new sport of floor hockey, the
Ford campers' answer was a
resounding yes!
Recall your glory days in sev
enth grade P.E. when you used to
hustle up and down the wooden
gym floor desperately trying to
steal the puck or deliver a nasty
check. Feel the rush of emotion
as you fondly relive the goal you
scored in leading your team to
the junior high lunch time recess
county championship. Ahhh, the
good old days. Ahhh, IM floor
hockey.
The idea was born two years
ago as two young intramural
staffers tossed back some brew at

a local pub. Hoping to recapture
the glory of their own past, the
pair thought floor hockey and
intramural competition would
make a perfect pair. The two
mavericks, however, were low on
the chain of command and
nobody would take their idea
seriously.
"It's too dangerous," objected
an older staff member.
"You'll only scratch up the
floor," said a facilities supervisor.
The two swallowed their ini
tial setbacks with humility, but
they never lost sight of their
dream. Over the following two
years, the pair rapidly ascended
through the ranks of the intra
mural department.
This year, senior Brad Sharpe
is executive student director of
intramurals; junior Kris Atteber
ry will assume a director's posi
tion next year. Their positions of
power mean more than a fat pay
check. People actually listened to
the floor hockey idea and despite
some reservations gave the intra
mural department the green
light to begin a floor hockey
league.
