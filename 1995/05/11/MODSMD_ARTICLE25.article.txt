# Sports junkies can surf Web
## 
### 
Media overload is upon us. There was a time
when I was satisfied just reading the
sports page every day. Then it was two
newspapers and Sports Illustrated every week.
When we got cable, I added ESPN to my daily rou
tine (the last time I was home, I watched the
Sports Center broadcast multiple times in a row
late at night).
When I came to Stanford, I found that the San
Francisco Chronicle's Sporting Green was the
worst sports page I've ever seen and that, without
a television, it was easy to lose track of what was
going on in the world of sports. Except for when
my dorm got a TV for the '92 Winter Olympics
and kept it through the NCAA basketball tourney,
I went a whole year without college football, bas
ketball, the NBA and weekend baseball on the
tube. No highlights, no playoffs, no marquee
matchups.

Although the ASSU senators failed to deliver
on their promises to bring ESPN to the dorms, the
next best thing happened: We got CNN. Not only
was CNN the first place I turned for world and
national news, but I became a slave to Sports
Latenight at 10:30. Every night, I got a call from
my RA who only needed to say, "It's :28," and I'd
head upstairs to get my daily dose of scores, stats,
highlights, trades and most important, the Play of
the Day. For anyone else out there who was also
tuned in, who could forget Van Earl Wright call
ing a home run? Or Nancy Newman with her 10
layers of makeup?
But after two years of being able to go to sleep
knowing all there was to know about the previous
day's sporting action, CNN was pulled from
SUNet's lineup for basic cable. So I turned to the
Internet. There, I found newsgroups about all the
subjects I was interested in. I got all my hard facts
from the clari.sports groups and some great
laughs reading posts to the rec.sports lines. If I
ever thought I was addicted to the nightly
sportscast on CNN, the net was a whole new ball
game. I'd check several times a day, even several
times within minutes to get the latest updates on
games.
Just recently, I've found the newest sports
junkie hot-spot on the net, ESPN's ESPNet. This


Quick
Shots
Kyle
Utsumi
site on the World Wide Web is
perfect for everyone from the
casual sports fan to the complete
sports sicko. Today on ESPNet,
you can read a column titled
"Chris Berman muses on turn
ing 40," get career statistics and
college highlights for Sam Cas
sell of the Houston Rockets or
find out several random facts

about the Atlanta Braves' John
Smoltz (his favorite breakfast
cereal is Lucky Charms and his
favorite ice cream is brickie).
Also, Chili Davis lists the five
hardest-throwing pitchers he's
faced, there's a list of birthdays
and a question-and-answer ses
sion with John Salley.
For baseball, basketball and
hockey, the latest standings and
results are just a couple clicks of
the mouse away (I'm following
the Bulls-Magic game while I'm
writing this column). If you are

a complete sports nut and
haven't yet taken a look at ESP-
Net, I would advise you do so
with caution. The future of
sports media is here, and it's
addictive.
Too much info for me, pass
the Sporting Green.

Kyle believes the Lakers can still
put out their series with the
Spurs â€” if Kurt Rambis gets
more quality minutes. ESPN's
