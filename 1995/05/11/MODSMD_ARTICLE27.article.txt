After winning the Pacific 10 Southern Division championships, the Stanford tennis teams earned
eight spots on the All-Pac-10 team, Commissioner Tom Hansen announced yesterday.
Men's coach Dick Gould and women's coach Frank Brennan both earned Coach of the Year honors.
Gould won the award for the eighth time while Brennan added a fourth to his stash of Coach of the
Year awards.
Two players from both the men's and women's squads were selected to the first teams. Junior Jeff
Salzenstein and freshman Scott Humphries joined four others on the men's first team as the Cardinal
was the only school with more than one player. Sophomore Katie Schlukebir and freshman Ania
Bleszynski joined UCLA's duo of Keri Phebus and Jane Chi as the only duo from the same school for
the women.
Freshman Paul Goldstein and senior Kim Shasby checked in on the second team.
