### Marie Rosencrantz Contributing writer 
Karin Van den Dool, a senior lecturer in
Spanish and Portuguese, died in an accident
in her home Monday morning.
A dedicated and inspiring teacher, Van
den Dool is remembered by students and
colleagues alike as a source of joy and en
couragement.
Born in 1938 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
Van den Dool received her bachelor's degree
in journalism from the University of Brazil
before coming to the University of Oregon
as a Fulbright Scholar.
Van den Dool started working as a lec
turer in Spanish and Portuguese at Stan
ford, eventually earning her doctorate in
Spanish from Stanford in 1980. With time,
she became the engine of the Portuguese

Department, fighting to keep the language
program alive despite budget cuts, accord
ing to her colleagues.
"She was the pillar of the program," said
Paz Hara, professor of Spanish and director
of the Spanish language program. "Without
her, Portuguese would have been killed
years ago, but through her energy, hard
work and love for the students, the torch
was carried. She was a wonderful human
being and my best friend."
Van den Dool was promoted to senior lec
turer in Portuguese in 1983 and received
the Dean's Award for Distinguished Teach
ing in 1992. In nominating her for the
award, her students described her unusual
ability as a teacher to make the most diffi
cult grammatical concepts clearly under
standable and her genuine interest in the
students as individuals.

"She is one of the most exciting profes
sors I have had in four years at Stanford and
a wonderful person," said Dale Yeatts, a co
terminal student who took an introductory

Portuguese class from Van
den Dool. "She gave equal
attention to everyone . . .
and was always interested
in helping students out re
gardless of what level they
were at."
More than anything,
mourning students and col
leagues yesterday com
mented on Van den Dool's
warmth and humor.

"Karin had a wonderful way of bringing
us down to earth whenever we got too im
practical," said Sylvia Wohlmut, depart
ment administrator for French, Italian,

Spanish and Portuguese. "She had a great
sense of humor which zeroed in on
hypocrisy and injustice, yet kept us all
laughing."
Joan Kruckewitt, a graduate student, re
members Van den Dool's class as "the high
light of my day."
"Karin had an incredible sense of humor
which made even studying grammar fun,"
she added.
Students recall Van den Dool inviting
them to her office to go over individual
grammar difficulties, providing them news
about Brazil every week through e-mail and
even dancing the samba in the classroom.
For Mother's Day, she had invited all of her
classes to her home.
