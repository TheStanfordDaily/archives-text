# Ear of the Dragon tour showcares Asian-American musicians
## 
### Chi-hui Yang 
of the shitty things about
■ ■ being in a band and being on
tour all the time is 1 like to go to
movies a lot, and 1 end up missing half of
those that come out," Seam guitarist and
singer Sooyoung Park muses emphatically,
momentarily lost on a tangential plain some
where between home and New York City.
"This year I'm missing the Asian American
Film Festival in Chicago, which really stinks
because it's a big event and I can't get those
movies on video."
The confessions of an indie rocker: This

dislike for touring is no
surprise, since Park has de
voted huge amounts of
time over the past few
years on the road with
Seam and his old band
Bitch Magnet. But for this
tour, he really doesn't have
a reason to be complain
ing. Instead of staying at
home and soaking in the
works of other Asian
Americans, he'll be switch
ing roles and others will be
watching him in an Asian
extravaganza of different
sorts. Only here the audi
ence will probably be
standing up and moving
around quite a bit: Seam is
in the midst of headlining
the three week long Far of
the Dragon tour, a nation
wide showcase of indie
rock bands with Asian
Americans.
Originally formed in
North Carolina in 1991 as
the trio of Park, Lexi
Mitchell and Superchunk's
Mac McCaughan, Seam
was born at the time the
underground legend Bitch
Magnet was dissolving.
Tired of the "math rock"
complexities of its grind
core and worn down by
constant touring, Park
traded in Bitch Magnet's
blistering stew of sound for
Seam's sparser, more pop
y and somewhat relaxed
approach.
The trio recorded and
released several singles; in
1992, they released their
first album, "Headsparks,"
through Homestead
Records. Soon after,
Mitchell and Park relocat
ed to Chicago where they

found a new drummer, added a second gui
tarist and, in 1993, released the very highly
acclaimed, "The ProblemX with Me" on
Touch and Go Records. Now, two years later,
the present lineup of Park, guitarist Chris
Manfrin, drummer Reg Shrader and bassist
William Shin is ready to release Seam's third
album, "Are You Driving Me Crazy?"
Our conversation got off to a slow start,
because Sooyoung called late; he
couldn't find a bathroom. Then the
people who were in the office that he was call
ing from kept asking him questions. But as
that background noise faded out and was re
placed by the quieter electronic rings of mul

tiple telephones, we got down to business.
Seam had just started the Ear of the Drag
on tour. The group had played three shows,
and were on their way to Philadelphia for the
next. We started talking, and pretty soon I
had him admitting to the band's deepest
vices.
"Well, we're really clean cut, but I think the
biggest is that we eat too much meat," Park
said.
But there do lie other dark confessions
from the vaults ofSooyoung Park. In the past
four years, Seam has definitely struggled with

internal instability. The band has undergone
six lineup changes in three albums. Because
of personal problems, relocations and other
reasons, members seem to have just come
and gone. The lineup for"The Problem with
Me" lasted only for a few months, barely
enough time to record the record and go on
tour.
"The drummer we just couldn't get along
with. We had to kick him out of the band. The
guitarist sort of came as a package deal, so he
really didn't want to keep going," Park ex
plained. Members of the current roster,
Shrader and Manfrin, came on a few months
later, and early last year Shin signed on bass
when Mitchell left the band, leaving Park the

only original member.
Seam will never succumb to the "no origi
nal members syndrome" simply because the
Park's presence defines Seam. His trademark
songwriting lays itself down and spreads it
self out comfortably through the new album.
His hushed, almost whispered, first-person
vocals and his brilliantly complicated guitar
work make themselves at home on "Are You
Driving Me Crazy?."
"Our music has the both and the and, and
not the either or the or," Park elaborates after
several moments of thoughtful silence. I he

description is enigmatic but successful in ex
plaining the all-encompassing sound that
Seam conveys. "Are You Driving Me Crazy?"
alternates between instances of pure Sunday
morning placidity to stretches of distortion
riddled angst — the compromise of a whis
per and a scream. It is a common ground
somewhere between the lazy, looseness of
"Headsparks" and the dark, personal com
plexity of "The Problem with Me."
April 28 was sort of a double com
mencement for Park. It was both his
28th birthday and the launch of his
brainchild, the Ear of the Dragon Tour. Orga
nized in collaboration with Shin and friend

Hen Kim, the concept for the tour came from
experiences during Park's childhood.
"It goes back to when I was growing up in
West Virginia. I had always been interested in
music, and started getting into bands in ju
nior high and high school, but there were
never any real role models for me. 1 think be
cause of that, I never really felt like what 1 did
was legitimate. As I have gotten older, 1 guess
I have sort of accepted that you need to see
people who look like you doing things before
you can do them," he said.
Before the next day's concert in Philadel
phia, Sooyoune is headed to

a local high school to speak
to Korean American
teenagers, for an organiza
tion called Asian American
United. He admits he has a
hard time identifying and re
lating to other Korean Amer
icans, mostly because he
doesn't speak Korean, and
grew up in a very Western
lifestyle. But the impetus to
help others is still there.
At the end of our conversa
tion, when I mention the
possibility of Park becoming
the sought-after role model,
Sooyoung laughed slightlv
and quickly declined, a bit
embarrassed, "I don't think it
should be me. 1 would feel re
ally uncomfortable doing it
But with this tour, Park
hopes to provide support for
other Asian-American musi
cians.
"1 think there does need to
be in the future some kind ot
Asian-American musician
role model, and I think that
he or she will come from the
next generation, this
younger generation of
bands," Park said.
Perhaps this model will
come out of the Ear of
the Dragon. Park orig
inally envisioned the Ear ot
the Dragon to be just a CD
compilation of indie rock
bands containing Asian
Americans, but the project
soon grew into a tour to pro
mote the CD as well. The
tour consists of a core of
three bands — Seam, San
Diego's aMiniature and
Toronto's Venus Cures All —
as well as a rotating fourth
snot, filled bv Versus, Cub

r —' /
and San Francisco's J Church. The CD, to be
released on Park's Fortune 5 Records, con
tains 13 other bands as well, including a San
Francisco ska band, Skanking Pickle, and
Chicago's Mint Aundry.
