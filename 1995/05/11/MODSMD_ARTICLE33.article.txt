# Director Kayo Hatta developed ‘Picture Bride' with focus and vision
## 
### Ed Yoon 
Some invisible hand has mandated that the piano
player will start playing at the bar of the Fairmont
Hotel just as 1 have to interview Kayo Hatta — whose
first feature film, "Picture Bride," opened last Friday. So
we commandeer the nearby restaurant, an oak-paneled
and burgundy-carpeted joint that's probably about as for
mal as San lose gets.
Leaning back against a booth in the waiting area, Hatta
seems relaxed discussing the long and uphill battle waged
to make "Picture Bride," which has garnered a distribu
tion deal with Miramax and an Audience Award from the
Sundance Film Festival— no small accomplishments for
a first-timer.
Hatta graduated from Stanford in 1981 with a bache
lor's in English, indulging in studio art classes, soaking up
the farm-like atmosphere and forging herself into "an as
piring painter, writer and photographer." She remembers
her Stanford days as a fond vacation, but also as a time of
political awakening.
"That's when I went through my Asian-American ac
tivism stage," though not without some early trepidation,
she says. Her sister lived at Okada House, so Hatta want
ed to stay away from "that whole scene."
However, the redress movement to pay back victims of
Japanese-American internment camps during World War
11 stirred her political instincts. A few years after gradua
tion, she worked in San Francisco with two documentary
filmmakers, shotting on Super 8 home-movie film. One
film centered on the history of Chinese immigration to
the West Coast through Angel Island while the other ex
amined the women's movement by exploring the history
of quilting. Hatta whetted her appetite further by attend-

ing a poetry and film workshop
at the Fort Mason Center in the
city.
This bare bones introduc
tion to filmmaking gave Hatta
the practical skills to finance
the budget for "Picture Bride,"
which topped out at $2 million,
a sum almost inconceivable by
1 lollywood's bloated standards,
where the average film hovers
over $40 million.
Hatta entered UCLA's grad
uate film program in 1986,
where she completed a short
film and beefed up her directing
skills. As she prepared for her
thesis film, the concept for "Pic
ture Bride" had already welled
up. "The subject grabbed me —
I didn't grab it," she says."It just
wouldn't let go."

personal backdrop for the tale. Her maternal grandmoth
er's experience, who immigrated to the United States in
the '20s and was later forced into an internment camp,
forms the basis for Riyo, the main character in "Picture
Bride," a young woman who emigrates from Japan to
marry a man she knows only through a small photo and a
few lines of haiku.
"I grew up hearing these stories, and to me the whole
picture bride phenomenon is so interesting," she says.
"My grandmothers were not picture brides— their expe
rience has been shaped by being first-generation Japanese
women in Hawaii. The picture bride experience is more of
a common history, Japanese and Korean history. The
whole phenomenon of two strangers meeting on a dock
on the basis of photographs, and that being the basis of all
these Japanese families to date—- that to me is a very com
pelling starting point."
Determined to make the film without handing off cre
ative control, Hatta decided to raise the money herself.
"Metaphorically speaking} we did it through little bake
sales," she says. She applied for grants from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endow
ment for the Arts — "those grants being phased out
under Gingrich" — and even the state ojf Hawaii, but
halfway through production, in the middle of a sugar
cane field, the production ran out of money.
Youki Kudoh, the actress who plays Riyo and is a well
known model and singer in Japan, called prospective in
vestors as a kind of "one woman telethon." Six hundred
thousand dollars came from an investor in exchange for
Japanese distribution rights.
But that money ran out as well. The film had reached a

rough cut stage and needed to attract a distributor who
would book theaters.
"It was an incredible dream when two (distributors) —
Sam Goldwyn and Miramax — were the ones that ended
up vying for the picture," she says. "Miramax came on
hoard at the end of '94 and that allowed us to finish the
film properly."
The film was a dubious proposition from the begin
ning — a first time director shooting a period film
on location, with no stars and an almost-all-Asian
cast. But Hatta and her team of producers turned a deaf
ear to the naysayers.
"We had total dedication and we weren't going to let
anyone get in the way of what we wanted to do," she
says. "We were all totally obsessed. This was a labor of
love. We were going to do it our way and we weren't
going to let anyone interfere with our vision. We weren't
going to have Riyo have an affair with a plantation
owner."
Despite the difficulties typical to location shooting —
insects, bad weather and, in this case, hurricanes that shut
down filming two times — Hatta made the film she want
ed to make.
"There were some magical moments," she says, "There
were scenes that were exactly the way I imagined it, and
where the line between fiction and history started to blur.
You forget that you're making a movie, where the acting
and lighting and everything comes together. You just
watch it and think, 'Are these the women we interviewed?
Are we looking back at them as young women?' That's
where its really exciting."

Hatta said she hopes that
her success with "Picture
Bride" will further opportu
nities for Asian American
filmmakers, a group affilia
tion she is unafraid to admit.
Films like "I'he Wed
ding Banquet," "Fat Drink
Man Woman," and the cine
matic flood from China have
established "a track record
of Asian films doing well,"
Hatta argues. "Hopefully
that will convince studios
that audiences are interested
in other cultures — surprise,
surprise. I think audiences
are just as sick of seeing the
business-as-usual stuff as we
are.
"For me, the most exciting
thing is what comes from me
and my heart," she says. "You
have to keep creating your
own opportunities and take
the risks on vour own."

You forget that you're making a movie, where the acting
and lighting and everything comes together. You just
watch it and think, 'Are these the women we interviewed?
Are we looking back at them as young women?' That's
where its really exciting."

Hatta said she hopes that
her success with "Picture
Bride" will further opportu
nities for Asian American
filmmakers, a group affilia
tion she is unafraid to admit.
Films like "I'he Wed
ding Banquet," "Fat Drink
Man Woman," and the cine
matic flood from China have
established "a track record
of Asian films doing well,"
Hatta argues. "Hopefully
that will convince studios
that audiences are interested
in other cultures — surprise,
surprise. I think audiences
are just as sick of seeing the
business-as-usual stuff as we
are.
"For me, the most exciting
thing is what comes from me
and my heart," she says. "You
have to keep creating your
own opportunities and take
the risks on vour own."
