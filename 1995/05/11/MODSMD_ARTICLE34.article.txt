The Claude Monet art exhibit at the de Young Museum
is a stroll down the garden path ofhis life. The exhibit
mixes elements of the gardens he painted with ele
ments ofhis life so that they seem as one.
"Monet: Late Paintings of Giverny n consists of 22 paint
ings done during his later years at Giverny, the estate north
of Paris which he transformed into a lush garden around
1890. Included in the exhibit are vintage photographs ofhis
life and a color photograph series which shows the Giverny
landscape today.
The exhibit pays tribute to the man who defined and mas
tered impressionism. Impressionism, an art movement
Monet began in the late 18th century, stresses the impor
tance of light and color over objective reality. Thede Young
pre.ss release characterizes Monet's painting in this manner:
"Broad, energetic brushstrokes of vibrant color float on the
two-dimensional surface of the canvas without stabilizing
reference to ground plane or horizon line."
But Monet was not just an artist, but an avid horticultur
ist as well. And the intersection of these two passions is ex
pressed in his artwork.
As a horticulturist, Monet collected volumes of gardening
books and planned his gardens carefully. According to the de
Young, the paths, the Japanese footbridge, the trellises and
the contrasts of his colorful flowers fascinated him: "Each
morning and afternoon he visited the pond to watch the lily
blossoms open and close."
Because of Monet s love for Giverny, it is fitting that the
de Young uses the theme ofhis house and gardens to
add to the viewer's experience of his life and work.
Giverny is simulated subtly to suggest Monet's inspirations,
without garishly mimicking it.
At the far end of the exhibit entrance room stands an
arrangement similar to the exterior of Monets house. The
pink stucco wall, pea green shutters and abundance of bright
flowers evoke the feeling of standing outside the estate. The
exhibit's lavender walls maintain the theme of flower gar
dens. The wood- patterned floor and small rooms seem more
like a house than a museum.
Yet the large tree in the arrangement is flanked by two bay
windows which expose many people looking at paintings in
an adjacent room. The crowds and their murmuring then in
trude, and the setting's similarity to Giverny is only one as
pect of the exhibit that depicts the different chapters of
Monet's life.
As the garden theme enlightens the viewer to his artistic
inspiration, the archival photographs of Monet in the gar
dens and in his studio, with friends and family, are a visual
history. The photograph of Monet and his wife surrounded
by pigeons expresses the artists whimsical life. He has a pi
geon on his head, and his wife's hat looks like it is topped
with a pigeon as well.
The room glowing with color photographs of Giverny
record the setting that Monet studied. Photographs and
written explanations detail how Monet worked with his gar
dens to enhance his famous impressionist style. As one de
scription says, "Monet employed artificial structures, such as
arbors and trellises, to spread the color of the garden above
low lying flower beds."
But nothing can describe Monet's life like his paintings.

The paintings unfold both his passions and his tragedies.
"The House from the Rose Garden" is one of Monet's
later works that illustrates his deteriorating sight. He ac
quired cataracts late in life which allowed him to see only
warm colors. The painting is a swirl of reds and deep pur
plish tones against a yellow sky. As one of is favorite flow
ers, Monet worked with roses often. "Roses were the main
stay of Monet's summer garden, and he planted them in
masses of color, arranging natural beauty according to the
same principles he used to create his canvases." One of the
rose paintings in the show is a colorful tapestry of pink and
red bushes of flowers against a rich background.
De Young's unique reconstruction of Monet's artistic
environment combined with Monet's artwork cre
ates an experience that goes beyond the standard art
show. Like chapters of Monet's biography, the paintings are
descriptive paragraphs and the photographs, the underlying
themes. The exhibit at the de Young allows the viewer to walk
through Monet's life, if only for a moment.
