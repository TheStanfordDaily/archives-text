# Step into the ephemeral.... Interactive art ceremony explores life's complexities
## 
### Sam Park 
The only way some of us will ever he artists is by paint
ing our bodies blue, plastering ourselves to a wall and
calling that performance art. But now there might be
an easier way to become part of something artistic: One
might step into a performance installation called "Ephemer
al Ceremony— Essential Epiphanies" on Tuesday afternoon;
the event is hosted by the Drama Department.
For the interactive art piece, the audience steps onto the
Memorial Auditorium stage and becomes part of the exhibit
ed artwork.

"It's an installation meant to have humans in there. That's
when the art becomes complete — when the human form is
added," said designer and co-organizer Stephanie Felton-
Priestner. "That's when you see the contrast between the or
ganic and the man-made. There's the element of visual con
trast between the permanent and the ephemeral."
Part-exhibit, part-performance, the presentation features
sculptural forms that the audience can look at while listening
to the computer-generated music and sound. The installation
will present a mixture of artistic forms, not just design and
audio, but also dance and poetry. High Speed Pink, a recent
ly-created Stanford improvisational dance ensemble, will
provide movement, while local singer Emily Be/.ar will read.
"It's the culmination of walking through a gallery, and
going to a concert, and seeing a performance — all meshed
together," Felton-Priestner said.
Graduate student and co-organizer R.J. Fleck's sound
score is an example of how digital manipulation and natural
recordings can be used to create art. During Bezar's reading
performance, Fleck sonically manipulates her voice through
computers.
"There's also a kind of backdrop soundscape which was
pre-recorded, and created by digital and sonic manipulations
of Emily's voice," Fleck said. "It provides a curtain, a sonic
screen almost, in which she performs."
The word "ephemeral"
The title "Ephemeral Ceremony" comes directly from the
issues explored in the presentation. Among the long list of ab
stract ideas illustrated, the opposition of the ephemeral ver
sus the permanent is explored.
"As this piece sort of evolved, I started looking at things
that were ephemeral rather than permanent," Felton-Priest
ner said, mentioning buildings as an example of the perma
nent and a sunset as something ephemeral.
"My exploration of what was there in the text [written by
Fleck| makes it clear that you can't tell what is ephemeral and
what is permanent at first glance," she added, using the ex
amples of ice and acrylic.
To create the structure for the space, Felton-Priestner used
acrylic, ice, metal, light, and the human form (audience
members as well as the dance ensemble High Speed Pink).
"Also, the text has the tone of a rite of passage," Felton-
Priestner said, explaining the title. "R.J. refers to it as almost
having the feeling of an abortion in the spiritual sense, of
being pulled out of something."
The "Essential Epiphanies" of the title are important, be-

cause, according to Felton-Priestner, these are the "essential
things in a person's lite, not whether that person has a Mer
cedes."
Fleck describes these epiphanies as "moments of decision
— psychological crises, but not necessarily in a negative way.
These offer the possibility of transformation. The piece is
about that psychological transformation."
Other words Felton-Priestner and Fleck considered for the
title — "ritual," for example— they crossed out for being too
specific or too loaded, in the case of "organic."

"The context of this ex
ploration has evolved into a
meditative, quasi-ceremonial

environment," Felton

Speakers Bureau events. Not exactly the place that immediate
ly comes to mind when someone says "art," or "performance"
or "design."
But for Felton-Priestner and Fleck, the huge auditorium
provided a once-in-a-lifetime challenge / opportunity.
"We'll never again have the chance to work in such a huge
space outside the University," said Felton-Priestner. "The way
1 picture it, 1 want the person to feel like he's entering this in
nerspace. The human form would be highlighted because of
its contrast to the rest of the environment."
Felton-Priestner was also intrigued by the fact that Memo
rial Auditorium is often used for theatrical productions.
"There is this idea that theater is a very ephemeral art
form," she said. "The stage is crafted to give the appearance of
permanent reality, but it can be torn down in a few hours."
Fleck was equally intrigued by the size of Memorial Audi
torium, but from a sonic perspective.
"The space has a lot of potential for us to get sonic quali
ties," Fleck said. "Stephanie was more intrigued by it as a set.
She wanted to use that space in a creative fashion.

"We almost envision the entire space as a kind of being in
side someone's mind, inside someone's area of awareness," he
added.
Paper fights or no paper fights, the presentation will allow
students to see another side of Memorial Auditorium, as it
displays performance art that is more serious than light.
"I hope this presentation will attract some people who are
interested in exploring the space in Memorial Auditorium in
a way other than Flicks. Not that Flicks aren't fun. 1 enjoyed
them when I was an undergraduate here," Felton-Priestner
said. "(Our project | is an interesting combination of technol
ogy and the arts."
"It's not the type of art that you see every day on campus,"
Fleck added. "It's unusual."
Ephemeral depictions through technology
All the talk of sonic manipulation of human voices and
multi-sensory experiences may suggest too much technology
and not enough heart, but it is the very idea of human experi
ence and human emotion that is at the core of the presentation.
"The presentation will highlight the significance of the
connection between people, and between organic forms,"
Felton-Priestner said. "The piece to me is a lot about the im
portance of connections to humanity. The most significant
connections that people have had may appear to be ephemer
al when in reality they're the most permanent."
Fleck also feels that the most important things can't be
measured. "These are things that can't be quantified, or put
into a bank. They're the most important things to give us a
sense of identity," Fleck said.
Both Fleck and Felton-Priestner hope that the audience
leaves with questions in their heads, with the feeling that they
had been somewhere and that they didn't just

watch a performance.

" They help form the envi

ronment. The envi
ronment is not com
plete without the peo
ple in it," reminded
Felton-Priestner.

ing our bodies blue, plastering ourselves to a wall and
calling that performance art. But now there might be
an easier way to become part of something artistic: One
might step into a performance installation called "Ephemer
al Ceremony— Essential Epiphanies" on Tuesday afternoon;
the event is hosted by the Drama Department.
For the interactive art piece, the audience steps onto the
Memorial Auditorium stage and becomes part of the exhibit
ed artwork.

"It's an installation meant to have humans in there. That's
when the art becomes complete — when the human form is
added," said designer and co-organizer Stephanie Felton-
Priestner. "That's when you see the contrast between the or
ganic and the man-made. There's the element of visual con
trast between the permanent and the ephemeral."
Part-exhibit, part-performance, the presentation features
sculptural forms that the audience can look at while listening
to the computer-generated music and sound. The installation
will present a mixture of artistic forms, not just design and
audio, but also dance and poetry. High Speed Pink, a recent
ly-created Stanford improvisational dance ensemble, will
provide movement, while local singer Emily Be/.ar will read.
"It's the culmination of walking through a gallery, and
going to a concert, and seeing a performance — all meshed
together," Felton-Priestner said.
Graduate student and co-organizer R.J. Fleck's sound
score is an example of how digital manipulation and natural
recordings can be used to create art. During Bezar's reading
performance, Fleck sonically manipulates her voice through
computers.
"There's also a kind of backdrop soundscape which was
pre-recorded, and created by digital and sonic manipulations
of Emily's voice," Fleck said. "It provides a curtain, a sonic
screen almost, in which she performs."
The word "ephemeral"
The title "Ephemeral Ceremony" comes directly from the
issues explored in the presentation. Among the long list of ab
stract ideas illustrated, the opposition of the ephemeral ver
sus the permanent is explored.
"As this piece sort of evolved, I started looking at things
that were ephemeral rather than permanent," Felton-Priest
ner said, mentioning buildings as an example of the perma
nent and a sunset as something ephemeral.
"My exploration of what was there in the text [written by
Fleck| makes it clear that you can't tell what is ephemeral and
what is permanent at first glance," she added, using the ex
amples of ice and acrylic.
To create the structure for the space, Felton-Priestner used
acrylic, ice, metal, light, and the human form (audience
members as well as the dance ensemble High Speed Pink).
"Also, the text has the tone of a rite of passage," Felton-
Priestner said, explaining the title. "R.J. refers to it as almost
having the feeling of an abortion in the spiritual sense, of
being pulled out of something."
The "Essential Epiphanies" of the title are important, be-

HOW MUCH: Free

cause, according to Felton-Priestner, these are the "essential
things in a person's lite, not whether that person has a Mer
cedes."
Fleck describes these epiphanies as "moments of decision
— psychological crises, but not necessarily in a negative way.
These offer the possibility of transformation. The piece is
about that psychological transformation."
Other words Felton-Priestner and Fleck considered for the
title — "ritual," for example— they crossed out for being too
specific or too loaded, in the case of "organic."

"The context of this ex
ploration has evolved into a
meditative, quasi-ceremonial

environment," Felton
Priestner and Fleck
stated in a press re
lease. "We hope to pro
vide the audience an
opportunity to con
nect with the spirit of
complex ideas through

a multi-sensory experience.

No paper fights today

better known as the offi-

cial on-campus site for Sunday night paper fights and ASSU
Speakers Bureau events. Not exactly the place that immediate
ly comes to mind when someone says "art," or "performance"
or "design."
But for Felton-Priestner and Fleck, the huge auditorium
provided a once-in-a-lifetime challenge / opportunity.
"We'll never again have the chance to work in such a huge
space outside the University," said Felton-Priestner. "The way
1 picture it, 1 want the person to feel like he's entering this in
nerspace. The human form would be highlighted because of
its contrast to the rest of the environment."
Felton-Priestner was also intrigued by the fact that Memo
rial Auditorium is often used for theatrical productions.
"There is this idea that theater is a very ephemeral art
form," she said. "The stage is crafted to give the appearance of
permanent reality, but it can be torn down in a few hours."
Fleck was equally intrigued by the size of Memorial Audi
torium, but from a sonic perspective.
"The space has a lot of potential for us to get sonic quali
ties," Fleck said. "Stephanie was more intrigued by it as a set.
She wanted to use that space in a creative fashion.

"We almost envision the entire space as a kind of being in
side someone's mind, inside someone's area of awareness," he
added.
Paper fights or no paper fights, the presentation will allow
students to see another side of Memorial Auditorium, as it
displays performance art that is more serious than light.
"I hope this presentation will attract some people who are
interested in exploring the space in Memorial Auditorium in
a way other than Flicks. Not that Flicks aren't fun. 1 enjoyed
them when I was an undergraduate here," Felton-Priestner
said. "(Our project | is an interesting combination of technol
ogy and the arts."
"It's not the type of art that you see every day on campus,"
Fleck added. "It's unusual."
Ephemeral depictions through technology
All the talk of sonic manipulation of human voices and
multi-sensory experiences may suggest too much technology
and not enough heart, but it is the very idea of human experi
ence and human emotion that is at the core of the presentation.
"The presentation will highlight the significance of the
connection between people, and between organic forms,"
Felton-Priestner said. "The piece to me is a lot about the im
portance of connections to humanity. The most significant
connections that people have had may appear to be ephemer
al when in reality they're the most permanent."
Fleck also feels that the most important things can't be
measured. "These are things that can't be quantified, or put
into a bank. They're the most important things to give us a
sense of identity," Fleck said.
Both Fleck and Felton-Priestner hope that the audience
leaves with questions in their heads, with the feeling that they
had been somewhere and that they didn't just

watch a performance.

" They help form the envi

ronment. The envi
ronment is not com
plete without the peo
ple in it," reminded
Felton-Priestner.
