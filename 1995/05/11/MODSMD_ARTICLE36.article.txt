# Grub Focus on: Caffé Verona
## 
### Chris Levinson 
Some do it alone. Others in pairs. Some
need peace and quiet while 1 like it noisy with
a hot cup o' joe. The message is simple: Got
work? Head for a coffee house. The recent
caffeine hut invasion means that each spot
has to offer more than just a house blend.
Whether it's books, live music or a decent

turkey sandwich, coffee houses are offering
more than just java.
The first in the Peninsula Caffe chain,
Caffe Verona is celebrating its 10th anniver
sary this weekend. Use it as an excuse to sink
your teeth into one of their dense panini
sandwiches, piled high with the necessary
goodies — everything from eggplant to sala
mi, fontina or mozzarella.
In a valiant attempt to broaden my hori
zons, I had picked out an exotic Mediter
ranean cafe for this night's outing. When I ar
rive to pick up friend S. — "I feel like pasta"
— the original plan is immediately sacked.
So 1 set the car on course for Verona.
A step beyond the usual fare, Caffe Verona
offers a split experience. Choose to sit by the
bar and sip at your Moca Mint ($2.50), or take
your Macchiato ($1.50) out front and grab a
seat by the sidewalk for a close-up and person
al view of Palo Alto pedestrians. Or if it's a meal
your after, slide into a corner table in back, or a
twosome by the sky-high windows facing out
onto Hamilton Avenue. And that's only the be
ginning of your decisions....
"This is just what I needed," coos S. as he

works on a platter of rotelli swimming in
mozzarella, parmesan and tucked in between
tomatoes ($7.50). Toss in a tossed salad for an
extra $2.50. Be wary of the sheer size of the
lettuce leaves — I went home wearing a tasty
hut permanent sprinkling of vinaigrette.
This is no Palo Alto pasta. No mangled
mash of carbo clumps attempting to live up
to names such as penne, fusilli, even the fa
miliar spaghetti. This is the real thing. The
lasagna hides layers of peppered ground
meat, tomatoes and scatterings of spinach
beneath sheets of pasta al dente — just right
($8.50). The fusilli comes in a coat of white
cream or tangy tomato ($7.50). Add that slice
of baguette resting beside your pasta prefer
ence and you've found yourself a good thing.
Not in a pasta mood? Opt for thick sliced
bread dusted with flour, housing turkey and
fontina or salami and provolone ($4.95) be
neath its folds. Or soup and salad for $6.95 —

and I'm talking Greek, Caesar, spinach or
fruit. Now I'm not saying that people travel
far and wide for this Caffe fare. The service is
coffee house slow, and they could improve on
personality. But the choices are plentiful, if a
bit pricey, and the place is a clean break from
your standard Palo Alto options. So, finish it
off slow. Whether you take it black or with
cream and sugar, sit back and sip the coffee of
your choice. And don't forget to blow.

Sunday 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
WHERE: 236 Hamilton Ave., Palo Alto;
