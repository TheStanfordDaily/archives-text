cc ■y -yello?" Juliana Hatfield intones
I lin an Earth-to-interviewer way.
The gentle nudge of her voice breaks
through then makes worse the uncomfort
able silence that has settled mid-way through
the 20-minute question-and-answer session.
The quiet mumbling on the other end of the
bad connection amplifies that sinking feel
ing on this end: Only at half-time and I've
run out of questions to ask, with nothing left
on the ample list of topics to discuss and with
nothing to latch on to from her demure re
sponses. Evasive was the word Hatfield's own
publicity rep at Atlantic Records used to de
scribe the 27-year-old minstress, though
elusive might be more accurate.
Anyone who has heard a Juliana Hatfield
tune or read a write-up 011 the enigmatic
artist has come to expect frustration from
her. Willfully or no, that sense of frustration
is also what makes her and her songs strong
and appealing. She's the one everybody loves
but you, the good girl with the bad vibes.
As the original girl-rocker-who-would
be-alt-rock-queen, Hatfield has attracted
closer scrutiny than her musical popularity
would suggest; after all, the sassy Generation
Lollapalooza types seem more interested in
whether she's still a virgin than when a new
album is coming out. To a degree, her music
has been overshadowed by her Sphinx-like
answers to impertinent questions.
CC 112 I are a lot of people who've
heard my name and not my
JL music," Hatfield agrees in a bare
ly distinguishable voice. "But then there are a
lot of people who've heard my music but
don't know my name.
"[People] don't really know me. They
know what they read. Which isn't really real
ity."
Being difficult and different only piques
the curiosity of factoid-hungry Alternative
Nation. She's like the case of the indie
princess to be cracked, the mystery that
everybody loves. So even if Hatfield isn't
playing a game, let's assume that she is —
that's what pop stars do, isn't it?
But as frustrating as it is to talk to Hat
field, there's a sincerity that ekes through in
her enigmatic replies. The hems and haws
and hesitations which dot what she says give
her away: She's trying to accommodate, but
it's just "hard to talk about" something as
"really private" as her music.
"Well, I know what I'm trying to say,"
Hatfield explains. "I know exactly what I'm
saying in a song. I just don't need it to be so
obvious to other people. Because that's bor
ing."
On her latest album "Only Everything,"
Hatfield has moved away from straightfor
ward verse-chorus-verse narratives to more
oblique, stream of consciousness-like pop
songs. While her earlier material couldn't
help but attract intrusive queries with its
frank, songs-as-journal-entries quality, this

newest batch of songs exude the same kind of
feeling while keeping private things private.
As the singer / guitarist tells it, she wanted
"to leave some loose ends and make [her
songs] more open to interpretation." That's a
surprisingly bold move, especially for some
one who has been misquoted and misunder
stood so often.
Then again, "Only Everything" is Hat
field's boldest work yet, sounding more con
fident and more ambitious than anything
else she has done. From the album's first
jumpy riff on, the tone is loud and vivid. Still
the paradigm of the girl-with-a-guitar, Hat
field picks up on then one-ups her bubble
grunge efforts on 1993's "Become What You
Are." This time, she seems more comfortable
in her big sound surroundings, striking a
better balance between the growl-and-whine
of her guitar work and the whine-and-whis
per of her girlish voice.
Hatfield also seems to have come to terms
with her role as a performer: On "Only
Everything," she sings to an audience for the
first time, picking her gaze up from her feet
and fixing it on someone else. The manic
opening cut "What a Life" takes you head on
in a blur of words and sensations. There's an
air of exasperation in the chorus that speaks
to the listener as much as it does for herself.
So while Hatfield's songs have always ex
pressed longing and frustration palpably,
tunes like the fragmented "Dumb Fun" and
the agitated "OK. OK." connect to the every
man's everyday distress in a way her previ
ous, more introspective material doesn't.
She doesn't spell everything out and she
doesn't really have to.
"I can't make [anybody] understand it,"
Hatfield says, wearied and almost standoff
ishly. "I can't. It's not me who can do it. I did
it in the music already. I can't explain it. They
either get it or they don't."
That get-it-or-don't attitude has been
the distinguishing mark of Hatfield's
musical career, even before there was
one. Making music was something Hatfield
"got" — "Music was just what I had to do,"
Hatfield says about her muse. Growing up in
suburban Massachusetts, her tinkering with
music began in high school when she set her
poetry to music. It was also around that time
that Hatfield was initially exposed to punk
rock. Her first all-ages show? Of course, it
was the Violent Femmes and the Del Fuegos,
as she sings about in her biggest hit, "My Sis
ter."
Hatfield got her first opportunity to turn
her passion into practice when she played in
the punkish-pop trio Blake Babies during
her college days at Boston's Berklee School of
Music in the mid-1980s. A mousy, brace
faced misfit, she was the right misfit to lead a
band of them. Recruited by schoolmates
John Strohm and Freda Love Boner to front
their group named for William Blake by
Allen Ginsberg, Hatfield overcame her shy
ness and helped to establish the Blake Babies

as a college radio mainstay until the band
broke up early this decade.
The Blake Babies' charmingly amateur
pop is the sound of reach exceeding grasp. In
the best sense of that backhanded compli
ment, the band put together three albums
and one EP of satisfying three-minute pop
tunes that were speedy and a step slow at the
same time, endearing because they weren't
anywhere close to perfect. Although it was
far from a solo gig for Hatfield, the kid
voiced singer / bassist gave the Blake Babies
its identity. Years removed, the trio's quirky
la-la stuff still shines with the naive knowing
and guileless melodrama evoked by Hat
field's vocals. Aptly enough, the group's
post-mortem compilation is titled "Inno
cence and Experience," both a nod to its
namesake and a simple way to describe its
pleasant music.
Tired of the band dynamic, Hatfield left
the Blake Babies to pursue a solo career.
From the start, she had all the right creden
tials — a central role in a critical favorite that
could've been the next big thing, a right-on
pop sensibility and indie-rock lineage — to
inspire lofty expectations. Her sparkling solo
debut, 1992's "Hey Babe," lived up to the
hype and also generated more.
More than any of her material before and
since, "Hey Babe" packs a heartbreakingly
emotional wallop. Like an 11-song diary, the
album moves fluidly from what-ifs to could
bes between its verses and choruses. The best
songs tell neurotic stories which are
poignant and powerful in their plainness.
On "Everybody Loves Me But You," Hat
field pines over the love she can't have and
the dull life she does, her cold, cold bed and
her broken heart all to the perfectly bitter
sweet sound of her chimey voice and her
chiming guitar. And anybody who's heard
"Ugly" can't help but remember when Hat
field meekly sings, "Cause I'm ugly / With a
capital 'U' / And I don't need a mirror to see
that it's true." With nothing but a guitar to
accompany her, the moment is pop music at
its most vulnerably affirming, where the
artist goes beyond seeing something she
doesn't want to and faces up to it by express
ing it.
By all accounts, Hatfield herself didn't like
"Hey Babe." As she told Rolling Stone, the
album "didn't sound confident at all" and
that she was "[saying] all these things other
people were too embarrassed to say." Her
own self-criticism only underscores the im
pact of the underappreciated work: It is pre
cisely because she is able to say all the things
most people are too embarrassed to say that
makes "Hey Babe" so engrossing and evoca
tive.
In a way, Hatfield's next project, 1993's
"Become What You Are," is a reaction to
the resigned introspection of "Hey Babe"
and to the intrusive spotlight into which she
was thrown after that scrutinized album.
Consequently, the questions "Hey Babe"

raised about her love life were redirected to
wards whether she really had a sister or not
and what she had against super models.
Perhaps a better title for the album would
be "Becoming What You Are," because the
sophomore effort sounded like Hatfield was
changing her bearings without fully know
ing where she was headed. Lacking both the
instant impact and cohesion of the outing
before, her almost breakthrough tried to re
place intimate intensity with a farther
reaching exuberance to mixed results. The
best tunes, like the love-hate power ballad
"My Sister" and the chug-a-lug havoc of "A
Dame with a Rod," appeal with their high
energy level; the more cloying moments —
the song about the dead baby bird and the
slurred chorus of "I Got No Idols" that
comes out like "I've got the wuddles" come
to mind — leave listeners wondering why.
With the release of "Only Everything,"
"Become What You Are" takes on the feel of
a work of transition.
"Yeah, I can appreciate the older stuff bet
ter now," Hatfield says. "Cause it's farther
away. Not so much with 'Hey Babe.' But now
that I've got this new thing to compare the
last record to, the last record now seems real
ly kind of weak compared to this one.
"[lt sounds] squashed.... It's got good
energy, but it just sounds like there's a sheen
over it."
In contrast, the new album came out the
way Hatfield wanted it. For the first time,
she took co-production credit, although
she's "always in there directing." "Nobody's
going to tell me how to make a record," she
emphatically declares, in as tough a tone as
her voice can muster.
Indeed, Hatfield the producer furnishes a
feel that's appropriate for the sound of "Only
Everything." The singles are polished like
singles should be, the acoustic pieces come
up-close, and the raucous numbers stay
rough-hewn. Apparently, learning from ex
perience has helped Hatfield reign in the un
focused energy of "Become What You Are"
and do more with the sound she wants. That
might have to do with her improved com
mand of the guitar exhibited through the
whole album or with just being better accus
tomed to the process of making music. So
though "Only Everything" isn't quite every
thing, the album finds Hatfield further down
the road to becoming what she is.
But on the flip side of experience is inno
cence, the innate ability to go with the flow.
Like being able to immerse oneself into feel
ing, as Hatfield did when she tried to "trans
fer" her tears into music on the buzzing cas
cades of "Simplicity Is Beautiful." When she
croons "simple feeling" over a few measures
on that song, it's all Hatfield needs to do to
get her message across.
"[Creativity] is like life, part of life. It
shouldn't be something you have to do. It's
just part of life to create these songs If you
have to turn it off and on, it's not really living."
