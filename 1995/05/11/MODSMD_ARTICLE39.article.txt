While Green Day counters its unhappi
ness by tearing up a sofa on MTV, groups
like the Grifters and the American Music
Gluh have been exploring traditional sor
row from their own slightly disoriented an
gles, with consistently engaging results.
From these bands come a pair of new half
albums: "The Eureka e.p." from the Grifters
and the "Hello Amsterdam" HP from the
American Music Glub.
Recorded entirely on a four-track
recorder, "The Eureka e.p." has a distinctly
home-made flavor, but static and noise are

held to a minimum. The band creates a
deep, stark soundscape that's slightly clean
er and slower than past Grifters releases, yet
it retains the rock sensibility and emotion
al urgency that have made its previous
work memorable.
"The Eureka e.p." starts with "Eureka
1.V.," one of the most tender bits of indie
rock since Pavement's "Here." The song
subtly piles on intensity, as Grifters'
singer guitarist Dave Shouse wails about
"time spent frozen, weighed down, broken
like this pocket-watch I'm holding."
The heart-felt balladry of "Eureka 1.V."
and "Founder's Day Parade" are balanced
by equally rewarding rock tracks like "His
Jesus Song," "X-Ray Hip" and "Banjo." Led
by dragging and swinging verses and hol
low percussion, "Banjo" reaches climax
when its sweet Beatles-y chorus turns into a
scream-fest that's desperate, threatening
and triumphant.
Slightly more polished, but still with
that dragged-through-the-mud feel is the
American Music Club's latest, "Hello
Amsterdam." The high-point of this six
song EP is "I Just Took My Two Sleeping
Pills and Now I'm Like a Bridegroom
Standing at the Altar," which begins with
singer / songwriter Mark Eitzel's worn-

out strains before
evolving into an
eerie charge of joy
less pep.

Most of the EP reflects this mix of clas
sic AMC melancholy and fast, spirited
rock â€” a mix that gives "Hello Amster
dam" much of its charm, but at times de
tracts from the stark beauty of Eitzel's
songwriting. The band's stretch towards
fuller and cleaner pop music wouldn't nec
essarily be a bad thing if Mark Eitzel's voice
and lyrics weren't so perfectly suited for
the stripped-down and medium-paced
sounds that have worked wonders in the
past.
But even on the Disney-like ballad "On
a Clear Day You Can See Forever" or the
lackluster title track (originally from the
band's latest full-length "San Francisco"),
Eitzel's personality outshines average song
structures, making the EP's very worst mo
ments still worthwhile.
Like the Grifters, the American Music
Club works best when things aren't quite
perfect. Rather than calculated musician
ship, both "the Eureka e.p." and "Hello
Amsterdam" work off of rich personality,
often best revealed through flaws and
blemishes.
