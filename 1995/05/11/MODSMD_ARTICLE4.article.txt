# Ascending applications
## URO major grant proposals hit high 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
A record-setting number of
Stanford students applied for
Undergraduate Research Op
portunities major grants this
year, reinforcing a steady up
ward trend observed since the
program began in 1985, said
URO Director Laura Selznick.
A total of 247 undergradu
ates submitted proposals to re
ceive URO major grant funding
for projects encompassing a va
riety of academic disciplines.
Last year, 236 students applied
for such grants.
In all, 430 students applied
for a variety of grants offered
through the URO office, includ
ing major and small grants and
sophomore Chappell-Lougee
scholarships. That figure is
down from last year's total of
440 applicants but Selznick said
the office is still considering a

handful of outstanding re
quests.
Major grants, which offer a
maximum award of $2,500, can
be applied not only toward re
search materials but also to
summer living and travel ex
penses.
Among this group, 183 appli
cants have requested grants in
the natural and social sciences.
In the humanities and creative
arts, 64 proposals have been
submitted for review.
In addition, URO has re
ceived 71 applications for small
grants, which provide up to $500
worth of funding. Most of the
students in the small grant ap
plication pool are seniors writ
ing honors theses, Selznick said.
Last year, the approval rate
for undergraduates applying for
mqjor URO grants was about 63
percent. Selznick said that be
tween 80 and 85 percent of propos
als for both iroyor and small grants
are approved for funding. Prospects
for this year's applicants look
roughly comparable to last year's,
Selznick said. In 1985, URO's first
year, only 19 of 52 imyor grant
applicants received funding.
The number of students
applying for and receiving URO
major grants has increased every
year since the program's incep
tion. Selznick attributed the rise
to increased awareness of the
benefits and the opportunities
Stanford offers undergraduates
interested in pursuing academic
research.
In addition, she said that
demand for URO funding is
related to increased student
interest in writing theses. In

1985, 13 percent of graduating
seniors wrote honors theses —
compared to nearly 28 percent
today.
Increased funding from vari
ous private donors — amounting
this year to a total endowment of
$2.2 million — will allow more
students to receive the finances
needed to support their research
ventures, Selznick said. Donors
"get a lot out of seeing their
money make a difference in the
lives of undergraduates," she
said.
The Biology Department, for
example, has recently received a
new grant from the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute which
will enhance the number of fund
ing opportunities for undergrad
uate biology majors.
The final decisions made by
the various departments review
ing this year's pool of URO appli
cations will be announced on
May 26.
