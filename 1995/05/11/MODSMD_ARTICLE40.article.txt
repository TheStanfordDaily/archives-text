# BUCKSHOT LEFONQUE
## Buckshot LeFonque 
### 
With his latest project, "Buckshot Le-
Fonque," '90s pop saxophone guru Branford
Marsalis rides the treacherous waves of
trendy, and unfortunately falls short of his
previous perfect marks.
Labeled an "acid jazz" event, the album
has all the atomic potential of the Los Alam
os project. Musicians include the Marsalis
clan, the awesome Kenny Kirkland on piano,
Victor Wooten's monster bass work, Jeff
"Tain" Watts on drums and Roy Hargrove on
trumpet. But the key word in the comparison
to Los Alamos is "potential."
The real problem with this album, which
succeeds on many levels, is that it plays to a
mainstream pop sensibility, which is not very
"acid jazzy." For instance, the cheese-soul of
"Ain't it funny" is sorely out of place, nestled
as it is between gems like the only slightly
corn-ball "Wonders and Signs" and the
southern-folk groove a la Arrested Develop
ment of "Some Cow Fonque (More Tea,
Vicar?)." "Some Cow Fonque" also showcas
es Marsalis' playing — as opposed to his pro
duction, which is not his strong suit.
Also out of place is the album's single "No
Pain, No Gain," which really has nothing to
do with any other track on the album —
from a purely aesthetic standpoint — and
makes the album less coherent. The song is a
fast-paced distorted guitar groove that
sounds like an out-take from the first Living
Color album. Flear what I'm saying?
On the plus side, the majority of the

album is solid, jazz-funk laden groove like
the one true acid-jazz number, "Breakfast (®
Denny's," which has thumping, looped sam
ples combined with some impressive over
laid sax solos. Also, "Hotter Than Hot" kicks
a sweet reggae groove with vocals by Black
heart.
As an introduction to the now pop realm
of acid jazz, this album is a winner. As a
mainstream disc of jazz-hip hop for the
semi-soulful, this album is a winner. Howev
er, this is not the impressive, groundbreaking
work one expects from one of the most tal
ented musicians of our time.
If you want a much better introduction to
acid-jazz and some generally sweet
Jazz / Hip-Hop grooves that will send you to
the next level, save your money on Branford
and check out the Red Hot + Gool compila
tion disc, "Stolen Moments."
