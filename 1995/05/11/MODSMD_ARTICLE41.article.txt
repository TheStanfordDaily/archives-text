# BOB DYLAN
## Unplugged 
### 
The growth of American music over the
last the last three decades would be unimag
inable without the influence of Bob Dylan.
John Lennon himself said that he never
imagined that music could be so personally
and emotionally direct before hearing
Dylan's music.
The contributions Dylan made to rock
and roll are staggering. Successfully trans
mitting the political sensibilities of folk
music to rock and roll, Dylan added a politi
cal dimension to the music that was simply
never conceived of before. Also the first lyri

cist who could be legitimately be regarded as
a poet, Dylan demonstrated that rock and
roll was truly an art form.
Finally, although he changed the land
scape of American popular music dramati
cally, Dylan never abandoned his love of his
roots, rock and roll, blues, folk and country.
In fact, Dylan may be largely responsible for
the long endurance of rock. By turning it into
an art form capable of dealing with deep po
litical and personal conflicts, he insured that
rock and roll would never be dismissed as a
dance craze from the '50s.
Dylan's genius wove together Woody
Guthrie, Jack Kerouac, and Little Richard, a
mix few believed could be possible.
The release of a Dylan "Unplugged"
album is an enticing opportunity for the
artist. Invariably, the most interesting "Un
plugged" albums come from artists who are
reinterpreting some of their greatest work, as
was the case with Neil Young and Eric Clap
ton, and for years in live performances,
Dylan has been finding new meaning within
his earlier works.
Composed mostly of songs from the first
five years of his career, the album documents
an astonishing performance.
Dylan's voice, which has aged consider
ably, brings his earliest, most political works,
"The Times They Are A-Changin'," "John
Brown," and "With God On Our Side," a new
wisdom, replacing some of the urgency of the
originals.
"Tombstone Blues," "Rainy Day Women
#12 & 35" and "All Along The Watchtower"
let Dylan flex a little rock and roll muscle, and
"Desolation Row" sounds surprisingly fresh.
"Dignity" and "Shooting Star," both rela
tively new songs, are given such life by Dylan
that they easily stand tall by his greatest
works.
However, "Knockin' On Heaven's Door"

provides the album's greatest moment.
Dylan's voice is stark and exhausted, ab
solutely perfect for the material, a beautiful
moment from a legend whose time is not
over yet.
