# MOBB DEEP
## The 						Infamous 
### 
In a grating display of raw survivalism un
precedented even in the rawest of genres,
Mobb Deep's "The Infamous" is about to
brand rap's conscience with its own worst
nightmare: reality. It's the world that couldn't
be; a scenario in which society's softies and
piddling pansies have never felt so exposed.
Meanwhile, scammasters of the funk wildly
scramble for scraps of dignity, pitifully re
membering the days of fat cat trickery, shiv
ering in a subzero maelstrom of scandal.
High above the billows of controversy re
sides a posse of unparalleled grit, a crew
whose message has blatantly stripped layers
of Teflon kimono to reveal poo-poo shimmy
shamming. And what is the impetus of this
revolution of the real? Perhaps Mobb Deep
member Havic explains it best in a caveat to
fakers entitled "The Infamous Prelude," a so
liloquy of sorts that outlines a credo of the
strong fist and iron soul. After that, "The In
famous" follows a path of biting resilience,
pounding earholes with track titles like "Cra
dle to the Grave," "Survival of the Fittest" and
"Party Over." Weak stomached individuals
need not apply.
In an urban jungle grown wild with the
vines of poverty and destitution, Mobb
Deep's thorns of survivalism manifest them
selves in the musical componentry of the
rugged beat and macabre melody. Armed
with a motif of overcooked bass slaps and
abrasive loops, dirt-soiled ghetto tales are
told at volume 10, each one as depressing as

its predecessor. The pre-release jam that first
turned heads, "Shook Ones Pt. II," is a steel
lined tour dc force, a roller coaster proclama
tion of warlike superiority: "If I die, I
couldn't choose a better location / When the
slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation /
Getting closer to God in a tight
situation / Now, take these words home and
think it through / Or the next rhyme I write
could be about you."
For rap-philes and casual listeners alike,
"The Infamous" may satisfy a stomach emp
tied by plastic fast food performances and
styrofoam images. Unfortunately, Mobb
Deep pays a dear price for originality by rais
ing the premium on sloppy social messages
and reasonless violence, a crusade that can
only curl around into perpetual decadence
and poverty.
Perhaps the best way to enjoy this project
is with a grain of salt, or, for that matter, sev
eral. Rawness almost always requires some
thing to ease the pain.
