# MOBB DEEP
## The
						Infamous 
### 
In a grating display of raw survivalism un
precedented even in the rawest of genres,
Mobb Deep's "The Infamous" is about to
brand rap's conscience with its own worst
nightmare: reality. It's the world that couldn't
be; a scenario in which society's softies and
piddling pansies have never felt so exposed.
Meanwhile, scammasters of the funk wildly
scramble for scraps of dignity, pitifully re
membering the days of fat cat trickery, shiv
ering in a subzero maelstrom of scandal.
High above the billows of controversy re
sides a posse of unparalleled grit, a crew
whose message has blatantly stripped layers
of Teflon kimono to reveal poo-poo shimmy
shamming. And what is the impetus of this
revolution of the real? Perhaps Mobb Deep
member Havic explains it best in a caveat to
fakers entitled "The Infamous Prelude," a so
liloquy of sorts that outlines a credo of the
strong fist and iron soul. After that, "The In
famous" follows a path of biting resilience,
pounding earholes with track titles like "Cra
dle to the Grave," "Survival of the Fittest" and
"Party Over." Weak stomached individuals
need not apply.
In an urban jungle grown wild with the
vines of poverty and destitution, Mobb
Deep's thorns of survivalism manifest them
selves in the musical componentry of the
rugged beat and macabre melody. Armed
with a motif of overcooked bass slaps and
abrasive loops, dirt-soiled ghetto tales are
told at volume 10, each one as depressing as
