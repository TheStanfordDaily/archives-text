# THE 						B.U.M.S.
## Lyfe and Tyme

Oakland just won't quit. From Too Short's
nasty rhymes to the Hieroglyphics' mesmer
izing beats, this Bay Area rap mecca has
pumped out some of the finest jams to date.
Now proudly on the cutting edge for Oak
land are newcomers the B.U.M.S, a group
that first revealed their mellow style on the
soundtrack for the movie "Street Fighter."
Their debut album, "Lyfe and Tyme," is a fine
example of what put Oakland on the hip-hop
map in the first place: an innovative spirit.
In the true Oakland style, the B.U.M.S
(short for Brothers Unda Madness) create a
brand of hip-hop that is distinct and uncon
fined by the norms of New York and Los An
geles rap. Better yet, they combine these dis
tinct brands and create an album full of re
laxing and well-developed tracks. "Non-
Stoppin' the Groove," for example, features a
saturating bass line laced with samples of
past rap giants, while "Wreck Your Ears (Can
Do)" runs on thick organ and juicy guitar
chords, all the time retaining a distinct flavor.
Perhaps the most innovative song on the
album is "West Coast Smack," which em
ploys an old and brassy be-bop recording as
the underpinning for modern verbal as
saults. Long-time rap fans will appreciate
samples of vintage Rakim, Jeru the Damaja
and well-used James Brown inserts.
Like any talented rhymers, the B.U.M.S
create a rich instrument of their own with
their rhythmic verbal musings. Although
quite metaphorical, the group's lyrical con
tent is less then cutting edge. With lines like,
"I pack lead like a number two pencil / I'm
known to get a piece of the rock like Pruden
tial," it seems as if several visits to the
metaphor graveyard were in order for the
production of this album.
But the B.U.M.S, despite any shortcom
ings, are a powerful addition to the begin
nings of a rich Bay Area rap tradition. If any
thing, these kids have inaugurated a fine tra
dition of their own. Nobody's perfect, not
even Oakland.
