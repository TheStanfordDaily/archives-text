# PREACHER BOY AND THE NATURAL BLUES
## Preacher Boy and the Natural Blues 
### 
This album is some funky ass shit. It's out
there. It's from another world. How 'bout
ethereal? I feel almost blasphemous using
such a long word to describe an album that
doesn't contain anything but one or two
three-syllable words.
Preacher Boy and the Natural Blues has
done right with its new self-titled album.
Creatures of the supernatural haunt the
songs with death as a main theme.
In one really sweet song, "The Drive Goes
On," we encounter the mind of a man warped
from too many hours of driving solo cross
country. He imagines walking ghosts, danc
ing gypsies, a wailing banshee, and a black
bird that shadows his solitary car as it carries
him further from home.
Later in the album two songs that follow
each other really take this album to another

realm. In "All and Everything You Need,"
Watkins tells the story of a boy who, raised
rich behind castle walls, wants to know the
real world. He escapes from his childhood
sanctuary to eat rice and sit beneath a tree.
You tell me — Buddha?
Then what's up with the subsequent song
about being weighed down by a cross of bur
dens as one passes through life? All that
Watkins wants for his suffering is a promise
of being saved. How 'bout Christianity?
Do you get it? This Preacher Boy character
sits with his guitar sifting out old blues tunes
passing through Dixieland and stopping to
pick up a washboard or kazoo to tell it like it
really is. He sings about death, but not in
some gruesome way. It's almost as though
he's saying: "Death. It's just another day
we've gotta live through, and here's a trom
bone slide to make it go by easier."
I'm sick of the little alternative brats whin
ing about the way life has dealt them a bad
hand of cards. Sure, life ain't no bed of roses,
but this preacher guy doesn't sulk about the
fact that he's gonna' die. Instead he makes it
into something entertaining.
He doesn't use big words or tough con
cepts and writes all of the songs himself. In

his gravel y voice that calls for a lozenge by
the end of the album, Preacher Boy scrapes
through 12 songs, only one of which does not
mention death and sickness. It's just about
fixing some coffee for someone you love, "i
put milk and brown sugar in the coffee i
make / cause i know that's how my baby likes
to start her day."
Plain and simple. That's all it is. No fancy
shmancy lyrics or musical tricks needed to
lift this album out of this world.
