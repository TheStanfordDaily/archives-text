# MIKE WATT
## Ball-Hog or Tugboat? 
### 
The fact that members of the bands Pearl
Jam, Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr.,
Beastie Boys, Screaming Trees, The Meat Pup
pets, Porno for Pyros, Soul Asy
lum, the Pixies and the Red Hot Chili Peppers
all played on Mike Watt's new album does not
make it a good album. What makes this a good
album is that it belongs to Mike Watt as the
thoughtful work of one individual.
Watt is a former member of early '80s punk
legends the Minutemen. His recent release
"Ball-Hog or Tugboat?" on Columbia Records
is his first solo project since the breakup of his
second band, fiREHOSE. It is a brilliant pro
ject in which he functions as producer, direc
tor, song-writer and bass player.
Although the all-star cast changes con
stantly from track to track, Watt's bass and
lyrics subtly cement each song into its own el
ement and unify the 18 tracks. His production
techniques taint the overall sound with just
enough grit and noise that the album retains
the energy and enthusiasm of well-produced
live shows.
Most important of all is Watt's song writ
ing. "Ball-Hog or Tugboat" takes us on a trip
back through the history of recent music. The
album starts off with solid, innovative rock 'n'
roll. Both "Piss Bottle Man" and "Chinese
Eiredrill" are crashing and spacious rock with
an intense large-hall reverb that accentuates
the live feel.
Watt then takes us back to early hard-core
and punk. "Sexual Military Dynamics" is a
coarse and edgy punk song with Henry Rollins
snarling his way through the vocals.
Going back even further on this trip, Watt
stops us with some wholesome funk. There
are about four or five songs in this vein; the
most notable is the George Clinton cover
"Maggot Brain." In this 12-minute instru
mental, Watt lays down a heavy bass line while
J. Mascis brings his guitar to a near howl.
Lyrically, Watt is colloquial yet introspec
tive. He is reminiscent of his roots, but warns
us against a return to the ideals that surround
ed his generation. In the song "Drove Up
Prom Pedro," Watt says of himself: "From time
to time he seems to find for inspiration he has
to dig / Back to them days when the Germs
played, him and Joe Baiza at that show / Drove
up from Pedro / From Pedro they drove."
That is what much of this album is about:
paying tribute without idealizing. Watt plays
the good stuff from his generation while ac
knowledging the bad and in the process makes
a sound all his own.
