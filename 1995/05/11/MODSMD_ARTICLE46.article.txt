## BROUN FELLINIS AphroKubist Improvisations #9 
### 
The Broun Fellinis, long at the forefront of
the San Francisco jazz / hip-hop movement,
are finally in widespread distribution with
their first Moonshine Music release,
"AphroKubist Improvisations #9."
The Fellinis' drum-bass-saxophone setup
allows them much room for exploration, and
on "Improvisations #9," they have captured
the live energy that propelled them into the
hearts of their huge S.F. following.
While the bass and saxophone set up a
jazz-funk groove web, the driving drum work
carries the album, even through otherwise
low moments. The saxophonist alternates
between melodies reminiscent of Coltrane,
and Digable Planets-type rhymes (but which
came first, the Planets or the Fellinis?).
The album shines especially on "Soulogik
Syntax," where streamlined production adds
effects that can't be found in the live jams,
and in the deep bass driven groove of "Q
Flat." Unlike "Syntax," "Q Flat" showcases
the Fellinis doing what they are best known
for: turning expectations upside down and
creating a nearly psychedelic groove space
that pulls the listener in, trance-like.
Another great cut is the aphrodisiac tribute,
"Zoomin'." The poetry, outlines a sensual por
trait of sex and meshes well with the sexy groove.
The album also features the memorable
"Pow" from their demo release, "Chocolate
Surrealism." Narrated by the Crack MC, it's a
strikingly vivid aural snapshot of urban
street life that addresses many of the same
themes as Gangsta' Rap, but with infinite lev
els more taste and poignancy.
"AphroKubist Improvisations #9" is a
must for jazz / hip-hop enthusiasts and fans
of the Fellinis' live shows. And if you're nei
ther, checking out one of their weekly gigs in
S.F. may make you a convert.
