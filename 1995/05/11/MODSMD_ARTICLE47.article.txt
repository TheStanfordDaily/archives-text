## Yuen Ping Low 19TH ANNUAL GAY AND LESBIAN FILM FESTIVAL HAS COMPLEX VARIETY OF NEW, DARING PIECES 
### 
Hot on the heels of the just-completed
San Francisco International Film Festival is
another Bay Area celluloid event worth every
second of the tedious 50-minute commute to
the city. The San Francisco International Les
bian and Gay Film Festival will be held June 9
to 18 at the Castro and Victoria theaters and
Southern Exposure Gallery.
Entering its 19th year, the festival's non
profit parent organization Frameline pre
sents 229 features and shorts from 16 coun
tries, including 65 titles which will receive
their world premieres. One of these, Todd
Verow's San Francisco-shot "Frisk" — the
long-awaited adaptation of the Dennis
Cooper novella of sex and murder — has
been designated as the closing-night film.
Immediately prior to the screening of
"Frisk," Marcus Hu, its producer, will re
ceive the prestigious 1995 Frameline Award
for achievement in lesbian and gay media
arts. A leading figure who spearheaded the
New Queer Cinema movement — he pro
duced the landmark Gregg Araki feature
"The Living End" — Hu also distributes
masterpieces made outside this country like
Alison Maclean's "Crush" and Andre T£ch
ine's "Wild Reeds."
Noteworthy in this year's line-up is the
ever-expanding body of lesbian work, per
haps inspired by the national success of last
year's curtain-raiser "Go Fish." An unprece
dented 14 features focus squarely on
women's interests, including the Sundance
hit romantic comedy that opens the festival,
"The Incredibly True Adventure of Two
Girls in Love" by Maria Maggenti.

No longer solely fixated on coming-out
angst, lesbian cinema has graduated to
more complex realms of relationship issues,
cross-cultural crises, and even the undefin
able and unexpected — Maria Luisa Bem
berg's convent drama "I, The Worst of All."
The British-made "Thin Ice" by Fiona Cun
ningham Reid studies the passions of
women figure skaters at the Gay Games,
while "Skin Deep" by Canadian Midi On
odera sets its intriguing premise within the
subculture of tattooing.
Special programs this year include "Cy
berstroika," a queer digital extravaganza
which takes Frameline into the multimedia
arena. There are also curated programs of
lesser-known work by British filmmakers
Terence Davies and the late Derek Jarman.
The festival is dedicated to the memory of
Mark Finch, its visionary artistic director
before his suicide in January 1995.
