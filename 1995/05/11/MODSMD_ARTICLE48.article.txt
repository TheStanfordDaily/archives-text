# TARANTINO SHOULD STICK TO HIS DESTINY—WRITING AND DIRECTING
## GENIUS BEHIND 'PULP FICTION' FAKES POORLY AS AN ACTOR 
### 
Quentin Tarantino. The name was
enough to inspire sheer happiness through
out my entire being when I saw it flashed
during a preview. My heart raced, my palms

Destiny Turns
on the Radio

sweated madly, I couldn't wait to call my ed
itor to get dibs on the review.
What I overlooked was that "Destiny
Turns on the Radio," is not really a Tarantino
movie. Sure, he acted in it, but he didn't write
or direct it. And, as 1 recalled way too late, he
was probably the weakest actor in "Pulp Fic
tion."
In retrospect, I was teased. 1 was taunted
by a name, and I took the bait. 1 should have
known, I should have seen it coming like the
mosquitoes that now infest the beautifully
filled lake. But 1 was blind, 1 chose to over
look the blatant truth.
Tarantino may be one of the best
writer / directors around, but his taste for
kitsch should never, ever, ever be ignored.
After all, Tarantino's muse, John Travolta,
did once walk that very thin line between
utter-polyester-tackiness and just-too
disco-to-be-believed.
I am positive Tarantino will giggle madly
when he watches "Destiny Turns on the
Radio" on cable in less than three months
from now. He'll probably have a party with
lots of fake blood. He will enjoy imagining
his happily twisted self infesting homes
throughout the heartland. And I share in his
mirth.
However, that does not excuse the almost
two hours of suffering that I endured sitting
in a movie theater waiting for "Destiny Turns

on the Radio," to end.
The most exciting part of the movie was
when I thought I had lost my wallet, but ac
tually, it had really fallen in the side of my
seat.
"The plot, the plot, what about the plot?"
you demand, madly screaming like a cop
with his ear cut off. Fine. Be the typical goal
oriented American. 1 say the movie was
awful, but if you are still reading, you must
actually want to know what it's all about —
hopelessly grasping for the "bigger picture."
Conformist pig.
"Destiny Turns On the Radio" involves no
character development, no thrill, no beauty,
no unforced dialogue. Did it have rhythm,
though? What about style? Unfortunately,
neither. It had Quentin Tarantino as some
type of deity named Johnny Destiny who
emerged from a big yellow swimming pool
somewhere in Las Vegas and decided to mess
with the lives of a couple so hopelessly trite I
found myself wishing they would just get the
running-off-into-the-sunset-part over with
so that 1 wouldn't have to watch them any
more.
Had enough? Or shall I slowly pour the
gasoline?
