# 'VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED' SCRAPES THE BOTTOM OF THE HORROR MOVIE BARREL
## 
### 
Kirstie Alley (NBC's "Cheers") must be
piss poor to have agreed to do this film. On
the other hand, for "Superman's" Christo
pher Reeve — who usually works about twice
every 10 years — being cast alone was proba
bly a blessing.
Unfortunately, these two has-beens are
paired up in the year's dumbest film. This re
make of the 1960 flick follows the same

Village of
the Damned

premise — possessed children take over a
small town in Midwich, Calif. — with a Hol
lywood 1995 twist. These '90s kids are really
aliens preparing to take over mankind.
It all begins when, in the middle of a coun
ty fair, everyone in town passes out. They
awaken to find that all of the women have
been mysteriously impregnated. The die
hard-virgin Melanie is so distraught by her
unplanned pregnancy that she kills herself.
The alien children all grow up to have
white hair and telepathic powers, but they are
complete idiots. They use their telepathy to

force everyone to kill themselves rather than
to force them to aid in their plot to take over
mankind — for example, they make Kirstie
Alley perform an autopsy on herself.
One must allow for some stupidity in hor
ror movies, but this film goes too far. Know
ing full well that the children can control
people, an angry mob tries to attack them
with torches. One townswoman is rather sur
prised when she finds herself on fire.
Halfway through the film I thought that
maybe John Carpenter was trying to be clever
and campy. But it soon becomes clear that he
wasn't as the film tries to grasp onto some
type of social significance. When Christo
pher Reeves' daughter — the head of the
alien children — explains to him why they
are destroying Midwich, she preaches: "Life
is cruelty. We feed on each other. We exploit
each other."
As the well-respected-pillar-of-the-town
doctor who's constantly grieving the lost of
his wife, Christopher Reeve is just Clark Kent
with a gut. And as for Kirstie Alley's perfor
mance as the slightly sinister epidemiolo
gist. ... Well, her hair looked good.
Linda Kozlowski (Crocodile Dundee)

played the mother of the only good alien
child, who learned to have feelings. She
spends the whole movie screaming, "No, not
David! He's not one of them!"

They must have spent all of $4 and one
hour and 26 minutes making this movie, so
you need not waste $7 and two hours to see it.
