### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
Three of the "Stanford Five" pleaded not guilty to
felony charges of burglary yesterday afternoon at the
Palo Alto Courthouse.
The four Stanford students — seniors Matthew
Bengard and Jacob Kuramoto and sophomores Tim
othy Kutzkey and Anthony Quezada — along with
alumnus Jose Farias, were charged with burglary for
their alleged break-in to the Stanford Museum on
March 25.
The district attorney had issued a warrant for
Farias' arrest because he failed to appear at a prior
court hearing. Yesterday, however, lawyer Alfredo
Morales appeared in court in Farias' place.
All of the Stanford students are members of the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity and Farias is an alumnus of
the fraternity.
Bengard, Kutzkey and Quezada pleaded not guilty

to the felony charges. Kuramoto was not present at
yesterday's court session but his lawyer, Edward
Mahler, told Judge Gilbert Brown that he anticipates
Kuramoto's plea will also be not guilty.
"I am not of the belief that this is a burglary, so it's
a little tough to plead [Kuramoto's alleged crime] as a
burglary," said Mahler. In regard to lesser charges,
Mahler said, "It would be kind of hard to argue that
there wasn't a trespass, but those two are worlds
apart.
"The police are of the mind that if they invested
this much time into the case it can't be just a misde
meanor," he said.
Mahler contended that all of the suspects were ab
solutely not planning to burglarize the Stanford Mu
seum.
"Mr. Bengard pled not guilty because he is not
guilty of secondary burglary — that is of entering any
building with the intention of committing a bur-
glary," said Deputy Public
Defender Mark Becker, who rep
resents Bengard. Becker added
that he thinks his client will not
change his plea.
"I think the police are over
focused on what the kids had and
under-focused on what they
didn't have," Mahler said, refer
ring to the tools which Kuramoto
was carrying. "I think the [police]
are blowing this out of proportion
and unfortunately we are in this
situation."
At the time of his arrest,
Kuramoto was carrying numer
ous tools, according to the police
report, including various screw
drivers, an ax, a hacksaw, an
Allen wrench set and a flashlight.

Brown agreed to set Farias'
outstanding warrant aside if
Farias appears in court at the
preliminary hearing. At that
time, he will be arraigned and is
expected to enter a plea. Morales
declined to comment on his
client's plea.
Farias, who graduated with a
bachelor's degree in drama in
1994, currently lives in Minneso
ta.
Deputy District Attorney
Lance Bayer, the prosecutor in
the case, said he anticipates
Farias will also plead not guilty at
the preliminary hearing.
The preliminary hearing has
been set for June 2. At that hear
ing, Bayer said, one of the wit
nesses will be Stanford Museum
Director Thomas Seligman, in
addition to two Stanford Police
deputies and a Palo Alto police
officer.
