## THANK THE PEEBLES POSSE FOR INSPIRING 'PANTHER’ 
### 
When fat her-son team
Melvin and Mario Van Peebles
("Posse") got together to create
this beautiful adaptation of
Melvin Van Peebles' novel "Pan
ther," Mario stepped in to direct
the story that chronicles the rise
and fall of the Black Panther
Party in 1967.
The story is told from the
point of view of Judge, Kadeem
Hardison ("A Different
World"), a young man who
joins the Panthers. The film

Panther

opens with a brilliant scene in
which we watch a cute little boy
ride through his neighborhood
in Oakland, only to be mur
dered by a driver who

four way

intersection.

We learn that the

community has been lob

hying city government to

install a stop light at the inter

section, but to no avail. To top
this off, the police brutally at

tacks participants of the subse
quent non-violent candlelight
vigil. After this incident the for
merly fledgling group gains mo
mentum and people power.
Their first activity is to act as
crossing guards on the infa
mous corner.
The Panthers learn the laws
to the letter and use this knowl
edge to protect themselves
against "the pigs" (the police
and other oppressive white
folks). Hardison explains: "I
guess you could say for me, the
Panthers started on my front
lawn." Hardison works hard to
loose all Dwayne Wayne-isms,
and only had a hint of goofy
bony-Roger Thomas-1985-
black-geek in him.
Although the director of
photography, costumers and set
dressers do an excellent job of
recreating the late 19605, most
of the cast, especially Chris Rock
("Saturday Night Live") and
Bobby Brown, fail to create
characters who appear to exist

in 1967. Most of them move and
speak the way black folks do on
Black Entertainment Television
today.
An exception is newcomer
Marcus ('hong who playsHuey
Newton, the charismatic leader
of the Black Panther Party. Mar
cus may soon be giving Denzel
Washington some competition.
As Alma, the most promi
nent of the female Panthers, Ne
fertiti is fierce. She has all the
sass, attitude, and sensuality of a

blaxploitation heroine
but the integrity of An
gela Davis — whom
she could probably take
out if she had to.

The movie is rather inspir
ing. While the previews make it
look like it's just a lot of shoot
ing, it's really quite poignant.
Nevertheless, a re-

iner lamented the fact that "
the movie turns the Panthers
into "mythical heroes." But
that is what is so wonderful
about the film — we get to look
at it from the Panther's point of
view and evaluate it ourselves.
The same reviewer also said the
film "ignores the Panther's dark
er side." Perhaps he would have
been satisfied it the Panthers
were shown dealing crack and
raping white women.
It is exciting to see a movie
that looks at a group historically
vilified by the media and ex
plores the circumstances that
motivated their actions. People
always criticize militant black
folks without questioning,
"Why do they feel this way
about X or Y" or "Why do I feel
this way about them?"
As another Money-Hungry-
Niggers-With-Guns movie,
"Dead Presidents," rears its ugly
head, we must thank the Peebles
for "Panther."
