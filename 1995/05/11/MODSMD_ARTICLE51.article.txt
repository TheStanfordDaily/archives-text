# LONG ON TITLE AND SHORT ON PLOT
## 
### 
Amid rolling green hills, a lone figure stands upon a
promontory and starts spinning like a top. No, this isn't
Julie Andrews in"The Sound of Music," and Hugh Grant
doesn't sing in this film. But "The Englishman Who
Went up a Hill Hut Came Down a Mountain" could have
worked very well as a musical. Every time the quaint

The Englishman Who
Went Up the Hill But
Came Down a Mountain

townspeople get together you half expect them to burst
into song.
Despite its long title "Englishman" is fairly short on
plot and character, making for a simple, fairy-tale-like
story told by an elderly man to his grandson. It's inter
esting to note that the story is a legend in the family of
Welsh writer / director Christopher Monger. The tiny
village of Ffynnon Garw takes on archetypal propor
tions: The streets are bathed in glowing rustic colors, the
townspeople toss us an occasional sop of local dialect
and the villains — if such a mild-tempered film could be
said to have any — are the meddlesome English.
Ffynnon Garw is the kind of town where practically
everyone has the last name (Williams or Jones), and
where the greatest entertainment comes from betting
whether or not the local landmark Ffynnon Garw is a

mountain. When the English interlopers say that it's not,
Welsh nationalism kicks in — after all, it is 1917 — and
the townspeople set about making their hill 16 feet high
er.
1 lugh Grant does yet another variation on his slightly
foppish yet boyishly charming British twit as Anson, the
English mapmaker of the movie's title. In a rather limited
role, Tara Fitzgerald (Grant's costar in "Sirens") plays the
sharp-witted seductress Betty, who is imported from
Cardiff for the sole purpose of distracting Anson while the
mountain is being built. Fitzgerald's coquettish French
and-Welsh accented English grates a bit on the ears, but
her attempts to seduce the starchy Anson are comical.
Their love story, while slow to get going, does make
for picturesque views of their interlocked silhouettes
atop Ffynnon Garw. The most engaging performance in
the film, however, comes from Colm Meaney as the blus
tery pub-owner Morgan who may or may not be the rea
son behind the sudden crop of ginger-haired babies in
Ffynnon Garw.
The strongest element in "Englishman" is not Hugh
Grant (as the advertisements suggest), but the towns
people of Ffynnon Garw themselves. They cheerfully
sacrifice family, religion and literally the earth under
their feet for their national pride.
With sweeping music and grand sentimentality,
"Englishman" truly makes a mountain out of molehill.
