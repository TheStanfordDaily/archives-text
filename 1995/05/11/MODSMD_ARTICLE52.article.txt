# ’PYROMANIAC’S’ FIRE NEVER GETS LIT
## 
### 
This love story is your basic boy meets girl, boy loves
girl, girl doesn't know so boy takes blame for burning
down his place of work, arsonist meets girl, arsonist
loves girl, arsonist's ex-girlfriend kisses boy, girl gets
mad, arsonist and ex-girlfriend get back together, boy
and girl realize their love and everyone lives happily ever
after tale.
Sound confusing? This movie certainly is. Not very

A Pyromaniac's
Love Story

much of the
story — or the
acting — makes
sense, with the
exception of its

hero, the wonderful John Leguizamo.
Under the misguided hand of director Joshua Brand,
"A Pyromaniac's Love Story" tries very hard to be quirky
and unusual but mostly just succeeds in boggling the
mind. However, it is not without humor and charm,
most of which is supplied by Leguizamo as Sergio, a poor
boy working in a pastry shop.

Trying to make
enough money to "see
the world" with Hattie,
the object of his undy
ing love, his plans go
awry when the pastry
shop is burned to the
ground. He is paid to
take the blame for the
arsonist who lit the fire
as a "poem of love."
Hmmm.
Looking beyond the
storyline, Sadie Frost
does a decent job in her
role as Hattie, Armin
Mueller-Stahl is sweet
and endearing as the
owner of the doomed
pastry shop and Joan
Plowright is, as always,
flawless as the wife. In
fact, it is this couple that
is the least annoying
and most believable of

the bunch.
It is the introduction of William Baldwin as Garrett
the pyromaniac that really plunges the film into the full
depths of the ridiculous. All of Garrett's tortured moan
ing and whining that he is one of the "unlovable" fail to
create any sympathy or feeling for the cackling character.
Erika Eleniak as Garrett's rich snob of a girlfriend is
simply awful. She delivers her lines with all the emotion
of a math test and is so unpleasant that one begins to
wonder why Garrett lit the pastry shop on fire instead of
her. Clearly these two people deserve each other but the
convoluted plot takes so long to get to the point that no
one really cares by the time it all comes together.
Despite all these problems, "A Fyromaniac's Love
Story" is not all bad. It has its moments of humor and
several gleams of wit that redeem somewhat the mass
confusion and silliness. It's just too bad that by the time
the tlames die down, everybody lives happily ever after
except the audience.
