# Unmasking the McCarthy era: ‘Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been?

4 re You Now or Have You Ever Been?"
Jl The question begs to be answered, and
JULit is — in director Tonka Cadoree's
rendition of the play which deals with the
McCarthy hearings, one of the most trau
matic periods of American history.
Eric Bentley dramatized actual testimony
from hearings against Hollywood artists by
the House Un-American ActivitiesCornmit
tee. The piece, with nine different actors per
forming a variety of roles, uses masks to hide
the actors' fact sand —and to bring out the real
meaning behind the testimony and the play.

"At first it was just another play," said
Scott C. Roos, an actor in the play. "Then it
became a re-enactment of horrible injustice
which our government enacted."
People who were subpoenaed by the com
raittec were often forced to answer whether
or not they had ever been members of the
Communist Party.
While informers were often lauded as
good Americans, people who refused to tes
tify against their friends and colleagues were
blacklisted. The effects on their lives were
devastating: Some committed suicide or
died of heart failure; others were never able
to work again.
"1 was constantly surprised at what little
sense of history Americans have," said Jami
Taylor, an actress in the play who is also a
lawyer teaching criminal law at Stanford
under a Spaeth Fellowship. "There are peo
ple who dropped off the face of the Earth just

because of the stance they took."

The masks are a challenge for the actors
and the audience. They do not allow use of
the usual means of physical expression. Such
devices like facial expressions, eye contact or
face-to-fact confrontations cannot be used
to convey either the meaning of a sentence or
the character of a person.
"As an actress it has been a completely
challenging play, physically, vocally, emo
tionally,? said Laura Bialis. "We've spent a lot
of time doing character work with the
masks."
Because of the masks, the actors convey
character and feeling thrc>ugh voice and ges
tures. Each of the actors at different times
uses accents to communicate a certain
meaning tothe audience. For example, when
one of the committee s chairmen is sup
posed to be played as racist, Judith Williams
puts on a convincing southern drawl. The
gestures, too, are larger than life in some
cases — especially in the case of witnesses
such as Larry Parks, played by Monica Chi.
It is a tribute to the play's excellence that
despite the limitations of the masks, the
complex subtleties and meanings are ex
pressed so weft.

The masks well symbolize what is horrif
ic. In order to save themselves and their fam
ilies, people were often forced to hide their
true selves and admit to things they never
did or vice versa. The complexity of the situ-

ation is mirrored
by the complicat
ed structure of the
show — which is
a play of the fic
tional filming of
the trials.
"The same
person who in
one scene is bru
tally badgering a
witness, two min
utes later is a wit
ness herself," said
a senior.
l< We are all impli
cated in every
heroic act, in
every act of be
trayal.
Cadoree also
stresses the im
portance of tin
media in affecting
the American
psyche at that
time, and uses re
porters effectively
in the play. "In the
*~os, I lie actual
proceedings were
televised — there
were cameras, re
porters, sound ef
fects: people

cheering, booing and hissing — it was like a
show — the O.J. trial of its day," Cadoree
said. "There were very comic aspects of what
was ultimately a national tragedy."
Singer Paul Robeson, played by Cadoree,
echoes to the committee members what
their history shows, "You are the unpatriots,
you arc the un-Americans."
"Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been?"
reminds us that the persecution of creative

artists — and the censorship of expression
— is closer than we might think.
