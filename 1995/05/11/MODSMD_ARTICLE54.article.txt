# Spike and Mike's â€™toon-fest at your doorstep
## 
### Taylor Antrim 
Remember the joys of that perfect Satur
day a.m. cartoon world, where charac
ters were impervious to mile-high falls,
shotgun blasts and nuclear fallout? And how
the years passed and you began sleeping in,
missed the shows and fell out of touch with
hyperactive, technicolor entertainment?
For everyone who misses those days, or for
anyone that still living them, this weekend's

Spike and Mike's Original Festival of
Animation should be a treat. Spon
sored by ASSU Sunday Flicks, the
festival features 90 minutes of
award-winning animation from Fu
rope, Canada and the U.S. Anima
tion styles range from traditional
pencil or ink to such methods as
computer-generated animation,
stop-action and clay-mation.
The festival was born back in
1975 when Craig "Spike" Dekker
and Mike Gribble founded Mellow
Manor Productions. Since then,
MMP's sole ambition has been to
collect, assemble and promote an
annual animation festival. Since

then the company has had enor
mous success, boasting not only the yearly
festival but also its ugly twin, "The Sick and
Twisted Festival of Animation" featuring
more scatological humor and projectile
vomit than any one person needs. The festi
val underwent a setback in August 1994 when

Mike Gribble
passed away.
After reschedul
ing, however,
Spike and Mike's
10-year old pro
ject has come
back in force,
touring more

than 35 major cities in the
U.S. and Canada. In the
past big names in anima
tion culture like Ren and
Stimpy, the Simpsons and
Beavis and Butt-head
have all had their start in
the program.
"Theresa hie vari-

ety. There's a lot of humor involved, but a
couple are more aesthetic and artistically ori
ented," said John Hall, manager of ASSU Sun
day Flicks. "Hopefully, if all goes well, we can
get it back and make it a yearly tradition."
For years Spike and Mike's animation fes
tival had been showing at Palo Alto's Varsity
theater. But when the historic venue closed,
Hall seized the opportunity to bring the festi
val to Stanford.
"I knew that the festival had been running
out of La Jolla for several years," Hall said. "It
used to show out of the Varsity theater in Palo
Alto, but then it closed, and there was really
no venue on the peninsula between San Fran
cisco and San Jose where they could show
this. Stanford was lucky enough to get it."
If you're interested in the future of anima
tion, from the mock newspaper drama of
"The Big Story" to the thwarted romance of
"Sleepy Guy" to the trippy new-wave anima
tion of "How to Make a Decision," or if you
just want to relive a little of the drooling, Sat
urday morning ecstasy of pre-adolescence, be
sure to check this show out.
