# An Olympic 'Hecuba’
## 
### Linda Friedlieb 
he American Conservatory The
ater's presentation of "Hecuba" is a
delightful combination of old and

new, reinterpreting an ancient Greek
tragedy through a new translation.
In ancient Greece, when tragedies like

"Hecuba" were per
formed, the locale

was an outdoor
amphitheater, the

actors wore large
dramatic masks
to amplify their

voices and, to be
blatant, they were

performed in Greek.
In 1995 San Francis

co, Academy Award-win
ner Olympia Dukakis
tackles the title role, em
bodying dignity and

tragedy as she ut
ters the lines of

Timberlake Wertenbaker's
adaptation and translation
of Euripides' text.

For Dukakis, "Hecuba"
marks the latest in a long chain of classical
roles from works like "Electra" and "Medea"

— providing a distinct change from
. her more "popular" cinema-

graphic work in the "Look
Who's Talking" trilogy and
I "Moonstruck." Her distinc-

tive look and regal air make
her perfectly at home in the
dignified tragedies.
Instead of an amphithe
ater, ACT brings the tragedy '
to life indoors, at the Center

for the Arts Theater in Yerba
Buena Gardens — a beauti
ful spacious locale in which

the stage is inten
. tionally trans-

formed

into an outdoors venue by set designer Kate
Edmunds.
Metamorphosed into the shores of
Thrace, the stage is covered with sand and
becomes cliffs and a cave. Thrace is the home
of the exiled women of Troy, enslaved by the
Greeks after the destruction of their home
during the Trojan War.
4 #ecuba, wife of slain King Priam,
dreads her new life as a slave with
J only two of her children left to her.
Her daughter Cassandra, while alive, has be
come Agamemnon's concubine. Another
daughter, Polyxena, remains with her in the
camp, while her youngest son Polydorus has
been sent to safety with king Polymester of
Thrace.
As the tragedy begins, Hecuba (pro
nounced "Hek-uh-bay") has a vision of her
youngest son who tells of his own death. This
prophecy is spookily enacted with winds and
a young child's disembodied voice, his shad
ow floating in the sky.
Following the prophecy, Hecuba faces the
loss of Polyxena (Shirley Roecca) when
Achilles' ghost demands a sacrifice and the
Greeks decide that Hecuba's only remaining
daughter is the perfect choice. The decision
presents a dichotomy of characters— Hecu
ba, who is willing to beg and supplicate her
self to save her daughter, and Polyxena, who
seeks death as a way to escape the humilia
tion and degradation of slavery.
Roecca presents a facade of dignity and
anger, a princess wronged by history who
chooses to escape it. (Incidentally,

legend has it that Polyxena may

have been Achilles' lover.) As
Hecuba, Dukakis uses every
gesture, every motion and
every facial expression to
convey her grief and rage.
And the emotion flows in a
crescendo. Following her
daughter's death, Hecuba's
servant brings her the body
of the son she thought was
safely hidden. That's the final
straw as Hecuba shifts
from the pursuit of mercy to
the hunt for vengeance and
justice.

4 Ultimately, Hecuba is a familiar tragic
/ M tale that forces us to reexamine our
notions of fairness and justice and
contrast them with notions of political ex
pediency. Performed without intermission,
Hecuba demands constant re-examination
of soul and conscience, asking universal
questions while set in a specific political
context.
Hecuba also illustrates women's ability to
take action. When Agamemnon (James
Carpenter) speaks with Hecuba, he asserts
"1 question the power of women."
Although Hecuba initially turns to men
for assistance, asking first Odysseus and
then Agamemnon to provide her with jus
tice, she eventually takes action on her own.
With the assistance of other women, she dis
proves the traditional passivity of the "fairer
sex."
Directed by ACT artistic director Carey
Perloff with movement arranged by Mar
garet Jenkins and Ellie Klopp, Hecuba re
mains a study in detail. Every gesture has
meaning; every motion reflects emotion.
The story is framed by a score — newly
commissioned by David Lang — which
moves the story along and highlights the
emotions of the tragedy. The beautiful voic
es of KITKA, an Oakland Eastern European
women's a cappella chorus, bring the score
to life in the role of the chorus.
Although the entire cast brings talent
and ability to their roles, the women of
KITKA add a special aura which makes
"Hecuba" more than just a play. Next to
them, only Olympia Dukakis can hold her
head above the pack — bringing to life
possibly the oldest feminist drama in
history.
