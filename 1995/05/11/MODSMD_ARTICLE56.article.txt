Amateur
At first glance, the signs that sur
round writer-director Hal Hartley s
fourth full-length feature appear omi
nous.
Nevertheless, unifying threads of
character, form and style continue
to impose their reassuring pres
ence upon the singularly Hal Hart
ley vision â€” one of parental op
pression, creative strangulation,
capitalist exploitation, and existen
tial angst that confound the Great
American Way.
While the violent sphere is domes
tic in "Trust," "Amateur" has brutali
ty oozing from every pore of down
town Manhattan's human tapestry.
Aesthetically, the somber dark blues
and grays lend a noirish twist to the
primaries and pastels of Hartley's

first two features.
Despite its anaesthetic and mod
ernist facade, "Amateur" is really
crafted upon the mechanics of the
human heart.
The Cure
Somebody though, "Let's make a
really powerful, yet digestible, movie
about children dealing with AIDS."
So director Peter Horton ("thir
tysomething") brings us "The Cure."
This film tells the story of Eric, a
fatherless 11 -year-old boy who is
HIV-positive played by Brad Renfro
("The Client").
The film's depiction of living with
HIV is insulting. In one scene, Dex
ter slits his wrist and threatens a
would-be attacker by saying "My
blood is poison. One drop could

kill you."
Ultimately, the virus defines every
character. There's Dexter, who has
AIDS. There's Linda, whose son has
AIDS. And there's Eric, whose friend
has AIDS. At the end, Linda tells Eric
he found the cure by being Dexter's
friend. Talk about cutesy.
Do not, under any circum
stances, part with anything of
value, including your time, to see
this picture.
French Kiss
When Harry first met Sally, Meg
Ryan took her place in the hearts of
America as the perkiest star to hit
the screen in years. Since then,
Ryan has made a career out of play
ing Sally in various guises.

"French Kiss," originally titled
"Paris Match," does not disappoint
in this regard. The movie is a roman
tic comedy straight off the rack, yet
it manages to keep the audience in
terested and definitely delivers that
familiar warm fuzzy feeling by the
time the credits roll.
While the romantic plot may be
somewhat predictable, the subplot
involving a thief named Luc and his
contraband adds an unexpected
twist or two to the storyline. Despite
the Ryan smile, it is Kline's spectacu
lar performance as Luc that really
makes the film.
Never mind the predictability, or
the sometimes silly punchlines. The
Ryan charm paired with Kasdan and
Kline make this flick pretty damn fun
to watch.
