## The 						incredible, inescapable temptations of new virtual flesh 
### 
Kristie Lii Stout

My ex gave up leather for high tech. He
drooled for things hard, fixed and
gleamingly stainless-steel bright. With his
copy of Hajime Sorayama's "Sexy Robot" in
his sweaty grasp, he'd fantasize about hump
ing platinum cyberbabes with a salty zeal un
surpassed by even a hyper-ventilating Sam
Kinison on speed.
In simpler terms: sashaying tin can = virtu
al babe
For him, salivating over his book of techni
color gynoid-chick centerfolds was better
than snogging with the real thing. It provided
the rubba-fest... while sparing the KY. Each
celluloid metallic replica had the sexual allure
without the emotional baggage, the exotic
smile without the occasional neurotic frown
and the perky nipples without the wrinkled
areolas.

Hot box.
Pop cultchah guru Marshall McLuhan
once sputtered forth that every media exten
sion of man is a biological amputation, that
those with access to a curvaceous Cuisinart
in stilletto heels don't need a bona fide flesh
draped woman, that those who have the Dis
covery Channel or dwell in AOL chat rooms
don't need to go hiking in Big Sur.
There's something wrong here, and it
ain't my grammar.
There's something wrong when testos
terone-pumped manly-men lust after gy
noid chicks that resemble Richie Rich's ro
botron-with-a-duster, lrona. There's some
thing wrong when we watch the nature
channel instead of reminding ourselves of
the Play-doh Fun Factory sensation that
happens when mud oozes between our toes.

There's something wrong when technologies
created to "better" reality replace reality.
JCPenny-clad tourists marvel at a man
made volcanic eruption as it takes place for
the umpteenth time (every hour, on the
hour!) outside the Mirage resort in Las
Vegas:
"Amazing! Just like the real thing! How
did they do that?!?"
Grand Canyon-hound visitors screech
their Oscar de la Rental Cars to a stop out
side the park to enjoy the splendor of the
great earth's luscious cleavage via the Grand
Canyon IMAX theater presentation:
"Amazing! Just like being there! How did
they do that?"
Perked 19-year-olds ogle the screen as
Demi Moore reveals the majesty of her tech
nologically-enhanced udders:

"I can't believe it's not butter!"
Nature has been uprooted and replaced
with day-glo astroturf. Natural disasters
have become amusement-park spectacles.
Natural monuments have been converted
into movie-set backdrops. Perky ta-tas have
morphed into silicone-puffed orbs.
High-tech artifice has turned nature into
low kitsch and, like the credulous peon
shackled in Plato's cave, we accept these shal
low revamps of reality. Mr. Furley goes koo
koo for a fiberglass hump that erupts can
died lava. My ex goes ga-ga for an ovaried
C3PO. These techno-philiacs seek to leave
nature, so they replace it with electropop
trash.
I, on the other hand, seek to make love to
nature, so I left my ex.
