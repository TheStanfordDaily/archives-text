# Ex-SITN employee arrested for theft
## 
### Kristie Lilje Contributing writer 
Eldy Nodal, the former com
puter consultant for the Stanford
Instructional Television Network
(SITN) who faces charges of em
bezzling $20,232 from the Univer
sity, surrendered to Stanford Po
lice yesterday morning after
learning of the warrant out for her
arrest.
Nodal is charged with both
grand theft and insufficient
funds. The police report alleges
that between Feb. 9 and Nov. 18,
1994, Nodal forged 11 payment in
voices and bounced a $6,416 re
payment check to the University.

After she was contacted late
Monday evening, Nodal decided to
surrender to the police depart
ment at the earliest possible time,
according to Stanford Police De
tective Mark Swineford.
Nodal was booked early Tues
day morning and, in lieu of the
$50,000 bail, was sent to the Elm
wood Women's Detention Facility
in Milpitas, Swineford said. She
later made bail and was released
from the detention facility yester
day afternoon, jail authorities
said.
According to the police report,
some of the payment invoices in
cluded the forged initials of
Nodal's supervisor, Imelda
Oropeza, while others simply
bore the words "OK to pay."
In addition, Nodal allegedly
sent an e-mail message to
Accounts Payable — the division
of the Controller's Office respon
sible for making payments on
behalf of Stanford — requesting
payment to herself.
Nile Jones, manager of
Accounts Payable, declined to
comment.

Steve Jung, an audit manager
for Stanford's Internal Audit
Department, supplied the police
with most of the invoice informa
tion which led to Nodal's arrest,
the report said. He was unavail
able for comment yesterday after
noon.
Nodal was hired by the Univer
sity in November 1993 to do con
sulting work for SITN and left
Stanford last July due to her son's
severe illness, the report said.
Based on her financial records,
Swineford said, Nodal has
already spent all of the funds she
allegedly embezzled from Stan
ford.
