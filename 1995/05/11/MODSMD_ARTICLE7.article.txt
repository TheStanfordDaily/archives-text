## Bing fellows named 
### Alda Leu Contributing writer 
Four Stanford instructors
received Bing Fellowships for
excellence in undergraduate
teaching last month.
Political Science Prof.
Susan Okin, Assoc. Prof, of
Civil Engineering Jeffrey Kos
eflf and the Chemistry team of
Assoc. Prof. Christopher Chid
sey and Asst. Prof. Daniel
Stack received Bing awards for
a three-year term beginning in
July. The awards have been
given annually since 1991.
Erich fellow, with Stack and
Chidsey jointly sharing an
award, will be allotted $10,000
a year to use toward improve
ments in education. One-third
of the money can be used for
any purpose at the discretion
of the recipient and two-thirds
of the stipend is designated for
curriculum and teaching im
provement.
Okin, also director of the
Ethics in Society Program, has
been at Stanford for five years,
during which she has made
many contributions to the
University. She teaches a pop
ular class about feminist theo-
ry which usually draws an enroll
ment of around 150 students.
In addition to this large class,
Okin also teaches smaller classes
which allow her to interact with
her students.
"When I teach seminars I have
the students make presenta
tions," she said. "I meet with
each student before their presen
tation to get a chance to meet all
of them. I also talk to them indi
vidually about their papers. I def
initely talk to all of my students
in smaller sections."
Okin mentioned hiring an
assistant to help her restructure
classes as one means of utilizing
the funds. "I was planning to do
some more major revisions of the
feminist theory course and I was
thinking of a course about
women in a more global setting —
about women's role in developing
countries," she said.
Similarly, Koseff also takes a
personal approach in his devotion
to his students. "I care about the
students as much as what I'm
teaching them. I try to establish
personal relationships with my

classes," said Koseff. "In a class
of about 30 to 40 students, I give
myself one to two weeks to learn
everybody's name."
As the director of the Environ
ment Fluid Mechanics Laborato
ry, Koseff said he tries to illus
trate his points in lectures with
imagery and wants to bring more
of this type of teaching into the
classroom.
Part of the funding from the
fellowship may go toward chang
ing the "traditional textbook
based style" of teaching, Koseff
said. "We (the department) want
to use a more dynamic multime
dia-based approach," he added.
Koseff discussed plans to work
with Scandinavian universities to
develop materials for students to
access data online. Chidsey and
Stack also hope to use funds to
put class work online.
"What we plan to do is
twofold right now," Stack said.
"First we want to try to get
classes on the (World Wide) Web
sooner. We want to be on the
front of the curve and put prob
lem sets, solution sets and
announcements online. Second
ly, we want to build up and
develop the infrastructure for
doing live demonstrations for
chemistry classes."
