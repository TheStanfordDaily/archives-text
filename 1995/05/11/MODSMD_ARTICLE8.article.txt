Discussing the future of Asia and the Pacif
ic Rim, several distinguished members of the
Advisory Council to Stanford's Institute for

International Studies led a roundtable talk
yesterday.
Speaking before a packed Kresge Auditori
um, the panel included former U.S. Secretary
of State and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Insti
tution George Shultz and former Prime Minis

ter of China and Vice Chairman of the Nation
al Committee of the Chinese People's Consul
tative Conference Wu Xueqian.
Also represented were Tommy Koh, visiting
lecturer and ambassador-at-large of the min
istry of foreign affairs of Singapore; Yotaro
Kobayashi, chairman and chief executive offi
cer of Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd. in Japan; Robert
Hawke, former prime minister of Australia;
and Michael Armacost, former U.S. ambas
sador to Japan.
The Pacific Rim, Shultz explained, is a re
gion occupied by one-third of the world's popu
lation. In addition, this region has some of the
highest savings and investments in the world.
Many of these countries, especially China,
are experiencing changes with the potential to
make the region economically powerful, the
group concluded. China is the first country
ever to make the transition from communism
to a socialist market economy.
According to Xuegian, China is "encounter
ing new challenges." For example, the country
has an extremely high inflation rate that is the
result of increased food prices and is "taking
every step to bringdown inflation" to about 15
percent, Xueqian said. In order to do this,
China will increase scientific farming to devise
increased and better food production.
Xuegian also spoke on the future of China's
foreign policy of peace and open arms, adding
that the country values relations with the
United States very highly. He assured the au
dience that China will not pursue a policy of ex-

pansionism.
China's economic potential is
enormous, Hawke said, adding
that it "will become the largest
economy in the world."
The group also discussed the
economic growth that East Asia
has experienced, with some
members tracing the trend to
Asian values. Koh spoke of a
combination of Asian values —
strong family and the willing

ness to endure short-term pain
for long-term gain — that have
helped the region succeed.
Hawke argued that the
growth can be explained in
terms of rational analysis, point
ing to the domestic investment
and government intervention
which has helped the region's
economy.
Although the region is doing
well, Koh said, East Asia should
not become smug and compla
cent. The acquisition of nuclear
weapons, possibly by North
Korea, could be destabilizing for
the area, he said.
