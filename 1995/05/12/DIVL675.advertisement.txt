Don't be dead certain
you're too young to have a
heart attack.
Last year 105,000 Americans under age 65 died of heart attacks. In fact,
45 percent of all heart attacks happen to people younger than 65. If
you're old enough to be concerned about heart disease, be wise enough
to take the steps recommended by the American Heart Association
to reduce your risk. Don't smoke. Reduce the fat and cholesterol in your
diet. And control high blood pressure. Act now. Because it's never
too early to start taking care of yourself.
