# Record year in donations
## 
### Colleen Krueger Senior staff writer 
Following a national trend of increased giving to
colleges and universities last year, Stanford donation
receipts jumped 24 percent in 1993-94 — making the
University third in the country in total gifts received.
According to a report released last week by the
Council for Aid to Education and reported in The
Chronicle of Higher Education, Stanford's total do
nations rose to $226,142,418 last fiscal year, as com
pared with $182,391,695 in 1992-93. Contributions
to private research universities averaged
$51,943,000.
And although factors like a healthy national econ
omy certainly help, Development Office Vice Presi
dent John Ford attributes much of the "record year"
to his office's determined efforts to reach out to alum
ni.
"We've been very successful this year on two lev
els," Ford said. "On the one hand... we've made a lot
of progress in getting alumni to understand we need
broad-based support, that those $50 donations are
very important.
"At the same time, we're doing very well at the
other end of the scale too," he added, citing donors
David Packard and William Hewlett's payment on
their Terman Fellows pledge as one example of
healthy trends in major gifts.
Hewlett and Packard's October pledge to fund $77
million for a new Science and Engineering Quad does
not even factor into this year's numbers, Ford added.
While gifts like Hewlett and Packard's may give
the impression that the bulk of Stanford's resources
comes from generous corporate
donors, Ford said that his office
has made a concentrated effort
since 1987 to reach out to smaller
private donors — an effort that
has apparently paid off.
"What's been happening in
Stanford's case is that the percent
age of dollars has shifted to more
individual gifts," Ford said.
"Before our 1987 drive, 60 to 65
percent of funds came from insti
tutions: corporations, foundations

and associations. Now 65 to 70
percent of the money comes from
individuals, which is the way you
want it for the health of the Uni
versity."
Stanford's high rate of overall
giving ranked third nationally —
up from fourth last year — behind
only Harvard University and the
University of Pennsylvania.
Overall, giving at the 992 insti
tutions surveyed in the report rose
by 10.3 percent — or 7.6 percent
adjusted for inflation — making
1993-94 the highest grossing year
since 1986-87.
Although the increase in giving
should affect Stanford's ranking in

U.S. News and World Report's
annual college edition, Ford said
that alumni dollars account for a
"very small fraction of the overall
ranking."
Ford emphasized that his office
is concentrating not so much on
pure dollar amounts as on match
ing those dollars to the Universi
ty's current needs.
"Certainly it's a question of
what those dollars do for Stan
ford, not how much," he said.
"Highly restricted funding that
benefits very few people is not as
high a priority as issues like
restoration, getting the library
open, working on the Main Quad,

financial aid dollars — things like
that.
"More important than num
bers, are we raising money for the
right things?" Ford asked.
Ford described the Stanford
Fund as the "centerpiece" of the
effort to build a larger base of
alumni supporters, since the fund
concentrates on those who attend
ed Stanford as undergraduates.
According to Ford, the fund's
giving rate is up five percentage
points, meaning a growth of
$600,000 for the University. He
cautioned, however, that "it will
take five to 10 years to see if this
experiment really works."
