# Exploiting athletes
## Lapchick speaks about racism in sports 
### Samuel Park Staff writer 
Citing numerous statistics on
the low college graduation rates of
black star athletes, journalist and
Northeastern University Prof.
Richard Lapchick stressed to a
crowd of about 60 last night at
Kresge Auditorium that racism is
rampant in the American educa
tional system.
Lapchick — the keynote speaker
for"The Athlete's Body in History,
on the Field, in Society," a free
three-day conference linking aca
demics and athletics — emphasized
the point that athletes are often
cheated of an education by a system
that exploits their athletic talents
but neglects their academic needs.
"Too many of these athletes
waste their opportunities because
there are people encouraging them
by their side" to ignore academics,
Lapchick said. "And athletics is no
different than any other area of
our society."
Lapchick, author of the book
"Broken Promises: Racism in
American Sports," turned to nar
ration to illustrate his point. He
told the story of a student who was
allowed to go from elementary
school to college without basic
thinking and writing skills
because the schools he attended
wanted to reap the rewards of hav
ing a star athlete.
After Lapchick delivered his
introductory comments, Athletics

Director Ted Leiand opened up the
discussion to other members of a
panel made up of Stanford stu
dent-athletes and faculty mem
bers. Golf player Tiger Woods took
the opportunity to address the
problem of racism from his own
personal experience.
"When I was playing in my first
tour, I was the youngest one ever
to play, at age 16, and I was under
a serious death threat the whole
time I was there," Woods recount
ed. "Phone calls, letters saying
'nigger this, nigger that,' referring
to me as a so-called young gifted
supernatural nigger and saying
that I had no business playing."
Woods then drew laughter from
the audience as he recounted
golfer Mike Nichols' mistake in
saying that blacks and whites have
different bodies, and that white
people's bodies are more fit for
"passive sports," such as golf.
"People get this stereotype that
racism is strictly in the South.
That's BS. It's everywhere,"
Woods said.
Harvard University Prof.
Henry Louis Gates had been origi
nally scheduled to speak at the
opening of the conference, but
according to Leiand, Gates can
celed a week ago.
"He said that he could not come
because he was receiving an hon
orary doctrine somewhere, and
this was after we had published
the poster" advertising the event,
Leiand said.
