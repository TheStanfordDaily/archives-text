Nichols had bomb materials
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Evidence seized from Terry
Nichols' house included a lethal inventory of bomb-making
materials and receipts for storage sheds in Kansas towns
rented last fall under assumed names, according to an affi
davit released yesterday.
FBI investigators say Nichols wrote a letter to be deliv
ered to Timothy McVeigh upon Nichols' death telling his
Army buddy to clear the sheds and "Go for it!"
The evidence was detailed in an FBI affidavit unsealed in
a court hearing for the 40-year-old Nichols, who is charged
with McVeigh in the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
The affidavit provides the largest inventory to date of
bomb-making supplies allegedly seized from Nichols' house
in Herington, Kan., after the April 19 bombing. It also links
Nichols to three storage sheds, two of which were rented last
fall just before the purchase of two tons of fertilizer believed
to be a key ingredient in the 4,800-pound ammonium nitrate
and fuel bomb that exploded in front of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building.
Nichols, who was shackled hand and foot, stared straight
ahead when interim U.S. Attorney Patrick Ryan told the
court that Nichols faces the death penalty if convicted.
A search of Nichols' house in Herington, Kan., found five
60-foot detonator cords with non-electric blasting caps and

several containers of ground ammonium nitrate, which can
be used to help boost a fertilizer-fuel bomb, the affidavit said.
The 10-page document also said FBI agents found a fuel
meter which can be used to obtain "the proper volume of
diesel oil to ammonium nitrate for a bomb."
GM trucks to use ethanol fuel
DES MOINES, lowa (AP) — General Motors will offer
two lines of 1997 pickups that can run on gas, corn-based
ethanol or a combination, the first time any such vehicles
will be mass produced, the company said yesterday.
GM could make as many as 100,000 of the Chevrolet S
series and GMC Sonoma pickup trucks to sell in North
America, GM Vice President Dennis R. Minano said.
Supporters argue that ethanol burns cleaner than stan
dard gasoline, reducing pollution.
Ethanol-blended fuel — generally 10 percent ethanol
and 90 percent gasoline — is sold throughout the Midwest.
The blended fuel can be used in virtually all vehicles
without modification. The new GM trucks will run on fuel
with ethanol content as high as 85 percent, as well as on
the blended fuel of standard gasoline.
Running on the blended or higher-concentrated ethanol
does not affect mileage or speed. It costs about the same as
gasoline.
