### 
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) - Fearful
that the deadly Ebola virus would
spread beyond central Zaire, officials
yesterday imposed more restrictions on
travel and advised people to stay off the
streets in the city where the outbreak
began.
In Kikwit, a city of 600,000 about
370 miles east of the capital of Kin
shasa, health and government officials
closed schools and health clinics, can
celed flights and advised people to stay
at home. Work in the agriculturally
important area stopped.
Dozens of people in the region have
died so far. The number of deaths has
been difficult to nail down because of
conflicting reports and the uncertainty
that Ebola was the cause of all deaths.
Health officials also were investigat
ing a possible second outbreak of the
virus in a hospital in the village of
Musango, 60 miles from Kikwit. A
nurse who had worked in the Kikwit
hospital where the epidemic began died

in the village.
The 350-bed hospital was nearly
empty when health experts arrived yes
terday to investigate.
To contain the virus, the hospital
was cleared out except for infected
patients and hospital staff exposed to
the virus, about 20 people total, said
Doctors Without Borders spokeswom
an Veerle Eygenraam.
Another 100 people in Kikwit were
confined to their homes because they
had been exposed to the virus, in most
cases by a family member who had died,
Eygenraam said.
"It is quite serious because it is a
very infectious virus. But we have
found out about it very early and in
hospitals and we have taken all the nec
essary measures to decrease transmis
sion," Eygenraam said.
An Italian nun who worked at the
Kikwit hospital, 48-year-old Danielan
gelina Sorti, died yesterday, Eygen
raam said. Two other members of the

Poverelle order were in serious but sta
ble condition at the hospital and 12
nuns were continuing their work there,
said a Poverelle nun in Kinshasa, Sister
Mauricia.
"We will continue our work, despite
the risks. We cannot abandon them
now," she said, struggling to hold back
tears.
A Doctors Without Borders team
arrived in Kikwit on Thursday to try to
contain the virus and determine
whether it had spread beyond people
who were linked to the hospital or their
families.
A team from the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta also arrived in Zaire
on Thursday.
"We don't know where the disease
came from and we're not sure where it
has spread, especially in the villages,"
said Eygenraam.
Beside Musango, aid workers were
concerned that the virus may have
spread to two other villages.
