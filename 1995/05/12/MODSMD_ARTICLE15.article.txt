# Nuclear treaty renewed

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - After a
month's debate on the world's nuclear
future, a global conference yesterday
renewed the Non-Proliferation Treaty
permanently, extending its limits on
man's deadliest weapons into the next
century.
It was a diplomatic victory for the U.S.-
led nuclear powers, which resisted efforts
by non-nuclear states to make extending
the 25-year-old treaty conditional on
greater, faster cuts in their nuclear arse
nals.
American U.N. Ambassador Madeleine
K. Albright hailed it as a "sterling suc
cess" and President Clinton, visiting
Ukraine, said it would "build a better
future for our children and the genera
tions to come."
But one delegate here, echoing
widespread sentiment in the Third World,
called it little more than a "carte blanche"
for nuclear powers.
Without a vote, the indefinite extension
was gaveled into effect by Conference
President Jayantha Dhanapala, to a brief
burst of applause among more than 170
national delegations under the soaring
dome of the U.N. General Assembly hall.
The decision will perpetuate an inter
national system under which only five
nations are recognized as legitimate
nuclear powers — whose governments are
supposed to work "in good faith" toward

eliminating their weapons.
Trying to meet Third World demands,
the weapon states agreed to a compromise
package: a list of goals for arms control —
including completion of a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty next year — and a
system of annual meetings to review
progress toward the goals.
Dhanapala, of Sri Lanka, described the
package as "a fair and equitable balance of
interests."
But a handful of delegates took the
floor after the treaty was formally extend
ed to register — for the record — their
unhappiness with the results, citing the
non-binding nature of the goals.
It represents a "carte blanche," said
Malaysia's Hasamy bin Agam, that
"might be interpreted as justifying nucle
ar weapon states for eternity."
Chief U.S. negotiator Thomas Graham
Jr., speaking with reporters, countered
that the goals are "politically" if not legal
ly binding and the package establishes "a
measure of accountability for the nuclear
weapon states."
Arab states addressed the conference
too, complaining bitterly about the failure
of Israel, which has a clandestine nuclear
weapons program, to accede to the Non-
Proliferation Treaty. A compromise reso
lution was adopted calling on all Middle
East states that have not signed the treaty
to do so.
