# Committee approves budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sidestepping a
family fight over tax cuts, Senate Republi
cans won committee approval yesterday for
a balanced-budget plan that relies heavily
on savings from Medicare and Medicaid.
Democrats were unanimous in their opposi
tion.
Reflecting a coordinated, politically risky
attack on deficits, the proposal roughly
tracks a companion bill that advanced
through the House budget panel less than
24 hours earlier. Both houses are expected
to stage historic debates in the next two
weeks on the GOP drive to eradicate deficits
by 2002.
"This is a federal government that is too
big to let us be free, that spends too much
and borrows too much to let the economy be
free," said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.,

chairman of the committee and principal
author of the spending blueprint.
The committee vote was 12-10 with all
Republicans voting in favor and all
Democrats against.
Outvoted at every turn, Democrats
administered their daily tongue-lashing to
the GOP budget plans. White House offi
cials attacked proposals to carve billions of
dollars in savings from Head Start, educa
tion and job training and by eliminating
President Clinton's cherished national vol
unteer program.
"We have been waiting for 15 years for
the Republicans to take the responsibility
for presenting a budget to the people of the
United States," said Senate Democratic
Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. "It
appears now it wasn't worth the wait."
