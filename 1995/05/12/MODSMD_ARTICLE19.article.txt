## A 						broader education 
### 
University should offer
more internships at its
international campuses

CONTRARY TO popular wis
dom, it's a big world. And
it's getting bigger. Govern
ments, corporations, universities
and public interest organizations
are expanding into the global mar
ketplace, and are learning that
doing well in a global environment
means more than just understand
ing international relations. It
means understanding the interna
tional relationships that develop
among the people who are trying
to do business with each other.
And more and more, working
with other people means learning
to speak their language and feel
comfortable engaging in discus
sions and negotiations under a
variety of cultural systems and
backgrounds. Students who leave
Stanford without those skills
under their belts will be at a seri
ous disadvantage compared to
their counterparts in more linguis
tically and culturally informed
countries than the United States.
Overseas studies holds as its
mission to expand the perspectives
of undergraduates during their
time here, giving them a sense of
how truly different it is to live and
work in another nation. But for
the most part, overseas programs
emphasize the academic aspects of
the overseas experience, placing
students in a university environ
ment of a new country. In many
cases, however, the traditional
overseas experience leaves the
interpersonal aspects of a stu
dent's education completely up to
the individual. They may have
made friends in their host coun
tries, but they were seldom
required to work and speak in the
native language â€” learning the
skills of business outside of the
American mainstream.
Learning to create and maintain
those personal business relation

ships is nothing like what's taught
in a Stanford classroom. It can't be
absorbed from the most well
planned lecture or digested during
the most dead ol Dead Weeks.
Learning to work with people in a
different language, following a dif
ferent set of cultural guidelines
and making business decisions for
a different economic system can
only be learned by immersion.
There are programs, however,
that have found ways to encourage
that sort of personal experience.
The internships offered at Stan
ford-in-Berlin and the Kyoto cen
ter give Stanford students the
chance to actually face up to the
realities of working in a foreign
language. Having to make reports
to your German supervisors in
German is a big step from giving
an oral presentation in a class with
a group of English-speaking Stem
ford students as critics. Stanford
students who have returned from
the Krupp internship program in
Germany point to the fundamen
tal importance their work experi
ence had in making them comfort
able carrying out business in the
language.
Unfortunately, most overseas
centers do not provide that sort of
opportunity directly. If students
want to learn the unique style of
business in the UK, they're pretty
much on their own in terms of
finding internship opportunities.
And in many cases, there's not
much chance of obtaining a work
visa without some sort of universi
ty help in getting through the host
nation's administrative bureau
cracy.
The University should recog
nize how vital international skills
are to students who leave Stanford
to face the big wide world, and sup
port internship programs at more
of its overseas centers. Finding
private donors or corporate spon
sors to run internship programs at
each center definitely carries an
administrative cost, but the funda
mental benefits to students' edu
cation cannot be overemphasized
or oversupported.
