Stanford's Graduate School of Business is the sec
ond most "gay-friendly" in the nation, according to a
recent study conducted by a Stanford business school
student.
The study, compiled by Jason Lorber, looked at the
top MBA programs as rated in either Business Week or
U.S. News & World Report magazines. Lorber said he
found that the higher-rated business schools were also
rated higher for being gay-friendly under his criteria.
"Business organizations that tend to be the most in
novative are those that are most open to new ideas,"
Lorber said.
"They are also visionary — looking at the issue of
creating a gay-friendly environment not only as a civil
rights issue but also as a competitive advantage," he
said.
Business schools want "to attract the best talent —
and some of the talent is gay," Lorber added.
Harvard University's business school ranked first
in the study with an "A" grade while Lorber gave last
ranked Purdue University an "F" grade. Lorber looked
at various criteria which he weighted in importance
after speaking with students, pro
fessors and alumni.
Categories included in the sur
vey were: whether the school had
clubs for lesbian, gay or bisexual
students; if an openly gay student
was profiled in the admissions
brochure; the existence of domes
tic partner benefits; and whether
an openly gay professor taught at
the particular business school.
To gather information, Lorber
talked to more than 100 adminis
trators, faculty, students and
alumni between October 1994 and
February 1995.
Stanford's business school has
all the elements to be gay-friendly,
according to Lorber's criteria,
except for an openly gay professor.
The only missing element at the
top-ranked Harvard is a profile of
an openly gay student in its admis
sions brochure.
Lorber said he decided to con
duct the study because of his own
experiences applying to business
schools. "I wanted to go to a top
business school, but I also wanted
to be in an environment where I
could contribute openly," he said.

After becoming chair of the
business school's gay, lesbian and
bisexual student organization, Out
for Business, Lorber said he start
ed receiving calls from all over the
nation.
"People who were like me, they
wanted to fmd out what it was like
to be gay at Stanford," he said.
"That's why I did it — to be able to
provide information for students."
Lorber said he hopes his criteria
for evaluation will be looked at by
business schools who hope to cre
ate a more gay-friendly environ
ment.
"I think it's important for
schools to be aware of what mea
sures can be tfJten to make a gay
friendly environment," he said.
"When you start measuring
results and you hold schools
accountable for those results —
that's when you start seeing
change."
The study will be published in a
forthcoming book. Titled "Straight
Jobs, Gay Lives" and authored by
Harvard Business School alumni,
the book profiles lesbian, gay and
bisexual alumni and the challenges
they face living with "straight work
lives" and "gay personal lives."
Lorber said he also plans to
make the report available on the
World Wide Web this summer.
