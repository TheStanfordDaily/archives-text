Stanford's Graduate School of Business is the sec
ond most "gay-friendly" in the nation, according to a
recent study conducted by a Stanford business school
student.
The study, compiled by Jason Lorber, looked at the
top MBA programs as rated in either Business Week or
U.S. News & World Report magazines. Lorber said he
found that the higher-rated business schools were also
rated higher for being gay-friendly under his criteria.
"Business organizations that tend to be the most in
novative are those that are most open to new ideas,"
Lorber said.
"They are also visionary — looking at the issue of
creating a gay-friendly environment not only as a civil
rights issue but also as a competitive advantage," he
said.
Business schools want "to attract the best talent —
and some of the talent is gay," Lorber added.
Harvard University's business school ranked first
in the study with an "A" grade while Lorber gave last
ranked Purdue University an "F" grade. Lorber looked
at various criteria which he weighted in importance
