## A 						few of my favorite things 
### 
MY MOTHER asked me whether I
could write something light for a
change. Well, OK, I will take
advantage of the opportunity offered by a
weekly column to indulge. Herewith, a list
of a few of my favorite people and things.
Fountain pens; bow ties; black sport
coats; stand-up desks; the Democratic
Party; The New Republic magazine, even
if it has moved to the right; Ludwig
Wittgenstein's life and philosophy, in that
order.
The Honda Hawk GT motorcycle. It
gained a following for its light weight and
sporting capabilities. A 650 cc V-twin pow
erplant in an aluminum twin-spar frame,
with a single-sided rear swingarm. No fair
ing, the classic naked bike.
Glenn Gould's 1955 recording of Bach's
Goldberg Variations. A mono recording,
but a best-seller to this day. His humming
along is not as apparent as in the later re
recording, made shortly before his death,
which features the most unflattering
album cover photograph imaginable — he
is dressed in a heavy overcoat and hunched
over the piano like a troll. Glenn Gould has
always been marketed as an eccentric
genius, so his posthumous growth into the
role should not be off-putting. "The Pen
guin Guide to Classical Recordings" pans
Gould still, so he cannot be all bad. Listen
ing to Gould play almost makes me wish
I'd practiced my piano lessons.
Philip Glass' "Glassworks." His first
hit. Minimalist music defmed. The Pen

guin Guide pans Glass, too.
The Cowboy Junkies, led by Margo
Timmins' vocals. On "The Trinity Ses
sions," "Misguided Angel." On "The Cau
tion Horses," "Where Are You Tonight?"
On "Black eyed man," "A Horse in the
Country" and "To Live is to Fly." The per
fect late night music to accompany drink
ing alone.
Paul Auster, Nicholson Baker and
Stephen Millhauser. These contemporary
writers have produced work that will out
last the fads that came before and after
them. Auster's New York trilogy gives a
good name to meta-fiction; Baker's early
novels, before the famous phone sex of
"Vox," transforms literary non-fiction;
and Millhauser is an authentic American
practitioner of magical realism, and one
wonders which of his early novels is the
autobiographical truth of the matter.
Annie Dillard's "Pilgrim at Tinker
Creek" and "An American Childhood."
The passage in Pilgrim about the frog that
deflates is ironically the most alive nature
writing I have ever read. It is wonderful for
reading aloud.
Georges Seurat's pointillist paintings.
Anyone with that dedication to a concept,
and an ability to carry it out so successful
ly, deserves to be admired.
Architect Richard Meier's early residen
tial work. Le Corbusier's "machines for
living" are realized in these designs. You
probably could not live in them, but that is
beside the point.

The detectives-as-a-couple television
series that came before "Moonlighting,"
"Remington Steele," starring Pierce Bros
nan, the new James Bond, and Stephanie
Zimbalist, as a Stanford alumna con
fronting a sexist world by inventing a male
boss.
Those old Chanel No. 5 commercials,
the surreal ones, which were so preten
tious I had to love them.
Comedian Steven Wright, with his hair
line receding but still wild, who can be seen
in an early cameo in Madonna's only hit
movie, "Desperately Seeking Susan," and
heard as the deejay in the infamous ear
scene in Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir
Dogs," and seen again in a recent cameo in
"Natural Born Killers."
My favorite joke. Skeleton walks into a
bar. "Whadda you have?" "A beer ... and
a mop."
"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai
Across the Eighth Dimension." This high
camp movie was made to be a cult classic.
The amazing cast includes Peter Weller,
Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin, John Lith
gow, Christopher Lloyd and Clancy
Brown. Ever since seeing it I have won
dered if its trademark line of dialogue is an
authentic Zen koan. If not, it should be:
"No matter where you go ... there you
are."

Frank also loves Stanford.
