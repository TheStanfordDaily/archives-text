Stop the presses: University attempting to control image

FORGET THE POLITE rhetoric:
The Stanford Administration's
proposal to merge its newspaper,
The Stanford Observer, with the inde
pendent Stanford magazine, edited by
the Alumni Association, is a clear
attempt to extend central control over
the University's external communica
tions.
Present plans call for a 32-page news
and feature insert between 80 pages of
class notes and other alumni material.
Frequency will be stepped up from four
to six issues annually. Ostensibly, the
magazine and news insert will be edited
separately; in fact, informal spin control
will flow more and more from Building
10 to Bowman.
The proposed change, which probably
will be approved by the Alumni Associa
tion May 20, was triggered by the maga
zine's coverage of gays at Stanford.
What difference will the change
make?
First, the University's communica
tion costs will increase substantially.

Until e-mail becomes more universal,
there's simply no way to deliver a com
prehensive set of news, features and —
yes — official pronouncements as quick
ly and cheaply as by newspaper.
Second, external news media will be
even more important in setting Stan
ford's image with alumni.
While The Observer has been steadily
cut from nine issues annually to four, it
remains the leading source of Stanford
news for a majority of alumni. Folding it
into the magazine will reduce its visibili
ty.
A Development Office survey last year
found that, except for The Observer,
"alumni currently base their impres
sions of Stanford more on information
from outside newspapers, radio and tele
vision than from other university
sources, such as department newsletters
and letters from the president."
University President Gerhard Casper
feels that he has "a very difficult task
getting across what the University's pri
orities are." But the survey showed more

than three out of four alumni felt The
Observer does at least "a good job" of
helping them "understand the Universi
ty's position on important issues."
Nine out of 10 agreed that "Stanford
does a good job of keeping [alumni]
informed about the what's happening at
the University." And nine out of 10 said
both The Observer and Stanford maga
zine helped them feel closer to campus.
(Administrators who went public with a
news summary of the survey took heat
for disclosing even this limited informa
tion. That's unusual for an institution
committed to openness in research and
unprecedented for Stanford attitude sur
veys.)
As in every previous independent sur
vey over the past 25 years, the newspa
per edged the magazine in most key
stats, despite its far less costly format.
Tenured faculty weary of belt-tightening
may want to inquire just how much
more it will cost to deliver the news
within Stanford magazine.
Recognition that candid, comprehen

sive campus coverage simply wasn't get
ting through to key audiences was the
most important rationale for creating
The Observer in 1968. Jointly conceived
by the Alumni Association, University
Relations and News Service and strongly
endorsed by outside fund-raising coun
sel, its stories have led directly to tens of
millions of dollars in incremental gift
support.
Major foundation grants, endowed
professorships and charitable remainder
trusts originated from reporting about
Stanford's people with simplicity and
candor, not slickness, control and a tin
cup.
Administrators should never underes
timate the intelligence, creativity and
good humor that Stanford fosters among
its alums. They can spot a company line
a mile away. This year's graduating class
did just that in preserving their Com
mencement walk.
