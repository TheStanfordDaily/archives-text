# Administration should copy Duke in its efforts to calm commencement
## 
### 
I have watched the graduation pro
cession crisis with some interest, as
we had a similar problem when I grad
uated from Duke back in 1992. A few
of the most recent graduating classes
had been very rowdy during the Com
mencement ceremony, with antics

such as bouncing beach balls, shooting
champagne corks, the immortal graffi
ti-enhanced mortar boards and vari
ous sundry, lewd activities. The
administration, of course, was embar
rassed by all of this, and the deans
desperately sought a way to control
the students.
I do not know how many long hours
they spent devising their plan, but in
the end, it was a beautiful one. There
were two stages. The first stage was to
announce that graduation gowns
would be searched as students entered

the stadium. This measure was just
insulting and stupid-sounding enough
to deflect attention from stage two of
the fiendishly cunning plot. This sec
ond stage was expressly designed to
disable all would-be purveyors of com
mencement chaos. The key, you see,
was this: They held a seniors-only, all
you-can drink keg party.
Keg party? Administration? They
don't exactly go hand-in-hand, but it
was a tremendous success (I do have
some vague memories of it). Needless
to say, come graduation morning, row

diness had been replaced with dehy
dration, headache and latent nausea.
Commencement went off without a
hitch, and 1 the one or two beach balls
and champagne bottles (administra
tion plants, no doubt) made the cere
mony feel pleasantly rebellious.
Now, I don't claim that this tech
nique will work for every university,
but I think Stanford should give it a
try. Especially if they invite the grad
students.
