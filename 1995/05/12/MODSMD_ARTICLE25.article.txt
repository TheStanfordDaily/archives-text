## Women hope to ride streak into NCAAs Pepperdine-Vandy winner will be initial opponent 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The journey seemed almost impossible back in
September. The ultimate destination, Pepperdine
and the NCAA championships, remained in the dis
tant future with stops around the country in Los
Angeles, Tucson, Tempe, Berkeley and Madison,
Wis.
Yet the second season has arrived, and the Stan
ford women's tennis squad has survived the arduous
trip, posting a 21-1 overall record and sustaining an
undefeated 10-0 mark in collegiate tennis's most
competitive conference, the Pacific 10 Conference's
Southern Division.
The Cardinal has returned to its preseason
national ranking of No. 3 in this postseason, and
beginning Saturday, will begin defending their No. 3
seed in the national tournament.
The NCAA selection committee released its main
draw for the national championship at the beginning
of this month, selecting 20 teams from around the
country. The committee named Florida (24-2) the
top seed, followed by Texas (22-3), Stanford and
Georgia (21-3), the No. 1 squad for much of the sea
son. The committee places the other 16 teams in four
groups, the first representing the 5-8 seeds, the next
the 9-12 seeds, etc., but does not distinguish seeds
within each group.
The teams vying for the title ideally desire to peak
now so as to be playing their best tennis of the year
this weekend in Malibu. No team in the draw fits
that mold better than the Cardinal, winners of 10
consecutive dual matches. The streak consists of
seven consecutive contests against the country's top
12 teams including five against the tournament's top
nine seeds. Stanford put them all down.
"I think our strongest point right now is that
we're kind of a hot team," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan, who was recently named Pac-10
Coach of the Year. "We're finishing the season real
strong. We won 10 in a row, we had a good Ojai

[tournament], everybody's
healthy, and everybody's playing
well. I can see tremendous
improvement since two months
ago. We're on a real high right
now."
The Cardinal's undefeated
Pac-10 South record and confer
ence title becomes even more
impressive after seeing the selec
tion committee's picks. Stanford
and the other five teams of the
Pac-10 South, all of whom Stan
ford defeated twice, comprise half
of the draw's top 12 seeds and
four of the top eight. Specifically,
in addition to Stanford's three
seed, Arizona State, California,
and UCLA sit in the 5-8 slot,
while Arizona and USC are in the
9-12 group.
"It just bears out what I've

thought all season: it was a heck
of a season in the Pac-10. We have
a lot to be proud of. We're going in
there flying high," Brennan said.
The top four seeds all will
await the results of four prelimi
nary matches which pit the 13-16
seeds against the 17-20 teams.
The Cardinal will meet the win
ner of the Pepperdine (14-9 and a
13-16 seed)-Vanderbilt (15-7 and
a 17-20 seed) matchup.
Despite being the higher seed
and the home squad, Stanford
does have more of an edge versus
the Waves since they have met
before. Psychologically, Pepper
dine would have to overcome the
memory of an 8-1 shellacking by
the Cardinal in March of this sea
son. The Cardinal also played
without first team All Pac-10
selection Ania Bleszynski and an
injured Amy Chiminello in the
doubles lineup. They have not
met Vanderbilt this season.
The draw represents incredible

parity this year. NCAA defending
champions Georgia, the National
Team Indoor Champion and the
No. 1 for the msyority of the sea
son, eventually fell three times, to
Florida twice and to William and
Mary. These losses bumped the
Lady Bulldogs to a four seed and a
No. 2 national ranking, ending an
11-month streak at the No. 1 posi
tion. Georgia took the title last
May on their homecourts in
Athens, defeating the Cardinal in
the final match.
Florida, the No. 1 team in the
nation, sat behind Georgia at No.
2 until the most recent rankings,
possibly due to a poor showing at
the Team Indoors in February.
The Gators fell prey to the Ari
zona Wildcats 5-2 in the tourna
ment's second round. Florida also
dropped a match to Texas in
March which prompted a 17-
match win streak that they take
with them into the tournament.
The second-seeded Longhorns,

who swept their conference as
well, lost only three matches in a
grueling schedule. While dropping
matches to Georgia, Duke (a 5-8
seed) and Arizona, Texas has
downed Florida, Stanford and
Cal.
The Cardinal's only two losses
occurred over two months ago
within the same week. UCLA sent
Stanford back home 5-4 in the
second round of the Team Indoors
in Madison only to meet Texas at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The Longhorns hooked the Cardi
nal for a 6-3 loss.
That defeat initiated the Stan
ford turn-around. If the top seeds
hold true to form, the Cardinal
will have the opportunity to
avenge those two losses. They
would meet UCLA in the quarter
finals and Texas in the semifi
nals.
The top four powerhouses can
not ignore the lower seeds in the
tournament. Cal, No. 5 in the

country, sits in the 5-8 group with
UCLA. The Golden Bears started
off extremely slowly, but have
turned up the heat as of late.
They have won nine of their last
10, the only loss coming at the
hands of the Cardinal. UCLA has
dropped six straight dual match
es, but have been plagued by
injuries and can turn it around in
a hurry if healthy, as indicated by
a second place finish to Georgia at
the National Team Indoors.
In the 9-12 group reside the
Arizona Wildcats. Underestimat
ing this squad had proven deadly
throughout the season as Texas,
Florida, UCLA, and Cal can all
attest. USC may have a dismal 8-
13 record, but the Trojans com
peted against the top teams in the
country week in and week out.
William and Mary obviously has
upset potential as well, having
downed Georgia 5-4 in April.
"They're all pretty good,"
Brennan said. "It's one of those

years where everybody's equal, so
I don't know. I'm respectful of
everyone. I'm afraid of everyone
who stands across the net from
us."
Yet the Cardinal are on a roll,
and the squad seems to be confi
dent and set with its lineup. "I
think the people have confidence
in all the players right now. I
think we're hitting on all eight
cylinders," said Brennan.
Representing the Cardinal in
the individual NCAA champi
onship held after the team compe
tition will be first team All-Pac-10
members Katie Schlukebir and
An La Bleszynski and second team
All Pac-10 member Kim Shasby.
Freshman Julie Scott received a
fourth alternate nomination. In
doubles, the Cardinal will sendits
No. 1 of Bleszynski and SchMke
bir and its No. 2 squad of Shasby
and sophomore Emily Burt. Scott
and Chiminello were named the
sixth alternates. /
