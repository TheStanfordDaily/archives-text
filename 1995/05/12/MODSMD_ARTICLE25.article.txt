## Women hope to ride streak into NCAAs Pepperdine-Vandy winner will be initial opponent

The journey seemed almost impossible back in
September. The ultimate destination, Pepperdine
and the NCAA championships, remained in the dis
tant future with stops around the country in Los
Angeles, Tucson, Tempe, Berkeley and Madison,
Wis.
Yet the second season has arrived, and the Stan
ford women's tennis squad has survived the arduous
trip, posting a 21-1 overall record and sustaining an
undefeated 10-0 mark in collegiate tennis's most

country. The committee named Florida (24-2) the
top seed, followed by Texas (22-3), Stanford and
Georgia (21-3), the No. 1 squad for much of the sea

groups, the first representing the 5-8 seeds, the next
the 9-12 seeds, etc., but does not distinguish seeds
within each group.
The teams vying for the title ideally desire to peak
now so as to be playing their best tennis of the year
this weekend in Malibu. No team in the draw fits
that mold better than the Cardinal, winners of 10
consecutive dual matches. The streak consists of
seven consecutive contests against the country's top
12 teams including five against the tournament's top
nine seeds. Stanford put them all down.
"I think our strongest point right now is that
we're kind of a hot team," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan, who was recently named Pac-10
Coach of the Year. "We're finishing the season real
strong. We won 10 in a row, we had a good Ojai
