# Gould's team seeks NCAA title in Atlanta
## Top-ranked men's tennis faces Duke in first round 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
Olympic tennis will not come
to Athens, Georgia until next
year, but the red, white, and blue
of the Stanford Cardinal and
Duke Blue Devils will converge
tomorrow in a match just as
important as Olympic competi
tion for the two teams.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal
(23-0 overall, 10-0 in the Pacific
-10 Conference) will begin play in
the NCAA championships' round
of 16 tomorrow morning at 11
a.m. EST at the University of
Georgia's Henry Field Stadium.
Ranked atop the nation since
the preseason, the Cardinal is the
top seed in the tournament but
will have to get by a scary squad
from No. 9-ranked Duke (23-4, 7-
1 in the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence) in the first round.
The ACC champion Blue Dev
ils fell from No. 6 in the preseason
rankings, and are seeded 13-16 in
this year's tournament. They are
currently riding a seven-match
win streak and are 10-3 against
teams in the top 25. In addition,
they return all their players from
last year's 21-6 team that was
eliminated 4-0 in the NCAA quar
terfinals by eventual runner-up
Stanford.
"Before the season started, I
thought Duke had a pretty good
shot at winning the whole thing,"
said Cardinal junior Ricky Beck
er. "Then they pretty much
underachieved the whole year.
But they're still dangerous."
And Stanford would have like
to avoided a "dangerous" team in
the first round.
"Usually you hope to play a
somewhat easy first round oppo
nent that will get you broken in to

the tournament, but with Duke it
just hits us right away," Becker
said.
Becker's partner in No. 2 dou
bles, Jim Thomas, rationalizes his
team's tough draw.
"If our goal is to win the whole
tournament, we have to beat all
the good teams anyway. We are
starting off with a good team,"
Thomas said.
Duke is led by two-time All
American selection senior Chris
Pressley (17-7 overall, 16-6 in
dual matches), who is ranked No.
15. He was ranked as high as No.
3 in the preseason, but fell in the
rankings after an injured shoul
der caused him to sit out the fall
tournaments. Pressley will meet
the Cardinal's No. 6-ranked
junior Jeff Salzenstein (37-10, 20-

3 in dual matches) in a No. 1 sin
gles battle of team captains..
In No. 2 singles, Blue Devil
junior Rob Chess (31-11, 14-6 in
dual matches) is ranked No. 25
and will face recently named Pac
-10 Rookie of the Year Scott
Humphries (30-7, 16-3 in dual
matches). Chess defeated Salzen
stein 7-5, 3-6, 6-1 earlier this sea
son at the Rolex Singles Champi
onships, but will have to face
Humphries tomorrow. The Cardi
nal freshman jumped from No. 25
to No. 10 in the latest rankings
after winning the Pac-10 Singles
Championship last week in Ojai.
None of Duke's bottom four
singles representatives are
ranked in the top 100 nationally,
