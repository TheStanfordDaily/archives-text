# Gould's team seeks NCAA title in Atlanta
## Top-ranked men's tennis faces Duke in first round 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
Olympic tennis will not come
to Athens, Georgia until next
year, but the red, white, and blue
of the Stanford Cardinal and
Duke Blue Devils will converge
tomorrow in a match just as
important as Olympic competi
tion for the two teams.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal
(23-0 overall, 10-0 in the Pacific
-10 Conference) will begin play in
the NCAA championships' round
of 16 tomorrow morning at 11
a.m. EST at the University of
Georgia's Henry Field Stadium.
Ranked atop the nation since
the preseason, the Cardinal is the
top seed in the tournament but
will have to get by a scary squad
from No. 9-ranked Duke (23-4, 7-
1 in the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence) in the first round.
The ACC champion Blue Dev
ils fell from No. 6 in the preseason
rankings, and are seeded 13-16 in
this year's tournament. They are
currently riding a seven-match
win streak and are 10-3 against
teams in the top 25. In addition,
they return all their players from
last year's 21-6 team that was
eliminated 4-0 in the NCAA quar
terfinals by eventual runner-up
Stanford.
"Before the season started, I
thought Duke had a pretty good
shot at winning the whole thing,"
said Cardinal junior Ricky Beck
er. "Then they pretty much
underachieved the whole year.
But they're still dangerous."
And Stanford would have like
to avoided a "dangerous" team in
the first round.
"Usually you hope to play a
somewhat easy first round oppo
nent that will get you broken in to

the tournament, but with Duke it
just hits us right away," Becker
said.
Becker's partner in No. 2 dou
bles, Jim Thomas, rationalizes his
team's tough draw.
"If our goal is to win the whole
tournament, we have to beat all
the good teams anyway. We are
starting off with a good team,"
Thomas said.
Duke is led by two-time All
American selection senior Chris
Pressley (17-7 overall, 16-6 in
dual matches), who is ranked No.
15. He was ranked as high as No.
3 in the preseason, but fell in the
rankings after an injured shoul
der caused him to sit out the fall
tournaments. Pressley will meet
the Cardinal's No. 6-ranked
junior Jeff Salzenstein (37-10, 20-

3 in dual matches) in a No. 1 sin
gles battle of team captains..
In No. 2 singles, Blue Devil
junior Rob Chess (31-11, 14-6 in
dual matches) is ranked No. 25
and will face recently named Pac
-10 Rookie of the Year Scott
Humphries (30-7, 16-3 in dual
matches). Chess defeated Salzen
stein 7-5, 3-6, 6-1 earlier this sea
son at the Rolex Singles Champi
onships, but will have to face
Humphries tomorrow. The Cardi
nal freshman jumped from No. 25
to No. 10 in the latest rankings
after winning the Pac-10 Singles
Championship last week in Ojai.
None of Duke's bottom four
singles representatives are
ranked in the top 100 nationally,

Junior Ricky Becker and the Stanford men's tennis team have a
chance to record a perfect season in 1995.
but Stanford boasts two ranked
players in those slots: No. 41
freshman Paul Goldstein (29-7,
20-2 in dual matches) and No. 65
junior Thomas (23-10, 18-4 in
dual matches).
In doubles, the Blue Devils are
anchored by the No. 14-ranked
duo of Chess and junior Bobby
Ayers (25-12, 18-6 in dual match
es). They will lock horns with the
younger but higher ranked Cardi
nal tandem of Humphries and
Goldstein (39-7, 16-4 in dual
matches), ranked No. 2. In an ear
lier meeting at the All-American
Championships in October, the
Cardinal freshmen were defeated
by Chess and Ayers, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3.
After that loss Humphries and
Goldstein went on a tear, winning
five consecutive tournaments in a
row.
Stanford's No. 54-ranked pair
of Thomas and junior Ricky Beck
er (23-10, 13-6 in dual matches)
will face unranked Pressley and
Phillipe Moggio in No. 2 doubles.
Should the Cardinal avoid an
upset of Seattle Supersonic-like
proportions in the first round, it
will face the winner of the match
between No. 14 California (16-6,
5-5 in the Pac-10) and No. 7 Mis
sissippi State (18-6) on Sunday at
noon EST. The Bears are seeded
9-12 and the Bulldogs are seeded
sixth.
Stanford has not faced the
Bulldogs this year, but has defeat
ed Cal twice, 6-1 at home and 4-3
in Berkeley.
Mississippi State tied for third
at National Team Indoors in
February, an event won by the
Cardinal. In that tournament, the
Bulldogs scored an impressive 4-3
victory over No. 3- ranked Pep
perdine (26-2), which is seeded
third in the NCAA champi
onships.
The Bulldogs are led by No. 8-
ranked Laurent Orsini, who is 14-
4 in dual matches at the No. 1
position.
Cal is led by No. 11-ranked

sophomore Michael Hill (26-11,
15-6 in dual matches). The
Aussie is an ITA / Penn National
Player to Watch candidate.
Junior Casey Louie (21-12, 13-7
in dual matches) is ranked No. 31
and this year received his first
ever bid to the NCAA singles
championships.
A win in the quarters would
likely result in a semifinal
matchup with either fourth-seed
ed UCLA (17-5) or No. 5-8-seeded
Texas (19-4) at noon EST Mon
day.
And it is too tempting not to
look ahead to the final round,
where a matchup with No. 2-seed
ed Georgia (25-1) would appear
probable on Tuesday at 4 p.m.
EST. The Bulldogs only loss of
the season came to Stanford in
the finals of the National Indoors,
but the home court will certainly
work to Georgia's advantage all
throughout this week.
The Cardinal won the 1978
national championship after
going undefeated for the only
other time in its regular season
history. Stanford also won cham
pionships in the four seasons in
which, like the 1995 season, it
swept both series with UCLA and
use.
But even with an undefeated
record, the Cardinal knows that it
will start with a clean slate tomor
row.
"Now we have to go out and
win four matches. If we lose, it's
sudden death. . . .Going undefeat
ed is not as important as winning
the last match of the season," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould,
who this week was named Pac-10
Coach of the Year.
Certainly on the minds of the
Cardinal returnees from last year
is the will to make up for last
year's 4-3 final round loss to USC.
But even the freshman, who
did not experience last year's
heartbreak, are finding it easy to
get up for the final stretch.
"It hasn't been hard to prepare
mentally," Goldstein said. "I've
heard a lot about Georgia. I'm
excited to get this thing going and
take it one match at a time."
Let the games begin.
