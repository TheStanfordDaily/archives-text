# Softball attempts to end on winning note

### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
In a tale of two teams headed
in opposite directions, the two
time defending National Colle
giate Athletic Association cham
pion and No. 1 ranked Arizona
Wildcats travel to El Camino
Field today for a 1 p.m. double
header against the struggling
Stanford softball team.
Arizona (57-4 overall, 20-4 in
the Pacific 10 Conference), which
has won 18 consecutive games
since getting swept in a double
header at home against UCLA on
April 8, faces a Stanford team
that, despite winning four of its
last six non-conference games,
has not won a Pac-10 game since
a 9-6 win at Oregon State on April
1.
Stanford (15-33, 1-23 in the
Pac-10) is coming off of its worst
offensive performance of the sea
son against No. 20 Washington.
In the opening game of a Husky
sweep, the Cardinal was no-hit 9-
0 by Washington fireballer
Stephanie Burns, the first no-hit
ter of the season tossed at Stan
ford. In game two, Husky ace Eve
Gaw limited the Cardinal to one
hit en route to a 10-0 victory. The
double shutout marked the first
time since February 12 and only
the second time all season that
Stanford has failed to score in a
doubleheader.

"We couldn't really get any
thing going," Stanford coach
Sandy Pearce said. "We hit the
ball hard at times, but the ball
went right to them. We've hit the
ball well in practice [the last cou
ple of days] so we should do much
better [this weekendl."
The scoring task will be at
least as difficult today against the
Wildcats. Arizona is led by sopho
more pitcher Cari Dolan, the lat
est in a long line of hurlers to
come out of perennial high school
powerhouse Los Alamitos (Cali
fornia). On the season, Dolan is
25-1. Against Stanford on April
14 in Tucson, she shut out the
Cardinal with a two-hitter over
five innings of work. Dolan did
not walk anyone.
"Overpowering," was the word
used by Pearce to describe Dolan.
"She threw hard, and her pitches
were two inches off the ground."
In the second game, Arizona
will send junior Nancy Evans to
the mound. In the last meeting
between the two teams, Evans
allowed one run on five hits and
three walks in seven innings.
"We hit the ball much better
[in the second game]," Pearce
said. "Arizona may have lapsed a
bit after the first game, but we
were in it until the [bottom of the
sixth]."
Stanford will rely on junior
