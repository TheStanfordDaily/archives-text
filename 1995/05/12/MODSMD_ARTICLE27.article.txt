# Softball attempts to end on winning note
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
In a tale of two teams headed
in opposite directions, the two
time defending National Colle
giate Athletic Association cham
pion and No. 1 ranked Arizona
Wildcats travel to El Camino
Field today for a 1 p.m. double
header against the struggling
Stanford softball team.
Arizona (57-4 overall, 20-4 in
the Pacific 10 Conference), which
has won 18 consecutive games
since getting swept in a double
header at home against UCLA on
April 8, faces a Stanford team
that, despite winning four of its
last six non-conference games,
has not won a Pac-10 game since
a 9-6 win at Oregon State on April
1.
Stanford (15-33, 1-23 in the
Pac-10) is coming off of its worst
offensive performance of the sea
son against No. 20 Washington.
In the opening game of a Husky
sweep, the Cardinal was no-hit 9-
0 by Washington fireballer
Stephanie Burns, the first no-hit
ter of the season tossed at Stan
ford. In game two, Husky ace Eve
Gaw limited the Cardinal to one
hit en route to a 10-0 victory. The
double shutout marked the first
time since February 12 and only
the second time all season that
Stanford has failed to score in a
doubleheader.

"We couldn't really get any
thing going," Stanford coach
Sandy Pearce said. "We hit the
ball hard at times, but the ball
went right to them. We've hit the
ball well in practice [the last cou
ple of days] so we should do much
better [this weekendl."
The scoring task will be at
least as difficult today against the
Wildcats. Arizona is led by sopho
more pitcher Cari Dolan, the lat
est in a long line of hurlers to
come out of perennial high school
powerhouse Los Alamitos (Cali
fornia). On the season, Dolan is
25-1. Against Stanford on April
14 in Tucson, she shut out the
Cardinal with a two-hitter over
five innings of work. Dolan did
not walk anyone.
"Overpowering," was the word
used by Pearce to describe Dolan.
"She threw hard, and her pitches
were two inches off the ground."
In the second game, Arizona
will send junior Nancy Evans to
the mound. In the last meeting
between the two teams, Evans
allowed one run on five hits and
three walks in seven innings.
"We hit the ball much better
[in the second game]," Pearce
said. "Arizona may have lapsed a
bit after the first game, but we
were in it until the [bottom of the
sixth]."
Stanford will rely on junior
shortstop Summer Lee, who has
maintained a batting average of
.400 or greater the entire season
and is fourth in the Pac-10 in hit
ting. In the third spot, Amanda
Renteria hopes to improve on her
.330 batting average and drive in
Lee as often as possible.
"We can score with [Lee and
Renteria] hitting well," Pearce said.
On the mound, the season-end

ing back injury to freshman sensa
tion Jessica Schulman has forced
sophomore pitcher Angela Webb to
pitch both games of the last 12 dou
bleheaders.
"Any time a batter can see you
that many times [over the course of
two games] it makes it tougher to
get them out," Pearce said. "Angela
had much more success against
them [in the second game] when
she started pitching them in on
their hands."
In the first game, however, Ari
zona's explosive offensive attack
showed why the Wildcats are the

highest-scoring team in the coun
try. Batting around twice in the
second inning alone, Arizona post
ed 15 runs in the inning en route to
a 25-0 pasting of Stanford. The
Wildcats collected 21 hits in 33 at
bats for the game.
As she has done all year, senior
Ail-American Amy Chellevold
sparked the Wildcats, collecting
four hits and five walks in the dou
bleheader. Chellevold reached base
every time she came to the plate
against the Cardinal. For the sea
son, she leads the nation in hitting
and leads the Pac-10 in stolen bases
and walks.
"That's why she's an Ail-Ameri
can," Pearce said. "She's just bril
liant."
When Chellevold reaches base,
that gives the hitters in the meat of
the Arizona lineup a chance to do
some damage. In the 25-0 game, U
of A third baseman Krista Gomez
had four hits, including three in the
big second inning, setting a school
record for most hits in one inning.
The inning was also highlighted by
successive home runs off the bats of
Chellevold, Julie Reitan and Jenny
Dal ton.
Speaking of home runs, that's
where Wildcat cleanup hitter
Laura Espinoza enters the picture.
Espinoza enters the weekend
series with a nation-leading 30
home runs. Dalton has 20, Amy
Braatz has 13, and the Wildcats
have 70 as a team. As a compari
son, the Stanford team has two
home runs.
"They're overpowering offen
sively," Pearce said. "They just got
on a hitting roll against us [last
time], and they've been doing that
all year against everybody."
Despite these impressive num
bers, the No. 1 Wildcats are not
invincible. Stanford played compet
itively against Arizona in the sec
ond game, dropping a 7-1 decision
after the Wildcats scored four times
in the bottom of the sixth.
"If they have a weakness,"
Pearce said, "it's that they some
times lapse like that. If we can jump
on them early, we can break their
rhythm and give ourselves a
chance."
On Saturday, the team con
cludes its regular season with a
rematch against Oregon State, the
only Pac-10 team the squad has
defeated, in a noon doubleheader at
home.
"It'll be nice to have a chance to
close the season with a couple of
wins," Pearce said. "We're looking
for a sweep to end the year."
