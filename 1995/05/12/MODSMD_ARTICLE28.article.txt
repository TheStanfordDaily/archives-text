With hopes of finishing first in
the West Coast Cycling Confer
ence (WCCC) for the first time in
10 years, the top-ranked Stanford
cycling team travels to Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo this weekend for
the conference championship
races. With most of its top riders
healthy, the squad goes into the
competition hoping to overtake
California who maintains a slim
lead over the Cardinal in the team
standings.
The race weekend consists of a
team time trial and a road race on
Saturday, which for some cyclists
will be 90 miles long, and a cri
terium on Sunday. The top five
teams and top five individuals at
the end of the weekend win invi

tations to the national competi
tion, which Stanford won last
year, in Reno, Nev.
"Although anything is possi
ble, I think that the big question
is not if we will qualify for nation
als, but whether we finish first or
second," said Stanford coach Art
Walker.
The team, in the words of grad
student Ma-Ne Rodriguez, is
"psyched" about the race and is
optimistic about its chances. "We
have a really good shot at the
title," said graduate student Dave
Bailey.
The weekend starts with the
team time trial, Stanford's
strongest event. The Cardinal has
won almost every team time trial
during the regular season.
