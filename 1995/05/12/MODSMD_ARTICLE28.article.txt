# Bicyclists competing for conference title
## 
### Rajen Sheth Contributing writer 
With hopes of finishing first in
the West Coast Cycling Confer
ence (WCCC) for the first time in
10 years, the top-ranked Stanford
cycling team travels to Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo this weekend for
the conference championship
races. With most of its top riders
healthy, the squad goes into the
competition hoping to overtake
California who maintains a slim
lead over the Cardinal in the team
standings.
The race weekend consists of a
team time trial and a road race on
Saturday, which for some cyclists
will be 90 miles long, and a cri
terium on Sunday. The top five
teams and top five individuals at
the end of the weekend win invi

tations to the national competi
tion, which Stanford won last
year, in Reno, Nev.
"Although anything is possi
ble, I think that the big question
is not if we will qualify for nation
als, but whether we finish first or
second," said Stanford coach Art
Walker.
The team, in the words of grad
student Ma-Ne Rodriguez, is
"psyched" about the race and is
optimistic about its chances. "We
have a really good shot at the
title," said graduate student Dave
Bailey.
The weekend starts with the
team time trial, Stanford's
strongest event. The Cardinal has
won almost every team time trial
during the regular season.
"Unless things go badly wrong,
we will win the time trial by
enough points to place us in the
lead over Cal," Walker said.
The time trial takes place at
Santa Margarita Lake on a fiat
14-mile track. Stanford's men's
and women's time trial teams fea
ture many top cyclists including
Bailey who set a course record
three weeks ago at Chico State.
The team hopes that the trial will
give them an early boost so that
they will need only to protect a
lead rather than catch up. Howev
er, Cal is rumored to be bringing
in pro-level women time trial rac
ers who happen to be taking time
off for school.
On the same day of the time
trial, the Cardinal will compete in
the road race which takes place on
a 30-mile loop also at Santa Mar
garita Lake. The men's A team
will circle the loop three times,
making the race one of the
longest of the season. The track
features a hilly region right at the
beginning.
"Who gets up that climb in
what group will be important for
the rest of the race," said grad
student Megan Troxell.
Finally, the schools travel to
the Cal Poly campus itself to race
in the criterium, which has been
Stanford's weakest event. The
riders will take between 28-50
laps around a 0.6 mile loop on city
roads with 5 turns. The team will
benefit from the return of

Rodriguez who finished second in
the Stanford criterium earlier
this season. The squad hopes to
take a lead into this event and try
to hold it.
While the course is a fairly dif
ficult one, the cyclists feel that it
will not be the toughest thing to
overcome. "I think this race will
be extremely difficult because of
the level of competition rather
than the weather or the course
difficulty," said freshman Scott
Upton.
Walker feels that the competi
tion they will face is stiffer than
in any other conference around
the country. "Our conference is
the strongest in the U.S., and the
sixth place team here would usu
ally finish 10th or 12th at nation
als," he said.
Stanford's top cyclists are
amongst the best in the nation,
but Walker believes that Cal has
an edge this weekend because of
their depth.
"Our chances of winning are
only fair," said Walker. "Berke
ley's advantage in regular season
points is small, but they are deep
in every category."
Stanford's depth problem is
intensified by the unexpected loss
of grad student Hue Rhodes and
sophomore Lukasz Zielinski, who
both race for the D team. Rhodes
suffered a concussion and a hip
iryury during a crash in practice,
and Zielinski broke his tibia when
he was hit by a car while running.
However, the team is hoping
for the best in this tough race.
"We have all worked so hard this
season," Upton said. "We can't
give up now."
