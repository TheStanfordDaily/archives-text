# Baseball needs a little help
## Three-game sweep of Arizona State and two USC losses necessary for Cardinal to win Pac-10 South 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Never count a team out.
Three games remain in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division for the 19th-ranked Stanford baseball
team and although the Cardinal is one game
behind USC, the squad still has a chance to win the
conference.
Since the Trojans won the season series against
Stanford (29-21 overall, 17-10 in the Six-Pac), four
games to two, the Cardinal needs to capture the
trio of games against 21st-ranked Arizona State
(34-18, 13-14 in the Six-Pac) and hope for two loss
es from USC. Odds are against Stanford as the
Cardinal never has swept in Tempe and the Tro
jans are playing the last-place team in the confer
ence, Arizona.
However, odder things have happened in base
ball. Atlanta captured the National League West
division on the next-to-last day of the season in
1991 after the San Francisco Giants defeated Los
Angeles. The Braves won the division for the third
consecutive time in 1993 by erasing a nine-game

deficit, clinching the title on the last day of the sea
son after the Dodgers exacted revenge by beating
the Giants.
"All six games are big," junior catcher A.J.
Hinch said, alluding to the season-ending three
game series against UC-Santa Barbara. "We're
trying to make a rush into postseason."
Stanford, ranked No. 1 by numerous publica
tions in the preseason, most likely will be selected
for the NCAA Regionals but with a record only
eight games above .500, the Cardinal's seed in the
tournament will hinge on the team's performance.
"We're pretty confident," Hinch said. "The goal
of the season is to make it into the regionals. Ari
zona State is going to be fighting for their season
as well."
During the first matchup between the two
teams this season, Stanford captured the last two
games after losing the first, 8-5. On the other
hand, the Sun Devils will be facing a markedly dif
ferent pitching staff than the one it faced in the
first series.
