# Baseball needs a little help
## Three-game sweep of Arizona State and two USC losses necessary for Cardinal to win Pac-10 South 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Never count a team out.
Three games remain in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division for the 19th-ranked Stanford baseball
team and although the Cardinal is one game
behind USC, the squad still has a chance to win the
conference.
Since the Trojans won the season series against
Stanford (29-21 overall, 17-10 in the Six-Pac), four
games to two, the Cardinal needs to capture the
trio of games against 21st-ranked Arizona State
(34-18, 13-14 in the Six-Pac) and hope for two loss
es from USC. Odds are against Stanford as the
Cardinal never has swept in Tempe and the Tro
jans are playing the last-place team in the confer
ence, Arizona.
However, odder things have happened in base
ball. Atlanta captured the National League West
division on the next-to-last day of the season in
1991 after the San Francisco Giants defeated Los
Angeles. The Braves won the division for the third
consecutive time in 1993 by erasing a nine-game

deficit, clinching the title on the last day of the sea
son after the Dodgers exacted revenge by beating
the Giants.
"All six games are big," junior catcher A.J.
Hinch said, alluding to the season-ending three
game series against UC-Santa Barbara. "We're
trying to make a rush into postseason."
Stanford, ranked No. 1 by numerous publica
tions in the preseason, most likely will be selected
for the NCAA Regionals but with a record only
eight games above .500, the Cardinal's seed in the
tournament will hinge on the team's performance.
"We're pretty confident," Hinch said. "The goal
of the season is to make it into the regionals. Ari
zona State is going to be fighting for their season
as well."
During the first matchup between the two
teams this season, Stanford captured the last two
games after losing the first, 8-5. On the other
hand, the Sun Devils will be facing a markedly dif
ferent pitching staff than the one it faced in the
first series.

first series.
Junior Dan Reed and sopho
more Jason Middlebrook were the
starters in game one and two. Both
pitchers will not start as juniors
Todd Bartels and Mike Robbins
will get the call.
Bartels, 1-0 with a 1.93 ERA in
his last two starts, will attempt to
post his third quality start in a row
tonight. Bartels has turned his sea
son around after starting out very
slowly with an ERA over eight.
Freshman Kyle Peterson gets
the nod for Saturday's game. The
big right-hander, a probable Six-
Pac Pitcher of the Year and NCAA
Freshman of the Year candidate,
has been stellar in league play.
Peterson is 7-0 with an ERA of

2.20 against Six-Pac opponents
and he has held opposing batters to
a .216 batting average.
Robbins will start on Sunday.
The left-hander has done every
thing for the Cardinal, starting
eight games and relieving in nine
others. Robbins also has two saves
to go with his 5-3 record and 3.27
ERA.
The Sun Devils will bring Bill
Neal, Kaipo Spenser and Jason
Bond to the mound. Neal, a right
hander, has a 5-7 record and a 4.65
ERA and Bond stands a 3-1 with a
5.54 ERA. Spenser, however, is
the ace of the staff. The sopho
more right-hander has a 8-4
record and 2.78 ERA but also has
struck out 106 in 100 and a third
innings. He can be prone to wild
ness as he has walked 52 so far this
season.
The ASU batters are built for
Packard Stadium. The squad is

batting .306 on the season with
113 doubles and 25 triples and the
big stadium is conducive to extra
base hits.
The Sun Devils are led by lead
off batter Randy Betten, the ASU
right fielder, who sports a .416 on
base average and 26 steals. The
third batter in the lineup, second
baseman Robbie Kent, has also
had a solid season, batting .335
with seven home runs and 10
stolen bases on the year.
If the Cardinal can contain
ASU's offense, which averages 7.3
runs every game, then Stanford
stands a good chance of putting
pressure on USC to deliver. Even if
the Cardinal fails to capture the
division title, the team will be in
good position for a run in the post
season.
"We can't put anymore pres
sure on ourselves than the [situa
tion] already is," Hinch said.
