# A 						final chance
## Tracksters try to qualify for Pac-10s at last-chance meet 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field
team comes off the emotional
high of last Saturday's Big Meet
to take care of some post-season
business.
Today and tomorrow are the
final days to reach qualifying
marks for next week's Pacific 10
Conference Championships in
Tucson, Ariz. The 1995 Cardinal
Track and Field Meet starts off at
1 p.m. with the 1,500-meters. In
addition to an open list of events,
there will be an elite field events
competition starting at 2 p.m. and
an elite running events competi
tion starting at 4:15 p.m.
Three athletes left for Tucson,
Ariz, yesterday for the start of the
decathlon and heptathlon compe
tition. Sophomore Renee Pavelski
competes today in the heptathlon
five months after her last compe
tition while last year's Pac-10
decathlon champion senior Travis
Clark and freshman Josh Gleason
start the two-day 10-event contest
one month after their last
decathlon. In the championships
last year, Clark gave Stanford an
early 10-point lead, but this year
he will be challenged by Oregon's
Pac-10 leading Ray Livingston
and Kanon VanderhofT.
Announced only a few weeks
ago, the Cardinal Meet offers a
last chance to reach qualifying
times and distances for postsea
son competition. A handful of ath
letes from several different col
leges, including Arkansas, Texas
and California as well as some
local club runners are scheduled
to compete. This is a controlled
meet designed to produce qualify
ing performances.
"There's nothing left to
chance. It's set up to maximize
performances for us to run as fast
as we can," said junior Joe Karl
gaard, one of six entrants in the
elite 800-meters.
Karlgaard and senior Dan
McGinn hope to use a fast field to
meet the Pac-10 qualifying time
of 1:51.44. Olympian and former
Stanford runner, Jeff Atkinson,
who can be found hosting
Sportschannel's coverage of local
track and field, is scheduled to
Atkinson, who can be found
hosting Sportschannel's cover
age of local track and field, is
scheduled to run in the 800-

meters with several other ath
letes from various colleges.
The combination of small
heats, elite athletes and the
afternoon starting times should
produce peak performances.
"It's going to be ideal," said
Karlgaard. "All the variables
will be in place."

On the women's side, several
athletes will try their hand at
reaching needed times. Junior
Monica Hoggatt and sophomore
Tyra Holt will be the runners to
watch in the 200-meters. Holt is
nursing a sore ankle, so she
won't be able to join junior Jen
nifer Dalton in the pole vault
competition at 4 p.m. Neither
the Pac-10 nor the NCAA yet
recognizes the women's pole
vault as a collegiate scored
event. Holt and Dalton are
among the top-five in the
nation in the event, but will not
see national competition until
the U.S. nationals in Sacramen
to on June 16.
If today's meet does not pro
vide the needed times to quali
fy, the final opportunity is
tomorrow's Modesto Relays.
Senior Branyon Davis will run
the 100 and 200 meters in
search of Pac-10 qualifying
times. He is only a few hun
dredths of a second from the
needed times in both events.
With sophomore Pete Swanson
lost for the season to a broken
toe, the Cardinal throwers will
head for the favorable winds of
Modesto in search of Pac-10
qualifying distances.
Otherwise, few runners will
head to Modesto unless they
cannot meet the necessary
times at today's Cardinal Meet.
"It's kind of low-key, but
there should be some very good
performances [at the Cardinal
Meet]," said Holt.

Long Jumper Brian Manning prepares to land. This weekend Is the
last shot that many athletes will have to make the Pac-10 cut.
