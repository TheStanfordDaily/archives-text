						final chance
## Tracksters try to qualify for Pac-10s at last-chance meet 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field
team comes off the emotional
high of last Saturday's Big Meet
to take care of some post-season
business.
Today and tomorrow are the
final days to reach qualifying
marks for next week's Pacific 10
Conference Championships in
Tucson, Ariz. The 1995 Cardinal
Track and Field Meet starts off at
1 p.m. with the 1,500-meters. In
addition to an open list of events,
there will be an elite field events
competition starting at 2 p.m. and
an elite running events competi
tion starting at 4:15 p.m.
Three athletes left for Tucson,
Ariz, yesterday for the start of the
decathlon and heptathlon compe

competes today in the heptathlon
five months after her last compe

decathlon champion senior Travis
Clark and freshman Josh Gleason
start the two-day 10-event contest
one month after their last
decathlon. In the championships
last year, Clark gave Stanford an
early 10-point lead, but this year
he will be challenged by Oregon's
Pac-10 leading Ray Livingston
and Kanon VanderhofT.
Announced only a few weeks

letes from several different col
leges, including Arkansas, Texas
and California as well as some
local club runners are scheduled
to compete. This is a controlled
meet designed to produce qualify
ing performances.
"There's nothing left to
chance. It's set up to maximize
performances for us to run as fast
as we can," said junior Joe Karl
gaard, one of six entrants in the
elite 800-meters.
Karlgaard and senior Dan
McGinn hope to use a fast field to
meet the Pac-10 qualifying time
of 1:51.44. Olympian and former
Stanford runner, Jeff Atkinson,
who can be found hosting
Sportschannel's coverage of local
track and field, is scheduled to
