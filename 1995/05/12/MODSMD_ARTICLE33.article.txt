# 24th annual Powwow this weekend
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
With only a few hours left
before 30,000 guests descend on
the University, organizers are
rushing to put the final touches on
the 24th Annual Stanford Pow
wow taking place at the intramural
fields this weekend.
The Powwow is one of the
biggest Native American cultural
festivals in the nation, said Pow
wow publicity coordinator Kimball
Sekaquaptewa, a junior.
"The Powwow has developed so
much from its early days," said
Sekaquaptewa. "It was developed
out of a need for solidarity and sup
port within the urban Indian com
munity. We've grown since its
beginnings in the '70s from having
one drum group and a few dancers
to today, where we have scheduled
over 10 drum groups and hun
dreds of dancers," she said.
Organizers chose to honor
Native American youth by making
them the central theme of this
year's festival, said Powwow tri
coordinator Chaskae McCabe, a

sophomore.
"I'm really excited. This is our
way of recognizing the good work
that [Native American 1 students
do. Too often, media misrepresen
tations overshadow their accom
plishments," McCabe said.
In addition to recognizing the
achievements of Native American
youth, this year's Powwow seeks
to promote cultural pride and to
educate people on the rich Native
American heritage.
Along with native dance and
drum performances, Powwow
organizers have set up more than
90 arts and crafts booths along
with 30 food booths.
"All the vendors that will be
there have gone through an appli
cation process," said Powwow tri
coordinator Jaeleen Kookesh, a
senior. "We scrutinized and exam
ined their merchandise before we
approved their application."
Kookesh said the reason for
screening vendors was to ensure
the quality and integrity of the
goods sold at the event.
According to Sekaquaptewa,
this year's Powwow will cost about

$80,000 to stage. While the Stan
ford American Indian Organiza
tion contributes a large amount,
student planners are left to raise
more than 90 percent of the funds.
"The Powwow is organized in
large part by the students," said
Sekaquaptewa. "We received a
major grant this year of $17,000
from Hewlett-Packard. Also, we
receive financial support from var
ious corporations, departments
and members of the Indian com
munity on campus."
McCabe also praised the sup
port given to Powwow organizers
by other Stanford groups.
"A lot of our work is done by
volunteers and there were a lot of
people outside of the [Native
American] community helping us
out," McCabe said. He added that
the Black Student Union, the
Asian-American Student Associa
tion and the Chicano / Latino stu
dent group MEChA all contributed
funds for the event.
The Powwow starts tonight and
continues until Sunday evening.
Admission is free and open to the
public.
