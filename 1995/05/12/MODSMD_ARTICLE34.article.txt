Stanford's Creative Writing Program recently
announced the 10 recipients of the Stegner Fellow
ships in fiction and poetry for 1995-1997.
"The fellowships give writers the time and finan
cial support they need to focus on their writing,"
said Sheila Donohue, a lecturer in the English
Department and a former Stegner Fellow who was
on the selection committee this year.
The new Stegner Fellows are Ann Choi, Nancy
Cohen, Kent Dixon, Rick Hilles, Lisa Rosenberg,
Bay Anapol, Stacy D'Erasmo, Steve Lattimore,
Peter Rock and Keith Scribner.
Rosenberg said her Stegner Fellowship will give
her more time to work on her writing. "I work full
time as an engineer so I have virtually no time to
write," she said.
"I still can't believe that I got it," Rosenberg said.
"I'm really looking forward to being in an art com
munity again."
She added that she plans to complete a book dur
ing her time as a fellow, as well as expand her "stylis
tic breadth."
"I am grateful for the opportunity to produce
some good work," Choi said. "Right now I am still
working on inspiration and I hope this time at Stan
ford will help me develop and clarify my ideas."

Choi added that she is currently working on her
first collection of poems, to be titled "Keeper of
Bones."
Started in 1956, the Stegner Fellowship is named
after the late Pulitzer Prize-winning author Wallace "J,
Stegner, a former Stanford English professor.
In January, applicants for the fellowship submit a
writing sample and statement of what they will be
working on during their time at Stanford.
According to Donohue, competition for the fel
lowships is fierce — about 600 students applied for
the five fiction fellowships and 300 for the five poet
ry fellowships this year.
A unique feature of the fellowship is that the
applicants are not required to have published works
or even have completed an undergraduate degree, t
though such applicants are rare. "The selection com
mittee is interested in the writing sample only," said
Donohue. Z
The fellows attend two writing workshops each
week run by faculty of the Creative Writing Pro
gram. Fellows are not otherwise required to take any
classes although they may audit classes if they J
choose.
Under the terms of the fellowship, fellows are
provided with a stipend of $13,000 a year for two •
years to cover living expenses. The fellowship also
covers tuition.
