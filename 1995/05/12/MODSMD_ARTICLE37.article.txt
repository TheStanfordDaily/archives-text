# No one at Stanford has urges...yeah right

OK. Here's the pitch:
The Stanford Brothel.
Hold up. Calm down. It's not that bad em
idea. It's something we can use. It's some
thing you might need.
Nothing huge. We pick up a nice, small
handful off the Nevada streets, bring 'em
over, clean 'em up, give 'em the Cowell once
over and let 'em work. Simple. Condoms and
regular check-ups a must. They can even sit in
on classes.
The Stanford Brothel: Fully sanctioned and
risk minimized. Organized as an Econ honors
project. Consulting by Biz students (pro
bono). And the whole thing will be managed,
of course, by the Dean of Student Affairs.
The Stanford Brothel: Performing a grand
service for all students, male and female alike.
And at competitive rates.
"Immoral!" you say? Then I ask you, which
ranks higher on the fire 'n' brimstone scale:
going to a party, getting too drunk and going
too far with someone who wouldn't give their
last stick of Wrigley's Doublemint to save your
ass from oblivion and who you may even see in
a class one day; or an unabashed trek to our
happy humpy house for a quick, efficient and
expertly executed romp?
"No one will use it!" you say? Let me
remind you that while you're worried people'll
be embarrassed being seen poking around the
best little whorehouse on the Row, people
walk — in clear daylight — into the Bridge
every day. And at the Bridge they talk out
their problems with peers no less, making
their brand of anonymity no more sincere
than when you promise a frosh-dorm-friend
you'll go out for coffee sometime soon. But at
our family restaurant, honest and absolute
confidentiality goes without saying.

Besides, all we need is one Psych study that
says patrons of our fine establishment have
GPAs .3 points higher than others and we'll
have to start taking reservations.
Let's be honest: We all know someone who
would wholly benefit from a good yank, right?
Too nervous, too uptight, too many units.
Whatever. Well now all you'd have to do is
stick a G-note in his or her pocket and send
them off on a merry expedition.
And don't be afraid, dear, to consider a lit
tle something for yourself.
Embarrassed about that awful case of vir
ginity? No problem — we'll be gentle. Trouble
studying? Can't focus on that thesis? Go blow
off some steam. All the frolic with none of the
relationship murk to muss up your too-tight
mid-term schedule.
Think of the therapeutic potential our hus
tler haven would wield. The hands on
approach to sexual dysfunction .. . dorm pro
grams on how to be a better lover. ..
The Stanford Brothel-. We'd beat out the
massage workshops in a week. And in the
same simple stroke we can obliterate both the
"Stanford is trying to become a more conser
vative institution" conspiracy and the ridicu
lous "no-nookie" myth.
Cross this line, baby.
And think of what we can do for our gra
cious employees. We'd be taking a willing
group — presently at a high risk for violence
— off the street and giving them a chance at a
comfortable life and an immaculate clientele.
The pay will be good, the hours flexible (except
during the Dead Week pile-up), and we'll even
throw in health and dental for good measure.
After four years or so we hand 'em an hon
orary degree (heaven knows they'll have
earned it) and send them off with a second

chance ard some damn fine connections.
All it'll take is a few weeks to pay off
expenses — the rest is pure profit. We'll start
off smaL — payrolling just two gals and a guy
— and experiment with the market. If it goes
well we expand.
And once we get permission to use meal
cards as payment, there'll be nothing but prof
it and passion coming our way. All those end
of-the-quarter points will finally be put to
some use. Who needs six cases of canned cap
puccino when you could spend that same hun
dred 'n' fifty on doing your impression of a
Pixie Stick?
The Stanford Brothel: Puttin' your pootie
on points.
And just wait 'til the merchandising comes.
Sweatshirts. Fraternity discounts. Sporting
events. Memberships to the Sex Man Club.
Gift certificates from the Mother's Club sent
in your midterms care package. Oh, what a
grand day it would be when your own mother
can send you a Bootiegram.
And who wouldn't be tempted by those dis
count coupons in the Guide to the Good Life?
No matter what your need, there it'll be.
Dependable, accessible and a good cardiovas
cular workout, serving all ages and all sexes
and all preferences — just show us your SUID
and fill out that check.
The Stanford Brothel: Die Luft der Freiheit
weht.
