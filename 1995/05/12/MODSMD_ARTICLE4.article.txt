# Science core not law but a theory
## Questions if track is needed, feasible 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Making Stanford's science re
quirements more interesting and
challenging would be a welcome
change, faculty members and stu
dents say.
But some suggest the current
system, which is in line with the
policies of many other uni
versities, does not need the mqjor
overhaul a new science core would
bring.
The Mathematics-Science-En
gineering Core committee is cur
rently collecting proposals for
tracks in the core, a year-long se
quence of courses through which
students could fulfill the mathe
matics, natural sciences, and tech
nology and applied science distrib
ution requirements (Areas 4,5 and
6).

By integrating
these three areas,
designers of the
science core —
which the Com
mission on Un
dergraduate Ed
ucation proposed
in its report re
leased last Octo
ber — aim to im-

prove science education at Stan
ford so students graduate with a
basic understanding of and, ideally,
an interest in science.
The commission recommended
changes to the science core because
"we became convinced that these
three areas were the weakest link
in the current system, the ones that
students were most likely to view
cynically and to try to fulfill as ef
fortlessly as possible," according to
its report.
Some faculty members say,
however, that a closer look at sta
tistics disproves this point.

Furthermore, the costs in time
and money of starting up and main
taining such a program are high,
and some argue that resources in
Stanford's science, engineering
and mathematics departments
may be spent in better ways.
A necessity?

Discussion of
the science core
proposal has fo
cused on "that one
paragraph [in the
commission's re
port] about how
the current sci
ence system isn't
working," said
Computer Science

Prof. Eric Roberts. "It was what
provided the sense of need."
While Roberts said parts of the
current system may not be working
well, he added that the current sys
tem has some strength.
Members of the commission and
the science core committee have ar
gued that students fulfill math and
science DRs with courses that
aren't designed to count toward a
science nuyor and don't provide
students with the intellectual chal
lenge they should find in a science
course.
"The courses available to fulfill
the science requirements seemed
to us to have some problems," said
History Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the commission. "Many of
them were very good courses but
they didn't quite fulfill the goal of
teaching non-scientists the mean
ing and purpose of science."
But statistics compiled indepen
dently by Roberts and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Tony Siegman, a
member of the science core com
mittee, show that many non-sci
