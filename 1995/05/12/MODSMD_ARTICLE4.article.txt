# Science core not law but a theory
## Questions if track is needed, feasible 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Making Stanford's science re
quirements more interesting and
challenging would be a welcome
change, faculty members and stu
dents say.
But some suggest the current
system, which is in line with the
policies of many other uni
versities, does not need the mqjor
overhaul a new science core would
bring.
The Mathematics-Science-En
gineering Core committee is cur
rently collecting proposals for
tracks in the core, a year-long se
quence of courses through which
students could fulfill the mathe
matics, natural sciences, and tech
nology and applied science distrib
ution requirements (Areas 4,5 and
6).

By integrating
these three areas,
designers of the
science core —
which the Com
mission on Un
dergraduate Ed
ucation proposed
in its report re
leased last Octo
ber — aim to im-

prove science education at Stan
ford so students graduate with a
basic understanding of and, ideally,
an interest in science.
The commission recommended
changes to the science core because
"we became convinced that these
three areas were the weakest link
in the current system, the ones that
students were most likely to view
cynically and to try to fulfill as ef
fortlessly as possible," according to
its report.
Some faculty members say,
however, that a closer look at sta
tistics disproves this point.

Furthermore, the costs in time
and money of starting up and main
taining such a program are high,
and some argue that resources in
Stanford's science, engineering
and mathematics departments
may be spent in better ways.
A necessity?

Discussion of
the science core
proposal has fo
cused on "that one
paragraph [in the
commission's re
port] about how
the current sci
ence system isn't
working," said
Computer Science

Prof. Eric Roberts. "It was what
provided the sense of need."
While Roberts said parts of the
current system may not be working
well, he added that the current sys
tem has some strength.
Members of the commission and
the science core committee have ar
gued that students fulfill math and
science DRs with courses that
aren't designed to count toward a
science nuyor and don't provide
students with the intellectual chal
lenge they should find in a science
course.
"The courses available to fulfill
the science requirements seemed
to us to have some problems," said
History Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the commission. "Many of
them were very good courses but
they didn't quite fulfill the goal of
teaching non-scientists the mean
ing and purpose of science."
But statistics compiled indepen
dently by Roberts and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Tony Siegman, a
member of the science core com
mittee, show that many non-sci

ence majors do fulfill the DRs
with "hard" science courses.
According to Siegman's statis
tics, of 860 students who entered
Stanford in the 1991-92 year and
are not majoring in science, 65
percent fulfilled the mathematics
requirement with a calculus class,
33 percent fulfilled the natural
science requirement with a chem
istry class and 34 percent fulfilled
the technology and applied sci
ence requirement with Computer
Science 105 A or 106 A.
"I wonder if there is a great
market for this kind of [core]
course, considering the fact that
students seem to be signing up for
difficult courses in the sciences
that serve their particular needs,"
said History Prof. George
Fredrickson, a Faculty Senate
member.
M lt appears [the present sys
tem] is working," Fredrickson
said. "There don't seem to be a
large number of students who are
taking an easy science course to
fulfill the requirement."
The commission didn't look at
individual courses while examin
ing the science DRs, Sheehan
said, but it did "talk to lots and
lots of students."
One student, senior physics
and international relations major
David Hoffman, said that regard
less of how students fulfill the
major they are getting the science
education they are interested in
and more in-depth study should
not be forced.
"I don't think a physics major
should come out being a poet lau
reate," Hoffman said. "Similarly,
I don't think an English major
needs to come out knowing quan
tum mechanics."
The competition
If implemented, Stanford's sci
ence core will approach the sci
ence instruction in a different
manner than other leading uni
versities, which have programs
closer to Stanford's current sys
tem of requirements.
UC-Berkeley, Harvard Univer

sity and Princeton University all
require students to take two one
semester courses in different
areas of science. USC requires
three courses spanning two areas
of study.
At the University of Chicago,
which has a broader system of
DRs than Stanford, students
spend more time on science
requirements, taking a year-long
sequence in each of physical and
biological sciences.
But other schools have not
tried the approach of integrating
science, engineering and mathe
matics in one sequence.
At most schools, different
courses are offered to science
majors and non-science majors,
although courses for majors are
open to all students.
Rather than requiring stu
dents to take the more challeng
ing departmental courses, "the
trick is to design good courses for
non-science majors," said Eva
Gossman, associate dean of the
undergraduate college at Prince
ton.
"I'm not sure that the first
sequence of chemistry for
Imajors] is better for students
than [a course] which is designed
for non-science majors," she said.
At USC, opinion is swinging
the opposite direction than at
Stanford, said Associate Director
for Advisement Kazi Mamun.
"Professors are saying that
people who are English majors
don't necessarily need to know
science as much as they need to
know the history of science,"
Mamun said. "They don't need to
learn the fundamentals but the
philosophy of science."
Time and money
With questions about the need
for a new system, faculty mem
bers want to know if the
resources are available for a sci
ence core and if resources would
be best spent on courses aimed at
non-scientists.
Designing the interdisciplinary
tracks — which will have a small
er student-to-teacher ratio than
most of the introductory courses
offered now — will take time and
money, an issue that must be dis
cussed in an "age of limited

resources," Chemistry Prof.
Michael Fayer said.
"We want to try to teach non
scientists about science in the
best way we possibly can, but
since there are limited resources
. .. we always have to worry if we
divert resources what impact it's
going to have on other students."
Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood, chair of the Mathemat
ics-Science-Engineering Core
committee, said the committee
hopes to get three tracks devel
oped to be tested during the 1996-
97 academic year.
Nine faculty members might
have to work on the three tracks,
Fayer said. But currently his
department doesn't have a profes
sor to spare.
The Chemistry Department
already has already begun hiring
people from local industries to
teach some courses the depart
ment recently lost a professor
because of a tight budget, Fayer
said.
"We've been told that if we
agree to teach in the science core,
we may be able to hire another
faculty member," Fayer said,
"but that other faculty member
won't help us teach the students
in the existing classes. Already
there's been a decision made that
it's less important to have main
line faculty teach science students
and premed students than teach
in the science core."
The committee is currently
working on raising funds for the
core from outside sources, Osgood
said. No formal commitments
have been made by the University
administration, he added.
Keeping it going
Once developed, the science
core may not be easy to maintain,
professors warn.
"Every time we set up an
umbrella program like this ... it
usually starts out with a burst of
faculty enthusiasm," said Statis
tics Prof. Bradley Efron. "The
faculty enthusiasm wanes after a
few years since [the programs]
aren't ensconced in depart
ments."
A variety of circumstances can
contribute to the end of a pro
gram after a few years, Physics

Prof. Sandy Fetter said.
For example, Values, Technol
ogy, Science in Society — a three
course science sequence offered
for five years in the 1980s — fell
prey to faculty burnout, he said
The interdisciplinary course —
first taught by Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. Jim Adams, Mathe
matics Prof. Emeritus Bob Osser
man and Fetter — was designed
to fulfill the three science DRs,
said Adams.
VTSS has now become the Sci
ence, Technology and Society pro
gram, but courses within the
major are not tracked in an inte
grated sequence like VTSS.
Adams said he organized VTSS
to "talk about math, science and
technology because they're very
difficult to treat separately."
"It's arbitrary to separate
them," he said.
But "the difficulty is providing
the right faculty and the proper
numbers for a long period of
time," Adams said. The new sci
ence core "is going to need some
resources and a reasonably large
number of faculty who are
involved in it. You just can't teach
a course like this forever."
In the VTSS course, Adams,
Osserman and Fetter all attended
most of the lectures, Fetter said.
At different points during the
year, topics would focus on one,
two or three of the primary inter
est areas of the professors.
"After five years, we basically
felt we had served our time and
we moved on," Fetter said. To
sustain the course, "ultimately, it
has to have departmental basis
and clear University support."
"It's hard to create new cours
es that will have a lasting exis
tence," Sheehan said. "The trick
is to have them institutionalized,
to make them part of the Univer
sity. I think the departments'
participation is essential."
But "my guess is that the
departments alone will not be
enough," Sheehan added. "We'll
have to find ways of coordinating
and sustaining their activities."
One option may be having a sci
ence director who fills a position
similar to that of the director of
the program in Writing and Criti
cal Thinking, Efron suggested.

tence," Sheehan said. "The trick
is to have them institutionalized,
to make them part of the Univer
sity. I think the departments'
participation is essential."
But "my guess is that the
departments alone will not be
enough," Sheehan added. "We'll
have to find ways of coordinating
and sustaining their activities."
One option may be having a sci
ence director who fills a position
similar to that of the director of
the program in Writing and Criti
cal Thinking, Efron suggested.
Making Stanford's science re
quirements more interesting and
challenging would be a welcome
change, faculty members and stu
dents say.
But some suggest the current
system, which is in line with the
policies of many other uni
versities, does not need the mqjor
overhaul a new science core would
bring.
The Mathematics-Science-En
gineering Core committee is cur
rently collecting proposals for
tracks in the core, a year-long se
quence of courses through which
students could fulfill the mathe
matics, natural sciences, and tech
nology and applied science distrib
ution requirements (Areas 4,5 and
6).

By integrating
these three areas,
designers of the
science core —
which the Com
mission on Un
dergraduate Ed
ucation proposed
in its report re
leased last Octo
ber — aim to im-

prove science education at Stan
ford so students graduate with a
basic understanding of and, ideally,
an interest in science.
The commission recommended
changes to the science core because
"we became convinced that these
three areas were the weakest link
in the current system, the ones that
students were most likely to view
cynically and to try to fulfill as ef
fortlessly as possible," according to
its report.
Some faculty members say,
however, that a closer look at sta
tistics disproves this point.

Furthermore, the costs in time
and money of starting up and main
taining such a program are high,
and some argue that resources in
Stanford's science, engineering
and mathematics departments
may be spent in better ways.
A necessity?

Discussion of
the science core
proposal has fo
cused on "that one
paragraph [in the
commission's re
port] about how
the current sci
ence system isn't
working," said
Computer Science

Prof. Eric Roberts. "It was what
provided the sense of need."
While Roberts said parts of the
current system may not be working
well, he added that the current sys
tem has some strength.
Members of the commission and
the science core committee have ar
gued that students fulfill math and
science DRs with courses that
aren't designed to count toward a
science nuyor and don't provide
students with the intellectual chal
lenge they should find in a science
course.
"The courses available to fulfill
the science requirements seemed
to us to have some problems," said
History Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the commission. "Many of
them were very good courses but
they didn't quite fulfill the goal of
teaching non-scientists the mean
ing and purpose of science."
But statistics compiled indepen
dently by Roberts and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Tony Siegman, a
member of the science core com
mittee, show that many non-sci

Osgood
ence majors do fulfill the DRs
with "hard" science courses.
According to Siegman's statis
tics, of 860 students who entered
Stanford in the 1991-92 year and
are not majoring in science, 65
percent fulfilled the mathematics
requirement with a calculus class,
33 percent fulfilled the natural
science requirement with a chem
istry class and 34 percent fulfilled
the technology and applied sci
ence requirement with Computer
Science 105 A or 106 A.
"I wonder if there is a great
market for this kind of [core]
course, considering the fact that
students seem to be signing up for
difficult courses in the sciences
that serve their particular needs,"
said History Prof. George
Fredrickson, a Faculty Senate
member.
M lt appears [the present sys
tem] is working," Fredrickson
said. "There don't seem to be a
large number of students who are
taking an easy science course to
fulfill the requirement."
The commission didn't look at
individual courses while examin
ing the science DRs, Sheehan
said, but it did "talk to lots and
lots of students."
One student, senior physics
and international relations major
David Hoffman, said that regard
less of how students fulfill the
major they are getting the science
education they are interested in
and more in-depth study should
not be forced.
"I don't think a physics major
should come out being a poet lau
reate," Hoffman said. "Similarly,
I don't think an English major
needs to come out knowing quan
tum mechanics."
The competition
If implemented, Stanford's sci
ence core will approach the sci
ence instruction in a different
manner than other leading uni
versities, which have programs
closer to Stanford's current sys
tem of requirements.
UC-Berkeley, Harvard Univer

sity and Princeton University all
require students to take two one
semester courses in different
areas of science. USC requires
three courses spanning two areas
of study.
At the University of Chicago,
which has a broader system of
DRs than Stanford, students
spend more time on science
requirements, taking a year-long
sequence in each of physical and
biological sciences.
But other schools have not
tried the approach of integrating
science, engineering and mathe
matics in one sequence.
At most schools, different
courses are offered to science
majors and non-science majors,
although courses for majors are
open to all students.
Rather than requiring stu
dents to take the more challeng
ing departmental courses, "the
trick is to design good courses for
non-science majors," said Eva
Gossman, associate dean of the
undergraduate college at Prince
ton.
"I'm not sure that the first
sequence of chemistry for
Imajors] is better for students
than [a course] which is designed
for non-science majors," she said.
At USC, opinion is swinging
the opposite direction than at
Stanford, said Associate Director
for Advisement Kazi Mamun.
"Professors are saying that
people who are English majors
don't necessarily need to know
science as much as they need to
know the history of science,"
Mamun said. "They don't need to
learn the fundamentals but the
philosophy of science."
Time and money
With questions about the need
for a new system, faculty mem
bers want to know if the
resources are available for a sci
ence core and if resources would
be best spent on courses aimed at
non-scientists.
Designing the interdisciplinary
tracks — which will have a small
er student-to-teacher ratio than
most of the introductory courses
offered now — will take time and
money, an issue that must be dis
cussed in an "age of limited

resources," Chemistry Prof.
Michael Fayer said.
"We want to try to teach non
scientists about science in the
best way we possibly can, but
since there are limited resources
. .. we always have to worry if we
divert resources what impact it's
going to have on other students."
Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood, chair of the Mathemat
ics-Science-Engineering Core
committee, said the committee
hopes to get three tracks devel
oped to be tested during the 1996-
97 academic year.
Nine faculty members might
have to work on the three tracks,
Fayer said. But currently his
department doesn't have a profes
sor to spare.
The Chemistry Department
already has already begun hiring
people from local industries to
teach some courses the depart
ment recently lost a professor
because of a tight budget, Fayer
said.
"We've been told that if we
agree to teach in the science core,
we may be able to hire another
faculty member," Fayer said,
"but that other faculty member
won't help us teach the students
in the existing classes. Already
there's been a decision made that
it's less important to have main
line faculty teach science students
and premed students than teach
in the science core."
The committee is currently
working on raising funds for the
core from outside sources, Osgood
said. No formal commitments
have been made by the University
administration, he added.
Keeping it going
Once developed, the science
core may not be easy to maintain,
professors warn.
"Every time we set up an
umbrella program like this ... it
usually starts out with a burst of
faculty enthusiasm," said Statis
tics Prof. Bradley Efron. "The
faculty enthusiasm wanes after a
few years since [the programs]
aren't ensconced in depart
ments."
A variety of circumstances can
contribute to the end of a pro
gram after a few years, Physics

Prof. Sandy Fetter said.
For example, Values, Technol
ogy, Science in Society — a three
course science sequence offered
for five years in the 1980s — fell
prey to faculty burnout, he said
The interdisciplinary course —
first taught by Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. Jim Adams, Mathe
matics Prof. Emeritus Bob Osser
man and Fetter — was designed
to fulfill the three science DRs,
said Adams.
VTSS has now become the Sci
ence, Technology and Society pro
gram, but courses within the
major are not tracked in an inte
grated sequence like VTSS.
Adams said he organized VTSS
to "talk about math, science and
technology because they're very
difficult to treat separately."
"It's arbitrary to separate
them," he said.
But "the difficulty is providing
the right faculty and the proper
numbers for a long period of
time," Adams said. The new sci
ence core "is going to need some
resources and a reasonably large
number of faculty who are
involved in it. You just can't teach
a course like this forever."
In the VTSS course, Adams,
Osserman and Fetter all attended
most of the lectures, Fetter said.
At different points during the
year, topics would focus on one,
two or three of the primary inter
est areas of the professors.
"After five years, we basically
felt we had served our time and
we moved on," Fetter said. To
sustain the course, "ultimately, it
has to have departmental basis
and clear University support."
"It's hard to create new cours
es that will have a lasting exis
tence," Sheehan said. "The trick
is to have them institutionalized,
to make them part of the Univer
sity. I think the departments'
participation is essential."
