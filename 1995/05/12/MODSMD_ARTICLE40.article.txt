# COMMENCEMENT COUNTDOWN 1995
## Commencement commences 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Commencement will come to
the Farm for the 104 th time on
Sunday, June 18, and it will bring
a lot of people with it. Between
25,000 and 30,000 people are
expected to turn out to watch the
graduation ceremony and take
place in the other events of Com
mencement weekend.
Stanford Events has planned a
full slate of activities to accommo
date all these people, including
from tours, ceremonies and
speeches.
The highlight of the week will
be the Commencement ceremo
ny itself. This year, the event has
been wrapped in controversy as
schedulers cut out the proces
sion, a madcap entrance of the
graduates that in recent years
has led to wrestling matches,
kite flying and even a marriage
proposal. Now, however, it looks
as if the senior class and Univer
sity might bring back the proces
sion.
The main attraction for the
event, however, is Stanford facul
ty member and Secretary of
Defense William Perry. Perry will
deliver the keynote address to the
crowd.
Interesting among other
planned activities is the Satur
day, June 17 Baccalaureate Cele
bration. The ceremony, which
seeks to place the graduation in a
context of faith, will feature an
address by Azim Nanji, a profes
sor of Islamic studies at the Uni

versity of Florida.
Nanji is the first Baccalaureate
speaker in memory to come from
an Islamic tradition, said Robert

Gregg, dean of the chapel at
Memorial Church.
"He's really a very, very inter
esting guy," Gregg said. "This guy
has got a lot of talent both aca
demically and as a religious
voice."
Gregg, who has the responsi
bility of arranging the Baccalau

reate, said he tries to stress a few
different major religious tradi
tions each year so that the cere
mony can be inclusive without
becoming too watered-down.
The inclusion of an Islamic
speaker is valuable, Gregg said,
because Stanford has a large if
sometimes unrecognized Islamic

population and it is important to
"honor a great religious tradition."
Gregg added that he believes
Baccalaureate is a very important
ceremony for students.
"Baccalaureate is a very inter
esting day because I think it's the
last chance for a reasonably quiet
time of reflection," he said.
