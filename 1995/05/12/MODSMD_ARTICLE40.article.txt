# COMMENCEMENT COUNTDOWN 1995
## Commencement commences 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Commencement will come to
the Farm for the 104 th time on
Sunday, June 18, and it will bring
a lot of people with it. Between
25,000 and 30,000 people are
expected to turn out to watch the
graduation ceremony and take
place in the other events of Com
mencement weekend.
Stanford Events has planned a
full slate of activities to accommo
date all these people, including
from tours, ceremonies and
speeches.
The highlight of the week will
be the Commencement ceremo
ny itself. This year, the event has
been wrapped in controversy as
schedulers cut out the proces
sion, a madcap entrance of the
graduates that in recent years
has led to wrestling matches,
kite flying and even a marriage
proposal. Now, however, it looks
as if the senior class and Univer
sity might bring back the proces
sion.
The main attraction for the
event, however, is Stanford facul
ty member and Secretary of
Defense William Perry. Perry will
deliver the keynote address to the
crowd.
Interesting among other
planned activities is the Satur
day, June 17 Baccalaureate Cele
bration. The ceremony, which
seeks to place the graduation in a
context of faith, will feature an
address by Azim Nanji, a profes
sor of Islamic studies at the Uni
