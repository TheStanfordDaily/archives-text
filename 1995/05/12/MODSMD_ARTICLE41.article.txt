# 'Welcome graduates'
## Defense Secretary Perry to deliver keynote address 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Secretary of Defense William
Perry, a Stanford professor and
alumnus, will be the featured
speaker at the 104 th Com
mencement ceremony on June
18.
Perry received two mathe
matics degrees from Stanford, a
bachelor's degree in 1949 and a
master's in 1950. He went on to
complete his doctorate in his
home state at Pennsylvania
State University. Perry most
recently worked at Stanford as
director of the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms
Control; he is still a professor of

engineering and economic sys
tems.
Hinting at the subject of his
speech in the spring 1995 edi
tion of the Stanford Observer,
Stanford's alumni newspaper,
Perry said he hopes to use some
of the recent foreign policy
issues he has dealt with as
defense secretary for his
address.
"I'm thinking of talking
about the ethics of foreign poli
cy, the ethical issues involved in
questions like, 'Do we send
forces into Haiti?' 'Do we send
forces into Bosnia?' " he said.
Perry said he will also
encourage graduates to spend
some of their professional

careers in government service.
"I speak to that myself,
because I never set it out to
be, and I have never been,
making a career in the govern
ment," he said. "But I've
always believed that spending
a part of my career in service
to the government was an
important thing for a citizen
to do."
After an eight-week search to
fill the place of embattled for
mer Defense Secretary Les
Asp in, Perry was named to the
post on Feb. 3, 1994. The Sen
ate confirmed his nomination in
a 97-0 vote.
