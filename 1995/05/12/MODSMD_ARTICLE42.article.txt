# The
						Class of '95 gives record amount, aims for even more

### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
The Class of '95 has set a new record, raising the
largest senior gift ever.
And, if donations are strong this month, the class
could gain its second $50,000 matching grant while
recording a new highest level of participation.
Seniors have so far contributed more than
$16,000 to the Senior Gift Program drive. Since
every gift of more than $19.95 is first matched by a
donation from the Parents Advisory Board, then
matched again by Stanford benefactor Peter Bing,

that amount practically quadruples, said Scott
Showalter, director of new graduate and young
alumni development programs for Stanford.
Plus, Showalter added, since more than 33 per
cent of seniors have donated to the gift program,
Bing has provided another $50,000 to the drive.
More than 35 percent of the senior class had donat
ed as of yesterday, he added.
All told, then, donations to the Class of '95 gift
stand near $115,000 â€” a record figure, beating last
year's final total of $106,177.
