# The 						Class of '95 gives record amount, aims for even more

### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
The Class of '95 has set a new record, raising the
largest senior gift ever.
And, if donations are strong this month, the class
could gain its second $50,000 matching grant while
recording a new highest level of participation.
Seniors have so far contributed more than
$16,000 to the Senior Gift Program drive. Since
every gift of more than $19.95 is first matched by a
donation from the Parents Advisory Board, then
matched again by Stanford benefactor Peter Bing,

that amount practically quadruples, said Scott
Showalter, director of new graduate and young
alumni development programs for Stanford.
Plus, Showalter added, since more than 33 per
cent of seniors have donated to the gift program,
Bing has provided another $50,000 to the drive.
More than 35 percent of the senior class had donat
ed as of yesterday, he added.
All told, then, donations to the Class of '95 gift
stand near $115,000 â€” a record figure, beating last
year's final total of $106,177.
"It's been a full, year-long pro
ject, but we're definitely in the
home stretch and things are look
ing better," said Jason Rozes, one of
the senior gift chairs.
However, the drive for funds is
not over yet. If at least 50 percent of

seniors give to the gift drive,
Showaiter said, Bing will donate
another $50,000. If, that is, the
money is pledged before the pro
gram's deadline, June 1.
Getting one-half of seniors to
participate has become the senior
gift chairs' new goal.
"We have another two weeks,
two-and-a-half weeks, to get the
next 16, 17 percent of the senior
class," said Keith Richman, another

gift chair. "I think we can.... It's
going to be tough, though."
To help get seniors in a giving
mood, Rich man said several seniors
will be sitting in White Plaza next
week, selling Stanford souvenirs,
offering sno-cones and explaining
why the soon-to-be-alums should
donate.
Rich man offered his own point
of view on why seniors should give
to the gift. "I feel that if you've real
ly gotten a lot out of an organiza
tion, you should return to it,"he
said.
Donating $19.95 or more every
year, Richman said, is "like upkeep
on an antique car.... $19.95 is
basically an insurance that Stan
ford remains a top institution."
Showalter said that once the
Class of '95 graduates, the Bing
gifts continue for five years. Every
year until 2000, Bing will donate
two dollars for every dollar over the
amount of the previous year's
Class of '95 gift, Showalter said. He
added that Bing will give an extra
$1,000 for each additional percent
age point of donors. And, if 50 per
cent of the Class of '95 donates to
the University by the fifth class
reunion, Bing will give $100,000 to
Stanford.
