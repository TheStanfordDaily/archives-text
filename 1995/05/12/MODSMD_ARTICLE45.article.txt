## Your friends who never made it: Lies on admissions application reason for rejection from the University 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
As seniors get ready to graduate, they might
think of those high school Class of '91ers who never
made it.
Not those who passed away or dropped out, mind
you, but those who had their acceptances yanked for
lying on their applications.
Every year admissions officers sift through thou
sands of glowing applications. And according to
John Bunnell, director of freshman admissions,
every year there are candidates who misrepresent
themselves in the selection process.
A dramatic example of such misrepresentation
recently shook Harvard University, when it was dis
covered that the college had admitted a female stu
dent who had previously beaten her mother to death
with a lead crystal candlestick.
In another case at Yale University, a C-minus
community college student managed to gain admis
sion to the college by forging his transcript.
Although Stanford's Admissions Committee tries
to meticulously inspect each application, Bunnell
said that with more than 15,000 applicants there are
bound to be some students who slip through the

cracks. The committee typically discovers one or two
forgeries a year.
"Our process is thorough and thoughtful and in
fact puts us in a good position to identify applica
tions which are fraudulent," said Dean of Under
graduate Admissions James Montoya.
Inconsistencies and patterns often alert the com
mittee to foul play, Montoya said.
Montoya retailed one case this year in which all
three recommendations were written on separate
pieces of paper and then stapled to the forms.
Finding this unusual, Montoya followed up on his
hunch and discovered that the student had fabricat
ed the recommendations. In another case, Montoya
said that a student misspelled the same word on
both the recommendations and the application.
While discoveries like these are rare, it is even
more unusual for the committee to encounter a case
like the ones at Harvard and Yale, where current
students are proven to have misrepresented them
selves in the application process.
However, after 32 years working in the Under
graduate Admissions Office, Bunnell has a few
interesting stories to tell.
