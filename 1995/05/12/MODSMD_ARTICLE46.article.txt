# Burying the present: time capsule a tradition
## 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
When they talk about us, long
after we're dead, at least they'll
know that we drank and we
danced — and of course watched
"ER."
These are but a few of the mes
sages anthropologists, or maybe
21st-century CIV students, will
cull when they unearth the time
capsule that will be buried under
neath a shiny brass "95" plaque in
the Inner Quad.
The burying of a capsule is a
Stanford tradition. Brass plaques
line the Quad, dating back to the
University's first graduating class
104 years ago. No one knows if

capsules lie under every plaque;
no one has ever dug up one of the
plaques. There is no scheduled
time for this year's capsule to be
disinterred.
Still, every year, the ritual buri
al and its accompanying ceremony
continues.
Among the items slated for
inclusion in this year's collection
are videos of hit TV shows "ER"
and "Melrose Place," music,
drinking accessories, articles on
current events, books and Stan
ford memorabilia.
Senior Class President Sarah-
Marie Martin said the artifacts
include "a lot of things represent
ing the senior class at Stanford...
then a lot of things representing

noteworthy events." Pop culture
trinkets are also included, such as
a Juice Club mug.
Martin said the senior class
presidents are still seeking sugges
tions on other items to place in the
capsule before it is sealed. The
sealing takes place about a week
before Commencement, she said.
The actual lowering of the cap
sule into the ground does not
occur until 10:30 a.m. on Satur
day, June 17. At that time Univer
sity Provost Condoleezza Rice will
give a brief, light-hearted speech
and the plaque — which costs
$1,922, half of which the senior
class funds — will be dedicated.
Before the hole is sealed, how
ever, seniors can toss other objects

in to be preserved for the future,
Martin said. She suggested that
students include small objects
that will remain well preserved
over time.
Students looking for hints on
what to include in the capsule
could consult past years: Crystal
Pepsi, a Teva, a pink triangle but
ton, a Beavis and Butthead video,
a "Keep Abortion Legal" sticker
and a long-overdue Stanford Post
Office delivery.
Those seniors interested in
contacting the senior class presi
dents about this issue are encour
aged to e-mail them, Martin said.
The four presidents are Martin,
Eric Chen, Paula Strange Dybdahl
and Kevin Harrington.
