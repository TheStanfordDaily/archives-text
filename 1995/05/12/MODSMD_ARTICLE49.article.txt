# Graduating seniors look back on years of work, friendship
## 
### Tracy Jan 
As Commencement nears,
seniors are starting to look back
on their years on the Farm with
bittersweet nostalgia.
"People here know how to
relax a lot more than at the Ivy
Leagues. There is a strong social
life on campus," Naveen Chopra
said. "I like the University's alco
hol policy, which trusts us to han
dle things maturely. We can bond
with friends without going off
campus."
Although seniors said that aca
demics was what most attracted
them to Stanford, the people they
have met made their experience
extraordinary. "I've made some of
the best friends of my life here at
Stanford," said Greg Harris, a
political science major.
"Every person that I met these
past years just amazed me in
some way, whether it be a talent
they had or the way they related
to other people," Chopra said.
"Everyone has something you can
learn from them, and I was hum

bled by everyone.
"Don't underestimate the
value of the people that you meet
at Stanford," Chopra advised.
"Too often we pass up opportuni
ties to meet people because of aca
demic pressures."
Faraz Ali said others have
helped him define his own charac
ter. "People are like walking, liv
ing, breathing mirrors of your
self," he said. "You expose differ
ent sides of you to different peo
ple. These are the people who hold
me, in a way, or I'd just exist in my
mind. I am in an environment
that validates my existence."
Lee Ming Yeh agreed Stanford
has played a role in helping
her develop her values. "I like
what type of person that Stanford
has developed me into, in terms of
people I've met. Being surround
ed by them really changed me as a
person," she said.
"Being here has given me
greater confidence and strength
of character. My years here have
defmed what really matters to me
— personal integrity and self

respect," Yeh added. "I learned to
become friends with people whom
I respected instead of just people
who were fun to be with."
"I love to just hang out and
have learned to value hanging out
more through the years. Before
there was a large sense of guilt
associated with it but I now feel
that talking to people is more
valuable than academic learning
in many ways," Chopra agreed.
Chopra said Stanford's reputa
tion as a non-dating school is due
in part to its diversity. "I hope to
meet someone here who will chal
lenge me, motivate me. Again, it's
all in the people here," Chopra
said. "There is a lot of respect for
people's individuality, and that is
why we have a bad rap for rela
tionships."
Chopra, however, admits to
having been "totally floored by
the women, whether it be aca
demic, athletics or personality.
I'm in awe of most of these people
but we pass up many opportuni
ties. Somehow school is always
involved, like study dates at the

Co Ho."
Harris, a resident assistant in
Junipero, said being an RA has
brought him back to his freshman
year, and"the best experience
ever. My RAs frosh year were def
initely a good introduction to the
school. My frosh dorm experience
in Otero was amazing. Now I get
to be like a dad to 90 kids.
"I've tried not to lose the fresh
man enthusiasm, energy and
optimism. I've seen too many peo
ple who have become too 'adult,'
thinking they have to act a cer
tain way," Harris continued.
"I think we spend a lot of our
years trying to be older as the
expense of our inner child," Ali
agreed.
Although Harris said he will
remain a freshman at heart, he
said his thinking has evolved dur
ing his four years here. "As a
frosh I thought I had to come up
with a life philosophy and stick to
that — to find one answer, a
cause," Harris said.
"Now I'm more comfortable

with having questions and not
being sure of things, things that
don't fit into my ideology," he
continued, "I am now more com
fortable taking things on a case by
case basis. I don't respect people
who stay with one viewpoint on
everything. It's limiting."
In addition to being an RA,
Harris said he likes to "stay up
really, really late talking to peo

pie. I like making people excited
and having other people make me
excited about being here at Stan
ford."
Many seniors also remember
their freshman years as when
they participated in Stanford tra
ditions. "Freshman year my
friends and I pulled a lot of
pranks, like stealing the neon
Wilbur signs which used to hang
in the dining hall," said Ali. "We
steam tunneled, stole Soto the
Dog and set off smoke bombs at
Big Game."
"But," Ali added, "I've learned

to weigh the costs, benefits and
dangers as time went on."
Chopra said her outlook has
become less optimistic since
freshman year. "Besides gaining
about 25 pounds from freshman
to senior year, I've also grown
much more calloused to the
world," Chopra said. "You've
accomplished so much just to get
here but now you realize that the
world doesn't always work the
way you want it to."
Harris said his academic and
career aspirations changed dra
matically while at the Farm

thanks to Stanford's flexibility in
academic experimentation.
"Though I came in pre-med, I've
learned what my intellectual pas
sion is at Stanford," said Harris,
who wants to pursue a career
related to law.
Next year Harris will be at the
University of Florida, in Gainesville,
before heading off to Harvard Law
School. "I plan to earn a little
money, relax and live life without a
daily planner," He said.
"As time goes by you learn the
value of being flexible, not only
with others but with yourself,"

Ali said. "As long as you've got
ambition and direction, you will
be successful."
"We've all gone through days
where it's like, 'Man, I don't want
to leave,' but even though I'm
graduating, it's not the ultimate
farewell," said Chopra, who is
returning to the Farm for a mas
ter's degree.
Ali compared his years at Stan
ford to being in an hourglass. "As
time goes by the sand is running
out. By senior year you feel like
the bottom's going to fall out from
underneath you. It's scary."
