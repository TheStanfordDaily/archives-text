# Exotic history: party of 'Pimps and Prostitutes'
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
As students prepare to strip down
and don their Speedos for tonight's Ex
otic Erotic, they may not realize that the
party marks a long-time Stanford tradi
tion.
The annual party, thrown by Alpha
Sig residents, is one of the largest on
campus. It dates back as far as 1962 and
possibly even before then, said sopho
more Chris Pandolfo, Alpha Sig house
manager.
The party, however, didn't always go
by the name Exotic Erotic. Students
dressed up for "Pimps and Prostitutes"

until 1972, when the name changed to
Exotic Erotic. Since then, the party has
drawn a following.
According to Pandolfo, Exotic Erotic
has a "long-standing record of attract
ing people from many, many miles away
and having them arrested."
Until this year, Alpha Sig threw the
party during Prospective Freshman
Week for that very reason, said Stuart
Richardson, an Alpha Sig resident. He
added that it was aiso to "let them have
a good time."
Because the University is "getting
very protective of [its] admits" and this
spring has been marked by cold weath
er, Pandolfo and other Alpha Sig resi

dents decided to reschedule the party
this year.
One new admit, however, did not
know about the change and came to the
house during Stanford Admit Weekend
last month wearing "some sort of toga
with an 8-foot boa constrictor"
wrapped around his body, Pandolfo
said. Residents of the house had to let
"the poor guy in the outrageous cos
tume" know about the change, he
added.
This year's party will feature a num
ber of additional changes, although
none will be as drastic as its name
change.
"One thing that we are definitely em

phasizing [this year] is less of the
raunchy and more of the masquerade,"
Pandolfo said.
"We want people to push their limits
a little bit... but in a safe and comfort
able way," he added.
Safety and concern for female stu
dents will also be a priority this year.
There will be a van to transport stu
dents who are leaving the party and
SURE Escort Service will also be tak
ing people home, Pandolfo said.
In addition, there will be a coat check
so that students won't be embarrassed
as they leave the party, Pandolfo said.
He added that there will also be security
officers outside the house.
