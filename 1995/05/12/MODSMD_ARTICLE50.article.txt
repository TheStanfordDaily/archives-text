# How to keep younger siblings happy during Commencement
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
All right, so it's your graduation,
your day to shine and you don't want to
have to share the spotlight with anyone.
But in the midst of Commencement fes
tivities, don't forget the people who
taught you how to argue and how to
cooperate, forced you to learn how to get
what you wanted — like the last piece
of chocolate cake — and pushed you to
get to where you are today: your
younger siblings.
Your parents, grandparents, aunts,
uncles and family friends will have plen
ty of grown-up activities to keep them
busy during their few days at Stanford.
But your little sisters and brothers will
probably be bored by campus tours and
speeches after the first few hours.
Rather than listen to the little dears
whine, offer some constructive sugges
tions for activities in the surrounding
area. You'll make them feel appreciated,
and impress your parents with how
you've matured in your four years at col
lege.
Palo Alto
The Barbie Doll Hall of Fame:
Located in downtown Palo Alto, this 11-
year-old studio houses tens of thousands
of different dolls ranging from the origi
nal Barbie issues in March 1959 to the
newest "Baywatch" Barbie and Ken
dolls.
This museum is not just for your kid
sister — grown men have been known to
extol the Hall of Fame's virtues. The
museum contains a copy of every Barbie
doll ever issued by Mattel but for one
accessory: a toy pooch.
While younger children will be excit
ed to see such treats as the new Disney
Barbie dolls, including Cinderella, Peter
Pan and Beauty and the Beast, older
people on the tour will recognize earlier
dolls based on classic Hollywood movies
like "Easter Parade" and "Roman Holi
day."
There are also Barbies who walk and
talk, dolls in designer garb from the
likes of Christian Dior and Oscar de la
Renta and a wide array of Barbie acces
sories, including a bathroom set, a hot
pink convertible and a swimming pool
complete with water slide.
The Barbie Doll Hall of Fame is locat
ed at 433 Waverly St.in downtown Palo
Alto. It is open Tuesday through Friday,
1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission is $4
per person.

The Stanford Theater: As most
Stanford students know, this old-time
theater is host to a number of classic
movies every week. The theater often
shows a series of films focusing on a par
ticular actor or director — "The Maltese
Falcon" and "Casablanca" in one week
end, for example — and patrons are
invited to see one or all of these offer
ings.
Probably appreciated more by older
children, the theater's decor is in keep
ing with the type of films it shows — an
atmosphere more appropriate to a turn
of-the-century music hall than a mod
ern-day cineplex. A special treat is an
organ, complete with a real live organist,
which rises from underneath the stage
between movies.
Within walking distance of campus,
the Stanford Theater is located at 221
University Ave. Call 324-3700 for movie
times and more information.
South of Stanford
San Jose: Though not as busy and
bustling as San Francisco, this city 30
minutes south of campus offers enough
to keep any kid completely busy for sev
eral days.
An obvious choice for children is
Great America, located off Highway
101 southbound. A traditional amuse
ment park, Great America boasts a
number of rides guaranteed to thrill
you, chill you and possibly make you
sick. Top Gun is a perennial favorite, as
is Rip Roaring Rapids, a 1,600-foot
white water raft ride. There are also
rides designed for smaller kids, an aerial
gondola and one of the world's largest
carousels — a double-decker.
Also to be found on the way to San
Jose is the Winchester Mystery
House, between Highway 280 and
Stevens Creek Boulevard. Designed to
confuse the evil spirits that haunted
Sarah Winchester, the eccentric heiress
to the Winchester Arms fortune, the
house has 160 rooms, 2,000 doors, 13
bathrooms, 10,000 windows, 47 fire
places, blind closets, secret passageways
and 40 staircases.
The house is so complicated that
apparently even the owner and servants
needed maps to find their way around.
Visitors today can take 65-minute guided
tours or poke around themselves. Open
daily 9-4:30, the estate also features the
Winchester Historic Firearms Museum.
In San Jose proper, families can visit
the Children's Discovery Museum of
San Jose. In the middle of Guadalupe

Park, the museum
offers changing inter
active exhibits
designed to lead chil
dren to discoveries
about themselves and
the world. The muse
um is located at the
intersection of Woz
Way and Auzerais
Street and children
under 13 must be
accompanied by an
adult. Open Tuesday
through Saturday 10-
5 and Sunday noon-5.
After a trip to the
museum, energetic
families can travel to
Happy Hollow, a
family park with a
playground, river
boat replica, tree
house, rides and a
zoo. Located at 1300
Senter Road in San
Jose, the park is open
Monday through Sat
urday 10-5 and Sun
day 11-6. Combina
tion tickets for the
playground, rides and
zoo can be bought for
$3.50.

Finally, no trip to San Jose would be
complete without a stop at the Rosicru
cian Egyptian Museum and Plane
tarium. On Park Avenue between
Naglee and Randol, the museum boasts
a collection of Egyptian artifacts —
including mummies, sculptures and jew
elry — as well as a replica of an Egyp
tian rock tomb. The museum is open
daily 9-5; admission is $6 for adults, $4
for those over 65 and students with ID
and $3.50 for kids ages 7-15.
Monterey Bay Aquarium: It takes
a long time to get here from campus —
about 90 minutes — but the fun of vis
iting one of the world's largest aquari
ums is worth the drive. More than 500
species of marine life live in 23 major
habitat areas, including a 90-foot-long
recreation of Monterey Bay and a two
story otter exhibit, part of the Sea Otter
Rescue and Care Program.
In addition, a new exhibit open
through 1997 spotlights "Deadly Beau
ties" — poisonous tropical fish swim
ming just out of reach. For something
safer, kids can try the "touch pool," the
aquarium's version of a petting farm
complete with starfish and bat rays.

The museum is located at 886 Can
nery Row and is open daily from 10-6.
Admission is $11.25 for adults, $8.25 for
senior citizens, active-duty military and
students with ID and $5 for children 3-
12.
To the City
San Francisco: Besides the hustle
and bustle of Chinatown, Union Square
and other tourist extravaganzas, the
City has several attractions geared right
toward children.
One such venue is the Exploratori
um. Kids of all ages will love this inter
active museum; you don't even have to
be a scientific type to appreciate it. More
than 600 exhibits let visitors see, touch,
hear, feel and explore several fields of
science, mathematics, technology, ani
mal behavior and human perception.
Open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the
Exploratorium is located in the Marina
district and can be entered at Bay and
Lyon Streets or Marina Boulevard (east
bound) and Lyon Street. Admission is $8
for adults, $6 for those over 65 and stu
dents with ID and $4 for children ages 6-
17.
Kids will also enjoy Fisherman's

Wharf, where they can board the old
vessels anchored at the Hyde Street Pier
and Pier 43 1/2. The wharf also boasts a
wax museum at 145 Jefferson Street —
containing scenes of American presi
dents, world leaders and movie stars, a
chamber of horrors and a haunted gold
mine — as well as the Ripley's Believe it
or Not! Museum, displaying the bizarre
and unusual.
The San Francisco Fire Depart
ment Museum, at 655 Presidio
Avenue, offers more than 125 years of
San Francisco Fire Department history
— a gold mine in a city that has had to
rebuild seven times in its history after
devastating fires. Guided tours leave
Thursday through Sunday, 1-4, and
admission is free.
Finally, sightseeing-satiated kids may
enjoy some time in Golden Gate Park,
with its miles of trails. The San Fran
cisco Zoo, located near Lake Merced, is
also a good bet, with more than 1,000
mammals and birds and including a Pri
mate Discovery Center. The zoo is open
daily 10-5 (the lions are fed Tuesday
through Sunday at 2 p.m.) and admission
is $6.50 for adults, $3 for senior citizens
and kids 12-15 and free for children
under 12 when accompanied by an adult.
