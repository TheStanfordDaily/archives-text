Saying goodbye has never been my
forte. I remember sobbing at the
end of family visits, whimpering
when my family sold the old brown car
and even making a fuss when we painted
the house a different color. Comfort lies
in consistency and predictability; fear
resides in change.
So lately it's been a struggle. Thirty
seven days from now, a tassel will dangle
in the corner of my eye as I stride along
side my friends in a black robe. I will
reach out and someone will hand me a
diploma and wish me good luck. I will
ship my books, pack my things and hug
my friends. I will drive away.
It's a crazy, incomprehensible series of
thoughts that becomes closer to reality
each day, yet harder to believe. Has it
been four years'? Am 122 years old? I feel
like an old grandma on the front porch,
rocking and reminiscing, speaking fondly
of days past while my vericose veins
spread and my skin ages with the sun. I
feel old these days, it's true. My body
seems slower, my mind less agile and my

vericose veins are spreading. But unlike
Grandma's life, mine is just beginning.
Commencement. So grandiose a word,
so stately, so heavy. It rings of change
and newness, of stuffy ritual and tradi
tion. And despite the closure it signifies, I
can't forget that "commence" means "to
begin." I'll begin living a different life,
one without palm trees and Rodin, food
service and Flicks. At first it will be a
shock to my system to begin again, like
displacing an animal from its proper
habitat. But then again, I lived through
the transition between home and Flo Mo
four years ago, and I can certainly sur
vive again. And rather than the tentative
frosh I was then, I am now a tentative
senior with a few tidbits of personal
growth to my name.
I picture the Allyson of four years ago
as a wondering, wandering soul, crawling
into the cocoon of Stanford University,
expecting to emerge a strong and directed
individual. Somehow during this massive
metamorphosis, I would discover my pur
pose and overcome my faults. I would

become a genius and find a passion. Now
the cocoon is cracking and I'm getting my
first glimpses of the world outside — and
I don't feel ready. Different, yes. Pre
pared, no.
I guess a major part of my hesitation
in graduating is simply dealing with the
disappointment of not becoming the
Allyson I thought college would create.
I'm still confused by life, if not more so.
I'm still a homebody, I still get nervous
when the teacher calls on me and I still
procrastinate. I haven't gotten better at
math or become a faster reader, and I still
haven't read the Bible. No mtyor trans
formations there. It makes me wonder
what in the world I've been doing for the
past four years.
Graduating does this to people. I'm
leaving Stanford soon, and I want to know
who I've become. I want justification for
CIV, for all-nighters and three-hour
finals. I'm searching for signs of improve
ment and personal change. The trouble is,
I'm looking in the wrong places.
If someone asked me what I've learned

at Stanford, my response wouldn't con
sist of numbers or facts. I might be able
to fudge my way through Faulkner or
mention Chuang Tzu, but that's not
entirely what four years of "education"
has left me with. I could have "learned"
those things before I set foot on the
Farm. Stanford has given me an educa
tion about myself, about who AUyson is
and what makes her tick. It hasn't given
me the answers, but I'm definitely closer
to finding out what I need and what's
important.
My Stanford education has consisted
of four Big Games, swiping Coffee House
glasses and gaining 15 pounds freshman
year. I've learned that coffee tastes good,
that political awareness is a positive
thing and that the view from the Dish at
sunrise is remarkable. I have listened to
Spike Lee, Naomi Wolf and Adrienne
Rich. I wear sweats, have two holes in my
left ear and eat tofu. I have made and lost
friendships, privately explored my eth
nicity and considered the role of religion
in my life. I suppose I have changed, but

not in the ways I expected. Luckily, they
are changes that are meaningful to me,
and the ones I needed most.
The books I have read and the classes
I have taken the past four years have def
initely aided this transformation. I am
proud to have a respectable library of my
own and a broad transcript. I've been
exposed to crannies of academia that I
never considered before. But strangely,
with all the academic resources Stanford
has to offer, I still haven't found the sin
gular "passion" that Condoleezza Rice
frequently speaks of — the same one I
expected to find four years ago. I only
know that my passion is not here. Maybe
I'll find it next year; maybe it's at the
Dish at sunrise.
I have been impassioned, though, by
learning about other people, by drawing
ironies between Palo Alto and East Palo
Alto and by protesting what I disagree
with. I have the feeling that one's passion
