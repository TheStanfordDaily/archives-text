# Spielberg donates games
## Children's Hospital patients to get virtual playground 
### Marcus Jackson 
Patients at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital at Stanford may soon
find their stays much more pleasant than
anticipated.
The Children's Hospital is one of be
tween five and seven hospitals being con
sidered as test sites for a new pilot pro
gram launched by a joint effort between
Steven Spielberg's non-profit Starbright
Foundation — a charity devoted to im
proving the quality of life for seriously ill
children — and various Silicon Valley cor
porations.
This joint effort will provide games for

the patients and allow them to interact
with children in other hospitals via a net
work.
"Sprint, Intel, UB Networks and Worlds
Inc. joined to create a broad band network
to link sick children," said Chris Garvey,
director of Resource Development at Star
bright.
"By linking these kids, who are often de
prived of the simple joys of childhood, we
give them a play space just like a park or
playground in which they can interact with
one another unencumbered by their physi
cal limitations," said Spielberg in a state-
ment made Tuesday.
"The children will have access
to a three-dimensional virtual
playground where they can
interact with their peers. By let
ting the kids have fun, this net
work will have therapeutic
value," said Garvey.
"These kids will get the
opportunity to come out of the
isolated and often debilitating
world of hospitals, therapy, pain
and medicine to play, create,
imagine and grow in ways that
should be the right of every
child," Spielberg said in a state
ment.
The various high-tech compa
nies involved are creating the
network, supplying the hard
ware and adapting the virtual
reality media to the particular
needs of child patients.
"The existing technology is
text based and therefore does
not suit the needs of children's
hospitals since many of the
patients aren't capable of typing.

We plan to make a system that
uses voice-based technology,"
said Garvey.
"Children will be able to play
in a complete virtual environ
ment within a computer," he
added.
The arrangement with the
Children's Hospital has not been
finalized, according to Jean Tips,
public relations manager for the
Department of External Affairs
and Communications at the
Children's Hospital.
"Stanford was first contacted
about this program a couple of
weeks ago and has yet to sign a
contract. We are trying to come
to a conclusion within the next
few days," said Tips.
Representatives of the Star
bright Foundation have
expressed their hope that this
network will eventually link
children in hundreds of hospi
tals throughout the nation and
the world.
More information about the
network and the hospitals that
are involved in the 30-month
test pilot will be released on
June 5 in Los Angeles at the Dig
ital World trade show.
