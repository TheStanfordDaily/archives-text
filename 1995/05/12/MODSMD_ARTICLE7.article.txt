# Navajo president speaks on protecting tribal rights
## 
### Stewart Maclennan 
Capturing the attention of an audience of
roughly 30 people yesterday evening, Albert
Hale, the newly elected president of the
Navajo Nation, demanded that the federal
government cease to neglect Indian nations
and remember its commitment to protecting
tribal sovereignty.
"This is an historic event.... President

Hale is the first Navajo president to speak at
this University," said Raymond Austin, asso
ciate justice of the Navajo Nation Supreme
Court and a visiting professor at the Law
School.
Hale, who received his law degree from
the University of New Mexico, stressed that
although the Navajo Nation has a limited
ability to exercise self-government
through the implementation of its
own laws, it is largely restricted by
the federal government.
"We do not have the ability to
regulate commerce between Indian
nations, nor can we engage in for
eign relations," Hale told the audi
ence in the History Building.
He also noted that the Navajo
Nation has recently succeeded in
furthering its sovereignty by : stab
lishing its own three-branch gov
ernment.
Hale surprised his listeners with
the irony of his people's hard
fought victory. "The three-branch
concept of government was first
organized by the Indian tribes," he
said. "This was copied by the
Founding Fathers."
In addition, Hale claimed that
the new Republican Congress has
neglected his people. "Indian
nations have been forgotten in
Newt Gingrich's 'Contract With

America,'" he said.
A year ago, Hale said he met
with President Clinton, stressing
that he promised Native American
leaders renewed governmental
efforts by the government to assist
them in attacking chronic problems
like poorly paved roads and a Nava
jo unemployment rate greater than
50 percent.
"The policy that was enunciat
ed continues to be rhetoric," Hale
commented. "The problems we
have today must be treated as
challenges and the Navajo people
must see challenges as opportuni
ties."
One opportunity that Hale
emphasized as critical to the Nava
jo people is its ability to voice its
demands. "We must present our
agenda. .. . The federal govern
ment owes us a responsibility."
Hale has proposed that a federal
center for all Navajo affairs be set
up within the Navajo Nation to
streamline the service of govern
ment bureaucracies which have
made it difficult for Native Ameri
cans to pursue reform. His propos
al has yet to be approved.
