# Dancing away the big night

Put on those dancing shoes! Big Dance, the sec
ond annual "moonrise to sunrise dance-a-thon,"
will be held at the Roble Dance Studio and Gym
tonight from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Big Dance is the third major dance event of the
year, after the Ragtime Ball and the Viennese Ball.
Richard Powers, head of Stanford's Dance Division,
said he sees Big Dance as a "forum for all kinds of
dancing."
"It is all-inclusive, the ultimate party and inten
tionally eclectic," Powers said. "There exists at
Stanford an increasing body of students who really
love to dance."
Jammix, a dance party held on the second Friday
of each month, has introduced social dance to a
number of students. Powers described Big Dance as
the "ultimate Jammix."
"I do think that this year's Big Dance will be
well-attended because Richard's classes are grow
ing and Jammix attracted a lot of new people," said
senior Kristina Ho, a student representative in
Friends of Dance, an alumni group promoting
dance appreciation on-campus and in the commu
nity.
She added that the idea for Big Dance came from

take a practice spin before tonight's Big Dance.
Penn State, where the annual
dance marathon is the largest col
lege fund raiser in the country.
Senior Jean-Won Chao said
most people learn immediately
whether social dancing is for
them. "Your first beginning
lessons determine whether or not
you will enjoy social dance. I like
dancing and interpreting music
through movement. Dance is real
ly alive."
Freshman Chuck Gates said
Big Dance is an opportunity to
promote Stanford's dance culture.
"I like to take an active part in
dance. I want to help everyone
enjoy dance as much as I do."
"Learning a few basic steps can
get you through the night because
there are a great number of varia
tions," Chao agreed. She is a mem
ber of the Gang of 13, a group of
dedicated dancers who volun
teered last year to help put on Big
Dance.
"The Gang of 13 meets often
and we have expanded beyond 13

people. It became an important
part of my social life," Chao said of
the tight-knit group.
"Big Dance is going to be a lot of
fun. I highly encourage people to
come," said junior Ryan Knotts.
Knotts, last year's marathon
swing contest winner, has been
teaching various dance steps at
certain dorms throughout the
week in preparation for Big Dance.
To win the contests, he advises
people to "be in good cardiovascu
lar shape."
The evening promises to be
enjoyable even for those who are
unfamiliar with social dance. In
addition to the dance studio where
five rotating bands will play swing,
jazz, tango, waltz and polka, the
DJs in the gym — which will
become the "rave room" — will
blast techno, funk, house, rap and
hip hop.
Bands for the night include the
Los Compas Salsa Band, Paul
Price Society Orchestra, the Stan
ford Jazz Ensemble and the Stan
ford Band, complete with Dollies.
Dance ensembles such as Ballet
Folklorico and the Vintage Dance
Ensemble will also perform at the
event. Contributing to the diversi

ty of the night, the Taiko Drum
mers will play at 2:15 a.m.
Junior Jennifer Harris said she
plans to bring her mother, who
will be visiting for Mother's Day
weekend. "I think she'll have a fun
time. It will be a good atmosphere
for learning. I have a lot of cool
friends to set her up with," Harris
said.
"I love ballroom dancing and
this event is really open and care
free. Anyone can learn to dance,"
she added.
Big Dance is a fund raiser for
Disabled Students of Stanford and
the Stanford Dance Division.
Local businesses have donated
printing, artwork, food and drinks
to Big Dance as well as prizes for
the dance contests. This year 500
to 600 people, both students and
community members, are expect
ed to attend.
Last year's attendance was
between 250 and 300 people and
over 30 dancers stayed until 10
a.m. during the 13-hour marathon.
Although Big Dance is not an offi
cial marathon this year, people are
encouraged to stay for as long as
possible. The Dance Division raised
over $2,000 last year.
