Put on those dancing shoes! Big Dance, the sec
ond annual "moonrise to sunrise dance-a-thon,"
will be held at the Roble Dance Studio and Gym
tonight from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Big Dance is the third major dance event of the
year, after the Ragtime Ball and the Viennese Ball.
Richard Powers, head of Stanford's Dance Division,
said he sees Big Dance as a "forum for all kinds of
dancing."
"It is all-inclusive, the ultimate party and inten
tionally eclectic," Powers said. "There exists at
Stanford an increasing body of students who really
love to dance."
Jammix, a dance party held on the second Friday
of each month, has introduced social dance to a
number of students. Powers described Big Dance as
the "ultimate Jammix."
"I do think that this year's Big Dance will be
well-attended because Richard's classes are grow
ing and Jammix attracted a lot of new people," said
senior Kristina Ho, a student representative in
Friends of Dance, an alumni group promoting
dance appreciation on-campus and in the commu
nity.
She added that the idea for Big Dance came from
