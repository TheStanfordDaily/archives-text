The Center for Latin American Studies Presents
Windows/Ventanas
A Reading by/Una lectura por
Eduardo Galeano, one of Latin America's most prominent writers and critics, will give a
selected reading of his works in both English and Spanish. From the publication in 1971
of Las venas abiertas de America Latina (Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of
the Pilage of the Continent), which brought him international recognition, to his three
volume epic history of Latin America, Memory of Fire, Galeano has brought to life for his
readers the turbulent history and rich culture of Latin America. Mr. Galeano's most
recent book, Las palabras andantes, will be published in English as Walking Words in
June. Copies of Eduardo Galeano's books will be for sale at this event.
