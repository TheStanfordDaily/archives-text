David Hilfiker
Dr. Hilfiker has been a physician working with poor people
since 1975 when he entered rural family practice in a community
near an impoverished Native American reservation. In 1983, he
moved to the inner city of Washington, D.C. where he has worked
for ten years as a family doctor in an inner-city neighborhood clinic.
From 1985 to 1990 he was involved in the founding and operation of
Christ House, a medical recovery shelter for 34 homeless men,
where he both lived and worked. In 1990, he and his family then
moved to Joseph's House, a home for formerly homeless men with
AIDS. Hilfiker is the author of Not All Of Us Are Saints, published
in 1994.
