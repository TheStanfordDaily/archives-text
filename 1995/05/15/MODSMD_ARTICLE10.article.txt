Argentine elections
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -
President Carlos Menem, whose free mar
ket reforms tamed hyperinflation and
revived the Argentine economy, claimed
victory yesterday in his bid for a second
term.
Menem based his claim on unofficial
exit polls conducted by Buenos Aires TV
Channel 9, Radio Mitre and other inde
pendent media giving him a resounding
47 percent of the vote — enough to avoid
a runoff election.
Early official returns, based on 25 per
cent of votes, gave Menem 46.5 percent,
Sen. Jose Bordon of the center-left coali
tion FREPASO 33.4 percent and Horacio
Massaccesi of the centrist Radical Civic
Union 15.75 percent. Bordon conceded
defeat shortly after 11 p.m. (7 p.m. PDT).
"No government in the world has ever
done as much to get a country moving as
we did," Menem told a news conference.
"We already have pulverized hyperinfla
tion and now we will pulverize unemploy
ment."
Cultist arrested
TOKYO (AP) — Police today arrested
a leading member of a doomsday cult who
is suspected of supervising the nerve gas
attack on Tokyo's subway.
After an intense, nationwide search,
police arrested Yoshihiro Inoue and three
other members of the Aum Shinri Kyo
cult at a roadblock on the outskirts of
Tokyo just before dawn.
Inoue resisted arrest, and was taken
into custody for obstruction of justice. He
was later identified by his fingerprints,
said a spokesman for the Tokyo
Metropolitan Police Department.
Police confiscated numerous docu
ments, a personal computer and hun
dreds of other items from the cult mem
ber's car.

Inoue, 25, is head of the cult's "Min
istry of Intelligence," and was a close con
fidant of cult leader Shoko Asahara, who
remains at large.
Police reportedly believe Inoue super
vised the March 20 nerve gas attack,
which left 12 people dead and sickened
another 5,500.
Although police have seized tons of
chemicals that could be used to make the
nerve gas at the cult's Mount Fuji com
mune, they have yet to charge anyone
with the attack. The cult has repeatedly
denied any involvement.
Budget debate
WASHINGTON (AP) - Democratic
offers to cut a deal on tax cuts and bud
get reductions were met with disdain
yseterday by Republicans who said the
Democrats have relinquished their
right to determine the nation's fiscal
future.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., gen
eral chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said the two parties could
work together to balance the budget if
both the Republicans and the Clinton
administration dropped tax cut proposals
and found common ground on health care
reform.
"If we can do that then I think frankly
we can come to an agreement. That's
what we ought to be doing, not trying to
one-up each other," Dodd said on NBC's
"Meet the Press."
White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta said the administration was "pre
pared to deal" on the budget, but only if
the Republicans abandoned their tax-cut
plans and ensured that health care and
education would not be sacrificed as part
of the drive to balance the budget.
The tentative gestures toward compro
mise were brushed aside by key Republi
can budget makers.
