LINNSBURG, Ind. (AP) — Gary Heimbach and
Linda Kelp were home when the storm hit yester
day. It tossed their trailer 200 yards and left their
bodies in a field.
The suspected tornado destroyed the family's
barn, workshop, garage and silo and did severe dam
age to Heimbach's parents' house.
"There was no warning — just some hail and
then a whoosh," said Heimbach's father, Edward.
"And I shouted 'move, move' and then the chimney
fell in." He was not injured.
It was one sample of a blast of violent springtime
thunderstorms that stretched from Arkansas up the
Ohio Valley, including a dozen or more tornadoes in
central Illinois.
Three inches of rain fell in two to three hours yes
terday in southeastern Ohio's Meigs County, caus
ing flooding that forced at least 80 people from their
homes.
Tornadoes touched down in at least six Indiana
counties, said Alden Taylor, a spokesman for the
state Emergency Management Agency. A tornado
touched down on Indianapolis' northeast side, the
Marion County Sheriffs Department said.
The National Weather Service had not yet con
firmed yesterday afternoon whether the Indiana
damage was done by tornadoes.
Heimbach, 42, ran the family farm just south of
Linnsburg, a town of about 500 people 40 miles west
of Indianapolis.
He and Kelp, 36, had planned to marry, Heim
bach's mother said yesterday.
"They were talking about this summer, sometime
in the summer," said Jean Heimbach, who was hit
on the head by a brick from the falling chimney but
not seriously injured.

Kelp's 11-year-old daughter from a previous mar
riage was staying with her father for the weekend,
she said.
At least 10 other houses in the same county suf
fered extensive damage or were destroyed, Mont
gomery County Sheriff John Dale said.
One 93-year-old man was hospitalized with a
head injury.
Officials in Miami County reported wind gusts of
almost 140 mph at Grissom Air Force Base.
There were numerous unconfirmed reports of
tornadoes in western and northern Kentucky, along
with hail and wind damage. One man was hospital
ized in serious condition after he was struck by
lightning.
In Vine Grove, Ky., Charles Rutledge didn't have
time to go to the window to see what was happening.
"Before I made it, the roof was blown off the
house. I dove under the bed," Rutledge said
The 12 to 15 tornadoes that whipped through
central Illinois late Saturday damaged scores of
homes but no deaths or serious injuries were report
ed.
Thunderstorms rolled across northern Arkansas
Saturday night, dumping heavy rain and large hail
in spots. The weather service confirmed a tornado
touched down near Gentry, and funnel clouds were
sighted elsewhere, but no serious injuries were
reported.
Up to five inches of rain fell in parts of Tennessee.
High water in West Virginia blocked some secondary
roads.
Lightning at Clarksburg, W.Va., struck the 911
emergency communications center.
"It hit us good, blew up a couple of our phones,"
Lt. Mary Hardman said.
