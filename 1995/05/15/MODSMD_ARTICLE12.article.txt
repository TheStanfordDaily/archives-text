KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) - Three
new confirmed cases of the deadly Ebola
virus, all of them in Kikwit, were report
ed yesterday, said Richard Leclair of the
World Health Organization in Geneva,
bringing the total to 79.
Of those cases, 59 have died, includ
ing a fourth Italian nun who was caring
for Ebola patients at Kikwit General
Hospital.
Cases have been confirmed in the vil
lages of Musango, Vanga, Yassa Bonga
and Kenge, according to an internation
al committee overseeing the response to
the outbreak. Kenge is 125 miles east of
Kinshasha and more than halfway along
the main road from Kikwit to the capital.
Kikwit, a city of 600,000, has been
quarantined. Health workers were mov
ing into the area yesterday to dispel fears,
inform people how to avoid contracting
Ebola and try to trace people who were in
Kikwit's hospital but have left.
"The total number of cases and
deaths will be increasing," as more peo
ple are traced, WHO spokesman Valery
Abramov said in Geneva. Leclair said
health workers are covering Kikwit
street by street to persuade possible vic
tims to report to the hospital.
The United States government
donated $25,000 of medical supplies,
including blood plasma and protective
clothing, which arrived in Kinshasa yes
terday.
There is no vaccine or cure for Ebola,
which kills 80 percent of those who con
tract it, usually within days. Victims
suffer from violent diarrhea and vomit
ing and finally die with blood pouring
from their eyes, ears and noses.
Specialists from the WHO, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Preven
tion, France's Pasteur Institute and
South Africa's National Institute for
Virology will first try to prevent Ebola's
spread — cool off the hot zone, as they
say.
