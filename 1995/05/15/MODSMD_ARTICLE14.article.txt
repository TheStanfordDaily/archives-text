CONVICTED criminal Jed
Harlan Miller was sen
tenced last week to spend
from 25 years to the rest of his
natural life in a California state
penitentiary — for stealing a bike
from Stanford.
The first person in Santa Clara
County to be sentenced under Cal
ifornia's "three strikes and you're
out" law, Miller will spend at least
a quarter century in the stir,
although his crimes are bike theft,
residential burglary and a knife
fight (in which Miller was wound
ed).
This incident should remind
Stanford students of two valuable
lessons. One is to always lock your
bike, because there are plenty of
Jed Harlan Millers our there. The
University has been conscientious
in providing many new bike racks
students can use to secure their
vehicles. Use them.
Also make sure to always lock
your bike to something immobile,

such as a rack or a tree. Use a
strong lock, like a U-lock. If your
bike is really valuable, take it
inside. When students are careless
about locking their bikes —
including the "I'm-just-going-in
for-15-minutes" justification —
they must shoulder some of the
practical responsibility for the loss
of their bikes.
The other lesson for all stu
dents is that sometimes, due to
overreactions, a solution can be
worse than the problem it aims to
solve. It is ridiculous to send a
man to jail for 25 years for steal
ing a bicycle. Even the judge who
sentenced Miller, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Teilh, said the sentencing
rule was "unfortunate" in this
instance.
It is generally best to try to be
moderate, especially in the face of
hysteria. Unfortunately, Miller
will suffer from this excessive
measure.
