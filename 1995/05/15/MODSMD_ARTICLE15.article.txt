# Campus' wild beauty

STANFORD IS beautiful.
Other schools may be able to
compete with us on the basis
of academic quality, student satis
faction, reputation and other
areas. Surely, though, this is the
most aesthetically pleasing uni
versity in America.
From the gentle rolling of the
foothills to the architectural har
mony of the buildings, Stanford
has a unique grace. And what
introduction to a campus could be
more appealing than the trip up
Palm Drive, where palm trees
frame the rising mosaic of Memo
rial Church with the hills in the
background, usually under a rib
bon of beautiful blue sky?
In recent months, however, the
campus has been more lovely than
ever, graced by an abundance of
wildflowers. Springing up in
bountiful reds and oranges — and
of course the unique shimmering
shade of the California Golden
Poppy — these homegrown plants

make the Farm even more pleas
ing. As street dividers overflow
with the blooms to bring a tear to
Lady Bird Johnson's eye, the
daily lives of students, faculty and
staff become more pleasant.
Oh, all right, it has exacerbated
what is already a bad year for
pollen. And yes, some people who
love the flowers pick them, not
realizing how inconsiderate that
act is to the rest of us.
These complaints all pale next
to the vibrant blossoms. The gor
geous array of flowers now filling
the campus actually make this
year's massive rainfall feel worth
every drop.
Hearty congratulations, then,
to the grounds-keepers who help
provide and maintain this
bravura performance of Mother
Nature's glory.
With everyone here leading a
too-busy life, it really is a treat
to be able to stop and view the
flowers.
