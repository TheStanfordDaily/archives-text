'Outing' deprives gays and lesbians of privacy and dignity

Michelangelo signoriie, the
keynote BGLAD speaker at
Stanford two weeks ago, shows
a careless disregard and insensitivity
for the highly personal issue of sexuali
ty. I find it disappointing that a rabble
rouser like Signoriie continues to find
such important platforms, such as our
campus, for his self-righteous and divi
sive views. The process of coming to
terms with, and indeed the realization
of, one's sexual orientation can be a
long, painful and complicated process
for some people. Individuals like Signo
riie find it acceptable to dismiss this
and politicize the lives of others for
what they consider to be in the "best

interest" of gays everywhere. His clever
attempts to justify the "outing" of
prominent individuals as a way of
achieving gay acceptance and equality
in our society is laughable.
When prominent individuals are
forced out of the closet under duress
from an angry journalist, it reflects
poorly on both the intolerance of
American society and the strain of
individuals in the gay community that
take the low road in challenging this
intolerance. The outing of gay celebri
ties does achieve visibility for the gay
subculture. However, the selfish
nature of this outing tramples on the
choice of all individuals to express

their sexual orientation in ways that
m?y differ from what Signorile per
ceives as acceptable. The sociopolitical,
yet personal, significance of coming
out is then easily reduced to a sensa
tional and impersonal media headline
at the expense of individual human
dignity.
How can Signorile claim to be fight
ing for a more tolerant and inclusive
society, when he so callously tries to
take this dignity from the gay men and
women he claims to represent? I firmly
believe that the closet is something that
"needs to be broken down," but Signo
rile's solution is indeed "violent, nasty
and separate" for those gays that don't

accept his dogma.
The gains that lesbians, gays and
bisexuals have made in recent years
occurred not because of our disregard
for the rights of others but because of
our resolve in uniting and acting as a
diverse and tolerant community. If we
hope to achieve substantive equality
and justice through honorable and self
respecting means, we must all have the
essential and deliberative choice of
determining when and how we voice
our sexual orientation to families, co
workers, friends, neighbors and
acquaintances.
