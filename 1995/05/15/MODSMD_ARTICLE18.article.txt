## Looking for peace of mind 
### 
"I refuse to accept the cynical notion
that nation after nation must spiral down
a militaristic stairway into the hell of
thermonuclear destruction. I believe that
unarmed truth and unconditional love
will have the final word in reality. This is
why right temporarily defeated is
stronger than evil triumphant."
— Martin Luther King, Jr.
THE CASCADING water surround
ing these words in the Yerba Buena
Memorial in San Francisco sweeps
us away. Contrary realities of the world
escape our thoughts for a moment as we
stand there, soaking in Dr. King's vision.
Perhaps that is all it can ever be — a
vision never realized, an ideal revered for
its potential. As we walk away and the
moment of inspiration passes, we must
face a world which falls far short of Mar
tin Luther King's dream.
The same question plagues each indi
vidual who walks away from the memo
rial: Why cannot the world reflect my
desire for peace? It makes intuitive
sense that if enough people feel the
same way, then it will be so. Even when
we admit our collective imperfection,
does the world necessarily need to have
such tragic manifestations as war?
These are simple, yet compelling
questions. When we are young, the
questions are innocent. It seems that
the younger one is, the greater one's
confidence in the probability of peace.
Even those in war-torn corners of the

world — whether it be Bosnia, Haiti or
inner-city L.A. — express hope-filled
dreams for a peaceful tomorrow. When
we are older, the questions are catego
rized as naive. Scholars and people who
have just plain lived through many
times of war give compelling systemic
explanations as to why the world cannot
be peaceful. Becoming cognizant of our
own shortcomings and being able to
read the front page of newspapers turns
us all into cynics, or at least cautious
optimists. Reality is inescapable: The
world will always have many pockets
devoid of peace.
Equally inescapable is the reality of
millions of people who have shared in
the vision for peace. These people come
from all walks of life, all parts of the
world, all age groups. There's the Viet
nam veteran who never wants anyone to
have to experience the horrors of war.
There's me, the present-day college stu
dent who's never lived anywhere near a
war zone or faced a draft for war. There
are the kids around the world who live
the daily terrors of war and violence.
There are army generals, politicians,
decorated veterans, arms contractors
and non-violent protesters. Not many
would disagree to living in a world of
peace.
The recent celebration of the Allied
victory in World War II reminds us of
our dilemma. The contemporary leaders
of the victorious countries united to
reflect back 50 years to the end of the

last world war. It is almost certain that
during state dinners and commemora
tive addresses, these heads-of-state were
wondering why we have failed in the
time since VE-Day to collectively con
struct a more peaceful world.
And it is only fitting that the civil
conflict in Chechnya would share center
spotlight with the U.S.-Russian remem
brance of WWII. What can sLop the
tanks of political repression? We'd like
to believe Bill and Boris and the leaders
of the Chechnyan opposition cculd just
sit down together and work it out.
That's not a silly idea, just confidence in
the power of honest dialogue between
humans.
I cannot give any sort of conclusive
prescription for the world we inhabit.
Martin Luther King, Jr., offers the most
comforting insight in the final part of
his words above. Hope hinges on believ
ing that the current situation — no mat
ter how bleak — is temporary. For Dr.
King, this world offered small victories
and gradual improvements. Despite all
that he did to bring about peace, he
never stopped insisting that certainty
only rests in the kingdom come, when
all the colors bleed into one.

Aaron thanks the Dr. Kings of this
world for inspiring us to rise up and
reach for possibilities.
