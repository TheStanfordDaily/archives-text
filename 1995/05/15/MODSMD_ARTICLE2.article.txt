# Harassment's prominence
## Med School may see more cases because of job's nature, or reports may be high due to school's size and openness 
### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
The recent settlements of two sexual harassment
suits filed by female staff members in the School of
Medicine have once again brought sexual harass
ment — and specifically harassment within the Med
ical School — into the public spotlight.
The Medical School has been plagued by negative
publicity surrounding several cases of sexual harass
ment ever since Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Conley
accused Neurosurgery Prof. Gerald Silverberg of ha
rassment in 1991.
Although sexual harassment within the Medical
School has received great attention over the past sev
eral years, publicized reports of sexual harassment
within other schools and departments at Stanford
have been virtually nonexistent.

Administrators say that despite the negative pub
licity associated with the recent settlements of cases
against now-retired Psychiatry Prof. Seymour
Levine and Urology Prof. Thomas Stamey, combat
ing harassment at the Medical School will take time.
They cite more basic factors, such as the very nature
of the medical profession, to explain the Medical
School's particular problems.
First-hand observations
The deans and student affairs coordinators of var
ious schools at Stanford have wide-ranging opinions
concerning the prevalence of sexual harassment
within different schools and departments.
"The problem of sexual harassment occurs all
over society — in all organizations and institutions,"
said Medical School Dean David
Korn, who dealt with the past
harassment complaints in the
Medical School. "The mythology of
bias is part of human culture.
"I don't believe [the Medical
School] is alone," Korn continued.
"In other places, the problems stay
deeply covered up — people don't
report 'harassment.'"
Korn expressed the belief that
other schools, such as the School of
Engineering, also experience sexu
al harassment.
Noe Lozano, associate dean and
coordinator for affirmative action
and minority programs in the
Engineering School, said that sexu
al harassment is not a large prob
lem within the school.
"The number of [sexual harass
ment complaints] coming my way
is very small," Lozano said. "It is
not in a critical range.
"If I had [received] 10 cases, I
would have stopped in my tracks,"
he said. "But there has been no
cause to be alarmed."
Constance Hellyer, communica
tions director of the Law School,
also reported few sexual harass
ment problems within the Law
School.
"Sexual harassment is not a
great problem," she said. "I can't
say that it has never happened —
one student wrote a letter. But I
am not aware of any formal com

plaints."
She said that since students and
faculty within the Law School
study and teach the law, they are
not likely to break it.
Psychiatry Prof. Laraine Zap
pert, the University's sexual
harassment policy coordinating
adviser, cautioned individuals to
look at the size of a school before
drawing conclusions about the
prevalence of sexual harassment.
"The Medical School is so much
larger [than other schools at Stan
ford] — it is a city unto itself," she
said. Zappert said that statistically,
the larger number of individuals
would tend to translate into a larg
er number of complaints.
A history of harassment
Over the last several years, the
Medical School has been plagued
by charges of harassment against
members of its faculty.
At the end of April, the Univer
sity settled two sexual harassment
cases filed by female Medical
School staff members. Helen Bae, a
former lab assistant, accused
Levine of sexual harassment.
Another female staff member filed
a separate case against Stanley.
Under the terms of the settle
ment, Bae was awarded between
$100,000 and $700,000. Stamey
will face financial penalties and has
lost his chairmanship of the urolo
gy department. Stanley has denied
any wrongdoing.
In early 1994, a sexual harass
ment case filed by a Medical Center
administrative assistant against

Ophthalmology Prof. Richard Sogg
was settled.
In 1991, the same year as Con
ley's case, two students accused
Prof. Mark Perlroth, a cardiologist,
of harassment. Perlroth was disci
plined in an undisclosed manner.
Unique medical environment
Administrators have formed
several hypotheses as to why sexu
al harassment seems to occur in
the Medical School more than in
other places.
"You have got a profession —
the medical profession," Korn
explained. "And within that profes
sion, you have academic institu
tions. And all of it has a white,
male-dominated, very hierarchical
history.
"The Medical School is much
more hierarchical than other
schools in the University," Korn
said.
Korn explained that in other
schools, department chairs have
limited turns and rotate. He said
that people in other schools do not
want the positions; they simply act
out of service to their departments.
In the Medical School the situa
tion is different. The department
chair positions are "still veiy long
term, powerful and authoritative,"
said Korn.
Charlotte Jacobs, senior associ
ate dean for student affairs at the
Medical School, echoed the belief
that the medical environment is
more hierarchical than some other
fields.
"Sexual harassment is about

power — not about sex," she said.
"In the whole medical establish
ment, there is certainly the oppor
tunity to abuse power.
"Physicians are responsible for
the lives of individuals," Jacobs

continued.
"There is more
opportunity,
more mindset,
for the power
potential."
Korn also
expressed the
belief that the
school's indepen
dent "effort to

take the lid off the problem" led to
increased reports of sexual
harassment.
When Conley "made her dis
tress public, [the Medical School]
hired an outside consulting firm
specifically to help deal with issues
of violence and insensitivity," Korn
explained.
"At the time we engaged the
firm, the senior person of the firm
warned me and my colleagues that
by focusing the spotlight on the
issue, by putting the authority of
the dean's office [behind the
issue], we were going to have a lit
tle epidemic of incidents," Korn
said.
Conley's the case gained
national media attention after
she resigned. Silverberg, who had
been under consideration for the
chair of the department, was not
named to the position.
Since then, the Medical School
has initiated numerous sensitivity

training sessions and workshops
addressing issues related to work
place diversity.
Lozano also said that because
Conley has been such a visible
advocate of sexual harassment
awareness — she helped push for
the University-wide sexual harass
ment policy approved in 1993 —
the number of complaints at the
Medical School may be greater
than in other schools.
Jacobs said that "in the School
of Medicine, people may feel more
comfortable to come forward."
Even though women make up
one-third to one-half of every Med
ical School class, according to
Korn, very few women belong to
the faculty. Currently, 97 of the
513 Medical School professors are
women.
"As long as the faculty stays
masculine," he said, "problems will
continue. We must change the fac
ulty. When those victimized
[become empowered], they are no
longer quiet victims."
Truth in numbers
Partly in response to the Conley
case, the University established a
sexual harassment policy in Octo
ber 1993 to resolve harassment
cases.
In early 1994, the University
created a panel to implement the
policy. Zappert was named as the
coordinating adviser and now leads
a panel of faculty and staff mem
bers that disseminates information
about sexual harassment and takes
action to resolve complaints.

According to the policy, the
duties of the coordinating adviser
also include maintaining records of
every complaint — including the
names of the complainant and the
accused — and transmitting an
annual report to the University
president of the number of charges
made.
Although Zappert has prepared
the 1994-95 breakdown of harass
ment complaints by school for Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper,
the statistics have not been
released because Casper has yet to
review the report.
The President's Office has con
cluded that reviewing the report is
not a high priority, according to
Jean Fetter, assistant to the presi
dent.
"Yes, it is true that Laraine Zap
pert has compiled data," Fetter
said. "But reviewing the report is
not high on President Casper's pri
ority list — especially at the end of
Spring Quarter.
"We think it is unreasonable to
release the report . . . before
[Casper] has had a chance to
review it," she concluded.
Although both Zappert and Fet
ter said that the report is ready for
Casper's review, University Com
munications Director Terry Shep
ard later said the final report has
not been prepared.
According to Shepard, Zappert
is "still working on the report." He
added that the preliminary report
is complete but that Zappert wants
to make further changes before
submitting a final draft.
