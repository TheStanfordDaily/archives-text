# Harassment's prominence
## Med School may see more cases because of job's nature, or reports may be high due to school's size and openness 
### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
The recent settlements of two sexual harassment
suits filed by female staff members in the School of
Medicine have once again brought sexual harass
ment — and specifically harassment within the Med
ical School — into the public spotlight.
The Medical School has been plagued by negative
publicity surrounding several cases of sexual harass
ment ever since Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Conley
accused Neurosurgery Prof. Gerald Silverberg of ha
rassment in 1991.
Although sexual harassment within the Medical
School has received great attention over the past sev
eral years, publicized reports of sexual harassment
within other schools and departments at Stanford
have been virtually nonexistent.

Administrators say that despite the negative pub
licity associated with the recent settlements of cases
against now-retired Psychiatry Prof. Seymour
Levine and Urology Prof. Thomas Stamey, combat
ing harassment at the Medical School will take time.
They cite more basic factors, such as the very nature
of the medical profession, to explain the Medical
School's particular problems.
First-hand observations
The deans and student affairs coordinators of var
ious schools at Stanford have wide-ranging opinions
concerning the prevalence of sexual harassment
within different schools and departments.
"The problem of sexual harassment occurs all
over society — in all organizations and institutions,"
