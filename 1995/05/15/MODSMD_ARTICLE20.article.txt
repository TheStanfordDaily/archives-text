# 'We can dance in the rain'
## Rainy weather doesn't slow Native American Powwow 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Despite unseasonably cold weather,
thousands of visitors came to campus
this weekend to participate in the 24th
Annual Stanford Powwow, which
focused on celebrating Native American
youth.
Though unable to give exact figures,
Denni Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian Program Office,
said she was confident that this year's
attendance would meet or exceed last
year's total of 30,000 people.
The turnout early Saturday after
noon was a bit light, but it peaked later
on, as it did today," said Woodward. "But
attendance has been high all throughout

the Powwow."
Woodward said that while the weather
affected when people attended, it likely
did not affect people's decision to attend.
She jokingly brushed aside the inconve
nience caused by the rain and cold by say
ing, "We can dance in the rain."
The Powwow, held on the intramural
fields next to Stanford Stadium, featured
hundreds of dancers and several
renowned drum groups from across the
nation. Many attendees dressed in tradi
tional Native American clothing to reflect
their heritage and cultural pride.
While some came to perform, many
others came to explore Native American
culture.
"It's the best event at Stanford all
year," said senior Beth Colgan. "The

dancers are amazing.... I have never
missed it in my four years here at Stan
ford."
A variety of arts and crafts booths sold
Native American handicrafts and jewelry
— everything from colorful patterned
blankets to ornate turquoise bracelets.
One notable piece of artwork was a
print done by nationally acclaimed
Native American artist Donald Vann. A
Cherokee from Oklahoma, Vann created
a limited edition print to commemorate
the weekend'B event. The serene print
features a lone buffalo looking over the
plains during sunset.
In addition to the many arts and
crafts booths, there were several booths
set up by local Native American support
organizations providing information

ranging from job and educational
opportunities to drug and AIDS coun
seling.
"Our goal is to let [Native Americans]
know that there are resources out there
for them," said Jamie Willmes, chair of
Stanford's American Indian staff forum.
Helen Waukazoo, the executive direc
tor of the Friendship House in San Fran
cisco — a drug and alcohol abuse treat
ment program that combines Western
and traditional approaches — said her
group attended to inform Powwow guests
about this resource for Native Ameri
cans.
"We are in danger of being closed
down if we don't make our building com
pletely handicap accessible. We are also
here to solicit funds for that purpose,"

said Waukazoo.
Even representatives from Stanford's
archrival came across the Bay to partici
pate in this year's Powwow.
"We had a powwow in April, but it
wasn't nearly as big or long as this one,"
said Dewey St. Germaine, a student
affairs officer in charge of American Indi
an recruitment for UC-Berkeley.
"We're trying to convince (Native
American) students to come across the
Bay for graduate studies. We recruit cam
pus-wide for all the grad schools, every
thing from public health to law," St. Ger
maine said.
Powwow volunteer Rich Stolz said
that even with the rain, the"event went
well and people seemed to be enjoying
themselves."
