The Hoover Institution
recently announced the 12 recipi
ents of the National and Peace
Fellowships for 1995-96.
Started in 1971 under the
leadership of then-Hoover direc
tor W. Glenn Campbell, the
Hoover fellowships provide schol
ars with the opportunity to con
duct independent research on
current public policy issues at the
institution.
The National Fellowship
recipients are Kathleen Bawn,
lan Bremmer, Charles Cameron,
Jennifer Hunt, Peter Lewis, Vin
cente Madrigal, Jongryn Mo,
Harry Paarsch, Sunita Parikh,
Curtis Taylor and Ingrid Werner.
The Peace Fellowship recipient
this year is Jessica Stern.
Applicants for the fellowship
— scholars from various institu
tions — each submitted a propos
al and letters of recommendation
in January. Thomas Henriksen,
Hoover associate director, said
the review of proposals was "a
very selective process. We had
about 80 applicants this year."
Senior Hoover fellows and
Hoover research fellows review

the proposals for research pro
jects and choose 12 of them.
"The direction of these projects
is determined solely by the fel
lowship recipients," Henriksen
said.
For example, next year Stern
will focus on nuclear smuggling
in Russia, and Paarsch will exam
ine the effects of minimum wage
legislation.
Over the past 20 years of the
program, about 10 percent of the
recipients have been Stanford
faculty members, said Wendy
Minkin, Henriksen's assistant.
The recipients are given a
stipend for living and travel
expenses which allows them to
focus on their research for a year.
They often work closely with res
ident and visiting scholars in the
institution, according to Hoover
Director John Raisian.
"The fellowships have
immense value because they
bring some of the most talented
junior academics to Stanford,"
said Henriksen.
"The fellows add to the discus
sion of public policy," Minkin
added. "They lead to a better
understanding of the historical
issues of the 20th Century."
