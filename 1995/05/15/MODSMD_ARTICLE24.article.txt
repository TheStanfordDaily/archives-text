## NCAA Tennis Championships Women triumph in nail-biter Doubles team of Berris and Scott comes up big against UCLA 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
MALIBU, Calif. — With raised arms
and an embrace of relief, freshman Julie
Scott and junior Beth Berris yesterday
ended the title hopes of UCLA (15-9)
and sent the Stanford women's tennis
squad (23-2) into the semifinals of the
NCAA championships.
The victory of the Cardinal's No. 3
doubles squad clinched the 5-4, six-and
a-half hour duel against the Bruins.
Scott and Berris came through with a 5-
7, 6-2, 6-0 triumph over their UCLA
counterparts Paige Yaroshuk and Diana
Spadea. Tied up 4-4 going into that
third doubles match, Stanford needed
Scott and Berris to pull through, and
pull through they did.
The pair had been there before.
Three weeks ago in Berkeley, the duo
faced triple-match point against Cal
which would have given the dual match
to the Golden Bears. The Cardinal
refused to fold, however, pulling off a
miraculous comeback to sweep the sea
son series versus Cal.
Thus, the Cardinal had reason to be
confident in the crew that set out to
determine their faith and refused to let
them forget about that day, screaming
"Remember Cal" throughout the
match. "I think Julie and I play our best
under pressure," said Berris. "I was
glad we were the ones in the position. I
was kind of nervous in the first game,
but after that I really wasn't nervous
because I knew we play really well when
they have to."
Berris and Scott came perilously
close to not having that opportunity as
the Stanford's No. 1 doubles squad of
sophomore Katie Schlukebir and fresh
men Ania Bleszynski previously pulled
off a miracle of their own. Down 6-2, 2-
6, 5-1 in the third set of the match ver
sus UCLA's highly touted tandem of
Keri Phebus and Susie Starrett, the
Cardinal earned a break at 5-1 and slow
ly began to gain momentum. Points
turned into games, and soon the match

had entered a tie-breaker.
"We needed to play every point," said
Schlukebir. "I knew we need to win two
doubles matches, but we just wanted to
win as many points as we could. You
could see that they were cracking."
With the No. 1 match in a third set
tie-breaker and the No. 2 team of red
shirt senior Kim Shasby and sopho
more Emily Burt down 6-4, 5-0,
prospects of the Cardinal's advance
ment still looked grim. However, three
UCLA double faults and error-free ten
nis from Bleszynski and Schlukebir
combined for a Stanford win and threw
Berris and Scott onto center stage. "It
was one of those matches that went up
and down and sideways," said head
coach Frank Brennan. "This No. 1 dou
bles team, that kind of did it. They
were not favored in that match, and
they came back after two tough singles
matches, and got down 5-1 in the third
set. Psychologically, that's huge to be
able come back and do that. They've
got good character; they don't like to
lose."
"For me, I saw them [Bleszynski and
Schlukebir], and I realized that they had
created magic on the court. I mean
that's incredible 5-1 in the third," Scott
said. "I definitely thought that after
they had done so well, after watching
what they did out there, there was no
way I could lose."
The outcome remained far from cer
tain, however, in spite of Berris and
Scott's experience in such matches.
After jumping out to a 5-2 lead in the
first set, the Cardinal faithful watched

it slip away in what could have been
another tide-turning comeback.
Yaroshuk and Spadea took the set 7-5.
The pair found themselves down again
at 2-1 in the second set. Yet they held
serve and went on to take the next 11
games for the match. With a 6-0 third
set, the nail in the coffin may have been
the fifth game. Yaroshuk had the serve
with a 40-15 lead in the game, yet Berris
and Scott fought back for the break,
highlighted by a point in which Scott
pounded five consecutive overhead vol
leys at the Bruins.
Thus, as if to dispel the critics who
counted out the Cardinal from day one
because of its youth and inexperience,
two freshmen came through under
incredible pressure. "You know fresh
men who aren't good and freshmen who
don't have great character, lose singles
and tank doubles and can't do it for
whatever reason," Brennan said. "Ania
looks at you and says, 'Don't worry, I'm
not done today.' And Julie is extremely
courageous."
Scott credited the seasoned Berris,
who has two trips to the NCAA finals
under her belt, for helping to keep her
loose. "It was wonderful to have her
there. She really kept me down to
earth."
Previous to the onset of the deciding
match, Burt and Shasby had dropped
their match 6-4, 6-0 to a nationally top
ranked squad of Jane and Stephanie
Chi.
The contest entered doubles notched
up at three. Up front, the Bruins explod
ed all over the Cardinal's Nos. 1 and 2
competitors. Phebus, No. 1, and Chi,
No. 2, who have been rated in the top
three all season long, gave UCLA two
early points. Phebus rolled over
Schlukebir, 6-1,6-1, before the Stanford
Ail-American could make any adjust
ments in her approach. Chi did the same
to Bleszynski, winning 6-2, 6-0.
Stanford's No. 6 competitor, redshirt
senior Amy Chiminello, gave the Cardi-
