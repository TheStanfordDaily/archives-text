# Men vanquish the Bulldogs
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — When people talk about cutting
through the Georgia air with a knife, they are usually
talking about the humidity. But this weekend they
were also talking about the tension in the air surround
ing the first two rounds of the NCAA Men's Tennis
Championships, where top-ranked Stanford (25-0)
breathed a sigh of relief only after two near upsets by
sleeper teams from No. 9 Duke (23-4) and No. 7 Missis
sippi State (18-6).
The final scores — a 4-1 first-round victory over the
Blue Devils on Saturday and a 4-0 quarterfinal win over
the Bulldogs yesterday — did not indicate how tightly
contested both matches really were.
The first scare actually came when the seedings were
announced last week. Duke inexplicably received a 13
through 16 seeding despite its year-long top 10 ranking.
For both the Cardinal and the Blue Devils, this signaled
an upcoming confrontation tougher than could normal
ly be expected from a first-round opponent.
"When we had to play Duke last year in the second
round, I was extremely nervous," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "When I saw we were playing them
in the first round this year and that they had the same
team from last year, I'm going, 'Oh, my gosh.' Their
players play a style of play I have a lot of respect for.
Their guys come at you and they never stop. Duke has
the kind of team that is capable of winning the tourna
ment."
Duke's head coach Jay Lapidus was even more upset

about the seeding.
"I thought it was ridiculous," said Lapidus. "We'd
been ranked between five and five through the season.
Obviously I was furious. But we have to talk with our
rackets and we didn't do it. I don't know why we have
rankings if we don't even use them at the end of the
season. I have had at least five or six coaches come up
to me and tell me that was really ridiculous."
Though the Cardinal dismissed the Blue Devils from
postseason competition for the second consecutive year,
the result could have been much different had just a
few points turned out the other way.
The story of Saturday's match was Stanford's hard
won doubles point. The Cardinal first suffered a quick
setback in No. 1 doubles when Duke's No. 14 duo of
Rob Chess and Peter Ayers capitalized on an early
break to defeat the No. 2 team of freshmen Scott
Humphries and Paul Goldstein for the second time this
season, 8-6.


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Junior Jim Thomas and his doubles partner, junior Ricky Becker, put the hurt on their Blue Devil counter
parts on Saturday. The team advanced to today's semifinal with wins over Duke and Mississippi State.
"We had been warned by the
coaches to put the pressure on,"
Humphries said. "They jumped on
us early and rode that throughout
the match."
Needing just one more doubles
win to secure the doubles point,
however, Duke could not pull it off
even though they were "in the
matches" remaining to be decided;
the score of the No. 2 doubles match
stood at 6-6 while the No. 3 doubles
match was also deadlocked, 7-7.
First the No. 54 tandem of
juniors Jim Thomas and Ricky
Becker negotiated a 8-6 victory over
the No. 40 team of Phillippe Moggio
and Chris Pressley. A double fault
gave Stanford a break that put
them up 7-6 and from there
Thomas served out the match.
When all eyes turned to the No.
3 doubles match, they witnessed a
tie-break comeback more enormous
than the budget of nearby Atlanta's
Olympic planning committee. Afler
falling behind 5-1 in the tiebreak of
the rubber match, the Cardinal's
Jeff Salzenstein and Grant Elliott
reeled off six consecutive points to
seize the match, the doubles point
and the momentum going into sin
gles.
"When we were down 5-1 [assis
tant coach John] Whitflinger] told
me to really concentrate on this
point," said Salzenstein, a junior. "I
knew if I could return well, I'd be
serving twice more. Basically I was
taking it one point at a time."
Lapidus placed some of the
blame on his team, but gave Stan
ford a lot of credit for the comeback.

"When we were up 5-1 we played
kind of a tight volley to make it 5-2.
Then they hit a couple of good
returns and serves. At that point
it's anybody's match. But that's
why they're always in the finals
year after year. They always come
up with big stufT and big shots.
They come up with the goods."
In singles Stanford would need
the big shots because the Blue Dev
ils still had some fire left in their
bellies even if a dagger had already
been driven through their hearts by
the doubles loss. Singles action pro
gressed through the first sets on
courts 2 and 3 and 4 but just as
rapidly dropped the initial sets on
courts 1 and 6, where Elliott pulled
out a first set tie-breaker, 7-3.
No. 41 Goldstein wrapped up his
match first, defeating No. 93 Ayers,
6-1, 6-2 in No. 3 singles. But No. 6
Salzenstein then dropped the No. 1
match to No. 15 Pressley, 6-3, 6-3.
No. 10 Humphries gave the Car
dinal a 3-1 advantage with a 6-3, 6-
3 triumph over No. 25 Chess.
But the needed fourth point
would prove difficult to attain for
the Cardinal. Becker was about to
force a third set at No. 6. Elliott was
down a break in his second set. No.
65 Thomas seemed the best candi
date to clinch for the Cardinal, lead
ing 4-1 in the second set after tak
ing the first 6-2.
But Thomas' No. 4 singles oppo
nent, Adam Gusky, would not fold.
He broke Thomas while the Cardi
nal junior was serving for the
match at 5-4, and after that any
outcome seemed possible in that
match.
"I saw Jim get broken while
serving for the match," Elliott said.
"At that point, I said, 'OK, It's
gonna be me. I'm gonna have to
clinch the match.' "

Elliott was already back on serve
when he decided to bear down. He
and his opponent, Moggio, plodded
toward a tie-break, where Elliott
took charge, winning 7-2 to
advance the Cardinal into the sec
ond round.
In his team's postmortem,
Lapidus largely attributed the Blue
Devil defeat to the disappointment
of losing the doubles point.
"We were really down on our
selves after doubles," Lapidus said.
"Realistically, it is only one point,
but it is a real momentum killer,
especially when you are up one
match and don't pull it out."
Against Mississippi State the Cardi
nal again faced a tough test in both
doubles and singles. The Bulldogs
feature the 1994 NCAA doubles
champions, Laurent Miquelard and
Joe Simmons. In addition, their No.
1 singles player, Laurent Orsini,
was the No. 1 player in the nation
for five months before sitting out
fall of 1994 to perform military obli
gations in his native France. The
'Dawgs are also a senior-heavy,
mostly foreign team that nearly
defeated the Cardinal at last year's
National Indoor Championships,
losing only after Thomas pulled out
a third-set tie-break in the last
match that day.
Once again on Sunday, Stanford
needed a third-set tie-break victory
in the doubles rubber match to
secure the first point. And again it
was Salzenstein and Elliott provid
ing the last-match heroics.
Spring showers moved the play
indoors from Henry Field Stadium
to the unbearably stuffy but drier
confines of the Hopkins Indoor
Center for most of the doubles
action and all of the singles match
es. Only the top two singles match
es could be played indoors — UCIA

and South Alabama were playing
their doubles matches on the other
two indoor courts — while the No.
3 doubles players waited in the
wings for the call, if they were need
ed for a rubber match.
"Coming inside was a big advan
tage for IStanfordJ because they are
an attacking team," said Mississip
pi State head coach Andy Jackson.
"That's why they're undefeated.
Outdoors we might have scored
some points, but maybe not."
Humphries and Goldstein began
the scoring for the Cardinal with an
8-6 victory over No. 32 Miquelard
and Kristian Broems. That cleared
the court for Salzen.stein and Elliott
to resume their match, which they
were leading 3-2 over Orsini and
Mattias Karlsson when the rains
had come.
Meanwhile, Becker and Thomas
were trying to clinch the doubles
point on the adjacent court against
Simmons and Matt Pledger. But
the Cardinal tandem was broken in
all four of their last service games
by the Bulldogs, who were also bro
ken several times but still took the
match 8-6.
Prospects were gloomy for Stan
ford after Elliott was broken while
serving at 7-7. But serving for the
match, the Bulldogs were unable to
capitalize on a 30-0 lead, as Salzen
stein and Elliott fought back with
solid returns of serve, sharp-angled
volleys, and sure-handed over
heads. The pivotal tie-break was all
Cardinal, as an Elliott overhead
gave Stanford a 9-8 (7-2) victory.
When singles got underway, lim
ited court availability allowed only
the top four singles matches to be
played in Hopkins Center. If Stan
ford could not win three out of
those four, then the remaining two
matches would be played.

Stanford got another quick vic
tory from Goldstein, who defeated
Miquelard, 6-3,6-3.
Thomas racked up Stanford's
next point, a 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) defeat of
Thomas Dupre. The match includ
ed a rare point penalty assessed by
rule against Dupre because he was
overruled by the chair umpire on
three separate occasions. The point
gave Thomas a gift game midway
through the second set as he was
serving at 30-30 when Dupre was
overruled and assessed the penalty.
Dupre also lost a point for racket
abuse later in the set.
"He gave me a whole game,"
Thomas said. "It's nice to get free
points. I'm never not gonna take
'em. It was also rtice to finish a
match and win, since I didn't finish
the match [on Saturday] and we
hadn't played in three weeks."
Now only Humphries or Salzen
stein needed to win in order to
clinch the victory. But there was
still some drama left in this match.
Humphries was down a break in
his third set. Elliott, who had
already begun his match on the
court vacated by Goldstein, was
down a break in his first set. And
Salzenstein had split with Orsini
and was involved in a nip and tick
battle with the Frenchman who
seemed to have a penchant for mak
ing disputed calls and also for dis
puting Salzenstein's calls.
A highly questionable one
occurred with Salzenstein leading
5-3 in the final set. With his back
against the wall, Orsini called a
Salzenstein kick serve out despite
the fact that the ball appeared to
land one inch inside the corner of
the service line. When Salzenstein's
request for an overrule was denied
by the chair umpire — whose chair
was on the side of the disputed call

— the junior captain cried out in
disbelief, "That was the best serve
of my life!" Orsini looked eveVy bit
the culprit as he gazed down sheep
ishly at his shoes.
But Salzenstein seemed to feed
off the emotion created within him
by Orsini's shenanigans. Salzen
stein attacked the net and won the
next two points to go up 30-15 in
the game. Then came another ques
tionable call. This time Orsini had
nothing to do with it. A Salzenstein
deadened volley appeared to bounce
twice before a charging Orsini was
able to lift the ball over the net with
his racquet. Salzenstein looked to
the umpire for a call but no ruling
was forthcoming. Again Salzen
stein responded to the adversity.
Two aces. Game, set and match,
Stanford.
"I was obviously pissed off at the
double bounce call and the ace,"
Salzenstein said. "I was just really
upset and coach [Gould] said,
'Focus on the next point.' "
Up next for the Cardinal is a
noon EDT semifinal match today
against Pac-10 rival UCLA (17-5),
who is ranked and seeded fourth
and got through Fresno State 4-3
and South Alabama 4-1 on its road
to the final four. Stanford swept the
season series with the Bruins,
though the Cardinal needed a 12-10
third-set tie-break win from
Thomas to defeat UCLA 4-3 in Los
Angeles. Second-ranked and sec
ond-seeded Georgia continues to
draw large hometown crowds and
appears primed for a final round
showdown with Stanford or UCLA
"We have a lot of work to do,"
Goldstein said. "We're only halfway
there. The second half is going to be
about 80 times tougher than the
first half — and the first half was
very tough."

knew if I could return well, I'd be
serving twice more. Basically I was
taking it one point at a time."
Lapidus placed some of the
blame on his team, but gave Stan
ford a lot of credit for the comeback.

"When we were up 5-1 we played
kind of a tight volley to make it 5-2.
Then they hit a couple of good
returns and serves. At that point
it's anybody's match. But that's
why they're always in the finals
year after year. They always come
up with big stufT and big shots.
They come up with the goods."
In singles Stanford would need
the big shots because the Blue Dev
ils still had some fire left in their
bellies even if a dagger had already
been driven through their hearts by
the doubles loss. Singles action pro
gressed through the first sets on
courts 2 and 3 and 4 but just as
rapidly dropped the initial sets on
courts 1 and 6, where Elliott pulled
out a first set tie-breaker, 7-3.
No. 41 Goldstein wrapped up his
match first, defeating No. 93 Ayers,
6-1, 6-2 in No. 3 singles. But No. 6
Salzenstein then dropped the No. 1
match to No. 15 Pressley, 6-3, 6-3.
No. 10 Humphries gave the Car
dinal a 3-1 advantage with a 6-3, 6-
3 triumph over No. 25 Chess.
But the needed fourth point
would prove difficult to attain for
the Cardinal. Becker was about to
force a third set at No. 6. Elliott was
down a break in his second set. No.
65 Thomas seemed the best candi
date to clinch for the Cardinal, lead
ing 4-1 in the second set after tak
ing the first 6-2.
But Thomas' No. 4 singles oppo
nent, Adam Gusky, would not fold.
He broke Thomas while the Cardi
nal junior was serving for the
match at 5-4, and after that any
outcome seemed possible in that
match.
"I saw Jim get broken while
serving for the match," Elliott said.
"At that point, I said, 'OK, It's
gonna be me. I'm gonna have to
clinch the match.' "

Elliott was already back on serve
when he decided to bear down. He
and his opponent, Moggio, plodded
toward a tie-break, where Elliott
took charge, winning 7-2 to
advance the Cardinal into the sec
ond round.
In his team's postmortem,
Lapidus largely attributed the Blue
Devil defeat to the disappointment
of losing the doubles point.
"We were really down on our
selves after doubles," Lapidus said.
"Realistically, it is only one point,
but it is a real momentum killer,
especially when you are up one
match and don't pull it out."
Against Mississippi State the Cardi
nal again faced a tough test in both
doubles and singles. The Bulldogs
feature the 1994 NCAA doubles
champions, Laurent Miquelard and
Joe Simmons. In addition, their No.
1 singles player, Laurent Orsini,
was the No. 1 player in the nation
for five months before sitting out
fall of 1994 to perform military obli
gations in his native France. The
'Dawgs are also a senior-heavy,
mostly foreign team that nearly
defeated the Cardinal at last year's
National Indoor Championships,
losing only after Thomas pulled out
a third-set tie-break in the last
match that day.
Once again on Sunday, Stanford
needed a third-set tie-break victory
in the doubles rubber match to
secure the first point. And again it
was Salzenstein and Elliott provid
ing the last-match heroics.
Spring showers moved the play
indoors from Henry Field Stadium
to the unbearably stuffy but drier
confines of the Hopkins Indoor
Center for most of the doubles
action and all of the singles match
es. Only the top two singles match
es could be played indoors — UCIA

and South Alabama were playing
their doubles matches on the other
two indoor courts — while the No.
3 doubles players waited in the
wings for the call, if they were need
ed for a rubber match.
"Coming inside was a big advan
tage for IStanfordJ because they are
an attacking team," said Mississip
pi State head coach Andy Jackson.
"That's why they're undefeated.
Outdoors we might have scored
some points, but maybe not."
Humphries and Goldstein began
the scoring for the Cardinal with an
8-6 victory over No. 32 Miquelard
and Kristian Broems. That cleared
the court for Salzen.stein and Elliott
to resume their match, which they
were leading 3-2 over Orsini and
Mattias Karlsson when the rains
had come.
Meanwhile, Becker and Thomas
were trying to clinch the doubles
point on the adjacent court against
Simmons and Matt Pledger. But
the Cardinal tandem was broken in
all four of their last service games
by the Bulldogs, who were also bro
ken several times but still took the
match 8-6.
Prospects were gloomy for Stan
ford after Elliott was broken while
serving at 7-7. But serving for the
match, the Bulldogs were unable to
capitalize on a 30-0 lead, as Salzen
stein and Elliott fought back with
solid returns of serve, sharp-angled
volleys, and sure-handed over
heads. The pivotal tie-break was all
Cardinal, as an Elliott overhead
gave Stanford a 9-8 (7-2) victory.
When singles got underway, lim
ited court availability allowed only
the top four singles matches to be
played in Hopkins Center. If Stan
ford could not win three out of
those four, then the remaining two
matches would be played.

Stanford got another quick vic
tory from Goldstein, who defeated
Miquelard, 6-3,6-3.
Thomas racked up Stanford's
next point, a 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) defeat of
Thomas Dupre. The match includ
ed a rare point penalty assessed by
rule against Dupre because he was
overruled by the chair umpire on
three separate occasions. The point
gave Thomas a gift game midway
through the second set as he was
serving at 30-30 when Dupre was
overruled and assessed the penalty.
Dupre also lost a point for racket
abuse later in the set.
"He gave me a whole game,"
Thomas said. "It's nice to get free
points. I'm never not gonna take
'em. It was also rtice to finish a
match and win, since I didn't finish
the match [on Saturday] and we
hadn't played in three weeks."
Now only Humphries or Salzen
stein needed to win in order to
clinch the victory. But there was
still some drama left in this match.
Humphries was down a break in
his third set. Elliott, who had
already begun his match on the
court vacated by Goldstein, was
down a break in his first set. And
Salzenstein had split with Orsini
and was involved in a nip and tick
battle with the Frenchman who
seemed to have a penchant for mak
ing disputed calls and also for dis
puting Salzenstein's calls.
A highly questionable one
occurred with Salzenstein leading
5-3 in the final set. With his back
against the wall, Orsini called a
Salzenstein kick serve out despite
the fact that the ball appeared to
land one inch inside the corner of
the service line. When Salzenstein's
request for an overrule was denied
by the chair umpire — whose chair
was on the side of the disputed call

— the junior captain cried out in
disbelief, "That was the best serve
of my life!" Orsini looked eveVy bit
the culprit as he gazed down sheep
ishly at his shoes.
But Salzenstein seemed to feed
off the emotion created within him
by Orsini's shenanigans. Salzen
stein attacked the net and won the
next two points to go up 30-15 in
the game. Then came another ques
tionable call. This time Orsini had
nothing to do with it. A Salzenstein
deadened volley appeared to bounce
twice before a charging Orsini was
able to lift the ball over the net with
his racquet. Salzenstein looked to
the umpire for a call but no ruling
was forthcoming. Again Salzen
stein responded to the adversity.
Two aces. Game, set and match,
Stanford.
"I was obviously pissed off at the
double bounce call and the ace,"
Salzenstein said. "I was just really
upset and coach [Gould] said,
'Focus on the next point.' "
Up next for the Cardinal is a
noon EDT semifinal match today
against Pac-10 rival UCLA (17-5),
who is ranked and seeded fourth
and got through Fresno State 4-3
and South Alabama 4-1 on its road
to the final four. Stanford swept the
season series with the Bruins,
though the Cardinal needed a 12-10
third-set tie-break win from
Thomas to defeat UCLA 4-3 in Los
Angeles. Second-ranked and sec
ond-seeded Georgia continues to
draw large hometown crowds and
appears primed for a final round
showdown with Stanford or UCLA
"We have a lot of work to do,"
Goldstein said. "We're only halfway
there. The second half is going to be
about 80 times tougher than the
first half — and the first half was
very tough."
ATHENS, Ga. — When people talk about cutting
through the Georgia air with a knife, they are usually
talking about the humidity. But this weekend they
were also talking about the tension in the air surround
ing the first two rounds of the NCAA Men's Tennis
Championships, where top-ranked Stanford (25-0)
breathed a sigh of relief only after two near upsets by
sleeper teams from No. 9 Duke (23-4) and No. 7 Missis
sippi State (18-6).
The final scores — a 4-1 first-round victory over the
Blue Devils on Saturday and a 4-0 quarterfinal win over
the Bulldogs yesterday — did not indicate how tightly
contested both matches really were.
The first scare actually came when the seedings were
announced last week. Duke inexplicably received a 13
through 16 seeding despite its year-long top 10 ranking.
For both the Cardinal and the Blue Devils, this signaled
an upcoming confrontation tougher than could normal
ly be expected from a first-round opponent.
"When we had to play Duke last year in the second
round, I was extremely nervous," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "When I saw we were playing them
in the first round this year and that they had the same
team from last year, I'm going, 'Oh, my gosh.' Their
players play a style of play I have a lot of respect for.
Their guys come at you and they never stop. Duke has
the kind of team that is capable of winning the tourna
ment."
Duke's head coach Jay Lapidus was even more upset

about the seeding.
"I thought it was ridiculous," said Lapidus. "We'd
been ranked between five and five through the season.
Obviously I was furious. But we have to talk with our
rackets and we didn't do it. I don't know why we have
rankings if we don't even use them at the end of the
season. I have had at least five or six coaches come up
to me and tell me that was really ridiculous."
Though the Cardinal dismissed the Blue Devils from
postseason competition for the second consecutive year,
the result could have been much different had just a
few points turned out the other way.
The story of Saturday's match was Stanford's hard
won doubles point. The Cardinal first suffered a quick
setback in No. 1 doubles when Duke's No. 14 duo of
Rob Chess and Peter Ayers capitalized on an early
break to defeat the No. 2 team of freshmen Scott
Humphries and Paul Goldstein for the second time this
season, 8-6.


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Junior Jim Thomas and his doubles partner, junior Ricky Becker, put the hurt on their Blue Devil counter
parts on Saturday. The team advanced to today's semifinal with wins over Duke and Mississippi State.
"We had been warned by the
coaches to put the pressure on,"
Humphries said. "They jumped on
us early and rode that throughout
the match."
Needing just one more doubles
win to secure the doubles point,
however, Duke could not pull it off
even though they were "in the
matches" remaining to be decided;
the score of the No. 2 doubles match
stood at 6-6 while the No. 3 doubles
match was also deadlocked, 7-7.
First the No. 54 tandem of
juniors Jim Thomas and Ricky
Becker negotiated a 8-6 victory over
the No. 40 team of Phillippe Moggio
and Chris Pressley. A double fault
gave Stanford a break that put
them up 7-6 and from there
Thomas served out the match.
When all eyes turned to the No.
3 doubles match, they witnessed a
tie-break comeback more enormous
than the budget of nearby Atlanta's
Olympic planning committee. Afler
falling behind 5-1 in the tiebreak of
the rubber match, the Cardinal's
Jeff Salzenstein and Grant Elliott
reeled off six consecutive points to
seize the match, the doubles point
and the momentum going into sin
gles.
"When we were down 5-1 [assis
tant coach John] Whitflinger] told
me to really concentrate on this
point," said Salzenstein, a junior. "I
knew if I could return well, I'd be

3 doubles players waited in the
wings for the call, if they were need
ed for a rubber match.
"Coming inside was a big advan
tage for IStanfordJ because they are
an attacking team," said Mississip
pi State head coach Andy Jackson.
"That's why they're undefeated.
Outdoors we might have scored
some points, but maybe not."
Humphries and Goldstein began
the scoring for the Cardinal with an
8-6 victory over No. 32 Miquelard
and Kristian Broems. That cleared
the court for Salzen.stein and Elliott
to resume their match, which they
were leading 3-2 over Orsini and
Mattias Karlsson when the rains
had come.
Meanwhile, Becker and Thomas
were trying to clinch the doubles
point on the adjacent court against
Simmons and Matt Pledger. But
the Cardinal tandem was broken in
all four of their last service games
by the Bulldogs, who were also bro
ken several times but still took the
match 8-6.
Prospects were gloomy for Stan
ford after Elliott was broken while
serving at 7-7. But serving for the
match, the Bulldogs were unable to
capitalize on a 30-0 lead, as Salzen
stein and Elliott fought back with
solid returns of serve, sharp-angled
volleys, and sure-handed over
heads. The pivotal tie-break was all
Cardinal, as an Elliott overhead
gave Stanford a 9-8 (7-2) victory.
When singles got underway, lim
ited court availability allowed only
the top four singles matches to be
played in Hopkins Center. If Stan
ford could not win three out of
those four, then the remaining two
matches would be played.

Stanford got another quick vic
tory from Goldstein, who defeated
Miquelard, 6-3,6-3.
Thomas racked up Stanford's
next point, a 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) defeat of
Thomas Dupre. The match includ
ed a rare point penalty assessed by
rule against Dupre because he was
overruled by the chair umpire on
three separate occasions. The point
gave Thomas a gift game midway
through the second set as he was
serving at 30-30 when Dupre was
overruled and assessed the penalty.
Dupre also lost a point for racket
abuse later in the set.
"He gave me a whole game,"
Thomas said. "It's nice to get free
points. I'm never not gonna take
'em. It was also rtice to finish a
match and win, since I didn't finish
the match [on Saturday] and we
hadn't played in three weeks."
Now only Humphries or Salzen
stein needed to win in order to
clinch the victory. But there was
still some drama left in this match.
Humphries was down a break in
his third set. Elliott, who had
already begun his match on the
court vacated by Goldstein, was
down a break in his first set. And
Salzenstein had split with Orsini
and was involved in a nip and tick
battle with the Frenchman who
seemed to have a penchant for mak
ing disputed calls and also for dis
puting Salzenstein's calls.
A highly questionable one
occurred with Salzenstein leading
5-3 in the final set. With his back
against the wall, Orsini called a
Salzenstein kick serve out despite
the fact that the ball appeared to
land one inch inside the corner of
the service line. When Salzenstein's
request for an overrule was denied
by the chair umpire — whose chair
was on the side of the disputed call

— the junior captain cried out in
disbelief, "That was the best serve
of my life!" Orsini looked eveVy bit
the culprit as he gazed down sheep
ishly at his shoes.
But Salzenstein seemed to feed
off the emotion created within him
by Orsini's shenanigans. Salzen
stein attacked the net and won the
next two points to go up 30-15 in
the game. Then came another ques
tionable call. This time Orsini had
nothing to do with it. A Salzenstein
deadened volley appeared to bounce
twice before a charging Orsini was
able to lift the ball over the net with
his racquet. Salzenstein looked to
the umpire for a call but no ruling
was forthcoming. Again Salzen
stein responded to the adversity.
Two aces. Game, set and match,
Stanford.
"I was obviously pissed off at the
double bounce call and the ace,"
Salzenstein said. "I was just really
upset and coach [Gould] said,
'Focus on the next point.' "
Up next for the Cardinal is a
noon EDT semifinal match today
against Pac-10 rival UCLA (17-5),
who is ranked and seeded fourth
and got through Fresno State 4-3
and South Alabama 4-1 on its road
to the final four. Stanford swept the
season series with the Bruins,
though the Cardinal needed a 12-10
third-set tie-break win from
Thomas to defeat UCLA 4-3 in Los
Angeles. Second-ranked and sec
ond-seeded Georgia continues to
draw large hometown crowds and
appears primed for a final round
showdown with Stanford or UCLA
"We have a lot of work to do,"
Goldstein said. "We're only halfway
there. The second half is going to be
about 80 times tougher than the
first half — and the first half was
very tough."
