# Men vanquish the Bulldogs

ATHENS, Ga. — When people talk about cutting
through the Georgia air with a knife, they are usually
talking about the humidity. But this weekend they
were also talking about the tension in the air surround
ing the first two rounds of the NCAA Men's Tennis
Championships, where top-ranked Stanford (25-0)
breathed a sigh of relief only after two near upsets by
sleeper teams from No. 9 Duke (23-4) and No. 7 Missis
sippi State (18-6).
The final scores — a 4-1 first-round victory over the
Blue Devils on Saturday and a 4-0 quarterfinal win over
the Bulldogs yesterday — did not indicate how tightly
contested both matches really were.
The first scare actually came when the seedings were
announced last week. Duke inexplicably received a 13
through 16 seeding despite its year-long top 10 ranking.
For both the Cardinal and the Blue Devils, this signaled
an upcoming confrontation tougher than could normal
ly be expected from a first-round opponent.
"When we had to play Duke last year in the second
round, I was extremely nervous," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "When I saw we were playing them
in the first round this year and that they had the same
team from last year, I'm going, 'Oh, my gosh.' Their
players play a style of play I have a lot of respect for.
Their guys come at you and they never stop. Duke has
the kind of team that is capable of winning the tourna
ment."
Duke's head coach Jay Lapidus was even more upset

about the seeding.
"I thought it was ridiculous," said Lapidus. "We'd
been ranked between five and five through the season.
Obviously I was furious. But we have to talk with our
rackets and we didn't do it. I don't know why we have
rankings if we don't even use them at the end of the
season. I have had at least five or six coaches come up
to me and tell me that was really ridiculous."
Though the Cardinal dismissed the Blue Devils from
postseason competition for the second consecutive year,
the result could have been much different had just a
few points turned out the other way.
The story of Saturday's match was Stanford's hard
won doubles point. The Cardinal first suffered a quick
setback in No. 1 doubles when Duke's No. 14 duo of
Rob Chess and Peter Ayers capitalized on an early
break to defeat the No. 2 team of freshmen Scott
Humphries and Paul Goldstein for the second time this
season, 8-6.
