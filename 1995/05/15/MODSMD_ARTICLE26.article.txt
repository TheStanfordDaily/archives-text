Just like last conference season, the Stanford
baseball team saved the drama for the final act.
With Arizona State's Packard Stadium as the
stage, the star-studded Cardinal cast belted two
home runs in the ninth inning and three in the 11th
to win yesterday's Pacific 10 Southern Division sea
son finale 10-7 and complete a three-game sweep of
the Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz.
USC's two victories over Arizona gave the Tro

overall, 20-10 in the Six-Pac) can still claim a share
of the crown with a Wildcat upset over USC today.
By virtue of a 4-2 head-to-head series edge over the

NCAA bid.

Arizona State (34-21,13-17 in the Six-Pac) out.
Stanford claimed the first two contests 8-4 and
11-3 with all-around solid performances, but, like
last year, saved late-inning heroics for yesterday's
triumph.
After winning the 1994 Six-Pac title on the sea
son's last day with the help of a late home run by
reserve Rod Meyer, the current edition was down to
its last two outs and facing a two-run deficit in the
top of the ninth.
Freshman catcher John SchaefTer stepped to the
plate to face Josh Deakman, who had shut the Car
dinal down for five innings. SchaefTer was coming
off a 3-for-5 performance the day before at designat
ed hitter, but got the nod at catcher after junior A.J.
Hinch was drilled in the mouth by a ball during bat
ting practice. SchaefTer promptly laced his first
career homer, cutting the margin to one.
I hadn't hit a home run all year and I was just
trying to hit the ball hard," SchaefTer said on KZSU.
"He just threw a fastball right down the middle. I
