Just like last conference season, the Stanford
baseball team saved the drama for the final act.
With Arizona State's Packard Stadium as the
stage, the star-studded Cardinal cast belted two
home runs in the ninth inning and three in the 11th
to win yesterday's Pacific 10 Southern Division sea
son finale 10-7 and complete a three-game sweep of
the Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz.
USC's two victories over Arizona gave the Tro
jans the Six-Pac title, although Stanford (32-21
overall, 20-10 in the Six-Pac) can still claim a share
of the crown with a Wildcat upset over USC today.
By virtue of a 4-2 head-to-head series edge over the
Cardinal, the Trojans win the tie-breaker and the
opportunity to play the Nor-Pac champion in a best
of-three set next week for the Pac-10's automatic

NCAA bid.
Nonetheless, Stanford's first-ever sweep over the
Sun Devils at Packard Stadium assured the Cardi
nal of a spot in the regionals and perhaps knocked
Arizona State (34-21,13-17 in the Six-Pac) out.
Stanford claimed the first two contests 8-4 and
11-3 with all-around solid performances, but, like
last year, saved late-inning heroics for yesterday's
triumph.
After winning the 1994 Six-Pac title on the sea
son's last day with the help of a late home run by
reserve Rod Meyer, the current edition was down to
its last two outs and facing a two-run deficit in the
top of the ninth.
Freshman catcher John SchaefTer stepped to the
plate to face Josh Deakman, who had shut the Car
dinal down for five innings. SchaefTer was coming
off a 3-for-5 performance the day before at designat
ed hitter, but got the nod at catcher after junior A.J.
Hinch was drilled in the mouth by a ball during bat
ting practice. SchaefTer promptly laced his first
career homer, cutting the margin to one.
I hadn't hit a home run all year and I was just
trying to hit the ball hard," SchaefTer said on KZSU.
"He just threw a fastball right down the middle. I
just laid a good swing on it and the
ball flew — the wind was blowing
out today."
Following Schaeffer's round
tripper, freshman designated hitter
Chris Draft was called back to the
dugout in favor of Hinch. After a
trip to the dentist, the All-American
erased the cavity separating the
Cardinal and the Sun Devils with a
stunning homer that tied the score.
Neither team was able to score
until the 11th, but the Sun Devils
got the potential winning run
aboard off sophomore Brendan Sul
livan in the bottom of the 10th. Sul
livan came on in relief of junior
starter Mike Robbins, who yielded
14 hits and seven runs in 7 1-3
innings.
Sophomore John David Bram
tner came on in relief and walked a
batter before inducing the final out
of the inning. Brammer (1-1) went
on to earn the win after a Cardinal
eruption in the top of the 11th.

Senior Dusty Allen put Stanford
ahead for good with his fourth
home run of the year, a mammoth
shot of loser Ryan Bradley (5-3).
Two batters later, SchaefTer added
the another homer, and with two
outs, junior shortstop Eric Sees
belted his first of 1995.
The Cardinal celebrated another
amazing season-closer at Tempe as
sophomore Tom Reimers nailed
down the save for the first time this
season after nine in 1994.
"It hasn't been easy for me per
sonally or for the team all year,"
Reimers said on KZSU. "We knew
that this was a big series for us to
get a little bit of momentum and
solidify our spot in the regionals.
"It wasn't quite as dramatic as
the game was last year, but this year
people came through in the clutch."
Nobody had to contribute in the
late innings on Saturday, as fresh
man Kyle Peterson continued to
make a mockery of Six-F'ac hitters.
The 10-1 right-hander posted his
sixth complete game in conference
play to go with a perfect 8-0 Six-Pac
record, striking out nine and never
allowing the Sun Devils to come

close.
"Coming in I really didn't know
what my role would be on this team.
There's no way I could have
dreamed this would have hap
pened."
Stanford cruised to an 8-0 lead
after three and a half innings,
destroying Sun Devil starter Jason
Bond (3-2). Hinch led the way with
a 4-for-6 showing and three RBIs,
including his sixth homer. Junior
left fielder Cale Carter went 3-for-6
with three RBIs in the two slot as
Stanford pounded out 16 hits.
In the opener Stanford relied on
clutch hitting and baserunning
from junior second baseman Brian
Dallimore and three and two-thirds
innings of stellar relief from fresh
man Mario Iglesias to post an 8-4
win.
With the Cardinal clinging to a 5-
4 lead in the bottom of the sixth,
Iglesias came on in relief of junior
Todd Bartels (4-2). After plunking
his first hitter, Iglesias put out the
fire and enabled Bartels to earn the
win. Stanford posted three runs in
the top of the seventh to put the
frame out of reach.
