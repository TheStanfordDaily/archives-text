# Elliott at head of Cardinal charge
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — College ten
nis is a team sport, but that
doesn't mean an individual player
can't make an impact come crunch
time.
So far in the NCAA Round of 16
in Athens, sophomore Grant
Elliott has been a prime-time play
er for the Cardinal. The Palo Alto
native has won all three of the
matches he's been involved in, has
won all those matches in tie-break
ers and has converted on all three
of his opportunities to clinch
either a doubles point or the match
with those victories.
It began in doubles against
Duke on Saturday. Along with
partner JefT Salzenstein, Elliott
clinched the crucial doubles point
for Stanford with a 9-8 (7-5) victo
ry over Adam Gusky and Nick
Walrod.
Trailing 5-1 in the tie-breaker,
Elliott reflected on the situation


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Grant Elliott, shown here in his singles match against Duke's Phillippe
Moggio, played a key role in both Cardinal wins this weekend.
and went into action.
"I was thinking we were in big
trouble. Doubles was tied up and we
really needed this match. I was con
centrating on getting my return in
and keeping the ball in play," Elliott
said.
A perfect topspin lob by Salzen
stein made it 5-2, and then an
equally well-placed return of serve
by Elliott brought the score to 5-3.
Then Elliott put away an overhead
off of a meek return of Salzen

stein's serve.
"Once we got it back to 5-4, I
thought we really had the momen
tum, like we could do this," Elliott
said.
The point at 5-4 was all Elliott.
He returned serve, and Duke
volleyed right back to him. Elliott
lobbed the ball over the head of
Walrod, whose partner Gusky
scrambled back to get it. After the
Duke duo switched, Elliott hit the
ball into the open space, which was
now a personal alley between Elliott
and Gusky. They traded forehands,
and then Gusky hit a short ball.
Elliott charged the ball, meeting it
with a forceful forehand approach.
Gusky shanked the ball wide.

"Grant played an unbelievable
point," Salzenstein said.
Now all that was left was a
Salzenstein topspin lob and an
Elliott serve to Walrod's body that
Salzenstein put away at the net,
and the doubles point belonged to
Stanford.
But the day's work was not yet
complete for Elliott, whose 22-2
dual-match record in No. 5 singles
is best on this year's Cardinal
squad. With his team leading Duke
3-1 and needing just one victory to
send the Blue Devils packing,
Elliott was down a break in the sec
ond set of his match with Phillippe
Moggio after having won the first
set 7-6 (7-3).

"I was down 1-4 and (teammate)
Jim (Thomas) was up 4-1," Elliott
said. "I was still trying to win my
match. I really tried to focus on my
return of serve because I was down
a break. I really started working my
butt off. I got a break with him
serving for the set."
Then Elliott looked over to
Court Six and saw teammate Ricky
Becker on serve in the third set. He
looked over at Court Four and saw
Thomas struggling to put away
Gusky in the second set.
When Gusky broke Thomas
while Thomas was serving for the
match, Elliott decided to take
charge of the situation.
"I said. 'I trotta cot this came.

I'm gonna be the one.' At that
point, I didn't pay attention to
Jim's match."
Elliott dominated the tie-break
er, using his lethal serve and volley
game to beat Moggio 7-2 and give
the Cardinal the victory.
Against Mississippi State yester
day, Elliott was again involved in
clinching the doubles rubber
match. He and Salzenstein
rebounded from being down 7-8, 0-
30 with the Bulldogs serving to win
9-8 (7-2).
"We just started getting more
aggressive. I had been kind of ten
tative, and I kept telling myself I
was gonna go out and get it if they
gave me balls to hit," Elliott said.

Once they got it to a tie-breaker,
Elliott and his partner were not
about to let the opportunity slip
away.
"We didn't miss a ball in the tie
breaker," Elliott said.
Elliott's singles match against
the Bulldogs was suspended in the
first set, but he had already estab
lished his important role in Stan
ford's early-round success.
"It's never a one- or two-person
team," said Stanford head coach
Dick Gould. "It takes six singles
and three doubles matches, and
players need to step up at every
position. Grant Elliott did that for
us today, in both singles and dou
bles."
