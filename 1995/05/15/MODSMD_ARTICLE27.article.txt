ATHENS, Ga. — College ten
nis is a team sport, but that
doesn't mean an individual player
can't make an impact come crunch
time.
So far in the NCAA Round of 16
in Athens, sophomore Grant
Elliott has been a prime-time play
er for the Cardinal. The Palo Alto
native has won all three of the
matches he's been involved in, has
won all those matches in tie-break
ers and has converted on all three
of his opportunities to clinch
either a doubles point or the match
with those victories.
It began in doubles against
Duke on Saturday. Along with
partner JefT Salzenstein, Elliott
clinched the crucial doubles point
for Stanford with a 9-8 (7-5) victo
ry over Adam Gusky and Nick
Walrod.
Trailing 5-1 in the tie-breaker,
Elliott reflected on the situation


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Grant Elliott, shown here in his singles match against Duke's Phillippe
Moggio, played a key role in both Cardinal wins this weekend.
