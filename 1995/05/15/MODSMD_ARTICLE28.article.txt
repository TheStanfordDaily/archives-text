# Inspired rounds on days two and three save Stanford
## Women's golf third at regionals 
### John Lawson Staff writer 
"A promising third" was how Stanford women's
golf head coach Tim Baldwin described his team's
finish at the Western Region Championships this
past weekend in Tucson, Ariz.
Six of the top seven teams in the nation, includ
ing the second-ranked Cardinal, descended upon
the 6,032-yard, par 72 Randolph Park North
course located off the campus of the University of
Arizona.
In total, the premier 20 programs west of the
Mississippi River were invited to the regionals. Out
of that field, the 11 teams with the lowest scores
were to garner a ticket to college golf s version of the
"Big Dance," the NCAA championships, held in
Wilmington, N.C., at the end of the month.
Although Baldwin admitted that his team was a
near lock to qualify for the NCAAs, Stanford stum
bled its way to a ninth-place tie after Thursday's
play. After playing solid, even-par golf for nine holes,
the Cardinal fell apart on the back nine, shooting 14-
over-par, and finishing with a 302,15 strokes behind
first round leader, No. 3 San Jose State.
"Some of us lost just our concentration," said
junior Vicky Strada. "There was some shift in the
wind, but that was no excuse. It was just poor golf."
The players held an impromptu team meeting
Thursday evening to discuss their predicament and
detect the problems that gave rise to it.
Whatever was said in the Doubletree Hotel that
night certainly had an effect, for no team, not even
two-time defending national champion and No. 1
Arizona State, played the last 36 holes better than
the Cardinal.
Facing stiff 30 mph winds on Friday, Stanford
soared into third place with a 4-over-par 292. Then,
the Cardinal outdid itself with a spectacular 1-over
par 289 on Saturday, securing its third-place stand

ing 15 strokes ahead of surprising conference rival
Oregon.
"That back nine on Thursday was a blessing in
disguise for us," said sophomore Mhain McKay. "It
made us focus on the task at hand. We were able to
really get it together the last two days. We showed
that we can play with the likes of Arizona State and
San Jose State."
The Spartans and the Sun Devils finished the
tournament with identical scores of 878, five shots
ahead of the surging Cardinal. The tie marked the
first time all season that Arizona State did not fully
capture the team title.
"We've talked often about the gap between Ari
zona State and the rest of the us," Baldwin said.
"Well, that has been significantly reduced. We
looked every bit as strong as they did this weekend.
If we could throw out those disastrous nine holes, we
would've won it. That's very encouraging."
Individually, Arizona State's reigning NCAA
Player of the Year, Wendy Ward, cruised to victory
with an impressive 6-under-par 210. Stanford
sophomore Andrea Baxter played her best golf of the
year, shooting a 216 en route to a second-place show
ing.
"Andrea had an outstanding tournament," said
her roommate, McKay, whose 3-over-par 219 was
good enough for fourth place. "She was the only one
who had solid rounds each of the three days."
Other Cardinal scores included Strada's 224,
senior Jamille Jose's 227 and fellow senior Amy
Lawrence's 235.
The team has only one week to prepare for the
NCAAs, as Stanford leaves for the East Coast this
Saturday, but the way the Cardinal performed at the
close of the Western Regionals doesn't leave much to
be desired.
"We're playing as well as anyone right now,"
Strada said. "No one should have more confidence
than we do. It'll be anyone's tournament."
