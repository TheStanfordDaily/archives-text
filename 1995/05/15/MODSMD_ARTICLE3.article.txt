## Permits for bicycles a hoax 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
If you are reading this while standing in line wait
ing to buy your bicycle parking permit, the word
"gullible" has also been removed from the dictionary.
Hundreds of fliers placed on bicycles outside stu
dent residences yesterday claimed that all students
had to buy a parking permit for their bicycles by
today. The flier is a joke, according to Stanford Po
lice.
"Effective May 15, all bikes parked overnight on
campus will need parking permits," the fliers said.
"Permits will cost $5.00 and will be valid through
May 15, 1996. Bicycles not displaying a permit may
be clamped or impounded."
The fliers ended with two stern warnings. "There
is no grace period," the fliers said. "Get your permits
now!"
A Santa Clara County ordinance, number 67/954-
B, was cited at the top of the flier as the reason for the
permit requirement. According to Stanford Police

Sgt. Hilary Karp, "that code number doesn't make
any sense" given the way ordinances are numbered.
The flier "is not anything we would put out," Karp
said.
After seeing the phony notices, Cedro Resident As
sistant Kathy Chi said she called the Special Services
division of the Stanford Police and asked whether the
fliers were real. The person there told her that had it
been a real notice, the seal printed on the top would
have looked the same as the badge that Stanford
deputies wear. The joke fliers had the Stanford tree
logo printed on top.
In order to prevent people from heading down to
buy their permits, Chi circulated an e-mail notice on
the RA mailing list asking RAs to inform their resi
dents of the joke.
"As far as I can tell, people really fell for it," Chi
said. For example, a group of 10 incensed students
wrote a letter to The Daily yesterday calling for a
campus-wide protest against the supposed require-
ment.
The flier gave an incorrect
address for the Transportation
Programs office and a fake phone
number — which actually dialed
the assistant student financial
managers' office at the ASSU.
The voice mailbox for the num
ber was full yesterday afternoon.
The notes were posted some
time Saturday night. Chaparral
Editor Chris Onstad said that he
could not rule out the possibility
that members of the Hammer
and Coffin Society were involved
in the incident. "We recently had
an initiation," Onstad said, part
of which is to stage a prank. "It's
amazing the amount of manpow
er [this prank] took."
Onstad said he also thought
the prank could be part of a mind
control experiment for one of
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbar
do's classes.
Zimbardo said he knew noth
ing about the prank and was not
sure whether his students might
have been responsible. "It could
be — students in my class some
times do unusual things," he
said.
"We're hoping that not too
many people go to Transporta
tion Services tomorrow," Chi
said. "But there will be some that
will go."
