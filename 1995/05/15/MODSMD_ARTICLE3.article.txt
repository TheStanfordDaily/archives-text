If you are reading this while standing in line wait

"gullible" has also been removed from the dictionary.

In order to prevent people from heading down to
buy their permits, Chi circulated an e-mail notice on
the RA mailing list asking RAs to inform their resi

"As far as I can tell, people really fell for it," Chi
said. For example, a group of 10 incensed students
wrote a letter to The Daily yesterday calling for a
campus-wide protest against the supposed require-
