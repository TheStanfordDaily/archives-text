# Latin American journalist takes on teaching position
## Galeano offers unconventional look at society 
### Marie Rosencrantz Contributing writer 
One of the few posters on the wall of Eduardo
Galeano's Bolivar House office quotes Dante: "The
hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in
time of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality."
A journalist, writer and now, for the first time, a
lecturer, Galeano has always fought passionately
against human indifference toward injustice and in
equality.
The first time he has ever accepted an invitation to
teach at a university in the United States, Galeano is
offering two courses this quarter within the Center
for Latin American Studies discussing themes rang
ing from art to socialism to soccer. He will give a read
ing in both Spanish and English from two of his most
recent books in Annenberg Auditorium tonight.
The Latin American writer — world famous for
books such as "The Open Veins of Latin America"
and the trilogy "Memory of Fire" — describes Stan
ford as a "very peaceful" environment.
"This is perhaps the best possible place to reflect
upon the world in asylum without becoming crazy,"
hejoked.
Galeano's works can not be easily classified into
conventional categories, said Claudio Dur6n, a doc
toral student and the teaching assistant in Galeano's
class. He recalls going to different libraries and book
stores to see within which literary categories
Galeano's books would be found. "They were listed as
anthropology, history, literature, Latin American
studies and philosophy," he said. "I think Galeano is
like his books," he added.
Two of Galeano's books have won the prestigious
Cuban Casa de las Americas prize.
Galeano was born in 1940 in Montevideo,
Uruguay, the great-grandson of British, Italian,
Spanish and German immigrants. As a political car
toonist and later as a news reporter and editor for
magazines and dailies such as Epoca, El Sol and Mar
cha, Galeano developed his social and political voice.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof. Jorge Ruffinelli, a
friend and former fellow journalist from Uruguay,
was the first to introduce Galeano to the idea of
teaching at Stanford over coffee in Montevideo two
years ago. "He never said no, but he said that he was
not used to working within universities," Ruffinelli
said.
Terry Karl and Kathleen Morri
son, director and associate director
of the Center for Latin America
Studies, respectively, provided the
formal invitation. "We thought he
would be such a wonderful addi
tion to the program," Morrison
said. "His classes have been very
well received by the students," she
added.
While many students bring
tape recorders to class in order not
to miss a word of Galeano's lec
tures, few raise their own discus
sion topics. "He is an intimidating
figure," said Duran. "When he

speaks in Latin America, thou
sands of people come to listen."
His international recognition as
one of the most prominent critical
voices of the Americas often brings
an association between Galeano
and the radical revolutionary tra
dition of Latin America.
Galeano himself focuses on the
importance of raising conscious
ness about injustice and inequality
in order to bring about change.
"When we talk about revolution,
we are not talking about a week
end of violence, rather about a pro
cess of change that will be possible
when the people now at the bot
tom will reach the top," he said.
Galeano told to his students at
Stanford that global inequality has
only become worse.
"The world has never before

been as unequal in the opportuni
ties offered to the populations of
the North and the South," he said.
"The world produces immense
amounts of food, but distributes it
so poorly that millions die of
hunger while a privileged few die
of obesity."
Galeano's first novel, "Los Dias
Siguientes," was published in
1963. Eight years later, "The
Open Veins of Latin America" —
Galeano's powerful tale of the his
torical and ongoing exploitation of
his continent — was published.
The novel is in its 40th edition
in Spanish and has been translat
ed into more than 20 languages.
Following the 1973 military
coup in Uruguay, Galeano, like
many other intellectuals, had to
leave his country to find exile in

Argentina. In Buenos Aires, he
founded the cultural magazine
Crisis, which he describes as "a
stubborn act of faith in the cre
ative and solitary word, the word
that is not, nor tries to be, neu
tral."
In 1976, a military regime took
power in Argentina, and Crisis was
closed by the police. Galeano left
for Spain. "The militaries offered
me the choices of death or impris
onment. Since neither condition is
especially agreeable, I had to
leave," he said.
Galeano lived in exile in Spain
for eight years before finally being
able to return to Uruguay after the
collapse of the military regime in
1984.
In Spain, Galeano wrote the tril
ogy "Memory of Fire," a poetic

mosaic of impressions of the Amer
icas told through short stories that
illustrate revealing events in the
history of the continents. "Exile
has two faces — one black and one
white," he said. "On the one hand,
it can be a time of misery; on the
other, a time of creation."
While strongly based on docu
mented facts, the trilogy, like "The
Open Veins of Latin America," is
not a historical work in the con
ventional sense, and Galeano him
self claims to be neither a historian
nor objective.
Many of Galeano's students
said they consider their professor
more than anything to be a
spokesman for the ones who have
been disadvantaged throughout
history — for indigenous people,
blacks and women.

"He is reclaiming history for
the people who have been pushed
away by the ones in power. Like he
says, it is not that these people
don't have a voice; they have just
been denied it," said graduate stu
dent David Radel.
Galeano said he will return to
Montevideo in June. The same
month, his recently completed
book, "Futbol al Sol y Sombra,"
will be published in Spanish, and
his book "Walking Words" will be
published in English.
In"The Book of Embraces,"
Galeano explains his motivations
as a writer. "I write for those who
cannot read me: the downtrodden,
the ones who have been waiting
on line for centuries to get into
history, who cannot read a book or
afford to buy one."
