## Galeano offers unconventional look at society 
### Marie Rosencrantz Contributing writer 
One of the few posters on the wall of Eduardo
Galeano's Bolivar House office quotes Dante: "The
hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in
time of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality."
A journalist, writer and now, for the first time, a
lecturer, Galeano has always fought passionately
against human indifference toward injustice and in
equality.
The first time he has ever accepted an invitation to
teach at a university in the United States, Galeano is
offering two courses this quarter within the Center
for Latin American Studies discussing themes rang

class. He recalls going to different libraries and book
stores to see within which literary categories
Galeano's books would be found. "They were listed as
anthropology, history, literature, Latin American
studies and philosophy," he said. "I think Galeano is
like his books," he added.
Two of Galeano's books have won the prestigious
Cuban Casa de las Americas prize.
Galeano was born in 1940 in Montevideo,
Uruguay, the great-grandson of British, Italian,
Spanish and German immigrants. As a political car
toonist and later as a news reporter and editor for
magazines and dailies such as Epoca, El Sol and Mar
cha, Galeano developed his social and political voice.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof. Jorge Ruffinelli, a
friend and former fellow journalist from Uruguay,
was the first to introduce Galeano to the idea of
teaching at Stanford over coffee in Montevideo two
years ago. "He never said no, but he said that he was
not used to working within universities," Ruffinelli
