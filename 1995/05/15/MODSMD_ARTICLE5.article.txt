# Gender balance unaffected by female faculty
## Study finds more women mentors does not mean more female students

A faculty with more female members
does not necessarily mean more female
students, says a new report co-au
thored by a Stanford graduate student.
Graduate School of Business stu
dent Brandice Canes, working with
Princeton University Economics Prof.
Harvey Rosen, came to this conclusion
after researching more than a decade of
gender information from three Ameri
can universities. Their findings, based
partly on Canes' senior thesis at Prince
ton, have been published by the Nation
al Bureau of Economic Research.
Canes said her research, which in
cluded data from all undergraduate
fields, showed little correlation be
tween faculty and student numbers.
"When you increased female faculty,

it did not increase the number of female
students," she said.
Canes' findings run against the
opinion held by some educators that in
creasing the number of female mentors
in certain fields will subsequently at
tract and maintain more female stu
dents.
According to Canes, that opinion has
led to some criticism of her report,
mainly from "people who look at the sit
uation idealistically."
Despite these objections, Canes has
stood her ground. "Common wisdom is
that [more] women in faculty will lead
to an increase in female students. The
point was to ask a basic question about
that assumption," she said. Canes
added that individuals with back
grounds in economics and statistics
tend to support her study.
Aside from female mentors, Canes

suggested some factors that she feels
can have a greater impact on women,
especially in technical fields such as
mathematics and engineering.
Educators, she said, must "catch
women at a younger stage than col
lege." Canes explained that many
young women are simply not given ap
propriate opportunities and encourage
ment to explore technical disciplines.
Although Stanford was not one of
the schools used in the study, some of
the University's own data tends to sup
port Canes' findings.
A Feb. 23 report entitled Professori
al Gains and Losses, which chronicles
faculty statistics over the 10-year peri
od between 1984 and 1994, shows that
the number of female engineering pro
fessors nearly doubled over that
decade, jumping from seven to 13. That
increase corresponds to a general in

crease of female professors throughout
the University.
Despite these findings, both the
number and percentage of undergradu
ate women majoring in engineering
have remained almost identical over
the same decade.
According to a 1989 study conducted
by The Daily, between 1984 and 1988
the School of Engineering fielded an av
erage of 487 men to 145 women. By the
beginning of the 1995 academic year,
these numbers had changed only slight
ly, to 430 men and 135 women.
Canes' study looked at gender data
in both numerical and percentage form,
using approximately a decade of infor
mation from the University of Michi
gan and nearly 40 years of data from
Whittier College in California, as well
as figures from Princeton since the in
stitution went coed in 1969.
