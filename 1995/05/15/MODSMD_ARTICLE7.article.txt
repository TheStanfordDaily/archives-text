# Policy outlines computer use
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
The University last week released its first consoli
dated policy outlining acceptable uses of campus com
puters.
The Acceptable Use Policy, written by Residential
Computing, spells out conditions of use for the resi
dential network and computer clusters. Modifying
network services and wiring, using large amounts of
network resources for extended periods of time,
forgery and using computers to "violate the educa
tional mission of the University" are all violations of
the new polity.
In addition, users of the network must comply
with University policies on Unrelated Business Activ
ity and Unrelated Business Income. The two policies
do not allow students to run a business with Stanford
resources.
According to Dane Spearing, assistant director of
System Support and Development for Residential
Computing, "none of the stuff in the policy is new."
The document, however, seeks to combine the cur
rent fragmented University policies and put them
into one location, he added.
