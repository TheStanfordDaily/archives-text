# Policy outlines computer use
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
The University last week released its first consoli
dated policy outlining acceptable uses of campus com
puters.
The Acceptable Use Policy, written by Residential
Computing, spells out conditions of use for the resi
dential network and computer clusters. Modifying
network services and wiring, using large amounts of
network resources for extended periods of time,
forgery and using computers to "violate the educa
tional mission of the University" are all violations of
the new polity.
In addition, users of the network must comply
with University policies on Unrelated Business Activ
ity and Unrelated Business Income. The two policies
do not allow students to run a business with Stanford
resources.
According to Dane Spearing, assistant director of
System Support and Development for Residential
Computing, "none of the stuff in the policy is new."
The document, however, seeks to combine the cur
rent fragmented University policies and put them
into one location, he added.
The policy — which outlines
regulations on the use of the Res
idential Computing network — is
now on the World Wide Web and
will probably be displayed in dorm
computer clusters next year,
Spearing said. It can also be found
on the Residential Computing
server.
Dorm clusters can only be used
by members of the residences in
which they are located, according

to the policy. The primary use of
clusters "is for work related to
academics." Games and non-aca
demic e-mail are secondary to aca
demic work.
The new documert, however,
includes policies to prevent illegal
copying of software currently
available on computers on the
Stanford network, Spearing said.
In creating the policy, the Uni
versity did stay away from con
tent-based restriction. Residen
tial Computing, Spearing said,
will not pass policies "that in any
way, shape or form restrict free
dom of speech."

The new policy does include
provisions for enforcement, as
student use is governed by the
Fundamental Standard. Residen
tial Computing "does not see its
role as the police," Spearing said.
The idea for the policy began at
last year's Res Net, a conference of
directors of residential computing
at schools across the country.
Before last week's final draft was
released, the policy went through
several revisions and received crit
icism from students, Residential
Computer Consultants and the
Judicial Affairs office, Spearing
said.
