# Earthquake predictions a possibility

### Kate Stinger 
Geophysicists from Stanford and the U.S. Geolog
ical Survey recently discovered that an analysis of
fault movement in the days before an earthquake
could eventually lead to short-term predictions of
tremors.
Assoc. Geophysics Prof. Gregory Beroza and geo
physicist William Ellsworth of the U.S. Geological
Survey stressed, however, that they cannot predict
earthquakes right now.
The study, released in Science magazine on Fri
day, began after the Northridge quake in January
1994 in an attempt to understand the origins of
earthquakes.
According to Ellsworth, they "examined just the
very beginnings of the earthquakes." He said that
ideally earthquakes "should begin very strongly."
"We found that all of the earthquakes began too
slowly. This slow beginning raises questions as to
how exactly they get started."
The study was initiated to determine "how a fault
makes the transition from being locked and steady"
to moving, Beroza said.
At the beginning of an earthquake, the two sides
of the fault make the large transition from being
locked and steady to moving at the rate of 1 mile per
second, Beroza explained.
Ellsworth and Beroza have formulated two hy
potheses on how earthquakes begin. In the first, a
cascade model, an earthquake begins with a small
rupture, followed by bigger and bigger ones â€” like
successively bigger dominoes knocking each other
over, Ellsworth said. This theory allows no possibili
ty for short-term prediction.
In the second hypothesis, the pre-slip model, the
earthquake begins with a slow slip in one section of
the fault that may last for weeks or months before
erupting into an earthquake. According to this
model, said Beroza, the signature that is visible on
the seismograph at the beginning of the earthquake
could be "the final stage of a slip that's happening so
slowly we can't see it."
Scientists who see this slow slip can predict the
quake. Beroza explained that the pre-slip model
"provides some sort of basis for prediction."
However, Ellsworth and Beroza do not know yet
which theory is more accurate, and they said it will be
a long time before scientists can predict earthquakes.
"No one expects earthquake prediction to be
easy," Ellsworth explained. "The earth reveals its se
crets very slowly." This study is just "another long,
systematic search to understand the earthquakes,"
he said.
They stressed that building earthquake-safe
