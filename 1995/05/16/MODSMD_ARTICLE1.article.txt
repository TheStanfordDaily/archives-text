# Earthquake predictions a possibility

### Kate Stinger 
Geophysicists from Stanford and the U.S. Geolog
ical Survey recently discovered that an analysis of
fault movement in the days before an earthquake
could eventually lead to short-term predictions of
tremors.
Assoc. Geophysics Prof. Gregory Beroza and geo
physicist William Ellsworth of the U.S. Geological
Survey stressed, however, that they cannot predict
earthquakes right now.
The study, released in Science magazine on Fri
day, began after the Northridge quake in January
1994 in an attempt to understand the origins of
earthquakes.
According to Ellsworth, they "examined just the
very beginnings of the earthquakes." He said that
ideally earthquakes "should begin very strongly."
"We found that all of the earthquakes began too
slowly. This slow beginning raises questions as to
how exactly they get started."
The study was initiated to determine "how a fault
makes the transition from being locked and steady"
to moving, Beroza said.
At the beginning of an earthquake, the two sides
of the fault make the large transition from being
locked and steady to moving at the rate of 1 mile per
second, Beroza explained.
Ellsworth and Beroza have formulated two hy
potheses on how earthquakes begin. In the first, a
cascade model, an earthquake begins with a small
rupture, followed by bigger and bigger ones — like
successively bigger dominoes knocking each other
over, Ellsworth said. This theory allows no possibili
ty for short-term prediction.
In the second hypothesis, the pre-slip model, the
earthquake begins with a slow slip in one section of
the fault that may last for weeks or months before
erupting into an earthquake. According to this
model, said Beroza, the signature that is visible on
the seismograph at the beginning of the earthquake
could be "the final stage of a slip that's happening so
slowly we can't see it."
Scientists who see this slow slip can predict the
quake. Beroza explained that the pre-slip model
"provides some sort of basis for prediction."
However, Ellsworth and Beroza do not know yet
which theory is more accurate, and they said it will be
a long time before scientists can predict earthquakes.
"No one expects earthquake prediction to be
easy," Ellsworth explained. "The earth reveals its se
crets very slowly." This study is just "another long,
systematic search to understand the earthquakes,"
he said.
They stressed that building earthquake-safe
structures is still the best way to
prepare for earthquakes. Beroza
said that while a short-term pre
diction may give ample time to
evacuate buildings and shut down
nuclear power plants before the
earthquake, buildings would still
collapse if they are not strong
enough. "Prediction is only part
of living with earthquakes," he
said.
Nonetheless, if scientists

could someday learn to predict
earthquakes, "it would be a great
benefit to society, especially in
countries where building struc
tures are not as strong as they
are here or in Japan," said
Ellsworth.
Ellsworth and Beroza's
research may also allow scientists
to predict the size of an earth
quake based on the first few sec
onds of tremors.
According to Ellsworth, there
may be a correlation between the
size and duration of the beginning
phase and magnitude of the
earthquake. If this correlation

holds true, it may be possible to
predict the size of an earthquake
based on the beginning few sec
onds of it. Ellsworth said that
while this discovery "may not be
useful in terms of issuing warn
ings, it does open the window into
the physics of earthquakes."
Beroza said, however, that it is
difficult to tell for sure what the
variation in the length of this
beginning phase might mean.
The earthquakes the pair stud
ied include Imperial Valley of
1979, Mexico City of 1985, Loma
Prieta of 1989, Landers of 1992
and Northridge of 1994.
