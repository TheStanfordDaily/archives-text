Japanese cult leader arrested
KAMIKUISHIKI, Japan (AP) â€” Police arrest
ed doomsday cult leader Shoko Asahara yesterday
in connection with the nerve-gas attack on
Tokyo's subways two months ago, culminating in
Japan's biggest-ever investigation.
Reports said the bearded, blind guru was alone
and meditating in a steel-plated mezzanine
between floors of a chemical-storage building
when police burst in. He was said to be in good
condition.
Thick fog shrouded the rural compound near
Mount Fuji where he was seized, and hundreds of
police could be seen milling about. Hundreds of
reporters and cameramen were gathered outside
the compound.
As an armored, partly curtained police vehicle
drove Asahara away, he was briefly visible, sitting
in the back, clad in his trademark purple robes.

The arrest came almost four hours after thou
sands of police armed with warrants launched
simultaneous dawn raids nationwide against the
Aum Shinri Kyo cult.
Thirteen others also were arrested at the com
pound and other cult facilities, news reports said.
Police said they planned to charge Asahara and
a score of his followers with murder or attempted
murder in the March 20 attack that left 12 people
dead and 5,500 others sickened.
The raids came as press reports said two key
cult members had confessed their roles in the
attack. Police told reporters yesterday they had
proof of the cult's involvement in the attack.
"We have obtained evidence that the sect has
produced sarin within its compound and discov
ered its members who were involved in the
attacks on the subways," said Shieaki Ishikawa, a
chief detective. Sarin is the nerve gas that perme
ated the subway.
