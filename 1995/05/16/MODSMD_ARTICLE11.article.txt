# China tests nuclear weapon

BEIJING (AP) — China con
ducted an underground nuclear
test yesterday, just days after
more than 170 nations agreed to
indefinitely extend the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Today's test was the first of
five China is expected to conduct
by the end of 1996. The last test
explosion occurred Oct. 7.
The official Xinhua news agen
cy did not say when or where the
test took place, but the Aus
tralian Seismological Center
monitored the blast and said it
was at Lop Nor, in the Xinjiang
region of far-western China. It
estimated the blast was equiva
lent to 40 to 150 kilotons of dyna
mite.
China has continued to con
duct nuclear tests in defiance of

an international moratorium and
calls from the United States,
Japan and others to stop.
The Foreign Ministry
spokesman who announced
today's explosion said China will
stop nuclear testing once a com
prehensive test ban treaty is
implemented.
The test comes as China's offi
cial defense budget is projected to
increase more than 20 percent in
1995. China is also being more
assertive militarily — especially
over the disputed Spratly Islands
in the South China Sea.
Japan immediately lodged a
formal protest and Gareth Evans,
Australia's foreign minister, said
it was "deeply disappointing" that
China had once again disregarded
opposition to nuclear testing.

"China and other nuclear
weapons states must come to
terms with the imminent fact of a
ban on nuclear testing for all time
and in all environments," Evans
said today.
Leif Nordgren, a seismologist
at the Swedish defense research
agency FOA, called the blast
"rather small." He said seismolo
gists recorded movement measur
ing 6.1 in magnitude just before
noon in Beijing.
A global conference in New
York last Thursday decided to
permanently extend the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty. The
treaty allows only China and the
other four declared nuclear power
— the United States, Britain,
Russia and France — to legiti
mately possess nuclear weapons.
