## Editorials A 						real deal for sophs 
### 
FIRST YEAR Stanford stu
dents — like other college
frosh across the country —
often complain about the lack of
intimacy and opportunity to
interact on a personal level with
their professors. The problem is
accentuated if the instructor is
an academic celebrity. Often, stu
dents feel like they need a tele
scope to see those big names
touted in the admissions catalog.
But now, Stanford faculty and
administrators have invented an
experimental program called the
Sophomore College, which gives
students a chance to work with
renowned faculty early in their
undergraduate careers and deals
with the infamous "sophomore
slump" all in one shot.
On the surface, the College
seems like over-glorified summer
school. As if getting into Stan
ford wasn't enough, now frosh
have to apply for this program.
But upon closer inspection, the

Sophomore College is an innova
tive idea.
Once accepted, sophomores
return three weeks prior to the
beginning of the academic year to
participate in small classes with
top scholars like Condoleezza Rice
and Ramon Saldi'var. Students
receive University credit and best
of all, it's completely free.
Similar programs have already
proven their worth. The Ameri
can Indian Program Center
hosts a successful pre-frosh ori
entation program to prepare stu
dents for the competitive speed
of Stanford classes. If such
accomplishments can be trans
planted to prevent sophomore
burnout, then Stanford's pro
gram will improve scholastic
achievement.
Like the students who bravely
adventured to attend the new
Stanford campus in 1891, we
hope that this pioneering pro
gram will be an equal success.
