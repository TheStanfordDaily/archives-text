# The
						rain must stop

### 
IN THE IMMORTAL words of
Annie Lennox, "Here comes the
rain again." Yes, this year at
Stanford we are lucky enough to
experience meteorological condi
tions usually found in the buggy
tropics of South America. "January
in May," "cats and dogs," "sheep
and elephants" â€” whatever you
call it, the downpour is again plagu
ing our idyllic campus.
As with any biblical plight, ter
rors never come in the singular.
Along with plenty of precipitation
pouring from above, mosquitoes
and other bugs, which would make
natives of the Amazon cower and
halogen lights scream, are torment
ing the good citizens of Stanford.
But even more frightening are
the overwhelming boredom and
claustrophobia which manifest in
California-80-degrees-sunny-and
blue-accustomed students, forced
to quarantine themselves and
study instead of working on their
golden tans.

If the University is not careful,
there could be widespread revolu
tion. Students will demand better
weather for their high tuition.
Clouds, fog, anything below 75
degrees will drive demonstrators to
White Plaza in unprecedented
masses. After all, everyone noticed
the brief but complete cessation of
the rain during Admit Weekend. Do
pro fros deserve better weather
than certified Stanford students
and other related entities?
If the University really wants to
quell the brewing rebellion under
the gray, stormy skies, it should
further emphasize the benefits of
having a lake (and necessarily, the
rain). Colossal, amusement-park
quality water slides on the lake
would undoubtedly relieve the ris
ing tensions on campus. For those
without coordination or the finan
cial means to pay for elitist sports
such as sailing or wind-surfing,
waterslides are the perfect solu
tion.
