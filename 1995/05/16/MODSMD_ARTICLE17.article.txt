## Gay liberation revisited 
### 
IT'S BEEN A YEAR. One year exactly
since the "Gay Liberation" statue was
defaced by seven Stanford students.
You ask yourself, "Why is that important
to me? The guys who were involved in the
vandalism were heard and penalized
accordingly, and the statue has been
repaired. So why is it being dredged up
again?"
Several reasons jump to mind. The
first is that institutional memory is short,
and we tend to forget things at an incred
ibly fast rate. Perhaps this incident is
something we should remember before
we make claims that Stanford is a place
where all people can feel comfortable,
regardless of gender, race, culture, dis
ability or sexual orientation. In a way, it
serves as a reminder that there is a lot of
latent anger and intolerance toward cer
tain communities on this campus.
Perhaps more importantly, it serves as
a starting point for a discussion on dis
course, freedom of expression and the cre
ation of space for people's ideas. One year
after this incident occurred, has anything
changed on this campus? Has there been
any further discussion of what happened?
My first instinct is to say that little has
changed. Soon after the vandalism, the
furor died down, and when the statue was
repaired, most people forgot that any
thing happened. Today, the queer com
munity on campus might organize a show
of remembrance, but who does this really
affect? Only those who want to be affect

ed. The people who show up for these cer
emonies are the ones who are aware of
the issues at hand and who support the
people who put on the commemorations.
So, the question arises: What do we, as
a university and a community, do about
people who disagree with the different
ideas and lifestyles on campus? In
regards to the vandalized statue, do we
have a responsibility to raise awareness
and educate people who simply don't
want to have anything to do with people
who are different? Or do we allow people
to believe whatever they want, even if it
is blatantly homophobic? After all, these
people have every right to believe what
ever they want to. The University might
not agree with what they are thinking,
and the bulk of the student body might
be upset or disgusted by it, but like it or
not, they have the right to be sexist,
racist, homophobic and bigoted in any
way that they please. Making generaliza
tions and living by stereotypes is not
against the law.
Instead of waiting for incidents like
the vandalism to occur, perhaps we
should look at ways of dealing with diffi
cult issues before people become physi
cally or verbally violent. A safe first step
is trying to increase the amount of dis
course between students. The University
tries to do this by bringing interesting
speakers to campus, and also through
Res Ed; in general, we are matched up
with people who are quite different from
us as frosh roommates, and we get a large

dose of another perspective on life from
them. It's a good start, but it becomes
patently clear that people sort them
selves out within the first year or two so
that, by senior year, we are living with
people who, to some extent, share our
values.
So, back to the starting point. How do
we increase discourse when the Universi
ty's systems don't reach us anymore?
How do we address a student who says
that one of the main reasons he lives in a
fraternity house is so he doesn't have to
deal with issues of feminism and sexual
orientation? How do we start constructive
dialogue about gay men between a frater
nity member and a person who says she
generally doesn't trust people who are
members of the Greek system?
Clearly, there is no easy way to
increase levels of tolerance and under
standing on campus. Yet this is a chal
lenge that we face, and it is our obligation
as members of this community to con
front these issues and open up discourse;
the type of discourse in which you can
voice your true opinion, but also have
your assumptions and stereotypes chal
lenged and broken, regardless of who you
are.

Congratulations to Angie, Laura and Jen
on your first day of freedom. I'm so jeal
ous.
