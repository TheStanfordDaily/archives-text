A fond farewell to a most beloved Portuguese professor

-IWAS DEEPLY saddened to hear of
the sudden death of Karin Van den
Dool, my professor of Portuguese.
Karin was one of the most encouraging,
warm and bitingly funny professors that
I have known here at Stanford. Her
standards were high — she was demand
ing and exact. She gave a lot of herself to
her students but also expected them to
give a lot back.
Before I began here, when I told a
friend that I was going to study Por
tuguese at Stanford, he told me that he
had studied Portuguese here some 13
years ago, and he still remembered his
professor, Karin Van den Dool, as one of
the best professors he had. He was right.

I had Karin's class every day since
September, and through her warmth
and wit, our small class grew close. She
tailored her teaching to our needs and
interests. When I asked about the
Japanese community in Brazil, she dug
up articles on that subject and assigned
them to us. When another person
expressed interest in the author Fernan
do Sabino, she assigned his stories to us.
When someone expressed interest in the
architecture of Brasilia, she showed
slides from her last trip there.
Every quarter she developed her own
teaching materials, including that horri
ble green grammar book, where she
assigned us endless exercises on the sub

junctive. But, even there, her sense of
humor emerged. What was the last exer
cise? Something like Puxa vidal If I were
Brazilian I wouldn't have to study the
subjunctive because I'd already know it.
Class with Karin was never dull. Dur
ing those 50 minutes — which invariably
spilled over to 55 or 60 minutes without
a person moving from their chair — she
enthralled us with stories (all in Por
tuguese) about her childhood in Rio de
Janeiro and her difficulties in adapting
to life in the U.S. She told us hilarious
stories about the clash of two cultures,
often poking fun at herself in a gentle
way. She encouraged us to talk, to speak
up, to tell stories and to be creative in

the essays we wrote for her.
Karin not only taught us Portuguese,
but through her unflagging sense of
humor, she taught us something ever
lasting — to laugh at ourselves, to take
life a bit easier and to enjoy life. She cer
tainly did.
In a gesture typical of her warmth, to
say good-bye and wish us well at the end
of the year, Karin had invited the class
to a Brazilian dinner of fcijoada at her
house next weekend. Now, instead, we
will be saying our good-byes to her. I will
miss her very much.
