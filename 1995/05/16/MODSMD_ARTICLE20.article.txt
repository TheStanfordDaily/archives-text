## Affirmative action's effects on students and faculty Preferential admission hurts all students 
### Reagan Demas 
DISCUSSING THE issue of affir
mative action is like harassing a
rattlesnake, but here's a more
realistic look at the controversy:
Much of what is known as affirma
tive action is of a subtle form of finan
cial discrimination that has weaseled its
way into college admissions. The pro
cess by which the government doles out
federal financial aid to college students
is aimed to benefit those parents that
cannot afford to send their children to
college at all. If you are living from
hand-to-mouth every day, your child is
guaranteed heavy subsidization from
the government. And that's fine, con
sidering that, without federal aid, those
children would not be able to afford the
opportunities that they deserve.
The government, however, has set up
its aid program so that families with
any money at all don't receive enough
aid to send their children to college.
This disparity leaves the families in the
middle left to fend for themselves. Both
families that have moderate incomes
and those on a subsistence level, in the
end, are left with nothing.
As a result of subtleties like this, a
system of affirmative action rests in

place in America's colleges. A middle
class family may be unwilling to make
the tremendous sacrifice to send their
child to an expensive school, while the
child of a poor family benefits from
enormous governmental aid and is able
to receive a better education.
Affirmative action of this type even
tually leads to strange formulas in col
lege admissions procedures. Believe me,
it's no coincidence that some law
schools have a 49.8 to 50.2 percent
breakdown of women to men. If the
numbers were any farther apart, the
equation would be "faulty."
These colleges are forgetting is that
the world doesn't run on fixed equa
tions, fundamental theorems and ascer
tainable proofs. That's fine and dandy
in the sheltered microcosm of a college
campus, but in the real world, opportu
nities come to those who earn them.
Discrimination exists, and something
should be done about it, but affirmative
action in college admissions is not the
proper way to handle it.
The problems lie in the home. Stu
dents from inner-cities grow up in
homes plagued with violence, crime,
drugs and abuse. They do not have
access to the opportunities found else
where, and even those who are diligent
and courageous are unable to do what
ever they want to do in life. They are
locked in step with a moral and ethical
degeneracy that has plagued our cities
for years.

The solutions must focus there — on
the family, the home, the early school
ing and the availability of opportunities
before college. If we ignore the root of
the problem we face in the real world —
racism in the workplace, disparate hir
ing practices, higher Asian and white
population in colleges — we are simply
allowing the problem to grow worse by
the day.
Until we implement possible solu
tions aimed to break the vicious cycle
early on, we cannot justify making blind
attempts to alleviate the problem in col
lege admissions. Our society has begun
implementing random solutions in ran
dom places, and these measures to avoid
the root problem fall way short of the
mark. In fact, they can even perpetuate
the problem by wearing a facade of res
olution.
We shouldn't be satisfied with simply
giving a few minorities entry into a col
lege of their choice. It's a start, but we
first must give them the chance to earn
their way there. An old Chinese proverb
states: "Give a man a fish, you feed him
for a day. Teach a man to fish, you feed
him for a lifetime." We cannot continue
to give potential college success stories
the catch-of-the-day when they apply
for admission. Let them pull the big one
in for themselves. Give them a pole
early in life and a pond free from vio
lence and poverty to explore, and they'll
be eating halibut steak for the rest of
their lives.
