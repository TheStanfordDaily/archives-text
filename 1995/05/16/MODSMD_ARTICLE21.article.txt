# Many cultural perspectives benefit Anthropology Dept

### George Collier 
I JOINED THE Anthropology Department in 1969
as perhaps the last of those hired by the "old boy"
networks. In those days, there wasn't any public
advertising for faculty positions. Department heads
simply got on the phone to the leading anthropology
schools — Chicago, Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford — to
ask who were the hot shots among their students. It
was easy to find people with good qualifications —
that's not the question. But my department had
never once brought a woman to the tenure-line facul
ty, even though women were earning over half the
degrees in the field.

Stanford's Anthropology Department began to
take affirmative action seriously in the 19705. That
meant advertising faculty positions and taking steps
to encourage the application of women and minori
ties. It meant studying the full range of people's qual
ifications and accomplishments, not just their repu
tations. It meant much more painstaking searches
and better ones; almost all of our younger faculty
gained tenure under Stanford's rigorous standards
for distinguished scholarship and teaching.
In the process, the department has gone from hav
ing no women and two non-white male faculty mem
bers in the 1960s to having six women and six ethnic
minority Americans (three of which are both) among
our 17 members today. The women and minorities
among our faculty have helped us lead the discipline
in the development of theory. A revolution in studies
of kinship and social organization was stimulated by

gender theory in anthropology, much of which origi
nated at Stanford. And our department is leading
studies of the changes going on around the world
today in ethnicity, cultural citizenship and identity.
Every one of us has had our work enriched by the
diverse perspectives and originality of our colleagues'
scholarship.
Yet affirmative action needs to continue, even in
anthropology, which has benefitted from affirmative
action recruiting of faculty and students for 25 years.
It will probably take two or three more academic gen
erations, for example, to bring our faculty gender
ratio into balance with that of students in graduate
programs of anthropology, which are over 55 percent
women. But, more to the point, we can't afford to
give up the affirmative quest to train and hire the
most original, creative and accomplished talent in the
field.
