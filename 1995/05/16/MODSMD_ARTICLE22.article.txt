ATHENS, Ga. — "We went in confi
dent. We respected them but definitely
didn't fear them."
Going into yesterday's NCAA semi
final match against No. 4 UCLA (19-5
overall, 7-4 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence), junior Ricky Becker and the
Stanford men's tennis team (25-0, 11-
0) had a right to be confident. After all,
Dick Gould's men had beaten the Bru
ins this year in Louisville, Los Angeles
and Palo Alto.
Now they can add Athens to that
list. After the Cardinal's 4-1 rout at
Henry Feild Stadium, Bruin head
coach Billy Martin was left shaking his
head.
"I guess after you get beaten four
times, you have got to admit they are
the better team. I felt we could beat
them, but I don't know if the guys real
ly thought they could," Martin said.
The Bruins certainly started out
looking like they could score the upset.
They snatched the doubles point from

the Cardinal for the first time this
week, thus gaining a 1-0 advantage and
some momentum going into the singles
matches.
But the Bruins never seemed to
have even a prayer in singles, losing
four consecutive matches before you
could even say "choke."
Not to say that the Cardinal itself
did not rise to the occasion. No. 6 Jeff
Salzenstein began the comeback
turned-rout by making fast work of
UCLA's top player, No. 37 senior
Robert Janacek, 6-1, 6-2. It was the
Canadian's third loss of the year
against Stanford's junior captain.
"Salzenstein put in a high percent
age of his first serves today, and that
was his strong suit," Janacek said. "I
think I could have kept us in it a little
longer, if I had executed on some of my
shots better in the first set."
In No. 3 singles, the Cardinal's No.
41 Paul Goldstein took apart fellow
freshman No. 52 Justin Gimelstob 6-0,
6-1. Goldstein had the much-vaunted
Gimelstob doing impressions of Zorro
with his Dunlop stick. The problem
was that there was no ball in front of
him — point after point, the New Jer
sey native with professional aspirations
was swinging at the air in frustration.
"Gimelstob played the worst match
I think I've ever seen him play," Martin
said.

Goldstein said he was "not overly
confident" after losing his doubles
match, but that he "really came out
fired up" and that "the first point of
the match really set the tone — a solid
return of Gimelstob's serve and a fore
hand winner."
Gimelstob had defeated Goldstein 6-
2,6-2 in their last meeting in Los Ange
les, but yesterday's result was a dra
matic reversal of fortunes.
"Justin's a good player. He just had
an off day, and I was fortunate to be on
the receiving end," Goldstein said.
Gimelstob's lackluster performance
forced him to think twice about forego
ing his final three years of eligibility for
a shot at the big bucks on the pro cir
cuit.
With measured words spoken in
monotone by the usually animated
Gimelstob, he announced after the
match, "After winning one game in my
last match, the chances of me turning
pro are not good."
With two quick victories under its
belt, the Cardinal looked in good shape
on all the other courts. In No. 2 singles,
freshman Scott Humphries had won
his first set and was serving in the sec
ond. Junior Jim Thomas had pulled out
a first-set tiebreak on Court 4 and was
en route to another tiebreak in the sec-

ond. While sophomore Grant
Elliott had split sets on Court 5,
junior Ricky Becker had won his
first set and was up a break in
the second on Court 6.
Becker was the next Cardinal
off the court, coming up with a
6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory over Eric
Lin. Becker's win was his second
in as many tries this year
against the Bruin sophomore.
"I played a good tie-break,
and I fought well," Becker said.
"But I definitely did not play
good tennis."
After that, the Cardinal need
ed just one more win in the three
matches remaining in order to
clinch a trip to the NCAA cham
pionships. Both Thomas and
Humphries reached potentially
match-clinching tiebreakers in
their matches at the same time.
But meanwhile, Elliott was
about to clinch the match for the
Cardinal for the second time in
the tournament. He used an
early two-break cushion in the
third set to defeat Matt Breen 4-
6, 6-1, 6-3.
A freshman from Australia,
Breen had split matches with
Elliott this season, breaking
Elliott's 18-match win streak

last month in Palo Alto. Yester
day Breen again gave Elliott
trouble, but Elliott was able to
come through like he has all
tournament and all season long.
"I was just frustrated because
the first set was pretty bad,"
Elliott said. "He was hitting
some good shots, and my base
line game was nonexistent. Then
in the second set, the more I
pressured him, the more he
started missing. I wasn't sure
what was going on in the other
matches, but I wasn't going to
lose mine."
That confidence is what
Gould thinks typifies his squad.
"[After losing the doubles point]
you've got to get on with it. I
have a lot of confidence in my
guys' ability to bounce back.
What makes this team so strong
is the confidence they have in
each other. When one or two
guys don't pull through, they
know the other guys will be there
to pick them up," Gould said.
Stanford sustained its two
doubles losses at the Nos. 1 and 2
positions. Second-ranked
Humphries and Goldstein were
downed by No. 18 Janacek and
Lin, 8-5, after Goldstein was bio
ken while serving at 4-5. And No.
54 Thomas and Becker were
defeated by Taino and Gimelstob
(whose good doubles play did not
carry over into singles), 8-1.

Elliott and Salzenstein contin
ued to roll in No. 3 doubles, beat
ing Breen and Montgomery, 8-3.
But as the Bruins' head coach
pointed out, the match was far
from over after doubles action.
"Earlier in the year, we had

Stanford down 3-1 at our place
and had match points all over
the place," Martin said, "but
Stanford came back and won.
The one thing you learn in col
lege tennis is you are never out
of it."
