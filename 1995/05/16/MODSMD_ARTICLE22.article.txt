ATHENS, Ga. — "We went in confi
dent. We respected them but definitely
didn't fear them."
Going into yesterday's NCAA semi
final match against No. 4 UCLA (19-5
overall, 7-4 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence), junior Ricky Becker and the
Stanford men's tennis team (25-0, 11-
0) had a right to be confident. After all,
Dick Gould's men had beaten the Bru
ins this year in Louisville, Los Angeles
and Palo Alto.
Now they can add Athens to that
list. After the Cardinal's 4-1 rout at
Henry Feild Stadium, Bruin head
coach Billy Martin was left shaking his
head.
"I guess after you get beaten four
times, you have got to admit they are
the better team. I felt we could beat
them, but I don't know if the guys real
ly thought they could," Martin said.
The Bruins certainly started out
looking like they could score the upset.
They snatched the doubles point from

the Cardinal for the first time this
week, thus gaining a 1-0 advantage and
some momentum going into the singles
matches.
But the Bruins never seemed to
have even a prayer in singles, losing
four consecutive matches before you
could even say "choke."
Not to say that the Cardinal itself
did not rise to the occasion. No. 6 Jeff
Salzenstein began the comeback
turned-rout by making fast work of
UCLA's top player, No. 37 senior
Robert Janacek, 6-1, 6-2. It was the
Canadian's third loss of the year
against Stanford's junior captain.
"Salzenstein put in a high percent
age of his first serves today, and that
was his strong suit," Janacek said. "I
think I could have kept us in it a little
longer, if I had executed on some of my
shots better in the first set."
In No. 3 singles, the Cardinal's No.
41 Paul Goldstein took apart fellow
freshman No. 52 Justin Gimelstob 6-0,
6-1. Goldstein had the much-vaunted
Gimelstob doing impressions of Zorro
with his Dunlop stick. The problem
was that there was no ball in front of
him — point after point, the New Jer
sey native with professional aspirations
was swinging at the air in frustration.
"Gimelstob played the worst match
I think I've ever seen him play," Martin
said.

Goldstein said he was "not overly
confident" after losing his doubles
match, but that he "really came out
fired up" and that "the first point of
the match really set the tone — a solid
return of Gimelstob's serve and a fore
hand winner."
Gimelstob had defeated Goldstein 6-
2,6-2 in their last meeting in Los Ange
les, but yesterday's result was a dra
matic reversal of fortunes.
"Justin's a good player. He just had
an off day, and I was fortunate to be on
the receiving end," Goldstein said.
Gimelstob's lackluster performance
forced him to think twice about forego
ing his final three years of eligibility for
a shot at the big bucks on the pro cir
cuit.
With measured words spoken in
monotone by the usually animated
Gimelstob, he announced after the
match, "After winning one game in my
last match, the chances of me turning
pro are not good."
With two quick victories under its
belt, the Cardinal looked in good shape
on all the other courts. In No. 2 singles,
freshman Scott Humphries had won
his first set and was serving in the sec
ond. Junior Jim Thomas had pulled out
a first-set tiebreak on Court 4 and was
en route to another tiebreak in the sec-
