MALIBU, Calif. — Less than 24 hours
after a miraculous come-from-behind, des
peration victory, the emotions of the Stan
ford women's tennis squad (23-3) trans
formed from jubilant bliss to bottomless
emptiness on Monday, as second-seeded
Texas (25-3) ended the Cardinal's season
with a 5-1 victory in the semifinals of the
NCAA championships in Malibu.
The Lady Longhorns advanced to the
finals by taking five of six singles matches
from the third-seeded and third-ranked Car
dinal. Texas, after rolling over both Indiana
and Arizona State, looked crisp throughout
the match, which was postponed for three
hours due to heavy rain.
"They were certainly the best team
today," said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan. "They are very good athletes. They
can run, they can jump, they can hit hard.
That's pretty impressive."
Longhorn freshman Nomena Rasoloma
lala ended the Cardinal's championship aspi
rations with a victory over senior Amy
Chiminello in the No. 6 singles match.
Chiminello, usually the first player off the
court with a quick victory, was forced out of

her pre-match routine due to the tourna
ment's approach to the rain. Rasolomalala's
victory represented Chiminello's only defeat
of the year at the No. 6 spot.
Stanford's lone point of the day came from
the racket of senior Kim Shasby, who downed
freshman Farley Taylor in straight sets 6-3,
6-4. Shasby ended her dual match season on a
roll, as she won 11 of her final 13 matches.
Shasby utilized precise groundstrokes in the
first set to cruise to a 6-3 score. Still, Taylor
hung tight in the second. With Shasby need
ing to hold at 5-4 for the match, Taylor failed
to execute on four break points before Shasby
took advantage for the Cardinal.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva collided
head-on with Longhorn Cristma Moros in
the No. 4 singles match, which may have
represented a major turning point in the
day's competition. The two fought through a
tough first set. With De Silva leading 5-4,
Moros earned a break and came back to take
the set 7-5. De Silva, determined not to allow
that setback deter her, breezed through the
second set 6-1. Moros outlasted De Silva in
the third, breaking her to go up 4-1. She took
the maich 7-5, 1-6, 6-2.
Two top-20 players found themselves
opposite the net in the No. 2 match. Despite
falling to an early 2-0 deficit, Texas's Lucie
Ludvigova managed a break in the third
game and clawed her way to the first set win
against freshmen Ania Bleszynski, 6-4. Lud
vigova, with Bleszynski serving and down 6-
5 in the second set, ended the match with a

controversial call of a Bleszynski
shot deep into a corner. Bleszyns
ki, usually a mild-tempered com
petitor, looked in outrage to the
official, who did nothing.
"I think that Ania came close
to pulling that one out," Brennan
said. "If she had won the second
set, it would have been very inter
esting in the third."
The NCAAs top-seeded singles
player for the individual champi
onships later this week, Texas'
Kelly Pace, met Stanford All-
American Katie Schlukebir on the
No. 1 court. Pace defended the
hype by fighting off Schlukebir 6-
3, 6-4.
Anne Pastor provided the
Longhorns with their fourth point
in the No. 4 match against fresh
man Julie Scott with a 6-4, 6-2
straight-set win. Scott was visibly
fatigued after Sunday night's
marathon versus UCLA, in which
she battled over six hours in dual
match play. "Jule was hurting,"
Brennan said. "We considered
pulling her (for doublesj. I think
it's all for the best that we didn't
go too much longer. Julie could
have really gotten hurt. I was a lit
tle worried about her."
The entire Stanford team may
have been a little spent after the
previous night's emotional and
physical roller coaster, Brennan
admitted, but the loss could not
be completely attributed to that.
"They go pretty good when the
adrenaline starts, but by the
beginning of the second set, I
think you start to droop a little
bit. Intensity can only do so
much; you are controlled by your
physical condition. But you know,
we might not have won anyway.
All I'm saying is that we could
have played a little bit better, but
it may not have been enough.
Texas was very good; they were
not to be denied today."
The semifinal loss cannot over
shadow a tremendous season
which saw the young Cardinal
squad, with five underclassmen in
the regular lineup, win 23 dual
matches and a Pac-10 Conference
crown with a record of 10-0.
"This team is really good,"
Brennan said. "As I said vesterdav,

they're really tough. They've won
bigger matches than any other
team I've had. They've won huge
matches after being way, way
behind. Thus team played great."
The No. 1 doubles squad of
Bleszynski and Schlukebir also
earned a Pac-10 doubles champi
onship. Scott, Shasby and the
doubles tandem of Shasby and
sophomore Emily Burt all won
Pac-10 indoor championships.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir also
received membership to the All
Pac-10 first team, and Shasby
made the second team.
Brennan can still live in the
present as he will embark upon
this journey next year with the
same exact team. Shasby and
Chiminello, the squads' seniors
academically, still possess a year
of eligibility after redshirting due
to injury. Another summer of
recuperation for Chiminello and
junior co-captain Beth Berris can
only be advantageous, while Scott
and Bleszynski have adjusted to
the ropes of collegiate tennis and
will be ready to go next season.
"We've got the same group back,"
Brennan said. "They're going to
be a year older and a year better
and a little more experienced. I
think they're going to be hungri
er. I don't know if they can be
hungrier than they were this
year, but they're going to be hun
gry for that championship. I
think that people will improve. I
know that certain people are
poised right now to really take off
with their game.
"It's been my experience with
this team that they like to go
through things once. I think we'll
be better in a lot of situations
next year simply because we've
done it before."
For four members of the Car
dinal squad, the season remains
somewhat unfinished as they will
compete in this week's NCAA
individual championships in both
singles and doubles. In the singles
draw, Schlukebir sits one seat
ahead of the ninth-seeded
Bleszynski, while Shasby also
received entry to the draw. Scott,
a relatively high alternate, may
see action if a few players drop
out of the bracket. Bleszynski and
Schlukebir, seeded seventh in the
draw, and Shasby and Burt will
represent the Cardinal in the dou
bles competition.
