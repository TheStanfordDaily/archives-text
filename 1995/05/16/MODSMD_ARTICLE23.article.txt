MALIBU, Calif. — Less than 24 hours
after a miraculous come-from-behind, des
peration victory, the emotions of the Stan
ford women's tennis squad (23-3) trans
formed from jubilant bliss to bottomless
emptiness on Monday, as second-seeded
Texas (25-3) ended the Cardinal's season
with a 5-1 victory in the semifinals of the
NCAA championships in Malibu.
The Lady Longhorns advanced to the
finals by taking five of six singles matches
from the third-seeded and third-ranked Car
dinal. Texas, after rolling over both Indiana
and Arizona State, looked crisp throughout
the match, which was postponed for three
hours due to heavy rain.
"They were certainly the best team
today," said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan. "They are very good athletes. They
can run, they can jump, they can hit hard.
That's pretty impressive."
Longhorn freshman Nomena Rasoloma
lala ended the Cardinal's championship aspi
rations with a victory over senior Amy
Chiminello in the No. 6 singles match.
Chiminello, usually the first player off the
court with a quick victory, was forced out of

her pre-match routine due to the tourna
ment's approach to the rain. Rasolomalala's
victory represented Chiminello's only defeat
of the year at the No. 6 spot.
Stanford's lone point of the day came from
the racket of senior Kim Shasby, who downed
freshman Farley Taylor in straight sets 6-3,
6-4. Shasby ended her dual match season on a
roll, as she won 11 of her final 13 matches.
Shasby utilized precise groundstrokes in the
first set to cruise to a 6-3 score. Still, Taylor
hung tight in the second. With Shasby need
ing to hold at 5-4 for the match, Taylor failed
to execute on four break points before Shasby
took advantage for the Cardinal.
Sophomore Sandra De Silva collided
head-on with Longhorn Cristma Moros in
the No. 4 singles match, which may have
represented a major turning point in the
day's competition. The two fought through a
tough first set. With De Silva leading 5-4,
Moros earned a break and came back to take
the set 7-5. De Silva, determined not to allow
that setback deter her, breezed through the
second set 6-1. Moros outlasted De Silva in
the third, breaking her to go up 4-1. She took
the maich 7-5, 1-6, 6-2.
Two top-20 players found themselves
opposite the net in the No. 2 match. Despite
falling to an early 2-0 deficit, Texas's Lucie
Ludvigova managed a break in the third
game and clawed her way to the first set win
against freshmen Ania Bleszynski, 6-4. Lud
vigova, with Bleszynski serving and down 6-
5 in the second set, ended the match with a
