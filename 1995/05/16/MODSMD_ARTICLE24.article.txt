# Top-ranked Wildcats too much for softball

The Stanford softball team's performance
in its final doubleheader of the 1995 season
demonstrated how frustrating a year Pacific
10 Conference play has been for the youthful
Cardinal. Despite marked improvement, Stan

ford is still overmatched by its more experi
enced and more talented Pac-10 opponents.
The Cardinal's frustration ended Friday
with a doubleheader sweep at the hands of
No.l and two-time defending national cham
pion Arizona at El Camino Field. The Wildcats
won the first game 12-0 and followed that
with an 8-0 shutout in the nightcap.
Arizona (59-4 overall, 23-3 in the Pacific 10
Conference) dominated Stanford (15-35, 1-25)
at the plate and in the field. The Wildcats col
lected 29 hits in the two games, while holding
the Cardinal to four. Arizona stretched its cur
rent winning streak to 20 games with the two
wins. Stanford, on the other hand, failed to
score in its second consecutive doubleheader.

Until last weekend's doubleheader at Wash
ington, the Cardinal had scored in every twin
bill but one.
"We ran into some really hot pitchers," said
Stanford head coach Sandy Pearce. "[Cari]
Dolan, [Nancy] Evans and [Stephanie] Burns
are three of the top pitchers in the country.
It's difficult for anyone to score off of them."
Arizona jumped on the Cardinal early in
game one, scoring twice in the first inning and
four more times in the second to take an early
6-0 lead. Unlike the previous meeting between
the two teams, where the Wildcats blasted the
Cardinal for 25 runs in the opening game
alone, Stanford was able to keep
its composure and stay in the
game. Sophomore pitcher Angela
Webb held Arizona scoreless in
the third and fourth innings.
"Those two innings were
important for us," Pearce said.
"It helps our confidence [for next
season) to know we can be com
petitive when we play well."
Webb, who has been forced to
pitch every inning of every game
since the departure of freshman
Jessica Schulman due to a stress
fracture in her back, was unable
to hold down the Wildcats for an
extended period of time. The
Wildcats scored twice in the fifth
and four times in the sixth to
end the game with a 12-0 victo

ry"
Outfielder Lety Pineda provid
ed much of the offense for Ari
zona, smacking two home runs in
the game. She also drove in four
runs and scored three times. First
baseman Laura Espinoza, who
leads the Pac-10 and the nation
with a staggering 30 home runs
and 110 RBIs in just 63 games,
drove in two with a triple in the
fifth.
"Arizona's strength is their
offense," Pearce said. "You just
can't seem to hold them down for
long. Angela pitched well, but you
have to hand it to them for hitting
her best pitches."
Wildcat Nancy Evans limited
the Cardinal to two hits over six
innings of work. Evans walked
one batter and struck out four
while improving to 27-3. Webb
fell to 8-27 with the loss.
Game two began much the

same way as game one, with a
two-run Arizona rally. Two more
runs in the second, fourth and
fifth provided the 8-0 margin.
Even more than in the opening
game, however, Stanford prevent
ed the Wildcats from the big
innings that haunted them when
the teams met in Arizona.
"We stayed in it [defensively]
pretty well," Pearce said. "As
good of hitters as they are, it was
a credit to us that they didn't
have any big innings."
Pineda again sparked the Wild
cats, driving in two in the second
with a triple. Espinoza also drove
in two runs, as the 3-4-5 series of
the Wildcat batting order collect
ed seven hits. Doubles by Jenny
Dalton and Amy Braatz drove in
the other three runs for Arizona.
A big factor in Stanford's abili
ty to prevent the big inning was
the job Webb did on senior All-

American Amy Chellevold. Earli
er this year, Chellevold reached
base every time she came to the
plate against Stanford. On Fri
day, the Wildcat sparkplug was
just 2-7 for the doubleheader.
"Angela handled her much bet
ter. She pitched her in on her
hands and jammed her a couple
times. A lot of (the Arizona hit
ters] are susceptible to the inside
fastball."
Sophomore Cari Dolan kept
the Cardinal quiet with a two-hit
ter. The victory, Dolan's 30th win
of the season against just one loss,
was her 15th shutout of the year.
Over seven innings, Dolan didn't
walk anyone, while striking out
four Cardinal batters. With the
loss, Webb fell to 8-28.
"They're certainly No. 1 for a
reason," Pearce said. "It should
be a great battle between them
and [No. 2] UCLA for the title."
