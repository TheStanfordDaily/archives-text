# Top-ranked Wildcats too much for softball

The Stanford softball team's performance
in its final doubleheader of the 1995 season
demonstrated how frustrating a year Pacific
10 Conference play has been for the youthful
Cardinal. Despite marked improvement, Stan

ford is still overmatched by its more experi
enced and more talented Pac-10 opponents.
The Cardinal's frustration ended Friday
with a doubleheader sweep at the hands of
No.l and two-time defending national cham
pion Arizona at El Camino Field. The Wildcats
won the first game 12-0 and followed that
with an 8-0 shutout in the nightcap.
Arizona (59-4 overall, 23-3 in the Pacific 10
Conference) dominated Stanford (15-35, 1-25)
at the plate and in the field. The Wildcats col
lected 29 hits in the two games, while holding
the Cardinal to four. Arizona stretched its cur
rent winning streak to 20 games with the two
wins. Stanford, on the other hand, failed to
score in its second consecutive doubleheader.

Until last weekend's doubleheader at Wash
ington, the Cardinal had scored in every twin
bill but one.
"We ran into some really hot pitchers," said
Stanford head coach Sandy Pearce. "[Cari]
Dolan, [Nancy] Evans and [Stephanie] Burns
are three of the top pitchers in the country.
It's difficult for anyone to score off of them."
Arizona jumped on the Cardinal early in
game one, scoring twice in the first inning and
four more times in the second to take an early
6-0 lead. Unlike the previous meeting between
the two teams, where the Wildcats blasted the
Cardinal for 25 runs in the opening game
