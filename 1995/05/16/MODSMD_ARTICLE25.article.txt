# Cycling triumphs at West Coast Championships
## 
### Rajen Sheth Contributing writer 
For the first time in ten years,
the top-ranked Stanford cycling
team won the West Coast Cycling
Conference championship races
this weekend in San Luis Obispo.
Spurred on by impressive perfor
mances in the team time trial and
the women's A road race, the
team overcame its regular season
deficit to California, jumped out
to a big lead and never looked
back.
Stanford came into the race as
the second place team in the con
ference, trailing Cal 1,000-972 in
the season point totals, which car
ried over into this weekend's race.
The deficit was slim since the con

ference championship race counts
for almost half of the overall point
total, but Stanford still trailed.
The weekend consisted of a
team time trial, a road race and a
criterium. In the time trial, Stan
ford's strongest event, the Cardi
nal quickly made up that point
deficit as the team gained 158
points on Cal.
The teams had to fight cold
and rainy conditions in Southern
California throughout the week
end. "The time trial was a mess,"
said grad student Dave Bailey,
one of Stanford's strongest time
trial racers.
"I think the conditions favored
the most prepared and deter
mined squads," said coach Art
Walker.

Stanford certainly looked pre
pared as it won every category
convincingly. The men's A team
won by 12 seconds over UC-Santa
Barbara, and the men's B team,
led by a strong performance from
graduate student Ma-Ne
Rodriguez, defeated UC-Davis by
16 seconds. Senior Tracy Timms
led the women's A team as it won
by over one minute. Meanwhile,
Cal finished far behind, allowing
Stanford to take the overall lead.
The Cardinal expected to dom
inate the time trial as it has all
season and hoped that it could
hang on to the lead in the road
race and criterium. However,
instead of just treading water in
the road race, the team was pow
ered by a strong performance in

the women's A race and won the
event 204-201 over Cal.
"The road race went very well
for us, or very poorly for Cal,
depending how you look at it,"
said sophomore Ben Geiger.
Rain forced officials to cut the
men's A race back from 90 miles
to 60 miles, throwing off the
strategies of many cyclists. Junior
Andrew Lewis and graduate stu
dent Dario Falquier, the team
captain, were close to the lead at
the end of the race. Falquier went
into the race as the leader in the
season individual omnium stand
ings, and he tried to keep the lead
over Cal's John Lim.
However, near the finish, the
race was temporarily stopped
because car traffic had not been
blocked off the course by mistake.
In the sprint which ensued,
Falquier finished ninth. However,
the A team won the race narrowly.
Geiger, who finished second in
the weekend overall omnium, won
the men's D race, but none of the
other men's teams had strong per
formances. The real story was the
women's A team, who took the top
three places to attain 102 points
and destroy Cal, the second place
team, by almost 60 points.
After the first hill, there was a
leading group of five cyclists,
including Stanford's Timms and

graduate students Joan Wilson
and Megan Troxell. By the second
half of the race, the three Stan
ford cyclists were well ahead. The
pack rode together throughout
the race, but, at the end, Wilson
allowed Troxell to finish first in
order to give Troxell a lead in the
women's season omnium. Howev
er, doing so also ended Wilson's
hopes of winning the weekend
omnium.
"Joan should have won," said
Troxell. "But she gave up the win
for team tactics."
In the women's B race, gradu
ate student Laurie Koloski placed
third in just her first year of colle
giate cycling.
"Laurie is the poster child for
the Stanford cycling club," said
Walker. "By this I mean she is an
example of an otherwise ordinary

Stanford student whose chief
resource was perseverance. Riders
like Laurie provide me with at least
as much inspiration to continue
coaching as the category A stars."
The team went into the criteri
um, its weakest event, with a
strong lead. The A teams per
formed well, winning their cate
gories. In the women's A race,
Timms, Wilson and Troxell once
again were in the lead pack. How
ever, in the final lap, Timms
crashed, but Wilson and Troxell
finished third and fifth.
The race gave Troxell the sea
son omnium title as Cal's Chris
Eckel failed to attain enough
points to move into first. The
team finished with enough points
to grab third place in the criteri
um and hold on to the champi
onship.
