# Cycling triumphs at West Coast Championships
##

For the first time in ten years,
the top-ranked Stanford cycling
team won the West Coast Cycling
Conference championship races
this weekend in San Luis Obispo.
Spurred on by impressive perfor
mances in the team time trial and
the women's A road race, the
team overcame its regular season
deficit to California, jumped out
to a big lead and never looked
back.
Stanford came into the race as
the second place team in the con
ference, trailing Cal 1,000-972 in
the season point totals, which car
ried over into this weekend's race.
The deficit was slim since the con

ference championship race counts
for almost half of the overall point
total, but Stanford still trailed.
The weekend consisted of a
team time trial, a road race and a
criterium. In the time trial, Stan
ford's strongest event, the Cardi
nal quickly made up that point
deficit as the team gained 158
points on Cal.
The teams had to fight cold
and rainy conditions in Southern
California throughout the week
end. "The time trial was a mess,"
said grad student Dave Bailey,
one of Stanford's strongest time
trial racers.
"I think the conditions favored
the most prepared and deter
mined squads," said coach Art
Walker.

Stanford certainly looked pre
pared as it won every category
convincingly. The men's A team
won by 12 seconds over UC-Santa
Barbara, and the men's B team,
led by a strong performance from
graduate student Ma-Ne
Rodriguez, defeated UC-Davis by
16 seconds. Senior Tracy Timms
led the women's A team as it won
by over one minute. Meanwhile,
Cal finished far behind, allowing
Stanford to take the overall lead.
The Cardinal expected to dom
inate the time trial as it has all
season and hoped that it could
hang on to the lead in the road
race and criterium. However,
instead of just treading water in
the road race, the team was pow
ered by a strong performance in

the women's A race and won the
event 204-201 over Cal.
"The road race went very well
for us, or very poorly for Cal,
depending how you look at it,"
said sophomore Ben Geiger.
Rain forced officials to cut the
men's A race back from 90 miles
to 60 miles, throwing off the
strategies of many cyclists. Junior
Andrew Lewis and graduate stu
dent Dario Falquier, the team
captain, were close to the lead at
the end of the race. Falquier went
into the race as the leader in the
season individual omnium stand
ings, and he tried to keep the lead
over Cal's John Lim.
However, near the finish, the
