# Rebels with a cause hope to derail men from perfect season

ATHENS, Ga. — Only one thing stands in
the way of an undefeated championship season
for the Cardinal men's tennis team. It's not a
bunch of Bulldogs guarding the NCAA champi
onship trophy with saliva dripping.
No doubt regional qualifier Mississippi (15-6)
was not expected to have the opportunity to sniff
the sweet smell of final round success. However,
after stunning No. 2 Georgia on its home court,
Henry Feild Stadium, in the semifinals, the
Southeastern Conference upstarts are on the
brink of the title.
Stanford defeated Ole Miss in its earlier meet
ing of the year at the USTA / ITA National Team
Indoors in February. The final score that day was
5-2, but today's match promises to be a lot closer.
For one thing, that matchup was on a faster
indoor surface — one which probably lent some
advantage to the Cardinal's attacking style of
play.
At least the home court will not be the major
factor as it would have been against Georgia.
The howling crowd of 4,000 Bulldog supporters
played a crucial role in the success of last year's
Georgia women's team, which defeated the Car
dinal 5-4 in the 1994 NCAA Women's Champi
onship. While the seats may be lined with a scat
tering of Rebel fans, the Cardinal will not have
to endure harassment from the
Bulldog faithful in its quest for
a 13th national crown.
"The whole year we basically
were anticipating playing Geor
gia on their home court," said
junior Jeff Salzenstein. "We
kind of imagined what it would
be like in front of their home
fans. Now I kind of imagine
more people rooting for us."
Mississippi features an
almost exclusively foreign con
tingent with little NCAA tour
nament experience. The Rebels
are not without big guns, how
ever, as they are led by the
270th-ranked player in the

world and No. 2 in the collegiate
ranks, Mahesh Bhupathi. Ole
Miss' singles starter topped
Salzenstein in the teams' prior
meeting 6-1, 3-6, 6-2. The
Rebels' doubles squads also
pulled out the point in the
February contest.
Still, Stanford's superior
depth makes the Cardinal a
heavy favorite. Stanford won all
five remaining singles matches
in the prior meeting. However,
head coach Dick Gould has
remained focused on winning
the next match.
"We are very happy to be in
the finals," Gould said. "We
played well to get there. Obvi
ously we want to win the thing,
and we are going to give it our
best shot. This team is better
than I thought it would be at

the beginning of the year, and it
has improved in every match."
Junior captain Jeff Salzen
stein is zeroing in on the nation
al title that eluded him and the
Cardinal in last year's 4-3 final
round loss to USC, ignoring the
hype that might surround Stan
ford's pursuit of their second
ever undefeated season, this
time without the services of a
young John McEnroe, who led
the 1978 Cardinal to NCAA
glory in Athens.
"As far as 23-0 goes, that's
behind us," Salzenstein said.
"This is a new season, and we're
going to keep saying that
because that is how we feel.
"[Mississippi's] a very talent
ed team, and even though they
have six losses, I'm not sur
prised they're here."
