# Trading my pen for the headset on KZSU
## 
### 
D| on't get me wrong. I love
my job here at The Daily.
It puts food on the table
and money in the Bookstore's
pockets. But my true love is my
other hobby, sportscasting on
KZSU. We don't even get paid
like those Daily guys.
I realized back in elementary
school that I did not have what
it took to be the next Larry Bird
or Dwight Clark. For starters,
the 1.5-inch vertical leap and
10-flat speed in the 60 were a
dead giveaway. But even then, I
sported a Howard Cosell
impression. I would goof
around with my friends and tell
it like it was. As somebody who
shoots 30 percent, I realized my
future was in the broadcast
booth, where I could criticize
people who shoot 40 percent.
This year, I finally got my
chance to don a headset. Enter
ing the school year, I expected
yet another year of pushing
buttons and doing chores at
KZSU. That all changed with a
phone call in late October from
current KZSU Sports head Kris
Atteberry, who was wondering
if I'd be interested in covering
women's basketball.
Atteberry didn't have to
twist my arm. Marc Oppen
heimer, a KZSU icon, was

returning for his second year of
play-by-play and would help get
his color guy up to speed with
the relatively unfamiliar world
of women's hoops. Marc might
not be particularly grateful for
that phone call, but at the time,
I was trying to dance in my
room.

Fortunately, my celebratory
jig didn't result in injury, but I
did break a bone in my left hand
just prior to the start of the sea
son. This meant that Marc, the
industrial engineering grad stu
dent who had been with KZSU
for five years, had to help carry
the undeclared sophomore's
bags. I learned that this would
not be the case once my hand
healed, but Marc was gracious
enough to help me out and
lighten the bag later on in the
year.
I learned the secret to Marc's


Rock
Solid
Jeremy
Stone
velvet broadcast voice (the pre
game Diet Pepsis, or at least lots of
liquid) and found out how much he
also missed cable, as we remem
bered Sports Center episodes in our
hotel room. I learned that the play
by-play guy does most of the talking
and that broadcasters have a lot of
homework to do.
There were few bad parts that
anybody would have removed from
women's basketball's storybook
season. Marc and I were fortunate
to accompany the squad on the road
and received a free trip to the Final
Four in Minneapolis for their
efforts. After three years of picking
the wrong season to broadcast win
ning teams, Marc finally got the
chance to broadcast a Final Four
game while the little rookie was
spoiled in his first go-round.
Oppenheimer will go on to a real
job next year in management con
sulting in his beloved Chicago, and
for the first time since early 1990,
KZSU will be absent of his services.
For all his time and dedication to
the station, it's only right that we
name an award after him.
I would have plenty of competi
tion vying for the coveted Oppie.
After all, KZSU covers more than
just women's basketball. With live
coverage of four other Stanford
sports (football, women's volleyball,
men's basketball and baseball), the
Zoo boasts the most variety of any
college station west of the Missis
sippi.
The men's basketball crew con
stantly competed with Marc and me
for air time due to overlapping con

tests. Since it's easier for most peo
ple to go to home games, the road
matchup was the one on the air.
Atteberry and junior Josh Green
called the first men's NCAA tour
nament hoops win in KZSU history
in March.
After honing his skills as the
only broadcaster in his native Mon
tana, Atteberry developed an
unparalleled stash of catch phrases.
"Three-ball, corner pocket" has
nothing to do with pool. Even
before this year, Green's fans have
proudly sported a T-shirt bearing
his likeness and the phrase, "Just
One Suave Hombre." Word has it
an Oppie t-shirt may be in the
works.
Atteberry also graces the air
waves of 90.1 FM calling Cardinal
baseball with fellow sports director
Danielle Sanchez. Much like The
Daily sports department, KZSU
Sports suffers from a shortage of
females in its ranks. But Sanchez
does more than her fair share, even
if she doesn't refer to home plate as
the "china" like her sidekick.
Dave Raymond, the women's
volleyball broadcaster, occasionally
spent the year without a sidekick.
Hailing from Gering, Neb., Ray
mond enjoyed the Cardinal's NCAA
title and the Huskers' football
crown in the span of just over two
weeks and lost an apartment to
boot. Nonetheless, Raymond has
earned a job after his stellar KZSU
career in the front office of Sono
ma's minor league baseball team.
Raymond was frequently assist
ed by a fellow double-duty
Daily / KZSU man, Rob Ross. The
one-time sports and Intermission
editor earned the praise of Ray
mond, who called him "kind of
effeminate."

The legendary "Four Horse
men" broadcast football but never
landed a guest like Richards. Tom
Baranowski called the shots with
the assistance of next year's sports
director Joe Karlgaard and Adam
Miller, along with sideline guy Troy
Clardy.
The Baron's most famous call
came as the color man to former
sports director Scott Walker in
1993, when he compared Cal's post
game celebration after regaining
the Axe to an orgasm. Karlgaard
scratched then-Oregon coach Rich
Brooks off his Christmas card list
with a memorable rebuke.Miller
also files Campus Cuisine reports
with KZSU News, and Clardy is
still smarting over the Broncos'
choke in 1994.
But there's more to KZSU
Sports than the voices you hear all
the time. Todd Bernstein, the only
other Daily / KZSU stud, hosted a
show in the winter and is poised for
more in the fall. All the first-year
guys, including Clent Brown, Dave
Flemming, Chris Kayser, Carter
Lipton and Ray Salloom do the
engineering. They sit in the studio
and press buttons for a couple
hours and make the whole thing
possible. Eventually, theirs will be
the voices you hear.
You'll also probably hear me for
the next two years. I haven't had
the chance to unveil my prize-win
ning Dick Vitale impression like I
expected. I haven't yet drooled over
a Kristin Folkl dunk. And after the
year Kate Paye had, there's no way
I could criticize her for shooting 38
percent.

Jeremy would like to thank 2,000-
plus people for the belated birthday
present.

tion vying for the coveted Oppie.
After all, KZSU covers more than
just women's basketball. With live
coverage of four other Stanford
sports (football, women's volleyball,
men's basketball and baseball), the
Zoo boasts the most variety of any
college station west of the Missis
sippi.
The men's basketball crew con
stantly competed with Marc and me
for air time due to overlapping con

tests. Since it's easier for most peo
ple to go to home games, the road
matchup was the one on the air.
Atteberry and junior Josh Green
called the first men's NCAA tour
nament hoops win in KZSU history
in March.
After honing his skills as the
only broadcaster in his native Mon
tana, Atteberry developed an
unparalleled stash of catch phrases.
"Three-ball, corner pocket" has
nothing to do with pool. Even
before this year, Green's fans have
proudly sported a T-shirt bearing
his likeness and the phrase, "Just
One Suave Hombre." Word has it
an Oppie t-shirt may be in the
works.
Atteberry also graces the air
waves of 90.1 FM calling Cardinal
baseball with fellow sports director
Danielle Sanchez. Much like The
Daily sports department, KZSU
Sports suffers from a shortage of
females in its ranks. But Sanchez
does more than her fair share, even
if she doesn't refer to home plate as
the "china" like her sidekick.
Dave Raymond, the women's
volleyball broadcaster, occasionally
spent the year without a sidekick.
Hailing from Gering, Neb., Ray
mond enjoyed the Cardinal's NCAA
title and the Huskers' football
crown in the span of just over two
weeks and lost an apartment to
boot. Nonetheless, Raymond has
earned a job after his stellar KZSU
career in the front office of Sono
ma's minor league baseball team.
Raymond was frequently assist
ed by a fellow double-duty
Daily / KZSU man, Rob Ross. The
one-time sports and Intermission
editor earned the praise of Ray
mond, who called him "kind of
effeminate."

The legendary "Four Horse
men" broadcast football but never
landed a guest like Richards. Tom
Baranowski called the shots with
the assistance of next year's sports
director Joe Karlgaard and Adam
Miller, along with sideline guy Troy
Clardy.
The Baron's most famous call
came as the color man to former
sports director Scott Walker in
1993, when he compared Cal's post
game celebration after regaining
the Axe to an orgasm. Karlgaard
scratched then-Oregon coach Rich
Brooks off his Christmas card list
with a memorable rebuke.Miller
also files Campus Cuisine reports
with KZSU News, and Clardy is
still smarting over the Broncos'
choke in 1994.
But there's more to KZSU
Sports than the voices you hear all
the time. Todd Bernstein, the only
other Daily / KZSU stud, hosted a
show in the winter and is poised for
more in the fall. All the first-year
guys, including Clent Brown, Dave
Flemming, Chris Kayser, Carter
Lipton and Ray Salloom do the
engineering. They sit in the studio
and press buttons for a couple
hours and make the whole thing
possible. Eventually, theirs will be
the voices you hear.
You'll also probably hear me for
the next two years. I haven't had
the chance to unveil my prize-win
ning Dick Vitale impression like I
expected. I haven't yet drooled over
a Kristin Folkl dunk. And after the
year Kate Paye had, there's no way
I could criticize her for shooting 38
percent.

Jeremy would like to thank 2,000-
plus people for the belated birthday
present.
