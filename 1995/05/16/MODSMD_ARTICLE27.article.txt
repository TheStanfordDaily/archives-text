# Trading my pen for the headset on KZSU

D| on't get me wrong. I love
my job here at The Daily.
It puts food on the table
and money in the Bookstore's
pockets. But my true love is my
other hobby, sportscasting on
KZSU. We don't even get paid
like those Daily guys.
I realized back in elementary
school that I did not have what
it took to be the next Larry Bird
or Dwight Clark. For starters,
the 1.5-inch vertical leap and
10-flat speed in the 60 were a
dead giveaway. But even then, I
sported a Howard Cosell
impression. I would goof
around with my friends and tell
it like it was. As somebody who
shoots 30 percent, I realized my
future was in the broadcast
booth, where I could criticize
people who shoot 40 percent.
This year, I finally got my
chance to don a headset. Enter
ing the school year, I expected
yet another year of pushing
buttons and doing chores at
KZSU. That all changed with a
phone call in late October from
current KZSU Sports head Kris
Atteberry, who was wondering
if I'd be interested in covering
women's basketball.
Atteberry didn't have to
twist my arm. Marc Oppen
heimer, a KZSU icon, was

returning for his second year of
play-by-play and would help get
his color guy up to speed with
the relatively unfamiliar world
of women's hoops. Marc might
not be particularly grateful for
that phone call, but at the time,
I was trying to dance in my
room.

Fortunately, my celebratory
jig didn't result in injury, but I
did break a bone in my left hand
just prior to the start of the sea
son. This meant that Marc, the
industrial engineering grad stu
dent who had been with KZSU
for five years, had to help carry
the undeclared sophomore's
bags. I learned that this would
not be the case once my hand
healed, but Marc was gracious
enough to help me out and
lighten the bag later on in the
year.
