# Seniors to take 'Wacky Walk'
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
After coming under fire for can
celing the Commencement proces
sion, the University administra
tion announced yesterday that the
procession will definitely happen
this year, said Senior Class Presi
dent Kevin Harrington.
This year, the procession will
begin at 9:30 a.m., with formal
graduation ceremonies starting at
10:15 a.m., Harrington said. Like
last year, the procession will last
30 minutes, and it will be followed
by the 15-minute faculty proces
sion.
The details of the procession —
whose reinstitution was proposed
a week ago — were finalized after
Harrington's meeting yesterday
with Lois Wagner, director of
Stanford Events.
Since graduation announce
ments have already been mailed
out, seniors will have to "tell par
ents to arrive by 9:15 or 9:30 to see
the procession," Harrington said.
The announcements tell parents
that the ceremonies begin at 9:45
a.m. with the faculty procession.
By having the procession at
9:30, the ceremony will be pushed
back by 15 minutes, said Eric
Chen, Senior Class president.
Students will also be expected
"to play a larger role in monitoring
themselves," Harrington said. He
said that he hopes that seniors will
not bring alcohol to the event,
though the policy is not to crack
down on students but to allow

them to enjoy the event.
Harrington said he hopes se
niors will "be sober enough for
graduation."
According to Chen, students
will also guide seniors during the
procession so the event is a little
more organized.
Chen, however, said the proces
sion will be "pretty much exactly
like last year's."
Instructions and details of the
procession will be included with se
nior cap and gowns, Harrington
said.
A committee composed of mem
bers of the senior class met with
Harrington late last week to dis
cuss the procession details. Har
rington represented the group by
presenting their decisions at the
meeting with Wagner.
Like previous years, seniors will
also be seated in the center section
of the Stanford Stadium grass,
Harrington said.
"I'm pleased since student ini
tiative got graduation back to how
they want it to be," Harrington
said. "The Senior Class thanks
students for their interest and ef
fort."
After the administrators an
nounced the canceling of the pro
cession, seniors protested the deci
sion and met over the past two
weeks. A group of seniors held a
rally in White Plaza last week,
complete with nudity and beer.
There was also a town hall
meeting last week that allowed
students to give input in the deci
sion to bring back the procession.
