# Hayes talks about empowering homeless
## A 						fascist society will emerge if the homeless are ignored, he contends 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
Dressed like a modern-day Robin
Hood in a belted tunic and lace-up suede
boots, Ted Hayes, advocate for the home
less and mastermind behind the Los An
geles "dome village," delivered an impas
sioned presentation on his work and
ideas to about 40 people in Branner
Lounge last night.

Hayes spoke for two hours about
Genesis I, the community of fiberglass
geodesic domes he founded in Los Ange
les in 1993 for the homeless. He also dis
cussed his philosophy, which he terms
EGIIPP — the Exodus Genesis Incen
tive Initiative Plan. His talk was spon
sored by the Homelessness in L.A. Pro
ject of Alternative Spring Break 1995.
"It's my Marshall Plan," said Hayes, a
former minister and Boy Scout. Ten

years ago, disillusioned with the peace
movement of the 1960s and '70s and
struggling in poverty with a wife and
four children, Hayes found himself be
coming more and more angry at the
prospect of a refrigerator filled with
"welfare food."
"It was like a voice inside me, the voice
of God, said, 'Ted, you talk too much. If
you know so much, you go do something
about it.'"

Hayes took the advice of his con
science and voluntarily became home
less. In 1985, on a vacant lot in a poverty
stricken area of Los Angeles, Hayes set
up a shantytown of old crates and rags
that eventually came to be known as Jus
ticeville. Bulldozed by the city, Jus
ticeville was temporarily forced out of ex
istence. It became the subject of a docu-
mentary Hayes showed at the
beginning of his talk and it is the
predecessor to the present-day
dome village near the Pasadena
freeway in downtown Los Angeles.
"I think you should be optimistic
about the future ... because we
don't really have a choice," Hayes
says in the documentary. "You
shouldn't throw us away. We're the
hope of the future."
Refusing to relinquish his con
viction that "one of the problems
that keeps people homeless is [that]
they're not able to have responsibil
ity for their own affairs," Hayes
wanted to continue the tradition of
Justiceville by building a new vil
lage for the homeless.
While Hayes did not envision
the architectural idea of domes, his
concept was one of a village mod
eled on the tribal concept. So; with a
quarter million-dollar grant from
the Arco Corporation, "I went shop
ping," he said.
He bought the fiberglass domes,

18 of which now make up Genesis I.
In addition, the village boasts a
kitchen, a community room and
bathrooms. It has its own security
chief, a head cook and a
groundskeeper.
"We're playing on the level of
human rights," Hayes said.
Hayes described the village as a
temporary home for people who
needed to regroup, for whatever
reason. "It's not a cure-all; it's a
tool to stabilize people," Hayes
said. He added that he hopes the
village, which has its own "tribal
social democracy" system, will
eventually be able to guide people
through nine- to 18-month transi
tional periods until they can
become "productive, responsible
citizens."
He warned, however, against
expecting homeless people to redi
rect themselves into what he
termed "the mainstream." Hayes
advised the audience to look in the
faces of the homeless they see on
the street for signs of bitterness.
What they would see, he predicted,
is "contentment, resolve and accli
mation to their environment."
"That's the nature of human

survival," he said.
Instead, Hayes offered, one must
"give [the homeless] a vision for
tomorrow," a different alternative.
To expect them to "climb all the
way back to the top" from where
they originally fell is unrealistic,
Hayes said.
Already, the idea of dome vil
lages is gaining recognition:
Britain's Prince Edward visited
Genesis I and praised it to Queen
Elizabeth 11, his mother; the domes
have been featured in prominent
architectural magazines. Several
countries, including Japan, Brazil
and South Africa, have expressed
interest in them. However, Hayes
sees the villages strictly as rein
forcement centers, not as an oppor
tunity to create the slums of the
'90s.
"We have got to go after the root
causes of homelessness," Hayes
said. "The government has the
responsibility not just to keep giv
ing" but to create environments in
which the homeless can take an
active part in shaping their futures.
"Get up and do something, and
people will help you. I have proven
that," Hayes said.
