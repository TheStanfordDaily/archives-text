# Careful choice
## After three years, permanent director for Res Ed will be chosen 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Although a long time in coming, the
appointment of a new director of Residen
tial Education is imminent. The search
committee charged with finding a new di
rector will interview its final candidate
today.
After considering each of the four fi

nalists, the committee will make a recom
mendation to Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds, who plans to an
nounce her decision before the end of the
quarter.
The search committee has made an ef
fort to probe the academic community for
qualified candidates. However, while the
committee received 40 applications, it
only interviewed four candidates.

Ann Porteus, who has served as inter
im director of Res Ed, is among those
being considered for the permanent posi
tion. Other candidates include Nancy
Kane, a dean at George Mason Universi
ty; Jane Camarillo, an area director at
UCLA; and Sally Walker, a research assis
tant at Harvard University.


Edmonds
Headed by University Registrar
Roger Printup, the search commit
tee also consists of students, facul
ty, resident fellows and Res Ed
administrators.
Last year, the search was sus
pended to give Res Ed a chance to
reorganize its programs in accor
dance with the recommendations
of the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education.
Although the selection process
has taken a long time, it has been
rigorous and effective, Printup
said.
"My sense is that we will not
have to search further for someone
to fill the position," Printup said.
"All the candidates we brought to
campus seemed to be strong and
competitive candidates. They all
fill our criteria to some degree."
Edmonds said she hopes to find
a candidate who will work to
implement many of the recom
mendations made in the commis
sion's report.
"I'm looking for someone who

has a real vision for residential
education and a vision for academ
ic support," Edmonds said. "The
director must be someone who is
student-focused and can interact
well with faculty."
One of the primary qualifica
tions that the committee seeks in
candidates is flexibility and adapt
ability. Printup stressed that Stan
ford has an unusual residential
environment that is noted nation
wide for its variety and complexity.
"I think all the serious candi
dates were well aware of and sup
portive of the Stanford residential
education model," Printup said.
"This does not mean that they will
run the program on autopilot, but
they will be supportive of our
unique system."
As the only undergraduate on
the committee, junior David
Williams said that he felt the can
didates were well aware of stu
dents' needs.
"The main things that we were
looking for is that they have the
ability to adapt and be aware of
Stanford culture," Williams said.
He said he felt that the tight
relationship established between
resident fellows, RAs and students

is an integral part of the Stanford
culture.
As an advocate for undergradu
ates, Williams was looking for a
candidate with a knowledge of how
to manage Row and fraternity
housing, apartments and ethnic
centers. Williams also wanted a
director who would see RAs as edu
cators and friends, not enforcers.
Committee member Karen
Seta, a graduate student, said she
believes that Res Ed must be struc
tured differently for graduate stu
dents than it is for undergradu
ates.
"There needs to be a recogni
tion that the lifestyle of a graduate
student is completely different
than that of an undergrad," Seta
said. "All the candidates have an
awareness of this difference, and
that is a good start."
Experience, good communica
tion skills and an ability to manage
a complex organization were
among the criteria that Printup
said he felt were most important.
"I think we have a strong group
of candidates," Printup said. "But
ultimately Mary Edmonds will
make the decision, since the candi
date will eventually report to her."
