# Careful choice
## After three years, permanent director for Res Ed will be chosen 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Although a long time in coming, the
appointment of a new director of Residen
tial Education is imminent. The search
committee charged with finding a new di
rector will interview its final candidate
today.
After considering each of the four fi

nalists, the committee will make a recom
mendation to Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds, who plans to an
nounce her decision before the end of the
quarter.
The search committee has made an ef
fort to probe the academic community for
qualified candidates. However, while the
committee received 40 applications, it
only interviewed four candidates.

Ann Porteus, who has served as inter
im director of Res Ed, is among those
being considered for the permanent posi
tion. Other candidates include Nancy
Kane, a dean at George Mason Universi
ty; Jane Camarillo, an area director at
UCLA; and Sally Walker, a research assis
tant at Harvard University.
