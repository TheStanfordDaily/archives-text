crew rolled onto campus to shoot

about Chang's life. Nearly a bil
lion Chinese are expected to see
the series over the summer before
it debuts on a Bay Area television
station this fall.

but also those who face adversity
in its many other forms."
Born at Stanford Hospital,

to return to Stanford to study and
to swim. He remembers taking
his first strokes soon after his first
steps, which sparked his first
dreams. He said he wanted to
swim in the 1992 Olympics and
