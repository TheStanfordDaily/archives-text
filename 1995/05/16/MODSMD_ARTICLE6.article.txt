# Disability leads to different successes

### Victor Wishna 
Like any devoted student,
Patrick Chang tries not to disturb
class — so he hopes the TV cam
eras at Stanford filming scenes of
his life story won't cause a disrup
tion.
After a diving accident at 13
paralyzed him from the chest
down and crushed his visions of
Olympic swimming glory, Chang
beat all the odds and rose even
higher. He graduated from Stan
ford at 19, and now is pursuing a
doctoral degree at just 21. Along
the way, he donated his $200,000
trust fund to create a scholarship
program in his father's hometown
in China. His story is the kind that
movies are made of — literally.
This week, a Chinese television
crew rolled onto campus to shoot

part of an eight-hour miniseries
about Chang's life. Nearly a bil
lion Chinese are expected to see
the series over the summer before
it debuts on a Bay Area television
station this fall.
"To be able to share my experi
ence with others is very impor
tant," he said. "I want it to give
people hope — not only those who
suffer from spinal cord injuries,
but also those who face adversity
in its many other forms."
Born at Stanford Hospital,
Chang said he had always wished
to return to Stanford to study and
to swim. He remembers taking
his first strokes soon after his first
steps, which sparked his first
dreams. He said he wanted to
swim in the 1992 Olympics and

come home with a gold medal.
"I figured that if I was going to
set a goal, it should be the highest
achievement," he said.
In 1987, Chang hit his head
while practicing a starting dive into
3 Vi feet of water. At first, he didn't
know the severity of the injury — it
happened on a Thursday, and he
recalled telling his dad he planned
to be ready for a meet that Satur
day. His father, however, didn't
want to give him false hopes.
"He told me the only way to let
me deal with this was for me to
know the whole truth," Chang
said. "If he had said, 'Oh, Patrick,
you'll be standing, and in a year
you'll be recovered' — that's not
realistic. The doctor told him so,
and he did research in the library
to confirm everything the doctor
had said. He knew I wouldn't get
better and that I would never
walk."
The Olympic dream was gone,
and the injury, which also left
Chang unable to move his fingers,
made tasks which required little
effort before — like getting dressed
or brushing his teeth — major
chores.
"That was depressing, and each
day it got more depressing," he
said. "You just ask yourself, 'If I
can't even do what I was able to do
before, how am I supposed to
accomplish anything?' "
Chang figured out how. At 16,
he became the second student ever
to graduate a year early from
Monta Vista High School in Cuper

tino. Three years later, at an age
when most Stanford students have
not yet picked a mqjor, he graduat
ed with distinction and became one
of the youngest students in the
economics doctoral program.
While a junior, Chang received
his $200,000 trust fund — money
his parents urged him to keep as
"a safety net." But he remem
bered his father speaking of his
hometown of Ningbo City, China,
a place where the average yearly
income lingered under $300 and
"advancing" meant leaving. Fig
uring he couldn't keep his safety
net while others were drowning,
he used the money to set up the
city's first educational scholarship
program.
"I saw education as a way to
change the situation," he said. "I
looked at my experience being dis
abled and how education has lev
eled the playing field. With educa
tion, I am no worse than any other
student — I can do what they can
do. My disability is more a physical
trait than something that defines
me.
In four years, the foundation
has awarded scholarships to more
than 2,000 students and 300
teachers while publishing materi
als to spread the message of its
mission. It was this message that
caught the attention of Tianjin
Television last summer.
Tianjin recruited a talented cast
and crew from China and the Unit
ed States, including Chang's sister
Michelle, who left the University
of Michigan's creative writing pro
gram to co-author the script. On
March 31, the crew arrived to
begin six weeks of on-location
shooting of only the third Chinese

production filmed in the U.S.
"Part of it is very entertaining,
watching our family's lives being
played out before us," Michelle
Chang said. "It's a real trip down
memory lane." But she also noted
that discussing, scripting and
watching her family's trials take
after take has been a "rather
cathartic" ordeal.
Patrick Chang agreed that it
was sometimes painful to relive
those years and to discover his par
ents' painful side of the story for
the first time.
The entire family offers support
and advice, even the shirts off their
backs — the actors portraying the
Changs are wearing the family's
real clothes. Calling himself "the
technical advisor," Chang shows
up on the set to safeguard the
accuracy of the film, making sure
"no halo" is placed above his head.
"It's a commitment," he said. "I
have not been to class for
what's this? The fourth week?
Wow."
Nevertheless, he said he is
enjoying the filming, the inter
views, the speaking events, the
visit to the Chinese Consulate gen
eral — every aspect, though he
does look forward to returning to
normal life — and his research.
Chang said his ultimate goal is
to start his own research institute
in China to study development and
create a forum for "an exchange of
minds" between China and the
U.S. — an ambitious aspiration for
most students. But for a 21-year
old with his own docudrama,
maybe not.
"It's just a research institute,"
said Chang, laughing. "It's not
that dramatic."
