# Women more accepted in emerging leadership roles, Overholser says
## Hope and barriers 
### Arnold Ceballos Staff writer 
Though women have better
prospects now for attaining leader
ship roles, they still face significant
barriers — some of which are self
imposed — a former newspaper ed
itor told the 85 people gathered last
night in Arrillaga Sports Center's
Kissick Auditorium.
Geneva Overholser, who led the
award-winning Des Moines Regis
ter, spoke as part of a talk entitled
"Women In Leadership: So Promis
ing a Prospect, So Complex a Reali
ty." The panel is the second annual
Leah Kaplan Lecture, an event
sponsored by the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender.
Pointing to the apparent cyni
cism afflicting the nation and the
feeling that "our best days are be
hind us," Overholser said that
"nothing could be farther from the
truth." She suggested that there
are untapped resources of leader
ship waiting in women and people
of color, who are "full of eagerness
and enthusiasm.
"They have barely begun to
enter the world of leadership," she
noted. "There is a real readiness to
accept new leadership and a great
deal of promise in this prospect."
Nevertheless, Overholser added
that there are at least four "com
plexities" which will complicate
this movement.
For one, women have a hard
time picturing themselves in lead
ership positions, she said. Recalling

her days as an undergraduate at
Wellesley College, Overholser said
that she was used to seeing paint
ings of eminent women on the walls
of the college, something that is not
very common in most institutions.
She illustrated the problem by
quoting former Philippine Presi
dent Corazon Aquino, who report
edly said "What do I know about
being President? I'm just a house
wife.
"We are our own worst enemies
so often. We simply don't picture
ourselves there," said Overholser.
She said that leadership posi
tions also tend to conflict with the
rest of women's lives and in the
process create difficulties for men,
families and children.
A third problem she noted is that
women have a low level of comfort
in leadership positions, particularly
in the corporate world. They conse
quently have a difficult time being
themselves. Women are uncom
fortable with hierarchy and with
showing vulnerability, she said.
The final difficulty Overholser
noted was the resistance the work
place shows to women. She noted
the negative connotations implicit
in the description of women leaders
as "volatile," "hard-driving" and
"temperamental," adjectives which
carry a different meaning when ap
plied to male bosses.
Overholser concluded on a hope
ful note by asserting that, despite
the complexities, there is a strong
responsiveness in fields that were
closed to women hi the past.
