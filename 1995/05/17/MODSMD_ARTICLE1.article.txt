## ASSU names new manager for finances 
### Jamie Taylor Editorial staff 
In a unanimous vote last night, the ASSU Senate
confirmed co-terminal student John Hall as next
year's ASSU financial manager, taking over Gabe
Lucas's post. The senate also created a new commit
tee and discussed adding a judicial branch to the
ASSU.
"I'm grateful to have a chance to give something
back to Stanford," said Hall, who was this year's
Sunday Flicks manager. "I've learned more working
for campus organizations than I realized I would."
In outlining his plans for next year, Hall said he
has "many ideas" and he especially wants the ASSU
to become more student-oriented.
"The main point I want to stress is the importance
of the ASSU to provide benefits for being a member
of the association," he said. "Every student should
gain at least an opportunity to receive a service from
the ASSU."
Hall added that some ideas he has discussed with
other ASSU members are student discounts to local
movie theaters and an ASSU-sponsored student day
at Great America. He said free screenings at Flicks
this year was one example of how to offer services to
students.
"That didn't take much effort
and the students appreciated it.
The ASSU should do stuff like
that," he said. "The ASSU should
be useful. Its main purpose is to
make life a little more cool for stu
dents."
In addition to appointing Hall,
the Senate created a Committee on
Academics, Research and Evalua
tion and discussed adding a sepa
rate judicial branch to the ASSU.
Rich Stolz, a member of the
incoming Council of Presidents,
said the idea behind creating a sep
arate committee to examine aca
demics "is to add ASSU institution
al space to talk about educational
issues" because too often faculty
discuss academics on a purely theo
retical or budgetary level. This way,
he said, students would work close
ly with faculty and initiate dialogue
in the Faculty Senate.
Stolz added that academics are
often overlooked somewhat in the
ASSU because they are included in
the senate's Committee of Student

AfTairs. The separation of the two
would help "prioritize academics
and education," he said.
The name of the committee,
however, spurred some debate,

because, accord
ing to undergrad
uate senator
Steve Russell, it
would alter the
senate's hierar
chy. Currently, if
both the senate
chair and the
deputy senate
chair are unable

to serve, power goes alphabetically
to the committee chairs. The next
in line would be the chair of the
senate's Committee on Adminis
tration and Rules.
With the addition of the Com
mittee of Academics, Research and
Evaluation, however, power would
be delegated to this committee's
chair.
"It made it so the least powerful
committee takes over," Russell
said. "It doesn't make sense. It's
not likely to occur that both the
senate chair and the deputy chair
would be gone, but it's p<x>r plan
ning anyway. The author should
have been aware of this and proba

bly was."
Russell's proposal to amend the
name was defeated and the propos
al for the committee was passed.
Undergraduate senator
Michelle Gee proposed adding a
separate Judicial Council to the
ASSU, providing the student body
with "a means to appeal senate
decisions."
Currently, the senate has the
power both to enforce and inter
pret the ASSU Constitution, "so
sometimes what happens is what
ever the senate chair says, hap
pens," Gee said.
Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi
said the ASSU should not rush to
create a judicial branch. "We
should put a committee together,
meet for a couple of weeks and
hammer out the language," he
said, adding that it would most
likely be voted on next winter quar
ter.
"This doesn't mean we're reject
ing the concepts in the bill or the
text itself," Deputy Senate Chair
Mike Choo said.
The senate also announced a
bill to change the mandatory
ASSU sweatshirts to T-shirts, to
be voted on at next Tuesday's
meeting.
