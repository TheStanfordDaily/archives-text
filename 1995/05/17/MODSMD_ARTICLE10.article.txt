## Ebola continues to threaten Zaire Doctors set up isolation wards in attempt to contain deadly virus 
### 
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) â€” With the
threat of the deadly Ebola virus loom
ing over the capital of 6 million, doc
tors and nurses created a hospital iso
lation ward yesterday for the city's
first possible carriers.
Small green rooms with floral cur
tains were sectioned off at Kinshasa's
Ngaliema Hospital to hold a total of 20
people and health workers in the isola
tion ward will have to stay there too.
"This area will be quarantined for
maximum, maximum, maximum pro
tection," said the hospital's medical
director, Dr. Maseb a Mwang Sulu.
Officials have been struggling to
contain the virus to the region sur
rounding Kikwit, a city of 600,000
where the outbreak began in March,
killing 86 people as of yesterday.
There is no vaccine or cure for
Ebola, which is spread through bodily
fluids and kills 80 percent of those
who contract it. Victims suffer from
violent diarrhea and vomiting and die
within days with blood pouring from

their eyes, ears and noses.
The fear that Kinshasa, 370 miles
west of Kikwit, was at risk became
concrete Monday with reports that a
riverboat captain and a nurse who had
fled to the capital from Kikwit were
suspected carriers.
A search for the two was launched
and they were tracked down yester
day.
The nurse worked at Kikwit Gener
al Hospital, where the epidemic began
and fled in panic to her family in Kin
shasa, said Dr. Abdou Moudi, the
World Health Organization's repre
sentative in Zaire.
The captain was treated for bloody
diarrhea at a Kinshasa hospital and
released before doctors realized his
symptoms were similar to those of
Ebola.
Late yesterday, Health Minister
Lonyangela Bopenda 80-nkuma said
the captain had amoebic dysentery, not
Ebola, and was released. He said he did
not have any test results on the nurse,

but that the case was still suspicious.
If she shows sign of Ebola, she will
be quarantined for 28 days. Doctors
will monitor her temperature for fever
and check for antibodies to the virus.
"Why are they preparing the hospi
tals here just in case, even though
they don't have any cases now?"
Bopenda 80-nkuma asked. "While in a
war, you have to prepare for the
wounded."
During Zaire's first Ebola outbreak
in 1976, Ngaliema Hospital treated
two nuns and a nurse; all three died.
President Mobutu Sese Seko posted
soldiers around the hospital then with
orders to let only doctors enter or
leave.
Yesterday, the hospital's medical
director said he was preparing isola
tion rooms for 15 to 20 people on
Ward 5, which surrounds a beautiful
ly tended garden.
"Even the doctors and nurses who
work here will not be permitted to
leave," Sulu said.
