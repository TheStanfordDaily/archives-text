TOKYO (AP) â€” Prom the neon-lit streets of the
entertainment districts to the walled-off palace
compound, Tokyo fesembled a city under siege
Wednesday, dreading revenge attacks following
the arrest of a doomsday cult leader.
Thousands of police and soldiers trained in
chemical warfare were deployed throughout 'Tokyo
after yesterday's arrest of Shoko Asahara, the
bearded guru accused of masterminding the March
20 nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subways.
In what Kyodo News Service called the largest
mobilization of security forces since the 19605,
officers and soldiers patrolled downtown streets,
subway stations and airports, searching for suspi
cious objects.
Police planned to charge Asahara, 40, with mur

der and attempted murder in the subway attack,
which killed 12 people and sickened 5,500, under
mining perhaps forever Japan's sense of safety.
"We have entered a new phase," said the top
government spokesman, Kozo Igarashi.
Hours after Asahara's arrest at the cult's
mountain stronghold, a package bomb exploded at
the Tokyo governor's office, seriously injuring an
aide.
No link was established between the cult and
the bombing, but it added to the gnawing sense of
fear felt by many Japanese.
But the fear didn't impede continuing the inves
tigation. Police were preparing Wednesday for
more cult-facility raids, seeking another 14 disci
ples.
