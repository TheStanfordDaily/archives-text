Demolition delayed?
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Fami
lies of two women whose bodies
remain entombed in the bombed-out
federal building are "extremely dis
traught" over efforts to delay the
building's demolition, a medical offi
cial said yesterday.
Bombing suspect Timothy
McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones,
filed a motion in U.S. District Court
seeking a 30-day delay of the implo
sion so defense experts can inspect the
site and take pictures and measure
ments.
U.S. Magistrate Ronald Howland
did not immediately rule. He previ
ously denied a defense motion for the
preservation of all evidence in the
case, which would have included all
the building's rubble.
Officials hope they will be able to
recover the bodies of Christy Rosas,
22, and Virginia Thompson, 56, once
the building is imploded.
After speaking with family mem
bers, Ray Blakeney, chief of opera
tions for the medical examiner's
office, said the families understood
the difficulty of removing the bodies,
but found the possibility of a delay
frustrating.
"I'd hate to see that thing sit there
another 30 days," Blakeney said of
the building.
A man who answered the phone at

the home of Rosas' parents and iden
tified himself as a relative said only
that the family is talking to the state
attorney general's office about the
demolition.
Calls to the family of Virginia
Thompson rang unanswered.
Jones said the delay is important
to his client's case.
"The government is undertaking
to destroy not just certain physical
evidence relating to the crime or cer
tain physical evidence relating to the
bomb site, but instead what is per
haps the single most important item
of evidence in this case, the ... build
ing itself," he said in court papers filed
yesterday.
Rosas and Thompson were
employees of the federal credit union
located on the third floor of the Alfred
P. Murrah Federal Building, which
was bombed April 19, killing 168 peo
ple.
The search for bodies was called off
after 16 days when officials decided
the structure was so unstable that
workers were at risk.
Matching blood samples
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A glove
found on O.J. Simpson's estate con
tained blood matching Ronald Gold
man's and appeared to have that of
Nicole Brown Simpson, a DNA
expert testified yesterday. The testi

mony was the first to place both
murder victims' DNA on Simpson's
property.
Gary Sims, a California Depart
ment of Justice scientist, also rein
forced testimony from another DNA
expert that Nicole Simpson's blood
was consistent with blood on one of
the socks at the foot of her ex-hus
band's bed.
Sims said the pair of socks was
splattered with microscopic blood
drops, bolstering the state's claim
that Simpson wore them while com
mitting the murders June 12.
A blown-up photo of the black
glove, which is the centerpiece of the
prosecution and defense cases, was
displayed on a large video screen as
Sims told jurors how it arrived at his
laboratory packaged inside-out,
exposing a fabric lining stained with
blood.
At one spot inside the glove's index
finger, he said, the blood of Goldman
and Nicole Simpson appeared to be
mixed.
"Those two combined stains could
produce the stain, G-l," Sims said in
the same flat, scientific lexicon with
which he delivered all of his findings.
Another spot, on the interior ring fin
ger, matched Goldman's blood.
Sims didn't say what percentage
of the population shared the genetic
makeup of Goldman's blood or of
the mixture. However, with this

type of sophisticated testing —
called RFLP — odds are high
against anyone else having the same
genetic makeup.
Sims' testimony about the RFLP
tests involved only one blood stain on
one sock and two spots on the glove.
So far, he excluded Simpson as a pos
sible source of the blood. However,
prosecutors have said Simpson's
blood was found on both items and
jurors have heard that his blood type
was matched to blood drops in his
foyer and driveway.
The right-handed glove was found
behind a guest house at Simpson's
estate. His lawyers have argued it was
planted there by a racist detective.
The left-handed mate was found near
the victims' slashed bodies outside
Ms. Simpson's condominium.
Prosecutors have theorized that
one glove came off Simpson's hand
during Goldman's fight for his life.
The other, they say, was dropped by
Simpson when he raced home trying
to cover his tracks after the slayings.
Defense lawyers say Simpson is an
innocent victim of overzealous detec
tives and sloppy technicians whose
combined acts set him up as a mur
derer.
In testifying about the socks, Sims
told jurors that when he examined
them under a microscope, he found
about 10 blood splatters on one and
about 19 on the other.
