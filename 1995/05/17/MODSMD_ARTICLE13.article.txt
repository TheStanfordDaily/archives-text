# Sarajevo falls under heavy shelling

### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Old
Town vendors rushed to cover and city residents
hid in bomb shelters yesterday as hundreds of
shells slammed into Sarajevo in the worst fighting
in two years.
Battles for the city's front lines claimed the
lives of the innocent, including a 12-year-old girl
unlucky enough to be outside when government
forces and besieging Serbs began battling for five
areas of Sarajevo.
Clouds of smoke wafted over the Bosnian capital
during a day in which shells began falling from the
sky at a rate of up to three a minute. An armored
vehicle manned by Russian peacekeepers was set
afire by heavy machine-gun fire; the occupants
escaped without casualties.
By nightfall, 10 hours after the shelling began,
officials reported the girl and two others dead and

17 wounded — latest victims of a conflict that has
left 200,000 people dead or missing since Bosnia
seceded from the former Yugoslav federation in
1992.
There were conflicting accounts of who started
yesterday's fighting. The United Nations said the
Bosnian army shelled a Serb-held suburb and
attacked a Serb supply road south of the city.
The mostly Muslim army said the Serbs
attacked first. And Serb sources said their fighters
were trying to take out government snipers
harassing civilians and traffic from Debelo Brdo, a
hill confrontation line south of the city center.
NATO planes flew low over Sarajevo, but the
United Nations said it would not call for air
strikes.
"What are you going to do, hit half of the city?"
asked Alexander Ivanko, a U.N. spokesman.
