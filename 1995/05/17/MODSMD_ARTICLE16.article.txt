## Editorial Ticket Office scam 
### 
Plan to charge student
groups for selling their
tickets is wrongheaded

IT'S ONE OF the basic tenets of
economics: Monopolies tend to
be inefficient and expensive
and have very little vested interest
in improving customer service or
decreasing costs. There's no rea
son why Stanford should ignore
the wisdom of its own courses in
the case of the Stanford Ticket
Office in Tresidder.
Last week Assoc. Dir. of Stan
ford Events Larry Davidson
announced a policy that tickets for
all events held next year at Memo
rial Auditorium, Dinkelspiel Audi
torium, Memorial Church and
Frost Amphitheater must be pur
chased through the Ticket Office.
All student events that sell tickets
or give free tickets away would be
covered under this policy. Groups
which did not provide a purchase
order for the Ticket Office would
not be approved to use Mem Aud
or any of the other venues. It
would be a marked change from
the current system, which allows
student groups to sell tickets for
their own programs in White Plaza
or at the door.
The extra cost of distributing
tickets through the Ticket Office
could range from 25 cents to $1.05
per ticket. If such a policy is
allowed to be enforced, the sur
charge could total between $1,500
and $10,710 per year for groups
like the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
which is a major user of Memorial
Auditorium according to its direc
tor, Scott Moss. ASSU Sunday
Flicks would face similar charges,
as would any other student group
which tried to put on an event.
If students allow the policy to
take effect, someone will have to
cover these extra costs. One option
would be to increase the charge on
each ticket, passing the costs of
supporting the Ticket Office
directly to students. This is obvi

ously not in the student interest,
so directors of Stanford Events,
who oversee the Ticket Office,
espouse a much more misleading
policy.
Stanford Events wants to sell
tickets to students at face value
and bill the student groups for
each ticket sold. Such a policy
allows the Ticket Office to claim to
be concerned with keeping prices
for student tickets at a minimum.
They conveniently ignore the fact
that siphoning $6,000 from Speak
ers Bureau tickets means $6,000
less that the Bureau has to bring
high-quality speakers to campus.
Furthermore, the $6,000 comes
directly from special fees that stu
dents have paid to run programs,
not to pad inefficient University
bureaucracy.
Of course, no student group
believes that the Ticket Office
should provide its services for free.
If groups need its services and are
willing to pay the surcharges on
each ticket, the option should be
there for them. In some cases it
might be true that the groups will
benefit from higher ticket sales if
they use the Ticket Office rather
than schedule their own sale
times.
But Flicks, Speakers Bureau
and all the other groups that use
University space should be able to
make their own decisions on
whether the Ticket Office's ser
vices are worthwhile. If the Ticket
Office really wants the business, it
could do a lot more to increase ser
vice and bring down costs, helping
student groups put on cost-effec
tive events.
Forcing student groups from
Flicks to Fleet Street to buy ser
vices from the Ticket Office smacks
of monopolistic power-grabbing
and an intention to demand money
from students for an unnecessary
and expensive service. The word
"extortion" comes to mind. At a
university that attempts to teach
students how to work together and
find common ground, the Stanford
Ticket Office is an embarrassing
example of blind greed.
