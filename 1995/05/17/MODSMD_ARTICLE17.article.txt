Professor Van den Dool made her class feel like home

IN A WORLD like Stanford's we get
accustomed to living in a bubble. We
study the problems that exist global
ly, but you must admit that ours is a
privileged lifestyle. We wake up every
morning, taking for granted that...
well taking for granted a number of
things and I won't bore you by getting
into them, but the most common one is
the waking up in the morning. We just
assume that we will be here tomorrow,
and we even have our calendars booked
for the next two months, most of us
quite certain we'll still be able to carry
these tasks out. But according to the
course of life we all have to face the
same end, whether at Stanford or any
where else in the world, and death comes
when it pleases, never asking permis
sion, often not even giving warning
signs.
That's the way it came happened with
Profesora Karin Van den Dool of the
Spanish and Portuguese Department.
She was with us in class on Friday, May
5 and then on Monday she was absent
without prior notice, not like the Profe
sora at all. I assumed she had caught
one of the nasty viruses going around. I,
myself, had been bed-ridden towards the
end of the week because of one. Walking
over to class on Tuesday afternoon, I
thought of how it had been nearly a
week since I'd seen her. Minha filha
prodiga, (my prodigal daughter) she had
called me when I told her I wanted to
take the class as a review to her second
year sequence which I was planning on
taking next year. I had taken the first
year sequence with her already my
freshmen year, but hadn't stuck with
the language during my second year.

Spending six months in South America
made me want to come back to Por
tuguese with a renewed interest. And
what's more, I knew what an excellent
teacher Van den Dool was. So yes, as the
biblical story goes, I had gone off to see
the world, and had returned, and it did
feel as if I was returning home.
Karin had a wonderful way of making
her class feel like home. Because when
you were in her class, you weren't a stu
dent in Portuguese first or second year,
or one of her other many classes (I think
she taught four of five depending the
quarter), you were one of Karin's stu
dents and you felt it. The classes weren't
very large so she got to know each one of
us individually; where you were from,
what you enjoyed doing, where you were
going with your ambitions in life. She lis
tened like a mother, and she stimulated
conversation like a perfect hostess. I was
amazed how she'd always break those lit
tle silences in the most natural way, pro
voking interesting dialogue. We talked
about life, about Brazilian politics (did
that ever provide for conversation), world
politics and, of course, Stanford politics.
We even got to discuss the senior proces
sion.
Profesora Van den Dool was very alive
and vibrant... the kind of person you'd
like to be when you get older or for that
matter even today. She was open-mind
ed, happy, and had a great sense of
humor. I think we will all remember that
crisp laugh of hers when she found our
stories amusing or when she was telling
her own, because she was a great story
teller and she had so much to tell. Stories
of her first impressions of the U.S. (like
the novelty and initial horror of having a

female hairdresser), of her children, of
her returning trips to Brazil, of the cul
ture clashes and of life in general.
She was always learning about new
happenings, being helpful in whatever
way she could, never pompous, never
condescending (even when you didn't
understand the more-than-perfect
preterit tense). Did you need help after
class, no problem. Interested in studying
abroad in Brazil, she was there with
information to point you in the right
direction. My very last memory of Karin
was last Tuesday afternoon, going over
my Portuguese composition. I had really
made a mess of the preterit tenses and
we spent a whole hour together until it
was all cleared up. And during the last
minute we spent together, she was just
as patient as she had been during the
first.
She was also understanding. Whether
you were late to class, sick, on a selection
committee interviewing, or flying off for
interviews, she never became angry or
annoyed. All of your work was still
expected to be turned in, but she always
asked how your experience had been, or
how you were recovering. It was like
coming home. It was a "relax, have a
seat, tell me about it" atmosphere, where
you were cared about as a person.
And her little details said she cared.
The annual barbecues at her house; hav
ing Meyer Media Center record 6:30 a.m.
airings of Portuguese news for us; e
mailing us about Brazilian events in the
local area or major news events occurring
in Brazil itself; shifting assignments
around if too many happened to fall dur
ing midterms week; and she did it all in a
willing way.

Oddly enough, I found out some time
last year that she wasn't a professor, she
was what is referred to as a senior lectur
er, but in our eyes she was Profesora Van
den Dool, and in my eyes, she wasn't a
member of the Department of Spanish
and Portuguese, she was the Portuguese
Department itself. She taught first-year
Portuguese, first-year accelerated, second
year, Portuguese for Spanish speakers
and reading Portuguese. To my knowl
edge, the only Portuguese classes she
didn't teach were the conversation ones.
Just last week we were talking to her
about publishing a Portuguese text book,
because the supplement she had devel
oped for the course is more helpful than
the text book. She laughed about it say
ing that it was easier to criticize a text
book than to write one, and that if she
wrote one, there would be other Por
tuguese classes across the U.S. that
would not be crazy about it.
She was an incredible lady who taught
so many of us so much about Portuguese
and about life. Her absence will leave a
void, but she leaves with us a greater
knowledge of a beautiful language, and
the memories of her humanitarianism. I
wish I had told her how much I admired
her. Now I can just hope she somehow
sensed it.
I can't help but realize the proximity
of her death to Mother's Day, especially
when considering the kind of person she
was. Happy Mother's Day Profesora Van
den Dool, and thank you for having made
Stanford a little more like home for so
many of us.

you were cared about as a person.
And her little details said she cared.
The annual barbecues at her house; hav
ing Meyer Media Center record 6:30 a.m.
airings of Portuguese news for us; e
mailing us about Brazilian events in the
local area or major news events occurring
in Brazil itself; shifting assignments
around if too many happened to fall dur
ing midterms week; and she did it all in a
willing way.

Oddly enough, I found out some time
last year that she wasn't a professor, she
was what is referred to as a senior lectur
er, but in our eyes she was Profesora Van
den Dool, and in my eyes, she wasn't a
member of the Department of Spanish
and Portuguese, she was the Portuguese
Department itself. She taught first-year
Portuguese, first-year accelerated, second
year, Portuguese for Spanish speakers
and reading Portuguese. To my knowl
edge, the only Portuguese classes she
didn't teach were the conversation ones.
Just last week we were talking to her
about publishing a Portuguese text book,
because the supplement she had devel
oped for the course is more helpful than
the text book. She laughed about it say
ing that it was easier to criticize a text
book than to write one, and that if she
wrote one, there would be other Por
tuguese classes across the U.S. that
would not be crazy about it.
She was an incredible lady who taught
so many of us so much about Portuguese
and about life. Her absence will leave a
void, but she leaves with us a greater
knowledge of a beautiful language, and
the memories of her humanitarianism. I
wish I had told her how much I admired
her. Now I can just hope she somehow
sensed it.
I can't help but realize the proximity
of her death to Mother's Day, especially
when considering the kind of person she
was. Happy Mother's Day Profesora Van
den Dool, and thank you for having made
Stanford a little more like home for so
many of us.
