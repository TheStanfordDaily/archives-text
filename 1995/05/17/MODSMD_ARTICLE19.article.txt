## Walking down memory lane 
### 
LAST WEEKEND I attended my
freshman dorm reunion. This is
one of the rituals which graduating
seniors go through in their last quarter
at Stanford. It was supposed to be a
great afternoon of music, food, beer and
volleyball but, of course, it still seems to
be winter in California. So we had to set
tle for a dorm dining hall.
Most of the afternoon was spent in
reminiscing about old times. The scav
enger hunt, the football games and the
many nights of drunkenness and
debauchery were all frequent topics of
conversation. There was even a slide
show to remind us of our year of inno
cence and carelessness.
A little less frequent, but much more
painful, was the inevitable moment
when there was a lull in the conversa
tion, and somebody felt compelled to ask,
"So, what are you doing next year?" A
few people had great answers: They're
going to Harvard, they're working for
Microsoft, they've got a Fulbright. Even
the former dorm clown who became
famous across campus for his frequent
displays of nudity will be wearing a suit
and tie at a major consulting firm next
year. But the majority of us responded
with one of two answers: "I'm still look
ing at my options" or, more truthfully,
and with a shrug of the shoulders, "I
don't know."
These types of conversations at the
reunion brought out just how much

Stanford has changed all of us since we
came here almost four years ago. Back
then, most of us had great dreams of
what we were going to do with our lives,
and we were sure that Stanford would
help us realize those goals. From the
first evening I was in my freshman
dorm, I was already talking to fascinat
ing people from around the country,
many of whom had very ambitious
dreams about their futures.
Luckily for us, talking about our
futures was all we needed to do during
our freshman year. Graduation was still
a long time away, and our most pressing
concerns of the moment were our "diffi
cult" CIV papers. Freshman year was
spent in a haze of parties, new social and
academic challenges and long philosoph
ical debates about abstract subjects. We
were almost completely removed from
the real world.
And that experience was great. That
is what we needed during our first year
away from home. Stanford and Residen
tial Education made sure that we would
be happily occupied with our new friends
and living arrangements. We were kept
so busy that we barely had time to think
about the manj/ real pressures which
were looming in the future.
I've always thought that my fresh
man year was my best year at Stanford,
and I think it's supposed to be. Sure, I
studied and traveled in Europe for most
of my junior year, but that experience
did not contribute to my personal

growth as much as my first year on cam
pus. I really believe that a lot of who I am
as a person today is a direct result of my
freshman year.
I've heard several seniors ask what
Stanford has really done for their
futures. They don't have jobs yet, and
they think that they've thrown $100,000
down the drain because they're still
unemployed. I'd like to pose a question
to them: Did you really think that the
only purpose of a Stanford education
was to hand you the perfect job when
you graduated? When I came here, my
idea of the perfect job was to be a diplo
mat. Yet I realized by my junior year
that I didn't want to move to a different
country every two years and be forced to
promote U.S. foreign policy, when I
often didn't agree with it. I credit my
years at Stanford for helping me to
rethink those goals.
So my advice to those disillusioned
seniors is to take a walk down memory
lane like I did this weekend. Of course,
Stanford is far from paradise. But, even
if you're still clueless, as I am, about
your futures, you may be pleasantly sur
prised at the changes it's brought to
your lives.

Amanda would like to wish all of her fel
low Brannerites good luck in the real
world. Boanthropy forever!
