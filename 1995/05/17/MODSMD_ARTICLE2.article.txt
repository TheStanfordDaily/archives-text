# Political poles
## Panel tackles issues of race, multiculturalism, economics 
### Alda Leu Contributing writer 
The increasingly political nature of social and eco
nomic issues came under heated debate in a panel dis
cussion last night in the Donner lounge.
More than 50 students and seven panelists were
present at the discussion titled, "Who's Being 'Polit
ical' Here?"
Mediated by Gerald Graff, an English professor at
the University of Chicago, the panel included a polit
ically and racially diverse group of speakers — Politi
cal Science Prof. Luis Fraga; Hoover Institution Se
nior Research Fellow Larry Diamond; former and
current Stanford Review editors Adam Ross and
Michael Meyer, and Stanford graduate Kwame Anku
and senior Taj James, both from Institute No Hu
mans Involved, a student group that aims to promote
new ways of thinking about race and politics.
The panel began by examining the meaning of the
word "political," especially with respect to controver
sial issues. Each panelist gave an opening statement
concerning his own definition of the word.
James emphasized that "the political nature of
truths is contextual" and warned of blindly accepting
"indisputable truths."
Diamond's interpretation of politics centered on
its innate struggle for power. "At its root, what is po
litical is about power ... power is not only about
power and government — it's about domination."
Conversely, Ross focused his opening on the "mis
placed priorities" of the University administration in
creating a Chicano Studies program at the expense of
students in humanities courses who will face larger
section sizes.
Ross' criticism of the program spurred much panel
and audience response, mostly in
favor of Chicano Studies.
Fraga, a member of the com
mittee designing the Chicano
Studies curriculum, disputed
Ross' contention that the pro
posed ethnic studies major would
cut into other needed funds. Larg
er section sizes and the new pro
gram are "two completely sepa
rate budgetary issues," he said.
"To juxtapose them makes abso
lutely no analytical sense to me."

He added that allocations for the
Chicano Studies program have
not yet been made.
The discussion then pro
gressed into a struggle to restruc
ture the economic value system of
Western culture. Several audience
members complained about a self
centered Western mentality.
Anku illustrated the point with a
current proposal in the U.S. Sen
ate to completely cut aid to Africa
because it would not benefit the
United States.
Diamond said that aid to Africa
previously has served to help the
United States prevent Russia
from influencing the countries,

but now that Russia is no longer a
threat, some may see the foreign
aid as a "waste of money."
Ross defended the U.S. econom
ic system, saying that "following
this model, America is the most
prosperous nation in the world."
Diamond then asked the ques
tions, "Is wealth the only goal of
our society?" and "Do we want to
live with ourselves as people if we
write off a segment of our popula
tion?"
In closing, he said that in polit
ical dialogue, the right sometimes
fails to show empathy while the
left sometimes fails at rational
understanding.
