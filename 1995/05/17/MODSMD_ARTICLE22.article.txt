# 'Coming to terms with the past'
## Holocaust survivor advocates studying Nazi mentality 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Understanding the Nazis' mentality is the key
to preventing a repetition of the Holocaust, said
Holocaust survivor John Steiner in a speech to a
psychology class yesterday.
"Trying to understand is my way of coming to
terms with the past. How is it possible somebody
can behave like that? How can they get a kick out
of sadistic acts?" Steiner asked the 90 students in
Psychology 199: "The Psychology of Mind Con
trol," taught by Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo.
Steiner, a history professor at Sonoma State
University, said that studying the Nazis' mentality
during the Holocaust has helped him come to
terms with his past.
Put into a camp at 17, Steiner said he faced the
deaths of his best friend, mother and most of his
extended family.
"The one thing I still have not learned to come
to terms with is the loss of those that were close to
me," Steiner said. "I wasn't ready for the umbilical
cord to be cut."
To deal with his past and teach others how to
prevent a similar event, Steiner has spent the past
34 years interviewing Nazi perpetrators.
While conducting approximately 1,500 inter
views, Steiner said he has faced some strange situ
ations; for example, some of Hitler's officers treat
ed him as their "closest friend."
"I got VIP treatment," Steiner said.
One of Hitler's highest-ranking officers made
Steiner an honorary army captain. Steiner said he

accepted the promotion to learn more about the
perpetrators' motivations, though most Nazi lead
ers denied knowing about the concentration camps.
Steiner learned, though, that the Nazis didn't
feel guilty since they had merely carried out orders.
Hitler's officers for the most part died without any
feelings of guilt, Steiner said.
To the Nazis, "the Jews were not human any
more," he said. Without food, soap or water, the
Jews looked emaciated and dirty, which allowed
the Nazis to consider them "non-humans," Steiner
added.
"When [someonel is reduced to a skin-covered
skeleton, you have taken away his humanity," he
said. "It is easier to kill non-humans than humans.
"Perpetrators viewed themselves as racial
cleansers," Steiner added.
The Germans also justified the mass killing of
Jews by believing that since the Jews were in a
camp, they must have done something wrong,
Steiner said. German parents told misbehaving
children that if they didn't obey orders, they would
be sept to a concentration camp.
Steiner emphasized that since the Holocaust
took the world by surprise, a similar event could
happen soon, citing Rwanda as an example. "Your
skills of remaining humane will be tested in the
near future," he predicted. "I hope I'm wrong."
"Could it happen to you?" Steiner asked. "It hap
pened to me to be sure, though I never in my wildest
nightmares imagined that this could happen.
"Is the survivors' message getting through?" he
added. "We need to relate our experiences to stop
the killing."
