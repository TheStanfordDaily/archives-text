Q:How does Silly-Putty work?
â€” anonymous
A:Silly Putty. The wonder-toy. Although it
seems like old news now that we're all
grown up, when we were kids it was the
greatest thing since Frosted Flakes. How many
hours did you spend bouncing it all over the place,
trying to "lift off' dirty words from the newspaper
or just sticking it onto everything you could find?
Our favorite was making artificial noses, ears,
and other body parts. ("I'm crazy Silly Putty face.
I've got Silly Putty for my damn epidermis, and it
makes me crazy!") It was conveniently flesh col
ored, after all.
Of course, it inevitably ended up going through
the wash and you had to wait until your parents
forgot what a pain it was. Finally they buy you a

new one, starting the tortuous endless cycle all
over again. Those were the days!
And now you're grown up and you want to
know how it works. Weil. I can't tell you why we
thought it was so fun . . . probably no one knows
that. But I can tell you a little of the physics
behind Silly Putty.
Silly Putty consists of long hydrocarbon
molecules, suspended in a lubricant which holds it
together and makes it workable. It was invented
by a chemical company back in the 19405, but no
one could find a practical use for it, so it became a
toy.
You may have noticed that Silly Putty seems to
be somewhere between a liquid and a solid. If you
let it sit somewhere, it slowly oozes until it tills
it's container. Yet, when you hold it in your hand,
it seems solid, and you can even bounce it. You
can stretch it out, but if you stretch too quickly, it
breaks.
This property is known as viscoelasticity and it
is common in materials made up of polymers, or
long chain-like molecules. For example, mucous
behaves similary, although it's a lot more on the
liquid side than solid side. If you're swishing it
around your mouth, it seems like a liquid; howev
er, if you work it fast enough, you can get a pret
ty solid loogie going. This is because mucous, in
all its forms from loogies to snots, consists pri
marily of long sugar molecules, which behave like
the long hydrocarbons in Silly Putty.
For a long time, it was a mystery how vis
coelasticity arose in polymers. Nowadays the lead
ing theory is known as the "reptation" model,
from the Latin reptare, "to creep." (As in reptile.)
This model assumes that a polymer material is
much like a bowl of spaghetti, with the spaghetti
strands representing the long polymer molecules.
Now, if you pull on one strand of spaghetti, it
can move back and forth freely along its length;
you can just slurp it out. But it can't move side-to
side, because it's trapped in by the strands around
it.
Now imagine your Silly Putty is like this bowl
of spaghetti. You apply a strong, quick force to it,
like bouncing it against the wall. Each of the little
polymer strands is stuck, because it's being held
in place by it's neighbors. Thus, it behaves like a
solid.
But now you leave it in your pocket for a while.
Over time, each of the little strands will drift back
and forth along its length. Eventually, they will
drift enough to free the molecules that were held
back, and the putty will ooze. So, over a long time,
it behaves like a liquid.
I wasn't able to find out for certain how the
Silly Putty has its amazing ability to "lift off'
comics and other newsprint. Most likely, it's
because the ink comes off so easily (you know how
you get black fingertips after reading the paper)
that anything sticky will lift it off. In fact, a piece
of Scotch tape does a mediocre job of lifting off
newsprint. The advantage Silly Putty has is that
it sticks to the ink, but not the paper.
So, I hope you'll never look at Silly Putty or
spaghetti the same way again. Or at least, I hope
you don't get them confused.
