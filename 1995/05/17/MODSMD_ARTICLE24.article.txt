# Stay away from those sleepy truckers!
## Dement, Stoohs warn that almost 80% of truckers suffer from sleep apnea

According to researchers at the Stan
ford Medical School Sleep Research
Center, obstructive sleep apnea is a seri
ous problem in commercial truck
drivers.
These findings appear in the May
issue of the journal Chest and have
received coverage in newspapers such
as the New York Times.
Sleep apnea is a disorder which caus
es people to momentarily stop breath
ing during sleep and then briefly awak
en hundreds of times a night, causing
severe fatigue and impaired activities
during waking hours.
In the study of long-haul truck
drivers, Stanford scientists Dr. Riccar
do Stoohs, the primary author, and Dr.
William Dement found that the occur
rence of sleep apnea was at least three
times higher in truckers than in the
general U.S. population. Of the drivers
studied, 78 percent had the disorder.
The researchers were surprised at
the high prevalence of sleep apnea in
their findings. Dement identified his
concerns regarding road safety, "When
78 percent of the people coming toward
you on the road in 40-ton trucks have
such a disorder, you have a problem,"
he said.

drug- and alcohol-induced impairment
as the leading cause of heavy truck acci
dents in the United States. Previous
studies have shown that people with
sleep apnea had up to seven times more
automotive accidents than people with
out the condition. According to Dement,
the results of his research suggests that
commercial truck drivers should get
tested and treated for the disorder.
Sleep apnea most often strikes mid
dle-aged men who are heavy snorers
and overweight, although it can occur
in both men and women of all ages and
body builds. The disorder can also occur
in children. In general, obese males are
the stereotypical apnea patient. Excep
tions to this rule are people who suffer
from congenital malformations of the
upper airway, tumors in the related
area and similar conditions. In children,
tremendous tonsils and adenoids may
predispose a child who is not necessari
ly obese.
Obesity is the key risk factor for
sleep apnea, particularly "apple
shaped" obesity — a round belly and
upper body with little fat in the extrem
ities. Many leading physicians have
dubbed this condition "male pregnan
cy." Obese males are more likely to pos
sess this figure than obese females, who
are more susceptible to "pear-shaped"
obesity. This difference in how men and
women store fat is the reason for the

disorder's sexual differentiation.
The stereotypical apneac develops
fat in the neck. The fat is circumferen
tial, narrowing the pharyngeal space
and causing congestion, edema and
other disturbance of the various soft tis
sues of the upper airway: the pharynx,
uvula, tonsillar areas, soft palate, buc
cal cavity, etc. In addition, this creates
excess mass which the muscles of the
upper airway must now support in
order to keep the airway open.

relaxed during sleep. (Genertd muscle
relaxation during sleep is natural and
not specific to apneacs.) This interrupts
breathing and decreases the amount of
oxygen reaching the bloodstream.
As the partial pressure of oxygen in
the blood decreases and the partial pres
sure of carbon dioxide in the blood
increases, the body responds by increas
ing breath rate. With the increased
breath rate, the pressure within the
thoracic cavity is increased (made more
negative). This increased pressure
results in even more stress on the soft
tissues of the upper airway. Oxygen lev
els continue to fall, as very forceful
inspirations, intended to compensate

for the decreased oxygen, cause a col
lapse of the phaiyngeal structures and
soft structures in general. Flow of air is
now completely cut off.
It should be noted that these mus
cles and other soft tissue of the upper
airway only temporarily collapse and
block the air passage; a permanent col
lapse would result in death.
As blood oxygen levels reach strik
ingly low and critical levels, the body
arouses as a self-defense mechanism.
These arousals are so brief that in the
morning the person will have no recol-

lection of having awakened perhaps as
many as 50 times an hour during sleep
— 350 awakenings in a seven-hour
sleep period.
Although the sleep interruptions are
not consciously noticed, they can drasti
cally reduce the quality of rest. "If
someone wakes up every two or three
minutes during the night, it's as if they
had very little sleep or no sleep at all,"
Dement said.
Stoohs and Dement note that fur
ther studies will be necessary before
they can determine the causes for the
increased prevalence of sleep apnea in
truck drivers. Likely risk factors
include obesity and a lifestyle of irreg

ular sleep schedules. Given the impor
tant safety implications for profes
sions where alertness is crucial,
Stoohs said he hopes in future studies
to examine whether high percentages
of airline pilots, train engineers or
power plant workers also suffer from
sleep apnea.
There are various surgical proce
dures — UPPP and tracheostomy —
which open up the airway. Also, a device
may be attached to the mouth during
sleep which blows air into the airway,
reducing the chance of collapse. This

technique is called CPAP, for constant
positive airway pressure. However,
such treatments are not always effec
tive. In addition, one may view the
treatments as avoiding the true prob
lem by allowing the patient to return,
with reduced problems, to the haz
ardous activities which caused the
apnea in the first place: obesity and
poor general health.
Treatment should follow a holistic
approach and be aimed at correcting
obesity, such as Dr. Dement's own "Tri
umvirate of Health" — proper sleep,
exercise and diet. Weight loss is a sure
fire treatment for the vast majority of
sleep apnea cases.
