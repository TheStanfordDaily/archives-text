# Researchers at Med School discover the importance of protein Ku
## Cellular activity is crucial for immune system 
### Nancy Farghalli Contributing writer 
Building on an observation made
15 years ago, researchers at Stanford
Medical Center have discovered sev
eral functions of the protein known to
be involved in autoimmune diseases.
Protein Ku, a DNA binding pro
tein, was first identified in a Japanese
patient suffering from a disease
known as polymyositis scleroderma
syndrome, part of a class of autoim
mune diseases. According to Dr.
Gilbert Chu, an associate professor in
the Oncology Department, an

autoimmune disease is "when
patients produce antibodies against
their own proteins." People suffering
from these types of diseases have
immune systems that produce anti
bodies which attack protein Ku.

Diseases such as systematic lupus
which attacks tissues in the body,
Graves Disease, which is a disorder
involving the thyroid gland, and
polymyositis, a disorder that causes
general muscle inflation, are all iden
tified to be of an autoimmune nature.
In the past, treatment against these
diseases has included steroid injec
tions but Chu admitted that "steroid
treatment has a lot of side effects."
As a side note, he also mentioned
that women have a predisposition to
these autoimmune diseases.

nomenon.
Although Ku has been classified as
a protein for a long time, its cellular
functions have remained almost an
enigma to scientists. The work of
Chu's lab, however, has help shed

light on the cellular responsibilities of
Ku.
Ironically, the mystery was solved
in an indirect way. While researching
the repair of DNA damage produced
by ultraviolet rays, Kimryn Rathmall,
a medical student working under Chu,
discovered a link between DNA dou
ble-strand repair and protein Ku.
However, she stuck her observation in
her notebook and did not do anything
about it until three years later when
other medical research stimulated her
to check on her past observation.
Researchers found that Ku helps
cells repair DNA damage caused by
X-rays which induce double strand
breaks in DNA. In order to live, cells
must have a mechanism to repair
damaged DNA (Double-strand breaks
in DNA — the result of any of the
physical extremes of everyday life —
are a common occurrence as far as
human DNA is concerned). In addi
tion to helping to repair damaged
DNA, it has been shown that Ku is
integral to V(D)J recombination.
V(D)J recombination is essential in
helping the immune system build
immunoglobulin or T cell receptor
genes. Interestingly, V(D)J recombi
nation involves the repair of a DNA
double-strand break.
In this process, cleaved DNA pieces
are brought together and the recom
bination of two coding areas signals
the formation of immune cells that
help the body fight off infections. "We
are not quite sure how Ku is involved
in V(D)J recombination but we know
it is involved," Chu said.
Having the ability to produce T cell
receptors and immunoglobulins is an
important part of protecting oneself
from infections. The idea that protein
Ku involves itself with DNA double
strand repair has led to the notion
that double-strand breaks and V(D)J
recombination share a similar path
way.
Using a mouse model, specifically
the SCID (severe combined immun
odeficiency) mouse, researchers were
able to see if double-strand breaks
and V(D)J recombination utilized

protein Ku. The SCID mice suffer
from an absence of working Band T
cells — making them vulnerable to
infections. Also, SCID mice are
severely sensitive to x-rays and are
not effective in repairing DNA dou
ble-strand breaks.
Cell lines from these mice- were
studied. Through an examination of
these mutant cell lines, it was shown
that three gene products are involved
in both V(D)J recombination and
double-strand break repair. One of
these biosynthetic pathways includes
protein Ku. This specific protein res
cues cells as well as promoting DNA
binding activity, X-ray resistance and
V(D)J recombination. Chu stated
that "The discovery that Ku saves X
ray vulnerable cells suggests that the
binding of Ku to DNA may activate
pathways that regulate the cellular
response to DNA damage."
In terms of further research, Chu
is confident that "knowing the bio
chemistry and the genetics behind X
rays will lead to more effective [clini
cal] procedures." Not only will this
knowledge lead to a better under
standing of X-rays, it may lead to a
better understanding of how to treat
cancer.
By knowing how cells handle X
rays, researchers could figure out
how to kill the tumor cells effectively
without causing significant damage
to non-cancerous cells through pro
longed ineffective X-ray treatment,
Chu pointed out.
In the past, serum from patients
has been responsible for unlocking
the basic understanding of DNA
repair. Chu is hopeful that one day a
comprehension of DNA repair and
V(D)J recombination will lead to
helping patients. He pointed out that
right now "we are not exactly work
ing on translating bench research
into clinical methods."
Yet with the discovery of the cellu
lar importance of protein Ku in dou
ble-strand repair and V(D)J path
ways, scientists are well on the way to
unlocking the hidden mystery of cel
lular cycles in the human body.
