Some people throw surprise parties to cel
ebrate a birthday, some send sappy Hallmark
cards. Others decide to write a 400-page
book.
Slavic Studies graduate students Andrey
Ustinov and Irina Shevelenko edited a vol
ume of articles written by a variety of Slavic
scholars for Slavic Studies Prof. Lazar Fleish
man's 50th birthday. The entire project was
done in secret.
Shevelenko said both she and Ustinov
thought of it as they were trying to decide
what to do for Fleishman's birthday.
"We wanted to give him some substantial
present. We thought, a book. He's a biblio
phile, which makes it a good gift, but it's hard
to find a book he hasn't read, so we decided to
put one together," Ustinov said.
The book consists of articles written in
both Russian and English by authors who
reside in such diverse areas of the globe as
Russia, the United States, England and
Latvia. Ustinov and Shevelenko said it was
significant because it allowed them to bring
together international minds in one volume.

Slavic Studies Department Chair Gregory
Freidin said he considers it "one of the most
interesting volumes published this year" in
Russian literary circles.
Freidin praised the students' efforts, say
ing the book is an impressive compilation of a
variety of writers and essayists. "It is a won
derful volume. The quality of the articles
make it one of the best we've had. It's sort of
like a who's who in the history of modern
Russian scholarship. The series itself is taken
veiy seriously in the field of Russian literary
studies and reviewed all over Russia," he
explained.
"It is very rare for young scholars to exhib
it that level of maturity and skill. To put
together a volume like that in your spare time
is difficult even for a professor," Freidin added.
Ustinov said to keep their work a secret he
and Shevelenko had to conduct their
research in the department carefully.
"Through responses to our indirect ques
tions, we put together a list of names. Origi
nally, we thought we would limit the volume
to include only the works of young scholars,
but in the end, there were some who were
older than Fleishman — his mentors."

After sending out almost three dozen invi
tations to Slavic Studies scholars throughout
the world, Ustinov said everyone asked was
willing to submit work to the volume, includ
ing three members of the Russian Academy
of Sciences and Slavic Studies Prof. Emeritus
Joseph Frank, who, according to Ustinov, is
very famous in American circles.
"It was a labor of love. I put my health, my
soul into it. We didn't get paid for it." Ustinov
said, adding that none of the contributing
scholars received honoraria and the publish
er also did it as a favor.
"We called him up, asked if he would feel
comfortable working with us in this way and
he was," Shevelenko said. "But usually, the
publisher types it. Neither Andrey nor myself
is a professional typist and we had to type the
whole thing." This proved difficult, she said,
especially with the articles written with
Cyrillic fonts.
Usually, a tribute like this one comes
when a scholar is about to retire. To receive
one while so young is a great compliment to
Fleishman, Shevelenko added.
Freidin said although Fleishman is
rather young, his accomplishments in the

study of Slavic literature place him among
the most distinguished scholars in the
world. "Fleishman is one of the best names
in the field," he said. "He is internationally
known as one of a half-dozen specialists in
the history of 20th Century Russian poetry,
especially Pasternak."
The work provided the students with good
professional experience, Ustinov said, but the
reception was initially less than he had
hoped. "I expected it to have more of an
impact immediately. But now people are
starting to review it, so that satisfies me."
The volume was published last May
through the Slavic Studies Department, and
the Russian section of the British Broadcast
ing Company's World Service featured it last
spring in a program called "The Book Shelf."
"We thought it would be a pity if we didn't
offer it to be published through the non-peri
odical Slavic Studies Series, which is usually
done by faculty." Ustinov said.
"He was always the head of publishing
this type of book," Shevelenko said of Fleish
man. "This was the thing that he could never
think of — that someone else could take it
over."
