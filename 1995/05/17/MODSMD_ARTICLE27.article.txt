## Dreams of perfect season come true for Stanford men in Athens 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Dream became reality yesterday
for the Stanford Cardinal men's tennis team.
A 4-0 victory over the Mississippi Rebels in the
final round of the NCAA championships held in the
mecca of college tennis, Athens, was the perfect fin
ishing touch to an undefeated dream season. The
Cardinal ended the 1995 campaign with a 27-0
record, only the second time in history that a Stan
ford men's tennis team has gone undefeated.
"We've only had two undefeated teams at Stan
ford in my tenure there. These guys earned the title
of being one of the two best teams at Stanford since
World War II," said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould.
The other team Gould referred to was the 1978
squad that featured four future top 100 players in
the world, including John McEnroe.
That this year's squad of Jeff Salzenstein, Scott

Humphries, Paul Goldstein, Jim Thomas, Grant
Elliott and Ricky Becker — their names are worth
remembering — ever made it to this high point is
remarkable in light of where it stood after last year's
final-round heartbreaking 4-3 defeat at the hands of
use.
"At the start of the year we had no seniors. We
had four freshmen coming in and from the get-go
you don't know how the team is going to gel," said
junior captain Salzenstein.
The 1995 Cardinal was certainly not lacking in
the talent department. It was the intangibles that
were the question mark at the beginning of the year.
Ask no more.
"Not only are they talented but they are poised
and are great competitors" explained Mississippi
head coach Billy Chadwick. "There are really no
weaknesses. They beat one of the best teams in the
country, if not the best team, Georgia, at National
