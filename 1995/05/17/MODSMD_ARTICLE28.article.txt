# Just got to keep on keeping on
## In life, like in sports, we're always crossing some sort of finish line 
### 
My parents keep referring
to these last weeks of my
Stanford career as the
"final stretch."
"Don't blow it now," they warn
me. "Remember to finish strong
and push yourself hardest at the
very end. Keep your head up and
your mind focused." And on and
on. I almost expect them to tell
me to breathe deep, use my arms
and lean into the tape.
The concept loses itself in the
great crashing waves of senioritis,
but the metaphor is appropriate.
The past four years have at times
felt like some sort of race: run
ning to class, competing for
grades, sprinting down the
straight-aways of parties and
dorm trips, hurdling midterms
and finals. I picture June 18 as
the white finish line stretched
across eight lanes, taut and ready
for my tired and somewhat-edu
cated body to smash through it.
Of course it doesn't end there.
After graduation, I'll enter anoth
er race, and show up for countless
ones after that. It's what keeps us
moving — after all, if there was
no end in sight, what the heck
would we aim for? The finish line
doesn't just signify the end, but
it's a reward in itself. Ask any
runner, cyclist, race car driver,
jockey or skater.
Recently a member of the
championship Stanford Cycling
Team told me about a fall he took
in the team's final race last week
end in San Luis Obispo. On a
windy downhill turn, his wheels
slipped and he went sprawling

while everyone passed him. His
chain derailed and his elbows
were badly scratched, but he got
back into the race and finished
the 60-mile course that half the
field couldn't.

In the 1992 Olympics while
running the 400 meters, Britain's
Derek Redmond collapsed on the
home stretch. Curled up in pain
with a torn hamstring, he lay on
the track until what he called an
"animal instinct" took over: he
began frantically hopping to the
finish while his father rushed
from the stands to help his son
cross the finish line.
Even in my own long-gone
days of track, I remember consid
ering the finish line both the
absolute goal and the ultimate
judge. Springing from the start
ing blocks and heading into the
first turn, life was invigorating
and sparkling. Form was tight,
the adrenaline pumped, the track
rushed underneath.
Three hundred meters later,
when the finish line leered and
beckoned, I found that life was


Ally son
Mizoguchl
not so great. It hurt. Lactic acid and
cotton mouth made unwelcome
appearances. Each meter passed
slower than the Lost, and I would
begin directing silent expletives to
the cheerful people along the finish
line who yelled their insipid "You
can do it!"s. The pain was greatest
just when the push was most
important.
It would be so easy to stop and
pull out of the race. Throw in the
towel, fall onto the grass, walk
away and never come back. But to
enter a race means to finish it.
That final stretch is the hardest,
but also the reason for entering the
race at all.
In the Kentucky Derby, the Indy
500, the Dish Dash and our own
private runs around Campus Drive,
the concept of an endpoint to our
efforts is integral. More fans stand
at the finish of a marathon than at

any single point along the course;
who crosses the line first matters
much more than who held the
longest lead. In many aspects of life
besides sports, we value the finish
much more than the journey.
Nike isn't entirely correct in its
statement that "There is no finish
line." How depressing would it be
to work one's tail off without the
feeling of accomplishment? It's like
running an eternal race.
Of course there is no single fin
ish line — there are lots of them,
some more important than others.
Finishing a 400-meter race in high
school wasn't as important as grad
uating, but both entail an endpoint
that takes tolerance for hard work
and sweat. Perhaps Nike would
serve us better with something
like, "There are only finish lines.
And more finish lines. So hop to
it."
And don't forget to lean in.
Allyson looks forward to her first
Bay to Breakers this weekend, and
hopes the ol' lactic acid stays away.
