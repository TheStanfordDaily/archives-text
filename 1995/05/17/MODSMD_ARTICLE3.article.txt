# Men's tennis claims NCAA title
## Drowns Ole Miss, 4-0; ends year undefeated 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, GA. — The No. 1 Stanford men's tennis
team (27-0) won its 13th NCAA championship yes
terday by defeating the No. 8 Mississippi Rebels (20-
7) 4-0 in a maestro performance before 2,257 specta
tors at Henry Feild Stadium at the University of
Georgia. The victory gave Stanford its fifth NCAA
title of the 1994-95 academic year, duplicating the
school's 1991-92 NCAA record.
The Cardinal's dominance in winning the doubles
point carried over into singles, where Stanford
notched three straight-set victories at Nos. 2,3 and 6
singles en route to the title.
"When it really got down to it, Stanford showed
why they have been the best team in the nation all
year long," said Ole Miss head coach Billy Chadwick.
After taking the doubles point, lOth-ranked fresh
man Scott Humphries began the scoring in singles
for the Cardinal at the No. 2 position, where he de
feated No. 23 Johan Hede 6-4, 6-0.
But trailing 2-0 and on the brink of losing, the
Rebels began inching their way back into the match
by stretching the No. 1 singles match to three sets
and nearly doing the same in Nos. 3,4 and 5 singles.
"We did make a run for it. I would have liked to
have won the second set at No. 3 to make things a lit
tle tough on them," Chadwick said. "Even though it
was 4-0, we were knocking on the door. But junior
Ricky Becker at No. 6 did a great job of closing us out
and not letting us in it."
No. 41-ranked Paul Goldstein set the stage for
Becker. The freshman, who had easily won all four of
his matches in the tournament, broke 57th-ranked
Ali Hamadeh and served out his No. 3 singles match
to win 6-1, 7-5. Then it was Becker who came
through with the championship-clinching victory.
Becker said that after his teammates began yelling
"You're the clincher," he "had an idea" that he would
be the one to do it.
The moment arrived as Becker led Van vanLingen
6-3, 5-2 with the Rebel serving. The Cardinal junior
worked his way to a double match point. After a short
rally, vanLingen got Becker on the run and forced a
short overhead that the Rebel put away easily. Now
serving at 30-40, vanLingen launched his first ser
vice into the net.
"I was hoping for a double fault," Becker joked.
"But I was hoping to hit a good approach shot."
As it happened, Becker attacked the serve then hit
a backhand volley while still approaching the net.
VanLingen's forehand could not get the ball over the

net and with that the 1995
NCAA championship trophy
belonged to Stanford.
"It was easily the best
moment I've had playing tennis.
The one moment that will stand
out. I knew that when it hap
pened," Becker said.
Becker raised his Fists into the
air, shouted triumphantly and
was met by his jubilant team
mates, led by a sprinting Gold
stein who took Becker into his
arms (or maybe it was the other
way around — none of this was
rehearsed, so it was hard to tell
just who was doing what) for a
second or two before the rest of
the team arrived to join in the
hugging match.
Last to arrive was junior cap
tain Jeff Salzenstein, whose No.
1 singles match was being played
on the front courts. His match
was suspended while on serve
early in the third set after his
opponent, second-ranked
Mahesh Bhupathi, forced a third
set by winning a second-set tie
breaker.
"Ricky Becker is the best No.
6 singles player in the country,"
Salzenstein said.
The win brought some relief
to Stanford head coach Dick
Gould, whose decades of coach
ing experience in the postseason
did not necessarily prevent a case
of the jitters.
"I don't remember being as
nervous going into a match as I

was today," Gould sa'id. "We had
a tough match against them at
the National Team Indoor Cham
pionships where we just got
kicked in doubles. I have tremen
dous respect for Mississippi.
They are an awfully good team
not to have gotten straight in."

matic qualifiers. Stanford handi
ly defeated Duke, 4-1, Mississippi
State, 4-0, and No. 4-seeded
UCLA, 4-1, on its way to the title
match.
Ole Miss traveled a much
rockier road to the Big Dance,
needing three victories in a
regional tournament just to
qualify, and pulling out three
long, hard victories against two
time defending champion USC,
4-3, third-seeded Pepperdine, 4-
2, and second-seeded Georgia, 4-
3, to make it to the final. The
Rebels' last two matches lasted
into the wee hours of the morn
ing because of rain delays.
"They were up 'til 1 a.m. in
the morning playing a gut
wrenching match," Gould said.

"We were off early and it showed
today. We were a little fresher."
Bhupathi agreed, saying, "The
guys who had tough matches
were tired. I'm sure for some it
caught up with them."
The long day for the Rebels
began in doubles, where Stan
ford took it to them in every
match. In No. 3 doubles, Salzen
stein and sophomore Grant
Elliott won their fourth match in
as many tries this week, taking
apart Hede and vanLingen, 8-2.
Then with No. 54-ranked Becker
and junior Jim Thomas leading
their No. 2 match 7-4, the No. 2-
ranked duo of Goldstein and
Humphries clinched the doubles
point with an 8-4 defeat of No. 3-
ranked Bhupathi and Hamadeh.
"We probably played our best
doubles of the year today," Gould
said. "I talked with my assistant
coach John Whitlinger last night
and we both thought today's dou
bles would be the most important
doubles point of the year."
Interestingly, Stanford play
ers said that all season they had
anticipated a final-round meet
ing with No. 2-ranked Georgia in
which the home crowd could
have made things tough on the
Cardinal. But the Rebels'
marathon upset of the Bulldogs
early yesterday morning actually
shifted the home court advan
tage to Stanford, which had
brought to Athens a small army
of devoted players' families
adorned in regulation Stanford
tennis shirts.
