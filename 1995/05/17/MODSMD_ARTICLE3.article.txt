ATHENS, GA. — The No. 1 Stanford men's tennis
team (27-0) won its 13th NCAA championship yes
terday by defeating the No. 8 Mississippi Rebels (20-
7) 4-0 in a maestro performance before 2,257 specta
tors at Henry Feild Stadium at the University of
Georgia. The victory gave Stanford its fifth NCAA
title of the 1994-95 academic year, duplicating the
school's 1991-92 NCAA record.
The Cardinal's dominance in winning the doubles
point carried over into singles, where Stanford
notched three straight-set victories at Nos. 2,3 and 6
singles en route to the title.
"When it really got down to it, Stanford showed
why they have been the best team in the nation all
year long," said Ole Miss head coach Billy Chadwick.
After taking the doubles point, lOth-ranked fresh
man Scott Humphries began the scoring in singles
for the Cardinal at the No. 2 position, where he de
feated No. 23 Johan Hede 6-4, 6-0.
But trailing 2-0 and on the brink of losing, the
Rebels began inching their way back into the match
by stretching the No. 1 singles match to three sets
and nearly doing the same in Nos. 3,4 and 5 singles.
"We did make a run for it. I would have liked to
have won the second set at No. 3 to make things a lit
tle tough on them," Chadwick said. "Even though it
was 4-0, we were knocking on the door. But junior
Ricky Becker at No. 6 did a great job of closing us out
and not letting us in it."
No. 41-ranked Paul Goldstein set the stage for
Becker. The freshman, who had easily won all four of
his matches in the tournament, broke 57th-ranked
Ali Hamadeh and served out his No. 3 singles match
to win 6-1, 7-5. Then it was Becker who came
through with the championship-clinching victory.
Becker said that after his teammates began yelling
"You're the clincher," he "had an idea" that he would
be the one to do it.
The moment arrived as Becker led Van vanLingen
6-3, 5-2 with the Rebel serving. The Cardinal junior
worked his way to a double match point. After a short
rally, vanLingen got Becker on the run and forced a
short overhead that the Rebel put away easily. Now
serving at 30-40, vanLingen launched his first ser
vice into the net.
"I was hoping for a double fault," Becker joked.
"But I was hoping to hit a good approach shot."
As it happened, Becker attacked the serve then hit
a backhand volley while still approaching the net.
VanLingen's forehand could not get the ball over the
