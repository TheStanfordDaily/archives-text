# Jessica Schulman leads Stanford's young softball program
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
In Wilbur Dining Hall, it's dif
ficult to distinguish Stanford
softball pitcher Jessica Schulman
from any other Stanford student.
A maroon sweater, jeans and a
key chain fastened at the belt
characterize Schulman and hun
dreds of other Cardinal faithful
grabbing a quick lunch on their
way to class, practice or the gym.
"I like living here [in Otero],"
Schulman says, as she bites into a
healthy-looking sandwich that
makes me feel guilty for scarfing
down a burger and fries. "The
people are cool, and it's a fun
place to live. I'm really glad that I
live in an all-freshman dorm."
Schulman's friendly, person
able personality masks a fierce
intensity that drives her to suc
ceed in a sport she has played
since childhood.
"I first started playing [soft
ball] when I was 11," she remem
bers. "I played baseball, little
league tee-ball and stuff, with the
guys even earlier than that, but
we didn't really have a softball
little league."
Growing up in Los Angeles,
"about two minutes from
UCLA," limited Schulman's soft
ball options as a youngster.
"EventuaHy, my parents
formed a league lso I could play],"
she says. "When I was good
enough, I was able to join a club
team in Orange County."
And good enough she was.
After helping lead her club team
to the national championship her
senior year, Schulman was
recruited by all the top softball
schools, including top-ranked and
hometown-favorite UCLA.
"I grew up watching them,"
Schulman recalls, as the thought
of the Bruin program brings a
smile to her face. "I know all the
girls on the team, the coaches are
like family, and I went to all their
(softball | camps while growing
up."

As a just reward for her skills
and her devotion to the team,
UCLA offered her a scholarship
and a chance to take the same
mound as the likes of softball leg
end Lisa Fernandez and current
Bruin star B'Ann Burns (who is
20-3 this year, including two wins
over the Cardinal).
"My parents often wondered
how I could pass up the opportu
nity to go to UCLA," Schulman
says. "It's a good school academi
cally and it has the best softball
program in the country. Not to
mention the fact that they could
see every game."
Faced with the options of
attending any school she wanted
and playing softball as well,
Schulman chose Stanford, whose
team was 5-30 last year in only its
first season as a varsity sport. Far
from a team with a rich softball
tradition, the Cardinal isn't even
able to play its games on campus.
Without a stadium, Stanford calls
El Camino Field, across the street
from the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, its home. No. 2 Arizona, by
contrast, plays in a 5,000 seat sta
dium that is filled to capacity
every time the Wildcats play.
"I was excited about the idea of
building a program," Schulman
explains. "Plus, UCLA is two min
utes from my house, and I wanted
to go a little farther away. Mostly,
though, I couldn't turn down a
school with the academics of
Stanford. College softball is only
four years of my life, whereas a
Stanford degree lasts a lifetime."
Although Stanford didn't nec
essarily have to do a hard-sell to
persuade her, Schulman men
tioned that her recruiting trip
last year made it difficult to go
anywhere but here.
"I met a lot of athletes while I
was here," she says. "People from
women's basketball, women's
volleyball, they told me a lot
about how much Stanford sup
ports its women's athletic pro
grams. Actually, other athletes
like [freshman golf star and Mas

ters participant] Tiger Woods
were at Stanford the same week
end I was. I couldn't believe I was
here with so many amazing ath
letes."
Schulman's recruiting trip
demonstrates more than the fact
that the Department of Athletics

knows how to sell its program. It
illustrates a broader point that
made Schulman more comfort
able shunning the top-ranked
Bruins.
"Any school that has the
money and gives a lot of support
to a softball program will have a

good team," she says. "We're
going to get a lot better really
fast, and I want to be part of
that."
The team has already
improved dramatically from a
year ago. The 1995 Cardinal have
won 15 games, three times as
many victories as last year
against a much more difficult
schedule. With 33 losses, howev
er, the squad isn't exactly light
ing up the Pacific 10 Conference.
"We set goals at the beginning
of the year," Schulman remem
bers. "Everyone got to give some
input, and we picked those that
we felt were most reasonable.
They focused more on effort and
style of play than wins and losses.
We've lost a lot of games that we
should have won, so the record
isn't always the best indicator."
Schulman points to an early
season series against Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo as proof of the
team's improvement.
"We lost both games to them
2-0, and they're ranked in the top
25," she says. "We also got seven
[highly touted] recruits for next
year. We should be able to com
pete with anyone."
Nonetheless, Schulman and
her 1995 teammates learned to
play through long losing streaks
and against superior competition,
at least this season.
"Everybody hates to lose,"
Schulman says, as her competitive
fire lights up a bit. "But everyone
loses sometime, no one's inhu
man, and you can learn a lot from
losing."
"There was a game this year
where we had a lead in the last
inning and I fell apart [and we
lost]." Letting her competitive
ness show, she says,"I will never
forget that game."
As if playing on her first losing
team isn't bad enough, 1995 has
also brought Schulman the first
significant injury of her career, a
stress fracture in her back that
caused her to miss the last half of
the season.

"It's really hard to sit and
watch," Schulman says, as the
fire in her eyes returns. "If the
team is struggling, I just want to
go out there and (take over the
game]. I want to control what's
happening. I think that's why I'm
a pitcher."
In addition, Schulman credits
her competitiveness as a secret to
her success. "You have to want
[the battlej," she says. "It's the
same way [for me] with hitting. If
we're losing, I want to immedi
ately do something about it."
While Schulman, head coach
Sandy Peajce and the rest of the
team are doing their part to build
a winning program, Schulman
hopes for continued support from
the university, including an on
campus stadium.
"Supposedly, there's going to
be one built behind Sunken Dia
mond. The process is hopefully
going to start this summer."
Being part of a new program,
in spite of these inconveniences,
has its advantages. "All of the
girls are close," she says, adding
that the team's tough attitude
has helped through the season's
rougher times.
"A lot of it starts with [junior
captain| Toni Marengo. She's so
tough, it just gives us a lift."
Against UCLA, Marengo hurled a
bat in disgust after B'Ann Burns
nailed her in the head with a high
fastball. "We're a close-knit team
and I think that helps."
Despite this year's adversity,
Schulman is adjusting quite nice
ly to life on the Farm.
"I like [Stanford] a lot," she
says, turning to say hello to
friends as they walk by us eating
lunch. "It's academic, but people
aren't so intense about studying.
It's a good atmosphere."
Although she's just a fresh
man, Schulman has already dis
covered that many Stanford stu
dents mask their intensi ,y with a
laid-back attitude. Mtybe she
isn't that different from the rest
of us after all.

San Luis Obispo as proof of the
team's improvement.
"We lost both games to them
2-0, and they're ranked in the top
25," she says. "We also got seven
[highly touted] recruits for next
year. We should be able to com
pete with anyone."
Nonetheless, Schulman and
her 1995 teammates learned to
play through long losing streaks
and against superior competition,
at least this season.
"Everybody hates to lose,"
Schulman says, as her competitive
fire lights up a bit. "But everyone
loses sometime, no one's inhu
man, and you can learn a lot from
losing."
"There was a game this year
where we had a lead in the last
inning and I fell apart [and we
lost]." Letting her competitive
ness show, she says,"I will never
forget that game."
As if playing on her first losing
team isn't bad enough, 1995 has
also brought Schulman the first
significant injury of her career, a
stress fracture in her back that
caused her to miss the last half of
the season.

"It's really hard to sit and
watch," Schulman says, as the
fire in her eyes returns. "If the
team is struggling, I just want to
go out there and (take over the
game]. I want to control what's
happening. I think that's why I'm
a pitcher."
In addition, Schulman credits
her competitiveness as a secret to
her success. "You have to want
[the battlej," she says. "It's the
same way [for me] with hitting. If
we're losing, I want to immedi
ately do something about it."
While Schulman, head coach
Sandy Peajce and the rest of the
team are doing their part to build
a winning program, Schulman
hopes for continued support from
the university, including an on
campus stadium.
"Supposedly, there's going to
be one built behind Sunken Dia
mond. The process is hopefully
going to start this summer."
Being part of a new program,
in spite of these inconveniences,
has its advantages. "All of the
girls are close," she says, adding
that the team's tough attitude
has helped through the season's
rougher times.
"A lot of it starts with [junior
captain| Toni Marengo. She's so
tough, it just gives us a lift."
Against UCLA, Marengo hurled a
bat in disgust after B'Ann Burns
nailed her in the head with a high
fastball. "We're a close-knit team
and I think that helps."
Despite this year's adversity,
Schulman is adjusting quite nice
ly to life on the Farm.
"I like [Stanford] a lot," she
says, turning to say hello to
friends as they walk by us eating
lunch. "It's academic, but people
aren't so intense about studying.
It's a good atmosphere."
Although she's just a fresh
man, Schulman has already dis
covered that many Stanford stu
dents mask their intensi ,y with a
laid-back attitude. Mtybe she
isn't that different from the rest
of us after all.

Freshman sensation Jessica Schulman was one of the Cardinal
softball program's first recruits. The pitcher missed the second
half of the season due to a back injury, but will return in 1996 with
a vengeance.
In Wilbur Dining Hall, it's dif
ficult to distinguish Stanford
softball pitcher Jessica Schulman
from any other Stanford student.
A maroon sweater, jeans and a
key chain fastened at the belt
characterize Schulman and hun
dreds of other Cardinal faithful
grabbing a quick lunch on their
way to class, practice or the gym.
"I like living here [in Otero],"
Schulman says, as she bites into a
healthy-looking sandwich that
makes me feel guilty for scarfing
down a burger and fries. "The
people are cool, and it's a fun
place to live. I'm really glad that I
live in an all-freshman dorm."
Schulman's friendly, person
able personality masks a fierce
intensity that drives her to suc
ceed in a sport she has played
since childhood.
"I first started playing [soft
ball] when I was 11," she remem
bers. "I played baseball, little
league tee-ball and stuff, with the
guys even earlier than that, but
we didn't really have a softball
little league."
Growing up in Los Angeles,
"about two minutes from
UCLA," limited Schulman's soft
ball options as a youngster.
"EventuaHy, my parents
formed a league lso I could play],"
she says. "When I was good
enough, I was able to join a club
team in Orange County."
And good enough she was.
After helping lead her club team
to the national championship her
senior year, Schulman was
recruited by all the top softball
schools, including top-ranked and
hometown-favorite UCLA.
"I grew up watching them,"
Schulman recalls, as the thought
of the Bruin program brings a
smile to her face. "I know all the
girls on the team, the coaches are
like family, and I went to all their
(softball | camps while growing
up."

As a just reward for her skills
and her devotion to the team,
UCLA offered her a scholarship
and a chance to take the same
mound as the likes of softball leg
end Lisa Fernandez and current
Bruin star B'Ann Burns (who is
20-3 this year, including two wins
over the Cardinal).
"My parents often wondered
how I could pass up the opportu
nity to go to UCLA," Schulman
says. "It's a good school academi
cally and it has the best softball
program in the country. Not to
mention the fact that they could
see every game."
Faced with the options of
attending any school she wanted
and playing softball as well,
Schulman chose Stanford, whose
team was 5-30 last year in only its
first season as a varsity sport. Far
from a team with a rich softball
tradition, the Cardinal isn't even
able to play its games on campus.
Without a stadium, Stanford calls
El Camino Field, across the street
from the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, its home. No. 2 Arizona, by
contrast, plays in a 5,000 seat sta
dium that is filled to capacity
every time the Wildcats play.
"I was excited about the idea of
building a program," Schulman
explains. "Plus, UCLA is two min
utes from my house, and I wanted
to go a little farther away. Mostly,
though, I couldn't turn down a
school with the academics of
Stanford. College softball is only
four years of my life, whereas a
Stanford degree lasts a lifetime."
Although Stanford didn't nec
essarily have to do a hard-sell to
persuade her, Schulman men
tioned that her recruiting trip
last year made it difficult to go
anywhere but here.
"I met a lot of athletes while I
was here," she says. "People from
women's basketball, women's
volleyball, they told me a lot
about how much Stanford sup
ports its women's athletic pro
grams. Actually, other athletes
like [freshman golf star and Mas

ters participant] Tiger Woods
were at Stanford the same week
end I was. I couldn't believe I was
here with so many amazing ath
letes."
Schulman's recruiting trip
demonstrates more than the fact
that the Department of Athletics

knows how to sell its program. It
illustrates a broader point that
made Schulman more comfort
able shunning the top-ranked
Bruins.
"Any school that has the
money and gives a lot of support
to a softball program will have a

good team," she says. "We're
going to get a lot better really
fast, and I want to be part of
that."
The team has already
improved dramatically from a
year ago. The 1995 Cardinal have
won 15 games, three times as
many victories as last year
against a much more difficult
schedule. With 33 losses, howev
er, the squad isn't exactly light
ing up the Pacific 10 Conference.
"We set goals at the beginning
of the year," Schulman remem
bers. "Everyone got to give some
input, and we picked those that
we felt were most reasonable.
They focused more on effort and
style of play than wins and losses.
We've lost a lot of games that we
should have won, so the record
isn't always the best indicator."
Schulman points to an early
season series against Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo as proof of the
team's improvement.
"We lost both games to them
2-0, and they're ranked in the top
25," she says. "We also got seven
[highly touted] recruits for next
year. We should be able to com
pete with anyone."
Nonetheless, Schulman and
her 1995 teammates learned to
