After opening with one event Thurs
day night, "The Athlete's Body in Histo
ry, on the Field, in Society" featured sev
eral events in its Friday and Saturday
fare.
The Athlete's Body in History
Naked Greek statues flashed the
screen in the first speech of Friday morn
ing entitled "The Athlete's Body in
Ancient Greece," given by Heidleberg
professor Glenn Most.
The morning program's theme, "The
Athlete's Body in History," traced the
history of athletes from three moments
in the pre-modern history of sport —
ancient Greece, ancient Rome and the era
of Venetian boxers.
Most's speech included slide pictures
of Greek statues and pieces of art. He
extolled the long-held image of the per
fect athlete — graceful, sleek, relaxed and
naked. Athletic competitions, which
banned women from attending and com
peting, were held in the nude. These com
petitions offered no material prizes; the
victor won crowns of foliage — and the
glory of being a hero.
Carlin A. Barton, a professor at the
University of Massachusetts, also high
lighted the glory of athletes in her speech
on "The 'Moment of Truth' in Ancient
Rome: Embodiment in a Contest Cul
ture." As Emily Dickinson once wrote,
"All was the price of all." The athletes
had immense pride and valued saving
face as well as winning.
The torment of the masses, in the
form of drunken brawls, was the topic of
Robert Davis' presentation about "Early
Modern Boxing and Venetian Ritual Bat
tles." Davis detailed the split into two fac
tions in the city of Venice, the Nicolotti
and the Castillani. These two sides
fought so much that the local authorities
banned weapons and the fighting was
done by fists alone. Another popular
sport was "the violent struggle to capture
a canal bridge — this fueled an entire cul
ture of violence and combat," Davis said.
The speeches were followed by a panel
discussion that featured several partici
pants, including Olympic swimmer
senior Jenny Thompson.
An appealing topic
The sexuality of sports, its intellectual
aspects, its societal impacts and sports

broadcasting all contributed to "Sports
Appeal," the topic of Friday's afternoon
presentation.
Allen Guttman, from Amherst Col
lege, spoke about "Eros and Sports." He
believes the phenomena surrounding
athletes is due to their physical attrac
tiveness and cited sex symbols like as for
mer quarterback Joe Namath in his
prime, basketball player Michael Jordan
and former body-builder Arnold
Schwarzenegger. Guttman also suggest
ed the athleticism of actresses like
Katherine Hamilton and Jane Fonda bol
sters their beauty.
Guttman was followed by Luis Costa
Lima, a professor at the University of Rio
de Janeiro, who discussed "Interrela
tions: Brazilian Soccer and Society." He
combined his topic of the world champion
Brazilian soccer team with its history of
racism against blacks, drawing conclu
sions about Brazilian society as a whole.
Then, Walter Moser, a professor at the
University of Montreal, presented "Pro
fessional Sports and Intellectuals: Berlin
19205." His speech surrounded the intel
lectual implications of sports and men
tioned the "satirical portrayal of profes
sional sports" in intellectual circles. He
criticized the exploitation of sports fig
ures in politics, show business, media and
economics in what he called a reduction
of the self to only the body.
Bernhard Siegert, a professor at the
Humboldt University in Berlin, also
focused on Berlin in the 19205. He
detailed the history of radio from its pri
mary use for transmission of information
during World War I to its first broadcast
for sports entertainment in the 19305.
The panel discussion chaired by Hans
Ulrich included Stanford economics pro
fessor Roger Noll, Leonard Koppett and
junior Greg Collins.
Embodiment(s)
The Saturday programming of "The
Athlete's Body" kicked off with "Embod
iment(s)"; If any one session truly epito
mized the three-day conference's aim
regarding the melding of mind and body
it was this one.
The lineup of speakers included Fred
Dretske, chair of the Department of Phi
losophy at Stanford, Regina Casper, a
professor of psychiatry at Stanford and
Cynthia Ferrell, a robotics researcher
from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
Dretske's lecture, "Where is the mind
when the body is performing?," focused

on the relationship between the athlete's
mental and physical processes during
competition.
"Never before has a philospher of the
stature of Fred Dretske been asked to
reflect on the brain-mind threshold as it
applies to the questions of sports," said
session chair and professor of compara
tive literature Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht.
Casper's lecture continued on this
theme of mind-body relations in her lec
ture on "Body and Self-Image in Ath
letes." Casper's presentation was in

essence a research project she did with
Stanford athletes concerning the impact
of self-image and the mind on perfor
mance and the body.
Ferrell provided a bit of a different
perspective in her presentation "What
Does it Take for a Robot to Become an
Athlete?" Through her discussion and
analysis on the different components
required in producing an athlete, she
drew a conclusion similar to that of the
first two lecturers — "intelligence is not
in the brain, but in the entire body."
Dretske and Casper also came to simi
lar findings regarding the importance of
an athlete to free his or her mind in order
to achieve peak performance. A panel
consisting of Prof. Glen Albaugh, sports
physician Mike Dillingham, Olympic
gymnast Jair Lynch, Prof. Marsh McCall,
Prof. Larry Meredith, track star Sarah
Truitt and Olympic luger Bonnie Warner
addressed these topics and others con
cerning the differences between mind
and body as well as the immense interre
lationship of the mind and the body.
While there were several differing per
spectives on the issue of embodiments,
one thing was certain — neither mind
nor body are mutually exclusive. Just as

the entire conference depicted a merger
between academics and athletics, this
session demonstrated that within ath
letes there is a merger between the mind
and body.
Watching Athletes
The Saturday afternoon session of the
conference featured a riveting program
dubbed "Watching Athletes." The session
focused on the identification between the
spectator and the athlete as well as soci
eties fixation on the culture of sports.
The first speaker, professor of emer
gent literatures from the University of
Geneva Wlad Godzich, addressed the
topic of society's fascination with sports.
Godzich, a self-admitted non-sports fan,
presented a lecture which centered
around his premise that sports breaches
the boundaries of reason.
"Sports is scandalous in the sense that
it is a reminder of reason's failure to the
body," Godzich said.
Peter Nadermann, the second speaker
and a professor in the Department of
Film and Television from the Art Acade
my for Media in Cologne, Germany, pre
sented a differing view. As a fan of sports,
Nadermann illustrated why sports and
watching athletes is so attractive via a
video screening. The video, a compilation
of clippings from the finals of the World
Cup complete with reactions from fans
and athletes, forcefully depicted the
drama and heroism of sports which are
able to enthrall entire societies.
The third speaker, Maria Menocal,
professor of Spanish and Portuguese
from Yale and an avid sports fan, deliv
ered a brilliant, enrapturing speech on
the importance of watching sports and
recognizing sports as a true form of cul
ture. Her lecture, entitled "Sons and
Mothers, Men and Women: Sports and
the Family Romance," not only
addressed the issue and generalization
posed by Godzich of sports as an inferior
type of culture, especially in the eyes of
academia and women, but also showed
why watching sports is an integral com
ponent of human-to-human relation
ships.
For Menocal, the culture of competi
tive sports, coupled with the watching
and the knowledge of sports, provides a
medium for shaping and telling life, and
in many ways, a story of the coming of
age of human beings. As for the prejudice
to sports by the academic world and
women, Menocal sees it as their own
"exclusion from the romance of sports."

The three lectures were followed by a
panel discussion featuring Leon Camp
bell, Prof. Bliss Carnochan, Pitch John
son, sportswriter Leonard Koppett,
Stanford men's basketball coach Mike
Montgomery, and rugby legend Jean-
Pierre Rives. The discussion flowed from
topic to topic, focusing on issues such as
differing perceptions from society, the
impact of technology, the deterioration
of athletics as fun and team-oriented, as
well as several of the aforementioned
subjects.
Sports, Sex and Gender
The conference wrapped up with its
final session at Stanford called "Sports,
Sex and Gender." Leading gender theo
rist and philosopher Judith Butler pre
sented a lecture chiefly pertaining to the
realtionship between sports and gender
norms. Butler presented the possibility of
sports helping society change certain
negative gender norms for females —
empowerment through sports.
Panelists included psychologist Julie
Anthony, Mariah Burton Nelson, Prof.
Carla Freccero, Prof. Allen Guttmann
and Prof. Patricia Parker. Current gen
der issues in sports such as the contro
versial statements made by LPGA com
mentator Ben Wright regarding women
and lesbians in golf as well as gender test
ing were discussed.
The focus on gender, in many ways,
brought the three-day conference full cir
cle. With both the inaugural program on
"Race" Thursday night to Saturday
night's program on "Sports, Sex, and
Gender" focusing on culturally framed
projections and social norms, the confer
ence posed one main question — can ath
letes change society?
With attendance at the conference
somewhat below expectations, "The Ath
lete's Body" nevertheless demonstrated
the achievements possible through a
combined effort between the mind and
body — both within society and within
the individual.
"Our goal was an academic pursuit,"
said Rick Schavone, Cardinal diving
coach and director of special projects in
the athletic department. "It was a
tremendous academic pursuit. We
wished the audeince was larger. We
didn't have the turnout we wanted, but
that was a secondary goal. Our primary
goal was an academic pursuit between
the humanists and the Athletics Depart
ment, and we obviously reached that
goal."
