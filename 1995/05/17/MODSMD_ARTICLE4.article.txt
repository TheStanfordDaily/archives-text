# Safety committee reports no EPA violations
## 
### Marie Rosencrantz Contributing writer 
After improving University health
and safety programs to address EPA
charges of improper hazardous waste
management last fall, the Committee
on Health and Safety reported a much
cleaner record for Stanford yesterday
at a public meeting.
California Environmental Protec
tion Agency inspections last month
found no new violations of federal or
state health and safety regulations at
the University, said Senior Assoc.
Dean of the School of Engineering
John Bravman, chair of the committee.
Bravman said the University's cur
rent health and safety program is "an
active and rigorous program that ad
dresses all safety, health and environ

mental concerns."
Last September, Stanford agreed to
a $2.65 million settlement of charges
brought by the state's EPA in 1992
concerning improper handling of haz
ardous waste on campus. The Univer
sity admitted to some 640 violations of
state law over a six-year period.
According to Larry Gibbs, associate
vice president of Environmental
Health and Safety and one of yester
day's speakers, the charges mostly con
cerned alleged improper labeling of
hazardous waste containers.
"We are trying very hard but some
times, through oversight, something
might be missed," Gibbs said.
Bravman attributed many of the
EPA charges to the fact that "EPA reg
ulations are not written for research
environments, rather for industrial en

vironments.''
In order to address the EPA
charges, the University recently re
verted its on-campus waste storage fa
cility operations to a maximum of 90
days of waste accumulation, down
from a maximum of 365 days last year.
The committee also responded to
last year's public concern about the
campus incinerator, which was pri
marily used to dispose of hospital and
medical waste. The waste is now han
dled by off-campus contractors.
In addition, the committee devel
oped an interactive video training pro
gram for the handling of hazardous
waste.
"I think that in the two-and-a-half
years I have been here, there have been
tremendous changes within the safety
and health programs," Gibbs said. "We

have really enhanced the health and
safety awareness [at] Stanford."
The committee is responsible for ex
ercising oversight "over all health and
safety programs at Stanford, including
those of the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center," Bravman said. It advises
University President Gerhard Casper
on needs and strategies to "promote
good health, safety and sound environ
mental practices on campus," he
added.
Fifteen people were present at the
committee's annual public meeting, all
associated with the committee or its
work. According to Bravman, the small
turnout is "good news."
"This means that the public does
not have any major concerns with the
Stanford health and safety programs,"
he said.
