# 'A dialogue about values'
## 'What matters' breaks barriers 
### Kate Stinger 
Last spring, a group of graduate students on
campus decided to break the barrier between stu
dent and professor and ask deeper, more personal
questions of Stanford faculty.
The "What Matters to Me and Why" program,
which meets bi-monthly in Memorial Church, is a
forum for students to get to know about what pro
fessors think and feel outside of their research.
The program consists of an hour-long discussion
in which the invited professor speaks for 20 min
utes about what is important in his or her person
al life. Following the talk, students ask questions.
The program was started by the Black Gradu
ate Students Association with a pilot entitled
"Soul to Soul," supported by Provost Condoleezza

Rice. The organization then invited
other groups to participate in the
discussion.
"The most important thing to
me is what this series does for the
whole campus.... It's a dialogue
about values," said Quintus Jett,
an industrial engineering graduate
student.
According to the Rev. Floyd
Thompkins, associate dean of
Memorial Church, the program
was started because students
"wanted professors to talk from

the heart about their careers and
their existence as a person." As the
program developed, he said, stu
dents discovered that "professors
are much more ready to be engaged
on a personal basis" than people
know.
Jett pointed out the importance
of a program started and run by
graduate students. "Issues that the
series deals with are very impor
tant to one in the sense that when
you look at numbers, there are
more graduate students than
undergraduate," Jett said. "The
program provides a better chance
to look at graduate students."
Although "What Matters to Me
and Why" is neither exclusively for

those in engineering nor limited to
graduate students, all of the mem
bers of the steering committee are
engineering graduates. Sara Dill, a
doctoral student in materials sci
ence and engineering and a mem
ber of the steering committee,
points out that "it's kind of ironic
that we have a lot of engineers as
the planners, but I think they're
the people who don't have a chance
to think about these things in their
research."
Materials Science and Engineer
ing Prof. Emeritus Richard Bube
met with a similar issue when he
spoke at a program. A student
asked why so many Christians are
science students and Bube replied

that the "scientist who takes their
work seriously is in awe of the
world. You know you don't always
have the answer."
Bube added that he feels this
may be lost among students in the
humanities, saying that humani
ties students may have "all the rea
son in the world" not to believe in
Christian ideals. He suggested that
scientists have even more reason to
believe in religion than non-scien
tists.
Although the program provides
a refreshing break from their
research, some students said they
feel it is not just a relief but an
important component of their
lives.

"I'm trying to build parts of my
life as things of equal importance.
I'm not trying to get a fresh breath
and go back in to my work," grad
uate student David Owens said,
adding that he likes the program
because it gives him a chance to
"discuss issues of morality and
how people make it through this
life without feeling alienated or
that their lives are meaningless."
Owens said he also sees the pro
gram as giving students a chance to
"make human contact with people
who have changed the world."
Dill agreed that the program
has a profound effect on how its
participants view Stanford. "My
outlook on Stanford has changed,

because I know there's more out
there than what I've seen," she
said.
While the meetings — where
students informally sit in a circle
— sometimes consist of as few as a
dozen students, Thompkins said
he feels the experience is still posi
tive. There is a "phenomenon of
intimacy" which might not exist
were the group too large, he added.
Up to 50 students have attend
ed the meetings, though the usual
number hovers between 20 and
50.
There are five speakers per
quarter, each invited by a different
member of the program's steering
committee.
