# 'A dialogue about values'
## 'What matters' breaks barriers 
### Kate Stinger 
Last spring, a group of graduate students on
campus decided to break the barrier between stu
dent and professor and ask deeper, more personal
questions of Stanford faculty.
The "What Matters to Me and Why" program,
which meets bi-monthly in Memorial Church, is a
forum for students to get to know about what pro
fessors think and feel outside of their research.
The program consists of an hour-long discussion
in which the invited professor speaks for 20 min
utes about what is important in his or her person
al life. Following the talk, students ask questions.
The program was started by the Black Gradu
ate Students Association with a pilot entitled
"Soul to Soul," supported by Provost Condoleezza
