# Modifications to silence slamming Wilbur doors
## 
### Ben Sussman Contributing writer 
After seven weeks of living with
the constant racket of slamming
doors, Wilbur Hall residents may
finally be able to close their doors
without scaring their neighbors.
Modifications that will allow
the doors to close without slam
ming began yesterday, said Clark
Vitt, facilities supervisor in
Wilbur.
Vitt said that in order to meet
building codes, new gasketing was
installed around the doors during
spring break. Prior to these modi
fications, the doors closed normal
ly.
The doors, which were original
ly replaced during Wilbur's 1993
remodeling, are supposed to close
and latch on their own but should
be able to do so without slamming.

Apparently, the gasket balance
has been thrown off, Vitt said. The
doors "require a lot of mainte
nance. When the gaskets start
wearing in, the doors start slam
ming," he explained.
The gaskets apparently "wore
in" quickly because Wilbur resi
dents said their doors have been
slamming since the beginning of
spring quarter.
"For the first two weeks [of the
quarter], it really stressed people
out," said freshman Dara Frim
mer, a resident in Junipero
House.
Although the slamming doors
have bothered many students,
Rinconada resident assistant
Britt Wahlin said the faulty doors
cause a more serious danger.
"It's been a nuisance, but it's
also a security problem," she said.
Many students try to let the
doors to their rooms close gently
to avoid the noise and annoy
ance, Wahlin said. "A lot of
times for the door to lock, you
need to let it slam."
Wahlin also said that several
of the exit doors in her dorm's
lounge do not close, creating
what she considers to be anoth
er security concern.
"Stanford is not the most
dangerous campus but it's still a
concern," she said.
Like many Wilbur residents,
Wahlin is also frustrated that it
has taken seven weeks for the
problem to be fixed.
"All RAs have to deal with
maintenance issues at some
time," she said, but "it bothers
me that an effort wasn't made
to fix the problem immediately."
Vitt said there have been
some scheduling conflicts
because of the large amount of
manpower necessary to com
plete the required adjustments.
