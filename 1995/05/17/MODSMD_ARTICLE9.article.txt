# Incoming COP chooses issues, from financial aid to advising
## 
### Anne Dubinsky Contributing writer 
Responding to the complex nature of the prob
lems facing students, each member of next year's
Council of Presidents will focus on a specific issue
rather than a division of the University.
Members of the incoming COP are juniors
Mike Choo, Nicole Vazquez, Rich Stolz and Jon
Oram, all part of the People's Platform party.
This year's COP covered the areas of ASSU
operations, graduate student affairs, undergradu
ate student affairs and all campus issues, Choo
said.
In contrast, each member of the incoming COP
will be responsible for a specific issue, including
financial aid and the University's advising sys
tem.
"We have a very diverse slate with a lot of expe
rience in different areas," Choo said. "By splitting
up the issues (among the incoming COP mem
bers), everyone is accountable. The COP should
be a strong, organized advocacy institution on
behalf of students."
Vazquez agreed. "We're trying not to be as iso
lated in our duties and responsibilities," Vazquez
said. "Our duties are separated by issues [rather]
than entities."
Vazquez said she thinks this new distribution
is better suited to the problems that the COP will
face.
"This is a better process. It is more cohesive
and allows us to know more and gather more
resources," she said. "The issues we will deal with
will be multi-dimensional and they need lots of
coordination. We cannot work separately."
Choo will serve as chairman of the COP and its
chief spokesperson. He said he will attend meet

ings of the University Board of Trustees and will
handle matters relating to academic policy and
management.
Vazquez will become the chair of the ASSU
Legal Counseling Policy Board and an ex-officio
member of the ASSU Senate Appropriations
Committee.
Vazquez said she will work to implement one of
the slate's campaign promises — to create a tax
counseling service to offer advice to students. She
added that she will also assemble the COP cabinet
and coordinate internal cabinet affairs.
In addition to dealing with the needs of gradu
ate students and the ethnic communities, Vazquez
said she will work on issues of financial aid.
"I will be trying to coordinate talks with the
University about financial aid," Vazquez said. "I
will talk to the Financial Aids Office about how we
can affect the process. I will find out about things
that happen in Washington and think of ways to
get word out" about financial aid issues.
Stolz, a founder of the Student Advising Group
on Undergraduate Education, will become the
COP representative for the Faculty Senate. He
will serve as a liaison between different student
organizations and the COP and will also head a
committee that will focus on the University's
advising system.
Oram will serve as an ex-officio member of the
ASSU Senate Administration and Rules Commit
tee and become a liaison for legislative issues that
affect the student body, Choo said.
According to Choo, the new COP has three
immediate goals — to allow students to have an
active role in the search for a new Dean of Stu
dents, to make the Stanford Directory a business
project for the ASSU and to search for a new COP
cabinet.
