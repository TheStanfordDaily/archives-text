WHAT SftADC DOCS KtUOS6'S DCAN JACOBS
DCSCRVC ON HUMAN RIMS?
Donald P. Jacobs, Dean of Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management,
serves on the board of directors of UNOCAL Corporation, a leading sustainer of Burma's illegal
military junta. Here's what major U.S. newspapers say about Burma's shameful human rights record
and UNOCAL'S joint venture with the generals:
NEW VORK TIMES, 11/14/94:
"Burma's ruling junta, tl.<» State Law and Order
Restoration Council, or SLORC, is one of the
world's most brutal, least ligitimate regimes. It
seized power by massacring democracy
demonstrators in the streets of Rangoon...lt has
ignored elections, cooperated with drug lords,
and waged a relentless war against democratic
political leaders, university students, Buddhist
religious activists, and the ethnic minorities
who make up more than a third of Burma's
population." J
BOSTON GLOBE, 10/18/93
"...the SLORC has committed the most
heinous violations of human rights. The
bloodthrirsty officers of SLORC have
kidnapped their country from the
Burmese people, who in 1990 gave 82%
of their votes to the party of Aung San
Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate
whom the generals have held under
house arrest for the past five years" .
Dean Jacobs believes that UNOCAL'S presence in Burma will help bring democracy to that country.
The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times disagree:
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 2/10/95:
"V\te have argued for commerce and investment where It strengthens civil societies vis-a-vis
dictators. But these deals, by putting money directly into SLORC's pocket, only make a richer
prize out of political power. The prospects of vast petrdollars gives the generals yet another
reason to cling to office no matter how many bodies of their fellow citizens pile up."
LOS ANGELES TIMES, 2/14/95:
"...the Burmese military still thrives,
prospering thanks to rake-offs from drug
trafficking, international sales of natural
resources and playing host to many
international companies. Included among
these companies, alas, are American firms."
