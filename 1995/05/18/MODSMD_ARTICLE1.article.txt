## Observer, magazine may merge 
### Colleen Krueger Senior staff writer 
The independent Stanford magazine will take a
step toward becoming a University publication this
weekend if the Alumni Association's board of direc
tors approves a merger designed to replace the mag
azine and the Stanford Observer with a new alumni
publication.
For about 20 years, both Stanford magazine and
the Stanford Observer have targeted Stanford alum
ni, with the independent Alumni Association putting
out Stanford magazine and the Observer published
by Stanford News Service.
As part of an effort to revamp the Observer, how
ever, the University has proposed that the two alum
ni publications merge to form the new publication —
with News Service staff "majoring in University
news" and the former Stanford magazine staff "ma
joring in alumni news," said Alumni Association Di
rector Bill Stone.
Beyond the budgetary and efficiency issues be
hind the plan, Director of University Communica
tions Terry Shepard said that an alumni survey
found that alumni do not recognize that one publica
tion is produced by the University, while the other
comes from an outside source. For these reasons, the
existence of two magazines may be superfluous, he
said.
If the Alumni Association's board approves the
proposed merger, the University Board of Trustees
will have final say in June, Shepard said.
If approved, the new joint publication will be pub
lished six times a year. In the event that the merger
is not approved, the University will publish its own
quarterly magazine, Stanford Today instead of the
Observer. Stanford magazine is also quarterly.
While Shepard said he was "very hopeful and ex
cited" about the merger, others have expressed fears
that the University is pressing for editorial control of
the sometimes-controversial Stanford magazine and
that the plan will destroy Stanford magazine's repu
tation as a voice independent from the University's
official line.
With this weekend's vote looming, those at Stan
ford magazine are treading cautiously.
"Once we see what the publication is going to be,
we'll then start moving towards creating the best
alumni publication possible," said Stanford maga
zine Editor Bruce Anderson, who admitted he is still
a bit unclear about his staff s role in the new joint
venture.
Stone, who said that he could
see both "advantages and disad
vantages" to the plan, agreed that
the question of whether or not the
Stanford magazine staff would
continue to cover the kind of
broad, issue-oriented stories they
have become known for still needs
to be worked out.
Stone added that he did not

expect the magazine's editorial
content to be squelched by the
University. "Our presumption is
that it will be business as usual,"
he said.
Shepard also stressed that "no
one is going to be saying this can
go in or that can't go in."
University President Gerhard
Casper has a history of dissatis
faction with Stanford magazine's
content.
For example, Casper formally
complained about a June 1993
cover story on gays at Stanford.
The article — published at the end

of Casper's first year in office, a
year in which he extended benefits
to gay and lesbian domestic part
ners — sent the wrong message
about Casper's priorities, Shepard
said. The story also prompted
angry mail from alumni.
In addition, Casper felt that an
article about last spring's hunger
strike, written by a participant,
did not give alumni a balanced
picture of the protest, Shepard
said. The hunger strike was led by
Chicano / Latino students
demanding concessions from the
University.
