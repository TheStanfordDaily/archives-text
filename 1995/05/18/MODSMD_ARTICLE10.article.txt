# Doctor says poor are being scapegoated

### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
Arguing that America's poor have been writ
ten off by a society that increasingly scapegoats
the needy, David Hilfiker, a physician and writ
er who has spent more than a decade treating
underserved patients in a low-income neighbor
hood of the District of Columbia, called for a
coming together between rich and poor in a lec
ture yesterday at Kresge Auditorium.
The American public, once outraged by the
presence of poverty and believing it a problem
that could be solved, has now turned its back on
the poor, Hilfiker told the audience of about 90
people.
"The sense that poverty was wrong was a
generally prevailing attitude," Hilfiker said,
referring to the days of President Johnson's
Great Society.
Throughout his speech, Hilfiker described
individuals he has encountered during his prac
tice who, he argued, represent a segment of soci-

ety deemed increasingly fit only for incarcera
tion or whatever misfortune befalls them.
"We've settled on the Calcutta solution to
poverty — that the poor will have to fend for
themselves," Hilfiker asserted. "And it hasn't
stopped at abandonment. It has become active
scapegoating of the poor, a projection and blam
ing of the poor for the ills of society."
Hilfiker pointed to and questioned the value
of broad and bipartisan support for an increas
ingly hard-line approach to criminal offenders,
citing the "three strikes" law, mandatory mini
mum sentencing and the expansion of the num
ber of crimes eligible for the death penalty as
examples of society's fear and mistrust of the
poor.
"Something more than justifiable anger is
happening. There's more than meets the eye,"
he said. "We project our fear, hate and broken
ness that's too painful to bear on others."
Drawing parallels to the scapegoating of
Jews by Nazi Germany, the Croats by Serbs in
former Yugoslavia and the Hutus by Tutsis in

Rwanda, Hilfiker saw the crisis with America's
poor as reaching a critical juncture.
"The same process is beginning in our evolv
ing attitude towards the poor," he said. "There
are no boundaries. There is no reason to believe
we are immune to proposals of the 'ultimate
solution.' We are in a dangerous moment in our
nation's history."
By bringing forth examples of several men he
had met and lived with at Joseph's House, a
shelter for homeless men infected with the HIV
virus, and describing his own struggle with clin
ical depression, Hilfiker argued that the divides
of class, race and education can be bridged.
"Those of us who live and work there have
been offered a profound solidarity with people
we don't normally know,"he said, "and have
learned the power of a simple cliche — that they
are no different from us."
"This is the fundamental value of public ser
vice work," he added. "No longer are they the
faceless poor. They become 'Howard,' or 'Mau
reen' and we see in them ourselves."
