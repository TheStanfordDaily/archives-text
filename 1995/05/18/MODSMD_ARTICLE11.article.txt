WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Janet
Reno is seeking an independent counsel to investi
gate the finances of Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown, the third Clinton administration Cabinet
officer to face scrutiny under a government ethics
law.
In documents unsealed yesterday, Reno asked a
court panel to appoint the counsel to determine if
Brown improperly accepted nearly $500,000 from a
business partner and whether he deliberately filed
inaccurate disclosure statements and a misleading
mortgage statement.
A deliberate omission on the annual financial dis
closure statement would be illegal. In this case, Reno
said evidence indicates Brown "lacked criminal
intent in his failure to disclose this information."
But she called for the independent counsel to
investigate anyway because "I am unable to con

elude at this juncture that such evidence is clear and
convincing."
Brown, called Reno's request "disappointing." He
said he was confident he would be exonerated.
Chechnya body isn't Cuny's
MOSCOW (AP) — A spokesman for Russia's
counterintelligence agency said yesterday that a
body found recently in Chechnya was not that of
missing American relief expert Fred Cuny, as was
widely suspected.
A member of a Western team searching for Cuny,
reached by telephone near Chechnya, called the
statement "very interesting" but said the searchers
had no new information.
Cuny, 50, a Texas businessman, vanished April 9
along with his Russian translator and two Russian
Red Cross doctors while on a mission in Chechnya
for the New York-based Soros Foundation.
