# Senate asks for Packwood inquiry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen.
Bob Packwood must face a full
scale Senate investigation of alle
gations that he made improper
sexual advances toward women,
sought job offers for his wife from
lobbyists and businessmen and
obstructed an ethics probe, the
Senate ethics committee conclud
ed yesterday.
In a five-page report, the panel
alleged that Packwood committed
18 incidents of sexual misconduct
from 1969 to 1990 toward his own
and colleagues' staffs, a dining
room hostess, a hotel desk clerk, a
babysitter, a campaign worker, a
Capitol elevator operator and oth
ers.
The report suggests the five
term Republican senator from
Oregon may have altered his per
sonal diaries sometime in Decem

ber 1992, knowing it was likely
the committee would ask to see
them — a possible violation of fed
eral law as well as Senate rules.
Yesterday's report came at the
end of a two-and-a-half-year pre
liminary inquiry by the panel. The
formal probe it will now launch
ultimately could lead to punish
ments ranging from a rebuke to
expulsion from the Senate.
Packwood, who became chair
man of the Senate Finance Com
mittee this year, also could be
stripped of that title just when the
panel is shaping crucial welfare
and tax legislation.
He seemed shaken yesterday
morning as he emerged from a
hearing he held on Medicare, voic
ing surprise that the ethics panel
had listed each instance of alleged
sexual misconduct.

While he has apologized in the
past for "terribly offensive"
behavior towards women, he
refused to comment yesterday on
the report's details.
In a formal statement, Pack
wood said he will now "have an
opportunity to request an appear
ance before the committee to dis
cuss the matter — as I did not have
a chance to appear before the com
mittee at this preliminary stage."
Packwood did give a five-day
deposition in January to commit
tee staffers but not to his fellow
senators. The deposition has not
been made public.
"Beyond that," Packwood said,
"these proceedings are confiden
tial and it would be inappropriate
for me to comment further at this
time. I shall continue to cooperate
with the committee."
