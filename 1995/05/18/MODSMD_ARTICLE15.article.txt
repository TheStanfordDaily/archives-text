University should help
students use its alumni
in hunt for internships

IT'S THAT TIME of year
again. No, it's not the time for
the May flowers that April
showers bring. And spring or no
spring, at Stanford it is certainly
no more of a romantic time than
the rest of the year.
It is official internship-hunting
season. Students who haven't
lined one up by now are either
sweating it out on Odyssey or
have resigned themselves to being
homeward-bound. Most people
who have gone through this rite
of passage are bewildered by just
how difficult it is to work for free.
Stanford could make it much
easier for undergraduates and
graduates to find meaningful
employment over the summer by
providing better access to one of
the University's most valuable
assets — alumni. Stanford alum
ni are working in most of the
occupations which current stu
dents may one day pursue, and by
making contact with these alum
ni, students would increase their
chances of securing summer jobs
from which they may gain impor
tant experience.
The Career Planning and
Placement Center does have some
folders on internship possibilities
with a few names and numbers of
alums, but these are much more
restricted than the numerous
internship opportunities out
there. Surely, many more alumni
would be happy to volunteer a bit
of their time to help students
from their alma mater find a job
than currently do.
The University could send out
a survey to all alumni, asking
them if they would be willing to
take some time to assist students,
and maintain large and well-orga
nized files on internship opportu
nities with alumni contacts in the
CPPC. This is the type of cooper

ation between alumni and stu
dents that the University should
encourage; it would be beneficial
to all of those involved.
Students clearly would have a
much easier time finding summer
jobs and internships that they are
interested in. Alumni would also
be able to recruit talented Stan
ford students to work at intern
ships that might otherwise
receive little publicity. And the
University, by planning and
implementing such relationships,
would gain standing in the eyes of
both current and former stu
dents.
The costs of the survey would
be minimal in relation to the
many benefits it would supply,
and records could also be updated
regularly without excessive cost
or difficulty. The records would
only need updating relatively
infrequently since many alumni
stay at the same jobs for several
years.
In addition to the direct bene
fits such a program would grant
alumni and students, it would
also help the University in less
tangible ways. Students and
alumni would feel closer to each
other and more connected to the
University. Stanford would begin
to feel more like a family and less
like a business.
And given the fact that Stan
ford does need revenue, like a
business, one can imagine that
these sentiments would carry
over into greater alumni satisfac
tion, and therefore higher rates of
alumni giving (and need we men
tion that this would translate into
a higher ranking in the sacred
U.S. News and World Report
review of universities?).
If Stanford is really concerned
about improving the happiness of
alumni and students, as adminis
trators say it is, the University
could do a lot more to make Stan
ford feel like a community. Pro
grams that increase interaction
between alumni and students
would be an excellent way of
accomplishing that goal.
