Class 0f1995 should leave video tapes out of time capsule

THIS LETTER concerns an article
titled "Burying the present: time
capsule tradition" in the Com
mencement Countdown section of the
May 14 Stanford Daily. The article men
tioned that among the items slated for
inclusion in the time capsule are videos
of hit TV shows "ER" and "Melrose
Place." I should begin by mentioning
that there are electrical engineers and
physicists on campus who are much bet
ter qualified to comment on the long
term stability of magnetic media than
myself. However, it is my understanding
that with floppy disks and computers
tapes, the data starts becoming corrupt
after five years and the disk / tape is
unreadable after twenty years. The sta
bility of data after 20 years is a non
issue because machines necessary to
read 20 year-old data are so obsolete

that they no longer exist.
Video tapes have the same storage
limitations as computer magnetic media.
Have you ever noticed how grainy an old
video tape looks? This loss of resolution
is mainly due to stretching and rubbing
of the tape as it passes over the magnetic
heads of the tape recorder. However, loss
of data also occurs due to thermal
cycling (day and night temperature fluc
tuations) and quantum noise. Most peo
ple have experienced the failure of an
audio tape left in the sun light on the
dashboard of their car.
Filling a time capsule up with video
tapes probably will leave historians 200
years in the future with a poor impres
sion of the Class of 1995 because the
tapes will be unreadable. This actually
raises an interesting issue: What are
appropriate items to leave in a time cap

sule? For example, old timo capsule
favorites are newspapers. However, leav
ing behind anything written on cheap
sulfite paper like newsprint would be
pointless because the paper would turn
to dust after one or two centuries. Go to
the newspaper room in any major
research library, and you'll find that
most of the very old newspapers are on
microfilm (a very stable media). Also,
leaving popular, widely-distributed com
mercial items like newspapers or video
taj>es like "Melrose Place" in a time cap
suie is pointless because somewhere
those items are probably carefully pre
served in a research library.
What should go into a time capsule
are items that can be preserved for cen
turies and are not likely to be placed in a
library. Some good examples listed in the
Commencement Countdown were a

poster sandwiched between mylar sheets
about Naomi Wolf speaking on campus,
a Coffee House pitcher, a shot glass from
Senior Casino Night and a Juice Club
cup, among others.
Photographic material should preferably
be black and white on Kodak paper (very
stable) or color slides on "Kodachrome,
which Ls one of the few stable color emul
sions. All of these items should be placed in
a brass or copper container that is air tight.
The container should be flushed with pure
nitrogen or argon before permanently seal
ing it. Following these suggestions would
leave future historians with a much better
impression of the Class of '95.
