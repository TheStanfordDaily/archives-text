# Finishing a midterm after time is up hurts more honest students
## 
### 
You're taking a long midterm. You
notice you have three minutes left and
write faster. Your hand hurts. The TA
calls time. You keep working, writing at
the speed of light. Your brain can pro
cess information at rates a million times
faster than normal. Everyone around
you is still working. You're safe ... you
can get partial credit, and you may even
finish the problem.
Now people are turning in their

exams. You keep working. You're
inspired, you're invincible. Someone
says to you, "You're not supposed to be
working past time." Ignore her. You
deserve the extra time — you're special.
You're getting an extra seven minutes.
You may get those extra 12 points. You
feel powerful.
You jerk. Worm. Tool.
I turned in my test on time. I quit
working. I followed the rules. I stood
there and watched you work .. . growing
more and more angry as your intense
countenance melted into satisfaction as
you scrawled out your last few calcula
tions. I asked the TA if he would quit
accepting late exams. In response to my
complaint that people were still working,
he said, "There's only so much I can

do."
I'll tell you what I'd do if I were your
TA. I'd say, "Screw you. I'm not taking
your late exam. You signed that thing
that said 'No unpermitted aid given or
received.' You got extra aid; you got
more time. You know time is of the
essence when you're taking an exam . . .
that's why you're still working. Forget
you. Too bad. All the other honest,
upstanding, exemplary Stanford stu
dents followed the rules. They played
fair. I'm going to put a gold star on their
exams. Use your exam to dry those sorry
tears because I'm not taking it."
But I'm not your TA. I'm your fellow
student. And you don't give a rip about
the fact that I turned in my test on time.
In fact, you'd say I'm a fool.

Maybe you were clueless. I could tell
myself, heck, you didn't know anything,
and working past time did nothing for
you because you were lost. But maybe
you weren't. Maybe you knew it all, and
you're going score really well now —
especially with all that extra time you
had to work. You'll look down upon my
score from your high and mighty place
on the histogram and sneer.
Sigh. Well, have a nice life, rat. Best
wishes in your future exams. On behalf
of the honest and fair people, I want to
inform you that justice will be served.
Your exam-taking evil-doing will come
back to haunt you. Because good always
triumphs. See you at the final.
