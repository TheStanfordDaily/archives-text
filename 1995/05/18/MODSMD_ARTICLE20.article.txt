## Boobs, babes and body hair 
### 
AH, MEN. Recently, one asked me if I
liked being female. Casually, in a
"Do-you-like-Razzmatazz-with-juice
boost?" kind of way.
How random, I said. And I was ready to
praise the totality of the gender. Even the
monthly annoyances.
"Talk to me about the bad stuff," the
voyeur replied. "Tell it like it really is."
A couple things came to mind. The fact
that many golf courses don't give women
memberships and optimal tee times. Of
course, it's been alleged that the boob fac
tor ruins good golf swings, anyway. Good
thing I don't play. I've been meaning to ask
the women's team if it's true.
Or just symptomatic of something gone
awry.
And the work and childbirth thing. I'm
perplexed when guys say, in the old "if two
candidates were equally qualified" sce
nario, that they'd hire the male employee
to avoid lost hours, weeks and months due
to that inconvenient childbirth deal. "It's
better business," they say. Well, that's a bit
disconcerting.
But then, those issues pale in compari
son to the problem of hair.
Life sans certain hair is critical. So criti
cal that someone created a bunch of inge
nious ways to get rid it. And fashion maga
zines, in addition to helping people feel fab
ulously inadequate, create pain-o-hair
removal meters to assess the torture levels.
Read all about it.
And name your poison.
You shave. It's back in three hours. You

depilatory. And pass out from the fumes.
For a change, you Epilady™. Rotating coils
painlessly pry unsuspecting hairs from
their sorry little roots. Or maybe you wax.
Warm goo yanks with a resounding rip. All
gone for a few weeks. And then the suckers
grow back like weeds.
Where does that leave us? Shaving, wax
ing, tweezing, ripping it all out — how
annoying. Time to isolate the gene.
As if Elle and Cindy were born hairless.
You make a statement either way. Hair
less = slave to culture. Hairy = waiting for
The Dead to come to town. Hair should be
neutral; do what you want. Still, I admire
the people who let it all grow; it's harder to
swim against the cultural current.
But is body hair a major fashion or polit
ical statement for men? They've got some
less than optimal growths. Armpit fur? Not
appealing. And at times that fluff is worn
like a badge of honor. A friend of mine grew
some, finally, and wore tank-tops everyday
so we could see he was maturing.
It may only be a matter of time before
someone decides that women's forearm
fuzz is grotesque. Who's on the rules com
mittee here, anyway? I'd like to meet
them... and pluck out every last hair.
But I gave in to culture or peer pressure
or something when I was in seventh grade
P.E., with those clingy blue shorts that
seemed to be a diseased relative of spandex,
and everyone could see who had too much
shag. Smooth legs were key to fit your
gawky self in. Everyone figured it was time
to molt. And there were no deviants.

I had heard that waxing, over time, actu
ally makes hair disappear. Thinking to the
future, as always, I decided to go the wax
ing route.
About as much fun as havingyour blood
drawn. And the wound rubbed with salt
But believing in the waxing mythology, I
still do it regardless of the fact that it might
be more comfortable to be the practice rec
tal patient for the med students. And
recently, I had a hair epiphany. Bright
lights and everything.
I said to the fast and efficient waxer
woman, "Why do women do this? It's
ridiculous." And she said, "So you'll look
nice."
So you'll look nice.
For whom? Me? What would Gloria
Steinem do?
As I was counting the dots in the ceiling,
I thought heard a voice. Or it just seemed
that way, since I was passing in and out of
consciousness from the pain.
Of all people, Mr. Rogers appeared. Con
fused, I explained between winces, "You
know, I never liked you. I just liked the trol
ley." He didn't seem to mind. Surprisingly,
a sensitive, long-haired ponytail man at
heart.
Buttoning his sweater, he said, "You
know, I like you just the way you are." A lit
tle bit cultish, but it was certainly some
thing to think about.
And men get hair implants. Go figure.
