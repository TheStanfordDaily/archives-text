## 'Carefree' Clark battles back Despite injuries, decathlete stars 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
The sports greats make their
success look effortless. Michael
Jordan's dunks look like perfectly
choreographed moves. Ken Grif
fey, Jr., stroking a baseball over
the left field fence seems so sim
ple, so predetermined. Carl Lewis
soaring in the long jump resem
bles an eagle taking flight, peace
ful and majestic as if he always
belonged in midair.
Over the last four years, senior
Travis Clark has brought those
same aesthetics to the track.
Watching Clark run on the stadi
um oval is like watching a well
groomed thoroughbred race at
the Preakness. There is no wasted
motion, just a fluid movement
that propels him along the track.
In his best event, the high jump,
Clark combines his many skills.
On the runway he approaches in a
finely tuned arc to the standards.
Jumping, he compresses his 6-
foot-3-inch frame and launches
off his right foot, guiding his body
over the bar and into the welcom
ing cushions on the other side.
In his first two years, Clark
was satisfied with high jumping
and running several 400-meter
races. Last year, coach Mark Reiff
on the advice of head coach Vin
Lananna, began training Clark
for the decathlon, one of the most

grueling events in track and field.
"He became a decathlete from
the moment I showed up," ReifT
said. "I told him he was going to
have a miserable time, training
for 10 events instead of two. And
he didn't balk at it — he decided
to take the challenge."
If anyone could succeed in the
pressure of the 10-event contest,
it was Travis Clark.
"I wanted to do something
new," Clark said. "I wanted a dif
ferent role on the track team. No
one was doing [the decathlon],
and I thought it would be fun."
"Travis is kind of new to the
whole thing so he doesn't expect
too much," said freshman Josh
Gleason, who trains with Clark in
the decathlon.
At last year's Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships, Clark
won the decathlon with 6,982
points in only his second competi
tion. Last weekend, Clark and
Gleason went to Tucson, Ariz.,
for the Pac-10 decathlon, the first
event of the conference champi
onships. Clark finished the first
day in second place and after the
second day finished in sixth over
all. Even though he didn't win
this year's decathlon, he did score
300 points more than last year. In
the process, Clark won the 400
meters, the 1,500 meters and the
