## 'Carefree' Clark battles back Despite injuries, decathlete stars 
### Matthew Lawrence Contributing writer 
The sports greats make their
success look effortless. Michael
Jordan's dunks look like perfectly
choreographed moves. Ken Grif
fey, Jr., stroking a baseball over
the left field fence seems so sim
ple, so predetermined. Carl Lewis
soaring in the long jump resem
bles an eagle taking flight, peace
ful and majestic as if he always
belonged in midair.
Over the last four years, senior
Travis Clark has brought those
same aesthetics to the track.
Watching Clark run on the stadi
um oval is like watching a well
groomed thoroughbred race at
the Preakness. There is no wasted
motion, just a fluid movement
that propels him along the track.
In his best event, the high jump,
Clark combines his many skills.
On the runway he approaches in a
finely tuned arc to the standards.
Jumping, he compresses his 6-
foot-3-inch frame and launches
off his right foot, guiding his body
over the bar and into the welcom
ing cushions on the other side.
In his first two years, Clark
was satisfied with high jumping
and running several 400-meter
races. Last year, coach Mark Reiff
on the advice of head coach Vin
Lananna, began training Clark
for the decathlon, one of the most

grueling events in track and field.
"He became a decathlete from
the moment I showed up," ReifT
said. "I told him he was going to
have a miserable time, training
for 10 events instead of two. And
he didn't balk at it — he decided
to take the challenge."
If anyone could succeed in the
pressure of the 10-event contest,
it was Travis Clark.
"I wanted to do something
new," Clark said. "I wanted a dif
ferent role on the track team. No
one was doing [the decathlon],
and I thought it would be fun."
"Travis is kind of new to the
whole thing so he doesn't expect
too much," said freshman Josh
Gleason, who trains with Clark in
the decathlon.
At last year's Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships, Clark
won the decathlon with 6,982
points in only his second competi
tion. Last weekend, Clark and
Gleason went to Tucson, Ariz.,
for the Pac-10 decathlon, the first
event of the conference champi
onships. Clark finished the first
day in second place and after the
second day finished in sixth over
all. Even though he didn't win
this year's decathlon, he did score
300 points more than last year. In
the process, Clark won the 400
meters, the 1,500 meters and the

high jump.
A hip-flexor injury prevented
Gleason from completing the
decathlon, but Gleason brings with
him the experience of competing in
numerous decathlons. Clark and
Gleason have trained together for
the decathlon over the last few
months.
Perhaps the most incredible
aspect of Clark's success this year
is his overcoming a herniated disc
from training last summer. Clark
missed the entire fall and winter
conditioning and practice for this
year's spring track season. He has
been training since Feb. 1, and in
only three months he managed to
take sixth at the Pac-lOs.
"There were several times this
year we felt he might not be able to
run, let alone compete in the
decathlon," ReifT said.
Reiff explains that Clark
worked hard and made himself
ready to compete. "There are few
people on this campus who put in
as many hours as Travis," Reiff
said.

"He has such a positive outlook
even when he's competing. Com
peting with him makes me so
much more relaxed," Gleason said.
"I talked to Coach Reiff and he told
me to be more like Travis."
Gleason describes Clark as the
"essence of Missouri."
"I always kid him about being
from Missouri. You picture Mis
souri people drinking a beer with a
piece of hay in their mouth," Glea
son said. "I think he has a carefree
attitude to life. He says he's going
to give it his all and just let the
chips fall where they will.
"The way decathletes are is
buddy-buddy no matter where
they are. You're not competing
against other people; you're com
peting against the point table."
It all started with the high jump
and a lot of speed. Former coach
Brooks Johnson recruited Clark
from Cape Central High School in
Cape Girardeau, Mo., on the
strength of his high jumping and
speed on the track. Clark has
jumped 7-foot-3, and he is one of
the fastest 400-meter runners on
the team.
This year Clark enjoyed the
variation of different events at dif
ferent meets. In addition to run

ning the open 400 meters, the 4 x
400-meter relay and the high
jump, Clark also competed in the
javelin and pole vault.
"He definitely feeds on emotion.
I get the feeling that nothing fazes
him," Gleason said.
Clark is certainly one of the
most personable people on the
track team. He lets his perfor
mance speak for itself; he doesn't
draw attention to himself like so
many self-promoting athletes. It is
his reticence, his demureness that
separate Clark from the crowd.
Like the famous Dan O'Brien and
Dave Johnson from the 1992
Olympics, Clark relies on his suc
cess to make a statement.
His 7,287-point score in Tuc&in
was an NCAA provisional qualify
ing mark, and if Clark gets the
invitation to the nationals, he will
be ready to go.
"If I get to go it will be great,
just going will be fun. I'd like to be
in the top eight so I can get an All -
American spot."
Not only is Clark a talented ath
lete able to learn the 10 events of
the decathlon in less than a year,
he carries his impressive style to
the classroom. The past two years
Clark, a biology major, was an Aca

demic All-Pac-10 Team selection.
Next year Clark heads to Van
derbilt medical school. He decided
on Vanderbilt because Tennessee
is closer to home and closer to the
Midwest, Clark's heartland.
"Even if I was totally healthy
and I went to nationals, I would
want to go right into medical
school, get a real job, and get on
with my life," Clark said.
After medical school, he aims to
have a medical practice in a small
town somewhere in the Midwest.
"I don't want to be in a big city
or on the coast," Clark said. "For
me I just couldn't do that."
Clark excels at all he does, ath
letics and academics. He focuses
on the future of the Stanford track
and field program with the hope
that the classes after him will
make the Cardinal even better. In
many ways Clark's calling to
medicine is fitting. On the team,
he quietly makes everyone else
better with his athletic abilities,
similar to a doctor using the skills
of many years to make a patient
better.
"He's dreading the day his ath
letic career comes to an end, but he
realizes that he has to move on,"
Gleason said.
