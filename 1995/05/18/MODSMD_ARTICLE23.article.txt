# Goldstein upset; Salzenstein, Humphries win
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
Jeff Salzenstein, Scott Humphries and
Paul Goldstein. You just won the NCAA
Men's Tennis Team Championship in
Athens, Ga., and in the process led your team
to a perfect 27-0 finish in 1995 dual-match
play. So what are you going to do next?
Compete in the first round of the NCAA
Individuals Championship the following day,
that's what.
Yesterday at Henry Feild Stadium at Geor
gia, three members of the Cardinal's just

crowned national champions were asked to
come out and compete for something that
nobody would have trouble motivating for,
unless they had just completed a dream season
on a scale of the undefeated 1995 Cardinal.
Salzenstein and Humphries responded
well, winning their matches in straight sets.
But No. 41 Goldstein fell in a first-round
upset to No. 61 Fredric Niemayer of Middle
Tennessee State, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. After dropping
only 16 games during his four previous team
matches in Athens, the Cardinal freshman
was unable to avoid the letdown.
"I was pretty drained from the whole

week. I didn't have any focus for the match,"
Goldstein said.
No. 6 Salzenstein defeated No. 42 Tad
Berkowitz of New Mexico 6-2, 6-3. No. 10
Humphries also came out on fire, topping No.
51 Antonio Prieto of Florida State 6-4, 6-3.
Up next for Salzenstein is a round-of-32
match against Marc Bauer of Colorado.
Humphries will meet Enrique Abaroa of
Kansas.
In doubles today, the second-ranked tan
dem of Humphries and Goldstein will face
No. 25 Mike Isroff and Reid Slattery of
Kansas.
