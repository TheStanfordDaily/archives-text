## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Malibu may be a great tourist
attraction, but yesterday only the
load star enjoyed the surroundings.
Two of Stanford's three partici
pants at the NCAA Women's Sin

gles Championships were easily
upset yesterday, but freshman Ania
Bleszynski of nearby Thousand
Oaks, Calif., fought to a three-set
victory to advance to the next
round.
No. 19 Bleszynski drew a weaker
opponent than sophomore Katie

Schlukebir or senior Kim Shasby,
facing No. 96 Paige Yaroshuk of
UCLA. The feisty Yaroshuk won a
set, taking the middle set 6-4 after
dropping the first 6-2. But Bleszyn
ski put the foot down in the rubber
set, dropping just one game.
"It felt good to win my first

round match in the NCAA tourna
ment," Bleszynski said. "It's also
nice to play in this area, so close to
home. It helped that I played her
before, because I feel that I can play
better the second time around."
No. 13 Schlukebir, the Cardi
nal's top player, and No. 20 Shasby
were not so fortunate. No. 49 Lori
Sowell of Florida State met
Schlukebir in a tough early match
and started well, taking the first
three games.
Schlukebir battled back to take
the next four games and appeared
to have established control of the
match. But Sowell went on take the
final three games of the set and
only lost once in the second set.
Shasby fell by an identical 6-4,
6-1 score to Arizona's Stephanie
Sammaritano. Each player held
serve until the ninth game, when
Sammaritano took the lead for the
first time. She held to take the first
set and then broke Shasby to open
the second set. Shasby held serve
to cut the deficit to 2-1, but Sam
maritano did not lose another
game.
Despite yesterday's setbacks all
three Cardinal players will be back
on the court this afternoon at 12:30
p.m. for the opening round of dou
bles competition. After taking on
No. 44 Marianne Vallin of UNLV at
9 a.m. in a second-round singles
match, Bleszynski will join
Schlukebir as the No. 10 doubles
tandem takes on No. 20 Michelle O
and Johanna Sones of William and
Mary.
Shasby and sophomore Emily
Burt will put their No. 41 doubles
ranking on the line against No. 39
Manisha Malhotra and Melissa
Zimpfer of Tennessee.
