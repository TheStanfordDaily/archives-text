# Golfers head to Regionals
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
As the reigning national champion, the
Stanford men's golf team is aching for a chance
to defend its title. And now, just one more
obstacle blocks the squad from that opportuni
ty.
The second-ranked Cardinal faces off
against the best in the West at the NCAA
Regional Championships in Albuquerque, N.M.
The three-round competition, which begins
today, will serve as the proving ground for the
18-team field. Stanford must finish in the top
nine to advance to the NCAA championships in
Columbus, Ohio.
"We're not thinking about defending the
title right now," said head coach Wally Good
win. "We're only concerned with the task at
hand. The low nine make the cut, but we're
aiming for number one."
The Cardinal will be sporting a new look this
week, however. Freshman Tiger Woods
returns from an injury to his right shoulder
that forced him to withdraw from one tourna
ment and skip another. In addition, senior
Jeriy Chang will be replacing senior All-Amer
ican Steve Burdick as the No. 5 player on the
squad.
Burdick, a force in previous years, has had
difficulty in controlling his driver this season
and has been unable to maintain his game at
any level of consistency.
Chang has played only twice this season
with the traveling team and has not competed
regularly on the varsity since his sophomore
year. However, the lack of experience seems to
be bothering him very little. In his limited
opportunities, he has delivered, most notably
in the conference championships where he
placed among the top two on the
team and the top 20 in the field.
"Jerry has clearly been playing
well," Goodwin said. "I'm hopeful
that he'll carry on his good play
this week. A solid performance by
him could really put us in good
position."
Goodwin only hopes that his
team is in better position than they
were two weeks ago at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships.
Stanford performed abysmally,
tying the squad's worst finish of
the year by placing eighth against
many of the teams that the Cardi
nal will face again this week.
"We definitely didn't perform as
well as we would have liked,"
Goodwin said. "We were playing
without Tiger though and that cost
us a good 25 shots. The morale was
probably a bit lower without one of
the guys too. The whole thing just
made a huge difference."
While few doubt that the Cardi
nal will move on to the champi
onships, there are questions as to
just how easily the team will move

through the postseason.
At one point in the season, the
squad was firmly established as the
top team in the nation and des
tined to run away with the title.
However, several head-to-head
losses to No. 1 Oklahoma State and
recent mediocre outings have left
people wondering whether Stan
ford is even the second-best team.
"Golf is a strange game," Good
win said. "Every tournament is
always up for grabs. For anyone to
say that a team can just win at will
is wrong. I feel like we are as tal
ented as anyone, but there's a lot of
luck involved too."
Stanford will need all the luck it
can muster to defeat a red-hot Ari
zona State team. While the highly
competitive field features several
top 20 squads, including No. 5
Nevada- Las Vegas, No. 13 Arizona
and No 19 New Mexico, the ninth
ranked Sun Devils should prove to
be the Cardinal's toughest foe, hav
ing beaten Stanford twice in the
last three tournaments.
"We have as good a chance as
anybody." Goodwin said. "We just
need to go out and worry about
playing our best because at this
point in the season, if you don't
play well, you don't play again."
