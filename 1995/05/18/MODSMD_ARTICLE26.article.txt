# Move over, Dave — Kyle comes up with his own Top Ten list
## Four glory years of Stanford memories 
### 
As June approaches and the
Class of 1995 nears gradua
tion, I thought I'd take a
look back at what I remember
most about the past four years in
Stanford sports. Such a list would
of course include the 18 NCAA
team titles won by the Cardinal
since the 1991-92 school year,
countless conference champi
onships, incredible victories and
outstanding individual perfor
mances. I got to watch Stanford
athletes strut their stuff at the
Olympics in Barcelona and saw
many future professional athletes
compete for the Cardinal as well
as its competition.

Because there are so many
great moments, I'll limit this col
umn to the 10 most memorable
events that I was fortunate
enough to attend live and in per
son. They are, in no particular
order:
• The raucous crowd of 6,427
at Maples Pavillion to watch No. 1
Tennessee take on the No. 9 Car
dinal women's basketball team in
December 1993. The crowd
couldn't overcome the Lady Vols,
who won 81-75.
• The 1992 Pigskin Classic
football game vs. Texas A&M at
Anaheim Stadium. We had 'em
until the no-call on a pass inter
ference play set up the Aggies'
winning drive late in the game.
• Sitting about two feet from
the court at the Stanford vs. USC
men's basketball game at Maples,
1993. Harold Miner checking out
the dollies during every timeout.
• Men's water polo NCAA
championships in Long Beach,

Calif., 1993 and 1994. In '93 the
Cardinal overcame a late-season
slump to capture the title, while
in '94 Stanford capped off a dom
inant year by repeating as
champs.
• Big Game 1991, Stanford
Stadium. "Touchdown" Tommy
Vardell ran straight at the Cal
defensive line and pounded them
for 182 yards and three touch
downs in the Cardinal's 38-21 vic
tory.
• Men's basketball vs. No. 7
Arizona at Maples, 1992. With
Adam Keefe about to seal the
game at the free-throw line,
Brent Williams was called for a
lane violation and Khalid Reeves
took the ball full-court to score
the winning basket as time
expired.
• 1994 NCAA men's swimming
championships, Minneapolis,
Minn. The Cardinal outlasted its
competition over the three-day
meet, claiming its third consecu
tive NCAA crown. Stanford
amassed five individual, three
relay titles and two American
records.
• Big Game 1992, Memorial
Stadium. Glyn Milbum returning
a punt down the right sideline,
right at us, to seal a 41-21 Stan
ford victory, the last time we've
had the Axe. (Also, some Cal stu
dent having the balls to steal the
flag from flagboy.)
• Listening to the 1992
Women's Final Four semifinal vs.
Virginia on the radio. (Not really
live, but we were at a Stanford
softball game across the street at
the time.) The Cardinal went on
to defeat Western Kentucky the
next day to capture the NCAA
championship.
• Going out to watch the
women's lacrosse team for my
first assignment for The Stanford
Daily three years ago. Talk about
clueless reporting. ...

Kyle isn't ready to leave Stanford
yet, and will return to The Daily
next year as a redshirt senior.
