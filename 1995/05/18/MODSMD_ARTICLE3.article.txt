# Profs call new car tariff damaging
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Stanford economists and international
trade specialists said yesterday that the
Clinton Administration's plan to slap 100
percent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars is
economically counterproductive and an
act of political pandering.
"It's unfortunate," said Economics
Prof. Masahiko Aoki. "I think |U.S. Trade
Representative Mickey] Kantor is a good
lawyer who has no grasp of economics."
"I think it's a bad policy. It's not even
clear what the US is asking for," agreed
Economics Prof. John Taylor. "It's very
unusual for a country to demand specific
numerical targets for trade."
Senior Hoover Fellow Melvyn Krauss, a

trade economist, bluntly called the plan "a
misguided attempt by the Clinton admin
istration to buy votes in Detroit and the
Midwest."
"It's the consumers who are the ones
who will pay and pay dearly," Krauss said.
Top Stanford economists agree that
while the trade deficit remains high, puni
tive tariffs are not the solution to the prob
lem. The Japanese trade deficit is caused
mainly by structural differences between
the U.S. and Japanese economies, they
said, and any attempt to change it with
forced quota agreements would be difficult
if not impossible.
"From the information I've seen, even
if the Japanese were to concede to the US,
there is little evidence that anything much
can be done to open up the Japanese auto

parts market," said Economics Prof. Anne
Krueger. "It's like saying that the Aus
tralians aren't buying enough American
wheat when Australia is a major wheat ex
porter."
"The gap between savings and con
sumption in the US is too high. Savings are
insufficient to cover all the investments
made," Taylor said. "Until those problems
are addressed, Japan's large trade sur
pluses will continue to persist.'-'
Professors agreed that the tariffs were
imposed to make the administration ap
pear tough on the immense Japanese trade
deficit.
"It's a pretty risky move," said Senior
Hoover Fellow John Ferejohn. "I'm not
