# Profs call new car tariff damaging
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Stanford economists and international
trade specialists said yesterday that the
Clinton Administration's plan to slap 100
percent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars is
economically counterproductive and an
act of political pandering.
"It's unfortunate," said Economics
Prof. Masahiko Aoki. "I think |U.S. Trade
Representative Mickey] Kantor is a good
lawyer who has no grasp of economics."
"I think it's a bad policy. It's not even
clear what the US is asking for," agreed
Economics Prof. John Taylor. "It's very
unusual for a country to demand specific
numerical targets for trade."
Senior Hoover Fellow Melvyn Krauss, a

trade economist, bluntly called the plan "a
misguided attempt by the Clinton admin
istration to buy votes in Detroit and the
Midwest."
"It's the consumers who are the ones
who will pay and pay dearly," Krauss said.
Top Stanford economists agree that
while the trade deficit remains high, puni
tive tariffs are not the solution to the prob
lem. The Japanese trade deficit is caused
mainly by structural differences between
the U.S. and Japanese economies, they
said, and any attempt to change it with
forced quota agreements would be difficult
if not impossible.
"From the information I've seen, even
if the Japanese were to concede to the US,
there is little evidence that anything much
can be done to open up the Japanese auto

parts market," said Economics Prof. Anne
Krueger. "It's like saying that the Aus
tralians aren't buying enough American
wheat when Australia is a major wheat ex
porter."
"The gap between savings and con
sumption in the US is too high. Savings are
insufficient to cover all the investments
made," Taylor said. "Until those problems
are addressed, Japan's large trade sur
pluses will continue to persist.'-'
Professors agreed that the tariffs were
imposed to make the administration ap
pear tough on the immense Japanese trade
deficit.
"It's a pretty risky move," said Senior
Hoover Fellow John Ferejohn. "I'm not
sure there will be a resolution."
"Once the administration start
ed down this road ... they don't
have any particular way of getting
off it," Krueger said. "The
Japanese have been burned before
and they are under internal pres
sure not to give into U.S.
demands," she said.
Aoki said that not only were the
sanctions misguided, but that they
would backfire on the United
States.
"It's not like China where the
bluff' of sanctions caused them to
act on blatant intellectual property
rights violations," Aoki said. "The
bluff is not going to work for
Japan."
Krauss and Aoki said that they
believed the administration was
deliberately manipulating world
trade issues for its benefit.
"Detroit has already benefited
from the slide of the yen," Krauss
said. "They've already raised prices
once this year — even though sales
have fallen — and I expect with a
protective tariff shielding them,
they will raise prices again.
"But it's going to backfire com
pletely on Clinton," Krauss contin
ued. "Detroit doesn't recognize
Clinton's help. He's not going to get
any credit for it."
"There is definite political pres
sure behind this move," Aoki said.
"Kantor relies on the government
to dictate to business, contradicto
ry to free market forces. I expect he
will resign as trade representative
soon to take over Clinton's re-elec
tion campaign."
