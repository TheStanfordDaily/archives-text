# Queensrijche's new work arrives at the 'Promised Land'
## 
### Michael Q. Nichols 
i I hen Queensryche released its fifth
I A F album, "Empire," its cultish follow-
Ww ing rose to millions. By the time
"Empire" hit the triple platinum mark, they
were headlining a world tour — a blessing
which turned out both to be a success too great
to imagine and too great to bear.
In the wake of their popularity, Queen
sryche took a four-year hiatus. Media coverage
overemphasized this period of self-examina
tion by a group which has always been an out
spoken critic of the great capitalist corporate
conspiracy.
In an interview with guitarist Michael
Wilton, many facets of the creation of Queen
sryche's new album "Promised Land" were

uncovered.
"Time off as members
ol Queensryche was im
portant in our view,"
Wilton said matter-of
factly about the band's
respite. "We needed to dis
cover again what it was to
be human beings in every
day life. We had to sepa
rate the two realities.
"It's hard to explain. It is
as if you are climbing a
mountain of achieving
goals and you get to the top
of the mountain, and there
is still an emptiness and the
place is very lonely." It is
this reflection that makes
up the underlying theme
of "Promised Land."
Rather than developing
a collection of songs,
Queensryche authors en
tire albums, imbueing its
work with meaning that
outstrips listeners' expec
tations. "Promised Land"
is a carefully-crafted effort
that increasingly intrigues
its listener.
Queensryche devoted
meticulous care to this
album. Its symbolism be
gins on the cover, a totem
pole portraying three fig
ures representing the three
stages of a man's life.
According to Wilton,
"For us it was a timeline
in our history. The pole is
placed in a lake where the
reflection of the water is a
symbolic reflection upon
what h. 1 gotten us to this
album, this promised
land."
But because the reality
and expectations of suc
cess differed for the band,

the music on this album turns quite dark.
"We're not too much into the Hollywood
ending. There's too much of that around
today anyway," Wilton mused when asked
whether this will effect the band's popularity.
While he admits that "this album makes 'Op
eration: Mindcrime' seem happy," the new
music is not self-absorbed in a 'pity-me' way
— rather, it is a serious inquiry into identity,
the meaning of an individual's work, and the
difference between substance and appearance.
An immense two-year project, the multi
layered sounds of "Promised Land" are so
dense that Wilton characterizes the album as

"a wall of sound." But this weight makes the
material dynamic. With intense use of half
hidden, maniacal voices, sampling and count
less effects, the music takes on a life of its own,
painting a complex and ever-evolving visual
picture.
Written in a time of crisis for vocalist and
keyboardist Geoff Tate and guitarist Chris De-
Garmo, "Promised Land" is the most naked
form of therapy— revealing to the world what
it is like to balance self-percept ion in the face
of immense success..
Having surmounted this crisis of self-in
tegrity, however, the band feels very much
"past point where it was created — now it's
almost kind of an enigma. What we were

writing about, in a sense, we're now doing.
We're out here promoting the big machine
and are part of the capitalist wheel, but we're
happy," Wilton said.
The members of Queensryche now feel
they know why they are making music again,
and this understanding is indicative of true
artistic maturation. With lyrics like "(psy
choanalyze the chapters / on the path to my
darkest day. / Searching for the answers, / all
I sec is damage through the haze," their new
direction inspires self-analysis. This album is
like the artist who first ventures to show the
world itself through the acts of others, and

now strives to see himself honestly and reveal
to others what he has become.
"Promised Land" reveals truths about the
human condition in a world that cares more
for information than connection, more for the
surface than the substance.
The album differs from the group's past
work. Where "Rage for Order" was an inquiry
into chaos, "Mindcrime" a fantasy of the cor
rupt socio-political system and "Empire" a dis
enchanted vision of the modern Gotham City,
"Promised Land" is a trip into Tate's psyche.
With such overarching themes, it is easy to
see how the band's concept-album writing
style creates more of a movie than an album.
"All our material is very visually oriented

from its conception," Wilton said. "When we
write we have images in mind and the lyrics
complement the music and music comple
ments the lyrics in accord with these images."
The band's current tour reflects this belief;
it's a performance as much as a concert. The
use of video footage, set changes, on-stage
props and lighting are said to be on par with
Pink Floyd.
According to Wilton, the show "becomes a
very visually stimulating at some points with a
lot of cynical overtones that one has to ab
sorb." Fhus the concert, like Queensryche's
music, calls on us to think until the end.

The intrigue of visual stimulation and
movie-making inspired the band to produce a
unique CD-ROM based on their new album.
"We wanted to make (things) more reflec
tive of our personalities," Wilton said enthusi
astically. "There are five individual island
[around you| that reflect [the psyche of] each
band member. Within each of these five
worlds it is inevitable that the user will trip
ecological disaster. The goal is, of course, to fix
these disasters and collect totem pieces that
wi11... lead you to a point were you are taken
to a special place and we perform a previous!)
unreleased track."
With several levels of gaming, a soundscapt
written by Queensryche and nearly 100 min-

utes of video, this
double-disc project is
no game of Pong.
Wilton estimates it
will take a novice CD
ROM player any
where up to six
months to reach the
end. "This is a maze of
twisted imagery," said
Wilton with excite
ment, "one that
promises to be a land
all its own when re
leased this summer.'
ueensryche's
£ long and in
triguing jour
ney is the maturation
of a band that began
without a name when
their first EP went to
press in 1983 (they
chose one based on a
song called "Queen ot
the Ryche").
Art istically,
Queensryche has
evolved from playing
precision metal to cre
ating a totally unique
sound. Musical ex
pansion has come in
the form of sounds, ef
fects and conversa
tional samples, as well
as the addition of new
instruments. On
"Promised Land," Tate
plays the saxophone.
"Although it's a lit
tle tough to digest tor
the purists," Wilton
notes, "you have to
make things interest
ing for the musicians."
Just as "Promised
Land" ends with Tate

solo on piano, Queen
sryche has found its element with this album.
With "Promised Land," Queensryche
reached the edge of a crossroads, but instead of
hiding this fact, the group has chosen to share
this epic journey.

which turned out both to be a success too great
to imagine and too great to bear.
In the wake of their popularity, Queen
sryche took a four-year hiatus. Media coverage
overemphasized this period of self-examina
tion by a group which has always been an out
spoken critic of the great capitalist corporate
conspiracy.
In an interview with guitarist Michael
Wilton, many facets of the creation of Queen
sryche's new album "Promised Land" were

uncovered.
"Time off as members
ol Queensryche was im
portant in our view,"
Wilton said matter-of
factly about the band's
respite. "We needed to dis
cover again what it was to
be human beings in every
day life. We had to sepa
rate the two realities.
"It's hard to explain. It is
as if you are climbing a
mountain of achieving
goals and you get to the top
of the mountain, and there
is still an emptiness and the
place is very lonely." It is
this reflection that makes
up the underlying theme
of "Promised Land."
Rather than developing
a collection of songs,
Queensryche authors en
tire albums, imbueing its
work with meaning that
outstrips listeners' expec
tations. "Promised Land"
is a carefully-crafted effort
that increasingly intrigues
its listener.
Queensryche devoted
meticulous care to this
album. Its symbolism be
gins on the cover, a totem
pole portraying three fig
ures representing the three
stages of a man's life.
According to Wilton,
"For us it was a timeline
in our history. The pole is
placed in a lake where the
reflection of the water is a
symbolic reflection upon
what h. 1 gotten us to this
album, this promised
land."
But because the reality
and expectations of suc
cess differed for the band,

the music on this album turns quite dark.
"We're not too much into the Hollywood
ending. There's too much of that around
today anyway," Wilton mused when asked
whether this will effect the band's popularity.
While he admits that "this album makes 'Op
eration: Mindcrime' seem happy," the new
music is not self-absorbed in a 'pity-me' way
— rather, it is a serious inquiry into identity,
the meaning of an individual's work, and the
difference between substance and appearance.
An immense two-year project, the multi
layered sounds of "Promised Land" are so
dense that Wilton characterizes the album as

"a wall of sound." But this weight makes the
material dynamic. With intense use of half
hidden, maniacal voices, sampling and count
less effects, the music takes on a life of its own,
painting a complex and ever-evolving visual
picture.
Written in a time of crisis for vocalist and
keyboardist Geoff Tate and guitarist Chris De-
Garmo, "Promised Land" is the most naked
form of therapy— revealing to the world what
it is like to balance self-percept ion in the face
of immense success..
Having surmounted this crisis of self-in
tegrity, however, the band feels very much
"past point where it was created — now it's
almost kind of an enigma. What we were

writing about, in a sense, we're now doing.
We're out here promoting the big machine
and are part of the capitalist wheel, but we're
happy," Wilton said.
The members of Queensryche now feel
they know why they are making music again,
and this understanding is indicative of true
artistic maturation. With lyrics like "(psy
choanalyze the chapters / on the path to my
darkest day. / Searching for the answers, / all
I sec is damage through the haze," their new
direction inspires self-analysis. This album is
like the artist who first ventures to show the
world itself through the acts of others, and

now strives to see himself honestly and reveal
to others what he has become.
"Promised Land" reveals truths about the
human condition in a world that cares more
for information than connection, more for the
surface than the substance.
The album differs from the group's past
work. Where "Rage for Order" was an inquiry
into chaos, "Mindcrime" a fantasy of the cor
rupt socio-political system and "Empire" a dis
enchanted vision of the modern Gotham City,
"Promised Land" is a trip into Tate's psyche.
With such overarching themes, it is easy to
see how the band's concept-album writing
style creates more of a movie than an album.
"All our material is very visually oriented

from its conception," Wilton said. "When we
write we have images in mind and the lyrics
complement the music and music comple
ments the lyrics in accord with these images."
The band's current tour reflects this belief;
it's a performance as much as a concert. The
use of video footage, set changes, on-stage
props and lighting are said to be on par with
Pink Floyd.
According to Wilton, the show "becomes a
very visually stimulating at some points with a
lot of cynical overtones that one has to ab
sorb." Fhus the concert, like Queensryche's
music, calls on us to think until the end.

The intrigue of visual stimulation and
movie-making inspired the band to produce a
unique CD-ROM based on their new album.
"We wanted to make (things) more reflec
tive of our personalities," Wilton said enthusi
astically. "There are five individual island
[around you| that reflect [the psyche of] each
band member. Within each of these five
worlds it is inevitable that the user will trip
ecological disaster. The goal is, of course, to fix
these disasters and collect totem pieces that
wi11... lead you to a point were you are taken
to a special place and we perform a previous!)
unreleased track."
With several levels of gaming, a soundscapt
written by Queensryche and nearly 100 min-

utes of video, this
double-disc project is
no game of Pong.
Wilton estimates it
will take a novice CD
ROM player any
where up to six
months to reach the
end. "This is a maze of
twisted imagery," said
Wilton with excite
ment, "one that
promises to be a land
all its own when re
leased this summer.'
ueensryche's
£ long and in
triguing jour
ney is the maturation
of a band that began
without a name when
their first EP went to
press in 1983 (they
chose one based on a
song called "Queen ot
the Ryche").
Art istically,
Queensryche has
evolved from playing
precision metal to cre
ating a totally unique
sound. Musical ex
pansion has come in
the form of sounds, ef
fects and conversa
tional samples, as well
as the addition of new
instruments. On
"Promised Land," Tate
plays the saxophone.
"Although it's a lit
tle tough to digest tor
the purists," Wilton
notes, "you have to
make things interest
ing for the musicians."
Just as "Promised
Land" ends with Tate

solo on piano, Queen
sryche has found its element with this album.
With "Promised Land," Queensryche
reached the edge of a crossroads, but instead of
hiding this fact, the group has chosen to share
this epic journey.
