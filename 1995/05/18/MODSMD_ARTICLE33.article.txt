t's a relatively odious and misogynistic play, to
V perfectly honest." Drama grad student
Kirstie Gulick ain't afraid to admit it. Her lat
est directorial project tackles a play that would make even a
tube topped Pamela Anderson convulse with pro-femi
power angst.
"The Taming of the Shrew" (who the culturally literate
can refer to as the only Shakespeare play to ever grace
"Moonlighting") outlines the fall of Kate, a once bra/en
woman. Degenerating faster than Charles Schultz's sense of
comic strip humor, Kate falls from autonomous femme vi
taleto cringing bimbo. Once a stand-alone woman of caus
tic wit, she is literally beaten down into a weak-willed wait
who, in her final monologue, would promise to suck the ver
min out of her husband's navel.
Despite the repugnant theme of this work, Gulick was
driven to direct a Stanford production of"The Taming of the
Shrew" for her third year show. Instead of reviling the play
for its misogynistic comedy, Gulick sees the project asa com
pelling challenge: an opportunity to expose the relationship
between Shakespeare's famed comedy and complex issues of
male perspective and female representation in the media.
"It's easy to take 'Taming of the Shrew' as a demonstra
tion of how evil the Renaissance was to women. It's also easy
to put it on and let the audience have fun and laugh at the
abuse," Gulick said. "I want people to think about this text.
Deeply. Both its negatives and its positives. 1 believe it offers
more besides laughing at the abuse of women."
Gulick consequently modernized the play in unique fash
ion by setting it in the context of a '50s sitcom.

The depiction of Kate's fall is strikingly tragic. As Kate is
beaten into submission, audiences have, strangely enough,
been tickled fuschia by such brutal coercion.
Which leads to the inevitable question: "Why do we con
done such misogyny?" In exploring answers to that ques
tion, Gulick was compelled to direct "Shrew."
Following the advice of a colleague, Gulick exposed her
self to other examples of female domestication in '50s sitcom
television. Watching Palmolive-soaked and Masengil-in
jected women serve Salisbury Steaks to their hubbies as they
vacantly smile into the camera, Gulick was inspired to su
perimpose these saccharine sweet images onto quippy
Sha kespea rea n d ialogue.
With San Francisco-based designer John Wilson, Gulick
established the play's production values which she describes
as a " 1950s collage male fantasy." As retro as Lawrence Welk
on a Sweet and Low high, the set is replete with vintage TV
icons: a smattering of Lucille Ball, a hint of vinyl, a splash of
Ozzie and Harriet and a slew of black and white pics of
women with Max Factored faces.

"The Taming of the Shrew" is a play within a play, some
what like "ABC's Saturday Morning Special" if you count the
O.G. Readmore gags.
Unlike many directors of past productions of "Shrew,"
Gulick decided to keep the induction, a two scene introduc
tion to the play in which the audience meets Sly the drunk,
the character to whom Kate's story is being told. Gulick said
that "Shrew" is more than just a play about Kate's transfor
mation, but an important element of the play. "Taming of
the Shrew" is a play about the frame of watching, about the
male world watching and ogling and leering and making
goo-goo eyes at Kates and Biancas, according to Gulick.
To emphasize her point, she not only keeps the original
induction scenes, she has Sly remaining "on stage" for the
duration of the comedy in a naugahyde LZ-Boy stationed on
a platform in the audience. Throughout the performance,
Sly, like Archie Bunker sitting in on some "Mystery Science
Theater" cinemania, hurls multi-syllabic spew at the women
on view before him.
(Hulick believes that there is a strong parallel between the
idealized domestication of women in '50s sitcoms and Kate's
eventual submission.
"Both are idealized images of women.... Gross misrep
resentations idealized to make people feel calm and
smooth," Gulick said.
Like a Valium and Nair cocktail.
©ulick ripped "The Taming of the Shrew" out of its
Renaissance womb and threw it into the Cuisinart
along with some Donna Reed reruns. The result is
an intriguing, visually appealing and über-stimulating hy
brid.
But, what's the point?
Gulick admits she hadn't set out to do feminist Shake
speare nor was she out to tickle our funny bones. Instead,
Gulick intended to create something altogether unique.
William Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew" was writ
ten to make you laugh. Sly, drooling on his naugahyde
throne from comic spasms, joins the audience-generated
laugh track with his incessant guffaws.
But Gulick's "Shrew" aims to make the audience realize
the peculiar irony of such laughter. And that's enough to
shut that Sly-kid up.
