# Life's a bitch at ’Waverly’s’

There is one question that people have
been asking the director of the play
"Waverlys Gay Art Colony," one that
they probably shouldn't ask.
"Everyone asks me, 'Is the cast gay?' as it that
were really relevant to the show," said Akin
Salawu, who also wrote the script for the pro
duction.
"' had one little freshman girl look at the
poster and ask me who in the play was gay,
'cause she really needed to know, and I thought
it was really interesting how important it was
for her to know, so I told her everyone in the
play was a transvestite, Salawu joked.
Gay or straight, everyone in the play has
traits borrowed from characters in "Melrose
Place," the Fox television network show that
this play parodies.
"Most of the people 1 cast the way you'd cast
a soap opera, based on how pretty they were,
also if 1 wanted to work with them, also it I
thought they could dance," Salawu said.
"Those were the three most important things..
.. Looks, by the way, were by far the least im
portant thing."
Casting only became a problem when two
of the original members of the production de
cided to leave the show.
"One of the things that's been problematic
with the show is that we've been recasting like
crazy," Salawu said, who has been working 12-
hour days in publicity and rehearsals for the
show.
"We've gone through so many cast changes
that the neoole who I have staved with I the

show now are like family," Salawu said. "I've
been having so much fun with it."
But in the end, Salawu is satisfied with what
he calls the "most incredible group of people
I've ever worked with in a show." The final cast
includes Ai'da Croal, Khanh Doan, Ali Hile
man, Dena Hysell, John Lucero, Salawu, Jen
Siebel and Alexi Wright.
"Strong queer culture style"
The idea for "Waverly's Gay Art Colony"
first appeared to Salawu while taking a class in
gay / lesbian drama fall quarter.
"It seemed like most of the plays were about
gay white boys either coming out or with
AIDS, and I thought that was kind of boring,"
Salawu said. "So I wanted to do a show that fit
under the umbrella of queer drama but was not
about gay white boys with AIDS or coming
out."
Inspired by the Fox show's cult status with
in the gay and lesbian community, Salawu de
cided to make a "queer version" of it, present
ing it in the style of Madonna concerts ("The
Girlie Show") so that the play would have a
"strong queer culture style." Add references to
Shakespeare and a sexy and farcical plot, and
"Waverly" was born.
"This play has a thousand disciplines. It's
crazy," Salawu said. "This will sound a little
corny, but there are a lot of similarities between
Shakespeare and 'Melrose' and soap operas in
general, like you know, outrageous characters,
convoluted plots, lots of sex and lots of people
plotting."

Plotting, you said?
"There's a plot but I don't wanna talk about
the plot too much," Salawu said. "There's a
'Midsummer's Night's Dream' subplot, with
four lovers and the two people, Puck and
Oberon-like, who are manipulating them. The
four lovers are Aida, Alexi, John and me."
Aside from the comedy and the high camp,
there's another good reason to see the show, ac
cording to Salawu, though he won't say what it
is to avoid building up expectations too much.
"You should come to see my show because
you are going to enjoy yourself, and it contains
a lot of thines that vou wouldn't find on the

stage very frequently, and hardly ever on this
campus," Salawu said.
" 'Melrose Place' takes place in a larger
than-life world, and Madonna concerts take
place in a larger-than-life artsy world, and you
should come to our show to dance around this
larger-than-life world," Salawu concluded.
