# Grub Focus on: Thai City

rants are going to take over the world. Seri
ously. 1 lave you ever been to a major city re
cently? They are breeding faster than rabbits.
And people flock to them.
The reason? Thai food is very, very good
and, for the most part, it's affordable. Strate
gically located in Southeast Asia, Thai chets
were influenced through the ages by the culi
nary expertise ot China and Vietnam as well
as curries and spices from India. I he result is
a highly flavorful and very distinctive cuisine
that successfully combines different ingredi
ents such as chile peppers, cilantro, lemon
grass, coconut milk and peanuts. Your home
town may be next.
Of the many Thai restaurants in this area,
one of the best is Thai City, located on El
Camino Real in Palo Alto. The restaurant is
large, seating up to 100 people in one main

dining room, and is somewhat sparsely dec
orated with white lace curtains embroidered
with bamboo trees, colorful fans and pictures
of the king and queen of Thailand on the
wall.
The service is friendly and prompt. The
coolest waiter of all is a guy named Meng.
You'll know it he's waiting on you. He is one
of the few waiters in the world who, when
asked for more time to order can reply "Okay.
You have five seconds," and get away with it.
Don't waste Meng's time, however, so if he
comes to your table and you're still thinking,
here are some choices that can't fail.
For starters go for the chicken satay. Also
called "chicken on a stick" by the less erudite,
that's exactly what this is, grilled in a deli
cious peanut and chile sauce. It comes with
excellent dipping sauces — a cucumber sauce
and a different type of peanut sauce. The beef
satay is equally good.
The egg rolls, available with either pork or
vegetables, are also very tasty, but 1 recom
mend foregoing an appetizer and ordering a
soup instead, unless you are really hungry; in
that case, go for both. The two most common
Thai soups, torn yum and and torn kha are
marvelous here.
Tom yum, which comes with chicken,
beef, prawns, seafood or vegetables, is my
personal favorite. An unusual combination
of hot and sour tastes; it is flavored with chile
peppers, cilantro and lemon grass. 1 hais
consider lemon grass a healing herb, and it
certainly makes me feel better. I he flavors
blend together for a result that must be tast
ed to be fully understood. I had the vegetable
soup, stocked full with tofu, broccoli, green
beans, cabbage, baby corn, green peppers,
bamboo shoots and yummy, yummy mush

rooms.
The other soup, torn kha, comes in a close
second. Available with chicken, prawns, or
vegetables, the base is made of coconut milk,
lime juice, lemon grass and cilantro. While
this combination may sound bizarre, it tastes
spectacular.
For entrees 1 recommend kang reng, a
blend of lightly-fried tofu, carrots, green
peppers, baby corn, cabbage, celery, onions
bamboo shoots and those same mushrooms
in a light red curry made with coconut milk.
Pad thai — rice noodles stir-fried with chile
powder, egg, bean sprouts and peanuts — is
also terrific here. Other great dishes include
seafood with Thai basil and musuman curry
with beef — a red curry with coconut milk,
potatoes, tomatoes, onions and peanuts.

For dessert, the mango with sticky rice is
delightful. The rice is flavored with coconut
milk and sugar, and the mango is invariably
perfect. To drink, go for Singha, Thai beer or
Thai iced tea, which 1 don't like very much
but others swear hy.
"Thai food is like pizza and sex," my din
ner companion said accurately. "Even when
it's bad, it's good." And Thai City is far from
bad.
