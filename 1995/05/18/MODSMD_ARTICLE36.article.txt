# Beyond indie rock:
## Breaking through and breaking up the underground

Mary Lou Lord sings a
bratty ditty called "His
Indie World" that proceeds
to slag on an endless list of
college rocks best and
brightest. Between a pur
poseless self-indulgence
and a clever misperception,
the tune homogenizes
bands which have little in
common besides rhyming
names and critical acclaim.
But "indie rock" and its
fuzzed-out, smart-ass con
notations are an easy tag to
give if you re too lazy to give
a damn.
Helium is one of the
groups Lord mentions,
guilty by free association. Its
a snub to describe the Heli
um s compelling and chal
lenging narratives as merely
"indie rock." Frontperson
Mary Timony likes to think

of her stunning creations as
"folk music played with a lot
of distorted instruments,"
though she ain't encapsulate
it so easily. And if she can t,
why should we?
The Grifters were proba
bly included in the verse
that Ijord left out. Their
reckless de- / re-construc
tion of Memphis' musical
tradition has generated
some of the most powerful
ly gritty sounds in ages. The
Grifters' Dave Shouse de
scribes the band's approach
as "deceptively friendly,"
pointing to the unique ele
gance that shines through
the groups thick-skinned
rock.
So whats "indie" mean?
Maybe independence and
individuality make the point
that Lord overlooks. ■
