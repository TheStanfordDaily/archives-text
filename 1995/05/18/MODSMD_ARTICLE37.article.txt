Hut that's not hard to believe. The Grifters
have always oozed a certain dirty and unre
fined grace, a staggering beauty through their
blend of tuneful brilliance and sonic turmoil.
In the most basic terms, Dave Shouse,
Scott Taylor, Tripp Lampkins and Stan Gal
limore create an oddly appealing brand of
home-made rock 'n' roll, like a bluesier Pave
ment or a scummier Red Red Meat. But an
accurate description of The Grifters' craft has
to go beyond '90s indie-rock, since this
band's influences span the last 80 years, with
an emphasis on the rich musical history of
their hometown of Memphis, Tenn.
Living in Memphis "has made us realize
that here, people have played music for al
most a century now in a very heartfelt and
pure kind of a way," Shouse says, "without
sitting on their front porch going, 'Hey, that
song I just wrote was really good — maybe
some guy will give me a record deal.' "
Aggressively reinterpreting traditional
blues and rockabilly, The Grifters
scramble diverse musical styles from the
past and present, while still keeping them
sharp, fresh and focused. Describing the
band's sound, Shouse says, "It's hard to tell
exactly what kind of milkshake you got, be
cause there've been so many ingredients
thrown in there." Shouse's dad calls it "pop
music through a veg-o-matic," and it's a
product of the band's unique and chaotic
song-making process.
"We have three very different songwriters,
and I think the sound works on collision as
much as cohesion," Shouse says. "Maybe
Stan | the drummer] is the cohesive thing.
He's the concrete. And then the stuff we do

on top, maybe it's like a nuclear reactor with
neutrons and stuff Hying around and bang
ing into each other and releasing energy.
That's what we work off of."
The songs maintain a certain energy and
freedom through their refusal to be pinned
down. This, Shouse says, is a central part of
The drifters' approach.
"As you grow older, your tastes invariably
tend to change, one way or another," Shouse
says. "1 would like to make music that can
keep going, and maybe stay valid. Hut I don't
know. That's a lot to ask.
"The whole thing with recording is that
you're documenting a period of time," he
continues. "We document this period of
time, and then we just press it up and hand it
out, like, 'OK, here's what we felt in March of
1994 when we made this album, so grow up
with it, asshole.' That's tough to do. That's
asking a lot."
The Grifters songs typically serve up
cloudy shreds of meaning, leaving the rest to
the listener's imagination. In "Skin Man
Palace," when Shouse sings "1 am the mambo
king/wrapped tight in my tarantula skin,"
it's not supposed to make sense, but it paints
a vivid picture.
"I write very convoluted lyrics some
times," Shouse says. "That way, I don't nail
too much down, because everybody has a
different filtering system for receiving infor
mation.
"And [people| go, 'What does that really
mean?' I'm not going to tell them what it
means. It means something to them, and
they discovered it and they're happy with it,
and I'd rather leave them a little curious."
Despite the stubbornly vague lyrics, many
of the songs do show specific inspirations
and themes. The title for the Southern-fried
sci-fi track "Get Outta th.it Spaceship & I-'itiht

Like a Man," for instance, was taken from a
bathroom wall in Bozeman, Mont.
"We did a show there, and I was taking a
piss and 1 looked over and read that and I al
most pissed all over myself," Shouse says.
"That whole phrase was like 'I don't under
stand you but I will fight you.' Or 'I have to
beat up and kill what I don't understand be
cause it threatens me.' "
Shouse went on to link "Get Outta that
Spaceship" to a weird, late-night conversa
tion he had with Flaming Lips singer Wayne
Coyne — but he made sure to stop before he
nailed down too much of the song's meaning.
The history of The Grifters' raunchy and
stubborn rock begins about six years ago
in a flower shop where Shouse and
Lampkins worked. Their boss allowed them
to use the store for late night rehearsals with
their then-new band, Hud.
"We rehearsed in the flower shop, and we
were young at doing this band," says Shouse,
explaining the reasons for the name. "We
thought of ourselves as kind of like a flower
bud, the immature thing that might blossom
or might never open. Plus the Southern ex
pression of 'Hey bud,' which is prevalent
down here."
Hut the name Hud proved troublesome
because of constant confusion with Budweis
er beer. The band decided to change its name
to A Hand Called Hud, but that sounded "too
watered-down," so they finally decided on
The The Grifters. Coming from the Jim
Thompson novel, the Grifters were con-men
who ran the "wheels of chance" in the carni
vals of the 19205. The name is strangely ap
propriate, Shouse says.
"This whole band is like a wheel of
chance," he says. "Every time we play or
record, we know kind of what we're doing.

We know what's on the wheel, and we know
how to spin it. Hut we spin it, and a lot of
times things backfire. You don't know what's
going to happen."

Once (he group settled on a name and re
leased a few HPs, they began work on
their first full-length record. The result,
1992's "So Happy Together," is a disjointed
and fuzzed-out rock album, featuring trea

sures like "Tat," "Meanwhile" and"The Want"
buried beneath layers of filth and noise.
"['So Happy Together'] was probably the
most premeditated record we've ever done,"
Shouse says. "We went into the studio and
said, 'Let's make a record that's got hair in the
grooves.' We really wanted to have like a
Pussy Galore-ish kind of sound to it, with
very un-Pussy Galore-ish type songs. It was a
real premeditated thing to go in the studio
and see what kind of really fucked-up studio
record we could make."
