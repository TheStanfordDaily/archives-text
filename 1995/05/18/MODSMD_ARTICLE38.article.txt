# Helium Apopalypse now
## 
### Arnold Pan 
The disorienting drone of "Baby's Going
Underground" sounds the coming of the
apopalypse for the crowd, the moment
before the moment when Helium explodes
its indie pop stuff into something that's
much more. Lonely on the floor of the
cramped stage, a kid-sized keyboard with the
right keys duct-taped down waits for the
band to join in the racket.
With her nimble fingers tiptoeing the fret
hoard of her guitar, Helium dictatrix Mary
Timony grabs the lead. She coaxes crisp,
march-like riffs from her guitar as her calm
moon face tilts up to the microphone. Star
ing off into the Kilowatt's dim-lit space, Tim
ony is the portrait of the artist in moody con
centration, someone between our whacked
out college-rock savior and a "disturbed 12
year-old," as a showgoer describes her.
"Baaaby... 1 saw they kicked you down."
Timony's voice strains, slicing through the din
and giving the rhythm section of drummer
Shaun King Delvin and bassist Ash Bowie its
cue to crash in with a resounding boom. That
instant is the fulfillment of tension and the in
tensification of it, a heavy blur that whisks you

off your feet at the same time it keeps them
earthbound. The infinity of the imperious
mantra cascades and lurches with dynamic
shifts which exemplify the most beautiful bru
tality anyone could create from vox-guitar
bass-drums. And cheapo keyboard.
The only constant through the song —
and most of Helium's 45-minute set — is Ti
mony's peaceful-yet-frustrated gaze. Which
seems appropriate, considering that the
singer / guitarist / songwriting-genius is the
eye of Helium's storm, that central point
from where the band's gale force sound finds
it strength. At the end of the gig, Timony
looks fazed and unfazed at the sam. time,
having just put on the best show possible
under the crappy circumstances.
Before the show, Timony tells me that she
can't hear herself on-stage, making the
difficult task of reproducing her intri
cate art all the more. She's not bitching,
rather hoping that the undesirable condi
tions won't get in the way of the Boston-area
band's first-ever San Francisco show on its
grueling first-ever tour.

Timony is as im
mediately approach
able as her music is not.
Although her songs ex
press anger and desper
ation with thrilling
focus, Mary Helium
appears almost chipper
and, well, very normal.

It has been asked before, but it's hard to es
cape from wondering: How could someone
so nice sing about stuff so sinister as "my lit
tle kiss of death and things that die?"
"I've read that in interviews too," Timony
says in a phone chat weeks before the San Fran
cisco gig. "This cute girl. But in her songs, she
sounds like an evil monster.' Well, I'm definite
ly not like this horrible, sad, evil person in
everyday life to other people. I may be like that
by myself in my room. You know what I mean?
It's not like you need to express yourself artisti
cally around every person you talk to.
"I mean, I don't think the songs are that
evil. That's what confuses me. I don't feel like
the songs are about stuff that's so horrible.
Because it's so normal to me."
Confusing Timony with her songs might
be the best testament to the power of her craft
because it's so easy to get caught up in the
vividly depressing mood she sets. Unflinch
ingly earnest and serious at first glance, Tim
ony's music bares a biting wit that becomes
more and more prominent. That medium of
charming cynicism allows the listener to ex
perience one's deepests-and-darkests with
out being torn apart by them. Timony comes
to terms with the ugly and makes something
pretty out of it.
The balance between gloom and sneer
emerges more clearly on Helium's new LP
"The Dirt of Luck" than anything else the
band's done in its super-fruitful three-year ex
istence. Timony explains that "The Dirt of
Luck" comes off "way more playful" than the

heavier stuff of "Pirate Prude," Helium's lav
ishly commended 1994 debut HP. Whereas
"Pirate Prude" is compelling and stark, "The
1 )irt of I uck" takes another step: The new work
is all that, but also fun in the gravest sense.
While the lyrics are every bit as incisive, Ti
mony gives her haunting verses new life and
new meaning by coupling them with the car
nival-music-from-Hades tone that pervades
the more recent work. Warped pop ditties like
"Skeleton" and "Superball" are like sound
tracks to merry-go-rounds of the nether-di
mensions, getting kooky and spooky in their
scuz/ed-out guitar flourishes. "Skeleton,"
particularly, is a piece of chilling sarcasm,
with a chorus about "pretty baby candy" and
the oh-so provocative line that "theonly good
man's a dead man." That Timony can wrap a
sense of humor and a sense of empowerment
into a tidy pop song package typifies her
unique songwriting gifts.
"[The album | is completely sarcastic," she
says. "That's what people don't understand.
Like 'Skeleton' is a joke. It's making fun of
myself for going crazy. Really, I'm making
fun of myself because I feel like I'm going in
sane. It's definitely not the kind of thing that's
like really blatant. But it's definitely not seri
ous. Most people don't realize that."
Timony is happiest with the results of
what could be this year's best alt-rock
offering — "(T)hisalbum sounded the
way 1 wanted it to," she enthuses.
