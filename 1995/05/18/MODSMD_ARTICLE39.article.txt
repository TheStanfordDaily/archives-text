## Aïda Croal VARIOUS ARTISTS Pump Ya Fist VARIOUS ARTISTS Panther 
### 
I like soundtracks.
I like them because they're sharp, they're
eclectic and they call up the freshest, dopest
scenes from my favorite movies. Even if the
film isn't so hot — wack script, lame acting
or an out-to-lunch director — you throw
an all star musical cast into the mix and
you'll bump that baby up to the next artis
tic level.
Now in this New Jack era of gritty urban
flicks and buppie directors, the soundtrack

assumes a even more pivotal role. As repro
ductions of the "real," the "hard," the "au
thentic" street experience, these New Jack
films just aren't complete without an crew
of native informants — imported straight
from the hoody hood — to lend them that
cinema verite kind of feel.
I.nter the hip-hop artist.
From "Colors," and "Straight Outta
Brooklyn," to "Boy/ in the Hood," "Menace
II Society" and, most recently, our favorite
predator, "Panther," directors have come to

rely on this urban expert.
"Pump Ya l ist," a new collec
tion of hip-hop "inspired by the

Black Panthers," is no differ
ent. It's kick-ass crew of hip
hoppers, including Jeru the
Pamaja, Rakim, Chuck I),
Speech of Arrested Develop
ment, Dred Scott and its sole
female, Yo Yo, paint a vividly
bleak picture of black life in
America yet offer only a few
oft - recycled remedies.

KRS-One is predictable in his

role as community historian / prophet in
"Ah Yeah," a hard-hitting head nodder.
Speech is similarly prophetic, and ever-pos
itive in "Positive Vibe." This album repre
sents a cross-section of good — not great —
hip-hop. While some tracks like Tupac's
"Throw Your Hands Up" and the Fugees'
"Recognition" stand out, it is tirand Puba's
"Pump Ya Fist" that encapsulates themes-

sages of the album.

Iflivin in America's got you

pissed, pump ya

ftst / and if you ever

had handcuffs on

your wrists,
pump ya fist / if
you hate seeiri
black people get
dissed, pump
ya fist / and if
you tired bein

caught up in that

twist, pump ya fist!
"Panther," the

actual soundtrack for
the film, is a brilliant or-

chestration of talent
ed performers and
subject matter. Mov
ing between '70s P-

Funk, soul, gospel, hip-hop and every
thing in between, the collection is able to
capture the spirit of the Black Power
movement.
"Freedom," the theme from "Panther,"
is an electric ensemble piece that sets the
incredibly high standard that, for the most
part, the album actually lives up to. Black
street's funkdafied "Black People" is play
ful and infinitely danceable, yet it's refrain
(we've got say, Black people) reminds of
the seriousness and the power behind a
community's decision to reclaim the term
"Black."
Delving into both the pleasure and the
pain, the rhetorical and the raw, the somber
and the silly, "Panther" achieves what
"Pump Ya Fist" cannot — complexity.
Musically inspiring and lyrically chal
lenging, "Panther," raises the stakes for all
future buppie-film-generated collabora
tions. I really liked this soundtrack.
