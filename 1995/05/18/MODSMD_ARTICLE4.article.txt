# Up and running
## Alum has his eyes on a state Assembly seat 
### Stephen L. Shih 
You may have three midterms
to study for and two papers to
write — not to mention you've got
to squeeze in some time with your
current love interest and wish
your mom a Happy Mother's Day.
Now imagine having all your
class work combined with the
pressures of being in law school.
And married. And serving on the
school board. And fighting for so
cial change as a candidate for the
California State Assembly.
But somehow, Stanford alum
nus Steve Phillips is managing to
do it — with gusto.
Phillips is one of several candi
dates vying for the State Assem
bly's Thirteenth District seat, cur
rently held by Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown, who will not be able
to run for re-election in 1996 be
cause of term limits.
A 1992 Stanford graduate with
a bachelor's degree in African-
American Studies, Phillips is cur
rently a vice president of the San

Francisco Board of Education and
a first-year student at Hastings
College of Law.
As a democratic candidate,
Phillips stands out as a liberal, a
progressive and an idealist. And
he isn't shy about it.
In a full-page advertisement he
recently purchased in the Califor
nia edition of the New York Times,
Phillips outlined his plan for the
state.
Phillips' program includes edu
cation reform, a "preventive and
pro-active anti-crime policy," a re
newed commitment towards affir
mative action and support for
families that do not fit the " 1950's
nuclear model" — including sin
gle-parent households and homo
sexual families.
Citing the present as "a time of
struggle" for the Democratic
Party, Phillips accused leading
Democrats of mimicking Republi
cans.
"The Democratic Party is aban
doning its traditional role of fight
ing for disenfranchised people," he
said. "I want to be part of building
a political movement which will
give disenfranchised people greater
influence in power."
Phillips said he is pro-choice and
believes California must be a leader
in protecting the environment. He
and the San Francisco School Dis
trict are challenging Proposition
187 — which would deny social ser
vices to illegal immigrants — and
he opposes the "Contract With
America," which he claims will
have "disastrous" long-term
effects.
His is not exactly a "safe" politi
cal agenda in the present political
atmosphere of Gingrich conser
vatism.
But Phillips, who describes
himself as a soldier in"the strug
gle for social change," has never
been one to settle for the status
quo. Although his opponents —
who include San Francisco Super
visor Carole Migden and former
Mayor and Assemblyman Art
Agnos — may claim he has limited
political experience, Phillips has
always had a "long-standing
attraction" to electoral politics.
When he was 8, he put up signs for
McGovern; at 16, he ran precincts
for Carter.
Phillips' political interests blos
somed at the Farm, as did his time
management skills. As chair of the
Black Student Union, he helped
organize a 1989 student march on
the state Assembly in Sacramento
to rally for a stronger legislative
commitment to educational rights.
He also led the Fight for a Universi
ty response to the posting of racial
ly offensive flyers in Ujamaa and
wrote Justice and Hope, an 80-
page book chronicling the history
of blacks at Stanford.
And the list goes on.
As a freshman, Phillips worked

to change the Western Culture
program and urged the University
to divest investments in South
Africa as a statement against
apartheid. In addition, he was a
member of the varsity basketball
team and a columnist, editorial
board member and multicultural
correspondent for The Daily. In
1984 and 1988, he took time off
from school to take part in the
Jesse Jackson presidential cam
paigns.
"It directly showed me the con
nection between electoral politics

and the civil
rights movement
and how a cam
paign can be a
moral force for
change," he said.
"That had a very
big impact on
w
me.
Although the
election will not
take place until

next March, Phillips said the race
is well underway. He added that he
intends to finish law school no mat
ter how the election turns out —
but he admits it may take him a bit
longer to do it if he wins.
But is it really possible for a 31-
year old law student to win?
Bill Mills, a doctoral candidate
in electrical engineering, knows
first-hand the difficulties of being a
student and running for public
office. Mills ran for the state
Assemby in November, losing to
incumbent and Stanford Law Prof.
Byron Sher.
The obstacles Mills faced in his
campaign were a lack of experi
ence, funds and name recognition.
His advice to Phillips: "Go out and
campaign hard and have fun."
Paul Brest, dean of the Law
School, said he definitely thinks it
is possible for Phillips to win, citing
Barney Frank of Massachusetts as
an example. The real question,
Brest said, is whether a 31-year-old
has enough wisdom to serve in
public office.
