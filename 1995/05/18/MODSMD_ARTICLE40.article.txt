## beggars 
### 
Everything about the beggars' eponymous
release on Island Records is completely in
sipid. The beggars are the Lightning Seeds
without any of the endearing naivete. They
are a saccharine sweet Church or where the
Jesus and Mary Chain meets the Monkees.
From the overproduced, smooth recording
and the polished distortion guitars all the
way to Eli Braden's any-man-alterna-voice,
the album is utterly bland.
Musically, all of the songs are in the same
three chord vein. The progressions are obvi
ous and unsurprising. The songs are so simi
lar that the entire album blends into an un
differentiated glob of vanilla pop pudding.

The guitars are processed and layered
with kits of keyboards to the point of having
no distinguishing features. The drums and
bass are mixed at easy listening levels and un
successfully try to retain rock and roll credi
bility. All rough edges have been filed down
making the music entirely inoffensive and
completely banal.
Worst of all are the superficial, trite lyrics.
On "Falling Down," Braden unconvincingly
sings, "1 got no where to go / 1 got nothing to
show / I'm just hangin' around / with my
head on the ground / Falling down / I got
nothing to say / 1 got no where to stay / I'm
not hearing a sound /1 don't now where I'm
bound / Falling down." The lyrics are point
less and appear to be the first thing that came
to the writer's mind.
This asininity is a common thread
throughout the 12 songs on the album. On
"Silver and Gold," the cliches and insincerity
are nearly intolerable. The chorus, "she
brings me silver / she brings me gold / if she

only knew what she does for me," is repeated
ad nauseam.
If you are in the mood for bubble gum
packaged under the guise of alternative
music, the beggars are for you. Otherwise
save yourself the trouble and leave them on
the shelf.
