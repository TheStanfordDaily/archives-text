# JIMI HENDRIX
## Voodoo Soup 
### 
Of the many rock and roll deaths, Jimi
Hendrix's left the most questions unan
swered.
Buddy Holly's death was remarkably trag
ic too, but it was pure tragedy, the type of
which movies are made. John Lennon's death
transformed him into the martyr for his gen
eration. Janis Joplin's death was the perfect
ending to her desperate legacy. The deaths of
Jim Morrison, Brian lones and Keith Moon
were surprising only because they did not
happen sooner.
The death of Jimi Hendrix, however, was
nothing less than a catastrophic loss to the
musical world. Able to produce sounds never
before conceived, Hendrix's work defined
the possibilities of the electric guitar as he
stretched the instrument's boundaries fur
ther than anyone before or since.
His genius may be fully realized by how,
compared to the other guitar heroes of his
day, relatively little influence his work has
had on previous generations. While his style
had certainly influenced rockers as diverse as
Prince, Pete Townshend and Sly Stone, his
actual guitar work has not because of its im
mense difficulty. According to Eddie Van
Halen, Hendrix's music didn't influence him
greatly simply because he was not able to get
his guitar to produce the same sounds.

Where Hendrix was going musically after
the breakup of the Jimi Hendrix Experience
has been the subject of much debate. The
newly released "Voodoo Soup" proposes
some answers.
Composed of songs which would have
comprised his fourth studio album, "Voodoo
Soup" is an impressive mix. The fiercesome,
six-minute "Midnight" is included with the
flowing, serene "Angel." "Stepping Stone"
and "Freedom" are strong anthems, showing
Hendrix in some of his most confident mo
ments.
Overall, the album has a heavy blues feel
to it. In particular, "Belly Button Window"
shows Hendrix adapting the blues vocabu
lary to fit his own messages, in this case, an
argument for the right to have an abortion.
The album's instrumental tracks are all
engaging, but they could use the focus lyrics
would add. Because the tracks were unfin
ished, they have a melancholy feeling to
them, regardless of the actual style. One can
not forget that they are but empty shells of
what could have been. Perhaps the truest sign
of the potential lost by Hendrix's death, the
tracks are as haunting as they are beautiful.
