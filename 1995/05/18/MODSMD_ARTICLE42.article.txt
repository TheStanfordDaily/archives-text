# DANNY TATE
## Nobody's Perfect more spins

Fair to middling That ain't the weather re
port. That's one opinion of Danny Tate's
newest album, "Nobody's Perfect."
Driving along Alma with one ear to the
radio, I hear the DJ preface the next song, "If
Danny Tate doesn't make it big with the
songs on this album, it will be his good looks
that break him in." "Dreamin' " jams from
the radio, and I think it is a pretty catchy
tune.
