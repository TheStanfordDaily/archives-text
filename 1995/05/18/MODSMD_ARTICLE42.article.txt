# DANNY TATE
## Nobody's Perfect more spins 
### 
Fair to middling That ain't the weather re
port. That's one opinion of Danny Tate's
newest album, "Nobody's Perfect."
Driving along Alma with one ear to the
radio, I hear the DJ preface the next song, "If
Danny Tate doesn't make it big with the
songs on this album, it will be his good looks
that break him in." "Dreamin' " jams from
the radio, and I think it is a pretty catchy
tune.

A really cool part of "Dreamin' " is Tate's
use of the haunting voice that everyone is fa
miliar with — the voice that floats through
one's head during a dream. Unfortunately,
late only uses a few tricks like this one to
build up his album.
While the bass plunges to hit the bottom
of a deep gully in "Where the Sun Goes
Down," cowboys are not out meeting on
Main Street for a shoot-out. Rather, only Tate
mourns over an absent passion. The dropped
chord of the guitar re-creates the atmosphere
of the Old West, but, oddly enough, l ate isn't
even from the Old West. 1 le's an Arkansas
boy trying to make it big in 1..A.
The question is whether or not he's going
to be able to pull it off. My guess is he just
might, but not due to any lyric writing talent.
That's not his strong point.
Fainted as a renegade James Dean charac
ter by the photos on the album cover and the
press release, Tate unfortunately comes
across in his lyrics as a cheese ball.
Look down the list of last words of lines in
"The Price of Love" to find
"everyday / pay / stay / love / devotion / em
otion / ocean / love." My advice to Tate is get
some better lyrics. Rather than trying to
make it all rhyme, he should scratch the itch
and say what he really feels.
"Like a Fool," Tate uses the word "blind"
in five of the 10 songs on the album. "Do It
All Over Again," "Dreamin'," "Stayin' Alive,"
"Blind Desire" and "Still a Fool" all sport the
idea of lacking eye sight. Perhaps Tate should
open his own eyes and realize that the words
aren't going to make it for him.
It's the life that he puts into his guitar that
might make the cut. In several songs Tate al
lows himself a jammin' interlude on his gui
tar before returning to the cheesy lyrics. In
other songs Tate slowly molests the soul of
the chords as he picks them out on his guitar.
I do admit that the DJ was right. The guy
is good looking as his cover photo attests to.
Also his guitar massaging can really get into
the bones, but the lyrics suck out the marrow
of the album. Keep in mind, "Nobody's Per
fect."
