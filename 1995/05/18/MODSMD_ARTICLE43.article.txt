# VARIOUS ARTISTS
## Friday 
### 
"Friday": It's more than a day, it's attitude
on the motion picture soundtrack produced
by the ghetto bird himself, Ice Cube. Featur
ing artists spanning the musical range from
Rap to Miami Bass, "Friday" transcends
time, resurrecting '80s classics from Rick
James and Rose Royce.
The album begins by setting the party
scene through cuts like Ice Cube's "Friday,"
and Scarface's rough, rugged and raw re
count of a typical "Friday Night." Not to
mention Dr. Dre's smooth groove that defi
nitely will "Keep their Heads Ringin'."
Cypress Hill appears on the album charac
teristically professing the pleasures of gettin'
high to the hypnotic chanting chorus of "roll
it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, ex
hale. .." Mack 10 affirms their beliefs in the
conducive cut "Take a Hit." Even Rick James'
old school track "Mary Jane" creates a loose,
laid-back feel that seeps through sections of
the album.
Hard core until the end, the artists on Fri
day make no mistake about their take on
women. Tracks like "Superhoes," in which
Funkdoobiest equates the exploits of their
women with superheroes like Spiderman,
Cyclops and the Nightcrawler and "1 loochie
Mama," filled with the trademark rhymes of
2 Live Crew, pay a tasteless homage to the
scandalous women these artists may en
counter on Friday afternoons.
The only exception is the retro-nouveau
R&B cut "I Wanna Get Next to You" by Rose
Royce. Contrary to the other "love songs" on
this album, this old school slow jam, reminis
cent of many Motown favorites, soothes your
ears with lines like "dreams of you and I go
sailin' by / whenever your eyes meet
mine. / you're so fine."
"Friday" isn't all about drugs, sex and par
ties, as pointed out in songs like "Lettin' Nig
gas Know," "Blast if I Have To," and "Tryin' to
See Another Day." These tracks show the
tougher side of life, illustrating different
strategies for makin' it from day to day, and
letting you know that life's more than just
one big party.
The messages on this album capture the
essence of Friday and redefine it at the same
time, but musically the tracks fail to mirror
that. Although the messages are strong, the
beats don't always follow. Cuts like "You Got
Me Wide Open," and Roger's rendition of "I
Heard it Through the Grapevine" illustrate
some of the album's weaker points.
