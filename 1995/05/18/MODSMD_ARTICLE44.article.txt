# CATHERINE WHEEL
## Happy Days 
### 
Amid the unremarkable songs on Cather
ine Wheel's listless debut album "Ferment"
came the seven-minute epic "Black Metallic."
Unlike its homogenous, sleepy neighbors, the
song stuck with an over-reaching psychedelia
just audacious enough to bully its listener into
recognition. "Chrome," Catherine Wheel's
sophomore effort, cemented in punchy pre
tension the arrogance of "Black Metallic," and
with the single "Crank" it economized,
pulling in the musical reigns in order to hit
harder and louder. While more satisfying, the
album still felt too safe and standard; only
singer Rob Dickson's effeminate croon
nudged the sound into an off-kilter land of
Brit-retro-acid-pop.
"Happy Days," Catherine Wheel's satisfy
ing and surprising third album, picks up
where "Chrome" left off. Despite weak mo
ments, the album pushes the musical enve
lope, getting by turns louder and quirkier than
any of its other efforts. What's perhaps lost is
the middle ground — that place where
Catherine Wheel balances the screwy with the
impactive, emerging with class and weight.
What's gained is a sense of experimentation
and risk.
"God Inside My Head" is a disappointing
start, pilfering a Breeders-hook and smother
ing it with glammy, arena-sized power chords.
"Waydown" works much better. It's tough and
campy at the same time, its edgy, lacerating
guitars restless underneath Dickinson's war
bling howl. "Little Muscle" gets away with co
quettish innuendo and countrified twang only
through its just-in-time hammering guitars.
"My Exhibition"endorsesdark, industrial mo
notony with an unmistakable caustic appeal.
And with "Heal" Catherine Wheel uncovers its
penchant for the sweeping melodrama of the
London Suede. Hut it's dirtier; Dickinson's
falsetto comes across brutish, not pretty.
"Eat My Dust You Insensitive Fuck" rears
up as the most defiant risk on the album. Its
quiet melody and strangled mournful saxo
phone are the depth of seriousness. But the
lullaby refrain, "Eat my dust...." pushes the
whole thing into an unsettlingly relaxed hyste
ria. The mix of such angry lyrics with such
amicable music seems like schizophrenic
background music for the serially insincere.
It's hard to know where Catherine Wheel
intends to go with this album. The brilliance
of "Black Metallic" has broken into pieces here
— its audacity and catchiness still around but
strung together by a near-invisible thread.
They pull it off though, raising the stakes and
imbuing the songs with an urgency and im
pact not yet heard in their other earlier efforts.
