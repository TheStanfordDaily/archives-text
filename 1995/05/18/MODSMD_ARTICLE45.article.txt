# RAIL ROAD JERK
## One Track Mind 
### 
Not since Black Francis crooned about the
"whores in his head" has garage-rock been so
honest ar ' sounded so good as it does on
Rail Road jerk's fourth LP release on Mata

dor Records. This band is fresh, exciting and
leaves you humming their melodies and tap
ping your foot.
"One Track Mind" is anything but single
minded. An eclectic gem, this album is
catchy, gritty and endearingly homely. With
charming low-fi appeal, the music spans
from indie experimentation to blues to coun
try and back to rock.
Rail Road Jerk is rumored to have created
its name by picking two words from the dic
tionary and putting them together. The fact
that they took two seemingly unconnected
words and infused them with a strange
meaning is indicative of their music.
On this album songs drawing from differ
ent genres are placed back to back. However,
because Rail Road Jerk plays each piece with
witty, engaging enthusiasm in a style all its
own, the songs are somehow sewn together
into a patchwork quilt of sound.
Take, for example, the transition from
"The Ballad of Rail Road Jerk" to "big White
Lady." In the former, Marccllus Hall chants
with Pixie-esque distinction: "Hellfire and
Brimstone / my mind is on the grindstone /1
got myself ready for the shit to hit the
wall / And the 10th annual, video masquer
ade ball."
This is followed by the country hoe-down
"Big White Lady," which begins with Alec
Stephen drawling: "Big white lady and 1 in
the city/Cross those rivers and say you're
pretty." This transition is met with just
enough sarcasm and humor for the listener
to flow from one to the other without sur
prise.
The most important thing about this
album is that these guys remember that rock
'n' roll should be fun and truthful. The music
may not be pretty and is definitely rough
around the edges. But, there is no doubt that
the personality of Kail Road Jerk shines
through. And personality goes a long ways.
