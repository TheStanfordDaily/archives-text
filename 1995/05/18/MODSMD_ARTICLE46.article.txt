## Yuen Ping Low HUANG'S HOLLYWOOD SHARKS SPARE NONE 
### 
"In Hollywood, one of the fastest ways to the
top is work for someone already there."
In "Swimming with Sharks," studio executive
Buddy Ackerman (Kevin Spacey) is not just
there — he's white-hot. A Time magazine article
attributes the persistent but profitable presence
of big-screen violence to none other than this
major player at "Keystone Pictures," and for

Swimming
with Sharks

good reason, too. Aggressive behavior is one
thing Buddy takes very personally.
Fresh out of film school — and poised anx
iously on the threshold of Tinseltown's inner
sanctum — Guy (Frank Whaley) begins work as
Buddy's assistant at the studio. The initiation
rites that greet the hapless novice involve his
boss' personal arsenal of flying Files, torpedo
pencils and other vicious items of office sta
tionery* t urned-ammunit ion.
Softening the blows of Buddy's tantrums is
the attention that Dawn (Michelle Forbes), a
cool-cat, smart-as-hell producer, affords the
shell-shocked Guy. Predictably, business agen
das — Dawn's project seeks the green light from
"Keystone" — intermingle with strains of plea
sure and lead to ominous consequences.
Writer-director George Huang's hard-hitting
debut rips away any pretension of human decen
cy by the power-hungry predators that inhabit

the big-time celluloid
community. The bones laid bare here — in the
shape of Buddy's leering and teeth-clattering
skull — would send a chilling note down the
spine of any graduating senior bound for the
"industry" down south.
Yet, the energetic performances Huang
wrings out of his cast are emblematic of talent
being put to good use, and actors having a ball of
a time. The master / slave dynamics between
Spacey and Whaley are more than palpable —
even if they are at times marred by Spacey's affin
ity for whip-cracking and his clumsy scripting
attempts.
Promising actress Forbes, however, stands her
ground; in her capable hands, Dawn's arresting
persona ably steals the scene from the boys in nu
merous instances. Providing what is close
enough to a moral voice in the story, Dawn has
brains, ambition, heart and a sharp sense of
humor, thanks to Huang's inspired writing for
the character.
Pitch-black in its comedy and relentless in its
parody, "Swimming with Sharks" is also that
rare American feature that takes one right to the
very edge and refuses to pull the brakes even at
the final moment — Huang takes his subject of
interest farther than "The Player" would dare to
contemplate.
Yes, in Huang's books, every horror story
you've heard about the soulless state of Holly
wood art is all true.
