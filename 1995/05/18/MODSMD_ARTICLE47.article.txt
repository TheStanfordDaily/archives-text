# HATTA’S DRAMATIC INSTINCTS AND UNIQUE VISION ADD UP TO MORE THAN A PRETTY PICTURE
## 
### 
"Picture Bride" has all the markings
of what many would call a politically
correct film: minority actors, a tale of
women struggling against economic ex
ploitation and chauvinism, and a
woman director scraping together the
funds to finish an entire film what

Picture Bride

wouldn't pay for one-tenth of what
Sylvester Stallone gets paid to mumble,
run away from explosions and share
heartfelt moments with Sharon Stone.
But best intentions do not always re
sult in the best of films, and "Picture
Bride" is an example. Starting off
strongly, its characters and story begin
to drift off in inexplicable directions,
draining an undeniably fascinating
premise and lush setting of interest.
I lowever, this is a low budget film with
high ambitions and a first-time director
— if it fails to live up to its aims its not
for reasons that can't be fixed by direct
ing more films. And if it points the way
where Kayo

Hatta, the di
rector of "Pic
ture Bride," is
headed, then
we can expect
greater things.
You k i
Kudoh is ex
tremely be
lievable as the

young ingenue, Riyo Nakamura, who
pins her hopes of a happier future on a
long-distance marriage. The film's
most interesting moment comes in its
opening minute, where we watch a
montage of period photos showing
some of the women who left every
thing they had to enter a harsh and
alien world of strangers.
Finding neither her husband nor
her new lifestyle to her liking, Riyo
must either get tough and adapt, like
all of her female coworkers trapped on
the plantation — or focus only on re
turning to Japan.
Unfortunately, the script doesn't es
tablish or develop this conflict with any
rousing intensity; instead, the film
feels stitched together, with Riyo alter
nately seeing how harsh or how good
life can be, making her final decision
on where to make her home seem arbi
trary.
But faults aside — and they are no
ticeable indeed — Kayo Hatta is a
young filmmaker whose dramatic sen
si bili ties need

only be comple
mented by the
proper tools and
a few more films.
It will be inter
esting to see how
this combina
tion will play out
in the future.
