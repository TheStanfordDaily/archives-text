# AN ATYPICAL UNGLAMOROUS PORTRAIT OF NYC LOVE
## 
### 
All non-NYC natives love a New York story
if it fits their romantic ideals: Manhattan — the
Woody Allen "White, Well-off and upper west
side," or Mean Streets — the glamour of gang
sters and drugs.
"The List Good Time" (based on the novel
by Richard Bausch) is neither of these. The story
centers around a May-December relationship
between 75-year old Joseph Kopple (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) and 22-year old Charlotte
Zwicky (Olivia D'Abo of "The Wonder Years").

The Last
Good Time

Since it violates certain traditional mores of
propriety, this typical romance often gets
tagged as a "European" film. But director Bob
Balaban ("Parents") tells the story of these New
Yorkers without sugar-coating their problems.
This film pulls few punches, tackling taboo
subjects like the loneliness older people endure

in our modern urban centers, their financial
difficulties and — the theme Balaban has em
phasized in interviews — their sex lives. Kop
ple's friend Howard (the late Lionel Stander),
who lives in a nursing home, is the film's
mouthpiece for this livelong human desire for
physical — as well as emotional — companion
ship. Finding sexual partners is easier for the
young guns, but they also face problems. Abu
sive lovers like Charlotte's shady boyfriend
F.ddie (Adrian Pasdar), who helped her break

away from a rotten home life, now presents the
problem she wants to escape.
These characters' lives converge briefly and,
because this is a movie, are changed because of
it. The pacing is deliberate but not flashy, and
much of the story is told quietly.
Simple pleasures and daily rituals hold talis
manic power, but in"The Last Good Time" the
effect one person has on another is more pow
erful still.
