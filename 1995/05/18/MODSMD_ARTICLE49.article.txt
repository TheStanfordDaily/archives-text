# ARCHAIC COLD WAR INSTINCTS DIE HARD IN 'CRIMSON TIDE'
## 
### 
With an action-packed plot torn from
today's headlines, "Crimson Tide" would
have to work pretty hard to disappoint. Still,
in spite of its big-name cast and expensive
special effects, the movie fails to live up to the
standard of the contemporary submarine

Crimson Tide

classic "The I lunt for Red October."
The premise is promising: A radical fac
tion of the Russian army has seized control of
a nuclear missile base, and its leader threat
ens to launch at the United States. America
dusts off its Cold War survival manual and
dispatches the USS Alabama, a nuclear sub
marine with seasoned captain Frank Ramsay
(Gene Hackman) in command, into the Pa
cific to counter the threat.

When the Alabama is ordered to launch
nuclear weapons at Russia, it appears that
everyone's worst nightmare is about to come

true. Before the
missiles are ready
to fly, however, an
other emergency
action message
starts to come in,
but it is cut off
when the sub's
communications
equipment is
damaged. Lacking
further informa
tion, Capt. Ram
say elects to pro
ceed with the
launch.
The Alabama's

executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Ron Hunter
(Denzel Washington), decides not to go
along, however, leading to the inevitable con

frontation between Ramsay's Cold War in
stincts and Hunter's by-the-book mentality.
As usual, Washington turns in a strong
performance, and it's hard dislike Hackman
in his role as the intractable cold warrior.
Still, the pair's protracted power struggle is
really the only conflict that drives "Crim
son's" simplistic plot. In the end, that's just
not enough to make a movie great.
This is not to say that "Crimson Tide" is
bad. The underwater effects are amazing,
and the depiction of life aboard a submarine
— incomprehensible lingo and all — is
pretty cool.
By the time the credits start to roll, how
ever, the viewer is left disappointed. The
movie's finale is very predictable, and its
"everybody wins" epilogue is unfulfilling.
Still, it's a good time getting there.
