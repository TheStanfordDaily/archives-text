# Ticket plan clarified
## Three groups formally exempted from system 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Stanford Events yesterday clarified its
contested ticket policy by formally granting
exemptions to three major student groups
and forming a committee to recommend a
policy for smaller student organizations.
The policy mandates that any group
using Memorial Auditorium, Memorial
Church or Frost Amphitheater sell its tick
ets through Stanford Ticket Office. The of
fice would assess buyers a surcharge.
ASSU Sunday Flicks, ASSU Speakers
Bureau and Ram's Head Productions were
granted an exemption from the policy in a
written statement by Director of Stanford
Events Lois Wagner.
Speakers' Bureau Director Scott Moss
had said that Larry Davidson, associate di
rector of Stanford Events, "insisted" that
the organizations were not exempt.
But after student protest last week over
the supposed changes, Wagner said the pol
icy has always existed and has never ap
plied to these groups.
"They have always had an exemption,"
she said. "I don't know why [the students]
made the statements that they made. We
have not said that they would be held to
that"
When reached on vacation, Davidson
siiid he had not heard of the clarification
and claimed he could not remember his
comments, but added that the Ticket Of
fice has received unwarranted hostility
over the past week.
"We're there as a service organization to

help provide a place to sell tickets to the
campus. We are not supported by any other
means except service charges," he said.
Davidson said that in a pending Music

Department policy,
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
will also be added to the
list of facilities requiring
sales through the Ticket
Office.
Moss was concerned
that the Speakers Bu
reau, which is required
by the ASSU Bylaws to
offer its tickets for free,
would be forced to pay an

extra $1.05 per ticket through the Ticket
Office.
The clarification by the administration
is the first written statement, said ASSU
Deputy Senate Chair Michael Choo.
"Larry Davidson arbitrarily said that all
these groups would be subject to this poli
cy," said Choo, who is a member of the in
coming Council of Presidents. "We asked
for a clarification of the policy. When it
came back, it outlined the policy."
Choo said he is not yet satisfied with the
policy, which still applies to all other stu
dent groups. Organizations which want to
sell tickets for cheaper prices would be
forced to pay for the service charge them
selves, Moss said.
"My concern is that one-time users of
[the facilities|, smaller groups, a cappella
groups are being shafted by this policy,"


Choo
Choo said. "There are a lot of
groups who simply cannot afford to
hold their events if they're subject
to the fees of the Ticket Office."
For this reason, Wagner said she
will form a working group to exam
ine the policy over this summer.
Students will be represented on the
committee, she said.
Moss said one reason the three
groups were granted exemptions is
because they "have clout." Smaller
groups may not be so lucky, he said.
Many student groups sell tickets

in White Plaza for programs in
buildings run by Stanford Events.
The magic group Illusions, for
example, is still selling tickets in
White Plaza for its upcoming show.
"If Fleet Street can distribute
their tickets in White Plaza, there's
no reason the University can say to
them, 'We're locking you out of the
auditorium unless you give Tresid
der Tickets $1 per ticket,' " Moss
said. "That's extortion."
Davidson said that student
groups can still sell tickets in both
White Plaza and the Ticket Office.
"We can't prohibit them from sell
ing tickets in White Plaza," he said.
"We don't have the authority to say
'yea' or 'nay.' "
