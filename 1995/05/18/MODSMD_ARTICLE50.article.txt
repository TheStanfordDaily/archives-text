"A Simple Twist of Fate" is written by and
stars Steve Martin. The story is based upon a
modernization of George Eliot's Silas Marner,
in which a miserly recluse Michael McCann
(Martin) gets a second chance at happiness
when an orphaned girl is abandoned on his
doorstep. As the story unravels, McCann and
his adopted daughter discover that she is the
by-blow of the town's wealthy politician Mr.
Newland (Gabriel Byrne). The conflict that
ensues is rather trite: the natural father is pit
ted against adoptive one in a custody battle
that rocks the small town society. Martin
moves away from his typical comedic perfor
mances by taking on an emotional and intel
lectual drama, yet he infuses his character with
his own particular brand of charm. Despite its

slow pace, the film's strong cast of characters
(which also includes Catherine O'Hara and
Stephen Baldwin) and bittersweet story make
this a flick worth renting.
"Radioland Murders" is a parody of the
Golden Age of radio in the 19405. The color
ful cast of characters includes Mary Stuart
Masterson —the redheaded station manager,
and Scott Benben as Roger — her screwball,
teddy-bear of a husband who doubles as the
station's script writer. George Burns and Joey
Lawrence are among the many famous faces
that make cameo appearances. As a murder
mystery, the film has little substance, but the
7.any antics of the characters are highly enter
taining. Light and fluffy, this film is good for
guffaws and giggles.

'Terminal Velocity" is, in my opinion, of
course, a terminal failure. Charlie Sheen plays
Ditch Brody, a maverick with a parachute. In
other words, he's a skydiving instructor who
looks about 30 but acts about 13. Ditch gets
involved in the dirty dealings of "KG-used to
B's," as well as in a romance with one of the
Russian mafia's own darlings (Natassja Kins

ki). Kinski and Sheen fail to ignite sparks and
the plot is incredibly far-fetched and cheesy.
Too bad, since Sheen is quite an endearing
smart-ass, who might have fared better had he
been given a better script.
"Ed Wood" — the mostly true story about
Hollywood's worst director— is directed by Tim
Burton and stars Johnny Depp. Burton and
Depp, well-known for their predilections for the
bizarre, are together indescribably weird. Ed
Wood (Depp) is a great con-man but a miserable
filmmaker. His personal life is no more success
ful, as he hangs out with washed-out, basket-case
Bcla Lugosi (Martin Landau) and various other
social outcasts. On top of it all, Wood's a trans
vestite and has an angora fetish. The film is ex
tremely strange, but it won Oscars—go figure.
