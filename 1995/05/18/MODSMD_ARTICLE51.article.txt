## Julie Tsai Running away from institutionalized aesthetics 
### 
For an art snob, I have an erratic populist
streak. Which may explain why I make a
crappy literary critic, or perhaps that's just a
faulty gene.
But looking back on not-so-idle days of
yore, I am convinced now that I was raised to
be an art snob. Not a dandruff-flecked,
clothed-in-black artiste entranced with my
own rarefied conceptions of a contorted
world, mind you. Rather, my mama had vi
sions of daintiness and light, of Jackie O. and
pastel suits without the tragedy. She's the one
who spoon-fed me classical piano and dance
lessons from the time I could barely read or
walk.
At this point, though, the only thing I'm
convinced of is that it's made me a little more
high-maintenance.
Russian literary giant Leo Tolstoy went
through a late mid-life crisis where he finally
declared art a luxury and a decadence. Which

is a pretty disturbing conclusion if you give
him the respect for his knowledgeability one
usually accords a genius who spent much of
his adult life recreating life through the writ
ten word.
While 1 don't believe it's reasonable or de
sirable to expect others to make any such
philosophical move, I have for various reasons
given up the game of wanting to put labels on
things, differentiating between "high" and
"low" art, or deciding what within those cate
gories deserves to be called art. I'm not any
good at it anyway, and I've decided people
shouldn't have to be for their aesthetic hu
manity to he validated.
And as for those who want their culture, be
it high or pop, sweet and digestible, who am I
to disturb the universe?
Interestingly enough, though, I suppose it's
our very own material world revolving at light
speed that creates a demand for these rough

hewn labels and the critics who generate
them. People who have money want to know
what's considered good taste to show they've
arrived, materially and aesthetically. People
who don't will use veiled words, alterna-alter
native being the current ones in favor, to dis
cern who knows and who doesn't and also as a
shorthand to communicate to those without
the time or inclination to track cultural trends.
The cult of the critic has made even per
sonal taste a salable commodity.
But again, who am 1 to disturb the uni
verse?
Personally, 1 think the post-modern thing
of alternating among the alternatives and then
back to the original has become frequent
enough to make y'all more sophisticated than
that. Genre names like alternative and folkie
and independent have predictably lost impact,
as has the impact of their aesthetics.
As in walking the walk and talking the talk

ain't enough anymore. Just ask Candlebox and
Green Day. While there's certainly always been
shorter-lived tolerance for emptiness of sub
stance, I'd go out on a limb and say these guys
have a better game than Milli Vanilli ever did.
Translated to our indie campus world, I've
so lost the game of the artiste, if I ever had it.
So 1 only own one black turtleneck, and it has
Lycra in it. 1 don't smoke, I only go to the Co
1 io when 1 have to, and I've never been able to
perform poetry.
But I know when I've heard, seen, played or
danced to something that makes the hairs on
the back of my neck stand up because it's that
good. And I also know when I shiver in sym
pathetic embarrassment for an artist because
it's that stupid.
I'm sure you all do too. And you don't need
somebody to tell you when it should or
shouldn't, even if you react differently to
something than an artiste would.
