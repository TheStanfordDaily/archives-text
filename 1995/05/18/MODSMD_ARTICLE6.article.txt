# SCLC to review results of Honor Code survey

The Student Conduct Legislative
Council met yesterday to discuss what
can be done to interpret and utilize the
results oflast year's Honor Code survey.
"The council is tiying to isolate areas
key to the reconsideration of elements of
the honor code," said John Rick, council
member and professor of anthropology.
As of now the council has no plans for a
major overhaul of the Honor Code, he
added.
University President Gerhard Casper
charged the SCLC with assessing the re
sults of the survey but the council has
not yet begun an in-depth analysis of the
survey because they have only met twice
this year.
Although the council expected to start
going over the survey this year, Rick said
analysis will have to wait until next year.
"We are really just trying to get ourselves
together now," he said.
One problem was the complete
turnover of council members from last
year. Usually some faculty members stay
on, but this year the council was com
pletely new, said Okada Resident Fellow
Derek Miyahara, an SCLC member.

"There wasn't a high response rate
among the faculty," said Miyahara. "The
(names of the faculty members on the)
council weren't finalized until the end of
last quarter."
One of the difficulties in having an en
tirely new council is that last year's
council wrote and conducted the 1994
survey.
"They knew which issues they wanted
to get at, so it would have been easier for
them to interpret the data," Miyahara
said, whose job it is to analyze the results
of the survey statistically.
Miyahara said he expects that he will
be asked to break down the survey by
graduate and undergraduate responses
and by area of study.
"We want to find out who are the peo
ple who cheat," Rick said, "but we are not
a detection or prediction device. We pri
marily want to identify and rectify any
problems with the Honor Code."
Along with the Stanford survey, the
council will also consider the results of a
1990 survey conducted by a Rutgers Uni
versity professor which involved stu
dents at 31 colleges.
The Stanford survey indicated
that 90 percent of the students
surveyed had a favorable opinion
of the Honor Code. Only one per
cent of the students surveyed
believed that the Honor Code
should be abandoned.
"Enforcing academic responsi
bility does not work," Rick said.
"If there is any place that an
honor code should work it is at a
university." As a professor, he
said he believes that the Honor
Code works for the most part,
although it does have limitations.
Rick said he feels that one
problem is that many students do
not turn in violators.
"We must ask if we are facing a
situation in which we put people
who don't cheat at risk," he said.
Students do not realize that,
because violations often go unre
ported, cheaters can prosper with
higher grades, he said.
