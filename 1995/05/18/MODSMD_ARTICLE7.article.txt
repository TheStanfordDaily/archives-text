# Hewlett and Packard explain ‘The HP Way'
## Alumni promote book at Bookstore 
### Stewart Maclennan 
It's been a long road since
their initial collaboration in a
one-car Palo Alto garage more
than 55 years ago.
Stanford graduates William
Hewlett and David Packard re
turned to the Farm yesterday
afternoon to celebrate the re
lease of Packard's book, "The
HP Way," signing copies for
hundreds of admirers in the
Bookstore.
Starting a private venture
during the Depression was no
small task, said Hewlett, who at
one point during an interview
interrupted Packard and
quipped, "There were no jobs
then, so we created our own!"
After only five years of re
ceiving small contracts from es
tablished companies, Hewlett
and Packard quickly estab
lished themselves as leading in

novators when they developed a
unique audio oscillator used to
produce the high-quality sound
effects in Disney's original 1939
film "Fantasia."
Packard, who graduated in
1934 with a bachelor's degree in
engineering, stressed the special
relationship between his company
and the University: "Without
Stanford, we wouldn't have a
company." Both he and Hewlett
remember former Engineering
Prof. Fred Terman encouraging
the two young undergraduates to
create their own business.
Ryland Kelly, class of '49 and a
close friend of Hewlett and
Packard, commented that their
highly successful company —
with a work force of over 98,000
people and sales of $25 billion in
1994 — owes a lot to the many
Stanford graduates who have

been employees.
Both men have also contribut
ed their resources and creative
expertise in many other fields.
Packard helped found the
Monterey Bay Aquarium and is
currently its research president.
He was instrumental in moving
the Medical School from its for
mer location in San Francisco to
the campus, where he recently
added the extensive Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital.
Hewlett has just completed
work on the Public Policy Institu
tion of California. Located in San
Francisco, this think tank will
house roughly 200 scholars devot
ed to forming policies concerned
with state problems.
Yesterday, both Hewlett and
Packard were positive about the
University's future. "Stanford is
as well prepared as any institu
tion in the country to meet the
demands of tomorrow," said
Packard, adding that "a liberal
education without science would
be lacking."
