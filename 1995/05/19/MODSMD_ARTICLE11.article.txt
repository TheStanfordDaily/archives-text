## Police kill man who stole tank 
### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) - Police
popped open the hatch on a
stolen 60-ton Army tank and
shot to death the unemployed
plumber who had steamrolled
over cars, utility poles and fire
hydrants before grinding to a
halt on a 3-foot freeway barrier.
Shawn Timothy Nelson, a 35-
year-old Army veteran who had
tank training in Germany, had
simply driven his van through
the open gate at a National
Guard armory, used his know
how to hook up an M-60 tank's
fuel and electric lines and started
it up Wednesday evening.
He plowed through 15 unoc
cupied cars, a parked van with a
woman and child inside, two util
ity poles, a public telephone and a
public bus bench. No bystanders
were hurt.
"The guy was just going
crazy,"said Kelly Bird, a witness.
"He was mowing cars over."
Fifteen to 20 police cruisers
trailed the tank, helpless, at
about 30 mph until it crunched
into a highway barrier about 20
minutes after it left the armory.
Four officers leaped atop the
tank and opened the hatch with
bolt cutters as it rocked back and
forth atop the divider. They
shouted at Nelson to surrender.
"He shifted into the proper
gear and was preparing to spin
the tank so he could get off the
high-riser," police Capt. Tom
Hall said. "He knew what he was
doing."
Police said they opened fire
because they feared Nelson was
preparing to steer the tank into
oncoming traffic. "We had no
other options," Hall said.
The tank's weapons — a 105
mm cannon, 12.7 mm anti-air
craft gun and 7.62 mm machine
gun — were not loaded, Army
Maj. Ed Gale said.
Nelson was on active duty
from 1978 to 1980, including
stints at Fort Knox, Ky., Fort
Dix, N.J., and Mannheim, Ger
many, the Army said.

Neighbors said Nelson's life
had been crumbling recently. His
house was apparently in foreclo
sure, his utilities had been shut
off and he had recently broken up
with his girlfriend. His water was
turned off Wednesday, just
before the rampage.
Nelson also had a history of
medical problems, including a
broken back from a motorcycle
accident.
His small gray house isn't far

( from the armory, where neighbor
; Bob Belton said children often
play on the nine tanks.
; Most of the 20 people who
> work at the armory had gone
> home for the day and it was not
; known how many people were on
site when Nelson drove in
f through an open gate.
i "It's a public building," said
; Maj. Ed Gale of the National
Guard Armory. "We've never had
any threat or challenges before."
