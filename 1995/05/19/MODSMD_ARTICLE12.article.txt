# House passes GOP budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Tri
umphant Republicans pushed a
historic budget through the House
yesterday that would halt decades
of federal deficits, slash spending
and bestow the biggest tax break
since the Reagan era.
By a near party-line vote of
238-193, lawmakers approved a
plan they said would wring an
unprecedented $1.4 trillion in sav
ings from budgets over the next
seven years. Medicare and Medi
caid would take the biggest hits
and hundreds of other programs
would be eliminated, but the sting
would be soothed for some by $350
billion worth of tax breaks for
families, corporations and
investors.
As a down payment, House
Republicans later won passage of a
bill paring $16.4 billion from pre
viously enacted budgets. That bill
to immediately cut $6 billion from
housing programs, $2 billion from
airport improvements, $1.5 billion
from the Environmental Protec
tion Agency and $875 million from
school programs passed 235-189.
Down the hall, the Senate com
menced a week-long debate on its
own $961 billion seven-year bud
get-balancing measure that for
now lacks tax reductions. Passage
there is certain, too. But for the

moment, the focus was on the
House, where more conservative
members have propelled the
Republican drive to transform fed
eral priorities.
President Clinton issued a terse
statement in which he said the
House plan "fails to meet that
test" of a disciplined budget that
reduces the deficit and reflects
American values.
"It slashes Medicare to pay for
tax cuts for the wealthy, reduces
crucial investments in education
and raises taxes on working peo
ple," Clinton said. "There is a
right way and wrong way. This is
the wrong way."
As the final roll call was under
way, a line of Republican lawmak
ers snaked up the steps to the
speaker's desk so Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., could autograph
copies of the budget that claimed
it would lead to a surplus in 2002,
the first since 1969. Even Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
and Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
visited the House to watch the roll
call on final passage.
Six months after the GOP cap
tured control of Congress on
pledges to control the deficit and
shrink government, Republicans
trumpeted that their package

would deliver just that, to the ben
efit of ordinary Americans.
"The 21st century is about the
power of the individual, not the
power of bureaucracy or the power
of red tape," said the plan's chief
architect, House Budget Commit
tee Chairman John Kasich, It-
Ohio.
As they have for weeks,
Democrats protested that the
Republican blueprints would cru
elly siphon money from Medicare,
Medicaid and other programs for
the elderly and poor to help pro
vide tax cuts to the well-to-do.
"Republicans are trying to sell
the idea to the American people
that you can make massive cuts in
programs and give big tax breaks
to the wealthy in this country and
nobody will feel it," scoffed Rep.
Jim McDermott, D-Wash.
But Republicans used the occa
sion to try to reap credit for being
alone in trying to end deficits.
"One team favors bigger gov
ernment, larger bureaucracy and
higher taxes," taunted Gingrich in
a breakfast speech to the National
Association of Manufacturers.
"The other team favors smaller
government, less bureaucracy and
lower taxes. Now I'm fairly com
fortable giving the American peo
ple in the '96 election that choice."
