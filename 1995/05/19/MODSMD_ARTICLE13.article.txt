Chirac picks cabinet
PARIS (AP) â€” The new French Cabinet
named yesterday includes a record number of
women, an Olympic hurdles champion and some
tongue-twisting new portfolios reflecting France's
complex social problems.
There is a minister for Solidarity Between Gen
erations, another for Neighborhoods in Difficulty,
a third for Integration and the Fight Against
Exclusion.
But behind the awkward-sounding names is a
clear signal from the new president, Jacques
Chirac, and his premier, Alain Juppe, that they

are ready to experiment as they work to reduce
unemployment and ease social tension.
"We're going to get to work very quickly and
strongly," Juppe said in a radio interview. "This is
a declaration of war against unemployment."
He said "concrete measures" would be pro
posed next week, probably dealing with incentives
to businesses to hire long-term unemployed peo
ple.
Though both leaders are from the conservative
Rally for the Republic party, their government
will be assessed by the public on its ability to carry
out at least some of the sweeping proposals Chirac
made during the election campaign.
