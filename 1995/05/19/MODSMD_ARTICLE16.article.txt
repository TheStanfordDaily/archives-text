The Observer-magazine
merger raises questions
on information control

AFTER ABOUT two decades
of independently serving
Stanford alumni, Stanford
magazine and the University pub
lished Stanford Observer may
merge to form a single publication
for alumni.
The major decision on the
merger will come this weekend,
when the board of directors of the
Alumni Association will vote on
whether to dissolve Stanford
magazine and merge it into the
University's publications system.
As of now, the magazine comes
out quarterly and is published by
the Alumni Association. The
Observer is a short tabloid pub
lished every other month by Stan
ford News Service.
The Alumni Association's
board needs to consider carefully
whether it wants to make this
move. Indeed, as a joint merger,
both sides must be wary to ensure
campus is better served by a new
publication and not deprived of
information.
The main concern is whether
the change will affect the amount
of information available to Stan
ford's alumni. The new publica
tion, if created, would come out
six times per year, whereas the
currently separate publications
are distributed a combined 10
times annually. If one entity is to
replace the two, it should have
enough editorial space to hold all
the information that is presently
disseminated.
A new publication should also
try to maintain the diversity of
styles now available. Between the
Observer and magazine, gradu
ates can read news, features,
short tidbits and longer articles.
If created, a new publication
should try not to have too
homogenous a format or view
point for every article.

All areas of the University
should be covered by the new pub
lication. The plan is for News Ser
vice writers to focus on campus
affairs while magazine writers
focus on alumni affairs. This
would be a fine solution. The
main objective should be to
ensure all the communities cov
ered now are still addressed after
any merger.
There is a final fear that some
have expressed about the merger
— editorial independence. Several
members of Stanford's publishing
circles have whispered sugges
tions that a new publication will
bring the editorial content of the
formerly-independent magazine
under administrative control. A
few people have suggested this is
the main reason for the merger.
Is this a fear? Yes. But realisti
cally, the information that alumni
and others on campus receive will
most likely change very little. Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
will probably not sit before every
galley with a blue pencil, shaping
article content to his fancy.
Nevertheless, as a University
publication, the new journal
would be officially speaking for
Stanford. That means some
issues might have to be framed in
delicate ways or ignored for a
time, a matter that would affect
an independent magazine less.
Presumably, the editorial focus
will naturally narrow as one orga
nization takes over for two. Not
through any grand conspiracy,
simply because one publisher has
replaced two, certain types of sto
ries that are now published might
be de-emphasized and eventually
fall by the wayside. If the publica
tions unite, though, editors must
be careful to maintain a tolerance
for considering all types of ideas
and stories.
The bottom line is that alumni
need a lot of good information in a
convenient, well-produced pack
age. If a merger is the best way to
achieve this goal, so be it. But it is
best to address all reservations
before any final decision is made.
