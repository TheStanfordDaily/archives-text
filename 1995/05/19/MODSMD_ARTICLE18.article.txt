## How cute — what breed is it? 
### 
DING DING is my dog. She is a
puppy. I found her, a stray, wan
dering on Ken ding beach at the
southern tip of Taiwan during spring
break.
She is a mutt — beautiful and intelli
gent. She has short fur, black and tan.
She weighed only five pounds then and
about twice that now; her face has
changed shape and color, growing longer
and losing a cute black mask over the
eyes. She looks like a miniature version
of a large dog that barks, rather than an
annoying small dog that merely yaps.
The veterinarian estimates that she will
grow to about a dozen pounds maximum.
She was vaccinated overseas. She had
her own doggie passport showing that
she had received the necessary shots.
On the airplane returning to the
States, the flight attendants were espe
cially nice. While I slept, they played
with the baby. While the other passen
gers slept, they allowed her to run up
and down the aisle.
At customs, the officers asked me a
few questions about my right to entry.
Then, they confiscated the doggie kibble
— no dried meat products allowed in the
country. Surprisingly, they did not trou
ble with the live animal.
Before adopting Ding Ding, I had read
the treatise by monks on the art of rais
ing puppies. Along the way, I also have
read the best-selling "Hidden Life of
Dogs" and the controversial "The Intelli
gence of Dogs." Somehow, however,

these books did not quite prepare me for
the challenges of puppy parenthood. I
can talk happily with other owners about
premium dog food, stool samples, the
relationship between the two, fleas,
ticks, mites, collars, retractable leashes,
kennels, sleeping patterns, barking,
sniffing, biting and numerous other
aspects of canine life, but I cannot seem
to follow the advice I receive in return
from these veterans about training an
obedient pet.
Most important, I have had trouble
establishing that I am the dominant
individual in the pack. Ding Ding likes to
carry the leash in her mouth and tug on
it when we are walking — a sign, I
understand, that she is challenging my
leadership.
I might be spoiling Ding Ding. She
owns dozens of treats, ranging from real
cow hooves to plastic bones with artifi
cial meat scent, and she is consuming a
whole pig's ear every other day.
Nonetheless, she is housebroken,
with a few minor mishaps here and
there. She has learned how to sit if I
have food in my hand. She has been
socializing with people as well as other
dogs. According to the literature, young
dogs give off pheromones to indicate
their age. (Ding Ding wears an herbal
flea collar, giving her a constant minty
odor; she also takes breath freshener in
her morning meal. No detail of the dog's
life is too trivial.) So far, adult dogs have
been tolerant of her hyperactivity, even

if they themselves have shown less
enthusiasm about running around in cir
cles.
Despite an occasional misunderstand
ing, she has been popular with human
beings. As numerous people have point
ed out — some of them rather enviously
— there is no better way to meet people.
However, the dog has yet to learn that
some folks are not fond of animals.
Naively, she greets virtually everyone as
a potential playmate.
So far canine companionship has been
wonderful. The relationship is as com
plex as that which evolves between many
members of our species. Perhaps that is
why there are statutes that permit elder
ly residents of public housing to share
their homes with dogs, even if there are
other laws to the contrary.
I plan to buy a duffel bag with mesh
sides so that the doggie can sneak into
movies and the like; I'll attach the bag
with bungee cords to the back of my
motorcycle so that she can ride along
safely. I would like to bring her to the
office at work, where she can sleep quiet
ly in the corner, or maybe inside a filing
cabinet.
I look forward to introducing Ding
Ding to many more friends.

commonly asked, questions about Ding
