Oklahoma City bomb: a look at how crime serves society

THE ABOMINABLE act of terror
ism that ripped through Oklahoma
City last month has left in its wake
a vast and tangled complex of hypothesis
concerning what the ultimate "meaning"
of the event may be.
Sociologists postulate that it symbol
izes, in sharp relief, the death of the
American heartland; criminologists
insist that it is about the rising tide of
violence in American society and the
concomitant decline of public trust
placed in our governmental agencies;
historians tell us that it is about the con
tinuing drama of U.S. democracy and
the historic struggle to balance civil lib
erties against interests of national secu
rity; and legalists argue that it is about

nothing less than the quest for truth
and justice.
Amid all the sound and fury, howev
er, there has yet to be proffered a theory
concerning what the bombing, as a sin
gular criminal act in itself, may repre
sent.
Now, anyone who has taken an intro
ductory sociology course here at Stan
ford has certainly been introduced to the
works and ideas of the classical French
sociologists Emile Durkheim. If
Durkheim were here with us today in
our moment of crisis, surely he would
tell us that crime performs a natural and
necessary function in society.
In the Rules of Sociological Method
(1895), Durkheim made the shocking

observation that crime was a natural
human activity — "an integral part of all
healthy societies." However, it was three
years earlier in his seminal work, "The
Division of Labor in Society," that
Durkheim first hypothesized that crime
performs a basic service to society by
pulling individuals together in a com
mon posture of outrage and indignation.
The criminal (i.e., the terrorist) has
clearly transgressed a specific rule of
law that the rest of society holds invio
late; when the citizens come together to
express outrage over the offense, there
develops a stronger bond of solidarity
than existed before. Crime, as
Durkheim tells us, therefore serves to
make people more aware of what they

share in common, and unless the
relentless passage of time is occasional
ly interrupted by instances of criminali
ty, social organization would be impos
sible.
Today, as our nation shifts through
the tangled debris of human emotion
and despair, perhaps we can find in
Durkheim's words a small shard of hope
to which to cling — that the spirit of
human compassion and solidarity will
inevitably triumph over even the most
base and vile acts of human destruction.
It may not sound like much, but it may
just be all that we have.
