# Free South Africa Fund balance is turned over to the Amy Biehl Fund
## Peaceful resolution 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
The University receives thou
sands of donations every year;
generally only those in the mil
lions attract much attention. But
when Jonathan Reider presented
a much smaller sum to the Office
of Development, its importance
was far greater than its dollar
value.
Reider, an associate director of
undergraduate admissions, re
cently turned over to the Univer
sity's Amy Biehl Fund the $7,234
that had accumulated in the Free
South Africa Fund. Reider has
been president of the fund's board
since 1992.
A group of students created the
Free South Africa Fund in May
1986 amid controversy over the
University's investments in
South Africa. Students were
asked to contribute to this fund in
lieu of making donations to the
University. The fund would then
be held in trust until the Universi

ty divested completely or
apartheid had come to an end.
"Apartheid was unraveling
over a fair stretch of time," said
Reider. But the fund's board
wanted to wait until it was clear
that the changes in South Africa
were irreversible, he said. "We
didn't want to go out of business
too quickly."
"We had to decide if the free
elections were a cue to bring the
fund to a close," said Julie Taylor,
a member of the fund's board and
also an associate director of un
dergraduate admissions, who was
involved with the divestment
movement as an undergraduate
here.
According to Reider, the board
considered using the money to
create a library fund for books on
African studies or creating a re
serve fund to aid South African
students at Stanford. Ultimately,
the board decided to give the
money to the Biehl fund, which
was created to help fund Stanford
students who wish to do research
or service work in South Africa.
Biehl, a 1989 Stanford gradu
ate in international relations, was
killed in August 1993 while in
South Africa to research women's
rights and educate voters for last
year's all-race election.
"We wanted to make sure that
we captured the spirit in which
the fund was established. We
decided that the Amy Biehl Fund
was the appropriate mechanism,"
said Taylor.
"Just as the beginning of the

fund had meaning, we wanted the
closing to have meaning," she
added.
In the mid-1980s, divestment
was a hot issue at universities
nationwide and at Stanford
specifically. "Old Union was
taken over. . . there were protests
in the Quad," Taylor said.
The fund was created to pro
vide pro-divestment students
with some measure of financial
leverage over the University, she
added.
The University followed a poli
cy of partial divestment, but never
divested completely. "Divestment
was moved to the back burner
over time," Taylor said. "The fund
lost its force because divestment
became less of an issue... . The

freedom of South Africa was
always an issue."
"If the University, on the
whole, had divested, this would be
a great celebration. As it is, it's
just a small token," said William
Masters, who was involved in the
fund's founding when he was an
undergraduate and is now an
assistant professor of agricultural
economics at Purdue University.
"It's a good thing that Ithe
money 1 is going to the Amy Biehl
Fund. The idea was that it would
go to the University," Masters
said. The specific recipient of the
money "was deliberately unspeci
fied" because the fund's founders
realized that the situation would
change over time, he said.
When the fund was founded it

was considered unlikely that
either condition — the Universi
ty's complete divestment or the
end of apartheid — would occur
in a reasonable period of time.
Accordingly, it was stipulated
that if neither had occurred after
10 years, the money would be
donated to groups working
against apartheid.
Now that the money has been
turned over to the University, the
fund's board believes that the
donation to the Biehl fund will
help keep alive the goals of the
founders of the Free South Africa
Fund.
"This closed an important
chapter in Stanford's history
without letting the issue die out
completely," Reider said.
