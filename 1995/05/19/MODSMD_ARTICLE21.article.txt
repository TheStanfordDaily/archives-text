## Ronald Hilton The 						founding of the United Nations: memories of 1945 
### 
OF THE Ameri
cans who, 50
years ago, took
part in the 1945 San
Francisco conference
which established the
United Nations, very
few survive. Participat
ing as a modest observ
er for Stanford Univer-

sity, I had the advantage of being a free
spirit, engaging the delegates in candid
conversations.
First, we must recreate the public
mood during World War 11. The war was
won thanks to the bravery and sacrifices
of millions, but it was a monstrous
demonstration of humanity's folly and
brutality. First, the folly. I was on the
faculty of the University of British
Columbia at the time of Pearl Harbor,
which was to provide one more example
of the hubris of aggressive nations, like
Nazi Germany and imperial Japan,
whose miscalculations have led to their
destruction.
I had risen to the glorious rank of sec
ond lieutenant in the Canadian Army,
which decided that I would be less use
less teaching. At this time came an invi
tation from Stanford University. Driving
through California, I took a photograph,
and was promptly arrested by a suspi
cious deputy sheriff, who thought I was a
Nazi spy. I was released, being an officer
in the Canadian Army. Stanford was
busy training officers. I was assigned the
job of teaching Italian language, culture
and politics in preparation for the inva
sion of Italy. Having successfully com
pleted the course, my large class was
promptly shipped off for the invasion of
Japan. Was this the result of a clerical
error or of high strategy?
The foolishness of war was com
pounded by its brutality. The brunt was
borne by Britain. Americans at home felt
little of it; a lone Japanese submarine off
the California coast triggered fears of a
Japanese invasion. Franklin D. Roo
sevelt and Churchill laid the groundwork
for the United Nations; Roosevelt
dreamed that its creation would be the
crowning of his career, but he died on
April 12, 1945.
I was giving a public lecture at the
time; the audience, like the nation,
indeed the world, was stunned. It was
left to Harry Truman to assume the
leadership in the creation of the United
Nations, but he was generally viewed as
little more than a ward politician. Could

he rise to the occasion? The big U.S. fig
ure at the conference was Secretary of
State Edward Stettinius, who out of the
blue had selected San Francisco as its
site. Later there was a proposal to estab
lish the U.N. headquarters in the Stan
ford hills, but the Europeans objected
that the Bay Area was too far away; most
of the delegations had arrived by train.
As editor of "Who's Who in Latin
America," I had traveled all over Latin
America and knew many of the leading
personalities. When fascism seemed to
be the wave of the future, many of them
had supported or sympathized with the
Axis; Brazil was the only country to
make a real contribution to the allied

war effort. Others, conspicuously
Argentina, notoriously supported the
Axis, but when its defeat was certain, all
declared war on it; Argentina waited
until March 1945. They thus ensured
their place at the San Francisco assem
bly, which was largely a Latin American
meeting. Of the 50 charter members, 20
were Latin American. Spanish was made
one of the four official languages, togeth
er with English, French and Russian.
Chinese was not, even though China was
one of the Big Five.
The situation was complicated by the
fight over the Permanent Members' veto
power. Australia's Herbert V. Evatt led
the fight of the little powers against it.
The role of the Latin American states
was ambiguous. They did not want to
lose their place in the sun (Brazil had
withdrawn from the League of Nations
because it was refused a permanent seat
on its council), but they did not wish to
alienate the now-dominant United
States. Tom Connally, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
was so incensed by the attitude of the
small powers that, at a rough meeting
with their delegates, he tore up a copy of
the charter. They gave in.
To reassert their role in the founding
of the U.N., the Latin American govern
ments later arranged for the Organiza
tion of American States to hold a com

memorative meeting in San Francisco. I
invited the Latin American delegates to
visit Stanford. At a San Francisco recep
tion, I told the Ambassador of Somoza's
Nicaragua that I looked forward to see
ing him at Stanford. He replied that he
was not coming, since he feared that
Stanford students would assassinate
him. I reassured him that Stanford stu
dents were not that bloody-minded, so he
came, but even at a reception in my
house he was flanked by two gun-toting
guards. When a girl innocently popped
open a champagne bottle behind his
back, the two wheeled around and point
ed their guns at her. Quite a party!
THE REAL PROBLEM at the 1945
meeting was the Russians, led by
V. M. Molotov. They had good rea
son to complain, especially about the
admission of Argentina. They accused
the United States of trying to stack the
United Nations with puppet Latin Amer
ican states. They claimed that every one
of the states of the USSR should be rep
resented, a demand which the U.S.
rejected. A compromise was finally
reached by which three of them would be
represented: the Russian Federation,
Ukraine and Belarus.
Molotov came branded as the butcher
of the kulaks, which is an insult to
butchers. I had a talk with him at the
1955 decennial meeting, held in San
Francisco like the 1995 event, to com
memorate the founding of the U.N. He
came to a small reception flanked by
thuggish bodyguards. 1 tried to engage
him in conversation about Vashili Vav
ilov and his important work on Andean
potato varieties growing at high alti
tudes, and therefore adaptable to high
Russian latitudes; they would be of great
importance to the Russian diet. Stanford
library has his important works on this
subject, and I thought Molotov would be
interested. However, despite my repeat
ed efforts, all I got from him was a puz
zled "kartoffel?" ("potato?"). He clearly
had no idea what 1 was talking about. In
general delegates properly shunned him
as a bloodthirsty, bull-headed thug.
This was the general view of him at
the 1945 conference, where he created a
problem as soon as the steering commit
tee met. Since the United States was the
host country, Stettinius was to be the
chairman of the conference. Molotov
objected and threatened that the Soviet
Union would withdraw unless the chair
manships were made rotating. Anthony

Eden found a compromise. At Yalta,
Stalin had agreed to a limited veto
power. Molotov now revived the original
Soviet demand for a total veto power.
Truman sent Harry Hopkins to Moscow,
and Stalin told Molotov to accept Eden's
compromise.
An unexpected crisis arose at the
final grand ceremony on June 26 when
President Truman addressed the con
ference. He had flown in the previous
day in the presidential plane, named
"The Sacred Cow." Delegates were dis
creetly silent about this bovine name.
For nine weeks the delegates had fought
over each of the 110 articles until agree
ment was reached. Normally the final
session would have culminated in a for
mal approval of the charter by acclama
tion.
Lord Halifax, the presiding officer,
must have had some wind of the impend
ing problem when he said that, in view of
the importance of the charter, each
country's delegate should rise individu
ally and cast his vote. Molotov had left
San Francisco in order to saddle his
deputy Andrei Gromyko with the nasty
task of casting not a vote but a veto.
When his turn came, he shocked every
one by saying that the charter was
incompatible with the Soviet constitu
tion, which allows any member state to
withdraw from the USSR if it wished
(tell that to the Baltic states, etc.!).
Harking back to the withdrawal of the
Axis powers from the League of Nations,
the United Nations Charter included a
clause saying that a nation could with-

draw but might be subject to censure for
so doing. Gromyko's objection was really
an expression of Soviet suspicion of the
United Nations; it wanted to be able to
withdraw without incurring censure. The
clause was dropped, and the Charter was
approved. The deletion was a good thing,
since the U.S. Senate had blocked U.S.
membership in the League of Nations.
This time it approved the charter of the
United Nations by a vote of 90 to 2.
Recent years have not been kind to
the U.N., widely viewed in this country
as being dominated numerically by coun

tries whose contributions consist largely
of demands upon the U.N. and therefor*

the negative publicity, especially amour

that they had nothing to do with tht

to say if its has increased or diminished

Actually, few people are well-informed
about the U.N. and its specialized agen
cies. Despite the misuse of UNESCO,
these have done much good work. How
ever, U.S. support for them may well
have declined at a time when even the
U.S. Geological Survey's very existence
is in question.
Urgently needed is a serious and
objective ongoing study of the U.N. and
of these agencies. For this reason, the
Stanford-based California Institute of
International Studies, whose member
ship includes leading specialists from a
wide range of fields, plans to conduct
such a study, using the worldwide links
provided by the Internet. It will be head
ed by Abraham Sofaer, former professor
of law at Columbia University and coun
sel to the State Department. He is now a
Fellow of both the Hoover Institution
and of the California Institute of Inter
national Studies.
We will provide more information as
the study progresses. We are especially
interested in those who have worked for
the U.N. or any of its specialized agencies
and who can therefore give us first-hand
information and assessments. If they
wish to participate in this study, they are
invited to get in touch with me by snail
mail or e-mail (hilton@hoover.stan
ford.edu).

Ronald Hilton is professor emeritus of
humanities and sciences at Stanford
University and president of the Califor
nia Institute of International Studies. He
is also a visiting scholar at the Hoover
Institution.
