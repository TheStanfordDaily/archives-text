# Corry gets free speech award
## 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
Stanford alumnus Rob Corry recently received the
Bill Farr Freedom of Information Award in recogni
tion of his efforts to challenge the University's speech
code.
In May 1994, while still at Stanford Law School,
Corry and eight other students filed suit against the
University. They claimed that Stanford's speech
code — which prohibited students from making
inflammatory statements based on race, sex, handi
cap, religion or sexual orientation — violated both
the U.S. Constitution and California law.
A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge struck
down Stanford's speech code in a precedent-setting
decision in March. The University has decided not to
appeal the court's decision.
The award is presented annually by the California
Society of Newspaper Editors, an organization for
newspaper editors and journalism educators.
Farr was a former reporter for the Los Angeles

Times and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner. He
spent 46 days in jail in 1972 for refusing to divulge
sources for a story he wrote during the 1969 Charles
Manson trial.
Corry said it was a "great honor to win the award
because "Bill Farr was a deeply principled man who
had a strong amount of respect for the First Amend
ment."
"That was the same principle we were seeking to
uphold in our suit. That principle is only as strong as
the successive generations' ability and desire to fight
for it. Freedom does not come free," Corry said.
Bob Rawitch, the society's president, said in a state
ment that Corry made "extraordinary efforts to pro
mote open thought and speech."
Cony, in return, praised the members of the society
for their "commitment to freedom of speech issues."
"I have deep respect for the group after meeting
them," he added.
Corry is currently an attorney with the Pacific
Legal Foundation, a non-profit law firm in Sacra
mento.
