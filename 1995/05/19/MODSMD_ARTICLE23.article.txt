### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
The NCAA Rookie of the Year's year ended yes
terday in Athens, Ga.
No. 10-ranked and seventh-seeded Scott
Humphries was upset in the second round of the
NCAA Men's Individual Tennis Championships
by unranked Enrique Abaroa of Kansas, 6-3, 6-4.
It was the second upset in as many days of a Stan
ford player, as No. 41-ranked Paul Goldstein fell
in a first round three-setter last Wednesday.
For both Cardinal freshman, mental fatigue or
just sheer letdown set in after winning the NCAA
Team Championship last Tuesday over Mississip
pi at the University of Georgia's Henry Field Sta
dium.
"Paul just didn't have the mental stamina on
Wednesday, and Scottie didn't have it today," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould. "Scottie got
down a break fairly early and just never got it
back."
No. 6-ranked and No. 4-seeded Jeff Salzenstein
cruised through his second round match, defeat
ing unranked Marc Bauer of Colorado, 6-3, 6-0.
"Jeff got through his match well today," Gould
said.
Competition is sure to be a lot stiffer for the
Cardinal's lone remaining entry tomorrow. The
junior captain will face off against Miami's Srdjan
Muskatirovic, a former top-ranked singles player
nationally.
