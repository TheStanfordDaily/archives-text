Stanford freshman Ania
Bleszynski advanced to the third
round of the NCAA Women's
Tennis Singles Championships
yesterday by defeating No. 44-
ranked Marianne Vallin of
UNLV, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3 in the tie
breaker).
In addition, Stanford's No. 1
doubles team (ranked 10th
nationally) of Bleszynski and
sophomore Katie Schlukebir
downed William and Mary's 20th
ranked duo of Johanna Sones and
Michelle O 6-1, 7-5. A short while
later, the Cardinal's No. 2 squad
of sophomore Emily Burt and

fourth-year junior Kin Shasby
beat Tennessee's Manisha Malho
tra and Melissa Zimpfer, 7-6(7-4),
6-4.
The singles match was marked
by its relative lack of breaks of
serve. Bleszynski was broken
once in the first set, but broke
Vallin twice, including the eighth
game to go up 5-3. In the second
set, there were no breaks â€”
unusual in collegiate tennis. How
ever, Bleszynski controlled the
tie-breaker.
"I have to admit, I was pretty
nervous in the second set, because
the pressure was on me every
game to tie," she said. "Serving at
5-6, I was even more nervous.
That was a big game to win, to

force the tie-breaker."
"It was a good day," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"I thought Ania may have played
her single best match of the year
in defeating Vallin."
With the victory, Bleszynski
moves into the round of 16 and
becomes an automatic All-Ameri
can selection. However, even had
she lost this second match,
Bleszynski would have been
selected as she is ranked 19th in
the nation (the top-20 ranked
players reach All-American sta
tus) and was seeded in the Nos. 9
to 16 grouping at the tourney (the
top-16 seeded players reach Ail-
