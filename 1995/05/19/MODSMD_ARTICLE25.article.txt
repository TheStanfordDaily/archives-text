# Senior third baseman Steve Carver has been on fire
## At home on the hot corner 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
You would have had a tough
time telling Steven Carver that
he was a lucky man after last
year's professional baseball
draft.
But today you don't even have
to mention it to him. This 6-3,
220-pound senior third baseman
for the 17th-ranked Stanford
baseball squad is well aware of
his rising stock and good fortune
over the past 12 months. And
after having been passed up in
the draft following his junior
year, Carver has become prime
draft material and will definitely
get a good long look from a num
ber of professional teams.
"[Steve's] been one of our
team's leaders, having played
four years for us, and that was
the number one thing we needed
from him," Cardinal coach Mark
Marquess said.
His statistics leave no ques
tion as to why he is the pick of
the Cardinal litter. This season
he is hitting .325 with 36 runs
scored and 60 RBIs. He has got
ten on base 40 percent of the
time and has a .550 slugging per
centage. And that's not to men
tion his 16 doubles, two triples
and eight home runs.
Carver became one of the
boys of summer before he start
ed kindergarten. "I first started
playing baseball when I was
five," he said. "It was something
my dad got me into."
His uncle was a pitcher for
the St. Louis Cardinals, and
young Steven Carver liked to
hang out with him and watch
him play.
"He taught me a lot when I
was younger," Carver said. "I
tried to use those things I
learned to progress as I moved
along."
But Carver's success in Amer
ica's pastime has come from his
interest and dedication to the
game.

"I've always enjoyed the
game, and I like the fact that
success doesn't come very easi
ly," Carver said. "It's a lot more
of a skill. You can't just walk
into it with brute strength and

expect to do well. You are going
to fail seven out of 10 times [at
the plate], and that takes a lot of
discipline and determination.
