# Senior third baseman Steve Carver has been on fire
## At home on the hot corner 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
You would have had a tough
time telling Steven Carver that
he was a lucky man after last
year's professional baseball
draft.
But today you don't even have
to mention it to him. This 6-3,
220-pound senior third baseman
for the 17th-ranked Stanford
baseball squad is well aware of
his rising stock and good fortune
over the past 12 months. And
after having been passed up in
the draft following his junior
year, Carver has become prime
draft material and will definitely
get a good long look from a num
ber of professional teams.
"[Steve's] been one of our
team's leaders, having played
four years for us, and that was
the number one thing we needed
from him," Cardinal coach Mark
Marquess said.
His statistics leave no ques
tion as to why he is the pick of
the Cardinal litter. This season
he is hitting .325 with 36 runs
scored and 60 RBIs. He has got
ten on base 40 percent of the
time and has a .550 slugging per
centage. And that's not to men
tion his 16 doubles, two triples
and eight home runs.
Carver became one of the
boys of summer before he start
ed kindergarten. "I first started
playing baseball when I was
five," he said. "It was something
my dad got me into."
His uncle was a pitcher for
the St. Louis Cardinals, and
young Steven Carver liked to
hang out with him and watch
him play.
"He taught me a lot when I
was younger," Carver said. "I
tried to use those things I
learned to progress as I moved
along."
But Carver's success in Amer
ica's pastime has come from his
interest and dedication to the
game.

"I've always enjoyed the
game, and I like the fact that
success doesn't come very easi
ly," Carver said. "It's a lot more
of a skill. You can't just walk
into it with brute strength and

expect to do well. You are going
to fail seven out of 10 times [at
the plate], and that takes a lot of
discipline and determination.

Steve Carver has posted big numbers in his fourth year on the
Farm after being overlooked in last year's major league draft.
It's really a challenge and it's some
thing that has always appealed to
me.
Carver attended The Bolles
School in Jacksonville, Fla., and
starred on his high school varsity
squad for four years. As a senior he
hit .480 with six home runs and 40
RBIs. He was also a versatile field
er and at one time or another
played infield, outfield, and pitcher.
It was not until he came to Stan
ford that he got used to the power
hitter / corner position role.
Playing for Stanford was a child
hood dream for Carver, who had
lived and played ball in the Bay
Area for a while as a youth.
Although he was drafted by the
Boston Red Sox out of high school,
Carver made the tough decision to
attend college.
"I always wanted to come to
Stanford, even before high school,"
he said. "I thought it would be bet
ter to get an education and see if I
could progress in my game, as I feel
that I have, and get a better [look in

thel draft."
As a freshman in 1992, Carver
struggled. He appeared in 12
games and hit only .182 in 11 at
bats. He made tremendous
improvement the next season,
however, appearing in 54 of the 55
games as a sophomore and batting
.311. That year he tied for the team
lead in doubles (13) and collected
36 RBIs.
His performance slipped statisti
cally his junior season. Although he
hit .290 with 32 RBIs, most of his
numbers had dropped from the
previous season. It was for this rea
son that he was unsure what his
draft status would be following last
season. As it turned out, even his
improved play at the end of the sea
son was not enough to get him
drafted.
"At the end of last year, I had a
lot of people tell me to expect a good
draft pick," Carver said. "I was a
little let down [that I wasn't draft
ed), but at the same time I could
always come back and have a
chance to finish my degree here
and improve on my game at Stan
ford."
Carver posits that his non-stel
lar numbers last season, coupled

with the fact that he didn't play a
lot of the corner positions, kept him
out of the big leagues. Following
that disappointment, he decided to
play in the Alaska summer league
and see what improvement he
could make in his play.
Improvement might not be a
strong enough work to describe the
change that Steve Carver under
went under Alaska's midnight sun
light.
"I went up to Alaska thinking I
don't have anything to lose," Carv
er said of his trek north. "As soon
as the summer was over I had a lot
more confidence in myself. I had
pretty much proved it to myself."
That renewed confidence
stemmed from a summer perfor
mance that saw him hit .398 and
collect 17 home runs and 62 RBIs,
leading the league as a member of
the Anchorage Glacier Pilots.
Those stats got him the Alaska
Summer League Player of the Year
award and the National Summer
Player of the Year honors, a feat
matched by such stars as Will
Clark, Rafael Palmeiro, Robin Ven
tura and John Olerud.
"This summer I felt like I pro
duced the way I think I'm capable

of producing," Carver said of his
numbers, which were good enough
to garner him big-league offers at
the end of the summer to go free
agent. "[But the offers) fell short
when compared to coming back to
Stanford. I felt really good about
the team, and I felt like I could real
ly add a lot of things that it needed.
In that respect I wasn't at all hesi
tant about coming back to school."
There's no denying the fact that
it was tough for Carver to turn
down a chance to play major league
baseball.
"I always wanted to play pro
ball," Carver said. "And when
somebody is sitting there offering
you a chance to do it, it's not easy to
turndown."
But he did turn the offer down,
and the result has been an even
greater leap in his pro stock during
this collegiate season. However,
although his personal numbers
have been stellar, the Cardinal
team has been unable to meet high
preseason expectations and will
enter regional competition as the
team that could have been.
"I can only do my part for this
team, and it is frustrating when we
lose games," Carver said of Stan

ford's mediocre 32-21 record. "But
at the same time if I can do what
I'm capable of doing, everybody else
is going to feed off of that and we'll
have success."
"Offensively [Steve] leads our
teams in home runs and RBIs, and
defensively I think he's played as
well at third base as anybody we've
ever had here," Marquess said.
"The biggest thing is that he has
come up with some clutch hits at
the right time. He's had a great
year and if we are going to be suc
cessful in postseason play, he will
be a big part of it."
Stanford's non-conference woes
have hurt the squad this season, as
the Cardinal has dropped 10 of 22
games outside of the Six-Pac; many
of those games were against sub
.soo squads.
"That's just the way this game
goes sometimes," Carver said. "It's
not a lack of effort on our part, but
sometimes we just get snuck up
on."
Carver still has a tremendous
amount of confidence in the ability
of his squad to catch fire going into
postseason play.
"I think this team has gradually
been picking up," Carver said, cit

ing the fact that team roles are set
and every member of the Cardinal
squad knows what he needs to do.
"We've had our low points, but
those have come and gone."
"We play in arguably the best
conference in the nation," he con
tinued. "I really think we have the
possibility of getting into the world
series."
Carver's life in baseball won't
be over when his senior year at
Stanford passes. He has a strong
personal goal of playing profession
al baseball, a goal not at all unrea
sonable following the strides he
has made in his game in the past
10 months. His hope for the future
lies in this year's major league
draft.
"I don't have a lot of bargaining
power because I'm a senior, but at
the same time people tell me that
there aren't many top-rated third
basemen in the draft," Carver said.
"If the draft goes well, then I'll
sign. If not, I'll be glad to take my
degree and go home."
But don't expect to see Steve
Carver out of the game of baseball
any time soon. A man so dedicated
to his passion is not likely to give it
up so easily.

that I have, and get a better [look in

thel draft."
As a freshman in 1992, Carver
struggled. He appeared in 12
games and hit only .182 in 11 at
bats. He made tremendous
improvement the next season,
however, appearing in 54 of the 55
games as a sophomore and batting
.311. That year he tied for the team
lead in doubles (13) and collected
36 RBIs.
His performance slipped statisti
cally his junior season. Although he
hit .290 with 32 RBIs, most of his
numbers had dropped from the
previous season. It was for this rea
son that he was unsure what his
draft status would be following last
season. As it turned out, even his
improved play at the end of the sea
son was not enough to get him
drafted.
"At the end of last year, I had a
lot of people tell me to expect a good
draft pick," Carver said. "I was a
little let down [that I wasn't draft
ed), but at the same time I could
always come back and have a
chance to finish my degree here
and improve on my game at Stan
ford."
Carver posits that his non-stel
lar numbers last season, coupled

with the fact that he didn't play a
lot of the corner positions, kept him
out of the big leagues. Following
that disappointment, he decided to
play in the Alaska summer league
and see what improvement he
could make in his play.
Improvement might not be a
strong enough work to describe the
change that Steve Carver under
went under Alaska's midnight sun
light.
"I went up to Alaska thinking I
don't have anything to lose," Carv
er said of his trek north. "As soon
as the summer was over I had a lot
more confidence in myself. I had
pretty much proved it to myself."
That renewed confidence
stemmed from a summer perfor
mance that saw him hit .398 and
collect 17 home runs and 62 RBIs,
leading the league as a member of
the Anchorage Glacier Pilots.
Those stats got him the Alaska
Summer League Player of the Year
award and the National Summer
Player of the Year honors, a feat
matched by such stars as Will
Clark, Rafael Palmeiro, Robin Ven
tura and John Olerud.
"This summer I felt like I pro
duced the way I think I'm capable

of producing," Carver said of his
numbers, which were good enough
to garner him big-league offers at
the end of the summer to go free
agent. "[But the offers) fell short
when compared to coming back to
Stanford. I felt really good about
the team, and I felt like I could real
ly add a lot of things that it needed.
In that respect I wasn't at all hesi
tant about coming back to school."
There's no denying the fact that
it was tough for Carver to turn
down a chance to play major league
baseball.
"I always wanted to play pro
ball," Carver said. "And when
somebody is sitting there offering
you a chance to do it, it's not easy to
turndown."
But he did turn the offer down,
and the result has been an even
greater leap in his pro stock during
this collegiate season. However,
although his personal numbers
have been stellar, the Cardinal
team has been unable to meet high
preseason expectations and will
enter regional competition as the
team that could have been.
"I can only do my part for this
team, and it is frustrating when we
lose games," Carver said of Stan

ford's mediocre 32-21 record. "But
at the same time if I can do what
I'm capable of doing, everybody else
is going to feed off of that and we'll
have success."
"Offensively [Steve] leads our
teams in home runs and RBIs, and
defensively I think he's played as
well at third base as anybody we've
ever had here," Marquess said.
"The biggest thing is that he has
come up with some clutch hits at
the right time. He's had a great
year and if we are going to be suc
cessful in postseason play, he will
be a big part of it."
Stanford's non-conference woes
have hurt the squad this season, as
the Cardinal has dropped 10 of 22
games outside of the Six-Pac; many
of those games were against sub
.soo squads.
"That's just the way this game
goes sometimes," Carver said. "It's
not a lack of effort on our part, but
sometimes we just get snuck up
on."
Carver still has a tremendous
amount of confidence in the ability
of his squad to catch fire going into
postseason play.
"I think this team has gradually
been picking up," Carver said, cit

ing the fact that team roles are set
and every member of the Cardinal
squad knows what he needs to do.
"We've had our low points, but
those have come and gone."
"We play in arguably the best
conference in the nation," he con
tinued. "I really think we have the
possibility of getting into the world
series."
Carver's life in baseball won't
be over when his senior year at
Stanford passes. He has a strong
personal goal of playing profession
al baseball, a goal not at all unrea
sonable following the strides he
has made in his game in the past
10 months. His hope for the future
lies in this year's major league
draft.
"I don't have a lot of bargaining
power because I'm a senior, but at
the same time people tell me that
there aren't many top-rated third
basemen in the draft," Carver said.
"If the draft goes well, then I'll
sign. If not, I'll be glad to take my
degree and go home."
But don't expect to see Steve
Carver out of the game of baseball
any time soon. A man so dedicated
to his passion is not likely to give it
up so easily.
You would have had a tough
time telling Steven Carver that
he was a lucky man after last
year's professional baseball
draft.
But today you don't even have
to mention it to him. This 6-3,
220-pound senior third baseman
for the 17th-ranked Stanford
baseball squad is well aware of
his rising stock and good fortune
over the past 12 months. And
after having been passed up in
the draft following his junior
year, Carver has become prime
draft material and will definitely
get a good long look from a num
ber of professional teams.
"[Steve's] been one of our
team's leaders, having played
four years for us, and that was
the number one thing we needed
from him," Cardinal coach Mark
Marquess said.
His statistics leave no ques
tion as to why he is the pick of
the Cardinal litter. This season
he is hitting .325 with 36 runs
scored and 60 RBIs. He has got
ten on base 40 percent of the
time and has a .550 slugging per
centage. And that's not to men
tion his 16 doubles, two triples
and eight home runs.
Carver became one of the
boys of summer before he start
ed kindergarten. "I first started
playing baseball when I was
five," he said. "It was something
my dad got me into."
His uncle was a pitcher for
the St. Louis Cardinals, and
young Steven Carver liked to
hang out with him and watch
him play.
"He taught me a lot when I
was younger," Carver said. "I
tried to use those things I
learned to progress as I moved
along."
But Carver's success in Amer
ica's pastime has come from his
interest and dedication to the
game.

"I've always enjoyed the
game, and I like the fact that
success doesn't come very easi
ly," Carver said. "It's a lot more
of a skill. You can't just walk
into it with brute strength and

expect to do well. You are going
to fail seven out of 10 times [at
the plate], and that takes a lot of
discipline and determination.


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Steve Carver has posted big numbers in his fourth year on the
Farm after being overlooked in last year's major league draft.
It's really a challenge and it's some
thing that has always appealed to
me.
Carver attended The Bolles
School in Jacksonville, Fla., and
starred on his high school varsity
squad for four years. As a senior he
hit .480 with six home runs and 40
RBIs. He was also a versatile field
er and at one time or another
played infield, outfield, and pitcher.
It was not until he came to Stan
ford that he got used to the power
hitter / corner position role.
Playing for Stanford was a child
hood dream for Carver, who had
lived and played ball in the Bay
Area for a while as a youth.
Although he was drafted by the
Boston Red Sox out of high school,
Carver made the tough decision to
attend college.
"I always wanted to come to
Stanford, even before high school,"
he said. "I thought it would be bet
ter to get an education and see if I
could progress in my game, as I feel
that I have, and get a better [look in

thel draft."
