# Baseball to face off against UCSB
## Gauchos come to Sunken Diamond 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Rounding third and heading
home, the Stanford baseball
squad will play its final three
games of the regular season this
weekend in a three-game stint
versus the Santa Barbara Gau
chos before beginning postseason
play next week.
The 17th-ranked Cardinal (32-
21 overall, 20-10 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division) will attempt
to exploit the opportunity UCSB
(23-24) has given opponents at
the plate all season. While the
Gauchos put runs on the board
they also give them away — oppo
nents have scored nine or more
points against UCSB in 16 games
this year.
"We don't know much about
them," Cardinal freshman ace
Kyle Peterson said of the Gau
chos. "I heard they have a .320
team batting average and they've
faced pretty good pitching all
year, but we've just got to attack
their guys and make them beat
us."
Head coach Mark Marquess
believes the fact that Stanford
knows little about UCSB might
help the squad in the regionals.
"We don't really know them,
but that's good because that's
what will happen when we go to

regionals," Marquess said. "We
won't know much about those
teams either."
Stanford comes into this week
end's series riding a four-game
winning streak and having won
10 of its last 13 contests. The Car
dinal's sweep of Arizona State last
weekend saw Stanford's bats
come alive as the team scored 29
runs in the three-game series.
"This series is huge," junior
catcher A.J. Hinch said of the
UCSB games. "We're playing well
right now and it would be nice to
go into regionals with a seven
game win streak."
"It's important, but if you
don't play well this weekend, it
doesn't mean you won't play well
in the regionals," Marquess said.
"But you'd much rather go into
the regionals having played two
or three solid games. It's the last
thing you think about before you
go into the postseason, so hope
fully we'll play well."
Peterson will take his 10-1
record and 3.20 ERA to the
mound this afternoon. After earn
ing his fourth Six-Pac Pitcher of
the Week award, the right-hander
was named this week as Co-Six-
Pac Pitcher of the Year and is still
in the running for National
Freshman of the Year honors. He
hurled his sixth complete game of
the year last Saturday against ASU
and became only the second player
in school history to record eight
Six-Pac victories. In addition, he is
one of three freshmen at Stanford
to win 10 games in a single season
(joining Brian Sackinsky in 1990
and Jack McDowell in 1985).
"It's a great honor, but it's also
a little added pressure," Peterson
said of his Six-Pac awards. "People
are going to be gunning for us a lit
tle bit more, as if they wouldn't be
gunning for us anyway."
"For a freshman to be co-pitch
er of a tough league and to do it as
impressively as he has done it Is
quite a feat," Marquess said.
Today's game will not be played

under the new lights hovering over
Sunken Diamond. The decision to
keep the 2:30 p.m. start came
Tuesday after the school decided to
hold off the unveiling of the h<do
gens until next season.
Junior southpaw Mike Robbins
will get the call on Saturday. Rob
bins is 5-3 with a 3.70 ERA in his
18 appearances on the season.
Hot Cardinal bats coming into
this weekend's series include
senior Dusty Allen's six-game hit
ting streak and .360 average, two
home runs, three doubles and nine
RBIs in the stretch. Freshman cen
ter fielder Joe Kilburg has hit safe
ly in 18 of his last 22 games and has
raised his batting average 56
points in the process to .311.
Freshman designated hitter Jon
Schaeffer homered in bis last two
bats at ASU and will look to extend
his four-game hit streak.
Stanford collected another indi

vidual award this week as junior
catcher A.J. Hinch was named Six-
Pac Player of the Week after his
heroics in Sunday's game at Ari
zona State. In that contest, Hinch
returned from being hit in the
mouth by an errant throw to knock
a pinch-hit solo fyome run out of
Packard Stadium and send the
game into extra innings.
The awards kept coming in —
Hinch also earned the Six-Pac's
Co-Player of the Year honor and
senior third baseman Steve Carver
and junior left fielder Cale Carter
were named to the All-Pac-10
team. Ilobbins was selected to the
Honorable Mention All-Pac-10
squad.
"It's obviously a big honor,"
Hinch said. "It's voted on by the
coaches so it's nice to know that
they think highly of your talent.
I'm honored that I got it but I'm
not going to rest on it."
