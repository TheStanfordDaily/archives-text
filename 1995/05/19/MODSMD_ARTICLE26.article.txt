# Baseball to face off against UCSB
## Gauchos come to Sunken Diamond 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Rounding third and heading
home, the Stanford baseball
squad will play its final three
games of the regular season this
weekend in a three-game stint
versus the Santa Barbara Gau
chos before beginning postseason
play next week.
The 17th-ranked Cardinal (32-
21 overall, 20-10 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division) will attempt
to exploit the opportunity UCSB
(23-24) has given opponents at
the plate all season. While the
Gauchos put runs on the board
they also give them away â€” oppo
nents have scored nine or more
points against UCSB in 16 games
this year.
"We don't know much about
them," Cardinal freshman ace
Kyle Peterson said of the Gau
chos. "I heard they have a .320
team batting average and they've
faced pretty good pitching all
year, but we've just got to attack
their guys and make them beat
us."
Head coach Mark Marquess
believes the fact that Stanford
knows little about UCSB might
help the squad in the regionals.
"We don't really know them,
but that's good because that's
what will happen when we go to

regionals," Marquess said. "We
won't know much about those
teams either."
Stanford comes into this week
end's series riding a four-game
winning streak and having won
10 of its last 13 contests. The Car
dinal's sweep of Arizona State last
weekend saw Stanford's bats
come alive as the team scored 29
runs in the three-game series.
"This series is huge," junior
catcher A.J. Hinch said of the
UCSB games. "We're playing well
right now and it would be nice to
go into regionals with a seven
game win streak."
"It's important, but if you
don't play well this weekend, it
doesn't mean you won't play well
in the regionals," Marquess said.
"But you'd much rather go into
the regionals having played two
or three solid games. It's the last
thing you think about before you
go into the postseason, so hope
fully we'll play well."
Peterson will take his 10-1
record and 3.20 ERA to the
mound this afternoon. After earn
ing his fourth Six-Pac Pitcher of
the Week award, the right-hander
was named this week as Co-Six-
Pac Pitcher of the Year and is still
in the running for National
Freshman of the Year honors. He
