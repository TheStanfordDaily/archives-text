# Track in Tucson for Pac-10s
## Team hopes to improve upon 1994 performance 
### Matthew Lawrence Staff writer 
It's championship time.
The Stanford track team starts the first day of
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships today in
Tucson, Ariz., at Roy P. Drachman Stadium at the
University of Arizona. Last year, the men finished
fifth and the women seventh at the championships.
This year, if all goes well, the team should contest
for the fourth or fifth spot in the conference.
The Stanford men have won only three Pac
-10 / Pacific Coast Conference Championships since
1919. At last year's championships, UCLA's men
walked away with top team honors for the fourth
straight time and the Bruin women took the title for
the third-straight year.
In 1994, Stanford's men finished 22.5 points
behind fourth-place California. At the Big Meet two
weeks ago, Cal squeaked by with a win against a
competitive Cardinal team. Look for Stanford to
surprise the Golden Bears with some strong perfor
mances at this meet.
The Oregon Ducks are aided by an early 25 points
from their sweep of the decathlon last weekend.
Stanford enters with three points.
Senior Travis Clark, the 1994 Pac-10 decathlon
champion, competed in the decathlon last weekend
and after the first day was in second place with
3,935 points behind Oregon's Ray Livingston. After
the second day Clark finished with 7,287 points to
take sixth place and three points for his team. On
the way he won the high jump, the 400 meters and
the 1,500-meters. The 7,287 points were a NCAA
provisional qualifying total. Clark will compete in
the high jump, the mile relay and possibly the 400-
meter relay this weekend.
For many seniors on the team, this will be the last
meet they run in cardinal and white — the culmina
tion of four years of competition.
"For a lot of people this is their season," Clark
said. "We're sitting in a position similar to last year
behind UCLA, USC and probably Oregon. People
are excited about the meet. It will be even more
exciting if we can get into the top three. There's
always the possibility that people will really come on
in this meet and perform well."
Clark is one of two returning Pac-10 champions
for Stanford along with senior co-captain Dave
Popejoy, the 1992 hammer throw champion.
Senior co-captain Tovi Abello agreed that this
will be a good meet all around. Abello noted that he
ran his last collegiate workout two days ago and
most likely will not run competitively after this
weekend.
"This meet is sentimental but it's also business as
usual," he said. "We're thinking more of performing
well rather than this being the last meet. Maybe
after the meet it will settle in."
Abello will run in the 110-meters hurdles and
possibly on the 400-meters relay team.
