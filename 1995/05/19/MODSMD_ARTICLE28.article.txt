### Julie Choe Contributing writer 
Both the Stanford men's and
women's crew teams are hopeful
that their season will not come to
an end at the upcoming Pacific 10
Conference Championships. This
year, the Pac-lOs will be hosted
by the Cardinal at Redwood
Shores tomorrow and Sunday.
Tomorrow's action will begin
at 8 a.m. with heats continuing
until 11:30 a.m. After an early
afternoon break, races will
resume at 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. The
boats will return to action Sunday

morning at 8 a.m. until noon for
the finals.
The third-seeded Cardinal
women will face sixth seed UCLA
in the first round of the champi
onships. If all goes according to
plan, they will face top-seeded
Washington in the final on Sun
day. But the Stanford-UCLA win
ner will first have to surpass sec
ond seed Washington State in the
semifinals.
Although Stanford has not
defeated the Cougars this year,
the Cardinal has been steadily
making their move.
"We've made a lot of improve

ments this season and hopefully it
will be enough to meet the chal
lenge," said junior Cara Rice.
"We're pretty eager for the Pac
-10s."
The squad may have the home
court advantage this time around,
but Stanford knows that it will
take more than a familiar crowd
to come home with a victory. The
women need to finish in the top
two at the Pac-lOs in order to
advance to the national champi
onship in Cincinnati on June 10-
11.
"They're fast enough to go [to
nationals]," said head coach Joce
lyn McCandless. "They just have to
put it together and race well. It's
our home course and it's a very fair
race course."
On the men's side, Stanford
drew the four seed and is scheduled
to race off against the fiflh-seeded
squad from Gonzaga. For the Car
dinal, the psychological aspect of
their race will determine whether
the squad qualifies for nationals.
Head coach Wieslaw Kujda
strongly believes that his team has
the physical ability, but he is con
cerned about mental preparation.
"They just have to understand
that preparing for a race is one of
the things that they have to do by
themselves," Kujda said. "It's as
equally hard as a physical change."
Stanford is favored to win its
race against Gonzaga but must fin
ish in the top three for a berth to
nationals.
