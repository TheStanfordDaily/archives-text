### Julie Choe Contributing writer 
Both the Stanford men's and
women's crew teams are hopeful
that their season will not come to
an end at the upcoming Pacific 10
Conference Championships. This
year, the Pac-lOs will be hosted
by the Cardinal at Redwood
Shores tomorrow and Sunday.
Tomorrow's action will begin
at 8 a.m. with heats continuing
until 11:30 a.m. After an early
afternoon break, races will
resume at 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. The
boats will return to action Sunday

morning at 8 a.m. until noon for
the finals.
The third-seeded Cardinal
women will face sixth seed UCLA
in the first round of the champi
onships. If all goes according to
plan, they will face top-seeded
Washington in the final on Sun
day. But the Stanford-UCLA win
ner will first have to surpass sec
ond seed Washington State in the
semifinals.
Although Stanford has not
defeated the Cougars this year,
the Cardinal has been steadily
making their move.
"We've made a lot of improve

ments this season and hopefully it
will be enough to meet the chal
lenge," said junior Cara Rice.
"We're pretty eager for the Pac
-10s."
The squad may have the home
court advantage this time around,
but Stanford knows that it will
take more than a familiar crowd
to come home with a victory. The
women need to finish in the top
two at the Pac-lOs in order to
advance to the national champi
onship in Cincinnati on June 10-
11.
