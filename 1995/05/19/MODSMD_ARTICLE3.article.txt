# Speaker urges more just racial thinking

### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
Arguing that policy makers
must be conscious of race in con
structing a more just vision of so
ciety, Amy Gutmann, a professor
of ethics at Princeton University,
delivered the last of the two Tan
ner Lectures to a crowd of about
110 people in Annenberg Audito
rium yesterday.
Gutmann, whose speech was
sponsored by the Department of
Philosophy and the Ethics in Soci
ety Program, drew a distinction
between two forms of race con
sciousness.
The first and most common
kind, which she termed essential
race consciousness, constructs an
invidious distinction between
groups of individuals along super
ficial traits and appearance, estab
lishing "essential, morally rele
vant differences between people,"
she said.
However, Gutmann argued,
current analysis of the human
genome argues against any con
ception of "race" as commonly un
derstood, indicating that cate

gories such as "black" or "white"
are non-scientific and arbitrary.
By implication, works such as
"The Bell Curve," which purports
to reveal differences in intelli
gence among races, have no basis
in scientific fact, Gutmann added.
And "even if gaps in SAT scores
were genetic — and there is no ev
idence that they are — the argu
ment for affirmative action would
hold, if not with even greater
force."
The second type of race con
sciousness outlined by Gutmann
"entails awareness of superficial
phenotypic differences associated
with race in this society."
"Were we to ignore this, we
would be blind to a basic source of
injustice," she said.
This sort of consciousness
"views race as inessential but as
an ongoing source of social injus
tice," she said, adding that any vi
sion of a just society requires a
conscious recognition of those
groups of people who have suf
fered and continue to suffer from
prejudice.
Citing the works of two well
known black authors, Shelby
Steele and Stephen J. Carter,
Gutmann also addressed the
issue of how some blacks feel
pressure to follow a code of behav
ior — especially if they occupy

higher positions in American soci
ety — or else risk being labeled as
"unauthentic."
Gutmann criticized such a nar
row view of one's obligations to
rectify racial injustice, arguing
that it is "the racial equivalent of
the rich getting richer, the poor
getting poorer," where those most
oppressed are held to the most
stringent standard of behavior.

Operating under a vision of
justice as fairness, Gutmann said
that each individual's action is
based on one's capacity and sta
tion. For this reason, Gutmann
argued, in a racially prejudiced
society, there is a special obliga
tion of blacks not be "free riders"
on those policies designed to cor
rect racial injustice.
Similarly, by virtue of their

more advantaged position in
American society, whites and
middle class blacks have special
obligations.
"If I don't do enough to combat
racial injustice," Gutmann
argued, "I will unintentionally
benefit in a society where many
groups that are disadvantaged
have less than fair opportuni
ties."
