# Life with Seldane: allergies, addictions

ad*dict (ad'ikt) — (1) v. To devote or give (one
self) habitually or compulsively to something.
(2) n. One who is addicted.
So it's my first spring at Stanford, four years
ago, and something strange happens to me.
While all my friends begin to frolic and boink
and jump into empty fountains, I begin to
wheeze. My eyes become crimson. My nose
donates a steady stream of schlooger to a half
dozen boxes of aloed Kleenex. My sinuses swell
and stretch out my hats. Somewhere in between
I sneeze five times in a row and lose all my basic
math skills.
I'm confused. I have no idea what is happen
ing to me. Had I caught one of those viruses
that liquefies your body beginning with ade
noids? Was I being punished for blowing my
ncse in my brother's tennis bandanna? Was I
dying a nerd Hoy's death for some heinous his
taminic crime I didn't commit?
Eyes swollen and my will in its second draft,
I ooze on over to what I think is the Hillel to get
someone to say kaddish over me. Blind from
my sinuses pinching my optic nerve, I end up at
Cowell.
A white blurry figure tells me I am not
dying, but I have allergies. Another white blur
hands me three different bottles filled with
three different kinds of pills. I am told that if I
have a sandwich and then take them I'll be
semi-functional in a few hours.
It worked. And ever since then I have been
chemically dependent.
Without my drugs I cannot take classes in
spring. Without eye drops I cannot read from
March to June. Without 60 mgs. of psue
doephedrine hydrochloride I become a congest
ed prisoner of my two-room double. Without
four drops a day of lodoxamide tromethamine
I'd rub my own eyes down to the retina.
The Seldane is my shepherd, I shall not
want. He rescues me from green pastures. He
quells my snot into still waters. He restores my
soul from allergic Mivion for His name's sake.

Okay hts name is Andre* MArtine/Fonts Thai is his name The Daity has many fontsfcut only one Andre* Martinez-Fonts

Amen.
I'm an addict. It's true. An 87-cent-a-day
seasonal habit that I can't give up and can't
function without. Despite any promises I made
to myself at age 11, for all my purist intentions,
I am nothing without the drugs I considered
myself wholeheartedly above.
Through some low-grade genetic card trick
I've been shuffled an immune system which
confuses ragweed for Nazis and now all I have
to do to bring forth three to seven ounces of vis
cous brain-lube is stick my head out a window.
I have been dethroned by micro-mucous mag
nets from the foothills — minuscule allergens
with no purpose but to pollinate my histamine
vesicles.
Now I had, like the rest of us, been taught
from a fairly early age that addiction implied
fault. An alcoholic was, at best, to be pointed at
and pitied. Look at him pee. Go give him a dol
lar.
Something about that now tickles my appre
ciation for hypocrisy. For when we drop the
labels, it seems there's not as much difference
between "maladaptive them" and "poor inno
cent me" as I'd like to think.
I possess a genetic predisposition for a
hyper-sensitive, boogerlicious system; the envi
ronmental change of moving to California
brought it to life. So now fourteen hours with
out and the beast within manifests its mucoid
destiny.
How is this different, how is this better,
than an alcoholic who was born into her predis
position and an environment full of stress and
pain that shackles her to drink? For her it's
abuse and pain which drives her to drugs, for
me its pollen and snot. In the end, who's exis
tentially worse off?
My stupid systems are gene-advised just the
same, and by that design I need my drugs, not
to enhance, but just to keep my systems at nor
mal, functional levels. I can close my mouth
when I sleep only through the magic time
release tablet I pop dutifully every 12 hours.

Arid "I can quit any time I want" isn't even
a lie I can tell myself knowing the propensity of
my proboscis.
"Yeah, but drugs aren't the same as drugs,"
you say. "One you take to get better, the other
you just, you know, take." What, there's no
compulsive or progressive aspects? There's no
threat of dependency? There's no reward of
pleasure? We don't use them to shut out pain?
And that avoidance doesn't become mainte
nance once those receptors acclimate to your
nouveaux biochemistry?
And its not just Seldane. There are the
countless other drugs and chemicals that have
saved, if not defined, my life. The quarts of
Amoxycillin that prevented my sister from a
dozen or so ear, nose and throat infections that
would have left her dead or deaf or asthmatic,
the 40 mgs. of Mevacor which keeps those moz
zarella sticks from damming my Dad's arteries
and making me an orphan, the two little Cafer
gots which quell my cousin's migraines, the 60
mgs. of the Big C from my morning French
Roast without which I'll need 400 mgs. of
ibuprofen to stave off the headaches.
And let's not forget that shmear of
Nonoxynol-9, which has, at times, kept me out
of a whole host of trouble.
We are a society of chemically dependent
beings. Without them, how many of us would
still be alive?
With drugs we defy evolution. With drugs, I
am a cold sore on the bottom lip of natural
selection. Dependent, but alive, and scarcely
better off than someone who drinks Woolite to
keep i« buzz going. Because if I found snorting
pipe-cieaners kept the sinus-slime at bay, I'd be
there too.
