# Fac Sen: Grad students be wary of poor market
## Doctoral applicants should consider lack of jobs 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate's Planning and Policy Board
recommended yesterday that instead of placing fixed
limits on graduate student enrollment, Stanford
should encourage potential students to make more in
formed choices about their education.
With less financial and political support available
for research, students should know that the job mar
ket cannot accommodate the number of Ph.D.s
awarded each year, Assoc. Director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center Arthur Bienenstock, chair
of the planning board, said at yesterday's senate
meeting.
Bienenstock reported on the progress of the board,
which has nearly finished its three years of work and
will make a final report next fall.
"Each Stanford department should provide
prospective graduate students with information
needed to make intelligent decisions in this era," he
said.
According to Bienenstock, information offered to
students should include the average time needed to
earn a doctoral degree, the potential for financial sup
port while working on the degree and employment
prospects for graduating students.
The board found that providing such information
is a better route for Stanford to take than limiting the
number of graduate students because of the increas
ing number of Ph.D. candidates nationwide, Bienen-

stock said.
"We all came down against that,"
he said. "We may have to limit num
bers of graduate students based on
financial resources, but we will not
do it because of national overpro
duction."
Graduate studies may be expen
sive but the students are valuable,
said Chemistry Prof. John Brau
man, a member of the senate.

By aiding in research and undergraduate educa
tion, graduate students allow the professors to focus
on their own work, which in turn can bring acclaim to
the University, he said.
Despite their value, however, Bienenstock said
that graduate students and University research ac
tivities must be reexamined in light of federal re
search cuts and the increasing number of students
pursuing degrees.
Bienenstock said he worries that "we can't sustain
the University in this form," although "we have a lot
of resources compared to a lot of institutions."
Stanford's future isn't in danger, Provost Con
doleezza Rice said, but she added that "if we don't
make some choices in a period of declining revenue,
we're just pretending to keep the same institution
that we have now."
"You can get yourself to the point [where] you
