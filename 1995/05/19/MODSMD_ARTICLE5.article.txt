# Stanford gets grant to teach geriatrics

### Irene Cua Dy 
Stanford recently received a three-year,
$1.1 million grant to serve as a resource center
to aid seven other distinguished institutions in
instructing their faculty how to better teach
geriatric medicine.
The newly formed Geriatrics in Primary
Care Residency Training Initiative will dis
seminate methods for teaching geriatrics to
primary care residents, expose interns to older
patients while in training and supplement the
knowledge of doctors already treating geriatric
patients, according to Merlynn Bergen, an ed
ucational psychologist at Stanford.
Bergen noted that "the first doctors geri
atric patients often go to for treatment are pri
mary care doctors."
The geriatric initiative — which the New
York-based John A. Hartford Foundation is
funding — is designed to ensure that primary
care interns have contact with geriatric pa
tients in hospitals, home care and convalescent

home settings, Bergen said. Trained geriatri
cians will teach residents the clinical curricu
lum on geriatrics.
Under the initiative, Stanford began serv
ing as an educational resource and dissemina
tion center in January and will continue in that
role until December 1998.
The geriatric grant will require the Stan
ford Faculty Development Program (SFDP) —
which does research to improve teaching
methods — to develop and disseminate geri
atric teaching methods and curricula.
This will make primaiy care doctors and in
terns more aware of the different approach
needed when treating older patients, who
often have more ailments and are more sus
ceptible to infection, Bergen said.
Assoc. Prof, of Geriatric Medicine Carol
Winograd, who is serving as a principal investi
gator for the program, said it is beneficial to
the rest of the Stanford community. Principal
ly, the SFDP's teaching methods can be easily
incorporated into other areas, broadening the

locus of research, Winograd said.
The geriatric grant will also allow the SFDP
to train faculty from the other participating in
stitutions in geriatric care.
The other institutions participating in the
program are Harvard, Johns Hopkins, UCLA,
the University of Chicago, Baylor, the Univer
sity of Rochester and the University of Con
necticut.
These institutions were chosen from among
24 sites that applied to the Hartford Founda
tion because of their strength in geriatrics and
primary practice.
Stanford was chosen to serve as the coordi
nator for the geriatric training because of the
unique dissemination program that the SFDP
employs, said SFDP Director Kelley Skeff, an
associate professor of medicine.
The dissemination approach teaches faculty
from the other institutions to teach their
peers. In this way, the new teaching methods
will reach and help more teachers
and students.
Currently, the dissemination

approach is being used interna
tionally. This approach has
proven itself to be distinguished
across the nation.
The other people that make up
Stanford's researchers
and developers include Georgette
Stratos, a senior research scholar
in general medicine and educa

tional psychology specialist, who
will serve as the project's director;
Bergen, the program's evaluator;
and Cheryl Albright, a specialist
in preventive medicine, who will
ensure that preventive medicine
will be included in the geriatric
curriculum the team is develop
ing.
