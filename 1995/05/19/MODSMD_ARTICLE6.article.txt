# Environmental honors students go green

### Marcus Jackson Contributing writer 
With the introduction of the Environmental
Honors Program a year ago, students from all ma
jors have been working together with faculty to ad
dress worldwide environmental concerns.
Although there were four to five students who
became involved back in 1992, the program was of
ficially started in 1993 when the Faculty Senate
approved it.
The need for this type of program became clear,
according to Program Director Rosamund Naylor,
"because various faculty members at Stanford in
the environmental field were discussing issues
across disciplines and they felt the students should
have that interdisciplinary experience by means of
an honors program."
The program accepts 10 to 12 students each
year and has four faculty members involved: Bio
logical Sciences Profs. Donald Kennedy and
Steven Schneider, Assoc. Prof, of Economics Larry
Goulder and Naylor, a fellow at the Institute for
International Studies. This year, 13 students have
participated.
"This program differs from other honors pro
grams in that it combines students from ... earth
sciences, humanities, sciences and engineering,"
said Naylor, adding that she is not aware of this
kind of inter-school program at any other univer
sity.
Also, unlike other honors programs, "students
have the chance to work in close contact with var
ious faculty members from outside their mfyor de
partment," said Naylor.
Although students from any major may partic
ipate in the program, most students involved come
from civil engineering, earth systems, biology,
human biology or economics mcyors. "However,
we have had students from ethics, philosophy and
anthropology," Naylor added.
Several students have also received small
