# Environmental honors students go green
## 
### Marcus Jackson Contributing writer 
With the introduction of the Environmental
Honors Program a year ago, students from all ma
jors have been working together with faculty to ad
dress worldwide environmental concerns.
Although there were four to five students who
became involved back in 1992, the program was of
ficially started in 1993 when the Faculty Senate
approved it.
The need for this type of program became clear,
according to Program Director Rosamund Naylor,
"because various faculty members at Stanford in
the environmental field were discussing issues
across disciplines and they felt the students should
have that interdisciplinary experience by means of
an honors program."
The program accepts 10 to 12 students each
year and has four faculty members involved: Bio
logical Sciences Profs. Donald Kennedy and
Steven Schneider, Assoc. Prof, of Economics Larry
Goulder and Naylor, a fellow at the Institute for
International Studies. This year, 13 students have
participated.
"This program differs from other honors pro
grams in that it combines students from ... earth
sciences, humanities, sciences and engineering,"
said Naylor, adding that she is not aware of this
kind of inter-school program at any other univer
sity.
Also, unlike other honors programs, "students
have the chance to work in close contact with var
ious faculty members from outside their mfyor de
partment," said Naylor.
Although students from any major may partic
ipate in the program, most students involved come
from civil engineering, earth systems, biology,
human biology or economics mcyors. "However,
we have had students from ethics, philosophy and
anthropology," Naylor added.
Several students have also received small

grants for overseas research. This
year the program includes three
students who visited Ecuador and
one who visited Hong Kong to do
independent field research.
Helen Chen, a senior in earth
systems, said the greatest benefit
of the program is "being able to
work closely with professors on
issues of environmental concern
throughout the world."
"By meeting on a regular basis
with many different students and
faculty you enjoy a variety of per
spectives on your particular
topic," she added.
Chen, whose thesis topic is the
feasibility of recycling construc
tion and demolition waste in
Hong Kong, spent two weeks in
Hong Kong last February.
Chen echoed Naylor's belief
that this type of program is
unique to Stanford. "There is a
scarcity of environmental pro
grams at other schools," said
Chen.
She said she also believes this
program is substantially different
from other honors programs at
Stanford, many of which simply
require students to write a thesis.

The students in the Environ
mental Honors Program "meet
once every other week in work
shops where we get a lot of feed
back from each other. During fall
quarter the workshops consist
primarily of lectures by the pro
fessors. But winter and spring
quarter (the students] take over.
We each talk about our own
research," said Chen.
Bill Faries, another senior
majoring in earth systems, is con
ducting research into satellite
imagery to calculate the percent
age of shoreline in the Amazon
River that is attributable to
islands. His research looks
toward establishing a link
between island deforestation and
declining commercial fish popula
tions. "We need to protect the
islands from deforestation; right
now the focus is only on the main
lands," said Faries.
Faries first heard about the
honors program through his work
in earth systems. "It's a great
chance to graduate with honors
and work with a bunch of people
from different backgrounds. When
we bounce ideas off each other, it
really helps that we're not all in
the same major," said Faries.
The approval of one's peers is a
powerful force in this program.
"You present your work in front

of a group of people who are very
intelligent and educated on the
issues. It forces you to under
stand what you're talking about
with a lot of depth," said Faries.
"Graduates of the program
have gone on to do interesting
things: One received a National
Science Foundation award, one is
right now working in South
Africa and one is a Fulbright fel
low. Becoming specialized in one
issue helped them get to the next
step," said Nay lor.
Next year Chen will enter the
Energy and Resources Program
at UC-Berkeley. Faries is deciding
between future graduate research
in remote sensing and graduate
work in industrial relations with
an environmental emphasis. "I'm
considering doing some work with
policy implications," said Faries.
As far as the qualifications
interested students should have,
"we are looking for students who
have had a lot of course work in
one particular environmental
field and exposure to many differ
ent areas. The ideal candidate has
a little breadth in environmental
issues generally and some depth
in one specific area," said Nay lor.
The program consists of a
year-long seminar, a written the
sis and several presentations of
student work.
