# Profs stake $15K on environment problems
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
If conditions in the world get worse, two
Stanford professors may be the only ones who
get some reward.
Biology Profs. Paul Ehrlich and Stephen
Schneider could be $15,000 richer a decade
from now, but only if they can convince Uni
versity of Maryland Business Prof. Julian
Simon to accept the terms of their bet.
Ehrlich and Schneider vehemently oppose
the positive forecast which Simon, a controver
sial conservative economist, predicts for
human welfare.
Neither side, however, can decide on the cri
teria used to measure human welfare. After
Simon wrote in a May 12 San Francisco Chron
icle opinions piece that "every measure of
material and environmental welfare in the
United States has improved," the Stanford pro
fessors devised 15 measures of environmental
health on which they would stake $1,000 each.
The Chronicle published their challenge as a
sharp response to Simon's article.
Simon, however, refuses to accept their indi-

cators — which include the levels of ozone, the
number of species on Earth, a rise in global
temperature, decreasing rice and wheat har
vests, an increase in AIDS, lower sperm counts
in men and a wider gap between the rich and
poor — saying that "there are always some
physical characteristics moving for a while in
directions that worry people."
Simon said that he would "bet on aspects of
human welfare connected with ... physical
changes — for example, the trend in skin-can
cer related deaths and any other health evils
thought to result from increased ozone." he
said he would not, however, gamble on the rise
in ozone itself.
"We don't intend to dicker around with
him," Schneider said. "He's the one who made
the statement... and we took up his offer."
"He has said everything is getting better,"
he added. "It isn't. We'll bet on it.
"He's trying to change the terms into some
classical economic form," Schneider said.
To Simon, the indicators Ehrlich and
Schneider proposed aren't consistent with his
article in the Chronicle. Until the two Stanford
professor - meet his terms, he said he isn't tak-

ing the gamble.
According to Schneider, however, "what
Simon is talking about you can argue
endlessly."
"Quality of life is just not a cash flow trans
action and balance sheet," he said. "It is about
security, quality of environment, sustainabili
tiy over the long term."
Schneider said that by stating that all envi
ronmental trends are improving, Simon has
made a scientific mistake. "No scientist uses
the word always," he said.
Simon said, however, that he feels he has
the facts on his side. "They write that I am
'spreading ... misinformation.' That is, they
deal with me not by challenging my data but by
calling me names and saying I am dishonest."
"Ehrlich and Schneider [are] simply pound
ing me instead of providing the data on the
long-run measures of human welfare," he
added.
This isn't the first time that Simon has
risked money over his beliefs, he collected
$576.07 from Ehrlich when the two bet over
the price of metals in 1980.
Ehrlich was not available for comment.
