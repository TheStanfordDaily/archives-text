# Alzheimer's project wins Saturn Award for outstanding work

### Marcus Jackson Contributing writer 
The United Students for Veterans
Health (USVH), a group formed last
spring which assists veterans with
Alzheimer's disease, was given Stanford's
4th annual Saturn Award in a ceremony
last Wednesday.
The award recognizes one student
group each year for outstanding team
work, initiative and impact. USVH was
one of 12 student groups nominated for
the Stanford award.
USVH recruits student volunteers to
provide care and attention to patients in
the Alzheimer's wards of Veterans

Administration hospitals across the coun
try.
Award winners received a $1,000
award and a trophy. They will now be
entered into a larger competition with the
winners from the 25 other participating
schools across the country, to be judged by
the Saturn Corporation. The winner of
the national competition will receive a
$5,000 award.
USVH was created by senior Vance
Vanier. "The Alzheimer's ward at the
nearby hospital in Palo Alto desperately
needed volunteers," said Vanier.
"The harsh reality of budgetary con
straints meant that the ward was chroni
cally understaffed. The staff nurses,

though dedicated and compassionate,
were simply too few in number to attend
to the social needs of the patients," said
Vanier. "Furthermore, no organized vol
unteer program existed to assuage the
loneliness felt by these patients, because
there was not much public interest."
He added that those volunteers who did
work in the wards seemed to burn out
quickly.
Vanier subsequently founded the Stan
ford program. Volunteers "go in groups to
play games, go on walks or simply talk to
the patients." Since its birth last spring,
the Stanford program has attracted 120
volunteers.
In November of last year Vanier, with

his younger brother Andre, spread the
program to other VA Hospitals and col
leges. "We contacted student leaders at
other campuses, sent them informative
literature to get programs started and
coordinated with the national VA staff,"
said Vanier.
Following these efforts, 15 universities
in 10 states have committed to the nation
al USVH team. Eight campuses have
already implemented USVH volunteer
programs.
Vanier said winning the Saturn award
will help in this regard. "In general we're
veiy excited about the award. The money
allows us to buy recreational supplies and
allows the USVH staff to continue its mis

sion of spreading the program to other
campuses."
USVH currently operates in the Haas
Center for Public Service. It has an eight
person staff consisting of seven under
graduates and one Stanford alumnus.
Asst. Director of Student Activities
Heather Dunn, who headed the Stanford
selection committee, said, "This particular
student group was innovative and aided a
need that had not been addressed in the
community."
The selection committee "solicits
applications each year, assembles a panel
to judge applications and decides who
wins," said Troy Gilbert, assistant direc
tor of student activities.
