## Closure may snarl DC traffic 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Closing Pennsylva
nia Avenue in front of the White House will
snarl traffic in a horn-honking, temper-flash
ing, bumper-to-bumper headache for com
muters and tourists, district officials warned
yesterday.
"I think it will be a traumatic rush hour,"
said a spokesman for the mayor's office on the
eve of the first business day without traffic
passing 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. "It will be a
mess."
With terrorism on the rise, President Clinton
on Saturday ordered two long blocks of the six
lane avenue closed to vehicles. In addition, a
small stretch of road behind the White House
was shut down and city officials said a major
commuter route, E Street, will become one way.
District Council Chairman Dave Clarke
accused the Clinton administration of shutting
down the street without thinking about the con
sequences.
"If they're going to say, 'We're the federal
government and we're going to force it,' they
could have laid out the contingency plans. I
don't think they have," he said.
Officials say 26,000 automobiles traveled
that stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue daily and
another 23,000 tooled up and down E Street.

Trying to ease the crunch, government work
ers are getting an extra hour to report to work
today and parking will be eliminated along two
streets that run beside the White House. Grant,
the public works spokeswoman, urged com
muters to leave their cars at home and take a
bus or the subway.
"The way we go to work is a habit and for
many people they are going to change their
habit," she said.
Johnny Allem, spokesman for Mayor Marion
Barry, said the city is not quibbling with Clin
ton's decision to defend himself, his staff, the
White House and tourists from terrorist
attacks. But new traffic signs, traffic lights,
police overtime pay and maintenance on roads
picking up the flow from Pennsylvania Avenue
will be costly.
Closing the street, a longtime goal of the
Secret Service, has been a possibility since last
fall. That was when a security team reviewed
the White House's vulnerability after a gunman
sprayed the building with bullets and a small
plane landed in Clinton's back yard.
The Oklahoma City bombing provided more
evidence for the security team trying to per
suade politicians to shut the street to all but
pedestrian traffic.
