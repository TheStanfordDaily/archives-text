OLOMOUC, Czech Republic
(AP) — Visiting a land bloodied
for centuries by religious wars,
Pope John Paul II asked forgive
ness yesterday for crimes commit
ted by Catholics against other
Christians.
In speeches stressing the need
to overcome historic divisions, the
pope also pledged to forgive those
who caused Catholics to suffer.
The statements came on a day
the pope canonized a Catholic
priest martyred in 1620 during
the Counter-Reformation and
who symbolizes the still bitter
Catholic-Protestant rivalry in
Moravia in the eastern part of the
Czech Republic.
"Today I, the pope of the
church of Rome, in the name of all
Catholics, ask forgiveness for the
wrongs inflicted on non-Catholics
during the turbulent history of
these peoples," John Paul said in
a solemn declaration.
"At the same time, I pledge the
Catholic church's forgiveness for
whatever harm her sons and
daughters suffered," the pope

declared, speaking from under a
white awning during a rainstorm.
The canonization of Jan
Sarkandr was the highlight of
the pope's two-day visit to the
Czech Republic. Organizers esti
mated that at least 150,000 peo
ple turned out for the Mass,
standing in mud on a grassy air
port field.
Sarkandr was accused by the
Protestant rulers of Moravia of
aiding invading Polish Catholic
armies. Charged with high trea
son, he was tortured and died in
prison in this city near the pre
sent-day border with Poland.
For many Protestants, Sarkan
dr symbolizes efforts by Catholic
monarchs to forcefully reimpose
Catholicism after the Reforma
tion.
Pavel Smetana, leader of the
Evangelical Church, the largest
Protestant denomination in the
Czech Republic, protested the
canonization in a letter to the Vat
ican and boycotted a meeting with
the pope Saturday afternoon.
However, 15 other Protestant

representatives showed up for the
meeting.
In his sermon, the pope reject
ed any suggestion that the canon
ization was meant to reopen
"painful wounds," insisting the
move was meant to help bring
Christians closer together.
Later, at a meeting with young
people at the nearby Svaty
Kopecek (Holy Hill) sanctuary,
the pope said the forgiveness of
historical wrongs was essential
for nations as well as individuals.
He cited the war still raging in the
former Yugoslavia and recalled
the reconciliation of Poland and
Germany.
John Paul noted his own
recent call for the Church to rec
ognize the sins of Catholics over
the centuries, as part of prepara
tions for Christianity's third mil
lennium.
The pope's statement recalled
his remarks in Senegal three
years ago, when he apologized for
the involvement of Catholics in
the slave trade between Africa
and the New World.
