WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Defense Secretary
Les Aspin, who was appointed to steer the Pentagon
into the uncharted waters of the post-Cold War era but
resigned under pressure after a series of missteps, died
last night after suffering a massive stroke Saturday. He
was 56.
Michael Tebo, a spokesman for Georgetown Univer
sity Medical Center, said Aspin died at 7:55 p.m. yester
day at the hospital.
He noted that Aspin was "lucid, awake and speak
ing" when he was admitted to the hospital at 9:30 a.m.
Saturday.
"Despite intensive medical intervention over the
next 34 hours his medical condition continued to dete
rioriate," Tebo added.
Aspin's cardiologist, Dr. David Perle, said Aspin's ex
wife, brother and girlfriend, a long-term companion,
were with him when he died.
Tebo said funeral arrangements would be
announced later.
A Wisconsin congressman for 22 years, Aspin was

chairman of the House Armed Services Committee
when President Clinton nominated him to be defense
secretary. It was his second tour of duty at the Pen
tagon.
Aspin's initial Pentagon experience came during the
height of the Vietnam War when Defense Secretary
Robert S. McNamara assembled a group of whiz kids to
analyze weapons systems. More than two decades later,
he returned to oversee the downsizing of the military.
But his time at the helm was brief. Heart problems,
political pressure and a series of public relations glitch
es forced his resignation in December 1993.
As he took office at the Pentagon, Aspin became
caught in the crossfire over Clinton's plan to drop the
ban on gays in the military. At the same time, U.S.
troops were trying to impose order in Somalia to allow
the United Nations to feed starving citizens there. And
the military faced new challenges posed by the disinte
gration of the former Soviet Union and its Communist
alliance in Eastern Europe, putting Aspin under pres
sure to make deep cuts in the military budget.
