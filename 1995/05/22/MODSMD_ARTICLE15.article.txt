Bailout rejected
SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - Orange
County executives quietly rejected a
securities firm's $2 billion bailout offer
that would help the county avert a mas
sive default on upcoming bond repay
ments, a newspaper reported yesterday.
Several county supervisors were
troubled to learn they were not consult
ed on the offer made by J.P. Morgan
Securities in mid-February and renewed
again this month, the Los Angeles
Times reported.
"I think the board of supervisors

should have been presented with every
alternative," said Supervisor Roger R.
Stanton, who discovered the proposal
while routinely reviewing other bond
offers last week.
"I don't think the board would have
voted to put the sales tax on the ballot in
June if a viable alternative to paying off
our debt had been presented."
Orange County's $1.7 billion in losses
resulted from former Treasurer Robert
L. Citron's policies of heavy borrowing
and investing in risky securities that
were highly sensitive to interest rates.
Nearly $i billion in bond repayments

are due this summer. The county is hun
dreds of millions of dollars short of the
amount it needs, and is considering the
tax hike as a means of raising money.
Epidemic began earlier
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) - The death
toll from the Ebola virus topped 100 yes
terday and health workers said the epi
demic may have started as long ago as
December — three months earlier than
previously thought.
Medical workers scouring Kikwit, a
city of 600,000 where the outbreak was

previously believed to have started in
mid-March, found hospital records link
ing the virus to a household of 12 people,
where seven people died in December.
Tests confirmed that at least one of
the victims had Ebola, and researchers
were trying to determine whether the
others did as well, the World Health
Organization said.
If the victims died quickly and had lit
tle contact with other people, doctors
said the family might not be linked to
the current outbreak. If they had con
tact, the outbreak would be three
months older than previously thought.

Chung demoted
NEW YORK (AP) - "The Dan and
Connie Show" today becomes "The
CBS Evening News With Dan Rather
and Without Connie Chung."
Chung's ouster from the show ends
an uneasy two-year partnership that
saw the newscast's ratings drop into
the cellar. Chung is now negotiating a
release from her contract, which has
less than a year to go.
"I'm asking for a mutually agree
able separation," Chung said yester
day.
