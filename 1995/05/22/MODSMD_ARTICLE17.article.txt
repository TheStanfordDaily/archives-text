## Editorial A 						lesson for seniors 
### 
Graduation presents an
intimidating situation,
but seniors should relax

AS GRADUATION draws
near, many seniors are get
ting nervous, and for good
reason.
Another chapter in the lives of
these students is about to close.
One could argue, indeed, that a
whole volume is coming to an end.
For 16 years, give or take, the
graduating seniors have been stu
dents. For at least nine months of
every year, their lives have been
focused on school. Now hundreds
are taking their last classes. It is
time to start applying the knowl
edge they have accumulated to the
real world.
How should this knowledge be
applied? There's the rub. For each
job taken or internship accepted,
there are other fields closed off.
While education began ecumeni
cal, it has increasingly narrowed,
to selecting classes in high school,
selecting a major at college and
oftentimes selecting a specialty
within that major. Picking a job
becomes one of the last, biggest
selections.
Faced with such a momentous
choice, limited by what jobs are
available, shaped by a quarter-life
time of knowledge gathered, many
seniors don't know what they will
do after graduation. Some are
rushing to take the GRE, some are
rushing to consulting interviews
with shiny, yet empty, new attache
cases, some are rushing back to
their hometowns to find work.
For all these nervous seniors, a
bit of advice: Slow down a little
and try not to worry too much. No
one needs to have their entire life
planned out the minute they grad
uate from college. Even if you have
made plans, they might change —
remember how many students
change their majors. If you don't
have the dream job lined up yet,
don't worry.

Students without set plans
should not be intimidated by those
who do seem to have the rest of
their lives already charted out.
The extreme importance of this
next step into the job market war
rants much time and careful
thought. Simply grasping at the
first opportunity that presents
itself would only do yourself a dis
service. Although no one wants to
end up jobless for the rest of one's
life, taking a step back to really
determine which path is the best
one to follow certainly seems like a
step in the right direction.
So what should you do after
leaving the Farm? Follow your
heart and your head. Yes, there is
great pressure to get that $50,000-
a-year investment banking job,
but if you would rather teach,
apply for instructing jobs. Maybe
you want to spend two years driv
ing a big rig coast to coast. That's
fine, too.
The point is no one knows you
better than you. In the chorus of
expectations from teachers and
parents, peers and alumni, try to
hear the clear voice from within
yourself and follow that where it
leads you.
And what if there is no clear
voice? What if you can't bring
yourself to choose an option — or
you have no options at the
moment?
Stay calm; something will come
up. Let yourself wander for a
while, at least figuratively, and see
what opportunities present them
selves. Remember the fear that
comes with the end of 16 years of
planned education is balanced by
the excitement and opportunity of
being out in the real world.
Finally, have a bit of pride and
confidence in yourself and your
Stanford education. Remember
that your Stanford degree
assures a level of intelligence,
ability and dedication. So don't
give up. Already, you have accom
plished more than many of the
people you have known and
grown up with. Have fun, do good
and be happy.
