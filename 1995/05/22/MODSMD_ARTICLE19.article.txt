## Unexpected illumination 
### 
PERHAPS THE most rewarding
experiences are those we never
expect to encounter. We learn
unintentional lessons in the process of
not trying so hard to carefully plot our
course. For me, it's always been a mat
ter of following my heart and letting the
adventures and the newfound wisdom
unfold.
I never realized when I began tutor
ing Bernardino Ramirez in English that
our lessons would extend far beyond
past participles and pinpoint pronuncia
tion. It never occurred to me that I
would be the student much of the time.
What started as my self-serving quest to
find a work / study job has blossomed
into an experience as rewarding as any
other at Stanford.
You won't find our biweekly meetings
listed in the time schedule. I never
planned on securing wisdom from tutor
ing in the same way I expect to acquire
knowledge from my official classes. But
someone upstairs knew I needed to
learn a little bit more about life and led
me toward this tutoring job.
I first met Bernardino last fall when I
walked into the Beckman Building at
the Medical School, where he works.
Thinking back on it now, it seems like
we've always been old buddies. (Maybe
it's because right from the beginning we
would shoot the breeze too long before
cracking the books!) In that time when
we could have been going over verb tens
es, we started becoming pals. I've

learned a valuable lesson about
humankind in my short time working
with the Stanford Literacy Improve
ment Project: Common time between
people with distinct backgrounds and
diverging paths can produce a friend
ship beyond the words each of us can
express in our native languages.
Bernardino and I have come a long
way in breaking down the barriers that
so often exist between people whose
lives seldom intersect. I can't profess to
completely understand Bernardino's life
as a Mexican resident in the United
States who works as a housekeeper at
Stanford Hospital. Neither does he
claim to understand my life as a college
student, going to classes and studying
like I do. But for two hours a week our
lives merge, and we catch a small, bril
liant glimpse of the other's perspective.
Nothing captured the heart of debate
about Proposition 187 more provoca
tively than my conversations with
Bernardino. He patiently answered each
inquiry I had about Mexican residents
in the U.S., legal and illegal. Without
revealing specific identities, he cast the
issue in terms of real lives with the sto
ries of people living right here in the Bay
Area.
Debate among demagogues began to
influence me far less than Bernardino's
honest description of an immigrant's
goal of making it in the U.S. In Prop.
187 we were failing from the top-down
to create a policy which reveals a society

that cares about people.
As the year progressed, another issue
from the front pages made it into our
informal chats — the financial crisis in
Mexico. True to form, the tables were
turned, and I became the student.
Bernardino told me of the plight of his
family and friends still in Mexico.
My perception of the crisis no longer
revolved around bailouts, the World
Bank and austerity plans. Instead, I
began to think of hard-working people
in Mexico, struggling to afford the basic
necessities and remain optimistic, vis-a
vis the detached, all-powerful govern
ment which had failed them so miser
ably. My new understandingof the crisis
on a personal level added substance to
hollow news stories and empty econom
ic theories.
I thank Bernardino for illuminating
these issues and many more. I'll miss
our discussions when I leave for the
summer and study away from Stanford
for much of next year. Hopefully, in two
years, we can share our academic
achievements when I get my Stanford
diploma and he gets his G.E.D. And by
then, we will know even better that it's
possible to mold a new reality, closer to
the heart.
