# Merger of alumni Observer, Stanford magazine approved
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The Stanford Alumni Association
board voted unanimously this weekend to
merge its publication, the independent
Stanford magazine, with the University's
alumni publication, the Stanford Observ
er.
The new arrangement, approved by
the board after discussion with represen
tatives of the magazine and the Universi
ty, calls for the first issue of the new mag
azine to be published March 1,1996, said
Alumni Association Director Bill Stone.
The publication will retain its name.
Stanford magazine will be published

every other month following the first
issue. The current Stanford magazine is
published quarterly, while the Observer
prints six issues each year.
"It will resemble the existing maga
zine," Stone said. "It will have a section
called Stanford Today, which will be the
replacement of the Stanford Observer,
bound in as part of the magazine."
If the merger had not been approved by
the Alumni Association, the University
was planning to publish Stanford Today
as a separate quarterly magazine.
The merger will not be completely final
until approved by the University Board of
Trustees at its meeting in June. Trustee
Henry Muller was at this weekend's meet

ing and said "he hoped the planning ef
forts could proceed anticipating a positive
vote in June," according to Stone.
Although the Alumni Association and
University will now jointly print one mag
azine for alumni, Stanford Today will be
kept a "discreet" part of the proposed 112-
page publication, said University News
Service Director Doug Foster.
Those involved wanted to keep Stan
ford Today distinct because "it's being put
out by a different group," Foster said.
"This will make it clear where the campus
news is and where the alumni news is."
