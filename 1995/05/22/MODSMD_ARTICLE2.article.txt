# Merger of alumni Observer, Stanford magazine approved
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The Stanford Alumni Association
board voted unanimously this weekend to
merge its publication, the independent
Stanford magazine, with the University's
alumni publication, the Stanford Observ
er.
The new arrangement, approved by
the board after discussion with represen
tatives of the magazine and the Universi
ty, calls for the first issue of the new mag
azine to be published March 1,1996, said
Alumni Association Director Bill Stone.
The publication will retain its name.
Stanford magazine will be published

every other month following the first
issue. The current Stanford magazine is
published quarterly, while the Observer
prints six issues each year.
"It will resemble the existing maga
zine," Stone said. "It will have a section
called Stanford Today, which will be the
replacement of the Stanford Observer,
bound in as part of the magazine."
If the merger had not been approved by
the Alumni Association, the University
was planning to publish Stanford Today
as a separate quarterly magazine.
The merger will not be completely final
until approved by the University Board of
Trustees at its meeting in June. Trustee
Henry Muller was at this weekend's meet

ing and said "he hoped the planning ef
forts could proceed anticipating a positive
vote in June," according to Stone.
Although the Alumni Association and
University will now jointly print one mag
azine for alumni, Stanford Today will be
kept a "discreet" part of the proposed 112-
page publication, said University News
Service Director Doug Foster.
Those involved wanted to keep Stan
ford Today distinct because "it's being put
out by a different group," Foster said.
"This will make it clear where the campus
news is and where the alumni news is."
Bruce Anderson, editor of Stanford
magazine, said he anticipates that
he will need an increase in staff size
because of the merger. Because the
Observer already prints six issues
each year, however, Foster said he
does not expect to need additional
help.
Anderson said he was "unsur
prised by the decision that came
out" of the meeting.
"Knowing that that was going to
come out, our staff has been gearing
into how we are going to make this
work the best possible way," he said.
With just over nine months until
the first issue is printed, his staff
has a lot of work ahead of them,
Anderson said.
"I see my concern as working
with my staff and working with the
people at News Service to facilitate
{the merger] and make it the best
possible publication we can make
it,"he said.
The joint stalls must also "find
out where the opportunities to do
things that we haven't done before

are and ... try to work through in a
little more detailed way where some
of the possible pitfalls are," Ander
son said.
Concerns about University con
trol over the editorial content of the
now-independent magazine have
not disappeared, although Ander
son said "the [Alumni Association]
board made it clear that they would
like to see the 80 pages we produce
reflect the same kind of indepen
dent voice that we have given to
alumni in the past."
The staff of Stanford magazine
can do little but have a "wait-and
see attitude" about possible con
flicts over editorial content, he said.
The merger leaves Stanford
magazine in an uncertain position
in the Ivy League Magazine Net
work — a group of alumni maga
zines that solicits advertising from
national companies — which Stan
ford joined in January, hoping to
bring in more advertising dollars.
"The Ivy League Network has
concerns about whether we'll be
able to maintain the same kind of
product," Anderson said. "Hopeful
ly, we'll be able to do just that."
But such concerns were too

weak to make any members of the
Alumni Association board vote
against the merger. "It was not a
contested vote," Stone said.
At this weekend's meeting, held
on the grounds of Stanford's Sierra
Camp, University General Counsel
Michael Roster presented the find
ings of a task force created to study
the proposed merger. Roster
answered questions about finances,
editorial independence, the timing
of the merger and advertising,
Stone said.
Concerns about independence —
prevalent since a change in the
Observer format was first proposed
in February — were "largely put to
rest" by Roster's report, he said.
"He reassured our committee
that there was no reason for con
cern about the independent editori
al rights of the association," Stone
said. "I assume it will be business as
usual."
Roster, who was chair of the
Alumni Association four years ago,
said the key issue in the merger
debate was economics, not editorial
independence.
Roster said he acted as the inter
mediary between representatives of

the two publications during three
months of discussion about
whether the University should pub
lish Stanford Today independently
of Stanford magazine or attempt
the merger.
"The University was absolutely
ready to proceed and publish a sep
arate magazine," Roster said.
"There were a number of people
concerned about how that was
going to come across to alumni and
others."
Faced with two magazines of
similar design and content, alumni
would have asked why the Univer
sity used extra money to print two
publications, he said.
From the reader's perspective,
said History Prof. David Kennedy,
a member of the task force looking
into the merger, "it just seemed to
me from the outset that the com
mon-sensical thing to do was to
have one publication.
"The expense of sending out two
separate publications — as well as
the possible confusion that might
result out there about which is
which and which speaks with which
voice — was tremendously large,"
he said.
