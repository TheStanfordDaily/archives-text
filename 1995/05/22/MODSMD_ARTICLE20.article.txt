SEAS plans to target Stanford's investment in Unocal

IN RECENT letters and articles in The
Daily, Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford (SEAS) presented
its ongoing campaign to establish envi
ronmentally and socially responsible
investment criteria for Stanford invest
ments. To date, SEAS' efforts have
focused on divestment from Texaco, a
company that holds an egregious environ
mental record domestically and interna
tionally. Texaco invests heavily in Burma,
an illegitimate dictatorship which perpe
trates human rights violations. SEAS
offered its information to the Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibility
(APIR) of the Stanford Management
Company in order to urge proxy voting as
a means of surfacing the issue to Texaco.

(Proxy voting is the established process
for a shareholder to influence the policies
of the corporation.) Unfortunately, the
proxy deadline for Texaco passed before
the decision-making process could be
completed. SEAS, then, decided to direct
its attention to Unocal, a company with
an analogous record whose proxy-voting
deadline had not yet passed.
Last week, the ASSU (without quo
rum) passed a resolution asking the Stan
ford Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR) — the committee that exam
ines the reports from the APIR and
makes the final decision on proxy voting
— to listen to student demands. The reso
lution mandated that the SCIR vote on
the current proxy, suggesting that Unocal

should investigate alleged human rights
violations. Citing the time constraints for
this particular proxy, the SCIR abstained.
However, the SCIR promised to develop a
full report over the summer and place the
divestment issue as the number-one pri
ority on its fall agenda.
Student and faculty involvement is
imperative for the continuation of this
process. Stanford's financial investments
impact all parties affiliated with the Uni
versity. As an educational leader, Stan
ford sets an example of acceptable behav
ior for the rest of the world. Is invest
ment in environmentally destructive com
panies a message that Stanford should
condone? The institutional integrity of
the University is at stake; don't let Stan

ford's image be tainted.
SEAS will sponsor an educational
teach-in this Tuesday, May 23 at 8 p.m.
in Tresidder Cypress South room (moved
from the Oak West room). SEAS mem
bers will reveal crucial information about
Stanford's investment portfolio. There
will also be a slide presentation from a
former Burmese citizen and witness to
Texaco's and Unocal's operations. You
have the right to be informed. Don't be a
passive bystander in this divestment pro
cess.
