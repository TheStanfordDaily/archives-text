# Students need to take more initiative if they expect alumni advice
## 
### 
The Daily's editorial on May 18,
entitled "Alumni Connections,"
reflects the typical student attitude
toward alumni-student relations —
ignorance. Had The Daily taken the
time to contact the Alumni Associa
tion, or even ask one of the employees
at the CPPC, they would have found
out that a program — very similar to
the one they described — is already in
place. The Alumni Contact Service is a

collection of alumni who have volun
teered to assist students in their job
quests. While there is no guarantee of
employment, these alums have volun
teered to offer advice on careers and
grant informational interviews. There
are alumni from all regions of the
country in a wide variety of profes
sions. The binders for this service are
located both at the CPPC (in addition
to the internship possibilities binders
mentioned in the editorial) and the
Bowman Alumni House.
If this service isn't exactly what you
are looking for, there is also a mentor
program. Student can be matched up
with alumni in their field of interest
who have offered to advise students

about careers, school and life. This is a
year-long program, thus allowing
members to develop an extended rela
tionship with the alum. As a senior
who has participated in both of the
programs, I would encourage every
student to do so. My mentor has been
fantastic: I've gotten a lot of good
career advice, job leads, a related job
offer and free meals at her house occa
sionally.
In addition to the aforementioned
programs, there are a host of other
programs offered throughout the
school year that promote student
alumni interaction. There is the shad
ow program, where students can follow
alumni around on the job for a day,

brunches at alumni homes and career
nights, to name a few. The programs
aimed at increasing student-alumni
interaction, which can help students
make much needed job connections, do
exist. However, students must take the
initiative to participate — there have
been several ads in The Daily advertis
ing all of these programs, and often
students just don't attend. (In fact, for
the mentor program, there have been
many more mentors than students for
the past couple of years.) So the Uni
versity has done it's part to provide
the opportunity; students simply
haven't taken advantage of it.
