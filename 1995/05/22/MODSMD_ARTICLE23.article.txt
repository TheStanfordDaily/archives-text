## Cardinal heads into regionals after winning series Squad accomplishing goals as it moves into post season 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
entered the series against UC-
Santa Barbara this weekend with
a list of goals to accomplish and
calmly marked "done" next to
each one.
The season-finale three-game
set between the Cardinal and the
Gauchos allowed Stanford the
opportunity to prepare itself for
the upcoming NCAA Regionals.
Following the high pressure
series against Arizona State, the
Cardinal relaxed and worked out
a few kinks at Sunken Diamond.
The first point of business, and
arguably the most important, was
monitoring the strain on the
Stanford pitching staff. Head
coach Mark Marquess set a pitch
limit for each starter and stuck by
his edict. Freshman Kyle Peter
son and juniors Mike Robbins and
Dan Reed were restricted to no
more than 90 pitches for each of
their appearances.
Peterson tossed six shut-out
innings in his start on Friday and
was rewarded with his 11th win,
which tied him with Jack McDow
ell for the most victories by a
Stanford freshman. On Saturday,
Robbins got the nod and worked
five solid innings, giving up one
run on four hits and one walk.
Yesterday, Reed made his first
start since April 23 against Cali
fornia and threw 87 pitches in
four innings, giving up five hits
and three runs. Both left-han
ders, Robbins and Reed, picked up
no-decisions.
Next on the agenda was meter
ing the work for the relievers.
Five pitchers from the bullpen
took to the mound during the
three games, with all, save one,
lasting a minimum of two
innings. The five, juniors Mario
Iglesias and Todd Bartels and
sophomores Tom Reimers, Bren

dan Sullivan and J.D. Brammer,
have been the mainstays of the
corps.
Iglesias spent three innings on
the mound on Friday, picking up
his second save despite giving up
three runs in the ninth. Iglesias
worked perfect seventh and
eighth innings, but an error by
freshman Jay Pecci and some
timely hitting by the Gauchos led
to three unearned runs. On Sat
urday, Reimers relieved Robbins
and gave up the game-tying run
in his two innings. Sullivan, who
spent part of the season as the
closer, picked up the victory. The
right-handed submariner tossed
two scoreless innings.
Marquess called on Bartels and
Brammer in the regular season
finale. Bartels, who has started
seven games this season, pitched
four innings in long relief of Reed.
The right-hander was saddled
with the loss after surrendering
four runs, three on a home run by
right fielder Wynter Phoenix.
Brammer pitched the ninth inning
and held Santa Barbara scoreless.
Offensively, Marquess rotated
players in and out of the starting
lineup. With some of tha starters
banged up and nursing nagging
injuries, third base, first base and
the designated hitter spots were
filled by people not usually played
in those positions.
Senior Steve Carver, in the
final homestand of his Stanford
career, spent Friday at first base
and the final two games at desig
nated hitter. He has been nursing
a sore shoulder; Pecci took his
place at the hot corner. Junior
Troy Kent, the customary first
baseman, sat out the opening
game of the series resting his
injuries, and freshman Jon Scha
effer, bumped out of his DH slot,
gave junior A.J. Hinch most of
the day off on Saturday. Hinch
played the first inning before
yielding to Schaeffer at catcher.
