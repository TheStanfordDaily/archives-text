quickly. Junior left fielder Cale
Carter and junior catcher A.J.
Hinch both singled in the bottom
of the first to put men on first and
second for Stanford. Carver
stepped to the plate in the desig
nated hitter role and slapped a
double down the third-base line,
scoring both Carter and Hinch to
tie the game.
Stanford took the lead in the
second inning when Pecci drove
in junior second baseman Brian
Dallimore from third. But the
lead only lasted 10 minutes, and
the score was 3-3 after a Santa
Barbara sacrifice fly to right cen
ter allowed the runner at third to
tag up and run home.
Reed tossed 87 pitches in four
innings on the mound. He gave
up Ave base hits and three runs as
the usually tough Gaucho offense
hit him hard in the first three
frames.
"It was good to get Reed some
innings today," Marquess said.
"He feels all right, which is good.
We'll need him in the postsea
son."
Junior reliever Todd Bartels
got in a jam early in the fifth
inning and did not get out of it
unscathed. He gave up three hits
in the inning, the second an RBI
single that gave UCSB the lead
again. The real damage came two
batters later when Wynter
Phoenix connected with his 12th
homer of the year, a three-run
dinger over the right center wall,
and extended the lead to 7-3.
Two doubles by Carter and
Carver in the bottom of the sixth,
both well-hit balls to the warning

It was only an appetizer before
the upcoming feast known as
regional postseason competition,
but the Stanford baseball squad
still liked the taste of winning two
out of three games in its last
homestand of the year.
Resting some aching starters
and playing hopscotch with the
regular lineup, the Cardinal (34-
22) defeated Santa Barbara (24-
26) 6-3 on Friday and 3-2 on Sat
urday before dropping the final
game 8-6.
"We got what we wanted out of
the weekend," Stanford skipper
Mark Marquess said. "We would
have liked to have won [the final
game], but we accomplished what
we wanted to do."
The series closed out the regu
lar season for both teams; Stan
ford will now focus on the region
al tournament which starts on
Thursday.
The Gauchos got started early
on Cardinal southpaw starter
Dan Reed on Sunday. They scored
two runs in the first frame after
Zach Elliott sent a blooper over
the infield and another on an
error by Stanford freshman third
baseman Jay Pecci. Pecci replaced
senior Steve Carver at the left
infield corner over the weekend to
give the freshman some extra
playing time at third and allow
Carver to nurse a sore shoulder.
"Carver has been sore and
banged up a bit," Marquess said.
"[His shoulder] has been bugging
him for about a month, and we
finally got a chance to rest him."
The Cardinal response came

track, scored Stanford's fourth
run of the game. Stanford hit
UCSB pitching hard all day long
and sent five long balls to the wall
that might have jumped the fence
with the aid of a stiff breeze.
Bartels got out of another
tough jam in the seventh when he
loaded the bases with only one
out. But Bartels helped complete
the double play on a slow
grounder to the mound and shut
out the Gauchos in the inning.
Stanford shaved the lead a bit
more in the seventh inning, scor
ing another run to make the score
7-5 after seven complete frames.
J.D. Brammer worked the ninth
inning on the mound for Stanford
and gave up an eighth run on a
sacrifice fly to center.
The Cardinal made a run for
the game in the bottom of the
ninth after Schaeffer singled in
senior Dusty Allen to cut the lead
to 8-6. But with runners on the
corners, pinch hitter Rich Crowe
flied out to second base, and Kil
burg struck out to solidify the
UCSB victory.
Pitching and defense saved the
Cardinal from defeat on Saturday
as the Stanford ofTense hibernat
ed for the day. The Cardinal tied a
season-low hit total with only four
on the day but managed to put

two runs on the board off Gaucho
wild pitches to best UCSB.
The Gauchos scored first in the
fourth inning on a David Willis
two-out RBI single to left field.
But the Cardinal answered in the
bottom half of the frame when
freshman catcher Jon Schaeffer
scored the first of his two runs of
the day on a wild pitch from Gau
cho hurler Steve Lane.
Stanford took a 2-1 lead in the
next inning, thanks primarily to
Santa Barbara pitching and field
ing errors. After an infield error
loaded the bases, Schaeffer
walked in junior first baseman
Troy Kent from third.
The score was knotted up
again in the seventh inning after
UCSB collected three hits off
Stanford reliever Tom Reimers
and scored its second run of the
game. Gaucho Doug Smaldino
singled to center field and nabbed
the RBI.
UCSB handed the game to the
Cardinal for good in the eighth
inning. The struggling Stanford
bats continued to be quiet, but
Schaeffer scored the winning run
after he singled to right field and
Carver reached base on a short
stop error. Schaeffer was sent
home on the second wild pitch of
the day for Lane.
Junior left-hander Mike Rob
bins worked a clean five innings
for the Cardinal, giving up one
run on four hits and striking out
five. Sophomore reliever Brendan

Sullivan (3-2) earned the victory
after giving up two hits and strik
ing out two in two innings of
work.
The second game belonged to
Schaeffer, who was involved in all
three scoring plays for the Cardi
nal. He scored twice on wild pitch
es and drove in Kent, going 2-for
-2 on the afternoon.
"We're definitely looking for
ward to the regionals, and I'm
looking forward to contributing
to the team effort there," Schaef
fer said.
The first game of the series
was the final start for Cardinal
freshman ace Kyle Peterson, who
finished his stellar season in fine
fashion. Peterson gave up five
hits and struck out eight Gauchos
in six innings of scoreless work on
the mound. He finished his first
regular season on the Farm 11-1
with a 3.04 ERA. The freshman's
11 victories tied the record set by
current New York Yankee Jack
McDowell during his initial Stan
ford campaign in 1985.
Stanford controlled the offense
in this game for eight innings,
shutting out Santa Barbara while
scoring six runs in the first seven
frames. The Cardinal also left 11
runners on base in the game and
rocked the Gauchos for 10 base
hits.
Freshman center fielder Joe
Kilburg single-handedly scored
the Cardinal's first run of the
game in the third inning. He sin

gled to right field and stole second
before being moved to third on a
groundout and taking home on a
wild pitch.
Three more Cardinal players
crossed the plate in the sixth
inning, led by Schaeffer's two-
RBI single to center field. The
freshman duo of Schaeffer and
Pecci drove in all three runs of the
inning as Pecci singled Dallimore
home from third. The lead was
extended to 6-0 in the seventh
after Dallimore singled in Carver
and Hinch. Carver finished the
day 2-for-4 with two runs scored,
while Dallimore was 2-for-3 with
two RBIs and one run scored.
Santa Barbara made a valiant
run in the top of the ninth, scor
ing three runs on two hits with
the aid of an error by Pecci. But
junior right-hander Mario Igle
sias held on in the final inning to
preserve the lead and chalk up his
second save of the year.
The Cardinal squad will find
out today at noon where it will
play and what seed it will receive
in regional competition. The
announcement will be made live
on ESPN.
"So much that we don't know
about determines where we will
go," Marquess said. "It really
doesn't matter |where we go].
The critical thing is where we are
seeded. It's better to be seeded a
two than a three, and it was
important to at least win two out
of three this weekend for that."
