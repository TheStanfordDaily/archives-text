quickly. Junior left fielder Cale
Carter and junior catcher A.J.
Hinch both singled in the bottom
of the first to put men on first and
second for Stanford. Carver
stepped to the plate in the desig
nated hitter role and slapped a
double down the third-base line,
scoring both Carter and Hinch to
tie the game.
Stanford took the lead in the
second inning when Pecci drove
in junior second baseman Brian
Dallimore from third. But the
lead only lasted 10 minutes, and
the score was 3-3 after a Santa
Barbara sacrifice fly to right cen
ter allowed the runner at third to
tag up and run home.
Reed tossed 87 pitches in four
innings on the mound. He gave
up Ave base hits and three runs as
the usually tough Gaucho offense
hit him hard in the first three
frames.
"It was good to get Reed some
innings today," Marquess said.
"He feels all right, which is good.
We'll need him in the postsea
son."
Junior reliever Todd Bartels
got in a jam early in the fifth
inning and did not get out of it
unscathed. He gave up three hits
in the inning, the second an RBI
single that gave UCSB the lead
again. The real damage came two
batters later when Wynter
Phoenix connected with his 12th
homer of the year, a three-run
dinger over the right center wall,
and extended the lead to 7-3.
Two doubles by Carter and
Carver in the bottom of the sixth,
both well-hit balls to the warning

It was only an appetizer before
the upcoming feast known as
regional postseason competition,
but the Stanford baseball squad
still liked the taste of winning two
out of three games in its last
homestand of the year.
Resting some aching starters
and playing hopscotch with the
regular lineup, the Cardinal (34-
22) defeated Santa Barbara (24-
26) 6-3 on Friday and 3-2 on Sat
urday before dropping the final
game 8-6.
"We got what we wanted out of
the weekend," Stanford skipper
Mark Marquess said. "We would
have liked to have won [the final
game], but we accomplished what
we wanted to do."
The series closed out the regu
lar season for both teams; Stan
ford will now focus on the region
al tournament which starts on
Thursday.
The Gauchos got started early
on Cardinal southpaw starter
Dan Reed on Sunday. They scored
two runs in the first frame after
Zach Elliott sent a blooper over
the infield and another on an
error by Stanford freshman third
baseman Jay Pecci. Pecci replaced
senior Steve Carver at the left
infield corner over the weekend to
give the freshman some extra
playing time at third and allow
Carver to nurse a sore shoulder.
"Carver has been sore and
banged up a bit," Marquess said.
"[His shoulder] has been bugging
him for about a month, and we
finally got a chance to rest him."
