# Semis prove final
## Salzenstein, Goldstein and Humphries fall in second-to-last round at NCAA Individuals 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
Members of the national
champion Stanford men's tennis
team did not fare as well in the
NCAA Singles and Doubles
Championships as the Cardinal
did in team competition last Fri
day and Saturday at the Univer

sity of Georgia's Henry Feild
Stadium.
Fourth-seeded Jeff Salzen
stein had a strong showing in the
singles competition but was
ousted in the semifinal round on
Saturday by No. 6-seeded Brett
Hansen of USC 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-
3.
Stanford's junior captain had

defeated Hansen twice this year
before Hansen could get it right
on the third try — so right that
at one stage of the match the
Trojan was able to take nine
straight games off of Salzen
stein.
"Jeff struggled in the first
set," said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould. "He got broken early, then
struggled to come back and win the
tie-breaker. But then Hansen just
blew him away in nine straight
games. Jeff tried to break him at 5-
3 in the third, but couldn't."
Salzenstein reached the semis by
notching two straight-set victories
on Friday over champion European
players. In the third round he
defeated former European Junior
Champion Srdjan Muskatirovic of
Miami 7-5,6-2; then in the quarter
finals he beat Fresno State's former
Swedish Indoor Champion Fredrik
Bergh 6-3, 6-3.
In doubles competition, the sec
ond-seeded team of Scott
Humphries and Paul Goldstein also
bowed out in the semifinals, losing
to Mississippi's No. 3-seeded

Mahesh Bhupathi and Ali
Hamadeh, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.
The victory enabled the duo
from Ole Miss to exact a measure of
revenge from their Stanford coun
terparts, who defeated the Rebel
tandem during the final round of
the NCAA Team Championships.
Saturday's match stayed on
serve throughout the first set, but it
was the Rebels' strong service game
throughout the match that was
mainly responsible for their victory.
"They played really well. There
was nothing we could really do or
change to beat them," Humphries
said. "They came out and took it to
us. We were a little tired but they
just played well. They served really
big and that was the deciding fac
tor. They didn't miss many first
serves and they were hitting them
pretty well."
In the quarterfinals, the Stanford
tandem defeated Duke's Peter Ayers
and Rob Chess for the first time in
three tries this year, 6-3, 6-2.

In the second round, Humphries
and Goldstein defeated Indiana's
Erik Barrett and Derek Pope, 6-4,
6-3.
Despite the early round exits of
Humphries and Goldstein from sin
gles competition, Gould took away
some positives from the tourna
ments.
"Scott and Paul played flat ten
nis, emotionally drained tennis. It
was just a mental tiredness from
the team competition. In general,
though, it was a good tournament.
The young guys learned what it was
like and I think the experience will
help them next year."
Both Salzenstein and
Humphries earned Ail-American
honors this year — Salzenstein by
virtue of being ranked in the top 20
(finishing the season at No. 6) and
reaching the quarterfinals of the
NCAA Singles Championships, and
Humphries by virtue of being
ranked No. 10 at the close of the
season.
