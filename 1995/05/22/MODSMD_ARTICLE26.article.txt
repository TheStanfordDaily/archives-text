# Tiger battles diseases and beasts in New Mexico
## Men's golf qualifies for NCAAs 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Stanford men's golf coach Wally Goodwin has
repeatedly noted how much luck is involved in
winning matches. This past weekend's NCAA
Western Regionals only strengthened that convic
tion.
Falling victim to bizarre circumstances, the sec
ond-ranked Cardinal overcame the illness of
almost half its squad and a rough first round to
finish sixth in Albuquerque, N.M., and advance to
the NCAA Championships this week in Columbus,
Ohio. Pacific 10 Conference rival Arizona State
took the title, finishing 26 strokes ahead of Stan
ford.
A combination of food poisoning and dehydra
tion made its untimely attack on senior All-Amer
ican Casey Martin and freshman Tiger Woods, tak
ing Martin out of competition in the first round.
Woods, knowing the team would have to withdraw
should he falter, persevered through 18 holes,
often having to lie down or vomit between shots.
He received another surprise on the fifth hole
when a small snake startled him while he dug his
ball out of a bush. Woods still managed a par 72,
including five birdies, on the treacherous course.
After the round, both he and Martin were taken
to nearby University Hospital to be treated for gas
troenteritis.
"We thought Tiger was going to pass out on the
18th green," said senior Jerry Chang.
The loss of Martin on the first day forced Stan
ford to play one man short. As a result, the team
was forced to play four-count-four golf, tallying all
four players' scores in the team total rather than
dropping the worst one as they could have done if
they had been playing with a fifth teammate.
The situation was reminiscent of the Cardinal's
only home meet almost a month ago, when Woods
was scratched from competition by a shoulder
injury. Without him, the team turned in four flaw
less performances in the final round to take the
title. However, Stanford was unable to duplicate
such success this time around.
