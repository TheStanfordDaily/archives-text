# Tiger battles diseases and beasts in New Mexico
## Men's golf qualifies for NCAAs 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Stanford men's golf coach Wally Goodwin has
repeatedly noted how much luck is involved in
winning matches. This past weekend's NCAA
Western Regionals only strengthened that convic
tion.
Falling victim to bizarre circumstances, the sec
ond-ranked Cardinal overcame the illness of
almost half its squad and a rough first round to
finish sixth in Albuquerque, N.M., and advance to
the NCAA Championships this week in Columbus,
Ohio. Pacific 10 Conference rival Arizona State
took the title, finishing 26 strokes ahead of Stan
ford.
A combination of food poisoning and dehydra
tion made its untimely attack on senior All-Amer
ican Casey Martin and freshman Tiger Woods, tak
ing Martin out of competition in the first round.
Woods, knowing the team would have to withdraw
should he falter, persevered through 18 holes,
often having to lie down or vomit between shots.
He received another surprise on the fifth hole
when a small snake startled him while he dug his
ball out of a bush. Woods still managed a par 72,
including five birdies, on the treacherous course.
After the round, both he and Martin were taken
to nearby University Hospital to be treated for gas
troenteritis.
"We thought Tiger was going to pass out on the
18th green," said senior Jerry Chang.
The loss of Martin on the first day forced Stan
ford to play one man short. As a result, the team
was forced to play four-count-four golf, tallying all
four players' scores in the team total rather than
dropping the worst one as they could have done if
they had been playing with a fifth teammate.
The situation was reminiscent of the Cardinal's
only home meet almost a month ago, when Woods
was scratched from competition by a shoulder
injury. Without him, the team turned in four flaw
less performances in the final round to take the
title. However, Stanford was unable to duplicate
such success this time around.

Freshman Tiger Woods had to fight through a number
of difficulties to help Stanford make the NCAA cut.
"It was definitely nerve-rack
ing," Chang said. "I can't speak for
everyone, but I was really nervous
on that first tee, knowing that
every thing you do counts."
The effects of such nervousness
were clear as the squad muddled
through the first round, scoring a
295 and finishing the day behind 10
other schools and in danger of
falling out of contention for one of
the nine qualifying spots. However,
the team bounced back on the sec
ond and third days with Martin's
return to the lineup. The Cardinal
finished in the top three each of the
final two rounds to climb back up to
sixth by tournament's end.
"You get down to four guys, and
things get a little bit more tense,"
said senior Ail-American William
Yanagisawa. "You tend to be a little
bit more conservative. We really
didn't try for too much on the first
day — just pretty much tried not to
make any really big mistakes.
"Once we got everybody back,
things were OK. We played pretty
solid on the second and third days."
Yanagisawa and Woods, despite
his illness, both finished in the top
20, with respective scores of 217
and 216. The pair joined senior All-
American Notah Begay as the
anchors of Stanford's effort. While
their play was consistently strong,

however, Begay's was sparkling.
Returning to his hometown, Be gay
fired three straight sub-par scores
to finish third overall behind Mike
Sauer of New Mexico and Larry
Barber of Arizona State.
Barber wasn't the only Sun
Devil to do well. Four ASU golfers
finished in the top eight as the team
chalked up another victory against
the Cardinal. The Sun Devils have
won the last three tournaments in
which Stanford has competed.
"Arizona State played great,"
Chang said. "They've been as good
as anybody the last few weeks, and
they should be a contender for the
national championship."
ASU's dominating play aside,
one factor that worked against the
Cardinal and may have ultimately
helped the teams that finished
ahead of them was the placement of
the tee boxes. Typically making a
long course, which favors a long
hitting team such as Stanford, the
tees were moved up considerably on
the first and second days, giving
teams with less distance an equaliz
er.
"Moving the tees up definitely
gave the other teams a bit of an
advantage," Yanagisawa said.
Despite the disappointment of
finishing less than best, the team
remains upbeat about its prospects.
"This is not really a cause for
concern for us," Chang said. "In the
end, all that matters is nationals. If
that's the only tournament we win,
that's fine with us."
