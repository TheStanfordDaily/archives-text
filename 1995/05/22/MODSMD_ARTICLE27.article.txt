# Women sixth, men seventh at conference meet
## Track stuck in Pac-10 pack 
### Matthew Lawrence Staff writer 
The Stanford track team flew to Tucson, Ariz.,
for the Pacific 10 Conference Championships this
weekend, hoping to improve on the men's fifth place
and women's seventh place finish last year. The Car
dinal returned with mixed results: The men finished
seventh with 58 points, two points behind Califor
nia, and the women finished sixth with 76 points in
a closely contested team competition.
The all-around powerhouses UCLA and Oregon
took the top two spots on both the men's and
women's sides. Stanford found itself caught in a
closely contested team battle where only 14 points
separated the women's third and ninth places. The
Cardinal women were only five points from third
place California's 81 points. On the men's side, only
15 points stood between fifth and ninth places.
The story of these championships was the emer
gence of the freshmen and sophomores, who provid
ed the bulk of the points. A handful of veteran per
formers rose to the occasion and contributed, espe
cially in the throwing events.
"I think a lot of people came through with some
clutch performances," said junior co-captain Dena
Dey. "We came in and really competed well and got
as many points as we could out of our people. These
people [the freshman and sophomores] are only
going to get better."
One particular example was sophomore Monal
Chokshi, who won the 3,000 meters in nine min
utes, 38.16 seconds. In another of her trademark
come-from-behind victories, Chokshi made up
UCLA senior Karen Hecox's 30-meter lead in the
final lap to become the only Stanford Pac-10 winner.
"I kept going by runners, and then Hecox was
right there, and I gave everything I had," Chokshi
said. "I went from sixth place to first place in one
minute. It was like a dream."
Freshman Sarna Renfro followed five places
back, taking sixth place.
Dey continued her own impressive running with
a second-place finish in the 1,500 meters in 4:28.75.
Sophomore Leila Burr came in seventh in 4:33.36.
Freshman Kortney Dunscombe took second place
in the 10,000 meters, as senior Sarah Truitt came in

Sophomore Monal Chokshi and junior Dena Dey
were two bright spots for the Cardinal women.
fifth and sophomore Amy Mac Arthur finished
eighth to round out the Stanford scoring in the
longest event on the track.
Dunscombe returned to finish
in fourth place in the 5,000 meters
in 17.16.75, bringing behind her
Renfro in sixth and Truitt in sev
enth.
Freshman Sara Moore contin
ued to impress her conference
competition with a third-place fin
ish in the 800 meters in 2:10.12.
En route to a fifth place finish,
the 1,600-meter relay team of
junior Monica Hoggatt, senior
Christy Boyd, freshman Heather
Miller and sophomore Tyra Holt
set a school record in 3:41.27. One
coach had Miller timed at 53.8 for
her leg; that would be the fastest
400-meter time on the team this
year.
For the men, senior co-captain
Dave Popejoy led the scoring in the
hammer, taking the second spot

after USC's defending Pac-10 and
NCAA champion and collegiate
record holder junior Balazs Kiss.
Senior Toby Norwood took sixth in
a season-best 211 feet, and stand
out freshman Adam Connolly
threw the hammer 202-4 for eight
place.
Popejoy was one of only three
senior men to score at the champi
onships. Senior Travis Clark fin
ished in sixth place the weekend
before in the decathlon and took
seventh in the high jump this
weekend.
Senior Erik Spayde was the
third senior man to score with his
eighth-place finish in the 1,500
meters, good enough for one point.
Sophomore J.J. White demon
strated the core of the Stanford
running crew as he finished a close
second in the 5,000 meters in
14:37.31 behind Arizona senior
Martin Keino, who won three
events over the weekend. In the
10,000 meters sophomore Greg

Jimmerson, a cross-country All-
American, finished fourth, one
place ahead of junior Robert Reed
er.
In the 3,000 meter steeplechase
junior transfer Mark Fadil took
second behind Keino. Sophomore
Bryan Zmijewski took the final
scoring position in eighth place.
The ongoing weakness for the
Cardinal men is the lack of points
in the short sprints. Sophomore
Jimmie Johnson, plagued by a
hamstring injury, did not finish
the preliminary race of the 400
meters. Junior Branyon Davis,
also nursing a tender hamstring,
did not finish the 200 meters pre
liminary, and no Cardinal sprint
ers advanced to the finals of the
100 meters.
One bright point for the team
was the reemergence of sophomore
Brian Manning and junior Jami
Webb in the triple jump. Manning
fmished a close fourth, and Webb
fmished seventh.
