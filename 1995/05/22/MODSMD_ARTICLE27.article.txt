# Women sixth, men seventh at conference meet
## Track stuck in Pac-10 pack 
### Matthew Lawrence Staff writer 
The Stanford track team flew to Tucson, Ariz.,
for the Pacific 10 Conference Championships this
weekend, hoping to improve on the men's fifth place
and women's seventh place finish last year. The Car
dinal returned with mixed results: The men finished
seventh with 58 points, two points behind Califor
nia, and the women finished sixth with 76 points in
a closely contested team competition.
The all-around powerhouses UCLA and Oregon
took the top two spots on both the men's and
women's sides. Stanford found itself caught in a
closely contested team battle where only 14 points
separated the women's third and ninth places. The
Cardinal women were only five points from third
place California's 81 points. On the men's side, only
15 points stood between fifth and ninth places.
The story of these championships was the emer
gence of the freshmen and sophomores, who provid
ed the bulk of the points. A handful of veteran per
formers rose to the occasion and contributed, espe
cially in the throwing events.
"I think a lot of people came through with some
clutch performances," said junior co-captain Dena
Dey. "We came in and really competed well and got
as many points as we could out of our people. These
people [the freshman and sophomores] are only
going to get better."
One particular example was sophomore Monal
Chokshi, who won the 3,000 meters in nine min
utes, 38.16 seconds. In another of her trademark
come-from-behind victories, Chokshi made up
UCLA senior Karen Hecox's 30-meter lead in the
final lap to become the only Stanford Pac-10 winner.
"I kept going by runners, and then Hecox was
right there, and I gave everything I had," Chokshi
said. "I went from sixth place to first place in one
minute. It was like a dream."
Freshman Sarna Renfro followed five places
back, taking sixth place.
Dey continued her own impressive running with
a second-place finish in the 1,500 meters in 4:28.75.
Sophomore Leila Burr came in seventh in 4:33.36.
Freshman Kortney Dunscombe took second place
in the 10,000 meters, as senior Sarah Truitt came in
