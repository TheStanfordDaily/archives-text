# Pace too much for Bleszynski
## 
### Seth Goldstein Editorial staff 
Freshman Ania Bleszynski's run at the NCAA
singles title came to an abrupt end when she ran
into Texas's Kelly Pace in the round of 16 in Mal
ibu, Calif., on Friday. Pace, the top-ranked player
on the Longhorns' national championship squad
and the third-ranked player in the nation, defeated
the 19th-ranked Bleszynski 6-3, 6-3 before going on
to lose in the championship match to UCLA's Keri
Phebus.
"I think in the beginning I wasn't very confident
at all," Bleszynski said. "After all, she (Pace) was the
No. 1 player on the national championship squad
and seeded No. 1 in this tournament.

"Towards the end of the first set, and throughout
the second, I felt I could play with her, but by then
it may have been too late. She's so good, plus I made
too many mistakes to take advantage. However, I
think this match will actually give me confidence
entering next year."
Just hours earlier, Bleszynski had scored an
upset victory in the second round over fifth-ranked
Kori Davidson of Arizona State, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2.
"The day started out very well for Ania." said
Cardinal assistant coach Lele Forood. "She defeated
a real quality player in Kori Davidson, a senior.
Ania's serve was a really big weapon in that match.
But then in the second match (vs. Pace) Ania was
taught a pretty good lesson
against another senior and a
very experienced player. We
hope she learned a lot and will
apply it for next year."
Also falling on Friday was the
Cardinal's No. 2 doubles squad

of sophomore Emily Burt and
fourth-year junior Kim Shasby.
The 4lst-ranked duo lost to the
No. 14 combination of William
& Mary's Katrin Guenther and
Lauren Nikolaus in a strange
three-set match, 6-0, 0-6, 6-2.
The only Stanford represen
tative to escape into Saturday's
quarterfinals was the 10th
ranked doubles team of
Bleszynski and sophomore

Katie Schlukebir. The pair
defeated Texas's Farley Taylor
and Anne Pastor 6-2, 6-2 on
Friday before falling to Geor
gia's Tina Samara and Stacy
Sheppard on Saturday. After
winning the first set 6-1, the
Cardinal duo dropped a 7-5 tie
breaker to lose the second set 7-
6 and were eliminated from
competition after losing the
third set 6-4.
