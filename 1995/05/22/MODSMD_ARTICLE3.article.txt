## New dean of students will be chosen by the end of the quarter 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
The rush is on.
The University has decided to acceler
ate its effort to select a new dean of stu
dents, hoping to have the position filled
by the end of the quarter.
The administration also intends to
make the selection process open and de
mocratic, as students will have the op
portunity to meet personally with and
evaluate the candidates.
Four candidates are finalists for the
position, which became vacant when for
mer Dean Michael Jackson left Stanford
in late March to become vice president of
student affairs at USC.
The candidates, who will visit campus

this week, are: Marc Lee Wais, assistant
vice president for student affairs at the
University of Maryland at Baltimore;
Charles Kenyon, assistant vice presi
dent for student affairs for the State
University of New York College at Buf
falo; Joseph Navarro, associate dean of
students at UC-Santa Barbara; and Pa
tricia Brown, director of the Center for
Student Life at California State Univer
sity-Los Angeles.
According to Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds, the
open student meetings were arranged to
encourage involvement and overcome
student apathy regarding University af
fairs.
Along with the open invitation, Ed
monds' office has also been distributing

descriptions and qualifications of the
candidates.
"We really want to get students in
volved in making the decision of who will
be the next dean of students," Edmonds
said. "The position is among the most
important in the University because it
has an effect on the lives of students
every day."
Edmonds said her decision to acceler
ate the selection process was motivated
by a desire to pick the new dean while
students were on campus and their opin
ions were available for consultation.
"Students often complain that we ad
ministrators make decisions in their ab
sence," Edmonds said. "I want to make
sure that students have a voice in find-
ing a replacement for this impor
tant and far-reaching post."
Additionally, Edmonds said

University administrators want
ed a new dean in place before the
beginning of the fall quarter.
"It gives a sense of continuity
and the administrators know who
they will be working with,"
Edmonds said. She added that
the hectic nature of the autumn

quarter for administrators makes
it all the more important that an
administrator be in place and
familiar with the post.
The Office of the Dean of Stu
dents is responsible for overseeing
almost every aspect of student life
on campus. The office has a $4

million budget.
Students who attend this
week's meetings will be asked to
give evaluations of the candi
dates. The meetings begin today
and run through Wednesday in
the Tresidder Union Cypress
Room from 4 to 5 p.m.
