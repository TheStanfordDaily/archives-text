# Red Wings destroy Sharks with 6-0 win in first game
## 
### 
DETROIT (AP) - The San
Jose Sharks used the same
clutch-and-grab tactics that had
worked so well against Detroit in
last year's playoffs. This time,
the Red Wings made them pay.
And pay and pay and pay.
The Red Wings, venting a
year's worth of frustration, got
their revenge yesterday with a 6-
0 victory. It was their third
straight shutout of the Sharks
at Joe Louis Arena this season.
"One thing we've done this
year, the whole team, is we don't
care what the other team does,"
Detroit forward Shawn Burr
said. "We're a smarter bunch of
guys."
The Red Wings, upset in the
first round of the NHL playoffs a
year ago by the upstart Sharks,
had three power-play goals and a
short-handed goal to take a 1-0
lead in the Western Conference
semifinal series.
Game 2 is scheduled for Tues
day night in Detroit before
action shifts to San Jose for the
next two games in the best-of-7
series.
A year ago, the Sharks' dis
ruptive tactics helped them win
the first game of their first
round series. The Red Wings,
again seeded No. 1, never led in
that series and lost in seven
games.
But the Sharks have yet to
score in Detroit in 1995.
"I thought Detroit was the
best team in the Western Con
ference last year, but they are a
better team this year," Sharks
coach Kevin Constantino said.

"They are more complete than
before."
During the abbreviated sea
son, the Red Wings were 4-0
against the Sharks, outscoring
San Jose 19-4 and outshooting
them 145-67. Two of those
games, both in Detroit, were
shutouts.
Detroit outshot the Sharks
33-15 on Sunday. It was the Red
Wings' biggest shutout victory
in a playoff game since an 8-0
win over Toronto on April 10,
1988.
It was the first playoff
shutout for Detroit goalie Mike
Vernon since May 2, 1989, when
he defeated Chicago 1-0. Vernon
also shut out San Jose 3-0 on
April 13.
"We had six days off, so it was
kind of hard to get back into
things early," Vernon said. "I
was just glad they tested me a
few times in the first period, so I
could get going. It would have
been tougher if they hadn't test
ed me until later on."
Dino Ciccarelli and Paul Cof
fey scored in the second period.
Doug Brown, Ray Shepperd,
Sergei Fedorov and Kris Draper
added to the rout in the third,
bringing an octopus barrage
down from the stands. The octo
pus became a staple of Detroit
playoff hockey back when the
NHL was a six-team league and
it took eight victories to win the
Stanley Cup.
Fedorov also assisted on three
goals.
"It's too early to say what is
different this year," said

Fedorov, who also assisted on
three goals. "They just came off
a tough Game 7 in Calgary, and
that would be tough on any
team.
"Getting the rest definitely
helped us. We'll just have to see
how well we can build on this."
It was the first playoff loss for
Flaherty, who relieved Arturs
Irbe for the final three minutes
of Game 5 against Calgary, then
made his first playoff start in
Game 6. Flaherty won the final
two games to lift the Sharks into
the conference semifinals for the
second consecutive season.
"I played steady," Flaherty
said. "But, obviously, when you
give up six goals it doesn't look
that way. They're a great team.
They move the puck around.
They get a lot of traffic around
the net."
The Red Wings, who won
their first-round series in five
games with Dallas, appeared
sluggish in the early going. The
Sharks, who went two overtimes
before dispatching Calgary in
seven games of the first round,
were outshot 8-7 in the first
period. Yet the Sharks had at
least three quality shots during
those 20 minutes.
"If you look at the score,
you'd think it was an easy win,
but Mike Vernon won the game
with those big saves in the first
period," Detroit coach Scotty
Bowman said. "If they score the
first goal, it is a whole different
game. You need playoff goal
tending, and we got that in the
first period."
