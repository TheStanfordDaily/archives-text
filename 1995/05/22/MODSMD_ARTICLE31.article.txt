# Will Joe Smith be making an appearance in Oakland?
## Warriors nab top pick in draft 
### 
SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) - The Golden State
Warriors, who lost two coaches in a turbulent sea
son in which they sent Chris Webber packing,
opened the off-season on the right foot yesterday
by getting the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft.
The Warriors, with the fifth worst record in the
league, had a 9.4 percent chance of winning the
first selection in the weighted system that gives the
worst teams the best chance at the top picks.
However, the Warriors overcame the odds for
the June 28 draft in Toronto in which the first four
players might be underclassmen — big men Joe
Smith of Maryland, Antonio McDyess of Alabama,
Rasheed Wallace of North Carolina and teammate
Jerry Stachhouse, a swingman.
The Los Angeles Clippers, the league's worst
team, will get the No. 2 choice.
Philadelphia, which had the fourth worst
record, won the No. 3 pick. Washington, which had
the second worst record, dropped to No. 4 and Min
nesota, the third worst club, drew the No. 5 pick.
Expansion teams Vancouver and Toronto will
get the sixth and seventh picks, with the order to be
decided after the NBA Finals.
The eighth through 13th picks went in the order
the teams finished the regular season. Detroit
received the eighth selection and will be followed by
New Jersey, Miami, Milwaukee, Dallas and Sacra
mento.
Had Detroit gotten lower than No. 8, San Anto

nio would have had the right to swap with the Pis
tons, something commissioner David Stern noted.
He turned to new Pistons coach Doug Collins
shortly after the position was announced and said:
"Feeling better."
Dave Twardzik, the Warriors' new general man
ager, also was feeling better. Just days after hiring
Rick Adelman as his new coach, he now has the top
pick.
"Now our homework starts," Twardzik said.
"We have to figure out who we want."
Twardzik said no one player in the deep draft
stands out, but the Warriors do need a big man,
which means Smith might be the No. 1 pick.
The Warriors went 26-56 last season in a year in
which Don Nelson resigned and was replaced on an
interim basis by Bob Lanier. The season was also
marked by a multiplayer trade that sent Webber to
Washington for Tom Gugliotta and three first
round draft picks. Gugliotta was eventually traded
to Minnesota.
Clippers coach Bill Fitch wasn't overly disap
pointed having the second pick.
"The No. 1 thing about this draft is there are
four or five guys who will get a lot of considera
tion," said Fitch, whose team had 17 wins last sea
son.
"If you asked all of the people up here and took
a consensus vote, I doubt that you would get one or
two players that would stand out."
