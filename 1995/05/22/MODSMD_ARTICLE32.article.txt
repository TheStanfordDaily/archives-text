SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
After hitting .117 with no homers
in his first 60 major league at
bats, St. Louis rookie Tripp
Cromer suddenly became a slug
ger.^
Cromer, filling in at shortstop
for the injured Ozzie Smith, hit
his second homer in two days to
spark a three-run fifth as the Car
dinals defeated the San Francisco
Giants 9-7 yesterday despite
allowing 17 hits.
Steve Scarsone had five hits for
the Giants and Matt Williams
raised his average to .387 with
three doubles and a single.
Williams, who began the day lead
ing the National League in
homers (10) and RBIs, also drove
in two runs to push his total to 29.
"I wouldn't have felt safe with
a 10-run lead in the bottom of the
ninth," Cromer said of a game
that featured six pitchers for each
team.
Cromer began the season with

two hits in 23 major-league at
bats, and was 5-for-37 entering
Saturday's game. He went 2-for-4
in that game, including a homer
that barely cleared the left-field
fence, and hit a solo shot Sunday
down the left-field line.
"I got a couple of hits and they
happened to be home runs," said
Cromer, who is playing while
Smith battles tendonitis in his
right shoulder.
Cromer broke a 3-3 tie by
homering to lead off the fifth.
Jose Oquendo hit an RBI double
three batters later, and Todd Zeile
added a run-scoring grounder.
Tom Pagnozzi had a two-run
single and Darnell Coles and Ger
ald Perry added RBI singles for
the Cardinals, who had lost five of
their previous six games.
Rich DeLucia (1-2), the second
St. Louis pitcher, was the winner
despite getting only four outs.
Tom Henke got his eighth save.
St. Louis starter Tom Urbani

allowed four runs on nine hits in 4
1/3 innings.
Terry Mulholland (2-4)
allowed six runs on eight hits in
four innings for the Giants.
Scarsone and Kirt Manwaring
hit solo homers for the Giants,
the first of the season for each.
The seldom-used Scarsone, filling
in for the slumping Robby
Thompson, raised his average to
.500 by going 5-for-5.
"I'm not in there all that
much, so I'll relish this for a little
while," Scarsone said. "On Tues
day, I'm sure things'll be back to
normal and I'll be preparing to
pinch-hit late in the game."
Williams doubled in a run in
the first, scored after hitting a
ground-rule double in the fifth,
hit another ground-rule double in
the seventh and singled in a run
in the eighth.
Manwaring and Royce Clayton
added run-scoring singles for the
Giants.
