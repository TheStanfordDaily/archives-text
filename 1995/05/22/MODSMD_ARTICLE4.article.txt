# Athletes honored after the fact
## 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
Though they swam laps, shot baskets
and scored goals for Stanford decades ago,
thousands of female athletes didn't get
University recognition until Friday night.
Stanford women who competed in
sports before the 1972 passage of Title IX
— a law requiring gender equity in college
sports — received "Block S" awards for
their accomplishments. More than 2,200
alumnae were invited to the event, which
made Stanford the first university in the
country to recognize its pre-Title IX fe
male athletes.
Many of the hundreds of women filling

Arrillaga Sports Center expressed mixed
emotions on the occasion.
"There's a little bitterness that it's
taken Stanford so long to recognize female
athletes," said Elizabeth Primrose-Smith,
who won a gold medal at the 1963 Pan-
American Games in swimming, was an
All-American in water polo and a nation
ally-ranked tennis player.
Since no athletic scholarships were of
fered to women when Primrose-Smith ap
plied to Stanford in 1964, the women's
physical education director would not look
at Primrose-Smith's application because
she didn't want to give her any "special
treatment."
Knowing that she would have qualified

for the Stanford Hall of Fame if women
were accepted during her college years,
Primrose-Smith said she felt that she had
competed at the wrong time.
"I'm happy that Stanford is recogniz
ing the women, though," Primrose-Smith
said.
Barbara Finn, a volleyball player, came
to Stanford in 1971. She remembers not
being allowed to play at Maples Pavilion.
The team was only allowed to play on
blacktop outside, so players had to drive to
San Francisco for practices.
"We'd go anywhere we could find a
gym. We drove every day," Finn said.
Since the team members had to
pay their own transportation
costs, their mothers often drove
a. is bittersweet," Finn
tL brings back a lot of
painful memories, but it's nice to
get recognition."
Unlike today, female athletes
often retired before going to col
lege because of the lack of athletic
scholarships. Sharon Clark won
three gold medals and a silver in
swimming at the 1964 Olympic
Games in Tokyo at the age of 15.
She swam with the men while
at Stanford, but most of her
Olympic teammates retired after
the games. "There wasn't any
reason to keep going," Clark said.
Clark added that she feels
pleased with the event, saying the
University and the public are now
"appreciating that women do it
too. We can achieve excellence,
which is inspiring."
Even the rules for some
women's sports were drastically
different in those days. When
Charlotte McClung played bas
ketball here between 1949 and
1951, there were three guards
and three forwards. The guards
couldn't cross the half-court
mark and couldn't shoot. There
were no substitutes and men
couldn't watch the games.
Despite the poor resources,

competing in Stanford athletics
did provide a lot of benefits, the
women agreed.
"We weren't ever mentioned in
The Daily, but we had so much
fun, we didn't even realize we
should get recognition," said
Allean Richter, who ran track in
1968-69.
Richter said athletics gave her
qualities that she has used in the
years since, including aggressive
ness, team spirit and interperson
al skills.
"Sports was a catalyst for suc
cess," she said. "I'm glad I partic
ipated."
Anne Warner Cribbs, a Stan
ford alumna who won a gold
medal in swimming at the 1960
Olympic games at the age of 15,
told the women at the ceremony,
"Your efforts made it possible for
our daughters to have opportuni
ties [in athletics], and for that I
thank you."
Cheryl Levick, senior associate
athletic director, spoke to the
women and their families during
the ceremony. "This celebration
is at least 20 years late, maybe
even more for some," she said.
Levick said the fact that the
number of female collegiate ath
letes has increased five-fold since
1972 shows the importance of
Title IX, which was passed by
Congress and required universi
ties to provide equal facilities and
opportunities for men's and
women's sports. Before this fed
eral legislation, women athletes
practiced and competed with vir

tually no support from the Uni
versity.
For example, in 1969, Stanford
provided a traveling budget of
$1.5 million for its male athletes,
while female athletes received
$3,500, according to Margie Sher,
a former Stanford swimmer who
developed the idea for the event.
In fact, the only athletic program
for women at Stanford was orga
nized through what was then the
Physical Education Department.
Today, Stanford has 325
women varsity athletes and 18
NCAA women's team champi
onships.
Senior Anne Wicks, captain of
this year's volleyball team, gave
the final speech. "I've tried hard
to put myself in your shoes, but
my experience has been so differ
ent," she said.
Wicks said her team flies to all
of their competitions, has spon
sors who pay for their shoes and
uniforms, and plays in crowded
arenas. Team members even get
recognized by the public while
shopping. She said she and her
fellow athletes owe a lot to the
women athletes who came before
them.
"You've created a winning,
classy women's athletic pro
gram," Wicks told the women.
"Not many schools can say that."
After the ceremony, the
women received their "Block S"
certificates. "You have now final
ly become a part of the Stanford
varsity athletic program," Levick
said. "Congratulations."
