# Athletes honored after the fact

Though they swam laps, shot baskets
and scored goals for Stanford decades ago,
thousands of female athletes didn't get
University recognition until Friday night.
Stanford women who competed in
sports before the 1972 passage of Title IX
— a law requiring gender equity in college
sports — received "Block S" awards for
their accomplishments. More than 2,200
alumnae were invited to the event, which
made Stanford the first university in the
country to recognize its pre-Title IX fe
male athletes.
Many of the hundreds of women filling

Arrillaga Sports Center expressed mixed
emotions on the occasion.
"There's a little bitterness that it's
taken Stanford so long to recognize female
athletes," said Elizabeth Primrose-Smith,
who won a gold medal at the 1963 Pan-
American Games in swimming, was an
All-American in water polo and a nation
ally-ranked tennis player.
Since no athletic scholarships were of
fered to women when Primrose-Smith ap
plied to Stanford in 1964, the women's
physical education director would not look
at Primrose-Smith's application because
she didn't want to give her any "special
treatment."
Knowing that she would have qualified

for the Stanford Hall of Fame if women
were accepted during her college years,
Primrose-Smith said she felt that she had
competed at the wrong time.
"I'm happy that Stanford is recogniz
ing the women, though," Primrose-Smith
said.
Barbara Finn, a volleyball player, came
to Stanford in 1971. She remembers not
being allowed to play at Maples Pavilion.
The team was only allowed to play on
blacktop outside, so players had to drive to
San Francisco for practices.
"We'd go anywhere we could find a
gym. We drove every day," Finn said.
