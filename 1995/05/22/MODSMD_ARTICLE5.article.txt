## Obscene phone calls rising in number 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
A man identifying himself as
Oscar has been the most preva
lent offender in a recent rash of
obscene phone calls to women
on campus.
In the last week of April and
the first two weeks of May, six
women independently reported
receiving sexually explicit
phone calls from a man who
called himself Oscar. The sus

ford Police say they have few
means of tracing the precise
identity of obscene callers.
The suspect usually knows
the women's first and last
names when he calls them. "He
asked for me by name and I
thought I was being selected

she said. "He identified himself

to come over and have sex with
me."
According to the woman, the
caller had a "sweet young voice"
and knew enough about her to
make her believe he was a Stan
ford student.
The suspect in one instance
also spoke fluent Spanish to a
freshman woman. "He- said
stuff like Tm coming' in Span
ish and I thought he knew me,
but then I remembered that we
have Spanish on our answering
machine," she added.
While all the women were re
lieved that they were not alone
as victims, most were angry and
annoyed at the harassment.
"It's so stupid that we have to
take the precautions because
