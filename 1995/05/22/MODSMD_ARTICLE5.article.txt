# Oscar the lech
## Obscene phone calls rising in number 
### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
A man identifying himself as
Oscar has been the most preva
lent offender in a recent rash of
obscene phone calls to women
on campus.
In the last week of April and
the first two weeks of May, six
women independently reported
receiving sexually explicit
phone calls from a man who
called himself Oscar. The sus
pect remains at large, and Stan
ford Police say they have few
means of tracing the precise
identity of obscene callers.
The suspect usually knows
the women's first and last
names when he calls them. "He
asked for me by name and I
thought I was being selected
out," said a law student who re
ceived two calls from Oscar.
"But my name is listed and he
didn't say anything that would
lead me to believe he knew who
I was."
The caller, according to one
junior, was quite threatening.
"I told him he was not going to
have sex with me and he was
forcefully saying that yes, he
will have sex with me," she said.
One female sophomore re

ceived four calls from Oscar and
said it sounded like ho was mas
turbating on the phone while
talking to her. "He said things
like 'I'm rubbing my cock,' "
she said.
In one case, a senior woman
felt that the caller knew who
she was."He said he was a Stan
ford student ... and he knew
the name of a friend of mine,"
she said. "He identified himself
ay Oscar and he said he wanted
to come over and have sex with
me."
According to the woman, the
caller had a "sweet young voice"
and knew enough about her to
make her believe he was a Stan
ford student.
The suspect in one instance
also spoke fluent Spanish to a
freshman woman. "He- said
stuff like Tm coming' in Span
ish and I thought he knew me,
but then I remembered that we
have Spanish on our answering
machine," she added.
While all the women were re
lieved that they were not alone
as victims, most were angry and
annoyed at the harassment.
"It's so stupid that we have to
take the precautions because
some misogynist jerk thinks he
can call up women and harass
them," the female law student
said.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said that one woman
has already recorded the caller's
voice and advised anyone else who

receives calls from the man to try
to record his voice and report it to
the police. "That might help iden
tify the mail," he said.
Last year, 109 harassing phone
calls were reported to the police. In
the past month, at least 25 harass
ing calls have been reported, but
only in seven cases has the caller
identified himself as Oscar.
Niemeyer said there is very lit
tle that police can do about

obscene phone calls. The source
can only be traced if the caller is
dialing from a campus phone, he
said.
Often, Niemeyer added, callers
change phones or use pay phones
to make the calls. Even if police
manage to trace the phone and
obtain a Stanford number, pin
ning down a caller is difficult.
"People will say that they have
a lot of parties and that a lot of

people use their phones," said
Stanford Police Sgt. John
McMullen. He added that prosecu
tion in obscene caller cases is
"practically nil."
McMullen also said victims can
use a device called a "line minder"
in which must callers enter a
secret code in order for the call to
go through.
"We advise people to change
their number," Niemeyer said.
