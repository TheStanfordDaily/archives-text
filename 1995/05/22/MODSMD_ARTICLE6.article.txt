## Canin is both doctor, writer

It is the ultimate techie-turns-fuzzy success story,
one that began at Stanford in Fiction Writing 90 and
ended in the New York Times Best Seller List.
Eight years ago, Ethan Canin was a medical stu
dent at Harvard with a habit of not going to class, liv
ing in a studio apartment with dishes stacked to the
ceiling. He read the books for his classes but wrote
short stories instead of studying.
During exam time, when he was taking two a day,
Canin got a phone call from a publishing company in
terested in publishing a book of his short stories.
Shortly after that, his agent called to say he'd won the
prestigious Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship.
"I remember moving out in the street and nearly
getting hit. And of course, there was nobody in Med
School I could tell. They didn't understand what it
meant," Canin said.
As a Stanford undergraduate, Canin began as a
mechanical engineering major, but eventually
changed his mind after taking fiction writing classes.
"It was on the next page in the course catalogue. I
then took English 190. I decided to become an Eng
lish major because of those two classes," he said.
He added that his favorite class was Nancy Pack
er's Development of the Short Story, which played a
big role in his interest in writing short stories, and is
now taught by English Prof. John L'Heureux.
"Stanford is great. Not too
many universities offer creative
writing for undergraduates,"
Canin said. "Suddenly being sur
rounded by a group of 30 or 40
students who would give anything
to become writers was fundamen
tal in my becoming a writer. It
really inspired me."
It was in that creative writing
class that Prof. Mike Coch sub
mitted one of Canin's stories for
publication. After a few rejections,
it was finally published in a small
literary magazine, which Canin
still remembers as the biggest
thrill of his life, even more so than
any book he published or any per
son he met — including author
John Irving.
Canin was still at the Farm
when he started getting published
in large-circulation magazines
like Redbook. After graduation,
Canin went on to attend the lowa
Writer's Workshop, where he
part-timed as teacher and editor
of the lowa Review. In lowa he
started writing stories that would
eventually become the collection
"Emperor of the Air," the New
York Times best seller that cata
pulted him into literary stardom.
Since then he has published a
novel, "Blue River," and another
critically acclaimed book of short
stories, "The Palace Thief."
When he does not have book
tours or other literary engage
ments, Canin practices medicine
two days a week. He writes every
day in an office he shares with five
other writers.
"I try to work on five or six sto
ries at once. When you come
inevitably to the point where you
can't think of the next word, it's
nice to be able to put it aside for a
few months," Canin said. "Start
ing is very hard. I hate starting.
I'd rather do anything in the
world, like clean the house. But
after that, it comes pretty easily.
"I usually write 500 to 1,000
words a day, and that comes out in
half an hour, after sitting for an
hour in front of the computer."
In order to write, according to
Canin, there must be a situation
and a voice. "If you have that, the
rest will be born on its own."
While at Stanford, Canin
played in the Stanford Band, edit
ed and read news at KZSU and did
the espresso thing at the Coffee
House, where he met his future
wife.
"I lived in a co-op that didn't
have any napkins, and I remem
ber wanting to wipe my hands,"
Canin said. "I remember looking

at my empty mail box, not going to
Meyer Library until my senior
year, and one student passing out
during Creative Writing when her
story was read. There was an
ambulance driving through the
Quad."
He went to Harvard Medical
School because, he said, he "need
ed to get a job." At the time, he
hadn't published a book yet and
was not a big name in literary cir
cles. This, however, may be a sign
of his modesty. By the time he was
25, Canin's stories had already
appeared in Esquire, The Atlantic
and Ploughshares and had been
reprinted in"The Best American
Short Stories" compilations in
both 1985 and 1986.
"I went to med school with the
tail between my legs, defeated,"
Canin said, because he had not yet
earned much through his writing.
At Harvard, he finished the
"Emperor of the Air" stories,
which are critically acclaimed
tales of ordinary people facing the
complexities of their own lives. In
his work, Canin approaches sim
ple situations and bathes them in
meaning and artistry, moving
them into another realm.
Canin said he does not write
about his own experiences or
about people he knows, something
done by many writers, most
notably John Updike.
"It's all the work of the imagi
nation," Canin said. "When you
rely too much on memory, it's
hard to do anything else. You
either imagine the whole thing or
you remember the whole thing."
Canin is now working on
another novel, a novella and a
third book of short stories.
"1 try to read and see a lot of
movies and put myself in new sit
uations," Canin said. "You never
know when something is going to
strike you. You talk a lot about
people and you hear something
that excites your interest."
