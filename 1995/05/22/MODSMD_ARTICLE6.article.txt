It is the ultimate techie-turns-fuzzy success story,
one that began at Stanford in Fiction Writing 90 and
ended in the New York Times Best Seller List.
Eight years ago, Ethan Canin was a medical stu
dent at Harvard with a habit of not going to class, liv
ing in a studio apartment with dishes stacked to the
ceiling. He read the books for his classes but wrote
short stories instead of studying.
During exam time, when he was taking two a day,
Canin got a phone call from a publishing company in
terested in publishing a book of his short stories.
Shortly after that, his agent called to say he'd won the
prestigious Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship.
"I remember moving out in the street and nearly
getting hit. And of course, there was nobody in Med
School I could tell. They didn't understand what it
meant," Canin said.
As a Stanford undergraduate, Canin began as a
mechanical engineering major, but eventually
changed his mind after taking fiction writing classes.
"It was on the next page in the course catalogue. I
then took English 190. I decided to become an Eng
lish major because of those two classes," he said.
He added that his favorite class was Nancy Pack
er's Development of the Short Story, which played a
big role in his interest in writing short stories, and is
now taught by English Prof. John L'Heureux.
