# Vigil commemorates those infected with AIDS
## A
						night of remembrance 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
In the first of a series of events mark
ing AIDS Awareness Week at Stanford, a
group of approximately 25 took a moment
last night to consider those stricken with
the disease, sharing personal stories and
lighting candles of remembrance.
Students of Psychology 180 A, "Psy
chosocial Perspectives of HIV Preven
tion," helped orchestrate AIDS Aware
ness Week activities as the culmination of
their classroom experience. Carole
Pertofsky, director of health promotion
and a disease prevention specialist at
Cowell Student Health Center who has
taught the class for three years, expressed
hope that the candlelight vigil will be
come a Stanford tradition.
"This really brings out the communi
ty," Pertofsky said, adding that her class
has grown substantially in the past few
years. In addition, Stanford AIDS Aware
ness Week, which was first observed in
1992, will reflect the larger, national
AIDS awareness movement by hosting
the founder of the NAMES Project AIDS
Memorial Quilt, she said.
Quyen To and Michael Belmontes,
both members of Pertefsky's class, direct-

Ed last night's vigil to coincide with the
12th Annual International AIDS Candle
light Memorial, which was observed in
approximately 250 cities in 47 nations.
"It's a moment for people to reflect,"
said Belmontes, who has known several
individuals who have died from the dis
ease. "We know about it, but we don't
identify with it. This shows that at the
deathbed of a friend there is opportunity
to give compassion and support."
After lighting candles in White Plaza,
participants walked silently through the
Quad to the Oval, where they sat on the
grass and shared their experiences with
HIV.
"We gather here today to celebrate the
hope, the compassion, the love that comes
from suffering," said Belmontes, as tears
fell from his face. "We hope that this
flame will continue to light compassion
and love for those living with HIV."
"In the face of AIDS I've often felt
helpless," said To, who spoke next. "But
in the process of putting this event to
gether, I was surprised by the people who
came forth, who came together. AIDS has
made us angry, scared, sad. Sometimes it
engenders prejudice and hatred amongst
