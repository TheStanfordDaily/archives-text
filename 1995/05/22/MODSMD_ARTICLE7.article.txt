# Vigil commemorates those infected with AIDS
## A 						night of remembrance 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
In the first of a series of events mark
ing AIDS Awareness Week at Stanford, a
group of approximately 25 took a moment
last night to consider those stricken with
the disease, sharing personal stories and
lighting candles of remembrance.
Students of Psychology 180 A, "Psy
chosocial Perspectives of HIV Preven
tion," helped orchestrate AIDS Aware
ness Week activities as the culmination of
their classroom experience. Carole
Pertofsky, director of health promotion
and a disease prevention specialist at
Cowell Student Health Center who has
taught the class for three years, expressed
hope that the candlelight vigil will be
come a Stanford tradition.
"This really brings out the communi
ty," Pertofsky said, adding that her class
has grown substantially in the past few
years. In addition, Stanford AIDS Aware
ness Week, which was first observed in
1992, will reflect the larger, national
AIDS awareness movement by hosting
the founder of the NAMES Project AIDS
Memorial Quilt, she said.
Quyen To and Michael Belmontes,
both members of Pertefsky's class, direct-

Ed last night's vigil to coincide with the
12th Annual International AIDS Candle
light Memorial, which was observed in
approximately 250 cities in 47 nations.
"It's a moment for people to reflect,"
said Belmontes, who has known several
individuals who have died from the dis
ease. "We know about it, but we don't
identify with it. This shows that at the
deathbed of a friend there is opportunity
to give compassion and support."
After lighting candles in White Plaza,
participants walked silently through the
Quad to the Oval, where they sat on the
grass and shared their experiences with
HIV.
"We gather here today to celebrate the
hope, the compassion, the love that comes
from suffering," said Belmontes, as tears
fell from his face. "We hope that this
flame will continue to light compassion
and love for those living with HIV."
"In the face of AIDS I've often felt
helpless," said To, who spoke next. "But
in the process of putting this event to
gether, I was surprised by the people who
came forth, who came together. AIDS has
made us angry, scared, sad. Sometimes it
engenders prejudice and hatred amongst

us. But AIDS cannot ever stop us
from coming together despite our
differences."
Huddled under an overcast sky
and shielding their candles from
the wind, most of the participants
sat in silence as a few remembered
friends and shared their thoughts
on the devastating disease.
Patty Castaneda-Davis recited
a poem she had written in memo
ry of a friend who had died recent

ly from AIDS and spoke of her
experience struggling against the
disease with him and his family.
"It is so easy to forget, to pretend,
to ignore it," she said.
To another friend struck down
by AIDS, Michael Halaas took up
his guitar and dedicated a song he
had written. "I miss him every
day,"he said, simply.
Aly Feldman, a senior and
teaching assistant for the class,
explained why she had decided to
spend so much of her time edu
cating the community about and
helping those afflicted with
AIDS.

"A question I get a lot of the
time is, 'Why HIV?' " she said. "I
hear that asked as if someone
close to me were affected. In my
work I give a lot of love and I get a
lot of love — if you ask me what
the meaning of life is, I think it's
that connection you make with
other people."
"It's a bittersweet night," said
Pertofsky to those gathered.
"Don't let your pain dampen your
rage. That pain can be mobilizing.
Keep fighting. Keep fighting for
the cure."
Asked why she had decided to
attend the event, junior Jennifer

Kerns said, "I think its a good
opportunity both to form some
connection between everybody s
individual thoughts. It brings
power to the movement."
"People are living with and
dying from AIDS,' said Angela
Amarillas, giving her reason for
sitting in the cold night air.
"That's it."
"As long as AIDS robs us of our
children, brothers, sisters, lovers,
mothers and fathers, our hope is
Stanford will always have a light
of hope," said To, in a few parting
words. "I hope that you'll cariy
this experience with you."
