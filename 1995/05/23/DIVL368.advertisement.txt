Surprise your folks.
When you stay awake in class, you tend to learn more. (Unless you have an uncanny
talent of learning through osmosis.) So don't let fatigue get in the way of your A, Revive
with Vivarin*. One tablet has the same amount of caffeine as about two cups of coffee.
And it's just as safe. Hey, anything is possible, if you're up for it.
