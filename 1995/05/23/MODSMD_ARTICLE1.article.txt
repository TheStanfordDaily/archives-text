# Amid concerns, a reaffirmation of Portuguese
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
While fears arise that Portuguese language in
struction at Stanford is in jeopardy due to the recent
death of Senior Lecturer Karin Van den Dool, the
search for her replacement is being moved along as
quickly as possible.
"The department has not met to discuss finding a
replacement for Van den Dool," said Spanish and Por
tuguese Chair Guadalupe Valdes. "When we do meet,
I am sure we will act almost immediately to discuss
recommendations and opinions for filling her posi
tion. It's basically a formality before we put in our
final petition to fill the spot on a permanent basis,"
Valdes said.
Van den Dool, who passed away suddenly on May
8, was the only full-time faculty member teaching
Portuguese in the department. Her teaching duties
are now being handled by Lyris Wiedemann, a visiting
professor of Portuguese from UC-Berkeley.
The Spanish and Portuguese Department faculty
has yet to meet and review recommendations before
passing on its petition for a replacement to Humani
ties and Sciences Dean John Shoven, according to
Valdes.
Language department staff members suggested
the Portuguese program will not be eliminated under
budget cutbacks. Stanford's language programs have
recently been the target of several major budget cuts
and restructuring; last year, for example, the Univer
sity merged the previously distinct language depart
ments into a single unit.
Colleagues credit Van den Dool as a key force in
keeping the Portuguese program alive in the face of
budgetary cutbacks. Her death raised concern among
students that the program might be cut in order to
pare the budget of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
Among those concerned is freshman Jessica
Berkowitz, who has organized a letter-writing cam
paign to insure that Stanford continues to offer Por
tuguese language study.
"I want to make sure that the opportunity to study
Portuguese remains open to students here at Stan
ford," Berkowitz said. "It's a valuable resource that


'lam committed to
keeping the depart
ment of Spanish and
Portuguese, the
department of Span
ish an Portuguese.'
â€” Guadalupe Valdes
opens up cultural opportunities to
students."
In addition to writing to Uni
versity administrators, Berkowitz
has obtained the cooperation of
the Chicano / Latino student
organization MEChA. Using their
mailing lists, she has sent notices
asking students to send letters to
University administrators to

spare the program from budget
cutbacks.
Berkowitz is also asking stu
dents to emphasize the impor
tance of Portuguese in their let
ters. California has a large Por
tuguese-speaking minority, she
said, and the elimination of the
Portuguese program would "cer
tainly hurt the study of Latin
American and Latino culture."
Department administrators
also emphasized the department's
importance.
The department enrolls

approximately 50 students per
academic year, said Kyle
Wohlmut, an administrative
assistant with the Department of
Linguistics.
"Right now, the department is
very optimistic about having the
position filled," Wohlmut said.
Valdes also assured those con
cerned that the process was mov
ing as fast as possible and said "I
am committed to keeping the
Department of Spanish and Por
tuguese, the Department of Span
ish and Portuguese."
