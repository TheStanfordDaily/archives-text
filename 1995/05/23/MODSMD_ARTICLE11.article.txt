Bomb suspect released
DETROIT (AP) â€” James Nichols,
whose brother and a friend are charged
in the Oklahoma bombing, was ordered
released without bail yesterday despite a
prosecutor's suggestion that he was
involved in the deadly attack.
"There is not an iota of evidence that
he is a danger to others," U.S. District
Judge Paul Borman ruled. Nichols has
been held since two days afler the bomb
ing on charges of making small explo
sives at his Michigan farm.
During the hearing, Asst. U.S. Attor
ney Robert Cares suggested Nichols
may have played a role in the Oklahoma
City bombing along with his brother,
Terry, and suspect Timothy McVeigh,

but he wasn't specific.
"James Nichols himself engaged in
rhetoric of violence," Cares said. "If it
was just rhetoric, we wouldn't be here
today. But he and Terry Nichols and
Timothy McVeigh turned those words
into action. Terry Nichols and McVeigh
are charged with taking the final step."
The prosecutor offered no immediate
evidence for his assertion and Nichols'
lawyer, Robert Elsey, objected to the
statement.
The judge sustained the objection,
agreeing there was no evidence offered
directly linking James Nichols to the
bombing.
Terry Nichols and McVeigh are the
only two suspects charged so far in the
April 19 bombing of the federal building.
