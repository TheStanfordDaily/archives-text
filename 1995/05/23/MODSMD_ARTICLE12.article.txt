# Supreme Court strikes down term limits
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court dealt a devastating blow to backers
of congressional term limits yesterday,
ruling in a contentious 5-4 decision that
states cannot limit service in Congress
without amending the Constitution.
Term-limit advocates reacted with
anger and disgust; one said "you can hear
the sound of champagne corks popping"
among politicians and power brokers in
Washington. Supporters of limits
promised to press ahead, saying voters
will continue to demand an end to
entrenched office holders.
Twenty-two states had taken steps
similar to the Arkansas measure struck
down by the court. The sweeping decision
spells doom for all such state efforts.
The court likewise ruled that Congress
cannot impose term limits for its own
members by merely enacting a statute.
"Any such change must come not by

legislation adopted either by Congress or
by an individual state but rather ...
through the amendment procedures,"
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the
court.
State-imposed term limits for state
political offices are not affected, however.
Passage of a constitutional amend
ment, disfavored by some Republican
leaders, would be difficult. It requires a
two-thirds vote in each chamber and once
enacted by Congress, any proposed
amendment would have to be ratified by
38 states.
Congressional reaction to the court's
ruling could loom large as an issue in the
1996 elections.
"We will bring the term-limits consti
tutional amendment to the Senate floor at
the earliest possible date," said Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., a term-limits sup
porter.

Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-
Kan., made the same pledge.
"Today's ruling suggests a constitu
tional amendment will be needed to make
congressional term limits a reality," he
said. "We will study the ruling carefully,
review all the options and take the course
of action that will give those who support
term limits our best chance for success."
But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said, "I
continue to believe that term limits are an
Intrusion on the people's right to choose
their own representatives and would place
smaller states like Nebraska at a disad
vantage."
A disappointed Paul Jacob of U.S.
Term Limits said. "I have a simple mes
sage to them: Drink up. You're outnum
bered. They're going to wake up tomor
row and find out the American people are
still going to want term limits," Jacob
said.
