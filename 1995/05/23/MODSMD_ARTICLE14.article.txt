## Editorial Reverse ticket policy 
### 
Stanford Events should
not make student groups
sell tickets through them

AS STANFORD continues to
closely examine its use of
non-essential services, one
glaring example remains — and
even continues to try to expand its
influence.
We are talking about, of course,
the Ticket Office in Tresidder
Union. Recently, Stanford admin
istrators have started to talk about
enforcing a policy that would
require that tickets to events held
at a number of University facilities
— like Dinkelspiel Auditorium and
Memorial Church — be sold exclu
sively through the Ticket Office.
Such a policy would only hurt
student groups — which would
have to absorb the distribution
fees charged by the office — while
lining the pockets of Stanford
Events, which runs the office.
Thanks to a quick and
admirable response from student
leaders and group representatives,
the University has started to back
down. Last week, Stanford Events
Director Lois Wagner said that
three groups — ASSU Sunday
Flicks, ASSU Speakers Bureau
and Ram's Head Productions —
had always been exempt from the
policy. However, the rule is still on
the books — and may be applied to
other student groups in the
future.
We find it a bit disturbing that
the groups that received the for
mal exemption are among the
largest and most influential on
campus. Smaller organizations —
like a capella groups — don't have
that kind of clout, and there is a
chance that they could suffer as a
result.
Wagner has promised to look
into the issue of whether other
student groups should be subject
to the policy. Over the summer,
Wagner will create a working
group with student representation

to discuss the problem, she said.
This is a good idea, and at least
shows that the University is not
unwilling to budge on the issue.
However, Stanford Events must
make sure that student interests
are properly represented, especial
ly since the working group will be
meeting over the summer; it
would be nice, for example, to have
someone on the committee from a
smaller student group that could
be hurt by the policy.
The solution to the problem is
clear. Stanford should eliminate
the policy — which has never been
actively enforced anyway — to pro
tect student groups, which operate
on tight budgets, from unfair
charges. The working group, once
formed, should move quickly to do
this so that the situation is clear
by the beginning of the next aca
demic year.
If it isn't given this extra busi
ness, the Ticket Office certainly
isn't going to fold for lack of things
to do. Students and other commu
nity members will still use it to get
concert and sports tickets, as well
as tickets to Stanford Performing
Arts events.
The issue here is whether Stan
ford has the right to squeeze all
the money it can out of student
groups that use University facili
ties. Since the goals of such groups
are to serve the community, not to
make a profit, we don't think
Stanford does.
Over the next few weeks and
months, the Council of Presidents
and group leaders need to stay vig
ilant in this area. And in the
future, Stanford needs to remem
ber that, as a University that
exists above all for students, it
should not consider them just a
resource to be exploited.
With the Ticket Office problem
and the "wacky walk" fiasco, stu
dents this month have faced —
and turned back — two proposed
policy changes that would have
hurt student interests. We hope
that students don't have to con
tinue to be so reactive in the
future.
