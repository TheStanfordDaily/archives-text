Divesting from Texaco is not the most rational ontion

RECENTLY, concerned students at
Stanford have been accusing Texa
co of environmental abuses. Since
Stanford owns approximately 90,000
shares of Texaco stock, they have called
for Stanford to sell its equity stake in
order to force Texaco to change its
industrial ways. Assuming these accusa
tions are true, if Stanford sells its stake
in Texaco, that action might lead to
more environmental destruction, not
less.
Texaco's market value is approxi
mately $17 billion, and thus, Stanford's
$6 million stake is far from a controlling
one. Nevertheless, Stanford is a sizable
shareholder that can put pressure on
Texaco management to change its ways.
If Stanford could raise awareness among

other environmentally-concerned lexaco
investors, Texaco may be forced to adopt
more responsible policies. Stanford can
exert far more influence as a sharehold
er than it can if does not own any por
tion of the company.
If Stanford were to sell its Texaco
shares, that action would have no effect
on the stock price, as the sale would be
based on moral objections, not on any
negative sentiments about Texaco's
future profitability. Another investor,
perhaps one less concerned about Texa
co's environmental record, would simply
buy the shares from Stanford. The net
result would be transaction costs for
Stanford and less pressure on Texaco
management to change its ways.
Of course, if Stanford's selling of the

stock led to a tremendous degree of neg
ative publicity for Texaco (a highly dubi
ous outcome), that could have some
effect on the company. Furthermore, if
Stanford's selling of the stock led to a
chain reaction in which no investor
wished to hold Texaco stock, that would
probably force Texaco to change its envi
ronmental policies. However, this possi
bility is outside the feasible set, as mar
ket forces will ensure that Texaco's
stock price are in line with investor
expectations of the corporation's future
profitability.
While Stanford may be morally
offended by owning part of a company
which it perceives to be environmentally
irresponsible, Stanford is not financing
Texaco's activities. When one purchases

a share of Texaco on the New York
Stock Exchange, one does not supply
Texaco with any new capital; one merely
purchases a claim on Texaco's future
profits from another investor.
Although I was disturbed by the alle
gations about Texaco I read in the
"Daily Planet," I must point out that
Texaco is a solid company, and from a
financial perspective, a great investment
for Stanford. Incidentally, Texaco is also
a great supporter of the arts.
Ultimately, if Stanford wishes to
affect Texaco's environmental policies,
using its voice to exert pressure, not sell
ing its shares, is the most rational
course of action.
