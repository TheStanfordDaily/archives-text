# University has a long record of ecologically sound land management
## 
### 
The assertion in The Daily's May 11
editorial that Stanford has a "seemingly
insatiable appetite for development" flies
squarely in the face of the historical evi
dence. Stanford does, after all, have a
record to evaluate — a long, consistent
record.
Stanford's record of prudent and envi
ronmentally sound land management is
virtually without peer in the entire area.
If one could review, in time-lapse fashion,
aerial photographs of the Peninsula every
10 years since the founding of the Univer
sity, one impression would stand out
above all others: While every other com
munity and landowner has extensively
developed its lands, Stanford has pre
served most of its lands undeveloped.
Only about one-third of Stanford lands
are developed; two-thirds are undeveloped
or limited to low intensity use. Stanford
has dedicated Jasper Ridge as a biological
preserve and demonstrated national lead

ership in respecting the integrity of arche
ological sites, including establishing an
archeological preserve on Stanford West.
Stanford did develop a remarkably suc
cessful research park and an important
regional shopping center in the 19505, but
for the past 30 years the overwhelming
focus of development on Stanford lands
has been for student housing, faculty and
staff housing, and academic or medical
center buildings that are essential to our
academic and service missions. Much of
the development has been redevelopment
— that is, tearing down an obsolete build
ing and building an up-to-date one in its
place. Other development has generally
used in-fill sites; for example, locating the
economics department on a parking lot
near other already developed sites.
For the next few years, Stanford will
continue to see construction on campus to
repair earthquake damage, renovate old
buildings or build new academic buildings
(often to replace old ones). Virtually all of
this work will be done on existing, devel
oped sites or on in-fill sites, and all of it
will be done with acute sensitivity to envi
ronmental concerns.
The proposed development in the Sand

Hill corridor is designed to meet specific
needs, again uses in-fill sites, and has
been carefully designed with special atten
tion to the environment. We believe that
these projects have significant benefits for
Stanford and local communities and that
they will receive approval after public
hearings.
Stanford's historical record of steward
ship of its lands ought to provide comfort
to those concerned about responsible land
management. And, of course, no develop
ment can be done on Stanford lands
unless there has been extensive review by
one or more political bodies and specific
approval.
