# Ehrlich and Schneider wish to set own rules
## 
### 
The response of Biology Profs. Paul
Ehrlich and Stephen Schneider to Uni
versity of Maryland Business Prof.
Julian Simon's optimistic view of the

future of human life on our planet (May
19) was both interesting and revealing.
Prof. Ehrlich, having lost a highly-pub
licized previous wager to Prof. Simon
concerning the economic consequences
of his (Ehrlich's) Malthusian predic
tions, now re-challenges his tormentor.
But this time, determined to win, he
wants to choose the intellectual venue
and define the terms of the encounter.
Is this to be viewed as an instructive
precedent? If so, why should Ehrlich
and Schneider be the only ones to
exploit this strategy? The principle,
after all, is clear: when you lose, make
your own rules. It could be applied to
Stanford athletic teams, to research sci
entists whose funding is allocated else
where, to frustrated Nobel laureate
wannabes, etc.
As for Prof. Ehrlich's and Prof.
Schneider's students, my advice is to
take them at their word: If you miss any
questions on upcoming finals, just tell
them you want a new exam, one for
which you will write the questions.
Good luck.
