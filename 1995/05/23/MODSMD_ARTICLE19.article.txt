## Electricity through sweat 
### 
I GO TO the gym three times a week.
Yeah, I even do the Stairmaster. I
admit it. And every time I go, I am
overwhelmed by the fact that so much
energy is being exerted in the gym. It's
kind of a Sisyphian struggle: We just
roll one ball up the hill (in sets of 10 to
12 reps) in order to be able to roll big
ger balls up the hill at a faster rate, or
perhaps just to look better while doing
things other than rolling the ball up
the hill. Point being, it seems so futile
at times. And even more disconcerting
is that fact that the gym requires so
much energy to maintain. The lights,
the machines, the ventilation, the
whole deal.
So, the absurdity of the gym takes
on a new dimension of complexity. Not
only are people repeatedly lifting and
lowering weights or cycling in place or
climbing imaginary flights of stairs in
order to expend calories at a higher
rate than usual, but a great deal of
energy is also expended in order to
enable us to expend energy in comfort.
You get the point.
Clearly, there must be a way to
channel all of our human energy into
something more useful than grunting
and gasping for breath. And of course,
to be more environmentally conscious
by not using up non-renewable sources
of energy such as fossil fuels. Ideally,
the gym could be a self-sufficient enti
ty, completely fueled and supported by
the sweat and labor of its clients. How

ever, if we don't generate enough ener
gy to run the gym, more traditional
forms of power could be used to make
up the difference.
Of course, as a history major who
really has very little knowledge of the
technical aspects or potential difficulty
in transforming one type of energy
into another, I decided that I couldn't
publicly write about this grand plan of
mine until I checked out its feasibility
with those who are perhaps more
knowledgeable. I therefore turned to
my electrical and mechanical engineer
ing friends and asked them if this
whole gym thing could work. If, in
reality, the Stairmasters would not
need to be plugged in, the Lifecycles
could power the lights, and the nau
tilus machines could generate power
for air conditioning.
I entered this dialogue rather wari
ly, not wanting to sound stupid for
bringing up such a question over din
ner. This conversation was no longer
on the well-trodden path of pop psy
chology or Republican-bashing, it was
something new for me. It was the type
of conversation I usually walk away
from. Nevertheless, after a few min
utes of discussion, they turned to me
and nodded. "Sure," they said, "Why
not?"
So, with the okay of my technical
peers, I present this plan to the public.
Personally, I feel like it would be much
more fulfilling if at the end of my

Stairmaster time I could read "One
hour of light," or "Eight hours of
radio" instead of "Average watts: 130."
It would be an indication that I was
not only improving my physical fit
ness, but that my 30 minutes of climb
ing up that invisible skyscraper had
accomplished something greater.
So perhaps this new system of pro
viding energy will actually encourage
more people to come to the gym. For
those people who refuse to go to the
gym on the grounds that "It doesn't
feel like I'm really doing anything,"
this is the perfect solution.
Of course, we must consider the ini
tial costs in redesigning the present
supply of power to one that is internal.
It turns out that all it would take is a
generator. Regardless, as a university
dedicated to a generally progressive
attitude, I think the ecological bene
fits, minor financial savings, improve
ment in the overall mental satisfaction
of gym users and the bragging rights of
being ahead of the times would far out
weigh any financial investment neces
sary at the beginning of this project.
Now all we need is to convince peo
ple to stop driving to the gym.
