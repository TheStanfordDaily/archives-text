# Free tickets and all...
## Sparse crowd at junior semi-formal 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Students who attended the
"Step Into the Spotlight" junior
semi-formal dance this weekend
got a bargain.
Without paying a dime, they at
tended a dance at the Faculty Club
that cost roughly $31 per person.
The ASSU, which sponsored
the event, originally planned to
charge students an $8 entrance
fee. By Thursday night, no stu
dents had bought tickets — so the
passes were given away free in
order to boost attendance, said
Andre Javier, one of next year's se
nior class presidents.

Elvira Prieto said that because the
ASSU had already reserved the
Faculty Club and ordered food, the
dance was made free "so it didn't
go to waste." Despite the free tick
ets, only 75 students attended the
semi-formal, she said. The total
number of junior class members is
about 1,500.
Sarah Cranston, senior class
president-elect, pointed to plan
ning problems for the failed event.
"I feel it was planned too late," she
said.
Cranston distanced the senior
class presidents-elect from the
dance — saying that they played
only a small role in the organiza
tion of the sparsely attended event
by helping advertise and sell tick

ets.
"Our role was just to help out,
not figure out the logistics," Javier
said.
The event was handled by the
ASSU Class Events Committee,
which was formed winter quarter
when the ASSU Student Affairs
Committee passed a bill to pro
mote class unity by holding sopho
more and junior semi-formal
dances, Prieto said.
By passing the bill, the ASSU
wanted to establish new tradi
tions, Prieto said. This was the
first ever junior semi-formal
dance.
