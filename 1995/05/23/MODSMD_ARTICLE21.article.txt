## Trade and the environment There is no such thing as free trade 
### Greg Barnes 
TO UNDERSTAND the effects
of "free" trade on the envi
ronment, both human and
natural, you first need to see what's
up with the present world economic
system. If the word "economics"
turns you off, chill — this is pretty
easy.
Until recently, large corpora
tions have used governments for
subsidies and tariffs against their
competitors. Now, however, corpo
rations have grown so large that
each one has assets in many coun
tries, and they have turned to trying
to get governments to provide even
more subsidies while concentrating
on keeping down global costs (such
as labor costs, cleaning up toxic
wastes, protecting natural
resources, etc.). However, they fig
ured out a way to bypass the slow
and costly process of buying public
opinion and governments: the
newly revamped World Trade Orga
nization (WTO) of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT). Remember those
acronyms — you will be hearing a
lot more about the WTO in the
future!
The WTO is basically a world
economic governing body, which
has completely secret decision-mak
ing processes which are open only to
institutions with massive financial
resources. GATT, which the presi
dent signed into law last year, basi
cally says that the laws of the Unit
ed States are null and void if the
WTO says they interfere with
"free" trade ("free" equals "subsi
dized for the big boys"). The WTO
provides a legal mechanism by
which U.S.-based multinational
corporations can control U.S. laws
regardless of what the people,
Congress, the president or the Con
stitution says.
Yep, no kidding — our govern
ment has signed into law an inter
national treaty that specifically has
the power to nullify American laws.

Greg Barnes is a Ph.D. candidate
in biological sciences.

Of course, corporations aren't going
to use all the powers of the WTO
right away — it will be used gradu
ally to turn the entire world into an
economy more profitable for the
subsidized megacorporations — i.e.
lower wages, lower environmental
standards, no recourse for people
who want to influence corporations
or governments.
By now your "free market"
training should be kicking in —
"but if they lower wages, then con
sumption will decrease, and they

'"Free" equals
"subsidized for
the big boys'"

will go out of business." No prob —
consumption will increase massive
ly for a tiny minority in the indus
trialized countries (including lots
and lots of Stanford grads!). And
there is an increasingly important
factor that you won't read about in
the textbooks. Namely, megacorpo
rations compete for various taxpay
er subsidies (what's really behind
the Democrats vs. the Republicans).

Some examples of taxpayer sub
sidies we should all be familiar with:
foreign aid (earmarked for the pur
chase of particular U.S. goods),
defense (subsidies to high-tech, oil,
automotive industries), highways
(construction, automotive indus
tries), science (high tech, medical
industries), logging (we pay for
making logging roads), bailouts (can
you say S&L?). The list is nearly
endless. If you look at the industries
that have done well in the U.S. or
any other industrialized country,
the truth is obvious: subsidies are
required for industry success. Yep,
that's right — the free market is a
myth. The corporations tell us to
"obey the free market" while they
take our tax money as subsidies.
With the WTO, they have even
more control over labor and envi
ronmental "costs."
Some examples of what the
WTO will likely attack during the
next decade include the Marine
Mammal Protection Act (a GATT
ruling on a case brought by Mexico
in 1991 nullifying the core of the act
was delayed to ensure lack of pub
licity); the Delaney Clause of the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,
which says no cancer-causing chem
icals can be present in food; and the

Clean Air Act and the Clean Water
Act. Labor protection laws, environ
mental protection laws and con
sumer protection laws will be
steadily eroded.
In the future, if a foreign corpo
ration wants to build a big geother
mal plant in the middle of Yellow
stone, the WTO will, without any
mechanisms of public participation,
nullify the Wilderness Act and
National Parks designation, and
permit immediate development. If
the American public rose in outrage
and the Congress and president
refused to allow the development,
the U.S. would be hit with massive
monetary damages, sanctions and
trade retaliation.
As time passes and the world
economy expands to the far corners
of the earth, devouring the environ
ment and using/abusing the peo
ple, the U.S. becomes more vulnera
ble to WTO influence. Already we're
tied strongly to the global economy.
In a few decades, the U.S. govern
ment will likely be reduced to the
roles of a present third-world gov
ernment: enforcer of incredible
social inequity and near-slave labor
and global competitor in how fast it
can supply megacorpo rations with
natural resources.
