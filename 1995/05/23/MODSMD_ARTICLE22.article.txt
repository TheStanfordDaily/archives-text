# A 						new economic paradigm is necessary
## 
### Greg Wright 
WE LIVE IN a world that
has an obsession with
economic growth. Our
current economic paradigm
defines economic success as
growth and progress at any cost.
Those costs that are so easily
overlooked in the name of prof
its often include human rights
and the environment. As multi
national corporations, such as
Texaco, continue to rape the
environment across the globe, a
few have begun to ask, "How
long can this last?" The planet
Earth that has been so readily
exploited in the name of
progress is showing signs that it
is not infinite as a resource. It is
our economic paradigm that
fuels the massive environmental
degradation vehicle that scours
our Earth at the present time.

'The current
economic paradigm
must be derailed'

Many economists argue that
free trade is the answer in giving
the economic factor a force in
doing good for the environment.
This begs the question: What
would be good about continuing
the process of growth that has
been so damaging to the envi
ronment in the past? The
answer can be found in analyz
ing the manner in which the
tools of economics can used and
implemented.
NAFTA represents this
struggle to incorporate environ
mentally sound implementa
tions into economics. NAFTA
has a side agreement called the
North American Agreement on
Environmental Cooperation
(NAAEC). President Clinton,
when he was running for office,
conceded to the pressure of envi
ronmental groups and unions
and stated he would only sup
port NAFTA with side agree
ments on environmental and
labor laws. The NAAEC is
unprecedented in its attempts to
integrate trade and environmen-

tal policy. It is written with a
clear emphasis on protecting the
environment, yet it still has not
progressed to fully integrate
trade and environmental con
cerns.
NAFTA is still just a free
trade agreement, and the inter
ests of multinational corpora
tions can be represented in the
document. Even with the
NAAEC, NAFTA is prone to the
economic pressures of multi
national corporations who have
been some of the greatest con
tributors to environmental
degradation in the past. The
NAAEC has loopholes that will
allow prioritization of enforce
ment of environmental laws
that could represent the inter
ests of rich contributors of the
politicians. A country under
NAFTA has the power to priori
tize which environmental laws
will be enforced if resources are
limited. Mexico is a prime exam
ple of a country that does not
have the resources to enforce all
their environmental laws.
As Mexico is deciding which
environmental laws to enforce,
multinational corporations will
be able to influence these deci
sions with large contributions to
political campaigns. The docu
ment also protects national
sovereignty a great deal. The
commission ends up being more
of a discussion group and an
advice committee, rather than a
supranational environmental
entity capable of bringing about
real change. The process of
enforcing policies in the NAAEC
is also open to influence of
multinational corporations. The
council in the commission has to
vote to release any of the infor
mation to the public. With a
potentially closed system of
deliberation in whrch the public
can be denied information, the
influences of large campaign
donations can be more easily
expressed. These problems are
not surprising considering that
this is a free trade agreement
and not an environmental pro
tection agreement. The real
crime here is that there is no
comprehensive environmental
agreement on an international
level.
The complete integration of
trade and environmental policy
is the logical progression to
ensure that economic ideologies
are not the fuel of massive envi
ronmental degradation. The
efforts of policymakers in

adding environmental side bars
is not enough. A comprehensive
environmental agreement is
needed more than a trade agree
ment or an environmental-trade
agreement, because a change of
focus is required if the degrada
tion of the environment is to be
stopped. The momentum is cur
rently in the direction of eco
nomic growth, not in ecological
preservation. A strong environ
mental agreement is needed to
reset the momentum and pace of
growth on a sustainable level.
The current economic
paradigm must be derailed and
a redefinition of development
must be created. Only a country
that is growing sustainably and
working within the limits of its

environment is truly developed.
Under this definition, many
first-world countries are far
ther from being developed than
some third-world nations.
Every nation is in the same
trouble on a global level, and
each nation has environmental
problems to contend with. The
U.S. must reduce its affluent
consumeristic nature, China
must control its population,
and other developing nations
need to focus on sustainable
growth working with the envi
ronment. An international com
mitment to a new economic
paradigm is the only way to
combat the massive scale at
which environmental degrada
tion is currently proceeding.
