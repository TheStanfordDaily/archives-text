# Open trade or the environmental nanny
## 
### Thomas G. Moore 
Environmental groups,,
human rights activists and
spokesmen for labor rights
have been urging increasingly that
trade policy include sanctions for
nations not meeting the United
States' standards in these fields.
The recently-completed North
American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), for example, contains
side agreements, one of which spec
ifies that all parties must not only
ensure that their "laws and regula
tions provide for high levels of envi
ronmental protection" but shall
strive to improve their own environ
mental legislation. As approved by
Congress, the agreement sets up a
tri-national group of government
officials — the Commission on
Environmental Cooperation — to
monitor environmental protection.
A public advisory commission made
up of representatives from private
environmental groups — such as
the Sierra Club, Friends of the
Earth and the Wilderness Society
— can bring complaints to the com
mission.
Although this side agreement
was ostensibly aimed at forcing
Mexico to strengthen its environ
mental laws, the first action may be
against the U.S. The rescission bill
currently before Congress narrows
the scope of U.S. environmental
laws, such as the Endangered
Species Act, the National Forest
Management Act and the Clean
Water Act. Under the proposed leg
islation, the Forest Service must,
regardless of other environmental
laws, license lumber companies to
harvest dead and dying trees in
national forests.
Drought and insect infestation
have littered the forests of Oregon,
Washington, Idaho and California
with dead and diseased trees har
boring pests and fungi that can
spread to nearby healthy vegeta
tion. The fallen timber, moreover,
poses a major fire hazard. Never
theless, extremist environmental
groups have been fighting all efforts
to harvest dead trees and are
threatening to file a complaint
under NAfTA "seeking an investi
gation of the U.S.'s failure to
enforce its environmental law." It is
bizarre that this trade agreement
should be used to prevent the duly
elected Congress from amending
past statutes.
More fundamental to the contro
versy is the principle that trade laws
should be confined to trade matters;
environmental considerations as
well as human rights — President
Clinton decided last year that trade
with China should not be influ
enced by its human rights record —
should be addressed more directly.
Trade is desirable because it bene
fits both parties. If the U.S. imports
goods from Mexico, it does so

Thomas G. Moore is a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution.

because consumers find the combi
nation of price and quality more to
their liking than domestic substi
tutes. Mexicans also benefit by
earning dollars that they can use to
purchase goods and services from
Americans.
If the government prohibits
importers from selling Mexican
goods in America, our retailers, our
distributors and our consumers will
all lose. Whenever the government
bars or restricts imports, Ameri
cans suffer. In most cases the losers
are low income buyers who would
have found the cheap foreign prod
ucts a better deal than the domestic
varieties.
Whenever trade is made condi
tional on such contingencies as
environmental enforcement,
human rights or labor protection,
no matter how well intentioned the
motive, protectionist forces will
employ these provisions to shelter
their businesses. Our fishermen,
for example, have succeeded in

'Whenever the
government bars or
restricts imports,
Americans suffer'

blocking the import of tuna from a
number of countries, including
Mexico, allegedly because these
countries fail to adequately protect
dolphins — which are not even an
endangered species.
Rich countries can afford to pro
tect their environment and largely
do so. The U.S. currently spends
hundreds of billions of dollars to
maintain a healthy and beautiful
habitat. When this country was less
wealthy our citizens were less con
cerned about their surroundings.
Poor countries find it patroniz
ing, presumptuous and impertinent
to be lectured by the rich on air or
water pollution. Although the popu
lace in these countries undoubtedly
prefer a clean environment, their
primary need is for a sewage system
and clean drinking water. The
niceties of the spotted owl, wetlands
and dolphins are less compelling to
people without electricity or run
ning water. They are willing to
accept a little smog for a good job
that can bring security to their fam
ilies.
The U.S. has no license to dictate
standards for the rest of the globe.
We should respect the rights of oth
ers to make environmental trade
offs in order to secure the benefits
of higher incomes. These higher
incomes will eventually create local
demands for a better environment.
Tying trade to environmental laws
will not only hurt our consumers
but will slow the advance of those
countries, delaying the time when
their public will support stronger
environmental protection. Trade is
too important to let the environ
mentalists strangle growth through
ostensibly high-minded regulation.
