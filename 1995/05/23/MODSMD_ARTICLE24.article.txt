# Integrate environmental standards with free trade
## 
### Justin Pollard 
THE DEBATE OVER free trade and the
environment has created a significant
rift within the environmental move
ment. The North American Free Trade Agree
ment (NAFTA), for example, was supported by
the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural
Resources Defense Council and the World
Wildlife Fund; it was vocally opposed by the
Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and Green
peace. The disagreement among leading non
governmental organizations was representa
tive of the lack of resolve on the issue among
their members and the public. Today the con
troversy rages as strongly as ever over the
effects of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
— the successor to the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT) — and future trade
agreements.
Critics of free trade claim it will increase
rates of natural resource depletion and lead to
the weakening of states' domestic environmen
tal laws. They argue that rapid industrial
growth in Mexico resulting from NAFTA will
expedite conversion of wilderness to other uses,
increase exports of petroleum and other raw
materials and produce vast amounts of toxic
waste. They point to the Mexican Tuna-Dol
phin case — in which Mexico successfully chal
lenged the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act
as a barrier to free trade under the GATT — as
a harbinger of the imminent assault on U.S.
environmental laws.
These are serious and legitimate com
plaints. The appropriate solution, however, is
not to throw free trade out with the proverbial
bath water; the concerns can be addressed
while maintaining the benefits of free trade. In

fact, free trade can and should become one of
the most powerful weapons in environmental
ists' arsenals.
First, environmentalists must recognize the
economic logic behind free trade. If countries
specialize in those industries in which they
have a comparative advantage — that is, those
in which they are most competitive in relative
terms — then resources will be allocated most
efficiently and the whole world will be better
off. This holds true even for those who don't
think the world needs more consumer goods;
more efficiency and growth can produce
resources for reducing environmental destruc
tion and restoring ecosystems. Growth is also
necessary to combat poverty, which has been
called the greatest enemy of the environment,
and raise living standards so people demand
better environmental protection.
But without fair rules for trade and appro
priate environmental protection, expansion of
the world economy can be very detrimental to
the Earth, which brings up the most compelling
argument for free trade — that it allows for
upward harmonization of the environmental
standards of different countries. This is exactly
what the language of the environmental side
agreement to NAFTA calls for — that the U.S.,
Canada and Mexico eventually bring their envi
ronmental legislation to a level playing field,
and then proceed to improve upon it from there.
The WTO, similarly, could become an
important ally of the environmental movement
by incorporating environmental standards into
rules for free trade. To do so would make per
fect sense: If the U.S. wants to correct a market
failure by incorporating the costs of carbon
emissions into the price of oil, for example, our
industries would not be able to compete in the
global marketplace against those from coun
tries which had not adopted similar policies.
In fact, without comprehensive internation
al agreements on environmental policies the
result is a "race to the bottom" for environ

mental standards, each country trying to gain
an unfair advantage in world markets by sacri
ficing the environment for low production
costs. The advantage of the WTO is that,
unlike the United Nations, it would be able to
effectively enforce compliance with environ
mental regulations by penalizing offenders
with trade sanctions and tariffs. Entire ranges
of environmental standards could be incorpo
rated into the WTO, from accounting for deple
tion of natural resources to clean air and water
regulations to the protection of biological diver
sity. If the environmental legislation of the
United States, Europe and Japan is attacked in
the WTO, it is the responsibility of citizens in
those countries to respond by insisting on
bringing the environmental standards of lesser
developed countries (LDCs) up to par with our
own laws rather than allowing our laws to fall
to their levels, and then continue to stiffen
global environmental legislation.
Powerful interest groups in LDCs and the
industrialized world which benefit from
extracting natural resources and polluting the
earth would vocally oppose such measures,
calling them paternalistic at best, excessively
interventionist, and worse. But it is ridiculous
to say that it is wrong to steer the LDCs toward
a future which is actually the best one for them
and the rest of the world. Harmonizing envi
ronmental standards through the WTO would
in fact alleviate the pressure on LDCs to lower
their environmental standards and compete
unsustainably.
Policymakers and the public who would find
such measures too drastic are failing to appre
ciate the absolute urgency of the environmen
tal crisis. We do not have the time or resources
for LDCs to follow in our coal-burning, forest
clearing footsteps, and appreciate the signifi
cance of protecting the global environment 30
years from now. Incorporating environmental
standards into the WTO would be a major step
toward building a sustainable future.
