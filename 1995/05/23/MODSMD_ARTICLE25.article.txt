## Crews win second, fourth in Pac-10 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
; The season isn't over yet.
; After six years of closing shop
•after the Pacific 10 Conference
.Championships, the women's
icrew team overtook Washington
State last Saturday to earn a
berth in the national champi
onships in three weeks.

Although three men's squad
from the Pac-10 advance to
nationals (as opposed to two for
the women), the men came up
short of an automatic bid by
falling to Oregon State in Sun
day's finals. However, the Cardi
nal may still sneak into nationals
despite the disappointing fourth
place finish with help from else
where.

The combined efforts of both
squads earned Stanford second
place in the overall points race
with 28, a whopping 13 points
behind powerhouse Washington,
which won five of the six events.
With no squad seeded better than
third, Stanford's strong overall
showing left outsiders shaking
their heads but Cardinal coaches
nodding in approval.

"It went as well as we had
hoped it would go," said women's
coach Jocelyn McCandless. "This
is a significant feather in their
cap. They rose to the occasion and
got the job done in difficult condi
tions."
The usually strong headwinds
both days challenged the women,
a squad that prefers tailwinds.
Nonetheless, the women's boats
all finished at least as well as
expected. The novice eights land
ed in third place with a time of 7
minutes, 19.41 seconds. That
mark turned out to be Sunday's
finest, but based on the results of
Saturday's heats and semifinals,
the squad was racing for third
place against Oregon State.
The JV squad also bested Ore
gon State by 13 seconds, rowing
the course in 7:41.70, while the
varsity came up eight seconds
short vs. the mighty Huskies
despite a time of 7:09.73. Howev
er, the varsity's key race came
Saturday afternoon, when the
eight avenged a close loss to
Washington State in Pullman last
month.

that we had gone up their and
came so close on their turf," said
senior captain Sue Becker. "Our
game plan was to just go for it in
the first 1,000 [meters]. We had
open water by 1,000 and went on
to win by about a full boat
length."

The men's strategy to go all
out produced different results.
Their early-season struggles
resulted in a four seed and,
despite what coach Wieslaw Kujda
called their "best race in this sea
son" in the morning heat, a semi
final matchup with the Huskies.
Rather than conserve energy and
prepare for the all-important
third-place race on Sunday, coach
Wieslaw Kujda and the squad
opted to go for Washington.

"We were here to win and not
to just basically play the chick
en," Kujda said. "We did a very
good job, and we were closest to
them."
The men came up 10 seconds
short, however, and didn't have
enough left for Sunday's contest
with Oregon State. The varsity's
6:22.45 showing was 12 seconds
shy of the Beavers, who earned
the Pac-10's final berth to
nationals.

"I was a little disappointed,"
Kujda said. "I think we're the
fastest crew [of the two]. It's
hard in such a tournament to
have good races every time."
The JV eights posted the low
est showing of the day, taking
fifth but destroying the Cougars
in the final by over 29 seconds.
The novices had the best final
time overall at 6:21.89 and
topped Oregon State by 9.50 sec
onds.
