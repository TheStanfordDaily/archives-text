•after the Pacific 10 Conference
.Championships, the women's
icrew team overtook Washington
State last Saturday to earn a
berth in the national champi
onships in three weeks.

Although three men's squad
from the Pac-10 advance to
nationals (as opposed to two for
the women), the men came up
short of an automatic bid by
falling to Oregon State in Sun
day's finals. However, the Cardi
nal may still sneak into nationals
despite the disappointing fourth
place finish with help from else
where.

The combined efforts of both
squads earned Stanford second
place in the overall points race
with 28, a whopping 13 points
behind powerhouse Washington,
which won five of the six events.
With no squad seeded better than
third, Stanford's strong overall
showing left outsiders shaking
their heads but Cardinal coaches
nodding in approval.

"It went as well as we had
hoped it would go," said women's
coach Jocelyn McCandless. "This
is a significant feather in their
cap. They rose to the occasion and
got the job done in difficult condi
tions."
The usually strong headwinds
both days challenged the women,
a squad that prefers tailwinds.
Nonetheless, the women's boats
all finished at least as well as
expected. The novice eights land
ed in third place with a time of 7
minutes, 19.41 seconds. That
mark turned out to be Sunday's
finest, but based on the results of
Saturday's heats and semifinals,
the squad was racing for third
place against Oregon State.
The JV squad also bested Ore
gon State by 13 seconds, rowing
the course in 7:41.70, while the
varsity came up eight seconds
short vs. the mighty Huskies
despite a time of 7:09.73. Howev
er, the varsity's key race came
Saturday afternoon, when the
eight avenged a close loss to
Washington State in Pullman last
month.
"It was definitely key knowing
