# The 						Iceman cometh as the Thinker
## Slowly and surely, Jim Thomas racks up wins — and nicknames 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
The 1995 Stanford men's ten
nis team will be remembered as
one of the greatest groups of colle
gians ever assembled. The Cardi
nal amassed a perfect 27-0 record
on its way to winning the NCAA
Team Championship last week in
Athens, Ga. It was only the sec
ond time since the current team
tournament format was institut
ed 21 years ago that a team ended
the season undefeated — a feat
first accomplished by John McEn
roe and the 1978 Cardinal.
When people look back upon
the dream season, they will find
many moments that could have
turned 1995 into just a normal
season for Cardinal — perhaps a
season in which the team could
have lost a match or two, or even
could have failed to win the
national championship. A point
played differently, a game where a
player couldn't hold a serve, or a
match where a player couldn't
quite come back to win the third
set. The Cardinal indeed played
some close matches in 1995, and a
point here or there could have
made all the difference in some of
those matches.
On a cloudy day in Los Angeles
last April 7, 10 of those points
were played — and they were all
played in the same match. With
six matches played against UCLA
and the score deadlocked at 3-3,
Cardinal junior Jim Thomas
engaged in a memorable No. 4
singles battle with Bruin fresh
man Matt Breen. Stanford's
undefeated record was on the line
and everybody in attendance
knew it. The crowd witnessed 10
thrilling match points — five for
each player — before Thomas
finally pulled out a stunning 4-6,
7-5, 7-6 (12-10) victory to give
Stanford the team victory.

Thomas' last-minute heroics
against UCLA reminded Stanford
head coach Dick Gould of a simi
lar effort during the other dream
campaign 17 years ago.
"It was very much like the '78
season, seeing how Jimmy kept
our record intact. That year
against UCLA, we were trailing 3-
2 and it looked like UCLA was
going to put it away by making it
4-2. McEnroe was still on the
court against Elliot Teltscher.
John had match point against
him in the second set. They
played a long point — about 15
shots. It was a great point — one
of the best I've ever seen.
"Both players were up and
down during that point. Finally,
Teltscher had McEnroe on the
run. McEnroe was running full
blast across the court when he
somehow got his racquet on the
ball, and passed Teltscher, who
was standing at the net. The pass
ing shot just totally dumbfounded
Teltscher and everybody could see
it by the way he looked after the
shot. He was half the player from
that point on. Teltscher wilted
after that. It took a superhuman
effort by one guy to save that
match for us, and that is the same
thing Jimmy did against UCLA.
It takes a match like that to get
through a season undefeated. It
takes a great effort with your
backs against the wall."
But for Thomas, who finished
the 1995 regular season ranked
No. 65 nationally, it was all in a
day's work.
"It certainly wasn't just me,"
Thomas said. "We were down 3-1.
Three other guys had to win to
make my match important. I was
just doing my part, beating some
one who I thought I should beat,
who happened to be playing very
well that day. It was just nice to

compete in a match that turned
out so well for me and the other
guys.
"It was a pleasure playing
throughout the year with my
teammates. I had tremendous
confidence in their abilities. At
different times in the year, every
body pulled out big matches."
And yet Thomas' match was
one of the biggest. It was also the
second time in as many years that
he had clinched a victory in a
third-set tie-break; at the 1994
National Team Indoor Champi
onships he defeated Stefan Plot of
Mississippi State, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6
(10-8) after going down 1-4 in the
tie-breaker and fighting off a
match point. So it was not sur
prising when, after his win
against UCLA, some teammates
began calling Thomas "The Ice
man."
"Jim Thomas has such ice in
his veins it's unbelievable," said
teammate and doubles partner
Ricky Becker. "All of the matches
that he lost this year were after
the (team victory 1 was clinched,
and there is little doubt in my
mind that if the match was an
important match he would've
pulled it out."
Thomas only lost four out of 22
dual matches this year after
amassing a 22-1 record for the
1994 Cardinal. As Becker alluded

to, however, many of Thomas'
decisions came after Stanford had
already clinched the team victory
by winning the required four out
of seven points.
"I'm often one of the last peo
ple off the court, so it's not very
often that my match is important.
It's exciting when it is impor
tant," Thomas said.
The reason why Thomas'
matches often last so long is his
deliberate style of play. The 6-
foot-4 native of Canton, Ohio, is
known around the Pacific 10 Con
ference for taking his time
between points and drawing out
the length of the match, often to
the stage where the outcome
becomes moot because his team
mates have already clinched. But
alas there is method to his mad
ness.
"The first thing I do is look at
the balls to make sure I am serv
ing with the one that has been
used the least," Thomas
explained. "I pick out two of the
best three. If I'm on a roll I don't
have to look at all three.
"But that's only getting the
balls. Now I have the balls and I
can walk up to the line. I'm in the
habit of bouncing it a couple of
times. Ideally you want to try and
visualize where you're going to
serve and how your opponent is
going to return and what you're
going to do with the next shot."
Thomas likes the fact that his
routine lends consistency to his
game. Whether it's the first or the
last point of the match, Thomas
knows what he is going to do, and

that is play the point without
mental errors.
"I don't like to give away
points. Apparently this is the pace
that best suits me because if I
play faster I'm not as sure that
I'm ready to play the point. I've
found this is the best way for me
to win matches. When it gets tight
I don't need to change anything.
A lot of people change their ritu
als when it gets tight but since
mine are so ingrained there's lit
tle change if any."
Gould likes Thomas' deliberate
style of play because of the results
it gets. In this regard, Gould even
compares Thomas to a more
famous tennis-playing Jimmy —
the one who played for UCLA in
the early 1970s before dueling
with McEnroe for more than one
Grand Slam title.
"Connors used to bounce the
ball 20 times too during big
points. One of the reasons Jimmy
[Thomas] gets as much out of his
game as any player I've ever
coached is he is always ready to
play the point. He is very tough
mentally that way. His focus is
very good. He rarely gets upset on
the court or loses concentration
or gets ahead of himself.
A lot of guys are very flashy
but they'll also give you a lot of
points brainlessly. When Jim
does that it's not because he's
playing brain-dead tennis. He will
not beat himself."
Thomas' penchant for using
his noggin is apparently so evi
dent that upon meeting the team
on an airplane last year, a woman

took one look at the usually stoic
Thomas and remarked, "He looks
like the Thinker of the bunch." A
new nickname was born, and
Thomas continued to exhibit
superior thought processes on the
court.
"Obviously it helps if you can
keep your head in a tight situa
tion, and keep your head about
you all the time," Gould said. "All
of those things will help you in
crunch time against tough play
ers. I don't think many players
look forward to playing .Jim when
they see his name in the draw.
You have to go out and beat him
and it's hard to beat him."
Thomas' opponents also fear
him because his long preparation
to play the point sometimes
throws off their game even before
they have an opportunity to
return his booming serve.
"Both times that I played him I
found it very tough for my
rhythm," said California's Bobby
Mahal. "You would win two or
three points against his serve and
then he would slow it down. So
it's hard to get something going.
He's very lethargic and it slows
you down, too, and keeps you out
of mode. He even got penalized for
taking too much time between
serves when I played him down in
San Jose (at the Sybase Open
qualifying tournament)."
Gould explained: "Each player
is different. A guy who is hyper
likes to play faster. It is more
Jim's nature to play like he does
— he is not a hyper guy. If you are
a hyper guy and are playing

against a guy who is methodical,
it's going bother you."
Thomas' teammates appreci
ate his character traits for more
than one reason.
"Jim is quiet in general but not
with me," Becker said. "Some
times we disagree on strategy, but
playing with Jim is good because
you basically know he is going to
hold serve every time. His inner
intensity fires me up as much as a
person with a rah-rah attitude.
Sometimes he can calm me down
when I'm too excited.
"He is the one mellow guy on
the team. Jimmy is the epitome of
leading by example. He works
really hard, has a no |R.S.I atti
tude and it rubs off on the team in
a positive way. In a team meeting
he might prefer not to say some
thing and just let his actions
speak for him."
Thomas' actions on the court
are indeed reflections of his atti
tude off the court; he plays a no
nonsense serve and volley game
without flair but with the grace
that goes hand in hand with coor
dination.
"Jim basically does things
meticulously and I think it shows
in his tennis game. He is a well
coordinated athlete who is not a
tremendously quick athlete with
either his hands or his feet. That
dictates a little the style of play he
must use. He has to compensate
for the lack of hand and foot
speed. He is a big guy so he has a
lot of strength and he uses that to
help him. He can play straight
ahead tennis."

Thomas won one match at the
NCAA Championships — a sec
ond-set tie-break victory in the
quarterfinals against Mississippi
State — while his other three
matches were, you guessed it, sus
pended because the match was
already clinched. But if next
year's NCAAs are any closer than
they were this year, you can rest
assured that Thomas will be one
of the last matches left on the
court — a scenario Thomas will
relish.
"Those are the kinds of situa
tions you dream of, and you cer
tainly dream of winning,"
Thomas said after his victory
against Breen.
Thomas will be hard at work
on his game this summer as Stan
ford gears up for another run at
the NCAA crown.
"No one works harder than
Jim. His work ethic has improved
tremendously and he'll be a better
player next year than he was this
year," Gould saaid.
And as for Thomas, his com
ments confirm he is not content
to rest on his laurels.
"No one really thought about
the undefeated season earlier in
the year. You certainly don't
think about it when you're play
ing the matches. For me the high
light was winning the NCAA team
tournament in Athens. It was
what I had been working towards
for three years. We're going to
enjoy this one for a while but pret
ty soon we have to get back to
work in preparation for repeating
next vear."

nis team will be remembered as
one of the greatest groups of colle
gians ever assembled. The Cardi
nal amassed a perfect 27-0 record
on its way to winning the NCAA

ing with the one that has been
used the least," Thomas
explained. "I pick out two of the
best three. If I'm on a roll I don't
have to look at all three.
"But that's only getting the
balls. Now I have the balls and I
can walk up to the line. I'm in the
habit of bouncing it a couple of
times. Ideally you want to try and
visualize where you're going to
serve and how your opponent is
going to return and what you're
going to do with the next shot."
Thomas likes the fact that his
routine lends consistency to his
game. Whether it's the first or the
last point of the match, Thomas
knows what he is going to do, and

that is play the point without
mental errors.
"I don't like to give away
points. Apparently this is the pace
that best suits me because if I
play faster I'm not as sure that
I'm ready to play the point. I've
found this is the best way for me
to win matches. When it gets tight
I don't need to change anything.
A lot of people change their ritu
als when it gets tight but since
mine are so ingrained there's lit
tle change if any."
Gould likes Thomas' deliberate
style of play because of the results
it gets. In this regard, Gould even
compares Thomas to a more
famous tennis-playing Jimmy —
the one who played for UCLA in
the early 1970s before dueling
with McEnroe for more than one
Grand Slam title.
"Connors used to bounce the
ball 20 times too during big
points. One of the reasons Jimmy
[Thomas] gets as much out of his
game as any player I've ever
coached is he is always ready to
play the point. He is very tough
mentally that way. His focus is
very good. He rarely gets upset on
the court or loses concentration
or gets ahead of himself.
A lot of guys are very flashy
but they'll also give you a lot of
points brainlessly. When Jim
does that it's not because he's
playing brain-dead tennis. He will
not beat himself."
Thomas' penchant for using
his noggin is apparently so evi
dent that upon meeting the team
on an airplane last year, a woman

took one look at the usually stoic
Thomas and remarked, "He looks
like the Thinker of the bunch." A
new nickname was born, and
Thomas continued to exhibit
superior thought processes on the
court.
"Obviously it helps if you can
keep your head in a tight situa
tion, and keep your head about
you all the time," Gould said. "All
of those things will help you in
crunch time against tough play
ers. I don't think many players
look forward to playing .Jim when
they see his name in the draw.
You have to go out and beat him
and it's hard to beat him."
Thomas' opponents also fear
him because his long preparation
to play the point sometimes
throws off their game even before
they have an opportunity to
return his booming serve.
"Both times that I played him I
found it very tough for my
rhythm," said California's Bobby
Mahal. "You would win two or
three points against his serve and
then he would slow it down. So
it's hard to get something going.
He's very lethargic and it slows
you down, too, and keeps you out
of mode. He even got penalized for
taking too much time between
serves when I played him down in
San Jose (at the Sybase Open
qualifying tournament)."
Gould explained: "Each player
is different. A guy who is hyper
likes to play faster. It is more
Jim's nature to play like he does
— he is not a hyper guy. If you are
a hyper guy and are playing

against a guy who is methodical,
it's going bother you."
Thomas' teammates appreci
ate his character traits for more
than one reason.
"Jim is quiet in general but not
with me," Becker said. "Some
times we disagree on strategy, but
playing with Jim is good because
you basically know he is going to
hold serve every time. His inner
intensity fires me up as much as a
person with a rah-rah attitude.
Sometimes he can calm me down
when I'm too excited.
"He is the one mellow guy on
the team. Jimmy is the epitome of
leading by example. He works
really hard, has a no |R.S.I atti
tude and it rubs off on the team in
a positive way. In a team meeting
he might prefer not to say some
thing and just let his actions
speak for him."
Thomas' actions on the court
are indeed reflections of his atti
tude off the court; he plays a no
nonsense serve and volley game
without flair but with the grace
that goes hand in hand with coor
dination.
"Jim basically does things
meticulously and I think it shows
in his tennis game. He is a well
coordinated athlete who is not a
tremendously quick athlete with
either his hands or his feet. That
dictates a little the style of play he
must use. He has to compensate
for the lack of hand and foot
speed. He is a big guy so he has a
lot of strength and he uses that to
help him. He can play straight
ahead tennis."

Thomas won one match at the
NCAA Championships — a sec
ond-set tie-break victory in the
quarterfinals against Mississippi
State — while his other three
matches were, you guessed it, sus
pended because the match was
already clinched. But if next
year's NCAAs are any closer than
they were this year, you can rest
assured that Thomas will be one
of the last matches left on the
court — a scenario Thomas will
relish.
"Those are the kinds of situa
tions you dream of, and you cer
tainly dream of winning,"
Thomas said after his victory
against Breen.
Thomas will be hard at work
on his game this summer as Stan
ford gears up for another run at
the NCAA crown.
"No one works harder than
Jim. His work ethic has improved
tremendously and he'll be a better
player next year than he was this
year," Gould saaid.
And as for Thomas, his com
ments confirm he is not content
to rest on his laurels.
"No one really thought about
the undefeated season earlier in
the year. You certainly don't
think about it when you're play
ing the matches. For me the high
light was winning the NCAA team
tournament in Athens. It was
what I had been working towards
for three years. We're going to
enjoy this one for a while but pret
ty soon we have to get back to
work in preparation for repeating
next vear."
The 1995 Stanford men's ten
nis team will be remembered as
one of the greatest groups of colle
gians ever assembled. The Cardi
nal amassed a perfect 27-0 record
on its way to winning the NCAA
Team Championship last week in
Athens, Ga. It was only the sec
ond time since the current team
tournament format was institut
ed 21 years ago that a team ended
the season undefeated — a feat
first accomplished by John McEn
roe and the 1978 Cardinal.
When people look back upon
the dream season, they will find
many moments that could have
turned 1995 into just a normal
season for Cardinal — perhaps a
season in which the team could
have lost a match or two, or even
could have failed to win the
national championship. A point
played differently, a game where a
player couldn't hold a serve, or a
match where a player couldn't
quite come back to win the third
set. The Cardinal indeed played
some close matches in 1995, and a
point here or there could have
made all the difference in some of
those matches.
On a cloudy day in Los Angeles
last April 7, 10 of those points
were played — and they were all
played in the same match. With
six matches played against UCLA
and the score deadlocked at 3-3,
Cardinal junior Jim Thomas
engaged in a memorable No. 4
singles battle with Bruin fresh
man Matt Breen. Stanford's
undefeated record was on the line
and everybody in attendance
knew it. The crowd witnessed 10
thrilling match points — five for
each player — before Thomas
finally pulled out a stunning 4-6,
7-5, 7-6 (12-10) victory to give
Stanford the team victory.

Thomas' last-minute heroics
against UCLA reminded Stanford
head coach Dick Gould of a simi
lar effort during the other dream
campaign 17 years ago.
"It was very much like the '78
season, seeing how Jimmy kept
our record intact. That year
against UCLA, we were trailing 3-
2 and it looked like UCLA was
going to put it away by making it
4-2. McEnroe was still on the
court against Elliot Teltscher.
John had match point against
him in the second set. They
played a long point — about 15
shots. It was a great point — one
of the best I've ever seen.
"Both players were up and
down during that point. Finally,
Teltscher had McEnroe on the
run. McEnroe was running full
blast across the court when he
somehow got his racquet on the
ball, and passed Teltscher, who
was standing at the net. The pass
ing shot just totally dumbfounded
Teltscher and everybody could see
it by the way he looked after the
shot. He was half the player from
that point on. Teltscher wilted
after that. It took a superhuman
effort by one guy to save that
match for us, and that is the same
thing Jimmy did against UCLA.
It takes a match like that to get
through a season undefeated. It
takes a great effort with your
backs against the wall."
But for Thomas, who finished
the 1995 regular season ranked
No. 65 nationally, it was all in a
day's work.
"It certainly wasn't just me,"
Thomas said. "We were down 3-1.
Three other guys had to win to
make my match important. I was
just doing my part, beating some
one who I thought I should beat,
who happened to be playing very
well that day. It was just nice to

his success.
compete in a match that turned
out so well for me and the other
guys.
"It was a pleasure playing
throughout the year with my
teammates. I had tremendous
confidence in their abilities. At
different times in the year, every
body pulled out big matches."
And yet Thomas' match was
one of the biggest. It was also the
second time in as many years that
he had clinched a victory in a
third-set tie-break; at the 1994
National Team Indoor Champi
onships he defeated Stefan Plot of
Mississippi State, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6
(10-8) after going down 1-4 in the
tie-breaker and fighting off a
match point. So it was not sur
prising when, after his win
against UCLA, some teammates
began calling Thomas "The Ice
man."
"Jim Thomas has such ice in
his veins it's unbelievable," said
teammate and doubles partner
Ricky Becker. "All of the matches
that he lost this year were after
the (team victory 1 was clinched,
and there is little doubt in my
mind that if the match was an
important match he would've
pulled it out."
Thomas only lost four out of 22
dual matches this year after
amassing a 22-1 record for the
1994 Cardinal. As Becker alluded

to, however, many of Thomas'
decisions came after Stanford had
already clinched the team victory
by winning the required four out
of seven points.
"I'm often one of the last peo
ple off the court, so it's not very
often that my match is important.
It's exciting when it is impor
tant," Thomas said.
The reason why Thomas'
matches often last so long is his
deliberate style of play. The 6-
foot-4 native of Canton, Ohio, is
known around the Pacific 10 Con
ference for taking his time
between points and drawing out
the length of the match, often to
the stage where the outcome
becomes moot because his team
mates have already clinched. But
alas there is method to his mad
ness.
"The first thing I do is look at
the balls to make sure I am serv
ing with the one that has been
used the least," Thomas
explained. "I pick out two of the
best three. If I'm on a roll I don't
have to look at all three.
"But that's only getting the
balls. Now I have the balls and I
can walk up to the line. I'm in the
habit of bouncing it a couple of
times. Ideally you want to try and
visualize where you're going to
serve and how your opponent is
going to return and what you're
going to do with the next shot."

game. Whether it's the first or the
last point of the match, Thomas
knows what he is going to do, and

that is play the point without
mental errors.
"I don't like to give away

"No one works harder than
Jim. His work ethic has improved
tremendously and he'll be a better
player next year than he was this
year," Gould saaid.
And as for Thomas, his com
ments confirm he is not content
to rest on his laurels.
"No one really thought about
the undefeated season earlier in
the year. You certainly don't
think about it when you're play
ing the matches. For me the high
light was winning the NCAA team
tournament in Athens. It was
what I had been working towards
for three years. We're going to
enjoy this one for a while but pret
ty soon we have to get back to
work in preparation for repeating
next vear."
