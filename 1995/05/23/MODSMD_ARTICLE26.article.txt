# The
						Iceman cometh as the Thinker
## Slowly and surely, Jim Thomas racks up wins — and nicknames 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
The 1995 Stanford men's ten
nis team will be remembered as
one of the greatest groups of colle
gians ever assembled. The Cardi
nal amassed a perfect 27-0 record
on its way to winning the NCAA
Team Championship last week in
Athens, Ga. It was only the sec
ond time since the current team
tournament format was institut
ed 21 years ago that a team ended
the season undefeated — a feat
first accomplished by John McEn
roe and the 1978 Cardinal.
When people look back upon
the dream season, they will find
many moments that could have
turned 1995 into just a normal
season for Cardinal — perhaps a
season in which the team could
have lost a match or two, or even
could have failed to win the
national championship. A point
played differently, a game where a
player couldn't hold a serve, or a
match where a player couldn't
quite come back to win the third
set. The Cardinal indeed played
some close matches in 1995, and a
point here or there could have
made all the difference in some of
those matches.
On a cloudy day in Los Angeles
last April 7, 10 of those points
were played — and they were all
played in the same match. With
six matches played against UCLA
and the score deadlocked at 3-3,
Cardinal junior Jim Thomas
engaged in a memorable No. 4
singles battle with Bruin fresh
man Matt Breen. Stanford's
undefeated record was on the line
and everybody in attendance
knew it. The crowd witnessed 10
thrilling match points — five for
each player — before Thomas
finally pulled out a stunning 4-6,
7-5, 7-6 (12-10) victory to give
Stanford the team victory.

Thomas' last-minute heroics
against UCLA reminded Stanford
head coach Dick Gould of a simi
lar effort during the other dream
campaign 17 years ago.
"It was very much like the '78
season, seeing how Jimmy kept
our record intact. That year
against UCLA, we were trailing 3-
2 and it looked like UCLA was
going to put it away by making it
4-2. McEnroe was still on the
court against Elliot Teltscher.
John had match point against
him in the second set. They
played a long point — about 15
shots. It was a great point — one
of the best I've ever seen.
"Both players were up and
down during that point. Finally,
Teltscher had McEnroe on the
run. McEnroe was running full
blast across the court when he
somehow got his racquet on the
ball, and passed Teltscher, who
was standing at the net. The pass
ing shot just totally dumbfounded
Teltscher and everybody could see
it by the way he looked after the
shot. He was half the player from
that point on. Teltscher wilted
after that. It took a superhuman
effort by one guy to save that
match for us, and that is the same
thing Jimmy did against UCLA.
It takes a match like that to get
through a season undefeated. It
takes a great effort with your
backs against the wall."
But for Thomas, who finished
the 1995 regular season ranked
No. 65 nationally, it was all in a
day's work.
"It certainly wasn't just me,"
Thomas said. "We were down 3-1.
Three other guys had to win to
make my match important. I was
just doing my part, beating some
one who I thought I should beat,
who happened to be playing very
well that day. It was just nice to
