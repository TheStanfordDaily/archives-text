# Wichita the next stop for baseball
## Cardinal meets Arkansas as Midwest I's three seed 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Stanford's boys of summer
will be playing their regionals
beyond the realm of their region
this week when the baseball
squad travels east to Wichita,
Kan., to start postseason play.
The Cardinal (32-22) com
pleted its regular season last
weekend and will play as the
third seed in the Midwest I
regional May 26-29.
"We knew we weren't going
to be a one seed, but we didn't
know if we would be a two seed
or a three seed," junior catcher
A.J. Hinch said. "Pretty much
after [the last loss] to Santa
Barbara we thought we might
get the three seed."
Texas Tech (48-12) nabbed
the top seed in the region while
host Wichita State (52-15) is the
second seed.
"I thought we were on the
bubble," head coach Mark Mar
quess said of Stanford's inabili
ty to get a second seed. "I didn't
have all the information that
the committee had. That's a
thankless job and you get a lot
of people mad at you."
Stanford will face Arkansas
(38-21), the fourth seed in the
region. The Cardinal will com
pete in the middle game of a Fri
day tripleheader at Wichita's
Tyler Field, beginning at 2:30
p.m. CDT. Providence (44-13)

will battle the Aggies in the
opener while Lamar (36-22) will
face the Shockers in the late
game.
"I'm excited," senior third
baseman Steve Carver said. "I
think we've got a good shot
playing Arkansas."
Stanford sports a respectable
18-8 record away from home
and has competed tough against
good teams away from Sunken
Diamond.
"We play really well on the
road," Hinch said. "This is
going to be a great chance for us
to play."
Marquess was happy with
the team's placement but had
some serious concerns about
the committee's treatment of
the West.
"I'm happy to be in the tour
nament, but I'm really con
cerned about the West," Mar
quess said. "Seven teams from
all of the West, that's it. I think
that's a slap in the face of West
Coast baseball. I can't believe
that there aren't more talented
teams out west that should be
in the tournament."
Last year there was no West
regional at all, and this year sev
eral western teams that might
have been deserving of a bid
were passed up. Arizona State,
Santa Clara and Nevada all had
legitimate shots at postseason
play but will stay home this
weekend.
