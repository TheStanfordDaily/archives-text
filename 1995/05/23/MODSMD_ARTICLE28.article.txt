Morris Udall, a candidate
for the 1976 Democratic
presidential nomination,
once compared our nation's
method of presidential selection
to football.

"It's like a football game," he
complained after the small three
percentage point margin separat
ing him from winner Jimmy
Carter in the New Hampshire pri
mary garnered him the title of
loser and also-ran from the
media.
"But [instead of the normal
rules], you say to the first team
that makes a first down with 10
yards, 'Hereafter, your team has
a special rule. Your first downs
are five yards. And if you make
three of those you get a two-yard
first down. And we're going to let
your first touchdown count 21

points. Now the rest of you bas
tards play catch-up by the regular
rules.' "
Udall was neither the first nor
the last person to describe an
aspect of our political system in
the context of a game. The reason
his opinion is not unique is
because it is true.
Elections are horse races. So
many candidates competing for a
limited number of votes. All striv
ing, pushing themselves, gallop
ing at top speed in order to cross
some threshold that will allow
them to claim victory.
In essence, Bob Dole and Phil
Gramm are thoroughbreds.
Lamar Alexander is more of a
long-shot. And the specter of
Colin Powell looms over the
entire scene — no one is quite
sure what he is going to do. News
papers and political pundits are
currently rating their chances of
success in the 1996 race for the
Republican nomination for Presi
dent much like the Vegas odds
makers handicap horses in the
Kentucky Derby or the Preak
ness.
Elections are also conflicts
between two teams, our political
parties, the Republicans and


A Dearth

Democrats. The ongoing contests
between these two sides have
characterized our country's polit
ical landscape for over 125 years.
If one just steps back for a sec
ond, one can see the similarities
between our monumental battles
with Cal in Big Game and the vio
lent attacks the Democratic
I'arty and the GOP make upon
each other. Feinstein and Huf'fin
gton slugged it out in a heavy
weight bout. President Clinton's
budget got shut out by the Senate
much like the Sharks got beaten
by the Wings.
Psychologists have likened our

political dispositions to the way
we feel about our favorite athlet
ic teams — they are formed early
in life, they often depend upon
where one lives, they are intense
at times and, most important,
they are not necessarily rational.
I saw Republicans rubbing the
results of the mid-term elections
in the faces of Democrats in the
same way the Yankees fans of my
native Connecticut often heckle
the more numerous supporters of
the Red Sox.
When our teams are doing well
we love them. The 1986 World
Champion Mets were the darlings
of New York. Now they get no
respect from anyone in the city,
including Letterman.
It's much the same with politi
cians. During the Gulf War,
George Bush had the highest

approval ratings of any president
in the post-World War II era. Just
a few months later, as the econo
my entered a period of recession,
he was hated and reviled by
enough of the country to lose his
bid for re-election to a virtual no
name.
Candidates for office and polit
ical figures often behave in man
ners consistent with the actions
of sport stars. How many times
have we seen someone come back
from insurmountable odds? Joe
Namath's Jets, the Nuggets over
the Sonics, Harry S. Truman,
Pete Wilson.
Seekers of public office create
as many media events as sports
figures. It's sort of like a kinder
garten class. The candidates run
around with scissors, beat each
other up and stick pencils up

their noses, all in a desperate
attempt to draw attention to
themselves (sort of reminds one
of ASSU politics). They hype
themselves the way Athletics
Departments all over the country
hype their "Heisman Trophy can
didates."
This type of game mentality
has been purported to harm our
political processes. I can't say I
disagree. I just can't help myself.
I enjoy the conflict, the little
intricacies of political debate too
much. It would be better if every
one didn't feel they had to com
pete, if they could work together,
but the interest level would be
much lower. Conflict stimulates
debates and increases levels of
information.
By now, you must be wonder
ing why I've written this column

on elections, a topic so unrelated
to sports. My co-editor thinks I'm
losing my marbles (and he may be
right). But trust me, there is a
method to my madness.
You see, this week The Stan
ford Daily is holding its election
for the next editor in chief.
Thinking about the sports
department and its role in the
election got me thinking about
sports and politics in general.
I won't bore you with details
about the campaign efforts of the
editor in chief hopefuls. But as
sports editor, I sit on a large bloc
of votes — the sports writers. The
candidates are courting my favor,
hoping that I can influence my
department's members — who
don't traditionally vote — to vote
for them.
What do I do? I have certain

visions of how I'd like to see the
sports department evolve over
the next few years. Do I remain
true to them? Or do I sell out to
the highest bidder?
I believe that the traditional
motto goes like "there's no 'I' in
team." If I follow that, then I
should keep my ideals and fight
for the rights of my department.
After all, if the department's for
tunes rise, then so do mine. But if
I sell out, I stand to reap a great
deal of benefits.
I haven't decided what to do
yet. ( I'm still waiting for the next
offer.) But let me know what you
think I should do.

Seth Goldstein is still pissed off
that Jack Kemp, yet another com
bination of sports and politics,
decided not to run for president.
