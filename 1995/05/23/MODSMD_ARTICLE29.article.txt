# Once just a polite neighbor, Sean McClain is now a fencing giant

Most mothers encourage their young to mind
their manners. But few children can attribute the
start of a successful athletic career and a potential
spot in the Olympics to a mother's enforcement of
politeness.
When freshman Sean McClain was 11, he fit the
stereotype of a pre-adolescent, Texan boy. He loved
football and basketball, and agreed with his friends
that his next-door neighbor, a boy interested in
drama and the opera, was a bit strange. So when
this neighbor came to McClain's door and asked him
to go to a fencing demonstration, McClain declined,
but his mother took him aside and warned him to
"be nice."
So McClain went. His interest was sparked when
he donned some gear and fenced that day. Eight
years later, McClain reigns as a fencing star, as both
the NCAA Foil Champion and the United States
National Epee Champion.
"I attribute my success in the beginning to natu
ral ability," McClain said. "After that, I worked hard
and just made the commitment."
After the fateful night when he witnessed his
first fencing demonstration, McClain, who was born
in Columbus, Ohio, and spent most of his younger
years in Odessa and Round Rock, Tex., spent the
next three years taking private fencing lessons and
competing in tournaments.
"My first competition was in Denver, the under
-12 national tournament," McClain said. "I won the
whole thing, and all of a sudden I loved it (fencing)."

A 6-4 Texas native, McClain now defies stereo
types, since the average height for a fencer is 5-11
and the most serious fencers come from the East
Coast. After three years of fencing in Texas, he
moved to New York at the age of 15.
"It was becoming harder to win the national
competitions," McClain said. "The East Coast kids
were getting better and better, but I was staying
the same. I loved Texas, but I was also excited to
leave."
McClain spent the next three years living in
Rochester, N.Y. with a host family and competing at
what was then the best fencing club in the nation,
the Rochester Fencing Club. He attended high
school when he could, but missed an average of 45
days a year.
"My first year in Rochester was miserable,"
McClain said. "My parents had always been really
lenient, but this host family was really strict, and I
became homesick."
But McClain, who has three younger brothers
and sisters, was able to spend his summers in Texas,
and managed to make it through his East Coast
experience. After his acceptance to Stanford his
senior year of high school, McClain deferred and
spent a year training in Germany.
"Their (the Germans') fencing style matches
mine," McClain said. "They are more aggressive,
more athletic, and have more power than, say the
French, who are into a lot more technique."
There are three categories of fencing — foil, sabre
and epee. Both the foil and sabre categories include
