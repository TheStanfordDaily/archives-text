# Once just a polite neighbor, Sean McClain is now a fencing giant
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Most mothers encourage their young to mind
their manners. But few children can attribute the
start of a successful athletic career and a potential
spot in the Olympics to a mother's enforcement of
politeness.
When freshman Sean McClain was 11, he fit the
stereotype of a pre-adolescent, Texan boy. He loved
football and basketball, and agreed with his friends
that his next-door neighbor, a boy interested in
drama and the opera, was a bit strange. So when
this neighbor came to McClain's door and asked him
to go to a fencing demonstration, McClain declined,
but his mother took him aside and warned him to
"be nice."
So McClain went. His interest was sparked when
he donned some gear and fenced that day. Eight
years later, McClain reigns as a fencing star, as both
the NCAA Foil Champion and the United States
National Epee Champion.
"I attribute my success in the beginning to natu
ral ability," McClain said. "After that, I worked hard
and just made the commitment."
After the fateful night when he witnessed his
first fencing demonstration, McClain, who was born
in Columbus, Ohio, and spent most of his younger
years in Odessa and Round Rock, Tex., spent the
next three years taking private fencing lessons and
competing in tournaments.
"My first competition was in Denver, the under
-12 national tournament," McClain said. "I won the
whole thing, and all of a sudden I loved it (fencing)."

A 6-4 Texas native, McClain now defies stereo
types, since the average height for a fencer is 5-11
and the most serious fencers come from the East
Coast. After three years of fencing in Texas, he
moved to New York at the age of 15.
"It was becoming harder to win the national
competitions," McClain said. "The East Coast kids
were getting better and better, but I was staying
the same. I loved Texas, but I was also excited to
leave."
McClain spent the next three years living in
Rochester, N.Y. with a host family and competing at
what was then the best fencing club in the nation,
the Rochester Fencing Club. He attended high
school when he could, but missed an average of 45
days a year.
"My first year in Rochester was miserable,"
McClain said. "My parents had always been really
lenient, but this host family was really strict, and I
became homesick."
But McClain, who has three younger brothers
and sisters, was able to spend his summers in Texas,
and managed to make it through his East Coast
experience. After his acceptance to Stanford his
senior year of high school, McClain deferred and
spent a year training in Germany.
"Their (the Germans') fencing style matches
mine," McClain said. "They are more aggressive,
more athletic, and have more power than, say the
French, who are into a lot more technique."
There are three categories of fencing — foil, sabre
and epee. Both the foil and sabre categories include

many rules, such as the one man
dating that fencers can only
strike their opponents in the
torso area. In epee, the fencer can
hit anywhere. Both foil and epee
use a stabbing motion, whereas
sabre calls for a cutting motion.
In McClain's opinion, foil
requires the best knowledge of
fencing. He is primarily a foil
fencer, though he occasionally
competes epee "for fun." His
coach at Stanford, Zoran Tulum,
is also the National Men's Foil
Coordinator.
According to McClain, Tulum
has taught him to be more
aggressive. Since it is harder to
defend at the senior level,
aggressiveness and knowledge of
the game become more crucial.
"You reach the level where

everyone is fast and strong, and
you then reach the point when
you have to be street smart,"
Tulum said. "You have to play
with the opponent's mind, and
slowness becomes an asset. It
comes down to who's a better
liar.
"Fencing is a chess game with
the speed of boxing," Tulum
said.
Tulum thinks that McClain
has the mental and physical abil
ities to be a master of the game.
Yet, he also thinks McClain
needs maturity, and to start
being more serious.
"This year Sean is getting
away with things," Tulum said.
"Because when he's in school,
the diploma is the most impor
tant thing.
"Sean is definitely one of the
best U.S. fencers," he continued.
"I am very picky though, and
that is not enough. When I am
done with him, he's going to be a

world champion."
Geoff Donaker, captain of the
fencing team, offered another
perspective. "Sean is very out
spoken and kind of a prankster.
People either like or dislike him.
It's hard to not have an opinion
of him, especially since he is on
the top."
McClain will continue to work
at being one of the best in the
world next year both by red
shirting and not taking a full
load of classes. By not competing
for Stanford for a season and
taking only one class a quarter,
McClain will have more time to
train straight through to the
1996 Olympics.
According to McClain, a
potential economics major, tak
ing a year off next year will
increase his success as a fencer
since it was quite a challenge this
year to juggle academics, a social
life, and traveling to various
countries every month for World

Cups. Last year, he was ranked
fifth in the world, whereas this
year he was in the top twenty, a
fall he attributes to the rigor of
being a Stanford student.
McClain, a new Sigma Chi
pledge, does not regret devoting
so much time to fencing. He
acknowledged that he has
missed out on a lot of things but
also knows it has been worth it.
"I didn't go to my senior
prom," McClain said, "but I still
go out every weekend."
"Sean is a pretty well-round
ed guy," Donaker, also a fellow
Sigma Chi said. "He's got plans,
is fine socially, and will have a
good education. All many of the
other top fencers do is fence."
McClain's goal is to make it to
the 1996 Olympics and then cul
minate his years of fencing in the
year 2000 at the Olympics in Aus
tralia. After his fencing career
ends, he plans to go to business
school.
