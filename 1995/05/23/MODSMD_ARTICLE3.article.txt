# Despite some advances, affirmative action still needed, law fellow says

Law School teaching fellow Frank Wu led a forum
on Asian Americans and affirmative action yesterday,
defining the "model minority" and explaining how
Asian Americans have become the target of the affir
mative action debate.
About 15 people attended the forum last night at
the Asian American Activities Center. Wu explained
Asian Americans' problematic role in history and their
presence in the affirmative action debate, with a dis
cussion following.
Asian Americans have been held up as a "model mi
nority," an example of a successful ethnic group and a
reason that affirmative action is no longer needed, Wu
said. Asian Americans have been docile and conserva

tive — not threatening as dominating public figures,
he added.
The stereotypical Asian computer rterd, Wu said, is
not a societal threat, so people trumpet their success in
that one academic area and hold them up as a reason
affirmative action is no longer needed.
"People who say they are colorblind and then use
Asian Americans as an example of a successful minor
ity group are willing to be colorblind only when it suits
their purpose." Wu said.
Affirmative action is often used as a scapegoat in
bad economic times and its opponents say it promotes
racism and reverse discrimination, Wu said.
He also described the arguments of the proponents
of the California Civil Rights Initiative, a ballot pro-
posal aimed at eliminating racial
preferences in hiring and public
education.
The measure's proponents
suggest that Asian Americans are
actually victims of affirmative
action in California, Wu said.
They say that quotas reduce the
number of Asian-American accep
tances in university admissions.
Wu countered that argument by

reminding the audience that
strict racial quotas are illegal and
saying Asian Americans have
been"the beneficiaries of the
spirit of the civil rights move
ment."
If affirmative action were elim
inated, society would find another
way to limit minority presence,
Wu said.
"There is no one meritocracy,"
he said. "How can we have only
one measure of success?"
Comparing success between
ethnic groups is inappropriate,
Wu explained, because each has a

different historical background.
Wu also talked about affirmative
action benefiting whites, such as
the admissions of "legacies" to
universities over other students.
For years, Asian Americans
had been considered ideal work
ers in society: intelligent, obedi
ent and hard-working. Wu
described the Chinese labor of the
19th century, mentioning that
"coolie" labor was used in build
ing the transcontinental railroad
and Chinese laborers were
imported into the South after the
Civil War to compete against the

newly freed blacks.
"Labor groups were pitted
against each other to see who
could work the fastest for the
least wages," Wu said. "Italian
against Chinese, Chinese against
Irish."
After World War 11, the job
market closed up and the traits
which had been seen as positive
became negative, Wu said.
"This model minority image
was reversed," he said. "Chinese
who were thought of as hard
working became seen as competi
tive. Docile became sneaky."
