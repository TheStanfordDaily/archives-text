# Facing a packed market for professors
## Last week's Faculty Senate announcement old news for graduate students 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
Without calling for a reduction in the
number of graduate students, the Facul
ty Senate's recommendation last week
that individual departments inform stu
dents of their job prospects drew mixed
feelings from graduate students already
accustomed to a tight job market.
"I think they're covering their butts,"
said Dwight Bergles, a doctorate candi
date in the Department of Molecular and
Cellular Physiology who plans to defend
his thesis in July. "But what are they
going to do?"
Bergles feels Stanford's position is an
understandable one, arguing that in the
life sciences, the competition for grant

money has become so fierce as to impel
primary investigators — professors who
lead laboratories — to spend much of
their time writing grant proposals, thus
requiring a stable influx of graduate stu
dents and post-doctoral fellows to keep
the lab running.
"The outlook is bleak," he added. "On
the one hand, I say, 'yes, drop the num
ber of graduate students.' On the other,
I don't know if that's the best for science.
I think Stanford's response is reason
able, to tell students that it's not a sure
thing and to give incoming students the
facts.
"I think anyone close to getting their
degrees is thinking about alternative ca
reers," Bergles said. "But after years in
the lab, we don't have the experience."

Most students follow the tradition of
attending graduate school expecting a
professorship somewhere in their fu
ture.
"The reality is that it's not going to
happen," said Srinivas Akkaraju, an
M.D. / Ph.D. student in immunology,
who said that if he were not also pursu
ing an M.D., "I'd be pretty scared."
Akkaraju said the idea of telling in
coming students that academic appoint
ments are extraordinarily difficult to ob
tain is a good one and said that students
can be misled about their prospects by
their initial years in the lab.
"Why do five or six years of a Ph.D.
and then not get to the goal you're hop
ing for?" he asked. "The selection
process really begins about 10 years

after you get into it. It's easy to get into
grad school, easy to get into a post-doc.
It's not easy to become a professor."
"When I was applying to grad school,
an article in Science (magazine) said that
there would be an enormous job market
because of retirements," Bergles said.
"The outlook was golden. Now, there are
just no jobs."
Andrea Orzoff, a second-year gradu
ate student pursuing a doctorate in the
History Department, said Stanford's re
sponse to the problem of a dwindling job
market for its graduate students is hard
ly news.
"Anybody that goes into a Ph.D. track
knows that the job market is horrible
