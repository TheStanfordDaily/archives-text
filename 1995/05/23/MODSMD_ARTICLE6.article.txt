# Candidate for dean stresses accessibility
## 
### Anne Dubinsky Contributing writer 
The first of four finalists for the vacant dean of stu
dents position met with members of the Stanford com
munity yesterday afternoon in Tresidder Union.
Marc Lee Wais, who holds two master's degrees and
a doctorate in education, is currently assistant vice
president for student affairs at the University of Mary
land at Baltimore.
The University of Maryland is mostly a graduate
campus — with only 1,000 undergraduates, compared
to more than 4,000 graduate students.
"The undergraduate experience provides the heart
and the lifeblood and the fabric of a college campus
that I've missed," Wais said, explaining why he wants
to become the new dean of students at Stanford.
Emphasizing three main areas that an effective
dean should cover, Wais said a dean should be an ad
vocate for students, working to address their needs
and concerns and empowering them by placing them
on all relevant boards and committees.
In addition, Wais said the dean should play a critical
role in evaluating the accessibility and cost of students
services on campus.
A dean should also work to ensure that programs
meet students' interests and desires, Wais said.
Accessibility and approachability are two charac
teristics of a good dean, Wais said. He said he has al
ways had an open door policy, both at the University of
Maryland and as the deem of stu
dents at Fairleigh Dickinson Uni
versity in New Jersey. He would
like to live on campus, possibly as
a resident fellow, and advise
undergraduates, he said.
Wais said he would also like to
print articles in campus publica
tions in order to share his views
with the Stanford community. He,
his wife and his two young daugh
ters would also attend campus
events. "Being visible at activities
is an important part of being [the
dean of students]," he said.
He said he is also against the
idea of a speech code. "People
should be able to speak their free
mind," he said, adding that when
speech is stilled, all ideas are not
being heard. Hearing different
views, no matter how hurtful, can

be a learning experience, Wais
said.
When asked by Council of Pres
idents member-elect Rich Stolz
how Wais would advise a student
trying to decide between writing
an honors thesis and taking a posi
tion as the head of a student orga
nization, Wais said he would
choose the honors thesis.
"The main primary purpose of
being at Stanford is academics,"
he said. "You need to figure out
what is best for you academically.
I can't think of many things that
would override an honors thesis."
The best way for organizations
to prove their worth is to justify
their existence, Wais said. Bud
gets at the University of Mary
land are "zero-based," meaning
that the program starts with no
money and then has to justify its
reasons for wanting money. This
plan is a good way for organiza
tions on campus to operate as
well, he said.
