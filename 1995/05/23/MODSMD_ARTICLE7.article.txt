## Quilt project founder gives history of AIDS memorial 
### Sara Southern 
"Our lives depend on educating ourselves and
our friends" about AIDS, said Cleve Jones, founder
of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, to an
audience of more than 50 yesterday evening at An
nenberg Auditorium.
Beginning with what he called a message of
"very rational hope," Jones described new medical
developments as well as his personal expectations
for AIDS awareness. The speech was part of Stan
ford AIDS Awareness Week, which runs through
this Sunday.
Jones said his vision for the quilt, which now
consists of more than 30,000 panels made by indi
viduals wishing to memorialize the loved ones who
have died of AIDS, came from the frustration he
felt in 1985 after seeing many friends die of AIDS
and hearing the growing statistics.
"I had heard of all who had died, but there was

no evidence," he said. "If my neighborhood in the
Castro was instead a vast meadow with the dead
bodies of victims lying in the sun, people would
know and if they were human, they would feel com
passion."
Jones explained that the quilt became the "safe,
middle-America symbol" that would eventually
claim national and international attention.
For Jones, it was also a year that he tested posi
tive for HIV, moved to a very homophobic Sacra
mento and most importantly, discovered his be»t
friend Marvin Feldman was dying of AIDS. He re
ceived the news after two young men stabbed
