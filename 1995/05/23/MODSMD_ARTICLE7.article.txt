# 'Rational hope'
## Quilt project founder gives history of AIDS memorial 
### Sara Southern 
"Our lives depend on educating ourselves and
our friends" about AIDS, said Cleve Jones, founder
of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, to an
audience of more than 50 yesterday evening at An
nenberg Auditorium.
Beginning with what he called a message of
"very rational hope," Jones described new medical
developments as well as his personal expectations
for AIDS awareness. The speech was part of Stan
ford AIDS Awareness Week, which runs through
this Sunday.
Jones said his vision for the quilt, which now
consists of more than 30,000 panels made by indi
viduals wishing to memorialize the loved ones who
have died of AIDS, came from the frustration he
felt in 1985 after seeing many friends die of AIDS
and hearing the growing statistics.
"I had heard of all who had died, but there was

no evidence," he said. "If my neighborhood in the
Castro was instead a vast meadow with the dead
bodies of victims lying in the sun, people would
know and if they were human, they would feel com
passion."
Jones explained that the quilt became the "safe,
middle-America symbol" that would eventually
claim national and international attention.
For Jones, it was also a year that he tested posi
tive for HIV, moved to a very homophobic Sacra
mento and most importantly, discovered his be»t
friend Marvin Feldman was dying of AIDS. He re
ceived the news after two young men stabbed

"I thought I had freed myself of
all my hatred for heterosexuals
and suddenly I felt flooded with it
again," Jones said. "Their igno
rance hurt."
The deaths he had witnessed in
San Francisco and the anger he felt
after the attack, combined with his
own depression and the impending
death of his best friend, was the
impetus for the now-renowned
AIDS quilt, which began in Jones'
basement a year later in 1986.
The first panel of the quilt was a
tribute to Feldman, but Jones soon
informed 40 friends of his vision
and he displayed the quilt with
their additions from the balcony of
then-mayor Dianne Feinstein. As a
result of the subsequent media
coverage, panels began to pour in
from all over the country.

"All across the nation total
strangers were taking their pain,
their anger, their grief and making
it art," Jones said.
When he took the quilt to the
march on Washington, D.C. in
May 1987, the quilt had grown to
1,920 panels. Jones plans to take
it again to the capital in October
1996, a few weeks before the elec
tion, to "demand that the govern
ment finally now do what is
right."
"I have watched three presi
dents fail to lead the nation for
ward on this issue," Jones said. "It
is frustrating, but my hope is
stronger. ... I have spoken with
countless individuals and have
found an enormous reservoir of
good will, intelligence and compas
sion."
He stressed, however, that good
will, hospices and candlelight vigils
alone will not save lives. Jones
urged the audience to take political
action and write letters demanding
legislation to address the AIDS
issue.
