# Students spotlight women's issues on Web
## Group will work on page to commemorate this year's UN conference on women 
### Kristie Lilje Contributing writer 
This summer Stanford students will have
the opportunity to develop a World Wide
Web page as part of an educational project
that will commemorate this year's United
Nations World Conference on Women in Bei
jing.
In collaboration with Stanford junior
Jason Wishnow, local computer programmer
David Seigel has brought his concerns about
world issues, women and the environment to
the campus. With the help of Stanford stu
dents, the two want to establish their Web
site as a premiere showcase for the confer
ence.
The site will serve as a background piece
for the conference, exploring women's issues
and women's history, Seigel said. Funda
mentally, the project "is a grassroots effort
to educate people," he said. Seigel also

explained that issues involving how women
are treated, women's literacy and women's
health care are just a few of the subjects the
project will address.
"The hard part is getting attitudes
changed. We want people to understand why
there is a conference and what issues need
the most attention," he said.
There will be plenty of people at the con
ference, Seigel said, but this project is trying
to reach those who won't be there or those
who don't even know it is going on.
"Stanford has the student resources,
technology and people that we need to make
this project happen," Wishnow said. The
University has both student and faculty
interest â€” people who would put a lot of
energy and hard work into this as a volun
teer project, he explained.
Stanford also has the resources needed to
produce a Web site aimed at educating the
general public on the conference and

women's issues. Ideally, the group would
also like to produce a video aimed at educat
ing high school students, Wishnow said.
Students who are interested in helping
with the project will be able to enroll in a
class taught by Seigel this summer. The
School of Education and the Communication
Department at Stanford have agreed to
sponsor the project, but the class will proba
bly be taught through Continuing Education
as a research project and not for credit,
Seigel explained. The project is not spon
sored by the United Nations in any way.
The group has already had a few organi
zational meetings and estimates that about
20 students will be involved this summer.
"It's not too late for students to begin, how
ever," Seigel noted. "We'll be having another
meeting within the next couple of weeks for
those who are already interested and for any
new people who want to be a part of this
summer project," he said.
