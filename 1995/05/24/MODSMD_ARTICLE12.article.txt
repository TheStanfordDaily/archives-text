### Irene Cua Dy 
The fifth annual Amy J. Blue Award, which each
year recognizes an outstanding University staff mem
ber, will be presented today to Beth Kane, the director
of research administration at the School of Medicine.
Provost Condoleezza Rice and Barbara Butterfield,
vice president for faculty and staff services, will appear
at the ceremony to present the award. The ceremony,
which begins at 4 p.m. at the Amy J. Blue Garden in
the Serra complex, will also honor four other staff
members with smaller "Amy" awards.
Kane will receive a marble award and $1,000 to
support professional development activities of her
choice. Each "Amy" winner will receive a crystal award
and will remain eligible for future Amy J. Blue Awards.
The "Amy" award honorees are John Gallagher,
supervisor in the electric shop; LaJauna Guillory, a
member of the Engineering Research Administration;
Laura Selznick, director of Undergraduate Research
Opportunities; and Nancy Waie, Buying and Paying
Reengineering Team leader.
Kane came to Stanford in March 1989, beginning
as associate director of administration at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Prevention. She has
since moved up in the ranks at the School of Medicine
and is currently the co-manager of the Re-Engineering
Research Administration pilot project.
Committed to change and progress, Kane created a
group called SMART, the School of Medicine Admin
istrators Roundtable. The newly formed group will
serve as a forum for Stanford medical administrators
to share problems and information.
"The key to making change work is open and
strong communication," she said in a statement
announcing her award.
In describing her feelings towards the award, Kane
said, "I'm stunned, excited, overwhelmed and hon
ored." She added, "I like the award because it has no
barriers. The nomination can come from anyone in
the Stanford community."

A co-worker who nominated Kane described her as
"energetic, positive and creative. She is always cheer
ful, supportive and upbeat. She never mentions her
problems but is always concerned with how others are
managing theirs."
The "Amy" award recipients have also done excep
tional work in their respective fields.
Gallagher, who supervises 16 employees in a two
unit department of electricians and lighting special
ists, was "delighted and surprised" when he was nom
inated after working at Stanford for only four months.
A colleague described Gallagher as "the hardest-work
ing man we have ever seen. He is always very positive
and energetic, and always supports his workers."
As URO director, Selznick has served as an "advis
er, an organizer, a 'surrogate mom,' an editor and a
friend," one student nominator wrote.
Guillory has served as office assistant in the Elec
trical Engineering Research Administration, manager
of the EERA Post-Award Accounting Office and a
member of the Engineering Research Administration
in the 10 years she has been at Stanford. She has been
lauded by colleagues as "a veiy dynamic individual."
Ware, who deals with procurement issues, was
praised by a colleague as "an excellent team leader."
Another colleague said Ware is "committed to improv
ing the procurement process for all 'customers' at
Stanford."
The awards were established by a small group of
women to honor Amy J. Blue, who died of brain can
cer in May 1988. At the time of her death, Blue was
the vice president for administrative services and facil
ities and the highest-ranking woman on the adminis
trative staff. The annual award is supported through
an endowment by the small group of women and con
tributions by Blue's family, friends and colleagues.
Nominations for the award can be submitted by
any Stanford faculty, staff or student. The qualities
the Amy J. Blue Award Selection Committee looks for
are: dedication to accomplishment, commitment to
people and enthusiasm.
