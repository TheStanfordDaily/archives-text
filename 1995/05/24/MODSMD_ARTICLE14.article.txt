## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate shot down Sen. Phil
Gramm's effort yesterday to add
tax cuts to the Republican bal
anced-budget plan, exposing
deep rifts within GOP ranks
over one of the party's premier
priorities for the year.
In a fight driven as much by
presidential politics as anything
else, senators rejected the plan
by the Texas Republican and
presidential candidate by a vote
of 69-31.
As expected, Gramm ran into
solid opposition from Democrats
and from Republicans who pre

fer an all-out effort to eliminate
deficits. All 46 Democrats,
joined by 23 of 54 Republicans,
voted no.
Gramm proposed cutting
taxes on families, businesses and
investors by $160 billion over
five years in a package that was
similar to the collection of levy
reductions already approved by
the House. In that chamber,
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
has called the tax cuts the
"crown jewel" of the "Contract
With America,"the campaign
pledges GOP candidates made to
the electorate last fall.
