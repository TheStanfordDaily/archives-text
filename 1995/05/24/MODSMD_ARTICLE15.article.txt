# Bomb site blown up

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -
Standing just a block away in the
hazy dawn light, they were expect
ing to hear warning signals before
the nine-story hulk of the federal
building was brought down with
strategically placed explosives.
But buffeting winds drowned
out the sirens and when the
remains of the building collapsed
yesterday with a thundering boom,
survivors of the bombing and rela
tives of the dead instinctively
ducked, recoiled and trembled.
"I wasn't expecting it. I heard
the explosion and it brought it all
back," said Priscilla Salyers, who
was pinned under concrete for four
hours after her fifth-floor office
toppled to the ground more than a
month ago.
"That's what it sounded like,"
she said, wiping away tears.
"That's what I remember."
As on April 19, it started with a
loud boom, followed by a billowing
cloud of dust.
But this time, there was no
bleeding, no frantic screams, no
throngs of people fleeing in terror.
There was no fire or thick black
smoke, no blaring car alarms, no
stretchers covered in bloody
sheets. No firefighters cradling
dead babies.
In seven seconds, the remains of
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building seemed to melt into the
ground, floor by floor, as the dust
mushroomed into a thick grayish

brown cloud. The building was
reduced to a 27-foot pile of rubble.
The center of the building was
the first to fall. Then the two sides
bowed and heaved and folded in.
The towering elevator shaft col
lapsed on top as the last of nearly
150 pounds of dynamite exploded.
About a mile away, the blast
sounded like firecrackers in the
distance. In contrast, the 4,800-
pound truck bomb that gouged out
the building a month ago shook the
ground 30 miles away.
About 2,000 people, many car
rying video cameras and binocu
lars, watched the 7:01 a.m. demoli
tion from police barricades,
rooftops and parking decks.
Michelle Meek, whose mother
died in the building, was so startled
by the demolition that she grabbed
her father's shirt collar and her
brother's neck, "just to hang on."
The site may eventually become
a memorial park; the govern
ment's General Services Adminis
tration has not yet decided what to
do.
At least 167 people died because
of the bombing. The bodies of two
of them — Christy Rosas, 22, and
Virginia Thompson, 56, both cred
it union employees — remain
entombed in the rubble, and police
believe a third person may also be
there.
He is 54-year-old Alvin Justes,
who lived nearby and frequented
the credit union.
