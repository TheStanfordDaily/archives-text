Foreign spending cut
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
voted to cut $478 million more in foreign
spending yesterday, disregarding President
Clinton's threat to veto the Republicans' far
reaching foreign policy legislation.
Even before the latest cut, Clinton allied
the bill "shortsighted, scattershotted"
because of its deep aits and forced foreign
policy changes. It would now slash aid by $3

billion over the next two years.
Republicans in the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee also moved ahead with a bill
that would make similar cuts.
The House voted 276-134 for an amend
ment to make even more irid reductions in
the bill Clinton had denounced earlier in the
day. The House, on a voice vote, also added a
provision tliat aid should be denied to any
country that consistently votes against the
United States in the United Nations.

A final vote on the bill is set for tomorrow,
with dozens of amendments pending
I)NA matches Simpson's
LOS ANGELES (AF) â€” Prosecutors
piled up more damaging I)NA evidence
yesterday against O.J. Simpson with a sci
entist rattling off new test results showing
Simpson's genetic fingerprints in blood
near two slashed bodies.
Using a different method of DNA analy

sis than earlier prosecution experts, crimi
nalist Renee Montgomery also testified
that blood from Simpson's Ford Bronco
and from a glove found on his property had
the same genetic patterns as the victims
and Simpson.
Montgomery's rapid-fire recitation of
results was in sharp contrast to the days
spent by fellow state Department of Justice
scientist Gaiy Sims and private laboratoiy
director Robin Cotton to explain PCR and

RFLP, two other forms of DNA testing.
Montgomery said of 23 bloodstains test
ed on clothing worn by Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman, 16 showed
a mixture of the victims' blood but none
was consistent with Simpson's blood.
Simpson's lawyers have pressed a two
pronged defense: that there was a conspir
acy to frame him and that sloppy evidence
collection by police rendered results use
less.
