						Walk proceeds 
### 
After no shortage of
hullabaloo, the University
has announced that the
now-permanently-christened
"Wacky Walk" will proceed. Yes,
graduating seniors will frolic in
the sun, wrestle on the grass and
toss discs in front of their loved
ones during Commencement.
The University deserves credit
for responding to the demands of
the student body on this issue. The
initial move to take away the Walk
was clearly wrong, and adminis
trators quickly realized that stu
dents were outraged and took the
only plausible move â€” a retreat.
The students who rallied to
protest the changes in the proces
sion are also to be commended. If
students do not make their voices
heard on these matters, the Uni
versity will not know if its deci
sions are unpopular. If they do not
voice their opinions loudly (as they
did very effectively), Stanford may

not acquiesce as readily to their
demands.
But students should take better
advantage of their representation
in University decision-making pro
cesses. The Senior Class Presi
dents did consent to the proposed
changes, and did so without get
ting an accurate reading of stu
dents' views on the issue.
Representatives of the student
body, whether class presidents or
members of University commit
tees, bear a great deal of responsi
bility. To be effective representa
tives, they must communicate
with fellow students to find out
how they feel about controversial
issues. Similarly, students must
approach their representatives to
inform them of their opinions.
If students and their representa
tives act effectively and responsi
bly, the administration and the stu
dents can avoid future fiascos like
the cancellation of the Wacky Walk.
