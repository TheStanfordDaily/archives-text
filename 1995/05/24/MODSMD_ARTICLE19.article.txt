# Cleaning up waste
## 
### 
AFTER A HISTORY of violat
ing health and safety regula
tions of the California Envi
ronmental Protection Agency, it
appears that Stanford is cleaning up
its act.
The University, which admitted
to 640 violations of state law over a
six-year period, agreed to a $2.65
million settlement with the Califor
nia EPA last September. Last week,
the University *6 Committee on
Health and Safety reported that
state EPA inspections last month
discovered no new violations of fed
eral or state regulations since the
settlement this fall.
Assuming that no violations went
undiscovered, the University should
be congratulated for its record of
success. Much of this is due to proce
dural changes, such as correcting
improper labeling on hazardous
waste containers, and reducing the
maximum waste storage period
from a year to 90 days.
More specifically, the Committee

on Health and Safety deserves recog
nition. In addition to resolving the
University's problems with the state
EPA, the committee has responded
to public pressure and shifted incin
eration of hazardous waste from the
hospital to off-campus contractors.
Stanford should continue to
actively strive to improve its record
of production, handling and dispos
al of hazardous waste. Even if the
University is within the guidelines
of the state regulatory agency does
not mean more cannot be done —
the University would do well by
exceeding the requirements of those
regulations and pushing to improve
its environmental record even fur
ther.
This would be an intelligent busi
ness decision since in the long term
state environmental regulations will
likely become more strict. Reducing
the University's toxic waste genera
tion would also benefit the public
health and peace of mind of the
Stanford community.
