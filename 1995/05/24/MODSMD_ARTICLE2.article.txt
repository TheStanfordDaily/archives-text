# 'A very clear understanding of the definition of the roles'
## Panel attacks federalist questions 
### Valerie Hsieh 
Change is forthcoming in the relation
ship between federal and state govern
ments, a panel of experts agreed yesterday
in a forum at the Hoover Institution.
The panelists, participants in a two
day conference called "Revitalizing Amer
ican Federalism" sponsored by Hoover,
addressed concerns that the federal gov
ernment has been dominating the divi
sion of power inherent in the federalist
system.
Four governors, including California
Gov. Pete Wilson, will participate in a
roundtable discussion today at 1 p.m.
After moderator Henry S. Rowen,
Hoover senior fellow and professor at the
Graduate School of Business, introduced
some core concepts of a federal system,
each of the four panelists addressed a spe
cific policy issue.
Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin

Meese 111, a Hoover visiting fellow, spoke
about increased federal regulation over
the states. "The federal government has
used its spending power to place states
into a subordinate position," he said.
Despite the nation's history of differ
ing interpretations of the roles of federal
and state authority, the founding fathers
had "a very clear understanding of the de
finition of the roles" of the two levels of
government, Meese said.
This "understanding" has changed
significantly since then, he continued,
particularly in the last 50 years, to the
point that "the 10th Amendment has
gradually been eroded," making it diffi
cult to determine what is meant by
"states' rights."
Specifically, Meese pointed out in
creases in a number of comprehensive
regulations. He also identified federal
mandates that accompany funding to
states, direct requirements upon states to

take on new responsibilities and the fed
eral government's pre-empting of state
regulatory roles as methods the federal
government has employed to subordinate
states.
But he and fellow panelist Richard
Nathan, director of New York's Rocke
feller Institute of Government, expressed
a belief that the current environment will
lead to change in the division of powers.
Nathan, who addressed the issue of
"social safety nets," said that the chang
ing environment is "part and parcel of the
budget-balancing amendment." To that
end, politicians are "very seriously" look
ing at new ways to adjust federal funding,
including giving block grants to states in
stead of direct funding, especially for enti
tlement programs.
Receiving funding in blocks would
allow states to set caps on spending and
remove federal government-imposed
strings that are sometimes
attached to entitlement programs
such as Aid to Families with
Dependent Children and Medicare.

We are essentially "talking of cut
ting up the safety net," Nathan
said.
Liberal critics who believe this
prospect will hurt the poor criticize
this trend, said Nathan, and sug
gest a possible backlash. But this is
not the only possible consequence
to the reform of social safety nets,

he said. "Very possibly what's
going to happen is that the states
will rise to the occasion and do
innovative things with their broad
ened authority," Nathan suggest
ed.
Urban Institute Senior Consul
tant Johi Shannon, in his segment
on competition among the states,
proposed that lessening a key area
of federal authority over state
activity — the regulation of inter
state commerce — might prove
beneficial. Interstate competition,
he said, has not been given
"enough credit for stabilizing the
fiscal behavior of the federal sys
tem."
Shannon talked about the bene
fits of the "invisible hand" of public
service and expenditure competi
tion over the "heavy hand" of
Washington.
In this model, poorer southern
or Rocky Mountain states — which
want to attract new businesses —
raise taxes to improve education
and social services. Other, richer
states, such as California and New
York, which traditionally have had
geographical advantages, will have
to lower taxes to remain competi
tive. In this way, no state's eco
nomic development interest will go
too far ahead or fall behind other
states.
In his segment titled "Constitu
tional Issues: Distribution of
Authority and Accountability,"
Hoover Fellow Abraham D. Sofaer
discussed a recent court case in
which the Supreme Court ruled a
statute unconstitutional and decid
ed that the federal government
should only have authority over
matters that "substantially" affect
interstate commerce.
This distinction, although it
does not invalidate many existing
laws, "mandates a more rigorous
look by Congress at what it's
doing," said Sofaer.
