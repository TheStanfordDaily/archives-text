## Three types of non-daters 
### 
IAM FINALLY going to answer the
eternal question that has puzzled
and intrigued Stanford students for
over 100 years: Why is there no dating
at Stanford?
After an in-depth psychological and
sociological study of Stanford students
(OK, two of them) 1 have divided all of
us into three distinct groups, which I
will define below.
1. The Eternally Attached Student.
We all know several couples in this cat
egory. They met at some point during
their freshman years, usually fall quar
ter. They started as friends in their
dorms or CIV sections, were set up with
each other for a Screw-Your-Roommate
dance, and the rest, as they say, was
history. One very seldom sees either
member of these couples alone, unless
they sadly do not share all of the same
classes. Studying together in Tresidder
or Green Library is their most common
public activity, replacing any need to go
on a real date. A trait common to almost
every Eternally Attached student is the
presence of a disgruntled roommate,
upset that he or she must attempt to
ignore the frequent "nookie" (to quote a
fellow columnist) occurring in the bot
tom bunk or on the futon in the next
room. Graduate students who met dur
ing their undergraduate years also fit
into this category.
Sadly, except for the lucky few who
apply to and attend the same graduate
schools, most of these relationships are

doomed to fail once the golden years of
undergraduate life draw to a close. The
Eternally Attached must go their sepa
rate ways, and somehow learn to work
and sleep alone.
2. The Dating-Is-A-Waste-of-Time, I-
Must-Study Student. This category
unfortunately encompasses the vast
majority of the graduate population,
and a significant number of the under
graduates as well. These are the stu
dents who are at Stanford for one thing,
and one thing only: a perfect transcript.
Why bother with pursuing the time
consuming pursuit of the elusive "nook
ie" when the chem midterm is only two
weeks away? One can often find these
students in Sweet Hall or the Meyer
Study, lloom on Friday nights, deter
mined to avoid any social event which
might tempt them to sin and thus ruin
their lives (i.e. their transcripts) forev
er. These students often become the
disgruntled roommates mentioned
above. With the rare exception, it is vir
tually impossible to change or convert
the behavior patterns of the Dating-Is-
A-Waste-of-Time, I-Must-Study stu
dent.
3. The I-Want-It, I-Just-Can't-Get-It
Student. This characterizes the majori
ty of the undergraduate population,
with the occasional graduate appearing
as well. Since I am a proud member, it is
also my favorite category. A student in
this group is torn between the two
extremes mentioned above. She doesn't

want to lose all of her identity and inde
pendence and become Eternally
Attached, but she also does not think
that dating is a waste of time. This stu
dent does not use Sweet Hall as a way to
avoid social situations, quite the con
trary. She puts herself into a great posi
tion, such as a small class or a party, to
meet somebody. But that is where her
motivation meets a brick wall, because
she does not follow through on her
intentions. This student often meets
and talks to an interesting prospect for
a date in these social situations, but
then lets him or her go before the ulti
mate question is asked. Later she might
say hello, or the very meaningful,
"How's it going?" to this prospect in
White Plaza once or twice. But this
period soon ends and the I-Want-It, I-
Just-Can't-Get-It student now pretends
she's never met the former prospect
when sighted on campus.
If only this student had said those
fateful words, "Wanna get a Frosty
Mint at the Co Ho sometime?" she
would be a much happier and satisfied
individual. She would have proved the
results of my extensive study wrong,
and she would have gained a disgrun
tled roommate and a new futon in the
bargain.

Amanda wishes Mike luck in his quest
for nookie.
