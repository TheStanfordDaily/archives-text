Divestment is an important part of attack on corporations

THE LETTER in yesterday's Daily,
"Divesting from Texaco is not the
most rational option," raises some
very good points, but fails to under
stand the process of divestment, the
results of divestment, and the Universi
ty's stance on investment responsibili
ty.
Talking to Gary Malone, director of
Investment Responsibility at the Stan
ford Management Company, has given
me some insight into the process of
divestment. According to Gary, the pri
mary focus of Stanford's investment
responsibility policy is to make sure
that the companies in the portfolio live
up to the goals and values of the Uni
versity. If a corporation fails to meet
this standard then a thorough process
is taken to change the company
through proxy voting, letters written
the company, and even meetings with
the corporation. If all these steps fail to
change the corporation, then Stanford's

interests are not represented in the
investment and they will divest.
Divestment itself is not a fruitless
venture. The thorough process of
divestment that this University goes
through lends itself to be very respected
in its investment responsibility deci
sions. Also being a prestigious universi
ty adds to the strength of its moral ges
tures. Stanford serves as a strong
model for other universities and insti
tutions concerning investment respon
sibility, and thus can reasonably set a
tide of investment scrutiny and action
among other universities and institu
tions nationwide. The selling of stocks
on moral objections is exactly the mes
sage we want to send to other institu
tions who may follow the same suit.
The $6 million that the University
would divest is a small piece for both
Texaco and for our astronomical
endowment fund, but the action is a
symbolic gesture refuting the economic

paradigm that is accepting profits at
any cost.
Divestment is not the only way to
change Texaco's or Unocal's environ
mental and human abuses, but it is an
important part of the attack. Private
institutions such as the Interfaith
Council on Corporate Responsibility
will continue to fight for shareholder
resolutions, groups such as the Burma
Foundation will continue to organize
local boycotts of corporations, and the
Sierra Club and Rain Forest Action
Network will continue their national
boycott campaigns. These are all aimed
at reforming corporations. An action by
a university such as Stanford to divest
from a environmentally unsound corpo
ration could be the fuel for a national
campaign, similar to the divestment
that went on in South Africa in the late
1980s. This would just be another facet
of the attack on corporations to hold
them responsible for their actions and

policies, but it could be the crucial part.
The national campaigns have many
of the fronts covered, but they are
largely lacking the student energy that
has been present in so many past social
reform movements. It is time that we,
the students, tell the world that we will
not stand for profits to be made at the
cost of human rights and the environ
ment.
I am sure many people told the stu
dents who fought for divestment from
South Africa that it was not in the "fea
sible set" that their efforts would create
a tide of national action, but it hap
pened nonetheless. We must not forget
the power and vision that we have as
students. We must rise to the occasion
in the face of opposition and take our
stand.
