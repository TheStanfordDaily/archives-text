# Band member was misquoted, reputation of Rerun was soiled
## 
### 
I have carried around the burden of
soil upon my reputation for nearly a
full year and I can bear it no longer.
Our band was misquoted by one of
your writers. We agreed to grant an
interview of our '70s-polyester-fiesta
band for Intermission's "Battle of the
Bands" article last year. Surprisingly
enough, in a competition for the best
original band on campus we suffered a
rather pitiful, ignominious defeat. We
later realized the organizers meant
original "music," which over time and
several pots of fondue, eventually
quelled our intense sense of shame and
mourning, since we pride ourselves on
our originality. After months of drug

rehab and experimental "macrame"
therapy we are back to the point where
we can convincingly drone in unison "I
am RERUN, one of the most original
unoriginal bands to date."
As if the trauma of having our band's
collective fat face shoved by the scuff of
the neck into the foul smell of grunge
during the Battle wasn't enough, the
Intermission interviewer misquoted
Dave "Fierce" Hannigan's one word
description of the band. The interviewer
quoted "Handles" Hannigan as having
said "funkalicious" in describing the
band's sound (and hair after gigs);
whereas, he really said "funkaluscious."
As your lawyers will quickly tell you,
permission must be granted for all
quotes of speech. "Ham" has informed
me, between intermittent slobbering,
maudlin sobs that he specifically repeat
ed the word at least three times to avoid
misquotationization.

It is bad enough that Rerun, aka
Freddy Stubbs, our mentor and icon of
the popular '70s vices of overeating,
and dancing, has threatened his life
several times due to sad thwarted
attempts at regathering his former
"What's Happenin' " demi-god status.
If he were to discover that now a band
glorifying his name had sunk to defin
ing themselves *ith a cliche, "funkili
cious," it would drive him to perform
more self-demeaning circus monkey
tricks like appearing in various cameo
medic sitcoms and rap videos. More
over, it defies everything that is '70s,
the most unclich6 time in the history of
civilization.
About the lawyer matter, if you will
but print our humble plea, we'll call it
even.
