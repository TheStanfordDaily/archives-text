The Daily is an extremely careless
newspaper. In yesterday's front page
article about the Portuguese program, I
was misquoted. Actually, "misquoted"
may not be the right word, since to my
knowledge I have never been interviewed
by The Daily for this or any other story.
The quote obviously came from Sylvia
Wohlmut, the administrator of the Span
ish and Portuguese Department, but the
writer of the article was apparently
unaware of who he had spoken to, looked
in the Stanford Directory for
"Wohlmut," and picked the wrong one! If
this is what goes on in The Daily's staff
offices, I challenge the newspaper to
defend its alleged journalistic integrity.
