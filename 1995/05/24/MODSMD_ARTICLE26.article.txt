# Bridge team wins nationals
## Four grad students earn card-playing title in Memphis 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
Drawing on a combination of skill and mental
toughness, four Stanford graduate students won
the National Collegiate Bridge Championship in
Memphis, Tenn., last weekend.
The Stanford team — composed of Joel Singer,
Scott Benson, Steve Altus and Bert Hackney —
beat out the team from the University of Penn
sylvania in the final round, 77 points to 50 points,
to capture Stanford's first-ever national title.
There were seven teams present at the competi
tion, including Harvard University, the Universi
ty of Illinois and the University of Texas at
Austin.
Altus, the team captain, said the team did not
have a specific strategy or game plan for the com
petition but rather "concentrated on what's going
on at the moment and not being distracted by past
mistakes."
Altus said he was particularly pleased with the
team's performance in the second qualifying
round.
"After the first session, we weren't in particu
larly great shape but in the second round we real
ly showed our mental toughness and played well,"
he said. The team was 5-1 in the first two rounds,
thereby earning a spot in the finals.
Altus added that while Stanford's team may
not have been the best team at the competition,
they played the best. "I don't think our team
could have played any better," he said.
While Stanford has entered a team in the

national competition for the last four or five
years, the team has never won a national title.
However, two years ago the team placed second,
Altus said.
Altus, who was on the team two years ago, said
he was pleased to see how much the quality of
play has improved since then. He also noted that
the number of schools involved in the tournament
has increased. "It's nice to see bridge making a
comeback. It's nice that people see that it's not
just a game that older people play," Altus said.
While the team did not win any financial
rewards for capturing the title, they did earn
some nice perks — including a free trip to Mem
phis, complete with a visit to Graceland.
The Stanford team captured the regional title
in February, thereby advancing to the national
tournament in Memphis. Although the four men
certainly did not expect to win the national title,
they thought they had a "reasonable chance,"
Benson said.
"I thought we had a decent chance at winning,"
agreed Altus. "I didn't think we were the favorites
but I knew we could win if we played well."
The four men are members of the Stanford
Bridge Club, which meets every Tuesday night in
Terman Engineering Center. About 25 people of
all different levels attend those meetings, Altus
said.
Altus said that while the four men don't nor
mally play bridge together, they have all been
playing and competing separately for years. Altus
has played bridge since he was 12, for example,
while Benson took up the game in 1988.
