## First the tide rushes in... The
						Bug tells us why ocean waves always roll into shore

Q:Why do waves always come in towards the
shore? Is there somewhere in the middle of
the ocean where all the water is leaving?
â€” endless summer
A: So, spring has finally arrived. The sun is
shining again, the Foothills are green and
people are asking warm-weather science
questions.
Now, if you spend your next lazy afternoon out
by our local watering hole, Lake Lag, you may
notice small waves traveling across the surface.
These small waves are due to the wind dragging
the water.
As the wind blows across the lake, it tries to
pull the water along the surface with it. However,
the water can't travel that fast (it's being held
back by the water under it) so it rises up instead.
But once it rises too high, gravity takes over and
pulls it back down. The water that was on top of
the wave now goes under the surface.

So the water at the top of the wave isn't just
cruising along. At each point, the water is really
moving in a circle, going forward on the surface
and backwards underneath. Yet the overall
motion ends up looking like a wave traveling for
ward.
You may notice this in the ocean, if you swim
out past the point where the waves are breaking.
Here the water will bob you up and down, but
doesn't really push you anywhere.
But once this wave nears the shore, things get
trickier. The water starts to drag against the
ocean floor, so the base of the wave gets slowed
down. The top keeps on moving, however, and the
wave begins to break.
This actually occurs at a specific condition,
when the depth of the water is 1 1/3 times the
height of the wave. So bigger waves will break fur
ther out.
This is one of the ingredients in good surfing.
If you have a flat bottom, at the correct depth for
the waves coming in, you get long stretches of
breaking waves.
In addition, the deeper the water, the faster
the wave will move, so the underwater geography
has a significant effect on the motion of a wave.
Most of the waves that hit the shore are the
result of small waves that start in the middle of
the ocean. Even these small waves get amplified
as they hit the shore.
However, tidal waves occur as a result of seis
mic disturbances on the ocean floor, such as an
earthquake or volcano. Although these waves
may only be a foot high, they extend for hundreds
of miles. Thus the total mass of water that is mov
ing is tremendous. All this energy is then convert
ed into a gigantic wave when it reaches the shore.
So the waves you see are really the result of the
ocean bottom disrupting the up and down motion
of the water. There's actually not much water
"coming" from anywhere. Only at the end, when
it hits the shore, does the water start to move for
ward.
