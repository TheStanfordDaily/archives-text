# SLAC scientists search for 'exotic' find
## Elusive millicharged particles may give clues to universe's dark matter

In the world of high-energy
physics, small particles command a
great deal of respect. Soon the bound
aries of what is considered a small
particle may be pushed even further.
A team of atomic physicists headed
by John Jaros of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) is con
ducting a rather odd search for a par
ticle Jaros describes as "exotic," exist
ing in theory only. They are hunting
for what is referred to as a "mil
licharged particle" — a particle of
about the same mass as an electron,
but carrying just a fraction of the
charge.
Millicharged particles are believed
to be formed as debris from the colli
sions of high-energy electrons with
thick slabs of tungsten. When a

high-energy electron hits the
tungsten, light photons are given
off and form into electron
positron pairs.
However, smaller particles are
sometimes given off. In the SLAC
setup, a small detector is placed
behind hundreds of feet of sand
stone, which is used to fdter out
larger particles. The only parti
cles that would arrive at the
detector would be these mil
licharged particles.
Jaros admitted that there is
only a very slim chance of finding
these particles if they exist. How
ever, the implications of their dis
covery are significant enough to
warrant the investigation.
Millicharged particles may be a
clue to the universe's "dark mat
ter" — the invisible matter that
shows up as gravitational effects
on the rest of the universe but has
so far not been tracked down. The
gravity of dark matter helps form
our own universe. "All the matter
of the universe may not be in par
ticles we know about," explained
Jaros.
In 1986, University of Toronto
physicist Bob Holdom proposed
that if the universes of regular
matter and dark matter came into

contact, some charge could "rub off."
This fractional amount of excess
charge would show up as the mil
licharged particles that are being
hunted at SLAC.
But exactly how small an amount
of charge can a millicharged particle
have? Particles with a charge greater
than a thousandth of an electron's
can be ruled out since they would
have been detected in earlier experi
ments. Similarly, particles with
charge smaller than a millionth of an
electron's aren't candidates since
they would be easily identifiable in
astrophysical experiments. So, the
millicharged particles must contain
between a millionth and a thousandth
of the charge of an electron. This is
the window that the SLAC experi
ment is designed to explore.
The exact amount of charge on the

particle is important for a simple rea
son — charge quantization. That is, it
is not currently understood why
charge comes in certain set quanti
ties. For example, the recently veri
fied top quark and other quarks —
which compose the basic particles of
electrons and protons — come with
charges in thirds of that of an elec
tron. Discovering the existence of the
millicharged particles could lead to a
reformulation of the theory of
charges. The millicharged particle
would then become a more funda
mental particle than the electron or
the quark.
The project is unusual because
unlike most particle physics experi
ments that look for high energy
deposits, the millicharged particles
involve very small quantities of ener
gy. Whereas the average experiment

necessitates looking for energies of a
100 million electron volts (MeV),
Jaros' experiment only produces
about 5 eV. In fact, if a millicharged
particle were to hit the detector, only
a single photon or light particle would
be released.
The project itself is relatively
small compared to most other
research undertaken at SLAC. How
ever, the modest price tag of
$250,000, coupled with the fact that
the search for millicharged particles
would not interfere with SLAC's nor
mal production of other particles,
made the experiment a must. So far,
Jaros and his colleagues have been
collecting the data from several runs
of the experiment. A full report on
the existence of the elusive mil
licharged particles is due out this
summer.
