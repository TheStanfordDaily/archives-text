# Earth Systems major renewed for 8 years
## 
### Heather Knight Contributing writer 
After just three years of exis
tence, the Earth Systems Program
has proven its worth, as the Facul
ty Senate last week renewed the
program for an unprecedented
eight years.
"This is the first interdiscipli
nary program ever to be recom
mended for renewal for eight years.
It's like getting an A-plus," said
Geophysics and Biological Sciences
Prof. Jonathan Roughgarden, the
program's director. The normal ap
proval length for interdisciplinary
programs is three to five years, ac
cording to Justin Hayes, academic
coordinator of Earth Systems.
Originally approved by the Fac
ulty Senate in 1992, the Earth Sys
tems Program currently contains
107 declared undergraduates and
12 coterminal masters students.
Hayes called this a "great number"
considering the program's relative
ly recent inception. Nineteen stu
dents have already graduated with
degrees in Earth Systems.
Earth Systems is Stanford's

"first broadly based undergraduate
major in environmental studies,"
according to the program's publici
ty brochure. It is taught jointly by
faculty from the schools of Earth
Sciences, Engineering, and Hu
manities and Sciences, with contri
butions from professors in the Law
School and the Graduate School of
Business.
"The Faculty Senate saw us as
being a serious program that is fill
ing a niche at the University that
had never been filled before,"
Hayes said. He said this "niche" is a
"serious science-based environ
mental program."
"This is telling of the strength of
the Earth Systems Program that
[the Faculty Senate is] willing to
take such a chance on us," Hayes
said.
Rigorous major requirements
are evidence of the program's seri
ousness and depth, according to
Hayes. Students must take courses
in biology, chemistry, geological
and environmental sciences, math
ematics, statistics, physics, eco-
nomics and computer program
ming, as well as classes within
Earth Systems.
The lengthy renewal relieves a
burden since program adminis
trators have been working on the
proposal since the beginning of
the year, according to Hayes. He
said if the program was only
renewed for the typical three
years, the administrators would
have to devote two out of every
nine quarters to writing propos
als.
Hayes praised the renewal in
light of the University's ongoing
budgetary concerns. "I think it's
great," he said. "This is a visible
demonstration of the Universi
ty's commitment to solid scientif
ic study. They are behind us 100

percent.
The renewal process began
last fall, when program faculty
and administrators commenced
work on a report about the pro
gram, Roughgarden said. He
added that the report contained
student and faculty input, which
was "very positive."
Then, an inter-school commit
tee commissioned by the dean of
the School of Earth Sciences eval
uated the program, Hayes said.
This committee passed its recom
mendation on to the Faculty Sen
ate's Committees on Undergradu
ate Studies and Graduate Studies.
The senate looked at the reviews
and made the final approval,
according to Roughgarden.
Roughgarden said that both of
the senate's committees com
mented on the program's "rigor,"
as did the chairs of several
departments including eco
nomics, geology and biology.
