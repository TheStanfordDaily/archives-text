After just three years of exis
tence, the Earth Systems Program
has proven its worth, as the Facul
ty Senate last week renewed the
program for an unprecedented
eight years.
"This is the first interdiscipli
nary program ever to be recom
mended for renewal for eight years.
It's like getting an A-plus," said
Geophysics and Biological Sciences
Prof. Jonathan Roughgarden, the
program's director. The normal ap
proval length for interdisciplinary
programs is three to five years, ac
cording to Justin Hayes, academic
coordinator of Earth Systems.
Originally approved by the Fac
ulty Senate in 1992, the Earth Sys
tems Program currently contains
107 declared undergraduates and
12 coterminal masters students.
Hayes called this a "great number"
considering the program's relative
ly recent inception. Nineteen stu
dents have already graduated with
degrees in Earth Systems.
Earth Systems is Stanford's

"first broadly based undergraduate
major in environmental studies,"
according to the program's publici
ty brochure. It is taught jointly by
faculty from the schools of Earth
Sciences, Engineering, and Hu
manities and Sciences, with contri
butions from professors in the Law
School and the Graduate School of
Business.
"The Faculty Senate saw us as
being a serious program that is fill
ing a niche at the University that
had never been filled before,"
Hayes said. He said this "niche" is a
"serious science-based environ
mental program."
"This is telling of the strength of
the Earth Systems Program that
[the Faculty Senate is] willing to
take such a chance on us," Hayes
said.
Rigorous major requirements
are evidence of the program's seri
ousness and depth, according to
Hayes. Students must take courses
in biology, chemistry, geological
and environmental sciences, math
ematics, statistics, physics, eco-
