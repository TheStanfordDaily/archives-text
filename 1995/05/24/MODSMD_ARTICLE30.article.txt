# Scientific communication
## Several recognized programs train scientists in the art of writing effectively 
### Stacey Harp Contributing writer 
It has never been a secret that
there is a lack of good writers in the
science community. While many sci
entists do brilliant experiments, they
may have trouble communicating the
importance of their discoveries to the
public.
Explaining their work to non-sci
entists remains important, however,
in that obtaining many research
grants depends on the opinion of peo
ple who may not be familiar with the
area the scientist is studying. For
those with an interdisciplinary inter
est in both science and the English
language, science writing is becoming
both an accessible and important pro
fessional option.
Science writers write for newspa
pers, scientific journals, popular sci
ence magazines and public relations
offices. Science writers at Stanford
write stories for the Stanford
Medicine magazine, Campus Report
and this publication. In addition,
some work for science museums such
as the Exploratorium in San Francis
co; for National Public Radio; and in
television as writers for new pro
grams, documentaries and education
al programming.
As a discipline, science writing is
not a new field. There have long been
journalism schools that have science
writers as members of the faculty and
offer courses for students interested
in specializing in writing about sci
ence. The Communication Depart
ment at Stanford is set up this way
and turns out successful science writ
ers every year.
In the past 15 years, however, a
new breed of graduate program has
emerged. There are now as many as
18 programs in the United States

devoted entirely to the study of sci
ence writing or science journalism,
according to a new book titled The
New Science Journalists, edited by
Ted Anton and Rick McCourt and
published by Ballantine Books.
Of the existing graduate programs
in science writing, the four widely con
sidered the best are the Science Jour
nalism program at Boston University,
the Writing About Science program in
the Writing Seminars department at
Johns Hopkins University, the Sci
ence and Environmental Reporting
program at New York University and
the Science Communication program
at the University of California at
Santa Cruz. Each of these programs
differs substantially from the others
in an number of ways.
All of these programs are highly
selective. The number of students
admitted each year ranges from five
at Johns Hopkins to 15 at NYU. The
entrance requirements, however, dif
fer markedly. While UCSC requires
that its applicants have at least an
undergraduate degree in science,
many of the students have advanced
degrees. NYU prefers that its appli
cants have an undergraduate degree
in natural science while the program
at Boston University routinely
accepts two or three students with no
science background.
Each program has directors with
different backgrounds and philoso
phies. The programs at UCSC and
BU both have very "hands-on" direc
tors. They view their roles as mentors
of their students and help them as
much as possible from class assign
ments to finding a job.
Barbara Cullition, director of the
program at John Hopkins, has a dif
ferent attitude. She is the editor of
Nature Genetics and Nature
Medicine, both highly respected sci

entific journals. Her editorial duties
afford her little time on campus, so
her students work with a high degree
of independence.
Another major difference in the
programs is the degree of structure.
The programs at NYU and UCSC are
highly structured with a set schedule
of classes. The program at Hopkins is
far more flexible and has few require
ments, giving each student the oppor
tunity to tailor the program to his or
her desires. The program at BU falls
between these two extremes. There
are a number of required classes, but
also some electives.
UCSC, NYU and BU all require
students to take an internship as part
of their training. While this is not a
requirement at Johns Hopkins, many
students opt to do an internship for
the experience.
While NYU, BU and Johns Hop
kins all offer a master's degree, Johns
Hopkins is the only one to require a
master's thesis, started during the
second semester and polished for pos
sible publication by the end of the
program at the end of the semester.
UCSC offers a certificate rather
than a master's degree. However, the
program is no less rigorous than a
master's program and the training is
highly respected within the science
writing community.
The programs also differ markedly
in terms of facilities. NYU and BU are
both large universities and their sci
ence writing programs are contained
within larger journalism or communi
cation schools. As a result, they are
able to offer classes such as Television
Reporting, Broadcast Journalism and
Documentary Eilm-making.
UCSC and Johns Hopkins are
more limited in resources and
required classes consist mainly of
classes in different writing styles and

editing. UCSC, for instance, requires
writing classes in reporting and news
writing, writing feature articles and
writing personal opinion.
Today's science writers come
mainly from one of two backgrounds.
Some complete programs like those
mentioned above and others have a
background in English and journal
ism but have acquired an interest in
science. While the graduate science
writing programs have been highly
successful in placing their graduates,
they draw criticism from some profes
sional science writers who followed
the other path.
Natalie Angier, a science writer for
the New York Times, who has a mas
ter's degree in medieval literature,
told The New Science Journalists
that "As a literature major, I have a
broader perspective than the scien
tists I cover." Even more critical is a
quote from Charlie Petit, a science
writer for the San Francisco Chroni
cle, who said, "I don't think these
graduates know what a news story
is."
Despite the criticism, many stu
dents and graduates have nothing but
praise for their programs and have
landed jobs that clearly indicate that
employers believe in the value of
these programs.
The most common comment on
these programs is that they
shouldn't be taken up on a whim.
The writing assignments are
demanding and the editing sessions
grueling, but, said Barbara Moran,
a student at BU, "I honestly think
it's worth it. Before I came here, I
was on unemployment after losing
my job in California. This summer,
I'll be working for the Discovery
Channel in an internship that will
probably become a job after I gradu
ate."
