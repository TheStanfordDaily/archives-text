# ASSU passes $350,000 budget
## Document includes $60K in new spending, 2 new projects 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
In its final meeting of the year,
the ASSU Senate last night
unanimously approved a budget
of more than $350,000 and elect
ed to continue its current policy
of using a sweatshirt as its uni
form.
In what ASSU Financial Man
ager Gabe Lucas called "the most
important vote [the senate] will
take," senators approved a bud
get increase of almost $60,000,
the result of increased income.
"We're budgeting to spend
more and we're budgeting to
make more," Lucas said. "We feel
we can operate a business."
An amendment created by a
slew of senators cut $3,500 from
the original proposed increase for
next year, mainly from salaries
and reserve accounts. The salary
of the deputy senate chair, origi
nally created for the coming fiscal
year at $1,000, was reduced to
$500 due to discontent among

many senators expressed before
the meeting.
In addition, the senate will
have two new business projects
next year, the brainchild of next
year's Financial Manager John
Hall. A student picture book will
be created, projected to gain
$5,000. Also, the Students' Asso
ciation, which, Lucas said, will
purchase bulk passes to local
attractions and sell them to stu
dents, should net $3,000.
Overall, the amount of indi
rect costs earned from business
projects is projected to increase
by 124 percent next year.
In other senate action:
• It took four unsuccessful
motions and more than 45 min
utes, but the senate decided to
retain its sweatshirt uniform for
next year. However, instead of
the words "I'm an ASSU Senator
silly" on the back, it will read
simply: "ASSU Senator."
Senators attempted to change
the uniform to: a T-shirt, a choice
between a sweatshirt or a T

shirt, a collared shirt and a rugby
shirt.
"The point of having a uni
form is to have a single way for
students to identify ASSU sena
tors," said Deputy Senate Chair
Michael Choo. "When Istudents]
see a sweatshirt in red writing,
students think 'senator.' "
• Choo announced that Diana
Conklin, manager of undergradu
ate residential facilities, in
response to his and other senate
affiliates' campus safety report,
agreed to install a campus phone,
to be termed a "visitor phone," in
every dorm. While the original
decision was to install the phones
when residences were renovated
as a part of the University's 10-
year Capital Improvement Plan,
Choo said Conklin has promised
the phones will be in place by
October.
• The senate approved next
year's senate committees, which
were nominated by Nominations
Commission Chair Susie
Thomas.
