## Stanford's sixth title? Women's golf chases crown 
### John Lawson Staff writer 
The moment has arrived for the Stanford
women's golf team.
All the time spent at the driving range and the
chipping green, every shot taken at the preceding
eleven tournaments this school year, and all the
words of wisdom that coaches and fellow players
have spoken has led the No. 2 Cardinal to four
days at the end of May — four days to try and
bring the first ever NCAA Women's Golf Champi
onship to the Farm.
Today through Saturday at the Landfall Golf
Club in Wilmington, N.C., 22 teams will compete for
the title of NCAA champion. These teams earned
their way to Wilmington by placing in the top 11 in
either the Eastern or Western Regionals, which were
held two weeks ago. Every team ranked in the top 10
by Golf World magazine will be in attendance.
Stanford received an invitation by placing a
strong third in the Western Regionals in Tucson,
Ariz., behind co-winners No. 1 Arizona State and
No. 3 San Jose State. After a dreadful first round
in which the team shot 14 over on the back nine
and finished in a tie for ninth, the Cardinal
rebounded by shooting five over par during the
last two rounds, outdistancing Oregon by 15
strokes for third. This stirring performance was
just what head coach Tim Baldwin had been wait
ing to see from his team.
"If you throw out those disastrous nine holes,"
Baldwin said, "we would've won the tournament.
We showed a great deal of fortitude in fighting
back. Those two rounds showed that when we
play our game, we can play with (and beat) any
one, including Arizona State."
The two-time defending national champion
Sun Devils had looked invincible before the
regionals, winning every tournament in which
they played. Some were won by huge margins,
such as 33 strokes at both the Pacific 10 Champi
onships and their own Sun Devil Invitational.
Back in February, they romped through the Ari
zona Invitational, running away with a 48-stroke
victory.
