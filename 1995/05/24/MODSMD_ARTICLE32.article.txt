## Stanford's sixth title? Women's golf chases crown 
### John Lawson Staff writer 
The moment has arrived for the Stanford
women's golf team.
All the time spent at the driving range and the
chipping green, every shot taken at the preceding
eleven tournaments this school year, and all the
words of wisdom that coaches and fellow players
have spoken has led the No. 2 Cardinal to four
days at the end of May — four days to try and
bring the first ever NCAA Women's Golf Champi
onship to the Farm.
Today through Saturday at the Landfall Golf
Club in Wilmington, N.C., 22 teams will compete for
the title of NCAA champion. These teams earned
their way to Wilmington by placing in the top 11 in
either the Eastern or Western Regionals, which were
held two weeks ago. Every team ranked in the top 10
by Golf World magazine will be in attendance.
Stanford received an invitation by placing a
strong third in the Western Regionals in Tucson,
Ariz., behind co-winners No. 1 Arizona State and
No. 3 San Jose State. After a dreadful first round
in which the team shot 14 over on the back nine
and finished in a tie for ninth, the Cardinal
rebounded by shooting five over par during the
last two rounds, outdistancing Oregon by 15
strokes for third. This stirring performance was
just what head coach Tim Baldwin had been wait
ing to see from his team.
"If you throw out those disastrous nine holes,"
Baldwin said, "we would've won the tournament.
We showed a great deal of fortitude in fighting
back. Those two rounds showed that when we
play our game, we can play with (and beat) any
one, including Arizona State."
The two-time defending national champion
Sun Devils had looked invincible before the
regionals, winning every tournament in which
they played. Some were won by huge margins,
such as 33 strokes at both the Pacific 10 Champi
onships and their own Sun Devil Invitational.
Back in February, they romped through the Ari
zona Invitational, running away with a 48-stroke
victory.

Junior Cale Carter has learned to deal with the rigors of both the diamond and the class
room in his three years at Stanford.
"Arizona State has tremendous
talent, including the best player to
come along in college in a while —
[defending NCAA individual
championl Wendy Ward," said
sophomore Mhairi McKay, herself
an Ail-American last year and a
first-team All-Pac-10 selection
this year. "But, as I've said all sea
son, they are not unbeatable, and
I think both us and San Jose State
proved that at regionals."
The Cardinal and the Spartans
have played hot potato with the
No. 2 ranking this year, each
team holding it twice. When Ari
zona State did not attend the Cal
ifornia Collegiate in April, the two
teams had their best shot all sea
son at a tournament victory, but
neither could rid itself of the
other, and the result was a first
place tie.
"As the rankings suggest, Ari
zona State, San Jose State and
ourselves are the best teams out
there," Baldwin said. "I would be
surprised if any other team made
a serious threat at the title. Then
again, you never know what can
happen at the NCAAs."
Last year, Stanford was seeded
third, but finished a disappoint
ing seventh, highlighted solely by
McKay's lOth-place performance.
The Cardinal returns to the
NCAAs this year as a wiser bunch
that has been together now for
two years and has garnered the
highest ranking of any Farm
squad in history.
But the satisfaction of an
impressive regular season won't
be enough for the Cardinal.
"We know that we have the
golfers to play with anyone,"
McKay said. "We just have to
prove it when the game is on the
line."
Teeing it up for Stanford will
be McKay and fellow sophomore
Andrea Baxter, junior Vicky Stra
da and seniors Jamille Jose and
Amy Lawrence.
