# Making the grade, on and off the field
## Left fielder Cale Carter has found a balance between baseball and books 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The generic balancing act
between athletics and academics
has been a reality in the life of
Cale Carter.
For this junior left fielder on
the Stanford baseball squad, how
ever, balancing both aspects has
been like going to the gym. Work
ing with the weight on his shoul
ders has only made him stronger.
The Cardinal baseball team
will start regional playoff compe
tition on Friday in Wichita, Kan.,
and there is little doubt that the
team would be crippled without
the presence of Carter in the
starting lineup. A three-year
starter for the perennially out
standing Stanford squad, Carter
has not only become a contribut
ing member of a nationally
ranked team but has also devel
oped into an fabulous individual
talent.
Carter's father was the cata
lyst that started him playing T
ball at the age of five. "My dad has
always been a big influence in my
life," Carter said. "He was my
coach all the way up until high
school when he couldn't coach
anymore. I don't know what he
enjoyed more, watching me from
the stands or coaching me."
Orange, Calif., is Carter's
home, and the 5-10, 180-pound
switch hitter attended athletic
powerhouse Mater Dei high
school. Carter participated in that
tradition as he ran sprints in
track and also played baseball for
four years. Carter was a two
sport academic with a one-sport

love.
"Baseball has always been my
number one sport," Carter said.
"It never was too difficult to jug
gle the sports, and the coaches
were pretty lenient and under
standing."
He started his high school
baseball tenure behind the plate
as his squad needed a catcher. By
the time his junior year rolled
around the squad needed some
one in the outfield and Carter
began consistently playing in the
position he would keep through
his three seasons at Stanford.
"I like the outfield," Carter
said of his regular defensive spot
on the diamond. "It's a little bit
more relaxing. You are in every
pitch, and I think it can be drain
ing to go day in and day out work
ing with the ball [in the infield]."
Carter was a hot prospect com
ing out of high school. He was
rated by USA Today as one of the
top 25 prep players in the nation
and was a member of the 1991
Junior National Team. He also
played on the 1991 USA Goodwill
Games team and for the West
team at the 1991 U.S. Olympic
Festival.

College or the pros?
But his biggest honor came
when he was courted and finally
drafted by the Cleveland Indians
in the 17th round of the
league draft.
"It was a big treat," Carter
said. "It's something that you
always dream about."
