# Making the grade, on and off the field
## Left fielder Cale Carter has found a balance between baseball and books 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The generic balancing act
between athletics and academics
has been a reality in the life of
Cale Carter.
For this junior left fielder on
the Stanford baseball squad, how
ever, balancing both aspects has
been like going to the gym. Work
ing with the weight on his shoul
ders has only made him stronger.
The Cardinal baseball team
will start regional playoff compe
tition on Friday in Wichita, Kan.,
and there is little doubt that the
team would be crippled without
the presence of Carter in the
starting lineup. A three-year
starter for the perennially out
standing Stanford squad, Carter
has not only become a contribut
ing member of a nationally
ranked team but has also devel
oped into an fabulous individual
talent.
Carter's father was the cata
lyst that started him playing T
ball at the age of five. "My dad has
always been a big influence in my
life," Carter said. "He was my
coach all the way up until high
school when he couldn't coach
anymore. I don't know what he
enjoyed more, watching me from
the stands or coaching me."
Orange, Calif., is Carter's
home, and the 5-10, 180-pound
switch hitter attended athletic
powerhouse Mater Dei high
school. Carter participated in that
tradition as he ran sprints in
track and also played baseball for
four years. Carter was a two
sport academic with a one-sport

love.
"Baseball has always been my
number one sport," Carter said.
"It never was too difficult to jug
gle the sports, and the coaches
were pretty lenient and under
standing."
He started his high school
baseball tenure behind the plate
as his squad needed a catcher. By
the time his junior year rolled
around the squad needed some
one in the outfield and Carter
began consistently playing in the
position he would keep through
his three seasons at Stanford.
"I like the outfield," Carter
said of his regular defensive spot
on the diamond. "It's a little bit
more relaxing. You are in every
pitch, and I think it can be drain
ing to go day in and day out work
ing with the ball [in the infield]."
Carter was a hot prospect com
ing out of high school. He was
rated by USA Today as one of the
top 25 prep players in the nation
and was a member of the 1991
Junior National Team. He also
played on the 1991 USA Goodwill
Games team and for the West
team at the 1991 U.S. Olympic
Festival.

College or the pros?
But his biggest honor came
when he was courted and finally
drafted by the Cleveland Indians
in the 17th round of the
league draft.
"It was a big treat," Carter
said. "It's something that you
always dream about."
After receiving the call and
speaking with scouts Carter
made his decision on pro ball
right out of high school. "I was
seriously considering it, but I just
wanted to weigh the pros and
cons," Carter said of his decision
to pass up the draft following his
senior year in high school. "I
wanted to come to Stanford badly
and I accomplished that goal.
[Stanford] was such a big thrill, I
didn't want to lose it."
If he had not gotten into Stan
ford, he would have gone straight
into the major league.
Carter loved the idea of being
a Cardinal. "This was the perfect
place for me," he said.
He had wanted to go to Stan
ford since junior high and had
followed the Cardinal baseball
team before their double champi
onship years in 1987 and 1988.
As a student Carter is also a
gem. He compiled a 4.4 GPA in
high school and has continued
that focus on academics at Stan
ford. "I always worked hard in
high school and I am really glad
that it paid off," he said.
But athletics never interfere
with his academic drive and
Carter has been able to juggle the
stress of work on and off the
field.
"It's just something you grow
up with," Carter said of the bal
ancing act. "At times [in high
schooll it was tough when I'd
stay up late because of a game or
ask for an extension because I
was out of town, but the teachers
in general understood that I was
there to learn."
Carter appeared in 50 games
as a freshman and started 36
times. He finished with a .313
average, stole nine bases and col
lected a team high six game-win
ning RBIs. He began his college
career with a 14-game hitting
streak and ended his freshman
season by hitting safely in the
final six games.
His average slumped a bit his
sophomore year (.276) but Carter
developed a more powerful hit
ting arsenal. He more than dou
bled his RBI total from the previ
ous year and hit nine doubles,
one triple and five home runs on
the season. Even with those
impressive numbers, something
was missing in Carter's game.
"I played well but I wasn't

really satisfied with my perfor
mance," Carter said of his first
two seasons on the Farm. "I did
things for the team but I felt that
I could do so much more."
He was the leadoff man as a
freshman and got on base fre
quently. The following season he
developed power and began to hit
the ball harder. This year he was
searching for the synthesis of his
two previous years.
"I was hoping to combine the
two years this season," Carter
said. "I wanted to bring the two
together so I could have a com
plete season. And it's been a won
derful year for me, I can't com
plain."
This wonderful year has seen
him bat .330 (second on the
squad) and collect 36 RBIs while
leading the team with 20 doubles.
"There is no question that
Cale has had his best year here at
Stanford this season," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "He
has combined his average with a
little more power and has come
up with some clutch hits. If it
hasn't been a game winner he
has gotten us in position to win a
game."
And there is more to Carter
than offense. He has been one of
the defensive leaders on a team
that led the nation this season in
fielding percentage.
"On defense he is very under
rated," Marquess said of his left
fielder. "Cale has made some fan
tastic catches and has switched
from center to left field. That's a
tough switch to make."
It has been a very fulfilling
season for Carter, both as an
individual and as a member of a
quality baseball squad.
"You can always do better, but
I think on the whole I've accom
plished what I set out to do this
season," Carter said. "A college
world series appearance and vic
tory would pretty much make it a
storybook season."
Carter entered Stanford
exploring pre-med and many
more of the sciences in his head
as a possible major. He finally
decided on computer science
after dropping medicine and
enjoying his first computer class.
The department has made it easy
for him to juggle his busy athlet
ic and academic schedule.
"Many of the CS classes are
taped, and I've been able to
watch afternoon classes later on
television," Carter said. "Profes
sors have understood my situa
tion â€” I'm going to get the work

done, I just might not have the
time right then to get it done."
Looking toward the future
As one of the top baseball play
ers in one of the top baseball pro
grams in the country, Carter's
future plans are not surprising
nor unrealistic.
"I'd like to play pro ball,"
Carter said. "I've played baseball
all my life, I enjoy it, and I'd like
to do that. I can try that out, but
if things don't work out I have all
the bases covered, so pretty much
whatever the future holds I'll be
ready for."
The Stanford baseball pro
gram and Marquess could like
that future if it means having
Carter back at Sunken Diamond
next season.
"We would love to have him
back," Marquess said. "He knows
how to play the game, and if we
can have him back we would love
it. It will probably depend on
where he goes in the draft and
what kind of offer they make
him. Plus I know he likes school.
But we just want what is best for
Cale."
He has had very little contact
with professional squads because
his father has handled a lot of the
communications. This has
allowed Carter to concentrate
and keep his focus.
"He's done that all his life,"
Carter said. "He loves doing, and
it makes things a lot easier for
me."
While playing pro ball would
be a dream come true for Carter,
it certainly wouldn't be a prob
lem staying at Stanford for his
senior year. If the draft does call
him, Carter's lifetime loyalty to
the L.A. Dodgers makes that
team his top choice in the league.
"But as of now I can't really be
picky," Carter said.
If he returns to Stanford next
year he has set aside specific
goals that he would like to attain.
"I want to continue on the
track I'm on now and keep play
ing solid ball," Carter said. "I also
want to be more of a leader on the
club after a lot of older guys will
be gone."
Marquess would love to utilize
Carter's hitting, fielding, and
leadership abilities next season.
"He's a great leader," Mar
quess said. "Leaders always lead
in different ways. Cale is a quiet
leader, he leads in the way he
practices and plays. He is dedicat
ed and he works hard."
