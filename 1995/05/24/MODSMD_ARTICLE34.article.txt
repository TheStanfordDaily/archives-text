# Free trip to Atlanta
## Being a sportswriter has its benefits 
### 
Last week I discovered that
the life of a sports writer
really is not that bad. My
free five-day trip to Georgia to
cover the Stanford men's tennis
team at the NCAA Champi
onships was highlighted by some
events I thought worth sharing.
The week began as I packed my
news reporter notebooks and
headed out on a midnight plane to
Georgia. First stop Atlanta,
where the red-eye dropped me off
just in time for a day of sightsee
ing before competition began the
next morning.
The first thing any visitor to
Atlanta notices are the five rings
painted everywhere. Everyone
and his mother is a corporate
sponsor of Atlanta 1996.

A visit to the tourist mecca
they call Underground Atlanta
revealed that the only unique
thing Atlanta's version of Fisher
man's Wharf or the South Street
Seaport has to offer is a tour of
the Coca Cola Bottling Company
headquarters. Though at its
worst the tour consists of an
hour-long stroll past displays and
explanations ad nauseam of the
biggest capitalist success story in
history, there are at least a few
redeeming qualities to the tour.
I viewed just about every Coke
television commercial aired since
the last time a Cleveland baseball
team won a pennant, and was
rewarded for my patience when
my of my favorite commercials of
all time — the Coke/hippie ad
where the international choir
sings "I want to buy the world a
Coke" — came on screen. Man
that was a dope commercial.
(Speaking of dope, conspicuously
absent from the tour was even a
perfunctory denial of the accusa
tion that cocaine was part of the
Original Formula.) The best part
of the tour came at the end.
As with the famous Anchor
Steam Brewery tour in San Fran
cisco, participants who complete
the visit are rewarded with free
samples. I was able to help myself
to about 50 different Coca-Cola
products from around the world,
most of which had nothing to do
with cola per se. I loaded up on
about 20 different fruity flavors
of Fanta, including strawberry

(from Brazil, I think). Then I guz
zled five glasses of a honey lemon
soda marketed exclusively in
Japan. I know the flavor sounds
weird, but take it from me, it's
actually quite refreshing.
In the evening I attended a
Braves-Reds game at Fulton
County Stadium. The Braves are
my third favorite team, after the
Mets and Yankees. I've been a
Braves fan since my family first
subscribed to cable in 1986, so
don't even try to call me a front
runner, 'cause I know that's what
some of you were thinking. Atten
dance was pitiful — probably in
the area of 20,000. Minutes
before the game I purchased field
level seats from the box office.
Future Hall of Famer Greg Mad
dux pitched, Ron Gant got a small
ovation every time he came up to
bat for the Reds and, much to my
chagrin, I never got to join in on
the tomahawk chop. The fans
were in much too deep a malaise
to engage in any sort of cheering,
and this led to my early exit after
the seventh-inning stretch.
I was told before my trip that
late-night Atlanta meant Buck
head, a dense square-mile strip
where you need a clicker to count
all the bars. I was not disappointed.
First stop was the Rose and Crown,
which based on the obscene num
ber of yuppies present and drink
ing Bass Ale, must have been affil
iated with the pub of the same
name in Palo Alto. Desiring a new
experience, I traveled to a slew of
Cancun / South Padre Island-type
establishments before finally set
tling on a place called Bar (sic). The
music was loud, the dance floor
was jam-packed, and I was stand
ing ankle deep in spilled beer. Or
maybe it was toilet water. More
likely it was both. After an hour, it
was time to go.
In the morning, I was off on
the 65-mile drive to the Universi
ty of Georgia for an 11 a.m. match
against Duke. I had been to
Athens last year for the women's
tournament, so I knew what to
expect. Henry Feild Stadium is
the jewel of college tennis, a
3,500-seat facility generally
packed with good tennis fans.
After a minor scare in doubles,
the Card defeated the Blue Devils
4-1. After gathering the necessary
quotes from players and coaches,
I checked into the hotel and began
to check out the Athens night life
most famous for its influence on
R.E.M. I traveled straight to the
Uptown Bar, where last year I
met Jack McDowell's younger
brother working the taps, but he
was no where to be found on this
night.
