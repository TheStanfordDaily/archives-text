Women's crew
Stanford's women's crew team will be
making its first trip to the national champi
onships in six years after posting a fabulous
second-place finish at this past weekend's
Pacific 10 Conference Championships.
Only the mighty Washington Huskies
bested the Cardinal's varsity boat. Stanford,
the third-ranked team in the conference,
overcame second-rated Washington State in
the semifinals, avenging an loss in Pullman
in the process.
In addition to the top eight's fantastic fin
ish, the Cardinal's junior varsity and novice
boats did admirably as well. Due to the
team's great overall performance, the com
bined score of both the women's squad and
men's squad (who finished fourth) was good
enough to win second in the overall points
race, again behind only the national power
house Huskies.

Kyle Peterson
The ace of the 1995 edition of the Cardi
nal's staff, Peterson has performed brilliant
ly in his first year at the collegiate level.
Alter being named Six-Pac Pitcher of the
Week a league-high four times this season,
he secured the Six-Pac Co-Pitcher of the
Year award last week and is a strong candi
date for NCAA Freshman of the Year and
All-American honors.
In six shut-out innings on Friday, Peter
son gave up a mere five hits and struck out
eight Santa Barbara Gauchos en route to his
11th win of the year, tying New York Yankee
Jack McDowell's 1985 record for victories by
a Stanford freshman.
On the season, Peterson is 11-1 with a
3.03 ERA, both team-bests. In addition, he
leads the staff in strikeouts (89), complete
games (seven) and innings pitched (115.2). In
light of injuries to the 1-2 punch of Jason
Middlebrook and Dan Reed, Peterson's emer
gence has been a godsend to head coach Mark
Marquess and the rest of the Cardinal squad.
In the extremely competitive Six-Pac, he is
a perfect 8-0 with a 2.30 ERA and six com
plete games in nine starts. Only Reed has
ever recorded as many conference wins for
Stanford in one season as Peterson and the
freshman's 1.000 winning percentage in
league play is the best mark in school histo
ry.
Peterson will attempt to break McDowell's
record on Friday when he gets the nod
against the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Car
dinal's opening-round game of the NCAA
tournament in Wichita, Kan.
