Track and Field Championships
Stanford's bid to host the 1997 World Track and Field Championships was denied Sunday when
the 23-member council of the International Amateur Athletic Federation decided to award the event
to Athens, Greece.
Athens replaces Mexico City, which was awarded the games but withdrew as host when the value
of the peso plummeted.
Stanford's candidacy was hindered because it needed money to refurbish Stanford Stadium for
track and field. The lAAF prefers not to give grants to host sites.
Women's basketball
Head coach Tara VanDerveer and interim head coach Amy Tucker, who will coach while Van-
Derveer's takes control of the U.S. National Team, hired former Stanford standout Angela Taylor as
an assistant coach.
A point guard on the 1990 and '92 title teams, Taylor, 23, has spent the past two seasons coaching
defense as an assistant coach at Texas A&M. In 1993, she was a graduate assistant at Arizona.
Women's basketball U.S. National Team
Of the six former and current Stanford players trying to make the National Team or the collegiate
Jones Cup squad, only three remain after the fourth day of trials.
Former Cardinal stars Molly Goodenbour (*93) and senior Anita Kaplan were cut from the nation
al team. Sophomore Kate Starbird was also denied as she competed for a spot on the World Univer
sity/Jones Cup team.
Ex-Stanford players still competing are guard Jennifer Azzi ('9O), forward Katy Steding ('9O) and
forward/center Val Whiting ('93 >.
National and Olympic Team coach Tara VanDerveer, who officially begins her sabbatical from
Stanford on Oct. 1, was not involved in the cutdown. The teams are chosen by a 13-member Player
Selection Committee.
Kaplan's back problems and Starbird's relative lack of experience were probably factors in the
decisions.
