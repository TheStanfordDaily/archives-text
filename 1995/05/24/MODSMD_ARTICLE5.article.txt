# Branner produces CD-ROM
## Frosh dorm makes multi-media magazine 
### Samuel Park Staff writer 
Gaieties writers beware: you may have
to find a new show-stopping line in place
of the usual "Branner sucks."
The all-frosh residence has made
Stanford history by unveiling the first
dorm-produced CD-ROM. Titled Bran
ner Interactive Multi-media Magazine, it
features short movies, artwork, litera
ture and candid photos.

In the CD-ROM, users can click vari
ous icons and look at pictures of their fel
low Brannerites, or double-click and lis
ten to the freshman across the hall sing a
ballad from "Les Miserables." It is a mix
ture of yearbook and art magazine, fea
turing the talents of various Branner res
idents.

would devote more time to a dorm
project than upperclassmen. In a
large all-frosh dorm at the begin
ning of the year, people are eager
to participate. It's prime breeding
ground for a project like this," said
Resident Assistant Kathy Lip
scomb, who initiated the project.
Lipscomb wanted to display the
talents of Brannerites in action,
caught on video, in a format that
could fit in more information than
most paper magazines. After
recruiting 20 interested freshmen,
the group embarked on the per
ilous mission of making a CD
ROM from scratch.
"Freshmen at the beginning of
the year think they can do any
thing at Stanford, so I didn't have
to convince anyone that we could
do it. They just believed it. Upper
classmen might have more skepti
cism in undertaking a project of
this magnitude," Lipscomb said.
The staff gathered over 800
candid photos of all Branner resi
dents, as well as literary and artis
tic contributions. It caught on
tape anything from Brannerites
on the court to Brannerites on the
stage. Print information was
scanned into a computer, and pro
grammers digitized the videos.
"Our job was to make an appli
cation that allowed you to search
and view everything," said pro

grammer A 1 Lieb, a future Com
puter Science major.
The search includes cross-ref
erence by person and by subject,
with an index for movies, art and
text. For instance, the user could
see all the photos available of one
particular Brannerite or look at all
art stored.
This task served as the major
difficulty for the programmers,
since HyperCard, the program
they used, had difficulty with the
variety of information entered
and the complexity of the tasks to
be performed.
"Our problem is that we were
doing non-standard things. It got
difficult because we were pushing
the envelope and making Hyper
card do things it wasn't designed
to do," Lieb said. "It wasn't a mat
ter of hard-core programming
since HyperCard takes care of a lot
of the nitty-gritty details."
In the final CD-ROM, the user
is able to click on various icons
and travel through the visual and
written data, so he can read a
poem one minute and look at his
neighbors' pictures the next.
"One cool thing is that we have
a photo album feature where you
load into an album all the pictures
that are meaningful to you, and
the next time you click on the
album icon you see a list of all the
photos you saved," Lipscomb said.
"That's one of the things I just
ran by Al, and then the next day
he's like, 'The photo album is

The staff borrowed equipment
from Meyer Media Center and
wisdom from Charles Kerns,
director of the Curriculum Devel
opment Lab. Kerns, who alerted
Lipscomb to the fact that "no one
had done this before," agreed to
coach the BIMM staff and eventu
ally found a CD-ROM company
which agreed to make over 200
copies of the finished CD-ROM.
Each Brannerite will receive a free
copy.
Though this is an unusual pro
ject, Lipscomb said it is possible as
long as the manpower and money
are there. The replication costs to
make copies of the original CD can
run as high as $900, making the
total costs about $1100.
"It's feasible if you have a core
group of people willing to put in
the time," Lipscomb said. "You'd
probably need a dorm the size of
Branner in order to draw people
from a large enough pool."
Though the CD-ROM idea
seems like the forum to showcase
resident life, Lipscomb said she
does not think the idea will catch
on.
"If they saw how much time
was put into it, they would be
scared. I would be hesitant," she
said. Lipscomb confessed that at
the beginning of the project she
only had a vague idea of the kind
of time such a project would con
sume.
"Somebody should try it. Obvi
ously, it can be done," Lipscomb
added.
