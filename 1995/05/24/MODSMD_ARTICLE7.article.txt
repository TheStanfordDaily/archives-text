# Casper urges ASSU to fight Congress' aid cuts
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper ex
horted the ASSU Senate last night to vigor
ously fight Congress to prevent federal fi
nancial aid cuts which, he said, would have a
"devastating effect" on Stanford.
In his second address this year to the sen
ate — which was meeting for its last time —
Casper described the current congressional
debate about cutting its trillion-dollar bud
get.
"The potential impact on Stanford would
be in the millions of dollars," said Casper,
who, in previous months, has spent many
hours in Washington."The Congress at pre
sent, when we talk and express our concern,
has a tendency for the [committee] chairs to
say, 'Well, ifyou don't want this cut, what do
you propose to cut?' "
The two items which most directly affect
University funds, Casper said, are "defense"
and "non-defense" discretionary funds.
The House of Representatives and the
Senate, which currently are conducting sep
arate budget debates, have considered cut
ting 11 percent of the budget's non-defense
discretionary funds — $30 million — and
leaving its defense discretionary funds un
changed. Overall, lawmakers project a $400
billion budget increase between the 1996
and 2002 fiscal years, he said. But those fig
ures, he cautioned, are not adjusted for in
flation.
"The cumulative impact can be devastat

ing on us," he said. "Nobody worries about
the cumulative impact because each (mem
ber of Congress) has [his or her] individual

committee."
Casper said the only
way for students to truly
effect change is through
verbal and written
protests to their represen
tatives. He emphasized
that persistent complaints
by a university president
will not necessarily change
congressional opinion. In

the end, the members of Congress will make
their own choices.
"I can go and I can deliver my message
and make it very clear to them. When it fi
nally comes to the committee behind closed
doors, what they will decide and how they
will try to accomplish the budget reduction
is impossible for any of us to know,"he said.
"The single most important thing you in
this room and the other Stanford students
can do is to write your home members of
Congress, especially if they belong to the
majority. Get your parents and others to
write. I urge you to do that and that is the
way you can be most effective," Casper
added.
Casper and other members of the admin
istration also discussed recent University
policies which have encountered student
criticism. Under questioning from current
