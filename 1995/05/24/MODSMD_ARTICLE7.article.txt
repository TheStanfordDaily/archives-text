# Casper urges ASSU to fight Congress' aid cuts
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper ex
horted the ASSU Senate last night to vigor
ously fight Congress to prevent federal fi
nancial aid cuts which, he said, would have a
"devastating effect" on Stanford.
In his second address this year to the sen
ate — which was meeting for its last time —
Casper described the current congressional
debate about cutting its trillion-dollar bud
get.
"The potential impact on Stanford would
be in the millions of dollars," said Casper,
who, in previous months, has spent many
hours in Washington."The Congress at pre
sent, when we talk and express our concern,
has a tendency for the [committee] chairs to
say, 'Well, ifyou don't want this cut, what do
you propose to cut?' "
The two items which most directly affect
University funds, Casper said, are "defense"
and "non-defense" discretionary funds.
The House of Representatives and the
Senate, which currently are conducting sep
arate budget debates, have considered cut
ting 11 percent of the budget's non-defense
discretionary funds — $30 million — and
leaving its defense discretionary funds un
changed. Overall, lawmakers project a $400
billion budget increase between the 1996
and 2002 fiscal years, he said. But those fig
ures, he cautioned, are not adjusted for in
flation.
"The cumulative impact can be devastat

ing on us," he said. "Nobody worries about
the cumulative impact because each (mem
ber of Congress) has [his or her] individual

committee."
Casper said the only
way for students to truly
effect change is through
verbal and written
protests to their represen
tatives. He emphasized
that persistent complaints
by a university president
will not necessarily change
congressional opinion. In

the end, the members of Congress will make
their own choices.
"I can go and I can deliver my message
and make it very clear to them. When it fi
nally comes to the committee behind closed
doors, what they will decide and how they
will try to accomplish the budget reduction
is impossible for any of us to know,"he said.
"The single most important thing you in
this room and the other Stanford students
can do is to write your home members of
Congress, especially if they belong to the
majority. Get your parents and others to
write. I urge you to do that and that is the
way you can be most effective," Casper
added.
Casper and other members of the admin
istration also discussed recent University
policies which have encountered student
criticism. Under questioning from current


Casper
ASSU Financial Manager Gabe
Lucas and next year's Financial
Manager John Hall, Casper
defended the role of Stanford
Events and its ticketing policies
for groups.
Recently, Events and Services
has received rebuke from student
leaders for allegedly forcing stu
dent groups to sell tickets through
the Tresidder Union ticket office
and bear any extra fees. Director
of Stanford Events Lois Wagner
recently granted three groups —
Ram's Head Theatrical Society,
ASSU Speaker's Bureau and
ASSU Sunday Flicks — exemp
tions from the policy and created a
committee to investigate the cur
rent policy as it affects other stu
dent groups.
Helped by Wagner and Assoc.
Director of Student Housing
Rodger Whitney, Casper empha
sized that the Stanford Ticket

Office is not attempting to earn
money to cover other University
resources.
Wagner said the reason why
clients are possibly subject to an
extra fee results from federal com
pensation. Because the ticket
office is a government service cen
ter it is not allowed to gain or lose
more than 5 percent each year,
she said.
"The ticket office is not funded
by the University. As a service
center, the rates are set and
approved by the U.S. government.
We can't just say, 'Okay, we want
to give you a lower rate.' "
Casper, Whitney and Diana
Conklin, manager of undergradu
ate residential facilities, also
answered persistent questions
from undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell regarding the
implementation of University
cleaning in Row residences.
The current policy, which took
effect in November, requires that
all student-cleaned Row houses
which undergo the Capital
Improvement Plan be switched to

University cleaning.
According to Whitney, the only
exception are cooperative houses,
where allowing students to take
care of cleaning "is still the educa
tional experience that we were
intending." Whitney said he was
upset that some self-operated
houses have contracted out house
maintenance, which takes away
from the educational experience.
"After an investment of a mil
lion dollars, there is a strong feel
ing that these (houses) are kept at
these standards. One way of
knowing we can do this is Univer
sity maintenance," he said.
Senator-elect Jessica Koran
told Casper that one reason stu
dents are concerned about Row
houses switching to University
cleaning is because of increased
costs.
"A lot of people live in self-ops
because of costs," she said. "They
would much rather [clean | them
themselves. A lot of these stu
dents — they may not be the
cleanest, but they have other rea
sons."
