## UCSB assoc. dean teaches, plans beers at Tresidder 
### Anne Dubinsky Contributing Writer 
The search for the new dean of students continued
yesterday afternoon as finalist Joseph Navarro, asso
ciate dean of students at UC-Santa Barbara, met
with about 25 staff members and students in Tresid
der Union.
Navarro is primarily involved with student judi
cial issues at UCSB. He also teaches classes in the Po
litical Science and Chicano Studies Departments, in
cluding Chicano Politics and Anarchist Thought.
"I find that teaching balances my dealings with
students," he said. "It allows me to see students in a
light I don't usually see them."
From his experience in the judicial realm, Navarro
said that he has learned not to jump too quickly when
determining appropriate disciplinary action and not
to take second- or third-hand information about stu
dents' behavior. He also said that "sometimes look
ing at the bigger picture is more important than re
solving a matter in the most just way."
Navarro was asked by junior Andre Javier how he
would become visible and approachable to students.
Javier said many of his friends "don't know or care
about the dean of students." Navarro replied that he
has always had an open door policy with students.
"[This policy] is disruptive to my daily work, is
sometimes inconvenient and that's OK," he said.
"It's the price I'm willing to pay."
At UCSB, Navarro said he attends the meetings of
student organizations, especially those of minority
groups on campus. He would take advantage of a
school like Stanford, where there is such a large pop
ulation of students who live on campus, by socializing
with them. "I would go sit at Tresidder and have a
beer and mingle with students
once or twice a week," he said.
Asked how he could be an advo
cate for students, Navarro said he
would refuse to advocate in a gen
eral way for all student concerns.
"I would have to know about the
issue," he said.
Concerning graduate student
issues, Navarro said he believes
that all students should get their
money's worth. He would orga
nize a survey to find out what the

main concerns of graduate stu
dents are and then work to
address them.
Navarro has spent much time
working with different cultural
groups at UCSB. He is on the
board of the UCSB Educational
Program for Culture Awareness
and sits on a committee for Gay,
Lesbian, Bisexual Concerns. He is
also part of the AIDS task force
and a member of the Major Cam
pus Events Committee.
"I believe that multicultural
ism has almost turned into a
cliche these days," he said. "You
have to look at the diversity of the
student body. These two ideas

should be taken together."
Asked by Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions James Montoya
about the benefits of hiring
Navarro as dean of students,
Navarro said that Stanford would
get "someone who truly cares
about students, isn't afraid of stu
dents, can deal with students on
an equal level and wouldn't use
my office as a weapon to hide from
students."
"Being at a university is a dif
ficult thing," Navarro said.
"(Students) need some time to
relax, to get involved with activi
ties not directly related to aca
demics."
