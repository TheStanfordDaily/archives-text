# Ample amount
## Anonymous donor gives $8 million 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
May is traditionally among the
poorest months for fund raising,
but fortune smiled on Stanford
last week as University President
Gerhard Casper accepted an
anonymous $8 million gift for the
Stanford Restoration Fund.
The Board of Trustees estab
lished the fund in April 1994 to
raise money to restore the 242
structures damaged on campus
by the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake.
The donors, an alumnus and
his wife, said in a statement that
they were motivated to make
their gift in recognition of the
outstanding educational and cul
tural opportunities which Stan
ford presented them and their
children.
In a statement, Casper re
called a letter from David Starr
Jordan, Stanford's first presi
dent, who wrote that "the yellow
sandstone arches and cloisters,
the red-tiled roofs against the
azure sky, make a picture that
can never be forgotten, itself an
integral part of a Stanford educa
tion."
"This wonderful gift, to help
restore those arches, cloisters
and roofs, is a direct contribution
to the education of current and
future Stanford students,"
Casper said. "Our classrooms and
laboratories are an invaluable en
dowment from the past, and
Stanford is indeed fortunate to
have such dedicated alumni and
friends to restore and maintain
them for the future."
Susan Abernethy, associate
director of the Office of Develop
ment, said the donors did not wish
to have their names associated
with various buildings, rooms or
courtyards because they did not
wish to detract from the focus of
the gift.
"I think the gift was to show
appreciation of the educational

and cultural opportunities that
the family received during their
time here," Abernethy said.
And while the couple applaud
ed Stanford's commitment to
restoring historical structures,
they did not stipulate any restric
tions on how the gift will be spent,
so long as the money goes toward
rehabilitating earthquake dam
aged buildings, Abernethy said.
Among areas that still require
extensive repair work are large
sections of the Main Quad, Green
Library West and the Stanford

Art Museum.
Overall, the restoration project
is anticipated to cost the Universi
ty $200 million and should be
completed by the end of the
decade.
Almost $23 million has been
raised toward the $50 million goal
set by the Restoration Fund,
which supplements University
reserves, federal and state disas
ter relief funding.
"This is a very tough challenge,
so their gift makes a magnificent
difference," Abernethy said.
