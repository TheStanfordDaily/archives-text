# Ample amount
## Anonymous donor gives $8 million 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
May is traditionally among the
poorest months for fund raising,
but fortune smiled on Stanford
last week as University President
Gerhard Casper accepted an
anonymous $8 million gift for the
Stanford Restoration Fund.
The Board of Trustees estab
lished the fund in April 1994 to
raise money to restore the 242
structures damaged on campus
by the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake.
The donors, an alumnus and
his wife, said in a statement that
they were motivated to make
their gift in recognition of the
outstanding educational and cul
tural opportunities which Stan
ford presented them and their
children.
In a statement, Casper re
called a letter from David Starr
Jordan, Stanford's first presi
dent, who wrote that "the yellow
sandstone arches and cloisters,
the red-tiled roofs against the
azure sky, make a picture that
can never be forgotten, itself an
integral part of a Stanford educa
tion."
"This wonderful gift, to help
restore those arches, cloisters
and roofs, is a direct contribution
to the education of current and
future Stanford students,"
Casper said. "Our classrooms and
laboratories are an invaluable en
dowment from the past, and
Stanford is indeed fortunate to
have such dedicated alumni and
friends to restore and maintain
them for the future."
