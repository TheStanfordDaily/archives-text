# Affecting 'every aspect of life'
## Student volunteers educate on AIDS 
### Karen Wang 
For many people, AIDS Awareness Week
represents one of the few times when their
attentions turn to the issue of AIDS. But for
several Stanford students, helping those
infected with HIV and educating their peers
about the virus is an effort that persists
throughout the year.
Senior Aly Feldman became involved in
HIV education during her freshman year at
Vassar College. She immediately became inter
ested in HIV / AIDS health care and education.
For the past two years, she has been the
director of PROJECT SAVE, a student organi
zation that is in charge of AIDS Awareness
Week and World AIDS Day. She is currently
writing an honors thesis in psychology dealing
with HIV prevention.
"The HIV issue is something that affects
every aspect of life," she said. "It's personal,
psychological, emotional, political and social."
In the past year, she has also taken her
interests off the Farm. She has been actively
involved in the Santa Clara County organiza
tion AIDS Resources Information and Services
(ARIS), which pairs volunteers with people
infected with HIV.
For the past year, not only has Feldman
helped her client buy groceries and do house
work, but she has also become an outlet of
emotional support in difficult times. Feldman
said that working with HIV in this way is per-

haps one of the biggest challenges she faces.
"There is a tremendous difference between
educating people about HIV prevention and
then caring for someone I know is dying," she
said. "I think one of the main reasons I have
stayed in HIV education and care is because
there are constantly new and different ways I
can help."
Feldman is just one of a host of students
who devote substantial time to HIV / AlDS
related service. They volunteer at clinics, give
emotional support, do research, organize
events and educate others about the impor
tance of HIV and AIDS.
Like Feldman, Kiran Khush, who graduat
ed last quarter, became involved in HIV educa
tion during her freshman year.
After reading Randy Shilts' "And the Band
Played On," she developed a deep interest in
the measures taken to educate college students
about HIV/AIDS.
Soon after, she became involved in HIV
peer counseling at Stanford and has been a
counselor for the past four years. "I enjoy
being able to educate people one-on-one about
risk and behavior," said Khush.
She said she believes that college students
are at a critical point in their lives. "They have
the opportunity to become more aware of their
sexuality, protection and HIV prevention," she
said. "This is a valuable time to reach out to
people in the way an HIV peer counselor can.
In educating people, you give them something

that they can take with them when they leave
and that will help them in the future."
Before coming to Stanford, recent graduate
Seema Jain, Cowell Student Health Center's
half-time student projects coordinator, was
already involved with the HIV community,
having worked with HIV patients beginning in
the 10th grade.
Soon after arriving at Stanford, she became
an HIV peer counselor. Feeling that most stu
dents didn't think that they could be harmed
by HIV, she increased her efforts to educate
the Stanford community by holding informal
dorm information sessions.
Currently, Jain works in the Positive Care
Clinic in Stanford Hospital. One reason she
continues to educate people about HIV is her
belief that "there is a huge gap between knowl
edge about HIV and behavior change."
She feels that her current experience has
given her an enhanced understanding of HIV.
"I learned that there is more than just pre
scribing medicine when treating a patient,"
she said. "I see them everyday and have
become a part of their family." Just last week,
she rode in the California AIDS Ride from San
Francisco to Los Angeles.
The ride was more than just a tiring physi
cal enterprise. "Being cheered on by the crowd,
looking at them as I rode by, I knew that they
had faith in me," she said. "They had hope for
humanity. From things like that, I know that I
will be committed to HIV work."
