GOP drops tax cut
WASHINGTON (AP) - Republican
senators abandoned their effort to
ensure that taxes will be cut in their bal
anced-budget plan yesterday as the Sen
ate neared approval of a landmark GOP
outline for shrinking government and
eliminating the deficit.
Six days after the House adopted a
similar outline, the Senate edged
toward blessing its blueprint for killing
and reshaping hundreds of programs
and erasing annual shortfalls by '2002.
Senate Republicans said their measure
would save nearly $1 trillion over the
next seven years; the House version
claims $1.4 trillion in savings because it
also includes a tax cut.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-
Kan., had cleared the Senate's decks of
other major action, hoping the budget's
approval would dominate evening tele
vision news coverage. But Democrats
were forcing votes on dozens of amend
ments, and a peeved Dole announced
late yesterday that passage of the spond

ing plan would be delayed until today.
"We are ready to vote on the first bal
anced budget we've had in a long, long
time," Dole told reporters. He said final
passage would occur when Democrats
"decide to stop this foolishness" and
stop introducing amendments that Dole
said had grown to 50 in number.
A day after Sen. Phil Gramm, R-
Texas, was overwhelmingly defeated in
an effort to insert tax cuts into the bud
get, several senators said Dole had con
cluded that a second attempt would fall
short as well. Unlike the House, which
considers lowering levies a top priority,
many Senate Republicans keen on elim
inating the deficit say tax cuts would
make it harder to balance the budget.
Forrest Gump is in the red
LOS ANGELES (AP) — In one of the
most striking examples yet of creative
Hollywood accounting, the makers of
"Forrest Gump," the fourth highest
grossing movie ever, say the blockbuster
is more than $60 million in the red.

It's called "net profits" accounting. It's
standard industry practice and this is not
the first time it has caused jaws to drop.
"Forrest Gump," winner of this year's
best picture Oscar and five other Acade
my Awards, claims worldwide ticket sales
of $661 million and strong sales in its
first month of home video release.
The movie has been hugely profitable
for Paramount, Tom Hanks and the
director, Robert Zemeckis. People close
to the film estimate they each will earn
close to $40 million.
Paramount, Hanks and Zemeckis
enjoy a percentage of the film's gross
receipts — taking a cut of the first dollars
that come in from theaters, video stores
and soundtrack sales.
As for others involved in the project,
they'll have to wait before they see some
money. Winston Groom, who wrote the
novel, co-producer Steve Tisch and
screenplay writer Eric Roth are what are
known as net profit participants: Their
share comes from the net profits — the
profits left after various costs are
deducted.
