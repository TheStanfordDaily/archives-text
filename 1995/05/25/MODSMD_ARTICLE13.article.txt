# Israel, Syria sign new pact

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Israel and Syria
have agreed on a framework for security
arrangements for the Golan Heights that
would follow an Israeli troop withdrawal
from the strategic border enclave, Secretary
of State Warren Christopher announced
yesterday.
Details are to be worked out by Israeli
and Syrian military experts in late June.
They will join talks the two sides' ambas
sadors have been holding on and off in
Washington for nearly a year.
The agreement is the first between Israel
and Syria since they opened peace talks in
October 1991. Christopher called it "an
important development."
He also said that he would make his 13th
trip to the region next month — before the
military negotiations are held — and that
he was sending his senior adviser, Dennis B.
Ross, to the Middle East next week.
Details of the agreement Christopher
described as "general terms of reference"
were not disclosed. The reason for the
secrecy, a senior State Department official
said, was to keep the negotiations confiden
tial.
However, he said the agreement could
have an impact on Israel's withdrawal from
the strategic enclave and on eventual peace

terms with Syria.
"The climate as a whole has improved,"
said the official, who briefed American,
Israeli and Arab reporters under rules that
kept his identity secret.
On a sensitive point, the official said the
agreement did not call for stationing Amer
ican troops on the Golan Heights as a buffer
between the two sides.
Among the likely security measures are a
demilitarized zone and surveillance to
guard against surprise attack.
Christopher sealed the agreement in a
telephone conversation Tuesday night with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
Israeli Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich
called the agreement "a positive and impor
tant development." However, he said in a
statement that "the discussions and negoti
ations about the actual security arrange
ments are still ahead of us."
The sudden narrowing of differences on
security is a step toward Israel's surrender
of the land captured during the 1967
Mideast War. Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin had indicated he would be willing to
trade the territory and uproot the 14,000
Jews who live there in exchange for a peace
treaty — provided Israel's security was pro
tected.
