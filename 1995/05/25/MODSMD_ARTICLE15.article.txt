HOW MANY times have you
reached into your RO. box
excited by the possibility
of receiving real mail, only to find
a notification from the library
telling you that a book or journal
is overdue? And how often have
those notifications arrived after
you already returned the publica
tion?
Currently both Green and
Meyer Libraries have the policy
of warning students about over
due materials by both e-mail and
regular mail. Doing both is
unnecessary and expensive. Since
many library users have e-mail
accounts which they regularly
check, the libraries should con
sider offering overdue notifica
tions only through e-mail for peo
ple who request it.
An e-mail-only policy would
not only reduce the number of
excessive and annoying
reminders about materials past

due, but also would eliminate the
costs of postage and paper. Such a
change seems appropriate for
this environmentally concerned
campus.
Of course, some users don't
have e-mail accounts, so conven
tional mail should remain an
option. It would be simple to ask
borrowers if they prefer electron
ic or snail-mail notification —
and most people probably
wouldn't mind the hassle.
As this University moves
toward greater use of technology
to cut back on paperwork — with
an online housing draw and reg
istration and grades accessed
through the computer network
— it is about time for the
libraries to focus on only using e
mail to eliminate waste when
they can.
It would also save us from all
those dashed hopes at the post
office.
