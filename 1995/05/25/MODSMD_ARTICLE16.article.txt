Number six. No one's
done it. But the Stanford
Cardinal have at least two
more tries.
This year, Stanford sport teams
have tied the all-time record for
most NCAA championships in a
single academic year. Five teams
have ended up on top of their
respective fields: women's volley
ball, women's swimming and div
ing, water polo, men's gymnastics
and just Jast week, men's tennis.
Congratulations are, of course, in
order. Not only have these teams
excelled, but together they have
achieved a feat only accomplished
twice before (by Stanford and
UCLA).
It seems like a foregone conclu
sion that the Cardinal will be
named the NCAA's champion of
champions for recording the most
team titles this year. But
wouldn't it be sweet to break the
record?
Starting just yesterday, the

women's golf team began compe
tition in the NCAA champi
onships. And next week the
men's golf team will start it's own
quest for glory. Both teams are
slated in the number two spots in
the nation, and therefore have
very real shots at their titles. All
Stanford Cardinal fans stand
behind the teams watching, wait
ing and hoping.
In addition, the baseball team is
nearing the end of its season in the
number 15 position in the nation.
Although the prospect of a cham
pionship may not be as promising
here, it is still a possibility.
The athletes should know that
their classmates are right here
cheering for them and, with any
luck, will be there to congratulate
them at the end of the tourna
ments. All of us at Stanford can
be proud that this University is
one where academics and athlet
ics rank on the same level — on
top.
