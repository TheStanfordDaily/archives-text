GOOD NEWS! Just in case you
haven't heard, inability to decide on
a career is a sign of a bona fide per
sonality disorder. With a capital D.
Well I know I feel better.
Seems to be a running theme in this
space, this ongoing "gosh it's May and I
need to get a life" series. This is another
installment because there's something
comforting in knowing that a lot of people,
of all ages and stages, think that some
times this process is difficult.
Because it is.
Lately I've been trying to understand
the "it's the journey not the goal" philoso
phy on finding your identity. Enjoying the
pilgrimage. So I sat in a lotus pose. I pon
dered. And now, I'm about ready to hurt
someone. Because I'm a little confused.
If it's about the process, then why do
you have to wash petri dishes in a lab to
get into a Ph.D. program that unfortu
nately has no job guarantee? What's the
rationale behind O-chem lab? Why is the
search not much fun?
This "pursue pleasure no matter how
damn hard it may be" theory comes at us
from all sides. If someone can explain to
me how it meshes with the whole "sacri
fice today for the future" thing, let me
know.
It's just not fun all the time. Sure,
there are good parts galore. Like that
"14,000 Things to be Happy About" book.
But it may be a relief to realize that much
of life is hard. For everyone.
Especially that career thing. Most peo

pie are at least a little unsure and a tad
confused. From what I can tell, people
who think it's all just cherry jello slides
are clueless. Or maybe they're the ones
with the personality disorders.
Maybe the fun on the journey is about
little things. Like the stellar surgeon who
says that his biggest joys are the finger
painted pictures his daughter makes.
Really.
Success is not determined by W2 forms
alone.
We're bobbing and weaving down the
path of what those in the know call the
Truth. Supposedly, if you listen to your
self, you'll always stay close to the path of
your Truth. Problem is, many of us just
hear something that sounds like the inside
of a seashell.
On the search, I scored off the charts
on a career indicator test — between hor
ticulturer and pontificator. Obviously,
that makes me a monk. Look out, Gregor.
And you think that everyone knows
what they're doing with their Uves but
you.
The deal is that you never really know.
Except for that lawyer-to-be down the hall
who's been carrying around a copy of the
Constitution since he was two. Not that
there's anything wrong with that, but
there's certainly no reason to feel inade
quate or intimidated either.
Most people who say they know what
they're doing, don't. They lie because it
really sounds better to have a clue, even a
small one. Especially when you're meeting

the future in-laws.
But deep down, everyone is scared. The
grads who haven't secured something to
pay the rent, the professors who might not
get tenure, they're hyperventilating. So is
Connie Chung, who I heard is looking for
a job in radio.
At some point, you take a chance and
hope.
The bottom line is that there isn't one
right career. It doesn't hit you one morn
ing as you're putting on your socks. At
some point, you've just got to go for one.
And shape it in some way to fit you.
Like relationships. There isn't one
magical person you're meant to be with,
someone who fits like a piece of a puzzle.
It's all about flexibility, shaping and mold
ing toward compatibility.
More like play-dough.
From what I can gather, that's how it
works. It's tough — you want it all to be
perfect. You want the guarantee. I know I
do.
Carrying around that big chunk of
pressure called "what am I going to do
with my life" gets awfully heavy after
awhile. Hopefully, the search for identity,
trying on careers like Halloween cos
tumes, is a stage like the terrible twos.
Eventually, thankfully, you'll grow out
of it.

Julie would really like to be an heir so she
wouldn t have to worry about all this stuff.
