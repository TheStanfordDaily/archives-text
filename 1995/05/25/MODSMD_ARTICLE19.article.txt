Environment debate was overly optimistic and simplistic

I WAS PLEASED to see The Daily
attempt to tackle the difficult topic of
trade and the environment in this
week's Tuesday Thoughts. However, I
feel it is necessary to add my two cents
to this discussion in response to some of
the assertions made by Thomas Moore
and Justin Pollard.
I completely agree with Pollard that
"we do not have the time or resources
for [lesser developed countries] to follow
in our coal-burning, forest-clearing foot
steps." He is overly optimistic about the
World Trade Organization (WTO)
becoming an ally of the environmental
movement, though. The reason almost
all the national trade unions, consumer

groups and environmental organizations
opposed the Uruguay Round of GATT
(in contrast to their split over the
NAFTA) is because it is substantially
more threatening to democratic process
es and sustainable development than its
cousin. Unlike NAFTA, the updated
GATT's incentives for increased trade
and foreign investment fail to include
adequate safeguards for environmental
sustainability; the agreement does not
even deal with the issues of environmen
tally-related investment flight and
industrial relocation. The WTO will,
contrary to Pollard's hopes, result in the
downward harmonization of environ
mental as well as health and safety laws

as countries feel the pressure to compete
in international markets by lowering or
waiving standards.
Moore's logic, meanwhile, is painfully
simplistic. He writes, "Whenever the
government bars or restricts imports,
Americans suffer." Would he argue that
tough U.S. food safety laws that ban
vegetables with certain pesticides are
bad for us? Yes, free trade is good when
it raises the standard of living. Rather
than obeying the wrong-headed notion
that "trade is too important to let the
environmentalists strangle growth," we
should worry about environmental
degradation because it has real economic
and human health costs that lower our

standard of living â€” precisely the oppo
site effect that economic growth through
expanded trade is supposed to have.
The issue is not whether free trade is
good or bad for the environment, but
why the WTO is bad for the environ
ment. Under the right conditions,
expanded trade and economic growth are
environmentally beneficial. We should
all be aware of the need to incorporate
environmental concerns into future
trade agreements so that we won't have
another WTO. Unfortunately, it may
already be too late.
