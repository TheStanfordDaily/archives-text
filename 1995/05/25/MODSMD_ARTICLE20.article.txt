# Cartoon symptomatic of negative depiction of Muslims in media
## 
### 
It seems that on a daily basis, the
religion of Islam and Muslims in general
are systematically vilified in the news
media. Whether it be the World Trade
Center bombing, the Middle East, Irani
an trade issues with Russia or Okla
homa City, Muslims are continually por
trayed in a negative light.
With such portrayals in mind, I was

extremely upset to see the negative
depiction of Islam in The Daily's politi
cal cartoon on May 23. The cartoon in
question attempted to satirize the cur
rent U.S. policy stance on Russia's pro
posed nuclear trade negotiations with
Iran. In it's portrayal of President Raf
sanjani, the cartoon depicts a caption
over his head which reads "Praise
Allah."
Now, beyond the fact that the cartoon
deals with an issue of questionable valid
ity (many foreign powers view the Unit
ed States' concern over the trade as
unnecessary and, in some cases,
unfounded) there is the real concern

that the media finds it acceptable to
insult those of the Islamic faith. As a
Muslim, I am compelled to say that such
insults are totally unacceptable and
deplorable.
Using a caption that reads "Praise
Allah," the cartoonist moved away from
any valid criticism of people and their
political practices, and instead brought
God directly into the picture. However
indirect the insult may have been, it was
an insult nonetheless and cannot be
accepted. Such satire has no place in the
media. In the same way that many tele
vision stations omit language that pro
fanes God from the Christian perspec-

tive, Muslims should be afforded the
same courtesy.
Cartoons such as this do nothing but
reinforce negative stereotypes. The
media seems to feel comfortable using
such stereotypes, even at the expense of
minority groups such as African Ameri
cans, Chicanos / Latinos and, yes, Mus
lims. Well, it is about time that the
media, and papers like The Daily,
increased their levels of awareness to
accommodate the sensitivities of their
readerships, listenerships and viewer
ships. As Salaamu Alaikum.
