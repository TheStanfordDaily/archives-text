## Upbeat Diver leads sailing into upcoming nationals 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
Last fall, Stanford sailing coach Steve
Bourdow fielded the only complaint he
has ever heard about junior Sibyl Diver.
On that day Diver crewed with freshman
skipper Danny Zimbaldi at a challenging
East Coast regatta. Although they were
sailing together for the first time, the
Stanford duo dominated more experi
enced competition. The teamwork and
success of the boat prompted Zimbaldi to
say, "Damn, I think she's too good. I can't
keep up with her."
One might expect such praise to be
bestowed upon a veteran sailor with years
of experience. Diver doesn't fit that mold.
She never sailed in high school or even in
the junior ranks.
Diver's parents, both of whom sailed,
introduced her to the sport as a toddler;
by the age of three, she could sail a boat.
The Diver parents did not push their pre
cocious youth into the world of competi
tive sailing. Interest in boats and the
water was a product of feeling and intu
ition, not practice and lessons. Her early
experience in sailing came as an adven
turous youth exploring the powers of
Mother Nature.
"When I was little my sister and I
would go out right before a thunder
storm," recalls Diver. "We had so much
fun in the breeze and the wind."
Until arriving at Stanford, Diver's
relationship with sailing might be best
described as a casual friendship rather
than a love affair. Sports such as field
hockey captured her competitive atten

tion throughout high school, with her
time on the water reserved for relaxing
and enjoyment.
Diver's easygoing interest in sailing
shifted dramatically the summer before
her first year on the Farm when she par
ticipated in a local regatta with a friend.
The competitive aspects of the sport
opened her eyes to a different side of sail
ing. From that moment, she decided that
she was going to sail at Stanford.
"The competitive side was really excit
ing," Diver explains. "I love the idea of
being in a boat and going as fast as you
can."
Despite her enthusiasm, Diver came to
Stanford with some reservations.
"I didn't believe I could join the team
with such limited racing experience,"
Diver says.
Although Diver didn't possess much
tactical knowledge of the intricacies of
sailing, she brought something far more
valuable — a quality that to this day dis
tinguishes Diver as one of the biggest con
tributors to Stanford's sailing program.
Diver possesses an attitude that would
lead one to believe there is not a negative
particle in her body. That bright outlook
on life allowed her to initially overcome
her lack of technical knowledge and con
tinues to benefit all who interact with her.
"She has a very positive outlook on
life," Bourdow says. "She brings that to
competition."
The origins of Diver's upbeat disposi
tion can be traced to her maternal influ
ence.

Junior Sibyl Diver and her infectious enthusiasm have compensated for her lack of competitive experience prior to her
arrival at Stanford.
