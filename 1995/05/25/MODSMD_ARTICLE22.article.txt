## Upbeat Diver leads sailing into upcoming nationals 
### Mike Jensen Contributing writer 
Last fall, Stanford sailing coach Steve
Bourdow fielded the only complaint he
has ever heard about junior Sibyl Diver.
On that day Diver crewed with freshman
skipper Danny Zimbaldi at a challenging
East Coast regatta. Although they were
sailing together for the first time, the
Stanford duo dominated more experi
enced competition. The teamwork and
success of the boat prompted Zimbaldi to
say, "Damn, I think she's too good. I can't
keep up with her."
One might expect such praise to be
bestowed upon a veteran sailor with years
of experience. Diver doesn't fit that mold.
She never sailed in high school or even in
the junior ranks.
Diver's parents, both of whom sailed,
introduced her to the sport as a toddler;
by the age of three, she could sail a boat.
The Diver parents did not push their pre
cocious youth into the world of competi
tive sailing. Interest in boats and the
water was a product of feeling and intu
ition, not practice and lessons. Her early
experience in sailing came as an adven
turous youth exploring the powers of
Mother Nature.
"When I was little my sister and I
would go out right before a thunder
storm," recalls Diver. "We had so much
fun in the breeze and the wind."
Until arriving at Stanford, Diver's
relationship with sailing might be best
described as a casual friendship rather
than a love affair. Sports such as field
hockey captured her competitive atten

tion throughout high school, with her
time on the water reserved for relaxing
and enjoyment.
Diver's easygoing interest in sailing
shifted dramatically the summer before
her first year on the Farm when she par
ticipated in a local regatta with a friend.
The competitive aspects of the sport
opened her eyes to a different side of sail
ing. From that moment, she decided that
she was going to sail at Stanford.
"The competitive side was really excit
ing," Diver explains. "I love the idea of
being in a boat and going as fast as you
can."
Despite her enthusiasm, Diver came to
Stanford with some reservations.
"I didn't believe I could join the team
with such limited racing experience,"
Diver says.
Although Diver didn't possess much
tactical knowledge of the intricacies of
sailing, she brought something far more
valuable — a quality that to this day dis
tinguishes Diver as one of the biggest con
tributors to Stanford's sailing program.
Diver possesses an attitude that would
lead one to believe there is not a negative
particle in her body. That bright outlook
on life allowed her to initially overcome
her lack of technical knowledge and con
tinues to benefit all who interact with her.
"She has a very positive outlook on
life," Bourdow says. "She brings that to
competition."
The origins of Diver's upbeat disposi
tion can be traced to her maternal influ
ence.

Junior Sibyl Diver and her infectious enthusiasm have compensated for her lack of competitive experience prior to her
arrival at Stanford.
"My Mom is really positive — I
have always been like that," Diver
says."I get really involved in things
I'm excited about."
Physical and mental
In her first two years at Stan
ford, Diver mastered the technical
aspects of being crew in a two per
son boat. Crews must call the time
throughout the race, trim the sails,
watch for "puffs" of wind, keep
track of other boats, balance the
boat and serve as another pair of
eyes for the skipper. Diver fulfills
these numerous physical tasks like
an old pro and possesses an equally
impressive mental focus.
"To be mentally involved in the
racing makes me a valuable crew,"
Diver said. "I think I do a good job
at presenting the information."
Just ask Diver's current skip
per, sophomore Alice Manard,
about the impact of an awesome
crew. The two have only sailed
together for a little over two
months, yet they have asserted
themselves as the top women's
team. On the water, the two are
like peas in a pod. Both sailors
bring different qualities into com
petition. Manard demands the best
of Diver, and Diver appreciates the
opportunity to rise to the occasion.

Diver, on the other hand, brings a
soothing presence during the pres
sure of a race.
"She talks a lot in a very calm
voice," Manard says. "She puts
things in perspective — sometimes
she'll say, '0.K., we're just going
sailing.' "
Diver's positive attitude cush
ions the frustrations of sailing, a
sport in which fortunes can change
with the shift of the wind. Manard
most appreciates her teammate
after a tough day of racing. When
the chips are down, the skipper
often hears Diver's trademark
form of intervention: "Let's have
some water now."
Offering water in a time of dis
tress is just one of Diver's tactics.
One practice day this week, the
week before the Women's Fleet
Racing National Championships,
she brought Manard a flower.
Diver sets a positive and relaxed
tone that is crucial to sailing.
Throughout the year, Bourdow has
stressed the ability to overcome
adversity. Diver's philosophy on
sailing echoes her coach's empha
sis.
"When you're sailing, every
thing happens so fast you're sailing
by intuition," Diver explains. "I'm
able to externalize my frustrations
— I'm not going to beat myself up
about it."
Diver has shown consistent
improvement since day one at
Stanford. From her tactical
advancements as a freshman to

improvements in her mental game
as a junior, Diver continues to
learn. Her success stems from set
ting achievable goals and building
on each accomplishment. Whether
in a race or practice, Diver visual
izes success.
"You see a flash of what you
want to be doing, and the next
minute you're doing it," Diver says.
In discussing Diver's mental
prowess, Bourdow gives all the
credit to his sailor.
"She already had it before I got
here. I haven't taught her anything
new," Bourdow says. "She teaches
herself."
The experience of sailing for the
Cardinal has meant volumes to
Diver. She cherishes the opportu
nity to carve out her own niche of
contributions to Stanford. Already
a member of what is considered to
be the best women's team in Stan
ford history, Diver can add to her
list of accomplishments this week
end at the Women's National
Championships.
"It would mean a lot [to win|, an
external affirmation of all the hard
work we put into the sport as a
team," Diver says.
This weekend, regardless of con
ditions or results, Diver will feel
the spray of the water coming off
the bow and the rush of speed
while planing across the sea. She
will adjust the sails, call out the
time and balance the boat; all with
a positive attitude, all without the
slightest hint of a complaint.

Diver, on the other hand, brings a
soothing presence during the pres
sure of a race.
"She talks a lot in a very calm
voice," Manard says. "She puts
things in perspective — sometimes
she'll say, '0.K., we're just going
sailing.' "
Diver's positive attitude cush
ions the frustrations of sailing, a
sport in which fortunes can change
with the shift of the wind. Manard
most appreciates her teammate
after a tough day of racing. When
the chips are down, the skipper
often hears Diver's trademark
form of intervention: "Let's have
some water now."
Offering water in a time of dis
tress is just one of Diver's tactics.
One practice day this week, the
week before the Women's Fleet
Racing National Championships,
she brought Manard a flower.
Diver sets a positive and relaxed
tone that is crucial to sailing.
Throughout the year, Bourdow has
stressed the ability to overcome
adversity. Diver's philosophy on
sailing echoes her coach's empha
sis.
"When you're sailing, every
thing happens so fast you're sailing
by intuition," Diver explains. "I'm
able to externalize my frustrations
— I'm not going to beat myself up
about it."
Diver has shown consistent
improvement since day one at
Stanford. From her tactical
advancements as a freshman to

improvements in her mental game
as a junior, Diver continues to
learn. Her success stems from set
ting achievable goals and building
on each accomplishment. Whether
in a race or practice, Diver visual
izes success.
"You see a flash of what you
want to be doing, and the next
minute you're doing it," Diver says.
In discussing Diver's mental
prowess, Bourdow gives all the
credit to his sailor.
"She already had it before I got
here. I haven't taught her anything
new," Bourdow says. "She teaches
herself."
The experience of sailing for the
Cardinal has meant volumes to
Diver. She cherishes the opportu
nity to carve out her own niche of
contributions to Stanford. Already
a member of what is considered to
be the best women's team in Stan
ford history, Diver can add to her
list of accomplishments this week
end at the Women's National
Championships.
"It would mean a lot [to win|, an
external affirmation of all the hard
work we put into the sport as a
team," Diver says.
This weekend, regardless of con
ditions or results, Diver will feel
the spray of the water coming off
the bow and the rush of speed
while planing across the sea. She
will adjust the sails, call out the
time and balance the boat; all with
a positive attitude, all without the
slightest hint of a complaint.
