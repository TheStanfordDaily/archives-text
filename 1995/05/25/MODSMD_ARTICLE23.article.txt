# A 						consensus Hall of Famer
## Payton Jordan is still running strong at 78 after six decades of legendary track success 
### Matthew Lawrence Staff writer 
At 78 years old, Payton Jordan
still moves around the track better
than most people half his age — or
even a quarter his age. Jordan is a
timeless reminder of how athletes
and gentlemen should be. He is a
representative of a gentler time,
when friendship and love of one's
family was reward enough.
On June 14, Payton Jordan will
be inducted into the Stanford Hall
of Fame. It will be one more award
and one more recognition of the
soft-spoken greatness Jordan has
brought to the sport he loves so
much.
Jordan, the Stanford track and
field coach from 1957 to 1979, is a
believer in the connection of ath
letics and success; considering Jor
dan's list of accomplishments, he
proves his faith true.
Speaking with Jordan is proba
bly one of the greatest honors for
any track and field enthusiast. His
undiminished love for the sport is
evident in all he says and does.
Jordan draws his strength from
his family — he has two daugh
ters, two sons and four grandchil
dren, all in California — and from
the hundreds of lives he has
touched in his 40 years as a coach.
Although his own life is a story
of great achievement, Jordan
deflects questions about himself to
those he admires and those he has
coached. It takes direct questions
to draw out the reserved Jordan.
Given the opportunity, Jordan
places the credit for his success on
others.
"People are only as successful
as those around them," Jordan
says modestly. "It's been a team
effort for me all the way through."
Of his personal competitive suc
cess, he says,"I was very fortunate
to be around kind technical coach
es who could lead me and coach
me. I would hope I had something
of that to pass on to others."
Over 78 years, Jordan compet
ed at all levels and coached world
class athletes to his level.
It started in 1931, when the 14-
year-old Jordan won his first
major race — the 100-yard dash
— at the Pasadena Junior High
School Track Championships.
After the race, former Olympic
champion sprinter and USC track
star Charlie Paddock, then a
reporter for the Pasadena Star
News, approached young Jordan

and told him that he could become
a champion if he worked at it.
"I never forgot meeting him,"
Jordan says. "That was the begin
ning of my love affair with athlet
ics and track and field. A lot of
people don't realize how much a
kind word and a compliment can
help an athlete."
The next year, Jordan's mother
took him to the 1932 Olympics at
the Los Angeles Memorial Colise
um where, among the races con
tested that summer, Stanford
world-record holder Ben Eastman
won a silver medal in the 400
meters.
"That was a very inspirational

day for me," Jordan says."I
turned to my mother and said,
'Mom, you know that was abso
lutely wonderful. Someday, I hope
I can do that.' "
It would not be long before Jor
dan achieved his dreams. As a
freshman at Santa Monica Junior
College, he clocked 9.6 seconds in
the 100 yards and 21.1 seconds in
the 220 yards. In three years at
USC, Charlie Paddock's alma
mater, Jordan captained the track
team and was a halfback on the
1938 Trojan football team that
beat Duke in the 1939 Rose Bowl.

Track legend Payton Jordan will be inducted to the Stanford Athlet
ic Hall of Fame on June 14.
The year 1939 was good for
USC and Jordan. The top sprinter
in the country, Jordan captained
the Trojan track and field team to
the national championship. On
June 19, Life magazine ran a story
on the USC team and chose Jordan
for the cover.
In a dramatic black-and-white
photo, the 22-year-old Jordan fills
the cover in full sprinting position
wearing his USC uniform and clad
sockless in black leather racing
spikes. The image is reminiscent of
the famous photo of Jesse Owens
exploding out of the blocks at the
1936 Olympics in Berlin. The cap
tion at the bottom of the cover sim
ply reads, "Captain of Champions."
Thwarted by the war
The next year, 1940, should
have been an Olympic year, and
Jordan would have gone as perhaps
the best American sprinter. How
ever, the war in Europe canceled
the 1940 Olympics and escalated to
eliminate the 1944 Olympics and
Jordan's last opportunity at an
Olympic gold medal. In 1936
Owens made a statement to Nazi
Germany when he won four gold
medals. Jordan had to make his
statement to the world through
military service.
"When I was 14 years old, I was
hoping to aspire to [the
Olympics]," Jordan says."I was
hoping I could be like those ath
letes."
Asked if he regretted missing
the Olympics in his prime, Jordan
replies without hesitation, "I never
looked on it as a disappointment.
Maybe I wouldn't have made it, but
I would have liked a chance.
"There were things beyond my
control, with the war and my time
in the service, that didn't let it hap
pen. I had so many things happen
that it's not the end of the world."
Could Jordan have won it all?
In 1941, he ran a 9.5-second 100
yards to set a world record for all
grass tracks. He also ran an unoffi
cial 9.3 seconds on a dirt track. Jor
dan was in his early twenties, in his
athletic prime, but he looks on that
time like many people of his age.
Jordan remembers the friends he
made in the service of his country,
some of whom went off to war
never to return.
With the war cancellations, Jor

dan missed the Olympics as a com
petitor, but his involvement with
track and field would take him to
the Olympics in his later years.
After the war, Jordan returned
to his passion as a track and field
coach at Redlands High School. In
1946, he took over the head coach
ing job at Occidental College where
in 10 years he won 10 league
championships, two NAIA titles
and finished fourth in the NCAA
finals.
Jordan speaks proudly of his
years at Occidental. His runners
challenged the best of USC and the
rest of the local schools.
In 1957 Jordan joined the Stan
ford coaching staff and built a team
that placed second at the 1963
NCAA championships. He pro
duced numerous Olympians in his
time at Stanford and numerous
collegiate stars, among them
James Lofton, future NFL Hall of
Famer and 1978 NCAA long jump
champion, and Ken Margerum.
Both Lofton and Margerum will be
inducted into the Stanford Hall of
Fame this year with their former
coach.
"The wins and losses are all part
of the sport," Jordan says. "When
you look at the great people like
James and Ken who are in the
sport, that's the real reward."
In 1962 at the height of the Cold
War, Jordan organized a United
States vs. Soviet Union track and
field competition at Stanford Stadi
um. The two-day event drew over
150,000 spectators.
"We were breaking through the
Cold War and realizing that they
were people too," Jordan says."It
was a breaking of the distrust
between our countries and a cele
bration of the camaraderie of spir
it."
Jordan looks up into the stands
of Stanford Stadium and takes a
deep breath. He feels the lore of the
old track.
"I can see it today, the crowd ris
ing as the athletes joined hands
around the track. People in the
press box were crying."
As with many things in his life,
Jordan brought the Soviet team
through his friendships near and
far. Jordan tells the story of how in
1938 a young Soviet athlete wrote
to him at USC for advice on how to
train for the sprints and decathlon.
Jordan took the time to pen a long
letter describing in meticulous
detail his training regimen.
It was to be 20 years later, in
1958, that Jordan would get the
opportunity to meet that athlete

from the Soviet Union. As a coach
of the U.S. team that visited the
Soviet Union, Jordan stepped off
the plane and was greeted by his
corresponding Soviet coach. The
coach insisted on driving Jordan to
the team hotel. In the car the coach
introduced himself as Gabriel
Korobkov, the same athlete who
had written to Jordan in 1938.
The friendship that the two
men started led directly to the 1962
dual meet at Stanford Stadium, the
largest two-day track meet ever.
"It was an exciting time and a
wonderful event," Jordan said.
Finally in the Olympics
At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics,
Jordan was the first assistant
coach of the U.S. team, and at the
1968 Mexico City Olympics, he was
the head coach of the team. His
1968 Olympic squad won more
medals and set more records than
any other team in history.
"The times and the accomplish
ments were beyond my expecta
tions," Jordan says.
True to form, Jordan empha
sizes that his athletes succeeded at
the Olympics and also in their
careers outside track. Fortunately
for Jordan, his career came from
the sport he loves so much.
These days Jordan remains
active in the Stanford track and
field program. He lavishes compli
ments on head coach Vin Lananna
and the direction of the program.
Mostly Jordan enjoys his retire
ment and the opportunity to keep
up with his friends.
"When you retire you get a
chance to do some of the dumb
things in life. I have a small time
farming operation that I enjoy, and
it's a wonderful outlet for me," Jor
dan says.
"I like to watch things grow, I
like to nurture things."
That is Jordan's guiding philos
ophy. By providing a rich, support
ive environment, athletes, like
plants, can fulfill their potential.
The line between life and sport is
wonderfully blurred in the world of
Payton Jordan. If only more people
could enjoy the small pleasures.
As Jordan says, "Athletics may
seem different, but there's a corre
lation between the artistry of
painting, playing an instrument,
participating in sport and perfor
mance in life. We should all take
advantage of that."
Thankfully, Payton Jordan epit
omizes the artful athlete, and we
can all learn from his example.

and the direction of the program.
Mostly Jordan enjoys his retire
ment and the opportunity to keep
up with his friends.
"When you retire you get a
chance to do some of the dumb
things in life. I have a small time
farming operation that I enjoy, and
it's a wonderful outlet for me," Jor
dan says.
"I like to watch things grow, I
like to nurture things."
That is Jordan's guiding philos
ophy. By providing a rich, support
ive environment, athletes, like
plants, can fulfill their potential.
The line between life and sport is
wonderfully blurred in the world of
Payton Jordan. If only more people
could enjoy the small pleasures.
As Jordan says, "Athletics may
seem different, but there's a corre
lation between the artistry of
painting, playing an instrument,
participating in sport and perfor
mance in life. We should all take
advantage of that."
Thankfully, Payton Jordan epit
omizes the artful athlete, and we
can all learn from his example.
At 78 years old, Payton Jordan
still moves around the track better
than most people half his age — or
even a quarter his age. Jordan is a
timeless reminder of how athletes
and gentlemen should be. He is a
representative of a gentler time,
when friendship and love of one's
family was reward enough.
On June 14, Payton Jordan will
be inducted into the Stanford Hall
of Fame. It will be one more award
and one more recognition of the
soft-spoken greatness Jordan has
brought to the sport he loves so
much.
Jordan, the Stanford track and
field coach from 1957 to 1979, is a
believer in the connection of ath
letics and success; considering Jor
dan's list of accomplishments, he
proves his faith true.
Speaking with Jordan is proba
bly one of the greatest honors for
any track and field enthusiast. His
undiminished love for the sport is
evident in all he says and does.
Jordan draws his strength from
his family — he has two daugh
ters, two sons and four grandchil
dren, all in California — and from
the hundreds of lives he has
touched in his 40 years as a coach.
Although his own life is a story
of great achievement, Jordan
deflects questions about himself to
those he admires and those he has
coached. It takes direct questions
to draw out the reserved Jordan.
Given the opportunity, Jordan
places the credit for his success on
others.
"People are only as successful
as those around them," Jordan
says modestly. "It's been a team
effort for me all the way through."
Of his personal competitive suc
cess, he says,"I was very fortunate
to be around kind technical coach
es who could lead me and coach
me. I would hope I had something
of that to pass on to others."
Over 78 years, Jordan compet
ed at all levels and coached world
class athletes to his level.
It started in 1931, when the 14-
year-old Jordan won his first
major race — the 100-yard dash
— at the Pasadena Junior High
School Track Championships.
After the race, former Olympic
champion sprinter and USC track
star Charlie Paddock, then a
reporter for the Pasadena Star
News, approached young Jordan

and told him that he could become
a champion if he worked at it.
"I never forgot meeting him,"
Jordan says. "That was the begin
ning of my love affair with athlet
ics and track and field. A lot of
people don't realize how much a
kind word and a compliment can
help an athlete."
The next year, Jordan's mother
took him to the 1932 Olympics at
the Los Angeles Memorial Colise
um where, among the races con
tested that summer, Stanford
world-record holder Ben Eastman
won a silver medal in the 400
meters.
"That was a very inspirational

day for me," Jordan says."I
turned to my mother and said,
'Mom, you know that was abso
lutely wonderful. Someday, I hope
I can do that.' "
It would not be long before Jor
dan achieved his dreams. As a
freshman at Santa Monica Junior
College, he clocked 9.6 seconds in
the 100 yards and 21.1 seconds in
the 220 yards. In three years at
USC, Charlie Paddock's alma
mater, Jordan captained the track
team and was a halfback on the
1938 Trojan football team that
beat Duke in the 1939 Rose Bowl.

Track legend Payton Jordan will be inducted to the Stanford Athlet
ic Hall of Fame on June 14.
The year 1939 was good for
USC and Jordan. The top sprinter
in the country, Jordan captained
the Trojan track and field team to
the national championship. On
June 19, Life magazine ran a story
on the USC team and chose Jordan
for the cover.
In a dramatic black-and-white
photo, the 22-year-old Jordan fills
the cover in full sprinting position
wearing his USC uniform and clad
sockless in black leather racing
spikes. The image is reminiscent of
the famous photo of Jesse Owens
exploding out of the blocks at the
1936 Olympics in Berlin. The cap
tion at the bottom of the cover sim
ply reads, "Captain of Champions."
Thwarted by the war
The next year, 1940, should
have been an Olympic year, and
Jordan would have gone as perhaps
the best American sprinter. How
ever, the war in Europe canceled
the 1940 Olympics and escalated to
eliminate the 1944 Olympics and
Jordan's last opportunity at an
Olympic gold medal. In 1936
Owens made a statement to Nazi
Germany when he won four gold
medals. Jordan had to make his
statement to the world through
military service.
"When I was 14 years old, I was
hoping to aspire to [the
Olympics]," Jordan says."I was
hoping I could be like those ath
letes."
Asked if he regretted missing
the Olympics in his prime, Jordan
replies without hesitation, "I never
looked on it as a disappointment.
Maybe I wouldn't have made it, but
I would have liked a chance.
"There were things beyond my
control, with the war and my time
in the service, that didn't let it hap
pen. I had so many things happen
that it's not the end of the world."
Could Jordan have won it all?
In 1941, he ran a 9.5-second 100
yards to set a world record for all
grass tracks. He also ran an unoffi
cial 9.3 seconds on a dirt track. Jor
dan was in his early twenties, in his
athletic prime, but he looks on that
time like many people of his age.
Jordan remembers the friends he
made in the service of his country,
some of whom went off to war
never to return.
With the war cancellations, Jor

dan missed the Olympics as a com
petitor, but his involvement with
track and field would take him to
the Olympics in his later years.
After the war, Jordan returned
to his passion as a track and field
coach at Redlands High School. In
1946, he took over the head coach
ing job at Occidental College where
in 10 years he won 10 league
championships, two NAIA titles
and finished fourth in the NCAA
finals.
Jordan speaks proudly of his
years at Occidental. His runners
challenged the best of USC and the
rest of the local schools.
In 1957 Jordan joined the Stan
ford coaching staff and built a team
that placed second at the 1963
NCAA championships. He pro
duced numerous Olympians in his
time at Stanford and numerous
collegiate stars, among them
James Lofton, future NFL Hall of
Famer and 1978 NCAA long jump
champion, and Ken Margerum.
Both Lofton and Margerum will be
inducted into the Stanford Hall of
Fame this year with their former
coach.
"The wins and losses are all part
of the sport," Jordan says. "When
you look at the great people like
James and Ken who are in the
sport, that's the real reward."
In 1962 at the height of the Cold
War, Jordan organized a United
States vs. Soviet Union track and
field competition at Stanford Stadi
um. The two-day event drew over
150,000 spectators.
"We were breaking through the
Cold War and realizing that they
were people too," Jordan says."It
was a breaking of the distrust
between our countries and a cele
bration of the camaraderie of spir
it."
Jordan looks up into the stands
of Stanford Stadium and takes a
deep breath. He feels the lore of the
old track.
"I can see it today, the crowd ris
ing as the athletes joined hands
around the track. People in the
press box were crying."
As with many things in his life,
Jordan brought the Soviet team
through his friendships near and
far. Jordan tells the story of how in
1938 a young Soviet athlete wrote
to him at USC for advice on how to
train for the sprints and decathlon.
Jordan took the time to pen a long
letter describing in meticulous
detail his training regimen.
It was to be 20 years later, in
1958, that Jordan would get the
opportunity to meet that athlete

from the Soviet Union. As a coach
of the U.S. team that visited the
Soviet Union, Jordan stepped off
the plane and was greeted by his
corresponding Soviet coach. The
coach insisted on driving Jordan to
the team hotel. In the car the coach
introduced himself as Gabriel
Korobkov, the same athlete who
had written to Jordan in 1938.
The friendship that the two
men started led directly to the 1962
dual meet at Stanford Stadium, the
largest two-day track meet ever.
"It was an exciting time and a
wonderful event," Jordan said.
Finally in the Olympics
At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics,
Jordan was the first assistant
coach of the U.S. team, and at the
1968 Mexico City Olympics, he was
the head coach of the team. His
1968 Olympic squad won more
medals and set more records than
any other team in history.
"The times and the accomplish
ments were beyond my expecta
tions," Jordan says.
True to form, Jordan empha
sizes that his athletes succeeded at
the Olympics and also in their
careers outside track. Fortunately
for Jordan, his career came from
the sport he loves so much.
These days Jordan remains
active in the Stanford track and
field program. He lavishes compli
ments on head coach Vin Lananna
and the direction of the program.
Mostly Jordan enjoys his retire
ment and the opportunity to keep
up with his friends.
"When you retire you get a
chance to do some of the dumb
