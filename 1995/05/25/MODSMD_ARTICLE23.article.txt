# A consensus Hall of Famer
## Payton Jordan is still running strong at 78 after six decades of legendary track success 
### Matthew Lawrence Staff writer 
At 78 years old, Payton Jordan
still moves around the track better
than most people half his age — or
even a quarter his age. Jordan is a
timeless reminder of how athletes
and gentlemen should be. He is a
representative of a gentler time,
when friendship and love of one's
family was reward enough.
On June 14, Payton Jordan will
be inducted into the Stanford Hall
of Fame. It will be one more award
and one more recognition of the
soft-spoken greatness Jordan has
brought to the sport he loves so
much.
Jordan, the Stanford track and
field coach from 1957 to 1979, is a
believer in the connection of ath
letics and success; considering Jor
dan's list of accomplishments, he
proves his faith true.
Speaking with Jordan is proba
bly one of the greatest honors for
any track and field enthusiast. His
undiminished love for the sport is
evident in all he says and does.
Jordan draws his strength from
his family — he has two daugh
ters, two sons and four grandchil
dren, all in California — and from
the hundreds of lives he has
touched in his 40 years as a coach.
Although his own life is a story
of great achievement, Jordan
deflects questions about himself to
those he admires and those he has
coached. It takes direct questions
to draw out the reserved Jordan.
Given the opportunity, Jordan
places the credit for his success on
others.
"People are only as successful
as those around them," Jordan
says modestly. "It's been a team
effort for me all the way through."
Of his personal competitive suc
cess, he says,"I was very fortunate
to be around kind technical coach
es who could lead me and coach
me. I would hope I had something
of that to pass on to others."
Over 78 years, Jordan compet
ed at all levels and coached world
class athletes to his level.
It started in 1931, when the 14-
year-old Jordan won his first
major race — the 100-yard dash
— at the Pasadena Junior High
School Track Championships.
After the race, former Olympic
champion sprinter and USC track
star Charlie Paddock, then a
reporter for the Pasadena Star
News, approached young Jordan

and told him that he could become
a champion if he worked at it.
"I never forgot meeting him,"
Jordan says. "That was the begin
ning of my love affair with athlet
ics and track and field. A lot of
people don't realize how much a
kind word and a compliment can
help an athlete."
The next year, Jordan's mother
took him to the 1932 Olympics at
the Los Angeles Memorial Colise
um where, among the races con
tested that summer, Stanford
world-record holder Ben Eastman
won a silver medal in the 400
meters.
"That was a very inspirational

day for me," Jordan says."I
turned to my mother and said,
'Mom, you know that was abso
lutely wonderful. Someday, I hope
I can do that.' "
It would not be long before Jor
dan achieved his dreams. As a
freshman at Santa Monica Junior
College, he clocked 9.6 seconds in
the 100 yards and 21.1 seconds in
the 220 yards. In three years at
USC, Charlie Paddock's alma
mater, Jordan captained the track
team and was a halfback on the
1938 Trojan football team that
beat Duke in the 1939 Rose Bowl.
