It wasn't what they wished for, but it was defi

The No. 2 Stanford women's golf team began
its title quest yesterday by shooting a 6-over-par
294 at the NCAA championships in Wilmington,
N.C., a result that left them in fifth place after one

No. 1 and two-time defending national champi
on Arizona State played consistent golf on the par
-72, 6,061-yard Landfall-Dye course, firing an
opening round 288, two strokes better than No. 3
San Jose State.
No. 13 Indiana surprised the 18-team field with
a 291, a score good enough for third place. No. 5

fired a 5-over-par 77, and placed a disappointing
51st individually. For the first time in several
tournaments, McKay had to have her score

golf, the lowest score for each team is dropped and
the remaining four are added together to receive
the day's result.
"If we can get Mhairi's putting stroke going,
she'll be just fine," Baldwin said. "She was consis

today," one of whom was Furman's Caroline Peek,

championship hunt was McKay's roommate, fel-
