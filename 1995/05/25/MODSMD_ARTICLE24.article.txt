It wasn't what they wished for, but it was defi
nitely good enough.
The No. 2 Stanford women's golf team began
its title quest yesterday by shooting a 6-over-par
294 at the NCAA championships in Wilmington,
N.C., a result that left them in fifth place after one
day of competition.
No. 1 and two-time defending national champi
on Arizona State played consistent golf on the par
-72, 6,061-yard Landfall-Dye course, firing an
opening round 288, two strokes better than No. 3
San Jose State.
No. 13 Indiana surprised the 18-team field with
a 291, a score good enough for third place. No. 5
Wake Forest (293) followed the Hoosiers into
fourth place, one stroke ahead of the Cardinal and
five in front of No. 4 UCLA, who sat alone in sixth
place.
"This was a pretty good showing after one
round, especially if you consider we were in the

last grouping of the day," said Stanford head
coach Tim Baldwin. "Overall, it was a solid team
effort. We're six strokes back, and we didn't even
count the score of our No. 1 player [Mhairi
McKay]."
The sophomore All-American from Scotland
fired a 5-over-par 77, and placed a disappointing
51st individually. For the first time in several
tournaments, McKay had to have her score
dropped from the team's overall tally. In NCAA
golf, the lowest score for each team is dropped and
the remaining four are added together to receive
the day's result.
"If we can get Mhairi's putting stroke going,
she'll be just fine," Baldwin said. "She was consis
tently out-driving her two playing partners
today," one of whom was Furman's Caroline Peek,
who has won the long-driving competition in this
tournament in the past.
Leading the Cardinal into the thick of the
championship hunt was McKay's roommate, fel-
low sophomore Andrea Baxter. Her
2-under-par 70, which included
three birdies and one bogey, left her
in a three-way tie for third place
after the day's play. It was her best
round out of five that she had
played previously in NCAA champi
onship competition.
"I hadn't been hitting the ball all
that well just before this tourna
ment," Baxter said. "The key on
this course is that you have to
strike it well off the tee. Accuracy
really counts, plus the greens were
tougher today than they were in the
practice rounds. Considering all
that, I thought I played well."
Senior Amy Lawrence survived
an early triple bogey on hole 15
(Stanford played the back nine first
yesterday) to shoot a 73 and tie for

12th place. Her seesaw round also
included two bogeys and four
birdies.
"It was really nice to make some
putts today," Lawrence said of her
second best round in NCAA compe
tition. "I really had not been mak
ing all that many birdies this
spring, but that was the difference
today. Overall, I was pleased with
my performance."
Junior Vicky Strada took a page
from Baxter's book in playing the
best NCAA round of her collegiate
career, golfing her way to a tie for
33rd with a 3-over-par 75. Round
ing out the scoring for the Cardinal
was senior Jamille Jose, who shot a
76 and finished the day in 41st
place.
San Jose State's Vibeke Sten
srud and Wake Forest's Laura
Philo lead the four-round tourna
ment with 3-under-par scores of 69.
"The good news is that we're
still in the hunt after the first day,

which hasn't been very good for us
the past few years in the tourna
ment," Baldwin said. "I was very
pleased with Amy, who came back
to shoot a 73 after that triple bogey.
Andrea just keeps getting better
and better. And both Vicki and
Jamille had pretty good rounds."
Stanford's best finish in this
year-end tournament is fourth, at
Arizona State's Karsten Golf
Course back in 1992. Last year in
West Linn, Ore., the Cardinal was
ranked third but finished a disap
pointing seventh.
In accumulating the best rank
ing in team history, this year's
squad has kept the same starting
five that experienced that letdown
in 1994.
Baldwin and his troops hope that
this experience will pay off in the
form of clutch drives and putts dur
ing the final three rounds as the
Cardinal searches for its first NCAA
women's golf championship.
