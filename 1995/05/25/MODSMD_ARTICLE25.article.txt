# Co-term Kyle says the real world can wait — he still wants to coach
## 
### 
Finality is all around me. My
friends are leaving, off to
medical school, music
school and off to work. I'll be here
next year, finishing up and feeling
the pressures surrounding the
future that I sidestepped this year
by doing the old co-term thing.
What I'll be doing next year is
completely undetermined. There
are some things I think I should
be looking into, and I'll probably
spend a good deal of my time at
the ever-popular CPPC. But I
know what I want to do — I want
to be a coach.
Since I hung up my Speedo and
goggles three years ago, I've had a
blast coaching water polo during
the summers and this past fall
and spring. After being at the pool
six days a week growing up and
attending as many as 13 work
outs a week, I feel at home on the
pool deck. What makes the job
interesting and fun is the fact
that I've found that water polo
culture is constant. The kids and
their attitudes really don't change
much over time.
On Monday, we had a team
meeting for the Stanford summer
club, which attracts high school
ers from all over the area. Stand
ing in front of the bleachers at
deGuerre Pool, I gazed up at
probably close to 100 kids who
looked exactly as I would have
looked five years ago. I guess peo

ple who know me would argue
that I still would have fit nicely
into the crowd, which was charac
terized by long baggy shorts, old
faded tournament T-shirts and of
course an uncombed and
disheveled mop of hair or a base
ball cap.

It's hard for me to keep the dif
ference in age between me and
the kids I'm coaching, who range
from 12 to 16 years old, in per
spective. It's hard enough to
remember that I'm 22, but being
six, seven, eight or even more
years older than the boys is a
weird thought. It's probably
because what they are doing
reminds me so much of when I
was their age.
My summers used to be a time
totally devoted to water polo and
hanging out with friends. Before I
ever worried about internships
and summer jobs and what is best
for the resum§, our only concerns
were getting to practice roughly

on time and how to find cheap —
preferably free — entertainment
when we weren't in the pool.
I enjoy being around my kids
because it brings back a lot of
what I remember about growing
up. Some of them are dropped off
and picked up by mom or dad
eveiy day. Others come cruising
in on their bikes. And there's
always someone with a car who
has to pick up and bring half the
team to practice. I also recognize
and remember all their little ways
to minimize effort and maximize
socializing and fun.
Now that I'm a coach, I can
understand why so much of the
goofing off we used to do would
drive my coaches nuts. I spend
most of my energy prodding them
to put on their suits, stop talking,
take out the lane lines, get in the
pool, quit floating on the balls, get
off the wall and quit fooling around.
The more I'm out there, the
more I dread trading in my sun
glasses, shorts and thongs for a
suit and tie. It will be a sad day
when I can't throw a hat on my
head to avoid dealing with what my
hair looks like. It's a laid-back
lifestyle that suits me fine, and for
now the memories make me feel
like I never want to leave the game.
