## Commission developing campus policy 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
One year after charging the
Commission on Technology in
Teaching and Learning with guid
ing the University's technology
policy, University President Ger
hard Casper sees its work as "very,
very positive."
Thanks to the commission's
work, Casper said, the University
"can go much more confidently
into the future."
Casper announced the commis
sion in his State of the University
address last spring, calling for a
group to help Stanford move into
the next century.
In this year's address, Casper
echoed many of the same themes,
saying, "We must examine with
out delay how we will use the new
technologies [and] what invest
ments in infrastructure and soft
ware development are called for."
So far, the commission's rec
ommendations have included
comprehensive University docu
ments on the World Wide Web,
technology specialists for every
academic department and a new
center to study human-computer

interaction.
"We're doing a huge number of
things — far more than I imagined
would be possible," said Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences

John Etch
emendy, the
commission's
chair.
Today, Etch
emendy and
Casper will meet
to discuss some
of the commis
sion's new rec
ommendations.

But while
Etchemendy said the commission
has succeeded in implementing
many of its projects, it is con
strained by such factors as time
and resources. "Some thingß have
gotten going. Some require more
energy," he said.
According to Etchemendy, ex
penditures to implement the com
mission's proposals — some of
which might strain the Universi
ty's budget — may cause problems
as the recommendations are
brought before the administra
