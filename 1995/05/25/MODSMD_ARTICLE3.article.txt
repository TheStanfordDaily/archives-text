# Technology plan
## Commission developing campus policy 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
One year after charging the
Commission on Technology in
Teaching and Learning with guid
ing the University's technology
policy, University President Ger
hard Casper sees its work as "very,
very positive."
Thanks to the commission's
work, Casper said, the University
"can go much more confidently
into the future."
Casper announced the commis
sion in his State of the University
address last spring, calling for a
group to help Stanford move into
the next century.
In this year's address, Casper
echoed many of the same themes,
saying, "We must examine with
out delay how we will use the new
technologies [and] what invest
ments in infrastructure and soft
ware development are called for."
So far, the commission's rec
ommendations have included
comprehensive University docu
ments on the World Wide Web,
technology specialists for every
academic department and a new
center to study human-computer

interaction.
"We're doing a huge number of
things — far more than I imagined
would be possible," said Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences

John Etch
emendy, the
commission's
chair.
Today, Etch
emendy and
Casper will meet
to discuss some
of the commis
sion's new rec
ommendations.

But while
Etchemendy said the commission
has succeeded in implementing
many of its projects, it is con
strained by such factors as time
and resources. "Some thingß have
gotten going. Some require more
energy," he said.
According to Etchemendy, ex
penditures to implement the com
mission's proposals — some of
which might strain the Universi
ty's budget — may cause problems
as the recommendations are
brought before the administra


Casper
tion.
Even so, the commission has
already implemented a number of
projects, including one beginning
this fall to broadcast lectures,
concerts and other items of inter
est on local cable channel 51, in a
joint venture with the Cable Co
op.
While many of the commis
sion's suggestions and projects
are not yet obvious to the Stan
ford community, "I think
Ichanges] will become visible at
an increasing pace," Casper said.
In addition, the commission
has initiated a project to make
faculty, staff and students more
comfortable with the World Wide
Web and other communications
systems.
"We would like to see every

body capable of using the Web,"
Etchemendy said.
While students can already
access quarterly time schedules
through the Web, the commission
hopes to distribute other Univer
sity documents, such as Faculty
Senate agendas and Courses and
Degrees, Etchemendy said.
"If it's done right, there are a
lot of cost savings," he said.
Along with financial benefits,
there are other positive aspects to
Web publishing, said Biochem
istry Prof. Doug Brutlag, a com
mission member.
"It allows us to publish
changes, for instance, to the quar
terly time schedules," Brutlag
said.
"It makes it easier for people to
plan," Brutlag added. A model
system for the time schedule
might include links to course
descriptions from Courses and
Degrees, professors' resumes or
even court** syllabi, he said.

Philosophy Prof. Patrick Sup
pes, a commission member, is the
faculty adviser for the Education
al Program for Gifted Youth,
which currently offers courses on
CD-ROM for high schools stu
dents in subjects for which no
advanced placement courses are
offered.
Under a commission proposal,
students who take these courses
and attend Stanford could receive
credit for their coursework.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement has
already approved the change to
the program and the Faculty Sen
ate's Steering Committee is now
debating the issue.
One of the commission's
largest projects is a Center for
Human / Computer Interaction
that would "encourage and sup
port the use of technology in
classrooms at Stanford,"
Etchemendy said.
The center would combine

research on new software with
support for already existing tech
nology, with students in majors
such as symbolic systems develop
ing software, he said.
A related proposal, also still in
the planning stages, would pro
vide academic departments with
information resources specialists,
who would "support technology in
the departments and classrooms
and also be promoters of the use
of technology in the classroom,"
Etchemendy said.
The University currently has a
centralized system for support
and promotion of technology.
Under the new system,
Etchemendy said, specialists
would be spread out and special
ized, more like librarians at the
smaller branch libraries on cam
pus.
The commission hopes to have
six specialists in place by Septem
ber, each serving about 40 faculty
members, Etchemendy said. Ide

ally, the program would eventual
ly expand to serve all faculty.
"If this works as well as we
think it will, it will be the primary
method of delivering informa
tion," Etchemendy said.
But "it will not be a cheap pro
gram," he added. "We'll have to
be convinced after a few years if
this is really worth our while."
Casper said that financially he
is "as committed as is humanly
possible" to funding the commis
sion's recommendations. Howev
er, "if we face serious cutbacks,
we may actually have to change
pace and go much more slowly,"
he said.
The commission's work is
ongoing and next year looks to be
as full as this one, said Pat
Devaney, the commission's coor
dinator.
One of the commission's focus
es for the next several months will
be gathering input from students,
faculty and staff, she said.
