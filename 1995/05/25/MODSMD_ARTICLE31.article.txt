# Arrillaga's nod to history's sporting women
## 
### Shane Reilly 
For many women at Stanford, it would
be difficult to imagine replacing our
running shoes for pointed lace boots,
our spandex for bloomers or our sports bras
for corsets. However, according to the art ex
hibit at Arrillaga Family Sports Center enti
tled "The Sporting Woman: Insights from
Her Past," such articles dominated women's
workout attire.
Chronicling 2,000 years of women's par
ticipation in athletics, the exhibit shows that
despite restrictive clothing and social mores,
women succeeded in incorporating sports
into their lives throughout the ages. In addi
tion, the works show how sports have
shaped women's history by providing incen
tives for women to break through social re
strictions and norms.
"Women in athletics as (solely) a modern
phenomenon is just not true," said show di
rector and Arrillaga associate director of
major gifts Karen Recht.
Ordinary pi-o|>l«'
The brainchild of Sally Fox, the show dis
plays images of all types of women engaging
in sports. The exhibit, which takes up three
hallways in Arrillaga and is currently seek
ing a permanent home, does not glorify any
particular famous women's sporting events
or pictures of notorious athletes. Rather, it
attempts to show how sports have affected
all women. Fox explained to the Daily Tid
ing newspaper: "The point of the exhibit is
not to deal with women as champions; it
deals with ordinary women through history

who have always included sports in their
lives."
Not only docs Fox de-emphasize particu
lar athletes, but the artists of the pieces are
marginal to the theme of the show. In keep
ing with her ideas about sports in the lives of
ordinary women, Fox did not limit herself to
paintings and photographs. Rather, she
worked largely with ephemera, artifacts of
material culture.
By using sheet music covers, cigar box lids
and other products of everyday life that had
images of women athletes, Fox illustrates
just how common it was for women to en
gage in sports. The unique materials Fox
chose are the strength of her show because
they illustrate the universality of her theme
in many cultures and time periods.
Imngi'M of s|>nrlin£ women
The show explores the role of sports in
women's history by providing a cross section
of very different materials, time spans and
sports. One of the earliest pieces, a picture of
a Spartan runner Bronze statuette, is dated
520 B.C. The sprinter captures the spirit of
female foot races that took place at Olympia.
A picture of a Roman mosaic depicts three
women "clearly working out," according to
Recht. One figure appears to be lifting
weights, another engaged in pre-Fonda aer
obics.
The most striking image is the exhibit's
entrance piece, a print of a woman tossing
up her arms in the joy of freedom brought to
her by her new bicycle. The bicycle brought

women freedom from chaperones and pro
vided an individual means of transporta
tion.
Recht believes the show plays into the di
alogue about our society's changing views
on women and female athletics. "We're not
always assuming now that little girls want to
play with d 0115..." she said.
Recht explained that women were once
expected to be a living definition of what was
considered feminine, and that definition "ex-

panded through the involvement of women
in athletics." As time went on, women inte
grated sports more into their lives and altered
not only their dress but adopted increasingly
masculine ideas of competition.
Women of lht> Kuril
This increasing incorporation of sports
into the lives of women can best be seen by
comparing two images of women hunters
from different time periods exhibited in the
show. An 18th-century, hand-colored Ger
man engraving illustrates a woman reminis
cent of the generously dressed French aris
tocracy. The picture appears to be more
about her attire and beauty rather than her
athletic ability.
Her wide hoopskirt, a rotund and frilly
affair of bright color, dominates the compo
sition. Her plumed hat, white wig, and kelly
green satchel are details that present her as a
woman of high class engaging in a leisure ac
tivity.
Even the elements of hunting are stripped
of their brutality and transformed into ob
jects of beauty. The violence of her rifle is
muted because it subtly projects from her
backside. There are several dead pheasants
in the picture, but they are nearly lost be
neath the ruffles of her skirt or mistaken for
part of her outfit as they are strewn like a
careless scarf across her body. The hunting
dog at her side does not seem to be the fero
cious animal necessary for making a kill.
Rather, it peers lazily at the viewer, as if the

savagery of a bloody hunt is meant for lesser
canine.
" The 'New Woman' as Hunter," a chro
molithograph from 1890, expresses a
woman much more involved with the sport
of hunting. Instead of a large skirt, the pres
ence of her clothing has been vastly reduced
to a slender pant suit. Pant suits facilitated
movement and enhanced her participation
in the sport.
The woman's increased involvement in

the sport is clear because the elements of
hunting, not her dress, are crucial parts of
the composition. The woman holds the rifle
in the forefront and grips it with an air of
certainty. In the other hand, her triumphant
kill is starkly visible. The hunting dog plays
an active role in this picture as well, barking
up towards its female master's victory.
Although this second hunter maintains a
delicate expression and her heeled boots
may be cumbersome by today's standards,
the images' differences demonstrate how
sports have contributed to change in
women's clothing and activities.
It is a notable coincidence that Arrilla
ga's first and only art show occurs at the
same time that the Athletics Depart
ment has been trying to augment women's
athletics. This year women's lacrosse has
turned varsity, and by next year the number
of women's athletic scholarships will be in
creasing. Perhaps the show is an important
marker of the future of women's sports at
Stanford.
