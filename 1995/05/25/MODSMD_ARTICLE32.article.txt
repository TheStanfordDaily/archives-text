# Fun, frolicsome and free: Spring dorm musicals take off
## 
### story by sam Park Graphics by Victoria Foster 
One is a wicked, wise-ass, all-out comedy coming from
enfant terrible Branner Hall titled "Self-Immolation:
The Musical." The other is a sophisticated adaptation
of Broadway's high-hats-and-petticoats affair "My Fair
Lady." One is West Side; the other East Side. But both of these
dorm musicals include members of a cappcllo groups, Rams
Head graduates and leading actors from the drama depart
ment, and they promise to be fun, fun, fun.
Were any squirrels harmed in the production of this show?
Premiering tomorrow, "Self-Immolation: The Musical" is
a morbid talc about a young Brannerite who would do any
thing — even put someone on fire — to win the heart of the
woman he loves. It's a pyromaniac's dream come true, com
plete with inside jokes about Branner life, hashers, German
accents and Casper (the president, not the ghost).
To create the original musical, a group of Brannerites shut
themselves off in a room for hours winter quarter to work in
the script.
"There was a lot of creative energy and some tense mo
ments," said co-writer Jill Meyers of the writing sessions.
"Lots of outlines on blackboards and nicknames and Flipper
imitations."
The result is a comedy that co-writer Ryan Snyder promis
es will "seep through [the audience's] skin."
"All these other dorms are re-animating dead corpses,"
Snyder said. "Meanwhile, we're being innovative. We're not
dealing with old stuff that's already been done."

The rain in Spain stays mainly in
the plain. . No one is put on
fire in Florence Moore Hall's pro
duction of "My Fair Lady," and that may
be to their advantage. They're playing it
straight.
"It's an ambitious dorm musical. It's a
big challenge, since this musical is a lot
more complicated than others," said RA
and director Abhi Katyal, who recently
appeared in the drama department pro
duction of Noel Coward's "Design for
Living." "The storyline involves a lot
more depth than the typical boy-meets
girl, sing-and-dance trouble in paradise."
Based on the George Bernard Shaw
play "Pygmalion," "My Fair Lady" is the
story of Eliza Doolittle (Tanya Lukin), a
poor and uneducated flower seller in
1900s England who dreams of a better
life. She is picked up by snotty Prof. Hig
gins (Andy Paul, of Fleet Street fame),
who bets that he could turn her into a
polished lady of high society.
"It's going to be a lot of fun to watch
because the characters are so well devel
oped," Katyal said. "It's going to be an in
volving show. The human story and the
serious matters are well interlinked."
These serious matters include the tension
between Higgins' sexist attitudes and the
proto-feminist inclinations of Doolittle.
Katyal, who volunteered to direct, has
been leading the cast and crew of about 26
Flo Mo residents through six weeks of re
hearsal.

The fact that dorm musicals are not staged in auditoriums
adds to the need for innovation, according to co-director
Chad Bonaker.
"It challenges the mind. In a way it's more fun," he said.
"The true benefit of dorm theater is that it gives people expo
sure that they wouldn't normally have."
The well-integrated musical, though very plot-oriented,
features a large dose of song and dance, with music written by
Barbie Wong and choreography by Jaime Saunders. Co-lyri
cist Rachel Pelc describes the songs as "very diverse. Some of
it is pretty morbid." In the opening song, for instance, people
at a house meeting do high kicks to the tune of the "Suicide
Blues."
The show is also a family affair for Branner, featuring guest
appearances by its resident fellow and various RAs, including
former drama department darling Taylor Antrim.
Featuring the writing, acting, painting, singing and danc
ing talents of over 30 Brannerites, the show demonstrates
that the all-frosh dorm has been a hotbed of artistic and the
atrical activity this year.
"We're all on fire, just like the title," raved cast member Jim
Cooley.

"We have such great, charismatic
leads," Katyal said. "Even though we've
had very few rehearsals, the show has
pulled together fast."
Which is an improvement from last
year. Though Flo Mo tried, there was no
production last year, something that
Katyal attributes to lack of RA support.
"Because [Flo Mo] is so big and
spread-out, it really needs a lot of RA sup
port. In years without RA-support, it
hasn't happened," Katyal said. So Katyal
made a point of personally directing the
project.
"It was a matter of who wanted to pull
it through and bring it together," Katyal
added.
Katyal makes it clear that this won't be
a backyard production of "My Fair Lady."
The crew is getting sets and costumes au
thentic to the time period, and the cast is
working hard at those Cockney and
British accents. According to Katyal, the
only major change from the original
Broadway production is the length of the
show, cut from three hours to roughly
two.
