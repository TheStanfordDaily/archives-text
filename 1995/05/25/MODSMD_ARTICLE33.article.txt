# 'A Chorus Line’ clearly a group effort
## 
### Linda Friedlieb 
In a time when cultural awareness and
non-traditional casting are typical buzz
words, "A Chorus Line" represents the
antithesis of political correctness.
Val, the blond bombshell who openly ad
mits she had her "tits and ass" done to get bet
ter parts, will make feminists cringe. Al, the
macho Italian dancer whose subservient
blond wife Kristine is unable to get through a
number without him, is caricature come to
life. Diana, the Puerto Rican from the Bronx,
is the stereotypical overachiever determined
to dance her way off the streets.
To be blunt, "A Chorus Line" is dated,
stereotypical and sometimes blatantly offend
ing. Suspend reality and liberal consciences
for a while, and maybe it's a little fun, too.
Unlike the movie, the musical theater ver
sion of "Chorus" is not a love story between
Zach and Cassie, but an ensemble piece about
17 dancers struggling for eight spots on a cho
rus line. Each toe-ster has his / her own story
to tell as director Zach chooses his cast.
From the first tune, "I hope I get it," to the
last "Bows," music and dance numbers, re-en
acted with Michael Bennett's original Broad
way choreography by director Sam Viverto,

are "A Chorus
Line's" saving grace.
If only the songs
lacked lyrics.
"A Chorus Line"

essentially centers around a white line on the
stage on which the dancers take posi-

tions while Zach interviews
them and assesses their dance

moves. The question "tell me
about yourself" proves dan
gerously disconcerting to

many, who spend their
time praying to delay

their turn and trying to
figure out exactly what

Mr. Director wants to
hear.

The dancers each have their
own stance, which they resume
each time they hit the line. Sex ob-

ject Val sticks butt and boobs out
in the air, lone Asian Connie cross
es her arms, Kristine and Al hold
hands and glance at each other ner-

vously.
At one point, while talking to her

ex-lover Zach (Steven Patterson),
falling star Cassie (Beth Swearin
gen) attempts to glorify each
dancer's special qualities and why
she would thus be proud to work a

chorus with them — even if she once had the
big roles. "Sure I would love a part," she says.
"But what I really need is a job."
Eventually, we hear tales of broken dreams
and shattered childhoods — unhappy fami
lies, abandoned kids, adulterous fathers,
teenagers who didn't feel comfortable in their
small-town lives, discoveries of homosexuality
and the limitations of plain looks and aging,

as well as hopes of success and stardom.
Watching "A Chorus Line" though,
we have to wonder about the casting that put
these particular actors on stage. Some de-

serve to have made the cut more than
others.

A particular standout, Kelly
Marshall brings Kristine to life

with energy, pizzazz and fun
in the number "Sing!" and
k vapid insecurity the rest of

the time. Although Kris
tine can't sing, Marshall

clearly must have tremen
dous skill to make her notes

accurately off-key.
Yet when the part demands,

Marshall reverts to the shyness
that ultimately leaves Kristine

utterly dependent on hubby
Al (Tony Spinosa).

Sheila (Laura
Soltis) — the aging

dancer who only speaks in come-on lines and
come-hither tones — ; s beautifully bitchy.
"Don't you know the steps?" asks a director
/ choreographer, after Sheila stops dancing
when placed in the dancers second line. "I
knew them when 1 was in the front," she mut
ters with a deceptively sweet smile.
As Cassie, Swearingen is cute, but unheard.
As the notes in her solo, "The Music and the
Mirror," climb into the rafters her voice loses
strength and becomes difficu! to understand.
Also incomprehensible is K. th Jackson as
Richie, when his character takes a star turn in
the number "Montage-Part 4."
"A Chorus Line" must truly have one of the
cheapest sets in the realm of theater. A few
mirrors and that line on the tloor are all the
props needed, except for the hats and canes
utilized as the cast learns the steps to "One
Singular Sensation."
Transformed from iryout leotards to glit
tering gold suits, the finale b ings the entire
cast together once moie. Yet altogether "Cho
rus" lacks the sensational pizzazz "One Sin
gular Sensation" finally brings to the stage.
