# Grub Focus on: Left at Albuquerque
## 
### Seth Goldstein 
Whenever Bugs Bunny has some free
time, he likes to vacation at Pismo Beach.
Unfortunately for the Warner Brothers rab
bit, he always manages to take a wrong turn
somewhere along the way and winds up in
some far less pleasant place.
When the Blue Chalk Cafe went searching
for a name for its sister restaurant, a Tex-Mex
style eating establishment, they asked their
patrons for suggestions. A young customer,
apparently a fan off "that wascally wabbit,"

smeared ketchup all over his place mat and
wrote the words "Left at Albuquerque" in the
resulting mess. The kid must have a bright
future in marketing, as the owners snapped
up his idea.
Unfortunately for me, just before achiev
ing perfection, the restaurant often seemed
to take the wrong turn behind its name. It's
not that "Left at Albuquerque" isn't a pleas
ant place to have a good dinner at reasonable
prices — it is, as evidenced by my own expe
rience and the long waiting list that formed
soon after my friend and I took our table. But
the little things managed to frustrate my total
enjoyment of the evening.
Upon entering the restaurant, one is treat
ed to the bright and pleasant decor of the es
tablishment. The colors of the Southwest fill
your vision. Movie billboards of Western
flicks hang on the walls side-by-side with
oversized hats and cowboy boots. A great
deal of it struck me as too trendy, but it defi
nitely created a cheerful atmosphere.
We were seated immediately, which
robbed me of the opportunity to sample a
specialty margarita or an imported Mexican
beer at the bar. However, the bar soon be
came a popular spot as the restaurant filled
up and customers had to wait for a table.
I started off with the roasted corn and tor

tilla soup ($3.95). The rich, spicy blend of
corn and beans was the perfect starter and
served to tempt my taste buds with thoughts
of what was still yet to come.
For appetizers, my partner and I shared
the rock shrimp quesadillas ($6.95). They
were quite tasty. However, they didn't quite
taste how food from the old Southwest nec
essarily should. I was reminded of the
seafood joints of my ancestral New England
as 1 sampled this fare. Most of the appetizers
are less pricey at $3 to $7.
For my entree, I ordered the Gaucho
($6.50), a burrito filled with steak, spiced
potatoes and delightful assortment of vegeta
bles. It was very fulfilling — the portion was
large, the meat tender and succulent and the
potatoes excellent.
There was only one problem. All of these
goodies came tied up in a flour tortilla which
had a pigment matching that of a flamingo's.
While I enjoyed the innards of my meal, the
fluorescent pink wrapping on the outside
was disturbing.
My partner enjoyed her dinner more than I
enjoyed mine, probably because her burrito's
tortilla was a more traditional color. The Yu
catanian ($5.95), filled with chicken and rice,
was as pleasing to the eye as to the stomach.
Had we been hungrier, we could have

sated ourselves with any one of a number of
larger platters, ranging from $12 to $16,
rather than the single dishes, priced at an af
fordable $6 to $9.
Instead, to finish our dinner off, we par
took of Left of Albuquerque's delicious
deserts ($3 to $6). My friend sampled the
flan, while I had "The Adobe" — a scoop of
vanilla ice cream over an adobe-like cookie
material drenched in caramel.
Throughout our meal, the service was
friendly and cheerful, even when the restau
rant became so packed that our server had to
be everywhere at once. Our water glasses al
ways seemed to be full — something I defi
nitely appreciated when downing my burrito.
In the end, I exited "Left at Albuquerque"
fairly satisfied—except for those few minor ir
ritations. I recommend to anyone willing to
give a shot — perhaps your experience with
the pink burrito won't be as traumatic as mine.
