# Grub Focus on: Left at Albuquerque
## 
### Seth Goldstein 
Whenever Bugs Bunny has some free
time, he likes to vacation at Pismo Beach.
Unfortunately for the Warner Brothers rab
bit, he always manages to take a wrong turn
somewhere along the way and winds up in
some far less pleasant place.
When the Blue Chalk Cafe went searching
for a name for its sister restaurant, a Tex-Mex
style eating establishment, they asked their
patrons for suggestions. A young customer,
apparently a fan off "that wascally wabbit,"

smeared ketchup all over his place mat and
wrote the words "Left at Albuquerque" in the
resulting mess. The kid must have a bright
future in marketing, as the owners snapped
up his idea.
Unfortunately for me, just before achiev
ing perfection, the restaurant often seemed
to take the wrong turn behind its name. It's
not that "Left at Albuquerque" isn't a pleas
ant place to have a good dinner at reasonable
prices — it is, as evidenced by my own expe
rience and the long waiting list that formed
soon after my friend and I took our table. But
the little things managed to frustrate my total
enjoyment of the evening.
Upon entering the restaurant, one is treat
ed to the bright and pleasant decor of the es
tablishment. The colors of the Southwest fill
your vision. Movie billboards of Western
flicks hang on the walls side-by-side with
oversized hats and cowboy boots. A great
deal of it struck me as too trendy, but it defi
nitely created a cheerful atmosphere.
We were seated immediately, which
robbed me of the opportunity to sample a
specialty margarita or an imported Mexican
beer at the bar. However, the bar soon be
came a popular spot as the restaurant filled
up and customers had to wait for a table.
I started off with the roasted corn and tor

tilla soup ($3.95). The rich, spicy blend of
corn and beans was the perfect starter and
served to tempt my taste buds with thoughts
of what was still yet to come.
For appetizers, my partner and I shared
the rock shrimp quesadillas ($6.95). They
were quite tasty. However, they didn't quite
taste how food from the old Southwest nec
essarily should. I was reminded of the
seafood joints of my ancestral New England
as 1 sampled this fare. Most of the appetizers
are less pricey at $3 to $7.
For my entree, I ordered the Gaucho
($6.50), a burrito filled with steak, spiced
potatoes and delightful assortment of vegeta
bles. It was very fulfilling — the portion was
large, the meat tender and succulent and the
potatoes excellent.
There was only one problem. All of these
goodies came tied up in a flour tortilla which
had a pigment matching that of a flamingo's.
While I enjoyed the innards of my meal, the
fluorescent pink wrapping on the outside
was disturbing.
My partner enjoyed her dinner more than I
enjoyed mine, probably because her burrito's
tortilla was a more traditional color. The Yu
catanian ($5.95), filled with chicken and rice,
was as pleasing to the eye as to the stomach.
Had we been hungrier, we could have

sated ourselves with any one of a number of
larger platters, ranging from $12 to $16,
rather than the single dishes, priced at an af
fordable $6 to $9.
Instead, to finish our dinner off, we par
took of Left of Albuquerque's delicious
deserts ($3 to $6). My friend sampled the
flan, while I had "The Adobe" — a scoop of
vanilla ice cream over an adobe-like cookie
material drenched in caramel.
Throughout our meal, the service was
friendly and cheerful, even when the restau
rant became so packed that our server had to
be everywhere at once. Our water glasses al
ways seemed to be full — something I defi
nitely appreciated when downing my burrito.
In the end, I exited "Left at Albuquerque"
fairly satisfied—except for those few minor ir
ritations. I recommend to anyone willing to
give a shot — perhaps your experience with
the pink burrito won't be as traumatic as mine.

Talking to director
Terry Zwijzoff about the

I process of making
"Crumb" without having
actually seen the film is
about as frustrating as

pondering the paranor
mal with a true believer.
You know you're dealing with

controversial material and you should
probably have an opinion about it, but
you really can't, so you've got to take his
word for it.

But it's a beautiful day in South Park
San Francisco — a chichi strip in

the middle of the otherwise
industrial SOMA — and
searching for Zwigoff
amidst the lunch time 1
hordes of yapping figures, '
I'm willing to consider any
thing. 1 spot him — a nonde
script man built rather low to
the ground — sitting at a cafe

table alone.
When I ask him if we should conduct th<
interview over lunch, Zwigoff begs off, claim
ing that he's tired of talking about his film ani
wants to enjoy his meal. But by the time we'vi
finished eating, we've covered everythin;
from Crumb critics and production problem
to Zwigoff's ragtime music obsession. And
haven't even been recording.
Born and raised in Chicago, Zwigoff ha:
spent the past 20 years living in San Fran
cisco's Bernal Heights. An outsider to Sai
Francisco film circles, he has nevertheles:
made friends in high places — most notabh
David Lynch who ended up producin;
"Crumb."
"It's about what it's like to be different ant
not fit in,"says Zwigoff of "Crumb." "Some
times it can be an advantage. Not always o
course, but sometimes. I like Scorsese's worl
because of that. The 'Taxi Driver,' or 'The Kinj
of Comedy' — have you ever seen that?"
1 shake my head, no.
"It's a great film. A classic."
"What really made me want to do the filn
was talking to Robert's brother Charles,"
Zwigoff says quietly, squinting into the dis
tance. "He was a really talented and very
tortured man. I found him fascinating."
Soon after this encounter, Zwigoff set
himself out on a mission to convince
Crumb to make a movie about himself
and his tamily. "I found it to be a remark
able and mysterious story about art," he says.
Crumb's story resonates for Zwigoff who feels
that, among other things, he shares with the
artist "a common childhood vision of a night
marish America."
Zwigoff peers off in the distance, grum
bling about American society and its discon
tents. "I grew up in the 1950s which was a re
ally scary time because everything was so re
pressed. Everything was going on under cover,
but everybody's family was so fucked up. It
was one of the most scary times ever. No one
spoke to each other, there was no communica
tion except for in front of the TV. And you re
alize that all (this generation] wanted after the
war was this dull, excruciatingly boring life. I
felt so suffocated."
The director suggests that Crumb, who
constantly reveals the pathologies of his own
family through his work, often comes under
fire from those who can't handle his honesty.

"Crumb's art
is so fucking personal," he in
sists. "He's not afraid of dredging up his most
twisted feelings and putting them out there."
Zwigoff shot the footage for "Crumb" over
six years. When I ask him about the stamina it
must have taken to keep going, he quickly ad
mits to being obsessed with the material.
"That's the only way I could have kept going
after the first couple of years." After a moment,
however, he goes further.
"I was reading this article with Camille
Paglia. She was talking about how men and
women are different in that men have this
ability to focus on a minute little thing, in a
fetishistic way. You know how men can focus
on a white stocking or a red shoe, and obsess
over it?"
No. But keep going.
"Anyway, that's why there are so many men
who are great artists and not that many

women. At least that's what she says, and she's
often tull of shit. But, on some level, she does
have a point..."
After my talk with Zwigoff, I find myself at
a loss. Even though we've talked for about an
hour and a half, I still feel as if I don't know
what the man is about. He has told me that the
film reveals himself in many ways, and he's
pointed out his feelings of identification with
Crumb on more than one occasion, but who is
this Crumb guy anyway?
Seering social critic, as the Crumb press
package would package him? Father of the un
derground comic? Cult hero? The "Breughel
of the Twentieth Century?"

(omix Experience, a S.F. comic outlet in the
Haight, is the first stop in this journey. "Do
you carry Zap comix?" I ask the warm
faced Hells Angel type at the desk. "Sure," he
responds, indicating the extreme rear of the
store. "Over there in the underground sec
tion."
As I approach, I notice the overhead sign
reading "under 18 not allowed." 1 reach for
the first and 13th issues of Zap which hook
end the 27 year old history of the comic, and
alone at last, open the first issue....

seafood joints of my ancestral New England
as 1 sampled this fare. Most of the appetizers
are less pricey at $3 to $7.
For my entree, I ordered the Gaucho
($6.50), a burrito filled with steak, spiced
potatoes and delightful assortment of vegeta
bles. It was very fulfilling — the portion was
large, the meat tender and succulent and the
potatoes excellent.
There was only one problem. All of these
goodies came tied up in a flour tortilla which
had a pigment matching that of a flamingo's.
While I enjoyed the innards of my meal, the
fluorescent pink wrapping on the outside
was disturbing.
My partner enjoyed her dinner more than I
enjoyed mine, probably because her burrito's
tortilla was a more traditional color. The Yu
catanian ($5.95), filled with chicken and rice,
was as pleasing to the eye as to the stomach.
Had we been hungrier, we could have

sated ourselves with any one of a number of
larger platters, ranging from $12 to $16,
rather than the single dishes, priced at an af
fordable $6 to $9.
Instead, to finish our dinner off, we par
took of Left of Albuquerque's delicious
deserts ($3 to $6). My friend sampled the
flan, while I had "The Adobe" — a scoop of
vanilla ice cream over an adobe-like cookie
material drenched in caramel.
Throughout our meal, the service was
friendly and cheerful, even when the restau
rant became so packed that our server had to
be everywhere at once. Our water glasses al
ways seemed to be full — something I defi
nitely appreciated when downing my burrito.
In the end, I exited "Left at Albuquerque"
fairly satisfied—except for those few minor ir
ritations. I recommend to anyone willing to
give a shot — perhaps your experience with
the pink burrito won't be as traumatic as mine.

Talking to director
Terry Zwijzoff about the

I process of making
"Crumb" without having
actually seen the film is
about as frustrating as

pondering the paranor
mal with a true believer.
You know you're dealing with

controversial material and you should
probably have an opinion about it, but
you really can't, so you've got to take his
word for it.

But it's a beautiful day in South Park
San Francisco — a chichi strip in

the middle of the otherwise
industrial SOMA — and
searching for Zwigoff
amidst the lunch time 1
hordes of yapping figures, '
I'm willing to consider any
thing. 1 spot him — a nonde
script man built rather low to
the ground — sitting at a cafe

table alone.
When I ask him if we should conduct th<
interview over lunch, Zwigoff begs off, claim
ing that he's tired of talking about his film ani
wants to enjoy his meal. But by the time we'vi
finished eating, we've covered everythin;
from Crumb critics and production problem
to Zwigoff's ragtime music obsession. And
haven't even been recording.
Born and raised in Chicago, Zwigoff ha:
spent the past 20 years living in San Fran
cisco's Bernal Heights. An outsider to Sai
Francisco film circles, he has nevertheles:
made friends in high places — most notabh
David Lynch who ended up producin;
"Crumb."
"It's about what it's like to be different ant
not fit in,"says Zwigoff of "Crumb." "Some
times it can be an advantage. Not always o
course, but sometimes. I like Scorsese's worl
because of that. The 'Taxi Driver,' or 'The Kinj
of Comedy' — have you ever seen that?"
1 shake my head, no.
"It's a great film. A classic."
"What really made me want to do the filn
was talking to Robert's brother Charles,"
Zwigoff says quietly, squinting into the dis
tance. "He was a really talented and very
tortured man. I found him fascinating."
Soon after this encounter, Zwigoff set
himself out on a mission to convince
Crumb to make a movie about himself
and his tamily. "I found it to be a remark
able and mysterious story about art," he says.
Crumb's story resonates for Zwigoff who feels
that, among other things, he shares with the
artist "a common childhood vision of a night
marish America."
Zwigoff peers off in the distance, grum
bling about American society and its discon
tents. "I grew up in the 1950s which was a re
ally scary time because everything was so re
pressed. Everything was going on under cover,
but everybody's family was so fucked up. It
was one of the most scary times ever. No one
spoke to each other, there was no communica
tion except for in front of the TV. And you re
alize that all (this generation] wanted after the
war was this dull, excruciatingly boring life. I
felt so suffocated."
The director suggests that Crumb, who
constantly reveals the pathologies of his own
family through his work, often comes under
fire from those who can't handle his honesty.

"Crumb's art
is so fucking personal," he in
sists. "He's not afraid of dredging up his most
twisted feelings and putting them out there."
Zwigoff shot the footage for "Crumb" over
six years. When I ask him about the stamina it
must have taken to keep going, he quickly ad
mits to being obsessed with the material.
"That's the only way I could have kept going
after the first couple of years." After a moment,
however, he goes further.
"I was reading this article with Camille
Paglia. She was talking about how men and
women are different in that men have this
ability to focus on a minute little thing, in a
fetishistic way. You know how men can focus
on a white stocking or a red shoe, and obsess
over it?"
No. But keep going.
"Anyway, that's why there are so many men
who are great artists and not that many

women. At least that's what she says, and she's
often tull of shit. But, on some level, she does
have a point..."
After my talk with Zwigoff, I find myself at
a loss. Even though we've talked for about an
hour and a half, I still feel as if I don't know
what the man is about. He has told me that the
film reveals himself in many ways, and he's
pointed out his feelings of identification with
Crumb on more than one occasion, but who is
this Crumb guy anyway?
Seering social critic, as the Crumb press
package would package him? Father of the un
derground comic? Cult hero? The "Breughel
of the Twentieth Century?"

(omix Experience, a S.F. comic outlet in the
Haight, is the first stop in this journey. "Do
you carry Zap comix?" I ask the warm
faced Hells Angel type at the desk. "Sure," he
responds, indicating the extreme rear of the
store. "Over there in the underground sec
tion."
As I approach, I notice the overhead sign
reading "under 18 not allowed." 1 reach for
the first and 13th issues of Zap which hook
end the 27 year old history of the comic, and
alone at last, open the first issue....
Two teeny white guys named Itzy and
Bitzy meet each other, beat on each other,
laugh at each other and then call it a day. A

Whenever Bugs Bunny has some free
time, he likes to vacation at Pismo Beach.
Unfortunately for the Warner Brothers rab
bit, he always manages to take a wrong turn
somewhere along the way and winds up in
some far less pleasant place.
When the Blue Chalk Cafe went searching
for a name for its sister restaurant, a Tex-Mex
style eating establishment, they asked their
patrons for suggestions. A young customer,
apparently a fan off "that wascally wabbit,"

smeared ketchup all over his place mat and
wrote the words "Left at Albuquerque" in the
resulting mess. The kid must have a bright
future in marketing, as the owners snapped
up his idea.
Unfortunately for me, just before achiev
ing perfection, the restaurant often seemed
to take the wrong turn behind its name. It's
not that "Left at Albuquerque" isn't a pleas
ant place to have a good dinner at reasonable
prices — it is, as evidenced by my own expe
rience and the long waiting list that formed
soon after my friend and I took our table. But
the little things managed to frustrate my total
enjoyment of the evening.
Upon entering the restaurant, one is treat
ed to the bright and pleasant decor of the es
tablishment. The colors of the Southwest fill
your vision. Movie billboards of Western
flicks hang on the walls side-by-side with
oversized hats and cowboy boots. A great
deal of it struck me as too trendy, but it defi
nitely created a cheerful atmosphere.
We were seated immediately, which
robbed me of the opportunity to sample a
specialty margarita or an imported Mexican
beer at the bar. However, the bar soon be
came a popular spot as the restaurant filled
up and customers had to wait for a table.
I started off with the roasted corn and tor

tilla soup ($3.95). The rich, spicy blend of
corn and beans was the perfect starter and
served to tempt my taste buds with thoughts
of what was still yet to come.
For appetizers, my partner and I shared
the rock shrimp quesadillas ($6.95). They
were quite tasty. However, they didn't quite
taste how food from the old Southwest nec
essarily should. I was reminded of the
seafood joints of my ancestral New England
as 1 sampled this fare. Most of the appetizers
are less pricey at $3 to $7.
