# Of talent and torture: Terry Zwigoff explores the dark comic genius of Robert Crumb
## 
### Story by Aïda Croal Graphic by Peter Lagerquist 
bald, long-frocked, thick-bearded ex-taxi
cab driver from Pakistan stands in the middle
of the desert lecturing some poor slob on the
nature of human existence. A big-breasted
black wench is beamed onto a spaceship only
to be dropped into the waiting lap of a
spindly, speckled Crumb-type who kisses her
while proclaiming "it's love at first sight!"
Meanwhile, it's raining meatballs in L.A.
Welcome to the NC-17 rated world of R.
Crumb. It's a world where big breasts, thick
thighs and eeny weeny teeny little shriveled
little short dick men abound. It's a world in
which the "City of the Future" is a virtual
romper room of adolescent male fantasies.
Titillating and embarrassingly funny to
some and extremely offensive to others,
Crumb's ZAP comics are guaranteed to push
your buttons. After all, there arc few people
who would have nothing to say about the ex
plicit image of a father forcing his daughter
to perform fellatio on him, or of a leather
clad mother having sex with her son.
Where's the social commentary? you ask.
Well so did I. And at long last, when I got a
chance to see "Crumb," a few of these ques
tions were answered.
Robert Crumb, a tall gaunt man whose
dress code dates him somewhere in the
late '40s, confesses that he doesn't plan
his art. Instead, he uses his incredible talent
as a vehicle for whatever unconscious mater
ial might be lurking inside of him. Often, he

finds himself frightened
and disgusted by what
comes out.

As an adoles
cent, Crumb and
his brothers were
skinny awkward
nerds whom no
body wanted to
hangout with. El
dest brother
Charles who was
obsessed with
drawing comics,
drew the other two

into it as well. Hurt and angry at high school
girls for not recognizing him for the sensitive
guy he was, Crumb retreats into himself and
the world of his drawings.
Naked women abound in his sketchbook
as, in typical adolescent male fashion, sex
dominates his thoughts. From his infantile
passion for Bugs Bunny and his erotic exploits
on his aunts shoe as a kid, to the shame and
guilt surrounding his compulsive masturba
tion as a young adult, sexuality provides an in
finite resource for Crumb's artistic reservoir.
LSD is also a big part of his development. As
the story goes Crumb "took this weird drug
that was supposed to be LSD" in the late '60s
and much of the work that he is now famous
for (such as Fritz the Cat or Keep on Truckin')
was created during this time period.
Fortune and fame are soon to follow as
Crumb's spills out of Haight street comic
shop windows and into places like the Muse
um of Modern Art in New York. All of a sud
den he is in the limelight and the object of de
sire of many women. This transition, this re
venge as some might perceive it, is made very
clear in the movie. But old Robert is not in it
for the fame or the money and so finally, he
says "fuck it"and decides to start drawing the
"dark side" of himself.
It's a strange portrait of a social critic. In
fact, this sequence of events seems more like
ly to point towards to self-indulgence rather
than social criticism, no matter how devel
oped Crumb's talent is. In one scene in the

film, Crumb engages in a retrospective read
ing of one of his comic strips, as

signing meaning to images way
after the fact. This scene is
particularly interesting given
that, for the most part,
Crumb rejects responsibility

for the messages in his art.
When pushed on the ques
tion of misogyny in his work,

Crumb simply claims it as a
part of himself and insists that
he's got to express it because it's

the truth. Reflecting for a brief
moment, he offers the half-heart
url ciwinocti/tn fkif nnrW-inc hie

Ed suggestion that perhaps his
"pencils should be taken away" from
him.

Here is a man who, after
years of a tortured child
hood and adolescence,
has paid for the luxury

to examine, indulge
and confront his
own id in our

faces. At least this
is what his ad
mirers think.
Within the pa-

rameters of
"high" "un
derground"

and "pro
> vocative"
art, Crumb
can put his
I shit (literal-

ly) out there, way out there, and get paid for
it. Say what you will — and many people do
— about Crumb's art, it's his and he has to
take the heat for it.
Still, as an underground sensation, he an
swers to few. Revered by artist peers, anti-PC
activists and loyal readers alike, Crumb's
work is constantly defended without him
having to utter a word. Feminist critics like
former Mother Jones editor Dierdre English
— a vocal minority — are dismissed as spoil
sports and complainers who can't take the
heat and should therefore step out of the fire.
M an we say polarization? But to borrow the
I cliche, it's not so black and white. Even
\»though Crumb's art constantly evokes
the woman-hating and race-baiting strains
in our society, he at least is deeply ambivalent
about it. Zwigoff, on the other hand, roman
ticizes Crumb's psychological journey and
identifies with the disturbing artistic product
wholeheartedly. Claiming that Crumb sim
ply reflects what many of us are feeling,
Zwigoff insists that the work doesn't disturb
him. "People are very disturbed by the film,
his family and his art. I think it's funny."
Clearly this is an inside joke, because it's
hard to laugh at, say, young Crumb mastur
bating over his drawings and damned impos
sible to find humor in "Space Chick's" graph
ic rape at the hands of an "intergalactic
penis." Even though themes like alienation,
rejection and fears of not being accepted have
universal appeal, Crumb's particular take on
them docs not. He is not the artistic agent for
the expression of our hidden desires and psy
choses as a nation, as Zwigoff suggests. He re
flects a perspective — valid, yes, and certain
ly in need of examination — but only one.

Robert Crumb
Despite Zwigoff's dogged desire to make a
universal statement with Crumb's story,
what emerges is the recycled figure of the iso
lated artist — the misunderstood genius,
whose inability to make meaningful connec
tions with other human beings is taken as an
inevitable fallout.
On screen, it's obvious that Crumb has
mixed feelings about making the movie. His
sisters both refused to do it, and according to
Zwigoff, Crumb only agreed to the proposal
because he believed that the film, like his own
art, would remain underground.
"He's very dismayed at all the attention it's
getting with lines around the block in New
York and selling out in L.A.... I feel bad for
him now. I feel like I've sold him out or
something."
Crumb has been direct about what he
thinks of the film. Even though he refuses in
teract with the media, he and his cartoonist
wife Aline recently published a cartooned re
sponse to the film in The New Yorker. In the
strip, Zwigoff is by turns portrayed as a benign
opportunist and an evil puppetmaster who
used the Crumb family story to resuscitate his
sagging career as a director. Ironically, Zwigoff
was relieved when he saw the comic strip.
"I was surprised it wasn't worse. You
know, Crumb can be really vicious with peo
ple he doesn't like," but after a moment he
concedes a little dismay. "I didn't like being
made out to be the evil puppetmaster
though."

bald, long-frocked, thick-bearded ex-taxi
cab driver from Pakistan stands in the middle
of the desert lecturing some poor slob on the
nature of human existence. A big-breasted
black wench is beamed onto a spaceship only
to be dropped into the waiting lap of a
spindly, speckled Crumb-type who kisses her
while proclaiming "it's love at first sight!"
Meanwhile, it's raining meatballs in L.A.
Welcome to the NC-17 rated world of R.
Crumb. It's a world where big breasts, thick
thighs and eeny weeny teeny little shriveled
little short dick men abound. It's a world in
which the "City of the Future" is a virtual
romper room of adolescent male fantasies.
Titillating and embarrassingly funny to
some and extremely offensive to others,
Crumb's ZAP comics are guaranteed to push
your buttons. After all, there arc few people
who would have nothing to say about the ex
plicit image of a father forcing his daughter
to perform fellatio on him, or of a leather
clad mother having sex with her son.
Where's the social commentary? you ask.
Well so did I. And at long last, when I got a
chance to see "Crumb," a few of these ques
tions were answered.
Robert Crumb, a tall gaunt man whose
dress code dates him somewhere in the
late '40s, confesses that he doesn't plan
his art. Instead, he uses his incredible talent
as a vehicle for whatever unconscious mater
ial might be lurking inside of him. Often, he

finds himself frightened
and disgusted by what
comes out.

As an adoles
cent, Crumb and
his brothers were
skinny awkward
nerds whom no
body wanted to
hangout with. El
dest brother
Charles who was
obsessed with
drawing comics,
drew the other two

into it as well. Hurt and angry at high school
girls for not recognizing him for the sensitive
guy he was, Crumb retreats into himself and
the world of his drawings.
Naked women abound in his sketchbook
as, in typical adolescent male fashion, sex
dominates his thoughts. From his infantile
passion for Bugs Bunny and his erotic exploits
on his aunts shoe as a kid, to the shame and
guilt surrounding his compulsive masturba
tion as a young adult, sexuality provides an in
finite resource for Crumb's artistic reservoir.
LSD is also a big part of his development. As
the story goes Crumb "took this weird drug
that was supposed to be LSD" in the late '60s
and much of the work that he is now famous
for (such as Fritz the Cat or Keep on Truckin')
was created during this time period.
Fortune and fame are soon to follow as
Crumb's spills out of Haight street comic
shop windows and into places like the Muse
um of Modern Art in New York. All of a sud
den he is in the limelight and the object of de
sire of many women. This transition, this re
venge as some might perceive it, is made very
clear in the movie. But old Robert is not in it
for the fame or the money and so finally, he
says "fuck it"and decides to start drawing the
"dark side" of himself.
It's a strange portrait of a social critic. In
fact, this sequence of events seems more like
ly to point towards to self-indulgence rather
than social criticism, no matter how devel
oped Crumb's talent is. In one scene in the

film, Crumb engages in a retrospective read
ing of one of his comic strips, as

signing meaning to images way
after the fact. This scene is
particularly interesting given
that, for the most part,
Crumb rejects responsibility

for the messages in his art.
When pushed on the ques
tion of misogyny in his work,

Crumb simply claims it as a
part of himself and insists that
he's got to express it because it's

the truth. Reflecting for a brief
moment, he offers the half-heart
url ciwinocti/tn fkif nnrW-inc hie

Ed suggestion that perhaps his
"pencils should be taken away" from
him.

Here is a man who, after
years of a tortured child
hood and adolescence,
has paid for the luxury

to examine, indulge
and confront his
own id in our

faces. At least this
is what his ad
mirers think.
Within the pa-

rameters of
"high" "un
derground"

and "pro
> vocative"
art, Crumb
can put his
I shit (literal-

ly) out there, way out there, and get paid for
it. Say what you will — and many people do
— about Crumb's art, it's his and he has to
take the heat for it.
Still, as an underground sensation, he an
swers to few. Revered by artist peers, anti-PC
activists and loyal readers alike, Crumb's
work is constantly defended without him
having to utter a word. Feminist critics like
former Mother Jones editor Dierdre English
— a vocal minority — are dismissed as spoil
sports and complainers who can't take the
heat and should therefore step out of the fire.
M an we say polarization? But to borrow the
I cliche, it's not so black and white. Even
\»though Crumb's art constantly evokes
the woman-hating and race-baiting strains
in our society, he at least is deeply ambivalent
about it. Zwigoff, on the other hand, roman
ticizes Crumb's psychological journey and
identifies with the disturbing artistic product
wholeheartedly. Claiming that Crumb sim
ply reflects what many of us are feeling,
Zwigoff insists that the work doesn't disturb
him. "People are very disturbed by the film,
his family and his art. I think it's funny."
Clearly this is an inside joke, because it's
hard to laugh at, say, young Crumb mastur
bating over his drawings and damned impos
sible to find humor in "Space Chick's" graph
ic rape at the hands of an "intergalactic
penis." Even though themes like alienation,
rejection and fears of not being accepted have
universal appeal, Crumb's particular take on
them docs not. He is not the artistic agent for
the expression of our hidden desires and psy
choses as a nation, as Zwigoff suggests. He re
flects a perspective — valid, yes, and certain
ly in need of examination — but only one.

Robert Crumb
Despite Zwigoff's dogged desire to make a
universal statement with Crumb's story,
what emerges is the recycled figure of the iso
lated artist — the misunderstood genius,
whose inability to make meaningful connec
tions with other human beings is taken as an
inevitable fallout.
On screen, it's obvious that Crumb has
mixed feelings about making the movie. His
sisters both refused to do it, and according to
Zwigoff, Crumb only agreed to the proposal
because he believed that the film, like his own
art, would remain underground.
"He's very dismayed at all the attention it's
getting with lines around the block in New
York and selling out in L.A.... I feel bad for
him now. I feel like I've sold him out or
something."
Crumb has been direct about what he
thinks of the film. Even though he refuses in
teract with the media, he and his cartoonist
wife Aline recently published a cartooned re
sponse to the film in The New Yorker. In the
strip, Zwigoff is by turns portrayed as a benign
opportunist and an evil puppetmaster who
used the Crumb family story to resuscitate his
sagging career as a director. Ironically, Zwigoff
was relieved when he saw the comic strip.
"I was surprised it wasn't worse. You
know, Crumb can be really vicious with peo
ple he doesn't like," but after a moment he
concedes a little dismay. "I didn't like being
made out to be the evil puppetmaster
though."
