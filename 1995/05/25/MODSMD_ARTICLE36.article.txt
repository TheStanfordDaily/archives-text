## Mike Noren THURSTON MOORE Psychic Hearts 
### 
Compared to the high-voltage nois
escapes that Sonic Youth has generated
over the years, Thurston Moore's solo
album "Psychic Hearts" is surprisingly
low-key. Sure, there are still plenty of
scratching and screeching guitars and en
gaging atmospherics, but the sounds on
"Psychic Hearts" stay closer to the ground,
remaining somewhat isolated and under
stated within Moore's stream-of-con
sciousness pop.

Moore's songs are indeed
pop songs, though they're not
the kind you can sing along
to. From the Syd Barrett-like
ups-and-downs of "Queen
Bee and Her Pals" to the
noisy pep of "Patti Smith
Math Scratch," Moore draws
you in with confident guitar-

work, subtle hooks and off
beat lyrics, rather than

with radio-friendly
verses and chorus
es. "Psychic Hearts"
is catchy, but not
obviously so.
"Ono Soul" lays
biting melody over
a quivering feed
back hum, with
lines like "crayon

teeth draw blood"
adding to the expan
sive, spooky feel.
With one of the

album's few choruses, "See-through Play /
Mate" is similarly eerie but upliftingly so
â€” shifting gears and levels before falling
into a fun solo of Atari-like guitar effects.
Even the album's less spectacular mo
ments are still worth hearing. The so-so
title track starts as a quick, tough-talking
rocker before evolving into an awkward
love song. "Psychic hearts go out to you,"
Moore sings, ultimately assuring that "I
will always love you."

Shades of Sonic Youth-ish experimen
tation turn up throughout the album

(check out the 20-minute instru
mental finale "Elegy for All the

Dead Rock Stars"), but "Psychic
Hearts" is mainly a record to
relax to. The songs have sub-

stance, but the album's general
lightness makes this Moore's
breeziest work to date.

Long-time fans of Sonic
Youth masterworks like
"Daydream Nation" or
"Sister" might he disap
pointed with this

album's levity; but
taken on its own

terms, Moore's
"Psychic Hearts"
is a pleasant sur
prise, a very lik
able mix of innov
ative pop and ef
fortless charm.
