# BAD BRAINS
## God of Love 
### 
Bad Brains continue to push the limits
of sound and expression. Their newly re
leased album, "God of Love" is a reunion of
the original band, which broke up after the
release of "Quickness" back in 1988.
H.R. is back on the microphone, return
ing after a few years of punk-free reggae vi
brations. His devout new threads and in
spired vocalizations remind us all that the
Brains are the forefathers of modern elec
trified blackness. Bands like Living Colour
and Fishbone all find roots in the hard
hard-so-quick grooves of the Bad Brains.
"God of Love" is a collection of eclectic
jams that is essentially spiritual. The album
is an exaltation of the Rasta divinity Jah.
One of its slammingest grooves is a tune
called "Thank )ahH.R. blesses the deep
Zeppelinesque groove with a spacy repeti
tion of the words "Thank )ah," doubled by
a high harmonizer.
Bad Brains explore new musical territo
ries on this album, no longer simply alter
nating between their infamous hard core
and reggae jams. They play some metal
sounds that could move skyscrapers but

are not strictly incessant like their punk of
yesteryear.
They have also added the ballad dimen
sion to their sound. "Rights of a Child" al
ternates between a dreamy arpeggiated riff
and a melodious voice, all of which fuse
into a super hard metal breakdown and
then repeat as necessary. Their reggae has
evolved, too: They make use of electronic
rhythms with super low synthesized bass
drum sounds.
In with the new doesn't mean out with
the old. "Cool Mountaineers," the first
tune on the disc is quick straight punk,
with fresh vocal inflections that are airy
and elongated. All with the unusual
melodic sensibility that is distinctly H.R.
The combined rhythms of Dr. Know on
walls of guitar sound, Daryl Jenifer on bass
and Earl Hudson on skins have only be
come more mind-blowing. "Tongue Tee-
Tie" incorporates coordinated syncopa
tions that will send you reeling out on a
rubber band to be brought back just in the
nick of time.
Dr. Knows guitar playing is absolutely
searing as usual, drawing heavily upon
variations of the minor scale, particularly
some Middle Eastern flavors that send us
straight back to the Old Testament.
On the whole, "God of Love" is hype and
New York City honest. The album marks
the beginning of a new chapter in the story

of one of the greatest bands of this epoch. If
you plan on catching the Beastie Boys in
Oakland at the end of this month, you will
be lucky enough to catch the re-ignition,
sparked by opening act "Bad Brains."
