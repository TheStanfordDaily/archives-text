# THE CRUEL SEA
## The Honeymoon Is Over
### 
Whoever said that rock V roll is dead
needs to take a trip to Australia.
The Australian quintet The Cruel Sea has
released an absolutely astonishing collec
tion of songs and instrumental entitled
"The Honeymoon Is Over." The album is a
dark and heavy journey into the roots of
rock.
Blending blues, jazz, soul and reggae to
gether, the band produces a sound which
not only echoes rock's earliest moments,
but sounds surprisingly fresh as well. Obvi
ously heavily influenced by New Orleans
rhythms and delta blues, the album seems
to be drenched in Mississippi mud.
Kicking off with a scathing rhythm
workout, "Orleans Stomp," the albums first
track, is an enchanting instrumental which
nicely introduces the band's sound. The
percussion, drums and bass start by pound
ing out an addictive beat, which forms the
soul of the track. All additional guitar and
keyboards stem from this original sound,
and the effect is simply enthralling.
In addition, the songwriting is remark
ably well developed. "The Honeymoon Is
Over" and "Black Stick" are as catchy as
they arc impressive. None of the songs,
however, can be easily dismissed as pop.
Consistently dark and brooding, the album
demands the listener's attention. By retain
ing a shimmering beauty as well, the music
is unforgettable.
Rarely deviating from masculine postur
ing, the lyrics display little of the inspira
tion of the album's music. "Let's Lay Down

Here & Make Love," for example, displays
all the subtlety of a drunk sailor. Neverthe
less, songs like "Black Stick" and "Better
Than Love" show promise, suggesting that
the band can rise above its adopted artistic
level.
The singing, however, is a different story.
The two vocalists, Tex Perkins and lames
Cruickshank, possess a remarkable ability
to fit the lyrics with the rhythm. Often, such
as on "Naked Flame," a reggae style is in
corporated to help the vocals flow with the
music. Aspiring to heavy soul, the vocalists
sing low, deep and ragged, making how
they sing much more important than what
they sing.
With a remarkably sophisticated sound,
The Cruel Sea has created a very impressive
album, one that is not easy to forget.
