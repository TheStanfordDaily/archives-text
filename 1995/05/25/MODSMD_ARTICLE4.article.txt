# State senate approves new bill on hate crime
## 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
A bill aimed at expanding the legal defini
tion of a hate crime passed Tuesday in the
California State Senate by a 26-5 vote.
Senate Bill 911 is the "direct result" of
last May's vandalism of Stanford's "Gay
Liberation" sculpture, said Mike Bosia, con
sultant for the Senate Subcommittee on
Hate Crime, who works closely with the
bill's author, Sen. Milton Marks, D-San
Francisco / North Bay.
When the sculpture was vandalized last
spring by several Stanford students, the
Santa Clara County district attorney was un

able to charge the incident as a hate crime be
cause it was directed toward the property of
an institution rather than that of an individ
ual.
According to Bosia, the bill would create a
new category of hate crime to protect the
property of public or private institutions from
bias-motivated violence. Current law is limit
ed to individual victims or their property.
"The next time that statue is attacked
there could be hate-crime charges," Bosia
said.
"Stanford University, as a private institu
tion, has no sexual orientation, religion or
race and current hate-crime law requires the
victim to be selected on such a basis," said

Marks, a Stanford alumnus, in a statement.
"This bill would protect the property of an in
stitution, in this case, for example, when it is
attacked because of I its] association with and
support for specific students."
In addition to widening the definition of
hate crimes, the bill includes new penalties
for hate-motivated bombings or attempted
bombings. It would also allow the governor to
issue an award of up to $50,000 for unsolved
bias-motivated crimes.
Bosia said the five senators who voted
against SB 911 on Tuesday were all "conserv
ative, religious-right Republicans." The bill
was widely supported by Democrats, he said,
as well as Sen. Tom Campbell, a Republican

whose district includes Stanford.
SB 911 is currently in the state Assembly's
Committee on Public Safety. Bosia said that
in order for the bill to pass that committee at
least one Republican must vote for the mea
sure.
Last month, committee members defeated
another hate crime bill inspired by last
spring's Stanford vandalism by a 7-0 vote.
Authored by Assemblyman Byron Sher, D-
Stanford, the bill was intended to broaden ex
isting law to include actions against property
owned by entities such as Stanford and ac
tions directed at groups as well as individuals.
However, Bosia said SB 911 is
"substantially different" from
Sher's bill. For example, SB 911
adds three conditions of proba
tion — anti-violence counseling,
victim restitution and community
service — to the ethnic-sensitivity
training currently required of

criminals whose actions are
judged to be motivated by bigotry.
If passed in the Public Safety
Committee, SB 911 will move on
to the Assembly's Ways and
Means Committee, then to the
Assembly floor and finally to the
governor.
If the bill meets with approval
at all stages, it could be signed
into law by August, Bosia said.
The new law would then go into
effect Jan. 1, 1996.
