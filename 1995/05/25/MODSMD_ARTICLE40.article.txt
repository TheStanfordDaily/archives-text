## FAITH NO MORE Fool for a Lifetime 
### 
Faith No More (FNM) has gone from
sounding rare to rare with a vengeance.
While their latest effort "King for a Day,
Fool for a Lifetime" is not a total departure
from their former style, it has certainly
evolved into the more aggressive.

Part of catalyzing the alternative metal
band's stylistic revival, former axeman Jim
Martin was replaced by another guitarist
who has now left Dean Menta to fill his
space.
This membership trouble is more than
sideline information. It is reflected in the
style and feel of the album itself. The music
comes in aggressive and hard-hitting
spurts, reflecting the angst the band must
have felt. Some of the material is reminis
cent of the hardest punk — grungy vocals
hoarse with exertion, guitar tight and bit
ing— though always tempered with a bit of
FNM musicality. Unfortunately, this chaos
is less appealing than the more thoughtful
and carefully crafted tracks on the album.
"Caralho Vaodor" is one exception to
this grating aggression, and proves to be a
wonderfully stirring song, quietly pointing
to its lyrical target (a hit and run) in a way
more maniacal than violent. Vocalist Mike
Patton even speaks in Latin at one point,
creating a mood that suits the band's
strange style more aptly than militancy.
FNM masters the combative approach
on tracks like "Digging the Grave," where
Patton remains in command of his lyrics,
and keeps the sound of each instrument
distinct rather than melding the entirety
into a mosh pit of distorted excess.
But this style does not define the entire
feel of the album. A few tracks veer suspi
ciously into the neo-'7os renaissance and
represent some of the more creative por
tions of "King for a Day."
"Evidence," the third track, is one such
example. Beginning with short guitar
spurts and pulsating violins, this song has
the feel of a love ballad of yesteryear. Start
ing out tight, this track is filled with re
pressed energy and tension wrapped in a
smooth exterior.
Unfortunately, few tracks remind one of
FNM's classic "The Real Thing." When
they do hark back with tracks like " Fake
This Bottle," they strive to redeem an
album where half the tracks are quality and
the other half arc unappealing. The word is
that FNM produced too much material for
this album; unfortunately, they let a few
songs slip through the album could do
without.
