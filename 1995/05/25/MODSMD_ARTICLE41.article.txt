# KITCHENS OF DISTINCTION
## Cowboys and Aliens 
### 
Nearly all the songs on Kitchens of Dis
tinction's latest effort deal with the pain of
lost love — obviously a progression from
their first album in 1989, "Love is Hell."
Love is still hell in their fourth, "Cowboys
and Aliens," but this time it's the disillu
sionment and alienation (no pun intend
ed) of the aftermath that hurt the most.
Most of the songs on "Cowboys and
Aliens," while poignant and wistful, rarely
reflect any great heights of emotion. This is
partially due to the fact that singer Patrick
Fitzgerald's vocals are not particularly dis
tinctive. Smooth and innocuous, the clos
est they come to expressing rage is in
"Pierced" with the line "1 want to die really
really living," which actually has more of an
impact when it's read than the way it's
sung.
What is distinctive, however, is the
sound produced by guitarist Julian Swale.
Whether creating lush layers of sound or
just making pure electric noise, his chords
achieve the bold, ringing quality missing
from the vocals. Case in point: in "Remem
ber Me?" Fitzgerald's voice is succeeded by
a guitar riff that finishes off the chorus with
a descending spiral of triumphant, scintil
lating sound. The surging chords often re
verberate like the "stained glass laughter
peering through" on the song "Sand on
Fire," which opens with the clarion of
Swale's Telecaster. Fortunately, Swale is
given plenty of opportunity on the album
to explore the stratosphere and spark life
into songs with his arching hooks.
The lyrics on "Cowboys and Aliens,"
corresponding with the title, are alternate
ly mundane and otherworldly. They range
from the harsh reality of "when you're in
love / you have someone to hit," to the hal
lucinogenic images of "Come On Now"
where "... the evening / dresses my lips
with angel kiss / under lemon moons and
ice-cube licks." On the last song of the
album, the pensive "Prince of Mars," the
line "I'll get the pencils / we'll draw our
selves a new world" strikes home with the
simplicity of its childlike vision.
Kitchens of Distinction sounds a bit like
early U2, with its potent guitars and imper
ative lyrics. But without a really distinctive
lead singer, the group lacks one of the most
vital ingredients for success.
