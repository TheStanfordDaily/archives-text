# VARIOUS ARTISTS
## Livin' Lounge 
### 
Ever heard that gaudy, pathetic music
termed "Lounge" which seems to have
spawned in the seediest cesspools of Las
Vegas? If you haven't, you're lucky.
"Livin' Lounge," the latest compilation
of Lounge "hits" just released by Continu
um Creatio , should have been confined
to the studio. Labeled as a CD guaranteed

to "keep the natives from getting too rest
less" at your next "pool-side patio party,"
"Livin' Lounge" will have just the opposite
effect. Within seconds, your guests will be
sliding sneakily towards the door as they
mumble profuse excuses about the impor
tance of cleaning the mildew that's breed
ing in their showers.
The first track by The Wonderful World
of Joey, entitled "Get Outta My Gal," hints
at the wreckage to come. An awful mixture
of big band swing and a decrepit smoker s
voice, "Get Outta My Gal" virtually oozes
sleaze with banal lyrics like "get outta my
face / get outta my place / get outta my
cheese. I'm beggin' you please." Don't
worry, I'm already gone.
From there, things just get worse.
"Whiskey, The Moon, and Me," the eighth
track by Lovejones, further befouls the
term elevator music. Lovejones was obvi
ously consuming more than whiskey when
they composed this song. Trekkies will be
impressed, though — at one point Love-
Jones spontaneously hums the Star Trek
theme.
"Girl In A Martini Glass (The Menaced
Stripper)" by The Vice Royals eerily resem
bles a leftover from "Twin Peaks" with its
lengthy saxophone solo and vampish insin
uations. Although this track is perhaps a
little too upbeat to have made the cut for
that oppressively surreal TV show, "Girl In
A Martini Glass" nevertheless seems dizzy
ingly melancholic.
Perhaps the only two redeeming tracks
on "Livin' Lounge" are "Summertime," by
the Friends of Dean Martin and"The
Hanging" by The Lounge Lizards. "Sum
mertime" is an achingly slow remake of the
"Porgy and Bess" opera rendition. It's
swaying, lurching rhythms mesmerize and
simultaneously pacify. "The Hanging" is
conversely light, although it does maintain
somewhat of a disturbing edge in its jazz
melodies.
"Livin' Lounge" overall doesn't contain
the sounds of the "swingingest artists o
today" as the CD case unfortunately
promises, and it will not be the "answer to
your problem" or, for that matter, any of
your problems. It might, however, provide
a few moments of laughter and a comic di
version from that problem set.
