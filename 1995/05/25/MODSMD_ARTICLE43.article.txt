## Yuen Ping Low WIT AND WOUNDS BEHIND COMIC STRIP ARTIST 'CRUMB' 
### 
Sporting emphatically round-rimmed glasses, a perpetually
sunken chest and drooping shoulders, combed-back hair and an
untrimmed mustache that together approximate a clown's mask,
Robert Crumb redefines the notion of the renegade comic artist as
human freak-show. The six arduous years that director Terry Zwigoff
spent on interviewing and crafting revealing footage of his contro
versial friend have paid off more than handsomely, however.

In this film, the
Crumb persona is not i
the absolute center
around which all else re-

volves; more interestingly, it is the context of Crumb's existence that
makes for the challenging and comprehensive essence of Zwigoff's
treatment. Furthermore, even those less than familiar with the ex
tensive Crumb comic catalog could take comfort in Zwigoff's loving
quoting from relevant Crumb creative landmarks like "Keep on
Truckin' " and the confessional "My Troubles with Women."
The clearly dysfunctional Crumb household sets up a persuasive
basis for the artist's disdain for 19505-style family fascism that had
then spelled the American Dream of the dark ages of McCarthy. One
particularly challenging segment in "Crumb" discusses the objec
tions to and justifications for a specific set of panels in "Joe Blow,"
Crumb's 1969 cartoon subversion of pastel-perfect suburban idyll
by foregrounding father-daughter and mother-son incest.
That filmmakers gained access to interview Charles, Crumb's
suicidal older brother and fellow artist-cum-social critic, marks an
other coup. It's rich yet poignant in its detailed account of a tragic
soul alienated by the uncompromising strains of a solitary moral
voice, and the relentless demands a material world. In contrast, the
anemic portrayal of Crumb's relationship with his younger brother
Max, a painter, appears sketchy and in dire need of focus.
Owing to the intimate friendship between filmmaker and his
subject, Zwigoff is often successful in drawing out candid insights
into Crumb's intriguing psyche. The need for political correctness is
disregarded as Zwigoff refuses to shy away from detailing the artist's
unabashed fetish for amply-proportioned women; the opposing
views on Crumb's attitudes toward the female sex arc engagingly
edited with Crumb's assertion of his penchant for riding on the
backs of towering partners in bed.
"Crumb" turns out to be a documentary feature infinitely less
concerned with splashing blobs of technicolor curiosity across its
canvas, than with the minute brush-stroke that etches the land
scape of a complex, often unfathomable human mind.
