# 'KISS OF DEATH' TRANSCENDS SHOCK VALUE
## 
### 
"Kiss of Death." The title sounds
pretty cheesy, flaunting suggestions
of vampires wearing low cut dresses.
"Kiss of Death" is fluffy — an action
film about a fairly nice guy whose
luck redefines the boundaries of
bad. Yes, the plot is thoroughly cot
ton candy, but so is the movie's over
all effect — sweet and addictively
enticing.
Starring Nicholas Cage ("A Vam
pire's Kiss"), Samuel L. Jackson
("Pulp Fiction") and David Caruso
("NYPD Blue"), and written by
Richard Price ("Clockers"), "Kiss of
Death" doesn't need shock value. In
stead, it is (insert "monster trucks"
voice here) packed with superb act
ing, believable gangster-type and
government type characters, edge
of-your-seat intrigue and a sense of
humor.

Caruso plays Jimmy
Kilmarten (laws of nature
dictatc that actors with
bright red hair and eye
brows must have thor
oughly Irish names), a
small time criminal who,
after cleaning up his act
for a couple of years, gets
pulled back into the seedy
underworld doing an un
lawful favor for a friend.
Kilmarten goes directly
to jail without passing go,
and spends the first por
tion of the movie in this
unhappily incarcerated
state. However, the real
fun starts when he is re
leased on bail for his good
behavior. The DA, played
marvelously by Stanley
Tucci, wants Kilmarten to
frame Little Junior

(Cage), the leader of the city's crime
ring and one of Kilmarten's past col
leagues.
Cage, always a whimsical actor,
imbibes the role of Little Junior with
hordes of creativity. Beefed up Tor
the tough part, Cage spends his por
tion of the movie blowing away

hopeless victims and delivering dia
tribes on how he absolutely cannot
eat with metal silverware. Little Ju
nior's acronym, 8.A.D., and his "le
gitimate" job running a strip club
give Cage ample opportunity to use
his ferocious character as a vehicle
for stealing laughter.

Jackson plays the semi-good cop,
Calvin (no Ezekial here), with
enough realism to vanquish any
stereotypes of cops as exaggeratedly
stupid / hungry / corrupt / heroic
that might detract from the credibil
ity of the character.
"Kiss of Death" is not going to be
come a classic film. It will never find
itself on a double bill with
"Casablanca." A week after I saw it, I
was already forgetting some of its
major details.
Yet, "Kiss of Death" is at the top of
the action movie genre. It is not fake
and plastic, it contains no five-con
trast-filter black and white morality
lessons, the acting and plot are excit
ing, and it doesn't take itself too seri
ously.
