# 'DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE' OFFERS ENJOYABLE EXPLOSIONS, LAME FINALE
## 
### 
"Die Hard With a Vengeance" has
all the elements you would expect
from the third installment of the
saga of John McClane, New York cop
and enemy number one of interna
tional terrorists with fake accents.

Since the first two films have al
ready featured McClane (Bruce
Willis) saving the day in a Los Ange
les high-rise and a Washington, D.C.
airport, "Vengeance" offers a new lo
cale with lots of potential — New
York City. There's a new sidekick
(Samuel L. Jackson) to provide some
interpersonal tension, and a new bad
guy (Jeremy Irons) with a twisted
desire for revenge. And, of course,
there are lots and lots of explosions.
In short, "Vengeance" has all the
potential to be a great action movie,
and much of the film is solid. Unfor

tunately, its plot dies hard when the
audience expects it to really come
through — in the movie's finale.
"Vengeance" starts off with a
bang — literally. Evil terrorist Simon
is wreaking havoc in New York to
avenge the death of his brother,
Hans, who McClane dropped off a
building at the end of "Die Hard." A
few bombs go off and Simon chal
lenges McClane to solve elaborate
puzzles in order to stop others from
exploding. And while the New York
Police Department is trying to find a
device hidden in a school some
where in the city, the gang of bad

guys breaks into the Federal
Reserve of New York to at
tempt the heist of the centu
ry-
And if it wasn't for that
pesky John McClane, it
might have worked. Along
with his unwilling partner,
electrician Zeus (Jackson),
our hero tracks and finally

confronts the terrorists.
It's here where "Die Hard With a
Vengeance" falls apart. The audience
expects an action-packed finale with
McClane and Simon duking it out,
like the ending of the first film. They
don't get it.
Still, the action in "Vengeance" is
creative and enjoyable, and the tense
Willis-Jackson relationship — nei
ther really trusts the other but they
have to work together to survive —
is fun to watch.
I guess no sequel can live up to the
original.
