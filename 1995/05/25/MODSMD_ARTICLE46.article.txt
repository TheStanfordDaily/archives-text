## SPIRITED, SEXY TOMEI SHINES IN THE PEREZ FAMILY’ 
### 
Meet the Perez family. Juan Raul Perez (Alfred
Molina), who has spent his last 20 years impris
oned in Cuba, is finally liberated and sent to
Miami where his wife Carmela (Angelica Hus
ton) and daughter (Trini Alvarado) are waiting
for him. But when he gets off the boat, immigra
tion accidentally lists a prostitute / sugar-cane
worker refugee named Dottie (Marisa Tomei) as
)uan Raul's wife.

Thus, the stage is set for"The Perez Family," a
drama that unfolds with a great deal of humor and
a hint of tragedy. Director Mira Nair, internation
ally acclaimed for her previous films "Salaam
Bombay!" and "Mississippi Masala," goes straight
to the heart of her characters, who are round, fluid
and full of life. From the noisy, crowded streets of
Little Havana, Miami to sleepy suburbia, the cam
era takes us into each corner and crevice of the
world in which these Cubanos inhabit.
Despite the fact that the director is Indian and
the principal cast is Italian, Spanish, Irish and
Puerto Rican, the film manages to capture a very
strong ethnic flair. It inspires the imagination,
suggesting what it may have been like for refugees
in the 1980s, coming to America with big dreams
and high hopes only to find that they had ex
changed their Cuban jailers for American ones.
The real treasure of the film is Marisa Tomei,
who infuses the film with energy and vitality. Her
character Dottie is a saucy free-spirit whose love
for life is infectious and enveloping. It is in
evitable that Juan Raul (and the audience) should
fall in love with her. Everything about Dottie ex
udes sexuality and sensuality, and Tomei's com
plete immersion in her role blurs the line between
actor and character.
Next to Tomei's effervescence, Alfred Molina
appears understated and quiet. Yet Molina's
British-trained Shakespearean stage presence is
powerful and conveys great depth of emotion
through silence and action. Unexpectedly, Tomei
and Molina sustain a wonderful screen chemistry,
creating the pivotal, life force driving "The Perez
Family."
