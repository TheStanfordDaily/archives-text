Okay, so Audrey Hepburn
movies don't classify as new
video releases, but when one of
my roommates brought home
"The Children's Hour," I
couldn't resist having an Au
drey-fest.
Made in 1961, "The Chil
dren's Hour" was ahead of its

time in its direct
and painfully
real portrayal of
sexual discrimi
nation. Hep
burn co-stars
with Shirley
MacLaine as

Karen and Martha, two school
teachers whose lives are de
stroyed by one child's lie. When
Martha and Karen discipline a
student for misbehaving, the
vindictive little girl accuses her
teachers of lesbianism. The film
handles difficult issues with sen
sitivity and compassion, yet it is
gritty, gut-wrenching and trag
ic.
If you're looking for some
thing a little lighter, you can al
ways rent "Roman Holiday" —
one of my personal favorites.
Hepburn plays a modern day
princess, who rebels against her
state obligations by sneaking
out of the royal compound to
paint the town red. Inevitably,
the princess gets into trouble,
but she is rescued by — no, not
Prince Charming — but a
handsome American reporter
named Joe Bradley (Gregory
Peck), who sees through the
princess's guise but pretends
otherwise in order to get an ex
clusive news story. As expected,
a romance lurks right around
the corner, but the film's ending
isn't quite so predictable....
Princesses don't always live hap-

pily-ever-after.
In "Sabrina" a romantic
comedy, Hepburn is the chauf
feur's daughter who turns heads
when she returns from school in
Paris. David, a childhood crush
and the son of her father's em
ployer, falls hard for Sabrina,
but the family disapproves of his

love affair. Older
brother Linus
(Humphrey
Bogart) steps in
to lure Sabrina
away, and then
falls in love
with her him-

self. Audrey is quite the
chameleon — one moment a
naive, gauche girl and the next, a
sophisticated, beautiful woman
— and plays each role with
graceful ease. Though there can
be none like Hepburn and Bog
art, look out for the remake of
"Sabrina," starring Julia Or
mond and Harrison Ford.
"Funny Face" is a musical
comedy featuring Fred Astaire
as Dick, a photographer for
Quality fashion magazine who
decides that bookish Jo (Hep
burn) would be the perfect
spokesmodel for the magazine's
new image. So Jo gets whisked
off to Paris, where she is more
interested in hanging out in
cafes with beatniks than walk
ing down runways. The music
by Ira and George Gershwin is
catchy and colorfxil, and the cast
of characters are quirky and in
teresting. Hepburn doesn't
have the voice of a nightingale,
but what she lacks in singing
talent she makes up for in her
powerful stage presence. That's
probably what got "Funny
Face" four Oscar nominations
in 1956.
