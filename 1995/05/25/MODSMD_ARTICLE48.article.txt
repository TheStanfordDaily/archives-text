Crimson Tide
With an action-packed plot torn
from today's headlines, "Crimson
Tide" would have to work pretty hard
to disappoint. Still, in spite of its big
name cast and expensive special ef
fects, the movie fails to live up to the
standard of the contemporary sub
marine classic "The Hunt for Red Oc
tober."
The premise is promising: A radi
cal faction of the Russian army has
seized control of a nuclear missile
base, and its leader threatens to
launch at the United States. America
dusts off its Cold War survival manu
al and counters the threat with the
USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine
with seasoned captain Frank Ram
say (Gene Hackman) in command.
As usual, Washington turns in a
strong performance, and it's hard not
to like Hackman in his role as the in
tractable cold warrior. Still, the pair's
protracted power struggle is the only
conflict driving "Crimson's" plot. In
the end, that's not enough to make a
movie great.
This is not to say that "Crimson
Tide" is bad. The underwater effects
are amazing, and the depiction of life
aboard a submarine — incompre
hensible lingo and all — is still pretty
cool.

The Last Good Time
All non-NYC natives love a New York
story if it fits their romantic ideals:
Manhattan — the Woody Allen
White, Well-off, and upper West side;
or Mean Streets the glamour of
gangsters and drugs.
Based on the novel by Richard
Bausch, "The Last Good Time" is
neither of these, and is even set in
the decidedly unbeautiful Prospect
Park section of Brooklyn. Centering
around a May-December involve
ment, the movie stars Armin Mueller-
Stahl ("Avalon") as the 75-year-old
Joseph Kopple and Olivia D'Abo
("The Wonder Years") as 22-year-old
Charlotte Zwicky.
Violating traditional mores of pro
priety, this movie has been tagged as
a "European" film. But director Bob
Balaban tells the story without sugar
coating their pain.
Simple pleasures and daily rituals
hold talismanic power, but the effect
one person has on another is more
powerful still. "The Last Good Time"
embraces this wisdom and is fortu
nate in its talented cast, including
supporting actors such as Stander
and Pasdar.
It was a winner at last fall's Hamp
tons Film Festival for Best Picture
and Best Director.

Picture Bride
"Picture Bride" has all the mark
ings of what many would call a politi
cally correct film: minority actors,
women struggling against economic
exploitation and chauvinism, a
woman director scraping together
the funds for an entire film that
wouldn't pay one-tenth of what
Sylvester Stallone gets paid to mum
ble.
But best intentions do not always
result in the best of films. Starting off
strongly, "Picture Bride's" characters
and story drift in inexplicable direc
tions, draining a fascinating premise
of interest.
Liking neither her husband nor her
new lifestyle, Riyo — played by in
genue Youki Kudoh — must either
get tough and adapt or focus only on
returning to Japan.
Unfortunately, the script doesn't
develop this conflict with any intensi
ty. Instead the film feels stitched to
gether, with Riyo alternately seeing
how harsh or how good life can be,
making her final decision seem arbi
trary.
Although the faults are noticeable,
Kayo Hatta is a young filmmaker
whose dramatic sensibilities need
only be complemented by the proper
tools and a few more films.

Swimming With Sharks
"In Hollywood, one of the fastest
ways to the top is to work for some
one already there."
Fresh out of film school, and
poised on the threshold of Tinsel
town's inner sanctum, Guy (Frank
Whaley) begins work as Buddy's stu
dio. The initiation rites that greet the
hapless novice involve his boss' per
sonal arsenal of flying files, torpedo
pencils, and other vicious items of of
fice stationery-turned-ammunition.
Softening the blows of Buddy's
tantrums, is the attention that Dawn
(Michelle Forbes), a cool-cat, smart
as-hell producer, affords the shell
shocked Guy.
Writer-director George Huang's
hard-hitting debut rips away any pre
tension of human decency by the
power-hungry predators that inhabit
the big-time celluloid community.
The bones laid bare here — in the
shape of Buddy's leering and teeth
clattering skull — would send a chill
ing note down the spine of any grad
uating senior bound for the "indus
try" down south. Huang takes his
subject of interest farther than "The
Player" would dare contemplate.
Yes, in Huang's books, every hor
ror story you've heard about the soul
less state of Hollywood's art is all true.
