## Kristie LÃ¼ Stout Muzak for the masses: up to my eyeballs in commercial opiates 
### 
It wasn't the rank halitosis of that dental hy
gienist hovering over me that made me ill.
Nor was it the saccharine sweet tutti-frutti
flouride treatment that made my stomach
lining do the watusi. It was that frigging
poster on the ceiling. That frigging poster de
signed to make me forget about my two cav
ities. That frigging close-up of a seagull in
flight with a caption that read (in 102-point
Palatino):
"soar high."
Stuck in that circa 1968 authentic-vinyl
recliner, my eyes were fixed on that message
for a good half hour. 1 knew damn well what
was going on. It was my dentist's masterplot
to strap me down into that chair, to keep me
as captive as Shamu in a pyrex fishbowl.
In the Magic Mushroomed office of Dr.

Yoshida D.D.S., mass mediated "meaning"
slithered down my throat.
There's no poetry in that poster. Pulp
seagulls in your dentist's office aren't there to
be open to interpretation. The image behind
the caption is provided for you. No need for
imagination. No need for self-service. No
need to scooby-do-it-yourself. No need to
construct a meaningful experience upon it by
bringing to bear your own past experiences
and memories.
Just let your peepers do the walking.
Sit back and let it seep in. Soak in and ac
cept the common language: seagull poster =
tranquility. Likewise, Forrest Gump = good
American, anything Tarantino = cool
whipped, Armani = success, Kenny G neo
muzak = comfort, technology = good,

Fabio's left nipple = heightened galvanic skin
response.
These mass mediated equations are all you
need to define what's around you. They'll
take care of it all. They'll trigger specific defi
nitions, prime specific reactions and conjure
specific meanings.
By gum, it's the language of the masses! All
will make the same associations! All will un
derstand! User friendly! New! Now!
Nowspeak.
Let everything be entirely what the mass
media mandates it to be because there's no
room for difference. No room for nuance. No
room for irony. No su(b)tle humo(u)r. No
metapho(u)r. Just . Blatant.
Self-explanatory. Simple.
Got a problem? Follow the mass mediated

norm: Look up the answer in Life's Little In
struction Book. Got a lull in the conversa
tion? Look up some silence-filler in The Book
of Questions. Got a lacking wardrobe? Go
get Gapped. Got a bowl of cereal? Got a Host
ess cupcake?
Got milk?
The mass media is a reduction machine.
Multiple meanings are abridged to one. Mul
tiple possibilities are reduced to one. It wants
us to have the same sense of humor. It wants
us to have the same wardrobe. It wants us to
mumble the same response. It wants us to
have the same logic:
"soar high" = serenity.
When, in actuality, we should think:
"soar high" = some pathetic waste of
fontage.
