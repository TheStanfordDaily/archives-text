When Brad Curry tested HIV positive, he
was gratified to know that he would finally
die.
"I just wanted a way out," said Curry, 26,
speaking candidly after giving a presentation
entitled "Living with HIV" at 553 Mayfield
yesterday, one of several being held during
AIDS Awareness Week. "It wasn't about
pulling the trigger or wondering how much
drugs I needed. It was a way of suicide that I
actually didn't have to do anything about."
Asht'n Washington, 23, the other speaker
in the Living with HIV presentation, found
out he was HIV positive less than a month
ago.
"I was totally numb," Washington said,
describing his first reaction to the test result.
"I treated it as a distant problem. I made my

wandered into the military and eventually
ended up on the streets, hooked on drugs and
working as a prostitute.
"When I was sober enough on the streets
to tell the johns to use condoms, I didn't
care," he said. "I didn't care about dying â€” I
never asked to be here. What did it matter? If
there had been a birthday party for me and I
didn't show up, the party would have still
gone on."
Raised in a middle-class home by parents
who themselves abused drugs and alcohol,
Curry put his life together one piece at a time
by first conquering his drug habit.
Curry then attended a weekend confer
ence of young people infected with HIV in
March of this year. There, surrounded by so
many others like himself, Curry's life was
