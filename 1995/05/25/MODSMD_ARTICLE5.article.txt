# Learning to live with AIDS

### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
When Brad Curry tested HIV positive, he
was gratified to know that he would finally
die.
"I just wanted a way out," said Curry, 26,
speaking candidly after giving a presentation
entitled "Living with HIV" at 553 Mayfield
yesterday, one of several being held during
AIDS Awareness Week. "It wasn't about
pulling the trigger or wondering how much
drugs I needed. It was a way of suicide that I
actually didn't have to do anything about."
Asht'n Washington, 23, the other speaker
in the Living with HIV presentation, found
out he was HIV positive less than a month
ago.
"I was totally numb," Washington said,
describing his first reaction to the test result.
"I treated it as a distant problem. I made my
doctor's appointments, told my family,
friends and job. It's not a problem but a part
of me now."
Washington said that having HIV hasn't
changed his life appreciably. If anything, it's
given it a little more clarity.
"Now that I have it, I think of it as a bless

ing, sick as that may sound," said Washing
ton, who spends more time pursuing his in
terests in writing and painting. "How many
times do we go through life saying, 'I can do it
tomorrow' or 'I've got time for it later?' The
truth is you don't know that. Knowing my
status has given me the opportunity to get to
know me. You indulge in what's important."
After dropping out of high school, Curry
wandered into the military and eventually
ended up on the streets, hooked on drugs and
working as a prostitute.
"When I was sober enough on the streets
to tell the johns to use condoms, I didn't
care," he said. "I didn't care about dying — I
never asked to be here. What did it matter? If
there had been a birthday party for me and I
didn't show up, the party would have still
gone on."
Raised in a middle-class home by parents
who themselves abused drugs and alcohol,
Curry put his life together one piece at a time
by first conquering his drug habit.
Curry then attended a weekend confer
ence of young people infected with HIV in
March of this year. There, surrounded by so
many others like himself, Curry's life was
radically transformed.
"I was overwhelmed by all
these young HIV-positive people,
and the more I listened to them
the more I heard me," he said. "I
found I was not going through
my pain alone."
The presentation by the two
men — which was the second
time that Curry has talked about
his experience with HIV and
Washington's first — represents
the kind of straightforward talk
that they both advocate when dis
cussing the issue of prevention.
"You cannot force your
morals or opinions or your rules
on anybody else," Curry said.
"Knowing what I was like in high
school — and kids are worse now
than I ever thought — it doesn't
work to push them. Instead I
say, 'You want to do drugs? Then
this may or may not happen to
you.' "
Washington agrees and
argues that changing sexual
behavior cannot come from
authoritarian commandments.
"Re-education is a possibility
from the standpoint of showing
options and not giving laws," he
said. "We can give people choices
so they can save their own lives."
