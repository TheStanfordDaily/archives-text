# Campus signs get face lift

Campus directional signs are currently
being updated in response to student letters
to the President's Office and concerns from
administrators.
The "signs are in bad condition and not
very effective," said Tiffany Gravlee, a for
mer staff member in the Planning Office who
has worked on the project.
The contractor handling the job is Sign
Source of California, a San Jose firm.
"A combination of things prompted the
changes," said Michael Kuntz, an engineer at
the Department of Facilities Operations.
"Programs have been relocated and there
was concern about how well the signs worked
in 'way-finding.' "
According to Asst. Campus Planner Ekta
Gyani, the new signs will refer to specific
streets and the function of various buildings
rather than campus name for an area, as the
current signs do. "Instead of saying 'Campus
Center,' the new signs would be changed to
indicate what is actually in the campus cen

ter," she said.
Listing street names instead of vague
areas like "Library Quad" will "go along way
with finding things on campus," said Kuntz.
"We think these changes will make a signifi
cant difference."
He added that more than 200 signs are
being installed in the project, which is sched
uled for completion on June 2. About 40 of
the signs are new installations.
The Planning Office made the plans after
an extensive survey involving Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff.
Architect Susan Haviland was hired as a
consultant to help them identify the needs of
the new system, Gyani said. Haviland inter
viewed "a dozen groups of between six and 12
people each to get feedback about what
worked and what didn't," Gravlee said.
Gyani said the changes in directional signs
represent the first phase in upcoming devel
opments.
The second phase will involve "sprucing
up" street signs in a way more consistent
with the format Palo Alto follows.
