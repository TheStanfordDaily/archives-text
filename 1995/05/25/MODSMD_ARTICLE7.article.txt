# Governors stress state autonomy
## Federalism panel criticizes Congress 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Pushing for enforcement of
the 10th Amendment, four Re
publican governors yesterday
exhorted the federal govern
ment to transfer some of its re
sponsibilities to state and local
governments and make states
more accountable.
"If we could drive every gov
ernment service down to the
city council . . . that's where
they ought to reside," said Mon
tana Gov. Marc Racicot.
Racicot was joined by fellow
governors Pete Wilson of Cali
fornia, John Engler of Michigan
and Mike Leavitt of Utah as
their panel discussion closed a
two-day conference on "Revital
izing American Federalism" at
the Hoover Institution. Hoover
Distinguished Fellow and for
mer Secretary of State George
Shultz served as the panel's
moderator.

states," Leavitt said. "The solution
lies when states step up to the obli
gation."
The governors agreed that the
accountability of states needs to be
re-established. "Congressional
usurpations of state power has
undermined not only the federal
(government) but the basic democ
racy," said Wilson, whose speech
and hastily written comments
were read by Shultz. Wilson is still
recovering from throat surgery
performed last month.
A light moment occurred when
Shultz purposely said that Wilson
had approved a 15 percent tax
increase for California, prompting
Wilson to vigorously motion his
thumbs down before Shultz cor
rected his statement to a tax
decrease.
Wilson told the audience of
approximately 75 that federal
mandates are often given to states
without the financial resources to
implement them. He also said term
limits for U.S. Supreme Court jus
tices must be implemented.
"Life tenure guaranteed the
independence of the judiciary," he
said. "Regrettably, there is no
accountability."
Engler rebuked Congress, say
ing that if he were to change one
thing it would be "to prevent
Congress from mandating pro
grams on the states and not paying
for it."
"Congress wanted to keep all
the money and make all the rules,"
he said. "We wanted to get money
without strings. They said, 'here
are the strings and we'll keep the
money.' "
Engler said one reason to abol
ish the Department of Education,
currently being considered as bud
get debates continue in Washing
ton, is to restore funds and respon
sibility to the local level.
"Education is 95 percent local,
yet Ithe federal government would
like] to make 90 percent of the
rules," he said.
Leavitt, in concluding a mock
discussion with Federalists
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison
and Alexander Hamilton, said that
states could wield more power
through a meeting of the states,
not a constitutional convention. "A
constitutional convention is a legal
instrument," he said. "A confer
ence of states is a political tool."
