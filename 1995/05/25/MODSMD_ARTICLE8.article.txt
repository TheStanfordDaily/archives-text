# Some pain, gains mark ASSU's year
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
As ASSU senators examine the fruits
of their labor over the just-ended year,
they will likely discover that only a few
successful bills carried immediate posi
tive repercussions for the student body.
However, the possibilities exist for long
term benefits if current discussions
with the University persist.
Discussions at senate meetings this
year, which usually drew only slightly
more students than the number of bills

which were entertained, were at times
dominated by political bickering over
often insignificant constitutional is
sues, normally ending with angry sena
tors and bad press.
"The senate was as good as its com
mitment to students," said undergradu
ate senator Stephen Russell. "When we
focused on core concerns, we met with
great success. When we manipulated
the constitution, for the narrowest of
reasons, the senate became mired in
bickering and unproductive debate."
The success of the 25th Senate, many

senators say, lay in the discussions and
resolutions which occurred outside of
the meetings. The senate initiated
many important di.scussions between
students and the University. However,
the time spent courting administrators
may have decreased student-senate
contact.
"Senators have gone outside the sen
ate to take on projects," said Deputy
Senate Chair Michael Choo. "We've
tried to get senators out there working
on issues and implementing pro
grams."
The addition of a rival party
opposing the dominant People's
Platform party contributed to more
arguments and, at times, opposition
for the sake of opposition. However,
each major senate achievement
which has impacted or will impact
students received strong bipartisan
support.
The achievements
In mid-October, resident assis
tants approached Choo asking for
transportation to UC-Berkeley for
Big Game. Choo responded with
Bus Back the Axe, a program which
organized buses to and meals for the
game. Although the project cost the
senate around $200 and the Axe did
not return to Stanford, more than
850 students utilized the service.
The program has been the center
of personal praise by Choo and
other members of the People's Plat
form party, which, this year, was
rivaled by the newly-created Stu
dents' Alliance party.
A second achievement, many
senators agree, was the reformation
of the Stanford Fund policy, the
consequences of which will be felt
beginning next school year. In
September, the University imple
mented a policy requiring all stu
dent groups to solicit money solely
through the Stanford Fund.
In meetings with the administra
tion, student leaders told the Uni
versity that the policy was unaccept
able. In late November, the Univer
sity suspended the policy as it per
tained to student groups until a

committee could recommend a new
one.
In February, the committee
announced a mutually-acceptable
propositi which gave student groups
the option of earning money
through the Stanford Fund or by
themselves with guidance from the
Office of Development. Organiza
tions also can apply for exemption
from these policies.
"The Stanford Fund is a great
example where students put aside
political affiliations in order to nego
tiate a policy which benefited stu
dents, student groups and the Uni
versity," said Russell, a member of
the committee along with Choo, two
members of the Council of Presi
dents and four University adminis
trators.
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi said that the controversy
and subsequent change resulted
from protests by student groups.
A third achievement mentioned
by senators was their year-long fight
for special-fee reform, culminating
with the Common Sense Fee
Reform bill, which won overwhelm
ing student support in the ASSU
Spring General Election.
In a disputed vote, the senate
axlled a special election in January
for the Balanced Funding Deal, a
constitutional amendment aimed at
decreasing special-fee amounts by
abolishing the right to a fee refund.
Currently, the ASSU imposes a
buffer to account for possible
refunds.
This bill failed to gain the neces
sary two-thirds majority to enact a
constitutional change.
The second bill, the Common
Sense Fee Reform, won 74 percent
support from students in the spring
election. The bill was authored by
Jon Oram, Stanford-in-Govern
ment treasurer and member of the

COP-elect, as well as Speakers'
Bureau Director Scott Moss.
Sponsored by a bipartisan senate
contingent, the measure retained
the right to a fee refund while giving
student groups the option to seek
fees from undergraduates only,
graduates only or both.

"It stabilizes
the system and is
fair for both grad
uate and under
graduate groups,"
Kasrawi said.
"It's simple."
Undergradu
ate senator Andre
Vanier said the
reallocation of
space in the

Storke Publications Building was
one of the major successes for this
year's senate. Afler a fight with the
Stanford Chaparral and an attempt
to fire Publications Board Director
Danny Bressler, the senate and the
publications agreed to a mutually
acceptable plan.

The problems
Increased senate debate this year
led to long meetings with many sen
ators anxious to leave, sometimes to
the point of disregarding other bills
to complete the meeting.
And while Kasrawi has insisted
that debate is healthy and should be
encouraged, the senate often spent
more time debating its sweatshirt
policy than any other action item.
Senators constantly spoke out of
turn and meetings often included
jokes from throwing paper airplanes
and water fights to attempting to
impeach the senate chair, the latter
of which occurred yet again Tues
day.
Arguments over the controver
sial "sweatshirt rule," the results of

which have plagued the senate with
bad press throughout the year,
mandates that senators not wearing
their sweatshirt on meeting days
lose voting privileges.
Senators rebuked Kasrawi in
January when his enforcement of
the rule allegedly changed the out
come of the vote on the Balanced
Funding Deal, subsequently placing
it on the ballot for students in a spe
cial election.
Kasrawi admitted that the rule,
penned by former senator Sanford
Dickert last year, is "poorly written
and difficult to enforce."
"This did not have to happen and
should not have happened given a
consistent interpretation of the con
stitution and bylaws," said Russell,
an Alliance member. "The senate
loses its credibility."
In fact, the senate in two other
instances this year engaged in
lengthy debates over its interpreta
tion of the constitution.
One week before the state elec
tions in November, in the midst of
controversial debate over California
Proposition 187 — which denies
social benefits to illegal immigrants
— the senate passed a bill which
encouragtxl students to vote against
the initiative.
At the meeting and in the ensu
ing weeks, many senators — some
of whom were opposed to the propo
sition — claimed that passing the
senate bill violated the
"Bone/Overdeck Amendment" of
the ASSI/ Constitution which pre
vents the senate from taking stands
on matters not directly affecting
Stanford students.
Following the spring election last
month, senators and students criti
cized Kasrawi and the ASSU for not
forming a hearings committee to
investigate campaign violations.
Although there were many reported

violations, Hearings Officer Chi-
Ming Chien decided not to formally
investigate them through the con
stitutionally mandated procedure.
The senate easily certified the
election, despite the resignations of
one undergraduate and two gradu
ate senators. The meeting ended
with everyone blaming each other
for the hearings committee incident.
"There exists a belief that one
can sacrifice the rule of the constitu
tion in favor of legislative expedien
cy," Russell said. "That's not the
case. Every time you set the consti
tution aside to accomplish a goal,
the credibility of the entire senate is
undermined."
Currently, however, there is no
"violation" by the senate of the
ASSU Constitution because the sen
ate has the power to interpret its
own constitution. In essence, consti
tutional issues are determined by
the senate majority on every bill it
passes.
Judicial reform has been struck
down thus far this year, but both
parties insist that measures will be

proposed in next
year's senate.
Most recently,
attempts have
been made to cre
ate a judicial
review board con
sisting of students
or professors.
However, Choo
emphasized that

the senate not be judged "by sweat
shirts" and the actions of the sen
ate's Administration and Rules
Committee. "I don't think students
find relevance through these
issues."
Student apathy has also plagued
the senate this year, resulting in low
turnout at meetings and low stu
dent involvement in senate activi

ties. The results of an attempt to
increase class unity by creating
sophomore and junior class presi
dents and formals will be seen next
year. Last week's junior formal,
despite being free, drew only 75 peo
ple.
Graduate issues continue to pose
a difficulty to the senate, Choo said.
"It's always a problem to keep grad
uate senators engaged." Howev
er, graduate senator Donald Aing
worth claimed that although the
senate was "a failure" overall, there
were a few bright spots for graduate
students.
"Undergraduate senators real
ized they had to address their pro
jects to both communities," Aing
worth said.
Choo said that next year, the sen
ate and COP will work harder to get
graduate students involved.
The future
In its frequent contacts with the
administration, the senate has initi
ated several committees — working
groups, as some senators like to call
them — which, senators say, pro
vide a student voice on administra
tive action.
The coming year should bring
results from committees on post
office lease renegotiation and
Tresidder Union. For years, the
promises of a Taco Bell in Tresidder
and quicker mail service have been
high on candidates' platforms.
Russell maintained, though, that
the creation of committees is not
where pressure on the University
should terminate.
"When an issue comes up, the
end result of a negotiation should
not be a committee, it should be a
set result or goal," he said. "At the
ASSU, we have hundreds of com
mittees and very few solid results."

many important di.scussions between
students and the University. However,
the time spent courting administrators
may have decreased student-senate
contact.
"Senators have gone outside the sen
ate to take on projects," said Deputy
Senate Chair Michael Choo. "We've
tried to get senators out there working
on issues and implementing pro
grams."
The addition of a rival party
opposing the dominant People's
Platform party contributed to more
arguments and, at times, opposition
for the sake of opposition. However,
each major senate achievement
which has impacted or will impact
students received strong bipartisan
support.
The achievements
In mid-October, resident assis
tants approached Choo asking for
transportation to UC-Berkeley for
Big Game. Choo responded with
Bus Back the Axe, a program which
organized buses to and meals for the
game. Although the project cost the
senate around $200 and the Axe did
not return to Stanford, more than
850 students utilized the service.
The program has been the center
of personal praise by Choo and
other members of the People's Plat
form party, which, this year, was
rivaled by the newly-created Stu
dents' Alliance party.
A second achievement, many
senators agree, was the reformation
of the Stanford Fund policy, the
consequences of which will be felt
beginning next school year. In
September, the University imple
mented a policy requiring all stu
dent groups to solicit money solely
through the Stanford Fund.
In meetings with the administra
tion, student leaders told the Uni
versity that the policy was unaccept
able. In late November, the Univer
sity suspended the policy as it per
tained to student groups until a

committee could recommend a new
one.
In February, the committee
announced a mutually-acceptable
propositi which gave student groups
the option of earning money
through the Stanford Fund or by
themselves with guidance from the
Office of Development. Organiza
tions also can apply for exemption
from these policies.
"The Stanford Fund is a great
example where students put aside
political affiliations in order to nego
tiate a policy which benefited stu
dents, student groups and the Uni
versity," said Russell, a member of
the committee along with Choo, two
members of the Council of Presi
dents and four University adminis
trators.
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi said that the controversy
and subsequent change resulted
from protests by student groups.
A third achievement mentioned
by senators was their year-long fight
for special-fee reform, culminating
with the Common Sense Fee
Reform bill, which won overwhelm
ing student support in the ASSU
Spring General Election.
In a disputed vote, the senate
axlled a special election in January
for the Balanced Funding Deal, a
constitutional amendment aimed at
decreasing special-fee amounts by
abolishing the right to a fee refund.
Currently, the ASSU imposes a
buffer to account for possible
refunds.
This bill failed to gain the neces
sary two-thirds majority to enact a
constitutional change.
The second bill, the Common
Sense Fee Reform, won 74 percent
support from students in the spring
election. The bill was authored by
Jon Oram, Stanford-in-Govern
ment treasurer and member of the

COP-elect, as well as Speakers'
Bureau Director Scott Moss.
Sponsored by a bipartisan senate
contingent, the measure retained
the right to a fee refund while giving
student groups the option to seek
fees from undergraduates only,
graduates only or both.

"It stabilizes
the system and is
fair for both grad
uate and under
graduate groups,"
Kasrawi said.
"It's simple."
Undergradu
ate senator Andre
Vanier said the
reallocation of
space in the

Storke Publications Building was
one of the major successes for this
year's senate. Afler a fight with the
Stanford Chaparral and an attempt
to fire Publications Board Director
Danny Bressler, the senate and the
publications agreed to a mutually
acceptable plan.

The problems
Increased senate debate this year
led to long meetings with many sen
ators anxious to leave, sometimes to
the point of disregarding other bills
to complete the meeting.
And while Kasrawi has insisted
that debate is healthy and should be
encouraged, the senate often spent
more time debating its sweatshirt
policy than any other action item.
Senators constantly spoke out of
turn and meetings often included
jokes from throwing paper airplanes
and water fights to attempting to
impeach the senate chair, the latter
of which occurred yet again Tues
day.
Arguments over the controver
sial "sweatshirt rule," the results of

which have plagued the senate with
bad press throughout the year,
mandates that senators not wearing
their sweatshirt on meeting days
lose voting privileges.
Senators rebuked Kasrawi in
January when his enforcement of
the rule allegedly changed the out
come of the vote on the Balanced
Funding Deal, subsequently placing
it on the ballot for students in a spe
cial election.
Kasrawi admitted that the rule,
penned by former senator Sanford
Dickert last year, is "poorly written
and difficult to enforce."
"This did not have to happen and
should not have happened given a
consistent interpretation of the con
stitution and bylaws," said Russell,
an Alliance member. "The senate
loses its credibility."
In fact, the senate in two other
instances this year engaged in
lengthy debates over its interpreta
tion of the constitution.
One week before the state elec
tions in November, in the midst of
controversial debate over California
Proposition 187 — which denies
social benefits to illegal immigrants
— the senate passed a bill which
encouragtxl students to vote against
the initiative.
At the meeting and in the ensu
ing weeks, many senators — some
of whom were opposed to the propo
sition — claimed that passing the
senate bill violated the
"Bone/Overdeck Amendment" of
the ASSI/ Constitution which pre
vents the senate from taking stands
on matters not directly affecting
Stanford students.
Following the spring election last
month, senators and students criti
cized Kasrawi and the ASSU for not
forming a hearings committee to
investigate campaign violations.
Although there were many reported

violations, Hearings Officer Chi-
Ming Chien decided not to formally
investigate them through the con
stitutionally mandated procedure.
The senate easily certified the
election, despite the resignations of
one undergraduate and two gradu
ate senators. The meeting ended
with everyone blaming each other
for the hearings committee incident.
"There exists a belief that one
can sacrifice the rule of the constitu
tion in favor of legislative expedien
cy," Russell said. "That's not the
case. Every time you set the consti
tution aside to accomplish a goal,
the credibility of the entire senate is
undermined."
Currently, however, there is no
"violation" by the senate of the
ASSU Constitution because the sen
ate has the power to interpret its
own constitution. In essence, consti
tutional issues are determined by
the senate majority on every bill it
passes.
Judicial reform has been struck
down thus far this year, but both
parties insist that measures will be

proposed in next
year's senate.
Most recently,
attempts have
been made to cre
ate a judicial
review board con
sisting of students
or professors.
However, Choo
emphasized that

the senate not be judged "by sweat
shirts" and the actions of the sen
ate's Administration and Rules
Committee. "I don't think students
find relevance through these
issues."
Student apathy has also plagued
the senate this year, resulting in low
turnout at meetings and low stu
dent involvement in senate activi

ties. The results of an attempt to
increase class unity by creating
sophomore and junior class presi
dents and formals will be seen next
year. Last week's junior formal,
despite being free, drew only 75 peo
ple.
Graduate issues continue to pose
a difficulty to the senate, Choo said.
"It's always a problem to keep grad
uate senators engaged." Howev
er, graduate senator Donald Aing
worth claimed that although the
senate was "a failure" overall, there
were a few bright spots for graduate
students.
"Undergraduate senators real
ized they had to address their pro
jects to both communities," Aing
worth said.
Choo said that next year, the sen
ate and COP will work harder to get
graduate students involved.
The future
In its frequent contacts with the
administration, the senate has initi
ated several committees — working
groups, as some senators like to call
them — which, senators say, pro
vide a student voice on administra
tive action.
The coming year should bring
results from committees on post
office lease renegotiation and
Tresidder Union. For years, the
promises of a Taco Bell in Tresidder
and quicker mail service have been
high on candidates' platforms.
Russell maintained, though, that
the creation of committees is not
where pressure on the University
should terminate.
"When an issue comes up, the
end result of a negotiation should
not be a committee, it should be a
set result or goal," he said. "At the
ASSU, we have hundreds of com
mittees and very few solid results."


Choo


Kasrawi
As ASSU senators examine the fruits
of their labor over the just-ended year,
they will likely discover that only a few
successful bills carried immediate posi
tive repercussions for the student body.
However, the possibilities exist for long
term benefits if current discussions
with the University persist.
Discussions at senate meetings this
year, which usually drew only slightly
more students than the number of bills

which were entertained, were at times
dominated by political bickering over
often insignificant constitutional is
sues, normally ending with angry sena
tors and bad press.
"The senate was as good as its com
mitment to students," said undergradu
ate senator Stephen Russell. "When we
focused on core concerns, we met with
great success. When we manipulated
the constitution, for the narrowest of
reasons, the senate became mired in
bickering and unproductive debate."
The success of the 25th Senate, many

senators say, lay in the discussions and
resolutions which occurred outside of
the meetings. The senate initiated
many important di.scussions between
students and the University. However,
the time spent courting administrators
may have decreased student-senate
contact.
"Senators have gone outside the sen
ate to take on projects," said Deputy
