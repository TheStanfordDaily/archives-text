# Negotiators try to help the Directory
## Representatives hope to fix organization, finances 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
To dispel confusion surrounding the operation of
the Stanford Directory, representatives from the
University, the Directory and the ASSU have entered
into negotiations to clarify who runs the Directory
anu where its surplus revenue goes.
As part of the discussions, the ASSU has proposed
making the Directory a business project under the
control of the ASSU financial manager, said Rich
Stolz, a member of next year's COP and one of the ne
gotiators.
"We will take the Directory off the hands of the
University and make it a business project," Stolz
said. "As such the profits from the business project
will contribute to the Directory, the Publications
Board and other student publications as well as the
ASSU."
Steve Rosenbaum, 1995-96 Directory project di
rector, said he would like to see the Directory surplus
go to specific projects aimed at helping students.
If made a business project, the Directory would es
sentially continue to function in the same manner,
Rosenbaum said. However, "the ASSU would be re
sponsible for financial oversight of decisions made by
the Directory student management team, something
which the University does now," Rosenbaum said.
"The financial manager would not be involved in the
day-to-day operations."
If the proposal is adopted, the Office of Student
Activities — which currently oversees the publica
tion — will only have an advisory role and perhaps a
seat on a Directory advisory board, Stolz said.
The negotiations began as a response to allega
tions of tax fraud and abuse of authority by the Office
of Student Activities, Stolz said.
Because of confusion in the tax status of the Di
rectory, it has failed to pay proper taxes since 1989 —
the year it began making a surplus.
According to Nanci Howe, director of the Office of
Student Activities, the negotiations are taking place
"to clarify for the future what the direction and ex
pectations are for the Directory." Howe declined to
comment on details of the discussions.
The talks will also clarify whether the Directory is
part of the University or a student organization, said
Acting Dean of Students Jim Larimore.
Maintaining that the Directory is a student orga
nization, Larimore said the University is involved in
the negotiations "because we have had significant
oversight and have been responsible for the Directo
ry in past years. It is in our interest to make sure that
any changes in the Istatus of] the Directory are han
dled in an appropriate and thoughtful way."
The biggest obstacle for negotiators is assigning
responsibility for payment of Lake Lagunita's oper
ating costs, Stolz said. At this time, Directory sur
pluses fund lake operations.
"Currently, it is partially funded through Directo
ry surpluses, but we would like a more solid agree
ment about who is responsible," he said. "I hope that
the ASSU will not primarily [be the entity] that needs
to maintain any portion of the lake."
Stolz said he intends to resolve this problem by of-
fering to "pay for the lake for a
certain period of time," after
which the University and the
ASSU will come to a firm agree

ment about who will fund lake
expenses.
Another obstacle is whether
the Directory will have to pay for
use of the University database of
student names, Stolz said.
"As it stands, the Directory gets
access to the database for free,"
Stolz said. "The University may

require the Directory to purchase
access to the database. I don't
think the University needs to
charge the Directory. A lot of the
information is accessible anyway."
Stolz said he hopes an agree
ment will be reached by the end of
the quarter. "I cannot imagine it
taking too long," he said.
