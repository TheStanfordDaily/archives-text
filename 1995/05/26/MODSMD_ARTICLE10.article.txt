NATO bombs Serbs
TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Bosnian
Serbs answered a NATO airstrike yesterday with a
defiant barrage of shells aimed at government
held cities, including carnage that killed as many
as 70 people in this northern city.
Two shells landed in front of a cafe in Tuzla, the
largest government-held city other than Sarajevo,
hours after NATO warplanes struck near the
Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale.
Estimates of the death toll rose steadily
through the evening. Doctors initially said they
thought 20 to 30 people died, but Bosnian presi
dency member Ejup Ganic later put the toll at 50.
Tuzla, like the capital Sarajevo, is a U.N.-
declared "safe area" in which civilians are sup
posed to be spared attack.
NATO launched the air strike on Pale after
Bosnian Serbs ignored a deadline to return four

heavy weapons to depots. Under a NATO ultima
tum issued last year, all heavy weapons are to be
excluded from a 12.5-mile radius around Sarajevo.
Israel to leave Golan Heights
TEL AVTV, Israel (AP) — Israel is ready for a full
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the strategic
plateau captured from Syria 28 years ago, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres indicated yesterday.
But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin faces a
formidable obstacle: widespread opposition among
Israelis afraid of compromising the country's securi
ty.
Israel and Syria on Wednesday reached their first
breakthrough in three years of peace talks by agree
ing on broad outlines for security on the Golan.
But Rabin said there was no accord on where
the final border would be or how long an Israeli
pullout would take.
