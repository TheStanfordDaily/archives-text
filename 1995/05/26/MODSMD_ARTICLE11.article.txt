# Senate passes balanced budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Senate passed a mile
stone Republican plan yesterday that promises to halt
three decades of budget deficits and change the face of
government while leaving the door open for tax cuts.
Acting a week after the House endorsed a similar
budget-balancing outline, the Senate voted 57-42,
mostly along party lines, to wring $958 billion out of
federal ledgerbooks by 2002. The savings would be
forged chiefly from Medicare, Medicaid and dozens of
other benefits, and the elimination of 181 agencies
and programs, from the Commerce Department to
the Opera-Musical Theater Advisory Panel.
Senate passage marked Republicans in both cham
bers as favoring a sweeping down-sizing of the gov
ernment that has evolved since President Johnson's
Great Society and even President Franklin Roo
sevelt's New Deal.
Moments before pushing the bill through the Sen
ate, GOP lawmakers said they were doing it for the
nation's children, who would otherwise face huge
costs to pay off the nation's debt. They went out of
their way to taunt their chief nemesis, President Clin
ton, who has not yet proposed a balanced-budget plan

of his own.
"Today, the Senate will make a statement and
we'll make history in the process," said Senate Major
ity Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. "We will finally begin to
unpile the deficits. We will finally begin to speak for
the future. And we'll do it with one word: Leader
ship."
The vote put Republicans on a collision course with
Clinton and other Democrats. Clinton has vowed to
seek compromise, but only after the GOP drops plans
for tax cuts for the rich, higher levies for some poor
families, education cuts and Medicare reductions that
don't address other problems of the health-care sys
tem.
"The public will understand who is sacrificing and
who will benefit," said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. "This budget will be altered or it will
not become law."
Yesterday's vote also delivered an expected but sig
nificant personal political victory to Dole, whose pres
idential ambitions will hinge, in part, on convincing
conservatives that he is serious about cutting taxes
and slashing government spending.
