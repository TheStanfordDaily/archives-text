## Informing students 
### 
Departments should
give graduate applicants
facts on programs, jobs

When buying a car, cus
tomers need and get the
opportunity to test drive
it, look under the hood and kick
the tires.
When considering a medical
procedure, patients must be
fully informed about the risks
and benefits of the operation.
It's all part of being a smart con
sumer.
Students are the consumers
of higher education. If they are
to make an informed choice
about a college, they should
have as much information as
possible on the product — their
education.
With that spirit in mind, the
Planning and Policy Board of
the Faculty Senate last week
recommended that departments
at Stanford provide more infor
mation to graduate applicants
on life as a graduate student and
career prospects for Ph.D.s.
This is an excellent sugges
tion. It is one, indeed, that could
serve to benefit both students
and many faculty members.
This is not a new suggestion,
however. In 1975, the Commit
tee on Graduate Studies made a
similar suggestion and many
departments followed sttit. 1
At that time, for example, the
Classics Department warned
that "If you embark on a Ph.D.
program in classics, you should
do so for the sake of immersing
yourself more deeply in a sub
ject you love. If you set a high
premium on future security, you
might do well to think of some
other career."
Such information does sound
harsh, even a little intimidating.
But it is important for students
to hear, and important for
departments to forward to those
who are considering committing

six, eight or more years to pur
suing a doctorate.
That said, take notice that it
will not be an easy suggestion to
implement. Many departments
probably do not have this infor
mation on hand, and may not
have any easy way to gather the
information.
What is more, when the job
market is weak — as it is now —
some departments might be a
bit reluctant to give out the
information. In some areas,
especially the sciences, graduate
students play a crucial role in
aiding professors with their
research. If fewer graduate stu
dents are attracted to Stanford
and come here, that research
could become more difficult.
These concerns do not out
weigh the benefits, however. For
one, students will benefit having
a more clear picture of how long
on average it takes to get a doc
torate, how many people drop
out along the way, what finan
cial aid is available, what jobs
students must perform and how
many recent graduates have
found employment.
Of course, six or eight years
down the road the job market
may well be different, but stu
dents are smart enough to know
this. The information will let
them make better choices.
And what if the information
scares some students off? Well,
then, the most dedicated to
knowledge will remain. This will
help the profession as a whole.
It would also help the depart
ment, attracting only those stu
dents really dedicated to the
program. Getting fewer stu
dents might also help other
graduate students, as there
would be fewer competitors for
money.
Even if there are not fewer
students entering graduate pro
grams, the choices of potential
graduate students will be
stronger and better with more
facts on which to base their
choices.
