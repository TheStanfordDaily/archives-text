Commencement debate neglects the graduate students

THERE SEEMS TO be a perspec
tive missing in all the debate and
discussion surrounding the previ
ous cancellation of the commencement
procession, now affectionately referred
to as the "wacky walk." My impression
is that the majority, if not all, of those
who participated in the wackiness of
the procession for the past few years, as
well as most of those who protested the
cancellation, were undergraduates.
What seems to have been forgotten by
this group of people is that the gradua
tion ceremony, including the proces
sion, is not only for undergraduates.
There are as many, if not more, gradu
ate students, who have just as much
right to have a say in the way the grad
uation ceremonies are conducted.
Unfortunately, graduate students are

too often the silent majority — especial
ly foreign graduate students, who make
up a significant percentage of the grad
uate students.
I was told by some foreign graduate
students that they plan to skip the
main commencement ceremony and
just go to the departmental ceremonies
because they had heard of the inconsid
erate (from their perspective) behavior
that went on during the ceremonies,
and did not feel like subjecting them
selves and their parents to this display.
I find this sad because many of these
foreign graduate students have worked
very hard here at Stanford and have
made huge sacrifices in order to pursue
a graduate degree in the United States.
I feel they deserve to be able to have
pride in their school and to show it off

to their parents during the graduation
ceremonies.
I am not unsympathetic for the
desire of undergraduates to have fun
at their graduation. I graduated from
Stanford with a bachelor's degree in
1983 and a master's in 1984. But back
then (I'm beginning to sound like my
parents!) having fun meant putting
masking-tape messages on caps and
gowns, being able to march in with
friends and talk during the procession,
having helium balloons, wearing noth
ing under gowns except swimwear and
adorning caps with other creations (I
had my fun by putting large insect
eyes on my cap). But the chaos and
delay caused by the more recent dis
plays of "fun" not only seem to make
the procession of the faculty and the

graduate students seem less respect
ful, but also has made some graduate
students choose to skip the ceremony
altogether.
It may not be possible to please the
undergraduate and graduate popula
tions with the same ceremony, and thus
the administration may want to consid
er having two main ceremonies — one
with more leeway for undergraduates to
express their exuberance and one with
more pomp and circumstance for gradu
ate students. But until that happens, I
think the graduating seniors would do
well on graduation day to at least be
cognizant of the fact that the gradua
tion ceremony does not exist only for
them.
