# Student representation on the SCIR needed for more active proxy votes
## 
### 
Martin Arzac's May 23 letter to the
editor correctly identifies the heart of
the Stanford investment responsibility
issue: How can Stanford impact the
activities of the companies in which we
invest? More specifically, how can Stan
ford voice its opinions about allegations
of human rights violations and environ
mental abuses as a result of the activi
ties of Texaco and Unocal?
Arzac relates the traditional school of
investment thought to answer these

questions. Stanford's objections to the
activities of Texaco and Unocal will be
heard if we own shares of the compa
nies; divesting from these companies
strips Stanford's ability to impact those
activities. Unfortunately, Stanford has
not used its shareholder status to influ
ence Texaco or Unocal.
Stanford has an investment responsi
bility process which includes voting on
shareholder proxy issues — the way in
which, without divesting, Stanford can
use our shareholder status to influence
Texaco and Unocal. The Subcommittee
on Investment Responsibility (SCIR, a
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees)
wields the power to vote on these share
holder proxies, and the Advisory Panel on

Investment Responsibility (APIR) is the
research panel for the SCIR that recom
mends voting on shareholder resolutions.
With Texaco, the APIR recommended
the SCIR look at the proxy. No action
was taken on this issue by the SCIR.
With Unocal, a special meeting of the
APIR was called to recommend the
SCIR vote in favor of the proxy. The
SCIR abstained from voting on this
issue.
It is unfortunate that the investment
responsibility process which exists at
Stanford, a process which students such
as Arzac seem to favor, does not serve
the purpose for which it was established
— using shareholder status to influence
the activities of companies. It is sad that

students' voices, which brought the Tex
aco and Unocal issues to the attention of
the APIR, were not acted upon by the
SCIR. And it is alarming that Stanford
remained silent on the Unocal issue
despite various student groups' support
(Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford, the ASSU, The Stanford Daily
and the Stanford Review) and an APIR
recommendation to vote in favor of the
proxy.
As a result of this inaction, we urge
the Board of Trustees to appoint two
students to the SCIR.
