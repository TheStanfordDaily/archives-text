## So long, San Francisco 
### 
THIS YEAR at Stanford has been
a privilege and a pleasure. It will
be difficult to leave the place, but
the opportunities that have developed
have been the result of time spent
here.
A few years ago, I moved to the Bay
Area for shallow reasons. The city
itself, and northern California in gen
eral, were the most beautiful places I
had ever seen. If I had known earlier, I
would have tried to come out west for
college or law school or simply to hang
out. At an early age, I would have
laughed at the idea of settling some
place for the weather; perhaps later in
life, I will find it funny again. But at
this point, as I pack and prepare for a
cross-country change, even the quality
of the sunlight seems better here.
Californians rival New Yorkers in
their snobbery, in that peculiar pride
of place shown where sojourners and
immigrants make up the population.
Perhaps we have outdone our East
Coast compatriots, because there is
something so wonderfully taken for
granted about the attitude that, "Well,
we live in California, and what more is
there to say. ..."
It is easy to relax at Stanford in par
ticular, perhaps too easy to do so. The
golf course, the mall, the hike up to the
Dish, the Law School library closing at
5 p.m. on Friday and Saturday — these
features distinguish the University not

only from reality but also from other
colleges. Calling the campus a camp, a
country club or the Farm expresses the
uneasiness too easily.
I will miss much. Fog — as an act
and a concept, not a thing or mere
meteorological phenomenon — is love
ly. The motorcycle ride down from the
city to the campus, at night, with the
shifting sounds from the accidental
music of urban traffic to the calm of
Highway 280 to childhood memories
brought back by unseen crickets in the
fields — each accompanied by its own
smells, from hot exhaust fumes to
wood-scented cold air rushing by to
warm, pollen-inflected wild grass.
For better reasons, too, it is hard to
depart. San Francisco (Stanford less
so) provides a warped perspective on
politics. With notable exceptions,
almost everyone seems to be progres
sive, beyond "liberal" or political party
affiliations. People are engaged in the
world around them. The culture values
differences but does not assume them,
and encourages challenges to ortho
doxy, even where that orthodoxy is dis
sent. It is downright difficult to be
iconoclastic, or even to attract atten
tion. This is a rare environment where
I might pass for a moderate, or be
branded as one (doubtful, but maybe).
Still, the comfort of San Francisco is
a reason to depart. Last summer,
working on the campaign against

Proposition 187, I realized how out-of
sync this city by the Bay happens to be,
even compared to the suburbs, never
mind the outlying rural areas. Now,
watching the campaign against affir
mative action, so clever and cynical but
divisive and ultimately empty, I realize
how out-of-sync I, too, have become.
This summer, I join the faculty of
Howard University Law School, in
Washington, D.C. I meant it when I
said in my interviews there that I
would welcome a role within an insti
tution — one that has a genuine com
munity — which has had an important
mission historically and still has a sig
nificant role to play today. I also meant
it when I talked about "bridging the
gap" between the theory and the prac
tice of law, integrating traditional ped
agogy with innovative clinical training.
I tell myself I meant it, however, to
prepare for the challenge, to make a
public record of my private commit
ment to a cause and to have a reminder
of youthful optimism.
I wish I knew better where this
country was going.

Frank hopes to return to Stanford
someday.
