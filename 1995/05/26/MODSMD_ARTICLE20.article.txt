# Daily staff elects Katz' meow
## 
### Linésh Rätlieb Editorial staff 
The tall scarecrow-like figure
known for scrunchies and late
night grumpies last night
earned the highest insult known
to Daily staffers. Yes, Sarah
Katz was elected editor in chief.
After a campaign that broke
all the rules of good taste and
newsroom sobriety, Katz — who
has a penchant for ponytails,
southpaws and the occasional
Camel Light — triumphed over
write-in candidates Alvin and
Heidi Toffler, as well as fellow
managing editor Matt Gregory,
who shares a cozy little cubicle
with the new boss. At least,
until yesterday.
A paragon of grace known for
her ability to fall off sofas, Katz
accepted her dishonor with a
lengthy swig of cheap cham
pagne, blithely covering the
floor with foam. "Hey, don't let
it be said I didn't pay my dues,"
she said, bubbly dribbling down
her modest green full-length,
button-down sweater.
"Look, I have one thing to say
— I am the Establishment and
I'm proud of it. Listen to these
former positions: administrative
beat reporter; news features edi
tor; Off the Farm editor ..." Katz
rattled off, before berating news
editor Burt "I really didn't mean
to write three stories today"
Herman. "Oh, and from now on,
it's just 'Star Trek' in the Daily
lounge — none of this 'Melrose'
bullshit."
The leggy Katz stands an
imposing 6'6" and is the tallest
Daily editor on record. (Former
editor Elise Wolfgram has been
listed in some game programs at
6'7" but no one has seen her for
a while.) "We literally look up to
her," said Freshman Christian
Coalition Vice Commandant
Rachel K. Marshak, who
brought in a ladder to congratu
late the new chief. "It's a tough

job, but somebody has to do it."
Daily computer dork Thomas
Michael Weston "Axl" Slemmer
was philosophical about the
results. "I was looking forward
to the cushy on-line job," he
said, in reference to Gregory's
plan to take the "paper" out of
newspaper. "But I'm sure we
can put the editor's couch to
good use. I mean. . .
"I never expected to be the
first person from the junior
class to be elected editor," said
Katz, who discusses free-trade
issues with a friend named Max
and enjoys Fresh Taste sweet
and-sour chicken. "Hell, I never
expected to be the first person
from the junior class from Seat
tle to be elected editor."
Katz, known for her frequent
collisions on the softball field
(yes, Pulitzer Prize-winning
photographer Kim Komenich is
out of critical condition), takes
long dinner breaks while later
pretending she was in the photo
department.
"The truth is she changes our
leads too frequently, and she
won't buy us air conditioning,"
said prepubescent pals Brian "I
love the ASSU" Singer and Hus
sein "10-incher" Kanji, who
promptly fired off a three-page
grievance letter about election
violations, which everyone dis
regarded. They then imploded.
Current editor and Indiana
hick Andy Dworkin, the one
with the silly mustache, said he
was merely relieved the thing
was over. "As long as it wasn't a
tie,"he said. "And it wasn't as
bad as the last dual-managing
editor duel." Dworkin said he
now looks forward to working
on his jump shot and finishing
that pesky bottle of Jack
Daniels.
"All I know," said Dworkin, a
purported militia member and
disciple of Eastern svengali
Rajiv Chandrasomethin
gorother, "is that it's going to

be some banquet. Wherever
they stick us."
Katz did her celebrating in
the news office. "I just can't
seem to leave this placccccce,"

she said, slurring her words
after a few swigs of champagne.
"Or at least no one will go with
me. . . . Doesn't anybody liiiiii
ike me?"


Burt Herman — Daily
Slightly sloshed, Sarah Katz sets up to slurp her stuff, singing with
sweetly sensational sadness over her sorry state as the new editor
of The Daily.
