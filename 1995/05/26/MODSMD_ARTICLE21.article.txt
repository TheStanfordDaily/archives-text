## Baseball hopes for no major Shockers in Wichita 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
They say that one can stand in the center of a
wheat field in southern Kansas and, on a clear day,
see three other states over the flat plains.
The No. 15 Stanford baseball squad has its eyes
set on a goal just as sublime and picturesque.
Wichita, Kan., is the place. Tyler Field is the site.
Arkansas is the first opponent. The goal is to win the
Midwest I Regional, compete in the College World
Series in Omaha next week and win the national
championship for the first time since 1988.
"Our season has been up and down all year," said
junior catcher A.J. Hinch. "It's been a little disap
pointing at times and wonderful at times. It's an all
new season now and everybody's got records of 0-0.
I feel like we can match up with anybody in the
country, regardless of who or where we play."
The third-seeded Cardinal (34-22) will play the
No. 4 seed Razorbacks (38-21) today in Stanford's
first game of the double-elimination tourney. The
team will play again on Saturday regardless of Fri
day's outcome.
Stanford's regional, one of the eight across the
country this weekend, sports a field of six squads.
Joining the Cardinal and Arkansas is the top seed
Texas Tech (48-12), the host squad and second-seed
ed Wichita State (52-15), the No. 5 seed Lamar (36-
22) and sixth-seeded Providence College (44-13).
The Shockers nabbed the home field by virtue of
their play in the Missouri Valley Conference and a
long history of postseason success, and the comfort
of playing in the Kansas prairie could give them a
huge boost.
"Wichita State is always tough at home," senior
third baseman Steve Carver said. "But we've been
great on the road this year. I think we've got a good
chance to catch some people."
The Southwest Conference champion Texas Tech
Red Raiders are an offensive powerhouse, sporting a
.343 club batting average and having hit 72 home
runs during the year. Wichita State, while getting it
done at the plate, also brings four pitchers with an
ERA under 2.65 to the regional competition.
The Razorbacks started the season by winning 18
of their first 20 games before cooling off and finish
ing the season with 38 wins. Stanford started slow
before picking up the pace at the end of the season.
Arkansas finished fifth of six teams in the South
eastern Conference's Western Division with a 13-15
SEC mark but won its first two games of the confer

ence tournament to solidify a spot in the regional.
The Lamar Cardinals, one of a surprisingly high
three teams from the Sun Belt Conference, have
three starters batting over .340 and three pitchers
with an ERA under 3.00. The final team in the
region, the Friars, held their opponents to a .248
average at the plate. The Big East representative's
hopes largely rest on an ace right-hander with a 10-
0 record and 1.47 ERA.
Only one team will emerge from the regional pool
of six to compete in the World Series in Omaha. It
will take a great weekend of baseball for any team to
accomplish that in a field of high-caliber post-season
ball clubs.
"All of the regionals are pretty tough," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said. "Even teams that
aren't baseball powers by tradition are normally
playing their best baseball at this time. There is no
easy regional. You have to play well to win any
regional."
That is one reason why the Cardinal is wary and
well-prepared for a tough fight when they meet the
fourth-seeded Razorbacks today. The seedings are
often times either misleading or completely mean
ingless in the postseason, when adrenaline and emo
tion can overshadow the best records of the regular
season.
"Everybody is going to be competitive in this
environment," Hinch said. "The postseason seems
to bring out the best in a lot of teams, at least in the
top-caliber teams."
Stanford was ensured the three seed after win
ning 12 of its last 16 games. The Cardinal was hop
ing to get the second seed, but a season-ending
defeat at the hands of UC-Santa Barbara and an
unimpressive 14-12 non-conference mark put that
objective out of reach.
"The [bad] thing about being a three seed is that
you play a team that is right around where you are,"
Hinch said of the relatively similar skill levels of
Stanford and Arkansas. "It will be a challenge for
us."
But the Cardinal has lived through challenges all
season long and emerged only partially scathed.
Injuries to the squad's two top pitching prospects,
sophomore Jason Middlebrook and junior Dan Reed,
left Stanford scrambling for a steady pitching rota
tion and consistency on the mound. But the addition
of freshman ace Kyle Peterson (11-1) gave the pitch
ing staff a huge boost in its time of greatest need.

Sophomore right-hander Tom Reimers hopes to be on the mound in the late innings this weekend at the
Midwest I Regional in Wichita.
"We have had some adversity
during the year," Hinch said.
"We've had some guys banged up
at times and our pitching staff
has been a little sore. But it's time
now, the end of the season, when
you have to suck it up and play
through the injuries. We're pretty
healthy and ready to go."
Returning senior first base
man Dusty Allen also missed over
half the season due to injury. But
a strong freshman contingent
stepped up to the plate and has
kept the preseason No. 1 squad
from slipping into the ranks of
the has-beens.
"I feel good," Marquess said.
"We're playing our best baseball
now. We've had a lot of injuries
and we've been inconsistent, but
if we had to go play a regional this
is the best time during our season
to play it."
Stanford takes the momentum
the Cardinal built up in the past
few weeks into postseason play
after struggling for a stretch in
the middle of the season. The low
est point came in mid-April when
the squad dropped three straight
home contests to USC and had
lost six of nine contests. But the

latest run has culminated in a
healthier, more confident squad
ready to revisit the years when
Stanford's appearance in the
World Series was old hat. After
reaching the Big Dance six times
in a nine-year span, the squad has
not traveled to Omaha in June
since 1990.
"We were on the bubble in the
middle part of the season and
were struggling to get in the tour
nament." Hinch said. "It's good
to end the season on a high note,
be playing well and winning.
From now on every game could be
your last game."
Although Stanford has not
played any of the teams in its
regional this season, the Cardinal
has an 18-8 record away from
home and is 13-9 against ranked
opponents, as compared to
Arkansas' 9-13 road record. Stan
ford also posted a 20-10 record in
the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division, a league comprised
of two other postseason squads
and no easy opponents.
"Our league has prepared us a
lot for regionals. Our league has
been strong throughout the
whole season, from top to bottom.
That's going to help us."
The Cardinal will have one of
the intangible factors on its side.
The squad is led by a coach with
19 years of experience, compiling

a .649 winning percentage during
his reign. He has taken his squads
into regional competition 12 pre
vious times and to the World
Series six times. Marquess, who
boasts a 33-14 (.702) mark in
regional competition, will chalk
up his 50th postseason victory if
Stanford takes a game this week
end.
"You've got to like being in a
situation where you've got coach
Marquess, who has been in these
types of postseason games," Carv
er said. "He knows what to expect
and how to prepare you for
things."
Marquess suspects that Stan
ford will need to make regular
contact with the baseball this
weekend if it hopes to win the
regional.
"If we are going to be success
ful we'll have to win a few games
with the bat," Marquess said of
his team, which hit a combined
.297 during the season. "Your
pitching gets thin toward the end
and you have to rely on the bats."
The pitching rotation for the
regional competition is not set in
stone, but Peterson will make the
start on Friday against Arkansas.
Marquess suspects that junior
lefty Mike Robbins will take the
mound on Saturday barring any
bad match-ups the southpaw
might have with the opponent.
