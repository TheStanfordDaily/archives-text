## Baseball hopes for no major Shockers in Wichita 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
They say that one can stand in the center of a
wheat field in southern Kansas and, on a clear day,
see three other states over the flat plains.
The No. 15 Stanford baseball squad has its eyes
set on a goal just as sublime and picturesque.
Wichita, Kan., is the place. Tyler Field is the site.
Arkansas is the first opponent. The goal is to win the
Midwest I Regional, compete in the College World
Series in Omaha next week and win the national
championship for the first time since 1988.
"Our season has been up and down all year," said
junior catcher A.J. Hinch. "It's been a little disap
pointing at times and wonderful at times. It's an all
new season now and everybody's got records of 0-0.
I feel like we can match up with anybody in the
country, regardless of who or where we play."
The third-seeded Cardinal (34-22) will play the
No. 4 seed Razorbacks (38-21) today in Stanford's
first game of the double-elimination tourney. The
team will play again on Saturday regardless of Fri
day's outcome.
Stanford's regional, one of the eight across the
country this weekend, sports a field of six squads.
Joining the Cardinal and Arkansas is the top seed
Texas Tech (48-12), the host squad and second-seed
ed Wichita State (52-15), the No. 5 seed Lamar (36-
22) and sixth-seeded Providence College (44-13).
The Shockers nabbed the home field by virtue of
their play in the Missouri Valley Conference and a
long history of postseason success, and the comfort
of playing in the Kansas prairie could give them a
huge boost.
"Wichita State is always tough at home," senior
third baseman Steve Carver said. "But we've been
great on the road this year. I think we've got a good
chance to catch some people."
The Southwest Conference champion Texas Tech
Red Raiders are an offensive powerhouse, sporting a
.343 club batting average and having hit 72 home
runs during the year. Wichita State, while getting it
done at the plate, also brings four pitchers with an
ERA under 2.65 to the regional competition.
The Razorbacks started the season by winning 18
of their first 20 games before cooling off and finish
ing the season with 38 wins. Stanford started slow
before picking up the pace at the end of the season.
Arkansas finished fifth of six teams in the South
eastern Conference's Western Division with a 13-15
SEC mark but won its first two games of the confer

ence tournament to solidify a spot in the regional.
The Lamar Cardinals, one of a surprisingly high
three teams from the Sun Belt Conference, have
three starters batting over .340 and three pitchers
with an ERA under 3.00. The final team in the
region, the Friars, held their opponents to a .248
average at the plate. The Big East representative's
hopes largely rest on an ace right-hander with a 10-
0 record and 1.47 ERA.
Only one team will emerge from the regional pool
of six to compete in the World Series in Omaha. It
will take a great weekend of baseball for any team to
accomplish that in a field of high-caliber post-season
ball clubs.
"All of the regionals are pretty tough," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said. "Even teams that
aren't baseball powers by tradition are normally
playing their best baseball at this time. There is no
easy regional. You have to play well to win any
regional."
That is one reason why the Cardinal is wary and
well-prepared for a tough fight when they meet the
fourth-seeded Razorbacks today. The seedings are
often times either misleading or completely mean
ingless in the postseason, when adrenaline and emo
tion can overshadow the best records of the regular
season.
"Everybody is going to be competitive in this
environment," Hinch said. "The postseason seems
to bring out the best in a lot of teams, at least in the
top-caliber teams."
Stanford was ensured the three seed after win
ning 12 of its last 16 games. The Cardinal was hop
ing to get the second seed, but a season-ending
defeat at the hands of UC-Santa Barbara and an
unimpressive 14-12 non-conference mark put that
objective out of reach.
"The [bad] thing about being a three seed is that
you play a team that is right around where you are,"
Hinch said of the relatively similar skill levels of
Stanford and Arkansas. "It will be a challenge for
us."
But the Cardinal has lived through challenges all
season long and emerged only partially scathed.
Injuries to the squad's two top pitching prospects,
sophomore Jason Middlebrook and junior Dan Reed,
left Stanford scrambling for a steady pitching rota
tion and consistency on the mound. But the addition
of freshman ace Kyle Peterson (11-1) gave the pitch
ing staff a huge boost in its time of greatest need.
