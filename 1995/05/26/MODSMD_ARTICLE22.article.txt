# This time they're the favorites
## Sailors to vie for crown

This one's for all the marbles.
Stanford's women's sailing team
heads south this weekend to San Diego
for the Women's Fleet Racing National
Championship. The regatta represents
the climax of a season full of hard work
and endless preparation.
The No. 1 Cardinal enters the 16-
school field as the favorite. But seeding
and predictions are out the window in
this event because many a school is
known to use ringers, sailors that come
out of the woodwork at regionals and
surprise the competition. Other top
competition will come from east of the
Appalachians. Navy, Charleston, Tufts
and St. Mary's, Md. all expect to chal
lenge Stanford for the title.
Returning to the national champi
onship is bittersweet for the Cardinal.
Last year, the team entered the compe
tition with a No. 3 ranking but ended up
ninth in the standings. This year, what
is arguably the best women's team in
Stanford history is definitely shooting
for the sky.
"If we won, it would meet their
dream goals," said second-year coach
Steve Bourdow.
Stanford has taken key steps to

reverse its past fortunes. During spring
break, the team spent several days
training at the San Diego site, observing
conditions and gathering valuable data
on water preparation.
The three-day regatta will consist of
16 races in both the A and B divisions.
Sophomore A division skipper Alice
Manard feels the Cardinal's extra prepa
ration in San Diego will give the team an
advantage. Joining Manard as crew in
the A division boat will be junior captain
Sibyl Diver. Diver sees the weekend as a
great chance to demonstrate how far the
team has progressed.
"It's going to be an opportunity for
the women's team to pull together as a
whole," Diver said.
Junior skipper Cinnamon
Hampikian will team with freshman
crew Susan Bradford for the Cardinal in
the B division. Hampikian has
smoothed over some rough spots in her
sailing and has performed well recently
in practice. Junior Gretchen Uznis will
make the trip as a backup skipper and
freshman Noelle Marquis will be avail
able as skipper should breezes become
strong.
Bourdow has a specific set of goals in
mind for both Stanford boats. If Stan-
ford is to win, the coach believes
Hampikian and Bradford must
finish in the top three. The B divi
sion is expected to possess the
depth of the A division, so finish
ing in the top trio should be a
realistic goal.
In the more competitive A divi
sion, the Cardinal hopes to place
at least in the top five, if not bet
ter. Bourdow expressed confi
dence in his A division sailors
ability to fulfill their goal.
"They have to be in the top
five," Bourdow said. "That's
going to be a battle — I think
they can do it."
As a team, Bourdow feels the
keys for Stanford will be "superi
or starts" and boat speed. The
conditions in San Diego are usu
ally light to moderate winds. The
sailors' ability to adjust to shifts
in conditions with poise will be
pivotal.
