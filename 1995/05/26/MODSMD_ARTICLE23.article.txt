# Bloodthirsty Ultimate strives to Superfly for national title

Many modern historians suggest that
the course of human history can be traced
as a study of ferocious battles: David vs.
Goliath, the Crusades, the Hundred Years
War, World War I, World War II and now
this. In Urbana, 111., this weekend, the
Stanford men's and women's Ultimate
teams compete for the national champi
onship against the best layout artists and
disc hurlers in the country.
"This all feels like that new movie, the
'Best of the Best,' " said Stanford men's
team member Jay Clyne. "The conflict is
one of epic proportions, we're getting
everything ready to go, and I just think the
weekend will be an awesome display of
power, speed and ugly clothing."
Clyne, whose obsession with this recent
judo flick has infuriated his teammates,
nevertheless believes that Team Blood
thirsty, the sixth-ranked men's squad, is
traveling to the fields of Urbana with the
proper attitude.
"I have a good [karmic] feeling," Clyne
said. "We have good spirit, and we're going
to go out there and win on our terms. We'll
be 'at one' with the disc and the turf.'"
Team Bloodthirsty received a welcome
surprise yesterday, as three-year veteran
and sweet thrower Randy "Rando" Hulet

appeared at the team's final practice
despite spending the quarter in Kyoto, as
part of the Stanford program.
"The guy flew in from Japan for an Ulti
mate tournament," Stanford rookie Cabral
Bonner said. "I think that's ridiculous."
"1 have my priorities," Hulet said. "The
winds of Ultimate (the winds of Ultimate
are a spirit that Team Bloodthirsty
believes guides and orders the universe)
blew me back to Stanford, and I knew what
I had to do."
The Stanford men and women face
their first challenge this morning, as they
must fly to Urbana on the same plane as
their long-time enemy, the UC-Santa Cruz
Banana Slugs.
"What a cruel twist of fate," Hulet said.
"It's going to be a crazy flight. I wouldn't
want to be a flight attendant. There'll be
discs flying everywhere."
If Stanford can manage to stay alive
through the plane flight, they will likely
meet up with the Slugs again. Stanford's
Team Superfly, the upstart women's team
that has come out of virtual oblivion to
make the finals of two nationally-competi
tive tournaments and has climbed to No. 2
in the national rankings, has met the
Banana Slugs twice in tournament finals,
losing both times.
