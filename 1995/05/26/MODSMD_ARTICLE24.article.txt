# Golf up a notch but farther back
## McKay rebounds with 69 but Cardinal down 18 strokes 
### John Lawson Staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
golf team has definitely left itself a
challenge.
In order to bring its first-ever
NCAA title to the Farm, the squad
must dig out of a rather large hole.
By golfing its way to an 11-
over-par score 0f299 at the second
round of the NCAA Champi
onships in Wilmington, N.C., the
Cardinal is now 18 strokes behind
leader Arizona State with only
two rounds left to play.
The No. 1 and two-time defend
ing national champion Sun Devils
shot a 1-under-par 287 on the par
-72, 6,061-yard Landfall-Dye Golf
Course to increase their first
round lead from two strokes to
nine.
No. 5 Wake Forest fired a 291
to move into a tie with No. 3 San
Jose State, who shot a 294, for
second place.
Although its round was five
shots worse than yesterday's, the
Cardinal actually moved up one
spot into a fourth-place tie with
No. 13 Indiana. The Hoosiers,
who were surprisingly strong in
Wednesday's first round, faded
yesterday with a 302.
Following the Cardinal on the
leader board is No. 17 North Car
olina, who shot a solid 295 to jump
from eighth to sixth place.
Individually for Stanford,
sophomore Mhairi McKay, a First
Team Ail-American as a fresh
man, came back from a disap
pointing 77 Wednesday to post a
3-under-par 69 yesterday. By
accumulating five birdies on the
day, McKay moved from a tie for
51st to a tie for 13th.

"I was off to a good start today
after birdieing No. 2 and No. 3,"
McKay said. "That made a differ
ence. Overall, I hit the ball well
into the greens and putted a few
thousand times better than I did
yesterday. [Head coach] Tim
[Baldwin] helped me last night
with my putting stroke. Yesterday
was one of the worst putting
rounds I've ever had."
McKay's roommate, sopho
more Andrea Baxter, had been in
a tie for third after a 70 on
Wednesday, but a pulled back
muscle slowed her down yester
day. She fired a 2-over-par 74 to
move into a tie for eighth.
"Although we shot 11-over as a
team, we did have two tremen
dous individual performances
today," Baldwin said. "Mhairi dis
played the kind of golf we all know
she is capable of, and Andrea
played very well in battling the
pulled muscle in her back."
Senior Amy Lawrence hacked
her way to an 8-over-par round of
80 after posting a 73 Wednesday,
and her score, as the highest, was
not counted in the team's overall
result. Lawrence had her second
triple bogey in two days, this time
on No. 9, which capped off a 7-
over-par showing on the front
nine.
Senior Jamille Jose fired a 77,
giving her a two-day total of 153.
That score left her in a tie for
42nd, a position shared by
Lawrence. Like her senior team
mate, the front nine was haz
ardous to Jose's score yesterday.
Her adventurous 6-over-par first
nine holes included three double
bogeys, one bogey and one birdie.

Sophomore Ail-American Mhairi McKay rebounded
from Wednesday's 77 to fire a team-best 69 yesterday.
"It was a roller coaster ride," said
Jose about her two very different
nines. "After three doubles on the
front, I felt that I had to get it going
again on the back." She fired a 1-
under-par 35 after the turn.
Rounding out the scoring for the
Cardinal was junior Vicky Strada,
whose 79 today, coupled with her 75
Wednesday, put her in a tie for 53rd
at the midway point of the tourna
ment. She struggled at the 17th
(double bogey) and the 18th
(bogey), adding three shots at the

end of what would have been a
decent round.
"If we are to get back into the
hunt for the title, we are going to
need big-time performances from
both Vicky Strada and Amy
Lawrence," Baldwin said. "Nothing
less will do, and each has proven
they can do it from past perfor
mances."
San Jose State's Vibeke Sten
srud shot her second consecutive 3-
under-par 69 to lead all individual
scores. Her 138 is one shot better
than Arizona State's Kristel
Mourge d'Algue, whose 67 briefly
set a course record.
In third place is first-round co
leader Laura Philo of Wake Forest,

who followed up a 69 Wednesday
with a 71 yesterday.
Furman's Caroline Peek turned
in the most outstanding perfor
mance of the day. After a first
round 77, Peek blazed to an aston
ishing 7-under-par 65 to set a new
course record. Peek's 65 tied the
NCAA record for a single round,
which is shared by Georgia's now-.
LPGA star Vicki Goetze, who set
the mark during the fourth round
of the 1992 NCAA Championships.
Peek helped Furman complete
an amazing 36-stroke turnaround.
After golfing their way to the high
est score on Wednesday (319), the
Paladins rebounded with a day-best
score of 283 yesterday.
