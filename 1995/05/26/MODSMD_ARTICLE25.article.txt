# 'Expanding my horizons' with sports
## Managing editor Matt learns about Wooden, rubbers

I may be the only person at Stanford
who reads The Daily's sports section
in its entirety every single day. Or at
least, that's what my job description
says I do. My eyes have a tendency to
start wandering after reading the first
few sections of one of those 60-inch play

The thing is, I've never really been all

Baltimore Orioles and Washington Red
skins, but I don't watch "Sports Center"
during evety waking moment of vaca

stories about my days as a high school
athlete. Back at St. Albans, I played ten

nis. JV tennis, that is.
Yet, as managing editor for special
sections (there's a mouthful, eh?) at The
Daily, I'm expected to read and edit
every story the sports guys send my way.
Since I started the job in February, I've
learned all about women's basketball,
track and field, sailing and all the other
sports we try to cover.
You might say I'm expanding my
horizons.
It hasn't been easy. Early on, I'd
always be throwing questions over the
partition that separates my office from
the sports department. The sports edi
tors were as accommodating as they
could be.
"Hey Seth, what's a rubber match?"
"It's what you call the final game of a
series that is tied. You really don't know

what that means? I will physically kill
you."
Or, "Hey Stoner, who the heck is this

John Wooden guy?"

did you say? "Who the heck is this John
