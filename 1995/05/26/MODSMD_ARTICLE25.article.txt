# 'Expanding my horizons' with sports
## Managing editor Matt learns about Wooden, rubbers 
### 
I may be the only person at Stanford
who reads The Daily's sports section
in its entirety every single day. Or at
least, that's what my job description
says I do. My eyes have a tendency to
start wandering after reading the first
few sections of one of those 60-inch play
er profiles.
The thing is, I've never really been all
that into sports. Sure, I try to follow my
Baltimore Orioles and Washington Red
skins, but I don't watch "Sports Center"
during evety waking moment of vaca
tion — nor do I constantly check ESPN
Sportszone on the World Wide Web like
some sports fanatics (and Daily colum
nists).
And I certainly don't have any grand
stories about my days as a high school
athlete. Back at St. Albans, I played ten

nis. JV tennis, that is.
Yet, as managing editor for special
sections (there's a mouthful, eh?) at The
Daily, I'm expected to read and edit
every story the sports guys send my way.
Since I started the job in February, I've
learned all about women's basketball,
track and field, sailing and all the other
sports we try to cover.
You might say I'm expanding my
horizons.
It hasn't been easy. Early on, I'd
always be throwing questions over the
partition that separates my office from
the sports department. The sports edi
tors were as accommodating as they
could be.
"Hey Seth, what's a rubber match?"
"It's what you call the final game of a
series that is tied. You really don't know

what that means? I will physically kill
you."
Or, "Hey Stoner, who the heck is this

0
John Wooden guy?"
[Angered shock and dismay] "What
did you say? "Who the heck is this John


Rookie of
the Year
Matt
Gregory
Wooden guy?' The greatest college
basketball coach in the history of
the planet, that's who he is! Maybe
even the best in the universe. I
can't believe you don't know that.
What's up with that? That's just
wrong, man."
I think sports editors in general
watch a little bit too much ESPN.
Or, considering the lack of cable at
Stanford, at least dream about
"Sports Center" a lot. Still, at least
I know who John Wooden is now
— some coach from USC who won
a few games a while back.
There are, of course, the other
random things that you pick up as
a result of reading 300 sports sto
ries over the course of several
months. Like why there is both a
middle blocker and outside hitter

in volleyball. Or the difference
between an epee, foil and saber in
fencing.
But I still haven't been able to
solve the grandest sports mystery
of them all: why sports figures at
Stanford have some of the wacki
est, hard-to-pronounce, impossi
ble-to-spell names I've ever seen.
There's Jene, Salzenstein, Muli
tauaopele, Bleszynski, Schlukebir,
Fuerbringer, Folkl, Richetelli, Det
tamanti, VanDerveer.
Believe me, this doesn't make
life fun for an editor. It also seems
a bit unfair. I mean, really — does
the news department ever have to
deal with this kind of thing? OK,
"Condoleezza" isn't fun, but other
than spelling the name of our
provost, it can't be all that hard.

Matt knows that John W(X)den is
really from UCLA. Or maybe his
sports editor wrote this message so
he doesn 7 look stupid.
