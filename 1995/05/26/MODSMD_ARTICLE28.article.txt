# I am vengeance, I am the night

The problem with a secret identity is that
you're always hiding something. Accordingly,
none of those closest to you can ever benefit from
your abilities.
As a costumed vigilante I find this a recurrent
problem. Take, for example, the time I went to
the city with my roommate and some friends. We
were sitting quietly in a restaurant when some
big hairy guy started yelling and screaming inco
herently. He was obviously drunk and he began
threatening people. When he picked up a chair, I
knew there was going to be trouble.
My instincts told me to jump. My left elbow
rose in anticipation of his clavicle. In my mind I
rehearsed a modified, non-lethal version of the
dragon ax kick.
But I couldn't. I was with friends who knew
me and if I moved to action as I would alone at
night, I would be discovered. My head ached
with regret and when the chair flew across the
room — fortunately not hurting anyone — I
grabbed hold of my seat to quell the protective
instincts that would have given me away.
Within a few minutes the manager had the
man thrown out and everyone except the chair
was more or less well. But there I was, dripping
with sweat and feeling that I had done some
thing wrong in alkiwing a threat to take its own
course. After all, people I cared about were there
— what if one of my friends had gotten hurt?
Such is the irony of the superhero's life:
Those closest to you can never understand or
enjoy the powers you possess. You can save the
world week after week, but you cannot save your
friends without putting them at risk. Peter

Parker and I have discussed this at length.
It's the angst we endure for the thrill of the
fight. Occasional inner turmoil is the price I pay
for knowing I have saved an entire school full of
children from exploding into string cheese. I still
get letters from those kids.
It's tough sometimes, but it's a choice we
superheroes cannot afford to make for ourselves.
We recognize that not everyone can fly or scale
buildings or morph like some of us can.
And because we can, we must.
So when the police band radio says there's an
armed robbery in progress and hostages are
involved, the years of training take over and I
become a beast of instinct. Before I can feel it, I
am at the site, and three criminals are already
unconscious and bleeding internally. It's always
the last one that cracks, and I like to be right
there, to smell the fear when it happens. I like
the noises they make when their wrists shatter
in my grasp. I like giving them a last chance to
go for their gun and I like watching their expres
sions change when they don't reach it in time.
I like to think that it'll be that last time they'll
ever consider making such a move.
But invariably, they're back out on the drug
infested streets within a few months. And if any
of them could connect me to my pseudonym, all
my friends and family would be at risk for some
twisted scheme of revenge
In my youth I wanted so badly to become a
superhero. I suppose I am glad I followed up that
dream. But while it is exciting and keeps me in
good shape, I sometimes can't hjelp but wonder if
I'm making any difference — if it's all worth it.

It's hard to lie to people you aire for, even if it is
to protect them. And, except for the odd bomb
diffusing or foiled assassination attempt, I can
never be truly certain that I am saving anyone.
Maybe if I had become a doctor instead of a
vigilante I would have rescued more lives. Or at
least I'd be able to see that I had rescued them.
Or maybe just once hear thanks.
But that is not our job. We do not don Span
dex for personal gain. We do not wage war on the
forces of evil to boost our self-esteem. We each
have our reasons: for some it's responsibility, for
others revenge. Whatever it is, we endure.
It's all a part of the life: Sleep all day and only
be seen in true form after the sun's bedtime;
drink ginger ale in a champagne glass and let
everyone think that I'm a spoiled playboy; drive
flaming cars and leap from rooftop to rooftop;
always have a secret.
I might fantasize for a few moments of a nor
mal life, but being a hero is what I am — no
amount of angst can change that. And when the
night's chill blows icy through my cape and the
ledge from which I watch the city grows lonely in
the shadows, I am not moved. I rehearse in my
mind the excuse I will give to my mother for
being so exhausted the next day, and I listen to
the wind for screams.
