# Frosh yield increases
## Admission acceptance rate slightly higher 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Despite efforts to raise the freshman
yield rate — the number of freshmen who
accept admission — preliminary figures
from the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions indicate that the rate for this year's in
coming class has not changed significantly.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions James Montoya, the overall fresh
man yield rate rose to 55.8 percent — an in
crease of 1 percent over last year. The num
ber of Presidential Scholars who chose to
matriculate at Stanford also rose from 28.5
to 39.5 percent. Neither of the numbers,
however, are finalized.
The slight increase in freshman yield
comes after a University decision to re
design several programs to help Stanford
compete with other prestigious academic in
stitutions. A comparative admissions study
released by the Board of Trustees last year
showed that six out of seven freshmen ad
mitted to both Harvard University and
Stanford chose Harvard. Harvard has a
yield rate of about 75 percent.

This year, both the Presidential Scholars
Program and Stanford Admit Weekend —
formerly known as Prospective Freshman
Week — underwent changes intended to in
crease yield. In addition, an early decision
option will be implemented for next year's
applicants.
Montoya, however, said that the success
of the programs "cannot be measured in
terms of percentages," adding that "our pro
gram success is the statement it makes to
the outside."
"The success of the program must be
measured by academic quality of the class,"
he added. The number of Presidential
Scholars and the high SAT scores of admit
ted students show the strength of the in
coming class, he added.
Montoya also pointed to the Admit Week
end, which received positive feedback from
both parents and students. The weekend
brought nearly 1,200 students and 600 par
ents to campus, a 30 percent increase in par
ticipation, he said.

roughly 1,580 students. As of yes
terday, however, 1,618 students
had accepted offers of admission.
The number, Montoya said,
will probably drop as students
decide to defer admission, that
they lack the resources to pursue
a Stanford education or to do
something else.
Ten students have also been
offered admission from a waiting
list of 500, Montoya said.
Of the class itself, slightly more

than half are female students.
Considering that 53 percent of
students taking the SAT are
women, Montoya said this figure
is not surprising.
In terms of geographic diversi
ty, the incoming class will have
greater representation of stu
dents from New England and the
South. There will be fewer Cali
fornia students, down 4 percent
from last year.
Ethnically, the incoming class
is 7.6 percent African American,
12.2 percent Chicano / Latino, 1.7
percent Native American and 21.8
percent Asian American. The
numbers are all slightly higher

than last year's, except for the
percentage of Asian Americans,
which dropped 5 percent.
From the transfer class, 188
students were offered admission.
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Bill Tingley said the
University expects 145 students
to accept admission.
The number of non-traditional
transfer students is also up by
about 14 percent, Tingley said.
The age group of the transfer stu
dents ranges from teens and early
20s to the early 50s.
Montoya said these prelimi
nary statistics will be finalized in
September.
