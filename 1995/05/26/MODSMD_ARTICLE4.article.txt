# 'Voices for Justice' raised
## Coalition rallies for Affirmative Action, hosts teach-ins to spread awareness 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
In an effort to raise campus
consciousness about a possible
electoral threat to affirmative
action programs, the newly
formed Stanford Affirmative Ac
tion Coalition yesterday spon
sored a noon rally in White
Plaza.
The "Reaffirm Affirmative
Action Rally"— attended by
about 40 people — featured
speakers, reggae music and the
opportunity to sign the"Million
Voices for Justice" petition, an
effort to thwart the proposed
California Civil Rights Initia
tive.
If the proposed initiative gar
ners the needed $1 million in do
nations and 700,000 signatures,
it could go on the ballot in either
the 1996 presidential primary or
the November general election.

The initiative seeks to eliminate
all affirmative action programs
in California, including those at
public universities, according to
first-year graduate student Dori
Tunstall, a coalition organizer.
Tunstall — along with an
thropology graduate students
Falu Bakrania, Tom Boellstorff,
Robin Balliger and Peter Cha
vannes — formed the coalition
about three months ago in re
sponse to the initiative.
A series of teach-ins about af
firmative action in the Anthro
pology Building — the purpose
of which was to "dispel [the]
myths about affirmative action"
— followed the rally, Tunstall
said.
"People don't understand
what affirmative action is
about," she said. People think
that "affirmative action is taking

away jobs from white males."
Affirmative action "is not
about special preferences," she
said. "It's about timetables and
goals to create more diverse insti
tutions to reflect the diversity in
society."
One of the speakers at the rally
— which aimed at building a base
of undergraduate support — was

"People are being hoodwinked
because [they] hear about prefer
ences and think: prejudice," Ros
aldo said, referring to the tenden
cy of the general public to believe
that women and minorities who
benefit from affirmative action
take away the opportunities of
others.
Rosaldo went on to emphasize

that affirmative action does not
represent an effort to favor spe
cific individuals. Instead, he said,
affirmative action is something
that benefits everyone.
"It's about assembling a
team," Rosaldo said, using the
example of admitting a class to a
university. It serves "the inter
ests of the Republic of Stanford"
when the school admits a diverse
group of students, he said.
At a teach-in following the
rally, Sally Dickson — a lecturer
at the Law School and director of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment — discussed the idea of
implementing affirmative action
programs for the greater good,
emphasizing "group rights."
Dickson stressed that affirma
tive action is not a tool to guaran
tee the hiring of women and
minorities. Its purpose, she said,
is to make sure institutions are
"casting [the] net wide" in
recruitment efforts.
