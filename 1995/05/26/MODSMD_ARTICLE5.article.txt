# After three years Res Ed has head
## Jane Camarillo appointed new director 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
After a three-year hiatus, Resi
dential Education will have a full
time director in time for the 1995-
96 academic year.
Jane Camarillo, currently an
area director at UCLA, was named
director of Residential Education
yesterday.
"She's enthusiastic and (has)
done quite a bit of work in the field
of handling very serious situa
tions in which students find them
selves," said University Registrar
Roger Printup, chair of the search
committee. "She came across in
interviews as being calm and
strong at the same time — quali
ties that are useful to have."
The search committee nar
rowed the field of 30 applicants to
five finalists, Printup said. After
one of the finalists withdrew his
application, the committee nar
rowed their list of recommenda
tions to three.
The final choice was made by
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds in
consultation with University
President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Camarillo "seemed to have the
most support," Edmonds said.
In the face of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education's re
port, Edmonds said the director's

role will be focused on integrating
the residential environment with
the academy.
"With the [commission], one of
the things we wanted to expand
was some of the educational op
portunities in residences," Ed
monds said. "She seemed to be the
one who everyone, of the people on
the academic side, felt could do an
excellent job of building those
bridges between . . . the academy
and student affairs."
The selection process also ac
tively involved students. Junior
David Williams, a member of the
search committee, said that
"everyone's opinions were heard."
The selection process involved
open forums for all students, as
well as meetings held in resi
dences with both undergraduates
and graduates, Printup said.
"I received e-mail and comments
from people who had met the candi
dates," he said, adding that turnout
at the open forums ranged be
tween 10 and 20 students.
The delay in filling the position
was partially caused by a change
in the director's job description,
Edmonds said. Before budget cuts
caused the restructuring of the
Student Affairs office last year,
the job description for director did
not include the responsibility over
graduate residences, she said.
With the change, a new job search
had to be opened.
Alice Supton, who had been
director on a half-time basis,
resigned her post in April 1993 to
spend more time with her family.
A group of five finalists was

selected in October of that year,
but a final choice was never made.
Before moving to half-time status,
Supton held the position of full
time director for 13 years.
Camarillo holds both a doctor
ate and a master's in psychology
from UCLA. Her bachelor's, also
in psychology, is from the Univer
sity of Texas at San Antonio.
Camarillo was in Texas for the

holiday weekend, and could not be
reached yesterday.
Diana Conklin and Ann Por
teus shared the position as acting
co-directors until Conklin took a
job as manager of undergraduate
residential facilities in April. Por
teus will now return to her posi
tion as associate director of Resi
dential Education. Camarillo will
take over as director on July 15.
