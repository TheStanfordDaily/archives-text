# Accused students plead not guilty
## Lawyer says students' cases should be dismissed 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
In the third case this year involving Stanford stu
dents arrested for breaking into campus buildings,
four sophomores pled "not guilty" to misdemeanor
charges of trespassing yesterday.
Michael Ebstyne, Jonathan Garfinkel, Rebecca
Nesbitt and Rachel Rucker were found by police when
an alarm was tripped in the President's Office March
17.
At the time, the students were not arrested, but
the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office
later decided to file charges against them.
John Mendez, a San Francisco attorney represent
ing all four students, said that he expects the case to
be dismissed. "There's a good legal basis for dis
missal," he said.
Mendez told Judge Kenneth Barnum, who was sit
ting in for Judge Eugene Hyman in Department 42 of
the Palo Alto Courthouse, that he has talked to the
District Attorney's Office about the dismissal and is
working on the paperwork with them.
Supervising District Attorney Margo Smith was
out of the office and could not be reached for comment
yesterday.
The four sophomores said last month in court that
they had not entered Building 10 purposely. After ex
ploring the attics of the Quad for about an hour, the
only open door they could find inadvertently led them
to the President's Office.

Four sophmores deny guilt
in the March 17 break-in at
the President's Office.

In a case with similar circumstances, senior Clark
Bailey and junior Jose Alcorta pled guilty to charges
of misdemeanor trespassing on April 13 â€” receiving
sentences of informal probation and 100 hours of
community service.
At their arraignment, both Alcorta and Bailey told
the court that they had no malicious intentions and
were just "exploring" the Quad.
Alcorta and Bailey were caught on March 29 by an
alarm sensor that was installed primarily due to pre
vious incidents of trespassing.
The two groups of students found by police in the
President's Office gained entrance to Building 10
through attics in the Quad.
Mendez said that he was unfamiliar with the pre
vious case.
In another case, four Stanford students and one
alumnus, all affiliated with the Beta Theta Pi frater
nity, will have their preliminary hearing Friday for
felony burglary charges stemming from an alleged
break-in at the Stanford Museum.
