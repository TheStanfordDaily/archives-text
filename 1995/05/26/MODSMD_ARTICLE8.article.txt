The search for the Unabomber suspect has come
to the Stanford campus, with the FBI conducting
interviews and investigating campus machine shops
for leads in the case.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, FBI agents have been going to machine
shops around campus, searching for clues and show
ing composite photographs of the Unabomber sus
pect.
Interviews are being conducted at all college cam
puses in the Northern California area, said FBI
spokesperson George Grotz. "We've got several pro
jects going on to try and solve this thing and prevent
any further bloodshed," he said.
In a Dec. 10 bombing that killed advertising exec
utive Thomas Mosser, San Francisco State Univer
sity was listed as the return address on the package
containing the bomb.
Grotz said that he was "not at liberty to say exact
ly what we're looking at."
According to Niemeyer, agents have been seeking

information about outside individuals asking for
things to be made in various industrial shops around
campus.
"They basically went around and showed flyers"
with depictions of the suspect, he said.
"These interviews on the campuses are a logical
outgrowth" of the investigation, Grotz said. "Since
at least nine of his victims were associated with the
academic environment, it is only prudent that we
conduct some interviews" at college campuses.
Grotz said he hoped the interviews would
"heighten people's awareness," about the
Unabomber, and added that efforts are also being
undertaken by U.S. Postal Inspectors to inform peo
ple about the case.
Over the past 17 years, the Unabomber's explo
sives have caused three deaths and 17 injuries in 16
incidents. Eight of the incidents have been connect
ed with Northern California.
The UNABOM case gets its name from the fact
that early targets included universities and airlines.
The Unabomber's devices have been constructed
from wood and metal parts, and have become
increasingly sophisticated over the years.
