Freshman Jonathan Levitt may have just stepped
on campus this year, but on Monday he rose from a
field of 10 students to receive the 1995 Robert L.
Pierce Memorial Award.
Levitt will receive a $1,500 cash grant for the
1995-96 academic year to fund his student project.
"The Stanford Film Society."
"The award is intended to provide funding that
would otherwise not be available," said Kim Bluitt,
alumni relations program director for student activ
ities at the Stanford Alumni Association, which cre
ated and sponsors the annual award.
Levitt said he plans to use the grant to establish
a viable film society that will bring classic, foreign
and less commercially successful films to campus
auditoriums.
Mis project seeks to "expose other people to films
they wouldn't have otherwise seen," Levitt said.
In addition, the proposed film society hopes to
attract prominent figures in the film community to
campus, arrange student internships in the film
industry and mobilize the Stanford community to
lobby for more film studies courses, Levitt said.
Levitt added that next year the group will hold
monthly film series, focusing on specific directors,
actors or historical events.
Coming to Stanford, Levitt said he was looking
forward to joining a film society. However, he said

he found no group making film itself a primary con
cern.
The new organization will be an outlet where the
film will come first, Levitt said.
Enthusiastic about the chance to make his dream
a reality, Levitt is already at work. In a week or two,
he plans to post signs encouraging students to serve
on a board of directors for the future Stanford Film
Society.
However, Levitt emphasized that the coming film
society will not be eclectic. As a new organization,
students will have an opportunity to help create the
essence of the society through input and hands-on
work.
Levitt expressed his honor upon receiving the
award. "Looking at past winners, they have gone on
to lasting success and I hope to bring that type of
success on this project," Levitt said.
Past projects that have won the award include
the a cappella group Counterpoint, Project Smiles,
Hip Hop Night and last year's Full Moon Faerie
Tales.
The award was created to honor Robert L. Pierce,
who served as director of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation from 1956-70. Pierce left the association in
1970 because of a brain tumor. He passed away two
years later.
His deep interest in Stanford students and his
creative spirit are sustained in this award, Bluitt
said.
