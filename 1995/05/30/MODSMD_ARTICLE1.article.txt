# Student battles rare leukemia, needs marrow
## Sophomore awaits transplant 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
Evan Chen's room at Stanford Hospital is packed
with the signs of visitors: A shelf by the window strains
to hold up a neat stack of books, a stereo system and a
broad block of CDs, while nearby there are balloons,
flowers, a Nintendo game system and photos and
drawings of friends taped to the wall.
Chen, 20, a sophomore at Stanford who is leaning
toward a major in biology and "tossing around the
idea of med school," was hospitalized in early May for
a rare form of leukemia discovered after a routine
blood screening done at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter.
The first round of chemotherapy, begun immedi
ately thereafter, failed to eradicate enough of the
leukemic cancer cells, which tend to crowd out the
number of healthy blood cells normally found in the
bone marrow and spread to the bloodstream.
Consequently, Chen's doctors have pursued a sec
ond and more aggressive round of chemotherapy and
say that a bone marrow transplant is necessary. They
hope a transplant will provide him with healthy blood
cells to help him weather the effects of an intensive
chemotherapy regimen.
"The last couple weeks there's been nausea," said
Chen, who has been struggling against bouts of stom
ach pain recently and is debating whether he should
shave off the rest of his hair. "I don't feel like eating too
much, but my energy is pretty good. It's up there."
In a strange turn of events, Chen — who belongs to
the Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity — worked with the
Asian-American Donor Program, the fraternity's na
tional philanthropy, to type more Asian Americans for
bone marrow transplants in February of this year. The
fraternity plans to hold a drive for Chen this Thursday
in White Plaza.
Yul Kwon, Chen's roommate and a friend who has
known him since junior high school, has been spear
heading the search for a possible donor. A member of
Chen's fraternity, Kwon ran a bone marrow drive over
the weekend at the fraternity's national convention in
San Diego and has been calling on individuals to alert
him to any organizations in the Asian community that
might serve as possible donor pools.
Working in conjunction with the Asian-American
Donor Program, which is part of the National Marrow
Donor Program, and the Tzu Chi foundation, a Bud-
dhist organization akin to the
American Red Cross, Kwon has also
extended the search internationally
to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singa
pore, which also keep national reg
istries of possible donors on hand.
The fraternity has been circulat
ing numerous fliers advertising the
upcoming Stanford donor drive and
Kwon said he is hoping for a large
turnout.
"Stanford has a large Asian pop
ulation and all of his friends are
here," said Kwon, who is also orga
nizing a drive in San Francisco's
Chinatown. "There's a possibility
that someone outside the Asian

community could be a donor, but
it's more efficient to focus on typing
Asian donors."
Chen, who lives in Soto Hall in
Wilbur, attended high school in
Walnut Creek and walked on to the
varsity fencing team his freshman
year. As he drifts into the biology
curriculum, he's been trying to find
that "secret recipe" of balancing
school and extracurricular activi
ties.
"The material isn't that bad,"
said Chen, speaking of the competi
tive biology core. "But you screw up
one question and that drops you
halfway down the curve. I have a
tendency to be a little more of a
slacker. My study habits should be a
little more intense."
Everyone involved — including
Chen and his parents — has been

surprised and impressed by the
level of support that he has
received.
"I really see the quality of this
institution, including the doctors,
nurses and the student body," said
Wayne Chen, Evan's father, who
was especially appreciative of how
quickly members of the fraternity
mobilized to visit him and to work
on finding a donor. "Evan is very
private and quiet. He keeps a lot to
himself, doesn't express a lot of
things. That's why we believe his
friends mean a lot to him."
"The medical staff has been
great," said Chen's mother, Jiasie,
who has been educating herself
along with her husband about the
disease and locating others who
have gone through similar strug
gles. "His friends reallv count."
