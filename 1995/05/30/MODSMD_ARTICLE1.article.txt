# Student battles rare leukemia, needs marrow
## Sophomore awaits transplant

Evan Chen's room at Stanford Hospital is packed
with the signs of visitors: A shelf by the window strains
to hold up a neat stack of books, a stereo system and a
broad block of CDs, while nearby there are balloons,
flowers, a Nintendo game system and photos and
drawings of friends taped to the wall.
Chen, 20, a sophomore at Stanford who is leaning
toward a major in biology and "tossing around the
idea of med school," was hospitalized in early May for
a rare form of leukemia discovered after a routine
blood screening done at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter.
The first round of chemotherapy, begun immedi
ately thereafter, failed to eradicate enough of the
leukemic cancer cells, which tend to crowd out the
number of healthy blood cells normally found in the
bone marrow and spread to the bloodstream.
Consequently, Chen's doctors have pursued a sec
ond and more aggressive round of chemotherapy and
say that a bone marrow transplant is necessary. They
hope a transplant will provide him with healthy blood
cells to help him weather the effects of an intensive
chemotherapy regimen.
"The last couple weeks there's been nausea," said
Chen, who has been struggling against bouts of stom
ach pain recently and is debating whether he should
shave off the rest of his hair. "I don't feel like eating too
much, but my energy is pretty good. It's up there."
In a strange turn of events, Chen — who belongs to
the Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity — worked with the
Asian-American Donor Program, the fraternity's na
tional philanthropy, to type more Asian Americans for
bone marrow transplants in February of this year. The
fraternity plans to hold a drive for Chen this Thursday
in White Plaza.
Yul Kwon, Chen's roommate and a friend who has
known him since junior high school, has been spear
heading the search for a possible donor. A member of
Chen's fraternity, Kwon ran a bone marrow drive over
the weekend at the fraternity's national convention in
San Diego and has been calling on individuals to alert
him to any organizations in the Asian community that
might serve as possible donor pools.
