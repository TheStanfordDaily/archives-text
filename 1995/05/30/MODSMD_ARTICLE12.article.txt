Oklahoma bodies found
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The bodies of the last
three victims of the terrorist bombing were pulled
from the wreckage of the federal building yesterday,
a spokesman for the medical examiner's office said.
The bodies were believed to be those of federal
credit union employees Christy Rosas and Vir
ginia Thompson and Alvin Justes, a credit union
regular missing since just before the bombing.
The remains of one man and two women were
removed from the rubble between 4:30 p.m. and
5:30 p.m. but can't be immediately identified
because of their condition, said Ray Blakeney of
the medical examiner's office.
"The families were notified that the bodies were
recovered but there have been no positive identifica
tions at this time," Blakeney said. He said he didn't
believe there were any more bodies in the rubble.
The recovery of the bodies brought the death

toll from the April 19 terrorist attack to 168. Hun
dreds more were injured.
Stabbing at Harvard
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) â€” Sinedu Tadesse,
a 20-year-old junior pre-med student, stabbed 20-
year-old Trang Phuong Ho on Sunday morning in
the suite they shared at the Dunster House dor
mitory, authorities said. An overnight guest of
Ms. Ho who tried to intervene was slightly
injured. Tadesse then hanged herself from a
shower rod.

roommates had soured recently when the murder
victim, stabbed 45 times, decided she would room
with someone else next year.
Investigators were focusing on the relationship
between the women, said Martin Murphy, a Mid
dlesex County prosecutor.
