THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) — The United States and four
European peace partners agreed
yesterday to stay the course in
Bosnia against Serb assaults but to
regroup U.N. peacekeepers to make
them less vulnerable.
A statement issued after a five
hour meeting demanded the release
of more than 300 U.N. hostages in
the former Yugoslav republic and
said Serb leaders would be held
accountable for their well-being.
Secretary of State Warren
Christopher reaffirmed, mean
while, that NATO had not aban
doned the option of using air
attacks against Serb positions. The
hostage-taking followed air strikes
last week against Serb ammunition
depots.
Christopher praised France and
Britain, which have large peace

keeping forces in Bosnia, for
"courageous determination" to
keep ground troops in Bosnia
despite stepped-up Serb assaults.
He pledged U.S. support for air
attacks against the Serbs, who have
rejected proposals to negotiate a
settlement in their conflict with the
Muslim-led government.
Russian Foreign Minister
Andrei V. Kozyrev registered his
support for the decision by the five
nation "contact group" to stay the
course in Bosnia while regrouping
in ways to "avoid actions endanger
ing the safety" of the 22,000 peace
keepers.
However, Kozyrev opposed
more air strikes as an option, said a
senior U.S. official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
Kozyrev stressed that the priori
ty remains seeking a political rather

than a military solution to the con
flict.
Joining with the United States
and Russia were Britain, France
and Germany.
About 2,000 Marines from
Camp Lejeune, N.C., were being
transferred from exercises on the
Italian island of Sardinia to the
Adriatic Sea, where the aircraft car
rier Theodore Roosevelt was head
ed. The Clinton administration has
continued to exclude American
ground troops from use as on-the
ground peacekeepers in Bosnia.
The Marines' transfer was "a
precautionary measure. No decision
has been made yet to send them into
combat," National Security Adviser
Anthony Lake said in Washington.
Some 25,000 U.S. troops are
available in the event of any evacu
ation from Bosnia.
