## Fighting budget cuts 
### 
PRESIDENT casper deserves
congratulations for encourag
ing the ASSU Senate to fight
Congress' plans to cut federal
financial aid. These cuts pose a seri
ous threat to the University's bud
get, and it is in the best interests of
the administration and the student
body to cooperate in order to pre
vent them from being realized.
The University has expended
considerable energy trying to con
vince Congress to oppose cutting
the budget for financial aid and
research. President Casper himself
has traveled to Washington to
make the case for preserving this
vital part of the federal budget.
In his recent address to the
ASSU, Casper encouraged students
to write letters to their elected rep
resentatives in Congress informing
them of the reasons to oppose cuts
in funding for higher education.
These reasons are numerous and
compelling. Spending for higher
education is an investment in the

future of America; the funds spent
on allowing lower-income students
to attend college will repay them
selves many times over through
increased productivity levels in our
society.
Students, when organized and
passionate, can play a very power
ful role in the political process, as
the protests of the '60s and '70s
proved. They should take action to
make their voices as loud as possi
ble to prevent the cuts in financial
aid.
Given the fact that students and
the administration have the same
goals on this issue, it would be nice
to see more cooperation between
those groups. The University
should consider forming a commit
tee on government relations com
prised of administrators and stu
dent leaders, and do anything else
which might make the efforts to
preserve federal financial aid more
effective. Together we can win this
fight.
