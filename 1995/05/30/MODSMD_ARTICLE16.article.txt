# Getting student input
## 
### 
AS THE UNIVERSITY con
tinues the search for a new
dean of students, it remains
vitally important that students get
involved in the process.
Stanford administrators, partic
ularly Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds, deserve
praise for making a strong effort to
solicit student input into the
choice of dean of students. Still,
it's hard to get students involved
in picking a new administrator; for
example, one meeting last week
drew only 25 staff members and
students.
There have been two candidate
meetings so far; three more ques
tion-and-answer sessions with
candidates are scheduled for this
week.
All students should try to attend
one or more of these meetings if
they can. Too often we hear com
plaints from the student body
about the inattentiveness of
administrators; now students have

the chance to pose questions —
both serious and fun — to candi
dates for a position that is sup
posed to represent student inter
ests to the administration.
If students don't turn out, they
may end up with a dean who
doesn't understand their interests
— or even know what students
expcct.
Plus, these meetings are a great
way to get to know the candidates.
How else would we have found out
that finalist Joseph Navarro, asso
ciate dean of students at UC-Santa
Barbara, wants to hang out at
Tresidder drinking beer and talk
ing with students every now and
then?
Students can meet candidate
Charles Kenyon in Tresidder's
Cypress South today at 4 p.m.;
Patricia Brown in the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford,
Room 112 at 4 p.m. tomorrow; and
Barbara Gossett at 4 p.m. on June
7, location to be announced.
