Programs 6 bridge the gap 9 between alums and students

lAM WRITING regarding your May
18 editorial entitled "Alumni connec
tions." The Alumni Association (at
Bowman House) runs three successful
programs that do much more than
bridge the gap between the student and
alumni communities. First, there is the
Student Alumni Network (STAN), a
group of student volunteers who are
responsible for planning student-alumni
events. Among other things, STAN orga
nized many of the student / alumni
career panels that took place on campus
this year. STAN also planned more than
20 student-alumni brunches in the
homes of alums all over the Bay Area.
The association also runs the award
winning Student Alumni Mentor Pro
gram through which we've identified a
pool of hundreds of local alumni from
which students can select career men
tors. Of course, the students have to be
self-motivated in order to participate. In
four years of existence, the Mentor Pro
gram has matched over 500 students
and alums. We provide the CPPC with a
duplicate set of mentor listings, so stu
dents can sign up for the program in two
places on campus. We also run the
Alumni Contact Service (ACS). This
nationwide database of 6,159 names,

contains contact information on alums
who are available for informational
interviews about their jobs, careers and
companies. As with the Mentor Pro
gram, we furnish these listings to the
CPPC. There are plans to go on-line
with this database, so access will soon be
as close as your computer terminal.
To me, there's an expectation prob
lem with your editorial. I call it the
"glamour job syndrome." I'll just illus
trate it with a true story. A little over
three years ago, I suggested to an inquir
ing design major that he contact an ACS
volunteer listed at a company called Sili
con Graphics. The student told me he'd
never heard of them, and that he was
looking for alums doing work in special
effects animation. "Don't we have any
alums who work for Industrial Light &
Magic?" he asked. He didn't see any
point in talking to an alum employed by
one of ILM's key hardware vendors. Pre
sumably, once people get jobs, they
never deal with anyone outside of their
company. Students, having had the ben
efit of vast amounts of non-experience,
always seem to know exactly what they
want and exactly how the "real world"
works.
Here's another story: This past April,

STAN put together a panel of eight fabu
lous artists and graphic designers who
came to campus on a Tuesday evening to
talk about their careers; after plastering
the campus and dorms with flyers, and
running ads in The Daily, 15 students
showed up. I'm the one who has to con
vince the visiting alums that it was
worth their time and effort to come. It's
hard to keep alums interested after dis
appointing experiences with students.
The Daily says that the University
should help students make connections
"by providing better access" to alumni.
Well, you know what, neither the Uni
versity, nor the Alumni Association,
can compel any alum to volunteer for a
program like the Mentor Program or
ACS. And volunteer they must, because
we can't just release people's names
and phone numbers without their per
mission. Can the University compel
students to attend every single one of
their classes? Hardly. So why does The
Daily assume that the University can
dictate to alumni how they spend their
time? People volunteer for things if
they feel appreciated. Yet, many of the
alums who are volunteers in ACS or
the Mentor Program often tell me that
even when they help students out,

rarely, if ever, are they thankod. How
long does it take to write a thank you
note?

The"x" factor in this equation isn't
the University, or the Alumni Associa
tion, or the CPPC: It's the students.
Students need to show they're willing to
start a dialogue with alums; as it stands
now, students only want to talk to alum
ni when it's "that time" again. The Daily
can help out: Rather than run a column
on "Boobs, babes and body hair" — the
column that appeared opposite the edito
rial — why not promote ACS or the
Mentor Program in its pages, for free?
Perhaps more students should start
taking advantage of programs like
STAN, the Mentor Program, and ACS,
in October and November, so that when
May rolls around they'll be set up in a
job or internship. Rather than wait for
someone else to do their legwork, they
should take advantage of what's already
in place. There's a lot of help available
today, if one looks for it. Do your home
work. Get out there and make contacts.
Don't complain. Just do it!
