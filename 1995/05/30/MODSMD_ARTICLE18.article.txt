# Response to a challenge of fundamental dogma was an anonymous call
## 
### 
Last week I received an anonymous
call in response to my column in Tues
day's Daily: "Hello, I have a message for
Greg Barnes. I'm a representative of the
Stanford Economics Department, urging
you to take an economics course here at
Stanford, so in your future letters to The

Daily you don't exercise such blatant dis
respect for basic economic principles.
Thank you veiy much."
I'd like to thank the anonymous caller,
but I have taken enough courses in eco
nomics already. In fact, I could argue the
pro-free-market dogma with the best of
them. Unfortunately, although it sounds
great, the free market is an intellectual
construction with no grounding in reality.
The response to a challenge to fundamen
tal dogma is, not surprisingly, hostile.
I'd also urge this anonymous caller,

who of course does not represent the Eco
nomics Department even if he is a student
there, to do some serious economics read
ing. I'd recommend a work that not only
challenges the basis of present economic
dogma, but is a veiy hopeful and positive
mind-opening vision of a high-tech, non
totalitarian, non-capitalist economic sys
tem. For economics students, examine
"The political economy of participatory
economics," by M. Albert and R. Hahnel,
Princeton University Press, 1991. For
others not familiar with economic theory,

the authors wrote a companion volume,
"Looking forward: participatory eco
nomics for the twenty-first century,"
South End Press, 1991.
After reading about participatory eco
nomics, I'd welcome further comments
from the caller on economics, although I
would prefer to enter into rational discus
sion which is not assisted by accusations
delivered anonymously. My e-mail address
is gbarnes@leland.stanford.edu.
