# Student services fare well in poll
## Overall, students give high marks to various components of campus life 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
If the tables were turned and
students graded the University,
most campus services would pass
— but few would come through
with flying colors, according to a
poll conducted by The Daily last
week.
The grades students awarded
to 11 campus services turned out
averages between B- (a 2.58
grade point average) and A
(3.51). Students were also asked
to assign a grade to how safe they
feel on campus and to grade
Stanford overall.
Students responded positive
ly to grading their "Stanford ex
perience as a whole." Only one
student was unhappy enough to
give the University a failing
grade, while a combined 339 of
369 randomly-selected students
polled said they would give their
experience here an A or B.
Campus safety had the high
est average grade; 224 of those
surveyed said they would give
safety an A, with A translating to

"most safe" and F to "least safe."
Of the student services in
cluded in the poll, research op
portunities at Stanford received
the most enthusiastic response.
Nearly 200 of the 300 students
who gave an opinion on research
opportunities rated the available
programs an A.
University libraries, athletic
opportunities and extracurricu
lar activities also ranked high on
the student satisfaction list.
The libraries finished with a
B+, as did athletic opportunities,
such as exercise facilities and in
tramural sports, and non-athlet
ic and non-academic activities.
Inside the classroom, stu
dents said they are mostly con
tent with teaching at Stanford,
although only 125 students
awarded teaching an A, while
191 gave a B grade.
Students were less enthusias
tic about the role of University
administration — everyone from
the registrar to the president and
provost. Only 29 respondents

gave the administration an A,
while 152 gave it a Band 96 gave
it a C.
Advising for students during
their time at Stanford and after
received mixed reviews. While
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center — which helps stu
dents find campus jobs, summer
internships and permanent posi
tions — ended up with a B aver
age, the GPA awarded the aca
demic advising system was only
2.74, a B-.
Peer advising, in the form of
resident assistants and other
Residential Education programs,

also came in near the bottom of
the survey, with a GPA of 2.82.
Campus housing itself came
out with a 2.87 GPA, with 165 of
the 304 respondents who live on
campus grading their dorms or
houses a B.
Cowell Student Health Center,
often the victim of student com
plaint, earned a 2.81 average
from the students polled. Nearly
150 students graded Cowell at B,
while the scales were nearly bal
anced on both sides with 67 and
69 responses for A and C, respec
tively.
Although students awarded
none of the campus services in
the poll a straight-A average, few
grades sank below a C, and no
service received more than 10
failing votes from those polled.
