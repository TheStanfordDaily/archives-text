## Imagery of light and dark 
### 
WE SEE IT in every aspect of our
culture. On television, in movies,
in literature, in songs — it's all
over the place. No, I'm not talking about
sex, I'm talking about the loaded use of
light and dark imagery. Huh? Yeah, it's
one of those things that really, truly
starts to be bothersome when you start
to think about it. Now you, my lucky
readers, get to be irked by it too.
Specifically, what I'm talking about is
the use of images and language in our
culture that places value judgments on
colors. Come on, it's everywhere. There
was even an opinions column in The
Daily a couple of weeks ago that was
titled "Human nature's dark side." Obvi
ously whoever titled that column did not
intend to make any racial implications.
It's in our subconscious and isu't often
noticed.
A fluke, you say? Imagery like that is
only used in old Westerns and Romantic
poetry, you think? Well, let's take a look
at how we use the word "black" in collo
quial English. First, as a description of
color. Second, as a racial characteriza
tion. From there on out, it's all loaded
and questionable usage. People are black
listed and blackballed. Black is the color
of choice for most villains on TV and in
movies. Darth Vader is, in fact, "Dark
Father." Black is usually worn to funer
als. Dark nights are when evil comes out.
Hardened criminals are noted to have
"blackened hearts." The eight ball is the
one you never want to hit.

The list goes on. Point being, these
uses of "black" and "dark" do pervade
our society. I realize that many people
will read this column and concede that
this imagery does exist, but contend the
point that it has any racial connotations
and that it has any negative impact on
people. For these skeptics, I have two
points for consideration. The first is an
excerpt from"The Little Black Boy," by
William Blake. "I am black, but oh, my
soul is white! / White as an angel is the
English child, / But I am black, as if
bereaved of light." It's an extreme exam
ple, but nonetheless, is reflective of soci
etal perceptions of black and white.
My second point comes from my expe
rience teaching literature to eighth
graders last summer. We were reading
sojne poetry with references to the black
(evil) \good) 'sides of a woman.
One of my students, an African-Ameri
can girl, asked, "Why are the black people
always doing bad things? How come we
never get to be the good people?" I told
her that the color references being made
in the poem were not meant to be taken
literally. Yet this served as a hollow
explanation. She, like all of us, had
applied the sentiments of poetry to her
self, and had come up with a perfectly
reasonable interpretation of the poet's
intent.
It was at this point that I stopped
thinking that complaints about loaded
color imagery were frivolous. That they
were just another finger-pointing exer

cise of the Politically Correct Police.
Language and imagery have strong
effects on people, especially young people
who are perceiving certain innuendoes
and characterizations for the first time. I
am not saying that we should slap on a
speech code that bans use of "black" and
"dark" as used in the figurative sense.
What I am saying is that we should be
aware of what effect our language and
use of imagery has on other people. That
we should take the greater implications
into consideration before employing
these words and ideas.
Besides, "dark" and "black" are so
imprecise and non-specific. They are
used in an infinite variety of ways, so
why not opt for clarity and use a better
word. Here's a partial list of synonyms
for the word "dark": dismal, dreary, evil,
bleak, grim, funereal, somber, solemn,
grave, heavy, gloomy, melancholy,
depressed, dejected, cheerless, joyless,
sad, disconsolate, doleful, sullen, dour,
morose, moody, brooding, villainous,
infamous, threatening and menacing.
Come on, be creative.

Sudha would like to note that she also
enjoys 4 a.m. hallway conversations
about multiculturalism. However, they
are not important enough to take up an
entire column. Thanks.
