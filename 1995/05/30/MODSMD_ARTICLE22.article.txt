Capitalizing on students
I would like to say something
about the capital improvement pro
grams at Stanford. I think that all
the students should realize that the
University is treating us more as a
business opportunity for their sum
mer conferences to make some
money, rather than as an honest
improvement of student living.
No affirmative action for me
As a proud and educated Chicano
male, I am personally against affir
mative action because, in the near
future when people of color are the
majority and in power, I really don't
want to hear any excuses fall from
the lips of the white man.
Professors aren't coming
Well, if the graduates want to
throw a beach ball around and pose
for pictures with their friends on the
football field to celebrate their
$100,000 educations, that's fine. But
I hope you all won't mind if the fac
ulty doesn't come.
