# Stanford should leave students on 'spiritual search'

### Helen Tjioe 
AS ANOTHER school year comes to
a close and the sunnier days become
summer, there will soon be time to
look back at what has passed. Were there
experiences you received lasting insight
from, ones that enlarged and enriched
your world, and now enable you to live
present moments more intensely than
before?
In the bustle of our lives, many ques
tions arise. We wish, in the end, for some
thing to believe in. Certainly, there is joy
all around us — in the beauty of this cam
pus, in the example of inspiring lives and
in the great art and literature we study
together in our classrooms. Crucial to any
enterprise of depth is the existence of a
center of focus or belief. It remains the
essential issue of the debates over the
structure and aim of CIV.
To truly benefit from the exploration
of other cultures, we must first under
stand our own. In choosing not to center
our attention upon the study of Western
art and civilization, and instead — in the
name of multiculturalism — attempting

to teach simultaneously many cultures,
we are in danger of losing our sense of
direction, of engendering conditions not
conducive to learning. An extension in the
breadth of one's knowledge is only mean
ingful when coupled with a solid founda
tion. And for us in the Western world, this
focused, in-depth exploration should be of
our own rich Judeo-Christian heritage.
Stanford has strayed from this center,
and in its restructuring of CIV over the
years, what was once an important, com
prehensive and alluring introduction to
the passion of the Western mind and the
ideas that have shaped our world view,
has been seriously watered down.
From my own experience as a fresh
man in CIV, and from the accounts of fel
low students in various other CIV tracks,
I can attest to the fact that the program
has, by and large, lost sight of its original
purpose. Clearly inferior works — in
many cases not yet subjected to the test of
time and included simply for reasons of
political correctness — are required read
ing. Random multicultural readings
grafted onto the core curriculum, direc
tionless discussion sections, the general
lack of an overriding framework all pre
vent students from finding a center of
focus. They are signs that there has been
a fundamental change in attitude as to
why CIV exists in the first place. Its func
tion seems no longer to be one of present

ing the life and works of great figures of
our Western tradition so that we may
find, in their example, models for our own
endeavors. Instead, CIV performs a
bureaucratic and visionless duty, in
which traditional standards of excellence
are disregarded. Sadly, as so often hap
pens, only the shell of what was once liv
ing is left behind.
I also worry that the common practice
of professors and teaching assistants of
regarding just about anything anyone
says in discussions as a perfectly justified
truth, simply by virtue of it being a per
sonal opinion, encourages the formation
of an unhealthy and imbalanced view of
life, in which there are neither standards
of truth or falsity, nor limits within and
against which progress and achievement
can be measured.
We must remember that pure freedom,
without limitation, leads most often to
confusion and purposelessness. It is irre
sponsible to encourage the view that
there is no right or wrong, no universal
ideals to aspire to, no meaningful values
to work with. This assumption leads, ulti
mately, to the view that there is nothing
to believe in. One who accepts everything
cannot really believe in anything.
Apathy exists, and because of this,
many of our fmest professors leave, or
seek early retirement. When indifference
becomes a habit, when the idea of class

room study calls to mind a mass of end
less, dry, dehumanized (and therefore
dehumanizing) lectures, it is difficult to
become interested again. This frame of
mind has become an encrusted attitude, a
protective shell — and true teaching,
because it is rare and unexpected, can go
largely unappreciated by the reflexively
uninterested student.
Moreover, the flattening of values ram
pant both in academia and society at
large, and the apathy and indifference
that is its inevitable result, have a pro
foundly iniquitous effect upon the spirit.
Universities should serve as models for
society, not mirror it. They have the
potential, as bastions of idealism, and
through the young people they educate, to
make this world a better place to live. It
can be said that what the church and the
aristocracy were for the historical ages in
which they were the center of influence
and focus, universities are ours.
I'd like to conclude by suggesting a fur
ther thought central to our lives as Stan
ford students: Was what I experienced in
classrooms this year worthy of being
remembered? Did it open up to me worlds
which will remain open to me for further
exploration late in life? For this is what
true education is about — an awakening
of interest, a stirring of the soul, a kin
dling of the desire to embark upon a spir
itual search that will never end.
