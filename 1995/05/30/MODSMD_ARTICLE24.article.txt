# Stay young, live life to the fullest and pursue all of your dreams

PEOPLE ALWAYS ask me what it
was like living in Alaska. Sure, there
were those 58-helow nights and
those two-and-a-half-hour days. But there
were the dreams — to "get out" of Alaska,
to meet that special woman and never have
to settle, to be a firefighter. Aerosmith
lyrics spoke to me, as did Captain Kanga
roo, my first kiss and the arguments I had
with my parents about long hair, tatoos
and my course of study at Stanford.
I knew where I was going, but the resis
tance from my parents was tough. "I want
to do what I want to do. If I do what I enjoy,
I will do it so well that people will pay me
good money for it," I would tell my dad. I
was exploring my dreams amid a pes-

Dreams. Never deny them.
Fight to stay young because growing up
implies a certain giving up. Eat the worm,
peel the peach and toss the dice in the
direction of your dreams because life only
comes once. "Life's a journey, not a desti
nation," said Aerosmith's Steve Tyler.
"The only thing we have to fear is fear
itself," said President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt. Words of wisdom for all of us.
Too many times have I heard classmates
dread the future and lonely hearts lament
the dating scene. What I say to the former
is listen to Tyler; the latter, to Roosevelt.
Enjoy yourself now. If you've always want
ed to do something, set a date. If you think
she's cute, get to know her. Nothing comes
easy and that which is free imparts no
value to the beholder. Know who to call
your friends and who to call your acquain
tances and who to call your lover, but never
call someone your lover before you call him
or her your friend.

Take a second to see how lucky you real
ly are. Sure your roomie drives a 944 and
your drawmate is Phi Beta Kappa, but
there are qualities in each of us that are far
too subtle for others to see. And so what?
Revel in them yourself. Be strong in your
convictions, and don't waver. Everyone
hails Sir Lancelot and King Arthur, but
who won the Holy Grail? Sir Galahad,
through his pureness of heart and strength
of character. It's so easy to compare our
selves to everyone around us — in fact it's
quite natural, but know where the bound
aries lie. Be an individual, be a little crazy,
be extra courteous to the custodian who
cleans your hallway. Give everything a
chance and infuse it with passion. If your
carburetor needs tuning, do it yourself. If
you're bored with SCBN, produce your
own TV show. If your mate cheats on you,
take him or her to a romantic location like
a mountain or a bridge and push.
When the going gets tough, improvise,
overcome, adapt and don't be afraid to turn

to your friends as long as you'd do the same
for them. There is nothing more important
in this world than people. Why do you
think "Gilligan's Island" and "Star Trek"
were such big hits? They're all about work
ing and exploring and enjoying together.
Don't be a loner. Far longer will a per
son survive with a friend and no resources
than a loner with all the provisions in the
world. Put down that problem set, and give
an old high school friend a call. Skip a day
of jogging, and take a loved one to Carmel.
Take a homeless person to Fresh Choice
for a balanced meal.
Be open to other viewpoints, and never
jump to conclusions. Our way of seeing
reality is one of many. Take yourself to the
other side and look at how you're thinking
as well as what you're thinking. Most con
flict is due to miscommunication —
between middle eastern countries, between
you and your significant other, between
AT&T and MCI. Take the time to listen
and seek new and better ways to revamp

your own opinions. Have an opinion, but
don't assume. Have faith in yourself, and
define your own reality — don't let others
do it for you.
One woman I met in Hollywood told me
about her first audition for a television
commercial. Up against professional
actresses who could speak only of their
resumes, "biz" contacts and exercise rou
tines, she felt quite intimidated. Her turn
soon came, she gave it her best, but felt dis
mayed when the director threw his arms in
the air, expounded a grunt of dissatisfac
tion and proceeded to call the next actress.
The poor woman thought her chances
quashed until she was awarded the role.
Unable to reconcile what had happened at
the audition, she said to the director "But
you seemed so disgusted in me." The direc
tor replied, "During your audition I
remembered I had left a roast in the oven."
So, pursue your goals because, although
life is a struggle, treasures remain only in
your dreams.
