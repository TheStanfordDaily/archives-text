## Baseball takes four of five, plays today for Omaha 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
WICHITA, Kan. — A lot of homers.
A lot of hits. A lot of runs. A lot of wind.
1 here was a lot of almost everything
offensively in Wichita, Kan., during the
weekend's Midwest I baseball regional.
The average number of runs scored
per game was over 20 for the first two
days of the tournament, with the Cardi
nal getting its share. Stanford scored 10
runs against Arkansas, had 24 runs in
two games vs. Lamar and pounded 40
hits in those three games.
With a 4-1 record in the tournament,
Stanford has done almost everything as
it has played its best baseball of the sea
son. There is just one more thing left
undone, and today at 8 a.m. PDT the
Cardinal will have a chance to do it.
The complexities of the tournament
system are a thing of the past. It's very
simple from here on out — win against
top-seeded Texas Tech and take a trip to
Omaha for the College World Series.
Lose and take a trip to Palo Alto for
spring quarter finals.
After beating the Arkansas Razor
backs 10-3 and the Lamar Cardinals 8-
1, Stanford dropped a game to Tech 3-1
before beating Lamar again Monday 16-
9 and the Red Raiders 3-2 in the night
cap.
The Cardinal (38-23) faced the
Raiders (51-13) for the second time in
the tournament on Monday night after
advancing to the championship game
through the losers' bracket. Stanford
lost to the Raiders on Sunday and need
ed a victory to push Tech to a second
championship contest today.
The Raiders sported some mind-bog
gling statistics on their side going into
yesterday's game against Stanford.
Junior third baseman Clint Bryant took
a .786 average with three home runs
and 11 RBIs through three tournament
games. The team was batting .433 and
had scored 41 runs to its opponents' 16
in three games.
Stanford got on the big board first in
the bottom of the second. Senior right
fielder Dusty Allen singled to left and
stole second before he was taken home
by junior second baseman Brian Dal
limore's ground ball that dribbled into
left field.
Texas Tech's answer came quickly.
Bryant tied the ball game in the third
with a one-out line drive single to left
field that scored Jason Totman from
third. Andy Gonzales gave Tech a 2-1
lead with an RBI single in the next at
bat.
Stanford starter Mario Iglesias had

logged only 30 innings on the mound
this season for Stanford coming into the
tourney, and his only other career ctart
lasted five innings. But the junior right
hander held a powerful Raiders squad at
bay for a full nine innings, giving up
only five hits.
"I'm very proud of Mario," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said. "It was the
biggest game of the season and he comes
up big for us."
Tech sophomore southpaw JefT Peck
(10-2) managed a similar performance
against Stanford, allowing the Cardinal
four hits through six frames.
Stanford's bats showed signs of com
ing alive in the bottom of the sixth.
Junior left fielder Cale Carter cracked a
ball down the left field line that turned
into a triple as Carter hustled around
the bases. But Hinch and Carver both
struck out to allow Tech to preserve its
2-1 lead after six innings.

I'm very proud of
Mario [Iglesias]. It was
the biggest game of the
season and he comes
up big for us.'
— Mark Marquess

The Cardinal finally tied the game
the next inning when Dallimore
knocked his third hit of the game into
right field and scored Allen from second
base. The lead continued to elude Stan
ford, but pitching kept the Cardinal in
the game.
Iglesias retired nine Raiders in a row
beginning in the fifth frame before he
walked his third Tech batter in the
eighth. He then set down the last four
batters, finishing his complete game
against the No. 5 team in the country.
Stanford took to the plate in the bot
tom of the ninth with a chance to win
the game in regulation. Allen led off the
inning with a single and freshman des
ignated hitter Jon Schaeffer bunted
Allen to second. A walk and a groundout
left the Cardinal with runners on sec
ond and third with two outs.
Sophomore shortstop Eric Sees
stepped to the plate struggling. He had
no hits in the game and had hit only
.250 in the four previous contests. But
he knocked a long ball into the gap in
left center, driving home the winning
run and keeping Stanford alive in the
race for Omaha.
Dallimore had the big game, going 3-

for-3 with two RBIs on the day.
"I was fortunate to be the guy at the
plate at the right time," Dallimore said.
"And I was even more fortunate to be
able to come through at that time."
Stanford faced elimination in its
fourth game of the tourney but deliv
ered the favor to Lamar (38-24), ending
the fifth-seeded Cardinals' Cinderella
run for Omaha 16-9.
Junior lefty Dan Reed (4-4, 4.96
ERA) came out strong in the first
inning, sending the Cardinals' first
three batters back to the dugout. But
Lamar's freshman right-hander Eric
Cammack (4-0, 3.24 ERA) got in trouble
before the fans could comfortably adjust
their rear ends to the aluminum bleach
ers. Freshman center fielder Joe Kil
burg walked on four straight balls from
Cammack and Carter knocked a line
drive past second baseman Donny
Schroeder before a balk moved the run
ners to the corner. Lamar's troubles
came to a head when Hinch walked to
load the bases.
Carver stepped to the plate with no
outs and the bases loaded and drove a
stand-up double to the center-field wall.
Three runs scored on the blast and the
Cardinal led by three with no one out in
the first frame.
The scoring binge had yet to end.
With two outs Dallimore lofted a single
into shallow right-center field to score
Carver from second. Kent's blooper sin
gle to center spurred Lamar coach Jim
Gilligan to replace the battered fresh
man with another first-year hurler.
In the second, Hinch doubled down
the right-field line to take home Kilburg
and put the Cardinal up 5-0. Hinch stole
third and became Stanford's seventh
run when Allen emerged from his mini
slump and singled between third and
shortstop. Allen had struck out four
straight at bats before the hit and was
only 2-for-12 up to that point.
Lamar put two men on again in the
top of the third with no outs. After turn
ing a double play Stanford gave Lamar
its first run of the contest on a ground
ball that darted past Sees. Bob Rauch
drove in another run on a double to cut
the lead to four runs with men still at
second and third base. But Reed got
Robin Lindsey to ground out to second,
cutting the scoring drive short.
Stanford extended the lead in the
fourth when Hinch doubled in Kilburg
and Carter took home on a passed ball,
all with no outs in the inning. Carver
bounced a single over the pitcher and
into center field to score Hinch, and the

College World Series today.
lead was 9-2 — still with no Cardi
nal out in the fourth.
It was to be the second disas
trous inning for Lamar, an inning
it would be unable to recover from.
Allen walked and Schaeffer moved
the runners to second and third on
a groundout. That set up Brian
Dallimore's double down the left
field line that scored both Carver
jmd Allen and pushed the insur
mountable lead to 11-2.
As if the nine-point deficit
wasn't quite enough, Sees topped
it off with a single to right that
scored Dallimore. Sees was picked
off trying to take second base on
the play, and the inning was mer
cifully concluded.
The Cardinals began hitting
Reed hard in the fifth inning. Step
ping to the plate with two men on
base, Will Cook took the first step
toward overcoming the Stanford
lead when he launched a three-run
dinger to the lawn past left-center
field. Reed escaped the inning with
no more runs but gave up two long
fly balls that could have gone bye
bye with the help of a slight wind.
"We didn't want to go to the
bullpen much," Marquess said of
his desire to keep the pen fresh for
the championship matchup
against Texas Tech. "Reed gave us
six innings, and that was just what
we needed."
Stanford quickly responded to
Lamar's offense. The Cardinal
loaded the bases with two out in
the bottom of the fifth and nabbed
its second run of the game off a
Lamar balk. Schaeffer then flied
out, and the lead was 13-5 after
five.
"When they would get close we
would come back and score a cou
ple," Marquess said. "We kept a
comfortable cushion. We kept
scoring, that was the key."
The Cardinal offensive machine
answered Lamar's run in the top
of the sixth with one of its own.
Kilburg drove in Kent to make the
score 14-6 before he was thrown
out attempting to steal second.
Lamar refused to mosey back to

Beaumont without a fight. The
bases were loaded on sophomore
submariner Brendan Sullivan
with no outs in the eighth, and
Cook's double scored two and cut
the lead to 14-8. But Sullivan
found his touch after hitting two
batters in a row and retired the
sides before Lamar could cross the
plate again.
Just for good measure, Kilburg
tripled in Sees and then scored on
Carter's fly that dropped in the
gap in the bottom of the eighth.
Lamar put one more score on the
board in the top of the ninth to set
the final of 16-9.
Stanford had fallen into the
losers' bracket after dropping
game three to Texas Tech Sunday
night 3-1, in a contest that the
Cardinal could have taken.
Hinch gave Stanford the early
lead when, one pitch after knock
ing a ball over the fence but just
foul to left, took a pitch deep to
right-center. But Tech took the
lead in the bottom of the fourth
thanks to several key miscues by
Cardinal defenders.
Miscommunication on a rou
tine grounder between first and
second coupled with a legitimate
single put runners at the corners.
The rear runner moved into scor
ing position, and right fielder
Brandon Welch came to the plate
with two outs.
Welch drove several balls just
foul before popping up a high fly
ball between third and left that
looked like an easy final out. But
as Carver, Carter and Sees con
verged on the ball, it dropped
between them and two Raiders
crossed the plate.
"[Sees] was playing right,
behind second base," Marquess
said. "It was a long run, and he
just didn't get there to call off
Carver. We just didn't communi
cate."
The pitchers took over the
game from there, until Bartels got
into trouble in the seventh. He
lasted 6 2/3 innings before Sulli
van took over, putting out the fire
after Tech had scored the final
run.
The opening game on Sunday
for the Cardinal was against

Lamar, a surprise winner over
host Wichita State in their opener
the day before. Stanford posted its
second win of the tourney convinc
ingly, pounding out 14 hits in a
five-hit complete game by junior
southpaw Mike Robbins. All Stan
ford runs in the 8-1 victory came
with two outs.
As has been Stanford's signa
ture, the Cardinal scored quick
and in abundance. After retiring
the first two hitters of the inning,
Lamar southpaw Kevin Lane was
taken to the cleaners by Stanford
bats. Hinch blooped a single over
diving first baseman Morgan
Walker and Carver launched his
third home run in two games and
11th of the season over the right
field wall. The score was pushed to
3-0 when Lane gave Allen a fast
ball in the middle of the plate and
Allen sent the second long ball of
the inning into a horde of thrilled
fans in the right-field lawn.
The game was quickly put out
of reach when Stanford added
three more in the second frame.
Kilburg singled with two men out
before Carter lofted an RBI double
down the left-field line. Hinch
slapped a slow grounder between
third and shortstop to drive in
Carter. Hinch then stole second
base, and before he could dust off
his uniform was taken home by
Carver's double to left.
Lamar's Bob Rauch took Rob
bins deep in the bottom half of the
inning to cut the Cardinal lead to
6-1, but the Cardinal loaded the
bases again in the fourth frame.
Schaeffer's two-out single past
Walker's outstretched arms scored
the game's final two runs.
"To hold a team to only one run
in these conditions is truly a great
pitching performance," Marquess
said of Robbins' seven strikeout,
no walk complete game. Robbins
tossed 122 pitches in the contest
and at one point retired 13
straight Lamar batters.
"Their left-hander outsmarted
us," Lamar coach Jim Gilligan said
of Robbins. "He was keeping the
ball down at the knees and in the
dirt, and we were going down in
the dirt after him. He made us
swing at pitches we didn't have a

chance to hit. He out-pitched our
guys, and that's why they won."
Hot Stanford bats also helped
in the endeavor. The too of the
Cardinal order answered the call
as Kilburg, Carter and Carver all
hit 2-for-5 and Hinch went 3-for-5
in the game. They combined for
five RBIs and seven runs.
Stanford opened the tourney on
Saturday after all games were
rained out on Friday. The fourth
seeded Arkansas Razorbacks
became the Cardinal's first victim
in a 10-3 shellacking.
Carver's 2-for-5 showing at the
plate in the opener may not seem
outstanding on the surface. But in
light of the fact that both hits were
shots that traveled over the fence
and onto 21st Avenue, outstand
ing might not be a strong enough
word for Carver's contribution.
His work began early. After a
scoreless first inning, Carver took
the first offering from Matt
Carnes in the second over the cen
ter-field wall. While the homer was
aided out of the park by a blustery
wind, the blast nonetheless gave
Stanford a 1-0 lead and the
momentum it needed to open up a
comfortable lead.
The scoring continued in the
second after Allen bounced an
over-the-wall double and was
moved to third base by Schaeffer.
Dallimore lopped a single to right
field and drove in Allen before Kil
burg sent Dallimore home on a
shot that got out of the infield. At
the end of two Stanford led 3-0.
The lead must not have been
enough in the mind of Carver, who
stepped to the plate for his second
at bat of the tourney and sent a
long ball 400 feet over the center
field fence.
The Razorbacks got on the
scoreboard for the first time in the
sixth inning. Arkansas right field
er Kit Pellow knocked a two-out
RBI single over second base, but
Stanford scored three runs in both
the seventh and eighth innings to
put the game away.
Kent took his first pitch into
the left-field bleachers for his third
homer of the season. Sees followed
with a double and Kilburg moved
Sees to third. Carter singled in

Sees, but before the inning was
over Carter had been balked home
by Rob Quamstrom and the score
was 7-1.
The Hogs made the score a little
less ugly in the top half of the
eighth. Peterson loaded the bases,
aided by an error on Carver. The
freshman ace then hit a Razorback
and sent one run home with no
outs. A passed ball scored
Arkansas' final run, and Peterson
wriggled out of the jam with no
earned runs allowed.
Stanford's run total reached
double-digits in its next-to-last at
bat, when Kilburg stepped to the
plate and took a 3-2 pitch out of
the park for his first career home
run, setting the 10-3 final in
stone.
Peterson's show on the mound
was par for this freshman sensa
tion's course. He worked the full
nine innings, giving up nine hits in
a tough wind and only one earned
run. With the victory Peterson
(12-1) surpassed Jack McDowell
for the most victories by a Stan
ford freshman.
"Originally my role was to be as
a reUever, with maybe a spot start
her and there," Peterson said.
"Things have just really worked
out this year. It's unbelievable to
be compared to Jack McDowell."
The game marked Peterson's
eighth complete game of the year.
The gusting wind that blew out to
right field throughout the contest
made it more difficult for the Car
dinal ace, but he had devised a
game plan and stuck to it.
"I just wanted to keep the ball
down in the wind," Peterson said.
"I was trying to hit the corners
around the knees."
Although Stanford has consis
tently supported Peterson offen
sively all year long, Marquess has
been able to count on him all year
long to keep the opponent's score
to a minimum.
"Kyle had a great game," Mar
quess said. "He didn't pitch like a
freshman out there. He's done
that a lot this year."
Peterson was only threatened
with big-run possibilities a few
times in the game, and in both
cases he worked out of the jam.
WICHITA, Kan. — A lot of homers.

With a 4-1 record in the tournament,

After beating the Arkansas Razor
backs 10-3 and the Lamar Cardinals 8-
1, Stanford dropped a game to Tech 3-1
before beating Lamar again Monday 16-
9 and the Red Raiders 3-2 in the night
cap.
The Cardinal (38-23) faced the
Raiders (51-13) for the second time in
the tournament on Monday night after
advancing to the championship game
through the losers' bracket. Stanford
lost to the Raiders on Sunday and need
ed a victory to push Tech to a second
championship contest today.
The Raiders sported some mind-bog

yesterday's game against Stanford.
Junior third baseman Clint Bryant took
a .786 average with three home runs
and 11 RBIs through three tournament

The Cardinal finally tied the game
the next inning when Dallimore
knocked his third hit of the game into
right field and scored Allen from second
base. The lead continued to elude Stan
ford, but pitching kept the Cardinal in
the game.
Iglesias retired nine Raiders in a row
beginning in the fifth frame before he
walked his third Tech batter in the
eighth. He then set down the last four
batters, finishing his complete game
against the No. 5 team in the country.
Stanford took to the plate in the bot

the game in regulation. Allen led off the
inning with a single and freshman des
ignated hitter Jon Schaeffer bunted
Allen to second. A walk and a groundout
left the Cardinal with runners on sec
ond and third with two outs.
Sophomore shortstop Eric Sees
stepped to the plate struggling. He had
no hits in the game and had hit only
.250 in the four previous contests. But
he knocked a long ball into the gap in
left center, driving home the winning
run and keeping Stanford alive in the
race for Omaha.
Dallimore had the big game, going 3-

for-3 with two RBIs on the day.
"I was fortunate to be the guy at the

"And I was even more fortunate to be

Stanford faced elimination in its

straight at bats before the hit and was

Lamar put two men on again in the

lead was 9-2 — still with no Cardi

Allen walked and Schaeffer moved
the runners to second and third on
a groundout. That set up Brian

Stanford had fallen into the
losers' bracket after dropping
game three to Texas Tech Sunday
night 3-1, in a contest that the
Cardinal could have taken.
Hinch gave Stanford the early
lead when, one pitch after knock
ing a ball over the fence but just

bases again in the fourth frame.
Schaeffer's two-out single past
Walker's outstretched arms scored
the game's final two runs.
"To hold a team to only one run
in these conditions is truly a great
pitching performance," Marquess
said of Robbins' seven strikeout,
no walk complete game. Robbins
tossed 122 pitches in the contest
and at one point retired 13
straight Lamar batters.
"Their left-hander outsmarted
us," Lamar coach Jim Gilligan said
of Robbins. "He was keeping the
ball down at the knees and in the
dirt, and we were going down in
the dirt after him. He made us
swing at pitches we didn't have a

chance to hit. He out-pitched our
guys, and that's why they won."
Hot Stanford bats also helped
in the endeavor. The too of the
Cardinal order answered the call
as Kilburg, Carter and Carver all
hit 2-for-5 and Hinch went 3-for-5
in the game. They combined for
five RBIs and seven runs.
Stanford opened the tourney on
Saturday after all games were
rained out on Friday. The fourth
seeded Arkansas Razorbacks
became the Cardinal's first victim
in a 10-3 shellacking.
Carver's 2-for-5 showing at the
plate in the opener may not seem
outstanding on the surface. But in
light of the fact that both hits were
shots that traveled over the fence
and onto 21st Avenue, outstand
ing might not be a strong enough
word for Carver's contribution.
His work began early. After a
scoreless first inning, Carver took
the first offering from Matt
Carnes in the second over the cen
ter-field wall. While the homer was
aided out of the park by a blustery
wind, the blast nonetheless gave
Stanford a 1-0 lead and the
momentum it needed to open up a
comfortable lead.
The scoring continued in the
second after Allen bounced an
over-the-wall double and was
moved to third base by Schaeffer.
Dallimore lopped a single to right
field and drove in Allen before Kil
burg sent Dallimore home on a
shot that got out of the infield. At
the end of two Stanford led 3-0.
The lead must not have been
enough in the mind of Carver, who
stepped to the plate for his second
at bat of the tourney and sent a
long ball 400 feet over the center
field fence.
The Razorbacks got on the
scoreboard for the first time in the
sixth inning. Arkansas right field
er Kit Pellow knocked a two-out
RBI single over second base, but
Stanford scored three runs in both
the seventh and eighth innings to
put the game away.
Kent took his first pitch into
the left-field bleachers for his third
homer of the season. Sees followed
with a double and Kilburg moved
Sees to third. Carter singled in

Sees, but before the inning was
over Carter had been balked home
by Rob Quamstrom and the score
was 7-1.
The Hogs made the score a little
less ugly in the top half of the
eighth. Peterson loaded the bases,
aided by an error on Carver. The
freshman ace then hit a Razorback
and sent one run home with no
outs. A passed ball scored
Arkansas' final run, and Peterson
wriggled out of the jam with no
earned runs allowed.
Stanford's run total reached
double-digits in its next-to-last at
bat, when Kilburg stepped to the
plate and took a 3-2 pitch out of
the park for his first career home
run, setting the 10-3 final in
stone.
Peterson's show on the mound
was par for this freshman sensa
tion's course. He worked the full
nine innings, giving up nine hits in
a tough wind and only one earned
run. With the victory Peterson
(12-1) surpassed Jack McDowell
for the most victories by a Stan
ford freshman.
"Originally my role was to be as
a reUever, with maybe a spot start
her and there," Peterson said.
"Things have just really worked
out this year. It's unbelievable to
be compared to Jack McDowell."
The game marked Peterson's
eighth complete game of the year.
The gusting wind that blew out to
right field throughout the contest
made it more difficult for the Car
dinal ace, but he had devised a
game plan and stuck to it.
"I just wanted to keep the ball
down in the wind," Peterson said.
"I was trying to hit the corners
around the knees."
Although Stanford has consis
tently supported Peterson offen
sively all year long, Marquess has
been able to count on him all year
long to keep the opponent's score
to a minimum.
"Kyle had a great game," Mar
quess said. "He didn't pitch like a
freshman out there. He's done
that a lot this year."
Peterson was only threatened
with big-run possibilities a few
times in the game, and in both
cases he worked out of the jam.
WICHITA, Kan. — A lot of homers.
A lot of hits. A lot of runs. A lot of wind.
1 here was a lot of almost everything
offensively in Wichita, Kan., during the
weekend's Midwest I baseball regional.
The average number of runs scored
per game was over 20 for the first two
days of the tournament, with the Cardi
nal getting its share. Stanford scored 10
runs against Arkansas, had 24 runs in
two games vs. Lamar and pounded 40
hits in those three games.
With a 4-1 record in the tournament,
Stanford has done almost everything as
it has played its best baseball of the sea
son. There is just one more thing left
undone, and today at 8 a.m. PDT the
Cardinal will have a chance to do it.
The complexities of the tournament
system are a thing of the past. It's very
simple from here on out — win against
top-seeded Texas Tech and take a trip to
Omaha for the College World Series.
Lose and take a trip to Palo Alto for
spring quarter finals.
After beating the Arkansas Razor
backs 10-3 and the Lamar Cardinals 8-
1, Stanford dropped a game to Tech 3-1
before beating Lamar again Monday 16-
9 and the Red Raiders 3-2 in the night
cap.
The Cardinal (38-23) faced the
Raiders (51-13) for the second time in
the tournament on Monday night after
advancing to the championship game
through the losers' bracket. Stanford
lost to the Raiders on Sunday and need
ed a victory to push Tech to a second
championship contest today.
The Raiders sported some mind-bog
gling statistics on their side going into
yesterday's game against Stanford.
Junior third baseman Clint Bryant took
a .786 average with three home runs
and 11 RBIs through three tournament
games. The team was batting .433 and
had scored 41 runs to its opponents' 16
in three games.
Stanford got on the big board first in
the bottom of the second. Senior right
fielder Dusty Allen singled to left and
stole second before he was taken home
by junior second baseman Brian Dal
limore's ground ball that dribbled into
left field.
Texas Tech's answer came quickly.
Bryant tied the ball game in the third
with a one-out line drive single to left
field that scored Jason Totman from
third. Andy Gonzales gave Tech a 2-1
lead with an RBI single in the next at
bat.
Stanford starter Mario Iglesias had

logged only 30 innings on the mound
this season for Stanford coming into the
tourney, and his only other career ctart
lasted five innings. But the junior right
hander held a powerful Raiders squad at
bay for a full nine innings, giving up
only five hits.
"I'm very proud of Mario," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said. "It was the
biggest game of the season and he comes
up big for us."
Tech sophomore southpaw JefT Peck
(10-2) managed a similar performance
against Stanford, allowing the Cardinal
four hits through six frames.
Stanford's bats showed signs of com
ing alive in the bottom of the sixth.
Junior left fielder Cale Carter cracked a
ball down the left field line that turned
into a triple as Carter hustled around
the bases. But Hinch and Carver both
struck out to allow Tech to preserve its
2-1 lead after six innings.

I'm very proud of
Mario [Iglesias]. It was
the biggest game of the
season and he comes
up big for us.'
— Mark Marquess

The Cardinal finally tied the game
the next inning when Dallimore
knocked his third hit of the game into
right field and scored Allen from second
base. The lead continued to elude Stan
ford, but pitching kept the Cardinal in
the game.
Iglesias retired nine Raiders in a row
beginning in the fifth frame before he
walked his third Tech batter in the
eighth. He then set down the last four
batters, finishing his complete game
against the No. 5 team in the country.
Stanford took to the plate in the bot
tom of the ninth with a chance to win
the game in regulation. Allen led off the
inning with a single and freshman des
ignated hitter Jon Schaeffer bunted
Allen to second. A walk and a groundout
left the Cardinal with runners on sec
ond and third with two outs.
Sophomore shortstop Eric Sees
stepped to the plate struggling. He had
no hits in the game and had hit only
.250 in the four previous contests. But
he knocked a long ball into the gap in
left center, driving home the winning
run and keeping Stanford alive in the
race for Omaha.
Dallimore had the big game, going 3-

for-3 with two RBIs on the day.
"I was fortunate to be the guy at the
plate at the right time," Dallimore said.
"And I was even more fortunate to be
able to come through at that time."
Stanford faced elimination in its
fourth game of the tourney but deliv
ered the favor to Lamar (38-24), ending
the fifth-seeded Cardinals' Cinderella
run for Omaha 16-9.
Junior lefty Dan Reed (4-4, 4.96
ERA) came out strong in the first
inning, sending the Cardinals' first
three batters back to the dugout. But
Lamar's freshman right-hander Eric
Cammack (4-0, 3.24 ERA) got in trouble
before the fans could comfortably adjust
their rear ends to the aluminum bleach
ers. Freshman center fielder Joe Kil
burg walked on four straight balls from
Cammack and Carter knocked a line
drive past second baseman Donny
Schroeder before a balk moved the run
ners to the corner. Lamar's troubles
came to a head when Hinch walked to
load the bases.
Carver stepped to the plate with no
outs and the bases loaded and drove a
stand-up double to the center-field wall.
Three runs scored on the blast and the
Cardinal led by three with no one out in
the first frame.
The scoring binge had yet to end.
With two outs Dallimore lofted a single
into shallow right-center field to score
Carver from second. Kent's blooper sin
gle to center spurred Lamar coach Jim
Gilligan to replace the battered fresh
man with another first-year hurler.
In the second, Hinch doubled down
the right-field line to take home Kilburg
and put the Cardinal up 5-0. Hinch stole
third and became Stanford's seventh
run when Allen emerged from his mini
slump and singled between third and
shortstop. Allen had struck out four
straight at bats before the hit and was
only 2-for-12 up to that point.
Lamar put two men on again in the
top of the third with no outs. After turn
ing a double play Stanford gave Lamar
its first run of the contest on a ground
ball that darted past Sees. Bob Rauch
drove in another run on a double to cut
the lead to four runs with men still at
second and third base. But Reed got
Robin Lindsey to ground out to second,
cutting the scoring drive short.
Stanford extended the lead in the
fourth when Hinch doubled in Kilburg
and Carter took home on a passed ball,
all with no outs in the inning. Carver
bounced a single over the pitcher and
into center field to score Hinch, and the

College World Series today.
lead was 9-2 — still with no Cardi
nal out in the fourth.
It was to be the second disas
trous inning for Lamar, an inning
it would be unable to recover from.
Allen walked and Schaeffer moved
the runners to second and third on
a groundout. That set up Brian
Dallimore's double down the left
field line that scored both Carver
jmd Allen and pushed the insur
mountable lead to 11-2.
As if the nine-point deficit
wasn't quite enough, Sees topped
it off with a single to right that
scored Dallimore. Sees was picked
off trying to take second base on
the play, and the inning was mer
cifully concluded.
The Cardinals began hitting
Reed hard in the fifth inning. Step
ping to the plate with two men on
base, Will Cook took the first step
toward overcoming the Stanford
lead when he launched a three-run
dinger to the lawn past left-center
field. Reed escaped the inning with
no more runs but gave up two long
fly balls that could have gone bye
bye with the help of a slight wind.
"We didn't want to go to the
bullpen much," Marquess said of
his desire to keep the pen fresh for
the championship matchup
against Texas Tech. "Reed gave us
six innings, and that was just what
we needed."
Stanford quickly responded to
Lamar's offense. The Cardinal
loaded the bases with two out in
the bottom of the fifth and nabbed
its second run of the game off a
Lamar balk. Schaeffer then flied
out, and the lead was 13-5 after
five.
"When they would get close we
would come back and score a cou
ple," Marquess said. "We kept a
comfortable cushion. We kept
scoring, that was the key."
The Cardinal offensive machine
answered Lamar's run in the top
of the sixth with one of its own.
Kilburg drove in Kent to make the
score 14-6 before he was thrown
out attempting to steal second.
Lamar refused to mosey back to

Beaumont without a fight. The
bases were loaded on sophomore
submariner Brendan Sullivan
with no outs in the eighth, and
Cook's double scored two and cut
the lead to 14-8. But Sullivan
found his touch after hitting two
batters in a row and retired the
sides before Lamar could cross the
plate again.
Just for good measure, Kilburg
tripled in Sees and then scored on
Carter's fly that dropped in the
gap in the bottom of the eighth.
Lamar put one more score on the
board in the top of the ninth to set
the final of 16-9.
Stanford had fallen into the
losers' bracket after dropping
game three to Texas Tech Sunday
night 3-1, in a contest that the
Cardinal could have taken.
Hinch gave Stanford the early
lead when, one pitch after knock
ing a ball over the fence but just
foul to left, took a pitch deep to
right-center. But Tech took the
lead in the bottom of the fourth
thanks to several key miscues by
Cardinal defenders.
Miscommunication on a rou
tine grounder between first and
second coupled with a legitimate
single put runners at the corners.
The rear runner moved into scor
ing position, and right fielder
Brandon Welch came to the plate
with two outs.
Welch drove several balls just
foul before popping up a high fly
ball between third and left that
looked like an easy final out. But
as Carver, Carter and Sees con
verged on the ball, it dropped
between them and two Raiders
crossed the plate.
"[Sees] was playing right,
behind second base," Marquess
said. "It was a long run, and he
just didn't get there to call off
Carver. We just didn't communi
cate."
The pitchers took over the
game from there, until Bartels got
into trouble in the seventh. He
lasted 6 2/3 innings before Sulli
van took over, putting out the fire
after Tech had scored the final
run.
The opening game on Sunday
for the Cardinal was against

Lamar, a surprise winner over
host Wichita State in their opener
the day before. Stanford posted its
second win of the tourney convinc
ingly, pounding out 14 hits in a
five-hit complete game by junior
southpaw Mike Robbins. All Stan
ford runs in the 8-1 victory came
with two outs.
As has been Stanford's signa
ture, the Cardinal scored quick
and in abundance. After retiring
the first two hitters of the inning,
Lamar southpaw Kevin Lane was
taken to the cleaners by Stanford
bats. Hinch blooped a single over
diving first baseman Morgan
Walker and Carver launched his
third home run in two games and
11th of the season over the right
field wall. The score was pushed to
3-0 when Lane gave Allen a fast
ball in the middle of the plate and
Allen sent the second long ball of
the inning into a horde of thrilled
fans in the right-field lawn.
The game was quickly put out
of reach when Stanford added
three more in the second frame.
Kilburg singled with two men out
before Carter lofted an RBI double
down the left-field line. Hinch
slapped a slow grounder between
third and shortstop to drive in
Carter. Hinch then stole second
base, and before he could dust off
his uniform was taken home by
Carver's double to left.
Lamar's Bob Rauch took Rob
bins deep in the bottom half of the
inning to cut the Cardinal lead to
6-1, but the Cardinal loaded the
bases again in the fourth frame.
Schaeffer's two-out single past
Walker's outstretched arms scored
the game's final two runs.
"To hold a team to only one run
in these conditions is truly a great
pitching performance," Marquess
said of Robbins' seven strikeout,
no walk complete game. Robbins
tossed 122 pitches in the contest
and at one point retired 13
straight Lamar batters.
"Their left-hander outsmarted
us," Lamar coach Jim Gilligan said
of Robbins. "He was keeping the
ball down at the knees and in the
dirt, and we were going down in
the dirt after him. He made us
swing at pitches we didn't have a

chance to hit. He out-pitched our
guys, and that's why they won."
Hot Stanford bats also helped
in the endeavor. The too of the
Cardinal order answered the call
as Kilburg, Carter and Carver all
hit 2-for-5 and Hinch went 3-for-5
in the game. They combined for
five RBIs and seven runs.
Stanford opened the tourney on
Saturday after all games were
rained out on Friday. The fourth
seeded Arkansas Razorbacks
became the Cardinal's first victim
in a 10-3 shellacking.
Carver's 2-for-5 showing at the
plate in the opener may not seem
outstanding on the surface. But in
light of the fact that both hits were
shots that traveled over the fence
and onto 21st Avenue, outstand
ing might not be a strong enough

Stanford a 1-0 lead and the

comfortable lead.
The scoring continued in the
second after Allen bounced an
over-the-wall double and was
moved to third base by Schaeffer.
Dallimore lopped a single to right
field and drove in Allen before Kil
burg sent Dallimore home on a
shot that got out of the infield. At
the end of two Stanford led 3-0.
The lead must not have been
enough in the mind of Carver, who
stepped to the plate for his second
at bat of the tourney and sent a
long ball 400 feet over the center
field fence.
The Razorbacks got on the
scoreboard for the first time in the
sixth inning. Arkansas right field
er Kit Pellow knocked a two-out
RBI single over second base, but
Stanford scored three runs in both
the seventh and eighth innings to
put the game away.
Kent took his first pitch into
the left-field bleachers for his third
homer of the season. Sees followed
with a double and Kilburg moved
Sees to third. Carter singled in

Sees, but before the inning was
over Carter had been balked home
by Rob Quamstrom and the score
was 7-1.
The Hogs made the score a little
less ugly in the top half of the
eighth. Peterson loaded the bases,
aided by an error on Carver. The
freshman ace then hit a Razorback
and sent one run home with no
outs. A passed ball scored
Arkansas' final run, and Peterson
wriggled out of the jam with no
earned runs allowed.
Stanford's run total reached
double-digits in its next-to-last at
bat, when Kilburg stepped to the
plate and took a 3-2 pitch out of
the park for his first career home
run, setting the 10-3 final in
stone.
Peterson's show on the mound
was par for this freshman sensa
tion's course. He worked the full
nine innings, giving up nine hits in
a tough wind and only one earned
run. With the victory Peterson
(12-1) surpassed Jack McDowell
for the most victories by a Stan
ford freshman.
"Originally my role was to be as

its second run of the game off a
Lamar balk. Schaeffer then flied
out, and the lead was 13-5 after
five.
"When they would get close we
would come back and score a cou
ple," Marquess said. "We kept a
comfortable cushion. We kept
scoring, that was the key."
The Cardinal offensive machine
answered Lamar's run in the top
of the sixth with one of its own.
Kilburg drove in Kent to make the
score 14-6 before he was thrown
out attempting to steal second.
Lamar refused to mosey back to

Beaumont without a fight. The
bases were loaded on sophomore
submariner Brendan Sullivan
with no outs in the eighth, and
Cook's double scored two and cut
the lead to 14-8. But Sullivan
found his touch after hitting two
batters in a row and retired the
sides before Lamar could cross the
plate again.
Just for good measure, Kilburg
tripled in Sees and then scored on
Carter's fly that dropped in the
gap in the bottom of the eighth.
Lamar put one more score on the
board in the top of the ninth to set
the final of 16-9.
Stanford had fallen into the
losers' bracket after dropping
game three to Texas Tech Sunday
night 3-1, in a contest that the
Cardinal could have taken.
Hinch gave Stanford the early
lead when, one pitch after knock
ing a ball over the fence but just
foul to left, took a pitch deep to
right-center. But Tech took the
lead in the bottom of the fourth
thanks to several key miscues by
Cardinal defenders.
Miscommunication on a rou
tine grounder between first and
second coupled with a legitimate
single put runners at the corners.
The rear runner moved into scor
ing position, and right fielder
Brandon Welch came to the plate
with two outs.
Welch drove several balls just
foul before popping up a high fly
ball between third and left that
looked like an easy final out. But
as Carver, Carter and Sees con
verged on the ball, it dropped
between them and two Raiders
crossed the plate.
"[Sees] was playing right,
behind second base," Marquess
said. "It was a long run, and he
just didn't get there to call off
Carver. We just didn't communi
cate."
The pitchers took over the
game from there, until Bartels got
into trouble in the seventh. He
lasted 6 2/3 innings before Sulli
van took over, putting out the fire
after Tech had scored the final
run.
The opening game on Sunday
for the Cardinal was against

Lamar, a surprise winner over
host Wichita State in their opener
the day before. Stanford posted its
second win of the tourney convinc
ingly, pounding out 14 hits in a
five-hit complete game by junior
southpaw Mike Robbins. All Stan
ford runs in the 8-1 victory came
with two outs.
As has been Stanford's signa
ture, the Cardinal scored quick
and in abundance. After retiring
the first two hitters of the inning,
Lamar southpaw Kevin Lane was
taken to the cleaners by Stanford
bats. Hinch blooped a single over
diving first baseman Morgan
Walker and Carver launched his
third home run in two games and
11th of the season over the right
field wall. The score was pushed to
3-0 when Lane gave Allen a fast
ball in the middle of the plate and
Allen sent the second long ball of
the inning into a horde of thrilled
fans in the right-field lawn.
The game was quickly put out
of reach when Stanford added
three more in the second frame.
Kilburg singled with two men out
before Carter lofted an RBI double
down the left-field line. Hinch
slapped a slow grounder between
third and shortstop to drive in
Carter. Hinch then stole second
base, and before he could dust off
his uniform was taken home by
Carver's double to left.
Lamar's Bob Rauch took Rob
bins deep in the bottom half of the
inning to cut the Cardinal lead to
6-1, but the Cardinal loaded the
bases again in the fourth frame.
Schaeffer's two-out single past
Walker's outstretched arms scored
the game's final two runs.
"To hold a team to only one run
in these conditions is truly a great
pitching performance," Marquess
said of Robbins' seven strikeout,
no walk complete game. Robbins
tossed 122 pitches in the contest
and at one point retired 13
straight Lamar batters.
"Their left-hander outsmarted
us," Lamar coach Jim Gilligan said
of Robbins. "He was keeping the
ball down at the knees and in the
dirt, and we were going down in
the dirt after him. He made us
swing at pitches we didn't have a

chance to hit. He out-pitched our
guys, and that's why they won."
Hot Stanford bats also helped
in the endeavor. The too of the
Cardinal order answered the call
as Kilburg, Carter and Carver all
hit 2-for-5 and Hinch went 3-for-5
in the game. They combined for
five RBIs and seven runs.
Stanford opened the tourney on
Saturday after all games were
rained out on Friday. The fourth
seeded Arkansas Razorbacks
became the Cardinal's first victim
in a 10-3 shellacking.
Carver's 2-for-5 showing at the
plate in the opener may not seem
outstanding on the surface. But in
light of the fact that both hits were
shots that traveled over the fence
and onto 21st Avenue, outstand
ing might not be a strong enough
word for Carver's contribution.
His work began early. After a
scoreless first inning, Carver took
the first offering from Matt
Carnes in the second over the cen
ter-field wall. While the homer was
aided out of the park by a blustery
wind, the blast nonetheless gave
Stanford a 1-0 lead and the
momentum it needed to open up a
comfortable lead.
The scoring continued in the
second after Allen bounced an
over-the-wall double and was
moved to third base by Schaeffer.
Dallimore lopped a single to right
field and drove in Allen before Kil
burg sent Dallimore home on a
shot that got out of the infield. At
the end of two Stanford led 3-0.
The lead must not have been
enough in the mind of Carver, who
stepped to the plate for his second
at bat of the tourney and sent a
long ball 400 feet over the center
field fence.
The Razorbacks got on the
scoreboard for the first time in the
sixth inning. Arkansas right field
er Kit Pellow knocked a two-out
RBI single over second base, but
Stanford scored three runs in both
the seventh and eighth innings to
put the game away.
Kent took his first pitch into
the left-field bleachers for his third
homer of the season. Sees followed
with a double and Kilburg moved
Sees to third. Carter singled in

Sees, but before the inning was
over Carter had been balked home
by Rob Quamstrom and the score
was 7-1.
The Hogs made the score a little
less ugly in the top half of the
eighth. Peterson loaded the bases,
aided by an error on Carver. The
freshman ace then hit a Razorback
and sent one run home with no
outs. A passed ball scored
Arkansas' final run, and Peterson
wriggled out of the jam with no
earned runs allowed.
Stanford's run total reached
double-digits in its next-to-last at
bat, when Kilburg stepped to the
plate and took a 3-2 pitch out of
the park for his first career home
run, setting the 10-3 final in
stone.
Peterson's show on the mound
was par for this freshman sensa
tion's course. He worked the full
nine innings, giving up nine hits in
a tough wind and only one earned
run. With the victory Peterson
(12-1) surpassed Jack McDowell
for the most victories by a Stan
ford freshman.
"Originally my role was to be as
a reUever, with maybe a spot start
her and there," Peterson said.
"Things have just really worked
out this year. It's unbelievable to
be compared to Jack McDowell."
The game marked Peterson's
eighth complete game of the year.
The gusting wind that blew out to
right field throughout the contest
made it more difficult for the Car
dinal ace, but he had devised a
game plan and stuck to it.
"I just wanted to keep the ball
down in the wind," Peterson said.
"I was trying to hit the corners
around the knees."
Although Stanford has consis
tently supported Peterson offen
sively all year long, Marquess has
been able to count on him all year
long to keep the opponent's score
to a minimum.
"Kyle had a great game," Mar
quess said. "He didn't pitch like a
freshman out there. He's done
that a lot this year."
Peterson was only threatened
with big-run possibilities a few
times in the game, and in both
cases he worked out of the jam.
WICHITA, Kan. — A lot of homers.
A lot of hits. A lot of runs. A lot of wind.

offensively in Wichita, Kan., during the
weekend's Midwest I baseball regional.
The average number of runs scored
per game was over 20 for the first two
days of the tournament, with the Cardi
nal getting its share. Stanford scored 10
runs against Arkansas, had 24 runs in
two games vs. Lamar and pounded 40
hits in those three games.
With a 4-1 record in the tournament,
Stanford has done almost everything as
it has played its best baseball of the sea
son. There is just one more thing left
undone, and today at 8 a.m. PDT the
Cardinal will have a chance to do it.
The complexities of the tournament
system are a thing of the past. It's very
simple from here on out — win against
top-seeded Texas Tech and take a trip to
Omaha for the College World Series.
Lose and take a trip to Palo Alto for
spring quarter finals.
After beating the Arkansas Razor
backs 10-3 and the Lamar Cardinals 8-
1, Stanford dropped a game to Tech 3-1
before beating Lamar again Monday 16-
9 and the Red Raiders 3-2 in the night
cap.
The Cardinal (38-23) faced the
Raiders (51-13) for the second time in
the tournament on Monday night after
advancing to the championship game
through the losers' bracket. Stanford
lost to the Raiders on Sunday and need
ed a victory to push Tech to a second
championship contest today.
The Raiders sported some mind-bog
gling statistics on their side going into
yesterday's game against Stanford.
Junior third baseman Clint Bryant took
a .786 average with three home runs
and 11 RBIs through three tournament
games. The team was batting .433 and
had scored 41 runs to its opponents' 16
in three games.
Stanford got on the big board first in
the bottom of the second. Senior right
fielder Dusty Allen singled to left and
stole second before he was taken home
by junior second baseman Brian Dal
limore's ground ball that dribbled into
left field.
Texas Tech's answer came quickly.
Bryant tied the ball game in the third
with a one-out line drive single to left
field that scored Jason Totman from
third. Andy Gonzales gave Tech a 2-1
lead with an RBI single in the next at
bat.
Stanford starter Mario Iglesias had

logged only 30 innings on the mound
this season for Stanford coming into the
tourney, and his only other career ctart
lasted five innings. But the junior right
hander held a powerful Raiders squad at
bay for a full nine innings, giving up
only five hits.
"I'm very proud of Mario," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said. "It was the
biggest game of the season and he comes
up big for us."
Tech sophomore southpaw JefT Peck
(10-2) managed a similar performance
against Stanford, allowing the Cardinal
four hits through six frames.
Stanford's bats showed signs of com
ing alive in the bottom of the sixth.
Junior left fielder Cale Carter cracked a
ball down the left field line that turned
into a triple as Carter hustled around
the bases. But Hinch and Carver both
struck out to allow Tech to preserve its
2-1 lead after six innings.

I'm very proud of
Mario [Iglesias]. It was
the biggest game of the
season and he comes
up big for us.'
— Mark Marquess

The Cardinal finally tied the game
the next inning when Dallimore
knocked his third hit of the game into
right field and scored Allen from second
base. The lead continued to elude Stan
ford, but pitching kept the Cardinal in
the game.
Iglesias retired nine Raiders in a row
beginning in the fifth frame before he
walked his third Tech batter in the
eighth. He then set down the last four
batters, finishing his complete game
against the No. 5 team in the country.
Stanford took to the plate in the bot
tom of the ninth with a chance to win
the game in regulation. Allen led off the
inning with a single and freshman des
ignated hitter Jon Schaeffer bunted
Allen to second. A walk and a groundout
left the Cardinal with runners on sec
ond and third with two outs.
Sophomore shortstop Eric Sees
stepped to the plate struggling. He had
no hits in the game and had hit only
.250 in the four previous contests. But
he knocked a long ball into the gap in
left center, driving home the winning
run and keeping Stanford alive in the
race for Omaha.
Dallimore had the big game, going 3-

for-3 with two RBIs on the day.
"I was fortunate to be the guy at the
plate at the right time," Dallimore said.
"And I was even more fortunate to be
able to come through at that time."
Stanford faced elimination in its
fourth game of the tourney but deliv
ered the favor to Lamar (38-24), ending
the fifth-seeded Cardinals' Cinderella
run for Omaha 16-9.
Junior lefty Dan Reed (4-4, 4.96
ERA) came out strong in the first
inning, sending the Cardinals' first
three batters back to the dugout. But
Lamar's freshman right-hander Eric
Cammack (4-0, 3.24 ERA) got in trouble
before the fans could comfortably adjust
their rear ends to the aluminum bleach
ers. Freshman center fielder Joe Kil
burg walked on four straight balls from
Cammack and Carter knocked a line
drive past second baseman Donny
Schroeder before a balk moved the run
ners to the corner. Lamar's troubles
came to a head when Hinch walked to
load the bases.
Carver stepped to the plate with no
outs and the bases loaded and drove a
stand-up double to the center-field wall.
Three runs scored on the blast and the
Cardinal led by three with no one out in
the first frame.
The scoring binge had yet to end.
With two outs Dallimore lofted a single
into shallow right-center field to score
Carver from second. Kent's blooper sin
gle to center spurred Lamar coach Jim
Gilligan to replace the battered fresh
man with another first-year hurler.
In the second, Hinch doubled down
the right-field line to take home Kilburg
and put the Cardinal up 5-0. Hinch stole
third and became Stanford's seventh
run when Allen emerged from his mini
slump and singled between third and
shortstop. Allen had struck out four
straight at bats before the hit and was
only 2-for-12 up to that point.
Lamar put two men on again in the
top of the third with no outs. After turn
ing a double play Stanford gave Lamar
its first run of the contest on a ground
ball that darted past Sees. Bob Rauch
drove in another run on a double to cut
the lead to four runs with men still at
second and third base. But Reed got
Robin Lindsey to ground out to second,
cutting the scoring drive short.
Stanford extended the lead in the
fourth when Hinch doubled in Kilburg
and Carter took home on a passed ball,
all with no outs in the inning. Carver
bounced a single over the pitcher and
into center field to score Hinch, and the

College World Series today.
lead was 9-2 — still with no Cardi
nal out in the fourth.
It was to be the second disas
trous inning for Lamar, an inning
it would be unable to recover from.
Allen walked and Schaeffer moved
the runners to second and third on
a groundout. That set up Brian
Dallimore's double down the left
field line that scored both Carver
jmd Allen and pushed the insur
mountable lead to 11-2.
As if the nine-point deficit
wasn't quite enough, Sees topped
it off with a single to right that
scored Dallimore. Sees was picked
off trying to take second base on
the play, and the inning was mer
cifully concluded.
The Cardinals began hitting
Reed hard in the fifth inning. Step
ping to the plate with two men on
base, Will Cook took the first step
toward overcoming the Stanford
lead when he launched a three-run
dinger to the lawn past left-center
field. Reed escaped the inning with
no more runs but gave up two long
fly balls that could have gone bye
bye with the help of a slight wind.
"We didn't want to go to the
bullpen much," Marquess said of
his desire to keep the pen fresh for
the championship matchup
against Texas Tech. "Reed gave us
six innings, and that was just what
we needed."
Stanford quickly responded to
Lamar's offense. The Cardinal
loaded the bases with two out in
the bottom of the fifth and nabbed
its second run of the game off a
Lamar balk. Schaeffer then flied
out, and the lead was 13-5 after
five.
"When they would get close we
would come back and score a cou
ple," Marquess said. "We kept a
comfortable cushion. We kept
scoring, that was the key."
The Cardinal offensive machine
answered Lamar's run in the top
of the sixth with one of its own.
Kilburg drove in Kent to make the
score 14-6 before he was thrown
out attempting to steal second.
Lamar refused to mosey back to

Beaumont without a fight. The
bases were loaded on sophomore
submariner Brendan Sullivan
with no outs in the eighth, and
Cook's double scored two and cut
the lead to 14-8. But Sullivan
found his touch after hitting two
batters in a row and retired the
sides before Lamar could cross the
plate again.
Just for good measure, Kilburg
tripled in Sees and then scored on
Carter's fly that dropped in the
gap in the bottom of the eighth.
Lamar put one more score on the
board in the top of the ninth to set
the final of 16-9.
Stanford had fallen into the
losers' bracket after dropping
game three to Texas Tech Sunday
night 3-1, in a contest that the
Cardinal could have taken.
Hinch gave Stanford the early
lead when, one pitch after knock
ing a ball over the fence but just
foul to left, took a pitch deep to
right-center. But Tech took the
lead in the bottom of the fourth
thanks to several key miscues by
Cardinal defenders.
Miscommunication on a rou
tine grounder between first and
second coupled with a legitimate
single put runners at the corners.
The rear runner moved into scor
ing position, and right fielder
Brandon Welch came to the plate
with two outs.
Welch drove several balls just
foul before popping up a high fly
ball between third and left that
looked like an easy final out. But
as Carver, Carter and Sees con
verged on the ball, it dropped
between them and two Raiders
crossed the plate.
"[Sees] was playing right,
behind second base," Marquess
said. "It was a long run, and he
just didn't get there to call off
Carver. We just didn't communi
cate."
The pitchers took over the
game from there, until Bartels got
into trouble in the seventh. He
lasted 6 2/3 innings before Sulli
van took over, putting out the fire
after Tech had scored the final
run.

inning to cut the Cardinal lead to
6-1, but the Cardinal loaded the
bases again in the fourth frame.
Schaeffer's two-out single past
Walker's outstretched arms scored
the game's final two runs.
"To hold a team to only one run
in these conditions is truly a great
pitching performance," Marquess
said of Robbins' seven strikeout,
no walk complete game. Robbins
tossed 122 pitches in the contest
and at one point retired 13

the end of two Stanford led 3-0.
The lead must not have been
enough in the mind of Carver, who
stepped to the plate for his second
at bat of the tourney and sent a
long ball 400 feet over the center
field fence.
The Razorbacks got on the
scoreboard for the first time in the
sixth inning. Arkansas right field
er Kit Pellow knocked a two-out
RBI single over second base, but
Stanford scored three runs in both
the seventh and eighth innings to
put the game away.
Kent took his first pitch into
the left-field bleachers for his third
homer of the season. Sees followed
with a double and Kilburg moved
Sees to third. Carter singled in

Sees, but before the inning was
over Carter had been balked home
by Rob Quamstrom and the score
was 7-1.
The Hogs made the score a little
less ugly in the top half of the
eighth. Peterson loaded the bases,
aided by an error on Carver. The
freshman ace then hit a Razorback
and sent one run home with no
outs. A passed ball scored
Arkansas' final run, and Peterson

Stanford's run total reached
double-digits in its next-to-last at

the park for his first career home
run, setting the 10-3 final in
stone.
Peterson's show on the mound
was par for this freshman sensa
tion's course. He worked the full
nine innings, giving up nine hits in
a tough wind and only one earned
run. With the victory Peterson
(12-1) surpassed Jack McDowell
for the most victories by a Stan
