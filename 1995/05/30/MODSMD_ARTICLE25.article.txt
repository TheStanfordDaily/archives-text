## Baseball takes four of five, plays today for Omaha 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
WICHITA, Kan. — A lot of homers.
A lot of hits. A lot of runs. A lot of wind.
1 here was a lot of almost everything
offensively in Wichita, Kan., during the
weekend's Midwest I baseball regional.
The average number of runs scored
per game was over 20 for the first two
days of the tournament, with the Cardi
nal getting its share. Stanford scored 10
runs against Arkansas, had 24 runs in
two games vs. Lamar and pounded 40
hits in those three games.
With a 4-1 record in the tournament,
Stanford has done almost everything as
it has played its best baseball of the sea
son. There is just one more thing left
undone, and today at 8 a.m. PDT the
Cardinal will have a chance to do it.
The complexities of the tournament
system are a thing of the past. It's very
simple from here on out — win against
top-seeded Texas Tech and take a trip to
Omaha for the College World Series.
Lose and take a trip to Palo Alto for
spring quarter finals.
After beating the Arkansas Razor
backs 10-3 and the Lamar Cardinals 8-
1, Stanford dropped a game to Tech 3-1
before beating Lamar again Monday 16-
9 and the Red Raiders 3-2 in the night
cap.
The Cardinal (38-23) faced the
Raiders (51-13) for the second time in
the tournament on Monday night after
advancing to the championship game
through the losers' bracket. Stanford
lost to the Raiders on Sunday and need
ed a victory to push Tech to a second
championship contest today.
The Raiders sported some mind-bog
gling statistics on their side going into
yesterday's game against Stanford.
Junior third baseman Clint Bryant took
a .786 average with three home runs
and 11 RBIs through three tournament
games. The team was batting .433 and
had scored 41 runs to its opponents' 16
in three games.
Stanford got on the big board first in
the bottom of the second. Senior right
fielder Dusty Allen singled to left and
stole second before he was taken home
by junior second baseman Brian Dal
limore's ground ball that dribbled into
left field.
Texas Tech's answer came quickly.
Bryant tied the ball game in the third
with a one-out line drive single to left
field that scored Jason Totman from
third. Andy Gonzales gave Tech a 2-1
lead with an RBI single in the next at
bat.
Stanford starter Mario Iglesias had

logged only 30 innings on the mound
this season for Stanford coming into the
tourney, and his only other career ctart
lasted five innings. But the junior right
hander held a powerful Raiders squad at
bay for a full nine innings, giving up
only five hits.
"I'm very proud of Mario," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said. "It was the
biggest game of the season and he comes
up big for us."
Tech sophomore southpaw JefT Peck
(10-2) managed a similar performance
against Stanford, allowing the Cardinal
four hits through six frames.
Stanford's bats showed signs of com
ing alive in the bottom of the sixth.
Junior left fielder Cale Carter cracked a
ball down the left field line that turned
into a triple as Carter hustled around
the bases. But Hinch and Carver both
struck out to allow Tech to preserve its
2-1 lead after six innings.

I'm very proud of
Mario [Iglesias]. It was
the biggest game of the
season and he comes
up big for us.'
— Mark Marquess

The Cardinal finally tied the game
the next inning when Dallimore
knocked his third hit of the game into
right field and scored Allen from second
base. The lead continued to elude Stan
ford, but pitching kept the Cardinal in
the game.
Iglesias retired nine Raiders in a row
beginning in the fifth frame before he
walked his third Tech batter in the
eighth. He then set down the last four
batters, finishing his complete game
against the No. 5 team in the country.
Stanford took to the plate in the bot
tom of the ninth with a chance to win
the game in regulation. Allen led off the
inning with a single and freshman des
ignated hitter Jon Schaeffer bunted
Allen to second. A walk and a groundout
left the Cardinal with runners on sec
ond and third with two outs.
Sophomore shortstop Eric Sees
stepped to the plate struggling. He had
no hits in the game and had hit only
.250 in the four previous contests. But
he knocked a long ball into the gap in
left center, driving home the winning
run and keeping Stanford alive in the
race for Omaha.
Dallimore had the big game, going 3-

for-3 with two RBIs on the day.
"I was fortunate to be the guy at the
plate at the right time," Dallimore said.
"And I was even more fortunate to be
able to come through at that time."
Stanford faced elimination in its
fourth game of the tourney but deliv
ered the favor to Lamar (38-24), ending
the fifth-seeded Cardinals' Cinderella
run for Omaha 16-9.
Junior lefty Dan Reed (4-4, 4.96
ERA) came out strong in the first
inning, sending the Cardinals' first
three batters back to the dugout. But
Lamar's freshman right-hander Eric
Cammack (4-0, 3.24 ERA) got in trouble
before the fans could comfortably adjust
their rear ends to the aluminum bleach
ers. Freshman center fielder Joe Kil
burg walked on four straight balls from
Cammack and Carter knocked a line
drive past second baseman Donny
Schroeder before a balk moved the run
ners to the corner. Lamar's troubles
came to a head when Hinch walked to
load the bases.
Carver stepped to the plate with no
outs and the bases loaded and drove a
stand-up double to the center-field wall.
Three runs scored on the blast and the
Cardinal led by three with no one out in
the first frame.
The scoring binge had yet to end.
With two outs Dallimore lofted a single
into shallow right-center field to score
Carver from second. Kent's blooper sin
gle to center spurred Lamar coach Jim
Gilligan to replace the battered fresh
man with another first-year hurler.
In the second, Hinch doubled down
the right-field line to take home Kilburg
and put the Cardinal up 5-0. Hinch stole
third and became Stanford's seventh
run when Allen emerged from his mini
slump and singled between third and
shortstop. Allen had struck out four
straight at bats before the hit and was
only 2-for-12 up to that point.
Lamar put two men on again in the
top of the third with no outs. After turn
ing a double play Stanford gave Lamar
its first run of the contest on a ground
ball that darted past Sees. Bob Rauch
drove in another run on a double to cut
the lead to four runs with men still at
second and third base. But Reed got
Robin Lindsey to ground out to second,
cutting the scoring drive short.
Stanford extended the lead in the
fourth when Hinch doubled in Kilburg
and Carter took home on a passed ball,
all with no outs in the inning. Carver
bounced a single over the pitcher and
into center field to score Hinch, and the
