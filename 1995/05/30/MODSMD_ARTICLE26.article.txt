# Repeat of last year
## Women sailors struggle mightily at nationals Top-ranked women find May sailing unkind again 
### Michael Jensen Contributing writer 
For the second consecutive year, a
promising Stanford women's sailing
team finished a disappointing ninth at
the Women's Fleet Racing National
Championships.
Going into the regatta, the No. 1
Cardinal aimed for a top four finish.
Stanford coach Steve Bourdow felt that
good starts could unlock the key to the
team's first national championship.
Starts, however, proved to be the Car
dinal's detriment, in more ways than
one.
Sailors 112 rom 16 schools competed in
the two-division regatta held over
three days in San Diego. In the A divi
sion, Stanford's team of sophomore
skipper Alice Manard and junior crew
Sybil Diver got off to a rough start. The
pair crossed the starting line early in
the first race of the event and had to
struggle to catch up to the rest of the
field after restarting. The second race
put the boat deeper in the hole with a
withdrawal. A withdrawal, similar to a
disqualification, is the voluntary
removal of a team due to a rules infrac
tion. On the scoreboard, the result goes
down as a last-place finish plus one
point. Despite having 14 races remain
ing, the two setbacks were too much to
overcome for the A division team.
Stanford's B division boat fared bet

ter than its Cardinal counterpart.
Junior skipper Cinnamon Hampikian
teamed with freshman crew Susan
Bradford to post several impressive
top-five races. Hampikian had looked
sharp in practice preceding the regatta
and continued to build on her prepara
tion. The pair's greatest area of
improvement, boat speed, enabled
Stanford to hold onto the B division

'Starting seemed to be
the key for the top
teams. That was our
overall biggest weak
ness.'
â€” Steve Bourdow

lead with less than half the regatta
remaining.
By the final day of races, Stanford
stood at eighth place in the standings
and set a top-five finish as a realistic
goal. Once again, a course infraction
damaged the Cardinal's chances. Stan
ford's B-division boat barely grazed a
competitor's vessel in pre-start maneu
verings. Both boats decided the infrac
tion was minor enough to go unreport
ed; however, the judges felt differently.

Stanford was forced to accept another
withdrawal, dropping Hampikian and
Bradford from third to fifth place in
the final standings. Rules throughout
the national championship were
enforced more strictly than normally
in competition, prompting Bourdow to
say, "They went by the book; we left
our book at home."
Bourdow decided to go with junior
skipper Gretchen Uznis in A division
on the final day of competition. Uznis
had little preparation, and Bourdow's
switch proved unsuccessful. Although
the re-inserted Manard finished
strong, Stanford could finish no better
than 11th in the A division.
On all three days and in both divi
sions, starting hampered the Cardinal
and propelled the opposition. Stanford
had a tough time making the tactical
transition from the start to the flow of
the race. With mild conditions a rela
tive non-factor, starts separated the
best from the rest.
"Starting seemed to be the key for
the top teams," Bourdow said. "That
was our overall biggest weakness.
"We had enough good races to still
have respect," Bourdow said. "Our tal
ent is better than a No. 9 team."
With no graduating sailors, the
women will have another year to see if
they can fulfill their coach's words and
get over the hump at national champi
onships.
