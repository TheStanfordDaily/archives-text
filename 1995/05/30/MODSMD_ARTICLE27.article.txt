# Stanford closes with team races
## 
### Michael Jensen Contributing writer 
Stanford sailing is looking
to have a little fun this week
at the Team Racing National
Championships. After a bit
terly frustrating defeat in
regionals, the team hopes to
rediscover the joy of the sport
and surprise some folks along
the way.
"We're the wild card," said
Stanford coach Steve Bour
dow. "We're going to gain
experience by having fun and
enjoying the races."
Before you begin to ques
tion the Cardinal's motives
for spending the next three
days in Long Beach, it is
important to point out some
of the other objectives. In fact,
Bourdow thinks relaxing will
help Stanford achieve its goal
of a top-four finish.
Stanford will compete
against 12 other teams in pre
liminary round robin competi
tion. The field will be nar
rowed to four on the final day
of the event, with the partici
pating teams carrying over
their initial records. Navy and
Tufts are expected to vie for
the title.
The format of the racing
pits three boats from each
school against each other.
Tactics, communication and
teamwork are stressed, as
boats must rely upon each
other for positioning and
strategy. Bourdow plans to
rotate four teams throughout
the event. Senior skipper
Charles Meade and freshman
crew Mara Hoiian, along with
the boat of junior captain
Adam Lowry and freshman
crew Betsy Carmichael,
should spend most of the
races on the water. The team
of freshman John Meade and
sophomore crew Megan Ire
son will split time with freshmen
Danny Zimbaldi and Heather
Rogers. Lowry made a late charge
in practice to crack the starting
lineup.
"Lowry has a little more expe
rience," Bourdow said. "His
effort and attitude have earned
him this shot."
The light-to-moderate wind
should be similar to the condi
tions of Stanford's practice facili
ty in Redwood City; however,
Bourdow does not see this as any
particular advantage.
In practice prior to the compe
tition, Stanford has moved away
from the technical aspects of sail
ing. After the team's disappoint
ing failure to advance to the
fmals in fleet racing, the focus
has switched to the fundamen
tals of sailing.
"We've gone back to basics â€”
going faster and doing the
maneuvers," Bourdow said.
Despite the positive attitude,
Bourdow realizes the chore
ahead of the Cardinal this week
end. If Stanford hopes to advance
to the final four teams, it must
capture a couple of upset victo
ries.
"I think they can do it," Bour
dow said. "It's going to be tough,
intense sailing."
