The Stanford women's golf team ended its
season Saturday afternoon in Wilmington,
N.C., finishing in fourth place at the NCAA
championships with a four-round total of
1,188 (36 over par).
In a year in which the Cardinal rose to its
highest-ever ranking of No. 2 in the nation, the
squad tied for a school-best NCAA finish at the
par-72, 6,061-yard Landfall-Dye Golf Course.
In 1992, the Cardinal also placed fourth at Ari
zona State's Karsten Golf Course.
The No. 1 Arizona State Sun Devils won
their third consecutive NCAA title, looking like
the team that had not lost a tournament the
entire year in cruising to a 3-over-par total of
1,155. Arizona State shot the best rounds of
the day three out of four times and expanded
its lead with each successive round played.
No. 3 San Jose State, which had played hot
potato with the Cardinal all year for the No. 2
ranking, finished in the second position with
1,181, 26 strokes behind the champion Sun
Devils. Fifth-ranked Wake Forest (1,185) fol
lowed the Spartans into third place.
Finishing behind Stanford were No. 13 Indi
ana (1,194) in fifth, No. 12 Furman (1,195) in
sixth, No. 4 UCLA (1,199) in seventh, and No.
17 North Carolina (1,203) in eighth.
Among individuals, Arizona State's Kristel
Mourgue d'Algue fired a final 2-under-par
round of 70 to win the tournament by two
strokes over San Jose State's Vibeke Stensrud
and fellow Sun Devil Wendy Ward.
Mourgue d'Algue finished with a 5-under
par 283, making a six-foot putt to clinch her
first ever NCAA title.
The Cardinal played its best golf of the tour
nament during the third round of Friday, fir
ing a 4-over-par 292 to move from a tie for
fourth place after Thursday's competition into
sole possession of third.
Sophomore Mhairi McKay led the way for
Stanford with her second consecutive 3-under
par round of 69, which catapulted her from
13th place to fifth in the individual standings.
It was the only sub-70 round of the day out of
the 102 golfers who competed at the NCAAs.
"I felt like I hit it really well today," McKay
said on Friday, after finishing with three
birdies on the final four holes. "Our aim was to
play in the final grouping in the final day, and
we achieved that goal."
"Mhairi is hitting the ball a ton right now,"
head coach Tim Baldwin said. "I think there's
only one person in the women's game who is
hitting it any further off the tee — and that's
professional Laura Da vies."
Also having a good day on Friday
was McKay's roommate, fellow
sophomore Andrea Baxter, who
fired an even-par 72 and placed her
self into a tie for sixth. Baxter also
played the tournament with a
pulled muscle in her back, which
occurred during the second round
of competition.
"The back doesn't feel so good,"
Baxter said. "I'm in constant pain,
but I'm not worried about that. I
was disappointed in bogey ing two of
the first seven holes, but I think I
made up for it coming down the
wire today."
Another solid performance was
turned in by junior Vicky Strada,
whose 74 was her best round of the
tournament and moved her up 18
places into a tie for 35th.
"I hit it a lot better today,
although I still didn't make any
long putts," Strada said. "That was
basically my only negative."
Senior Jamille Jose was sailing
alone at 3-over-par on Friday until

he ran into trouble and double
bogeyed the 17th hole to finish with
a 77. Her score raised her individu
al standing from a tie for 42nd to a
tie for 51st.
"I really had only two bad holes,
the ninth and the 17th," Jose said.
"Both were double bogeys. I
haven't had this many double
bogeys in quite awhile."
Senior Amy Lawrence rounded
out Friday's competition for the
Cardinal, posting a disappointing
82 and rising to 72nd in the stand
ings. Her round, which began with
two straight bogeys, was the team's
highest and was not counted.
"I was happy with the way we
finished today," Baldwin said after
Friday*B play had concluded. "We
certainly know how to finish, but
that's not always easy to do. We
hope to do well in the glamour of
the TV lights tomorrow."
Unfortunately, either those
lights or the gusting North Caroli
na wind played havoc with the Car
dinal's Saturday rounds, as the
team shot a 15-over-par 303, its
worst round of the tournament,
and retreated from third place to
fourth in the final team standings.
Baxter did her part to help her
team's fortunes by firing a 1-over

par 73. Her 1-over-par final score of
289 was good enough for fifth place
in the individual competition. That
finish was tied for the second-best
in history by a Stanford player at
the NCAAs. Only Audrey Wood
ing's third-place performance in
1992 was better.
"I was happy with the way I
played the tournament for the most
part," Baxter said. "It's tough to
play solid all four days here in the
NCAA tournament. The competi
tion is just unbelievable. But I was
happy with our team, because
everyone came through at some
time during the tournament. We
accomplished a lot of our goals."
Baxter was named an Honorable
Mention All-American by the
National Golf Coaches Association.
She wound up as Stanford's leader
in each of the last three tourna
ments of the year — the Pacific 10
Championships, where she finished
fifth; the Regionals, where she fin
ished second; and the NCAAs,
where she finished fifth.
Not so stellar on Saturday was
McKay, who fired a 6-over-par 78,
mostly because of a quadruple
bogey on the second hole in which
she sent two shots into the water
near the green. That score dropped

her to a 5-over-par final tally of 293
and a tie for ninth. Despite her
troubles, McKay was named a sec
ond-team All-American.
"I was kind of wild, especially at
the beginning," McKay said. "At
No. 2,1 just didn't hit my first shot
hard enough and it fell back off the
green into the water. That's where
it all began."
Strada, who shot a 75 and fin
ished tied for 35th with a total of
303, provided the Cardinal with the
most electrifying moment of the
tournament when she aced the par
-3 eighth hole.
"I hit it really well," Strada said
of her hole-in-one. "It took one
bounce (about six inches in front of
the hole), and went in. No one was
more surprised than I was. Need
less to say, I was pleased."
The hole-in-one was Stanford's
first in competition since Kathy
Nino had one at the Stanford Golf
Course in 1982 while the Cardinal
was hosting the NCAA champi
onships.
Playing in their final competitive
rounds of golf Saturday were
seniors Lawrence and Jose.
Lawrence rebounded from shaky
rounds Thursday and Friday to
post a stable 5-over-par 77 on the

final day.
"I'm just happy I'm going to
graduate in a few weeks,"
Lawrence said. "But I'm really
happy for the team — no Stanford
team has finished higher at NCAAs
than we did this year."
After coasting through the tour
nament with rounds of 76, 77 and
77, Jose fell apart on Saturday,
hacking her way to a 12-over-par
84, which was not counted in the
Stanford's team score. Jose placed
in a tie for 77th with a total of 314.
"I'm glad I've gotten a good job,"
Jose said with a smile, when asked
about her round. Jose, who
majored in international relations,
will be an investment analyst in
San Francisco after a five-week
internship in New York this sum
mer.
"After one heck of a start, every
one kind of steadied down," Bald
win said of his team's performance
in its final round of the year. "We
were looking for a second- or third
place finish at the start of the day,
but after the second hole (which
included both a double and quadru
ple bogey) I feel fortunate that we
were able to hold onto fourth. We
had no margin of error, no cushion.
We were caught off-balance, and

then had to fight all the way in.
"But anytime you finish in the
top four of an NCAA tournament,
it's an accomplishment. And I know
we were able to contribute greatly
to that all-sports trophy (the Sears
Directors' Cup, which goes to the
school with the best season-ending
ranking in most sports) that it
appears we are going to win at
Stanford."
The Cardinal will be able to
retain the services of Baxter,
McKay and Strada for next year's
campaign. The squad will also fea
ture junior Julie Bowen, who
played in the NCAA tournament
during her sophomore year, where
she finished in a tie for 53rd.
Stanford has recruited Jill Sper
ry of Poway, Calif., to fill in the fifth
and final spot on the traveling ros
ter. Sperry has enjoyed several very
high finishes in junior competition.
"I really like Jill," Baldwin said.
"She's a real competitor. I liken
here to Andrea Baxter in that way."
Baxter and the rest of the Cardi
nal women's golf team now put
away the clubs until next year. In
reflecting on the best season in its
history, the team can take pride in
its consistency — Stanford never
finished worse than fourth.
