The Stanford women's golf team ended its
season Saturday afternoon in Wilmington,
N.C., finishing in fourth place at the NCAA
championships with a four-round total of
1,188 (36 over par).
In a year in which the Cardinal rose to its
highest-ever ranking of No. 2 in the nation, the
squad tied for a school-best NCAA finish at the
par-72, 6,061-yard Landfall-Dye Golf Course.
In 1992, the Cardinal also placed fourth at Ari
zona State's Karsten Golf Course.
The No. 1 Arizona State Sun Devils won
their third consecutive NCAA title, looking like
the team that had not lost a tournament the
entire year in cruising to a 3-over-par total of
1,155. Arizona State shot the best rounds of
the day three out of four times and expanded
its lead with each successive round played.
No. 3 San Jose State, which had played hot
potato with the Cardinal all year for the No. 2
ranking, finished in the second position with
1,181, 26 strokes behind the champion Sun
Devils. Fifth-ranked Wake Forest (1,185) fol
lowed the Spartans into third place.
Finishing behind Stanford were No. 13 Indi
ana (1,194) in fifth, No. 12 Furman (1,195) in
sixth, No. 4 UCLA (1,199) in seventh, and No.
17 North Carolina (1,203) in eighth.
Among individuals, Arizona State's Kristel
Mourgue d'Algue fired a final 2-under-par
round of 70 to win the tournament by two
strokes over San Jose State's Vibeke Stensrud
and fellow Sun Devil Wendy Ward.
Mourgue d'Algue finished with a 5-under
par 283, making a six-foot putt to clinch her
first ever NCAA title.
The Cardinal played its best golf of the tour
nament during the third round of Friday, fir
ing a 4-over-par 292 to move from a tie for
fourth place after Thursday's competition into
sole possession of third.
Sophomore Mhairi McKay led the way for
Stanford with her second consecutive 3-under
par round of 69, which catapulted her from
13th place to fifth in the individual standings.
It was the only sub-70 round of the day out of
the 102 golfers who competed at the NCAAs.
"I felt like I hit it really well today," McKay
said on Friday, after finishing with three
birdies on the final four holes. "Our aim was to
play in the final grouping in the final day, and
we achieved that goal."
"Mhairi is hitting the ball a ton right now,"
head coach Tim Baldwin said. "I think there's
only one person in the women's game who is
hitting it any further off the tee â€” and that's
