### Ben Decker Contributing writer 
The Stanford Daily has filed a lawsuit
against Stanford University, charging
that the University violated the First
Amendment and its contract with the
paper by restricting the distribution of a
Daily special edition hist summer.
"We are very concerned that the Uni
versity has opened the door to restricting
our circulation in what we believe is an
unreasonable fashion," Daily Editor in

Chief Andy Dworkin said.
The suit, filed last Friday in Santa
Clara County Superior Court, revolves
around questions of distribution rights
at the World Cup soccer tournament
held last summer in Stanford Stadium.
To accommodate the World Cup organi
zation, Stanford leased out the stadium
and all rights to advertising within it. Be
cause control was signed over to World
Cup, The Daily was not allowed to dis
tribute a special extra edition in the sta
dium.

The Daily charges that by restricting
distribution in the stadium, the Univer
sity broke the terms of its lease with the
paper and violated The Daily's First
Amendment right to distribute papers
where it wants.
The First Amendment is made applic
able to private universities through Cali
fornia's "Ijeonard Law." This law was
used by a group of Stanford students
who successfully sued to eliminate the
University's speech code last February.
"We had an agreement with the Uni

versity. . . . They didn't protect our
rights," Dworkin said. "The First
Amendment gives us the right to create a
paper and say what we want, but the
First Amendment is useless without the
ability to distribute."
The Daily's lease with the University
states that the paper is allowed "to dis
tribute its newspaper on the Stanford
campus" provided that it "does not phys
ically interfere with the free movement
