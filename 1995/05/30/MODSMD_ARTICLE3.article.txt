## 
### Ben Decker Contributing writer 
The Stanford Daily has filed a lawsuit
against Stanford University, charging
that the University violated the First
Amendment and its contract with the
paper by restricting the distribution of a
Daily special edition hist summer.
"We are very concerned that the Uni
versity has opened the door to restricting
our circulation in what we believe is an
unreasonable fashion," Daily Editor in

Chief Andy Dworkin said.
The suit, filed last Friday in Santa
Clara County Superior Court, revolves
around questions of distribution rights
at the World Cup soccer tournament
held last summer in Stanford Stadium.
To accommodate the World Cup organi
zation, Stanford leased out the stadium
and all rights to advertising within it. Be
cause control was signed over to World
Cup, The Daily was not allowed to dis
tribute a special extra edition in the sta
dium.

The Daily charges that by restricting
distribution in the stadium, the Univer
sity broke the terms of its lease with the
paper and violated The Daily's First
Amendment right to distribute papers
where it wants.
The First Amendment is made applic
able to private universities through Cali
fornia's "Ijeonard Law." This law was
used by a group of Stanford students
who successfully sued to eliminate the
University's speech code last February.
"We had an agreement with the Uni

versity. . . . They didn't protect our
rights," Dworkin said. "The First
Amendment gives us the right to create a
paper and say what we want, but the
First Amendment is useless without the
ability to distribute."
The Daily's lease with the University
states that the paper is allowed "to dis
tribute its newspaper on the Stanford
campus" provided that it "does not phys
ically interfere with the free movement
of persons or property at any
place on campus."
"The Daily has very specific
rights under its lease," according
to Stuart Clark, The Daily's
attorney. "The University
believes that it can exclude The
Daily from certain functions, but
that's an interpretation inconsis
tent with the language of the
lease."
In a June 22, 1994 letter to
The Daily, Senior University
Counsel Thomas Fenner said,
"The Daily's interpretation ... is
overbroad." Fenner wrote that
the lease "does not guarantee the
Daily the right to distribute its
publication at all times, under all
circumstances and in all places on

campus . . . nor does it constrain
the University's ability to lease or
exclusively license portions of the
campus for special events such as
the World Cup Games that serve
a broader community."
Before the lawsuit was filed,
the case was about to go to arbi
tration, Dworkin said.
Fenner said he feels that the
suit is unnecessary and that the
University has encouraged nego
tiations all along. "This is a rela
tively straightforward disagree
ment about the meaning of a
lease provision," Fenner said.
"The disagreement was the sub
ject of an arbitration process ini
tiated by The Daily. The Daily
unilaterally pulled out of the
arbitration last week to file this
lawsuit."
"It's a shame that we're wast
ing University resources on
something that could have been

taken care of in arbitration," Uni
versity General Counsel Michael
Roster said. "The Daily has for
some reason decided to forgo
arbitration and file this lawsuit."
Clark claimed that the Daily
had to sue the University in order
to address issues central to its
complaint.
Arbitration would have been
"inadequate because its focus was
too narrow. The Daily felt that
arbitration would not address the
issues of First Amendment viola
tions and breach of contract,"
Clark said.
"I think it's unfortunate that
it had to progress to this point,"
Dworkin said. "We've offered to
settle in the past, but the Univer
sity has refused.
We'd like to work this out
quickly, but we'll go to court if we
have to ensure our right to pub
lish in the future."
