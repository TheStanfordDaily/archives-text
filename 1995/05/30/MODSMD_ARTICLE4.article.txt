# Row takes top draw in house assignment
## 
### Hussein Kanji Staff writer 
Draw results are in, and the Row
is in high demand.
Men and women alike scram
bled to live on the Row this year, as
the top five choices for women and
the top four choices for men were
all houses on the Row.
Bob, Storey, Xanadu and 553
Mayfield all drew under 500 for
both men and women. Bob was the
most popular residence for both
genders.
This year's Draw operated
under changes in the numbering
system. Numbers between one and
2000 were reserved for students
with guaranteed and preferred sta
tus, 2001 to 3000 for guaranteed
and unpreferred students and 3001
to 3500 for unguaranteed students.
Draw results were posted on Satur
day rather than Sunday, as previ
ously announced.

Stern Hall, which will be remod
eled this summer under the Capital
Improvement Program, drew a lit
tle better this year than in past
housing lotteries, said Bill Georges,
manager of Housing Assignment
Services.
In Stern, Twain drew best, going
at 1166 for men and 1506 for
women. All other Stern dorms
drew higher than 1500 for men and
women. Burbank went unpre
ferred for women at 2645.
Last year's top pick for men, Chi
Theta Chi, suffered a decline in in
terest in the Draw this year with a
cut-off number of 1694.
The top choices for women, how
ever, did not change significantly.
Four of last year's top-five choices
repeated as most popular this
spring.
The lowest number drawn this
year was three. The cut-off num
bers for housing for men and
women were 2848 and 2816,
respectively.
No unguaranteed student
received housing this year, leaving
a total of 190 students unassigned.
Georges recommends that
undergraduates who were not
assigned housing stay on the wait
ing list, explaining that they will
probably receive housing.
The two recent inclusions in the
Draw, the Kappa Alpha and Beta
houses, both drew well. The Beta
house — 557 Mayfield — was the
second-highest choice for women
and went at 548 for men.
The KA house, now 664 Lomi
ta, also drew well at 1118 for men
and 765 for women. Georges said
he expected the house to draw
high because of its two-room dou

bles.
Slavianskii Dom was the only
residence to draw in the bottom
five for both men and women. It
was the least popular residence for
women, while ZAP took the dubi
ous honor on the male side.
The popularity of La Maison
Francaise increased considerably
this year. The house changed from
a focus house to an academic
theme house this year and was
thus able to fill itself with stu
dents who had priority, Georges
said.
For graduate students, Georges
said all couples without children
and students with children
received housing. Some single
graduates, however, did not
receive housing, and Georges said
they should pursue off-campus
housing.
New graduate students who
enter this fall or summer will have
a higher priority than single grad
uates, Georges said.
