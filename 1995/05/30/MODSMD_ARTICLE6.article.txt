## Judicial Affairs officer reduces hours to take national post 
### Alda Leu Contributing writer 
Stanford Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole will re
duce her working time in Judicial Affairs by 25 percent
due to a new appointment as the executive director of
the National Center for Academic Integrity.
The center — formed in 1992 with Stanford as a
founding university — focuses on issues of academic
honesty in universities and colleges across the nation.

With an increase in membership from 20 schools in
1992 to 70 in 1995, the center has gained prominence
through its four-year existence.
"Although we've done well, we felt that there was a
need for sustained leadership to improve services to
members, to do fundraising, to put the center on a
broader, more visible national landscape," Cole said.
Previously sustained solely on volunteer leadership,
the newly created role of executive
director was established as the
result of a grant from the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
Along with other center members,
Cole applied for the giant and
received $80,000 for a two-year

period.
The funds will go toward sup
porting the new position as well as
to support research, conferences, a
newsletter and committee reports,
Cole said.
Cole cited examples of the cen
ter's effectiveness in promoting
academic honesty.
"Many schools that don't have
honor codes are now considering
honor codes through communica

tion with the center," she said. She
added that the key to a successful
honor code is that it must be high
ly visible — with the students and
faculty taking an active part in
educating the student body.
Richard Yuen, the director of
the Asian-American Activities
Center and assistant dean of stu
dents, will temporarily take on
additional duties as the assistant
judicial affairs officer.
