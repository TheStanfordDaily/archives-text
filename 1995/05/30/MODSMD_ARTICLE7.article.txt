# 155 awarded URO grants for research
## Destinations: Latin America, Far East 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
Latin America and the Far East
are the destinations of choice for re
cipients of this year's Undergradu
ate Research Opportunities (URO)
major grants, which were an
nounced on Friday.
This year, 155 major grants of
up to $2,500 — the highest number
since the program began 10 years
ago — were given out to students
who have various research projects
that they will pursue through the
summer and next year.
"The fact of the matter is that
students do wonderful things,"
said Laura Selznick, URO director.
"The grants allow them to really
pursue their interests."
Selznick said that this year the
types of projects funded were very
diverse, ranging "from geology in
Mongolia to Latin American writ
ing to health issues in India."
Unlike last year, when research
in Europe was most popular,
Selznick said more grant stu
dents are heading toward Asia and
Latin America this year. "Last year
many people studied the effects of
economic integration in Europe,
but we're not seeing that this year,"
she said.
Selznick said some of the Latin
American projects will be conduct
ed by students who went on over
seas programs to Chile and other
locales. Many are now returning to
pursue projects that they were un
able to conduct while they were
there, she said.
About $7 million is available
each year for undergraduate
research funding for students in all
fields. Of the 155 major grants, 46
went to students in the humanities
and 107 went to students in natu
ral and social sciences. Forty of the
science grants are funded by the
Howard Hughes Medical Center
and are given to biology research
projects.
URO has awarded grants since
1985, when the Firestone Family
Foundation gave a $300,000 grant
to Stanford in support of under
graduate research.
In 1985, 20 major and 34 minor
grants were distributed. As new
sources of funding have emerged,
the number of grants has
increased as well.
There are now about 20 major
donors who give anywhere from
$75,000 to $1.2 million to support
undergraduate research.
"It is not a faceless donation.
Students am meet the people who
are giving them funding,"
Selznick said. URO will hold a
party for the major grant recipi
ents tomorrow and Selznick said
she expects several of the major
donors to attend.
Major grants can cover every
thing from travel and living
expenses to purchasing books and
making copies. Students receiving
major grants must pursue their
project over at least three quarters.
To apply for a major grant, stu
dents must submit a description of
their research, a letter from a fac
ulty sponsor and a copy of their
transcript. "Students need to be in
good academic standing," Selznick
said. "These are not all straight-A
students, however."
Major grants are reviewed and
discussed by faculty in the appli
cant's department. Selznick
reviews the comments and faculty
recommendations and then
decides on the merits of the pro
posal. Her decisions are then con
firmed by Assoc. Dean of Under
graduate Studies Ramon Saldi'var.
According to Selznick, the most
important thing about the grant
program is that "we are celebrat
ing students. We want the stu
dents here to know that it is not
impossible to get funding."
