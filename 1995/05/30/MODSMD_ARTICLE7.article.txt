### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
Latin America and the Far East
are the destinations of choice for re
cipients of this year's Undergradu
ate Research Opportunities (URO)
major grants, which were an
nounced on Friday.
This year, 155 major grants of
up to $2,500 — the highest number
since the program began 10 years
ago — were given out to students
who have various research projects
that they will pursue through the
summer and next year.
"The fact of the matter is that
students do wonderful things,"
said Laura Selznick, URO director.
"The grants allow them to really
pursue their interests."
Selznick said that this year the
types of projects funded were very
diverse, ranging "from geology in
Mongolia to Latin American writ
ing to health issues in India."
Unlike last year, when research
in Europe was most popular,
Selznick said more grant stu
dents are heading toward Asia and
Latin America this year. "Last year
many people studied the effects of
economic integration in Europe,
but we're not seeing that this year,"
she said.
Selznick said some of the Latin
American projects will be conduct
ed by students who went on over
seas programs to Chile and other
locales. Many are now returning to
pursue projects that they were un
able to conduct while they were
there, she said.
