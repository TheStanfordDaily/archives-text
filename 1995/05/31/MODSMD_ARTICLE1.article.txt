# On to Omaha
## Batters aim to dominate World Series 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The world of the misleading has often been
broken down into the categories of lies, damn
lies and statistics.
The Cardinal baseball team proved that yes
terday as Stanford overcame the odds to beat
top-seeded and fifth-ranked Texas Tech 6-5 in
the championship game of the Midwest I Re
gional competition.
The win sends Stanford to its first College
World Series since 1990; the eight teams in the
series begin play in the double elimination tour
nament on Saturday in Omaha, Neb., with Stan
ford facing top-ranked Cal State-Fullerton at
11:40 a.m. PDT. The game will be televised live
on CBS.
"The goal of any collegiate team is to compete
for the national championship," junior Ail-
American catcher A.J. Hinch said after the vic
tory. "We're one of the final eight squads, but
we're not just happy to be there. We still have a
big goal and we want to win the national cham
pionship."
The numbers said it shouldn't have hap
pened. Rut there were a few key elements of the
equation that all statistics and oddsmakers for
got to take into account-
Heart. Desire. Drive. Experience.
Stanford had a lot to overcome. The Cardinal
had to beat the Red Raiders twice in a row after
losing to Tech earlier in the weekend. They had
to come from behind in the final championship
game, a feat only three of Tech's 46 opponents
had accomplished during the year. And they had
to overcome the fact that no
other squad had emerged from
the loser's bracket in a regional
to advance to the series this year.
Defensively, the final champi
onship game was freshman ace
Kyle Peterson's show, as he
pitched his second complete
game of the tournament. Offen
sively the stage belonged to
senior third baseman Steve
Carver, with junior second base
man Brian Dallimore and Hinch
providing the sideshow action.
Carver went 3-for-4 with two
RBIs, one run scored and a
homer. Dallimore was 2-for-4
with one RBI and one run, and
Hinch was 2-for-5 with two runs
scored.
Tech scored that all-impor
tant first run in the opening
frame. Peterson (13-1) gave up a
single to left field to Jason Tot
man, who moved to second on a
sacrifice bunt. Peterson struck
out tournament MVP Clint
Bryant, who had a .722 tourney
batting average going into the
game, before he gave up an RBI
single to Matt Kastelic, giving
Tech a 1-0 lead.
The first run was an ominous
sign for the Cardinal. The Red
Raiders were 43-3 when scoring
first during the season and 34-2
when putting points on the board
in the first frame.
But Stanford quickly
squelched the statistical differ
ence. Carver, who had gone 0-
for-7 with four strikeouts

against the Red Raiders in the
previous two games, emerged
from his mini-slump with one
swing of the bat. The tourney's
home run leader launched his
fourth dinger of the regional, a
long ball against the scoreboard
in left center. The blast tied the
score at 1-1.
The Cardinal defense looked
ugly in the first few innings,
committing two blunders before
it had retired five Raider batters.
The usually sure-handed left
fielder Cale Carter, with a .992
fielding percentage on the sea
son, dropped a line drive to left in
the second frame to put Tech
runners at the corners with one
out. Red Raider center fielder
Dax Holmstead got down 0-2 on
the count before sending an RBI
blooper to left field.
The Raiders scored again in
the inning on their sixth hit, a
hard ground ball that dribbled
into left field and set the 3-1
Tech lead after two innings.
Stanford threatened in the top
of the fourth, putting men on
first and second with no outs.
Senior right fielder Dusty Allen
stepped to the plate after a huge
evening against Tech Monday
night, going 2-for-3 with three
runs scored in the victory. But he
hit into a line-drive double play
to end the threat and preserve
the Raiders' lead.
"The first two innings were
not pretty," Peterson said of
Tech's six hits in the opening two
frames. "The key from the third
inning on was my curve ball."
Peterson settled down after
the first two innings, retiring 10
batters in a row into the fifth
inning. He gave up two singles in

that frame and had runners at
the corners with two outs. But a
ground out kept the score at 3-1
after five innings.
"He got ahead of the hitters,
changed the speeds up and
caught us a bit off guard," Tot
man said.
Stanford took the lead in the
seventh inning with the aid of a
Raider passed ball and error.
Three straight singles by the
Cardinal set up the scoring binge
and freshman designated hitter
Jon Schaeffer crossed home first
after junior first baseman Troy
Kent lofted a single to shallow
right field. Junior second base
man Brian Dallimore scored the
tying run on a passed ball and
Kent gave Stanford the 4-3 lead
on one of three errors by third
baseman Clint Bryant.
Another defensive miscue
allowed the Red Raiders to tie
the game in their half of the sev
enth. Totman's leadoff double
opened the way for the slow
grounder that bounced under the
glove of shortstop Eric Sees and
scoring the tying run.
Hinch singled, Carver walked
and senior right fielder Dusty
Allen reached base on a bunt to
the pitcher. With the bases load
ed and one out recorded, Dal
limore stroked a single to shallow
left and drove in Hinch. But the
Cardinal could only muster one
run and left three on the bags
going into the bottom of the
eighth inning.
With the exception of a few
slips, Peterson was at par with
his second start of the tourney.
He struck out 11 Raiders and
shut down the Tech bats with
breaking stuff and fast balls on
the lower outside corner of the
plate. His performance in the
tourney earned him the MVP
award for the weekend.
"He has pitched like a junior
or senior ever since he stepped on
our campus," head coach Mark
Marquess said of his freshman
ace. "And he seems to get
stronger as he progresses in the
game."
Another Tech error got Hindi
on base with two out in the
ninth, and the Raiders paid dear
ly for the miscue. Hinch stole
second and was driven home
when Carver sent his third hit of
the game into right center field.
The lead was 6-4 for Stanford
heading into Tech's final at-bats.
The Raiders cut the lead in
half with one out in the ninth
when Totman sent a dinger over
the wall in the left fieM gap. But
the push was not engygh to keep
the Cardinal squad away from a
Wednesday flight to Omaha.
"[Stanford] played outstanding
the entire tournament," Tech
coach Larry Hays said of the Cardi
nal taking two out of three games
from the Red Raiders. "They
played us tough all three games."
The final game was not pretty
in the field for either squad, as
both teams committed three
errors during the crucial contest.
But Tech's errors proved to be
costlier than the Cardinal blun
ders.

losing to Tech earlier in the weekend. They had
to come from behind in the final championship
game, a feat only three of Tech's 46 opponents
had accomplished during the year. And they had
to overcome the fact that no
other squad had emerged from
the loser's bracket in a regional
to advance to the series this year.
Defensively, the final champi
onship game was freshman ace
Kyle Peterson's show, as he
pitched his second complete
game of the tournament. Offen
sively the stage belonged to
senior third baseman Steve
Carver, with junior second base
man Brian Dallimore and Hinch
providing the sideshow action.
Carver went 3-for-4 with two
RBIs, one run scored and a
homer. Dallimore was 2-for-4
with one RBI and one run, and
Hinch was 2-for-5 with two runs
scored.
Tech scored that all-impor
tant first run in the opening
frame. Peterson (13-1) gave up a
single to left field to Jason Tot
man, who moved to second on a
sacrifice bunt. Peterson struck
out tournament MVP Clint
Bryant, who had a .722 tourney
batting average going into the
game, before he gave up an RBI
single to Matt Kastelic, giving
Tech a 1-0 lead.
The first run was an ominous
sign for the Cardinal. The Red
Raiders were 43-3 when scoring
first during the season and 34-2
when putting points on the board
in the first frame.
But Stanford quickly
squelched the statistical differ
ence. Carver, who had gone 0-
for-7 with four strikeouts

against the Red Raiders in the
previous two games, emerged
from his mini-slump with one
swing of the bat. The tourney's
home run leader launched his
fourth dinger of the regional, a
long ball against the scoreboard
in left center. The blast tied the
score at 1-1.
The Cardinal defense looked
ugly in the first few innings,
committing two blunders before
it had retired five Raider batters.
The usually sure-handed left
fielder Cale Carter, with a .992
fielding percentage on the sea
son, dropped a line drive to left in
the second frame to put Tech
runners at the corners with one
out. Red Raider center fielder
Dax Holmstead got down 0-2 on
the count before sending an RBI
blooper to left field.
The Raiders scored again in
the inning on their sixth hit, a
hard ground ball that dribbled
into left field and set the 3-1
Tech lead after two innings.
Stanford threatened in the top
of the fourth, putting men on
first and second with no outs.
Senior right fielder Dusty Allen
stepped to the plate after a huge
evening against Tech Monday
night, going 2-for-3 with three
runs scored in the victory. But he
hit into a line-drive double play
to end the threat and preserve
the Raiders' lead.
"The first two innings were
not pretty," Peterson said of
Tech's six hits in the opening two
frames. "The key from the third
inning on was my curve ball."
Peterson settled down after
the first two innings, retiring 10
batters in a row into the fifth
inning. He gave up two singles in

that frame and had runners at
the corners with two outs. But a
ground out kept the score at 3-1
after five innings.
"He got ahead of the hitters,
changed the speeds up and
caught us a bit off guard," Tot
man said.
Stanford took the lead in the
seventh inning with the aid of a
Raider passed ball and error.
Three straight singles by the
Cardinal set up the scoring binge
and freshman designated hitter
Jon Schaeffer crossed home first
after junior first baseman Troy
Kent lofted a single to shallow
right field. Junior second base
man Brian Dallimore scored the
tying run on a passed ball and
Kent gave Stanford the 4-3 lead
on one of three errors by third
baseman Clint Bryant.
Another defensive miscue
allowed the Red Raiders to tie
the game in their half of the sev
enth. Totman's leadoff double
opened the way for the slow
grounder that bounced under the
glove of shortstop Eric Sees and
scoring the tying run.
Hinch singled, Carver walked
and senior right fielder Dusty
Allen reached base on a bunt to
the pitcher. With the bases load
ed and one out recorded, Dal
limore stroked a single to shallow
left and drove in Hinch. But the
Cardinal could only muster one
run and left three on the bags
going into the bottom of the
eighth inning.
With the exception of a few
slips, Peterson was at par with
his second start of the tourney.
He struck out 11 Raiders and
shut down the Tech bats with
breaking stuff and fast balls on
the lower outside corner of the
plate. His performance in the
tourney earned him the MVP
award for the weekend.
"He has pitched like a junior
or senior ever since he stepped on
our campus," head coach Mark
Marquess said of his freshman
ace. "And he seems to get
stronger as he progresses in the
game."
Another Tech error got Hindi
on base with two out in the
ninth, and the Raiders paid dear
ly for the miscue. Hinch stole
second and was driven home
when Carver sent his third hit of
the game into right center field.
The lead was 6-4 for Stanford
heading into Tech's final at-bats.
The Raiders cut the lead in
half with one out in the ninth
when Totman sent a dinger over
the wall in the left fieM gap. But
the push was not engygh to keep
the Cardinal squad away from a
Wednesday flight to Omaha.
"[Stanford] played outstanding
the entire tournament," Tech
coach Larry Hays said of the Cardi
nal taking two out of three games
from the Red Raiders. "They
played us tough all three games."
The final game was not pretty
in the field for either squad, as
both teams committed three
errors during the crucial contest.
But Tech's errors proved to be
costlier than the Cardinal blun
ders.
