Gann will receive today the Order of Merit, an
honor awarded by the president of Germany.
"Dr. Gann has made a strong contribution
to fostering German-American relations," Ger
man Consul General Ruprecht Henatsch said.
"The Order of Merit is a very high award which
requires outstanding service with respect to
promoting German ideals or German-Ameri
can relations."
Born in Germany in 1924, Gann escaped to
England when the Nazis came to power.
"When I left Germany in 1938, I never
anticipated I would receive an award from the
German government," Gann said. "I am

delighted."
The Order of Merit — roughly the equiva
lent of the French Legion of Honor, according
to Gann — has been conferred upon two other
members of the Stanford faculty in the past.
Both Gordon Craig, professor emeritus of his
tory, and Katerina Mommensen, a leading spe
cialist on German literature, have received the
prestigious award.
Gann co-founded the Palo Alto German
Saturday School, which according to the Ger
man Consulate has "familiarized hundreds of
Americans and second-generation German
Americans with the new postwar democratic
Germany and its cultural and academic
achievements."
In 1973, Gann taught at the Ludwig-Erhard
Foundation while conducting his own

research. Then in 1974 he was appointed con
sultant to the Historische Kommission zu
Berlin.
Gann has published several works on colo
nial and post-colonial Africa. His books "Ger
many: Key to a Continent," "The Rebirth of
the West," and"The US and the New Europe,"
have all won "high international acclaim," Ger
man officials said in a press release.
Gann was educated at Balliol College,
Oxford, where he was a Domus scholar. After
receiving a doctorate of philosophy in 1964, he
became a senior fellow at Hoover in 1966.
He is currently working on a book with
Hoover Senior Fellow Peter Duignan dealing
with the history of the "Atlantic community."
The award ceremony will be held at 4:30
p.m. in Hoover's Mark Hatfield Courtyard.
