State budget unveiled
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Handing Pete Wilson a
series of defeats, a Senate committee yesterday
approved a $58.5 billion state budget that leaves
out most of the governor's key proposals, including
a 15 percent tax cut.
The Budget and Fiscal Review Committee voted
8-1 to send the full Senate a 1995-96 spending plan
that also rejects the deep welfare cuts, college stu
dent fee increases and state-county program shuf
fling in Wilson's plan.
In addition, the Senate budget bill would elimi
nate funding for a handful of state agencies, reduce
the number of state gubernatorial appointees, slash
state travel and cut state public information officers.
The spending plan, for the fiscal year that starts
July 1, is still $500 million to $650 million out of
balance. But committee members rejected an
amendment to eliminate that red ink through

across-the-board cuts.
33 rescued in Russia
NEFTEGORSK, Sakhalin Island (AP) - Driv
en by the fear that quake victims were dying
hourly, rescue teams pressed ahead last night,
straining to reach those buried alive by Sunday's
7.5 magnitude quake. Officials fear that up to
2,000 of the town's 3,200 people are dead.
Yesterday the rescuers were rewarded with 33
people found alive in the rubble. So far, 372
injured people have been found — and 377 bodies.
Earlier yesterday, cranes and bulldozers peri
odically fell silent, allowing rescuers to hear the
moans of the injured.
The rescue work is painstaking. The concrete
slabs that made up the shoddy apartment build
ings of this remote town must be moved carefully
to avoid crushing anyone still alive underneath.
Most digging is done by hand.
