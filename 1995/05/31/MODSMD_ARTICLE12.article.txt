# US may send ground troops

WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
policy shift that might put Ameri
can troops in the line of fire, the
United States said yesterday it
would consider dispatching ground
troops to Bosnia to help redeploy —
or even rescue — outgunned and
demoralized U.N. peacekeepers.
"We've said that we will be
there, we will be there to respond,"
White House press secretary Mike
McCurry said. "We understand
what our obligations are as the
leader of the alliance and the presi
dent would be prepared to act on
that type of request."
It was unclear how much mili
tary muscle the United States was
prepared to use now, although the
White House underscored the poli
cy of both the Bush and Clinton
administrations not to deploy U.S.
combat forces for the peacekeeping

operation in Bosnia.
Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole, campaigning in New Hamp
shire for the GOP presidential
nomination, agreed that U.S.
troops could be used under limited
circumstances.
"Under certain conditions, yes,
to help rescue personnel but not to
rescue equipment," Dole said.
"Personnel is one thing, equip
ment is another."
Some 2,000 Marines, specially
trained for amphibious operations,
headed for the Adriatic Sea. The
aircraft carrier, USS Theodore
Roosevelt, carrying 50 warp lanes,
also was on station in the Adriatic.
The administration's willing
ness to dispatch troops was trig
gered by the Bosnian Serbs'
seizure of about 370 U.N. peace
keepers in retaliation for NATO air

strikes last Friday. The United
States, Britain, France, Russia and
Germany resolved to beef up the
22,000-member U.N. force in
Bosnia.
The Pentagon said the United
States would consider a request to
use American ground forces to help
redeploy the peacekeepers to make
them less vulnerable to attacks or
becoming hostages.
"We will be there to provide
assistance," McCurry said. "We
don't know what shape that assis
tance will take at this point"
because NATO military planners
are considering various strategies.
Administration officials refused
to rule out the possibility of Ameri
can forces being used in a comman
do-style raid to liberate the
hostages, although U.N. leaders
suggested that was unlikely.
