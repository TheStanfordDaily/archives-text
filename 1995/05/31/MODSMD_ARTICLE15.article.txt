THE DEPARTMENT of Span
ish and Portuguese will soon
decide the fate of Portuguese
language instruction at Stanford.
With the tragic passing of the dearly
beloved Karin Van den Dool, senior
lecturer in Portuguese, many are
concerned that her position may be
eliminated, or replaced with a part
time professor.
Having fought repeatedly against
cuts in the Portuguese budget, many
credit Van den Dool for keeping the
department alive and well. Now that
she is no longer with us, administra
tors and professors should keep her
spirit alive by maintaining a full
time Portuguese professor.
Although Portuguese classes do
not always have very high levels of
enrollment, the importance of the
program should not be underesti
mated. Portuguese is a vital part of
the education of some students
majoring in international relations,
and especially Latin American stud
ies.

If the Portuguese instructor posi
tion is eliminated or reduced to part
time, students who need Portuguese
language instruction for their stud
ies or careers may transfer to other
schools.
Brazil, the largest Portuguese
speaking country, and by far the
largest country in Latin America, is
of great strategic importance to the
Western Hemisphere, and may
become a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council in
the future. Clearly it is important for
those studying Latin America and
Brazil to receive training in Por
tuguese language.
Unless those who feel strongly
about the need to preserve Por
tuguese at Stanford contact adminis
trators to tell them their feelings,
however, the program may well fall
victim to budget cuts.
If the University does not rehire a
full-time Portuguese instructor, the
quality of a Stanford education will
suffer.
