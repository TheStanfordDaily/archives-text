# University cleaning
## 
### 
AS STANFORD prepares for
to embark on the latest
round of housing renova
tions this summer, students
should be aware of a significant
policy switch that could drastically
affect their board bills next year.
Last November, the University
implemented a new policy that
requires all housing that has
undergone renovation under the
Capital Improvement Plan be
switched to University cleaning.
Currently, so called self-operated
houses — the target of the change
— are responsible for their own
cleaning, which gives residents the
option of cleaning their house
themselves to keep room bills low,
or hiring outside cleaners.
Under the new policy, however,
residents of self-ops will likely
have to pay more: Any house cur
rently classified as such that is
renovated will be forced to take on
University-sponsored cleaning in
the future — and pay the high

costs that come with it.
The reason for the University's
position seem to make sense: After
investing hundreds of thousands
of dollars for renovations, Stan
ford wants to protect its invest
ment. However, what would be
lost if this change is carried
through cannot be measured in
dollars.
Giving residents the responsi
bility to take care of their houses
does a lot to encourage community
spirit and offers students a true
alternative to dorm life. By enforc
ing this rule, Stanford seems to be
moving down a path toward uni
form housing; that would be a
mistake.
Stanford's housing options
make the University unique —
and should be preserved. Adminis
trators deserve praise for exempt
ing co-ops from the policy.
Self-ops are communities too,
and should not be denied the
chance to foster that spirit.
