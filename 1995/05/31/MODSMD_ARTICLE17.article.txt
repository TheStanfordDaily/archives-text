Dunn was more than a 6 grad student found dead in EV'

PATRICK THOMAS DUNN was a
brilliant human being; yet The
Daily seemed to notice neither
fact. It shocked me to hear that my
friend took his own life, and while this
past week was very difficult for his
friends and family, the nature of The
Stanford Daily's front page headline on
May 24 lent no sympathy. I find it sad
that The Daily should allow such blunt
treatment of a story that without ques
tion deserved a bit of heart. The sensa
tionalist title and dispassionate article
illegitimized the person, ignoring him,
and chose to focus instead upon the
death rather than the loss of life. While
in writing this difference may seem
alight, in the realm of human affairs it
is indeed those slight deferences to tact
that differentiate the brute from the
refined. Simply said, The Daily should
be ashamed. It has shown with this
article that new stories to be reported

each day are, as the very name of the
paper suggests, treated as nothing more
than quotidian; the treatment of this
tragedy reads like a commonplace
occurrence, impersonal and sterile,
matter-of-fact.
The Daily might easily have set the
title to be, "Stunned friends and class
mates wonder why," sub-titled with, "a
friend takes his own life." The chosen
headline — "Chem grad student found
dead in EV: 26-year-old committed sui
cide with cyanide" — made it unneces
sary to read the article; it provided
nothing more in the way of informa
tion. This headline is an insult both to
those who knew Pat and to the Stan
ford community in general. It is a head
line befitting USA Today, which claims
readership of those with the smallest
attention span and least interest in the
humanity of human affairs; USA Today
serves its purpose by simply providing

the facts. And The Daily has demon
strated that it does the same. Any real
journalist would know that a headline
is supposed to be compelling in a man
ner such that the reader will want to
read the remainder of the article. This
headline is the article and leaves noth
ing to be told (by this journalist any
way). In short, The Daily needs a heart,
because news is not, and cannot be a
cold, impersonal tidbit of ephemeral
occurrence.
Who was Patrick Thomas Dunn, you
ask? To his peers he was a brilliant
chemist who was inspiringly creative.
In the students he tutored and TA'd he
sparked curiosity and appreciation of
organic chemistry's elegance. Respected
by all his professors, he worked dili
gently in his first year at Stanford pur
suing his doctoral degree. Complement
ing his intellectual passion, Pat was a
determined athlete. As a member of the

Stanford racquetball team, he earned
the title of Ail-American when he and
his doubles partner placed third in the
nation. From the perspective of all of
his friends, Pat strove for health in
mind and body. Which leaves us to ask
why such a man would bring his life to
an end?
I will wonder for a long time why
this happened. I'll ask myself if there
was anything I could have done, any
signs I could have read. Pat kept his
discontent well to himself. His sorrow
went unseen by those who cared for
him. Perhaps in time, I will rest my
sadness knowing he is at peace. I will go
to his memorial service and send my
thoughts to his parents. I will miss you
Pat and I am proud to have known the
"Chem grad student, [who was] found
dead in EV."
