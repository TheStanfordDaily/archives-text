# Students who choose Harvard are missing out on weather, fun
## 
### 
As an incoming freshman I read
with interest the finding that six out
of seven students admitted to both
Harvard and Stanford chose Harvard.
As a student who was admitted to both
universities I have a unique perspec
tive on the matter. I visited both Har
vard and Stanford during their week
ends for admitted students. Having
visited both and seen the people at
each school I can say that Stanford not
getting those students who chose to go
to Harvard is not a great loss.
The ones who chose Harvard over
Stanford are the ones who you don't
want to live with — the ones who you
dread getting as dormmates since they
just don't know how to have fun. If

they chose to go to Harvard then fine.
I just hope that they have fun spend
ing the next four years in the cold of
Boston without any semblance of a
social life.
