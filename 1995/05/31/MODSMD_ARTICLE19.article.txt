# 'Reaffirming affirmative action' was important to remind people of issue
## 
### 
I am writing to thank the organiz
ers of Thursday's "Reaffirm affirma
tive action" rally. I felt that it was an
extremely important step in defending
what I consider to be an important
part of the United States. I also think
it is important to remind people that
this issue affects all of us, not just peo
ple of color. I was accepted to all the
schools I applied to; I chose Stanford

based on one criterion: its diversity. I
looked at the statistics in my college
guide, I visited and saw the mix of peo
ple in the dorm I stayed in, I took a
tour and saw ethnic centers, an inter
national center, theme dorms. I am
white and I chose Stanford because 1
wanted a multicultural environment.
When I talk about Stanford, I tell
people that I have learned far more
outside of class than in. I talk about
tutoring at El Centro Chicano, about
hosting at the International Center,
about running programs for Japanese
students, about speaking Spanish with
my Mexican-American friends, going
to services with my Jewish friends and
making dumplings with my friend who
is Korean-American.
Above all, I talk about how much I
have learned just by living together
with people who are different than I
am: people who have different back
grounds, different experiences, and

different interests. Being able to work
with and discuss what I am learning
with people who see the world differ
ently has been an extremely important
part of my intellectual development.
This is what makes Stanford such an
exciting place to be and what I miss
more than anything when I go home to
Idaho.
What I want to emphasize here is
that just as we must strive to include
everyone in our schools and our work
places, our fight for affirmative action
must also include everyone. As a white
person I feel I have benefited greatly
from the results of affirmative action,
and many of my white male friends
say the same thing. Affirmative action
is not just an issue for women and peo
ple of color, it is an essential part of
everyone's education.
