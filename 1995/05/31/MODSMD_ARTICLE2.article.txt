Shelby Steele — a sometimes controversial African-
American professor, award-winning author and polit
ical scientist who is said to have begun the national de
bate on the value of affirmative action — has been ap
pointed a research fellow at the Hoover Institution.
"We are pleased to have Shelby Steele join us," said
Hoover Director John Raisian in a statement. "We
look forward to his participation at the institution. He
brings his impressive scholarship and insightful per
spective to the public policy debates on social issues."
Raisian was out of town yesterday and unavailable for
further comments.
Steele will be at Hoover for the next five years work
ing part-time. His affiliation with the institution
means he can share ideas with colleagues and have a
forum for commentaries, speeches and public policy
initiatives, Raisian said.
Steele, currently on leave of absence from his posi
tion as English professor at San Jose State University,
is a contributingeditor for Harper's Magazine. He won
an Emmy in 1991 for his work as a writer and corre
spondent on the PBS documentary "Seven Days in

Bensonhurst."
He is most widely known for his book, "The Con
tent of Our Character: A New Vision of Race in Amer
ica," which won the 1990 National Book Critic's Circle
Award.
He has written widely about race in American soci
ety and about the varying results of social programs,
such as affirmative action, on race relations. In"The
Content of Our Character," Steele strongly criticizes
affirmative action, stating that it is a liberal creation
that has encouraged blacks to think of themselves as
victims.
Steele's second book, "The End of Oppression,"
scheduled for publication early next year, explores the
" ironies of recent social history with respect to the civil
rights movement, the launching of the Great Society
and affirmative action," Raisian said.
While most seem very enthused about Steele's ap
pointment as a research fellow, some voices on cam
pus are more skeptical. Political Science Prof. John
Manley said Steele is indeed "one of the country's
most visible black conservatives" but added that stu
dents in his seminar were "underwhelmed" by
Steele's book.
