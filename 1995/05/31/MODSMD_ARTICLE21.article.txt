## Looking forward to being 35 
### 
Yesterday was my birthday.
Don't worry, I'm still accepting
presents from anyone who may not
have had time to bring them over to me
yet. Unlike almost every other birthday
in the past, however, I wasn't looking for
ward to this one.
You see, when I was young, birthdays
had so much meaning. Obviously, the
day I was born meant a lot to my moth
er. It was probably a pretty exciting
experience for me as well, although I
must admit I remember very little of it.
Every year after that date my family
and friends got together to celebrate it
with me. Lots of presents, cake, ice
cream, and trips to Chuck E. Cheese
with the little girls in my class (no boys,
they were still yucky). On my birthday, I
was so special that I even got to grab as
many game tokens as I could from the
hat of Chuck E. Cheese himself! That
was a definite status symbol for a third
grader.
The fun and games may have
decreased somewhat as I moved into
junior high and high school, but the
magic of the day still remained. Every
birthday meant that I was getting older,
more mature. Someday I might even be
an adult. I was leaving the old world
behind. No more parents, no more rules,
no more pesky laws saying when I could
drive, vote, or drink. I'd be my own
woman, free to go where and when the
winds took me.
So why, as my 22nd birthday came

and went, did those great feelings sud
denly disappear? Hey, I've attained that
goal I was striving for all of those years.
How could I possibly be dissatisfied?
The reason came to me several weeks
ago, as I realized that my birthday was
approaching: 22, and every age after it, is
basically a meaningless number. Until
the ultimate peak of the 21st birthday,
almost every new age means something.
When I turned five, I was ready for
kindergarten. When I turned 10, I was a
double-digit. For some reason, I was very
enthralled by that idea at the time. At 13,
I was a teenager. I was now leaving those
childhood years behind and becoming a
young woman, or so I thought. At 15, I
was allowed to get my learner's permit
and enroll in driver's education. That
culminated in probably the second most
important birthday I had, my 16th birth
day. I even remember my first indepen
dent drive with my new license (I drove a
whole mile to the video store).
Sometimes it was a real stretch to
decide what each birthday meant. When I
turned 19, the only thing I could think of
was that I could legally drink in Canada.
Of course, I never made it to Canada that
year but hey, that's better than nothing.
So I finally turned 21 one year ago. I
could drink legally (in America, that is)
and I could even tell my parents about it.
Several friends took me out to a bar in
Palo Alto and got me drunk. My journey
to adulthood was complete. I could do
almost anything I wanted and not get in

trouble for it.
But now I'm 22. I can still do all of the
things I was allowed to do one year ago,
and I can still tell my parents about it.
What a change of pace. Oh well. I guess
being 22 is better than being 32. My dad
even told me it was all downhill from
here.
But wait! All is not lost. After basical
ly telling my German teacher the same
thing I just wrote here, she gave me a ray
of hope, something to look forward to as
I get older. At 22, I'm still not allowed to
officially run for president of the United
States! That's right, that golden age of 35
is still 13 years away. The anticipation
will mount as each birthday approaches.
I'd better start preparing myself for the
big day. Fund-raising, making connec
tions, maybe a couple terms in Congress
pandering to the NRA and the tobacco
lobby, will all be necessary for a success
ful run for president. I've got a lot to do.
Maybe birthdays aren't so depressing
after all.
Don't worry, I'll remember all of the
little people when I'm 35, dodging bullets
and crazed intruders in the comfort of
my own Oval Office.

The Amanda Breen for President Com
mittee will happily accept cash contribu
tions beginning immediately.
