## Out of Africa Stanford researcher's genetic tests show we all came from the same place 
### Jing-Chyi Chao Contributing writer 
We may all be African in origin. More data derived
from various methods of genetic testing have accumu
lated to support the "out of Africa" theory, which
claims that all human populations originated in
Africa.
The laboratory of Luca Cavalli-Sforza, professor
emeritus of genetics at the School of Medicine, recent
ly derived a new estimate for the time when non-
Africans first separated from Africans â€” 155,000
years ago. David Goldstein, formerly a doctoral candi
date at Stanford and now at Pennsylvania State Uni
versity, and Marc Feldman, professor of biology, were
the principal investigators.
This estimate was derived from a new method of
genetic dating involving microsatellites in nuclear
I)NA.
DNA, the building block of life, consists of a thread
like, double strand of repeating series of four
nucleotide bases, adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine
(C) and guanine (G). A combination of three of these
bases comprises a codon, one or several of which may
correspond to a certain amino acid. A protein consists
of multiple amino acids. Strands of DNA, wrapped
around a base structure, comprise a chromosome.
Genes are segments of DNA responsible for coding
for a specific protein and thus determine such bodily
traits as hair or eye color or susceptibility to certain
diseases. Human beings have an estimated 100,000
genes distributed across 46 chromosomes.
To derive his time estimate, Cavalli-Sforza used
certain naturally-existing genes called microsatellites
as markers. "A marker is anything that shows a dif
ference between individuals in a population," Cavalli-
Sforza said. Microsatellites are comprised of sequen
tial repetitions of one to six nucleotides. For example,
Cavalli-Sforza used CA repeats, which would exist as
CACACA in a string of three.
Mutations occur in microsatellites during the dupli
cation of DNA and alter the number of repeats, which
may vary anywhere from two to several hundred,
decreasing or increasing the string by one. Different
individuals therefore have variations in the number of
these repeats, even among their own chromosomes
through paternal and maternal donation, and the rate
at which these mutations occur may be used to deter
mine the genetic distance among various populations.
Older populations possess more mutations and thus
more variation in the pattern of these repeats.
"If we know the mutation rate per generation, we
can calculate the time of separation by estimating the
difference between the average number of repeats [ofl
the two populations," Cavalli-Sforza said.
The estimate of 155,000 years was derived from an
equation relating the number of repeats to the muta
tion rate and time. As with previous studies involving
other genetic markers, native Africans possessed the
most variation in their microsatellite DNA, suggesting
again that they are members of the oldest population.
The 30 different microsatellites used in the study
were derived from chromosomes 13 and 15. The DNA
was extracted from blood samples of members of 14
different populations, including 30 Africans from
three different ethnic groups and 120 native individu
als from America, Australia, Europe and East Asia.
"Ideally, we don't [sample] populations that have
recently been mixed" such as Americans of European
descent, Cavalli-Sforza said.
This estimate corresponds closely to the estimate of
143,000 years derived from a recent study of mito
chondrial DNA (mtDNA) by geneticists at the Nation
al Institute of Genetics in Japan. Mitochondria are cel
lular organelles which provide the energy needed for
the cell to function and unlike other organelles, mito
chondria self-reproduce and possess their own DNA.
Lines of mtDNA are only passed down maternally.
Compared to microsatellites, mtDNA mutates at a
slower rate and time estimates are derived through an
indirect method of inferring human separation time
from the estimated 13-million-year human-ape diver
gence time, decreasing the accuracy of calculations.
However, the Japanese geneticists sequenced all

16,000 bases in the mtDNA genome of three humans
and four apes, statistically increasing the precision of
the estimate.
Another method of analysis involves restriction
fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Polymor
phisms are different variations of a gene within a pop
ulation. These sequences are compared within differ
ent populations. An estimate of 140,000 to 280,000
years was approximated by researchers at UC-Berke
ley in 1987. However, because the RFLPs were again
derived from mtDNA, the estimate is less accurate
than that obtained from microsatellite DNA analysis.
"In the case of restriction fragment-length polymor
phisms, we don't know the mutation rate except very
roughly," said Cavalli-Sforza.
The correlation among all estimates strengthens
the "out of Africa" theory. Cavalli-Sforza said, "It's
very important to find an agreement between entirely
different approaches."
The "out of Africa" theory has been in competition
with the multiregional hypothesis. Both theories
observe that the first human species, Homo habilis,
arose in Africa approximately 2 iri million years ago.
However, the multiregional hypothesis states that
the descendants of habilis spread throughout the
continents, with each population evolving separately
and later interbreeding to form Homo sapiens, while
the "out of Africa" theory claims that the descen
dants of habilis gradually became extinct, being
replaced by a population which formed in Africa.
These African descendants then evolved into modern
Homo sapiens.
No genetic data currently exists to support the mul
tiregional hypothesis, which is championed by anthro
pologists who base their conclusions on the examina
tion of relatively few human skull fossils, Cavalli-
Sforza said. "There are many anthropologists who
look at the data and they don't find the similarity at
all," he added.
In his past research, Cavalli-Sforza has found that
genetic similarities also parallel linguistic patterns.
For this reason, populations are separated on the basis
of language in his analyses.
Scientists have determined that "races" do not exist
as such and race is considered more of a label of con
venience than any determinant of extreme genetic dif
ferences. For example, Cavalli-Sforza and other

geneticists have determined that some genetic differ
ences do exist among humans, but these are small in
number compared to overall variation among the
human species. In other words, some individuals of
different races are more genetically similar than those
of the same race and similar traits exist across all pop
ulations while few are concentrated within one popu
lation.
Cavalli-Sforza's study will benefit humans in terms
of providing a means by which we may learn more
about our past.
"It is making it much more clear what our history
is," Cavalli-Sforza said. "We are not only doing things
more precisely... using markers that were not known
before, but we are also confirming older findings."
Cavalli-Sforza is also one of the founders of the
Human Genome Diversity Project, which, according to
a release prepared by the project's North American
Committee, is "an effort by anthropologists, geneti
cists, doctors, linguists and other scholars from
around the world to document the genetic variation of
the human species worldwide." It is entirely separate
from the Human Genome Project, which serves to doc
ument the genetic make-up of the human species by
analyzing the DNA of a relatively few individuals.
The diversity project is designed to probe the ori
gins of the human species in an effort to determine the
biological relationships between various populations.
Information obtained from this study will further
knowledge as well as provide insight into certain
genetic diseases.
Formally organized in 1993, project committees
also exist in Europe, Eastern and Southeast Asia,
India, Central and South America and Africa. Lan
guage will be used to distinguish the estimated 4,000
to 8,000 populations from one another. Blood, hair or
cheek cell samples will be collected from individuals
from at least 500 of these populations before 1998.
The results of the research around the world will be
organized into a computerized database, providing
quick access to information worldwide.
As of 1995, sample collection has begun in Europe
and will soon commence in Asia and Africa. Mean
while, the project has been hampered in North Ameri
ca because of lack of funding. Some Native Americans
have also expressed concerns arising from their histo
ry of mistreatment.
