# Bug on burst beer and ice that floats

A: Aah, summer is here, and
that means warm beer, one
of the least pleasant concoc
tions known to man.
To avoid this horrendous fate,
clever beer drinkers often put
that can of Bud in the freezer,
only to reopen the door later and
find a fridge full of yellow slush
and aluminum shrapnel. The rea
son this happens has to do with
changes in the water in the beer
as it moves from a liquid to a

solid.
Many people know the old rule that objects expand when heated
and contract when cooled. In the case of water, however, when it
cools so much that it freezes, a special change happens and the water
actually expands.
In its liquid form, the little molecules of water roam freely, slip
ping and sliding past one another in a sort of atomic lambada. When
water is cooled to the freezing point, however, the molecules actual
ly align to form a much more rigid, regular structure. This structure
takes up more space — more like an atomic arm's-length box-step.
This expansion of freezing water explains the explosion. The beer
is tightly enclosed in the can anyway, so when it gets too cold the
expansion of the freezing water presses on the can and — with
enough cooling — boom! A beer bomb is born.
Water expansion can be seen in many other places too. It explains,
for example, why ice forms on top of lakes in the winter instead of
sinking to the bottom. The more rigidly structured ice is less dense,
so it stays up above. The same principle can be seen when you float
ice cubes in a drink, like a glass of vodka.
