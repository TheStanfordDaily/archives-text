# Marrow donors hard to find
## Tough typing 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
Stanford students have mobilized recently to find a
bone marrow donor for sophomore Evan Chen, who suf
fers from leukemia.
Still, finding the right donor will not be easy.
Though over 3,000 people of all races need bone mar
row transplants each year, it is difficult to find matching
donors for minorities, especially African Americans and
Asian Americans.
Diseases including leukemia and other cancers can
destroy bone marrow, which is needed to produce white
blood cells which keep people healthy. Without these
immune system cells people are prone to infection.
Assistant Medicine Prof. Wendy Hu discussed the eth
nic aspect of transplant medicine in a presentation to stu
dents at the Stanford School of Medicine a few weeks ago.
In order for a transplant to be successful it is cur
rently necessary to find a perfect match between donor
marrow types, Hu said.
A perfect match means that six proteins called
Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLAs) which are found on
the white blood cells in the marrow are the same for both
donor and receiver. If the HLAs differ, the marrow will
probably be rejected by the receiver's body.
Even with a six-for-six match, about 80 percent of all
transplant recipients have a negative reaction to the
donor marrow called graft-host disease.
Studies show that finding a match between marrow
types is most likely between persons of the same racial
group, partially because HLAs are genetically deter
mined. Since most prospective donors are Caucasian, this
immediately presents a problem for minorities in need of
transplants.
Since Chicanos and Latinos and Native Americans are
genetically similar to the Caucasian population, they
have a larger probability of a match with a Caucasian
donor. But African Americans and Asian Americans do
not share this genetic similarity.
Even within the African-American and Asian-Ameri
can populations, it is difficult to find a match. Compara
tively, Caucasians have a 77 percent chance of finding a
match within their group, while Asian Americans have a
32 percent probability and African Americans only a 19
percent probability.
The reason for this is high genetic diversity within
these two racial groups, called polymorphism. Genetic
polymorphism causes these groups to have a wide variety
of HLA types, which makes it difficult to find a matching
donor.
Hu referred to several methods which are being used
to combat this problem. The first is a series of donor
recruitment programs on both national and local levels to
recruit Asian-American and African-American donors.
Having more people in the donor pool makes finding a
match more likely.
Becoming a prospective donor involves donating a
blood sample which is tested for HLA types. This infor
mation is stored in a computer until a patient in need of
a transplant is matched to the donor, who is informed of
the match and asked to decide whether they will donate
or not.
If the potential donor agrees, about 5 percent of the
donor's total bone marrow is removed from the pelvic
bone during the operation. It takes approximately a week
for the marrow to replenish itself.
A second method to increase transplant availability to
minorities is to improve transplant techniques so that a
five-out-of-six protein match will be accepted by the
recipient's body. This makes the likelihood of a match
much greater.
However, Hu said she feels that minorities also face
difficulties which have nothing to do with finding a donor
when in need of a marrow transplant.
Limited access to facilities capable of diagnosing the
need for a transplant and lack of immediate and aggres
sive treatment prevent many people from getting the aid
they need.
For this reason, public awareness is also a large part of
marrow donor campaigns. Hu said she hopes that grow
ing presence of donor programs will lead to a greater
focus in minority communities on marrow donation and
transplant.
