# Searching for a theory to explain it all

How does everything work?
To some extent, we can explain how stars
form, why steel rusts and what causes dis
eases. Through science, we can look at a
group of closely related phenomena and
extract patterns. Perhaps we notice that
falling objects always descend at a roughly
equal acceleration, or that people usually
don't get chicken pox twice, or even that
grape juice somehow develops into wine. An
aim of science is to explain and unify, to pull
together separate occurrences and classify
them under some general rule. Most sciences
focus on limited types of observations,
unwilling to draw outside certain lines.
But at places like the Santa Fe Institute,
some scientists are attempting to unify a far
broader set of phenomena. Not content to
restrict their sights to specific fields such as
biology and physics, these researchers clump
together structures as diverse as economics,
ecology and neuroscience into one general
paradigm: complex adaptive systems (CAS).
From studying everything, they believe, they
can explain everything.
Perhaps you have heard of the grand uni
fied theory, a Holy Grail among physicists
who would like nothing more than to con
dense all of their theories into one; or chaos
theory, a mathematical construction which
purported to encompass diverse structures
from weather systems to the stock market.
In many ways, complexity theory (the study
of CAS) is a descendant of these ambitions, a
"theory of everything."
You may wonder what sorts of common
patterns one could discern in subjects as dis
tinct as neuropsychology and the avalanches
of a sand pile. The answer is, no one's sure
yet.
"We are trying to understand complex
phenomena in terms of simple principles,"

says Roger N. Shepard, a Stanford psycholo
gist who deals with complexity and universal
laws of the mind. Shepard, who spent last
year at the Santa Fe Institute, is enthusias
tic about this approach to science; to him,
the "problems we're dealing with [in science]
are problems of complex systems."
In a way, complexity is a very intuitive
perception of the world. It makes sense that
some psychological facts are derivable from
certain theories in biology, just as it makes
sense that much of biology is dependent on
chemistry, much of chemistry on physics
and much of physics on mathematics. This
view is known as reductionism; it is a basic
premise for much of complexity, which
attempts to find the common patterns that
underlie all sorts of systems. If the systems
are all ultimately governed by mathematics
and whatever other fields they share, surely
those universal laws are reflected in the
behavior of the systems.
Much of complexity theory is highly math
ematical and a great number of ideas have
been borrowed from physics. This is hardly a
coincidence; many of the originators of the
field are physicists by trade. One of the most
famous complexity scientists and a founder
of the Santa Fe Institute is Nobel Laureate
Murray Gell-Mann, a physicist turned
philosopher. In a recent book appropriately
titled "The Quark and the Jaguar," Gell-
Mann (who discovered the quark) proposed a
conceptual foundation for complex adaptive
systems: quantum mechanics. Gell-Mann
argued that the indeterminacy of quantum
mechanics allows the universe to generate
conditions conducive to complex phenomena.
An abstruse account, certainly, but one
which is potentially very powerful in scope.
Yet complexity theory has been attacked
from various sides for perceived faults in its
methods and goals. A recent article in Scien
tific American referred to the "problems"
complexity theory had endured in trying to

create a general theory of complex systems,
citing the less-than-expected results of arti
ficial life and cellular automata and the diffi
culty in formulating a precise definition of
complexity. The article further compared
complexity to other general mathematical
theories, including cybernetics, catastrophe
theory, information theory and chaos,
explaining how all four have failed.
Shepard is critical of such criticisms, urg
ing that "it's too early to expect too much."
Though he admits that the SFI has made no
earth-shattering discoveries, he remains
adamant that important practical findings
have been made. For example, one group at
the SFI working on AIDS has found "evi
dence of how one can decrease transmission
from an infected mother to the offspring."
And various subfields of complexity theo
ry do have other successes. Artificial intelli
gence has found uses in fields from expert
systems to video games. Artificial life, a
younger branch of complexity, has served to
increase our understanding of evolution,
biology and even political science through
models of life and natural selection. It has
also found a number of applications, espe
cially in parametrical optimization (a
method of finding the best solution to a
given problem).
Shepard said he retains a great deal of
faith in complexity theory and thinks that
we should "expand these efforts." Stressing
the significance of basic research, he
described his experience working for the Bell
Laboratories.
"Small research groups were always
working on different things. Most were
unproductive; if you expected too much from
one group, you'd get nothing. But one came
up with the transistor, which totally trans
formed the world," said Shepard, consider
ing the probabilistic nature of research. "I
think that's what we've got to do with
respect to complexity."
