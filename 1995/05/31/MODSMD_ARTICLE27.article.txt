## Can they defend their crown? Seniors, Tiger are underdogs 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
It's almost a common occurrence
here on the Farm. Just another Stan
ford team vying for a national title.
The No. 2 men's golfers try to suc
cessfully defend their crown and put
themselves among the other Cardinal
national champions this year at the
NCAA Championships beginning today
in Columbus, Ohio. A win by the squad
will give Stanford its sixth national title

this year, breaking its own record of five,
set in 1991-92.
"We been trying not to think ahead to
Columbus," said head coach Wally
Goodwin, "but obviously, it weighs in
the back of our minds. There's so much
pressure in defending a title.
"Now it's all come down to four
days."
Clearly, Stanford has the talent to
accomplish such a feat. With three
returning Ail-Americans and all-world
freshman Tiger Woods, the squad for

the most part, has taken collegiate golf
by storm. Ten of its 14 finishes thus far
have been in the top three, with six team
titles. Senior All-American Notah Begay
and Woods both made the All-District
team, with Woods garnering top fresh
man honors as well.
Senior All-Americans Casey Martin
and William Yanagisawa have looked
strong as of late as well. After rough
stretches for both, Martin won the indi
vidual title at the U.S. Intercollegiate
and Yanagisawa showed his mettle, fin
ishing in the top six at Pac-lOs and lead
ing the team there. Recent addition
senior Jerry Chang has contributed as
well lately, finishing second on the team
at Pac-lOs. Chang took slumping senior
All-American Steve Burdick's spot on
the squad in a 54-hole qualifier last
week.
"This team, when we're on, has the
talent to beat anyone," Goodwin said.
"Everyone has to play well — we don't
have one guy carrying us, but when it all
comes together. ..."
As talented as the team is, however,
Stanford faces numerous obstacles.
First and foremost is the field. Leading
the four-round charge will be top
ranked Oklahoma State. The Cowboys
feature a solid group all-around, with all
five of its members making the Midwest
All-District honors squad.
No. 6 Arizona State looks to challenge
as well, coming in as perhaps the hottest
team in the country. The Sun Devils
slaughtered the fields at both the Pacif
ic 10 Championships and at the Western
Regionals. Both teams have shown the
ability to beat Stanford, providing the
Cardinal with as much as it could handle
this season.
"Boy there are so many good teams
and players here," Martin said. "There's
just a ton of competitive squads.
"It's going to be a close tournament.
No one is going to run away with it."
The course will give all the golfers
quite a headache as well. The site of
eight previous national championships,
it features lightning-fast greens and
four-inch high roughs.
"These are the deepest roughs I've
ever seen," Goodwin said. "And with the
putting surfaces as quick as they are, it's
going to be a real struggle to keep the
ball out of the thick grass.
"It's going to come down to our driv
ing and short game. If we don't drive
straight, we'll be out pretty fast."
The course looks to play fairly long as
well. In addition, recent rain has cut
down on the roll that the players can
expect to get out of their shots. It places
the teams in the agonizing dilemma of
needing to hit long, but with control.
The Cardinal clearly has the power to
hit long. Woods won the distance compe
tition earlier on Monday, pounding the
ball 295 yards on one drive.
"It'll be tough, but I guess it plays to
our advantage some," Martin said. "We
can hold our own when it comes to dis-

tance.
Finally, the press has also
been a distraction for the squad.
With the eyes of the world anx
iously watching for the next
Jack Nicklaus to emerge in
Woods, reporters, photographers
and cameramen have been out in
force hoping to catch greatness

in the making.
"It's great to have a player of
his ability on this team," Good
win said, "but there's a down
side to it. The attention has
reached a point where it's dis
ruptive. We just have to block it
out and get on with our busi
ness."
Despite a whirlwind of out
side challenges, the deciding fac
tor in Goodwin's mind, is the
team's performance the first
round. The tournament will be

played in such a format that only
the top 15 teams will advance
past the second round.
"Clearly, our first objective is
to get out of the blocks fast,"
Goodwin said. "There's no play
ing catch-up in this one — if you
fall back, you're out."
And if the team opens hot?
"We'll be in good position,"
Goodwin said. "If we start well
and don't get carried away by
the hoopla, we have as good a
chance as anyone."
