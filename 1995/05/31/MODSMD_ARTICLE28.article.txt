# Counting on six titles
## Selfish editor hopes to share in others' glory 
### 
Six national titles. I admit
that one of the reasons I
accepted this job at The
Daily was the prospect of editing
the night that record-setting tro
phy rested in Cardinal hands. But
a funny thing has happened along
the way â€” it might not make its
way into Arrillaga.

At the start of the year, when I
had no idea I would be doing this,
I fielded lots of questions about
how many Stanford teams were
capable of winning national titles.
I ran out of fingers trying to add
them. It seemed such a sure bet
that Stanford would eclipse its
own 1991-92 record (a mark
shared by UCLA in 1981-82) of
five NCAA titles that some of us
optimistic folks took the task of
winning such a crown for grant
ed.
We forgot that there's a big dif
ference between how many teams
have a chance to win a champi
onship and how many champi
onships Stanford teams have a
chance to win. There's no such
thing as a shoo-in for a national
title and no way that every team
with a shot at a title will wear the
rings.
Sure, water polo, women's vol
leyball, women's swimming and

diving and men's tennis were just
about everybody's pick, and they
brought home the prize. But
without the support of men's
gymnastics, a team that brought
a No. 14 ranking into the NCAA
tournament but ran away with
the rings, Stanford would enter
the month of June needing one
more title just to tie the magic
standard.
Several squads were near the
top of the "experts' " polls and
enjoyed stellar regular seasons
before coming up just short in the
NCAA tournament. Women's soc
cer, a squad whose goal was to
end North Carolina's eight-year
reign, never got the chance after a
triple-overtime goal by Portland
ended a stellar campaign in the
round of eight.
Water polo and women's vol
leyball both converted and Stan
ford was sitting a tidy 2-for-3
after the fall. With women's bas
ketball, both tennises and both
swimmings to go before the end
of April, the record seemed as
precarious as a one-run lead
with Mitch Williams on the
mound.
But Geno Auriemma was able
to put out the fire, with a trio of
All-Americans that denied Tara
VanDerveer's squad a shot at
their third title of the '90s in a
national semifinal in Minneapo
lis.
The women's hoops setback
(as if a trip to the Final Four is a
setback) came on the heels of
men's swimming's heartbreaking
loss to up-and-coming Michigan
in the NCAAs. After a three-year
