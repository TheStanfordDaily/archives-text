# Counting on six titles
## Selfish editor hopes to share in others' glory 
### 
Six national titles. I admit
that one of the reasons I
accepted this job at The
Daily was the prospect of editing
the night that record-setting tro
phy rested in Cardinal hands. But
a funny thing has happened along
the way — it might not make its
way into Arrillaga.

At the start of the year, when I
had no idea I would be doing this,
I fielded lots of questions about
how many Stanford teams were
capable of winning national titles.
I ran out of fingers trying to add
them. It seemed such a sure bet
that Stanford would eclipse its
own 1991-92 record (a mark
shared by UCLA in 1981-82) of
five NCAA titles that some of us
optimistic folks took the task of
winning such a crown for grant
ed.
We forgot that there's a big dif
ference between how many teams
have a chance to win a champi
onship and how many champi
onships Stanford teams have a
chance to win. There's no such
thing as a shoo-in for a national
title and no way that every team
with a shot at a title will wear the
rings.
Sure, water polo, women's vol
leyball, women's swimming and

diving and men's tennis were just
about everybody's pick, and they
brought home the prize. But
without the support of men's
gymnastics, a team that brought
a No. 14 ranking into the NCAA
tournament but ran away with
the rings, Stanford would enter
the month of June needing one
more title just to tie the magic
standard.
Several squads were near the
top of the "experts' " polls and
enjoyed stellar regular seasons
before coming up just short in the
NCAA tournament. Women's soc
cer, a squad whose goal was to
end North Carolina's eight-year
reign, never got the chance after a
triple-overtime goal by Portland
ended a stellar campaign in the
round of eight.
Water polo and women's vol
leyball both converted and Stan
ford was sitting a tidy 2-for-3
after the fall. With women's bas
ketball, both tennises and both
swimmings to go before the end
of April, the record seemed as
precarious as a one-run lead
with Mitch Williams on the
mound.
But Geno Auriemma was able
to put out the fire, with a trio of
All-Americans that denied Tara
VanDerveer's squad a shot at
their third title of the '90s in a
national semifinal in Minneapo
lis.
The women's hoops setback
(as if a trip to the Final Four is a
setback) came on the heels of
men's swimming's heartbreaking
loss to up-and-coming Michigan
in the NCAAs. After a three-year


Rock
Solid
Jeremy
Stone
stint at the top of the men's swim
ming world, Stanford tumbled all
the way down to second. This was
a title a lot of us put in the bag in
September, even though Michi
gan was No. 1 in the land.
Another squad whose name we
etched on the trophy was the
women's swimming crew. As
expected, Richard Quick's squad
battled its way to a perfect regular
campaign. But Michigan held a
21-point lead on the final day of
the NCAAs, seeking to end the
women's four-year string of per
fection. Rather than fold under
pressure, the divers and 400-
meter free relay squads chalked
up Stanford title number three.
Now the situation was bleaker.
Baseball, the preseason No. 1, had
plummeted in the rankings, and
men's golf had unbelievably fallen
from the top spot. The surprise
title came from Sadao Hamada
and a determined group of men's
gymnasts.
"Rankings mean nothing" had
been Hamada's creed all year, but
nobody really gave the Cardinal a
serious shot besides, well, the

Cardinal. Hut before a stunned
crowd in Columbus, Ohio, Stan
ford earned title No. 4 from an
unexpected source.
Mid-May was the next target
date for the record, and tennis
was the talk of the Stanford sport
ing scene. The men were perfect
and hoping to stay that way for
the first time in 17 years, and the
women were young and hoping to
pull an upset from their bag of
tricks. The women reached the
Final Four after a scintillating
duel with UCI*A but succumbed
to Texas, while the men crushed
their opposition and tied the
mark — on my night off. In fact, I
had yet to be at The Daily the day
of a national title.
Now time is running out.
Women's golf, a team that had
climbed to second in the country,
enjoyed a fine NCAA tournament
last weekend but couldn't hang
with invincible Arizona State.
That leaves baseball and men's
golf.
Two days ago baseball faced
the unenviable task of needing to
win three straight and two
against Texas Tech to keep their
hopes alive. Now that they have
advanced to Omaha for the first
time in five seasons, Mark Mar
quess and company will be the

prohibitive underdog, the bottom
seed in the field of eight.
Besides, a College World Series
title would come three days after
the final Daily of the year. I won't
be around for the record — at
least not as editor, anyway.
That means it's all down to
men's golf. After winning the title
last year, returning four senior
Ail-Americans and adding Tiger
Woods, I can think of nobody who
thought Wally Goodwin's top
five's fingers hadn't been mea
sured. But Woods has been ailing,
and Steve Burdick, who grew up
15 minutes away from me down I
-80, has been replaced by senior
Jerry Chang. Now the men are no
longer favored as the No. 2 squad
in the country.
My editing partner in crime
has retired for the year, so with
out a doubt, I'd be the man on the
job for my last day when the title
comes. The four seniors would
like to go out winners in their
final chance. And so would I —
even if I have done nothing to
deserve it.

Jeremy hopes Seth Goldstein,
his editing comrade, is enjoying
the trek across the United States
— even though he wants the
fridge back.
