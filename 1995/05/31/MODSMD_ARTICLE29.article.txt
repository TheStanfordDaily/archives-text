# Track volunteers to sparkle at NCAAs

After a disappointing finish at the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships,
where the men finished seventh and the
women sixth, the Stanford track team
sends a small, elite group to the NCAA
Championships in Knoxville, Tenn.
From the hammer throw today until the
running finals on Saturday, June 3, the
Tennessee Volunteers will host the event
that will decide the All-American status
of the nation's best track and field ath
letes.
Stanford has 13 athletes with NCAA
qualifying or NCAA provisional qualify
ing marks. Of those almost all are either
throwers or distance runners, represent
ing the contributions of those two areas
all year.
The last time a Stanford man won an
individual NCAA event was 1978, when
James Lofton won the long jump. Jackie
Edwards and Chryste Gaines, now a Car
dinal assistant coach, were the last
women to win NCAA events in 1992.
Edwards won the long jump and Gaines
won the 100 meter.
Stanford strength in national events

traditionally comes in the team-oriented
cross-country championships. In the
track and field season, the Cardinal has
needed to satisfy itself with several
standout performances and a select
group of All-American marks. In 1992
the women's team finished second at the
NCAA Indoors behind the standout
Edwards and Gaines.
The Pac-10 is the nation's top track
and field conference with such power
houses as UCLA and Oregon, who
claimed the No. 1 and 2 spots at the con
ference championships this year.
The leading athlete for the Cardinal is
senior co-captain Dave Popejoy, the
school record holder in the hammer
throw. Popejoy will again compete
against UCLA's junior Balazs Kiss, the
collegiate record holder and the 1994
hammer throw champion.
Several weeks ago, assistant coach
Robert Weir predicted that Popejoy
would contest for second to sixth after
Kiss. At last year's championships, Pope
joy threw the hammer 227 feet, 8 inches
for a sixth-place finish. His 231-1 throw
against California was the third-best
