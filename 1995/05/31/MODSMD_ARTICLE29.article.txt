# Track volunteers to sparkle at NCAAs
## 
### Matthew Lawrence Staff writer 
After a disappointing finish at the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships,
where the men finished seventh and the
women sixth, the Stanford track team
sends a small, elite group to the NCAA
Championships in Knoxville, Tenn.
From the hammer throw today until the
running finals on Saturday, June 3, the
Tennessee Volunteers will host the event
that will decide the All-American status
of the nation's best track and field ath
letes.
Stanford has 13 athletes with NCAA
qualifying or NCAA provisional qualify
ing marks. Of those almost all are either
throwers or distance runners, represent
ing the contributions of those two areas
all year.
The last time a Stanford man won an
individual NCAA event was 1978, when
James Lofton won the long jump. Jackie
Edwards and Chryste Gaines, now a Car
dinal assistant coach, were the last
women to win NCAA events in 1992.
Edwards won the long jump and Gaines
won the 100 meter.
Stanford strength in national events

traditionally comes in the team-oriented
cross-country championships. In the
track and field season, the Cardinal has
needed to satisfy itself with several
standout performances and a select
group of All-American marks. In 1992
the women's team finished second at the
NCAA Indoors behind the standout
Edwards and Gaines.
The Pac-10 is the nation's top track
and field conference with such power
houses as UCLA and Oregon, who
claimed the No. 1 and 2 spots at the con
ference championships this year.
The leading athlete for the Cardinal is
senior co-captain Dave Popejoy, the
school record holder in the hammer
throw. Popejoy will again compete
against UCLA's junior Balazs Kiss, the
collegiate record holder and the 1994
hammer throw champion.
Several weeks ago, assistant coach
Robert Weir predicted that Popejoy
would contest for second to sixth after
Kiss. At last year's championships, Pope
joy threw the hammer 227 feet, 8 inches
for a sixth-place finish. His 231-1 throw
against California was the third-best
throw in the United States in
1995.
Freshman Sami Jo Small will
compete in the javelin tomorrow.
Her throw of 175-11 in Fresno at
this year's first meet qualified
her for national competition.
Unfortunately, in the last three
months Small has failed to come
close to that throw. At this year's
Pac-lOs, Small finished third
with a throw of 156-0, almost 20
feet off her season best. Small
came to Stanford as the 1993 and
1994 Canadian Junior National
champion in javelin. If Small can
find that early form in Knoxville
today, she should be able to score
points for the Cardinal.
In team competition, Arkansas
looks like the favorite for the
men's team title and Louisiana
State for the women's honors.
Arkansas far outdistanced the
competition in Boise last year and
should continue again this year.
UCLA will most likely be one of
the closest challengers from the
Pac-10.
LSU will again draw off of its
impressive sprinting core, but if
UCLA can recreate the enthusi
asm it showed at the NCAA
Indoors in Indianapolis only a
few months ago, it could be a
close contest on both sides for
UCLA to take the national title
outright.
Stanford's points at the
national meet will come from the
throwing events, a familiar
source of strength for this year's
team. The outstanding distance
runners may break through and
surprise their national competi
tion, but overall Stanford will
need to satisfy itself with a few
impressive individual efforts
instead of an assault at the
national title.
