## Survivors, friends remember, regroup 
### Heather Knight Staff writer 
Students called for education
and unity at a "speak-out" yes
terday, kicking off Stanford's
Rape Awareness Week. The
theme for this year's event is
"Ribbons of Remembrance,
Songs of Strength."
Members of the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault, which
organized the week's events,
gathered in White Plaza at noon
for the opening ceremonies. The
group's members stressed the
importance of rape awareness, as
rape occurs everywhere, includ
ing Stanford.
"Sexual assault is a big prob
lem on every college campus
across the nation," said freshman
Mary Kathryn Harcombe, a coali
tion member. "It's thought of as
a private issue, but for us to im
prove the situation we've got to

have everyone aware of it."
Harcombe said men need to be
made aware of how rape physical
ly and emotionally hurts women
and women need to be made
aware of the likelihood of assault.
She said the importance of the
opening ceremony was simply to
"get people to listen."
A central part of the speak-out
was the remembrance wreath on
display in White Plaza. Students
are invited to tie purple ribbons
on the wire wreath in remem
brance of friends or loved ones
who have been sexually assault
ed.
"The wreath is living proof of
how much rape does happen,"
Harcombe said.
Harcombe began the ceremony
by reading a poem describing the
long-lasting impact of rape.
"There's no difference between
being raped and going head first
through a windshield, except
[with rape] you're afraid of half
the population," she said.
Senior Angel Foster, a coali
tion member, spoke about a high
school friend who was raped and
killed. Foster said that her mem
ories of the incident are just as
painful today as they were when
it happened. She added that this

incident sparked her to become
involved in rape awareness edu
cation.
Senior Jeff Cory, a member of
the coalition, read statistics
from a 1988 sexual assault sur
vey at Stanford. According to
the survey, 29 percent of under
graduate women and 37 percent
of graduate women said they
had been raped, with more than
half of the incidents occurring at
Stanford.
Ten percent of undergraduate
men and 16 percent of graduate
men said they had been raped,
with a third of the incidents
occurring at Stanford.
Cory said that though these
statistics are a few years old, the
numbers unfortunately have not
changed very much.
"This is not something we
need to get defensive about or be
accusatory, but we need to edu
cate ourselves," said Cory.
An interactive workshop on
the current state of sexual
assault on campus was also
scheduled for last night in Kim
ball Lounge, but was canceled
due to a lack of student atten
dance.
A bullhorn will be sounded
every six minutes tomorrow in
White Plaza, signifying how fre
quently a women is raped in the
United States. A self-defense
workshop for women is also
scheduled for tomorrow evening.
