# Ultimate cannot regret
## Allyson's swan song praises Ultimate's sporting spirit and love of the game 
### 
No regrets. The saying runs particu
larly near and dear to my heart
these days as my senior year
approaches its finale. With June just
around the corner, I'm coming to terms
with that blasted R-word — the one that
sours life a little for those of us who make
mistakes. Whatever decisions I flubbed,
wrong turns I took or airballs I shot are all
part of the game. I'll never be perfect;
what's most important is to learn and play
fair.

Now a personal credo for me, these are
the words that the Stanford Ultimate
teams adopted as their motto this year —
words to live and breathe by. "No regrets"
is on their shirts, on their minds and in
their hearts. I think it's a wise reflection
that preaches the dignity of all athletics
and indeed all of life. The mantra also

reveals the strong and spirited backbone
which characterizes the best-kept secret in
sports.
I've played frisbee before. I can toss
that plastic humdinger over the river and
through the woods (maybe make that into
the river), but I never pictured it much
beyond sandy beaches and grassy fields.
Little did I know that those unassuming
discs can soar, slice and shimmy through
the air — depending, of course, on the slull
of the people who are giving it a whirl.
And when it comes to skill, it seems
that Team Bloodthirsty and Superfly (the
men's and women's teams, in their respec
tive aliases) have no shortage. Both teams
made the Farm proud last weekend at the
national championships in Champaign-
Urbana, 111., handling miserable weather
and tight competition with grace. The
women, in their first-ever appearance at
Nationals, crushed everyone in their
muddy wake en route to a heartbreaking
but inspiring loss to UC-Santa Cruz in the
finals. The men fought their way in mirac
ulous fashion to the semifinals, where
they gave defending-champion East Car
olina a run for their cash before succumb
ing.
Grandmas and parents say it all the
