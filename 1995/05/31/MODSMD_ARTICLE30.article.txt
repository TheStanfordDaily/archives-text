# Ultimate cannot regret
## Allyson's swan song praises Ultimate's sporting spirit and love of the game 
### 
No regrets. The saying runs particu
larly near and dear to my heart
these days as my senior year
approaches its finale. With June just
around the corner, I'm coming to terms
with that blasted R-word — the one that
sours life a little for those of us who make
mistakes. Whatever decisions I flubbed,
wrong turns I took or airballs I shot are all
part of the game. I'll never be perfect;
what's most important is to learn and play
fair.

Now a personal credo for me, these are
the words that the Stanford Ultimate
teams adopted as their motto this year —
words to live and breathe by. "No regrets"
is on their shirts, on their minds and in
their hearts. I think it's a wise reflection
that preaches the dignity of all athletics
and indeed all of life. The mantra also

reveals the strong and spirited backbone
which characterizes the best-kept secret in
sports.
I've played frisbee before. I can toss
that plastic humdinger over the river and
through the woods (maybe make that into
the river), but I never pictured it much
beyond sandy beaches and grassy fields.
Little did I know that those unassuming
discs can soar, slice and shimmy through
the air — depending, of course, on the slull
of the people who are giving it a whirl.
And when it comes to skill, it seems
that Team Bloodthirsty and Superfly (the
men's and women's teams, in their respec
tive aliases) have no shortage. Both teams
made the Farm proud last weekend at the
national championships in Champaign-
Urbana, 111., handling miserable weather
and tight competition with grace. The
women, in their first-ever appearance at
Nationals, crushed everyone in their
muddy wake en route to a heartbreaking
but inspiring loss to UC-Santa Cruz in the
finals. The men fought their way in mirac
ulous fashion to the semifinals, where
they gave defending-champion East Car
olina a run for their cash before succumb
ing.
Grandmas and parents say it all the


Allyson
Mizoguchi
time — it's not if you win or lose,
but how you play the game. I
think Ultimate players must have
first coined the phrase.
What awes me most about this
sport is something that can't be
touched, but only witnessed as an
outsider — the spirit. Besides
having skill, these athletes have a
devotion and respect for the sport
that runs deep. Perhaps this is
best exemplified in the tradition
of calling one's own fouls, even at
the national level.
There are no refs here. There
are no coaches. There are only
players against players, all of
whom would rather hang up their
cleats than sacrifice the integrity
of the game. It takes a lot of char
acter to admit you've fouled the
other, especially when tension is
high. It takes a love for the game,
and an even bigger love for the
opponent.
Sportsmanship. What a for
eign concept in so many events. I
think of basketball, where I'll try
to draw the foul, try to pretend I
didn't travel, allow some unbi
ased third party to hold the reins
of the game. Or baseball, where
an ump determines whether the
pitch is a strike or not — when
the pitcher knows perfectly well
what it was. In Ultimate, the only
rule is to preserve the sportsman
ship.
In what other sport will teams
make up rhyming cheers for the
opponents after the matches?

Where most everyone on the team
began without having a clue as to
how to throw the disc? Where
teams help other colleges start up
their own programs? Somehow I
just can't picture our football
team singing the homemade
Sting spinoff "Fields of Mud" for
the Bears after Big Game, or our
basketball teams trading strategy
pointers with the enemy. Just
doesn't, wouldn't, couldn't hap
pen.
My last plug for Ultimate has
to do with orange shirts. In
response to last year's question
able, unsportsmanlike conduct by
the East Carolina team, the Car
dinal came up with a way to deal
with a possible repeat. Rather
than storm off the field in protest
if an opponent made an unfair
call, the team chose to don T
shirts which blare in spray paint,
"A Promise, The Gift." Rear
ranged, the letters spell "Spirit of
the Game." I believe this gesture
alone says enough.
Too often athletes lose the idea
of fairness amid the squalor of
competition. After all, the point is
to win, isn't it? Well, yes. But
watching a sport like Ultimate
makes me look at that question
again. Perhaps it's not just noble,
but logical, to admire one's oppo
nent. Perhaps it's both right and
reasonable to expect everyone to
follow the rides. And maybe it
makes sense to love the sport
enough to preserve its spirit. Only
then can there really be no
regrets.

My only regret, Az, is that Singa
pore is so darn far away!
