# Athletes of the Week

Andrea Baxter
For the second time in three weeks sophomore Andrea Baxter
has earned Athlete of the Week honors. Baxter finished fifth at
last weekend's NCAA Championships, firing a 1-over-par 289 to
lead the Cardinal to a fourth-place finish as a squad. Baxter's indi
vidual fifth-place showing was the second-best in Stanford histo
ry, and she was named an honorable mention Ail-American.

Brian Dallimore
Junior second baseman Brian Dallimore was just one of five All-
Midwest Regional selections in Wichita, Kan. The three-year starter
shined in the infield and also with the bat, producing several key hits
as Stanford staved off elimination three consecutive times to advance
to the College World Series. Dallimore's RBI single in the eighth
inning yesterday against Texas Tech put Stanford ahead to stay.
