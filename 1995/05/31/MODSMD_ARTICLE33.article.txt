# Kenyon says students' success rewards deans
## 
### Anne Dubinsky Contributing writer 
Charles Kenyon met with mem
bers of the Stanford community
yesterday as the search for the new
dean of students continued.
Kenyon is assistant vice presi
dent for student affairs at the
State University of New York Col
lege at Buffalo, advising on all
matters involving the school's
11,600 students, in addition to
coordinating budget and personnel
matters.
The most pleasurable aspect of
that job, Kenyon said, is working
with students and staff. He said
that he mostly interacts with stu
dents who have obtained McNair
Scholarships, which are designed
to offer assistance to students who
would not otherwise consider
graduate school as an option.
"It's the success [of students]
that gives me the satisfaction at
the end of the day,"he said. "I
value the contribution that I can
make."
Kenyon said an ideal relation
ship between himself and the stu
dent body would need to come
"over time with lots of contact and
dialogue." He said he wants stu
dents to believe he is "fair and rea
sonable and respectful of their
interests."
To gain this relationship, Keny
on said he would "have people over
for dinner or to my house in infor
mal gatherings."

In addition, Kenyon said he
would interact with students in
more formal ways, such as attend
ing the meetings of student groups
or inviting members of groups to
meet with his staff.
Commenting on his views of
what multiculturalism should
involve, Kenyon said he believes
that Stanford has great potential
to become an environment where
all people can learn about and
respect other cultures and values.
"This campus has a great
opportunity, as diverse as it is, to
foster a climate where differences
are respected and communication
(between different groups) is held
as a ct)re value," he said. "We need
to have more bridges so as not to
isolate and segregate [groupsl."
Kenyon attended Bates College
in Maine for two years and then
dropped out to go abroad and
study at Sweden's University of
Stockholm. He then dropped out
of that university to tour Europe.
Kenyon finished his undergrad
uate degree in education at the
University of Massachusetts at
Amherst and received his master's
and doctorate in education from
Harvard University.
Another finalist has been added
to the original four candidates for
the dean of students position. Bar
bara J. Gossett, director of Leader
ship Programs at the University of
Missouri-Columbia, will meet with
members of the Stanford commu
nity next Wednesday.
