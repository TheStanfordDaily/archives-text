# Rating the food service smorgasbord
## Although students complain, administrators say they can't get enough direct input

Chili Frito casserole, beef j
stroganoff, chicken enchiladas
and the same salad bar, night
after night after night: For
years, residential food service
has been the source of student
complaints.
I n a Daily poll conducted last

week, students gave Dining Services a C+
with an overall grade point average of 2.40.
Jokes about food quality regularly make good
dinnertime conversation, as does the occa
sional rumor about Grade D meat or spoiled
milk.
But are students' barks worse than their
bites?
Despite the grumbling, students rarely

voice their concerns to University officials.
Housing and Dining services surveys usually
solicit a low level of response from students
and dorm food service representatives only
occasionally attend scheduled meetings.
Recently, Dining Services and the ASSU
have attempted to address the admitted lack
of communication between the University

and students on the issue of
food service.
Last quarter, these efforts
resulted in the formation of
the Working Group, a 10-
person committee made up
of students, Council of Presi
dents members and Dining

Services managers who were called together
to review, update and validate major policies
and procedures within Dining Services.
Satisfying appetites
In a poll conducted last week by The Daily,
students were asked, among other things, to

give Dining Services a letter grade
from A to F.
Out of 369 students surveyed,
216 elected to give Dining Services
a grade. Out of that number, only
14 gave Dining Services an A.
Ninety-nine students gave it a B
and 65 gave it a C. Only four stu
dents rated Dining Services with
an F — culminating in an overall
grade of C+.
The negative ratings are com
pounded by persistent rumors
about food service. One urban leg
end, for example, is that Dining
Services uses Grade D meat.
According to Housing and Din
ing Director Keith Guy, this rumor
is unfounded.
"There is no such thing as
Grade D meat," Guy said. "We only
buy Grade A meat.... It may not
be prime, but it is top choice. We
would never expect to buy any
thing less than what am be found
at a supermarket or elsewhere."
With regard to student com
plaints, Dining Services Manager
Shirley Everett said it is hard to
satisfy the palettes of all students.
"Students basically compare us
to their parents' cooking," she said.
"We have a lot of different tastes to
satisfy. Some say we serve too
many vegetarian plates while oth
ers say we don't serve enough."
According to freshman Thomas
Hitter, who served as a dorm food
service representative in Florence
Moore Hall during winter quarter,
students will always be prone to
complaining about the food.

He added that what students
don't often realize is how flexible
Dining Services can be with its
menus. "Most people don't realize
what can and cannot be done at
this level," Ritter said.
Flo Mo "has a menu committee
which decides on the entrees and
we can make suggestions to the
committee," he added.
A recipe for improvement
Despite the perennial com
plaints about its food, Dining Ser
vices has had to work hard to get
student input.
"We like to have as much stu
dent involvement as possible,"
Everett said.
The Working Group has been
meeting every other week since its
members were set. The group con
sists of Everett, four students, COP
members Mork Murdock and Ani
etie Ekanem, Operations Manager
for Human Resources Melanie
Jones-Carter, Operations Manager
for Finance Craig Mitchell and Res
idential Education Office Manager
Beeson.
"We have laid the foundation
for the issues we want to discuss,"
Murdock said. He added that the
desire for increased communica
tion between students and Dining
Services was mutual.
"We were hoping to get some
response," Murdock said. Dining
Services "contacted us and wanted
to meet with us. . . . They wanted
to get more students involved."
It has oflen been difficult to get
official student input on Dining
Services' operations. Housing and
Dining Services distributes a sur
vey every quarter, but Everett said
that she is generally "not satisfied

with the amount of surveys we get
back."
As a result, Everett said Dining
Services is "working on the kind of
communication we do with stu
dents. ... We want to see how to
distribute material that students
will read."
With the formation of the
Working Group, "students begin to
feel more comfortable because of

their involvement
in the decision
making process,"
she added.
The latest
Housing and Din
ing Services sur
vey distributed
earlier this month
included ques
tions suggested by

the Student Advisory Committee
— a larger student committee set
up in January to advise Dining Ser
vices on such issues as meal plans,
policies and communication.
The questions suggested by the
student committee focused on stu
dent satisfaction with current meal
plans and attempted to gauge opin
ions about alternative meal plan
options.
A la what?
According to Murdock, the
Working Group has made meal
plan flexibility its top priority. "We
want to have serious discussions
about how meals and points am be
more flexible," he said.
Specifically, the group is looking
into the question of how to let stu
dents use their meal cards in any
dorm. Currently, those charged a
certain number of points per item
purchased can eat at dorms which

have the "a la board plan," a com
bination of meals and points used
at residences such as Wilbur and
Flo Mo. Those on a traditional
board plan of meals only, however,
are unable to use their meal cards
at a dorm which runs only on
points.
Everett said Dining Services is
open to suggestions on enhancing
student meal plans. The Working
Group "is working on how to give
students the greatest flexibility ...
lbut| we need student input," she
said.
Before the latest survey was
released, it was unclear whether
students felt that meal plan flexi
bility would affect their residential
life, Murdock said.
He added that while the figures
from the latest Housing and Din
ing services survey have not yet
been finalized, preliminary results
confirmed the notion that students
want more flexibility in their meal
plan options.
"We've discussed the possibility
of having more compatibility
between meals and points," Mur
dock said. "We're looking into the
possibility of making dining facili
ties more uniform with the mixed
system" of meals and points.
Murdock added that it was also
clear that a greater number of stu
dents had responded to the survey
than in previous quarters.
"We made suggestions for solic
iting a higher response," Murdock
said, including "having managers
personally hand out surveys . ..
and giving incentives to students
to return the surveys." This quar
ter, these incentives included free
Tootsie Roll lollipops with every
returned survey.

don't often realize is how flexible
Dining Services can be with its
menus. "Most people don't realize
what can and cannot be done at
this level," Ritter said.
Flo Mo "has a menu committee
which decides on the entrees and
we can make suggestions to the
committee," he added.
A recipe for improvement
Despite the perennial com
plaints about its food, Dining Ser
vices has had to work hard to get
student input.
"We like to have as much stu
dent involvement as possible,"
Everett said.
The Working Group has been
meeting every other week since its
members were set. The group con
sists of Everett, four students, COP
members Mork Murdock and Ani
etie Ekanem, Operations Manager
for Human Resources Melanie
Jones-Carter, Operations Manager
for Finance Craig Mitchell and Res
idential Education Office Manager
Beeson.
"We have laid the foundation
for the issues we want to discuss,"
Murdock said. He added that the
desire for increased communica
tion between students and Dining
Services was mutual.
"We were hoping to get some
response," Murdock said. Dining
Services "contacted us and wanted
to meet with us. . . . They wanted
to get more students involved."
It has oflen been difficult to get
official student input on Dining
Services' operations. Housing and
Dining Services distributes a sur
vey every quarter, but Everett said
that she is generally "not satisfied

with the amount of surveys we get
back."
As a result, Everett said Dining
Services is "working on the kind of
communication we do with stu
dents. ... We want to see how to
distribute material that students
will read."
With the formation of the
Working Group, "students begin to
feel more comfortable because of

their involvement
in the decision
making process,"
she added.
The latest
Housing and Din
ing Services sur
vey distributed
earlier this month
included ques
tions suggested by

the Student Advisory Committee
— a larger student committee set
up in January to advise Dining Ser
vices on such issues as meal plans,
policies and communication.
The questions suggested by the
student committee focused on stu
dent satisfaction with current meal
plans and attempted to gauge opin
ions about alternative meal plan
options.
A la what?
According to Murdock, the
Working Group has made meal
plan flexibility its top priority. "We
want to have serious discussions
about how meals and points am be
more flexible," he said.
Specifically, the group is looking
into the question of how to let stu
dents use their meal cards in any
dorm. Currently, those charged a
certain number of points per item
purchased can eat at dorms which

have the "a la board plan," a com
bination of meals and points used
at residences such as Wilbur and
Flo Mo. Those on a traditional
board plan of meals only, however,
are unable to use their meal cards
at a dorm which runs only on
points.
Everett said Dining Services is
open to suggestions on enhancing
student meal plans. The Working
Group "is working on how to give
students the greatest flexibility ...
lbut| we need student input," she
said.
Before the latest survey was
released, it was unclear whether
students felt that meal plan flexi
bility would affect their residential
life, Murdock said.
He added that while the figures
from the latest Housing and Din
ing services survey have not yet
been finalized, preliminary results
confirmed the notion that students
want more flexibility in their meal
plan options.
"We've discussed the possibility
of having more compatibility
between meals and points," Mur
dock said. "We're looking into the
possibility of making dining facili
ties more uniform with the mixed
system" of meals and points.
Murdock added that it was also
clear that a greater number of stu
dents had responded to the survey
than in previous quarters.
"We made suggestions for solic
iting a higher response," Murdock
said, including "having managers
personally hand out surveys . ..
and giving incentives to students
to return the surveys." This quar
ter, these incentives included free
Tootsie Roll lollipops with every
returned survey.
