After repeated delays, universal ID
cards will finally arrive at Stanford in
time for the start of next school year.
The new pieces of plastic will be used
for a plethora of purposes, combining
the functions of the existing dining and
ID cards and adding an on-campus debit
card option, as well as a tie-in with Wells
Fargo Bank.
"I think it's a really exciting project,"
said Bursar Jonathan Erickson. "For
years, students have been complaining
about a piece of paper representing 20-
plus thousand a year."

"The old paper cards will be gone,"
said Registrar Roger Printup. "You will
keep this card the whole time you're at
Stanford."
The new card will have many roles be
yond merely serving as identification,
according to Assoc. Registrar Jack Far
rell, the project manager.
The cards "will be used for Food Ser
vice. There's a place for an on-campus
debit account. We have been working
with Wells Fargo Bank to have this card
act as an ATM card," he said.
The cards will also be used for library
access and circulation and for access to
athletic facilities, Farrell said.
The debit card feature, tentatively

called the Stanford Card Account, will
allow students to make an advance pay
ment to the University then have money
automatically deducted from this de
posit when using their card at several
campus locations, said Erickson.
While the money will not be available
for withdrawal, it will roll over from
quarter to quarter. "It'll go until you are
no longer involved with the University
... at which time it will be refunded,"
Erickson said.
The account could be used at on-cam
pus retail locations such as the Book
store, ASSU business operations and the
restaurants in Tresidder Union. The
Stanford Card Account program would

subsume the Tresidder Dollars pro
gram, said Erickson.
"The Stanford Card Accounts will be
only for on-campus functionality. We
have no intention of linking this to any
off-campus resources," Erickson said.
Both Printup and Erickson expressed
an interest in enabling the Stanford
Card Account to be used at more loca
tions. Eventually washers, dryers and
vending machines on campus might ac
cept the card, they said.
The contractors who provide the
laundry and vending machines "have
been informed that's what we want to
