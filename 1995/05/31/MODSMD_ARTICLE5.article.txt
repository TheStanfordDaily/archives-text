# Universal IDs debut with next school year
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
After repeated delays, universal ID
cards will finally arrive at Stanford in
time for the start of next school year.
The new pieces of plastic will be used
for a plethora of purposes, combining
the functions of the existing dining and
ID cards and adding an on-campus debit
card option, as well as a tie-in with Wells
Fargo Bank.
"I think it's a really exciting project,"
said Bursar Jonathan Erickson. "For
years, students have been complaining
about a piece of paper representing 20-
plus thousand a year."

"The old paper cards will be gone,"
said Registrar Roger Printup. "You will
keep this card the whole time you're at
Stanford."
The new card will have many roles be
yond merely serving as identification,
according to Assoc. Registrar Jack Far
rell, the project manager.
The cards "will be used for Food Ser
vice. There's a place for an on-campus
debit account. We have been working
with Wells Fargo Bank to have this card
act as an ATM card," he said.
The cards will also be used for library
access and circulation and for access to
athletic facilities, Farrell said.
The debit card feature, tentatively

called the Stanford Card Account, will
allow students to make an advance pay
ment to the University then have money
automatically deducted from this de
posit when using their card at several
campus locations, said Erickson.
While the money will not be available
for withdrawal, it will roll over from
quarter to quarter. "It'll go until you are
no longer involved with the University
... at which time it will be refunded,"
Erickson said.
The account could be used at on-cam
pus retail locations such as the Book
store, ASSU business operations and the
restaurants in Tresidder Union. The
Stanford Card Account program would

subsume the Tresidder Dollars pro
gram, said Erickson.
"The Stanford Card Accounts will be
only for on-campus functionality. We
have no intention of linking this to any
off-campus resources," Erickson said.
Both Printup and Erickson expressed
an interest in enabling the Stanford
Card Account to be used at more loca
tions. Eventually washers, dryers and
vending machines on campus might ac
cept the card, they said.
The contractors who provide the
laundry and vending machines "have
been informed that's what we want to
do," said Printup. "They've been
very supportive."
While cashless laundry will not
be available immediately, "we're
committed to having the Tresidder
program up as soon as the card is
up," said Erickson.
The University has also entered
into an arrangement with Wells
Fargo Bank to allow the ID card to
work as an ATM card and to pro
vide reduced-cost banking for stu
dents.
Administrators were careful to
clarify that the University was not
forcing Wells Fargo banking upon
the Stanford community. "The
Wells Fargo affiliation is strictly an
option," said Farrell.

"We are not prescribing what
students or parents should be
doing in terms of banking," added
Printup.
The Wells Fargo cards will look
just like the regular card on the
front while the back will look like a
Wells Fargo ATM card, said Elsa
Shafer, a Wells Fargo vice presi
dent.
According to Shafer, the Wells
Fargo option will give the cardhold
er the advantage of having "one
card instead of two. You also get a
free checking account."
While the checking account will
have the same restrictions as Wells
Fargo's existing student checking
account, it will not have a monthly
fee, she said.
Unlike with a regular ATM
card, the bank will not charge a fee
for use of the ID card at a retail
location, Shafer said. Thus, stu-

dents am use the card
at off-campus stores
such as Safeway with
out paying the service
fee usually charged.
Those with Wells
Fargo accounts will be
able to pay their Uni
versity bills from a
touch-tone phone or
an ATM, Shafer said.
This includes items
ranging from tuition
bills to phone bills.
Faculty and staff
will also be eligible for
the Wells Fargo ID
cards, provided that
they elect to have their

paychecks deposited electronically,
an option the University provides
already, Shafer said.
Students, faculty and staff
should start receiving the first of

these new cards in a few months.
However, since the new cards
include photographs, they will not
be mailed to students in advance,
as has been done in the past.
"Our plan right now is to begin

The new universal
student identifica
tion card should
debut on campus
in time for the
1995-96 academic
year.

(distributing the IDs) as early as
sometime in August," said Print
up. At that time, faculty and staff,
as well as summer students and
graduate students who live on cam
pus all year, will be photographed.

"In early September, we hope to
start the students who arrive early
for one reason or another" such as
resident assistants and athletes,
Printup said.
When the main rush of students
hits in late September, Printup
plans to have as many as 16 or 18
stations where students can have
their new cards made.
Because the cards are perma
nent, such a large-scale effort will
never again be necessary. "In
future years, we'll only have to do
new students," Printup said.
The bank will be helping with
the physical creation of the new ID
cards. "Wells Fargo is providing us
with some assistance in getting
through this mass production the
first time around," said Printup.
"We don't want to have to buy the
equipment to produce 25,000 cards
one time."
