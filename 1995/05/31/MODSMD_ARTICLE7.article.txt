# ASSU approves Directory plan
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
In what ASSU Financial Manager Gabe Lucas
called "a bonus for the ASSU," the ASSU Senate last
night unanimously approved a plan to make the Stan
ford Directory a special ASSU business project next
year.
Under the plan, which has the blessing of Director
of Student Activities Nanci Howe, the ASSU financial
manager will take on the advisory role which the Office
of Student Activities now performs, Lucas said.
Unlike other business projects, the Directory will
remain part of the Publications Board and continue to
occupy space in the Storke Publications Building,
Lucas added.
This was done "to respect the tradition of the Direc
tory and how it has been run," said Assoc. Financial
Manager John Hall, who will be next year's financial
manager. "We did not want to reorganize the whole

thing."
The plan will also change the destination of the sur
plus revenue of the Directory â€” approximately
$60,000 this year after taxes, Hall said.
"In the past, when the Directory made surpluses, it
went into its reserves and to pay for" Lake Lagunita,
Lucas said. "We all agreed [in the futurel the Universi
ty should not fund the lake through the ASSU. But we
understand the shock of stopping funding. So the Di
rectory will fund the lake through the next fiscal year."
Future Directory surpluses, however, will fund the
Pub Board Capital Improvements Fund and other stu
dent activities, said Directory Project Manager Steve
Rosenbaum.
"I am excited because this agreement will be a wind
fall for the ASSU," Rosenbaum said. "Maybe the Di
rectory will sponsor free movie channels for campus
residences... or bring hack the Dead."
