# 'I don't think my work is ready yet'
## Stegner Fellow Chang turns down publication to focus on her craft 
### Samuel Park Staff writer 
Dreams of their names printed on the
jacket of a hard-cover book cloud the minds
of many struggling writers. But Stegner Fel
low Samantha Chang doesn't want to pub
lish her writing. At least, not yet.
"I've been avoiding the idea of publishing
a book because I don't think my work is
ready yet," said Chang, the author of several
award-winning short stories. One of them
was included in the Best American Short Sto
ries of 1994 anthology, beating out works by
such notables as John Updike and Joyce
Carol Oates.
This is a tough decision for a writer, but to
Elizabeth Tallent, director of the Creative
Writing Program, such a decision is
admirable.
"She's putting her work first. I admire
that tremendously," Tallent said. "She's very
clear about the significance of her art and I
know very few writers who understand that
and who have that integrity. She's not mak
ing any compromises."
The publishing houses — from New York,
Boston and San Francisco — approached
Chang after her short stories appeared in
The Atlantic Monthly and the Best American
anthology. For Chang, who also teaches fic
tion writing, this is a long way from the days
when she had crossed off writing as a viable
career.
"I was miserable for my entire adolescence
and for many years after. Not miserable in an
active, head-banging kind of way, but I knew
on some level that I wasn't happy and that I
couldn't see a place for myself in the world,"
Chang said. "And that can be terrifying."

Although Chang said she had always
wanted to be a writer, she was convinced that
she had to find a job — one that would give
her security.
"I think I did occasionally say, 'Yeah, I'm
gonna write a story. Someday I'm gonna sit
down and write a novel.' But that's really not
realistic," Chang said. "And in my school we
didn't have poetry and fiction classes the way
Stanford has them."
This means she didn't write fiction until
after graduate school. Through her academ
ic years at Yale and Harvard, she said she
considered careers ranging from dermatolo
gy to law to social work — anything but writ
ing.
As a graduate student at Harvard, Chang
was taking four economics classes when she
woke up one morning and said to herself, "I
hate this. I can't do this. I cannot conceive of
a life where I would have to wake up every
morning and do this for the rest of my life.
"None of the things that I always thought
I was supposed to be doing were things I was
capable of doing. It was right before I turned
25," she said.
Although it had been years since her mid
dle school attempts, Chang started writing
again. She enrolled at the University of lowa
Writer's Workshop, the same program that
has helped produce Flannery O'Connor and
Ethan Canin. But although it began a writ
ing career, it did not end her old fears.
"The whole time at lowa I wondered if I
would have to leave lowa and completely find
another job," Chang said. "I knew that I
wanted to make writing a part of my life, but
I couldn't predict my success with any cer
tainty."
Her success became more concrete when,

afler graduating from lowa, she was accepted
to Stanford as a Stegner Fellow. In this inter
nationally recognized, highly supportive pro
gram, the Creative Writing Department
gives fellowship recipients financial support
and guidance, so the fellows can concentrate
completely on their crafl.
"One really nice thing about being a fellow
at Stanford is that it's given me the opportu
nity to spend some more years considering
my material and my style," Chang said. "If I
hadn't had this time at Stanford — where
I've been lucky to have been sheltered from
the publishing world — I might have had to
try to get a contract to support myself, and
concentrate on selling instead of on further
developing my writing."
Chang is currently working on a novella
and a short story is forthcoming in the liter
ary magazine Story. Her work has also
earned several awards.
"I think she has a really very striking
approach to her characters' lives — com
pound detachment and compassion that is
extraordinary and makes the work really
unpredictable," Tallent said. "I think she's
willing to take on a broader span of life than
many new writers have the courage to take
on."
Tallent said she sees Chang in 10 years
with two books of short stories and a novel
under her belt. Chang, on the other hand,
worries that she won't continue to be pub
lished.
"As far as selling my writing and making
it big, I mean, it would be nice, but I have no
guarantee that anyone will ever want to buy
anything," Chang said. "It's a fact of life for
a writer. Past achievements matter noth
ing."
