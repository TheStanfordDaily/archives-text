Dear Friends,
First of all, I'd. like to ask for your forgiveness for speaking to you through a letter like this one. To be honest, Fve never felt so awkward and embar
rassed for approaching you like Ftn doing right now —but / have to, because the truth is, I don't want to die. What I want is to play soccer, stress over
grades, freak out over a bad haircut, fall in love, fall flat on my face, and live the life that I see all my friends having around me, as / watch from where I lie
in bed, staring at the I.V. tube running out of my chest. I want to grow up, to grow old, and to see my life unfolding before me, one day at a time. I want to
look back on my life and laugh at all the dumb things that I ve said, cry over all the dumb things I should have said but didn V, and ask myself what it was all
about and if it was worth it. I know, now, what my answer would be. The part that kills me, / guess, is that none of this occurred to me until now. And now
is almost too late. What happens to me is beyond my control anymore, and I have to rely on the goodwill and care of people like you to give me another shot
at life. It's not, however, beyond hope, and what small chance there is that someone will step up is what keeps me alive day after day, one breath after anoth
er. Fve never said anything before with as much of a mixture of hope, pride and embarrassment as Ido now, but please, all I can ask for is 20 minutes of
your time. Like I said, I don 7 want to die.
