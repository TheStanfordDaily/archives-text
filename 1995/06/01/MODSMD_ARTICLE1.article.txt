# A 						full slate for the Faculty Senate
## Provost to report on budget, faculty salaries; DR discussion expected 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice will present her
budget proposal for the 1995-96 academic year

to the Faculty Senate at
today's meeting.
Along with her presenta
tion, Rice will report on facul
ty salaries. Also at tomor
row's meeting, the senate will
debate proposals to change
the distribution requirements
and to allow proprietary re
search at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and the

Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory.
About $7.4 million will be cut from unre
stricted funds in the University's budget next
year, according to Rice's preliminary budget
proposal.
The University is in the second year of a
three-year plan to reduce spending by $18 mil

lion. Just over $6 million was cut this year.
The cuts mean a net reduction in unre
stricted spending of $4.6 million, as $2.8 mil
lion will be redirected to the central reserves,
according to the budget plan.
The plan also includes a 0.5 percent supple
ment to the endowment payout rate to fund
"earthquake repair, seismic strengthening, de
ferred maintenance and other infrastructure
costs." This holds the payout rate constant at
last year's rate of 5.25 percent.
A five-year capital plan presented in the pre
liminary budget calls for several big projects in
addition to earthquake repairs, including the
building of the new Science and Engineering
Quad, student housing and athletics.
More than half of the $730 million in antici
pated work outlined in the capital plan will be
directed to renovation, according to the plan,
with the rest to be applied to new construction.
The University Board of Trustees will vote
on the budget at its June meeting.
Voting on the Committee for Undergradu

ate Studies' proposal for DRs will be held off in
order to allow time for a "broad-ranging dis
cussion," said Senate Chair Bob Simoni, a biol
ogy professor.
The DRs have been debated all year, since
the Commission on Undergraduate Education
suggested a change in its October report.
At a March meeting, the senate recom
mended a resolution to the committee that
called for the DRs to be reduced by two. Under
the senate's plan, the year-long Cultures, Ideas
and Values course would fulfill two DRs. Stu
dents would be required to take three more
courses in the humanities and social sciences,
as well as three science courses.
Now the committee has recommended that,
beginning in the 1996-97 academic year, stu
dents should take CIV, three courses other
than CIV in the humanities and social sciences
and three science courses. This plan decreases
the total number of DRs from CIV and eight


Rice
quarter-long courses to CIV and
six quarter-long courses.
The proposal handed to the
committee by the senate "was
actually very complicated," said
Business Prof. David Brady, the
committee chair. "Some people
objected that it was rather cum
bersome. This proposal is much
more straightforward."

Because departments rather
than a University committee will
be allowed to certify courses for
DRs and because it may be easier
for students to fulfill DRs with
classes from their major, the new
system will give students more
flexibility, Brady said.
"From a student's perspec
tive, it has to be far better than
the status quo," he said.
The only item the senate
plans to vote on today is the pro
posal to allow companies to con
duct proprietary research at

SLAC and SSRL.
SSRL is a national user facili
ty which is supported by the
U.S. Department of Energy to
allow researchers to use its
unique resources, Simoni
explained.
Companies are interested in
using the facility for work relat
ed to the companies' missions —
work which would be confiden
tial and would not be publicized.
"Stanford has a rule about not
doing confidential work,"
Simoni said, "But it's difficult

for them to say no to requests
because it's a national, multi
user facility."
The rules about publicizing
work apply to Stanford faculty
and students, Simoni said, so
neither would be allowed to work
on the confidential projects.
SLAC is the only national lab
oratory which does not allow
companies to do proprietary
research, according to guidelines
set out by Physics Prof. Robert
L. Byer, chair of the senate's
Committee on Research.
