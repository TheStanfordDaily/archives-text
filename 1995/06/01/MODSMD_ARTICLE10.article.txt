# 'Energy, high spirits'
## Fourth dean of students candidate pledges full accessibility to students 
### Anne Dubinsky Contributing writer 
Patricia Brown, director for
student life at California State
University-Los Angeles, said that
she would bring enthusiasm and
commitment to the position of
dean of students at Stanford if
chosen for the job.
Brown is the fourth of five
finalists for the position to visit
Stanford. She answered ques
tions posed by members of the
Stanford community at the Cen
ter for Educational Research at
Stanford yesterday afternoon.
"I believe that I . .. have a lot
of energy, good feeling and high
spirits, which are all needed to
interact with people," she said.
Brown currently supervises all
activities and groups which affect
students and also serves as the
university's administrative hear
ing officer, handling disciplinary
cases.
Answering a question posed by
sophomore Maria Fernandez
about how she would make her
self accessible to students, Brown
said that she would speak with
students on campus, as well as
maintain an open door policy.
"The dean of students has to
be visible at student events and
activities," she said. "It's impor
tant that the dean of students will
come out and see what [students]
are about and come talk to
[them]."
Brown also stressed that activ
ities be balanced with academics.
She said she would take measures
to achieve this balance and make
sure that both "sides" of the cam
pus were represented.
When told about the conflict
between the Native American
population on campus and The
Stanford Review and asked how
she would handle the situation,

Brown said that all parties
involved in such disputes have a
right to their feelings but need to
be informed about the opinions of
others.
Last November, Native Ameri
can students protested The
Review's use of a Native Ameri
can caricature considered offen
sive by the ethnic community.
"Somewhere there needs to be
a multicultural awareness avail
able to the student body," she
said. "We need to constantly edu
cate around these issues. It's a
matter of us becoming more sen
sitive about our environment and
caring about the people with
whom we interact."
Brown said she believes that
ethnic centers and theme houses
are important because they edu
cate members of the Stanford
community about the customs,
celebrations and concerns of dif
ferent ethnic groups. She said she
also feels that they serve the
needs of ethnic students that
might not be addressed by the
rest of the campus.
She added, however, that part
of the responsibility of ethnic cen
ters lies in informing other mem
bers of the community about
their cultures. "They have a per
ception of the world that needs to
be shared with the rest of the
environment," Brown said.
Brown said she believes that a
dean of students should advocate
for students, but also needs to
express the views of the adminis
tration.
"The dean of students should
have the ability to work with
many different entities on cam
pus," she said. The dean of stu
dents "should be someone [to
whoml students can feel free to
express what they are thinking
about and feeling but who does
not necessarily agree."
