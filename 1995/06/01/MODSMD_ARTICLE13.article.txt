# Rescue effort props up the dollar

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States mount
ed a massive surprise rescue effort for the dollar yes
terday and not only pushed the value of the currency
higher but helped spark the biggest stock market rally
in almost four years.
The coordinated dollar buying by the United States
and other major industrial countries sent the dollar up
about 2 percent against both the Japanese yen and the
German mark, boosting the currency after a steep slide
last week.
This success helped to push the Dow Jones indus
trial average up by 86.46 points to a record 4,465.14. It
was the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 21, 1991.
In addition to the rising dollar, analysts said

investors took hope from a government report showing
the economy slowed to an annual growth rate of just
2.7 percent in the first three months of the year. They
viewed that as fresh evidence of a "soft Landing" that
will keep the expansion moving without risk of a reces
sion.
Traders estimated that the Fed spent $1 billion to
buy dollars and that other nations added another $1
billion in the first joint intervention to bolster the dol
lar since April 5.
"Finally we have an astute execution of exchange
rate policy after a couple of years of stumbling
around," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman
Brothers Global Economics.
