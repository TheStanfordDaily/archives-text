# US may send troops to Bosnia

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) â€” Serbs masqueraded as
peacekeepers in a new show of
audacity yesterday, driving
through government-held por
tions of Sarajevo in stolen uni
forms and U.N. vehicles. The
Serbs refused the Red Cross
immediate access to some 370
U.N. soldiers they are holding
hostage.
But Western nations seemed
increasingly ready to send more
soldiers to aid the United
Nations.
President Clinton said yester
day he would make U.S. ground
troops available to help reposition
U.N. peacekeepers in turbulent
former Yugoslavia if asked.
The decision represents a sig
nificant shift for the administra
tion, which has promised before
only to provide U.S. troops to
evacuate peacekeepers.
In spite of these developments,
Bosnia's Serbs appeared ready to
keep bargaining.
They offered the West new
talks on an old offer: releasing the
hostages in exchange for a
promise of no more NATO
attacks. The United States sent

an envoy back to Belgrade to try
to bridge differences with Serbia's
president over recognition of
Bosnia and President Clinton said
the United States would consider
dispatching soldiers to help rede
ploy, not just remove, U.N. peace
keepers.
The diplomatic maneuvering
appeared to help keep tensions
from rising further on the sixth
day of a crisis that began when
NATO launched airstrikes on
Serb ammunition dumps.
However, Sarajevans were
kept on edge by an outburst of
new fighting between Serbs and
government forces, as well as by
the reports of Serb fighters dis
guised as peacekeepers.
U.N. officials said Serbs in
French uniforms had infiltrated
the city in a U.N. armored per
sonnel carrier. Along with their
hostages, the Serbs have seized 36
white, U.N.-marked armored
vehicles, including six light tanks.
They also have dozens of other
vehicles with U.N. markings.
U.N. spokesman Alexander
Ivanko reported additional sight
ings of stolen armored vehicles in
the city. Hasan Muratovic, the

Bosnian official in charge of U.N.
relations, said army and police
were keeping a "close watch on all
U.N. vehicles and personnel."
"I am definitively not going to
hitchhike in any U.N. vehicles,"
said Sarajevo resident Sabina
Kasu movie.
A delegation of the Interna
tional Red Cross met yesterday
with Serb officials to try to visit
the peacekeepers. They were
promised an answer within two
weeks, said Andreas Pfissner,
head of the Red Cross delegation.
Bosnian Serb official Aleksa
Buha said the Serbs are following
international conventions on war
prisoners.
"We are obliged to allow the
Red Cross access. But I don't
know when this will happen," he
said, adding the Serbs will do
"everything to keep the correct
attitude toward the prisoners."
The Serbs are holding U.N.
personnel as insurance against
further NATO airstrikes like
those east of Sarajevo last week.
They have banned all NATO
overflights. On Wednesday,
NATO said a rocket or missile was
fired at a Dutch F-16, but missed.
