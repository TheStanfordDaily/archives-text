Dole denounces Hollywood
IX)S ANGELES (AP) — Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole chastised Hollywood yesterday for promoting
violence, rape and casual sex in music and movies and
said for the good of America's children "the main
streaming of deviancy must come to an end."
The GOP presidential hopeful, in the entertain
ment industry's backyard, said his outrage at today's
popular culture was more than a "codgy old attempt
of one generation to steal the fun of another. A line
has been crossed — not just of taste but of human
dignity and decency."
Naming names, Dole criticized the R-rated action
movies "Natural Born Killers" and "True Romance"
as "films that revel in mindless violence and loveless
sex." Dole also cited entertainment industry giant
Time Warner and three recording groups, Cannibal
Corpse, Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew.

Russia will join NATO war games
NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) - Despite
lingering misgivings about NATO's expansion
plans, Russia committed yesterday to military
exercises, officer exchanges and political and
military consultations with the Western
alliance.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev
pledged his country to the unprecedented pro
gram of cooperation at a meeting with his NATO
counterparts.
The decision shows that Russia's desire for
closer links and influence with the West is pre
vailing over anxiety about the alliance in gen
eral and its eastward expansion plans in par
ticular.
"NATO is no longer the enemy of Russia,"
declared NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes.
