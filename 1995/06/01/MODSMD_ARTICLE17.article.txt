## More for our money

The ASSU's investment
counselor needs to help
students each interest

EVERYONE IS familiar with
the popular figure of the
miser who hoards all his
cash under his mattress or buries
it in jars in the yard. We laugh at
this image because the practice is
at best naive and at worst para
noid. Let's face it, it's been 66
years since anyone has been that
afraid to invest their money seri
ously.
Here on campus, there's an
organization that until recently
seemed determined to mimic that
miser as closely as possible — the
Associated Students of Stanford
University government.
After years of taking in money,
the ASSU had its inertial bulk
resting on piles of financial
reserves. The amount of reserves
is in the $2 million neighborhood.

This money has come from
the pockets of students
past and present; however,
previous attempts to
return some of the money
to students or fund a nice
program for students have
been coolly met by sena
tors.

Of course, the ASSU needs
reserves, like any business. But
the ASSU had not been using this
money wisely. For all intents and
purposes, the ASSU had decided to
sock away much of its money in
one of the lowest-growth invest
ments around.
A large balance was, and still is,
being kept in an interest-bearing
checking account. This account
earns about 1 percent interest
annually, as a pertinent article in
last week's edition of The Stanford
Review pointed out.
Fortunately, the student gov
ernment has acted on this issue
and should be applauded for doing
so. Outgoing ASSU Financial
Manager Gabe Lucas has hired an

investment adviser to help the
ASSU use these reserves more
wisely. We hope the people who
hold the purse strings listen to
their counselor.
Even if the ASSU only wants to
use the safest of investments, they
have several options open to them.
Two choices more lucrative than
interest-bearing checking would
be a simple savings account and a
money-market account. Both
would push up the interest earned
by several percentage points. A
money market account could even
kick it into the 5 3 /4 percent range.
Neither investment is unusual —
teens with paper-delivery money
often use both. Both are very safe
options, and money is easily avail
able for withdrawal.
But why stop there? Some of the
money could be placed into Trea
sury bills. Dollars could even be
transferred into — gasp — a
mutual fund, where it might earn
some serious interest. Businesses
don't seem to have trouble using
such investments. They would be

equally appropriate for the
ASSU.
Finally, the ASSU could
again consider returning
some of this money to the
students. A one-time refund
to the current crop of stu
dents wouldn't be entirely
fair, but a gift for the future

would. A work of art or well-land
scaped public area would be nice.
Alternatively, the student govern
ment could show their commit
ment to education by funding
scholarships for students.
In fact, some have suggested
trying to position the reserves so
at some point they could be used as
an endowment, with a portion of
interest income going to alleviate
the amount of ASSU special fees
that students have to pay. That
would truly be intelligent use of
the reserves that would aid stu
dents today and tomorrow.
At the very least, the ASSU
owes it to the students they are
supposed to serve to do what's best
with our money.
