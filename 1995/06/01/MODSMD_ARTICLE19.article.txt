## Rubbernecking on life's 280 
### 
Fortunately, no one was hurt
in yesterday's car wreck. Lucky,
because there seem to be more
problems on the roads these days. There
are enough daily smash-ups for radio sta
tions to use the poetic "traffic and weath
er together" pitch to grab listeners every
seven minutes.
But the traffic that inevitably follows
these freeway fender-benders usually has
little to do with an emergency crew tak
ing up space and blocking a lane. The
problem is that everyone stops to look.
They peer out the window and gawk.
Maybe it's a fascination of the abomi
nation. The gore, the blood, the carnage.
If it's really so painfully gross, then why
do we stare? It could be that we genuine
ly care. But most of us just drive on by.
Forgetting the Kitty Genovese story, fig
uring that someone else will call, some
one else will stop.
Really, we want to see what's going
on.
In a way, we do this stop-and-look rou
tine all the time, especially at Stanford.
We compare. To figure out where we
stand. To see who is doing what, who is
going where. Like people asking how
many hours you've spent in the library or
how many pages you've written on that
paper — as if that has some bearing on
them.
We just want to see what everyone's
up to, to measure how far they've gone
and, if we've got it together, to lend
admiring glances.

We flip through People's 50 Most
Beautiful. Ogle, and scrutinize our faces.
We soak in the 11 o'clock news. Sigh, and
think of our tragedies. We check out the
muscle definition at the gym. Flex, and
lift a little more.
Surreptitiously, we look over shoul
ders at returned tests, to see who was
lying when they whined about "failing"
the exam. Or not so secretly, with an
annoying, "What'dja get?"
A culture of comparisons.
In a unspoken game of jockeying to be
the best, you look around. To keep the
competitive edge. Because mediocrity is
boring. In the NBA playoffs, Jordan's
greatness dimmed and disappointed, but
Rodman's presto chango coif gets
noticed.
We've been taught to compare and
designed to compete. But maybe we
aren't supposed to be so conscious of it
all.
I suppose a little of this is harmless.
Maybe it's even helpful. You find out
that, hey, you're in pretty darn good
standing in the grand scheme. Confi
dence and motivation fire up. But exces
sive comparing may just slow you down.
The car crash phenomenon personified.
And you may be losing a part of yourself
while taking that look.
Because comparisons can cause a
problem or two.
Its disease strikes at funny times,
after an unsuspecting victim gets a big
time acceptance letter and people ask not

how, but, " Why did you get in?"
The impostor syndrome. Insecurity
bores its way in and makes a home.
It may infiltrate when you meet your
roommate, who happens to be the world
champion of something. And your sports
memories consist of finally making the
Varsity team, bringing a pillow for the
bench and braiding everyone's hair
before the game. Then your dad had the
gall to tell you to try out for the Stanford
team, even though your best and only
chance was to be the towel girl. You feel a
little lame.
It can happen when you look around
your chemical engineering class and see
that you're one of a handful of women.
That can get you thinking, "Maybe
there's something intrinsic here that
makes me, well, deficient." It can become
a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even if it's
entirely untrue.
In the midst of comparisons, the
impostor syndrome makes you remem
ber all the things you didn't do, rather
than what you've done. Brings you down
a notch — hopefully, not far enough to
lose your perch.
Checking out everyone's exterior, it's
easy to forget that most of who we are
remains hidden. Things that people don't

talk about when they're busy pol
ishing that shiny and pretty,
closed and hard shell.
Comparisons obscure the real
picture for the air-brushed reali
ty.
Of course, the other extreme is
a master-of-the-universe arro
gance. People who've picked the
date of the Judiciary Committee
hearing for their Supreme Court
appointment. The guy who
reflects, serenely, that his Har
vard Med School interview was,
well, more like a recruiting trip.

Clearly missing that healthy bal
ance of confidence and optimism
called humility, somewhere
between, "Gosh, I'm just lucky to
be here," and "Damn straight, I
deserve all of this." (Ho didn't get
in.i
After doing your Maverick
impression, trying to figure out
who's the best and where you fit
in, it might be good no, far bet
ter to look within. In a Stuart
Smalley affirmation move, stop
wasting your time. Good enough.
Unless you really care.
And if nothing else, a little
introspection might get the free
ways moving again.

Thanks for playing, it's hern fun.
