### Kristie Lilje Contributing writer 
Commemorating the 20th anniversary of the
Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching,
Dean of Humanities and Sciences John Shoven
announced the 1995 award recipients at a recep
tion Tuesday afternoon.
The five faculty members in the School of
Humanities and Sciences who received the
honor were John Bender, professor of English;
Rima Greenhill, lecturer in the Department of
Slavic Languages and Literatures; John Griffin,
assistant professor of chemistry; Jan Krawitz,
professor of communication; and Claude Steele,
professor of psychology.
According to Shoven, the "outstanding inter
national reputation" of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences rests in the different fields that
the recipients' work encompasses.

Pointing out the winners' wide variety of
scholarly work, Shoven said at Tuesday's recep
tion, "This afternoon we honor a social psychol
ogist, a specialist in the comparative study of lit
erature and the visual arts, a documentary fdm
maker, a Russian language lecturer and a bio-or
ganic chemist."
Each winner will receive $5,000 and a $1,000
salary increase. Also included in the award is an
additional $5,000 which goes directly to the fac
ulty member's department. These matching
funds help to further enhance the teaching pro
gram within the department.
The Bing Fund for Teaching supports the
awards as part of the teaching initiative in hu
manities and sciences.
The Dean's Award is not geared to a specific
kind of teaching, unlike many other teaching
awards. It "recognizes excellence in teachingde
fined broadly to mean the classroom, laborato

ry, advising, mentoring, [teaching assistant]
training and job placement programs," Shoven
said.
According to Judith Cain, Shoven's assis
tant, departments within the school submit
nominations to the dean based on these factors.
Input from the students is also considered, she
said.
The nominations remain active for two years,
said Ellen Woods, assistant dean of undergradu
ate studies. This year, the pool consisted of 18
nominees, five of whom were selected, she said.
Although this year's award winners cover a
range of disciplines, "they also have much in
common. Each has been described by his or her
students as 'amazing,' 'approachable,' 'caring,'
'dedicated,' 'far-beyond-the-call,' 'motivating,'
'super,' 'understanding' and 'well-prepared,' or
simply 'the best professor I've ever had at Stan
ford,' " Shoven said.
