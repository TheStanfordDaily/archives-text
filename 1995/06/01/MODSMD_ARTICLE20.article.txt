Wagner has deceived campus about Ticket Office scandal

STANFORD EVENTS, the office
Lois Wagner heads, controls use of
Memorial Auditorium and runs the
Tresidder Ticket Office. Now that, over
the past few weeks, Stanford Events has
backed off on its attempt to coerce Mem
Aud users to pay the Ticket Office for
unnecessary ticketing, Ms. Wagner is
trying to mislead Daily reporters and
readers, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and anyone else
who looks into the issue, by denying
that her office ever attempted to impose
the policy and portraying ASSU com
plaints about Stanford Events as those
of uninformed, belligerent students
picking on her for no reason.
In case anyone is curious, here are
the facts Ms. Wagner is clouding:
Larry Davidson. Ms. Wagner's num
ber two at Stanford Events, told Jon
Toma, co-director of next year's ASSU
Speakers Bureau, that Stanford Events
would not approve Speakers Bureau
requests to use Mem Aud unless the
organization filed a work order for the
Ticket Office to ticket the events. Phil
McLauglin and Julie Wahlgren at Stan
ford Events also told Jon this. Addition

ally, this policy existed in writing —
along with Mem Aud request forms,
Stanford Events sent an instructions
sheet which listed, among the "respon
sibilities of user" for a group using
Mem Aud, that if any tickets for an
event are sold, the sponsor "must sell
or otherwise disperse" (note that the
cleverly-worded phrase "otherwise dis
perse" means it is not only sold tickets
that are covered) "those tickets through
the ticket office operated by Stanford
Events." Mr. Davidson told Jon this
policy has always applied to the Speak
ers Bureau; the Speakers Bureau sim
ply has been in violation whenever it
didn't use the Ticket Office. Finally, if
there is any doubt remaining, see Larry
Davidson's explanation of exactly this
policy in the Thursday, May 11, issue of
The Daily.
Facing public pressure not to man
date thousands of dollars of charges on
student groups for unnecessary services
(the Speakers Bureau, like Flicks, saw
no need for the Ticket Office's ser
vices), Ms. Wagner announced that
Stanford Events now recognizes that
the Speakers Bureau, Flicks and Ram's

Head have operated under a longstand
ing "exemption" from the policy of
mandatory Ticket Office use.
Then, backtracking at supersonic
speed from what had become the second
embarrassing situation for her office
this quarter (attempting to cancel the
commencement procession being the
first), Ms. Wagner asserted in the
Thursday, May 18, Daily that her office
never tried to force Flicks and the
Bureau to use the Ticket Office. In the
same article, Mr. Davidson gave the
laughable, Reaganesque statement that
he could not "remember" what he (and
the two other Stanford Events employ
ees) told Mr. Toma or the Daily earlier
this quarter. And in an exchange with
Vice Provost Mary Edmonds, Ms. Wag
ner also denied ever trying to impose
the ticket rule, claiming The Daily por
trayed Stanford Events' policy incor
rectly.
It is a time-honored tradition of dis
honesty among bureaucrats who foul
up — when you wish you'd never done
something, claim the papers had it all
wrong and you never actually did it.
Ms. Wagner is either lying or

unaware of a major policy the rest of
her office decided to impose orally and
in writing. The latter option is a patent
ly implausible possibility — we refuse to
believe Ms. Wagner could be as inno
cently oblivious as would be necessary
for it to hold true, especially in light of
her mean-spirited barbs about the
Flicks Director's "listening skills" and
her refusal to return two phone calls
from the Speakers Bureau and one from
a KZSU news reporter attempting to
clear up these factual inconsistencies.
The University should reprimand
Ms. Wagner for such a major act of
deception in her official capacity as she
lied to the administration, the media
and the public. At the very least, Ms.
Wagner owes The Daily, the Speakers
Bureau, Mary Edmonds and the rest of
the campus a public apology for her
attempts to lie to cover up her actions.
