# Soliciting bone marrow donations by telephone should not be tolerated
## 
### 
I could handle the flyers. Flyers are
a staple of the Stanford campus. Fly
ers everywhere. No problem.
I could handle the e-mail chain let
ters. People shouldn't do it, but the
cause was just, so I let it go. No prob
lem - _
When somebody telephoned me in

my room, I stopped handling it. I
stopped wanting to handle it. This was
no longer a plea for charity; this had
become extortion, pure and simple.
These people were trying to guilt me
into giving up my bone marrow.
Make no mistake â€” I have nothing
but sympathy for Evan Chen. Anyone
who shares my last name and looks
good in a tux deserves the best in life,
and his leukemia is a tragedy. His
open letter to Stanford touched me,
and I had been seriously considering
taking the time to register myself.

Unfortunately, somebody went too
far.
This is not about charity or com
passion. This is about my privacy and
my desire not to be harassed by any
one, whether they're selling encyclo
pedias or collecting for the Jehovah's
Witnesses. I'm sure the people acting
on Evan's behalf have only the best
intentions at heart, but perhaps in the
future they should think before emot
ing. Desperation does not justify rude
ness or condescension.
I am a responsible adult. I don't

need to be told where to go, what to do
or how to think. And I don't like it
when people try to tell me any of those
things. Mutual respect, that's what I
want. I want respect for my ability to
make rational decisions without being
poked or prodded by anybody. I want
respect for my rights and privileges as
a human being and a citizen of the
United States of America.
Life's tough already. We don't need
to make it any more unpleasant.
