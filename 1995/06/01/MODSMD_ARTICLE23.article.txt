# Fish ladder to allow steelhead spawning
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
For the first time since 1929,
steelhead trout will soon be able
to complete their journey
upstream to the spawning
waters of Los Trancos Creek,
via a fish ladder.
Sixty-six years ago, Stan
ford built a diversion dam in
the creek for campus irrigation
and fire protection. Since then,
the structure has prevented
the steelhead from traveling
upstream to spawn.
Though the fish ladder has
been in the planning stages for
years, Stanford just began con
struction on May 22. The pro
ject is scheduled for completion
this August, according to Bob
Hockey, the demands and plan
ning manager for Stanford's
Utilities Department.
Currently, steelhead coming
from the San Francisco Bay
reach the dam and are then
forced to stop their journey. But
the implementation of the new
fish ladder will permit the trout
to navigate over the diversion
dam into upstream spawning
waters. The fishway will also
provide a "fish screen" — a
piece of perforated metal run
ning down the stream that
allows the water into the dam

but keeps the steelhead on
track as they travel back down
stream after spawning.
The ladder is like a staircase
with about 20 steps, Hockey
said. Each tread is a small pond,
with water running down from
the top step. The ladder is about
seven feet high.
Total project costs are esti
mated at $350,000, including
construction and design costs,
according to Hockey. A grant
from the California Wildlife
Conservation Board will pay for
$97,000 and Stanford will fund
the rest.
"We are really excited about
this project," Hockey said. "It is
a great joint venture between
Stanford and both the State
Department of Fish and Game
and community environmental
groups.
"It is a win-win situation;
everyone is really happy with
the outcome," he added.
Steelhead trout are listed as
a "species of special concern" by
the California Department of
Fish and Game and are a candi
date for federal endangered
species status. San Fran
cisquito Creek and its tributary
Los Trancos are two of a small
number of creeks in the South
Bay that still support steelhead
populations.
