## Friendships Sports brings us closer together 
### 
What is it that makes me
such a devoted sports
fan? It could be the love
of competition, both as an ath
lete and a spectator. There is
also a fascination with statis
tics, which seem to tell the story
of a player or team in numbers.
It may be the fact that you

never know what will happen,
who will step into the spotlight
for a fleeting moment or who
will achieve the unforgettable,
the unexpected or the unimag
inable. Sports can be enjoyed
and admired at all levels, which
I think leads to the answer to
my question â€” sports for me is
about friendships.
It's about going to Stanford
football games with your fresh
man dormmates and showing
your combined spirit and pride
not only for the Cardinal, but
for your house.
It's playing frisbee golf on
campus at night.
It's getting together on a
sunny weekend afternoon and
playing over-the-line at Roble
Field.
It's packing into the car, head
ing to the Oakland Coliseum and
sitting the bleacher seats (and
cheering for the Yankees).
It's about losing 16 straight
games of NHL Hockey on Sega
Genesis, but gaining incredible
fan support and celebrating that
first victory.
It's waking up at 9 a.m. dur
ing Dead Week to watch the
Cardinal men's hoopsters beat
UNC-Charlotte at the NCAA
tournament.

It's donning the burglar's
outfit and playing capture the
flag on the Main Quad.
It's having your roommates
act as analysts and color commen
tators while you're playing TetrLs.
It's huddling together over
the Sporting Green every day at
lunch (even though I hate that
damn newspaper).
It's heading off to Minneapo
lis for spring break as the beat
writer for the men's swimming
and diving team, accompanied by
a head photographer, an assis
tant photographer, a sidebar
writer and a statistician. Do you
think anyone was suspicious?
It's seeing a pro fro decide
Stanford was the choice to
make while watching a baseball
game at Sunken Diamond on a
perfect spring day (catching
that foul ball was probably the
clincher).
It's hall soccer on the Hall of
the Sun. Broken fingers be
damned! Play on!
It's getting together with
some freshman dormmates and
going to the Pigskin Classic
football game.
It's being on the phone with
your roommate while the Stan
ford footbaii team is trouncing
Penn State in the Blockbuster
Bowl.
It's cheering adamantly
against the Bulls to seejust how
childish a room full of college
students can be.
It's about asking my room
mates for a column topic every
Wednesday and offering cash if
someone will write my column
for me.
It's spending Thanksgiving
break together at Long Beach
watching Stanford win two
NCAA water polo titles.
It's putting wagers on the
line at the bowling alley and sur
viving the incessant heckling
and distraction efforts to pull
out a victory.
