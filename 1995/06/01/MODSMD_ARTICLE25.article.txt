# Men's golf one back after a round
## Arizona State leads at par as Oklahoma State is down by three; Chang fires 71 but frustrated Woods bends club

Needing a strong start in this week's NCAA
Championships in Columbus, Ohio, the No. 2 Stan
ford men golfers came through in the first round, fir
ing a 1-over-par 289 to put themselves in a tie for
second place behind scorching-hot Arizona State.
Tied with Florida State and Texas, the defending
national champion Cardinal put took an enormous
first step towards retaining the title. Joining the
squad in the top five are top-ranked Oklahoma State
and Tulsa, who are tied for fifth at 291.
"We're obviously in pretty good shape," said head
coach Wally Goodwin. "We're in much better shape
after the first round this year (one stroke back) than
we were last year (13 strokes back). But last year we
shot a (school-record) 273 in the second round, and
I'm pretty sure this course will not be anywhere near
as forgiving. On this course, you can get some
birdies, but then the course will take them right
back."
Senior All-American Notah Begay led the way for
the Cardinal, firing a 70 and finding himself tied for
sixth place overall. Displaying the consistency and
ability that has made him an anchor for the team the
second half of the season, Begay posted twin 35's on
the front and back sides.
"For me the key was that I putted great today,"
Begay said. "There was really nothing specatcular
about the round, but I was able to manage my game
fairly well. I made some good putts, several of the
par-saving variety. There are very few days when
you make all your putts. I had three lip out. If I had
made them all, I could have shot a 66 or 67. Overall,
though, I'll take it."
Senior fifth man Jerry Chang provided a pleasant
surprise for the Cardinal as \ oil, shooting a 1-under
par 71 to place second on the team and tied for 10th
overall. His round was highlighted by a 3-under 33
on the back nine. The most thrilling moment of the
round came on the seventh hole, where he chipped in
one of his three birdies.
"I felt I was hitting the ball well on both the front
and back side," Chang said. "I was keeping all my
drives in the fairway, and that was the key. I came
into this tournament I feel with the proper attitude,
and so far everything seems to be working out. The
chip-in on No. 7 was big because that got me to one
under par, which was a great goal to achieve."
A recent addition to the varsity squad after spend
ing most of the season with the second team, Chang
has come on strong in the past month with solid con
tributions at the U.S. Intercollegiate here on the
Farm and at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in Richland, Wash., along with a strong fin
ish at the NCAA Western Regionals. Chang solidi
fied his place in the team's top five by topping senior
Ail-American Steve Burdick in a 54-hole qualifier
last week.
