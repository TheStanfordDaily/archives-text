## Hoops Class of '99 adds to the mix 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Stanford head men's basketball
coach Mike Montgomery is used to puz
zles. Not of the 100-, 500- or 1,000-piece
jigsaw variety, but instead, the five
players-on-t he-court, 12-man-roster
type. He's spent his whole life making
those pieces fit.
Some puzzles have been easier to fit
than others. And some puzzles have
turned out better than others. There
was the puzzle of 1988-89 season which
Montgomery was able to mold into a 26-
7 masterpiece as well as, in the ninth
year coach's opinion, Stanford's best
team. There was also the disjunct puz
zle of 1992-93 which produced over
three times as many losses, 23, as wins,
7. And then, there was the puzzle of
1994-95.
In a season when expectations were
lukewarm at best, Montgomery pieced
together a 20-win gem which included
Stanford's first NCAA tournament tri
umph in 53 years. As for the encore next
season, there's no reason to believe the
picture to be any less pretty.
"With the nucleus of players right
now, we might be able to attain that
level of the '88-'B9 team again," Mont
gomery said.
The top six cogs in Stanford's Big
Red Machine are back along with sever
al new pieces. It should be a puzzle that
not only fits nicely but looks even bet
ter.
The All-Pacific 10 Conference back
court of junior Dion Cross and sopho
more Brevin Knight return as one of the
nation's premier guard combinations.
Forwards Darren Allaway, ajunior, and
senior Andy Poppink provide defensive

intensity and versatility on the front
lines. All-Pac-10 Freshman First Team
center Tim Young will continue to
improve and dominate the paint. And
sixth man extraordinaire David Har
bour will be back to provide sizzle and
spark ofT the bench. What this all means
is that there should be very little let
down in the performance of the Cardi
nal machine with so many key cogs
remaining.
But even with so many pieces already
fitting so nicely in place, Montgomery
also has the opportunity to add some
new pieces to the mix with his highly
touted recruiting class. Rated as a top
-15 caliber recruiting class, the Cardinal
coaching staff will be more than happy
to fit these pieces into the puzzle.
The recruiting class is a pseudo-Fab
Five if you will. At the point guard slot
is Arthur Lee. A 6-foot point guard from
North Hollywood, Lee (24 points per
game, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, 3 steals)
has the Cardinal coaching staff raving
about his exceptional, Knight-esque
quickness. This means that when
Knight needs a breather, there
shouldn't be much of a dropoff at the
point guard spot in terms of defensive
play and ball handling.
"Art Lee, quickness-wise, may be
closer to Brevin than what we've had,"
Montgomery said. "That gives us the
ability to stay quick and defend."
The recruit at shooting guard is 6-3
sniper Kris Weems. Named "Mr.
Kansas" and Kansas Boys Player of the
Year, Weems led his team to the state
title while averaging 19 ppg and shoot
ing an eye-popping 52 percent from
three-point land.
"He's a good standing three-point
shooter with a great feel for the game,"

said assistant coach Doug Oliver.
In Pittsburgh native Pete Sauer, a 6-
8, 230-pound Cardinal recruit at for
ward, Stanford gets another player in
the mold of Poppink — versatile, athlet
ic and explosive. Sauer missed 14 games
the past season with a broken left wrist
but still finished as his high school's all
time leading scorer, racking up 1890
points with an average of 21.7 ppg with
a field goal percentage of 53.
"He's a big, strong three man," Oliv
er said. "He's a really explosive jumper.
One step and he can dunk it a lot of
ways. He's also a good standing perime
ter shooter."
Weems wasn't the onl}< future Cardi
nal missing action this past year. Stan
ford's other recruit at forward, 6-9, 220-
pound Mark Seaton played just two
games this last season with a stress frac
ture in his foot. And 6-11, 230-pound
center Andy McClelland sat out his
entire final high school season with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his
knee.
Seaton will be ready and at full speed
by the time practice begins in the fall.
McClelland, however, is an entirely dif
ferent story. With more rehab to go,
McClelland may not be ready until well
into the regular season which presents
the coaching staff with the decision of
redshirting the big man.
Without McClelland and with the
graduation of Cardinal center Bart
Lammersen, Stanford has a bit of a
problem as far as depth in the pivot.
After Young, no Cardinal player mea
sures over 6-9, with Allaway as the
biggest body but slated for the power
forward position.
"The one area of concern is big
guy," Montgomery said. "We might
have to make some adjustments in
moving people around."
With so many returning con
tributors, the recruits will battle
for playing time. But the area
where the recruits will provide
most help is on the practice floor
where they will give Stanford the
necessary depth, which was lack
ing at times last year, to run
faster-paced, more intense and
competitive game simulations.
The team will need the tougher
practices next year with an
arguably tougher schedule which
features not only the regular Pac
-10 teams, one of them national
champion UCLA, but also Seton
Hall and national powerhouse
North Carolina.
"I think the schedule's an indi
cation that our program is stepping
up to the next level," Young said.
"We're getting better mid better,
and obviously, national recognition
helps us."
Even with a potenthil Van Gogh
or Picasso on hand, Montgomery

will still need to smooth out the
rough spots and even out some
edges. After the season-ending
debacle against Massachusetts in
the NCAA tournament, the Cardi
nal's main weakness was glaringly
exposed — toughness. First there's
the physical side where Stanford
got bullied and bumped to death by
UMass's mass.
"This offseason we need to hit
the weight room," Harbour said
after the loss to the Minutemen.
"The past offseason, we worked
hard on things like shooting, but
what we really need to do is get big
ger and stronger."
Toughness of a mental sort is
also a concern raised by Cardinal
players.
"Mentally, we just have to get
stronger," Young said. "We had
strength to play against UMass, we
just didn't for some reason or other.
And I think most of that is mental."
liesides bench pressing and psy
chotherapy sessions, certain play
ers with nicks and bumps like Ail
away, Cross and Knight need to
heal up.
With smoother, stronger, better
polished pieces available for Mont
gomery, the end result is simply a
better-fitting, more spectacular fin
ished product.
