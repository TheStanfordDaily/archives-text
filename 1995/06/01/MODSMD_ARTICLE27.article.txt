## Photographs, not articles, stand out 
### 
Photo rocks. Without the photography
department, there would be no sports
section. Sports editors think photos are
just there to fill up space, but — as usual —
they're wrong.

How many people actually read the sports
articles and how many look at the photos? In
a random poll (with no statistical significance
whatsoever), I found 82 percent of the par
ticipants view the photos, 6 percent actually
read the articles and the rest couldn't care
less about sports at Stanford. These are the
individuals who think Stanford athletes
should not receive even one unit per quarter
for their commitment to Stanford's out
standing athletic tradition. These results
prove it — photos make the sports section.
When a photographer captures a great
moment on film, the image will remain in
people's minds long after any written words.
In January 1982, Walter looss, Jr., a photog
rapher for Sports Illustrated, immortalized
Dwight Clark's game-winning catch that
sent the 49ers to their first Super Bowl. No
one remembers the article that went with
the photo, but who will evei forget that cover
of SI?
Unfortunately, sports photographers are
underappreciated, especially at The Daily.
We dodge wild overthrows by the second

baseman from San Jose State to capture the
slide at home. We out-sprint Anthony Book
man to shoot the neck and neck finish of the
100-meter dash. We roam the catwalks
above Maples Pavilion to get a different per
spective of the action on the floor, be it bas
ketball, volleyball or gymnastics. We really
should get hazard pay for the risks we take.
Photo does have its perks, though. Pho
tographers get the best seats in the house.
We ride in the pace car for cycling, stand on
the sidelines for football and sit on the court
for basketball.
Then again, shooting basketball has its
price, too. Look at the damage Dennis Rod
man of the superlative San Antonio Spurs
did to a Nikon camera last Sunday. Do you
know how much that equipment cost? I wept
to see it destroyed.
My dream is to shoot for Sports Illustrat
ed. I want to enter the elite club of photogra
phers who contract out to SI to cover profes
sional football, soccer, tennis, even golf (the
one sport where you can only take pictures
after the athlete hits the ball). In order to
obtain my goal, I will have to spend many
days and nights juggling lenses and holding
umbrellas for the current members of the
club. Of course, I will do my juggling act on
the sidelines of a Redskins contest at RFK or
Orioles game in Camden Yards. Can't com
plain about that.
Until the last day of production on the
Commencement Issue, I will have to put up
with the lack of appreciation I and the rest of
my comrades receive at The Daily. Just
remember, photo does more than fill space.
We are the sports section.
