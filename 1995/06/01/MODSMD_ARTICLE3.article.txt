# Outside consultant hired to review Code
## 
### Alda Leu Contributing writer 
Stanford has hired Gary
Pavela, an outside consultant, to
evaluate the effectiveness of the
University's judicial process and
its Fundamental Standard, in
cluding the Honor Code.
"Every few years it is very im
portant that we review the admin
istrative structure to see if the sys
tem is still working," said Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds.
The Honor Code, a 73-year-old
document, says that students, in
dividually and collectively, will not
"give or receive aid in examina
tions" or in-class work. It also

holds students to the standard of
taking "an active part in seeing to
it that others . . . uphold the spirit
and letter of the Honor Code."
Pavela, a former president of
the National Committee for Acad
emic Integrity, is the director of
student conduct programs at the
University of Maryland at College
Park.
"[Judicial Affairs Officer] Sally
Cole, a colleague of mine in the Na
tional Center for Academic In
tegrity, had talked to me about her
sense that Stanford needed to do
more to involve students in the ju
dicial process," Pavela said.
"Gary Pavela is reviewing
everything because, in my view,
our process is cumbersome and in

efficient," Cole said.
Pavela was at Stanford for two
days last week to discuss the
Honor Code with students. He

spoke with five
students about
their reactions to
the judicial sys
tem, he said.
Pavela said
that some stu
dents agreed that
the judicial
process seems
"convoluted and
complex."

Honor codes are an effective
tool, but they must be visible and
students and faculty have to be in
volved in educating each other

about them, Cole said.
"The Honor Code here is al
most exclusively run by the ad
ministration," she added.
The evaluation is meant to in
crease student participation in the
judicial review process, as well as
make the system more efficient.
Currently, most Honor Code vi
olations are handled administra
tively with students waiving their
right to a hearing. Pavela said
that one possibility would be to
create an honor committee to in
volve students in decisions about
punishments — even for those
who waive their right to a hearing.
Pavela said he plans to revisit


Edmonds
Stanford in the summer to exam
ine other aspects of the judicial
system that do not require stu
dent input, such as the hierarchy
of committees which meet occa
sionally to discuss judicial affairs.
The focus will shift away from
the initial attention to the Honor
Code to a review of the entire
Fundamental Standard and the
judicial process.
Pavela hopes to have the final
proposals completed by next fall.
He will submit his suggestions to
University administrators, who
will then evaluate them and
decide what changes to imple
ment.
