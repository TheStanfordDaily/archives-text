# PREACHING TO THE UNCONVERTED THE TRAGICALLY HIP HIT THE STATES
## 
### MICHAEL G. NICHOLS 
When the Hip
formed in 1986
the common
musical ground for the
band was the early '60s

British club scene: The An
imals, Yardbirds, the early

Stones all left their
marks on the band.

Baker jokingly
noted their early
years were marked
by "smoky dinuy

little clubs and a
bunch of white kids
who could barely

play their instruments
— We seemed to have a

natural kinship. When
you're first learning to play

release.
Now they're about to tour

Europe with the Stones. That is,
after they finish up playing across

the States with Jimmy Page and
Robert Plant.

The distance between the north and south
side of Lake Erie is not nearly as great as the
divide between the popularity of the Tragi
cally Hip in Canada and the States. Yet, while
just about any and every band would sell
their mothers to tour with these legends, a
band with a relatively small following in the
States has been given the chance.
"It's kind of a strange situation," said gui
tarist Rob Baker in a telephone interview.
"We've never done opening slots for any
one. .. and we always believe it's better to
play for your own audience, no matter how
small. But if you're going to open for some
one, that's as good a place to start as any.
"If we had our druthers and could tour
with absolutely anyone it would be
Page / Plant and the Stones. So, I guess you
could say we have our druthers."
The Hip are definitely a live band. Rather
than touring to generate sales for an
album, they generate albums for the
chance to tour. And what they play is never
static. A live concert is a chance to experi
ment, in lest the boundaries of a song and to
make it new each time it is played.
"It used to be that the album was in second
position to being able to perform live," said
Baker. "Now they have grown into a symbi
otic relationship. We've never been a band
who tours to support our albums."
Baker says the band's "live versions (are) a
lot better than studio versions. We only play
songs that continue to grow. We also don't
care whether it's a radio song or whatever.
What matters is whether a song continues to
get better as we play it. When it gets fixed we
either rest it or forget it."
This is a bold stance to take in a music
world where hit singles are the determining
factor in concert attendance. If you don't
cater to the MTV generation, it's difficult to
make it big.

But though the Hip don't dwell on radio
play they certainly get it. They have fathered
such familiar songs as "New Orleans is Sink
ing," "Fully Completely," "Locked in the
Trunk of a Car," "At the Hundredth Meridi
an" and "Grace Too."
That's quite an accomplishment for a
young hand with four full-length records.
But this is fortune accidental. According to
Baker, the Hip have "never seen (themselves]
as a hit singles hand."
"I hardly listen to the radio. It's not a
major concern in our life," Baker said. "But
it's hard not to get pigeon holed, especially in
America where business is moved by hit sin
gles."
"Fully Completely," the band's third LP
was sold state-side as "hit" material, a move
that caused the band enough angst to switch
to Atlantic.
"It was marketed more in singles fashion.
They really went after classic rock radio and
wacky promotions. With beer cozies and
Frisbees. We were kind of put out by it and
disillusioned," Baker said in a wry tone of

voice.
Part of the problem the Hip have with the
one-hit wonder phenomena is that it forbids
experimentation.
"1 think that an album can never really
document where the hand is at that particu
lar time," Baker declared. "If we went in and
recorded these songs today, they would be
better than they are on album. We don't go
into the studio with tactic of'that formula re
ally worked,' or 'we need more radio play....'
"In the early days, someone would bring
semi-finished songs to band. Now, it's al
ways five of us sitting around. 1 have a riff,
and off it goes. The blocks we build songs
out of are getting smaller and smaller, and I
think this gives us a much more unique sort
of sound."
According to Baker, sitting around writing
songs together is never the same experience
twice.
"The shortest amount of time it has ever
taken us to write a song is probably five min
utes. The longest it has ever taken... well,
there are tunes out there we've been ham-

mering away at for the last five or six
years," Baker said. "You're not satis-
fied and leave it alone for a few
months or year. You can slog away
in vain for hours and weeks on some
songs. And even though all the time
and effort you put into it may feel
wasted at the time, it enables you to

write other songs in five minutes.
(Writing quickly is] not like being
struck by lightening, even though
it may feel like it."

But what is like being
struck by lightning
for the Hip is per
forming. Not only does
their stage presence magni
fy the music they play, but
the band members display

intense energy that defies their

hectic tour schedule.
While recently they have scaled
down their touring to three weeks on
the road and one week at home, they

once played 250 to 300 dates a year when
starting out 10 years ago.
"Every album we've done, stuff

we've written on the road has been a large
basis of it, even though it's not until we get

time off the road that we get anything
done. We just had some few days off and did
some studio work. Did seven songs toward
next effort," Baker said matter-of-factly, as il
"Day for Night" hadn't just come out last
year.
The band used to tour for a year, take one
month off, and then jump back into record
ing. But, when they got back into the studio,
they found that a four-week vacation had
drawbacks.
"You totally change directions and be
come more introspective when you take time
off. Incorporating studio work into road
time will continue to be a good thing tor the
band."
Besides the atmosphere of the road, the
Hip incorporate into their song writ
ing the element of visual stimulation.
While working on "Day for Night," Baker, an
art school graduate, went to local artists and
asked them for slides of their work.
"When we went into the studio we pro
jected the images while playing, if anything
struck us we went with it," Baker said.
Interestingly, Baker says his favorite artist
is former Stanford Prof. Nathan Oliveira.
"We were talking about using some
Nathan Oliveira art for our last record cover,
but in the end it didn't seem to suit the
music," Baker said.
Coming up with a visual abbreviation for
the Hip is a difficult task, considering the
complexity of their songs
As Baker said, "a song is a poem. It's sup
posed to stimulate you."
And stimulate the Hip do. Some day soon
their popularity in the States will rise to what
it is internationally, but until then their con
certs will be, in the words of Baker, an exer
cise in "preaching to the unconverted."

Robert Plant.

The distance between the north and south
side of Lake Erie is not nearly as great as the
divide between the popularity of the Tragi
cally Hip in Canada and the States. Yet, while
just about any and every band would sell
their mothers to tour with these legends, a
band with a relatively small following in the
States has been given the chance.
"It's kind of a strange situation," said gui
tarist Rob Baker in a telephone interview.
"We've never done opening slots for any
one. .. and we always believe it's better to
play for your own audience, no matter how
small. But if you're going to open for some
one, that's as good a place to start as any.
"If we had our druthers and could tour
with absolutely anyone it would be
Page / Plant and the Stones. So, I guess you
could say we have our druthers."
The Hip are definitely a live band. Rather
than touring to generate sales for an
album, they generate albums for the
chance to tour. And what they play is never
static. A live concert is a chance to experi
ment, in lest the boundaries of a song and to
make it new each time it is played.
"It used to be that the album was in second
position to being able to perform live," said
Baker. "Now they have grown into a symbi
otic relationship. We've never been a band
who tours to support our albums."
Baker says the band's "live versions (are) a
lot better than studio versions. We only play
songs that continue to grow. We also don't
care whether it's a radio song or whatever.
What matters is whether a song continues to
get better as we play it. When it gets fixed we
either rest it or forget it."
This is a bold stance to take in a music
world where hit singles are the determining
factor in concert attendance. If you don't
cater to the MTV generation, it's difficult to
make it big.

But though the Hip don't dwell on radio
play they certainly get it. They have fathered
such familiar songs as "New Orleans is Sink
ing," "Fully Completely," "Locked in the
Trunk of a Car," "At the Hundredth Meridi
an" and "Grace Too."
That's quite an accomplishment for a
young hand with four full-length records.
But this is fortune accidental. According to
Baker, the Hip have "never seen (themselves]
as a hit singles hand."
"I hardly listen to the radio. It's not a
major concern in our life," Baker said. "But
it's hard not to get pigeon holed, especially in
America where business is moved by hit sin
gles."
"Fully Completely," the band's third LP
was sold state-side as "hit" material, a move
that caused the band enough angst to switch
to Atlantic.
"It was marketed more in singles fashion.
They really went after classic rock radio and
wacky promotions. With beer cozies and
Frisbees. We were kind of put out by it and
disillusioned," Baker said in a wry tone of

voice.
Part of the problem the Hip have with the
one-hit wonder phenomena is that it forbids
experimentation.
"1 think that an album can never really
document where the hand is at that particu
lar time," Baker declared. "If we went in and
recorded these songs today, they would be
better than they are on album. We don't go
into the studio with tactic of'that formula re
ally worked,' or 'we need more radio play....'
"In the early days, someone would bring
semi-finished songs to band. Now, it's al
ways five of us sitting around. 1 have a riff,
and off it goes. The blocks we build songs
out of are getting smaller and smaller, and I
think this gives us a much more unique sort
of sound."
According to Baker, sitting around writing
songs together is never the same experience
twice.
"The shortest amount of time it has ever
taken us to write a song is probably five min
utes. The longest it has ever taken... well,
there are tunes out there we've been ham-

mering away at for the last five or six
years," Baker said. "You're not satis-
fied and leave it alone for a few
months or year. You can slog away
in vain for hours and weeks on some
songs. And even though all the time
and effort you put into it may feel
wasted at the time, it enables you to

write other songs in five minutes.
(Writing quickly is] not like being
struck by lightening, even though
it may feel like it."

But what is like being
struck by lightning
for the Hip is per
forming. Not only does
their stage presence magni
fy the music they play, but
the band members display

intense energy that defies their

hectic tour schedule.
While recently they have scaled
down their touring to three weeks on
the road and one week at home, they

once played 250 to 300 dates a year when
starting out 10 years ago.
"Every album we've done, stuff

we've written on the road has been a large
basis of it, even though it's not until we get

time off the road that we get anything
done. We just had some few days off and did
some studio work. Did seven songs toward
next effort," Baker said matter-of-factly, as il
"Day for Night" hadn't just come out last
year.
The band used to tour for a year, take one
month off, and then jump back into record
ing. But, when they got back into the studio,
they found that a four-week vacation had
drawbacks.
"You totally change directions and be
come more introspective when you take time
off. Incorporating studio work into road
time will continue to be a good thing tor the
band."
Besides the atmosphere of the road, the
Hip incorporate into their song writ
ing the element of visual stimulation.
While working on "Day for Night," Baker, an
art school graduate, went to local artists and
asked them for slides of their work.
"When we went into the studio we pro
jected the images while playing, if anything
struck us we went with it," Baker said.
Interestingly, Baker says his favorite artist
is former Stanford Prof. Nathan Oliveira.
"We were talking about using some
Nathan Oliveira art for our last record cover,
but in the end it didn't seem to suit the
music," Baker said.
Coming up with a visual abbreviation for
the Hip is a difficult task, considering the
complexity of their songs
As Baker said, "a song is a poem. It's sup
posed to stimulate you."
And stimulate the Hip do. Some day soon
their popularity in the States will rise to what
it is internationally, but until then their con
certs will be, in the words of Baker, an exer
cise in "preaching to the unconverted."
