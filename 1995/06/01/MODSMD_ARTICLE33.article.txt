# Anka Radakovich's wild ride
## Details columnist turned author is sitting pretty 
### 
Story and graphic by Julie Tsai

With a virile sexual curiosity and the
face of a doll, writer and vamp
Anka Radakovich is cheerfully
forging new and questionable frontiers in in
vestigative journalism.
With last month's publication of "The
Wild Girls Club: Tales From Below the Belt,"
a compilation of her Details magazine
columns, Radakovich is sitting pretty with a
contract from Paramount Pictures to write

"Thc Wild Girls Club" screenplay.
Though she has a literature and
fine arts pedigree from University

of Maryland, Radakovich's style
is more akin to Madonna than
more sedate journalists Anna
Quindlen or Pauline Kael. Atop the
cover of "The Wild Girls Club"

Radakovich gazes archly at the reader,
matte red mouth slightly agape. In a
spandex overflowing halter top, She
projects the allure of the slightly inacces
sible wild eirl.

(Nearly Radakovich, who says she's been
fired from every job she held before coming
to the men's magazine five years ago, has
found a niche with Details' predominantly
male readership for her irreverent raci
ness.

"When (Details owner S. I.) New
house called me, I thought Tm going to
get fired,' " Radakovich confesses with
the throaty bluntness of a New York

bohemian. "But he said, 'I want you
to write a book.' "
Quite a pleasant turn of events
for Radakovich, who logically
suggested creating a book with

a collection of her columns. Through
"The Wild Girls Club"and her growing read
ership from Details, Radakovich's career is
poised to take off, for better or for worse.
Articulate, boisterous and always quip
ready, Radakovich says she's having a blast:
"Work is fun. It's a dirty job, but someone's
got to do it."
Wit to burn
Expounding on the humorous and scan
dalous sides of sex and relationships, Anka's
tongue-in-cheek narratives often sound like
the internal monologue of a woman who
might think like a Details man.
Her chapter titles — "Poles Apart: A Hard
Look at Penises," "My Camcorder, My Self:
Video Head," "Lip Service: On Being a Cun
ning Linguist" — are designed to make you
squirm.
"Becoming pussywhipped is a gradual
process," Radakovich writes blithely in a
chapter entitled "Whip it Good." "A pre-PW
man would brag to his pals about former con
quests and rate women solely on their endow-

ments. Post-
PW, things
are differ
ent. ... Sud
denly, he is

Mr. Po
lite,

and
tradi
tion-

al male group
behavior like
swearing,

burping and
farting comes to a
halt."
If Anka's themes

shy away from any
thing, it is the concept
that sexuality might be
taboo. In the book,
Radakovich unabashedly
describes the results of her

experimentation with love
drugs with a "potency volun
teer." Like fellow advocate Madonna,
Radakovich venerates sex only with her pub
lic fascination of its many permutations, not
with adherence to standards of propriety.
"Some Americans are so uptight about
sex," Radakovich shoots back. "I'm just trying
to look at the goofier side of sex. It's ridicu
lous! It looks ridiculous; it smells ridiculous;
it sounds ridiculous...."

But one thing Radakovich does stray away
from is lesbianism.
"We do have a contingency of lesbian read
ers," Radakovich says."The only reason 1
don't write about lesbianism is because I
don't know too much about the lesbian
world."
Radakovich admits that being promoted
as Details' self-styled spokeswoman for
slacker sexuality carries its own vagaries
and pitfalls. Even though Radakovich
claims she's "not trying to teach any

body anything," it's too easy for us
media types to label her as sexpert.

"I just did this innocently,"
Rad akovich

says, deny
ing any
visions

of
icon -
dom when she

started the job. "I
just stick with psychology

and biology and try to entertain
the readers."

So Radakovich wants to redefine the
role of the sex columnist; she says she sees her
self more as a public affairs correspondent.
"I'm talking about men, women and sex —
and thinking about it as a writer, not a jour
nalist, by getting in the trenches myself," she
adds. Though Radakovich clearly enjoys the
ride, she has no stated ambitions to be the li
bidinous voice of media-created Gen-Xers.
"I hate it when I'm called Dr. Ruth...."
Radakovich sighs. "I never thought I'd be a
sex columnist, but I guess I'm kind of stuck

with the sex columnist title.
"Actually, 1 think I prefer 'sexy colum
nist.' "
On the job
In five years of writing with a metamorph
ing Details, Radakovich'scolumn has evolved.
"The column has become more depraved,"
Radakovich says, laughing. "The first thing I
wrote, the bachelor pad piece, it almost seems
innocent to me. Now there's more, like, ad
ventures.
"Like when 1 dressed up as a man for two
days. 1 went to a strip club, a gay bar. 1 watched
a couple of blow jobs — it was fun." But
Radakovich laments that Details cut "the best
parts of [the story]."
Also as part of research for her column,
Radakovich found herself attending a
swingers' convention. "1 find orgies hilari
ous," she says. "I'm here taking notes while
eight people are humping in the corner. I'll go
to things most people would think are per
verted and try to find the humor."
For all its titillation, Radakovich says she
constantly gives her new insights.
"When I decided to dress up as a man in
order to research gay bars, I thought I'd be this
hunky Details man, but I was this unattractive
man." Radakovich says good-naturedly. "I
found out that as an unattractive man, no
body will talk to you."
Radakovich notes that the issues raised up
in her research are intellectually stimulating:

/
"When I attended that swingers' conven
tion, it throws up all these issues of love,

fidelity and sex." While it's unclear what
conclusions she draws from these

not-so-intimate situations, it surely
makes an interesting study for
Radakovich.

I for job has also had side-ef
fects on Radakovich's dat
ing life.
"There's usually

one of two reactions,"
Radakovich says.
"They're either
afraid that I'm
going to put
them in a col
umn, or they
think I'm a big

po* 3 sex ex
pert....
"They think be

cause I joke about it, I'm re

?v*° v ° ally good at it, which I am,"
Radakovich adds, partly in jest.

And what do her parents think of all this?
"My parents joke they'll join the witness
protection program," Radakovich says. "Ac
tually, they're very liberal and permissive.
We'll talk about anything."
Overall, Radakovich is comfortable
with where she is in her career.
In fact, she is very encouraging about pur
suing the unpredictable path of a writer's ca
reer.
"If it's what you want, go after it and work
hard," Radakovich urges. "I always wanted to
break into movies, but I never knew you
could through writing columns."
Nope, any quasi-pretentious existential
crises about art are tightly under wraps here.
"I love men," Anka Radakovich says firm
ly. "I couldn't do this if I didn't."
