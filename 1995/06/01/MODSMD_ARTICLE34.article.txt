# Searching for 10ve... in the remains

Anybody who goes to see Brad Fraser's "Umden -
tilled Human Remains and the Nature of True
Love' because it won the London Hvening Stan

dard Award for Best Play, or because it was so good that M

a movie version is in the works or simply becausc
Fraser is supposed to be one of Canada's leading
playwrights, will be sorely disappointed.
The West ( 'oast premiere of this erotic thriller,
while obnoxious in its own right, is simply a visu- J

al explanation of why the script itself is so
bad. First, the plav is set in the cultural
wasteland of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in
the late '80s. Instead of using his creative li
cense to rectify this original mistake, direc
tor Peter Glazer exacerbates the problem
with his costume and sound design choices.
By putting the actors by turns in neon and
tight yet ill-fitting regalia, and by playing
tracks like Wang Chung's "Everybody Have
Fun Tonight" under the action, Glazer
makes one statement and one statement
only: the '80s should never have happened.
"Skin, blood, breasts, legs" are among
the litany of terms uttered into darkness at
the opening of the play. We quickly learn

that there have been a rash of rape murders in the area and
that the local RCMP haven't been able to catch the culprit.
David (David Arrow), a pretentious young gay male waiter by
day and prostitute by night, and Candy (Delia MacDougal),
his equally pretentious straight roommate are the central
characters in this who-done-it intrigue.
Of course Candy and David have problems. Candy hates
her body, is a compuUh'e dieter and exerciser and can never
seem to find the right man. David has sex with any man that
moves and doesn't believe in love at all. Rounding out the cast

Robert and Jerri, two people lusting after Candy. These fig
ures into the lives of our protagonists in order
to escalate nie dramatic tension.

Bernie keeps stumbling into David's place late at ntgH?
with blood on his face. Claiming that he's been in a fightjjtki
that he's too drunk to go home to his wife, he always ends Up
sleeping over. Candy can't stand the guy and we soon fincLout
why: when they were both younger, her good friend commit
ted suicide after Bernie got her pregnant and refused to take
Kane, a rkfr kid who works as a bus boy for fun, meets
David and quickly develops a crush on him which is not real
ly a Crush because he's "not like that." The two play video
games, eat p&zfttmd share some of the most tender sequences
in the entire pi#. Jerri, the geeky lesbian who works out at

Candy's gym, develops a crush on her. Candy flippantly de
cides to go out with her and the date, which begins awkward
ly, ends happily with oral sex. But of course (>andy can't han
dle it — she's not that way either — so sooner than you can
say straight, she bed's down the nearest male bartender and
decides she's in love.
As written these characters are self-centered to the point ot
being annoying. As directed, however, they are downright de
testable. Each actor creates a caricature rather than a charac
ter leaving little for the audience to care about. Again, the di
rector decided to trade nuance for tacky and trite, deepening
the emotional vacuum left by the author.
To top things off, Glazer's production is a very fleshy one.
Candy, who sleeps with both Jerri and Robert, spends a good
portion of her stage time naked on a bed. You can't help but
feel sorry for the poor woman as she disrobes for the nth
time. Fortunately, Glazer is an equal opportunity exhibition
ist, and whether its Kane dropping his pants, or Benita pop
ping out oilier scanty attire, useless nudity is simply par for
the course.
Eager to prove that he run play with the big bovs down
south, Fraser has written a decidedly American drama. And
complete with the requisite ingredients of sex, violence and
mains" would be pursued for film For those who want
something more out of their San Francisco theater... keep
searching.
