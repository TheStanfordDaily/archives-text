## Focus on: La Roca 
### Teri Stein 
Children growing up in Los Angeles are
weaned on Mexican food. We teeth on tor
tilla chips and soft tacos and quesadillas.
Each Los Angeleno will boast of her own
hole-in-the-wall discovery, a restaurant
where more Spanish than English is spoken
and the recipes of los padres have been lov
ingly prepared for years. These little havens
are usually found in strip malls near Laun
dromats and video stores and are rarely
found outside the borders of our native city.
Happily, the transplanted Angeleno and
all other seekers of the genuine artifact can
delight in the cheap and delicious food at La
Roca. A far cry from the wood polishings and
leafy plants and piped-in mariachi music of
Compadres, La Roca looks like a real Mexi
can restaurant. Located in the Northern Cal
ifornia version of a mini-mall with only a
handful of plastic tables for the customers
and a television tuned to Spanish soap operas
for entertainment, La Roca promises to be
free of pretension, a restaurant where food is

the only possible draw.
And what a draw it is. "Yummy, yummy,
yummy," proclaims four-year old friend M.
And although her four older chaperones
have a combined 61 years of schooling, we
are unable to come up with a better descrip
tion for the wonderful platters set in front of
us. We had a difficult time even deciding
what to order. It was not helpful that the man
at the table next to us leaned over and whis
pered conspiratorially, "Everything's great
here." The menu boasts an incredibly wide
array of choices, including typical fare like
tacos with unusual native meats such as bir
ria (goat's meat) and letigue{tongue). For the
less adventurous, the menu is also stocked
with the more traditional beef, chicken and
vegetarian options.
And what's more, the food is deliciously
affordable. The enchiladas verdes ($7.95) ar
rive with creamy green sauce drizzled over
melting jack cheese and include generous
helpings of rice and beans. The polio en mole
($7.25) is prepared so tenderly that the chick
en meat falls off the bone with just the slight
est touch of a fork. The best deal on the menu
may be the vegetarian burrito ($3.25), which
comes with rice, beans, salad, guacamole and
sour cream and easily serves two. However, a
case for the soft tacos can easily be made; at
$1.75, they come topped with fresh vegeta
bles and a choice of meat from chicken to
goat. There are no vegetarian soft tacos, al
though the crispy taquitos ($6.25 for a platter
of three) are entirely meat free. Of course, all
meals are prefaced by baskets of warm tortilla
chips and four kinds of salsa, three of which
are hot enough to satisfy our table's spice
queen, who found the green sauce doing
wonderful things for her tongue.
Another feature which distinguishes the
La Roca menu is its prominent use of

seafood. All of the shrimp entrees are avail
able for under $10 and use fresh prawns,
topped with hot red sauce in Camarones a la
Diabla or served ranchero-style with sauteed
vegetables. Equally affordable red snapper
filets are fried or served with vegetables and
ranchero sauce. Unfortunately, they do not
yet feature the fish taco, a specialty dear to
southern Californians, which is slowly me
andering its way up the coast.
A cautionary note for dining at La Roca:
Bring along a Spanish speaker. Owner Maria
Eugenia Arias will be happy to wait on your
table, and it is helpful to have someone along
who can relay complicated orders in her native
language. As an additional warning, be pre

pared to sit at high tables; only M., who still fits
a booster seat, actually sat level with her food.
La Roca is also open for breakfast and with
only the few tables available, be prepared to
wait on weekends. It's worth it. It may not be
home, but it's close.
