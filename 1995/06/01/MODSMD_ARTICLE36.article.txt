# On goth rock, mysticism and why he doesn't want to be a dolphin
## The
						philosophy of Peter Murphy 
### Elisabeth Morse graphics by Peter Lagerquist 
I had been duly warned that Peter Murphy
was an erudite, polite, nice ex-goth. His
new album, "Cascade," certainly indicat
ed intelligence and talent, as does most of
Murphy's work, from Bauhaus to Dali's Car
to his solo projects. Murphy, once known for
creating the gothic, waifish style involving
pale skin, black clothing, a morbid, druggy
attitude and a contorted willowy bending
backwards-and-fowards dance, had suppos
edly reformed into someone content and
family-oriented. Yet, I was unprepared for a
talk which touched on topics of philosophy,
aesthetics and love amidst a crackling phone
line to the middle east. Murphv seemed to
question me as much as I questioned him,
starting our talk with a line of his own in
quiries. During the half hour in which we
chatted, I felt sheepish asking pre-bottled in
terview questions to someone so human and
personable.
History: Personal
Murphy: What are you studying?
KM: Art history and philosophy. So, you
arc in Turkey?
Murphy: Yes, I'm in Turkey. Where are
you in your philosophy course? What realm
of it have you visited recently?
EM: Mostly philosophy of mind, lately.
Murphy: That's quite fascinating, actually,
that your courses are art history and philoso
phy. Arc they linked, formally at all, in terms
of the courses?
EM: Not often. There are a few courses in
aesthetics, but usually the subjects are pretty

separate. Where in Turkey are you, exactly?
Murphy: I'm in Ankara, which is the cap
ital. It's on the Anatolic Plateau, and it's set
about in the area of the world where just
about every single civilization has touched,
where most of the world's civilization is
linked on. They call it the old land and they
say that wherever you step, you are either
stepping on a saint or a, um, very sort of won
derful person.
EM: How long have you been in Turkey?
Murphy: I've been here since 1992.
EM: Do you like it?
Murphy: Yes, very much.
EM: How is it different from living in the
"West?"
Murphy: One of the contrasts that you get,
one of the perspectives you get living here is
that it's not different from London. Or that
it's different from the west so that it leaves
you less conscious of the difference between
London / Ankara or Istanbul / L.A., or what
ever. So, for me, it is really virtually the mid
dle point between east and west — geograph
ically, culturally. And it is fascinating.
Hut it is a very warm, very welcoming
country. It's very sort of Middle Eastern in
that sense. It's an Islamic country, but one of
those countries which has not gotten that
hard-line interpretation of the Islamic law.
It's a very liberal Islamic country, it's refresh
ing. And in my experience living here, to see
how Islam is perceived by the west, of course,
is generally through the hard-line politics of
a state such as Iran, who are really the most

/I/ \r r high

i J Islamic ex-
I pressionists. I
think it's all very
right wing, if you like,
politically motivated
much of the time.
Religion, Relation
ships, Rugrats
EM: I believe 1 once read
that you were interested in
Eastern religion. Are you
still?
Murphy: Yeah, I'm inter
ested, always. I'm always
looking for the source, re
ally. I'm very interested in
what is a baby in the bath
water, ifyou like. Definite
ly. You come through a lot
of'it's such and such,
112 and such'and I'm sure
you'll get a sense of
that in philoso
phy, but there
112 L has to be a real
ity, some-
AVI where.

your perceptions? \m
Murphy: Not necessarily,
no. I think our own perceptions, our own
states, are really colored by our own actions.
Of course, [my children] do heighten a
very pure sense of responsibility, like an in
stinctive responding to another human
being, and that is involuntary to begin with.
Yes, | having children] sort of gives you more
a sense of what altruism is, what uncondi
tional love is and unconditional commit
ment. Definitely, they are teaching me about
that.
EM: There seem to be a lot of songs about
commitment, or lack of it, on the new album.
Where do you come up with ideas for lyrics?
Murphy: The ideas come from a very ab
stract space, really. In a way, I have always, I
suppose, gotten the sense that I am abstract
from other people saying that I am abstract.
But you know, it is a quite sensible way of
writing. You know, to be specific and to gen
eralize quickly.
"Mirror to My Woman's Mind" is that
idea of mirror, of what we choose. Firstly, it is
a love song. To start, I thought, "Okay, I'm
going to write around the moment I met...
that two people meet." And it's that meeting
that is really part of the choice. In other
words, that yes, I have met the person that I
want to be with. And the idea of what is that
interaction, the idea that we are attracted to
our partners by we ourselves, that we see an
other part of ourselves, mirrored, if you like

— a part that we maybe couldn't see.... Your
ego says "My God, you have committed to
this relationship," and tries its best to find
reasons not to, and that process is sort of like
a war, if you like. But actually, at the heart of
it, it's a constant certainty.
Now, where that certainty comes from is
interesting. What is it about that person that
you are finding attraction for? What is that?
And you see that if you are honest with your
self, that often there are things you see that
you don't like in the other person which are
actually things that you don't like in yourself.
So there is this that leads you to that mirror
idea, that reflective idea, of how at that point
there is actually an affirming quality to that
perception. You find that that often offers
brilliant potential and possibilities.
EM: So what does "Huuvola" mean?
Murphy: The song is written to my chil
dren. It's simply a connection of the vowel
sounds that are contained within my chil
dren's names.
Gothic? What's that?
EM: When you played in San Francisco at
the Warfield a few years ago, you said that
there is no such thing as "the gothic scene.
Murphy: Maybe I was wrong.
EM: Were you?
Murphy: I don't know. You tell me. 1
mean, I sort of listen to people saying there
are "gothics" and all these "gothic" bands,
and 1 say, "Well, where are they?" You know,
"Could you send me a tape, please?" And ac
tually, one journalist talked me up on the idea
and is actually sending a selection of gothic
bands. So then I'll be able to tell you what
[the gothic scene] is like and whether there is
one once 1 get that. But otherwise, I'm not
quite sure that there is. If you tell me what
you think "gothic" is, I can then answer.
EM: I don't know. It can be so broadly de
fined. Music and style? The"I wear black he
cause I'm so depressed" attitude?
Murphy: I don't think my music is actual
ly depressing. Certainly not to the listener,
but it's certainly not depressed from the point
of view of writing. I think there is a yearning
quality, and a searching quality, lyrically and
subject-wise. There are subject matters
which are sort of depressing, but its about
opening up to different ideas with subject
matter.
Gothic. Gothic. You know. Mary Shelley is
gothic. And that whole sort of literature was
really designed quite playfully to leave you
feeling uneasy and troubled. It's just like a
fantasy-horror trip. It's dark. But what's
dark? Most of the gothic bands that I hear are
all quite dark. I don't know quite what to say
about it, actually.
EM: There have been so many Bauhaus
imitators lately.
Murphy: I'm lost on that one.

EM: This is kind of a trite question, but I
recently saw "The Hunger." There is that
monkey-merger scene at the beginning, and
I was curious what type of animal you might
choose to be.
Murphy: Animal? Oh. Let's see. Well, 1
love dolphins, but I don't know whether I
would want to be a dolphin. Animals? I don't
know really. You know, I don't find it really
an attractive prospect to be an animal. I'd
rather be a human any day.
Ego-centricity and mirrors, again
EM: I low would you describe the real you,
the one which isn't the pretense, isn't just the
musician who is put forth?
Murphy: Well, the real me is to be discov
ered. You know, we have got preconceptions
of ourselves and I think it is a constant work
towards discovering your real self and I think
that at that point.. . that is what draws me to
Hinduism and the arts. You know, because it
is essentially trying to define yourself. Trying
to see a mirror of yourself in your work. And
that is not damaging. 1 don't mean it in a
purely self-obsessed tense. I don't know what
my real self is. Once I know that I'll probably
be content.
I mean, one of the things about having
children is that it wonderfully de-focuses you
on [aspects of] yourself that are quite nega
tive or destructive. It distracts you and gives
you that altruistic service, so that you are dis
tracted nicely, in a very healthy way, from
your own needs to the needs of others. That
can be another direct but unexpected way of
discovering aspects of yourself.
Then again, too much self-consciousness
can lead to gross ego-centricity. I'm not too
self-obsessed. In the past, I've been very care
ful about my image, the way that I am pre
sented. I am getting less attached to that now.
EM: Detached from your image?
Murphy: It isn't important. What is im
portant is the quality and intention of your
work, and that is a loaded area, too. But the
intention to make your work [the best] pos
sible. I mean, my work is not a catharsis any
more. My music isn't troubled music. It isn't
lucked up. That may not be attractive to an
audience, and if not, well then, I'll be a lemon
seller. Do you know what I mean?
EM: What other types of arts, besides
music, are you interested in?
Murphy: I like painting, my own painting,
I paint. But I can see through most of it, real
ly. It's still transitory. It will all fade. Nothing
is permanent. Its not something I take seri
ously.
[Art] is something that could reflect, if
you like, and give you inspiration. But it's
only a device for that sense of the real. Other
wise, it's just sort of a series of images that are
just sort of random. Music is sort of like that.
It's one of the things I try to invest in my

music, some sort of integrity. It's very nebu
litive, not something you can rationalize.
Music sort of takes you to a space that is vis
ceral but connects. And my part is that ratio
nal center, if you like, that mental activity.
And so does art do that.
You know, I've seen a sculpture that I've
actually tangibly fallen in love with it, I've
been affected by it. Now obviously that
sculpture itself is not able to do that, it is
something that I relate to, that I possess, that
is awakened in that moment. So that art is
just a reminder of something else, if you like.
So, I mean, anything can do that, like a child's
eyes or a nice motor car or a good sunset or
somebody dying in your arms, or whatever. 1
mean, everything is art in that sense.
Career Possibilities
EM: Where do you see yourself in 10
years? What would you like to be doing?
Murphy: I have no idea. No idea.
EM: Do you believe you'll still be writing
music?
Murphy: Probably. If I've got the chance
to and the opportunity to, then yes. It may
well end. I don't know.

Who knows? I might be dead? I might be act
ing, I might be sweeping to the roads.
KM: You don't like to look to the future?
Murphy: No. (Even] if I were linked with*
a regular job, I still couldn't tell. 1 think a ca
reer is kind of an economic major. The econ
omy system of every major country is on
quite shaky ground anyways.... With most
people, they don't know what they will be
doing anyways. Who knows? Maybe I'll be
sweeping the roads. As long as I'm alive and
happy and fine and able tt> provide for my
family while they're growmu up.... That
worry (of being able to provide, is actually
very real.
EM: Does being a musician give you any
happiness?
Murphy: Yes, it's enjoyable. It's something
that I need to get my head down to and con
centrate and do. Yes, I do enjoy making
music. It offers a good opportunity, there is
such a wide scope there, such a wide pallet.
Also making videos. You can make anything
out of it, anything is possible. You can make
anything out of nothing. It's being in the cre
ative arts really, and that always offers a lot of
potential.
Hut you know, in a very practical way,
[being a musician] is largely acting as much
as anything else. It does border on pretend,
often. And you've got to start to find out
about not being too self-indulgent. You can
become very very spoiled if you become too
indulgent and lose touch with what is real
and a practical reality.

'<.1 v. I'm
EM: Is there anything else you'd like to say
about the new album?
Murphy: Yeah. The album really has very
eclectic songs. It's a very cool album. It's
something I listen to and think "This works,
I'm enjoying it'" It's very beautiful in its con
tent. I don't know.
My album. What do I say about it? Some
body else should say it. I can't talk about my
album and say it's sort of wonderful or bad or
good or whatever. But I'm happy with it. I
like it. You know, I think I'm singing good
and the songs worked out great. There's a lot
of different colors on it, a lot of different
moods, it doesn't get stuck on one style.
There is a lot of variety there which is very
versatile. I'm just very pleased that I am able
to do this still and make songs and be free
with what I do. It's not rock and roll, but it
works really well.
