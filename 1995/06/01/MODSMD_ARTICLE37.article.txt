## AÃ¯da Croal MASTA ACE INCORPORATED Sittin' on Chrome 
### 
As an MC, Masta Ace has always been an
originator. While the schizophrenic verbal
ventriloquism of "Me & the Biz," testified to
his unique approach, "Take A Look Around,"
his Cold Chillin' debut, let N.Y. MCs know
that brother had something to say.
Even though Masta Ace honed his
rhyming skills with the best, like most New
York rappers, his music was destined to cir
culate only among a narrow pool of loyal

local fans. Talented
and highly improvi
sational, the
Brownsville, Brook-

lyn native spent several years spitting out
some of the best metaphorical lyrics around
in relative obscurity.
Then, taking gangsta rap to task years be
fore his counterparts did, Masta Ace released
"Slaughtahouse" on Delicious Vinyl records.
It was brilliant, but it still wasn't enough.
Then came the remix of Brooklyn classic,
"Jeep Ass Niguh." Spiking it with West
Coast beats, and spontaneously slapping it
onto the end of a demo tape, Ace managed
to get the new cut onto "Slaughtahouse."
Making his way out West and eventually to
the top of radio charts, Masta Ace was born
again with "Born to Roll."
