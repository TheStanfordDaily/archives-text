# Masta Ace strikes again
## 
### 
If New York heads hated him for selling
out to West Coast rhythms on "Born to
Roll," they will certainly despise "Sittin' on
Chrome," Ace's newest release. Musically
strong, this album flexes his formerly latent
production skills. The evocative use of sam
ples like the Isely Brothers' "For the Love of
You" and the funky old skool compositions
permeate the album creating new, dance
oriented aesthetic.
Unfortunately, Ace drops his lyrical
guard in the process and the result isn't
pretty. While some of the tracks might be
more accessible than usual, many of them
are cotton candy to meticulously substan
tive lyrics of the past. Lazy references to the
INC occur much too frequently as do hook
heavy choruses.

In a rare flashback on "People in my
Hood" however, Ace delivers the verbal play
that originally distinguished him on the
New York training grounds. Incisively sum
marizing the conditions of inner city streets,
he raps, "10,000 bullets, 5000 guns / 5000
triggers, 1000 sons / 800 mothers, 10 mil
lion tears / 1200 caskets, 4 million beers..."
Lyrical gems like these are the exception
and not the rule. But if commercialism is
the objective, Ace's pared down strategy is
right on. You can't fault a brother for
wanting to get paid, especially after inno
vating in obscurity for so long. Let's just
hope that "Sittin' on Chrome" pays off and
Ace finds a way to incorporate into his new
music style what he is best known for —
rapping his ass off.
