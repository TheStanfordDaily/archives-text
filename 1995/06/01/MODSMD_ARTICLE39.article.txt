# 18TH DYE
## Tribute to a Bus YO LA TENGO Electr-o-pura 
### 
Euro-export 18th Dye speaks the lingua
franca of the distorted guitar and, in return,
the fuzz-and-buzz racket says everything
that needs to be said about this Dane-Dane-
Kraut trio. You could say the group puts up
one fierce wall o' noise — but walls are
meant to keep you out, whereas 18th Dye's
"Tribute to a Bus" draws you in.
The cracks are what makes the band's
foundation strong. While much of it is dense
and weighty, "Tribute to a Bus" never threat
ens to suffocate its listener. Maybe pull one
under for a bit, but in a thrilling, head-rush
sorta way. Guitarist Sebastian Btittrich pulls
off the clever trick, letting his instrument
drone on — loud or quiet — then slipping
the overdrive into new and captivating di
rections. Like when Btittrich revs up at the
start of "No Time/11" only to let things go
for a smooth ride or when he tweaks jolting
power with surgeon-like delicacy in the riffy

blur of "D." The deliberate repetition of
"Sole Arch"and "Poolhouse Blue" leave one
hanging for the instant that the song breaks
apart, though getting there is at least as in
teresting.
Aptly enough, 18th Dye got its ticket to
the Amer-underground via Yo La Tengo,
who introduced its Teuton counterpart to
home label Matador. Which seems appro
priate, because few bands possess the kind of
deft control over fucked-up noise like the vet
Hoboken husband-wife-bassist trio does.
"Electr-o-pura" sounds the way rich,
heady pop is supposed to, combining ear
opening experimentation with old-fash
ioned charm. On its seventh and newest
album, the band balances lush punkadelia
and bare-bones pop without diluting either
for the sake of the other: There's just some
thing satisfyingly complete in the group's
uncanny mix of neato, tripped-out sounds
and absorbing melody.
"False Alarm" is a junkyard of mellow and
tense, underscored by guitarist / vocalist Ira
Kaplan's scraggly singing and punctuated by
the screeching keyboard of better half Geor
gia Hubley, the team's sometimes singer / al
ways steady drummer. She blurts into the
song, slashing through its rough-hewn tex
ture like a can opener chewing up a metal lid.
On "(Straight Down to the) Bitter End," the
roles are reversed, as Hubley's monotone vox
and wistful lyrics set a melancholy mood
while Kaplan's gravelly guitar rumbles
below.
Lazy things like "Pablo and Andrea" and

"The Ballad of Red Buckets" tone down the
intense moments, beguiling and soothing
with velveteen layers of instruments and
hushed vocals. The straightforward indie
pop of "Tom Courtenay" states best the
band's penchant for both the fresh and the
familiar: With its energetic guitars and ba
ba-ba's in the background, Yo La Tengo
brings the new together with the old into the
now.
