# High food fees: a critical look
## Dining Services says its large budget is for community life 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Editor's note: This story is the sec
ond in a three-part series looking
at the operations of Stanford's

Dining Services.
Tomorrow's article
will focus on Din
ing Services' point
system.
As the price of a
Stanford education
continues to esca
late, students are
asking critical ques
tions about where

their dining fees go and if their
money is being spent efficiently.
With University Dining Ser
vices running on a roughly $16
million annual budget, students
often wonder why board plans
cost as much as they do.
Compared to other schools,
Stanford's Dining Services opera
tions are slightly higher priced,
working with a greater annual
budget and charging students
anywhere between $200 and $500
more each year for a 14-meal per
week plan.
Stanford Dining Services offi
cials defend their costs, however,
by stating that part of their pur
pose is to support the academic
mission of the University by

"building community" during
meals.
A letter from Dining Services
distributed in dining halls at the
start of spring quarter stated that
"this style of service does impact

the cost of student
meal plans in that
[Dining Services]
foregoes the po
tential economies
gained when serv
ing large numbers
of students in
fewer dining loca
tions in favor of a
house-centered
dining experience

in more locations."
The bottom line
For the first time in close to
three years, the total income of
University Dining Services this
fiscal year is expected to exceed
total expenses.
According to Housing and Din
ing Director Keith Guy, this ex
cess revenue will be placed into re
serves which, among other
things, will help cover the debt as
sociated with the Capital Im
provement Program — a 10-year
program aimed at renovating the
major dormitories and residences
on campus.
