# High food fees: a critical look
## Dining Services says its large budget is for community life 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Editor's note: This story is the sec
ond in a three-part series looking
at the operations of Stanford's

Dining Services.
Tomorrow's article
will focus on Din
ing Services' point
system.
As the price of a
Stanford education
continues to esca
late, students are
asking critical ques
tions about where

their dining fees go and if their
money is being spent efficiently.
With University Dining Ser
vices running on a roughly $16
million annual budget, students
often wonder why board plans
cost as much as they do.
Compared to other schools,
Stanford's Dining Services opera
tions are slightly higher priced,
working with a greater annual
budget and charging students
anywhere between $200 and $500
more each year for a 14-meal per
week plan.
Stanford Dining Services offi
cials defend their costs, however,
by stating that part of their pur
pose is to support the academic
mission of the University by

"building community" during
meals.
A letter from Dining Services
distributed in dining halls at the
start of spring quarter stated that
"this style of service does impact

the cost of student
meal plans in that
[Dining Services]
foregoes the po
tential economies
gained when serv
ing large numbers
of students in
fewer dining loca
tions in favor of a
house-centered
dining experience

in more locations."
The bottom line
For the first time in close to
three years, the total income of
University Dining Services this
fiscal year is expected to exceed
total expenses.
According to Housing and Din
ing Director Keith Guy, this ex
cess revenue will be placed into re
serves which, among other
things, will help cover the debt as
sociated with the Capital Im
provement Program — a 10-year
program aimed at renovating the
major dormitories and residences
on campus.

In the past few years, howev
er, Dining Services has tended
to end the budgetary year with a
negative bottom line, with costs
exceeding income by around
$140,000 last year and by as
much as $340,000 in 1993.
"Our target always is to
break even," Guy said, adding
that any profit Dining Services
makes goes into the reserves.
These reserves are part of the
larger Housing and Dining Ser
vices monetary pool which in
part goes into funding the Capi
tal Improvement Program.
Currently, Dining Services is
a self-run, non-profit operation
grouped together administra
tively with Housing Services.
Although governed by Stanford,
Dining Services is self-sufficient
and receives no subsidy or rev
enue from the University. At
the same time, the University
does not use any of the revenue
which Dining Services earns in
its general operating budget.
According to Dining Services
Manager Shirley Everett, Din
ing Services also "supports the
academic mission of the Univer
sity" in part by working with
the administration in setting
the board rates every year.
"The rates are set with the
University in coordination with
other expenses ... in order to
keep the student's overall bud
get down," Everett said.
Currently, board rates are
increased every year at 1 per
cent above inflation to help pay
the debt associated with the
Capital Improvement Program.
This has translated to a roughly
4 percent increase in recent
years in board rates.
In February, the Board of
Trustees approved a 3.8 percent
increase in room and board
rates for the next academic year.
In the year ending August
1993, Dining Services earned
$15.5 million in income from
student board plans, summer
conferences and other sources,
such as catering. The following
year, Dining Services earned
close to $15.7 million.
The projected total income
for this year, including revenue
from summer conferences, is

about $16.3 million.
Although Guy was confident
that this income will meet the
expected costs, he said that it
was hard to determine from year
to year because "student partici
pation in meal programs varies"
over time. "Prediction of student
participation is crucial" in draw
ing up the budget, he added.
According to Everett,
between 3,500 and 3,600 stu
dents are on a board plan this
year, paying anywhere between
$3,163 to $3,567 for either an
all-you-can eat plan or an a la
carte plan. All together, the rev
enue received from students
usually accounts for nearly 80
percent of the total income of
Dining Services, or more than
$12 million.
Summer conferences garner
another $2.5 million annually,
while revenue from other ser
vices, such as catering, makes
up slightly less than $1 million
of the income.
Because Housing and Dining
Services generates its own rev
enue, it is relatively isolated
from the budget-reduction
efforts of the University. Stan
ford is currently in the second
year of a three-year, $18 million
budget-cutting effort.
"The one place that [budget
cutting] can affect Housing and
Dining ... is if the University
decides to restrict the increase
in room and board rates" in
order to increase tuition a little
more, Guy said. "They've done
that a little bit over the years."
Where the money goes
Of the roughly $16 million
that Dining Services operates
with annually, the biggest
expense is labor — which uses 32
percent of the budget, or rough
ly $5.12 million. This expense
includes more than $4 million
for the day-to-day operation of
the dining halls and for the
salaries of full-time staff and
part-time student employees.
Currently, the wage rate for
part-time student hashers runs
at $7.59 per hour. The wage rate
is set by the University and is
raised routinely every year
according to the standard raises
that University staff members
receive.
Approximately 300 to 400
students are employed by Din
ing Services, although the num

ber always varies, Guy said.
All of the full-time employees
— who number more than 100
— are part of United Stanford
Workers, the University's labor
union.
"The wage rates [for the full
time employees] are set by the
University and their contract
with the union," Guy said.
"We're basically told what we
have to pay people."
Another part of the labor cost
includes around $1 million in
salaries for administrative and
clerical employees and around
$1.6 million for employee bene
fits.
Food costs rank a close sec
ond in expenses at around 30 to
31 percent. These food costs
include everything from raw
meat to prepackaged and bottled
items.
According to Guy, Dining
Services bids out several con
tracts to food suppliers in the
area. The four biggest contracts
are for dairy, meat, produce and
general grocery items.
At other schools, food costs
account for a larger percentage
of the budget. At Dartmouth
College, for example, food costs
take up 40 percent of the bud
get, while at Duke, the figure is
around 35 percent.
Other expenses which Dining
Services must meet include debt
service and overhead costs.
General administrative over
head costs — including provi
sions for major repairs, princi
pal payments and interest —
take up 9 percent, or about $1.4
million, of the budget. Supplies
account for another 4 percent,
or around $640,000. Money
spent on supplies covers the
purchase of paper goods, clean
ing supplies, laundry, linen, uni
forms, dishes and silverware.
Both Guy and Everett agreed
that broken and stolen silver
ware is a big problem. "Students
will bring silverware up to their
rooms and forget to bring it
back down," Everett said.
"We go into the rooms at the
end of the year to recover what
we can," Guy said. "Sometimes,
I think some students are trying
to leave Stanford with their own
complete set of dishware. . . .
It's amazing to me how much
silverware we go through."
A 1993 Dining Services statis
tic estimated that Dining Ser

vices purchases nearly 10 pieces
of silverware and a dozen cups
for each student every year.
The comparative picture
At other universities around
the country, dining service oper
ations are also run to break even
with costs similar to Stanford's,
including administrative over
head and maintenance costs.
However, the dining service
budgets at other schools, which
serve roughly the same number
of students, come in slightly
lower than Stanford's budget.
At Dartmouth, around 3,500
students are on some sort of
board plan. Student labor at
Dartmouth comes cheaper at
$5.50 to $6.00 per hour, $2 less
than Stanford student employ
ees.
The food service budget at
the Ivy League school also runs
much less than at Stanford,
operating with $10 million
annually. According to Napoli
tano, a board plan of 14 meals
per week runs around $2,700
per year at Dartmouth.
The dining atmosphere at
Dartmouth, however, is differ
ent. While Stanford Dining Ser
vices has 10 dining halls on cam
pus, the East Coast school has
only five dining locations, three
of which are located in one cen
tral building. The smaller num
ber of facilities to manage, in
addition to the lower salaries for
student employees, may be part
of the reason for the smaller
costs at Dartmouth.
Nearly 3,000 students are on
a board plan at Princeton,
where a 14 meal per week plan
costs $3,062 a year. Like Stan
ford, the dining service opera
tion at Princeton is fully self
sufficient.
Unlike Stanford, however,
Princeton receives income not
only from campus catering,
board plans and cash opera
tions, but also from concessions
and vending booths at certain
sports events.
Stuart Orefice, director of
Dining Services at Princeton,
said he works with an annual
budget of around $15 million,
which is only slightly less than
that of Stanford. Student
employees at Princeton also
make slightly less for their
work, garnering between $6.50
to $7.00 per hour.

to $7.00 per hour.

Dining Services.

system.
As the price of a
Stanford education
continues to esca
late, students are
asking critical ques
tions about where

their dining fees go and if their
money is being spent efficiently.
With University Dining Ser
vices running on a roughly $16
million annual budget, students
often wonder why board plans
cost as much as they do.
Compared to other schools,
Stanford's Dining Services opera
tions are slightly higher priced,
working with a greater annual
budget and charging students
anywhere between $200 and $500
more each year for a 14-meal per
week plan.
Stanford Dining Services offi
cials defend their costs, however,
by stating that part of their pur
pose is to support the academic
mission of the University by

"building community" during
meals.
A letter from Dining Services
distributed in dining halls at the
start of spring quarter stated that
"this style of service does impact

the cost of student
meal plans in that
[Dining Services]
foregoes the po
tential economies
gained when serv
ing large numbers
of students in
fewer dining loca
tions in favor of a
house-centered
dining experience

in more locations."
The bottom line
For the first time in close to
three years, the total income of
University Dining Services this
fiscal year is expected to exceed
total expenses.
According to Housing and Din
ing Director Keith Guy, this ex
cess revenue will be placed into re
serves which, among other
things, will help cover the debt as
sociated with the Capital Im
provement Program — a 10-year
program aimed at renovating the
major dormitories and residences
on campus.

In the past few years, howev
er, Dining Services has tended
to end the budgetary year with a
negative bottom line, with costs
exceeding income by around
$140,000 last year and by as
much as $340,000 in 1993.
"Our target always is to
break even," Guy said, adding
that any profit Dining Services
makes goes into the reserves.
These reserves are part of the
larger Housing and Dining Ser
vices monetary pool which in
part goes into funding the Capi
tal Improvement Program.
Currently, Dining Services is
a self-run, non-profit operation
grouped together administra
tively with Housing Services.
Although governed by Stanford,
Dining Services is self-sufficient
and receives no subsidy or rev
enue from the University. At
the same time, the University
does not use any of the revenue
which Dining Services earns in
its general operating budget.
According to Dining Services
Manager Shirley Everett, Din
ing Services also "supports the
academic mission of the Univer
sity" in part by working with
the administration in setting
the board rates every year.
"The rates are set with the
University in coordination with
other expenses ... in order to
keep the student's overall bud
get down," Everett said.
Currently, board rates are
increased every year at 1 per
cent above inflation to help pay
the debt associated with the
Capital Improvement Program.
This has translated to a roughly
4 percent increase in recent
years in board rates.
In February, the Board of
Trustees approved a 3.8 percent
increase in room and board
rates for the next academic year.
In the year ending August
1993, Dining Services earned
$15.5 million in income from
student board plans, summer
conferences and other sources,
such as catering. The following
year, Dining Services earned
close to $15.7 million.
The projected total income
for this year, including revenue
from summer conferences, is

about $16.3 million.
Although Guy was confident
that this income will meet the
expected costs, he said that it
was hard to determine from year
to year because "student partici
pation in meal programs varies"
over time. "Prediction of student
participation is crucial" in draw
ing up the budget, he added.
According to Everett,
between 3,500 and 3,600 stu
dents are on a board plan this
year, paying anywhere between
$3,163 to $3,567 for either an
all-you-can eat plan or an a la
carte plan. All together, the rev
enue received from students
usually accounts for nearly 80
percent of the total income of
Dining Services, or more than
$12 million.
Summer conferences garner
another $2.5 million annually,
while revenue from other ser
vices, such as catering, makes
up slightly less than $1 million
of the income.
Because Housing and Dining
Services generates its own rev
enue, it is relatively isolated
from the budget-reduction
efforts of the University. Stan
ford is currently in the second
year of a three-year, $18 million
budget-cutting effort.
"The one place that [budget
cutting] can affect Housing and
Dining ... is if the University
decides to restrict the increase
in room and board rates" in
order to increase tuition a little
more, Guy said. "They've done
that a little bit over the years."
Where the money goes
Of the roughly $16 million
that Dining Services operates
with annually, the biggest
expense is labor — which uses 32
percent of the budget, or rough
ly $5.12 million. This expense
includes more than $4 million
for the day-to-day operation of
the dining halls and for the
salaries of full-time staff and
part-time student employees.
Currently, the wage rate for
part-time student hashers runs
at $7.59 per hour. The wage rate
is set by the University and is
raised routinely every year
according to the standard raises
that University staff members
receive.
Approximately 300 to 400
students are employed by Din
ing Services, although the num

ber always varies, Guy said.
All of the full-time employees
— who number more than 100
— are part of United Stanford
Workers, the University's labor
union.
"The wage rates [for the full
time employees] are set by the
University and their contract
with the union," Guy said.
"We're basically told what we
have to pay people."
Another part of the labor cost
includes around $1 million in
salaries for administrative and
clerical employees and around
$1.6 million for employee bene
fits.
Food costs rank a close sec
ond in expenses at around 30 to
31 percent. These food costs
include everything from raw
meat to prepackaged and bottled
items.
According to Guy, Dining
Services bids out several con
tracts to food suppliers in the
area. The four biggest contracts
are for dairy, meat, produce and
general grocery items.
At other schools, food costs
account for a larger percentage
of the budget. At Dartmouth
College, for example, food costs
take up 40 percent of the bud
get, while at Duke, the figure is
around 35 percent.
Other expenses which Dining
Services must meet include debt
service and overhead costs.
General administrative over
head costs — including provi
sions for major repairs, princi
pal payments and interest —
take up 9 percent, or about $1.4
million, of the budget. Supplies
account for another 4 percent,
or around $640,000. Money
spent on supplies covers the
purchase of paper goods, clean
ing supplies, laundry, linen, uni
forms, dishes and silverware.
Both Guy and Everett agreed
that broken and stolen silver
ware is a big problem. "Students
will bring silverware up to their
rooms and forget to bring it
back down," Everett said.
"We go into the rooms at the
end of the year to recover what
we can," Guy said. "Sometimes,
I think some students are trying
to leave Stanford with their own
complete set of dishware. . . .
It's amazing to me how much
silverware we go through."
A 1993 Dining Services statis
tic estimated that Dining Ser

vices purchases nearly 10 pieces
of silverware and a dozen cups
for each student every year.
The comparative picture
At other universities around
the country, dining service oper
ations are also run to break even
with costs similar to Stanford's,
including administrative over
head and maintenance costs.
However, the dining service
budgets at other schools, which
serve roughly the same number
of students, come in slightly
lower than Stanford's budget.
At Dartmouth, around 3,500
students are on some sort of
board plan. Student labor at
Dartmouth comes cheaper at
$5.50 to $6.00 per hour, $2 less
than Stanford student employ
ees.
The food service budget at
the Ivy League school also runs
much less than at Stanford,
operating with $10 million
annually. According to Napoli
tano, a board plan of 14 meals
per week runs around $2,700
per year at Dartmouth.
The dining atmosphere at
Dartmouth, however, is differ
ent. While Stanford Dining Ser
vices has 10 dining halls on cam
pus, the East Coast school has
only five dining locations, three
of which are located in one cen
tral building. The smaller num
ber of facilities to manage, in
addition to the lower salaries for
student employees, may be part
of the reason for the smaller
costs at Dartmouth.
Nearly 3,000 students are on
a board plan at Princeton,
where a 14 meal per week plan
costs $3,062 a year. Like Stan
ford, the dining service opera
tion at Princeton is fully self
sufficient.
Unlike Stanford, however,
Princeton receives income not
only from campus catering,
board plans and cash opera
tions, but also from concessions
and vending booths at certain
sports events.
Stuart Orefice, director of
Dining Services at Princeton,
said he works with an annual
budget of around $15 million,
which is only slightly less than
that of Stanford. Student
employees at Princeton also
make slightly less for their
work, garnering between $6.50
to $7.00 per hour.
