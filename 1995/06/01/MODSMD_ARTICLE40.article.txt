# FRANK ZAPPA
## Civilization, Phase III 
### 
It seems somehow appropriate that,
amidst all the promotional hype surround
ing Rykodisc's re-release of the Frank Zappa
catalogue, "Civilization, Phase III" was qui
etly distributed first by mail-order and then
in stores by the family-owned Barking
Pumpkin Records label. This intensely per
sonal "opera-pantomime," totaling 113
minutes, occupied Zappa for 10 years prior
to his death, and emerges as the definitive
Frank Zappa composition.
Zappa's legacy is distinguished by two
seemingly disparate themes: his bizarre hip
pie-freak humor, epitomized by his early
Mothers of Invention albums, and his seri
ous, unflinching approach to composition
and musicianship. Common to all of Zappa's

music, however, is a disregard for society's
conventional means of self-expression. His
work is so daunting that one book written
about him was titled No Commercial Poten
tial.
"Civilization, Phase III" is no different.
Conceived as an opera (without the
singing), the plot centers loosely on a cast of
characters who — fearful of the world's ex
ternal evils — have retreated inside a piano.
This is about as cohesive as the plot gets, for
as the liner notes say: "Plot continuity is de
rived from a serial rotation of randomly cho
sen words, phrases, and concepts." This is
not Shakespeare, folks.
If you want to understand Frank Zappa
you will have to look to the music. "Civiliza
tion, Phase III" finds Zappa in his familiar
role as the modern classical composer. Un
like your typical composer, however, Zappa
has foregone the imperfections of live musi
cians and instead relied almost entirely on
digital samples.
The result is a precise, almost sterile work.
The music is dense and hard to comprehend,
skipping from the lurching vaudeville of
"Amnerika" to the brooding, ponderous
weight of "N-Lite." But after repeated listens,
the album's structure and beauty emerge,
and frustration turns to pleasure.
When in the last dialogue of this last
Frank Zappa album, two characters con
clude a discussion of music with "I think our
strength comes from our uncertainty. If we
understood it we'd be bored with it and then
we couldn't gather any strength from it," one

can't help but consider this Zappa's chal
lenge to his audience. "Civilization, Phase
III" is not meant to be easily accessible or
understood. You will not be able to dance, or
even hum, to it. And you will likely not be
immediately entertained by it. But if you are
willing to expend some effort, you may well
be rewarded.
