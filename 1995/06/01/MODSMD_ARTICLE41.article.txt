## WINGTIP SLOAT Chewyfoot 
### 
With so many good weird bands and so
many good pop bands, the beauty of Wingtip
Sloat is in their ability to be both, without
committing to either. Not as off-the-wall as
the Thinking Fellers or as purely catchy as
Guided by Voices, Wingtip Sloat manages to
take the best from both worlds, letting
melody and experimentation find a comfort
able equilibrium.
In this way, Sloat's new album
"Chewyfoot" is both instantly appealing and
deeply fascinating, with their weird pop epics
striking the perfect balance between ear
candy and ear-meat-and-potatoes.
Throughout the album, the band explores
loads of musical ideas while maintaining a
coarse prettiness from start to finish.
Since they record on four-track, they're
bound to get stuck with labels like "low-fi"
and "slacker-rock," but Wingtip Sloat are far
too ambitious to be slackers. Their songs ag
gressively reinvent themselves, constantly
shifting speeds, moods and directions, while
still keeping a clear, purposeful flow.
Through all the jolts and transitions,
"Chewyfoot" has a rare cohesiveness that's
rooted in the band's character.
Sung with a squeaky tenderness, "Blowing
chunks in the front seat / of your girlfriend's
parents' car / you're on a trip to the
galaxy / to the galaxy's farthest star" is an
honestly pretty verse, a fitting opening for
the ambiguously fucked-up love song
"Cork." "Eye Has Not Seen," "Slouching To
wards Dulles" and "Arc of a Worm's Trail"
work similar wonders, oozing the twisted
warmth and stubborn independence that are
at the heart of Wingtip Sloat's expression.
As far as simple indie-rock comparisons
go, "Chewyfoot" might recall the personal
charm of the Grifters' "One Sock Missing,"
the instrumental creativity of Slint's "Tweez"
or the schizophrenic leanings of Sebadoh's

"III." But these comparisons should be taken
lightly, as "Chewyfoot" is a stunningly
unique work — one that stands up to, and
apart from, the very best releases of the year.
