# INXS
## Greatest Hits 
### 
It's easy to underestimate INXS.
Although "Kick" was commercially huge
(selling over nine million albums), because
of the album's trendiness many people as
sumed that it would become the band's only
important statement. Further, their next
album, "X,"was simply a lesser imitation of
"Kick," suggesting that the band would de
velop no further.
Unfortunately for INXS, when its popu
larity was relatively small, the group did their
greatest work. "Listen Like Thieves," the
album preceding "Kick" was a rough master
piece, mixing rock's aggression and postur
ing with funk's crunchy beauty and dance
music's instant appeal.
Then, when the music world essentially
forgot INXS as the '90s began, the group did
what no one predicted them to do, releasing
a wildly ambitious album which radically
changed the band's approach to music. "Wel
come To Wherever You Are" came at just the
wrong moment. The band had already lost its
casual fans and many long-time fans were
confused by the new sound. The album,
however, is a hidden gem, jumping fluidly
between multiple music genres, without
straining the music.
Now, after nine studio albums, the band
has finally released a "Greatest Hits" album.
Although falling short of its potential, the
album is a strong testament to the band's
ability.
The two songs from their earliest period,
"The One Thing" and "Original Sin" sound
surprisingly fresh, revealing that INXS had a

firm grip on funk early in their careers.
Even among their greatest hits, "What You
Need" stands out as strong as ever. Truly one
of the greatest songs of the '80s, the track is
nearly perfect. The groove churns, the guitar
snarls, the sax burns, and Hutchence delivers
flawlessly.
The automatic singles form "Kick" and
"X" are still tasty, but the absence of two of
the best tracks from "Welcome To Wherever
You Are" is unfortunate. "Strange Desire"
and "Taste It" are both powerful testaments
to the band's rhythmic and vocal ability. The
two tracks included from that album, "Heav
en Sent" and "Beautiful Girl," pale in com
parison.
Because of the strength of their singles,
INXS is well suited for a greatest hits album.
While not all that it could be, the album is
still an excellent introduction to a band
whose best output hasn't necessarily been its
most commercially successful.
