# TRAGICALLY HIP
## Day for Night 
### 
If there is anything I am not going to say
about the Tragically Hip, it is how sad it is
that they are relatively unknown in America.
Lines like "tragically un-hip" are not only
overused, they are trite to begin with.
This Canadian quintet is über-huge in
their homeland, and with good reason. The
tens of thousands of Canadians who bought
their latest release in the first week couldn't
be wrong.
After releasing a third LP, the hit-ridden
"Fully Completely" (with radio-play tracks
like "At the Hundredth Meridian" and
"Locked in the Trunk of a Car"), the Hip have
returned with "Day for Night." This is a
stronger, more raw collection of songs that
runs nearly an hour with its bare-bones gui
tar and soulful vocals.
Unlike the last album, "Day for Night" is
not a collection of hits, despite the fact that
such tunes as "Grace, too," "So hard done by,"
and "Scared" are ripe for radio play. It has a
harder feel, and one clearly inspired by it's
birth on the road. Guitars are not intention
ally grungy, but neither arc they polished
clean in the studio. They sound just coarse
enough to be live, but very well played.
Having been compared to nearly everyone
at the top of the charts, from the Black Crows
to REM, the Tragically Hip definitely have a
"mainstream alternative" feel to their music,
with just enough of the college sound to ap
peal to twentysomethings, and substantial
maturity and talent to stay in the ring for the
long run.
From the moaning and harsh "Greasy
Jungle," to the smooth, U2-esque "Yawning
or snarling the album is filled with tracks that
vary in style and sound." The finest material
is "Grace, too," the opening song. Classic Hip
in sound, with melodious but understated
acoustic and electric guitar, drawn-out vo
cals, and a grabbing starting line (kinda bit
her lip / geez, I don't know"), this track sucks
the listener in without hesitation or uncer
tainty. Another winner is "Scared," a folksy
blusey ballad that weaves an engaging tale of
human nature, fear and twisted sexuality.
Though most of the tracks sustain a dis

tinct Hip sound, there is variety to the end,
with the next to last track, "Titanic terrari
um," presenting the listener with a piece lay
ered in mandolin and an eerie, aquatic am
biance.
Though this album lacks the distinction to
be a classic, it is a fail-safe introduction to this
band destined to grow more favorable as day
emerges from night.
