## Love Bites 
### 
Although nakedly recking of shameful
repackaging and hardening staleness, Scorpi
ons' "Live Bites" still has a meager flash of
hard-rockin goodness. Unfortunately, these
precious kernels of diamond dignity have
been wantonly buried in a back-alley ruff,
only to be rediscovered by devout Scorpions
chorus-chanters. In a music industry run by
mathematical profit-making calculations and
green machine schemes, the pride factor can
only be analyzed after the turkey has explod
ed. In this scenario, the Perdue has creamed
the kitchen with the ultimate turn-off: cheesy
Velveeta and outgrown leather pants.
Compiling metal mania from the Scorpi
ons' most recent globetrot, "Live Bites"
pastes together rock blasts from arenas in
Mexico City, Leningrad, Munich and San
Francisco. Each powerhouse ditty on this col
lection is fueled by the ecstatic screams of the
last one, creating a motif of uncontrolled hys
teria and raucous hubbub. Unfortunately,
this excitement doesn't rub off so well on
recording, and a casual listen may only disap
point those looking for a quick high.
In a loud and sweaty opener loaded with
glam spice, the Scorpions ensemble opens
with "Tease Me Please Me," a bad-boy sing
along guaranteed to spark even the most
soggy showing. From there, "Live Bites" is a
forward march through some of the band's
most venerated anthems, including "Rhythm
of Love" and "Winds of Change." Newcomers
to the game may be dazzled by the magnetic
charisma that this orb of rock power can dis
play; fans of old may not be so fulfilled.
To help balance the scales of rock justice,
the Scorpions clan felt it fit to temper the ex
cess of rehashed re-runs with some studio
originals. Although wimpy compared to the
robust flex of past Scorpions classics, these
newborns display an energy that may give
crestfallen die-hards something to look for
ward to.
For a metal world furiously fight ing off ac
cusations of bloatedness and teeny-bopper
catering, "Live Bites" can't be called a stellar
defense. But to millions of Scorpions fans
with wallets to show their support, such ac
cusations are entirely non-sequitur.
