## Yuen Ping Low 'FANCI'S PERSUASION': THE WEDDING BANQUET... NOT! 
### 
Billed by its narrator as a "post-apocalyptic inter-species love
story," "Fanci's Persuasion" is set appropriately in the polymor
phous playland that characterizes the alternative twentysomething
subculture of downtown San Francisco. Writer-director Charles
Herman-Wurmfeld demands that all aspirants have cake with
ketchup, or hop into latex and adopt a dominatrix disposition....
It all happens on the pre-nuptial night of Fanci Wiesenthal (Jes

sica Fatton) and her
leather-clad fiancee
Loretta (Boa). Fanci's
bridal gown needs work;

Fanci's
Persuasion

friends arc rehearsing their feline routine to spice up the ceremony;
the Wiesenthals are not pleased when they get invited to their
daughter's same-sex wedding.
Exacerbated by a series of city-wide electrical outages, an emo
tional crisis sets the entire motley crew of characters spiraling down
a labyrinth of libidinous misadventures. The puritanical Wiesen
thals are not spared from the ensuing hedonistic pursuits, either.
Without the convenience ofa central narrative thread in "Fancis
Persuasion," editor Michael Anthony Worrall's role becomes para
mount — he makes deft comic sense out of a loose assortment of re
lated vignettes and set-pieces.

A positively bizarre, but curiously touching situation involves
Loretta, a dildo, and — believe it — Fanci's ex-boyfriend, Sam
(Matthew Stephan), who is in frantic search for a tailor to mend
Fanci's battered wedding dress. Sam makes for quite a sight tearing
down the hills of San Francisco on his motorbike with a mammoth
train of fluttering chiffon behind him — clearly a gentle dig at
decked-out divas on moving vehicles, in the wake of last summer's
rousing event from down under.
A more literate experiment in derivation pays off at the film's close.
Director Herman-Wurmfeld quotes the famous procession sequence
from Rene Clair's 1924 "Entr'acte" to quite sublime effect in setting up
the colorful trail of Fanci's wedding guests and well-wishers.
"Fanci's Persuasion" lives up to its promise of a divine exercise in
toxic postmodern romance from beginning to end. Perhaps, some
fairy tales do come true after all.

Yes.
Perhaps . . .
& Hell, no!
