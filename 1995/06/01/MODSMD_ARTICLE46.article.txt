# NAVA DRAMATIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIA
## 
### 
Gregory Navas latest film, My
Family: Mi Familia," is an ambitious
but rather uneven and melodramat
ic story of a Mexican-American fam
ily living in Los Angeles. At its best,
the film boasts scenes of beautiful
landscapes, pleasant Latin American
music and a range of hardships that
elicit some turgid performances and

Mi Familia

a few moments of emotional depth.
At its weakest, it merely inundates
the viewer with uncompelling fami
ly conflict, undeveloped characters,
and an intrusive narration by Ed
ward James Olmos ("Miami Vice").
The film opens in the 1920s and
quickly depicts the meeting and
marriage between Mexican-born
Jose Sanchez and Maria in Los Ange
les. After a series of disasters, includ
ing Maria's deportation from the
U.S. and her harrowing trek to re
turn there, the film leaps to the late
1950s where Jose and Maria's chil
dren are entering the beginning
stages of adulthood.
Here the film fragments into
episodes that focus on each of the
children and in the process, loses
focus and direction. We watch one
daughter marry, another enter a con
vent, one son become a lawyer, an
other become a writer, another enter
a life of crime and yet another go to
prison and later become a father.
Part of the problem with this
multiple story structure arises from
the lack of focus; each of these seg
ments has no connection to the oth
ers except that it follows a member
of the same family. Thus, the film
sacrifices its potential to tell a devel

oped, and powerful story and in
stead offers character portraits that
fail to achieve significant depth.
The closest the film comes to
finding a dramatic center occurs
when two of its stories interweave.
After the plot has jumped to the
1980s, Jimmy (Jimmy Smits) finds
himself released from prison. At this
time Toni — the nun now turned
wife — convinces him to marry a
stranger who is about to be deported
to El Salvador. This part of the story
lightens the film's overly solemn at
mosphere and also offers a charis
matic performance by Jimmy Smits.

The movie's dominant theme is
the importance of family. At his
daughter's wedding lose delivers a
speech in which he stresses that a
man's greatest riches consist of his
family, iimmy makes a similar real
ization later in the film when he loses
his wife and understands that his son
is all that he truly cares about. In the
end, even though Nava's film suffers
from fragmentation and shallow
characters, he reminds us of the pri
mary place of family in one's life and
the meaning that one can draw from
it.
