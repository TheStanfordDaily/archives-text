# 'LITTLE ODESSA' DEGLAMORIZES THE THUG LIFE
## 
### 
Attracting much justified atten
tion for his first film, 25-year-old
writer-director James Gray has craft
ed a sober gangster flick that's inter
esting less for its depiction of crimi
nal life than for its careful exploration
of the emotionally destructive power
of violence.

Little Odessa

Tim Roth — typecast yet again as
a violent punk — plays Joshua Shapi
ra, an experienced hitman who ap
proaches his work with casual brutal
ity and returns reluctantly to his
hometown of Brighton Beach, a
Russian Jewish enclave, to take on an
other job. There, he finds himself re
opening old emotional wounds with
a family and girlfriend that have long
since subtracted him out of their
lives.
Going against the grain of most
crime films which tend to portray
thuggery as some exhilarating joy
ride where characters occasionally

pause to look cool in between
thrilling gun battles, Gray never ro
manticizes the mafia life. Instead, he
makes it seem prosaic and almost in
cidental to the pace of events in the
story, which never deviates from an
admittedly uniform pace.
Gray focuses on Joshua's rap
prochement with his younger broth
er, father and mother — played by
Edward Furlong, Vanessa Redgrave
and Maximilian Schell, respectively
— with Joshua hoping to keep his fa
milial relations at arms length, at least
until his business trip is over. Of
course, things spiral out of control.
Schell's performance as Arkady
Shapira is probably the most com
pelling and sympathetic of the film,
one that threatens to overwhelm
Roth's. As a father who has lost con
trol of one son and can sense that
he's losing control of the other,
Arkady is a despairing authoritarian,
an old man broken by a crappy job, a
dying wife and a mistress that he
guiltily visits.
Though the performances in"Lit

tie Odessa" are uniformly good, the
film unfortunately gives little sense of
what the characters are actually striv
ing for. Even though Roth spends
many moments during the film with
a troubled look on his face before
erupting into gun-waving outbursts,
it seems his only plans are to knock
off the next guy, get together with an
old flame and move on. Indeed if
there are any moments of regret or in
ternal struggle, they come very late.
Admittedly, Gray strives for a
slice-of-life feel that tends to soften
the problem. A notable disadvantage
of this approach is that though the
characters interact convincingly with
the weight of many years and layered
feeling, it does little to reveal any of
their internal lives.
This said, however, Gray's first
outing as a director is impressive and
encouraging, and there's little doubt
"Little Odessa" will only further his
opportunities to develop his dramat
ic tools.
