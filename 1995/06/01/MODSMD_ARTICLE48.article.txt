# GIBSON BRANDISHES THE CAMERA AND THE SWORD
## 
### 
Mel Gibson gets down and dirty in "Braveheart," pro
ducing, directing and starring as the legendary Scottish
war hero William Wallace. Based on historical events of
the 13th century, screenwriter Randall Wallace blends
fact and fiction into a compellingly savage tale of hero
ism and tragedy, betrayal and true love.

In "Brave
heart," Wallace
returns to his
native Scotland
after many years

Braveheart

to find his people living under the abusive occupying
English forces. When soldiers kill his bride Murron
(Catherine McCormack), Wallace is inspired to lead a
ramshackle yet courageous band of Scots in rebellion.
Against all odds, Wallace and his men vanquish the Eng
lish army, and his stunning victories at Stirling and York
rally nobles and commoners alike to the cause of Scot
tish freedom.

Filmed in Scotland and Ireland, "Braveheart" is a film
of epic proportions. The cinematography is grand, and
the direction absolutely brilliant. Gibson carefully or
chestrates each shoot so the audience is always in the
center of the action, whether that be the revelry of a wed
ding or the chaos of a battle.
The battle scenes are particularly powerful — gory to
an extreme. Not for the weak of stomach, Gibson's
"Braveheart" leaves little to the imagination. Wallace and
his men are savages in battle — their axes and swords
bashing in heads and severing limbs very realistically.
The acting is first-rate as well. Excepting Gibson, most
of the cast are relative unknowns, making "Braveheart"
less a Hollywood film than, say "Rob Roy." Rather, the
cast is primarily British and includes members of Glas
gow's Wallace Clan, giving the film greater authenticity.
McCormack and Angus McFadyen, who plays Robert the
Bruce, give such stellar performances that we will un
doubtedly see them again on the Hollywood silver screen.

However, nothing
does as much for the film as
Gibson's performance. If it
weren't for his trademark
smile that emerges every once
in a while from underneath
face paint and incredible hair
extensions, 1 doubt I'd recog
nize Gibson at all. He sub
merges himself so deeply in
his role that it seems as if Gib
son has been riding horses
and brandishing swords all
his life — he looks damn
good in a kilt, too.
Uncompromising in its por
trayal of life in medieval Scot
land, "Braveheart" makes no
bones about the filth and
brutality of war. While some
may see "Braveheart" as bat
tle-happy, others will appre
ciate it for its rawness and
honesty.
