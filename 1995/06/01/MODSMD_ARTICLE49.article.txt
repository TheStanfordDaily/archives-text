# THE SUN ALSO RISES ON STALIN'S SOVIET EMPIRE
## 
### 
After being virtually overlooked by the general public
this past year (even though it received the Grand Jury
Prize at Cannes) "Burnt by the Sun" is finally emerging
into the light. Poignant, comical, and wonderfully di
rected by Nikita Mikhalkov, this film truly deserves every

Burnt by the
Sun

accolade it receives.
Set in 1936, "Burnt by the Sun" is dedicated to the mil
lions of idealistic communist believers who were "burnt
by the sun" of the Soviet Empire during the Stalinist Ter
ror. The movie's central events transpire on one lazy sum
mer day in the life of Col. Sergei Kotov (Mikhalkov), his
family, aging relatives, and friends. Together they spend
the day at their ancestral country house outside Moscow,
a place filled with proudly displayed photographs, linens,
fine china, and of course, a piano.
One gets the sense that, despite the Revolution, their
lives have not changed much. There is a feeling of im
pending doom, however, when an elderly grandfather
mutters regretfully: "It's the aroma. The taste of life has
vanished."
Sharply contrasting this wistfulness for the "old days"
is Kotov. A hero of the Civil War, a friend of Stalin and a
firm believer in the goodness of communism, Kotov rep
resents the potential for the future. In a moving en

counter with his impish six-year-old daughter Nadia
(Nadia Mikhalkov), he contrasts his rough-bottomed
feet to her small, smooth ones. He remarks that he hopes
to continue building Soviet power so that her feet, along
with all of those belonging to her generation, shall always
remain smooth.
Intimate moments like these echoed the hopes of mil
lions of young Communist idealists. Unfortunately, they
were not to be. An old family friend (Oleg Menchikov),
who once loved and planned to marry Kotov's young
wife, Maroussia (Ingeborga Papkounaite) returns under
mysterious circumstances. Familiarly called Mitia, he .
arrives at the family's gates after the passing of a Pio
neers' Parade honoring Stalin, and his entire visit seems
filled with secrecy. His eventual departure is again
marked by the ominous portrait of Stalin as it blows
freely from a hot air balloon floating over the nearby
wheat fields.
The sequence of communist images throughout the
movie, from the joyful, young pioneers parade in the be
ginning to the useless air raid practice on the lake to the
final looming picture of Stalin perfectly parallels the pro
gression of communist Russia.
"Burnt by the Sun" successfully captures the horror of
the Stalinist Terror and the purging of true believers,
while simultaneously evoking humor and warmth. The
performances by the cast are superb and the directing is
skillful, resulting in a movie masterpiece.
