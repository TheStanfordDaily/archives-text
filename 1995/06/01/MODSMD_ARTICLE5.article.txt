# Moon at noon
## Three students hope for pants-free record 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
Some people rally; some drop
their pants.
At least that's the plan for to
morrow's "Moon at Noon," a half
protest in the Main Quad whose
organizers hope to set a world
record for the most people moon
ing at once.
"Not only will this event show
the world that Stanford is not an
uptight school like some of those
back east, but it will also place
Stanford in the record books,"
said sophomore Carter Lipton,
who has planned the event with
junior Mikel Jollett and sopho
more Rebecca Gould.
"I hope no one misses this
event because they are ashamed
to moon," he said. "Everyone will
be too busy mooning to worry
about anyone else's butt."
"Moon at Noon" grew out of a
simple conversation about doing
something "different," some
thing to challenge the obedience
of students to society's pressure
to be clothed, Lipton said.
"We were bothered by the gen-
eral apathy on campus," he said.
"We wondered if it would be pos
sible to get Stanford students to
rally to do something kind of
crazy."
As soon as the friends realized
the fame of a mention in the Gui
ness Rook of World Records
might be at stake, the event was
set.
"We want the record," said
Jollett. "We're hoping to get in
the books."
Along with an open invitation
to students at Sunday Flicks, the
organizers have sent press
releases to local newspapers and
radio and television stations, and

said they expect good coverage.
Since the project's birth, Jol
lett said, "we've gotten nothing
but support ," although the Stan
ford Band decided against playing
a serenade under the moon-light.
"We were hoping for the Rand
to come and support us, but even
they chickened out," he said.
"They thought it would piss off
the administration. ... 1 guess
that only proves that the Univer
sity is succeeding in its goal of
quieting us down."
And "Moon at Noon" is all
about being loud.
"A lot of people at Stanford
won't do anything that isn't
'approved,' that the administra
tion or their mothers wouldn't be
proud of," Gould said.
When the idea first came up,
"we all kind of laughed at the

suggestion, thinking it would be
impossible to get Stanford stu
dents to rally behind something
like this," Lipton said.
Hut their friends were enthu
siastic and promised to join in
the fun. The support should be
ample to impress Guineas, Jollett
said.
"We plan to get at least 1,000
signatures," he said. "That is,
2,000 cheeks."
A claim to fame gives an added
incentive to participate, Lipton
said. "Not many people can tell
their grandchildren that they
were a part of a world record-set
ting event."
Besides, Jollett added, "how
many times in one's life does one
get the chance to make a state
ment about the nature of our
University and reduce tan lines?"
