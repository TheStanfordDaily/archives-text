## GET WIRED WITH 'JOHNNY MNEMONIC' 
### 
Set too close in the future for
credibility, "Johnny Mnemon
ic" is a high energy romp
through the back alleys and cy
bernetic underworld of the year
2021. In a dystopic universe cre
ated by cyberpunk pioneer
William Gibson and novice film
director / modern artist Robert
Longo, Keanu Reeves plays the

part of a
mnem on i c
information
courier
named John-

ny, the soon-to-be hero of this
corporate-run information so
ciety.
Johnny, overloaded with 360
gigabytes in his wet-wired
synaptic memory implant, is
carrying vital information that
could save millions of lives. To
make matters more complicat
ed, he is running from the
Yakuza (the Japanese mafia),
and must download his neural
hard-drive within 24 hours or
lose both the uploaded data and
all his natural memory. Along
his odyssey, he is tailed by laser
wielding Japanese assassins, an
employer who wants his severed
head on ice, and Dolph Lund
gren as a cyborg-Jesus Christ.
Young Johnny is of course
saved from decapitation by a
struggling part-time body
guard / love interest, and is lead
to safety on several occasions by
both the underground neuro
surgeon (Henry Rollins), and
the cable TV-hijacking leader of
the low-teks (a futuristic under
ground — possibly Marxist —

rebellion), a dreadlocked and
cyborgized Ice-T. Also helping
Johnny along is an attractive ar
tificial intelligence who comes
up on monitors in key moments
to play the dens ex machina, or
better yet, the ghost in the ma
chine.
The movie which references
such pre-cyberpunk classics as

Johnny
Mnemonic

"Brazil,"
"Total Recall,"
the "Termina
tor" movies,
"Blade Run-

ner" and "Lawnmower Man," is
fast paced and entertaining, yet
fails in a number of ways. Forin
stance, despite stellar perfor
mances by Ice-T and Rollins,
the acting is often lacking. Also,
the filth and degradation that
Gibson's writing postulates
doesn't translate in Longo's vi
sion where even the sewers and
dumps are aesthetically pleasing
action sites.
Unlike Ridley Scotts' bril
liant noir depiction of a parallel
future in "Blade Runner,"
"Johnny Mnemonic" is clearly a
Hollywood product; what could
be a very terrifying vision of the
future is made accessible and
palatable by the streamlined
production.
However, it kept my interest
and 1 would recommend seeing
it if only for the cameos, the ex
ceedingly dramatized, comput
er-generated cyberspace scenes
and the Navy modified, code
breaking, nuclear-sub-tracking
cyborg-dolphin.
