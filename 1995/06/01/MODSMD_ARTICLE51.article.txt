## Matt Gregory Take advantage of the scenery on the Internet's temporary free ride

When The New York l imes Magazine de
votes its cover story to a hip computer
magazine based in San Francisco, you know
the digital revolution has been noticed —
and is entering the mainstream. But as things
like the World Wide Web and newsgroups be
come an accepted part of American culture,
they are starting to fray on the edges — and
lose some of their youthful luster.
As students at Stanford in the mid-19905,
we should consider ourselves lucky: The gold
en age of the Internet is happening before our
very eyes, and we are in the perfect place to
enjoy it, with our in-room connections and
(for now) free access to electronic mail and
other on-line goodies.
However, signs point to a more restricted
future. Along with the Net's rapid expansion
have come pioneers in search of new sources

of profit and a government looking for ways
to intervene and regulate. It may be a stretch,
but the Internet, however artificial, can be
considered the next American frontier to be
conquered. And just as the Old West had gold
(at least that's what early settlers were told),
the Net — these modern-day 49ers hope —
has a captive and wealthy audience ready to be
exploited.
There's only one problem: Using the Inter
net to make money directly violates one of the
unspoken tenets of the on-line culture — that
access should be free from both cost and re
strictions. And Net denizens don't like it
when newcomers try to rock the boat.
Still, they're trying. The San lose Mercury
News, our local paper and a pioneer in the on
line field, has a Web page with each day's sto
ries, classifieds and even some photos. The

Mere has been able to convince a few adver
tisers that it's worth paying something for on
line advertising, but that hasn't been enough.
Recently the paper began restricting full
text of stories — and access to cartoons, a very
popular part of the Web page — to registered
users who are charged a few dollars a month.
The cost is minimal — just a dollar if you al
ready subscribe to the actual paper — but I'd
guess that most people would say no.
It's the principle, you see.
Uncle Sam is starting to get in on the ac
tion too, although he's not looking for money
— just control. Nebraska's Sen. Jim Exon, a
Democrat, has been squawking about how
pornography on the Net can be accessed by
minors, a reasonable concern.
Exon's proposed solution, however, was
equivalent to outright censorship. The sena

tor wanted to ban anything "indecent" —
whatever that means — and hold people who
post criminal material responsible for the ac
tion. That means you could be prosecuted for
using an offensive word in an e-mail of post
— even though you'd have every right to say
this word over the phone.
It's not clear what will happen to cyber
space over the next few months and years.
Maybe government will stay out and the Net
will continue to be a rugged frontier, its cre
ativity unhindered by government.
But 1 doubt it. The Internet is becoming a
part of our culture — it's going to be hard to
keep Washington and corporate America
from getting involved. That might not be a
bad thing, but it will certainly make things
different.
So enjoy the free Net while it lasts.
