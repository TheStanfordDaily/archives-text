# Facing stereotypes, suspicion
## Middle Easterners fear aftermath of Oklahoma bomb 
### Heather Knight Staff writer 
A few people at Stanford felt a different sort of
explosion from the Oklahoma City bombing — an
explosion of racism.
Some Middle Eastern members of the Stanford
community say the false suspicions that the
bombers were Middle Eastern further perpetuated
stereotypes.
"The message has been that if you're Middle
Eastern you will be a suspect if you're near a bomb
ing," said Mary Ann Aposhian, a Counseling and
Psychological Services post-doctoral therapist.
"You can be hand cuffed just because you are
Middle Eastern. People suspected Middle Eastern
ers automatically," she said.
Aposhian, who is half Lebanese-American and
half Armenian-American, said she believes this
type of suspicion causes fear of bombings among
Middle Easterners — not that they may be physi
cally hurt by the bomb, but that their community
will be hurt by the terrorist stereotype.
"We've been robbed of the fear of getting
bombed," she said. "We are not conscious of being
afraid that a bomb might hit us, we are more afraid
that Middle Easterners might be suspected."
Sophomore Omar Ahmed, Jr., who is Egyptian-
American, said, "I was scared that [the Oklahoma
City bombers] were Middle Eastern people. I was
hoping that they weren't. I was afraid of the back-
lash."
When police arrested Timothy
McVeigh, a white militia member,
many Middle Easterners said they
felt more at ease.
"I felt both relieved and out
raged," said fifth-year doctoral
student Youssef Ismail, who is
Syrian-American. "I was outraged
that children were killed, but
there was also a sigh of relief. We
didn't want the stigma."
They already have the stigma,
according to many Middle East
erners at Stanford, who said they
experience racism ever day.
Sophomore Sherine Hamdy,
who is Egyptian-American, said
she feels racism toward the Mid
dle Eastern community here. A
resident of the French House, she
came home for lunch the day of
the Oklahoma City bombing to
find residents of Row houses evac
uated due to a bomb threat.
Hamdy's friends jokingly asked
her, "Is it your uncle?"
"I don't think that's funny at
all," she said.
Ismail said a Santa Clara
mosque received 50 hate calls
within two days of the Oklahoma
City bombing. Ahmed said his
father, who works in the Defense
Department, is afraid to associate
with the mosque in Sunnyvale
because of his ethnicity.
Aposhian said the fact that

nearly all Muslim and Arab stu
dent groups at Stanford have
gone underground shows that
Stanford students are affected by
racism and are afraid to display
their ethnicity.
"I think this is really tragic,"
said Aposhian of the lack of stu
dent association groups for Mid
dle Eastern Stanford students. "It
is tragic when anyone feels they
have to closet their identity."
Aposhian also expressed con
cern that the Stanford applica
tion has no designation for Mid
dle Eastern applicants, so there
is no record of how many Arab
students attend Stanford. She is
currently doing a Middle East
ern community research project
to find out how many Middle
Eastern students attend Stan
ford.
According to Aposhian, this
racism is worldwide. She was
traveling with a Lebanese-Ameri
can friend in Greece in 1989 when
the Pan-Am bombing occurred.
Her friend hadn't been in
Lebanon for 20 years, but armed
officials interviewed her three
times, dogs sniffed her for bombs
and she was forcefully separated
from Aposhian.
"The stereotypes exist all over
the world, but some countries are
more susceptible. America is very
susceptible," Aposhian said.
Many of the Middle Eastern
community say this susceptibility
to racism is partially due to the
American media, with the media's
actions in the Oklahoma City

bombing a prime example.
Aposhian expressed concern
that the media "never said why
they thought it was those two
Middle Eastern men." She said
the media always referred to
"Middle Eastern suspects," but
never referred to McVeigh's race
at all. They just called the two
white suspects "John Doe 1 and
John Doe 2." She said this shows
"people's fear of the other."
Rosy Weiser, a graduate stu
dent in journalism — who is doing
her final project on how the media
contributes to anti-Arab and anti-
Muslim sentiments — said the
media's stereotypes "come from
ignorance. There's not really neg
ative intent. It is easier to pick
convenient phrases than to pro
vide context and do research."
Weiser said the media needs to
rethink suspecting Middle East
erners without evidence because
of the media's far-reaching
impact. "For a lot of people, what
they read in the media is all they
know about Arabs and Muslims,"
she said.
Aposhian also said Middle
Easterners will probably always
be the first suspects in bombing
cases, but she doubts that all con
servative-looking men with crew
cuts, like McVeigh, will be sus
pected.
Aposhian said stereotypes of
Middle Easterners as terrorists
are nothing new. She said they
may be related to the Persian
Gulf War and the bombing of the
World Trade Center.

Hamdy said she feels there is a
nationwide stereotype of Middle
Easterners as being sexist terror
ists and hijackers.
Even Middle Eastern words
are misinterpreted by outsiders,
which furthers the stereotype.
Hamdy said one definition of Arab
in her French dictionary is "beg
gar." Ismail said the word Islam
means peace and the term "Islam
ic terrorist" is an oxymoron.
Aposhian pointed out that the
word "harem" is misunderstood
here. "For centuries we think of a
harem and we think that means
prostitutes, belly-dancers and
exotic women who have no rights.
Actually harem is an Arabic word.
It means sacred," she said.
There were certain rituals and
rights that were forbidden to
men, so only women could be in a
harem, according to Aposhian.
"The images of Middle Eastern
women are almost totally opposite
of what Middle Eastern women
really are," she said. "They were
the first feminists who believed in
sacred rituals."
Weiser said the media's igno
rance plays a role in leading to an
ignorant American public. "The
media has made a real effort to be
politically correct as far as the
other minorities go, but it hasn't
done that with Arabs."
Weiser said she fears the media
will not change. "If there was a
bombing tomorrow, I don't think
the media would have learned
from this," she said. "I think
they'd do the exact same thine."

Aposhian said stereotypes of
Middle Easterners as terrorists
are nothing new. She said they
may be related to the Persian
Gulf War and the bombing of the
World Trade Center.

Hamdy said she feels there is a
nationwide stereotype of Middle
Easterners as being sexist terror
ists and hijackers.
Even Middle Eastern words
are misinterpreted by outsiders,
which furthers the stereotype.
Hamdy said one definition of Arab
in her French dictionary is "beg
gar." Ismail said the word Islam
means peace and the term "Islam
ic terrorist" is an oxymoron.
Aposhian pointed out that the
word "harem" is misunderstood
here. "For centuries we think of a
harem and we think that means
prostitutes, belly-dancers and
exotic women who have no rights.
Actually harem is an Arabic word.
It means sacred," she said.
There were certain rituals and
rights that were forbidden to
men, so only women could be in a
harem, according to Aposhian.
"The images of Middle Eastern
women are almost totally opposite
of what Middle Eastern women
really are," she said. "They were
the first feminists who believed in
sacred rituals."
Weiser said the media's igno
rance plays a role in leading to an
ignorant American public. "The
media has made a real effort to be
politically correct as far as the
other minorities go, but it hasn't
done that with Arabs."
Weiser said she fears the media
will not change. "If there was a
bombing tomorrow, I don't think
the media would have learned
from this," she said. "I think
they'd do the exact same thine."
