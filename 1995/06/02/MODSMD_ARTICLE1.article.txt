# Pointed problem
## Meal plan prices raise student ire

at the operations of Stanford's
Dining Services.
Dining Services officials agree
that one of the biggest com
plaints they hear from students
concerns the operation of the
point system.
Since its institution in Man
zanita and Stern four years ago,
the point system has come under
continued attack by students.
Some complain that they don't
have enough points at the end of
the quarter. Others feel they
have far too many and needlessly
have to waste points at the end of
each quarter on bulk orders of
junk food.
Probably the most common
complaint, however, concerns
the prices of retail products such
as Snapple or Fruitopia, which
cost $1.30 and $1.65 respective

Dining Services Manager
Shirley Everett said there are in
herent problems in trying to in
stall a retail-type program in an
institutional setting, but part of
the problem also lies in inform

ing students how the point sys
tem works.
"Students compare the prices
to those at a supermarket or a

restaurant,"
Everett said.
"You can't j
make that
comparison."
Because
Dining Ser
vices sets j
aside 30 per
cent of its

LUlll U1 ItS
budget for food costs, the price of
food usually more than triples
before put on the shelf to cover
the remaining operational costs.
This practice applies even to re
tail products, like Snapple.

History of the point system
The point system is not new to
Stanford. According to Craig
Mitchell, an opera

' -!
tions manager at
Dining Services, a
point-type system
has been in place at
Ricker Dining Hall
since around 1982.
"It became re
ally trendy at other
campuses" in the

middle and late
1980s, Housing and Dining Ser
vices Director Keith Guy said.
The point system was later
adopted at Stern Hall as well as

the Manzanita Dining Commons
in the fall of 1991. The move to
the point system originally came
as part of an effort to trim
$130,000 off the Dining Services
budget.
A year later, Dining Services
raised the prices of retail items by
15 cents, due to problems with
labor and other costs, such as
salaries, benefits, utilities and
insurance.
Currently, the average prices
in the premium, regular and lite a
la carte board plans are $1.19,
$1.20 and $1.22 per point, respec
tively.
In the fall of 1993, Dining Ser
vices created the a la board meal
plan following the renovation of
Wilbur Hall. The plan combined
the traditional all-you-can-eat
model with the point system.
Stern Hall ia expected to con
vert to the a la board system after
its renovation this summer.
Inherent problems
After its adoption in Stern and
Manzanita in 1991, Guy said
Everett noticed that there were
problems inherent in the point
system.
According to Guy, the main
problem lies in the fact that Din
ing Services must meet all its
expenses, and the current system
is set up so that food costs
account for 30 percent to 31 per
cent of the total expenses.
Food costs combine with labor
to cover the majority of the
expenses that go into offering the
food item. "Somewhere in the
mix, 70 percent of the expenses
go into the preparation of the
item," Guy saidL
Because such items as Snapple

and Fruitopia come to campus
already prepackaged and pre
pared, however, "it's a different
level of labor cost," Guy said.
"The labor to prepare those
items is not as intensive as
preparing food from raw ingredi
ents."
He added that this system is
the reason that the price of Snap
pie has been so high. "We've
struggled with that one," Guy
said. "Shirley [Everett] and I
tried to [remove] it once. ... I
don't know what we're going to
do with it."
Mitchell added that breaking
the point system down into aver
age points per dollar does not
take into account other expenses.
"We can't speculate how many
minutes of labor is spent on each
item," Mitchell said. "There are
just too many items."
The point system also differs
structurally from the traditional
board plan. "The missed meal is
factored into the [traditional]
board plan," bringing the overall
price down, said Guy.
"Students can miss two or
three meals and still feel like
they're getting their money's
worth," he added.
On the a la carte plan, howev
er, "in exchange for dollars, you
get points, which you can use
however you want," Guy said.
"We're not giving you those
points back, though. We need
that money to operate."
Too many points
Despite the high price of retail
products, students often com
plain about the excess points they
are stuck with at the end of each
quarter.
Students on the a la carte sys
tem have a choice of three meal
plans but do not have the option
to carry the points over between
quarters or get cash back for any

unused points. Thus many stu
dents end the quarter with extra
points that they use to purchase
bulk orders of bottled beverages
and snack foods.
Guy said Dining Services is
continuing to look at the possibil
ity of having points carry over
between quarters.
As a result of accruing an aver
age of 150 extra points per quar
ter last year, senior Dyron Jue —
who had a board plan in Richer —
wrote and distributed his own
survey last spring to residents
who ate at Ricker, Manzanita and
Stern Hall.
"It was a fuzzy, not very offi
cial survey," Jue said. "Basically
I'm an independent crusader on
the point system."
Jue added that the point sys
tem was"the only fair issue I
thought I had a chance at."
He received close to 250
responses from his survey, which
he "specifically tailored to a point
system dorm."
Jue said he has no plans for a
statistical analysis of the survey
and that his results are just
straight percentages.
Respondents to the survey
said they garnered an average of
93 extra points at the end of fall
quarter last year and 82 at the
end of winter quarter. In order
to use up these points, 66 per
cent of the respondents said
they purchased bulk orders of
food.
An overwhelming 77 percent
said they would prefer Dining
Services to give rebates for
unused points and 74 percent
said they would support the addi
tion of an "Extra Lite Plan"
which would lower the required
minimum plan by at least 200
points.
In addition, when asked about
Dining Services food prices and
value for the dollar, 54 percent

said they disagreed strongly with
the notion that food prices are
reasonable. Fifty-eight percent
also disagreed strongly that they
were getting value for their dol
lar
Although he did try to "tap
into students' attitudes," Jue
admitted that his survey may not
be very representative of the stu
dent population as a whole.
"My goal . . was to lower the
required minimum point plan,"
Jue said. ' Food Service refuses to
do that, i wanted to show the
interest is there in changing
that
Mitcheii said Dining Services
does not keep records of the bulk
order sheets. lie added that the
average number of leftover points
at the very end of the quarter is
"relatively small."
"It averages to about $3 to $4
per person . . . after the bulk
orders," he said.
Points elsewhere
The point system is far from
unique to the Stanford campus.
At Dartmouth, the point system
is an option for students but does
not serve as an alternative to the
traditional board plan.
The system is called the
Declining Balance Option at
Dartmouth, and if students
choose to participate in the pro
gram, they are required to pur
chase at least $366 worth of
points. They can purchase as
much as they want above that
amount and also have the option
to receive up to $100 back at the
end of the quarter for unused
points.
Dartmouth's Director of Din
ing Services Peter Napolitano
said that he tries to keep food cost
at the "40 percent threshold"
when purchasing prepackaged
items.
This results in higher prices

for prepackaged items than those
found at grocery stores, Napoli
tano said, adding that a can of
Snapple costs $1.10 at Dart
mouth while a liter costs 50 to 60
cents at downtown supermarkets
in Hanover.
"That is one of the items stu
dents point to" when complaining
about high prices, he said.
"Prepackaged items come with
a preset cost,"he added. "We
should be selling that item at
$1.30. Forty percent of that $1.30
should be what is spent on the
food cost."
At Duke, the entire meal plan
system is run on the declining
balance model. Students on board
plans pay between $1,840 and
$3,200 a year for points. These
points are redeemable at dining
halls as well as grocery stores on
campus.
Points can carry over from the
fall to spring semester at Duke,
and students can get up to $100
back for any unused points at the
end of the year. For any amount
above $100, students get only 50
percent of that amount back.
"It's definitely not as attrac
tive as running on a traditi >nal
board plan," said Wes Newman,
director of Duke's Dining Ser
vices. "It makes it much more dif
ficult to manage. We don't have
as much of a cushion and have to
operate on a profit / loss
basis. . . . We have to operate
much more like a restaurant."
Newman also admitted that
prices for retail items at Duke are
higher than grocery store prices,
but are about equal to those at
convenience stories.
"We try to be similar but not
cheaper than convenience
stores," Newman said, adding
that while costs vary between
units, roughly 35 percent of
expenses go to purchase food
while 45 percent goes to labor.

units, roughly 35 percent of
expenses go to purchase food
while 45 percent goes to labor.

Dining Services officials agree
that one of the biggest com
plaints they hear from students
concerns the operation of the
point system.
Since its institution in Man
zanita and Stern four years ago,
the point system has come under
continued attack by students.
Some complain that they don't
have enough points at the end of
the quarter. Others feel they
have far too many and needlessly
have to waste points at the end of
each quarter on bulk orders of
junk food.
Probably the most common
complaint, however, concerns
the prices of retail products such
as Snapple or Fruitopia, which
cost $1.30 and $1.65 respective

Dining Services Manager
Shirley Everett said there are in
herent problems in trying to in
stall a retail-type program in an
institutional setting, but part of
the problem also lies in inform

ing students how the point sys
tem works.
"Students compare the prices
to those at a supermarket or a

restaurant,"
Everett said.
"You can't j
make that
comparison."
Because
Dining Ser
vices sets j
aside 30 per
cent of its

LUlll U1 ItS
budget for food costs, the price of
food usually more than triples
before put on the shelf to cover
the remaining operational costs.
This practice applies even to re
tail products, like Snapple.

History of the point system
The point system is not new to
Stanford. According to Craig
Mitchell, an opera

' -!
tions manager at
Dining Services, a
point-type system
has been in place at
Ricker Dining Hall
since around 1982.
"It became re
ally trendy at other
campuses" in the

middle and late
1980s, Housing and Dining Ser
vices Director Keith Guy said.
The point system was later
adopted at Stern Hall as well as

the Manzanita Dining Commons
in the fall of 1991. The move to
the point system originally came
as part of an effort to trim
$130,000 off the Dining Services
budget.
A year later, Dining Services
raised the prices of retail items by
15 cents, due to problems with
labor and other costs, such as
salaries, benefits, utilities and
insurance.
Currently, the average prices
in the premium, regular and lite a
la carte board plans are $1.19,
$1.20 and $1.22 per point, respec
tively.
In the fall of 1993, Dining Ser
vices created the a la board meal
plan following the renovation of
Wilbur Hall. The plan combined
the traditional all-you-can-eat
model with the point system.
Stern Hall ia expected to con
vert to the a la board system after
its renovation this summer.
Inherent problems
After its adoption in Stern and
Manzanita in 1991, Guy said
Everett noticed that there were
problems inherent in the point
system.
According to Guy, the main
problem lies in the fact that Din
ing Services must meet all its
expenses, and the current system
is set up so that food costs
account for 30 percent to 31 per
cent of the total expenses.
Food costs combine with labor
to cover the majority of the
expenses that go into offering the
food item. "Somewhere in the
mix, 70 percent of the expenses
go into the preparation of the
item," Guy saidL
Because such items as Snapple

and Fruitopia come to campus
already prepackaged and pre
pared, however, "it's a different
level of labor cost," Guy said.
"The labor to prepare those
items is not as intensive as
preparing food from raw ingredi
ents."
He added that this system is
the reason that the price of Snap
pie has been so high. "We've
struggled with that one," Guy
said. "Shirley [Everett] and I
tried to [remove] it once. ... I
don't know what we're going to
do with it."
Mitchell added that breaking
the point system down into aver
age points per dollar does not
take into account other expenses.
"We can't speculate how many
minutes of labor is spent on each
item," Mitchell said. "There are
just too many items."
The point system also differs
structurally from the traditional
board plan. "The missed meal is
factored into the [traditional]
board plan," bringing the overall
price down, said Guy.
"Students can miss two or
three meals and still feel like
they're getting their money's
worth," he added.
On the a la carte plan, howev
er, "in exchange for dollars, you
get points, which you can use
however you want," Guy said.
"We're not giving you those
points back, though. We need
that money to operate."
Too many points
Despite the high price of retail
products, students often com
plain about the excess points they
are stuck with at the end of each
quarter.
Students on the a la carte sys
tem have a choice of three meal
plans but do not have the option
to carry the points over between
quarters or get cash back for any

unused points. Thus many stu
dents end the quarter with extra
points that they use to purchase
bulk orders of bottled beverages
and snack foods.
Guy said Dining Services is
continuing to look at the possibil
ity of having points carry over
between quarters.
As a result of accruing an aver
age of 150 extra points per quar
ter last year, senior Dyron Jue —
who had a board plan in Richer —
wrote and distributed his own
survey last spring to residents
who ate at Ricker, Manzanita and
Stern Hall.
"It was a fuzzy, not very offi
cial survey," Jue said. "Basically
I'm an independent crusader on
the point system."
Jue added that the point sys
tem was"the only fair issue I
thought I had a chance at."
He received close to 250
responses from his survey, which
he "specifically tailored to a point
system dorm."
Jue said he has no plans for a
statistical analysis of the survey
and that his results are just
straight percentages.
Respondents to the survey
said they garnered an average of
93 extra points at the end of fall
quarter last year and 82 at the
end of winter quarter. In order
to use up these points, 66 per
cent of the respondents said
they purchased bulk orders of
food.
An overwhelming 77 percent
said they would prefer Dining
Services to give rebates for
unused points and 74 percent
said they would support the addi
tion of an "Extra Lite Plan"
which would lower the required
minimum plan by at least 200
points.
In addition, when asked about
Dining Services food prices and
value for the dollar, 54 percent

said they disagreed strongly with
the notion that food prices are
reasonable. Fifty-eight percent
also disagreed strongly that they
were getting value for their dol
lar
Although he did try to "tap
into students' attitudes," Jue
admitted that his survey may not
be very representative of the stu
dent population as a whole.
"My goal . . was to lower the
required minimum point plan,"
Jue said. ' Food Service refuses to
do that, i wanted to show the
interest is there in changing
that
Mitcheii said Dining Services
does not keep records of the bulk
order sheets. lie added that the
average number of leftover points
at the very end of the quarter is
"relatively small."
"It averages to about $3 to $4
per person . . . after the bulk
orders," he said.
Points elsewhere
The point system is far from
unique to the Stanford campus.
At Dartmouth, the point system
is an option for students but does
not serve as an alternative to the
traditional board plan.
The system is called the
Declining Balance Option at
Dartmouth, and if students
choose to participate in the pro
gram, they are required to pur
chase at least $366 worth of
points. They can purchase as
much as they want above that
amount and also have the option
to receive up to $100 back at the
end of the quarter for unused
points.
Dartmouth's Director of Din
ing Services Peter Napolitano
said that he tries to keep food cost
at the "40 percent threshold"
when purchasing prepackaged
items.
This results in higher prices

for prepackaged items than those
found at grocery stores, Napoli
tano said, adding that a can of
Snapple costs $1.10 at Dart
mouth while a liter costs 50 to 60
cents at downtown supermarkets
in Hanover.
"That is one of the items stu
dents point to" when complaining
about high prices, he said.
"Prepackaged items come with
a preset cost,"he added. "We
should be selling that item at
$1.30. Forty percent of that $1.30
should be what is spent on the
food cost."
At Duke, the entire meal plan
system is run on the declining
balance model. Students on board
plans pay between $1,840 and
$3,200 a year for points. These
points are redeemable at dining
halls as well as grocery stores on
campus.
Points can carry over from the
fall to spring semester at Duke,
and students can get up to $100
back for any unused points at the
end of the year. For any amount
above $100, students get only 50
percent of that amount back.
"It's definitely not as attrac
tive as running on a traditi >nal
board plan," said Wes Newman,
director of Duke's Dining Ser
vices. "It makes it much more dif
ficult to manage. We don't have
as much of a cushion and have to
operate on a profit / loss
basis. . . . We have to operate
much more like a restaurant."
Newman also admitted that
prices for retail items at Duke are
higher than grocery store prices,
but are about equal to those at
convenience stories.
"We try to be similar but not
cheaper than convenience
stores," Newman said, adding
that while costs vary between
units, roughly 35 percent of
expenses go to purchase food
while 45 percent goes to labor.
