# Frost renovations yield better access, lighting
## 
### Marcus Jackson Contributing writer 
A project intended to update
Frost Amphitheater facilities
and improve safety in the area
is nearing completion.
The amphitheater's lighting
system will undergo renova
tions over the next few weeks;
this change, along with various
other changes that have
already been completed, is
intended to increase accessibili
ty. The new lights will be in
place for a scheduled July 3
concert and fireworks show.
Part of a 10-year program to
refurbish the amphitheater,
the renovations are being done
in small increments, according
to Judy Chan, associate direc
tor of the Planning Office.
The current renovations,
which were funded by outside
donations, were coordinated by
staff members from the Plan
ning Office, the Grounds Divi
sion, Stanford Events and
Facilities Project Management.
The new lighting system will
expand the amphitheater's
potential uses, Chan said. "Not
having effective lighting has

limited program scope for per
formances in the past. Speakers
and performers couldn't go on
until late in the evening," she
said.
The new lighting will allow
for "easier ingress and egress
from the seating area. The
overall focus is on circulation
improvements," Chan said.
In addition to the lighting,
Frost Amphitheater's pave
ment surface has been upgrad
ed to asphalt and access to the
theater for disabled patrons
and large vehicles has been
improved. "This allows per
formers and VIPs easier
entrance," Chan said. Also, the
pathway on the edge of the
bowl of the amphitheater has
been redone so maintenance
vehicles can use it.
Priorities for future
improvements in the amphithe
ater include taking care of ero
sion on the banks, soil stabiliza
tion and plant restoration and
reforestation, Chan said.
"However, the future of the
renovation program is uncer
tain because right now we don't
have the funding for any new
projects," she said.
