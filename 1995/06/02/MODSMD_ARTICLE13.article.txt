# Marilyn Monroe stamp unveiled

UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) - As Marilyn Mon
roe's breathy voice cooed "I Wanna Be Loved By You"
and the audience cheered, Postmaster Marvin Runyon
unveiled a wall-high version of her commemorative 32-
cent stamp yesterday.
"In every poster, picture and production, she cast a
spell," Runyon said. "It wasn't fame she wanted, but
meaning."
The stamp, designed by Michael Deas, is the first in
the U.S. Postal Service's "Legends of Hollywood"
series.
At the Beverly Hills post office, collectors waited in
line to get their stamps canceled with the date of issue,
which would have been Monroe's 69th birthday. She
died in 1962.
"I had a crush on her, like many teen-age boys at the
time," said 51-year-old Amnon Friedman, who bought
$128 worth. "I felt like somehow, I'd be the right one
for her."

The stamp depicts Monroe striking a sultry, slightly
over-the-shoulder pose in a glittery gold gown. The let
tering of her name is a facsimile of her signature. At
the corners of the stamps, the perforations in the paper
— normally round — are star-shaped.
Monroe co-star Elli Wallach said he imagined Mon
roe looking down and saying, "God, they've given me a
stamp. Men have been stamping on me all my life, and
now I'll get a chance to stamp on them."
While the main ceremonies surrounding the Mon
roe issue were here, other cities got into the act as well.
Oklahoma City postal workers dressed in outfits
from the '50s. They had a standup cutout of Monroe, a
juke box played old songs, and they gave away popcorn
as they sold the stamps.
The Postal Service has said it would print 400 mil
lion of the Monroe stamps, which are the latest in a
series honoring pop culture icons such as Elvis Presley,
Babe Ruth, Bing Crosby and Buster Keaton.
