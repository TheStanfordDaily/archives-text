# West rejects deal with Serbs

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) — Western allies refused to
deal with the Bosnian Serbs and
pushed instead yesterday for a rapid
deployment force to add muscle to
their diplomatic efforts to free hun
dreds of hostage peacekeepers.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic warned that any attempt
to rescue some 370 U.N. peacekeep
ers being held by the Serbs would
result in butchery.
On the ground, the situation
grew even more precarious as a
Swedish U.N. civilian official was
detained, Sarajevo ran short of food
and fighting flared in the east and
northeast.
The pilot of a French fighter jet
on reconnaissance over Bosnia
reported that a surface-to-air mis
sile was fired, but NATO officials
said they didn't know if the aircraft
was the target. It was not hit.
The United States dismissed Ser
bian overtures for talks on the
hostage crisis, but sent a top envoy
to try to persuade Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic to isolate his for
mer Bosnian proteges by recogniz
ing Bosnia's Muslim-led govern
ment.
The Serb rebels had called for
immediate negotiations on the
hostages — seized after NATO

bombing raids last week — but
insisted that NATO guarantee
there would be no more airstrikes
before the peacekeepers would be
freed.
"We are not prepared to go into
talks on that basis," Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said yes
terday in Lisbon, Portugal.
Speaking on Bosnian Serb televi
sion, Karadzic warned against any
attempt to rescue the peacekeepers.
"We constantly change their
location," Karadzic said, adding that
any rescue attempt "would resem
ble a butcher's shop. We must
defend ourselves."
He again claimed that the
detained U.N. soldiers were "POWS
because their commander ordered
NATO bombings." But he added:
"They are in good condition and I
can send a message to their families
that nothing will happen to them."
Karadzic repeated demands that
U.N. "safe areas" be demilitarized
and that clandestine arms ship
ments to the government be ended
as conditions for releasing the
peacekeepers.
In Belgrade, U.S. envoy Robert
Frasure offered new concessions to
Milosevic, the region's power bro
ker, that would effectively lift U.N.
trade sanctions and provide finan

cial incentives if he recognizes
Bosnia, sources said. The sanctions
were imposed on Serbia for inciting
the war in Bosnia
Hinting at potential rewards,
which could include loans from
international banks, Christopher
said that "it would be useful to him
in the future if he does emphasize
that he is no longer an ally of the
Pale Serbs."
British Defense Secretary Mal
colm Rifkind, meanwhile, said
Britain and France would establish
a rapid-reaction strike force to pro
tect peacekeepers that would be
"robustly equipped to counter
potential attacks on U.N. person
nel."
Formation of the strike force will
be discussed by diplomats in Paris
this weekend and by a meeting of
NATO defense ministers next week.
Rifkind also welcomed President
Clinton's new flexibility in offering
to send U.S. ground troops to
Bosnia to help redeploy U.N. peace
keepers — not just to pull them out.
"It is certainly a significant
change in the American
position,"he said.
Foreign Office minister Douglas
Hogg said he expects Americans to
be asked to help redeploy some
peacekeeping troops.
