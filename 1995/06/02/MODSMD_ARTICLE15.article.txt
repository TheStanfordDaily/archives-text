LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gov. Pete Wilson yesterday
abolished a variety of affirmative action programs that
help minorities and women win jobs and contracts, hop
ing to strengthen his presidential bid.
Wilson, still mute while recovering from throat
surgery, issued an executive order that fulfilled a
promise he made alter his upset victory for a second
term last year.
"What we owe the people is to fix what is wrong, to
cure the unfairness and to set it right," the Republican
said in a statement read by Joanne Corday Kozberg, his
state and consumer services agency secretary.
Critics called Wilson's move reactionary and
promised a fight. About 20 people showed up at the
announcement to protest, while about six firefighters
sat in a semi-circle surrounding Wilson in a show of sup
port.
"With one swoop of the pen, Governor Pete Wilson
will become infamous for taking Californians back to an
era where women and minorities 'knew their place,'"
the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational

Fund fired back in a statement from its Los Angeles
office.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Wilson proved he was
a'Yefined unprincipled George Wallace."
"Wilson says he wants to move from 'favoritism to
fairness,' as if those of us who support affirmative
action want something different," said Jackson, a for
mer Democratic presidential candidate. "Affirmative
action is a relatively young, conservative remedy to gen
erations of unfair practices that favored white men."
Among other things, the order eliminates about 150
advisory boards that provide race- and gender-based
hiring guidance to state agencies.
It also will require the California Department of
Transportation to reduce from 20 percent to 10 percent
(the federal minimum) the amount of project contract
money set aside for companies owned by women and
minorities.
That could affect contracts worth $1 billion, said Jef
frey M. Reid, undersecretary of the state's business,
transportation and housing agency. ,'J ..
