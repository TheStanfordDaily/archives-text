World Bank director chosen
WASHINGTON (AP) — James D. Wolfensohn took over
the presidency of the World Bank on Thursday with a warn
ing against cuts in U.S. aid and a pledge to "learn something
of what is going on" by walking the streets of the world.
Wolfensohn, at a news conference, said he came to the
bank with a dream "to try and make things better." He said
he wants to meet with private groups, including those criti
cal of the world's biggest lender.
But the former New York investment banker, arts exec
utive and classical cellist said he is a pragmatic banker, not
a "wide-eyed do-gooder." He succeeds Lewis T. Preston, a
former chief executive of J. P. Morgan investment house,
who died May 4.
While recognizing the budgetary constraints on
Congress, he said he hopes it will give "a proper priority to"
the bank's lending overseas, adding that such lending gen
erates American jobs. "Many of our major export markets
come from countries that we've helped," he said.
In his new job, Wolfensohn represents the 178 countries
that own the bank. It is the biggest supplier of aid to poor
countries, lending over $22 billion a year. Born in Australia
61 years ago, he became a U.S. citizen in 1980. He will
remain as chairman of Washington's Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts through the end of the year.
Wolfensohn emphasized his interest in the social situa
tion in developing countries.
"There are people in the world who just don't have a fair
shake in a lot of ways, either economically, or because
they're women or because there's a lack of health service, a

lack of education, and in many cases a lack of political free
dom," he said.
Eighth-grader wins national spelling bee
WASHINGTON (AP) — Justin Tyler Carroll, 14, an
Arkansas eighth-grader whose hobbies include solving dif
ficult word puzzles, correctly spelled "xanthosis" yesterday
to win the 68th annual national spelling bee.
Grabbing the microphone with both hands, he spelled
the winning word — which means a discoloration of the
skin — without pausing.
"It's like a dream," Justin said of his win. "It's just unre
al."
In the closing rounds, competitors dropped over such
tongue-twisters as "frugivorous" (feeding on fruit) and
"smaragdine" (yellowish green).
Justin handled some real jawbreakers himself, such as
"haplology" (a word contraction) and "syncretize" (to unite
against an enemy).
"I tried to be optimistic throughout that I would get
words I knew," said Justin, who lives in Wynne, Ark., but
represented Memphis in the contest. He said he had stud
ied "xanthosis" and that he was "familiar with the words
that I got today."
His mother, first-grade teacher Sharron K. Carroll,
helped him drill and said: "No doubt, he's better than I
am.
Marjory Lavery, a 13-year-old homeschooler from Cop
ley, Ohio, was runner-up. She was eliminated after mis
spelling "cappelletti," a type of pasta.
