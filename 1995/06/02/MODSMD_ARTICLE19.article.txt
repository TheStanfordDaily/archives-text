IN HONOR of Stanford alumnus Robert Hass being named Poet Lau
reate of the United States, The Daily is printing a poem by Prof. Hass
entitled "Black Mountain, Los Altos." Hass wrote the poem in his last
year at Stanford, an era defined by protests against the Vietnam War.
Black Mountain, Los Altos

Clumps of ghostly buckeye
bleached bones
weirdly grey in the runoff
between ridges, the flats
in fog. Five deer grazing
on the long hill, the soft
cluck of mourning doves,
creeks running. I feel
furry as sage here
after an hour's walk
in clear mid morning air
Only
three species of tree in
all these hills: blue oak,
buckeye, and patches of
wind-rasped laurel.

In the old quiet the Indians
could have heard bells
at Mission Santa Clara
where the brown-cowled padres
taught the sorrowful mysteries
with a whip. They
manufacture napalm
in the fog where Redwood City
sprawls into the bay.
I think of the village
of Bien Hoa, the early spring
death in the buckeyes
and up the long valley
my eyes flash, another
knife, clean as malice.
