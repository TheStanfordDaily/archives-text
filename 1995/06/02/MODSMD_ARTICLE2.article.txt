# Rice announces $4.6 M in budget cuts next year
## Schools will also have to pay charges for space, 6 percent levy on spending from restricted funds 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice un
veiled the University's 1995-96 bud
get plan before the Faculty Senate
yesterday, announcing $4.6 million
in budget cuts, much of which will be
borne by the University's academic
divisions.
The budget plan includes $1.35
billion in estimated revenue and ex
penditures of $1.31 billion. As usual,
salaries and benefits constitute a

large portion of expenses — about 53 percent. Salary
increases next year will average about 3 percent for fac
ulty and 2.5 percent for staff.
The budget plan continues a three-year initiative
aimed at cutting $18 million from the University bud
get. Last year's first round of cuts totaled $6.1 million.
This year, $7.4 million was cut from University gener
al funds allocations. As $2.8 million of those savings
will be redirected into central reserves, the Universi
ty's net reductions in spending will total $4.6 million.
That figure falls somewhat short of the $6 million tar
get set for this year's budget cuts.
In all, the budget plan predicts a balanced budget for
unrestricted spending. About 2 percent of unrestricted
funds were allocated to a contingency reserve fund
aimed at partially covering shortfalls in estimated rev
enue next year.
Unrestricted revenue projections include an esti
mated $3.5 million that the University will gain by ef
fectively dipping into the pool of restricted funds —
money that can only be spent for the purposes specified
by their donors.

This will be achieved through a two-part system
aimed at helping the University recoup operations and
maintenance costs, which are currently paid out of
University unrestricted funds. First, each school will
be charged a "space charge" based on the square
footage it occupies.
In addition, each school will have to pay a 6 percent
levy on expenditures from restricted funds. In effect, a
restricted gift to the University will be subject to a 6


Rice
percent tax to be funneled into
unrestricted funds.
While last year's round of bud
get cuts focused mainly on admin
istrative units, academic units will
face about $3.5 million in cuts this
year — nearly half the total cuts.
General funds allocations to the
academic schools will not be
increased to account for inflation.
The schools will therefore face real
cuts ranging from 1.1 percent for
the School of Education to 3.5 per
cent for the Dean of Research. The
School of Earth Sciences will face a
larger reduction of about $440,000,
or 12.9 percent, but the school will
immediately receive $350,000 from
University gift income.
Administrative units will face
$3.9 million in spending cuts,
largely in staff reductions and

decreases in administrative costs
achieved by new computerized
information systems.
The budget plan estimates that
the University will generate a
total of $3.5 million in additional
unrestricted funds from the two
components of the space charge.
While the budget plan calls for
substantial spending cuts, it also
provides for strategic investment
in several areas of the University.
Funds have been allocated toward
developing new administrative
information systems and for
developing new academic initia
tives such as the Commission on
Technology, implementation of
the recommendations of the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation and development of a new
Language Center.
The University will also spend
$177 million on projects associat
ed with a five-year, $731 million
capital improvement plan slated
to begin next year. The initiative

encompasses a number of con
struction, renovation and
improvement projects throughout
the campus.
Among the planned projects
are a new $108 million Science
and Engineering quad, $193 mil
lion in earthquake repair and seis
mic strengthening programs, con
struction and renovation of stu
dent housing and a $23 million
renovation of University athletic
facilities.
This year, the Board of
Trustees increased the endow
ment payout rate from 4.75 per
cent to 5.25 percent in exchange
for a promise that the increase in
unrestricted expenditures would
not exceed 1 percent plus infla
tion. If the Board renews this
agreement, endowment payout
will generate $6 million for seis
mic strengthening projects.
The budget plan must be
approved by the Board of Trustees
at their June 15 meeting.
