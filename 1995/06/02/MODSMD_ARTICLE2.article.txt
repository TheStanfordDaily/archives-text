# Rice announces $4.6 M in budget cuts next year
## Schools will also have to pay charges for space, 6 percent levy on spending from restricted funds

Provost Condoleezza Rice un
veiled the University's 1995-96 bud
get plan before the Faculty Senate
yesterday, announcing $4.6 million
in budget cuts, much of which will be
borne by the University's academic
divisions.
The budget plan includes $1.35
billion in estimated revenue and ex
penditures of $1.31 billion. As usual,
salaries and benefits constitute a

large portion of expenses — about 53 percent. Salary
increases next year will average about 3 percent for fac
ulty and 2.5 percent for staff.
The budget plan continues a three-year initiative
aimed at cutting $18 million from the University bud
get. Last year's first round of cuts totaled $6.1 million.
This year, $7.4 million was cut from University gener
al funds allocations. As $2.8 million of those savings
will be redirected into central reserves, the Universi
ty's net reductions in spending will total $4.6 million.
That figure falls somewhat short of the $6 million tar
get set for this year's budget cuts.
In all, the budget plan predicts a balanced budget for
unrestricted spending. About 2 percent of unrestricted
funds were allocated to a contingency reserve fund
aimed at partially covering shortfalls in estimated rev
enue next year.
Unrestricted revenue projections include an esti
mated $3.5 million that the University will gain by ef
fectively dipping into the pool of restricted funds —
money that can only be spent for the purposes specified
by their donors.

This will be achieved through a two-part system
aimed at helping the University recoup operations and
maintenance costs, which are currently paid out of
University unrestricted funds. First, each school will
be charged a "space charge" based on the square
footage it occupies.
In addition, each school will have to pay a 6 percent
levy on expenditures from restricted funds. In effect, a
restricted gift to the University will be subject to a 6
