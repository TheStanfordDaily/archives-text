# A 						cyberage education

ATTEND ALL lectures in the
comfort of your dorm room.
Dissect virtual cadavers.
Such are the promises of a educa
tion in the coming cyberage, and
Stanford is making sure the trains
don't leave without it. The Universi
ty's Commission on Technology in
Teaching and Learning has already
implemented a handful of proposals
aimed at assisting even the most
obstinate technophobes confront the
realities of a new world.
There is no sense denying — or
resisting — the sweep of technologi
cal change, and the commission's
attempt to accommodate it should
be applauded. But where do the ben
efits of efficiency begin to encroach
upon the very foundation of a uni
versity?
University President Gerhard
Casper, for one, has recognized the
daunting implications of higher edu
cation's impending liftoff into
cyberspace. In April, at the Ameri
can Educational Research Associa
tion's national convention, he
argued for the university's relevance
in the next century. "Software com

panies may well become the com
petitors of universities," he said,
adding that the prospect of "distance
learning" threatened to render obso
lete the essential value of human
exchange in the classroom.
The issue of technology brings
out in high relief the dilemmas of
Gerhard Casper. On the one hand,
he is a standard-bearer of tradition,
a man given to the occasional quote
from a 12th-century scholar, a presi
dent so devoted to learning he teach
es an undergraduate seminar. At the
same time, Casper fashions himself
a visionary spokesman for the future
of higher education.
So where does — or more accu
rately, should — he stand? Perhaps
he is still figuring it out. But there is
an immediate need for Casper to
stake out where Stanford will stand,
before the information wave engulfs
society. He needs to articulate a set
of concrete goals for the University
that will keep it on the leading edge
of educational technology. But he
must also lay out the boundaries of
change — software, CD ROMs and
cyberspace be damned.
