## Sorry? Who said sorry? 
### 
APOLOGIES IN America are rare;
apologies in public are rarely real.
Most recently, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato suffered a medical crisis to dra
matize his regret for race-related mock
ery of Judge Lance Ito. Now is an ideal
time to reflect on this political phe
nomenon of saying sorry without sinceri
ty, after everyone else has had their say
about the D'Amato-Ito incident. For if it
simply passes into the course of events,
the practitioners of doubletalk, brazen
but cowardly, will again have successful
ly said something wrong while saying
nothing at all.
The recent history of politicians and
public figures making racially-based
statements and subsequently issuing
retractions has an appropriately bizarre
beginning with Sen. Edmund Muskie
during the 1972 presidential campaign.
In an episode that seems somehow
quaint today, Sen. Muskie withdrew
from the race, after crying in front of
television cameras while responding to
spurious charges that he referred to
French Canadians as "Canucks."
Muskie's opponent, re-elected President
Richard Nixon, himself contributed to
the art of apologetics with his reluctant
resignation speech, which, although not
related to race, set the stage for the"I am
not a racist" theme heard today.
In the generation since, the list of
slurs turned into sorries has grown, sug
gesting simultaneously that we have
learned little, but also that we may be

looking at the wrong problem. A list of a
few of the many slip-of-the-tongue scan
dals, involving only race and related
traits and without considering undoubt
edly numerous, though sometimes invisi
ble, outrages involving gender and other
prejudices: Nancy Reagan, looking out
over a crowd, and saying "look at all
those beautiful white people"; would-be
billionaire-populist Ross Perot speaking
to the NAACP and addressing the audi
ence as "you people"; Francis Lawrence,
liberal university president, suggesting
that there is a "genetic hereditary" back
ground responsible for "a disadvantaged
population"; Jimmy Breslin, liberal
newspaper columnist, calling a colleague
behind her back, a "slant-eyed yellow
cur"; A 1 Campanis, baseball executive,
stating that African-American athletes
lack management "necessities"; Jimmy
"the Greek," sports commentator, stat
ing that African-American athletes are
naturally better because they were bred
that way; the late Howard Cosell, a
unique sports commentator, who retired
from the business after calling an
African-American football player "that
little monkey"; Marge Schott, baseball
team owner, with her Nazi paraphernalia
and too much else to count; General Carl
E. Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the
Marine Corps, opining that minority mil
itary officers could not shoot, swim or
navigate with compasses as well as
whites; U.S. Rep. Pete Stark calling an
African-American cabinet secretary, "a

disgrace to his race"; U.S. Rep. John Din
gell, referring to "little yellow men" tak
ing over the American economy; Trea
sury Secretary Nicholas Brady talking
casually about "Japs"; radio talk show
host Cliff Kincaid calling Connie Chung,
"Connie Chink"; California state legisla
tor Pete Knight's infamous reprint of a
poem, which he went out of his way to
copy and distribute, characterizing all
Latinos as illegal immigrants; another
California state legislator, Kathleen Hon
eycutt, using the word "Jew" as a verb
for unfair business tactics. .. .
A few other examples, ranging from
the touching to the strange: the family of
Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman
accused of killing her children, apologiz
ing for her fictitious claim that African-
American men kidnapped the victims,
reminiscent of the case of Charles Stuart,
the Boston man who killed his wife and
blamed an invented African-American
carjacker (in both cases, the accusations
touched off intense police activities
directed toward black men generally);
Pat Bowlen, owner of the Denver Bron
cos football team, calling opposing player
Jerry Rice, who is an African American,
"that Chinaman"; Andy Rooney, of "60
Minutes" television fame, explaining to a
