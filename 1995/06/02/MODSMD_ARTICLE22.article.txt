## Sorry? Who said sorry? 
### 
APOLOGIES IN America are rare;
apologies in public are rarely real.
Most recently, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato suffered a medical crisis to dra
matize his regret for race-related mock
ery of Judge Lance Ito. Now is an ideal
time to reflect on this political phe
nomenon of saying sorry without sinceri
ty, after everyone else has had their say
about the D'Amato-Ito incident. For if it
simply passes into the course of events,
the practitioners of doubletalk, brazen
but cowardly, will again have successful
ly said something wrong while saying
nothing at all.
The recent history of politicians and
public figures making racially-based
statements and subsequently issuing
retractions has an appropriately bizarre
beginning with Sen. Edmund Muskie
during the 1972 presidential campaign.
In an episode that seems somehow
quaint today, Sen. Muskie withdrew
from the race, after crying in front of
television cameras while responding to
spurious charges that he referred to
French Canadians as "Canucks."
Muskie's opponent, re-elected President
Richard Nixon, himself contributed to
the art of apologetics with his reluctant
resignation speech, which, although not
related to race, set the stage for the"I am
not a racist" theme heard today.
In the generation since, the list of
slurs turned into sorries has grown, sug
gesting simultaneously that we have
learned little, but also that we may be

looking at the wrong problem. A list of a
few of the many slip-of-the-tongue scan
dals, involving only race and related
traits and without considering undoubt
edly numerous, though sometimes invisi
ble, outrages involving gender and other
prejudices: Nancy Reagan, looking out
over a crowd, and saying "look at all
those beautiful white people"; would-be
billionaire-populist Ross Perot speaking
to the NAACP and addressing the audi
ence as "you people"; Francis Lawrence,
liberal university president, suggesting
that there is a "genetic hereditary" back
ground responsible for "a disadvantaged
population"; Jimmy Breslin, liberal
newspaper columnist, calling a colleague
behind her back, a "slant-eyed yellow
cur"; A 1 Campanis, baseball executive,
stating that African-American athletes
lack management "necessities"; Jimmy
"the Greek," sports commentator, stat
ing that African-American athletes are
naturally better because they were bred
that way; the late Howard Cosell, a
unique sports commentator, who retired
from the business after calling an
African-American football player "that
little monkey"; Marge Schott, baseball
team owner, with her Nazi paraphernalia
and too much else to count; General Carl
E. Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the
Marine Corps, opining that minority mil
itary officers could not shoot, swim or
navigate with compasses as well as
whites; U.S. Rep. Pete Stark calling an
African-American cabinet secretary, "a

disgrace to his race"; U.S. Rep. John Din
gell, referring to "little yellow men" tak
ing over the American economy; Trea
sury Secretary Nicholas Brady talking
casually about "Japs"; radio talk show
host Cliff Kincaid calling Connie Chung,
"Connie Chink"; California state legisla
tor Pete Knight's infamous reprint of a
poem, which he went out of his way to
copy and distribute, characterizing all
Latinos as illegal immigrants; another
California state legislator, Kathleen Hon
eycutt, using the word "Jew" as a verb
for unfair business tactics. .. .
A few other examples, ranging from
the touching to the strange: the family of
Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman
accused of killing her children, apologiz
ing for her fictitious claim that African-
American men kidnapped the victims,
reminiscent of the case of Charles Stuart,
the Boston man who killed his wife and
blamed an invented African-American
carjacker (in both cases, the accusations
touched off intense police activities
directed toward black men generally);
Pat Bowlen, owner of the Denver Bron
cos football team, calling opposing player
Jerry Rice, who is an African American,
"that Chinaman"; Andy Rooney, of "60
Minutes" television fame, explaining to a

gay and lesbian publication which
was interviewing him about earlier
homophobic remarks, "I've
believed all along that most people
are born with equal intelligence,
but blacks have watered down their
genes because the less intelligent
ones are the ones that have the
most children"; Marky Mark, near
ly nude Calvin Klein model, speak
ing through his manager, promis
ing to film videos against hate vio
lence to make up for his juvenile
record of assaulting and harassing
African Americans and Vietnamese
Americans; and the UCLA profes
sor a few years ago who asked
Asian-American students to sub
mit photographs with their final
projects so he would be able to
match names and faces.... While
it should be acknowledged that
African Americans, Asian Ameri
cans and others also can and do

make similar statements — some
times about racial minorities — it
is rare that a person of color has
enough power to give his senti
ments much general consequence.
The careful clarifications can be
as bad as the careless remarks. In a
series of statements, the speaker
perhaps implies, but does not go so
far as to admit, that he has done
something wrong. These false
apologies are maddening. They typ
ically go something like this: "If I
offended anyone, I apologize for
their feeling that way. I did not
mean what I said."
The non-apology is artful but
begrudging, a celebration of
hypocrisy. If it is believed, this
rhetoric without responsibility is
appalling on several levels.
It is offered tentatively, suggest
ing that nobody could seriously
take offense. It is projected at an
anonymous audience, suggesting
that anybody who does take offense
cannot be taken seriously. By its
phrasing, it not only blames the
victim but also takes responsibility

for his thoughts. By its own admis
sion, it is meaningless. It begs the
question of what the speaker, in
fact, did mean. Probably when he
made the original remark, he did
not mean "it""it" —"it" being no more
than trouble for himself. Perhaps
when he apologizes — "it had noth
ing to do with race" — he means it
had nothing negative to do with his
race but only with what he pre
sumes to be true about another
race.
The tactics used to avoid mak
ing amends are equally galling.
There are a few who try denying
that they even made the statement,
as if to insist you can play the tape
backwards to hear another word in
there, thus creating a diversionary
debate over the facts (similar to the
dispute about astronaut Neil Arm
strong's missing article in his
"giant step" after landing on the
moon). There are some who try the
"it was a joke" routine, with ner
vous laughter and another bad
quip; this is the ploy used by a suit
or who thinks he may be rejected.

Even assuming that it was meant
as a joke, and granting that it
might be funny in some contexts,
humor is highly revealing. There
are many who try pointing a finger
at the press, as if everything would
be better if it were private prejudice
expressed to a privileged audience.
And then there are the many
more who either express surprise
that anyone could interpret their
words as anything derogatory —
showing shock that another indi
vidual might be listening, much
less that the person himself might
also be heard complaining. Or they
protest that they are only giving
voice to what everyone else thinks
anyway, meaning what everyone
else like them really unthinkingly
assumes. Although the last pair of
explanations are no excuse, taken
together they may be the truth.
After all, it would be surprising if
legitimate dissent by a minority
were allowed to upset accepted
norms of the majority.
Nevertheless, apologies should
be given but not demanded. They

are not charitable acts, but neither
should they be regarded as tests of
power.
In the ritual of the apology,
regardless of its sincerity, some
thing is lost. The point is more
than whether an individual's
words were insulting or offensive
or hurtful. The point is whether
the individual's actions are right
and moral and justify the authority
and respect we have given over to
that person. The point is whether
we can have a meaningful dialogue,
whether we can talk to one anoth
er, without worrying whether what
is said is said in good faith. The
point is whether an apology con
ceals the truth and allows us to
avoid confronting an attitude that
is so ingrained as to be invisible.
Asking whether the speaker is a
"racist" is futile; the better ques
tion is, "What was he thinking any
way?"
With all that said, still, people
should be given the benefit of the
doubt. To use an apt sports
metaphor, we all should be allowed

a few fouls. Each of us might miss
peak or be misheard, or in a
moment of honesty realize that I,
too, can think that thought. Even
by a more forgiving standard, and
without benefit of Freudian analy
sis, plenty of people will fail them
selves and reveal their pattern of
prejudices. Better that apologies be
left to the apologetic, and real
racism be revealed by the unforgiv
en.
Our response should be to
explain what is wrong and why it is
wrong. Along the way, we can do
our best to appropriate the "bad"
words for our own use. If we can do
what gays and lesbians have done
with "queer," we will have won the
war of words. If we have won the
war of words, we can triumph in
the struggle. When each of us can
make the joke, rather than be
asked to take the joke, all of us will
have won.

Frank sends his best regards to all
Stanford students, even those who
work at The Reuiew.

team owner, with her Nazi paraphernalia
and too much else to count; General Carl
E. Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the
Marine Corps, opining that minority mil
itary officers could not shoot, swim or
navigate with compasses as well as
whites; U.S. Rep. Pete Stark calling an
African-American cabinet secretary, "a

disgrace to his race"; U.S. Rep. John Din
gell, referring to "little yellow men" tak
ing over the American economy; Trea
sury Secretary Nicholas Brady talking
casually about "Japs"; radio talk show
host Cliff Kincaid calling Connie Chung,
"Connie Chink"; California state legisla
tor Pete Knight's infamous reprint of a
poem, which he went out of his way to
copy and distribute, characterizing all
Latinos as illegal immigrants; another
California state legislator, Kathleen Hon
eycutt, using the word "Jew" as a verb
for unfair business tactics. .. .
A few other examples, ranging from
the touching to the strange: the family of
Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman
accused of killing her children, apologiz
ing for her fictitious claim that African-
American men kidnapped the victims,
reminiscent of the case of Charles Stuart,
the Boston man who killed his wife and
blamed an invented African-American
carjacker (in both cases, the accusations
touched off intense police activities
directed toward black men generally);
Pat Bowlen, owner of the Denver Bron
cos football team, calling opposing player
Jerry Rice, who is an African American,
"that Chinaman"; Andy Rooney, of "60
Minutes" television fame, explaining to a

gay and lesbian publication which
was interviewing him about earlier
homophobic remarks, "I've
believed all along that most people
are born with equal intelligence,
but blacks have watered down their
genes because the less intelligent
ones are the ones that have the
most children"; Marky Mark, near
ly nude Calvin Klein model, speak
ing through his manager, promis
ing to film videos against hate vio
lence to make up for his juvenile
record of assaulting and harassing
African Americans and Vietnamese
Americans; and the UCLA profes
sor a few years ago who asked
Asian-American students to sub
mit photographs with their final
projects so he would be able to
match names and faces.... While
it should be acknowledged that
African Americans, Asian Ameri
cans and others also can and do

make similar statements — some
times about racial minorities — it
is rare that a person of color has
enough power to give his senti
ments much general consequence.
The careful clarifications can be
as bad as the careless remarks. In a
series of statements, the speaker
perhaps implies, but does not go so
far as to admit, that he has done
something wrong. These false
apologies are maddening. They typ
ically go something like this: "If I
offended anyone, I apologize for
their feeling that way. I did not
mean what I said."
The non-apology is artful but
begrudging, a celebration of
hypocrisy. If it is believed, this
rhetoric without responsibility is
appalling on several levels.
It is offered tentatively, suggest
ing that nobody could seriously
take offense. It is projected at an
anonymous audience, suggesting
that anybody who does take offense
cannot be taken seriously. By its
phrasing, it not only blames the
victim but also takes responsibility

for his thoughts. By its own admis
sion, it is meaningless. It begs the
question of what the speaker, in
fact, did mean. Probably when he
made the original remark, he did
not mean "it""it" —"it" being no more
than trouble for himself. Perhaps
when he apologizes — "it had noth
ing to do with race" — he means it
had nothing negative to do with his
race but only with what he pre
sumes to be true about another
race.
The tactics used to avoid mak
ing amends are equally galling.
There are a few who try denying
that they even made the statement,
as if to insist you can play the tape
backwards to hear another word in
there, thus creating a diversionary
debate over the facts (similar to the
dispute about astronaut Neil Arm
strong's missing article in his
"giant step" after landing on the
moon). There are some who try the
"it was a joke" routine, with ner
vous laughter and another bad
quip; this is the ploy used by a suit
or who thinks he may be rejected.

Even assuming that it was meant
as a joke, and granting that it
might be funny in some contexts,
humor is highly revealing. There
are many who try pointing a finger
at the press, as if everything would
be better if it were private prejudice
expressed to a privileged audience.
And then there are the many
more who either express surprise
that anyone could interpret their
words as anything derogatory —
showing shock that another indi
vidual might be listening, much
less that the person himself might
also be heard complaining. Or they
protest that they are only giving
voice to what everyone else thinks
anyway, meaning what everyone
else like them really unthinkingly
assumes. Although the last pair of
explanations are no excuse, taken
together they may be the truth.
After all, it would be surprising if
legitimate dissent by a minority
were allowed to upset accepted
norms of the majority.
Nevertheless, apologies should
be given but not demanded. They

are not charitable acts, but neither
should they be regarded as tests of
power.
In the ritual of the apology,
regardless of its sincerity, some
thing is lost. The point is more
than whether an individual's
words were insulting or offensive
or hurtful. The point is whether
the individual's actions are right
and moral and justify the authority
and respect we have given over to
that person. The point is whether
we can have a meaningful dialogue,
whether we can talk to one anoth
er, without worrying whether what
is said is said in good faith. The
point is whether an apology con
ceals the truth and allows us to
avoid confronting an attitude that
is so ingrained as to be invisible.
Asking whether the speaker is a
"racist" is futile; the better ques
tion is, "What was he thinking any
way?"
With all that said, still, people
should be given the benefit of the
doubt. To use an apt sports
metaphor, we all should be allowed

a few fouls. Each of us might miss
peak or be misheard, or in a
moment of honesty realize that I,
too, can think that thought. Even
by a more forgiving standard, and
without benefit of Freudian analy
sis, plenty of people will fail them
selves and reveal their pattern of
prejudices. Better that apologies be
left to the apologetic, and real
racism be revealed by the unforgiv
en.
Our response should be to
explain what is wrong and why it is
wrong. Along the way, we can do
our best to appropriate the "bad"
words for our own use. If we can do
what gays and lesbians have done
with "queer," we will have won the
war of words. If we have won the
war of words, we can triumph in
the struggle. When each of us can
make the joke, rather than be
asked to take the joke, all of us will
have won.

APOLOGIES IN America are rare;
apologies in public are rarely real.
Most recently, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato suffered a medical crisis to dra
matize his regret for race-related mock
ery of Judge Lance Ito. Now is an ideal
time to reflect on this political phe
nomenon of saying sorry without sinceri
ty, after everyone else has had their say
about the D'Amato-Ito incident. For if it
simply passes into the course of events,
the practitioners of doubletalk, brazen
but cowardly, will again have successful
ly said something wrong while saying
nothing at all.
The recent history of politicians and
public figures making racially-based
statements and subsequently issuing
retractions has an appropriately bizarre
beginning with Sen. Edmund Muskie
during the 1972 presidential campaign.
In an episode that seems somehow
quaint today, Sen. Muskie withdrew
from the race, after crying in front of
television cameras while responding to
spurious charges that he referred to
French Canadians as "Canucks."
Muskie's opponent, re-elected President
Richard Nixon, himself contributed to
the art of apologetics with his reluctant
resignation speech, which, although not
related to race, set the stage for the"I am
not a racist" theme heard today.
In the generation since, the list of
slurs turned into sorries has grown, sug
gesting simultaneously that we have
learned little, but also that we may be

looking at the wrong problem. A list of a
few of the many slip-of-the-tongue scan
dals, involving only race and related
traits and without considering undoubt
edly numerous, though sometimes invisi
ble, outrages involving gender and other
prejudices: Nancy Reagan, looking out
over a crowd, and saying "look at all
those beautiful white people"; would-be
billionaire-populist Ross Perot speaking
to the NAACP and addressing the audi
ence as "you people"; Francis Lawrence,
liberal university president, suggesting
that there is a "genetic hereditary" back
ground responsible for "a disadvantaged
population"; Jimmy Breslin, liberal
newspaper columnist, calling a colleague
behind her back, a "slant-eyed yellow
cur"; A 1 Campanis, baseball executive,
stating that African-American athletes
lack management "necessities"; Jimmy
"the Greek," sports commentator, stat
ing that African-American athletes are
naturally better because they were bred
that way; the late Howard Cosell, a
unique sports commentator, who retired
from the business after calling an
African-American football player "that
little monkey"; Marge Schott, baseball
team owner, with her Nazi paraphernalia
and too much else to count; General Carl
E. Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the
Marine Corps, opining that minority mil
itary officers could not shoot, swim or
