Evan Chen's life depends on the kindness of strangers

I CAN UNDERSTAND, in some
sense, Curtis Chen's letter yester
day criticizing the campaign to find
a bone marrow match for Evan Chen.
Evan is my best friend, and we've been
through a lot in all the years that
we've known one another. Each time I
go up to someone to pass out a flyer or
write a letter asking for help, I have a
lifetime of memories to call on, a life
time of shared tears, joys, petty argu
ments, molehills we made into moun
tains and mountains we'd climb about
halfway up, then decide to go home in
order to catch the"The Simpsons" on
TV.
What the past few weeks have
taught me, in a rather brutal way, is
that not everyone is going to be feel
the same way as I do. For every person
who is willing to make an effort on
their own, there are far more who will
not. As Curtis says, life is tough
already, and a lot of people could really
care less. But for most of us, it's never
a question of whether we'll even have
that life or not. For all the heartbreaks
and trials we face each day, stop and
imagine how life must appear through
Evan's eyes — not knowing if you'll be

alive a month from now, and living
with the knowledge that your life
hangs on the individual kindnesses of
thousands of people you've never even
seen.
We all still have some measure of
control over what happens to us, such
as what we do with our time, and in
Curtis' case, whether or not he objects
to our infringement on his privacy and
refuses to get typed. But for Evan,
there is no choice. He himself can't do
anything other than to lie in bed,
thinking of all the things he may never
do and never see. How can we, his
friends and his family, just sit there
and quietly watch him die?
We could hope, in an ideal world,
that all of us would have enough mutu
al respect and consideration for each
other that everyone would contribute
when the need arose. Yet the reality is
that for most people, until a similar
tragedy happens to themselves or to
someone close to them, catastrophes
which befall anonymous people are, at
most, an annoyance — an annoyance
for having to deal with it and an annoy
ance because deep within themselves,
there is a slight tinge of guilt.

How many times have we all passed
by a homeless person begging for food,
only to walk away and put it out of our
minds because we knew that if we
thought about it too much, our con
sciences would tear at us? Again, as
Curtis concluded, life's tough already,
and we don't need to make it any more
unpleasant. Well, there aren't many
things more unpleasant than witness
ing the death of another human being.
It's easier to put it out of sight and out
of mind.
The great majority of people, howev
er, will care once they have really
thought about the issue. Seeing a
poster with a lot of exclamation marks
isn't going to register much time in the
old noggin. I wish it were that simple.
On the other hand, talking to someone
who's out there because his friend is
dying, will. And honestly, I truly am
sorry for having made anyone uncom
fortable or inconveniencing them dur
ing this whole effort. Believe me, I
don't want to be doing this either. But
it seemed to me that it was a greater
crime not even to try than to ask some
one for a moment of their time.
It's true that cancer is killing Evan.

No one inflicted him with it, and no
one is obligated to go out of their way
to save him. But to hide ourselves
behind that literal truth is a cheap
excuse in itself. It is just as true that
our own apathy and hard-heartedness
would be to blame if he could be saved
given enough effort, and is not. I agree
wholeheartedly that every person has a
right to their privacy, but we are not
talking about some cheap set of ginsu
knives. What's at stake is not a vague,
far-off ideal which is dubious in itself,
but Evan Chen — a Stanford sopho
more, a real person who cares and
laughs and hopes just like we all do.
To be honest, when I read Curtis'
letter yesterday, I very nearly cried.
Even though I can understand why he
feels the way he does in a rational
sense, in my inner heart, I can't just
stand by and let my best friend die.
It's not that people ought to go out of
their way to help solve the world's
problems on their own. But if someone
is desperate and asks you for your
help, is it really too much to listen? I
guess for some people, it is.
