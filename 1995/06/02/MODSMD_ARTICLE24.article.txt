# When you have a burn or any ailment, do not call on health services
## 
### 
If you ever need medical advice,
don't go through Stanford's health
services. This past weekend I burned
my foot. Not knowing how serious it
was, I called trusty Stanford Hospital.
I asked one of the nurses whether or
not I should make the trek over. She
said, "If you feel you need medical
attention, then come; if not, don't." I
obviously didn't have the knowledge to
judge whether or not I needed help,

which is why I phoned them in the
first place. Trying a different
approach, I asked her how to treat it.
She replied, "We treat different burns
in different ways." Thinking that she
needed more information, I described
the burn, the level of blistering, loca
tion, etc. She said, "We treat different
burns in different ways." Good medical
knowledge, but not really what I want
ed to hear. Giving up, I decided to go
through our other trusty health ser
vice, Cowell.
When I called Cowell I reached an
answering machine that said, "Cow
ell's regular hours are from nine to
five, Monday through Friday. Urgent
care is available. . . . Call 3-4861." I

felt a little guilty since my problem
wasn't very urgent, but since I was
kind of frustrated at this point, I
called urgent care. "Stanford operator,
how can I help you?" Huh? Stanford
operator? Oops. I thought I'd dialed
for urgent care. I hung up, then dialed
again. "Stanford operator." Okey
dokey. While she wasn't the ideal med
ical assistance, she was the best I'd
had all day, so I asked for her help.
"Oh, they must have forwarded you
to us because they're closed. I'll put
you through to the advice nurse".
Well, at least I knew why I was talking
to an operator in the first place. So, I
waited patiently while I was trans
ferred to the advice nurse. "Hi, I have

a burn on my foot, and I really don't
know what to do." Her answer?
"Sorry, we don't give advice here".
Thanks a lot. I was so frustrated by
this point that I decided to call it quits
for the day. The burn hurt, but it
wasn't worth the enormous effort. So
Tuesday, I called Cowell for advice.
After being transferred and put on
hold for 22 minutes, I was told to put
some Neosporin and gauze on it. A
simple answer to my simple question.
I learned that if you ever need medi
cal advice, don't bother with Stan
ford's health services. It's an endless
bureaucratic maze.
