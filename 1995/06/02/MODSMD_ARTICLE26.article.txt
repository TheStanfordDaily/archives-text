## Steven Jaffe Internet relationships are no substitute for the real thing

A FRIEND in New
York showed the
CD-ROM game,
Myst. With 3D-model
ing, realistic quick-time
movies and eerie digi
tized sound, Myst is
more an interactive film
than a game. "The sur
realistic adventure
game that will become

your world," it proclaims, and that's no
joke. The game is a simulacra over
whelming like Disneyland. Only physical

hunger carried me from Myst's hallucino
genic trees and ethereal fog into a Green
wich Village restaurant.
This is the communications age.
Whoopee. In French class, on a laptop, I
can e-mail a cousin in Delaware. At my
old elementary school now, the Macin
tosh computers seem stranger than the
knee-high urinals.
When I was ten, the Atari 2600 was
hot, but playing soccer or football with
friends was better. Things are different
for kids now. With games like Myst, the
Internet and the World Wide Web
expanding, the virtual world can overtake
the actual. We, as college students, ought
to reflect, because no generation forever

after will recall a childhood before video
games. All those Paly High kids at Juice
Club were preschoolers when Atari came
out, and they grew up with Game√üoy and
Sega.
The effects of virtual technology and
the Internet on our social interaction are
not obvious. On one hand, portable com
puters allow us to work at home or in
transit, and such virtual commuting
could reduce traffic and fuel consump
tion. However, as the line between home
and work blurs, new problems arise. A
couple writes in a Boston Globe article of
last spring, "We finally banned the
powerbook from our bedroom."
Here is a dream: I am elderly, writing

to my grandson through my laptop. He
has just finished throwing a virtual base
ball with his father who is on a business
trip. "It was great," he sends me, "I can
throw a curveball." I recall playing catch
with my father, the baseball reeking of
freshly cut grass. "That's nice," I send
him, but I say no more. He can never
know that smell.
The media proclaims e-mail is the
manna of world-wide unity. That's a
grand idea, but a million grand ideas
won't change the strained relationship
with my father. We haven't spoken since
Thanksgiving. The Internet helps us pre
tend we have a decent relationship. I e
mailed him a birthday message. Our occa-

sional e-mail exchange is a little better
than not speaking at all, but not much.
Pull the plug, and our relationship goes
down with it.
Yesterday was my birthday. My father
left a message on my answering machine,
abandoning e-mail. Is this a progression?
I'd like to think technology can carry our
relationship. It can't. No matter how life
like games like Myst become, no matter
how the Internet spreads, human rela
tionships will always require mainte
nance. Despite its savvy graphics and dig
itized sound, the information highway
can not drive me closer to my father. We
must walk toward each other in a physi
cal universe.
