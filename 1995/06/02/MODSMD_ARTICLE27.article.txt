# COP sees relative gains despite communication complaints
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
When viewed in absolute terms, the
output of this year's Council of Presi
dents may not look like much. But in rel
ative terms, this year's COP has accom
plished a great deal, according to mem
bers of the COP, ASSU Senate and Uni
versity administration.
Among the initiatives that COP mem
bers Anietie Ekanem, Mork Murdock,
Lisa Lee and Vanessa Alvarado claim as
achievements are the rewriting of the
Stanford Eund policy, obtaining Univer
sity funding for SURE Escort Service,
creating an ASSU dorm representative
system, overhauling the election process
and improving relations with the senate,
administration and students.
But despite these successes, the COP
failed to deliver on some of its promises
— including the creation of a student
coursebook and a graduate student hand
book. Nor did it finish some of the pro
jects it began, notably reforming Food
Service, improving student mail delivery
and reorganizing Tresidder Union.
And some senators claim that the
COP did not foster sufficient communi
cation with the senate or the students
they represent.
According to Murdock, the COP's
accomplishments compare favorably
with those of past presidents and have
bequeathed a strong foundation for next
year's COP and senate. Murdock pointed
to the establishment of a solid working
relationship with the administration and
the initiation of work on several issues
which are important to students.
Indeed, University President Ger
hard Casper said he was pleased with the
performance of this year's COP. "I was
delighted with the COP," Casper said.
"They worked very vigorously on issues
that concerned them. They were effec
tive in dealing with [Provost Condoleez
za Ricel and me."
Some members of the senate agree
with Casper's assessment of the COP.
"They are leaving big shoes for the
incoming COP to fill," said undergradu
ate senator Bill Shen, a member of Peo
ple's Platform, the party of both the cur
rent and incoming COPs.
"What amazes me was their ability to
bring together their different talents and
their personalities to form a team that
was as productive as they were," Shen
added. "I think the glue that kept them
together was a common vision for serv
ing the students."
But undergraduate senator Stephen

Russell, who belongs to the Students'
Alliance party, disagreed: "This year's
COP was probably more successful on a
few specific issues than many past COPs;
however, they were unable to accomplish
a large number of their goals."
Russell said that the COP's mixed
results were due to its occasional stray
ing from issues of student concern. "The
COP was good at [its] commitment to
students," he said. "When they focused
on core student concerns, they per
formed admirably. When they drifted
from those concerns we became mired in
often meaningless political debate."
The highlights
Among the year's biggest successes
which COP members point to was the
drafting of a new Stanford Fund plan.
Early last fall, the University drafted
a policy which would have required all
student groups to fund raise through the
Office of Development. In response to
student criticism, the University formed
a working group composed of four
administrators, two senators and two
COP members to formulate a new policy.
"The administration decided to pur
sue a decision which would have hurt

many student groups in
terms of their ability to
support themselves,"
Murdock said. "What we
were able to come out
with was not something
that gave students
everything they wanted,
but it was something
that allowed student
groups to support them
selves."

The Stanford Fund group also set a
precedent for future University-student
relations, Murdock added. He said he
thought the model could be applied in
future situations when there is a break
down in communication between the
administration and students.
Another highlight was getting the
University to fund SURE Escort Service
in the future, Murdock said. "SURE was
something that should not be paid for by
the special-fee system. It is something
that the University ought to invest in for
the long-term," he said.
Additionally, the COP changed the
ASSU elections voting system to a World
Wide Web-based procedure, Murdock
said.
"It allowed students to have access to
instant information about candidates
and what was on the ballot while they
were voting," Murdock said. "It made it

easier to vote and was more accessible to
students.
"As a result, this year we saw an
improved turn-out among all undergrad
uates," he added. "Also, we were really
able to turn around elections results
much quicker and reduce the cost of the
election."
Mixed reactions
The reactions to other COP accom
plishments are more mixed. With regard
to communication between the senate
and the COP, some senators, particular
ly those from the opposing Students'
Alliance party, said they thought the
COP essentially only worked with mem
bers of its own party.
"I wish the COP had done more to
increase communication with the sen
ate," Russell said. "I know they
increased communication among mem
bers of their own party. As we saw in the
controversy surrounding the Students'
Rights Initiative, independents and
Alliance members were often ignored."
The initiative, a Students' Alliance-spon
sored plan to put four proposed constitu
tional amendments on the spring ballot,
was ruled ineligible by ASSU Elections
Commissioner Jonathan Berent for pro
cedural reasons.
Yet Shen said that he felt the COP did
a good job communicating with the sen
ate, especially the newer members.
"As a newcomer this year to the
ASSU, I felt the COP was extremely open
to new ideas and new projects," he said.
"They were a tremendous help to the sen
ate in terms of providing leadership and
guidance for those less experienced."
Nanci Howe, director of the Office of
Student Activities, said this year's COP
erased all traces of the gap between the
administration and the ASSU which
resulted from the absence of a COP two
years ago.
"I think they were a great group,"
Howe said. "They worked well together
and that is important for a COP. They
represented student interests very well.
They put in the time to come up with
solutions to difficult issues."
Ekanem said he thought this year's
good rapport with the administration
was due to mutual respect.
"We worked really well with the
administration because we have a long
history with the administration and they
knew where we were coming from,"
Ekanem said. "They see now that when
the COP talks, they mean what they say.
We're not afraid to take issues to the stu
dents. They now know if a decision is

made that concerns students, we will be
there."
A relationship with students?
However, the COP's relationship with
the students — arguably its most impor
tant one — was much more problematic.
Lee said she thought that the COP
created a stronger bond to students.
"When students were interested in
issues — whether they have complaints
or things to contribute — they came to
the ASSU," Lee said.
But many students still have little
idea who the members of the COP are
and what they have done for students
this year.

"At times I suppose it
was difficult for the COP
to communicate their
accomplishments to the
students," Shen said.
"I think the ASSU
and the COP have to do
a stronger job of commu
nicating with the stu
dent body," said junior
Michael Choo, a member

of next year's COP. "At times it is hard
for students to understand the relevance
of the ASSU and student government in
their lives."
However, Choo said he thought this
year's COP members did a better job
than their predecessors in engaging stu
dents.
One attempt at solving the problem of
student apathy was the dorm represen
tative program which the COP began
this year. Under the program, each
undergraduate dormitory chose a stu
dent liaison who met with the COP and
reported back to members of the dorm.
"The dorm rep system brought people
into ASSU who had never been part of
the ASSU," Ekanem said. "It is a suc
cessful link between the ASSU and the
people on campus in general."
One indication of the program's suc
cess is the number of former dorm reps
who are now in the senate, Ekanem
added.
Yet, Murdock said that while the
dorm rep program was successful at the
beginning, it gradually fell apart.
Also, it is not clear that the criticism
and ideas expressed by dorm reps were
ever acted on. Russell said that he never
saw any feedback generated by the dorm
rep program brought to the senate floor.
Shen disagreed, saying "the dorm reps
were instrumental in the COP's grass
roots campaign to reform postal service
as well as assisting with campus safety

issues and the [Commission on Under
graduate Education] surveys."
Overall, Shen said, it is more impor
tant for the COP to do projects for stu
dents than to communicate with them.
"Being the COP is not like winning a
popularity contest," Shen said. "It is
more important for the COP to spend
time working to enhance our Stanford
experience, instead of spending their time
and student money on self-promotion."
Unfulfilled promises
Despite accomplishing several objec
tives, the COP failed to deliver on some
of the goals it set early in the year, such
as writing a student coursebook and a
graduate student handbook.
Ekanem said that the coursebook was
meant to be a long-term project which
will be finished next year. He added that
the reason the graduate student hand
book did not get done is that graduate
senators did not want to help with the
project.
Some of the most significant issues
that the COP took on this year — includ
ing Food Service quality, the post office
and the reorganization of the service and
facilities in Tresidder — did not get com
pleted, Ekanem said.
While a working group was formed to
address the problems with Food Service
— such as meal plan structures, the
inequity between meals and points and
the quality of the food — little was actu
ally accomplished, Murdock said.
Reorganizing Tresidder will also take
time. "We tried to work on Tresidder this
year, addressing everything from the
type of businesses to the general format
of Tresidder," Ekanem said. "We are
working with the Tresidder management
. . . to make it more suited to student
needs. The only thing that held us up
was that there were so many changes in
management."
Ekanem said that the COP ran into "a
bureaucratic nightmare from the federal
government" in trying to reform the post
office. "It's something we have no con
trol over," he said.
Many of the COP's efforts this year
have laid a base for future presidents.
But it remains just that — a base, which
next year's COP will have to carry one
step further.
"I think the COP did a lot of work in
laying foundation for next year's COP to
be more effective," Choo said. "This COP
reacted to certain polices that affect stu
dents groups. The job for the incoming
COP is to have more proactive communi
cation and less reactive communication."

Some of the most significant issues
that the COP took on this year — includ
ing Food Service quality, the post office
and the reorganization of the service and
facilities in Tresidder — did not get com
pleted, Ekanem said.
While a working group was formed to
address the problems with Food Service
— such as meal plan structures, the
inequity between meals and points and
the quality of the food — little was actu
ally accomplished, Murdock said.
Reorganizing Tresidder will also take
time. "We tried to work on Tresidder this
year, addressing everything from the
type of businesses to the general format
of Tresidder," Ekanem said. "We are
working with the Tresidder management
. . . to make it more suited to student
needs. The only thing that held us up
was that there were so many changes in
management."
Ekanem said that the COP ran into "a
bureaucratic nightmare from the federal
government" in trying to reform the post
office. "It's something we have no con
trol over," he said.
Many of the COP's efforts this year
have laid a base for future presidents.
But it remains just that — a base, which
next year's COP will have to carry one
step further.
"I think the COP did a lot of work in
laying foundation for next year's COP to
be more effective," Choo said. "This COP
reacted to certain polices that affect stu
dents groups. The job for the incoming
COP is to have more proactive communi
cation and less reactive communication."

Ekanem
When viewed in absolute terms, the
output of this year's Council of Presi
dents may not look like much. But in rel
ative terms, this year's COP has accom
plished a great deal, according to mem
bers of the COP, ASSU Senate and Uni
versity administration.
Among the initiatives that COP mem
bers Anietie Ekanem, Mork Murdock,
Lisa Lee and Vanessa Alvarado claim as
achievements are the rewriting of the
Stanford Eund policy, obtaining Univer
sity funding for SURE Escort Service,
creating an ASSU dorm representative
system, overhauling the election process
and improving relations with the senate,
administration and students.
But despite these successes, the COP
failed to deliver on some of its promises
— including the creation of a student
coursebook and a graduate student hand
book. Nor did it finish some of the pro
jects it began, notably reforming Food
Service, improving student mail delivery
and reorganizing Tresidder Union.
And some senators claim that the
COP did not foster sufficient communi
cation with the senate or the students
they represent.
According to Murdock, the COP's
accomplishments compare favorably
with those of past presidents and have
bequeathed a strong foundation for next
year's COP and senate. Murdock pointed
to the establishment of a solid working
relationship with the administration and
the initiation of work on several issues
which are important to students.
Indeed, University President Ger
hard Casper said he was pleased with the
performance of this year's COP. "I was
delighted with the COP," Casper said.
"They worked very vigorously on issues
that concerned them. They were effec
tive in dealing with [Provost Condoleez
za Ricel and me."
Some members of the senate agree
with Casper's assessment of the COP.
"They are leaving big shoes for the
incoming COP to fill," said undergradu
ate senator Bill Shen, a member of Peo
ple's Platform, the party of both the cur
rent and incoming COPs.
"What amazes me was their ability to
bring together their different talents and
their personalities to form a team that
was as productive as they were," Shen
added. "I think the glue that kept them
together was a common vision for serv
ing the students."
But undergraduate senator Stephen

Russell, who belongs to the Students'
Alliance party, disagreed: "This year's
COP was probably more successful on a
few specific issues than many past COPs;
however, they were unable to accomplish
a large number of their goals."
Russell said that the COP's mixed
results were due to its occasional stray
ing from issues of student concern. "The
COP was good at [its] commitment to
students," he said. "When they focused
on core student concerns, they per
formed admirably. When they drifted
from those concerns we became mired in
often meaningless political debate."
The highlights
Among the year's biggest successes
which COP members point to was the
drafting of a new Stanford Fund plan.
Early last fall, the University drafted
a policy which would have required all
student groups to fund raise through the
Office of Development. In response to
student criticism, the University formed
a working group composed of four
administrators, two senators and two
COP members to formulate a new policy.
"The administration decided to pur
sue a decision which would have hurt

many student groups in
terms of their ability to
support themselves,"
Murdock said. "What we
were able to come out
with was not something
that gave students
everything they wanted,
but it was something
that allowed student
groups to support them
selves."

The Stanford Fund group also set a
precedent for future University-student
relations, Murdock added. He said he
thought the model could be applied in
future situations when there is a break
down in communication between the
administration and students.
Another highlight was getting the
University to fund SURE Escort Service
in the future, Murdock said. "SURE was
something that should not be paid for by
the special-fee system. It is something
that the University ought to invest in for
the long-term," he said.
Additionally, the COP changed the
ASSU elections voting system to a World
Wide Web-based procedure, Murdock
said.
"It allowed students to have access to
instant information about candidates
and what was on the ballot while they
were voting," Murdock said. "It made it

easier to vote and was more accessible to
students.
"As a result, this year we saw an
improved turn-out among all undergrad
uates," he added. "Also, we were really
able to turn around elections results
much quicker and reduce the cost of the
election."
Mixed reactions
The reactions to other COP accom
plishments are more mixed. With regard
to communication between the senate
and the COP, some senators, particular
ly those from the opposing Students'
Alliance party, said they thought the
COP essentially only worked with mem
bers of its own party.
"I wish the COP had done more to
increase communication with the sen
ate," Russell said. "I know they
increased communication among mem
bers of their own party. As we saw in the
controversy surrounding the Students'
Rights Initiative, independents and
Alliance members were often ignored."
The initiative, a Students' Alliance-spon
sored plan to put four proposed constitu
tional amendments on the spring ballot,
was ruled ineligible by ASSU Elections
Commissioner Jonathan Berent for pro
cedural reasons.
Yet Shen said that he felt the COP did
a good job communicating with the sen
ate, especially the newer members.
"As a newcomer this year to the
ASSU, I felt the COP was extremely open
to new ideas and new projects," he said.
"They were a tremendous help to the sen
ate in terms of providing leadership and
guidance for those less experienced."
Nanci Howe, director of the Office of
Student Activities, said this year's COP
erased all traces of the gap between the
administration and the ASSU which
resulted from the absence of a COP two
years ago.
"I think they were a great group,"
Howe said. "They worked well together
and that is important for a COP. They
represented student interests very well.
They put in the time to come up with
solutions to difficult issues."
Ekanem said he thought this year's
good rapport with the administration
was due to mutual respect.
"We worked really well with the
administration because we have a long
history with the administration and they
knew where we were coming from,"
Ekanem said. "They see now that when
the COP talks, they mean what they say.
We're not afraid to take issues to the stu
dents. They now know if a decision is

made that concerns students, we will be
there."
A relationship with students?
However, the COP's relationship with
the students — arguably its most impor
tant one — was much more problematic.
Lee said she thought that the COP
created a stronger bond to students.
"When students were interested in
issues — whether they have complaints
or things to contribute — they came to
the ASSU," Lee said.
But many students still have little
idea who the members of the COP are
and what they have done for students
this year.

"At times I suppose it
was difficult for the COP
to communicate their
accomplishments to the
students," Shen said.
"I think the ASSU
and the COP have to do
a stronger job of commu
nicating with the stu
dent body," said junior
Michael Choo, a member

of next year's COP. "At times it is hard
for students to understand the relevance
of the ASSU and student government in
their lives."
However, Choo said he thought this
year's COP members did a better job
than their predecessors in engaging stu
dents.
One attempt at solving the problem of
student apathy was the dorm represen
tative program which the COP began
this year. Under the program, each
undergraduate dormitory chose a stu
dent liaison who met with the COP and
reported back to members of the dorm.
"The dorm rep system brought people
into ASSU who had never been part of
the ASSU," Ekanem said. "It is a suc
cessful link between the ASSU and the
people on campus in general."
One indication of the program's suc
cess is the number of former dorm reps
who are now in the senate, Ekanem
added.
Yet, Murdock said that while the
dorm rep program was successful at the
beginning, it gradually fell apart.
Also, it is not clear that the criticism
and ideas expressed by dorm reps were
ever acted on. Russell said that he never
saw any feedback generated by the dorm
rep program brought to the senate floor.
Shen disagreed, saying "the dorm reps
were instrumental in the COP's grass
roots campaign to reform postal service
as well as assisting with campus safety

issues and the [Commission on Under
graduate Education] surveys."
Overall, Shen said, it is more impor
tant for the COP to do projects for stu
dents than to communicate with them.
"Being the COP is not like winning a
popularity contest," Shen said. "It is
more important for the COP to spend
time working to enhance our Stanford
experience, instead of spending their time
and student money on self-promotion."
Unfulfilled promises
Despite accomplishing several objec
tives, the COP failed to deliver on some
of the goals it set early in the year, such
as writing a student coursebook and a
graduate student handbook.
Ekanem said that the coursebook was
meant to be a long-term project which
will be finished next year. He added that
the reason the graduate student hand
book did not get done is that graduate
senators did not want to help with the
project.
Some of the most significant issues
that the COP took on this year — includ
ing Food Service quality, the post office
and the reorganization of the service and
facilities in Tresidder — did not get com
pleted, Ekanem said.
