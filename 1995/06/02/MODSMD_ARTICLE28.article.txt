## Baseball tries to don glass slippers Cinderella eight seed opens World Series vs. Fullerton 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
This year's College World
Series could be dubbed David vs.
the proverbial Goliaths of college
baseball. But anybody who knows
anything about the Stanford
squad knows better than to count
the little guy out.
In place of that deadly sling
shot, the Cardinal brings bull's
eye pitching and clutch plate per
formances into its first appear
ance in Omaha since 1990.

'We know a little bit
about Fullerton ...
and we know we can
beat them.'
-Mark Marquess

Following an emotional week
end in Wichita, Kan., where Stan
ford (39-23) outpaced the field
and earned a spot in the champi
onship tournament, the 10th
ranked and eighth-seeded Cardi
nal will face top-ranked Cal State-
Fullerton (53-9) on Saturday in
the first round of the double
elimination tourney. The contest
will be broadcast live on CBS,
with the first pitch crossing the
plate at 11:36 am PDT.
"We aren't approaching this
game any differently than we did
the regional competition," said
head coach Mark Marquess of his
squad's mindset going into the
week of competition. "The good
thing is that we know a little bit
about Fullerton, having played
them three times. And we know
we can beat them."
History paints a promising pic
ture for the Cardinal, who played
the Titans tough in all three
meetings of the squads in Fuller
ton early in the regular season.

Stanford went 1-2 against the
eventual Big West Conference
champions, losing by only two
runs in both defeats. The Cardi
nal collected an average of 12 hits
in those games against Titan
hurlers and scored an average of
eight runs.
"We are going to have to do the
same things that we have been
doing all year long," Marquess
said. "Pitch well, hit well and have
an outstanding all-around game."
The squad did all of those
things during the Midwest I
Regional. Stanford gave up only
23 runs in its six games of the
tournament and saved its bullpen
with four complete games. Fresh
man right-hander Kyle Peterson
(13-1) went all nine frames twice
for the Cardinal, the second time
in the final game against top
seeded Texas Tech in the second
championship contest. The two
performances earned Peterson
the most outstanding player
award. Stanford had to win three
games in a row and beat the Red
Raiders twice in 16 hours to
advance to Omaha.
The biggest improvement for
Stanford came in its pitching.
The Cardinal got complete games
from Peterson, junior southpaw
Mike Robbins and junior right
hander Mario Iglesias. Stanford
dipped into the bullpen only twice
in the entire tourney, both for
short stints after the game had
already been put out of reach.
CSUF is in the series by way of
a come-from-behind victory over
the Rice Owls in the championship
game of that regional tournament.
The Titans came from four runs
down to win but managed only
eight hits in the game. It was only
the 15th time in 62 games this
year that Fullerton has been held
to under 10 hits in a game.
Neither Stanford nor CSF is a
stranger to the ambiance of the
