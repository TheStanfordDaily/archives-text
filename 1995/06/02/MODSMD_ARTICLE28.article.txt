## Baseball tries to don glass slippers Cinderella eight seed opens World Series vs. Fullerton 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
This year's College World
Series could be dubbed David vs.
the proverbial Goliaths of college
baseball. But anybody who knows
anything about the Stanford
squad knows better than to count
the little guy out.
In place of that deadly sling
shot, the Cardinal brings bull's
eye pitching and clutch plate per
formances into its first appear
ance in Omaha since 1990.

'We know a little bit
about Fullerton ...
and we know we can
beat them.'
-Mark Marquess

Following an emotional week
end in Wichita, Kan., where Stan
ford (39-23) outpaced the field
and earned a spot in the champi
onship tournament, the 10th
ranked and eighth-seeded Cardi
nal will face top-ranked Cal State-
Fullerton (53-9) on Saturday in
the first round of the double
elimination tourney. The contest
will be broadcast live on CBS,
with the first pitch crossing the
plate at 11:36 am PDT.
"We aren't approaching this
game any differently than we did
the regional competition," said
head coach Mark Marquess of his
squad's mindset going into the
week of competition. "The good
thing is that we know a little bit
about Fullerton, having played
them three times. And we know
we can beat them."
History paints a promising pic
ture for the Cardinal, who played
the Titans tough in all three
meetings of the squads in Fuller
ton early in the regular season.

Stanford went 1-2 against the
eventual Big West Conference
champions, losing by only two
runs in both defeats. The Cardi
nal collected an average of 12 hits
in those games against Titan
hurlers and scored an average of
eight runs.
"We are going to have to do the
same things that we have been
doing all year long," Marquess
said. "Pitch well, hit well and have
an outstanding all-around game."
The squad did all of those
things during the Midwest I
Regional. Stanford gave up only
23 runs in its six games of the
tournament and saved its bullpen
with four complete games. Fresh
man right-hander Kyle Peterson
(13-1) went all nine frames twice
for the Cardinal, the second time
in the final game against top
seeded Texas Tech in the second
championship contest. The two
performances earned Peterson
the most outstanding player
award. Stanford had to win three
games in a row and beat the Red
Raiders twice in 16 hours to
advance to Omaha.
The biggest improvement for
Stanford came in its pitching.
The Cardinal got complete games
from Peterson, junior southpaw
Mike Robbins and junior right
hander Mario Iglesias. Stanford
dipped into the bullpen only twice
in the entire tourney, both for
short stints after the game had
already been put out of reach.
CSUF is in the series by way of
a come-from-behind victory over
the Rice Owls in the championship
game of that regional tournament.
The Titans came from four runs
down to win but managed only
eight hits in the game. It was only
the 15th time in 62 games this
year that Fullerton has been held
to under 10 hits in a game.
Neither Stanford nor CSF is a
stranger to the ambiance of the

World Series. The Cardinal will be
making its ninth appearance in
Omaha, having been there three
of four years before 1990 and won
the national championship in
1987 and 1988. Fullerton, the Big
West champion, is also in the final
eight for the ninth time and
boasts two previous national
titles. The Titans are making
their second trip in a row to
Omaha and their third in four
years.
Robbins will take the mound
on Saturday for Stanford. He is
coming off a brilliant complete
game outing in Wichita, perhaps
the best outing of his Cardinal
career. Fullerton is expected not
to pitch its Ail-American ace Ted
Silva (15-1) in order to save him
for the June 10 championship
game. But the Titans have a slew
of pitchers with less than two
losses on the year that could make
the first start and give Stanford
major league troubles.
Fullerton is led by sophomore
center fielder Mark Kotsay, who
also doubles as a closer for the
Titans. He hit .413 during the
season with 18 homers and 80
RBIs. t
The Cardinal has a few stand
outs of its cwn. Junior catcher
A.J. Hinch, who hit close to .400
during the regular season, put up

brilliant numbers in Wichita en
route to making the all-tourna
ment squad. Senior third base
man Steve Carver sent four balls
out of the park during the region
al competition, and six of the
Stanford starters hit better than
.300 in the tourney. Carver,
junior second baseman Brian Dal
limore, freshman outfielder Joe
Kilburg joined Hinch on the
regional all-tournament team.
Stanford's second opponent
will be either Clemson (54-12),
the fourth seed, or fifth-seeded
Tennessee (52-14). The Tigers
hail from the Atlantic Coast Con
ference, where they struggled
with Florida State all season long,
and the Volunteers were the only
squad from the Southeastern
Conference's Eastern Division to
make the regionals.
The other side of the bracket
features second-seeded Florida
State (52-14), the third-seeded
Hurricanes from Miami (46-15),
the sixth-seeded USC Trojans
(45-19) and the seventh-seeded
Sooners from Oklahoma (42-14).
Oklahoma and Stanford are the
only squads that were not top
seeds in their regionals — the
Sooners were the No. 2 seed and
the Cardinal was a three.
The Six-Pac champion Tro
jans, who finished the year with
the No. 2 ranking in the polls,
were miffed at drawing such a
poor seed and will face the Big
East champion Hurricanes today.
The defending national champion

Sooners square off against the
Seminoles to open the Series
today at 12:36 p.m. PDT.
Although only seven West
Coast schools made the regional
tournament (and three from the
Pacific 10 Conference, all from
the Southern Division), the Six-
Pac joined the ACC (FSU and
Clemson) as the only conferences
with two squads in Omaha. Add
the Titans to the mix and the
West is represented as promi
nently as any region in the nation.
Fortunately for Stanford, the
biggest surprise among the eight
squads, there seems to be little
doubt that the Cardinal is playing
its best baseball of the entire year.
After losing its preseason No. 1
ranking due to several key injuries
and early defeats, Stanford strug
gled during the regular season and
was at one point on the verge of
not making a regional appearance.
But the team has won 11 of its last
13 and 17 of its last 22 games and
hardly resembles the Stanford
squad that dropped four in a row
in mid-April.
The turnaround has certainly
been impressive. Following the
Cardinal's defeat of Texas Tech in
regional play, one could not help
but overhear the Red Raider radio
broadcasters verbally wonder on
Stanford's mediocre record.
"I have no idea how this Stan
ford squad lost 22 games this sea
son," the broadcaster said.
"Unless they played Fullerton in
19 of them."
