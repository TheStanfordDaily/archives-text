Eight may be enough for Dick Van Patten; how
ever, eighth place wasn't enough to earn the Stan
ford sailing team a spot in the final round at the

Team Racing National Championships.
Going into the regatta, coach Steve Bourdow
and company were shooting for a berth in the final
four of the competition. Despite two days of
action-packed, intense, over-the-top, pull no
punches, no holds barred, roll your sleeves up, hit

where the sun don't shine sailing, Stanford
couldn't crack the elite tier of the field. Instead,
college sailing powerhouses Navy, Tufts and Old
Dominion secured themselves a shot at college
sailing's fabled cup, the Walter C. Wood Trophy.
The last spot in the final four will be decided in a
sudden death, do or die sail-off between UC-
Irvine, Dartmouth and College of Charleston.
Stanford isn't coming back to the Farm empty
handed. The Cardinal gave it that good old-fash
ioned college try and stormed out to a winning
record. Victories for Stanford came at the expense
of Wisconsin and Northwestern. Road blocks in
the form of Dartmouth, Navy and Western Wash
ington roughened Stanford's path to glory with
three defeats. Stanford finished the regatta with a
ho-hum 5-6 record.
Coach Steve Bourdow used a four-team rotation
throughout the 12 races. The boats skippered by
senior Charles Meade and junior Adam Lowry
spent the majority of the time on the water. Bour

your own party," said freshman

The disappointing Finish in the
regatta brings an end to the sail

more of a beginning than an end.
For a team loaded with freshman
talent, the future of Stanford sail
ing still burns bright.
