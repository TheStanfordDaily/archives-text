# Senate alters policy on secret research

Companies interested in using the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory for confi
dential proprietary research will now have ac
cess to the facility's high-intensity x-ray beams.
The Faculty Senate yesterday passed guide
lines that allow for proprietary research at the
laboratory, part of the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center.
The guidelines make an exception to Stan
ford's Secrecy in Research Policy, which stipu-
lates that research conducted by
Stanford faculty and students at
SLAC cannot be kept confidential.
The senate implemented that
policy in April 1969 after a contro
versy surrounding allegations of
classified military research on cam
pus.
According to the new guidelines,
companies — which might not
want to publish information about
research for competitive reasons —
can use the x-ray beams at SSRL
for their own research, provided
Stanford students and faculty are

not involved.
Applied Physics Prof. Robert
Byer, chair of the senate's Commit
tee on Research, said the guidelines
address "a crucial issue of allowing
companies to use these facilities for
research."
Of all national laboratories run
by the Department of Energy,
SLAC is the only one that does not
currently allow proprietary
research.
The DOE has complained that
"Stanford imposes those standards
[of publishing research] on indus
trial users who come to use this
facility for a week," said Arthur
Bienenstock, associate director of
SLAC for SSRL.
Stanford's research policy was

meant not to prevent proprietary
research, but to keep outside
industries from holding back the
publishing of students' or faculty
members' work for business pur
poses, Bienenstock said.
No more than 15 percent of the
SSRL beam time in a given 12-
month running period will be avail
able for proprietary research,
Bienenstock said, so the change in
the guidelines won't endanger
University research.
In addition, the resolution pro
vides for industrial research
expenses to be paid on a full-cost
recovery basis and the SLAC asso
ciate director to have oversight of
the "general nature of the
research."
