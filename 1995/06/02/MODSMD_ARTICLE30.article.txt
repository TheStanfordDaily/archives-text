# Men golfers move ahead
## Weather interrupts play as nine teams don't finish round 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
The Stanford men's golf team is at the top of
the leaderboard after two days at the NCAA
Championships â€” but might not be after two
rounds.
The skies of Columbus, Ohio, opened up in
the morning hours yesterday, causing a three
hour, 20 minute rain delay until almost noon. As
a result, 21 players from nine squads were
unable to finish the second round of play yester
day before sunset.
Of the 21 teams that completed play at the
par-72, 7,109-yard Scarlet Course yesterday, the
No. 2 Cardinal stood alone in first place with a 5-
over-par 581, two strokes better than top
ranked Oklahoma State. Although the Cardinal
moved up from the second-place slot it shared

with Florida State and
Texas at the start of the
day, Stanford struggled
with the weather and shot
a 292, three more than
Wednesday.
"I'm happy with where
we are," said head coach
Wally Goodwin. "Our
mindset should not change
from day one to day three.
Our kids are playing hard
and are not going to give
up."
West Regional champion
Arizona State all but gave
up their chance at the title
yesterday, as the first
round leader staggered to a
12-over-par 300 yesterday,

falling to the middle of the pack in 11th place.
"We just had a bad day," said Arizona State
head coach Randy Lein. "We're still in striking
distance, the way these guys are shooting, we
could come right back tomorrow and be at 10 or
12 under, and be right back where we were."
The squads on the course after the rain per
formed better as a whole. Florida State and New
Mexico stood at 3-over and 4-over-par respec
tively but remained on the course when play was
suspended.
Stanford fired a 3-under-par 141 on the back
nine, paced by freshman Tiger Woods, who
notched a 72 today to place him 1-over for the
tournament.
"I didn't pinpoint my shots like I wanted to,"
the most famous player in the tournament said.
"I figure it's a big advantage to hit the ball long
[in the rain] because you're basically playing
darts. The ball is just going to stick."
Stuck atop the Cardinal pack is senior Notah
Begay, although he "struggled a bit" en route to
a 74 that placed him at par for the first 36 holes.
Begay's topsy-turvy round included a double
bogey, four bogeys and four birdies. The other
three seniors all remain in close proximity to
Begay and Woods. Jerry Chang fired the high
round of the day, a 76 that leaves him 3-over for
the tourney. Casey Martin and William Yanagi
sawa posted twin 73's to check in at 4-over.
"William Yanagisawa came from oblivion like
he always does," Goodwin said. "William likes it
when it gets tough going."
Oklahoma State's Chris Tidland has found
nothing but easy going, leading the way with
back-to-back 69's after two rounds. Tidland is
playing in the same group with Woods, but says
the cameras haven't been a distraction.
"You know Tiger is playing a different level.
You have to disregard him. [If not], you'll hook
your shot 100 yards behind him.
"I think Tiger is the best player in college.
Everyone likes to see him play. I've seen Tiger
play under pressure and he's great. I'm sure a
lot of people came to Columbus this week not to
see the Memorial, but to see Tiger play."
The people who came to watch Woods will be
