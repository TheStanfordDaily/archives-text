# Road to cycling nationals ends in Reno
## 
### Rajen Sheth Contributing writer 
After an exhilarating victory at the
conference championships, the Stanford
cycling team now hopes to ride its wave
of momentum into this weekend's
National Collegiate Cycling Association
(NCCA) Nationals in Reno, Nev., and
bring home the national championship.
The team goes into the competition as
the top-ranked squad in the nation, but
it will face stiff competition both from
familiar schools and other schools from
across the country.
"I think we have a very good chance
at nationals," said freshman Scott
Upton. "After coming from behind to
win the WCCC [West Coast Cycling
Conference], I believe we are peaking at
the right time in the year to do some
serious damage at Reno."
The team is allowed to send five men
and five women. Three cyclists in each
category are picked based on total points
during the season, and the other two are
selected by coach Art Walker and the
team captains. The men's team will con
sist of grad students Dave Bailey,
Takeshi Doi and Dario Falquier, senior
Mike Cummer and junior Andrew

Lewis.
Lewis won the WCCC road race
championship handily three weeks ago
in San Luis Obispo. Falquier finished
second in the conference in overall sea
son points, and Bailey recently set a
course record in the time trial at Chico
State. Grad student John Schlesinger
declined an invitation to join the team.
The women's team includes grad stu
dents Joan Wilson, Megan Troxell and
Kelly Chang, senior Tracy Timms and
junior Kelley Hemdon. Troxell, Wilson
and Timms have established themselves
as three of the best road racers in the
nation. At the WCCC Championships,
the trio finished as the top three riders
in the road race. As a freshman, Tracy
Timms won the road race at nationals,
and she is also a member of the U.S.
National B team. Troxell won the
WCCC season individual points champi
onship, holding on at San Luis Obispo to
defeat California's Christi Eckel.
Last year, Stanford barely finished
second in the overall team standings at
Nationals, a few points behind UC-
Davis. This year the Cardinal hopes to
justify its top ranking and win the title.
The competition consists of a team time
trial, a criterium and a road race. Last

year, the Stanford women won the time
trial while the Stanford men placed sec
ond in that event.
The championships start tomorrow
with the team time trial, Stanford's
strongest event. The 20-mile race will be
held on Highway 445 outside of Reno.
The team has been practicing for the
location by riding near the Bay in strong
side winds. The team will use HED aero
dynamic wheels to counter the effects of
the wind.
"We would really like to repeat as
time trial champions, but Colorado will
be a threat," Troxell said.
Later on Saturday, the team will
compete in the criterium in downtown
Reno. The criterium has been Stan
ford's least successful event this year.
The squad will face stiff competition
from many East Coast sprinters.
Finally, the championships will end
on Sunday morning with the road race
through the town. The men's race will
be 59 miles long while the women will go
45 miles. Thia race is relatively shorter
than past races, but that will not neces
sarily help Stanford who excels in longer
rides.

The cycling squad's year rounds the corner for the home stretch this weekend at the
NCCA Championships.
In order to win the national
championship, the team will
have to overcome another test
against fellow West Coast
schools while also battling tal
ented squads from the East
Coast and Midwest. The WCCC
sent four other teams to the
competition, including Cal, Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, UC-San
Diego and UC-Davis. Until the
conference championships, Cal
had been ahead of Stanford all
year. With the Golden Bears
also sending their best team,

the Cardinal will have to once
again survive the challenge.
In addition, Stanford will
face tough competition from
Colorado, Indiana, Miami
(Ohio), Marian and Midwestern
State. Marian and Midwestern
State are the only schools in the
nation which offer tuition
scholarships for cyclists, thus
they perennially have a strong
team. Cycling is a varsity sport
at those schools.
However, the Cardinal will
go into the race with confi
dence. "Despite the competi
tion, I have to say that our
prospects for placing in the top
three are quite good," Bailey
said.
