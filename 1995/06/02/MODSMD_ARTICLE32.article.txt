# Fac Sen revisits requirement debate
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate debated another in a series of
proposals to alter Stanford's system of distribution
requirements yesterday.
The senate hopes to vote on the system's final
design at a special meeting scheduled for June 8.
Several committees and interested groups have
been tossing around alternatives to the current DR
system since the Commission on Undergraduate
Education called for a decrease in the total number
of requirements in its report, released last October.
The latest DR plan comes from the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, which proposed a three
part system that members say will be simpler than
other recommendations made this year.
According to the committee's proposal, DRs
would be replaced by "general education require
ments" dictating that students take the three-quar
ter long Cultures, Ideas and Values course, three
certified courses other than CIV in the humanities
or social sciences, and three certified courses in sci
ence, engineering or mathematics.
Students would be able to fulfill what currently
are the World and American Cultures DRs by taking
one class with an asterisk, designating it as certified
to fulfill that requirement. The method would be
similar to the current system for the gender require
ment, which would also stay in place.
Committee Chair David Brady, a professor in the
Graduate School of Business, said he and Psycholo
gy Assoc. Prof. Anne Fernald, another committee
member, put both the committee's proposal and a
previous senate recommendation up for an informal

vote by students in their classes.
The vote came out divided equally for each pro
posal, Brady said. After more than an hour of dis
cussion, the senate wasn't much closer to consensus
than the students.
Senate members' concerns about the latest
attempt at revising the system ranged from ques
tions about students' rights in choosing courses to
Stanford's relative strength in the humanities, sci
ences and social sciences.
History Prof. George Fredrickson, a member of
the committee, warned that the proposal — which
allows students to take their three required human
ities and social sciences courses all in one sector or
the other — could endanger Stanford's humanities
programs.
"The humanities at Stanford are strong, but they
are always in danger of marginalization," Fredrick
son said. "I'm afraid this proposal will make that
marginalization a reality."
While the senate's resolution would encourage
breadth in students' courses, the committee's plan
would allow students to study one subject in more
depth, Brady said.
Incoming Council of Presidents member Rich
Stolz, also a committee member, asked the senate to
give students responsibility for plotting their own
course through Stanford.
"Whether they choose depth over breadth or
breadth over depth, let the students decide for them
selves," Stolz said.
But the breadth versus depth debate won't go
away, University President Gerhard Casper said.
"Breadth and depth seem eventually to lead to
death, as far as I can tell," he said.
