## Med School, San Diego care system join in residency program 
### Joanna Dickler 
Keeping up with the trend of managed health
care, the School of Medicine announced this week
that Sharp Health Care's family practice residency
program will now be an affiliate of the Medical
School and its division of family and community
medicine.
Sharp, which signed the agreement with Stan
ford in March, is a regional health care system made
up of hospitals and clinical services based in San
Diego.
The Medical School's family practice residency,
in which residents train in their specialties for three
years before seeking board certification, has operat
ed for 15 years at the San Jose Hospital and Medi
cal Center.
Now family practice physicians-in-training from
both the Sharp and Stanford residencies will be able
to participate in elective rotations at either Sharp's
hospitals or at San Jose, according to Stephanie
Casenza, director of public relations for Sharp
Health Care.
In addition, the collaboration will provide for a
faculty exchange program and health services
research in which Sharp staff members will cooper
ate with Stanford faculty to determine effective
methods for administering clinical care.
According to Casenza, Sharp presented the idea
of an affiliated residency to Stanford last year based
on the Medical School's reputation.
The partnership will allow both organizations to
update and improve their training of primary-care
physicians — who are becoming more and more

important as health care shifts into the realm of
managed care, said Dr. Halsted Hoi man, professor
of medicine and co-chief of Stanford's division of
family and community medicine.
"From our standpoint, it's an opportunity to
expand the horizons of our residency," Holman
said.
"The fundamental reason for this relationship
lies in changes that are going on [with the increas
ing importance of] primary care on one hand and
the relative lack of knowledge and of research work
relative to primary care in schools, like Stanford,"
he added.
"Sharp feels they can be advantaged by an
exchange of faculty," Holman said. They have "a •
real interest in improving the effectiveness and effi- I
ciency of their health care."
Dr. Joseph Scherger, vice president and director
of the Sharp Family Practice Group, told Campus
Report that through the program Sharp will be bet
ter equipped to meet the increasing demand for
well-trained family practice physicians.
Another big advantage for Stanford, Holman
said, will be the ability to see a residency in action in
a managed-care setting. It will "carry ideas into the
real world of health care," he said.
"The health care system is moving toward [man
aged health care]," Holman said. The Sharp pro
gram is important because in the future, medical
students will have "probably no option but to join in
managed care," Holman said.
Holman said that the affiliation stands to bring
academic, teaching and research gain to both par
ties involved.
