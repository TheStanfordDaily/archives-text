# Discovering the beauty of breaking up
## 
### 
Most people don't realize just how fun, or
at least funny, break-ups are. They wallow in
self-pity and, "Oh how I'll miss my fuzzy
melon butt." They stop shaving and drive
their friends to drink with all that pseudo
sympathy they're forced into. They whine and
whimper and mourn the loss of their futon's
counterweight with all the blood, sweat, tears
and phlegm of a Tarantino flick.
And all the while they're missing the best
part: the appreciation of misery.
For misery, like joy, is one of the wonderful
extremes of experience. And if you take the
time to intellectualize the demise of your
sophomoric pookiehood, you'll realize that
just because something sucks doesn't mean
that it can't be enjoyed.
What could be funnier than the realization
that nothing we can experience lasts forever?
What is more entertaining than watching
something delicate shatter? It's like Huey
Lewis' career all over again.
Ah, 'tis the season.
One look at the calendar and couples flee
like wildebeests from a jackal. They shatter.
Couples who dress up for their dates together,
diads who described themselves only in the
future tense — all are susceptible. Three out
of four fall to pieces once logistics come into
play and their crutch of convenience turns to
rubber for the three-and-a-half-month hiatus.
And so the approaching summer skyline —
the seasonal front which blows apart all but
the strongest (or most misguided) of emotion

al ties — looms on the horizon, darkening the
playing fields and widening the pupils of pook
ies everywhere.
They begin to quiver at the cold prospect of
solitude reclaimed. Instead of kickin' back and
appreciating the emotional Hobart of a hearty
schism, they fight it with petty plans and
rationalizations. They scrounge to do whatev
er they feel will resuscitate the dead beast of
their affections and keep away the carnage of
a break-up.
But, in some form or other, a confrontation
has to happen and the relational (renegotia
tions must begin. The players are forced to
face and define what they've been doing with
out thinking ever since that first night under
the Taxi's pool table.
Statements are given. Long avoided ques
tions — questions that should have been
answered during those sightless months of
wondrous hedonism — are asked: Where to
go? What to do? Whose path to follow? Am I
happy here? Which of the CDs are mine? Am I
ever getting my jacket back? Your ass did get
bigger, didn't it?
After hours of bleary-eyed, overdue con
flict, arrangements are made. . . agreements
. . . delusions. Resolutions are reached, trade
offs are traded, equations are balanced, and
pros are conned.
"It'll be like we're still seeing each other."
"Let's wait and see."
"We'll see other people."
(Funny how all of these break-up

euphemisms use the word "see' — as if to
imply blindness all along.)
With these words, whichever they choose,
the relationship slurps its last sip of Icee and
the former of its embrace begin to
cry and make a of themselves. et
they never realize that their pain is a tribute,
not an affront, to the emotions once shared.
For the grand irony of the break-up is that
the better the relationship was — the
stronger its feelings, the truer its words, the
greater the investment — the worse the
break-up will be. It's an inverse proportion of
the darkest kind.
So be proud of your angst. Rejoice at the
painful last breath of that seminal duet — no
matter where it leaves you on the spectrum of
solitude. Because through those tears you
prove that all along there actually was some
thing more to that investment than a pile of
soggy latex and handful of Italian dinners.
Know that just because something is dead
doesn't mean it wasn't beautiful, or at least
pretty, while it lasted. And while you
shouldn't waste any more time trying to
revive a beast content with its own demise,
you can still water the flowers by its grave.
