# Wild riot at Yost
## In-house draw violence leads to 37 casualties; 'It was pure evil' 
### Joshua Walker Editorial staff 
Apparently inspired by recent
events at Harvard University, a
seemingly simple in-house draw
meeting turned tragic yesterday
evening leaving 37 injured, 24 of
whom are listed in serious condi
tion at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter.
Yost house, one of the three
dormitories in Governor's Cor
ner, was the scene of the calami
ty, as students — unhappy with
the results of their room assign
ments — rioted.
According to Resident Assis
tant Rudy Fernandez, a senior
public policy major who oversees
the use of the dorm master key,
what began as nudging and push
ing erupted into bitter violence
that lasted nearly an hour.
"At first a couple residents
were just getting into each
other's faces, yelling cuss words
and stuff," said Fernandez. "But
then the next thing I know I'm
ducking knapsacks that are fly
ing across the room. Then some
one pulled out an ethernet
cable."
Police reports indicate that
the ethernet vandal, whose name
is being withheld from the press,
injured at least 18 people. His
rampage halted only when
another participant threw a
mountain bike on his head.
Don Keykong, a Stanford
junior who arrived late to the
event, was left in a state of shock.
"There was yelling and there
were bodies all over the place.
People were screaming and
moaning. It was pure evil," he
said.
Keykong, who is under the
observation of University psy
chologists, said that even the
injured were yelling violent slo
gans like "Death to Res Ed!" "We
want blood!" and "Patriots
unifpl"

"Everyone was, like, totally
going crazy," said Fernandez,
who himself received only minor
wounds from textbooks. "This
was my first real job as an RA
and I don't know if I'm cut out
for it."
Investigators affiliated with
the Stanford Police Department
and Stanford's Office of Residen
tial Education began immediate
inquisitions into the disaster,
apparently the first of such mag
nitude in the many years of the
University's housing draw sys
tem.
"I've heard of problems that
have occurred over the years,"
said Shannon Howitzer, Yost's
Resident Fellow, "but never
something this horrible. This
was my first real job as an RF
and I don't know if I'm cut out
for it."
Students at Stanford receive
their housing assignment by way
of a lottery-type draw system.
Once they are placed in a dorm,
another draw is held, determin
ing the specific rooms where res
idents will be placed.
Sources at the Office of Resi
dential Education said that inci
dents surrounding the draw have
usually been limited to bickering
among drawmates or random
roommate assignments. A mur
der-suicide last week at Harvard,
however, seemed to raise the
stakes.
Sinedu Tadesse, a 20-year-old
Harvard junior, stabbed her
roommate 45 times before hang
ing herself in her dorm bath
room.
"It's pretty ironic that as cer
tain administrators here are try
ing to make Stanford more like
Harvard and the Ivy League,
something like this would hap
pen," said one witness who
wished to remain anonymous.
Clean up of the incident will
be billed to next year's Yost resi
dents.
