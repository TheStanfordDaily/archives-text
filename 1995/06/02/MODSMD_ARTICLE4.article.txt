# Profs consider Bosnian crisis

### Gabriela Teodorescu Staff writer 
The newest crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
Bosnian Serbs' takingof U.N. peacekeeping troops as
hostages in response to NATO bombings, should not
have been a surprise, said History Prof. Norman
Naimark.
"You can't expect them to get bombed and to say,
'OK, we are not going to do anything,' " he said.
"What they did unquestionably escalated the crisis,
but it also stopped the bombing."
Political Science Prof. Stephen Krasner agreed
that NATO must have understood that the Bosnian
Serbs would take hostages. "It was completely pre
dictable," he said.
The taking of hostages "may make it easier for the
British and the French and possibly the U.S. to make
a greater commitment to the conflict and get greater
public support," Krasner said.
Naimark said that while the actions of the Bosnian
Serbs should be condemned, their actions are not in
the same category as war crimes. "This is not geno
cide and the war crimes tribunal is prosecuting them
for genocide and mass rape, which are war crimes and
are subject to international law," he said.
Other experts also voiced opinions on the three
year-old war in the region, which took a new turn
with the recent action by the Bosnian Serbs.
The United States has deployed 2,000 Marines in
the area who can help not only with the withdrawal of
the troops, but also in the movement of U.N. troops
to more strategic and safe positions.
With regard to the potential role of the newly de
ployed U.S. Marines, Hoover Senior Research Fellow
James Morrow, an expert on international conflict,
said he believes there is almost no chance of the
Marines playing an active military role.
"It is possible that U.S. troops might go in for
something that might lead to the
withdrawal of U.N. troops or the
consolidation of U.N. peacekeep
ers," Morrow said, "And those
actions might lead to some fighting
between the U.S. troops and
Bosnia, but I can't imagine that we
would get in a situation of war."
History Prof. Wayne Vucinich, a
top expert on the region, said that
he is fundamentally "opposed to
military intervention."
As the Clinton administration
grappled with the most recent crisis
and the possibility of a ground role

in Bosnia, the United Nations yes
terday refused a Bosnian Serb call
for talks about the hostage situa
tion.
While it seems that the taking of
hostages would create unity among
the mjyor powers and the United
States, most experts emphasized
the problems of the U.N.'s role in
the area.
"The problems the U.N. has in
Bosnia are a reflection of the fact
that there is no agreement across
the powers that matter," Morrow
said.
Donald Abenheim, a visiting fel
low at the Hoover Institution,
echoed the problem of lack of unity
in the U.N.'s position. "There has
to be strong leadership," he said.

Abenheim added that the char
acter of democratic nations, espe
cially their dependence on public
opinion, affected what actions can
be taken in Bosnia.
"There is a lack of will in demo
cratic polities to use force in ways
that would be strategically signifi
cant and which would lead to a
negotiated settlement," Abenheim
said.
Naimark, however, said he
believed it is more the nature of the
Balkan conflict which has caused
the U. N.'s problems there. "I think
the U.N. has done a remarkable
job," he said. "They have been
given a task of peacekeeping in a
region where the political elites do
not want peace."
