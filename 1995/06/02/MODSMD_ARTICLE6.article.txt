# Crossing the line? Faculty, students seek boundaries
## 
### Valerie Hung Contributing writer 
"Looking back, I wish... I would have
known what the appropriate student / pro
fessor relationship was. Because you have
these awesome professors that you've heard
so much about. It's very exciting, but you
wonder how far to take that â€” how close do
you get to your professors, and in what con
text? And I think I overstepped the line."
As the words of this sophomore who
wished to remain anonymous indicate, the
boundary separating the appropriate from
the inappropriate in faculty / student rela
tionships has grown increasingly difficult to
define.
Although Stanford policy strongly cau

tions staff against pursuing such relation
ships, the Guide Memo on Sexual Harass
ment states, "The University has no formal
policy prohibiting consensual romantic or
sexual relationships among faculty, staff or
students."
The controversy over what should consti
tute official university policy centers around
the concept of power.
According to Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo, "Power makes people appear more
glamorous than they really are. It tends to
give them a halo of positive traits that might
not be deserving."
Zimbardo said he believes faculty and stu
dents should refrain from dating so long as
they are at the same institution. "Where
there's a potential for somebody in a power

position to use that power position for per
sonal advantage over somebody else, then it
should be avoided," he said. "It should not be
allowed by the University."
In Zimbardo's mind, sex merely compli
cates the problem. "For me, the issue is the
person in power asks something of the person
who doesn't have power," he said. "Given the
enormous power differential between a pro
fessor and a student, you could argue that the
student is not in a free choice situation."
To illustrate his point, Zimbardo proposed
a scenario in which a professor asks a student
to clean his car or file his books. "To say I'd be
willing to pay you if you want, to propose it in
a way that a student would say I'd be happy to
do it.... There's really no difference in one
sense between that and exploiting a student

sexually," he explained. "Because you're
using your power in a way which is not legiti
mate in that role."
He was, however, quick to point out the
possibility of a student blackmailing a profes
sor or manipulating the situation for person
al gain. "The potential for abusing power can
go in both directions," Zimbardo said. "It's
obviously much more likely that it would be
top-down, but it could also go in the other di
rection."
