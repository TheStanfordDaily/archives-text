# Crossing the line? Faculty, students seek boundaries
## 
### Valerie Hung Contributing writer 
"Looking back, I wish... I would have
known what the appropriate student / pro
fessor relationship was. Because you have
these awesome professors that you've heard
so much about. It's very exciting, but you
wonder how far to take that â€” how close do
you get to your professors, and in what con
text? And I think I overstepped the line."
As the words of this sophomore who
wished to remain anonymous indicate, the
boundary separating the appropriate from
the inappropriate in faculty / student rela
tionships has grown increasingly difficult to
define.
Although Stanford policy strongly cau

tions staff against pursuing such relation
ships, the Guide Memo on Sexual Harass
ment states, "The University has no formal
policy prohibiting consensual romantic or
sexual relationships among faculty, staff or
students."
The controversy over what should consti
tute official university policy centers around
the concept of power.
According to Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo, "Power makes people appear more
glamorous than they really are. It tends to
give them a halo of positive traits that might
not be deserving."
Zimbardo said he believes faculty and stu
dents should refrain from dating so long as
they are at the same institution. "Where
there's a potential for somebody in a power

position to use that power position for per
sonal advantage over somebody else, then it
should be avoided," he said. "It should not be
allowed by the University."
In Zimbardo's mind, sex merely compli
cates the problem. "For me, the issue is the
person in power asks something of the person
who doesn't have power," he said. "Given the
enormous power differential between a pro
fessor and a student, you could argue that the
student is not in a free choice situation."
To illustrate his point, Zimbardo proposed
a scenario in which a professor asks a student
to clean his car or file his books. "To say I'd be
willing to pay you if you want, to propose it in
a way that a student would say I'd be happy to
do it.... There's really no difference in one
sense between that and exploiting a student

sexually," he explained. "Because you're
using your power in a way which is not legiti
mate in that role."
He was, however, quick to point out the
possibility of a student blackmailing a profes
sor or manipulating the situation for person
al gain. "The potential for abusing power can
go in both directions," Zimbardo said. "It's
obviously much more likely that it would be
top-down, but it could also go in the other di
rection."
Kausik Rajgopal, a senior majoring in in
dustrial engineering and political science, has
experienced both ends of a power relation
ship. Besides having worked as a teaching as
sistant and instructor himself, Rajgopal has
dated a former TA, a former
instructor and a former work
supervisor.
"Personally I don't regret any of
the relationships that I've had with
people in such a context," he said.
"Especially as I've made a con
scious effort to not have these rela
tionships while they were in that
unequal power position with me."
For Rajgopal, the key lies in
staff members avoiding relation
ships with students they are cur
rently teaching.
"If you are a TA or an instructor
and you're attracted to one of the
students, you are on a constant
basis evaluating this other per
son," he said. "If you are constant
ly evaluating someone's perfor
mance, it's a very fine line ... to
tread, between maintaining that
professionalism and letting a per
sonal relationship affect it."
Rajgopal said he does not
believe, however, that the Univer
sity should attempt to legislate
such matters. "I don't think it's
the University's business what
people do with their personal lives,
as long as it does not affect the
work that they do," Rajgopal said.
"The University needs to make the
assumption about the people that
it hires, especially in responsible
positions like professors and teach
ing assistants, that they will make
good sound judgements."

Other students do not share
Rqjgopal's perspective. The sopho
more who expressed her uncertain
ty over the proper roles of profes
sor and student regretted the out
come of her experiences.
During her freshman year, she
enrolled in a class taught by a pro
fessor her friends had highly rec
ommended. Because the material
was difficult, she attended office
hours to discuss her ideas.
"So the class got over winter
quarter and I still wanted to pur
sue discussions," she said. "But the
problem was I couldn't meet with
the professor during his office
hours. So I suggested we meet over
lunch."
This continued for some time,
and almost every encounter was
initiated by a phone call from her.
Soon their discussions broadened
to more personal topics.
"I remember him sharing feel
ings," she said, "that sometimes
being a professor made it hard on
his social life. A lot of times he
regretted not being more social and
having a family."
Although she said she did not
consider their meetings dates, she
still refrained from telling her
friends. "They just thought I was
overzealous about the subject," she
recalled. "I think part of that is
because I knew after a point that it
was inappropriate, that it wasn't
right. I don't know if I didn't want
to get reprimanded by people ... I
don't know."
One day, she suggested they go
hiking and have a picnic. "So we

were hiking along, and I remember
him saying that he really enjoyed
having female company, that he
admired my spunk," she claimed.
"Eventually he said that he was
romantically attracted to me."
She reacted with surprise, then
dismay. In her mind, he had never
been more than a mentor, someone
to share ideas with. "I told him it
could never happen. I was just
freaked out, so I stopped calling
him."

Looking back, she said her main
regret is "I wish that he had said, I
really can't meet with people off
campus; it's just a policy. He teach
es other classes that I would have
liked to take, but I won't now.
There's no way; it would be too
weird."
She added: "I wasn't aware that
as he said, the professor is still a
man. I always thought, a professor
is a professor, and nothing is ever
going to come of it."
