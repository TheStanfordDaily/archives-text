# Seniors give in record amount
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
This year's seniors are the most
generous graduating class Stan
ford has ever seen.
Class participation in the Senior
Gift reached 50.9 percent yester
day — setting a new record for the
percentage of participation by any
class in the Stanford Fund, accord
ing to Scott Showalter, director of
young alumni development in the
Office of Development.
The class' total contributions of
$21,400 will be added to matching
gifts from the Parents' Advisory
Board and Peter Bing. Bing also
donated $50,000 since the class
topped a one-half donation rate.
That came on top of another
$50,000 he donated when more
than one-third of the class had
given. These other gifts will push
the total gift over $185,000,
Showalter said.
The gift will be presented to
University President Gerhard
Casper on Class Day, which is June
17. Casper commended the efforts
of Senior Gift organizers at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
"This is quite an outstanding
achievement on the part of this
year's seniors," Showalter said.
"They're demonstrating to the
whole alumni population in gener
al what it means to give back — it
sets a standard for all alumni."
Stanford's rating in U.S. News
and World Report has dropped in
recent years, partly due to statis
tics which revealed alumni were
not giving to their alma mater.
People involved with the gift were
hopeful that these positive results
would start to reverse the trend.
"What the program has done
has gotten a lot of people's aware
ness up about why alumni need to
donate back to Stanford," said Mil
lie Chu, Senior Gift co-chair. "I
think it will continue."
The high donation rate "is im-
poriant in terms of getting corpo
rate sponsorship as well," said
Senior Gift co-chair Keith Rich
man. "If people see that 50 percent
of the class wants to give, they'll
think it's a worthy cause as well."
The participation level was
only at 24 percent at the begin
ning of May, Richman said. But
over the course of this month, 26
percent more or about 390 people
wrote checks. "It was a real con
centrated effort to get people
toward the end,' he said.
Senior Class President Eric
Chen said that having more coop
eration between the Senior Gift
committee and the class presi
dents was one way that this year's
effort was different. "This is the
first year a senior class president
has been on the Senior Gift com
mittee," he said.
Efforts to boost class participa
tion also included Senior Days,
where gifts were solicited at the
same time tickets to the senior for
mal dance were being sold in
White Plaza, Richman said.
"I think we had a real vocal
campaign," he said. "Being out in
White Plaza for two weeks gave us
a lot of publicity."
All the money donated will go
into the Stanford Fund, to be used
for funding undergraduate educa
tion and financial aid, according to
Richman. Funding for a non-mon
etary gift comes from money paid
by seniors when they matriculat
ed. No decision has yet been made
as to what this gift will be, he said.
"We've set a precedent for next
year," said Jason Rozes, Senior
Gift co-chair. "We've set up a
great challenge for next year's
class — definitely one worth
attempting."
