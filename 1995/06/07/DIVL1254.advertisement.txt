graduation ?

memories free of conflict?

Don't Stay at the
Stanford Park Hotel!
there's trouble there...
All Western Lodging Group hotels, including the Stanford Park Hotel, are under great public scrutiny and have been officially declared under
boycott by Civil Rights organizations, student groups, and organized labor. The Western Lodging Group has launched an assault against its
workforce by hiring the shady "American Consulting Group", a professional union busting company, to intimidate and prevent workers from
organizing to improve their working conditions. The organizing drive at the Western Lodging Group's "Lafayette Park Hotel" highlights the ugly
practices of the Western Lodging Group and their union busters. The National Labor Relations Board is currently investigating Western Lodging
Group for illegal activities such as bribing workers to not organize a union and threatening ones who support the union. Protests are expected
during graduation. Don't let your graduation memories be tarnished by the Stanford Park Hotel. DON'T CHECK IN - CHECK OUT!
Boycott all Western Lodging Group hotels including: Bodega Bay Lodge,
Half Moon Bay Lodge, Lafayette Park Hotel, Monterey Plaza Hotel, Napa Valley Lodge.
