$500 REWARD
For One California Precedent
I don*i believe any valid California ease credibly supports ihe summary judgment
against me (an ex-employee) in Johnson v. Stanford University et al., Superior Court
case No. CV7422X6. Prove me wrong, help Stanford on appeal -- and cam $500!
Stanford claimed it "undisputed" that I had submitted all of my civil claims in
employee "grievances" which by mutual agreement constituted "binding arbitration " I
strongly disputed this. 1 Hon. Levinger held that "any dispute" as to whether my civil
claims had been submitted to "binding" arbitration could be decided only by a petition to
vacate binding arbitration, brought underC.C.P. § 12X6.2. / hereby promise to pay:
$500 !< >r the first valid California case directly upholding this broad interpretation of
C.C.P. § 12X6 (minus any $200 payments already made as follows).
$200 112( >r the first valid California case upholding this interpretation of C.C.P. § 12X6 re
the dispute that the prior remedies were not "binding" arbitration.
$200 for the first valid California case upholding said interpretation of C.C.P. § 12X6 re
the dispute that the civil claims had not been submitted to the prior remedies.
$50 112( >i the first valid California case holding, in a civil action, that a dispute as to
whether the action was precluded by binding arbitration was a triable issue of fact.
$15 per case to the first person to give me any case that 1 cite in my appeal brief and
which is not cited in the trial court.
I promise to respond with a proper reason if I reject a non-frivolous case. I will
try to mail responses (and checks!) within 14 days of receipt. Further details and a list of
trial court citations are available on request. Mail cases by July I, /V95 to:
C. Johnson, 4104 24th Street, Box #103, San Francisco, CA V>4114.
1 Cases must credibly apply to the at-issue sorts of dispute, i.e.: 1. I testified that Stanford's
legal department went out of its way to emphatically assure and reassure me that the grievances were not
binding on me. and for the first time had emphatically claimed the direct opposite months after the
grievances ended (by which time it was too late to petition under C.C.P. § 12X6). 2. Stanford's grievance
manager testified that, after grievances, "Can you sue the University? Sure " 3. Stanford's writings and
the record expressly showed that: (a) Stanford appointed the grievance hearing officer (who hills $250 an
hour) al least eight years ago; (b) it was agreed that I waived no rights to sue; (c) absolutely no civil
claims were admitted in the grievances, and (d) some civil claims arose after the grievances.
