# A 						year of CUE progress
## University seeks implementation 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The University has made sur
prising progress this year imple
menting the recommendations of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education, moving swiftly
from a broad, abstract examina
tion of the Stanford curriculum
to the task of making the com
mission's recommendations a re
ality.
"I am overall just tremendous
ly impressed how far we have got
ten in the course of this year,"
University President Gerhard
Casper said. "I'm very pleased. If
government worked that well, I
think they would be very proud."
But uncertainties and obsta
cles remain for the commission's
recommendations, and the reali
ties of University policy making
may still jeopardize Casper's
promise of a sweeping overhaul of
undergraduate education at
Stanford.
In his 1993 State of the Uni
versity address, Casper promised
to appoint a commission with a
lofty mandate to "consider the
undergraduate curriculum in
light of the changing needs of our
students, the emerging opportu
nities and challenges of the 21st
century and the increasing need
to focus more intently on the
basic objectives of the institu
tion."
The resulting 12-member
Commission on Undergraduate
Education, led by History Prof.
James Sheehan, completed its
task last October. Its 64-page
final report proposed, among
other changes, creation of a sci
ence core curriculum for non
technical majors, a redesign of
the distribution requirement sys
tem, changes in the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program,
strengthening the writing and
language requirements, and a re
view of majors and advising.
Recommendation progress
The Faculty Senate and other
elements of the University have spent the
year trying — with some success — to turn
the commission's recommendations into
University policy.
"I think we've ... taken rather timely
action," said Biology Prof. Hob Simoni, the
senate's chair.
Indeed, several commission recommen
dations are already well on their way to
becoming reality.
In January, the senate approved a com
mission recommendation to strengthen
writing and foreign language requirements.
Beginning with the class entering in the fall
of 199(5, a student will have to take a writ
ing-intensive course within his or her major
in addition to fulfilling the Writing and Crit-

ical Thinking requirement
In addition, students
will have to prove foreign
language proficiency by
completing a year of for
eign language study at
Stanford, scoring a 4 or 5
on an Advanced Place
ment or passing a profi
ciency exam.
Also, a new center for
language study, another
commission recommen-

dation, is scheduled to open next fall.
Finally, the design process is underway
for a new three-quarter core sequence that
would teach scientific and technical con
cepts and skills to nontechnical majors.
CIV controversy
But the year has been by no means an
unqualified success for the commission.
Some of its recommendations have faced
increased resistance alter further review by
the faculty.
The most salient example is the reevalu
ation of the University Cultures, Ideas and
Values requirement and its role among
Stanford's DRs.
The commission originally proposed that
the CIV curriculum be altered to encompass
the World Cultures and American Cultures
DRs.
However, after numerous changes and
proposals, the senate is scheduled to vote on
a completely different DR policy tomorrow,
(see related story)
The University has yet to see definitive
action on several other parts of the com
mission proposal. For instance, no action
has been taken on the proposed changes to
the Academic Calendar, including adding a
two-day reading period at the end of each
quarter.
Faculty questions
But while the administration and senate

have moved swiftly to implement some
commission recommendations, they have
been less successful at garnering support
for the proposals from the faculty at large
and from students.
"It seems to me that (the commission
proposal] has become a proposal which
nobody particularly wants to support," said
CIV Program Director Paul Seaver, a histo
ry professor. "That's a peculiar fate for a
major proposal to have."
Seaver said the commission report's less-

than-warm reception
among CTV and other fac
ulty is "perhaps an indica
tion that (the commission]
tried to work too fast."
Mathematics Prof.
Brad Osgood, a member
both of the commission
and the senate, agreed
that not all the faculty
have mobilized behind

the commission's recommendations.
"I can't say that the average faculty
member in the street has actually digested
the (commission's) report," he said.
Nevertheless, Osgood said, the commis
sion report has sparked a great deal of dis
cussion about undergraduate education.
"It has certainly been a visible presence
on campus this year," he said.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood, also a mem
ber of Ixith the commission and the senate,
agreed, saying one of the greatest contribu
tions of the commission was stimulating
conversation.
The greater challenge, Mahood said, is
developing "concrete ways of changing the
faculty culture" to place more importance
on undergraduate teaching.
Legislative approach
Another challenge the University has
faced this year is the task of translating the
commission's wide-reaching, unified work
into a slate of discrete changes and legisla
tive proposals.
"It's hard to take one aspect of the
undergraduate education and separate it
from the rest of it," Osgood said.
The senate decided in January that it
would consider each of the commission's
recommendations individually, then at its
final meeting June 15 will revisit the year's
actions and examine whether in combina
tion they make graduation requirements
untenable.
Osgood said he has no fear that this more
reductive approach will detract from the
commission's original broad vision for
change.
Mahood said senate committees have
been able to examine education issues in
greater depth than in the commission's
original study.
