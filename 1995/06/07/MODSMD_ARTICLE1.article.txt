# A
						year of CUE progress
## University seeks implementation 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The University has made sur
prising progress this year imple
menting the recommendations of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education, moving swiftly
from a broad, abstract examina
tion of the Stanford curriculum
to the task of making the com
mission's recommendations a re
ality.
"I am overall just tremendous
ly impressed how far we have got
ten in the course of this year,"
University President Gerhard
Casper said. "I'm very pleased. If
government worked that well, I
think they would be very proud."
But uncertainties and obsta
cles remain for the commission's
recommendations, and the reali
ties of University policy making
may still jeopardize Casper's
promise of a sweeping overhaul of
undergraduate education at
Stanford.
In his 1993 State of the Uni
versity address, Casper promised
to appoint a commission with a
lofty mandate to "consider the
undergraduate curriculum in
light of the changing needs of our
students, the emerging opportu
nities and challenges of the 21st
century and the increasing need
to focus more intently on the
basic objectives of the institu
tion."
The resulting 12-member
Commission on Undergraduate
Education, led by History Prof.
James Sheehan, completed its
task last October. Its 64-page
final report proposed, among
other changes, creation of a sci
ence core curriculum for non
technical majors, a redesign of
the distribution requirement sys
tem, changes in the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program,
strengthening the writing and
language requirements, and a re
view of majors and advising.
