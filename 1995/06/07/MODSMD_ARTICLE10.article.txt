# Retaining black professors tough
## University finds recruitment, retention of black professors difficult due to declining pool of candidates, especially relative to Asian Americans 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
With comparatively few black undergradu
ates entering graduate programs, major uni
versities like Stanford have found hiring and
retaining black professors, as compared to
other minorities, an increasingly difficult
task.
According to an article in the June 2 issue
of The Chronicle of Higher Education, the
number of Asian professors at Stanford
surged from 56 in 1988 to 112 this year,
while the number of black full-time faculty
members dropped from 36 last year to 35
this year.
Even though 20 new full-time black facul
ty have been hired since the 1988-89 academ
ic year, six have left in the same period.
Part of the problem stems from a declining
pool of candidates. While the number of black
Americans earning Ph.D.s declined from
1,047 in 1982 to 951 in 1992, the number of
doctorates earned by Asian Americans leaped
from 452 to 828 in the same period. The num
ber of Latinos earning doctorates jumped
from 535 to 755.
Clayborne Carson, a professor of history
and director of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project, said that the problem is not
unique to Stanford.
"It's a problem not one university can
solve." Carson said. "But I think that Stan

ford has to do more than it's done in the past.
This University has to take the lead in
addressing the problem."
Because black representation is sparse in
graduate programs, Carson said "the long
term solution has to do with encouraging
more African-American students to under
take scholarly careers. That requires a more
comprehensive policy than just hiring star
people."
Robert Weisberg, a professor at the Law
School and vice provost for faculty recruit
ment and development, agreed that with com
paratively few black students entering gradu
ate school, there are few candidates available
for universities looking to increase their
diversity.
"If you look at it on a narrow level, if you
look at many strong minority undergradu
ates, they're going into law school or medical
school," said Weisberg.
"I think it's tragically unfortunate that
some of the strong science specialists in col
lege go to medical school and that many
lawyers out there could have been great phi
losophy professors," he added. "I understand
why they do that, however."
Sally Dickson, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development, concurs.
"Everybody is going after the best and the
brightest," she said, adding that it is impor
tant to foster an environment with "innova
tive and enriching academic programs" that

will attract underrepresented minority
scholars.
"What is critical is not only that their
scholarship is appreciated and valued, but
that what they have to offer to the academy is
also appreciated," Dickson said.
Carson, who never even considered becom
ing a professor as a career option until he
worked on several research projects, empha
sized the importance of giving students the
exposure to career alternatives.
"Exposure to possibilities should be the
central aim of any comprehensive program to
deal with this problem," said Carson, who
currently sponsors 10 to 12 undergraduates
in the King Papers Project. "You have to have
rewards out there to defer the immediate
reward of, say, three years of law school — to
take the risk of trying to pursue a doctorate
which might take five to seven years to get,
and at the end of it to have a job that pays
nowhere near what a law school graduate
gets."
Weisberg proposed several ways by which
universities could increase the pool of under
represented candidates, most of which
amount to increasing the flexibility of hiring
guidelines.
"You start looking at universities that you
might otherwise not have looked at," Weis
berg said. "Not just the five or six elite uni
versities in the field, because there might be
qualified candidates in other schools."
