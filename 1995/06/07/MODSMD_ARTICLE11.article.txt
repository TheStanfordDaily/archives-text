Richard Smoke, a visiting fel
low at the Stanford Center for the
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences and political science pro
fessor at Brown University, died
May 23 from self-inflicted knife
wounds to the throat. He was 50.
Smoke came to Stanford in
September to spend the academic
year on sabbatical. At the center,
he was working on a book analyz
ing national security in the emerg
ing democracies of Central and
Eastern Europe.
An expert on foreign policy,
arms control, nuclear deterrence
and national security, Smoke co
founded the Peace and Common
Security Institute in San Francis
co in 1982. He served as the insti
tute's executive director for two
years. Since 1984, he was
Research Director of the Center
for Foreign Policy Development at
Brown.
Smoke co-authored his first
book, "Deterrence in American
Foreign Policy," with Stanford
Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Alexander George in 1974. The
book won the Bancroft Prize for
the best book in American history
published that year.
"He was a very special person,

very talented and very conscien
tious," George said. "He used to
refer to me as his mentor, and I
hud a very good relationship with
him all these years."
According to George, Smoke
was a "very private person, who
never wanted to impose his prob
lems on anyone."
George added that Smoke had
told him he "desired a year off
from pressure on research and he
wanted to reflect on what he want
ed to do next. Apparently things
didn't go well, he obviously had a
severe depression."
Smoke, who was seeing a psy
chiatrist because of his depres
sion, was found dead in a motel
room in Saratoga. According to
Sgt. Jim Arata of the Santa Clara
County Sheriffs Office, his psy
chiatrist became concerned and
contacted the motel after Smoke
gave some indication of suicidal
intent.
"This came as a complete shock
and surprise to all of us, and there
had been little indication of a
problem in his life that would war
rant this kind of action." said
Robert Scott, associate director of
the behavioral center.
"It is a great tragedy that we
don't have his continuing pres
ence and scholarship," George
added.
