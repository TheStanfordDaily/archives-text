# Carpal tunnel syndrome afflicts students, but is not addressed
## 
### Victor Wishna 
Graduate student Brooke Ackerly
noticed intense pain in her right hand
after a weekend spent grading papers last
fall quarter. When she shifted to typing
her notes and comments, she soon felt
pain in her left hand as well.
"It hurt even when I wasn't writing or
typing," she said. "I couldn't even hold a
pen."
Ackerly suffers from carpal tunnel
syndrome, a debilitating "repetitive
stress injury" which has long affected
people who use their hands professional
ly, such as artists and musicians. Recent
ly, however, injury rates are rising
among those who spend a lot of time
writing or typing — including college stu
dents.
As coordinator of the Graduate

Women's Network, Ackerly soon learned
she was not the only one in pain. Some
one posted a query on the network's e
mail list and a group developed as many
other students said they too suffered
from the problem. Ackerly made it her
mission to find out more and distribute
information about the injury — and,
more importantly, its prevention.
"Somebody will say to me, 'I just start
ed to feel this,' and I'm like 'Oh no!' " she
said. "Once you start feeling tftat incred
ible pain, it's too late."
Ackerly contacted various campus
health agencies. None, she said, were
very helpful at first. The Health
Improvement Program responded that
they only served staff, while Health Pro
motion Services simply told her "they
didn't do that." Ackerly found only the
Disabilities Resource Center could help

to some extent, offering its current note
taking and transcribing services as well
as a promise to pursue new options.
According to Disabilities Resource
Center Director Carla Dunn, the center
and its two-person staff are trying their
best to meet this growing need.
"The reason we've gone so slowly is
because it's not been clear how we can
assist people with the resources we
have," she said. "We can't hire typists for
everyone — we simply don't have the
resources to do that. But what can we
do?"
One answer may lie in new software
that enables people to use a word proces
sor without using their hands. Dragon-
Dictate, an IBM voice-dictation program,
allows users to type 40 to 50 words per
minute by speaking into a computer's
microphone. Macintosh has just released

a similar program called Power Secretary
and Dunn said a work station with such
software is planned for Meyer Library.
But, according to Dunn, all of this is
preliminary. The software is expensive
and Dunn said she would eventually urge
any student with this problem, which
tends to be chronic, to purchase their
own. Furthermore, she said she remains
cautious, as there are many unanswered
questions about the new technology and
its effectiveness.
For now, the center is preparing infor
mation for students on such options as
they become available, and hopes to offer
interim support as they explore those
options.
"I'm really excited about how respon
sive people have been here so far and I
hope that this will continue," said Dunn.
"The more people can learn about this,

the better, because we're all lacing it.
Students especially often feel invulnera
ble because they feel they're young,
strong and healthy — but repetitive
stress injury can happen to anyone. It
can happen to someone who's 50, but it
can also happen to someone who's 20."
For this reason, Dunn said she
believes major efforts need to be made
towards prevention.
Ackerly agreed, saying she would like
to see someone informed on the issue
speak to students and dorms. In only one
program, people "could learn and then
everyone would be better off."
"There is so much of this that can be
prevented," she said. "You can lessen the
damage that you do to yourself by sitting
in the proper position, by having your
