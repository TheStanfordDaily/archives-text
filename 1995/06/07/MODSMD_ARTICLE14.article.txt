Famed evangelist Billy Graham, weakened by influenza, ended a speech abruptly yesterday and is
helped to his feet moments after he asked his audience to rededicate their lives to God. Graham,
76, was taken to Toronto's East General Hospital, where he was in good condition last night despite
some bleeding from his bowel, his doctors said in a statement. "He was in a weakened condition
from the flu he was suffering," said Larry Ross, Graham s spokesman. "From what I understand,
this is a temporary condition."
