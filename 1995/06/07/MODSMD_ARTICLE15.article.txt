JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — The high court of
one of the world's mosl violent
countries abolished the death
penalty yesterday, ruling the
right to life outweighed setting an
example to deter crime.
On Death Row at the Pretoria
Central Prison, the 453 inmates
sentenced to hang burst into
cheers and song when they heard
the unanimous decision of the 11-
member Constitutional Court,
prison officials said.
"All these years, I'm praying to
God and today it was glory," said
Onecca Molefe of Soweto, whose
son Norman has been on Death
Row since 1990.
"The eye-for-an-eye argument
does not hold water any more in
our society," said jubilant human
rights lawyer Ahmed Matala, who
had campaigned against the death
penalty.
But Deputy President F.W. de
Klerk warned the decision went
against the desires of the "over
whelming majority" of South
Africans who live in fear of crime.
He pledged his National Party
would fight for a constitutional
amendment to reimpose the
death penalty.
It was de Klerk, as president in
1990, who suspended executions
as part of an initiative to begin
negotiations with the African
National Congress. South
Africa's last hanging was in 1989,
but killers have continued to be
sentenced to death.

The office of President Nelson
Mandela, who himself narrowly
escaped execution when he was
sentenced to life in prison for try
ing to overthrow the government
in 1963, called the court's deliber
ations "sober and humane."
Mandela's ANC, which consid
ered the dozens of hangings a
year carried out by the old white
regime as a tool of repression
against blacks, was exultant.
"Never, never and never again
must citizens of our country be
subjected to the barbaric practice
of capital punishment," it said.
Death penalty advocates, partic
ularly white conservatives, say the
halt in executions has contributed
to an explosion of violence.
South Africa topped 20,000
killings in 1993 and now routine
ly tallies 17,000 to 18,000 homi
cides per year, making it one of
the planet's most murderous
countries. The per capita murder
rate is seven to eight times that of
the United States.
Experts on violence doubted
the court's decision would have
an immediate impact on the crime
rate.
"Offenders in South Africa still
believe they will be able to get
away with their crimes," said
Lloyd Vogelman of the Center for
the Study of Violence and Recon
ciliation, noting that fewer than
one in three criminals is ever
caught and convicted.
The ruling was the first major
decision by the court, which is

similar to the U.S. Supreme
Court and was set up in February
to interpret South Africa's first
constitution to guarantee equal
rights.
South Africa became the 55th
country to abolish capital punish
ment, while 15 allow it only for
exceptional crimes such as war
crimes. In addition, 27 countries
and territories allow executions
but never carry them out.
Chief Justice Arthur
Chaskalson said the central argu
ments against the death penalty
were the right to life guaranteed
by the constitution that took
effect with last year's all-race
election, the possibility of error in
imposing the death sentence and
the existence of a suitable alterna
tive — life imprisonment.
Arguments for the death
penalty were the perception that
executions act as a deterrent and
the public demand for revenge
against murderers.
"The state is, and all its organs
are, forbidden to execute any per
son already sentenced to death,"
Chaskalson ordered.
Me said condemned inmates
are to be kept in custody until
their death sentences are replaced
by another punishment.
The court was ruling in the
case of Themba Makwayane, 36,
and Movusu Mchunu, 24, sen
tenced to hang for killing four
people, including two policemen,
in an armed robbery Aug. 31,
1990.
