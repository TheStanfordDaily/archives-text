MALI ZVORNIK, Yugoslavia
(AP) — Bosnian Serbs sent 108
U.N. peacekeepers across a
bridge to Serbia and freedom
early today and there were indi
cations that more of nearly 150
remaining hostages could be
released soon.
Two buses carrying the 108
peacekeepers crossed the Drina
River into this border town short
ly after 1 a.m. today. The freed
hostages came from Britain,
France, Ukraine and Spain, said
Jovica Stanisic, the Serbian pres
ident's security chief.
The first busload of 58 peace
keepers had been reported on
the Bosnian Serb side of the
Drina River border in the town
of Zvornic hours earlier. But the
Bosnian Serb news agency
SRNA said those men had to
wait for more peacekeepers to
join the convoy.
The releases came after days
of U.N. pressure, international
negotiations and intervention by
Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic.
Bosnian Serb leaders "have
responded positively ... to the
appeal of President Milosevic,"
said Stanisic, who spent two
days negotiating for the release
of the hostages.
The freed peacekeepers were
to be taken to the Serbian town
of Novi Sad, about 30 miles
north of the Serbian and
Yugoslav capital Belgrade,
Stanisic said. He refused to allow

reporters to talk to the released
soldiers.
The release was likely to help
ease tensions between the Bosni
an Serbs and the United
Nations, whose NATO members
have been mustering military
might in response to the
hostage-taking.
"We are convinced that in the
leadership of Bosnian Serbs,
there is a positive atmosphere
concerning the international
community and that they are
ready to act in the direction of
peace," Stanisic said.
Milosevic has been considered
key in persuading intransigent
Serb leaders in Bosnia to release
peacekeepers, seized after NATO
warplanes bombed Serb ammu
nition dumps May 25 and 26.
The Bosnian Serbs released
121 peacekeepers on Friday after
intervention by Stanisic. After
today's release, 148 remained in
Serb captivity, and Stanisic said
he was hopeful more would be
released soon.
"We hope that, in the follow
ing period, the process of their
liberation will continue," he said.
The Bosnian Serbs seized
hundreds of U.N. hostages after
the NATO air raids and initially
demanded guarantees of no
more NATO airstrikes before
agreeing to release any of them.
It was unclear early today if such
a guarantee had been given.
Asked whether the Bosnian
Serbs had received anything in

return for the release of the
hostages, Stanisic replied: "I
can't answer that. Our only task
is to help in this crisis."
But Belgrade's independent
BETA news agency quoted an
unnamed high-ranking Bosnian
Serb as saying they had received
assurances from NATO that
there would be no more air raids
— a key condition the West has
refused to consider to date.
The days of negotiations
about the hostages have includ
ed an American envoy, top Greek
officials, Bosnian Serb leaders
and Milosevic.
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokeswoman Christine
Shelly said Milosevic helped with
the hostage situation but
showed no interest in a proposal
that he recognize Bosnia in
exchange for a suspension of
U.N. economic sanctions.
"I don't think that we feel
that the prospect of being able to
reach agreement with him at
some point has disappeared,"
Shelly said.
Milosevic's recognition of
Bosnia would further isolate
rebel Serbs in Bosnia and Croat
ia and undermine their dream of
uniting territories they hold
with Serbia itself.
Milosevic insists on an iron
clad lifting of economic sanc
tions against his nation. Wash
ington, however, wants to be
able to reintroduce them if nec
essary.
