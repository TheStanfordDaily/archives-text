Spiking food not assault
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A judge threw out
assault charges yesterday against a former
Denny's cook accused of spiking two law officers'
eggs with Tabasco sauce.
Michael Towne, 20, had been charged with
simple assault by Lebanon police in February
after the Vermont state troopers complained that
the hot pepper sauce made them sick. One troop
er ate his entire meal. The other ate most of his.
District Judge Albert Cirone Jr. ruled that the
troopers' consumption of their food amounted to
consent "to the contact of the Tabasco with their
palate."
Cirone also said simple assault requires physi
cal contact and is not "based on such a subjective
standard as ... an individual's tolerance for cer
tain foods."
Towne's lawyer praised the decision. "We do
not — and did not — feel this is an appropriate
case for the criminal court," Peter Decato said.
Lebanon Police Lt. Matthew Hogan, who pros
ecuted the case, said, "We knew we were in
uncharted waters. We got some clearer guidance."
Simple assault carries up to two years in jail
and a $2,000 fine.
Police said Towne spiked the troopers' food
because they were police officers.
Towne had said that the hot pepper sauce may
have gotten into their eggs from a previous order
that had been cooked on the grill.
Police rejected the explanation and a Denny's
assistant manager said Tabasco is not used in any
of the restaurant's dishes.
Hubble images released
WASHINGTON (AP) - NASA released Hubble
images yesterday that show for the first time the
intricate and violent details of the formation of stars.
The pictures, of objects up to 1,500 light years away,
give the best observational support yet for elements
in theories on star creation, astronomers said.

The pictures show powerful jets of superheated
gas exploding away from the core of a forming star
and streaking out into space at 186 miles per second.
As the jets smash into nearby dust and gas, the
tight core of energy sets the heavens aglow, creating
streamers of light that swirl and shimmer across bil
lions and billions of miles.
"Everyone has always predicted this, but actually
being able to see it is really remarkable," said Bruce
Margon, a University of Washington astronomer.
He said that such jets were once thought to be a
rare phenomenon, but aided by the Hubble images,
astronomers now realize that the explosion of ener
gy is the normal result of gas and dust coming
together to form stars.
Autopsy reports begin
LOS ANGELES (AP) — O.J. Simpson flinched,
stared at the ceiling and exhaled rapidly yesterday
as a coroner began to detail the dissection of two
murder victims and the examination of under
wear Simpson's ex-wife wore the night she died.
The former football star, who has asked to be
absent when jurors view autopsy photos, was
required to remain in the courtroom as Los Ange
les County Coroner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyav
agiswaran testified about the admittedly flawed
autopsies on the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ronald Goldman.
The coroner said he was unaware Dr. Irwin
Golden had a history of mistakes when he
assigned Golden to do the autopsies. He said he
trusted the pathologist, who had previously per
formed autopsies in other high-profde cases such
as the murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez.
Later, the coroner showed jurors four knives —■
none related to the case — to explain how one
knife could leave wounds of various lengths and
depths. Defense attorneys contend more than one
assailant may have attacked Goldman and Nicole
Brown Simpson and they have cited Golden's ear
lier testimony that more than one knife may have
been used.
