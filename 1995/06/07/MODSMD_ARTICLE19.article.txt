# Editor's farewell
## 
### 
Ct m HIS AFTERNOON or
evening, when you go
.L. home, go to your mir
ror. Look in the mirror for a few
minutes. Try to imagine — really
try — that you know nothing at
all about the person you see,
none of his past, where he comes
from or what he has done. See
how you feel. See if history is
important."
The exercise above was sug
gested last quarter by one of my
professors, Claudio Segre, as
part of a class on modern Italian
history. It came at the end of a
lively first lecture on whether
history is useful and why we
should avoid or take his class.
A little wary of the mirror
experiment as I began, I watched
myself turn, briefly, into a
stranger, and learned something
about the influence of history.
Prof. Segre was one of those
teachers who led people to see
things in a different way.
Professor Segre died 13 days
ago. He had a heart attack while
jogging outside his house in
Berkeley. He was 58.
When I learned of his death, I
was very surprised. The profes
sor had seemed relatively fit, and
58 is not very old in 1995. Much
more shocked and saddened, I'm
sure, were his wife and three
children; my sympathy goes to
them.
I was also disturbed. Only
months ago, Prof. Segre and I
had chatted amicably about
research and history, about
choices for the future and the
merits of careers in academia
and journalism. At the time,
these were theoretical subjects.
Now, with graduation nearing
and mortality on my mind, they
become urgent. In the past
weeks, the future has gained new
weight in my eyes.
Claudio Segre's obituaries tell
his story: academic, historian,
expert on modern Italy, prize
winning author, former journal
ist, husband, father, Italian-
American. I think the professor
would have been at least mildly
pleased with how the papers
reflected his life. He had chosen

a course and in under six decades
he accomplished much. I wonder
what the obituaries will say
when I die.
It is trite to say that death
makes one think more about life
and what is important, but the
statement the benefit of
being true. Ask t,van Chen, a
sophomore who is lying in a hos
pital bed, dying of leukemia. In a
message to campus, he pointed
out that when faced with death,
he found new value and import
in life.
It has also become trite to use
this farewell column to urge peo
ple to get involved in life and try
to make a difference. I write that
we all need to spend significant
time thinking about what is
important to us, what we enjoy
to do and what we need to do. I
urge everyone to then go out and
execute those ideas by studying
or participating in extracurricu
lar organizations or volunteering
or worshipping or doing whatev
er you discovered is important.
But we have all heard this
message before, and I speak with
little authority on any person's
life but my own. I've read this
advice in this space before; then I
threw that paper away. I need a
new way for all of us to see the
importance of choosing and fol
lowing — or clearing — our own
paths. Prof. Segre helped me see
this. I'll adapt one of his lesson
plans for my message:
Go look in a mirror, and imag
ine that the person staring back
at you has a malleable history.
Imagine what you would like to
be able to say about the life and
accomplishments of this person
upon their death. Be a biogra
pher. Be a critic. Spend at least a
few minutes thinking, seriously,
about the subject. Then go and
make reality match that reflec
tion.
