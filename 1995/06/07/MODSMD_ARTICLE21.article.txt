## Final memories of Stanford 
### 
TODAY BEGINS a week of finals.
No, not just those pesky exams
some of you may be concerned
about. This is the week when I'll see my
final column, my final Daily, my final
class, even my final final. I've often won
dered, what will I be thinking and feeling
when I walk out of that last exam of my
senior year? Will I be elated and relieved,
depressed and confused, or maybe some
where in between? What memories will
be running through my head during that
final trip down Palm Drive on the 19th of
June? I suppose they will be similar to
the thoughts I've already had about each
of my Stanford years as the final day
approaches.
For example, my freshman year. Obvi
ously a haze of new people, new experi
ences, and new challenges. Living
through the Branner Third Floor Party
without going to the hospital or passing
out on the lawn during the fire alarm.
Getting dumped by my first Stanford
guy. Enjoying frat parties before I real
ized that beer could actually taste good.
And thinking that CIV and freshman
English were serious classes I needed to
be stressed about.
Sophomore year. A time for reality to
set in. Falling into a dry fountain on my
first night back and ending up in the
emergency room. Getting dumped over e
mail (only at Stanford!). Surviving the
world's worst hangover, 85-degree
weather, and 100 percent humidity at the
New Year's Dav Blockbuster Bowl in

Fort Lauderdale, back when the football
team used to win.
Junior year. What can I say? Europe!
Having classes only one day a week, trav
eling the rest of the week, and still get
ting 12 units of credit each quarter. Dis
covering that Stanford is far from the
center of the universe. Realizing that
Parisian men are as rude as their reputa
tions. And trying to explain to my
friend's landlady in the three words of
German that I knew (Bitte, Danke and
Bier) why we were standing in the snow
in the middle of a Berlin street at 4:30 in
the morning yelling, "Marshall!" at the
fourth floor window.
And finally, senior year. Realizing how
much I really hate frat parties. Discover
ing that hanging out at the Coffee House
is actually tolerable if you order a couple
of pitchers. Finding out for the second
time that long-distance relationships
never work out. Seeing all of the plans I
thought I had for the future fly out the
window leaving me more confused (and
unemployed!) than ever at graduation
time. And the penultimate feat, the expe
rience that made my whole Stanford
career worthwhile: becoming a Daily
columnist.
I suppose I will also think a lot about
my regrets as I leave here. I regret that I
didn't study in Europe longer. I regret
that 1 didn't make more of an effort to get
to know my professors better and that I
never asked that cute boy in my seminar
out. And I definitely regret that I never

let Andy Crispino ghost write my column
(or did I?) and that I never wrote a col
umn about Guy Kulman. Well, maybe I
don't regret that so much.
So here I go, out into the "real world."
Will it be like MTV? I hope not. I know
now that after four years here, Stanford
may have taught me a lot, but it didn't
teach me anything about that supposed
real world. I'm leaving here more con
fused than ever about what I want from
life. But I know that that is natural, and
that I'm only one of many who are in the
same boat. I know that it's time to attend
a new school, the University of Reality, a
school from which it may be much more
difficult to graduate. Who knows? Maybe
I'll even fail at some of the things that I
do at that school, something which was
impossible to do during my years at Stan
ford.
So I wish my fellow seniors luck, we're
all going to need it! And for those who
still have some time left in this amuse
ment park we call Stanford, have fun,
drink a lot and get ready for the good
times, the uncertainties and the strong
memories which will undoubtedly flood
your senior year.

National Geographic magazine next
