Stanford Events director Wagner claims no wrongdoing

ON THURSDAY, June 1, The Stan
ford Daily printed a letter to the
editor from Scott Moss and Jon
Toma claiming I had misled Daily
reporters and readers, as well as Mary
Edmonds and others, on a current Uni
versity policy. Allow me to state the
facts:
Since it was established by Stanford
Events, in consultation with the Con
trollers Office and the Ticket Committee
over two years ago, there has been a poli
cy requiring ticketed events in Memorial
Auditorium, Memorial Church and Frost
Amphitheater to be ticketed through the
Ticket Office at Tresidder. The purpose
of the policy is for proper audit controls
of income and assured payment of event
expenses. I confirmed this in an e-mail to
Mary Edmonds on May 11 and told Mr.
Moss this in an e-mail on May 16. Both
of those e-mails were copied to ASSU
senator Michael Choo.
In both of these e-mails, I confirmed

that Ram's Head, Sunday Flicks and the
Speakers Bureau had never been held to
these policies. There was no new exemp
tion or a bowing under pressure, simply
the stated fact that they had not been
held to these policies. This was partially
because we endeavored first to bring the
non-student organizations into compli
ance with the policy while the Ticket
Committee developed ticket service rates
that would be affordable to student orga
nizations yet reflect the cost of the ser
vice provided.
Phil McLaughlin and Julie Wahlgren
did indeed inform users of Mem Aud,
Mem Chu and Frost of the policy and the
paperwork required. However, they work
in room scheduling in the Registrar's
office, not Stanford Events as Mr. Moss
and Mr. Toma stated, and it is not their
job to determine who is exempted from
the policy. Therefore, they sent everyone
the same information.
My associate director, Lawrence

Davidson, with whom I have worked for
11 years, has reported to me his brief
May 1 phone conversation with Mr.
Toma. He has assured me that he did not
tell Mr. Toma that the Speakers Bureau
would have to comply with the policy
next year. He also said, as I indicated in
my e-mail to Mr. Moss, that he was
attempting to explain to Mr. Toma how
revised rate policies would make it possi
ble for the Speakers Bureau to use the
Ticket Office services at "no additional
cost" to the organization. He said the
conversation with Mr. Toma ended ami
cably with an agreement to meet in the
early fall to discuss the new ticket rates.
A Daily article contained quotes from
students stating that Ticket Office ser
vice charges would be $1.05 per ticket for
free tickets. The fact is, a ticket distribut
ed by the Ticket Office for a free event
would cost 25 cents for the distribution
service and 5 cents for printing the tick
et. I found the students' statements and

The Daily's reporting inaccurate, and so
stated.
Mr. Moss stated that I refused to
return two phone calls from the Speakers
Bureau and one from a KZSU reporter.
Mr. Moss left two voicemail messages,
the first on a Wednesday afternoon when
I was booked solid with meetings and the
second the following day when I was
away from campus. I talked to a KZSU
reporter by phone and respectfully
declined an interview; this same reporter
called me again at my home after 9 p.m.
and I again declined.
The real issue is whether the policy
and its implementation are fair. To date,
student inquiries have been responded
to, the facts have been reported to the
ASSU Senate and I have proposed to
form a working group to review the poli
cy as it relates to ASSU-sponsored
events.
