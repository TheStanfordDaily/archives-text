# Violence at Harvard is not a laughing matter
## 
### 
As an alumnus of Harvard, and as
someone who deplores senseless violence, I
must express my disappointment over the
"Wild riot at Yost" article in the Diver
sions section of Friday's Daily. Death and
violence may be funny to Josh Walker, but
not to most of us. Although intended to be
humorous, I can find nothing amusing
about the recent tragedy at Harvard or
any inspiration it might have for fictional
violence here at Harvard. Not only has
this violent incident saddened and stunned
the Harvard community, but the families
of the students have suffered a tremen
dous loss. No matter how frustrated one
might become with a roommate or a room
draw result, violence against fellow stu
dents cannot be justified. The rest of the
Diversions page was funny. Please exercise
reasonable discretion in the future when

printing "humor."
