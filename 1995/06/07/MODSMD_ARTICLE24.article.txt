# 'Moon at noon' stirred up feelings of regret and disappointment
## 
### 
I saw the fliers for it a few days ago:
"Are you tired of hearing the word 'con
servative' used to describe the future of
this university?" In my naivete, I imagined
a protest, an expression of dismay that we
will be having the secretary of the former
War Department speaking at graduation
this year, a critique of governmental sup
port for human rights abuses, a challenge
to Rush and Newt and Pete Wilson. I
imagined the stirrings out of apathy.
I arrived to see the largest collection at
White Plaza that I've seen in a while. I

was impressed; it's not often that so many
Stanford students will look up from their
feet on the way between their tightly
scheduled appointments. And then I real
bed what the gather was really about —
dropping pants and imitating Beavis over
a microphone.
I have no problem with nakedness or
wildness or fun. I'm glad that a group of
people could gather in the name of silli
ness. But my overwhelming reaction to
the "Moon at Noon" was disappointment.
Disappointment that the best thing we can
think of to do with a large gathering of
people is to strip down for a world record.
Four years ago I thought that the Rod
ney King incident would propel our genera
tion into another decade of social revolu
tion, political activism and change. Arriving
back on campus following fall I found that
the momentum had deadened. The issues
were back to simmering under the surface.
And there were so many issues. Today
seeing the group in White Plaza I found

myself thinking of us as rebels without a
cause. And then I realized that maybe
we're just rebels with too many causes.
There seems to be so much wrong that its
hard to know where to begin. And all of the
systems for change are systems I no longer
trust — the government, the media.
My disappointment was as much in
myself as anyone else today. Disappoint
ment that in four years here I didn't come
any closer to saving the world. Disappoint
ment that though I find myself willing to
attend somebody else's protest, I haven't
found the time here to lead one or get
deeply involved in the organizations which
would. Disappointment that sometimes I
give in to the apathy and cynicism and
begin to believe that there's no use trying
to change things — that a gathering to
decry violence would do no more good
than a collection of lost souls yelling
"Yeeeeaaaaah butt!"
