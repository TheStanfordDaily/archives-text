## Preserving life on Earth: a race against time Politics, biodiversity and ecosystem services 
### Carol L. Boggs Gretchen C. Daily 
The elections of
November 1994 are widely
regarded as heralding a
sea-change in American environ
mental politics. With an eye to
balancing the budget and to
reducing government regula
tion, Congress has been awash
with proposals such as those to
eliminate the National Biologi
cal Service, radically restructure
the Endangered Species Act and
seriously weaken wetlands pro
tection regulations. Environ
mental policymakers find them
selves scurrying to plug leaks in
the levee of environmental legis
lation, lest the entire structure
collapse and we drown in the
flood.
Under such political circum
stances, we are forced to consid
er how intact the environment

Ecosystem services

must remain to sustain human
life. An intact environment sup
plies "ecosystem services," the
numerous conditions and pro
cesses associated with natural
ecosystems that confer benefit
to humanity. These services are
provided on such a grand scale,
and operate in such intricate and
unexplored ways, that most
could not possibly be substituted
for by technology. Ecosystem
services are absolutely essential
to civilization; they are priceless,
and yet their lack of a price
(their value falling outside the
traditional bounds of economic
analysis) contributes to a
widespread misimpression that
they correspondingly lack value.

services had been in operation
for millions to billions of years.
They are so fundamental as to
make them both easy to take for
granted and hard to imagine dis
rupting beyond repair, as human
activity threatens to do today.
Ecosystem services are sup
plied in part by biodiversity.
"Biodiversity" is more than sim
ply the number of species in a
given area. It includes diversity
of life at all levels of organiza
tion, including the genetic, popu
lation, species, community and
ecosystem levels. Diversity at
each level is integrally tied to
diversity at all other levels.
Without genetic diversity, for
example, many populations and
species would go extinct.
One way to understand the
connection between ecosystem
services and biodiversity is to
imagine setting up a happy life
on the moon. Pretend, for the
sake of argument, that the moon
already has some of the basic
conditions for supporting
human life, such as a favorable
climate and atmosphere. Other
than your best friends and a pet
or two, what assortment of life
forms must you take with you?
Species exploited directly for
food, drink and spices are obvi
ous contenders. You would also
need species that provide fiber,
timber, pharmaceutical and
industrial products such as
waxes, rubber and oils. Perhaps
most important of all are the
millions of little-known species
involved in supplying ecosystem
services, including: the genera
tion and maintenance of fertile
soils; the stabilization of soils;
regulation of the hydrological
cycle; maintenance of the
gaseous composition of the
atmosphere; amelioration of cli
mate; cycling of nutrients and
wastes; detoxification of waste
products; control of agricultural
pests; pollination; and preserva
tion of a "genetic library" from
which humanity has derived the
basics of agriculture, medicine
and industry, and which is nec
essary for both natural evolu
tionary and human innovations.
Our moon colony example is
somewhat artificial in several
ways, not the least being that
biodiversity of an area is being
constructed; with the Earth, bio
diversity of many areas is being
depleted. Through habitat frag
mentation and destruction,
human activities are permanent
ly (from society's perspective)
wiping out biodiversity. The pre
sent rate of extinction of species

is on the order of 10,000 to
1,000,000 times the rate of evo
lution of new species. Moreover,
habitat alteration often causes
delayed extinctions, with popu
lations or species persisting as
the "living dead" for decades
after their fate is sealed. In the
context of Paul and Anne
Ehrlich's now-famous rivet anal
ogy, we are loosening many riv
ets on the airplane that may not
actually pop out until some
unknown point in the future —
and with no knowledge as to
which are the critical rivets
attaching the wing to the plane.
Where do we draw the line
then, for protecting biodiversity
and the healthy functioning of

natural ecosystems? Prudence
dictates that we move carefully
when altering our environment,
as the consequences of our
actions may not manifest them
selves for many years.
The present political climate
thus gives cause for grave con
cern over the future well-being
of humanity. Tim Wirth, U.S.
Undersecretary of State for
Global Affairs, noteo in a recent
speech at Stanford that "the
economy is a wholly owned sub
sidiary of the environment." In
light of the role that biodiversity
and ecosystem services play in
maintaining human civilization,
let alone our economies, this is if
anything an understatement.
