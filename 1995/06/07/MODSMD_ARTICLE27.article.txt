# Biodiversity treaty would hinder biotech industry
## 
### Henry I. Miller 
THE 1992 Biodiversity
Treaty, rejected by the
Bush administration but
signed by President Clinton, faces
opposition to ratification in the
Republican-controlled Senate.
But the treaty, a lose-lose propo
sition for U.S. consumers, scien
tists and industry alike, is a bad
idea that won't die. It remains
high on the administration's
agenda. Speaking at Stanford
University on April 26, Undersec
retary of State for Global Affairs
Tim Wirth said that the Biodiver
sity Treaty has the "top priority
among all treaties" and agree
ments awaiting confirmation.
Moreover, Vice President A 1 Gore
is known to be willing to make
almost any political deal for its
approval.
The treaty (more formally, the
Convention on Biological Diversi
ty) addresses a broad spectrum of
issues related to the protection of
biological diversity. These include
the conservation of habitats in
developing nations and the avail
ability of resources to make this
possible. The treaty was con
ceived as an unprecedented
opportunity for industrialized
and developing countries to rec
oncile issues of conservation and
access to biological resources.
However, it is burdened with the
problematic question of an inter
national biosafety protocol — in
other words, regulations — for
biotechnology, which in any case
has little to do with biodiversity.
The kind of biosafety regulation
being contemplated — for exam
ple, for field trials of improved
varieties of potatoes, corn, rice or
cassava — would discourage inno
vative research and development,

poorly conceived, highest com

The international bureaucrats
discussing the form and imple
mentation of a biosafety reveal
their misguided intentions clearly
in an official description of the
April 1993 proceedings of an
expert panel established to imple
ment these aspects of the treaty.
According to paragraphs 57 and
58 of the summary, "a majority of
the Panel members believed the
organisms covered by a possible
protocol should be restricted to
genetically modified organisms,"
along the lines of the European
Union's approach, which defines

related criteria, but according to
whether molecular techniques of
genetic manipulation have been
used.
The panel notes explicitly that
the scope of regulation "does not
include organisms modified by
traditional breeding methods,"
regardless of pathogenicity, likeli
hood of constituting an environ
mental nuisance, or other poten
tial risks. This approach has been
widely discredited, the scientific
consensus holding that there is
no conceptual difference between
organisms crafted with older
techniques (such as mutagenesis
or hybridization) and the newer
techniques (such as gene-splic
ing), and that regulation should
be risk-based. The panel took lit
tle notice of a minority viewpoint
cited in the report that the scope
of regulation proposed was unsci
entific and "would ignore organ
isms actually known to present
a threat to biodiversity, while
focusing on others for which
only hypothetical analyses can
be offered." (In support of the
minority view, consider the
irony that the bacteria that
cause anthrax or bubonic
plague could be tested — for

example, as a pesticide — with
out regulation, while a field
trial of a gene-spliced extended
shelf-life tomato would require
a government review.)
The wrongheaded regulation
in the making would hurt R&D
in ways not limited to the devel
oping world, or even to interna
tional transfers and transac
tions. Paragraphs 74 and 75 of
the panel report observe omi
nously that "a majority of the
Panel members interpreted the

[treaty] language ... as if both
international transfer of organ
isms and domestic handling
and use of organisms were cov
ered. The majority of the Panel
members thought that domestic
regulation should he covered by
a possible protocol" (emphasis
added).
The primary goals of the
treaty are laudable but the
mechanisms provided to accom
plish them are vague or impo
tent, while the biosafety proto

col is an imminent hazard to
the diffusion of biotechnology
through the developing world.
Its ability to enhance safety in
the developing world is
extremely doubtful; and the
likelihood of its being cost
effective, nil. Moreover, the
protocol's possible jurisdiction
over strictly domestic activities
could effectively take away
individual nations' ability to
adopt rational policies, thus
discouraging innovation. Ironi

cally, the protocol would stifle
development of environmental
ly friendly biotech innovations
that can help clean up toxic
wastes, purify water and dis
place agricultural chemicals —
products especially needed in
the developing world. The
treaty is far more likely to
cause harm than to make sig
nificant inroads towards its
goals. It should be abandoned
and a new sound one renegoti
ated.
