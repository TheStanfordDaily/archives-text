# Biological diversity is invaluable to humans
## 
### Marjorie Lucks 
SINCE the Industrial Revolution, our
species has continually enhanced its
ability to negatively impact the natural
world. The threats to biological diversity one
hundred years ago may have included over
hunting, urban sprawl and horrendous air
pollution from the rampant burning of coal
and oil. But today the threats are much more
pervasive — global and invisible — from
global climate change to the disintegration of
the ozone layer to habitat fragmentation.
And we have realized that no area is safe
from the impact of the human lifestyle.
Developed countries contribute to biodiversi
ty loss through industry, overconsumption,
development, and a tendency to maintain
lifestyles and economies that are seemingly
independent of the health of local and
regional ecosystems. In the developing world,
corrupt, poor, or weak governments bring
unsustainable development projects and
industry in order to boost economies, often at
the expense of the land, flora, fauna, and peo
ples. Outdated tax, property, and trade laws
perpetuate these problems.
Spotted owls, tiger salamanders . . . why
do we care to preserve biological diversity
when at times it seems to cause more harm
and difficulty than good? What about the
California condor, teosinte (the wild precur
sor to domesticated corn), or the next cure to
cancer, AIDS, or the common cold? We bene
fit daily from the genetic and biological diver
sity of the planet.
It is estimated that 38 percent of the pre
scriptions written annually in the United
States are made up primarily or solely of
plant chemicals. These medicinal products
come from the analysis of only 5 percent of
the known plant species — what may come
from the remaining 95 percent? The world's
food supply comes almost completely from a
base of only about two dozen species of plants

logical and environmental sciences and was

tal Action at Stanford this past year. She

and animals (including rice, legumes, corn,
etc.). This lack of genetic variety and diversi
ty makes these .species especially vulnerable
to disease, drought, and infection. Each
species originates in a single geographic area
which may or may not be threatened by
deforestation, urbanization or rapid climatic
change. Fortunately, many varieties of these
species are preserved in seed banks around
the world, but these banks are even being
depleted rapidly, as the need to reintroduce
wild species and their genes back in to failing
populations increases.
Beyond the practical scientific reasons
behind the need to preserve biological diver
sity and ecosystem function is a basic human
trait — the desire for aesthetic surround
ings. After spending an average of 95 per
cent of our time indoors, we long for pristine
forests, lakes full of frogs and fish, deserts

diversity of the planet.'

teeming with a life that we challenge our
selves to find. . . . Imagine one component of
any of these systems missing; there is
disharmony to us as the viewer, and there is
truly chaos in the daily functioning of the
ecosystem.
What is currently being done to protect
and conserve the biological and genetic diver
sity that is presently being lost at rates
orders of magnitude greater than have been
experienced in all of Cenozoic time (the past
65 million years)? There is good news, and
there is bad news. . . .
Bad news first. The 104 th Congress is on
an all-out rampage on the environment.
Obviously, gutting the Endangered Species
Act has a detrimental effect on our ability to
preserve species and ecosystems, but the
weakening of any environmental legislation
poses a threat to biodiversity. Other plants,
animals, bacteria, and protozoa utilize the
same atmosphere, water, and land that
humans do. So the weakening of the Clean
Water Act, Clean Air Act, National Environ
mental Protection Act, etc., poses a threat to

our well-being, health, and security as well as
to the rest of life on this planet.
On the international level, the United
States has a mixed record. President Bush
refused to sign to the Biodiversity Conven
tion in Rio de Janeiro, but Clinton has since
signed the treaty. We are now signatories to
both the Biodiversity Convention and the
Framework Convention on Climate Change,
but the impetus for domestic change is not as
great as the drive to advocate change in other
countries as we stand back and watch, eyes
closed to many domestic problems and solu
tions. Some U.S. multinational corporations
have dedicated themselves to meeting strin
gent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
guidelines in their operations abroad, while
others go out of country explicitly because
they can pollute, devastate, and ravage the
land while governments sit back helplessly
and watch.
On the positive side, though, there is good
going on. There is increased international
funding available for biodiversity conserva
tion and protection projects through the
Global Environment Facility (GEF), an
international financial institution created to
aid implementation of the Climate Change
Convention and the Biodiversity Conven
tion.
Everyday, more links are made between
our understanding of environmental prob
lems, more synergisms and parallels are
revealed. While these understandings make
the problems more complex, they bring us
closer to finding viable solutions to the web
of interconnected environmental problems.
The establishment of nature preserves,
debt-f'or-nature swaps, biodiversity
prospecting, shifts in property and tax
laws, and sustainable forestry practices,
development of non-timber forest products,
are all economically and legally viable
mechanisms of biodiversity conservation.
These solutions may seem shortsighted or
lack a true conservationist ambition, since
the ideal situation would be simply to pre
serve as much wilderness as possible. How
ever, biodiversity loss is both a short term
and a long term problem that has short
term and long term solutions. We need to
address the short term through as many
means possible in order to buy time for the
long term.
