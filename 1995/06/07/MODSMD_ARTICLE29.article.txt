PRESERVING genetic bio
logical diversity is of great
importance to the biotech
nology industry. Biotechnology
refers to the use of living organ
isms to make commercial prod
ucts. The more diverse the supply
of living organisms there is to
study and test, the more clues the
biotechnology industry will have
to find cures and treatments for
such diseases as AIDS, various
forms of cancer and herpes, to
produce a safer, more nutritious
food supply, and to find better
ways to clean up the environ
ment.

nies rely on the rich diversity of
the Earth's organisms for build
ing blocks to develop products. In
fact, 25 percent of the prescrip
tion drugs in the U.S. are derived
from natural products extracted
from plants, and many of today's
most valuable pharmaceuticals
have plant origins. For example,
quinine, which is used to fight
malaria; vinblastine, used to treat
certain cancers; and pilocarpine
for glaucoma were developed
from tropical plant extracts. In
addition, well-known aspirin and
taxol originated from plants.
Some biopharmaceutical com
panies find clues from tropical
plants found in species-rich tropi-

cal forests which house over half of
our planet's estimated 500,000
plant species. By integrating the
sciences of ethnobotany (the study
of how indigenous peoples use
plants), medicine and plant natu
ral-products, chemistry has been
able to achieve time and cost sav
ings in active compound identifica
tion and preclinical development.
Today, however, the accelerat
ing rate of the destruction of the
tropical forests, where most bio
logical species have evolved,
threatens the wealth and health
of the biological diversity of our
planet. If current rates of the loss
of tropical forest habitats contin
ue, present and future genera
tions will lose 20 percent of all
species by the year 2020. Since
genetic diversity within species is
the raw material for drug discov
ery this is a serious problem for
natural-products biopharmaceu
tical companies.
America has not only been the
melting pot of people, but the food
brought with the waves of immi
grants to the U.S. To stress the
importance of foreign plants and
animals to the U.S., let's look
back to the time when the settlers
first landed in America. Native
plants consisted of cranberries,
tobacco and sunflowers. Buffalo,
turkey and longhorn cattle were
the native sources of meat. Over
99 percent of the commercial
crops planted today are not
indigenous to the U.S.
Access to the diverse species of
plants from countries around the
globe has provided U.S. agricul
ture with the genetic resources to
provide the American people with
the safest, most abundant, nutri
tious food supply in the world.
Bioagriculture companies count
on access to foreign plant species
for hybridization of heartier, dis
ease-resistant crops.
Bioremediation can clean up
the environment by finding solu
tions through the microscopic
world of bacteria and other
microorganisms. Microorganisms
with specific properties such as
reducing hydrocarbons in oil
spills or breaking down PCBs in
waterways have been found in
nature, then harnessed through
biotechnology to clean up toxic
waste. Through biotechnology
research, microorganisms located
in the depths of hot springs and
in ocean rifts are analyzed to find
benefits in their unique proper
ties. Access to these organisms is
key.
Today, the U.S. leads the
world with technological innova
tion and new company formation

in biotechnology. The continuing
success of the U.S. biotechnology
industry depends largely on the
conservation and further explo
ration of the Earth's biodiversity.
The Convention on Biological
Diversity was conceived with the
mission of preserving the Earth's
biodiversity. The Biodiversity
Treaty, as written, is an
admirable set of policy goals
which have at their core the con
servation of biological diversity,
and the sustainable use of bene
fits arising out of the utilization

of genetic resources. Although
the treaty is vague in the areas of
intellectual property and technol
ogy transfer, the Biotechnology
Industry Organization (BIO) is
confident the U.S. government
can work with the signatories of
the treaty to on implementation
to iron out any wrinkles that
would run counter to our nation
al interests.
810 has urged the Senate to
ratify the Treaty on the Conven
tion on Biological Diversity in
order to secure a chair at the

table of the Conference of the
Parties (COP). The COP is com
posed of the nations that have
already ratified the treaty.
By working within the con
fines of the COP, the U.S. will be
able to protect the interests of
the biotechnology industry.
While the U.S. does not have a
seat at the bargaining table,
other industrialized countries,
such as Japan, Germany, France
and the U.K. do. The way to
avoid highly restrictive policies
affecting the commerce of geneti

cally modified organisms is to be
involved in the negotiations. The
U.S. needs to become a party to
the treaty and educate the rest of
the world to this fact.
Finally, all countries will lose
if inadequate or nonexistent con
servation policies allow destruc
tion of the biodiversity in devel
oping countries. Quite simply,
neither the U.S. nor any other
nation can afford to let this hap
pen. Preservation of the planet's
biodiversity is important to
everyone.
