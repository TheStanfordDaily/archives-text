### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
New statistics from the Office
of the Sexual Harassment Coordi
nating Adviser reveal that last
year there were findings of sexual
harassment in two of four formal
grievances and in 13 of 20 com
plaints, as well as the resolution of
48 informal concerns.
In her first annual report to
University President Gerhard
Casper, Sexual Harassment Coor
dinating Adviser Laraine Zappert
compiled statistics of alleged sex
ual harassment at Stanford dur
ing the period December 1993 to
December 1994.
"Dr. Zappert's report reflects a
good start under a new policy and
procedures and will be a great
help as we continue to implement
and improve them. Our goal is to

deal with harassment properly
and effectively and, ultimately, to
deter it," Casper said in a state
ment yesterday. "We are deter
mined that sexual harassment
and all forms of sexual intimida
tion and exploitation never be tol
erated at Stanford."
Zappert, a clinical associate
professor of psychiatry, said that
the report "represents a new and
hopefully more organized way of
collecting and reporting statistics
on incidents of alleged sexual ha
rassment."
According to Zappert's statis
tics, 60 of the allegations of sexual
harassment were brought forth
by women and 17 by men. In 57 of
the 60 cases of women alleging
sexual harassment, the allegation
was made against a man. Seven
men reported same-sex harass
ment and nine men alleged that
women had harassed them.
In addition, the statistics show
that the most frequent allegations
came from undergraduates, who
filed 26 claims. In comparison,
staff members made 23 allega
tions, while graduate students and
faculty reported 15 and six cases,
respectively.
Undergraduates most frequent
ly cited other undergraduates as
their alleged harassers; similarly,
staff cited other staff and faculty
cited other faculty.
Zappert said it is difficult to say
how Stanford's statistics compare
to other sc.iuols, considering that
she does not know how other
schools define sexual harassment
or what their reporting procedures
are.
"The best bet is to compare this
year's statistics to next year's," she
said. "But even then, you have to
recognize that our reporting proce

uures are still being mined.
Zappert leads a panel of faculty
and staff members wh is cre
ated early last year to c. .» up and
implement the University's sexual
harassment policy.
The policy, which was adopted
in October 1993, prohibits any
form of sexual harassment and
includes guidelines for procedural
actions and implementation pro
cesses.
Under the new policy, Zappert
said there has been an increase in
the number of alleged incidents of
sexual harassment reported. She
attributed this increase to height
ened awareness of the issue.
In addition to releasing statis
tics, Zappert's report includes
information about current efforts
to train and educate the Stanford
community about issues, of sexual
harassment.
According to the report, Zap
pert has helped develop training
programs for the University's 18
sexual harassment advisers and
sue panelists. Members of these
groups meet once a month for on
going training, which has
addressed such issues as how to

conduct sexual harassment com
plaint investigations.
Increased efforts have also been
made in the past year to educate
the Stanford community about
sexual harassment issues. Accord
ing to Zappert's report, a series of
departmentally-based sexual
harassment briefings are currently
being conducted.
These briefings, which are con
ducted by an attorney from the
University's Office of the General
Counsel and a sexual harassment
panelist or adviser, are also period
ically held for staff members.
According to Zappert, a new,
expanded orientation program for
students next fall will further
help heighten campus awareness
about issues of sexual harass
ment.
Assoc. Dean of the School of
Earth Sciences David Gordon, a
sexual harassment panelist, said
that such activities are beneficial
for staff and faculty. "It's a useful
way to discuss issues of sexual
harassment so that people under
stand it better and become more
aware of and sensitive to it,"he
said.
