## Kaki Bernard Recent tragedies are reminders of importance of treating mental illness 
### 
TWO WEEKS AGO, Patrick Thomas
Dunn, a graduate student in chem
istry, sat in his Escondido Village
apartment and administered to himself a
lethal dose of cyanide. A few days later a
premed undergraduate at Harvard
stabbed her roommate to death, barricad
ed herself in her dormitory bathroom,
and put her neck in a noose. Both of these
events pierced me to the soul as I heard
about them. I cannot quite accept the con
ventional wisdom which interprets hor
rors such as these as tragic, but entirely
unpredictable events, as an unpleasant
but inevitable element of modern Ameri
can existence. These are the sort of events
over which our society shakes its collec
tive head and sighs, "How awful," but
they do not really surprise us, and they do
not manage to intrude into the warp and
weave of our days beyond a very superfi
cial level, unless the suicide was commit-

thought and literature.

ted by someone we know well. In other
words, we avoid making personal connec
tions with such events, and with the rea
sons for them.
Unfortunately, I am unable to main
tain this critical distance. It seems to me
that it is not going too far to suggest that
anyone who commits suicide is mentally
unwell, and this gives me great pause,
because I was diagnosed two years ago
with what by any medical definition is a
mental illness. This is not something of
which all my friends and acquaintances
are aware, and it is something which
those who are aware, I suspect, have often
found it difficult to believe, because I am
what might be described as a "successful
person," as are by definition most stu
dents at universities such as Stanford.
In my case, illness manifests itself in
the form of periods of an all-encompass
ing and paralyzing despair; these may last
for a few days or for many months. It is
impossible to predict these descents,
although I am learning to minimize the
conditions, such as stress, which facilitate

them. The clinical, but disappointingly
banal name for this condition is "chronic
major depression," and it is more com
mon among certain sectors of U.S. soci
ety, such as women, adolescents, and the
elderly, than among others. It is an illness
with a high fatality rate, meaning that a
disturbing number of people who feel
what I do end up killing themselves.
I know from experience that the atmo
sphere at a prestigious university is not
one conducive to seeking mental help,
because to do so is interpreted as a sign of
weakness. We are, as a society, unable and
unwilling to deal with the issue of mental
health. We tend to equate the term "men
tally ill" with that of "berserk," conjuring
up images of unwashed bag ladies con
ducting conversations with invisible part
ners. This definition paints the afflicted
as a lost cause, and seeks to open as vast a
divide as possible between the ill and nor
malcy. Occasionally we interpret mental
illness romantically, describing the afflict
ed as sane in an insane world, or as a vic
tim of society's low tolerance for deviant

behavior. This definition, while it appears
more complimentary, actually serves to
delegitimize the experience of the mental
ly ill by equating it with poetic concepts
and not with their real-life suffering.
Whenever useful, moreover, we simply
fail to recognize the existence of mental
illness — this is why insurance companies
offer far less coverage for mental-health
costs than for other chronic conditions.
At a place like Stanford or Harvard,
the pressure to excel is enormous, and so,
therefore, is the pressure not to fail. Aca
demic life is constructed around grades,
ratings, tests, deadlines, and competition.
As the cost of tuition increases, so does
the imperative to succeed, which in our
culture is painted in terms of power and
prestige, not in terms of mental well
being. To seek mental help, especially if it
involves the use of psychiatric medica
tion, is to admit something embarrassing
and is looked upon with disdain, and is
usually not done until the situation
becomes desperate, and often not even
then.

Learning to live with a mental illness
has meant abandoning many of the guide
lines with which I grew up. It meant tak
ing twice as long as usual to complete my
honors thesis, despite the frequent friend
ly and exasperating warnings that if I
didn't finish by X or Y date, I never would.
It meant realizing that many of those
whom I loved, including my parents,
would never quite comprehend the quali
tatively different nature of pathological
depression from a passing blue mood. It
meant learning to live with articles such
as one I spied in Newsweek in 1993 enti
tled "Virtual Prozac," whereby the
author foregoes this "wonder drug of the
century" and chooses instead to "just get
over it," an option I would gladly have
selected, if only I could. And it has meant,
finally, an inability to divorce myself from
the suicides of two young scholars, and
the murder of a third, because I cannot
help but wonder how very differently
things might have turned out if as much
priority was given to mental health as to a
flawless GPA.
