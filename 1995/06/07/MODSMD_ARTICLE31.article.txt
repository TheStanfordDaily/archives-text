A: You'd better go check in your own bath
tub, because I hate to teil you this, but
there is no regularity in the way bathtubs
drain. There is an effect that could cause some
slight asymmetry; this is known as the Coriolis
effect. However, it is so small on the bathtub
scale that it's insignificant.
On the other hand, the Coriolis effect docs
cause hurricanes and weather fronts to circu
late in opposite directions. Also, any aspiring
missile-builders will know that the Coriolis
effect causes long-distance projectiles to deviate
from a seemincrlv straight Dath.

The Coriolis effect results from the fact that
the earth is spinning at a constant angular
velocity: it goes around once in 24 hours. How
ever, at higher latitudes, the distance a point
moves in going around a complete circle
decreases. This means that bananas at the
equator are moving at a thousand miles per
hour, while the penguins at the North Pole
aren't moving at all.
Now imagine a huge water balloon launched
north from the equator. In addition to its
northward velocity, it's moving eastward at
over a thousand miles per hour due to the rota
tion of the earth.
As it moves north, however, the ground
underneath is progressively moving slower and
slower, while the water balloon maintains its
original velocity. So relative to ground, the bal
loon starts curving eastward. This is the
essence of the Coriolis effect.
Of course, there is no actual "force" causing
the balloon to curve. If you were looking from
somewhere off in space, the balloon would be
moving in a straight line. It is simply relative to
the moving earth that it seems to curve.
Down in the southern hemisphere, every
thing is reversed. Objects moving north are
moving toward the equator, rather than away
from it. So objects tend to veer toward the left.
This effect is significant for intercontinental
missiles, weather systems and even plane
Hights. However, in your bathtub, the water
doesn't travel over a distance large enough so
that at one end of your bathtub the earth is
moving sufficiently faster to create a noticeable
effect.
In fact, there are countless other effects that
would have much more impact on the draining
of the water. The shape of the bathtub, the way
you open the drain, even wiggling your toes in
the water, are more significant in determining
bathwater dynamics.
Of course, there was one group of scientists
who attempted to show that, although small,
the Coriolis force is acting on bathwater. They
constructed perfectly smooth, symmetric bath
tubs, and allowed the water to settle for days,
so that there would be no residual currents.
They even controlled the air currents in the
room and designed a special plug and drain to
reduce turbulence upon opening.
And, as it turned out, there was a slight
majority of counterclockwise draining in the
Northern Hemisphere, and a slight majority of
clockwise in the Southern.
However, unless you take your baths under
such scientifically controlled conditions, I think
you'll find that there really isn't much correla
tion.
