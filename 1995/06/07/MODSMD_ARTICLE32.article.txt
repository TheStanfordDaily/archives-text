# AIDS vaccine causes scientific controversy
## 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
At first it seemed like another miracle drug: A vac
cine called gpl2o which would prevent infection with
HIV, a weapon against a disease that ravages nations
around the world.
Although gpl2o was successful in preventing HIV
infection in chimpanzees and appeared to be safe for
human volunteers, the vaccine is not currently tested
in the United States.
A vaccine for AIDS sounds like a project that most
people would support. However, gpl2o has been on a
rocky road since researchers began testing it in
humans. Scientific and political communities alike
have raised questions about the quality of the vaccine
and the issues surrounding large-scale testing of
gpl2o in the United States.
A possible breakthrough?
The vaccine has sparked a great scientific debate.
The federal government has refused to support
widespread testing in the United States. Further
more, Genentech, the South San Francisco-based
company that created and manufactures the vaccine,
has cut the size of the gpl2o lab from 30 people to four
full-time workers.
Researcher Don Francis, a researcher for Genen
tech who helped eradicate smallpox, is the last crusad
er for gpl2o. He is insistent that gpl2o works or can
work in the near future, but without funding, he will
never be able to prove it.
"If the world wanted a vaccine, we could do it," said
Francis. But his own experience with gpl2o demon
strates that it is not so easy, even with a disease as
prevalent as AIDS.
The vaccine was initially tested on six chim
panzees, which can be infected with human HIV, but
never show physical symptoms of the disease. For this
reason, they are not ideal models for AIDS in humans,
but they are as close as possible.
Francis and his lab inoculated two chimps with a
full series of gpl2o shots, two with another vaccine
called gpl6o and two with a placebo. They then "chal
lenged" the animals with large intravenous doses of
HIV. Neither of the two injected with gpl2o became
infected with HIV. The four other chimps were infect
ed.
"I knew it when those chimps were protected. We
were on our way to an AIDS vaccine." said Francis.
Since the chimps appeared to suffer no side effects
from the vaccine, testing began on human volunteers.
Vaccines work by exposing people to dead viruses
or parts of viruses, so that the body will mount an
immune response against the virus and produce anti
bodies that will kill it. Even after the initial dose of the
virus is destroyed by the body, the body "remembers"
it and produces antibodies to mount a fast and strong
attack if it ever comes in contact with the virus again.
In the case of gpl2o. the coat of protein surround
ing the genetic material of HIV is used to make the
vaccine. The body recognizes the protein gpl2o as a
virus coat and produces antibodies to destroy HIV.
Making a vaccine for HIV is difficult because there
are many strains of the virus. HIV is subdivided into
seven strains labeled A through G, each of which will
need a different vaccine. To make things worse, the
virus also alters its composition at a rapid rate.
The consequence of this alteration, called muta
tion, is that a virus can quickly become immune to a
drug. Drugs generally target a specific strain of the
virus, causing the formation of highly specific anti
bodies that am only recognize that one strain. Once
that strain changes, the antibodies have no effect.
For this reason, Francis expects the final product
to be a "cocktail" of protein coats in order to produce
enough different antibodies to handle mutations.
In order to be considered safe and marketable,
drugs must go through phases of testing in the Unit
ed States. Phase I and Phase II are usually limited to
groups of people smaller than 100 and test for safety
and side effects rather than effectiveness. Phase 111
testing involves up to 10,000 people who are tested to
determine the approximate percentage of effective
ness of the drug.

In early tests, people receiving gpl2o did produce
antibodies to HIV. These antibodies killed lab-pre
pared HIV when they were mixed with the virus.
However, Francis' lab ran into trouble when they
mixed the antibodies with virus taken from the body
of an infected individual. The antibodies had no effect
on the virus at all.
"I don't know why that happened and I won't until
further testing is done," says Francis. There is no sys
tem available which would clarify what makes lab-pro
duced HIV different from HIV in human bodies. This
makes it difficult to predict if a vaccine will protect
people when tests are done with lab-prepared HIV.
Tests must be done on humans in contact with HIV to
see if the vaccine works.
Research sent abroad
Last year, the National Institute for Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) decided not to put gpl2o
into Phase 111 testing. The decision was made after an
advisory board of AIDS researchers and community
groups advised NIAID director Anthony Fauci not to
test further at that time.
NIAID was initially supportive of gpl2o, funding
Phase I and II studies, but the advisoiy board said
that it simply did not see enough promise in gpl2o to
wammt spending another $20 to $50 million dollars
on testing.
The drug is currently being tested in Thailand
through a program set up by the Thai government
and (Jenentech. The Thai government has been recep
tive to testing HIV vaccines because 600,000 people in
Thailand are infected with HIV.
Thirty former intravenous drug users in Thailand
received the first of four injections with gpl2o in
February. The results of this test will not be known
for about 18 months because the shots are given over
the course of a year.
These trials have already caused some controversy
in the scientific and AIDS advocacy communities.
Chiron Biocine, a biotechnology firm, is also work
ing on a gpl2o vaccine and questions why the vaccine
being tested in Thailand is intended for the B strain of
AIDS when the most prevalent strain in Thailand is
the E strain. Francis says that Band E are similar
enough, and B is thus far the most prevalent strain in
the world.
Larry Kurz, a spokesperson for Chiron Biocine,
said that Chiron also intends to begin testing in Thai
land. "We are developing gp 120 that is targeted specif
ically for Thai strains, which should ensure more
accurate results," Kurz said.
Brenda Lein, the director of information and advo
cacy at Project Inform, a San Francisco-based AIDS
and health information center, thinks that what
Genentech is doing borders on the unethical. "The

ethics and the culture may change from here to Thai
land, but the science is the same and the science just
isn't there. We won't do it here, but it's OK to do it in
a developing nation?"
Both NIAID and Project Inform believe that the
social issues involved in testing an AIDS vaccine are
important to consider before testing out a product on
a large number of volunteers.
It is possible that being vaccinated will make vol
unteers believe that they are actually protected from
HIV and cause them to take greater risks than they
ordinarily would, such as not using proper sexual
hygiene or clean needles. Another consideration is
that if the drug actually fails or causes side effects,
government involvement in testing could lead to a
huge backlash by angry volunteers.
"According to Francis, this is just all that silly social
science stuff that isn't as important as finding out
what his drug actually does. But when you're talking
about 10,000 people, it's a big deal," Lein said.
Staying on target
But Francis still fights for the project, and so far he
has convinced Genentech to support him. Genentech
estimates that it has spent over $100 million on gpl2o
so far. "The value of the vaccine is reflected by what
society wants," he said.
Francis estimates that at the rate he is going now
he may still not have a completed vaccine in 10 years.
"The Thailand testing is a start, but the drug must be
tested more widely before we can determine what
needs to be added and removed so that it works most
effectively."
"If I had the money I would do it myself," says
Francis, who spends a quarter of his day on the tele
phone attempting to get funding for his lab. "We will
do it,"he says. "Slowly. That's not the way it should
be done, but that's how we do it."
But lxnn doesn't see gpl2o as the most promising
vaccine. Lein was a volunteer in Phase II testing of
gpl2o at the University of California at San Francisco
Medical Center. She and about 30 other volunteers
were chosen as "low risk" volunteers to test the safety
of the vaccine. Two volunteers have contracted AIDS
so far.
"The vaccine failed at preventing infection, and
may actually harm people who are infected after inoc
ulation." said Lein, referring to the unusually rapid
drop in immune system cells in some volunteers who
have contracted HIV after injections.
Another argument against gpl 20 is that it does not
promote immunity at the mucus membranes, which is
where the majority of sexually transmitted cases of
AIDS are contracted. Oral vaccines are in the works
which would be easier to administer and also appear to
provide the protection at the mucus membranes
which gpl2o does not.
Gene therapy is another possibility in the vaccine
field. A genetically altered form of HIV with a gene
from the herpes virus is being tested by the National
Institutes of Health. The altered HIV would be inject
ed into the body, cause antibody formation and then
be eradicated by a drug which kills the herpes virus.
Neither of these approaches are currently being
tested in humans. Francis claims that these methods
are too far off in the future, and that we must test
what we have available now. Francis may be
right, Greg Folker, a NIAID spokesman says: "If the
data from Thailand is good, the vaccine might be
reconsidered" for Phase 111 testing.
If it does not pass government scrutiny, Francis
and Genentech have the option to test, produce and
distribute the vaccine on their own. Genentech is
seeking a corporate sponsor for the vaccine in the
United States and the Thai government may support
efforts to build a production lab in Thailand. The vac
cine could conceivably be in wide distribution in Thai
land before it reaches the United States, Francis says.
Sitting in Francis' office is a clay sculpture of an
Indian goddess of smallpox, a disease that ravaged the
country until a vaccine which Francis worked on
stopped its progression. The statue has a hole in it
where offerings are put in the hope that the goddess
will take her plague elsewhere. Inside Francis' sculp
ture sit three little vials of gpl 20.

have raised questions about the quality of the vaccine
and the issues surrounding large-scale testing of
gpl2o in the United States.
A possible breakthrough?
The vaccine has sparked a great scientific debate.
The federal government has refused to support
widespread testing in the United States. Further
more, Genentech, the South San Francisco-based
company that created and manufactures the vaccine,
has cut the size of the gpl2o lab from 30 people to four
full-time workers.
Researcher Don Francis, a researcher for Genen
tech who helped eradicate smallpox, is the last crusad
er for gpl2o. He is insistent that gpl2o works or can
work in the near future, but without funding, he will
never be able to prove it.
"If the world wanted a vaccine, we could do it," said
Francis. But his own experience with gpl2o demon
strates that it is not so easy, even with a disease as
prevalent as AIDS.
The vaccine was initially tested on six chim
panzees, which can be infected with human HIV, but
never show physical symptoms of the disease. For this
reason, they are not ideal models for AIDS in humans,
but they are as close as possible.
Francis and his lab inoculated two chimps with a
full series of gpl2o shots, two with another vaccine
called gpl6o and two with a placebo. They then "chal
lenged" the animals with large intravenous doses of
HIV. Neither of the two injected with gpl2o became
infected with HIV. The four other chimps were infect
ed.
"I knew it when those chimps were protected. We
were on our way to an AIDS vaccine." said Francis.
Since the chimps appeared to suffer no side effects
from the vaccine, testing began on human volunteers.
Vaccines work by exposing people to dead viruses
or parts of viruses, so that the body will mount an
immune response against the virus and produce anti
bodies that will kill it. Even after the initial dose of the
virus is destroyed by the body, the body "remembers"
it and produces antibodies to mount a fast and strong
attack if it ever comes in contact with the virus again.
In the case of gpl2o. the coat of protein surround
ing the genetic material of HIV is used to make the
vaccine. The body recognizes the protein gpl2o as a
virus coat and produces antibodies to destroy HIV.
Making a vaccine for HIV is difficult because there
are many strains of the virus. HIV is subdivided into
seven strains labeled A through G, each of which will
need a different vaccine. To make things worse, the
virus also alters its composition at a rapid rate.
The consequence of this alteration, called muta
tion, is that a virus can quickly become immune to a
drug. Drugs generally target a specific strain of the
virus, causing the formation of highly specific anti
bodies that am only recognize that one strain. Once
that strain changes, the antibodies have no effect.
For this reason, Francis expects the final product
to be a "cocktail" of protein coats in order to produce
enough different antibodies to handle mutations.
In order to be considered safe and marketable,
drugs must go through phases of testing in the Unit
ed States. Phase I and Phase II are usually limited to
groups of people smaller than 100 and test for safety
and side effects rather than effectiveness. Phase 111
testing involves up to 10,000 people who are tested to
determine the approximate percentage of effective
ness of the drug.

In early tests, people receiving gpl2o did produce
antibodies to HIV. These antibodies killed lab-pre
pared HIV when they were mixed with the virus.
However, Francis' lab ran into trouble when they
mixed the antibodies with virus taken from the body
of an infected individual. The antibodies had no effect
on the virus at all.
"I don't know why that happened and I won't until
further testing is done," says Francis. There is no sys
tem available which would clarify what makes lab-pro
duced HIV different from HIV in human bodies. This
makes it difficult to predict if a vaccine will protect
people when tests are done with lab-prepared HIV.
Tests must be done on humans in contact with HIV to
see if the vaccine works.
Research sent abroad
Last year, the National Institute for Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) decided not to put gpl2o
into Phase 111 testing. The decision was made after an
advisory board of AIDS researchers and community
groups advised NIAID director Anthony Fauci not to
test further at that time.
NIAID was initially supportive of gpl2o, funding
Phase I and II studies, but the advisoiy board said
that it simply did not see enough promise in gpl2o to
wammt spending another $20 to $50 million dollars
on testing.
The drug is currently being tested in Thailand
through a program set up by the Thai government
and (Jenentech. The Thai government has been recep
tive to testing HIV vaccines because 600,000 people in
Thailand are infected with HIV.
Thirty former intravenous drug users in Thailand
received the first of four injections with gpl2o in
February. The results of this test will not be known
for about 18 months because the shots are given over
the course of a year.
These trials have already caused some controversy
in the scientific and AIDS advocacy communities.
Chiron Biocine, a biotechnology firm, is also work
ing on a gpl2o vaccine and questions why the vaccine
being tested in Thailand is intended for the B strain of
AIDS when the most prevalent strain in Thailand is
the E strain. Francis says that Band E are similar
enough, and B is thus far the most prevalent strain in
the world.
Larry Kurz, a spokesperson for Chiron Biocine,
said that Chiron also intends to begin testing in Thai
land. "We are developing gp 120 that is targeted specif
ically for Thai strains, which should ensure more
accurate results," Kurz said.
Brenda Lein, the director of information and advo
cacy at Project Inform, a San Francisco-based AIDS
and health information center, thinks that what
Genentech is doing borders on the unethical. "The

ethics and the culture may change from here to Thai
land, but the science is the same and the science just
isn't there. We won't do it here, but it's OK to do it in
a developing nation?"
Both NIAID and Project Inform believe that the
social issues involved in testing an AIDS vaccine are
important to consider before testing out a product on
a large number of volunteers.
It is possible that being vaccinated will make vol
unteers believe that they are actually protected from
HIV and cause them to take greater risks than they
ordinarily would, such as not using proper sexual
hygiene or clean needles. Another consideration is
that if the drug actually fails or causes side effects,
government involvement in testing could lead to a
huge backlash by angry volunteers.
"According to Francis, this is just all that silly social
science stuff that isn't as important as finding out
what his drug actually does. But when you're talking
about 10,000 people, it's a big deal," Lein said.
Staying on target
But Francis still fights for the project, and so far he
has convinced Genentech to support him. Genentech
estimates that it has spent over $100 million on gpl2o
so far. "The value of the vaccine is reflected by what
society wants," he said.
Francis estimates that at the rate he is going now
he may still not have a completed vaccine in 10 years.
"The Thailand testing is a start, but the drug must be
tested more widely before we can determine what
needs to be added and removed so that it works most
effectively."
"If I had the money I would do it myself," says
Francis, who spends a quarter of his day on the tele
phone attempting to get funding for his lab. "We will
do it,"he says. "Slowly. That's not the way it should
be done, but that's how we do it."
But lxnn doesn't see gpl2o as the most promising
vaccine. Lein was a volunteer in Phase II testing of
gpl2o at the University of California at San Francisco
Medical Center. She and about 30 other volunteers
were chosen as "low risk" volunteers to test the safety
of the vaccine. Two volunteers have contracted AIDS
so far.
"The vaccine failed at preventing infection, and
may actually harm people who are infected after inoc
ulation." said Lein, referring to the unusually rapid
drop in immune system cells in some volunteers who
have contracted HIV after injections.
Another argument against gpl 20 is that it does not
promote immunity at the mucus membranes, which is
where the majority of sexually transmitted cases of
AIDS are contracted. Oral vaccines are in the works
which would be easier to administer and also appear to
provide the protection at the mucus membranes
which gpl2o does not.
Gene therapy is another possibility in the vaccine
field. A genetically altered form of HIV with a gene
from the herpes virus is being tested by the National
Institutes of Health. The altered HIV would be inject
ed into the body, cause antibody formation and then
be eradicated by a drug which kills the herpes virus.
Neither of these approaches are currently being
tested in humans. Francis claims that these methods
are too far off in the future, and that we must test
what we have available now. Francis may be
right, Greg Folker, a NIAID spokesman says: "If the
data from Thailand is good, the vaccine might be
reconsidered" for Phase 111 testing.
If it does not pass government scrutiny, Francis
and Genentech have the option to test, produce and
distribute the vaccine on their own. Genentech is
seeking a corporate sponsor for the vaccine in the
United States and the Thai government may support
efforts to build a production lab in Thailand. The vac
cine could conceivably be in wide distribution in Thai
land before it reaches the United States, Francis says.
Sitting in Francis' office is a clay sculpture of an
Indian goddess of smallpox, a disease that ravaged the
country until a vaccine which Francis worked on
stopped its progression. The statue has a hole in it
where offerings are put in the hope that the goddess
will take her plague elsewhere. Inside Francis' sculp
ture sit three little vials of gpl 20.

At first it seemed like another miracle drug: A vac
cine called gpl2o which would prevent infection with
HIV, a weapon against a disease that ravages nations
around the world.

infection in chimpanzees and appeared to be safe for
human volunteers, the vaccine is not currently tested
in the United States.
