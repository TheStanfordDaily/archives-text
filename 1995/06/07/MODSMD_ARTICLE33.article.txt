# How short is too tall for hormone therapy?
## 
### Stacey Harp Contributing writer 
As many "vertically challenged" peo
ple will tell you, it can be tough to be
short in a world designed for the taller
majority. Even at 5'3" it is difficult to
reach the top shelf in many grocery
stores.
There are, however, a group of peo
ple who have a much more serious
problem with their stature. Many of
them have a deficiency in human
growth hormone or somatotropin, a
hormone normally produced by the
pituitary gland in the brain.
Girls who are deficient in growth
hormone rarely grow taller than 4' 10"
while boys are often under 5'2" if the
condition is left untreated. Extremely
short children are often picked on at
school, possibly leading to low self
esteem. As adults, some may never be
able to touch the floor with their feet
when sitting in a chair, they may have
trouble driving and certainly have prob
lems reaching objects placed in high
cabinets.
Raymond Hintz, a pediatric endocri
nologist at Stanford Medical Center
and the head of a recent study on
growth hormone therapy, said that
although these children may be
extremely short, many have no other
problems.
"If it were not for the fact that they
have to deal with a world built for taller
people, many of them would be perfect
ly functional human beings," Hintz
explained.
Because of this, some critics of
growth hormone therapy claim that
treating short stature is akin to treating
a problem rather than preventing its
cause. They suggest that research

should focus on fighting discrimination
against people with short stature rather
than treating the victims of discrimina
tion medically.
Hintz is now involved in a study to
shed new light on the question of which
children should receive growth hor
mone and when.
The background of the debate
stretches back to 1958, when the first
child was treated with growth hormone
extracted from the pituitary gland of
human cadavers.
While successful, this form of treat
ment had two major flaws. First, the
quantities of growth hormone available
were limited and could not be supplied
to all hormone-deficient children. Sec
ond, it was found that growth hormone
from cadavers could transmit
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a deadly
neurological disorder, to the recipients
of the hormone.
In 1985, Genentech became the first
biotechnology company to successfully
produce growth hormone through
genetic engineering techniques similar
to those employed to manufacture syn
thetic insulin for diabetics. The manu
facture of synthetic growth hormone
effectively eliminated the threat of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease while simul
taneously increasing the available sup
ply of human growth hormone.
Now the use of this growth hormone
has become a widely controversial issue
and ethical concerns have been raised,
especially regarding the use of the hor
mone to treat children who are short
but not deficient in growth hormone.
Hintz has been at the helm of a
study, sponsored by Genentech, to
examine the benefits of treating chil
dren "who are as short as and share a
lot of characteristics with children with

growth hormone deficiency who, when
tested, don't fit [the criteria for treat
ment] for one reason or another," he
explained.
Hintz admitted that current meth
ods of testing are relatively crude.
Although individuals may have differ
ent needs, decisions are made based on
the precise amount of hormone the
child produces. If it is below an arbi
trarily determined threshold, the child
will be eligible for treatment; if it is
above that level, therapy will often be
denied.
If these children could be looked at
over time or in a different way, they
might qualify for treatment, Hintz said.
He suspects that while these children
make too much hormone to be consid
ered for treatment, they don't make
enough for their growth needs. Cur
rently, however, there are no accepted
methods to make that kind of determi
nation.
The study led by Hintz was conduct
ed on 42 children at a number of insti
tutions — including Stanford, Johns
Hopkins, UC-San Francisco and UCLA
— and has been going on for almost 10
years now.
The study was designed to address
two questions: Would growth hormone
therapy make the children grow faster
and would it ultimately make a differ
ence in their adult heights? As expect
ed, their growth rate increased. More
importantly, the adult height of the
study group increased "by an average of
two to three inches over a control group
with similar characteristics," Hintz
said.
In this light, it would seem that the
children examined have much in com
mon with children who have growth
hormone deficiency. The challenge is

choosing which children to treat.
Treatment is expensive. At about
$'20,000 a year, therapy may be inacces
sible to some children. While insurance
companies often cover the expenses of
children with documented hormone
deficiencies, those in Hintz' study
would not qualify for coverage.
In addition, many parents want
their children to have every advantage
in life and some are very aggressive in
pursuing medical treatment that may
or may not be needed. "It is important,"
Hintz emphasized, "that treatment not
be limited to those children with rich or
aggressive parents."
Hintz was quick to point out, howev
er, that not all of the children in the
study benefited from treatment. "By
our calculations, roughly half had at
least a two-inch benefit over predicted
height," he said, "but that means that
50 percent did not have that benefit."
Hintz compares the selection of
patients for growth hormone therapy to
the selection of patients for heart trans
plants. Although receiving growth hor
mone is not a matter of life or death,
few predictors are known to calculate
the likelihood of success of treatment
and the monetary cost to society is sig
nificant.
"Selecting patients for treatment
needs to be done in a fair way in which
people are chosen on the basis of the
likelihood they will be significantly
short," Hintz explained. He suggests
that the growth rate and height of the
child be considered in addition to the
level of hormone production in making
treatment decisions.
"I think we have to do some further
thinking and further research as to the
best way to choose people for growth
hormone therapy," Hintz said.
