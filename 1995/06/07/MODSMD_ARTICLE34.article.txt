# Faculty Senate to face new DR, CIV proposals
## 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
The Commission on Undergraduate
Education recommendations will per
haps face their greatest test of the year
tomorrow, when the Faculty Senate
attempts to resolve its differences over
distribution requirements and the Cul
ture, Ideas and Values program and
brings the matter to a vote.
The commission originally recom
mended that the CIV curriculum be
altered to encompass the World Cultures
and American Cultures DRs, but after
complaints from a number of CIV
instructors and other faculty members,
the proposal was revised a number of
times.
Last week, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies — assigned by the sen
ate to create a new proposal — returned
with a proposal entirely different from
either the commission's original recom
mendation or the senate resolution
passed in March.
"I would be fascinated to know where
the C-US proposal came from," said CIV
Program Director Paul Seaver, a history
professor. "We now have an entirely dif
ferent proposal. I don't know where it
came from and I don't know why."
In early January, the commission's
recommendations faced their first major
opposition when 40 CTV faculty members
published a letter contending that the

commission recommendations would
place unreasonable burdens on CIV fac
ulty.
After some debate, the senate
approved a compromise plan in March in
which a CIV track would fulfill one addi
tional DR out of the World Cultures,
American Cultures, Literature and Fine
Arts, Philosophical, Social and Religious
Thought and Social and Behavioral Sci
ences DRs. Students would then be
required to take three more humanities
and sciences courses.
Through a series of resolutions, the
senate charged C-US with designing a
plan based on that compromise, which
was submitted last week.
The new plan would leave CIV in its
current state while relaxing the DR sys
tem to require students to take three cer
tified courses in the humanities and
social sciences and three in science, engi
neering and mathematics, rather than
requiring classes in more narrowly
defined categories of study, as under the
current system.
In this sense the C-US proposal is sim
ilar in form to the breadth requirements
in place prior to 1980, which required that
students take three courses from human
ities and social sciences and three from
science, mathematics and engineering.
The World Cultures and American
Cultures DRs would be fulfilled in much
the same way as the Gender Studies
requirement is now, through courses des

ignated by asterisks.
Some faculty members worried that
the more broadly defined subject areas of
the C-US plan would allow students too
much leeway in designing programs.
For instance, History Prof. Judith
Brown said an economics major could
satisfy the technical requirements by tak
ing Statistics 190 and two calculus cours
es and could satisfy the humanities and
social sciences requirements with three
social sciences courses.
"Such a student would have [apart
from CIV | no exposure to the humanities
and no exposure to a large part of the . . .
sciences," Brown said.
"I actually felt like there was a fair
consensus [about] what everyone want
ed," she said. "I'm hopeful that we'll be
able to come to some position."
C-US chair David Brady, a political sci
ence professor, said he did not prefer the
committee plan to the senate's original
resolutions, but he pointed out that the
committee plan would allow students to
follow more concentrated paths of study
in their areas of interest.
"It emphasizes depth over breadth,"
he said.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood said the
senate's Steering Committee is working
on a compromise proposal that would
provide a sort of middle ground between
the strictly defined DRs of the current
system and the more flexible DRs of the
committee plan.
