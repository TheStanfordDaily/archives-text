Man harasses Shultz
In five different cases, a man described
as "mentally unstable" by Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer has been harassing
Hoover Institution Distinguished Fellow
and former U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz.
I he man, whose name police would not
release, first contacted Shultz on May 3. He
called Shultz's office and also faxed him a
"nonsensical" letter, said Niemeyer. "It
uses a lot of big words that are not connect
ed," he said.
The man returned May 11 to hand-deliv
er a letter and on May 15, he delivered an
entire packet of "nonsensical information,"
Niemeyer said. The man was found outside
of Hoover on May 19, after he had delivered
another letter to Shultz's office. Police fin
gerprinted and photographed him, then
released him at the scene. In the latest inci
dent, the man phoned Shultz's office on May
26 and expressed a desire to talk to Shultz.
"The staff have been cautioned not to
take anything from this man," Niemeyer
said. "We know what he looks like and
(that) he wants to see Shultz and get in to
talk to him."
Niemeyer described the suspect as a
white male, more than 200 pounds and in
his 30s.
President's office break-in
In yet another incident involving the
president's office, five suspects were seen
fleeing from a steam tunnel by Building 10
in what was later determined to be a bur

glary.
According to Stanford Police Sgt. John
McMullen, an alarm in the president's
office was activated at about 1 a.m. on May
29. When police arrived a few minutes later,
they saw five suspects running from the
scene.
"The police attempted to contact them,"
McMullen said, "but they kept on running."
McMullen said the suspects left the build
ing because they knew they had set off the
alarm. The police tried to surround the area
afterwards, but the suspects had already
fled, he said.
He added that the suspects entered the
building via a small door located in the
basement. "They must have forced the door
open, applying so much pressure that it
forced the screws out of the hinges,"
McMullen said.
Nothing was taken from or disturbed in
Building 10. Earlier in the year, two sepa
rate groups of students broke in to the pres
ident's office. In one case, two students pled
guilty to misdemeanor trespassing and
were sentenced to 100 hours of community
service. In the second case, the four stu
dents have pled not guilty and are awaiting
trial.
Frats at war with each other
Members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Phi Delta Theta fraternities have
been involved in an escalating rivalry for
the last few weeks, according to police
reports.
"There has been a whole litany of bizarre
events between the two fraternities," said

Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
According to Niemeyer, the first report
ed case occurred on May 24, when an SAE
member reported that Phi Delts were
throwing fresh fruit at the SAE house.
Niemeyer said that the SAEs also found
a dead skunk in their house with a cue ball
in its mouth. The fraternity members have
also been throwing a variety of materials,
such as syrup, on each others' pool tables,
he added.
"This rivalry culminated in a fist fight
that broke out recently," Niemeyer said.
Since the frats did not want any police
involvement, the fraternity presidents met
and have called an apparent cease-fire, he
said.
Betas joyride in golf cart
Three individuals who live in the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity allegedly vandalized
two bikes with a golf cart on May 25.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, the students borrowed the cart
from another Beta resident who was not
involved in the activity. They then decided
to use the golf cart to run over bikes,
Niemeyer said.
The students succeeded in causing dam
age to two bikes in front of Wilbur Hall.
Niemeyer added that two of the suspects
were identified immediately, and one ran
away but later admitted to being involved.
The case has been sent to the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office for fur
ther review and could lead to charges
against the suspects, Niemeyer said.
