# TACCLE tackles drugs in local high schools
## 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
A program based at Stanford
has San Jose high school students
surveying their classmates about
drug use as well as designing slo
gans and emblems discouraging
the use of cigarettes, alcohol and
other drugs.
The program — Teen Activists
for Community Change and Lead
ership Education — began last
September and continues to moti

vate high school students from
low-income backgrounds to design
projects against substance abuse.
"Students design projects
around substance abuse preven
tion that impact the communities
in which they live," said Elaine
Tencati, TACCLE's field coordina
tor.
The Stanford Center for
Research Disease and Prevention
is sponsoring the project for stu
dents in Daly City, Sunnyvale and
San Jose and encourages students

to choose alcohol, tobacco or drugs
as a focus for projects.
"The goal is to do something
that affects the larger communi
ty," Tencati said.
For example, some students met
with their principal with the hope
of having signs posted around the
school indicating that it's a non
smoking campus. After many
meetings and lengthy discussions
signs are currently posted around
the school.
Another group of students

designed slogans and drawings dis
couraging the use of cigarettes,
alcohol and drugs. These drawings
will appear on key chains, T-shirts
and fliers that will be distributed in
the school and community.
"Many people who smoke, drink
or use drugs started in their teens,"
said Marilyn Winkleby, a senior sci
entist at the center who is conduct
ing a study of the program's
impacts in the hopes of creating a
model for the future.
'"We're trying to study whether
participation in community advo
cacy programs can prevent or delay
the onset of substance abuse in
teens," she said.
Other current student projects
include: working with a national
group called Students against

Tobacco to get signatures for a peti
tion banning smoking and tobacco
sponsorship at the 1996 Summer
Olympics; lobbying for enforce
ment and adoption of local ordi
nances limiting tobacco and alcohol
use; meeting with newspapers to
eliminate tobacco and alcohol
advertisements; and teaching mid
dle school students about the dan
gers of substance abuse.
Currently, 40 students are
working on the program and Win
kleby hopes to add 80 more stu

dents. The 120 students will be
compared with a control group of
120 students from similar back
grounds who lack the program's
workshops. All students will be
surveyed for substance abuse activ
ities before and after the program.
"Ultimately, the goal is to
empower youth by giving them
confidence, personal empowerment
and leadership so that they can
take the steps to make their com
munity a better place," Tencati
said.
