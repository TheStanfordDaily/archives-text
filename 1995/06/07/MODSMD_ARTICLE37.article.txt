# Stanford credit union plans Tresidder branch
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
As part of changes planned for
Tresidder Union next year, the
Stanford Federal Credit Union
will soon be opening a branch
there.
The bank is planning to open
its Tresidder branch as soon as
possible. At this point, the pro
ject's start is dependent upon
the University and on govern
mental building inspectors,
according to Sam Tuohey, mar
keting vice president for the
credit union.
"We'd love to be in before the
fall term," he said. "We're cer
tainly planning on it."
The new office will be located
on the second floor of Tresidder,
in an area that formerly housed
administrative offices. "We'll
have three ATMs and at least
four staff, maybe five," including
a student loan officer, Tuohey
said.
In addition, computer termi
nals will be available in the new
office for students to access the
credit union's online service —
CU Online — and World Wide
Web page. During banking hours,
a "helper" will be available to aid
customers in using these services,
Tuohey said.
The credit union is planning
special deals to attract students
to their new branch. "We're talk
ing about offering very inexpen
sive — if not free — accounts for
students," he said.
Noting that the credit union
has offered discounted banking
programs in the past, Tuohey
said that in this case, "we're mak
ing an offer that will be almost
impossible for students to
refuse."
The Stanford Management
Company, the organization which

administers the Tresidder space,
is actively looking for other new
tenants for the building, said Act
ing Dean of Students Jim Lari
more. The first efforts in that
regard are being focused on the
downstairs areas of the building,
he said.
The copy center was recently
taken over by Pulse, a company
which has similar operations on
many college campuses, Larimore

said.
According to
Director of Stu
dent Activities
Nanci Howe,
Pulse is planning
to reconfigure its
space to make its
set-up more like
that of a retail
operation.
When the

Gates Information Sciences
building is completed next win
ter, the Computer Science
Department offices in the Tresid
der Academic Center will move
out. However, LaIR will remain
in Tresidder, Larimore said.
Because the space which hous
es the computer science offices is
owned by the Office of Student
Activities, that office is consider
ing relocating some of its divi
sions to that space once it is
vacated, Larimore said.
These changes, however, do
not include any new develop
ments on the ever-present Taco
Bell issue. According to Howe,
who pointed out that she is a few
layers removed from the discus
sion, there is little chance that a
Taco Bell will arrive in Tresidder
in time for fall quarter.
Nonetheless, the issue is still
being examined and the Universi
ty is now looking at questions
involving the installation of prop
er ventilation, she said.
