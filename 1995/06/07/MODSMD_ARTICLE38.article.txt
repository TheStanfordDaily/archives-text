# Mooning for research
## Students plan 'Noon' as psychology class project 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
Few people who bared their
buns at Friday's "Moon at Noon"
knew they were helping a group
of psychology students complete a
class project.
The highly publicized event,
which was covered by several
local news and radio organiza
tions, was organized by a group of
students as part of a class project
in Prof. Philip Zimbardo's course,
Psychology 199: "The Psychology
of Mind Control."
Zimbardo said he did not real
ize the event originated as an idea
within his course until the stu
dents' projects were presented in
class yesterday.
"I didn't know about it until
now," said Zimbardo, who said
that the project's purpose "was to
use social influence techniques to
encourage people to do something
they ordinarily would not."
Approximately 16 students
within a section studying the
mind control techniques of cults

developed the mooning idea.
"We looked in-depth at cults,
their techniques and how they con
trol and manipulate environments
and situations to influence people,"
said head teaching assistant Rose
McDermott, who approved the pro
jects, which are graded.
One of the student organizers,
junior Mikel Jollett, said the
"Moon at Noon" idea had less to
do with exploring the intensive
techniques employed by religious
cults than with using general the
ories of influence commonly
employed by advertisers and
salespeople.
"We wanted to do something
where we could have fun," Jollett
said. "And somebody took out the
Guinness Book of World Records
and said, 'Hey, there's no record
for mooning.' "
The students immediately sup
ported the idea, considering it a
gesture of protest against what
some consider an increasingly
conservative stance by the Uni
versity, officials of which recently
attempted to ban the antics of the

senior procession.
"What we basically did was
post fliers," said Jollett, describ
ing his efforts to organize the
event. Press releases were also
sent to local news and radio orga
nizations.
Jollett said that organizers
were pleased with the turnout —
which numbered approximately
220 drawer-droppers and approx
imately 700 curious onlookers —
and said that techniques learned
from readings in the class helped
recruit prospective mooners.
"In a way it was a marketing
exercise," said Jollett, who said
that organizers used the concept
of scarcity to attract participants.
"We'd say, 'One more minute!
One more minute!' and then a
couple minutes would go by and
we'd say, 'One more minute!'
Cults use the same tactics but we
used them in a mundane way."
Organizers plan to submit the
necessary petitions and video cov
erage of the event to qualify for
the Guinness Book of World
Records.
