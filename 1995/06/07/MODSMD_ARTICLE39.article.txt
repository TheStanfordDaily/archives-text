# ASSU seeks letters in fight to save federal student aid
## 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
If the ASSU Senate and
Council of Presidents garner
2,000 signatures by tonight,
they think they may be able to
save $9.4 billion worth of finan
cial aid.
That is the goal of a letter
writing campaign being con
ducted under the auspices of the
office of U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo,
the Democratic representative
from Stanford's district. The
campaign has been taking place
since yesterday in White Plaza,
dorms and "late night" food ser
vice, according to ASSU senator
Bill Shen.
According to Shen and COP
member Rich Stolz, the U.S.
congressional Conference Com
mittee on the Budget, composed
of members of both the House
and Senate, is expected to agree
on a final budget proposal by
the end of this week or early

next week.
If the proposal passes both
the House and the Senate, it will
be passed on to the president for
final approval. The House has
proposed allocating no money
for student financial aid, while
the Senate wants to allocate
$9.4 billion. Last year, state
spending on student aid totaled
$2.2 billion in need-based assis
tance.
The goal of the ASSU cam
paign is to garner 2,000 signa
tures on a form letter and send
copies of the letters to each
member of the congressional
committee. Hopefully, the let
ters will provide enough support
for the Senate proposal to head
off any cuts, Stolz said.
The campaign letter states
that "more than half of (Stan
ford's] student population is on
some form of financial aid." A
supplementary flier claims that
the proposed cuts would add an
average of $2,249 to student

debt at Stanford.
This past April, the COP and
ASSU sponsored a rally in
White Plaza where Eshoo
encouraged the ASSU to take a
more strongly activist role on
financial aid cuts, including
educating students about the
cuts, Shen said. Shortly after
the ASSU spring elections, the
senate held a meeting during
which a resolution to fight cuts
was passed. An amendment to
the bill allocated $1,000 to pro
vide for the practical means of
implementing the resolution,
Shen said.
University President Ger
hard Casper has expressed sup
port for the effort, and the
ASSU contacted Eshoo's office
for advice on basic logistical
aspects of the campaign, such as
where to send the letters.
"Eshoo has offered to be a
conduit" in the campaign, Shen
said, adding that the ASSU "has
pledged to defend student aid."
