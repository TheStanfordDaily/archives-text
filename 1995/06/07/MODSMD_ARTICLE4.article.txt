# Sluggers stall in World Series, lose to Tennessee
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — After two days of hit
ting .365 and racking up 32 hits, 13 runs
and four home runs, the Stanford baseball
offensive juggernaut finally ran out of gas
yesterday.
The only strength the team will need
now is the energy to make the long trek

home and come to terms with the end of its
1995 season.
Facing elimination from postseason play
for the fifth time in nine days, the Cardinal
machine stalled and came to a grinding halt
in a 6-2 loss to Tennessee in the third round
of the College World Series.
Stanford (40-25), the eighth seed in the
tournament, was eliminated from the
World Series after beating Clemson and los

ing to Cal State-Fullerton and the Volun
teers. Fifth-seeded Tennessee (54-14) ad
vanced to the final four and will face Fuller
ton tomorrow.
"It's been a roller-coaster ride all sea
son," said junior Ail-American catcher A.J.
Hinch. "We started at the top and hit some
potholes in the road. But toward the end of
the season we came on strong and played
like the team we are.

"We feel like we did what we wanted to do
this year. It's just tough right now to posi
tively think about our season after such a
tough loss."
Stanford went in order in the first, sec
ond and third innings, a fabulous start for
what would turn into the fourth complete
game for Ryan Meyers (10-2, 3.58 ERA).
The Volunteers took advantage of the
chance to grab the early lead.
Scott Schroffel lofted a single into
right field to start the first inning
and stole second base, allowing
Ail-American Todd Helton's single
over second base to drive in the
first run of the game. But junior
right-hander Todd Bartels (4-5,
5.26 ERA), who grew up only
miles from Rosenblatt Stadium,
retired the next two batters and
limited the Tennessee lead to 1-0
after one inning.
The second inning turned nasty
again for the Cardinal. A leadoff
single and a throwing error by
senior third baseman Steve Carv
er left Volunteers at second and
third with only one out. But Bar
tels squirmed out of a jam for the
second frame in a row, retiring the
next two Tennessee batters and
keeping the score 1-0 after two.
The Volunteers entered the
games against the Cardinal with
only a .242 average in the World
Series after hitting .312 as a team
in the regular season. Four Stan
ford players had averages higher
than the best Volunteer, and the
Cardinal was batting .365 as a
team in the Series.
It appeared that the tide had
turned in this elimination contest.
Tennessee racked up three hits in
the first two innings, including
two singles by the Volunteers who
were l-for-16 in first and second
frames of the CWS to that point.
Stanford was held hitless through
four innings and with the excep

tion of two walks could not get a
Cardinal athlete on the bags.
With the help of two pickoffs of
Stanford baserunners, Tennessee
faced only three Stanford batters
in each of the first four frames.
"He stayed consistent all night
long," Carver said of Meyers. "He
was mixing it up and kept us off
balance."
Some sign of life appeared in
the Cardinal offense in the fifth
inning. Carver singled to left field
but was thrown out trying to take
third on a Dusty Allen fly ball.
Until then all three of Stanford's
baserunners had been picked off
at second.
The offensive machine that had
produced 13 runs in the two previ
ous games finally churned out a
few runs. Junior second baseman
Brian Dallimore, batting .500 in
the series, singled and stole second
before freshman designated hitter
Jon Schaeffer punched a ground
ball past the first baseman to knot
the score.
The tie was broken when the
next Cardinal batter stepped to
the plate. Junior first baseman
Troy Kent launched a fly ball to
deep center field that bounced off
the glove of Schroffel and scored
Schaeffer from first base. The
Cardinal had made up for three
innings of inaction and led 2-1.
But the Stanford defense could
not hold the advantage, and the
Cardinal lost it for good in the bot
tom of the fifth. After committing
its second error of the game, Bar
tels gave up back-to-back two-out
home runs to Schroffel and Hel
ton. Schroffel's two-run blast and

Helton's ensuing dinger gave the
Vols a 4-2 lead after five innings.
"They got the big swings when
they needed them," Bartels said.
"They got the ball up in the wind
and rode it from there."
Stanford finished the game
with only six hits and several of
the Cardinal's key producers came
up empty in the final game. Hinch
and junior left fielder Cab Carter
went a combined 2-for-8 and the
middle three hitters 2-for-10.
"I just need to hold them to two
or three runs and my guys will put
the runs on the board for us,"
Meyers said. "They've been doing
that all year long."
The lead was extended to 5-2 on
a solo homer down the right-field
line by Travis Copley, who entered
the game 0-for-7 in the CWS. Bar
tels was replaced by junior right
hander Mario Iglesias on the
mound following the home run.
"I'm real disappointed," Bar
tels said. "I wish I could have come
through for [my home crowd]."
Another one-run long ball, Ten
nessee's fourth of the game, gave
the Vols a 6-2 lead in the seventh
inning that would turn into the
final score. For the first time in
four games, Stanford did not hit a
home run, and in one game the
Cardinal had given up more home
runs than it had allowed in all six
regional contests combined.
"It's been a good run for us,
and I'm proud of the team and the
way they played," Stanford coach
Mark Marquess said. "We just ran
up against a better team tonight,
and they beat us in all phases of
the game."
