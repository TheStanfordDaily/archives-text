# Concrete impacts to cuts
## New procurement system represents one effort to streamline University economics, save funds 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
As the University continues its daunting task of
trimming costs from a budget that may seem to have
already been pared down to the bare bones, it must
face some tough personnel decisions and search for
increasingly creative ways to cut costs.
One area that Stanford has targeted for increased
efficiency is administrative processes and specifically
the ways that University employees buy and pay for
goods and supplies.
The University this year completed the second
phase of a three-year budget-cutting initiative aimed
at cutting $18 million from the annual University
budget. This year's round of cuts trimmed $4.6 mil
lion, somewhat short of the $6 million target. Last
year's reductions totaled $6.1 million.
The move to streamline administrative informa
tion systems, according to Chief Information Officer
Glenn Mueller, began two years ago, when two
retreats were held during which University adminis
trators and representatives from schools and depart
ments brainstormed ideas on "what Stanford could
be doing better."
The system of buying and paying for goods and
supplies was one of three or four initial projects iden
tified by those efforts, Mueller said.
After some further study, Mueller said, the Uni

versity started the Administrative Information Sys
tems (AIS) plan to perform "a significant overhaul of
administrative systems." One arm of that effort, the
Buy Pay team, was charged specifically with stream
lining the procurement process.
Mueller said he is pleased with the Buy Pay team's
progress.
"It's moving along at a pretty good pace," he said.
Mueller added that a steering committee com
posed of senior deans and administrators meets
weekly to coordinate the efforts of the Buy Pay team
and related AIS initiatives.
Because the Buy Pay system will allow the Univer
sity to buy some supplies directly from vendors, the
new system will eliminate the need for some func
tions of University Central Stores, one of Stanford's
current vehicles for purchasing and paying for sup
plies.
Consequently, "There will be a significant down
sizing and restructuring of the entire Stores organi
zation," according to Director of Procurement Susan
Webert.
Most of the reorganization will be in the form of
personnel cuts, Webert said.
"You have two choices," Webert said. "You either
significantly increase the pricing or reduce the
expenses. ... Most of Stores' expenses is in labor."
Webert said the Central Stores
staff currently numbers about 34.
She did not offer estimates of how
large the staff reductions would be
or how much money they would
save the University.
However, Webert said, Central
Stores will remain, fulfilling a
reduced and modified role.
"Clearly there is not currently a
plan to close down Stores," she
said.
The new Buy Pay system will
employ new technology and new
ways of thinking to reduce the
amount of time and effort needed
to buy and pay for goods and ser
vices, according to Buy Pay team
leader Nancy Ware.
Under the new system, an esti
mated 80 percent of transactions
will be handled by a new Buy Pay

Information System, a computer
ized ordering system that will
allow employees to acquire goods
from their desks through a graph
ically based ordering system.
"Basically, what we're trying to
do is shorten the number of
approvals that are necessary for
any basic kind of purchasing
transaction that's occurring,'
Ware said. "We want to make it
easier for people to find what it is
that they need and to complete
that order-invoice-paymc.it cycle."
Using computerized informa
tion systems and processes such as
electronic transfer of funds will
also reduce the amount of paper
work needed in University pur
chases.
Campus-wide agreements
arranged with vendors will allow
the University to negotiate lower
prices for supplies, Ware said.
"That's ... where we're pro
jecting about half of the savings
will come from," Ware said.

University employees will also
be able to spend less time choosing
what goods will be needed and
actually submitting the requests,
Ware said.
A report issued by the Buy Pay
team in January estimates that
the new system will save the Uni
versity a total of $4.1 million by
the 1997-98 fiscal year. Imple
menting the program will cost a
total of $4.8 million through 1996.
Beginning in 1997, the report
states, the program will begin to
accrue savings to the University.
Current plans also provide for
combining the Procurement,
Accounts Payable and Travel and
Reimbursement departments into
a new organization called Stanford
Acquisition Support (SAS).
The reorganization will reduce
the overall size of the staff. While
the combined staff of the three
departments currently numbers
about 50, Ware said, the new SAS
staff will number about 40.
