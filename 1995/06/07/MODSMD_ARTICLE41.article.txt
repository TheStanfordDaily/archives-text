# Concrete impacts to cuts
## New procurement system represents one effort to streamline University economics, save funds 
### Jim Luh Senior staff writer 
As the University continues its daunting task of
trimming costs from a budget that may seem to have
already been pared down to the bare bones, it must
face some tough personnel decisions and search for
increasingly creative ways to cut costs.
One area that Stanford has targeted for increased
efficiency is administrative processes and specifically
the ways that University employees buy and pay for
goods and supplies.
The University this year completed the second
phase of a three-year budget-cutting initiative aimed
at cutting $18 million from the annual University
budget. This year's round of cuts trimmed $4.6 mil
lion, somewhat short of the $6 million target. Last
year's reductions totaled $6.1 million.
The move to streamline administrative informa
tion systems, according to Chief Information Officer
Glenn Mueller, began two years ago, when two
retreats were held during which University adminis
trators and representatives from schools and depart
ments brainstormed ideas on "what Stanford could
be doing better."
The system of buying and paying for goods and
supplies was one of three or four initial projects iden
tified by those efforts, Mueller said.
After some further study, Mueller said, the Uni

versity started the Administrative Information Sys
tems (AIS) plan to perform "a significant overhaul of
administrative systems." One arm of that effort, the
Buy Pay team, was charged specifically with stream
lining the procurement process.
Mueller said he is pleased with the Buy Pay team's
progress.
"It's moving along at a pretty good pace," he said.
Mueller added that a steering committee com
posed of senior deans and administrators meets
weekly to coordinate the efforts of the Buy Pay team
and related AIS initiatives.
Because the Buy Pay system will allow the Univer
sity to buy some supplies directly from vendors, the
new system will eliminate the need for some func
tions of University Central Stores, one of Stanford's
current vehicles for purchasing and paying for sup
plies.
Consequently, "There will be a significant down
sizing and restructuring of the entire Stores organi
zation," according to Director of Procurement Susan
Webert.
Most of the reorganization will be in the form of
personnel cuts, Webert said.
"You have two choices," Webert said. "You either
significantly increase the pricing or reduce the
expenses. ... Most of Stores' expenses is in labor."
