# Committee aims to achieve in environmental fields

Members of a new University committee
hope their work will bring Stanford to inter
national prominence as a leader in environ
mental policy and research.
The Committee on Environmental Stud
ies, Technology and Policy at Stanford — for
mally announced by Provost Condoleezza
Rice at the beginning of spring quarter — will
help bring together several smaller groups
already in existence to discuss common goals
on environmental issues, said Geophysics and
Biology Prof. Jonathan Roughgarden, a com
mittee member.
"There's a lot of strength in environmental
teaching on campus," he said. "When we
work together, we can really project an
impact nationally and internationally that
would be impossible if we were trying to func
tion as little splinter groups."
The committee will act as a "surface on
which planning can crystallize, a collecting
point for people interested in environmen
tal policy and research," said Committee

Chair and former University President
Donald Kennedy, a professor at Stanford's
Institute for International Studies, where
an environmental forum was first informal-

ly started.
"We're trying to identify
areas in which we can
strengthen our organization
in teaching environmental
policy," Kennedy said.
Improvements might
come by adding courses and
faculty members, extending
research and expanding
environmental forums, he
said.

The committee plans to develop literature
describing environmental opportunities for
teaching and research at Stanford.
"We don't have a single unified program of
research or teaching on the environment,"
Kennedy said.
The committee's work and official status
will "make it easy for people to come here and
do research or get help to organize a coherent
program to learn about environmental poli

cy," he said.
Harvard and other prominent universi
ties have similar committees, Roughgarden
said.
Other areas the committee may examine
include developing a strategy for faculty
development in environmental areas, facili
tating interdisciplinary proposals for research
and teaching on the environment and provid
ing feedback from students and faculty for
existing programs, he said.
The area with the most immediate need for
additional faculty is oceanography, Rough
garden said. More support for the oceanogra
phy program would "help the University as a
whole a great deal," he said.
There are also many opportunities for col
laboration among the Schools of Earth Sci
ence, Engineering, Law and Medicine for pro
grams such as environmental law and
medicine, he added.
In a memo to members, Rice also asked the
committee to respond to inquiries about Stan
ford's environmental studies programs by
potential students and others outside the
University.
