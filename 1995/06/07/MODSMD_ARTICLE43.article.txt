# No more extra innings
## Daily drowns Fellows with 5th-inning burst 
### Sarah Katz Right fielder 
Continuing a new-found tradition of athletic prowess, Daily
staffers beat the John S. Knight Fellows at Softball for the second
year in a row in a come-from-behind, 8-7 victory Saturday.
The annual match started slowly for The Daily, with pitcher
and editor in chief Andy "Jolly Green Giant" Dworkin giving up
five runs in the first three innings.
"I may not be a great pitcher, but I know what love is," said
Dworkin, who played so enthusiastically that at one point he
tripped over his own two feet in an effort to grab a loose ball. "You
better not call me an Indiana hick again, pardner."
Working with only 10 players after the departure of Romesh
"Ultimate Sports Fan" Ratnesar, The Daily trailed 5-2 for several
innings. But after breaking into the beer, the team turned it
around for a fifth-inning rally.
After Dworkin — the top of the alphabetical lineup — was
thrown out, Linda "Kiss Me" Friedlieb and Matt "Nctboy" Grego
ry stepped up to face the Knight Fellows' pitcher, both singling to
first. Following another out by Frank "Mambo King" Guinan, the
team went through the rest of its lineup and then some in quick
succession. Five runs later, The
Daily had taken the lead.
After that, the game was as
good as over, despite attempts by
the Knight Fellows to cheat their
way back to victory through extra
innings. Though the fellows scored
two runs in the eighth, The Daily
held on to its lead for the win.
The game was characterized by
several examples of stellar Daily
play. Frank "I'm Not Really A
Ringer" Kolor and Burt "Michael
Mancini" Herman coordinated
closely for three straight outs at sec
ond. Though she didn't do much
work, tough looks from Colleen "For
The Last Time, Best Hair" Krueger
helped sharpen up the outfield.
Allyson "Smooth Talker"

Mizoguchi distinguished herself at
third while catcher Sarah "Linus"
Nagae came through the game
without injury. Finally, a surprise
late entrance by batting-glove
wearer Dev "Science Guy" Nag
improved the team effort.
Speaking after the game, a
dejected Knight Fellows Deputy
Director Jim "Iron Horse" Bet
tinger said, "I hope the young kids
will ache in the morning, cause my
sore bones are killing me!"
Despite their extensive journal
ism training, however, Bettinger
and Knight Fellows Director Jim
"Palmer" Risser failed to notice
that Dworkin had bribed fellows to
throw the game in exchange for T
shirts.
"Look, all I can say is that it's a
good thing their kids weren't as
big this year," Dworkin said, sizing
up the competition. "We'd have
been goners."
