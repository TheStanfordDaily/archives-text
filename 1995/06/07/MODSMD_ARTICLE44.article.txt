# Architects withdraw from Green project

After an abrupt declaration of
bankruptcy, the architectural
group hired to repair Green
Library West has withdrawn
from the six-year-old project —
forcing University officials to
search for another firm to com

not cost the University much
more money or time. Green
Library West, which was serious

selected and under contract, is
able to meet a very rigorous
schedule, the project may be com

Facilities Project Management.

bankruptcy, the Architects Col
laborative had begun a process of
demolition and abatement, with
demolition planned through
summer and fall. All design
drawings were also submitted.
"These essentially completed
the design phase of the project,"
said Jones. "While it is never
preferable to have an architect
default on a project, having it
occur at the end of a phase is
preferable since all the work to
date is neatly packaged — giving
the new architect a good basis to
start their work."

consulting structural engineer
and chair of the disaster pre

a firm of such size and history is
