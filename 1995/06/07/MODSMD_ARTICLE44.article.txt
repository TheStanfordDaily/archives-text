# Architects withdraw from Green project
## 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
After an abrupt declaration of
bankruptcy, the architectural
group hired to repair Green
Library West has withdrawn
from the six-year-old project —
forcing University officials to
search for another firm to com
plete the project.
Officials hope that the search
for a new design firm to replace
the Architects Collaborative will
not cost the University much
more money or time. Green
Library West, which was serious
ly damaged by the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake, is scheduled
to reopen in 1998.
"If the new architect, once
selected and under contract, is
able to meet a very rigorous
schedule, the project may be com
pleted as originally planned,"
said Mark Jones, director of
Facilities Project Management.

Prior to the declaration of
bankruptcy, the Architects Col
laborative had begun a process of
demolition and abatement, with
demolition planned through
summer and fall. All design
drawings were also submitted.
"These essentially completed
the design phase of the project,"
said Jones. "While it is never
preferable to have an architect
default on a project, having it
occur at the end of a phase is
preferable since all the work to
date is neatly packaged — giving
the new architect a good basis to
start their work."
Douglas Hohbach, who is a
consulting structural engineer
and chair of the disaster pre
paredness committee for the
Santa Clara Valley Chapter of
the American Institute of Archi
tects, said that the withdrawal by
a firm of such size and history is
unusual, but does occur. Never
theless, Hohbach, who worked
with Green Library earlier, sees no
problem with another firm picking
up where the previous firm left off.
"It's relatively a little blip,"
Hohbach said. "You can make a big

deal of it and drag the search out.
If management works quickly the
delay could be about three
months."
After being notified of the
bankruptcy in April, Stanford
Facilities Project Management
secured all drawings and work
products, according to Jones. He
said it is unknown how much the
sudden backout by the Architects
Collaborative and search for a

replacement will cost the Universi
ty. After selection, fees will be
negotiated between the University
and the invited firm.
"I think the University is trying
to do it right, and it's obviously not
easy," said Hohbach. "It does seem
like it's been a little too long, but
it's a comprehensive type of
upgrade, and you don't wait
around six years and then do a
half-baked job."
