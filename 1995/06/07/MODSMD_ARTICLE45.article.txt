Daniel Bershader, professor emeritus of
aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford and
former chair of the Faculty Senate, died in
his home May 30 of complications arising
from chronic peptic ulcer disease. He was 72.
An experimentalist in the field of aero
physics, Bershader's work has been widely
recognized and published. His major contri
bution was helping to explain the physics of
high-speed (light.
Bershader was the director of the Aero-
Astro Shock Tube Laboratory at Stanford,
where he conducted research directed at envi
ronmental concerns, said Michael Tauber,
Bershader's colleague and former student.
Bershader investigated the phenomenon of
noise created by helicopter blades and how it
contributes to noise pollution.

"The boundary between physics and
aerospace engineering is where he liked to
work," said Molt Ashley, professor emeritus
of aeronautics and astronautics. "He liked to
say he was a physicist in engineer's clothing."
A native of New York City, Bershader
received his bachelor's degree from Brooklyn
College in 1942.
After serving in World War 11, Bershader
earned his master's and doctoral degrees
from Princeton University. He became a full
time Stanford faculty member in 1964.
As a professor at Stanford, Bershader was
"the way a faculty member ought to be," Ash
ley said, noting that, whenever he visited Ber
shader in his office he was talking with stu
dents.
Indeed, Bershader was an asset to the
Department of Aeronautics and Astronau
tics, according to George Springer, the
department chair. In addition to serving as

associate chair of the department for close to
25 years, Bershader was also "the only (ten
nis | player I've ever played who could switch
from left to right and still hit a great fore,"
Springer said.
Bershader brought the best of his field
right to the Stanford campus. He was direc
tor of the Summer Faculty Fellowship Pro
gram sponsored by Stanford, NASA and the
American Society for Engineering Education.
A talented pianist, Bershader had a love of
classical music that influenced all aspects of
his life. He did everything from playing piano
for friends after dinner at his home to being
the senior volunteer usher at the San Fran
cisco Opera to teaching an interdisciplinary
course on noise pollution at Stanford.
"He didn't know how to sit around and
relax," Brian Bershader said of his father.
"He had a lot of talent and was fondly
thought of in many circles."
