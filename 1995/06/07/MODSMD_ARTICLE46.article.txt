# LGBCC considers name change
## Aims to include transvestite, transgender communities 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Members of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center are currently considering a
possible name change aimed at including groups
that do not fall under its current title.
.Junior David Barba — chair of this year's
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Awareness Days
(BGLAD) — said he came up with the idea of
changing the LGBCC's name to the "Queer Com
munity Center" after hearing the thoughts of a
transgender performance artist who was featured
in a BGLAD event last month.
"Our main concern is that the organization's
name doesn't include the transgender communi
ty," Barba said.
The intention of the change would be to
encompass transgender and transvestite individ
uals as well as others who question their sexuali
ty but who do not define themselves as gay, les
bian or bisexual, Barba said. LGBCC members
who received Barba's proposal through e-mail
have expressed mixed opinions about the change.
Those in favor of a name change applaud
"queer" as a word that is broader than specific
categories of sexual orientation, according to Troy

Gilbert, University adviser to the LGBCC. Labels
can be "very defining, if not confining," he said.
Others disapprove of the word "queer" as a
term with politically radical overtones that can
disorient individuals who are less outspoken
about their sexual orientation, Barba said.
Because the semantics of the center's name
would not necessarily effect real changes in the
organization, certain students are concerned that
the change would only be symbolic and ineffective
in including more individuals, Gilbert said.
Adding another category to the LGBCC's
"already jumbled" title has been considered, said
Barba. A similar debate took place at Brown Uni
versity last spring, Barba said, which resulted in
that center's name being changed to the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Association.
Preferring the name "Queer Community Cen
ter" for its simplicity, Barba said his hope is to
"reappropriate the word" in a way that would
take away its negative stigma.
Discussion of the name change has as of yet
been limited to e-mail, but plans for a meeting
addressing the details and implications of the
issue are in progress, according to Gilbert.
"The community needs to meet and gauge its
comfort level with the issue," Gilbert said.
