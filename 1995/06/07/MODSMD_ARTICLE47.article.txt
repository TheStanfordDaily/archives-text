### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
The Undergraduate Advising
Committee is close to presenting
its preliminary report on imple
menting the recommendations of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education designed to improve
the quality of academic advising at
Stanford.
Students have long expressed
displeasure with the current advis
ing system. According to a recent
poll conducted by The Daily,
respondents gave mediocre grades
to the quality of advising, ranking
it near the bottom of a list of Uni
versity services.
The commission had made
eight general recommendations for
the committee to pursue. These
included improving relations
between students and their advis
ers, allocating additional resources
to the Undergraduate Advising
Center, strengthening the peer

advising program, encouraging
more faculty participation in the
advising system and increasing the
emphasis on sophomore year
advising.
"We have been meeting weekly
with a variety of groups, organiza
tions and individuals," said Assoc.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Ramon Saldi'var, the committee's
chair. "We are presently assessing
what we've learned and are begin
ning to write a preliminary draft of
our report."
Saldi'var said the committee
solicited input from head academic
advisers, members of the commis
sion, the Undergraduate Advising
Center and the provost.
Some committee members had
thought that a few of the commis
sion's recommendations could be
implemented by fall quarter, but
realized the difficulty of the task.
"I think we are making excel
lent progress â€” it's a wonderful
group," said History Prof. Norman

Naimark. "But I was naive to think
that we would have some of the
ideas implemented by next fall.
Advising at Stanford is an
extremely complex affair, much
more so than I had anticipated."
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Mar
garet Brandeau, another commit
tee member, was still optimistic,
saying that while there was more
work to be done, she hoped some
of the group's initial recommenda
tions could be in place by next
year.
"We are considering the differ
ent aspects of advising and who
best performs which functions.
These include the nature of the
relationship between the adviser
and advisees, the expectations
each side brings and the kind and
timing of information provided to
new students," said Saldi'var.
The committee is also trying to
fmd ways to better utilize the resi
dences for dorm-based advising, he
said.
