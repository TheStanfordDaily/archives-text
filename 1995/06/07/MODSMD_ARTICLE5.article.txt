# Students in alleged break-in won't face felonies

### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
The four Stanford students and one
alumnus arrested for illegally entering the
Stanford Art Museum will not face felony
burglary charges for their alleged March 25
actions.
After their preliminary hearing last Fri
day at the Palo Alto Municipal Courthouse,
Judge Gilbert Brown "found insufficient ev
idence to support" a felony burglary trial,
according to Edward Mahler, defense attor
ney for senior Jacob Kuramoto.
Kuramoto, senior Matthew Bengard,
sophomores Timothy Kutzkey and Alejan
dro Quezada, and 1994 graduate Jose
Farias were all arrested during spring
break. All are affiliated with the Beta Theta

Pi fraternity.
The Santa Clara County District Attor
ney's Office now has several steps it can
take against the five men. According to
Deputy District Attorney Lance Bayer, his
office could refile the charges, file misde
meanor charges or simply not file any new
charges. As of yesterday, a decision had not
been made, he said.
"I think the judge really saw the evidence
for what it was," Mahler said. "The evidence
is overwhelming that they illegally entered
the building â€” but the evidence does not es
tablish that these men wanted to steal any
thing."
The five defense attorneys working on
the case spent several hours on Friday ques
tioning Frank Kommer, a designer and fab
ricator at the museum who is responsible

for the security system there.
Through their questions, the attorneys
tried to establish that the average Stanford
student would not know that art was still
being held at the museum. There has not
been a public exhibition at the museum
since Oct. 17, 1989, when the Loma Prieta
Earthquake caused serious structural dam
age to the building. According to Kommer,
more than $50 million worth of art is kept at
the museum.
The defense also attempted to show that
the five men did not take anything of value,
even though the opportunity was available
to them. Locked art storage areas had no
signs of attempted entry, Kommer said, and
no items of value were missing from the mu
seum.
In statements made to the police after

their arrests, both Kutzkey and Quezada
said that their reason for entering the mu
seum was to climb onto its roof. On direct
examination of Kommer, Bayer used some
of his questions to point out that a parking
structure near the museum is actually taller
and open 24 hours a day.
Mark Becker, defense attorney for Ben
gard, attempted to counter this line of ques
tioning. Becker used his cross-examination
to ask if there was anything "fun or illicit or
illegal" about climbing to the top of a park
ing structure, adding that it would be "dif
ferent, individual" and "uncommon" to get
a view from the top of the museum.
The police officers involved with the inci
dent were called to the stand in the after-
