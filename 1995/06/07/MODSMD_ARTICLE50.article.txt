# Tabulating the trek: a college countdown
## 
### 
All of this is over, more or less. Sure I'll be
around next year for a final spin sans half
the faces that made this place worth wak
ing up in, but at least in theory, my time here is
up. I'm a senior. Pass the Geritol.
Four years. Thirty-seven months. Well over
1,000 days.
Dozens of trips to the bookstore. Hundreds of
trips to the Coffee house. A few Walk of Shames.
OfT the top of my head, I could tell you little of
what has transpired in all that time — it's a
mish-mosh of names and pages and crushes and
snot. Hut it's the end now, the gratuitous time to
reflect, and so I consult my memories and my
journals and begin to count.. .
Seventeen tubes of toothpaste. Eleven flights
home. Two bikes stolen.
Sue hundred and something Dailys. One hun
dred and ninety-six units. Seven roommates.
There's a touch of survivors' guilt in my stay
ing another season. Those I entered with are giv
ing away their posters ... second-hand futons,
battle stained and battered, sold everywhere ...
hundreds of faces and names I'll probably forget
to miss when I'm old and crusty and my short
term memory turns to tofu.
But for now, and I expect for some time, they
characterize my time.
Seventeen thousand pages assigned. More
than 800 pages written. Seven extensions.
Thirty-two dates I had to dress up for. Four
flings not worth telling my parents about. About
a semester a broad.
I played with people who are taller than I am.
People who can do things with brilliance that I'll
never do even poorly. They am rollerblade and
sing and use proper grammar. They can wake up
before 11 and smile meaningfully while doing so.
They am pass up a trip to Disneyland for a
paper. They speak of fonts as though they had
personalities.

"Smart people," my roommate often says,
"are usually dumb as toast." But then again, he
still forgets to put on his pants some days.
Must be a genius.
One long distance relationship. Five break
ups. Severity-four explanations of what kosher
means.
Four internships. Eleven trips to Juice Club.
Two hundred and eighty-two thousand, six hun
dred and fifty-four points on Mac Tetris. (One
hell of a weekend that was.)
I battled regret and won and lost. In a fit of
hypocrisy, I've disemboweled at least one fine
relationship in order to placate my schedule.
I overachieved, I underachieved. I photo
copied notes and did well and did poorly. I've
been praised for my work and I've been told to
see a writing tutor. I fought crime and I man
aged to maintain a whole slew of delusions. I still
have no idea what investment bankers or mar
keting consultants do.
I read, I wrote, 1 studied. I took more units
than I dropped. I passed everything except
Advanced Fencing (I didn't pay the fee) and
CSOOIC (I didn't do the last assignment) and I
still have never calculated my GPA.
I stayed up late and farted around. I bonded.
I fought wit h my roommate over the garbage. I
saw the arts fall to pieces and I saw students
take what's dished. I saw oatburgers become
Garden burgers® and I saw the administration
become the bad guys. I've been told I use the
word "nookie" more oflen thfin the average Poo
bear.
Four allergy seasons. One hundred and six
Seldane. More tissues than I can count.
Thirty-two improv shows. Twenty-five
columns. Three volumes of Diversions shared.
Six calls of complaint. One private detective.
Two hundred and fifty butts.
There it is, four years' experience. Quanti

fied, solidified, tabulated. There's more, of
course, hut I've never been one for counting con
doms.
It is tempting here to become nostalgic, but
when I explain my next year's plans to my class
mates who are brave enough to give Casper that
final pat on the ass and sell t heir Cliffs Notes, I
realize I have no right to that. I tell them about
my fifth year and my honors thesis and I see a
strange look cross their face — sort of like "Can
I have a bite?" mixed with, "Do you really want
that grenade taped to your rectum like that?"
Amid their own graduation angst, they see
my scramble to add to this quantified list of
Stanfordstuff and they wonder if hiding out isn't
such a bad idea. For they know that when we
trade in our caps and gowns for a consulting job
in the city, when we give over safety for oppor
tunity, swap hedonism for pragmatism, when
we sober up and wipe the graduation party
vomit from our chins, our time will be spent
counting numbers of an entirely different kind.
Of all the things I've tried to worry about
here in this crumpled corner of The Daily, this
one is the hardest. Because I almost mean it,
which is hard for a columnist. Here goes:
We're counting now. We're doing and we're
adding. It's real.
And the time here, as everywhere, is finite. If
you have any left, use it. If you don't, regret will
never do you as much good as keeping aware of
the changes.
And if you're stuck dwelling on what's gone,
you'll be one whiny son of a bitch.
Sleep well.
