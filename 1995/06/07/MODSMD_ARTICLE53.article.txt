Editor's note: Because of The Daily's production
schedule, coverage of yesterday's game us. Tennessee
appears on the front page of section A. The following
story covers the results of Stanford's first two games
at the College World Series.
OMAHA, Neb. â€” The Stanford baseball squad
picked a fine time to become a powerhouse at the
plate.
The Cardinal (40-24), known more for its finesse
and less for its long ball potential during the regular
season, knocked two balls out of Rosenblatt Stadium
and sent two more within inches of the outfield
bleachers en route to its 8-3 World Series victory
over the fourth-seeded Clemson Tigers (54-14) on
Monday. The loss eliminated the Atlantic Coast Con
ference champions and kept eighth-seeded Stanford
with a perceivable pulse.
After redording only 30 home runs in its entire
56-game regular season, the Cardinal has now sent
12 dingers out of the park in its eight postseason ball
games.
On Monday, Stanford went for the jugular early
in the first frame. The Cardinal took a 3-0 lead on
senior right fielder Dusty Allen's two-run homer to
deep center field and senior third baseman Steve
Carver's RBI single to right field. For the second
game in a row, Stanford had a 3-0 lead on its oppo
nent after one inning.
"We struggled all season at the plate," Allen said.
"But right now things are starting to come together,
which is exactly what you want to have happen in
the postseason."
In a World Series in which over half of the total
runs have been scored in the first two innings of
play, Stanford struck again in the bottom of the sec
ond frame. Junior first baseman Trov Kent and

sophomore shortstop Eric Sees both singled before
freshman center fielder Joe Kilburg was hit by a
Billy Koch pitch to load the bags with no outs.
Koch (7-1, 3.35 ERA) was quickly replaced by Jeff
Sauve (5-0, 3.98 ERA), and Clemson avoided what
might have been a back-breaking inning by turning
a double play and striking out junior All-American
catcher A.J. Hinch. The Cardinal managed only one
run and led 4-0 after two innings.
But even Sauve could not keep the long ball pitch
away from the Stanford bats. Carver stepped to the
plate in the bottom of the third and blasted one 410
feet, beyond the right-field bleachers. The dinger
was Carver's second of the series and the Cardinal's
sixth in 12 innings of play in Omaha. For the second
inning in a row the Tigers turned a double play to
thwart a potential Stanford scoring binge, and the
Cardinal led 5-0 after three frames.
"We got started off on the wrong foot," said Clem
son coach Jack Leggett. "We got down early, and the
enxt thing we knew we were fighting and scrambling
to get back into the game. It wasn't conducive to how
we have been playing all season."
Clemson cut the lead to 5-1 in the fourth inning
when Kilburg dropped a (ly ball in center field. The
baserunner scored from second on the play, which
was not scored an error.
Freshman ace Kyle Peterson's start was par for
his outstanding course. Peterson (14-1, 2.96 ERA),
coming off two complete games in last weekend's
regional tournament, scattered four hits in five
innings and tossed only 41 pitches in the first four
frames. He went the distance for the Cardinal,
recording his 10th complete game of the year.
"Their freshman pitcher didn't pitch like a fresh
man," Leggett said. "He was coming at us all
evening."

of the first five innings, and only in
the fourth frame did the Cardinal
not capitalize. The lead was extend
ed to 7-1 in the bottom of the fifth
before Sauve was replaced by Brian
Mat/. (2-1,4.41 ERA). Allen walked
to begin the evening, and freshman
designated hitter Jon Schaeffer
and Kent followed with consecu
tive singles. Kent picked up an RBI
and Sees nabbed another on a field
er's choice ground ball. Stanford
added another run for good mea
sure, thanks in part to Clemson's
second error of the inning. Kilburg
picked up the RBI on his ground
ball that dribbled between the legs
of Paul Galloway, and the Cardinal
had an 8-1 edge with four innings
remaining.
The lead was trimmed again in
the sixth inning, when Doug Liv
ingston took home plate from third
on a Peterson wild pitch. Gary
Burnham took Peterson's next
pitch deep to right, and Clemson
trailed by five runs after the top of
the sixth.

Defense and pitching took over
from that point. Peterson finished
the evening giving up eight liit>
and three earned runs in nine
innings, and the Cardinal collected
its eight runs on 12 hits. Stanford
turned its third double play of the
game in the ninth inning to send
Clemson back east.
"Kyle has come up big for us all
season," Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said. "We were able to
give him some runs early, and by
getting the lead we took them out
of their game."
Those early runs gave Peterson,
who grew up in nearby Elkhorn and
was throwing in front of a partisan
crowd, a nice cushion to work with.
"It makes my job a lot easier,"
Peterson said of the early lead. "It
is relaxing. It doesn't force me to
try to punch guys out."
Carver's performance was a
continuation of his torrid ways at
the plate. He went 2-for-5 with two
runs and two RBIs and is now 5-
for-8 in two games in Omaha.
Junior left fielder Cale Carter hit 3-
for-5 with one RBI and one run
scored and has hit .500 in the past
two games.
Clemson reached the game
against the Cardinal by way of a 3-

-1 loss to the fifth-seeded Tennessee
Volunteers in the first round.
Stanford entered the battle vs.
Clemson following a first-round
loss to ('jil State-Fullerton. That
game was a thing of beauty, with
stellar defense, awesome offense
and all-around precision on and off
the mound.
* But the Cardinal found it diffi
cult to admire the objective ele
gance of a contest it could have,
and perhaps should have, won.
Instead, Stanford wondered
what might have been and lament
ed its 6-5 loss at the hands of the
top-ranked Titans.
"To summarize, it was a great
college basebiill game," said Fuller
ton head coach Augie Garrido. "We
saw two very courageous groups of
collegiate athletes out there today."
Stanford left five men in scoring
position during the game and could
not quite produce the clutch plate
performances needed to oust the
Titans (54-9), who came back from
an early 3-0 deficit to send the Car
dinal into the losers' bracket.
Fullerton spotted Stanford those
three runs before junior right-han
der Ted Silva (17-1, 2.(i7 ERA) had
found his rhythm. Junior left field
er Cale Carter blooped a single over

shortstop before junior Ail-Ameri
can catcher A.J. Hinch, a third
round draft choice of the Kansas
City Koyals, took his third pitch
over the left field wall. Then senior
third baseman Steve Carver, a
fourth-round selection of the
Philadelphia Phillies, got in the
action with a monster blast to right
field, the Cardinal's second homer
in as many at bats. Carver ended
the day 3-for-3 with an RBI and two
runs scored.
"I was just trying to throw
strikes, and they really punished
the ball," Silva said of Stanford's
four hits in the opening frame.
Stanford threatened again in
the second inning. Junior first
baseman Troy Kent's lead-off dou
ble down the left field line and
sophomore shortstop Eric Sees'
sacrifice gave the Cardinal a run
ner in scoring position with only
one out. But freshman center field
er Joe Kilburg flied out to shallow
right and Kent was caught trying
to score. After he was battered and
bruised in the first frame, Silva
retired the Stanford side in the sec
ond with three pitches.
"ISilva] seemed to calm down
and find a groove," Carver said.
"He doesn't have many weakness

es. He does a good job of mixing it
up and finding his positions."
The third and fourth home runs
of the ball game, the first two for
the Titans, cut the Cardinal lead to
3-2 in the bottom of the third
inning.
"I made some mistakes, and
they let me know that I had," Stan
ford southpaw Mike Bobbins said.
"They capitalized on everything 1
did wrong."
The Titans knotted up the score
in their half of the fifth frame when
Kilburg misjudged a fly ball to deep
center and let it drop just short of
the warning track. However, Kil
burg was not charged with an
error, and the KB! double scored
Mark Kotsay from second base and
tied the game at 3-3.
Fullerton took the lead in the
seventh frame when Robbins
began to lose control of his pitch
placement. Jeremy Giambi walked
and was hunted to second before
Bobbins walked Loyd with only one
out. With runners at the corners,
Robert Matos nabbed an RBI on a
fielder's choice play, and Joe Eras
er slapped an RBI double down the
left field line to extend the lead.
Junior right fielder Mario Iglesias
replaced Bobbins and gave up an

RBI single to center field on his
first pitch. At the end of seven
frames Fullerton's lead was 6-3.
The Cardinal quickly trimmed
the lead to 6-4 on a single by Carv
er and an RBI double to deep cen
ter field by Allen. Silva was
replaced by Kotsay on the mound
after giving up 12 hits in 7 1/3
innings of work, but junior second
baseman Brian Dallimore took
Kotsay to the center field wall on
his third pitch. The double scored
Allen and left another runner in
scoring position with only one out.
Once again, however, the Cardi
nal could not capitalize. The next
two Stanford batters, freshman
designated hitter Jon Schaeffer
and Kent , struck out and stranded
the tying run at second, keeping
the Titans' lead at
Stanford slipped into comeback
mode in the ninth but the effort fell
short. After Kilburg grounded out
and Carter Hied out, flinch and
("arver collected two-out singles and
put the tying run in scoring posi
tion. But Allen popped up to third
on a 3-0 pitch to set the final score.
"He had the green light all the
way," Marquess said. "I'll take
Dusty Allen on a 3-0 fastball to win
the game anv day."
