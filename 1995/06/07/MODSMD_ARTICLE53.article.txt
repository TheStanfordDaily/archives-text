## Baseball drops opener, battles through loser bracket

Editor's note: Because of The Daily's production
schedule, coverage of yesterday's game us. Tennessee
appears on the front page of section A. The following
story covers the results of Stanford's first two games
at the College World Series.
OMAHA, Neb. â€” The Stanford baseball squad
picked a fine time to become a powerhouse at the
plate.
The Cardinal (40-24), known more for its finesse
and less for its long ball potential during the regular
season, knocked two balls out of Rosenblatt Stadium
and sent two more within inches of the outfield
bleachers en route to its 8-3 World Series victory
over the fourth-seeded Clemson Tigers (54-14) on
Monday. The loss eliminated the Atlantic Coast Con
ference champions and kept eighth-seeded Stanford
with a perceivable pulse.
After redording only 30 home runs in its entire
56-game regular season, the Cardinal has now sent
12 dingers out of the park in its eight postseason ball
games.
On Monday, Stanford went for the jugular early
in the first frame. The Cardinal took a 3-0 lead on
senior right fielder Dusty Allen's two-run homer to
deep center field and senior third baseman Steve
Carver's RBI single to right field. For the second
game in a row, Stanford had a 3-0 lead on its oppo
nent after one inning.
"We struggled all season at the plate," Allen said.
"But right now things are starting to come together,
which is exactly what you want to have happen in
the postseason."
In a World Series in which over half of the total
runs have been scored in the first two innings of
play, Stanford struck again in the bottom of the sec
ond frame. Junior first baseman Trov Kent and

sophomore shortstop Eric Sees both singled before
freshman center fielder Joe Kilburg was hit by a
Billy Koch pitch to load the bags with no outs.
Koch (7-1, 3.35 ERA) was quickly replaced by Jeff
Sauve (5-0, 3.98 ERA), and Clemson avoided what
might have been a back-breaking inning by turning
a double play and striking out junior All-American
catcher A.J. Hinch. The Cardinal managed only one
run and led 4-0 after two innings.
But even Sauve could not keep the long ball pitch
away from the Stanford bats. Carver stepped to the
plate in the bottom of the third and blasted one 410
feet, beyond the right-field bleachers. The dinger
was Carver's second of the series and the Cardinal's
sixth in 12 innings of play in Omaha. For the second
inning in a row the Tigers turned a double play to
thwart a potential Stanford scoring binge, and the
Cardinal led 5-0 after three frames.
"We got started off on the wrong foot," said Clem
son coach Jack Leggett. "We got down early, and the
enxt thing we knew we were fighting and scrambling
to get back into the game. It wasn't conducive to how
we have been playing all season."
Clemson cut the lead to 5-1 in the fourth inning
when Kilburg dropped a (ly ball in center field. The
baserunner scored from second on the play, which
was not scored an error.
Freshman ace Kyle Peterson's start was par for
his outstanding course. Peterson (14-1, 2.96 ERA),
coming off two complete games in last weekend's
regional tournament, scattered four hits in five
innings and tossed only 41 pitches in the first four
frames. He went the distance for the Cardinal,
recording his 10th complete game of the year.
"Their freshman pitcher didn't pitch like a fresh
man," Leggett said. "He was coming at us all
evening."
