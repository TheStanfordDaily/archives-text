# They're the champs
## Cyclists capture NCCA, WCCC crowns 
### Rajen Sheth Contributing writer 
The Stanford cycling team
rounded out one of its best seasons
ever last weekend by winning the
National Collegiate Cycling Associ
ation championship in Reno, Nev.
Powered by grad student Joan Wil
son, who won the women's overall
individual championship, the team
came back in the final day to edge

out arch-rival California.
"I would not have guessed in
February that it would all end up
this way," said grad student Dario
Falquier, the team's captain.
The team completed a rare dou
ble by winning both the West
Coast Cycling Conference champi
onship, which is based on team
depth and the national champi
onship based on the strength of
the. team's top riders.

'fhe team overcame sicknesses
and threatening weather through
out the previous week. Falquier,
grad student Megan Troxell and
senior Mike Cummer all rode sick
but were still successful. In adfli
tion, it rained throughout the
week before the race, but it bright
ened up just in time for the races.
Sophomore Andrew Lewis
described it as "lucky" that every
thing turned out the way it did.
The team started the weekend
with the team time trial, a 19.6-
mile race run at an elevation of
5,000 feet. Traditionally Stan
ford's strongest event, the time
trial started the Cardinal off on
the right foot as the women's team
repeated as time trial champions
and the men's team finished sec
ond behind Colorado. The Buf
faloes seemed like a threat after
this event, but later faltered, giv
ing way to a two-team race
between Stanford and Cal.
Later on Saturday, the team got
an unexpected boost in the criteri
um, traditionally Stanford's weak
est event. Troxell said before the
race, held in downtown Reno, that
none of the women expected to
perform well in the criterium.
However, Wilson proved her
wrong by finishing fifth overall. In
the final lap, Wilson, who is in her
first year of collegiate cycling, out
sprinted Cal's Chris Eckel, an
experienced sprinter who had
beaten Stanford all year long.
"Joan's race was absolutely
amazing," Troxell said. "She rode
a really smart race."

Coach Art Walker said that the
criterium is usually for more expe
rienced racers. "One doesn't
expect great rides in the criterium
from even the best newcomer,"
Walker said. "It was a break
through race for Joan. To have one
in such an important event is real
ly, really rare."
Troxell finished 20th in the cri
terium lor the women. On the
men's side, Lewis also surpassed
expectations to finish fourth over
all. Because of the weather, the
course was not completely dry, and
the teams had to overcome numer
ous wrecks. Senior Tracy Timms
crashed very early in the race and
was knocked out of the race as she
broke a cleat and was unable to
sprint.
Despite the two stellar finishes,
Stanford lost its lead after the cri
terium and finished the first day
trailing Cal by 37 points. However,
the Cardinal boosted back up in
Sunday's road race. The biggest
story was the women's road race in
which three Stanford women
placed in the top five. Wilson, a
road race expert, once again had a
big race as she finished second.
Wilson ended up in a sprint to the
finish with Tina Mayolo of Georgia
and ended up one foot behind the
winner. Coming in right behind
Wilson were Timms, a past nat ion
al road race champion who recov
ered from the criterium to finish
fourth, and Troxell, who finished
fifth.

Grad student Joan Wilson pedaled to the individual women's
national championship this weekend in Reno, Nev.
"To have all the women in the
top five was too good to be true,"
Walker said. The trio finished as
the top three at the WCCC champi
onships as well.
The men's team, knowing that
the women's team was beating Cal
decisively, played defensively as
(hey shifted their goal towards try
ing to defeat Cal cyclists to help the
team. "The women's road race was
the knockout punch," Falquier
said. As Falquier approached the
finish, he was challenged by a rider
from Cal, and they sprinted to the
end with Falquier finishing ahead
in 13th place and helping preserve
Stanford's position over Cal. Lewis
followed Falquier to finish 22nd.
In the overall standings, Stan
ford ended up edging Cal 420-401.
Wilson edged Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo rider Julie Henderson 80-
78 to take the individual title as the
best female road cyclist for 1995.
The individual title took into
account the criterium and road
race scores. Joining Wilson in the

top 10 were Timms who finished
seventh and Troxell, the WCCC
overall season individual champi
on, who finished eighth. The win
gives Wilson All-America status in
her first year.
"This couldn't have happened
without the support and encourage
ment of the entire team, especially
Megan," Wilson said. Wilson sacri
ficed a win in the WCCC road race
three weeks ago to allow Troxell to
win the WCCC individual title.
Falquier finished 18th in the
men's overall standings to finish as
the highest Stanford cyclist. Cal's
John Lim won the men's title.
The team is looking forward to
another strong year. The NCC'A
will reduce the team size to four
men and four women next year and
will also have tighter restrictions
on grad student eligibility. Wilson
may graduate with a doctorate
before next year's nationals, Trox
ell will be in Indiana doing
research, and Timms may graduate
winter quarter. However, med stu
dent Cynthia Ferguson and Margot
Quandt, who both went to nation
als last year, will return to the
team. All the men's cyclists will
remain as well.
