# Track's All-American year crosses finish line
## 
### Matthew Lawrence Staff writer 
At the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships last week, five athletes pro
duced All-American performances to wrap up
the greatest All-American year for the Cardi
nal cross-country and track and field program
in recent history.
In the 1994-95 competitive year, nine dif
ferent athletes garnered 16 different All-
American honors for cross country and track
and field; last year, four were named All-
Americans.
"The way we finished off the season was
very good," said senior co-captain Dave Pope
joy, a fifth-place finisher in the hammer
throw. "It definitely capped off a nice season."
Nine athletes went to compete at Ten
nessee's Tom Black Track in Knoxville. Like
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships,
the final point totals did not reflect the
improvement of the program. The Stanford
men finished 54th with four points and the
women 57th with one point. However, more
than half the NCAA team was made up of
freshmen.
Popejoy scored the team's four points in
the hammer throw. USC's junior Balazs Kiss
successfully defended his NCAA title by tak
ing first place. Kiss has the best throw in the
world this year and is the gold medal favorite
at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
Popejoy was the second U.S. finisher in a
largely international hammer contest. Pope
joy's high school friend Kevin McMahon of
Georgetown took the first spot among Ameri
can athletes.
"Some people say that this was the best
hammer throw competition ever at the

NCAAs," Popejoy said. His throw of 234 feet,
one inch (71.36 meters), a new Stanford
record, would have won the NCAAs three
years ago.
Of his new Stanford record throw, Popejoy
said, "It wasn't really that good a throw. I lost
a meter or two on it. Usually when you get a
good throw off you hear the crowd. No one
cheered, so I was wondering what happened."
What happened was that the crowd
couldn't see the hammer land. When Popejoy
heard the distance over the loudspeakers he
knew that he had a new Stanford mark and a
good chance at a top-five finish in the event.
In the finals, Popejoy had two throws over 70
meters for the first time in his career.
Senior Toby Norwood, Popejoy's room
mate, also earned All-America honors with a
206-11 (63.06 meter) throw. Freshman Adam
Connolly was the next Stanford contestant
behind Norwood with a 204-1 (62.20 meter)
toss, missing All-America honors by one
place.
Popejoy and Norwood will compete at the
U.S. nationals in Sacramento next week with
pole vaulters Tyra Holt, a sophomore, and
junior Jennifer Dalton.
The women's highest NCAA finisher, red
shirt freshman Monal Chokshi, produced the
Cardinal's only point with an eighth place fin
ish in the 3,000 meters. Chokshi, the Pac-10
champion, won the first heat of the 3,000
meters preliminaries on Wednesday.
"In the first heat I knew I needed to be in
the top five to reach the finals," Chokshi
said. "I ran and I felt really good. I didn't
want to really win it, but the pack started
conservatively and picked it up. I felt really
good in the trials, and I thought if I feel this
good in the finals, I should run a PR (person

al record|.
"So I was really nervous on Friday (in the
finals]. They went out really fast. I started
out in the back. 1 should've tried to stay clos
er to them, but a gap formed between me and
the leaders.
Chokshi finished eighth in 9 minutes,
35.45 seconds. Freshman Sarna Renfro's
llth place time of 9:44.75 added another All-
America accolade to earn the honors in all
three seasons this year.
The fifth All-American was freshman
Kortney Dunscombe in the 5,000 meters. Her
lOth-place finish was also high enough among
American finishers to gain All-American hon
ors.
"We had a lot of young people go to
NCAAs, and they'll go a long way further in
the next few years," Popejoy said. "Freshmen
just aren't meant to make the NCAAs.
They're just going to get better. Going to
NCAAs is an experience that pays off later."
Chokshi agreed that the contributions of
the freshmen this year will prove beneficial
for the Stanford program in the next few
years. '
"I'm excited about the direction the whole
team is heading," Chokshi said. "Stanford
track and field is on the verge of being really
good. We're earning a lot of respect in the
track world."
Stanford competed in the best track and
field conference in the nation. Pac-10 champi
on UCLA finished second at the NCAAs.
"It's not a matter of people winning and
losing," Popejoy said of Stanford's finish in
the Pac-10. "It's about intensity. Maybe there
weren't a lot of high places, but to have so
many scorers in so many events shows we are
a well-rounded team."
