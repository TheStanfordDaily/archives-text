# Men's golf misses win by that much
## Oklahoma St. takes away sixth title in first-ever playoff hole 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Amid the hazy gray back
drop of a rainy Midwest day,
the No. 2 Stanford men's golf
team fell a single" stroke short
of successfully defending its
national title at the NCAA
Championships last week.
The Cardinal succumbed to
top-ranked Oklahoma State
after four rounds and one play
off hole at the Scarlet Course in
Columbus, Ohio. Auburn's
Chip Spratlin won the individu
al competition despite strug
gling on the final day with a 3-
over-par 75.
Freshman Tiger Woods led
all Stanford scorers with a
four-day total of 286, placing
in a tie for fifth place. The rest
of the team scored close togeth
er in the top 30.
After a season of continually
proving to be one of the
nation's best, the loss was a bit
tersweet pill for the Cardinal to
swallow.
"Words can't describe how
we felt after Oklahoma State
clinched it," said senior Jerry
Chang. "Dejected. Dismayed.
Every kind of negative emo
tion.
"We really have nothing to
be angry about. Everybody
gave it their best shot, it just
would have been nice to end the
season with a win."
Senior Ail-American William

Yanagisawa echoed his team
mate's sentiments.
"It was a good year, but it
was a really hard way to fin
ish," he said. "It's tough to see
everything come down to one
hole or one shot.
"Golf is kind of a funny
sport. No matter how much
you think about it sometimes
things just don't work out."
The final round opened with
Stanford tied for the lead with
Texas. At the turn between the
front and back nines, the Car
dinal seemed in good shape. On
top of it all, OSU was playing
four-count-four with one of its
golfers playing in a British
qualifier.
However, a remarkable run
on the final few holes by the
Cowboys coupled with difficul
ties for Stanford resulted in a
tie, which allowed OSU an
opportunity to win it in the
playoff. Woods and senior All-
American Notah Begay fin
ished regulation for the Cardi
nal with an opportunity to win
it outright, but Begay's birdie
putt on the 18t.h green was just
off the mark.
"The pressure, not necessar
ily to repeat, but simply to win
and not to let down your team
mates was incredible," Chang
said, "and those two guys have
been the ones we've been turn
ing to all year.
