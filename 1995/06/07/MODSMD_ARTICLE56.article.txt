# Men's golf misses win by that much
## Oklahoma St. takes away sixth title in first-ever playoff hole 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Amid the hazy gray back
drop of a rainy Midwest day,
the No. 2 Stanford men's golf
team fell a single" stroke short
of successfully defending its
national title at the NCAA
Championships last week.
The Cardinal succumbed to
top-ranked Oklahoma State
after four rounds and one play
off hole at the Scarlet Course in
Columbus, Ohio. Auburn's
Chip Spratlin won the individu
al competition despite strug
gling on the final day with a 3-
over-par 75.
Freshman Tiger Woods led
all Stanford scorers with a
four-day total of 286, placing
in a tie for fifth place. The rest
of the team scored close togeth
er in the top 30.
After a season of continually
proving to be one of the
nation's best, the loss was a bit
tersweet pill for the Cardinal to
swallow.
"Words can't describe how
we felt after Oklahoma State
clinched it," said senior Jerry
Chang. "Dejected. Dismayed.
Every kind of negative emo
tion.
"We really have nothing to
be angry about. Everybody
gave it their best shot, it just
would have been nice to end the
season with a win."
Senior Ail-American William

Yanagisawa echoed his team
mate's sentiments.
"It was a good year, but it
was a really hard way to fin
ish," he said. "It's tough to see
everything come down to one
hole or one shot.
"Golf is kind of a funny
sport. No matter how much
you think about it sometimes
things just don't work out."
The final round opened with
Stanford tied for the lead with
Texas. At the turn between the
front and back nines, the Car
dinal seemed in good shape. On
top of it all, OSU was playing
four-count-four with one of its
golfers playing in a British
qualifier.
However, a remarkable run
on the final few holes by the
Cowboys coupled with difficul
ties for Stanford resulted in a
tie, which allowed OSU an
opportunity to win it in the
playoff. Woods and senior All-
American Notah Begay fin
ished regulation for the Cardi
nal with an opportunity to win
it outright, but Begay's birdie
putt on the 18t.h green was just
off the mark.
"The pressure, not necessar
ily to repeat, but simply to win
and not to let down your team
mates was incredible," Chang
said, "and those two guys have
been the ones we've been turn
ing to all year.
"Neither of them should have to
put up with that kind of intense
stress."
To set up what was the first
playoff in the 98-year history of the
tournament, OSU's Bratton fin
ished the round firing off three
straight birdies in a comeback that
was reminiscent of the final round
heroics that propelled the Cardinal
to the title a year ago.
"What happened here was much
like what happened to us last year
against Texas," Goodwin said.
"That's just the way the NCAA
Championships are. Stuff like that
happens all the time."
The playoff was held on No. 18.
OSU picked up two birdies on the
hole and clinched their victory after
Woods missed a 22-footer and
Begay missed an eight-footer, both
for birdies.
"It. was really hard to watch
them go berserk after that," Good
win said. "We just sat there,
stunned and in disbelief."
The loss put a cap on a season
long rivalry between the two
squads. Stanford opened the sea

son as the No. 1 team in the nation;
however, losses to OSIJ in Febru
ary and March tilted the balance in
the Cowboys' favor, launching
them to the top spot. Both teams
have been highly successful
throughout the season, with a com
bined seven players on the two
squads making their respective All-
District squads. The matchup was
almost destined to happen.
"It was disappointing to lose,"
Yanagisawa said, "but we were
playing a great team. We have
nothing to be ashamed about."
While none of the Stanford
golfers were pointing fingers, it was
clear that the weather played a key
role in their downfall. After a beau
tiful first day, the weather turned
sour and sporadically poured rain
down on the course for the next
three days.
"The course was just so wet,"
Goodwin said. "Every time you
took a shot, it was like a shower.
"Of course everyone had to deal
with the same thing."
On the fourth and final round
however, the weather seemed par
ticularly conspiratory against Stan
ford. Two delays for a combined
four hours, three minutes struck at
inopportune times. The first
stopped a run by Yanagisawa.

"I had just birdied Nos. 8,10 and
11 when they called the delay,"
Yanagisawa said. "It's really hard
to keep focus and your momentum
when the play isn't continuous."
The second delay came as OSU
was finishing its round. The Cardi
nal golfers had started with a later
tee time, however, giving the Cow
boys an opportunity to relax a bit
while Stanford was struggling with
the elements.
"It was so chaotic," Goodwin
said. "We had to get ourselves
through all that and it was simply
exhausting. OSU was definitely a
little fresher going into the playoff."
While the disappointment of los
ing is difficult to get past, the team
did play very solidly for most of the
tournament, posting consistent
scores throughout and staying in
the top two from the first day.
"I felt good about it overall,"
Goodwin said. "We made a remark
able defense I thought, and with so
many of the guys leaving IBegay,
Yanagisawa, and senior All-Ameri
cans Casey Martin and Steve Bur
dick I, it was really emotional.
"It would have been super to
win, but I'm really proud of the
guys. They were really great this
year and they will continue to do
great things."
