Well, after 70 issues of tri
umph and defeat, good
layouts and rushed lay
outs, great photos and mug shots,
the clock reads all zeroes on Vol
ume 207. Simply put, this means
we can get on with our lives and
become students once again.
Right now, one of us could win
the Cy Young if his GPA were an
ERA (take a guess).

Doing this for four months and
change brings a lot of memories,
and in Jeremy's case, a lot of
pulled hair. As our picture indi
cates, Jeremy still had far too
much left to comb. But Seth, even
though he threatened to "physi

cally kill" his partner 437 times,
left for the East Coast a few
issues too soon to control the out
come of this fond farewell.
Truly, we spanned the entire
country to bring our grand finale
to the table, and as much as one
of us curses how this job has
destroyed his life, both of us, even
he, have a few things we'll carry
with us to the grave — even if it
takes awhile for one of us to phys
ically kill the other.
UConn: Many thanks to the
University of Connecticut
Department of Athletics. Seth
appreciates your support of the
propaganda he tried to pass off on
these unsuspecting Stanford peo
ple.
Sacramento Kings: Many
thanks to the Sacramento Kings.
Jeremy appreciates that you
don't give a rat's behind about
the propaganda he tried to pass
off on these unsuspecting Stan
ford people.
Hell on Earth: There's noth


A Dearth
of Rock

Sethemy
Goldstone
ing quite like returning from
spring break, knowing you have a
ton of stories to report, to find
that your women's swimming
writer has taken off for Oxford
without ever having told you of
his plans. The sports editor on
duty that night was forced to con
script the editor in chief into writ
ing an article on the women's
team's championship run, while
he pieced together something on
the men's swimming team.
But the fun had only just
begun. The sports editor was soon
forced to take dictation over the
phone from his partner and the
women's basketball beat writer
who were in the air somewhere
over Wyoming on their way home
from the NCAA Women's Basket
ball Final Four. This didn't make
him very happy considering the
game had ended over 24 hours
before. It didn't make his partner
very happy either. He was forced
to swallow an $82 AirFone bill.
The lone bright spot in the
whole sordid affair was staff writ
er Brian Lee, who came in on
extremely short notice to deliver
an extra-long men's gymnastics
article. Many thanks, Mr. Lee.
You saved the day.
Hell on Earth, part II: An
$82 dollar AirFone bill pales in
comparison with the 11:30 p.m.
realization that you have less
than 50 percent of the space that
you thought. Typesetting stud
Robert, the man who gave Jere
my's column its name, had the
heart to point out that I had 150
inches of space to eliminate. This
is not fun. To the track team,
which lost a key preview that day,
we apologize. But your coverage
has been solid.
Apologies to the crew pro
gram: On the other hand, yours
has not. Yes, you all did get
screwed. We just want to say
we're sorry and that the slight
was not an intentional one. Due
to a variety of extenuating cir
cumstances, we were not able to
give vou the coverage that vour

hard work deserved. We will
endeavor to make sure that our
successors do not have the same
problems.
Thursday night fun and
excitement: In the winter, one
of us was donning a headset to
broadcast women's basketball
while the other was here until 2
a.m. having the time of his life. Of
course, he is currently catching
up on the lost sleep in Alexandria,
Va., while his partner types this
at 2 a.m.
The elusive sixth title:
Stanford had a chance to make
history on Saturday when the
men's golf team threatened to
take an NCAA-record sixth title.
Unfortunately, Oklahoma State
ended that dream in the first
playoff hole. No worries, though
the record we would have been
breaking is our own (of course, we
still share it with the UCLA Bru
ins). And we're sure that we'll
have another chance to break it
next year. For the meantime,
baseball is still playing with us.
LSJUMB: Seth wants the
members of the band to know
that he appreciates all the anony
mous and abusive messages he
found on his answering machine
and in his e-mail account. That's
exactly the sort of stuff he was
talking about.
Apparently, the Band thinks
the way to get Seth to change his
opinions is to make him feel bad.
And that the way to make him
feel bad is to make him feel
unliked. They are desperately
wrong on both counts. Seth will
continue his one-man crusade
against the evil perpetrations of
the Band for as long as he lives.
Diamond in the Rough:
Seth suggests that a certain Mr.
Agrawal look for a new group of
friends to hang out wit h. Of the
14 messages Seth received in the
wake of his column on the Band,
his response was the only one
that was a well-argued defense of
the Band. It intelligently
addressed each of Seth's charges
and caused him to reconsider his
opinions.
Unfortunately for Mr. Agraw
al, his message was the first one
Seth read. The following 13, writ

ten by individuals who obviously
hadn't yet learned to distinguish
between a computer and a urinal,
were enough to end that change
of heart. However, Mr. Agrawal
should know that he has at least
created a spark of hope within
Seth that there actually is intelli
gent life somewhere within the
bowels of the Band.
Todd Bozeimui and Pac-10
officials: Jeremy has occasional
ly vented his anger that direction
but has sparked no responses
that put his name in the Review.
Although Seth has now seen his
name in print in more publica
tions, I have received more air
time thanks to my other pursuits.
Cardinal baseball: Kudos to
the Stanford baseball team,
which failed to live up to expecta
tions early in the year, but
rebounded from a number of seri
ous injuries to exceed expecta
tions later in the season by
advancing to the College World
Series.
Kyle Peterson: This amazing
freshman was a godsend for Car
dinal baseball in 1995. He also
always gave us a candidate for
Athlete of the Week. We'd like to
wish Kyle the best of luck as he
continues his baseball career.
Brevin Knight's quadruple
double: All right, he didn't quite
make it, coming up one short in
two categories. Still, it was one of
the most amazing performances
we've ever seen and one of the
most memorable moments of our
reign as sports editors.
Major League Baseball: Co
back to the parks. 'Nuff said.
Major League Baseball,
says the other half: What's the
hurry? There's still the NBA
Finals, and football's just around
the corner. Make them suffer
awhile.
As editors, we've enjoyed our
share of suffering. But for four
months, we were in the thick of
some of the most exciting athletic
action in college history. We'll try
not to cry as we walk out the door.
After all, we'd better save up
some tears for finals.

Allysam Mizowuchi, we 'd like to
say thanks — but why us?
