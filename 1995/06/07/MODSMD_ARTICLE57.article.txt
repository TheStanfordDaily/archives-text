Well, after 70 issues of tri
umph and defeat, good
layouts and rushed lay
outs, great photos and mug shots,
the clock reads all zeroes on Vol
ume 207. Simply put, this means
we can get on with our lives and
become students once again.
Right now, one of us could win
the Cy Young if his GPA were an
ERA (take a guess).

Doing this for four months and
change brings a lot of memories,
and in Jeremy's case, a lot of
pulled hair. As our picture indi
cates, Jeremy still had far too
much left to comb. But Seth, even
though he threatened to "physi

cally kill" his partner 437 times,
left for the East Coast a few
issues too soon to control the out
come of this fond farewell.
Truly, we spanned the entire
country to bring our grand finale
to the table, and as much as one
of us curses how this job has
destroyed his life, both of us, even
he, have a few things we'll carry
with us to the grave â€” even if it
takes awhile for one of us to phys
ically kill the other.
UConn: Many thanks to the
University of Connecticut
Department of Athletics. Seth
appreciates your support of the
propaganda he tried to pass off on
these unsuspecting Stanford peo
ple.
Sacramento Kings: Many
thanks to the Sacramento Kings.
Jeremy appreciates that you
don't give a rat's behind about
the propaganda he tried to pass
off on these unsuspecting Stan
ford people.
