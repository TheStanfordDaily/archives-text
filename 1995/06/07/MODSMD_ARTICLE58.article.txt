# Top Ten Sports Stories of the Year
## Championships, coaches lead pack of memorable moments 
### Seth Goldstein Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Five national titles and count
less records later, the 1994-95
athletic calendar shows still one
more opportunity to catch that
elusive sixth NCAA title. As this
went to press, baseball's season
is hanging by a thread, but then
again, it was last week as well. In
a year of Cardinal greatness, the
rings and the coaches dominated
the news.
Narrowing such a list of mem
orable stories to 10 is probably
unfair and definitely impossible.
In this, the last issue of the year,
we gave it a try anyway.
1 Stanford's five nation
al titles ties NCAA
• mark. The disappointing
thing was that even more teams
had a shot at eclipsing the stan
dard. The unreal depth of the
Cardinal athletic program was
never more apparent, as water
polo, women's volleyball,
women's swimming and diving,
men's gymnastics and men's
tennis brought home the tro
phies.
Only Stanford in 1991-92 and
UCLA 10 years before have ever
duplicated the feat, and Cardinal
teams are poised to make anoth
er run at the record books next
year.
2 Bill Walsh calls it a
career. The Genius came
• to the Farm amid fanfare
appropriate for a legend. Three
years and an unimpressive 17-
17-1 mark later, Walsh stepped
down as football coach amid
bickering players and a leaky
defense.
Nonetheless, Walsh brought
the squad its first bowl victory
since 1978 with the Jan. 1, 1993
Blockbuster blowout of Penn
State. Stanford's coach then?
Walsh.
The hiring of his successor
generated equal fanfare. Most

experts had never heard of
Tyrone Willingham, and after
all, he had never been a coordi
nator before. But he was a right
hand man of Dennis Green, and
now he gets his chance.
3Tara VanDerveer is
named to coach
• Olympic team. The 10-
year women's basketball coach
was, to nobody's surprise,
named to head the 1996 Senior
U.S. Women's National Team.
VanDerveer will spend the
upcoming season heading the
charge for the gold medal in
Atlanta.
VanDerveer's temporary
departure shook the ranks of a
previously stable coaching staff.
Associate coach Amy Tucker
took the reins, joining former
Old Dominion and USC coach
Marianne Stanley as co-head
coaches, while longtime assis
tants Julie Plank and Carolyn
Jenkins extended somewhat bit
ter resignations.
4 Men's tennis finds per
fection. Seventeen years
• after Dick Gould's squad
won the national championship
with a flawless record, a senior
less squad did it again. No team
in the NCAAs even posed much
of a threat to a squad that will be
odds-on favorites to repeat in
1996.
5 Senior women's swim
mers never lose. The
• graduating class saved its
toughest NCAA crown for last,
coming back to down Michigan
and complete a four-year sweep.
Richard Quick, who will also
coach at the 1996 Olympics, has
still never lost a dual meet since
arriving at Stanford after the
1988 season, and the class of
1995 never tasted defeat as a
team.
6 Men's hoops wins first
tourney game since
• 1942. UNC-Charlotte

became the only squad in 53
years to fall to the Cardinal in
the NCAA Tournament. The
Cardinal bumped the 49ers
thanks to a late surge and a fast
break layup by senior Bart Lam
mersen, advancing to the second
round to be obliterated by Mas
sachusetts.
After the fastest start in
memory, Stanford coasted
through its non-conference
schedule and gained some
national recognition behind a
star backcourt of sophomore
Brevin Knight and junior Dion
Cross. A late-season slide
knocked Stanford out of the
national rankings and onto the
bubble, but the Cardinal
grabbed a 10-seed in the NCAA
Tournament.
7 Men's swimming's
three-year reign comes
• to an end. Up and coming
Michigan proved to be too much
for the Cardinal, who was
attempting to match the
women's streak of four straight
titles. Skip Kenney, another
future Olympic coach, came up
just short in his bid for a seventh
national championship.
8 Men's gymnastics pulls
a surprise. Although
• Sadao Harnada's team
entered the NCAAs with a No.
14 ranking in the nation, the
Cardinal had already shocked
the competition at the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Cham
pionships.
At Columbus, Ohio, Josh
Stein and company did it again,
cruising to a victory that had
everybody except the Stanford
crew scratching his head.
9 Fabulous freshmen
make immediate
• impact. Stanford brought
in both Dial Award winners to
the class of 1998, and Tiger
Woods and Kristin Folkl wasted
little time rising to the top of
their games.

Folkl literally rose, skying
over frustrated opponents for
easy kills, taking home an NCAA
volleyball title to go with her
eight high school state champi
onships and earning first-team
All-America honors in the pro
cess. Then she worked her way
into the rotation of Tara Van-
Derveer's loaded women's hoops
team and became Stanford's top
player in the postseason.
Woods kept his feet on the
ground, but his drives sent jaws
to the ground. The 19-year-old,
already being hailed as golf's
Messiah, quickly became Stan
ford's most recognizable athlete
and was the top amateur at the
Masters. He also finished in the
running for the Nicklaus Award
as the top golfer in college.
Not to be outdone was Kyle
Peterson, a phenom who started
in the bullpen and went on to
become the best freshman
hurler in Stanford history, with
a 14-1 record.

_L \J • sight, is left for
dead, comes back to life and
still has a shot. The preseason
ranking showered a fairly young
squad with unrealistic expecta
tions, and Mark Marquess'
squad battled injuries and incon
sistent hitting to struggle
through a mediocre regular sea
son.
But the Cardinal has caught
fire in the nation's heartland,
fighting off elimination three
times in Wichita and needing a
few more wins to take it all for
the first time since 1988. The
worst seed in the eight-team
field almost shocked Cal State-
Fullerton to open the series, and
the road to the championship
will include two must-win
rematches.
The experts have said it can't
be done. Hut if Stanford pulls it
off, the experts will say they knew
all along. And the top story of the
year will have to he amended.
