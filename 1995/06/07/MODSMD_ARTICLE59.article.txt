# Women crew last to wrap up
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Baseball may or may not be in action this week
end, but women's crew will unquestionably end
the Stanford athletic season in Cincinnati, Ohio,
at the National Championships this weekend.
As the second-place finisher at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships in May, the Cardinal
garnered an automatic, funded invitation to
Cincinnati. Stanford joins at least nine and possi
bly 11 other squads vying for the national title.
"We're probably the underdogs," said head
coach Jocelyn McCandless. "We have a young crew
with five sophomores, one freshman, two juniors
and only one graduating senior. We're going in
with nothing to lose."
Washington, the Pac-10 Champion, is expected
to battle Princeton and possibly Brown for the
crown, but Stanford is hoping to sneak in for a
medal. The squad topped Wisconsin earlier in the
spring, but the Badgers have improved their times
since then. Cornell, the last of three Ivy League
schools in the field, topped Stanford in the fall but
those results came with different crews.
Washington State, Cal State-Sacramento,
Michigan and Massachusetts hold down the four
other definite spots, while Northeastern and Vir
ginia may enter the running later this week.

The action gets underway Friday morning with
preliminary heats, and the afternoon heats will
trim the field to six. These boats will compete in
the 4 p.m. EDT final on Saturday.
"We're already in the top 10," McCandless said.
"Anything from here is a bonus. Right now, Stan
ford is probably sixth — that might be a little gen
erous."
The Cardinal was underestimated at the Pac-10
Championships, when the three-seed moved up a
notch to take the Pac-10's last automatic bid.
Stanford hopes to extend its limitations one final
time this weekend, as many observers felt McCan
dless' team would never make the trip to nation
als.
"I had hoped it for them, but you never can
say," McCandless said. "They have achieved what
they are capable of. [At the dawn of the season],
we had good athletes who didn't have racing expe
rience. They took the season and developed."
With such a young squad, the development
should continue into next year, when Stanford
may Held its finest team in recent memory. For
now, the squad hopes to use this year's trip to
Cincinnati as a block to build on.
"It's not like we have eight seniors and we're
going in to do or die," McCandless said. "We're
going through this weekend as a learning experi
ence, something we can use in the future."
