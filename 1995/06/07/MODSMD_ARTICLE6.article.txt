She's one of the best on the Palo Alto police force
and has caught alleged bombers, thieves and
pranksters. She's friendly, easy-going and a great
partner. She's also furry and walks on all fours.
Gerti, a five-year-old German Shepherd who has
been on the Palo Alto police force for two years,
serves a dual purpose because she specializes in nar
cotics detection as well as street work.
"Gerti comes to work with me and then we go
home. She is laid-back, kind of quiet — kind of like
me," Palo Alto Police Officer Bruce Hollenbeck said.
"I spend more time with Gerti than with my family
— she's my partner."
Gerti has been involved in some of Palo Alto's
largest cases, including a few at the Farm. "Gerti
found the Betas at the art museum over spring
break," said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"When there is a burglary in process, especially in
such a big building as the museum where there are a
lot of hiding places, it is very frightening for an offi
cer to go into the dark," he continued. "Gerti found
two of the bad guys in the bushes."
"She is also trained to find bombs, explosives and
gunpowder," Niemeyer added. Because of her popu
larity and her ability, Gerti even has her own trading
cards, complete with stats on the back.
Niemeyer said sometimes dogs do the work
human officers cannot. "A couple of years ago, an in-

Man's best friend is also a
source of protection. According to
Hollenbeck, canines are trained
for preventative patrol in commer
cial areas and are often used to
search buildings and fields for hid
den criminals.
"The dogs have a real keen
sense of smell. They can pick up a
scent and then backtrack to find
the hidden suspect or object," said
Hollenbeck. "People think twice
about running when there is a dog
present." He added that officers
are less likely to be injured when
on patrol with a canine.
"I'd like to dispel the rumor

that dogs are used to chew people
up," Hollenbeck said. "They use
their mouths to grab people but
are never used in crowd control
situations."
The Palo Alto Police Depart
ment currently has four dogs on
its force that range from two to 10
years old. The dogs train 180
hours during a month-long school
ing and then participate in in-ser
vice training
"Canines are a real asset to any
police department," Niemeyer
said. He added that the Stanford
Police Department currently does
not own any dogs.
"Although dogs are quite effec
tive as partners in real tough
areas, the downside is that they
are expensive and require a large
amount of training to keep them
current," Niemeyer said.
"Most of our officers live too far
away, like Campbell or the East
Bay, for dogs to be practical, since
they must live with a person. We
can't kennel them," Niemeyer
added.
