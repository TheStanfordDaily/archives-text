# Even bitter Pirates, Pistons fans can relive sports memories
## 
### 
I is sports. Most ccmmonly recognized
as the "Pirate Guy," I live sports. I
have vivid memories of some of the
greatest, and worst, moments in sport
ing history.

I saw "The Pass" by Doug Flutie and
the home run Kirk Gibson, hometown
boy, hit off Dennis Eckersley. I watched
as Julius Krving received his only NBA
Championship ring. Bird stole that
in hounds pass and iny heart. Hick
Mahorn, Bill Laimbeer and Dennis Rod
man shoved their way to rebounds. Isiah
Thomas scored 43 points on a bad ankle
against the Lakers but the Pistons lost
in seven. And a reserve catcher singled
the (Mid of the Bonds era in Pittsburgh.
My earliest memory of an athletic

event was the 1981 Sugar Bowl when
Dan Devine walked off the field in
defeat, losing to the Georgia Bulldogs in
his final game as the Notre Dame foot
ball head coach. I also remember the
optimism surrounding Gerry Faust
when he was hired to be the new coach.
My claim as a true Notre Dame fan is
based entirely on the fact that 1 was in
attendance at his first pep rally, which
celebrated the new era in Fighting Irish
football.
The era ended as I watched his last
game from my couch. The 56-7 debacle
against "the convicts," more commonly
known as the University of Miami NFL
football team, finalized my hatred for
the Hurricanes and Jimmy Johnson and
convinced me that Notre Dame would
have to change its attitude and become a
little more dirty in order to win.
It did. We hired Lou Holtz.
And during that era, my skin color
began to change to black and gold.
Despite the fact I never stepped foot in
Pittsburgh until this winter on my flight
home, I live and die with the Pirates.
I first began following Pittsburgh
after Bill Madlock was traded to them. I
was a naive second-grader and thought
their colors looked cool. I still do.

The drug scandals of the mid-'SOs
didn't affect me. I was too young to com
prehend and I had worse things to worry
about. The Pirates were residing in the
cellar, Reagan was still in the White
House and I wanted to be Ivan Hoesky.
Then in the summer of 1989, I got my
first Pirates hat. My life changed. Before
then, I wore the green hat of my Softball
team every time I played tennis. After
that watershed event, 1 wore my fitted
golden "P" every moment I spent on the
courts and in school.
People's perceptions of me changed.
Instead of the kid with the bad attitude
on the tennis court who wore a green
hat, I metamorphosed into the kid with
the bad attitude on the tennis court who
wore a Pirates hat. Baseball fans started
coming out of the woodwork and began
talking to me. My English teacher, the
die-hard Cleveland Indians fan of 40
years, and I talked baseball almost every
day in class. We discussed the Felix Fer
min for Jay Bell trade. He thought that
he got ripped off. I believed that I got
ripped off. He consoled himself with the
knowledge that the Indians had just
drafted a shortstop named Mark Lewis
1990 rolled around. Bonds tore up t he
National League hitting .301 with 33

home runs and 52 stolen bases. The
Pirates won the East only to lose to Rijo
and the Reds.
1991 came by and they repeated, tear
ing up the competition. Atlanta, my sec
ond favorite NL team, (I had watched
them since the mid-1980s on the Super-
Station, TBS) came from nowhere
("Wow. At 19-19, the Braves are at .500
for the first time this late in the season
since 1983.") to stun the Dodgers and
win the West. However, John Smoltz,
another hometown boy, and Steve Avery
shut out Pittsburgh at Three Rivers Sta
dium to win the NLCS and go to the
World Series.
In 1992, my life irrevocably changed.
I entered Stanford University, Bobby
Bonilla left for the Mets and the Pirates
released Bill Landrum, their closer from
the year before. Somehow Pittsburgh
had won the division and now were fac
ing the Braves again.
The Pirates had started Doug Drabek
in game seven of the Championship
Series and he was beginning to tire.
Going into the bottom of the ninth,
Pittsburgh had held a 2-0 lead but that
was threatening to shrink. Jose Lind
had just made his seventh error of the
season, at absolutely the worst possible

tim*Â», when I started swearing.
Stan Belinda had just entered the
game.
An eternity and 10 chewed-up finger
nails later, Francisco Cabrera began my
bitter phase. It was inaugurated by Ari
Kurt/, when he jumped up and down on
a table and ran around the Branner
lounge, yelling at the top of his lungs. I
just sat there, staring blankly at the
screen.
A few days ago, I turned 21 and I
hope, a new leaf. I do not wish to be
known as the Pirates guy anymore as I
will officially dub myself "The Lugnuts
Guy."
You there, stop your laughing.
The Lansing Lugnuts'", my home
town team, will enter the world of minor
league baseball next year. 1 vow to
change my colors from black and gold to
blue and red. Next year, during the
women's basketball games, I will be pac
ing the stands of Maples Pavilion wear
ing the Lugnut hat.
Look for me, I'll be the one donning
the Pirates jacket.

Despite the demise of the BBSL, Emery
will still prove he is a better fantasy
league manager than Mike Liu.
