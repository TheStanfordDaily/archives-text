# Coaching is a whole new ball game

In black and white commercials,
famous Nike athletes urge us to
Participate in the Lives of Amer
ican Youth, P.L.A.Y. Michael 'Jor
dan smiles and the shot fades to a
child shooting baskets on a
makeshift dirt playground.

For a long time I watched those
commercials and like most people
was more impressed with the
famous athletes than with their
message. But last year two of my
friends called a number in the back
of The Daily asking for volunteer
Little league coaches. At the time I
didn't think much of it, but when
they told me that we were going to

coach a team of 10-year-olds, 1 start
ed to wonder exactly what 1 was get
ting myself into.
In the last two seasons of coach
ing, I've learned a great deal about
children, about the national pastime
and about myself. As a child, I never
played baseball. I was a runner on
the track team and the cross-coun
try team. In the winter I played bas
ketball and one fall in high school I
played cornerback on the junior var
sity football team. I kept myself
busy with sports, but I never found
myself with a l)at and ball.
It was strange to find myself
coaching a sport that I had never
played. Like a student cramming for
a final, I read up on the game and
went to a coaches' training session.
I realized that playing a game
and coaching a game are entirely
different things. I'm the first to
admit that I dread to see a fly bjdl hit
my way, but when it comes to coach
ing a 10-year-old to chase down that
same fly ball, it's all different. I can
tell him: Get a good jump on the ball
when it leaves the bat, get under
neath the ball, use both hands, find

your cut off man and step into the
throw. I am say these things even if
I can't do them myself.
I have become all those coaches
who used to give me orders, and
strangely enough I enjoy it. I can
enjoy coaching a game in which I
have few skills and almost no expe
rience, because I can see that these
boys love to play. Despite their hard
est efforts to the contrary, they are
learning.
More than the basic skills, more
than the complicated rules, sport is
about people. It's about having fun,
and if it's not fun, it's not worth
doing. In a recent interview I spoke
to a man who had accomplished
about everything there is to accom
plish in his sport. Despite all of his
own achievements, he rememlx?red
the sport not by the wins and losses,
but by all the friends he made in the
sport. After he finished competing,
he began to coach so he could teach
these same ideas to younger ath
letes.
Athletes, young and old,
improve. Seeing a child get his first
hit is beautiful not because of the hit

itself, but because it represents the
start of a learning process.
Personal accomplishments fulfill
a need to prove ourselves, but aiding
the success of others satisfies some
thing else. Winning or losing often
cannot be controlled. Kffort can be
controlled. That's the message that
we tried to get through to our team.
The physical aspects of the game
will always change, but as long as
the mental attitude remains the
same, you control what matters
most, yourself.
That's a lesson I know I will
remember for the rest of my life.
Sport may turn into a mass of num
bers, but behind those numbers are
people. People make sport and
games should be fun. If we learn
something from our involvement in
sports, even better.

Matthew, Danny and Xavier's team
lost by one run in the Ixittorn of the
sixth inning of the Palo Alto Little
League playoffs last Sunday, but
damn, they played a great game.
Danny is convinced the umpire
missed the call at home.
