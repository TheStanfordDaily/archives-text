# The 						Mann himself picks Hakeem, Rockets in six over Magic
## 
### 
And then there were two. Alter
five weeks of the battling,
bouncing, bricking of NBA
playoff basketball, only the defend
ing champion Houston Rockets and
Eastern Conference champion
Orkmdo Magic remain, preparing to
square off tonight at the O-rena in
Orlando, Fla.

The drama is there, waiting for
Bob Costas, Marv Albert and the
NBC sponges to soak it up. Defend
ing champions vs. the new kid on
the block. Shaq vs. Hakeem. Experi
ence vs. youth. Will Hakeem pass
the torch to a new generation of bas
ketball and a new dynasty in Orlan
do?
On the surface, one would be
inclined to put money on the Magic.
They took both meetings in the reg
ular season, by 23 in a rout in Orlan
do and by 11 at the Summit in
Houston.
Yet, the Rockets obviously have

proven they have more than their
47-35 regular season record indi
cates, including a rejuvenated Clyde
Drexler seeking a ring to cap off a
career which will inevitably land
him in the Hall of Fame. The Magic,
if anything, have shown less, drop
ping as many games at home in the
playoffs as they did all season,
including one to the sub-.500
Boston Celtics.
Obviously, the series will ride the
momentum of the matchup in the
middle. Olajuwon, last season's
MVP, has been on a tear as of late.
He h;is led the Rocket scoring attack
with 33 points per game on 54.3 per
cent shooting from the field. The
most impressive statistics in his
playoff run have come in the mar
quee matchup against this year's
MVP David Robinson. Olajuwon
also shut him down defensively,
putting the clamps on the NBA's
scoring champ.
O'Neal, on the other hand, has
not been tested by anyone near the
caliber of Robinson. The top East
ern Conference centers, Patrick
Ewing and Alonzo Mourning,
bowed out of competition before
they reached O' Neal. Despite the
lack of big names down low, Shaq-
Fu has shown signs of weakness
against opponents as lame as Eric
Montross and Will Perdue.
The two powerhouses did neu
tralize each other in the regular sea

son, but we have already established
the unimportance of those two
games. Olajuwon's quickness and
whirling dervish will find success
against O' Neal, but Shaq does have
the size advantage and can make
this matchup relatively insignificant
if he gets good enough position in
the lime to overpower Hakeem.
The key to the series, if Shaquille
can hold his own, may be at the
power forward position. Horace
Grant at 6-foot-10 apparently will
have no problem throughout the
series barring a comeback from
Rocket Carl Hcrrera, who has been
out for the playoffs due to injury.
Indiana effectively silenced Grant
with the Davis brothers, Antonio
and Dale, who have enough size,
strength and talent to keep the
active Grant off the offensive
boards.
But Rocket forwards Pete Chil
cutt mid Chucky Brown do not have
the last name Davis, nor the ability
to stop Grant. Rudy Tomjanovich's
problem at this position mirrors the
Bulls' trouble in their second-round
series against the Magic in which
Toni Kukoc and a slew of others fell
prey to General Grant.
That matchup may represent the
Magic's only advantage, however, as
Rocket personnel in the backcourt
and at small forward has the poten
tial to stir up some major danger for
Brian Hill's coaching staff. Essen

tially, the problem lies in the fact
that 6-foot-7 point guard Anfernee
Hardaway is probably the best
Magic defender in every matchup,
but unfortunately for Orlando, can
not guard all three men. Rocket
small forward Robert Horiy at 6-
foot-10 will cause fits for either Den
nis Scott or Nick Anderson, who will
give at least five inches to the taller
Horiy. Yet, what the Magic lack in
size, they will not make up for in
quickness. Horry will have a path to
the lane before Scott even reacts.
Defensively, Horry makes it diffi
cult for both Anderson and Scott,
who excel at launching the three
point bomb resulting from the dou
ble-team down low on Shaq. With
the 6-foot-10 Horry running out on
them, the Magic sharpshooters may
struggle to get a good look at the
basket. Scott and Anderson's accu
racy, at .408 and .402 respectively,
have consistently been a tell-tale
sign of Magic success.
However, pre-series matchups
see Anderson shadowing Drexler at
the swingman position, with relief
from Anthony Bowie off the bench.
Anderson has had success defending
some talented two-guards in these
playoffs. Yet we all know that
Michael was not Michael and that
Reggie is a head case. Thus, the
Anderson clamps on both Jordan
and Miller was more a product of
their own failure than his success.

Thus lineup would leave a ren
dezvous between Penny Hardaway
and Kenny Smith and Sam Cassell
off the bench. Hardaway has an
extreme advantage in the post with
at least a five-inch advantage. But
the pesky Smith and Cassell could
put some defensive pressure on
Hardaway who has been profligate
in the playoffs, turning the ball over
more than three times per game.
Should Hardaway choose to come
out of his shell, it may spell more
success for the Magic.
If Horry dominates his matchup
as he should and Drexler gives
Anderson fits, Brian Hill will face
some major matchup difficulties,
and he will be forced to come up
with brilliant alternatives which I
am about to prescribe?. (So Brian, if
you are reading, I give you permis
sion to follow my advice with the
demand that Hannah Storm
acknowledge my contributions.)
Put Hardaway on Horry. Despite
giving up three or four inches,
Penny has the quickness to shut
down Horry, who is not a power
player and has been an integral part
of the Rockets' postseason run.
That leaves an obvious mismatch
with the slow Scott on either Cassell
or Smith, who can run circles
around the three-point specialist.
So, bring in Brian Shaw for defen
sive purposes mid to handle the ball
if Penny is having trouble. Hill can

also try Hardaway on Drexler which
might pose defensive trouble for the
older Drexler.
Of course, this is all on paper,
and what transpires on the hiird
wo<xl does not always follow.
Experience will be a very large
factor as Houston's aire returns to
the finals for the second straight
year. Newcomer Drexler has seen
the finals twice before, but he played
against the Bulls in 1992, so he lost.
Grant's hand unappreciatively
boasts three rings 112 rom his days in
Chicago, yet the others will be visit
ing the championship round for the
first time.
Orlando definitely has a chance
in this series. Grant will have to
exploit Houston's holes for all they
are worth. If he does and the Magic
win, look for Horace to garner MVP
honors. Hardaway must step up in
big games, which he seldom has.
Shaq will have to do whatever it
takes to stop Hakeem, a feat which
the Western Conference's top cen
ters have found impossible. Essen
tially, the Magic need all of this as
well as a calming of the finals jitters
in order to take the title.
In three more words, I louston in
six.

Courtney would like to remind the
Rochets that even with a title this
year, they need one more to match
Da Bulls.


Where's
Chicago?
