# When you get a little lonely: tales of Marcia and me
## story by Benjamin Jeremiah Morgan graphic by Alicia Padron 
### 
Have you ever met a legend? I recent
ly did and it was everything it's built
up to he and even more. Maureen
McCormick, better known as Marcia Brady
from the irrepressible Brady Bunch, was
schlepping — oops, I mean promoting —
her new CD at a record store in San Fran
cisco and I was there to meet and greet the
fair songstress.
Meeting Maureen was like, the shit!
There's just no other way to describe it. It
was better than a Tootsie pop with the little
Indian and star on it. Better than getting the
25-cent prize bubble with the gold)en)
watch or KISS sticker inside. Better than,
well, everything!
I anxiously waited in line with my best
friend since kindergarten — she and I were
co-presidents of the now defunct Brady
Bunch Fan Club. The people in line behind
me were having a really intelligent conver
sation about whether or not Pebbles and
Bam-Bam ever got married. And I thought,
"Yeah, I'm in the right place. These are my
people."
As we got closer to the thespian goddess,
I shivered with anticipation. I began drop
ping items of memorabilia I brought to
have emblazoned with her gold marker. In
my right hand were my Brady Bunch lunch

box which contained her new country CD,
a copy of Funk N' Groove (my zine), and
closely coveted in my left, was an old record
that she and Chris Knight (Peter) crooned
together back in Brady heyday.
We were next! It was difficult to harness
my unbridled lust. I mean, Maureen is like
one of my most fab-fave icons of this mil
lennium. It was a pregnant moment in my
life that I'm sure never to forget.
She was visually arresting. I eeked out an
introduction, followed by, "You're totally
going to hate us, we have a bunch of stuff
for you to sign." A dazed and delightful
Maureen McCormick looked at me with
curiosity and acquiescence. I might as well
have been wearing a "Hello, my name is
Dork,"sticker, but I didn't care. I wanted to
assure her that I wasn't insane, just lively
(it's a thin line I constantly tread).
She signed my lunch box and then my
friend Ferris' matching one. We gave her a
copy of our zine which features Mike Brady
on the cover, smoking! She signed her CD, a
poster and the record for me. We asked her
whatever happened to Harvey Klinger but
she didn't know. She was impressed that
Ferris traveled all the way to New York City
to see her recent turn as Rizzo in Grease.
I ler daughter, Natalie, age 5, was at her side

the entire time. An adorable moppet with
out question.
I have to admit though, much of my time
spent with Maureen was riddled with
provocative and, well, downright lewd
thoughts. Maureen's eerily vapid, yet
hauntingly alluring voice is pretty power
ful. Her rendition of "Ben" makes me weep
instantly whenever 1 hear it. Hut what kept
echoing through my head were the sexual
ized lyrics she sang in both past and pre
sent.
I cite for you a few lines from the classic
Brady hit, Candy (Sugar Shoppe): "I wanna
take you to my sugar shoppe so come on, I
want to give you all the love I got so come
on. Sipping milkshakes in the hot sun,
c'mon sugardrop and give me some." I'm
sorry, what? Is that "C'mon sugardrop" or
"C'mon sugar, drop" and give me some? It
sounds like milkshakes weren't all they were
sipping if you ask me, but nobody has. Be
sides the obvious promotion of tooth decay,
these sassy lyrics probably lie at the roots of
the PMRC.
Les chansons de Maureen today are
highly charged as well. I've identified
this recurring theme of smut and su
crose in her latest hit, "Might As Well Be
Me." "You're like a kid in a candy store.
Don't know what kind of sugar you're look
ing for and Darlin' it might as well be me."
Proof! So I feel justified in my lurid
thoughts standing next to the sexpot of the
'70s as the lyrics from "I'd Have to Call It
l ove," reverberate through the record store.
"He does me wrong, he does me right. He
does mecrazy in the middle of the night. He
takes me slow, he takes me fast. He takes his
time he knows now to make it last."
After our moment in the spotlight with
the venerable actress / singer / superstar
was over, the stars barely out of our eyes and
my panties in a bunch, we were greeted with
a unique and unexpected opportunity.
Lurking in the outskirts of the whole "meet
Maureen McCormick extravaganza" was a
mysterious gentleman who was somehow
involved in the inner sanctum. We carefully
studied his actions and decided indeed this
was probably her husband so we queried,
"are you Michael Cummings?" (We got his
name from an article I had just read about
Maureen). He was indeed.

We chatted away with Michael for quite a
spell. We told him where to get a good cup
of coffee and he said he wished he had met
us 10 minutes earlier. It was like we were as
thick as thieves. He recounted the tale of
how he didn't even know who Maureen was
when they met and had never seen the
show. And I'm thinking, "He crawled out
from under what rock?" I seriously ques
tioned the reality of this claim, but upon
careful reflection on his career as a comput
er expert, it made perfect sense.
Michael was trying to understand our
compulsive and perhaps borderline psy
chotic fixation with "The Brady Bunch."
We offered up a few nuggets of explanation,
although I think there is an inexplicable el
ement to our passion. I told Michael of the
soothing and calming effects "The Brady
Bunch" exudes over me. He seemed a
smidge surprised to hear that I had all 117
episodes taped and that I play one every
night as I go to sleep. They relax me and the
familiar voices, wacky and irreverent
music, camp, fashion, life lessons, menu
ideas, soft moments and other such accou
terments are now a part of me.
Ferris told Michael of her /.est to wake up
to the Bradys. They start her day off on a
positive note — sort of like "Good Morning
America," hut without geriatric folk hero
Willard Scott. She further explained how
the Bradys are always there when you need
them. Like just last week it was Ferris' birth
day and it wasn't going so hot, so she put on
the episode where they throw a surprise
birthday party for the tortured, effusive,
frenetic, mental, precocious and spastic Jan
Brady (she deserves every one of those ad
jectives). Within moments, happiness and
love washed over her like a clean gentle
spring rain.
So you may be wondering about this
whole new singing career Maureen
is embarking on. Well, it's pretty
wondrous all right — that she got a record
label to sign her on. Her new CD, "When
You Get A Little Lonely," has been met with
less than ebullient and glowing reviews.
"Universally panned" I think says it best.
But Maureen is not despondent about this
— she just keeps on groovin'. More power
to her. As Carol Brady once said, "Some
times when we lose, we win!"

going to hate us, we have a bunch of stuff
for you to sign." A dazed and delightful
Maureen McCormick looked at me with
curiosity and acquiescence. I might as well
have been wearing a "Hello, my name is
Dork,"sticker, but I didn't care. I wanted to
assure her that I wasn't insane, just lively
(it's a thin line I constantly tread).
She signed my lunch box and then my
friend Ferris' matching one. We gave her a
copy of our zine which features Mike Brady
on the cover, smoking! She signed her CD, a
poster and the record for me. We asked her
whatever happened to Harvey Klinger but
she didn't know. She was impressed that
Ferris traveled all the way to New York City
to see her recent turn as Rizzo in Grease.
I ler daughter, Natalie, age 5, was at her side

the entire time. An adorable moppet with
out question.
I have to admit though, much of my time
spent with Maureen was riddled with
provocative and, well, downright lewd
thoughts. Maureen's eerily vapid, yet
hauntingly alluring voice is pretty power
ful. Her rendition of "Ben" makes me weep
instantly whenever 1 hear it. Hut what kept
echoing through my head were the sexual
ized lyrics she sang in both past and pre
sent.
I cite for you a few lines from the classic
Brady hit, Candy (Sugar Shoppe): "I wanna
take you to my sugar shoppe so come on, I
want to give you all the love I got so come
on. Sipping milkshakes in the hot sun,
c'mon sugardrop and give me some." I'm
sorry, what? Is that "C'mon sugardrop" or
"C'mon sugar, drop" and give me some? It
sounds like milkshakes weren't all they were
sipping if you ask me, but nobody has. Be
sides the obvious promotion of tooth decay,
these sassy lyrics probably lie at the roots of
the PMRC.
Les chansons de Maureen today are
highly charged as well. I've identified
this recurring theme of smut and su
crose in her latest hit, "Might As Well Be
Me." "You're like a kid in a candy store.
Don't know what kind of sugar you're look
ing for and Darlin' it might as well be me."
Proof! So I feel justified in my lurid
thoughts standing next to the sexpot of the
'70s as the lyrics from "I'd Have to Call It
l ove," reverberate through the record store.
"He does me wrong, he does me right. He
does mecrazy in the middle of the night. He
takes me slow, he takes me fast. He takes his
time he knows now to make it last."
After our moment in the spotlight with
the venerable actress / singer / superstar
was over, the stars barely out of our eyes and
my panties in a bunch, we were greeted with
a unique and unexpected opportunity.
Lurking in the outskirts of the whole "meet
Maureen McCormick extravaganza" was a
mysterious gentleman who was somehow
involved in the inner sanctum. We carefully
studied his actions and decided indeed this
was probably her husband so we queried,
"are you Michael Cummings?" (We got his
name from an article I had just read about
Maureen). He was indeed.

We chatted away with Michael for quite a
spell. We told him where to get a good cup
of coffee and he said he wished he had met
us 10 minutes earlier. It was like we were as
thick as thieves. He recounted the tale of
how he didn't even know who Maureen was
when they met and had never seen the
show. And I'm thinking, "He crawled out
from under what rock?" I seriously ques
tioned the reality of this claim, but upon
careful reflection on his career as a comput
er expert, it made perfect sense.
Michael was trying to understand our
compulsive and perhaps borderline psy
chotic fixation with "The Brady Bunch."
We offered up a few nuggets of explanation,
although I think there is an inexplicable el
ement to our passion. I told Michael of the
soothing and calming effects "The Brady
Bunch" exudes over me. He seemed a
smidge surprised to hear that I had all 117
episodes taped and that I play one every
night as I go to sleep. They relax me and the
familiar voices, wacky and irreverent
music, camp, fashion, life lessons, menu
ideas, soft moments and other such accou
terments are now a part of me.
Ferris told Michael of her /.est to wake up
to the Bradys. They start her day off on a
positive note — sort of like "Good Morning
America," hut without geriatric folk hero
Willard Scott. She further explained how
the Bradys are always there when you need
them. Like just last week it was Ferris' birth
day and it wasn't going so hot, so she put on
the episode where they throw a surprise
birthday party for the tortured, effusive,
frenetic, mental, precocious and spastic Jan
Brady (she deserves every one of those ad
jectives). Within moments, happiness and
love washed over her like a clean gentle
spring rain.
So you may be wondering about this
whole new singing career Maureen
is embarking on. Well, it's pretty
wondrous all right — that she got a record
label to sign her on. Her new CD, "When
You Get A Little Lonely," has been met with
less than ebullient and glowing reviews.
"Universally panned" I think says it best.
But Maureen is not despondent about this
— she just keeps on groovin'. More power
to her. As Carol Brady once said, "Some
times when we lose, we win!"
