Sthink I have

enough testosterone to go

death-metal," confesses Home singer
/guitarist Andrew Deutsch. An indie out
cast in the rock and roll wasteland of Tampa,
Ha., I)eutsch seems stuck in the wrong city.
"There's an awful lot of death metal here,"
he says. "A couple times a month there'll be a
big death-metal show.... As far as the (rock)
scene goes, it's not very big. And if you want
to play the kind of music we play, you're real
ly not going to have many people coming to
your shows."
But while most bands would dread
Tampa's musical isolation, Andrew Deutsch,
Eric Morrison, brad Truax and Sean Martin
thrive on it. Free from the constraints of a de
fined "scene," Home's inventive sounds cele
brate the independence gained from being in
the middle of nowhere.
Home's first recordings — "I,""II," "III,"
"IV," "V,"the double-release "VI & VII" and
"VIII" — were released on cassette and sold in
a local Tampa record store. While few of these
early recordings ever made it outside of
Tampa's city limits, Home managed to catch
the attention of Relativity Records, who re
cently released their debut album, "IX," on
compact disc.
Recorded on eight-track in a rented mo
bile home, "IX" offers a reckless onslaught of
sounds and ideas, with its fresh jolts, transi
tions and digressions every bit as engaging as
its sweet melodies. The product of two very
different songwriters, "IX" finds its identity
through its inconsistency.
Naming the Beatles, Sebadoh and David
Bowie as chief influences, I )eutsch consistent
ly delivers smart hooks, clever melody and ad
dictive energy, while Eric Morrison, Home's
other songwriter, explores pop music through
intricate piano arrangements, weird tape
loops and spacey keyboard tricks. Together,
they create solid indie-rock from another di
mension, generating an experimental vibe
that's twisted in the most elegant way.
"1 thought it would be harder for people to
enjoy the difference between the two styles,"
Deutsch says, somewhat insecure about the

in
consisten-

cy of "IX." "I

don't know how easy it is
to listen to a record like that

where there are just so many different
sounding songs."

huge musical differences between
s Deutsch and Morrison emerged fairly re
= cently, Deutsch says, as a result of Morri
son's fascination with the keyboard. "(A few
years ago) you couldn't tell one song from an
other," he says. "Eric got a keyboard about a
year and a half ago, and he just started writing
on it. And when you write on keyboard, it's al
ways a lot different — it's more complicated."
On cuts like "Reprint" and "Freedohm
Rd.," this added complexity is illustrated
through sophisticated patterns, jittery hooks
and sudden changes of direction. This musi
cal unpredictability is fittingly complement
ed by Home's recklessness of personality.
One of the album's more freakish tracks,
"Concepcion" mixes playfully twisted vocals,
squeaky keyboard effects and violently catchy
melody, until the band stops the song, hops
into their van and drives around Tampa for 20
minutes. With the tape recorder running, the
group sings along with the tape deck, talks
about a recent party and ponders whether or
not to stop at Circle K. Apparently, it was
Morrison's decision to put the recording onto
the album.
"I don't know what the hell he was think
ing about," Deutsch says."I guess it's sup
posed to be a slice of the home life or some
thing. I have no idea. I'm sure Eric could give
you a good reason for it."
Ss nother dimension of Home's charm is vi-
SS sual: The songs on "IX" come with corre
sr-ss.sponding drawings, paintings and pho
tographs, which, Deutsch says, "pretty much
represent what the song is about." The pictures

some
how illustrate

each song's mood,
hut they're just as abstract as

the songs themselves, really telling
you nothing of what the songs are about

Hut sometimes the songs do have specific
inspirations and meanings, and Deutsch's
explanations are surprisingly straightfor
ward: " 'Freedohm Rd.' is self-explanatory, I
think. Track two ('Make It Right') is just
about getting a job and stuff. 'My Friend
Maurice' isn't about anything. 'Lost It' is
about drugs.... And I think 'Reprint' is
about daydreaming at work and deciding to
look for a new job."
It's surprising to find such ordinary topics
at the heart of Home's extraordinary works,
but songs like "Reprint" and "Make It Right"
gain an added resonance considering Home's
status as a developing band with an indefinite
future.
Since the band members are busy with
both school and work (Deutsch waits tables,
Morrison does data entry, Martin is a physical
therapist and Truax works at a record store),
Home has very limited time for practicing,
touring and recording. They've only played
live three times this year, and their perfor
mances have been noticeably inconsistent,
Deutsch says.
"The first two were great," he says."And
then we played with Sebadoh, and we were
just the worst we've ever been.... I hadn't
sung in a long time and I usually need to
practice before I try to sing in front of people.
So I couldn't sing and everybody got kind of
disinterested because I sucked so bad. It was

a
disaster. It
was embarrass
ing.

"And I think Sebadoh really
hated us," he adds sadly. "I remember

seeing them in the back of the club not pay-

ing any attention."

now that "IX" has earned them posi
sc tive, widespread attention, does the
plan to quit their jobs to concen
trate full-time on Home?
"1 don't know if 1 do, but 1 think everybody
else might," Deutsch says. "1 think it's a lot of
fun to play and have a record, but it's hard to
make it a career.
"I'll always play music and record and
stuff, but I have diabetes, so I can't go do the
rock and roll lifestyle thing," he adds. "So I
just try and take care of myself, and that un
fortunately means having a responsible job
and lifestyle. That's what I'll be doing regard
less of Home."
Nevertheless, Home's near future is rela
tively secure. They plan to tour the west coast
this August, and they already have a few songs
lined up for a follow-up album — which may
or may not be titled "X."
"I don't know," Deutsch sighs. "Possibly,
but that's a little too Chicago-ish for me."
