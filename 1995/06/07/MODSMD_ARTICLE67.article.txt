# Watt's punk journey Music against the road to fame
## 
### Travis Vigil 
The good-humored man in the frumpled
flannel shirt walks into his own promo
tional party and no one seems to notice.
He could he anyone, hut he's not. Mike Watt
is arguably one of the most influential punk
musicians of the past decade. But who is
Mike Watt?
In the late 70s in the harbor town of San
Pedro, Calif., Watt and his best friend D.
Boon founded the legendary band, the Min
utemen, along with drummer George Hur
ley. This project lasted until 1985 when I).
Boon was killed in a van accident.
At that point, Watt almost quit music al
together. However, a die-hard Minutemen
fan from Ohio, Ed Crawford, showed up on
Watt's doorstep, begging him out of retire
ment. Together, they went on to form the
Minutemen's sequel, fIREHOSE. After 10

years, 6 records and 900 gigs, Watt disbanded
the group because he felt they had stagnated.
Earlier this year, Watt released his first solo
album, "Ball-Hog or Tugboat?," featuring
guest performances by many famous and
not-so-famous musician friends.
it the promotional party, people look past
him hoping to catch a glimpse of one of
the current tour's more famous members,
Dave Grohl or Eddie Vedder. But, they're out
of luck. It's just Watt. Throughout our inter
view, Watt is both friendly and honest, with
combined punk determination and subur
ban practicality underneath his charming
San Pedro drawl.
Though horn in Virginia, Watt grew up in
San Pedro, which served as an incubator for
the Minutemen's revolutionary brand of

punk music.
"(San Pedro) is my homo," Watt
says. "Its something about the security.
My daddy was a sailor, so I moved a lot,
until I was 10. Then my ma said 'no
more moving' and I landed in
Pedro.... Pedro people are loyal. But in
a way culturally they're kinda redneck.
Which in a way was an advantage tor
the Minutemen because it was like a
thermos bottle. We never have to worry
about rippin' off licks because nobody
was doing punk in those days."
Lately though, Mike Watt has been
in the news a lot. Unfortunately, the
media often overlook Watt's innovative
andenerge t i c a Ib u m," Ball-Hog or Tug -
boat?" Often publicity centers around
how this musician of only indie-fame
personally assembled members of Pearl
Jam, Nirvana, Sonic Youth and Di
nosaur Jr. to play on his album. But for
Watt it was just another album and an
other tour.
"It was very easy, man," Watt recalls.
"Everybody was very enthusiastic. You
know they were ready to play. I showed
them the songs. 'Hey what you got? All
right, let's roll the tape.' It was like that.
It was like young boys in the garage, you
know, just going for it."
Considering the cast's variety of
musicians, "Ball-Hog or Tugboat?" is
surprisingly cohesive. Watt made spe
cial efforts'; towards this end.
"I try to make my records like
they're a river," Watt says. "Like Huck
Finn. I always try to make every rccord
like Huck Finn.. .. Like you're on a
journey. And they're not just a collec
tion of songs."
fatt hails from the '70s, but he is
completely anti-nostalgia. Conse
quently, he questions the sincerity
of punk's recent return "Man, 1 was
thinking when I was a kid, a younger
kid, they were giving us 'Happy Days'
and 'American Graffiti,' 'Grease* and I
was going 'Man, this is my dad's music.'
I was just wondering if kids think that
now," Watt explains.
In fact Watt feels that the recent

punk revival is nothing more than a market
ing tool used by record companies to in
crease sales. In classic punk attitude he rebels
against it.
"It's the easiest way to sell something....
Some marketing man's way to make his job
easier, but 1 think my job is to make his job
very difficult."
Watt's independence makes it difficult for
him to fit into the mass marketing designs of
corporate music.
"[Columbia has] a lot to learn," Watt says.
"1 feel really uncomfortable, because where
they're at, we went on for years without
them. They can't really teach me anything. I
think it was lucky punk was little because we
learned to be very self-sufficient. They could
all drop off the earth and I'm still in my van
— 1 don't care Rut, they know the limita

tions of their thing — that they're not that
close to music. They're into packaging."
All this recent publicity is a new thing for
Mike Watt. But even in the limelight, Watt
refuses to bend his principles. Fie speaks
freely about his reviewers and public quib
bles, particularly a conflict with Union Pacil
ic Railroad.
A recent video for the song "Big Train" has
been permanently taken off the air due to a
suit tiled by the train company against direc
tor Spike Jonze, Watt arid Columbia. Watt is
not amused and downright angry about the
whole affair.
"1 mean it's the ballad of Casey Jones
mixed with the Tortoise and the Hare,
Watt says, explaining the video. "There's a
bad Mike Watt; a good M'ke Watt. The bad
one goes too fast, runs people over — dies.
The good Mike Watt takes his time — pre
vails. What the fuck does that have to do with
their company? It's a toy train. We took their
name off, they said they owned the yellow. 1
made it pink, they said they owned the shape.
The fuckers, they're just trying to get
money.... We pulled it off the air, they're
not happy. They're dicks...
In addition to this freak suit, Watt must
also deal with the standard nuisances of bad
reviews and accusations of selling out. One
of the most common — written in a Spin re
view — is that the "Ball-Hog or Tugboat's?
celebrity cast was a publicity stunt to save
Watt's career.
In response Watt says: "[The Spin review
er is] bullshit. For every famous person on
that rccord there's a guy who's not famous.
She's a victim of the same thing she's trying
to accuse me of — celebrity-itis. Why
couldn't she just do a blindfold test and listen
to it?... I lost D. Boon and I don't really care
much about success. I want to make crazy
records. Crazy music."
However, Watt's ultimate attention is al
ways to his fans. When asked if he's an artist
or an entertainer, Watt calls himself a
"fartisSt."
"When I'm playing I looking at the
dudes' faces and I feel re. responsible," he
says. "They work all week u> come sec you
play. I really think the audience is more in
charge than the guy on the stage. The guy on
the stage is swinging from the fences, praying
people like him. Its funny that they've built it
into this religion kind of ritual shit where
everybody prays to the star. The crowd's in
charge.... So I have to work hard for them.
And long after Watt's 15 minutes have
come and gone, he'll still be driving his
van to the next gig or recording the next
record. What will the critics say of his career
then? Well, what would Watt say of it?
"Well, 1 did it to be with EX Boon. It's
weird how punk happened, in '76 right
when we graduated high school. And its
weird to do it without him. But 15 more
years, 24 more tours, they're going to have to
bayonet me to stop. 1 have nothing to lose.
I'm I). Boon's bass player. That's my so
called career."
