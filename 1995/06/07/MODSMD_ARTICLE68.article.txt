# Echoes from the past in contemporary Japanese art
## 
### Jim Luh 
One of the world's great paradoxes,
Hjapan is a nation desperate to es
cape and honor its past. At once a
bustling economic superpower and the
epitome of modernity, its culture is still
rooted in ancient tradition.
That schism of identity is startiinglv evi
dent in "Japanese Art After 1945: Scream
Against the Sky," now at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art and the Center for
the Arts at Yerba Buena Gardens. This first -
ever collaboration between SFMOMA and
the Center for the Arts displays a broad
range of Japanese and Japanese-American
works from 1945 to 1995.
The choice of 1945 is no accident. World
War 11 still haunts Japan as the nation strug
gles to reconcile its status as one of the war's
aggressors and — as evidenced by Hiroshi
ma and Nagasaki one of its casualties.
The horror of nuclear devastation is a re
curring theme, from Tomatsu Shomei's
"11:02 Nagasaki 1 ' series featuring the
scarred faces of Nagasaki survivors to Kudo
Tetsumi's disturbing mixed-media sculp
t u re of a shredded, skeletal mother pushing
a gaudy baby carriage that carries a split
open cocoon encasing a strobe light.
Also showcased is documentation of the
1964 "Shelter Plan Event" by the artistic
group Hi Red Center, which included
artists Nam June Paik and Yoko Ono.
Guests were invited to a luxury hotel where
their bodies were measured for custom
built bomb shelters. Paik's own shelter — a
box covered on all six sides with pho
tographs of the artist taken from the appro
priate angles ~ is on display.
Throughout the exhibition, Japanese art
mirrors, rejects and anticipates similar
trends in familiar European and American
art.
l or example, consider the exhibition's
signature piece, Yoshihara lira's* Red Circle
in BlaCk" (MS. While callnYg to nffiid the
work of period American Minimalists such
as Ellsworth Kelly, it is impossible to view it
merely in those terms: The circle's delicate
imperfection and its striking color give the
piece a distinctly Japanese flavor.
Color also plays an important role in one
of the most visually arresting works:
Kusama Yayoi's "Mirror Room" installa
tion, originally created for the 1993 Venice
Biennial. The room's four yellow walls are
studded with black polka dots. In the center
is a mirrored cube within which a viewer
can see, through a window in the cube's
side, a mirrored room filled with black-

speckled yellow pumpkins.
Works from the Mono-Ha movement in
Japanese art vot&oiu vjewei> wuli theu m
credible physicality. In Endo Toshikatsu's
"lotus IT a giant ring of charred wood jux
taposes the contradictory images of de
struction, life and resurrection. Nearby is
documentation of Kawamata TadashiV
1 9S 7 Document a 8 project, where the artist
surrounded a church with scaffold-like
conglomerations of discarded lumber.
Throughout the exhibition artists strug
gle to adapt Japanese traditions to modern
purposes, perhaps best shown in Masami
Teraokas°Makiki 1 (eights Disaster,* a four
panel screen painted m the old style of
Japanese woodcuts. 1 )ec idedly contempo
rary, it is a comical yet disturbing look at the
AIDS crisis.
Overall, the exhibition is well-organized
— with one exception. Placement in a
lowly-lit comer room makes Hiroshi Sugi
motos already-dark seascape photographs
even more obscure. There is also one inter
ruption, when viewers have to cross fourth
Street to the Center's gallery spaces in the
middle of the exhibition. This second part,
covering Japanese art from 1970 to 1995, is
not to be missed.
The show closes with "Random Acci
dent Memory," an interactive piece which
involves museum-goers and four comput
ers in a project on memory, interpretation
and understanding.
"Don't forget that the post parallels and
surrenders to the current of time," artiste
Okazaki Kenjiro and Tsuda Yoshinori im
plore in a statement of intent for the exhib
it. "Now, in the present, you have the op
portunity to reconstruct your memory."
That challenge is one the Japanese avant
garde grapple with throughout the exhibi
tion, and one that will burden its visitor*
well after they leave.
