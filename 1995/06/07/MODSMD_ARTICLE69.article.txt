# Student film "More Often than Not" a labor of love

For a school without an undergraduate film
program, Stanford plays host to a surpris
ing number of student productions. Stu
dent films run the gamut from the dorm
movies nobody ever sees to ambitious feature
productions.
Unlike its higher profile predecessors such
as "It Came From SLAG" and "Phobia,"
"More Often Than Not" is not just another
Hollywood wannabe. Begun as a project
funded by a URO small grant in the spring of
1994, the film represents the culmination of
research, as well as the physical labor of film
production.
For those who can't put the words "acade
mic" and "movie" in the same sentence with
out gagging, not to worry. "More Often Than
Not" is not a thesis-on-screen. If forced to de
scribe the film's genre, director and writer
Emi Macuaga would call it a "black comedy."
Though originally conceived from research
into sexual and violent subtexts of European
fairy tales, the film evolved into a narrative of
its own, complete with fire juggling and
singing bones.
"People keep asking me if it's a thesis or a
senior project or something, and I have to
keep telling them it's just for fun," Macuaga
said.
While the finished film might seem like a
lot of fun, the production process was cer
tainly more like work for everyone involved.
The cast and crew — made up by a surprising
number of freshmen from Flo Mo due to an
RA-turned-producer — suffered through
pneumonia, this winter's rain, the constant
roar of planes over campus and problems
with unhelpful extras.
"We were trying to film a major scene at a
playground nearby," said leading actress
Chris Levinson, "and there were a lot of kids
around. You know how people are when you
turn on a camera. We ended up with the

sound of little kids screaming chicken chow
mem!' in the background of all our shots."
Student films at Stanford are cooperative
efforts that often become exercises in com
promise and thinking on the fly. Even in pre
production, the film depended upon the
right combination of people and planning.
"I gathered a few of my friends together,"
said Macuaga. "And we met in December and
started planning auditions. One of the pro
ducers supplied the camera and tripod. I
bought a microphone, and I also got some
equipment that had been passed down
through various hands from 'Phobia' and 'Se-

quel,' " another student film never complet
ed. Filming was done on weekends and the
evenings, and some post production was
done at Meyer in between classes and home
work.
As opposed to other possible venues for
student work which spread work and respon
sibility out over a large number of people,
student films are held up by the efforts of only
a few. This is especially true of the creative as-

pects. In addition to being the writer and di
rector, Macuaga is also the editor of the film.
"If you do a play, in the end it's no longer
purely yours," Levinson said. "There are so
many people who touch it, and it gets filtered
though so much bureaucracy. The way Emi
did this, it was her show all the way."
However, to say that the film was made by
only a few ignores the spirit with which all of
the actors and crew worked, without pay, and
with full time academic commitments.
"It is really hard," Levinson said. "The
people who are doing this arc doing it out of
a pure love for film."
