# Chen's pals organize second marrow drive
## 
### Kate Stinger 
After finishing the largest mi
nority bone marrow typing drive
in the country last week, sopho
more Evan Chen's friends are
gearing up for another rally and
drive with the hope of increasing
Chen's chances of finding a donor.
The second drive, targeting
graduate students, community
members and corporate employ
ees, is taking place today in White
Plaza, along with a noon rally to
show support for Chen.
Chen, 20, was diagnosed with a
rare form of leukemia in early
May after a standard blood test at
Cowell Student Health Center.
He was immediately hospitalized.
Sophomore Yul Kwon, Evan's
best friend and roommate, said
last Thursday's drive, during
which 641 people gave blood to be
typed, was the "largest minority
drive ever in this country or any
where." Some students waiting to
register had to leave, he said.
The typing of the marrow sam
ples taken in the first drive has
not yet been completed. According
to Kwon, the process will take an
other week or two.
He offered an explanation for
Thursday's large turnout: "I
think people were thinking it
could be their friend, sister or

brother. People probably thought,
'I could take the time out to help
this guy.' A lot of people want to
help out."
Chen's condition and his
friends' efforts have attracted a
great deal of media interest. Kwon
hopes this week's rally will
achieve national exposure, includ
ing coverage by major television
networks, for Evan's cause.
"If we could have national ex
posure for Evan, that would help
more than anything we could do,"
he said.
Kwon said he hopes that the
national exposure will inspire peo
ple in all regions of the country to
begin their own bone marrow typ
ing drives. He has already contact
ed bone marrow foundations in
Singapore, Taiwan and Hong
Kong.
Kwon urged all students and
potential donors to attend
Wednesday's rally and wear blue
strips of cloth to show support for
Chen. He is in the process of con
tacting student entertainment
groups and possible guest speak
ers for the noon gathering. Kwon
will also read a statement by
Chen.
In addition to the two Stanford
drives, donors have been typed in
cities all over the Bay Area —
including Fremont, Oakland and
Los Altos — for Chen, a native of
Walnut Creek. Tomorrow, there
will be a drive in Redwood Shores,
another on Sunday in Walnut
Creek and one in Mountain View
on June 14.
"At Stanford, most minorities

have been typed," Kwon said.
"We're trying to target other com
munities."
Minorities have a difficult time
finding matching donors. Asian
Americans have a 32 percent
chance of finding a match, while
Caucasians have a 77 percent
chance.
Even if a matching donor is
found, an 80 percent chance exists
that the receiver of the transplant
will reject the donor's bone mar
row.
