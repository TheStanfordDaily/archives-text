# Focus on: Summer Safeway Dining
## 
### Chris Levinson Ty Talbot 
Summer rooles. For the swan song of the
1995 "Grub" installment (Chris never liked
that title), we searched for the real deal Palo
Alto dining experience. However, the truth of
the matter is that, by now, Chris has dined vir
tually everywhere.
So we threw caution to the wind (or some
thing like that) and kicked it on up to the
Sharon Heights Safeway for some fresh pro
duce, assorted breads and other yummy mis
cellany.
What better way to usher in those gods 'o
summer than in the back of a 1981 Chevy LUV
Pick-up? Eating, that i5....
Let's get right to it. We were hoping for
some prepared deli-type items, but apparently
you have to go to the El Camino version of
Safeway if you want that kind of stuff. So we
found ourselves in aisle one amongst the un
cooked sweet meats. "It's raw!" bemoaned
friend T. (hint: look up for real name). Fresh

produce it would have
to be.
What started with
apples ended far be
yond oranges.
D'Anjou pears ($0.36)
and ruby grapefruit
($0.79 each) were
complemented by a
black plum ($0.28)
and a nest of strawber
ries ($1.59). Simply
deeelightful (albeit in
substantial).
As we all know,
bread is the staff of life
(Ty's suggestion: sepa
rate loaves). A wheel of
sourdough ($2.19) for
Ty and a seed-studded
"Le Bout" ($2.29) for

Chris. Mavbc they weren't so thrilled that we
started dinner in aisle three.
Perfect segue: WINE. WINE. WINE. Ours
was a Glen Ellen Chardonnay 1993 ($4.79).
"Was that a good year? 1 mean for you per
sonally?" The bottles at the back of the freezer
row are older vintage, right?

Jose bagged it all and
we were off to the parking
lot. No napkins. No sil
verware. lust the moon,
Sam Cooke on the truck
stereo (runningdown the
car battery), and lots of
good Safeway "grub."
What we didn't expect
were all the dinner guests.
Chris offered to pour
us some vino, but, alas,
no damn corkscrew. We

must have assumed it was a twist-off bottle.
What to do: "Excuse me, do you have a
corkscrew?" Then this big Australian hoss
parks next to us and says, "Don't have one on
me, love, but I'll go and buy you one." Minutes
later we're drinkin' with Theodore.
One glass was enough for Theo (he'd been
drinking Jack Daniel's all day), but just when
the parking lot was starting to get lonely again,
here comes Karen with a suitcase full of tie
dyes. Since the bottle was already in flow, we
offered her a plastic glass. Over a head of butter
lettuce ($0.59) and a jar of Nutella hazel spread
($4.19) she told us all about her evening back
stage with jerry at the Grateful Dead concert,
her four-year-old river-rafting son, and how
much she's down with Nutella.
She left us with a hit of wisdom: You gotta
weigh it all on your little human scale. Rad. She
rooles.
So we danced with Sam to "Having a Party"
and contemplated the finer points of various
peanut butters. Choosy critics choose Jif. And
that was that.... So we'll leave you with one
final piece of advice: Everything tastes better
with Nutella.
As your Dining Diva — it's been a pleasure.
