jic thought the Cannes
JJw M Film Festival was a film
U festival. We were wrong;
film festival is only a small part.
We did notice, however, the inex
plicable association with the letter
"M." As in the response to the ques
tion: "How are you enjoying the fes
tival?" Answer: (non-committal
voice) Mm mm.
Money — more than you can imag
ine. Fifth Avenue with a beach. Alpha
Romeos, Porsches, Stars, legs, tans, little
dogs that accompany their owners to
the cinema, restaurants, etc.

n the second leg of the flight, they sat
M me next to a baby. Cute kid. 12 hours.
Lack of sleep mixing with an over
dose of complementary beverages, I enter
Cannes in a daze. I'm here for the festival
courtesy of Kodak. I give them six of my wak
ing hours each and every day, they give me
my coveted accreditation — my in to the
films in competition.
You figure it out quickly— it's all a game.
A game of who you are, who you know, and
which way is the party. The job isn't so bad,
except for the morning shift and the slight
fact that the interns arc housed a 45-minute
train ride away. Oh, did 1 mention the pass
ing fact that I get to share a room with seven
people? Like 1 said, it's all a game. You want to
be at the festival, you've got to play.
By the third day I'm getting the hang of it.
I've moved into a place in town, shaken the
jet lag and have tickets that night for my first
film. Here's the catch. To get into the coveted
night screenings — everything from John
Boorman's "Beyond Rangoon" to Robert Ro
drigues' "Desperado" (the sequel to his ac
claimed first film "El Mariachi") — you need
two things... a ticket and black tie. Lucky for
me, I brought my tux.
This is how it works. First you get in line.
Everything in Cannes is attached to a line. It's
part of the game. Gives the air of importance.
At a quarter to curtain the line picks up speed
and you find yourself being led towards the
light. The light and the red carpet. If you've
ever seen anything even vaguely referring to

But everyone knows that. What
else? Oh yeah, myth, marke, and
movies.

The Cannes Film Festival began 48
years ago and has since emerged as
the world's pre-eminent film festival.
Everyone who's anyone is here.
Sharon Stone, tacitly recognized as
Cannes queen, has cemented hands
starting the boulevard of the stars (a
la Hollywood), which winds its way
around the Palais de Festivals. This
"palace" houses a casino, a few am
phitheaters and meeting rooms in a

the Cannes Film Festival, you've seen the red
carpet. It leads up the stairs of the Grand
Theatre Lumiere, past the press and the gap
ing fans and into the darkness of the cinema.
This is it. As you're led past the crowd, blind
ed by the incessant snapping and flash there
is one thought that crosses your mind: "I
could get used to this."
It's downhill from there. Yeah, it's cool in
side. The theater is equipped with headsets
that gush forth in all languages not repre
sented on screen — that is, when the system
is working. That first night I watch a three
hour film in Swahili while picking out every
fourth word over my headset which is spew
ing Italian. Truth is, most of the films are dis
appointments. Their selection and place
ment in the running for the coveted Palme
d'Or is a mystery. Point is, the competition is
only the surface. Scratch it and you'll uncov
er the purpose of the festival seething be
neath the Grand Theatre Lumiere and its red
carpet. In the basement thrives the Market —
where films are bought and sold. It's about
money, not film. It's about the game.
I don't mean to bite the hand that feeds.
It's just hard to let go of the glamorous image
I had concocted. Movies are a business, and
in Cannes that business is thriving. There
was networking in the bathroom stalls and
hotel elevators. No end to the game. Case in
point — the hottest ticket in Cannes — the
parties.
Take a hint — don't want it too bad. The
ones who made it apparent that they would

large post- modern heavy-on-the
glossy-windows exterior. The palace,
like all of( Cannes, is tacky to the point
of, well, tackiness.
The myth of Cannes is the French
Riviera, largely ignored until Brigitte
Bardot made it her playground in the
'50s. Since then, tourism has explod
ed with the Riviera as a sign ot
wealth, sun and fun. Recently, the
festival has turned into a media cir
cus — no hotel rooms, overcrowded
beaches and overactive paparazzi
plaguing the sand.
You may not know, but the market
for movies is the festival's hidden
purpose. Rooms and rooms of films
for export and sale. Movies are
arranged by genre, and the largest
markets are porno and action.
Through here Arnold Schwarzeneg
gar reaches the world when a distrib
utor from New Guinea buys the
rights to the Terminator movies.
The what? Oh yeah, the movies. The
28 competing films are judged for the
Palme d'Or, the grand prize. The jury
also awards prizes for best actor, ac
tress, screenplay and director.

live and die for an invite ended up at home
bored and bitter. Remember the game...
there was the premiere screening of Diane
Keaton's "Unstrung Heroes" at the Carlton
Beach. Good pancakes and Andie MacDow
ell smelled terrific — hard not to inhale after
bumping smack into her. The MTV bash,
where my VIP badge ushered me into a room
discreetly partitioned off from the masses for
the likes of Tina Turner, hot and hyper
decked out in red suspenders, David Geffen
and Julian Lennon.
You may question what I was doing sip
ping marguerites with this bunch — so did I.
Second clue: When someone invites you in,
don't ask. Take this bit of advice with an air
of caution. It led me out into the Mediter
ranean to a yacht party thrown by Fresh
Prince Will Smith without an invite. 1 was
given a tour of the lodgings, a bottle of
champagne and shown back to shore, lust
playing the game.
It quickly becomes a joke: bumming
matches from Johnny Depp. Ordering what
the guy to your right is having when that guy
is Harvey Keitel. Where does it all end? If it's
Cannes it ends in an open bar, three dance
floors and sunrise at a castle overlooking the
sea. Glamorous? It just sounds that way.
Word on this festival manages to omit the
crowds wrapped in Hawaiian threads, the
egos that rival small countries, the talk, the
money and the game. The glamour and the
glory of Cannes — blink fast and you might
just miss it.
