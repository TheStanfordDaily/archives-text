# The 						Connes Film Festival
## Playing the game and hoping to win 
### Graphic by Peter Lagerquist 
A sampling of the Cannes Film Festival:
esperado" lives up to expectations of
the second "El Mariachi" film from
Robert Rodriguez. With a Columbia
backed budget of slightly more than the $7,000
with which he made his first film, "Desperado"
becomes a tongue-in-cheek parody of the
south-of -the-border crowd.
Banderas plays El Mariachi, a gun-packing
guitar player with revenge on his mind. Aided by
the humorous Steve Buscemi and beautiful
Lebanese-Mexican bookstore owner Selma
Hayak, Banderas goes on a hunt for his lover's
murderer.

Clearly parodying the action movies we know
and love, the film uses Quentin Tarantino's tech
nique of exaggerated violence as humor. Taran
tino even has a cameo role — and gets his head
blown off to the delight of the audience. Even
Cheech Marin gets into the action.
The only complaint is that Rodriguez suc
cumbs to the same stereotypes he intends to
subvert. The true Mexicans in the film are de
picted as stupid, lazy drug dealers, while the only
good guy is Banderas, obviously of European
origin.
With "Desperado," Banderas' status as a
major sex symbol is assured. However, Banderas

is brilliant as the gun-slinging hero, and that's
not just my hormones talking.
Rodriguez is said to be teaming up with
Tarantino for his next picture.
Get me a ticket!
Sure, 1 thought snobbily, a movie set in
the Parisian equivalent of the inner city.
I come from Chicago, I've seen "Boyz
in the Hood" and "New Jack City." I don't need
a French imitation of them.

But French newcomer Mathieu Kasso
vit/.'s "I.a Haine" — "Hate" in English —
blew me away.
In black and white, the film opens with an
image of the world. A voice-over intones, "a
man fell from a building. With each story, he
said to himself, to reassure himself, 'So far so
good. So far so good.' But he was deceiving
himself. It's not the fall that counts, it's the
landing." Without being preachy, the movie
fully realizes this message.
Set in the Parisian outskirts, the housing
projects are tense following the brutal police
beating of an Arab youth and a subsequent
riot which destroys most of the community's
property. The youth's friends, drug-dealing
Said and overheated Vinz are angry, and we
follow them for 24 hoursof almost- real time.
Two of the three French actors are from
the projects, lending authenticity to the film.
The only drawback is the film's use of ac
cessible French language. Full of immigrant
accents, slang and quick insults, the movie
even includes the use of verslen, a unique
slang where words are reversed: i.e. woman.

"femme," becomes "mef."
However, the film's appeal extends be
yond French audiences. With excellent subti
tles and exposure at Cannes, "La Haine" has
been picked up for American distribution by
Miramax. "Hate" gets my vote for the best
film of the festival.
Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira's
"The Convent" stars John Malkovich and
Catherine Deneuve as an unhappily married
couple who've come to do research on Shake
speare in a Portuguese monastery. Unlike her
husband however, Helene does not believe
Shakespeare is actually of Spanish origin.
From their arrival, the guardian of the
convent is attracted to Helene and gives the
professor (Malkovich) the beautiful but pure
Piedade as an assistant to distract him from
Helene.
Thrown into this pot of plot is a childish
version of Faust, a mythological transforma
tion, a supernatural masturbation scene and
a mysteriously lighted statue. The soup that
forms is so devout as to be boring.
A final problem with "The Convent" is
that, sporting five languages, one has to be a
linguist to understand it.
"When Saturday Comes" is the adorable

first feature-length effort by director Maria
Giese. Set in Sheffield, England, where soccer
is second only to food on life's most-impor
tant list, Jimmy Muir (Scan Bean) has a
dream. He wants to be a footballer.
The odds are against him. His father is an
abusive gambling alcoholic, and Jimmy's job
in the brewery doesn't hold much promise.
Enter Annie (Emily Lloyd), and Jimmy's
dream is renewed. Her uncle gets him a trial
with a semi-pro soccer team, which in turn
gives him the chance to move up to the Divi
sion One Sheffield United team.
In the process, Jimmy must deal with the
death of his brother, the loss of Annie and his
own self-destructive tendencies.
This is a feel-good movie in the tradition
of "Rocky" or "Chariots of Fire." What it
lacks in originality it makes up for in good in
tentions and convincing acting.
Director Giese films the locker room
scenes with so much conviction that it's hard
to imagine that she is an American female.
The film's Sheffield slang dialogue is perfect.
The actors do a valiant job. Lloyd is
adorable as strong Annie, and Peter Postleth
waite is endearing as Jimmy's coach. Sean
Bean also shows great promise.
All in all, "When Saturday Comes" is a
treat original piece by all involved.

"To Vlemma Tou Odyssea" — better
known in English as "Ulysses Gaze" — was
excruciating. An epic film about a cine
matographer who returns to his native
Greece, it lasts upwards of three hours.
However, it's quite interesting, and with
some sharp scissors could be a great film.
Starring Harvey Keitel, the cinematogra
pher is called back to Greece to dispel con
troversy over his latest film. But this is not his
true motive. He is looking for the three un
developed reels of the Manakis brothers, lost
in the Balkan wars.
Yes, he's naked very often in the movie.
Often becoming dream-like, the movie
sees Keitel take on various roles. Alter
nately the Manakis brother sentenced to
death for treason, himself as a boy, as well
as the dead husband of a grief-torn
woman, Keitel makes many friends many
along the way.
Most notably he meets (and sleeps with)
the same woman three times in different car
nations. Here director Theo Angelopoulous
lost me. Is this a symbol for the cinematogra
pher's rediscovery of his roots?
Hopefully, a shortened version will appear
in the U.S. If not, rent it and keep the remote
handy to fast forward.

matographer who returns to his native
Greece, it lasts upwards of three hours.
However, it's quite interesting, and with
some sharp scissors could be a great film.
Starring Harvey Keitel, the cinematogra
pher is called back to Greece to dispel con
troversy over his latest film. But this is not his
true motive. He is looking for the three un
developed reels of the Manakis brothers, lost
in the Balkan wars.
Yes, he's naked very often in the movie.
Often becoming dream-like, the movie
sees Keitel take on various roles. Alter
nately the Manakis brother sentenced to
death for treason, himself as a boy, as well
as the dead husband of a grief-torn
woman, Keitel makes many friends many
along the way.
Most notably he meets (and sleeps with)
the same woman three times in different car
nations. Here director Theo Angelopoulous
lost me. Is this a symbol for the cinematogra
pher's rediscovery of his roots?
Hopefully, a shortened version will appear
in the U.S. If not, rent it and keep the remote
handy to fast forward.
