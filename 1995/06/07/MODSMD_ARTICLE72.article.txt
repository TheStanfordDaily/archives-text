A sampling of the Cannes Film Festival:
esperado" lives up to expectations of
the second "El Mariachi" film from
Robert Rodriguez. With a Columbia
backed budget of slightly more than the $7,000
with which he made his first film, "Desperado"
becomes a tongue-in-cheek parody of the
south-of -the-border crowd.
Banderas plays El Mariachi, a gun-packing
guitar player with revenge on his mind. Aided by
the humorous Steve Buscemi and beautiful
Lebanese-Mexican bookstore owner Selma
Hayak, Banderas goes on a hunt for his lover's
murderer.

Clearly parodying the action movies we know
and love, the film uses Quentin Tarantino's tech
nique of exaggerated violence as humor. Taran
tino even has a cameo role â€” and gets his head
blown off to the delight of the audience. Even
Cheech Marin gets into the action.
The only complaint is that Rodriguez suc
cumbs to the same stereotypes he intends to
subvert. The true Mexicans in the film are de
picted as stupid, lazy drug dealers, while the only
good guy is Banderas, obviously of European
origin.
With "Desperado," Banderas' status as a
major sex symbol is assured. However, Banderas

is brilliant as the gun-slinging hero, and that's
not just my hormones talking.
Rodriguez is said to be teaming up with
Tarantino for his next picture.
Get me a ticket!
Sure, 1 thought snobbily, a movie set in
the Parisian equivalent of the inner city.
I come from Chicago, I've seen "Boyz
in the Hood" and "New Jack City." I don't need
a French imitation of them.
