# Pounding the movie best
## 
### Allison Amend 
arrive Wednesday night. I've missed almost a week, hut I'm exhausted. I have to he up
* M the next morningforthe 8:30 a.m. screening of' Ulysses' Gaze." I receive a yellow press
ยง pass. I look at the poster explaining the hierarchy of passes. Pink, white, red with an
orange dot, red and blue. No yellow. "Excuse me," 1 say in French, "what color is my pass?"
The woman behind the desk looks at me and says, with a completely straight face, in Eng
lish, "It's yellow."
"Yes, thank you, I can see colors, hut what level is it?"
The lowest of the low. I am assured only entrance to the 8:30 a.m. screening. Have you
ever seen a movie at 8:30 a.m.? Have you ever seen a I larvey Keitel movie in Baltic languages
that lasts over three hours at 8:30 a.m.? I don't recommend it.
I meet Josh Davis for lunch. Josh is a Stanford student by day, the next generation of Davis
/ Panzer Productions by night.
At the Majestic, we discuss the time Sean Connery made a pass at someone's wife. People
come and go; I'm invited to a cocktail party that night. I drink several glasses of wine and
champagne; someone buys me lunch. Josh disappears. I soak up conversation like wine,
wine like water.
I meet a director and a producer. They invite me to their film, "When Saturday Comes."
I go to the cocktail party, drink more wine and meet a dreamy assistant editor with an Eng
lish accent and a pony tail.
I hit the 10:30 showing of "The Convent" and call it a day. Things are slightly fuzzy any
way.
On Thursday, I hit "The Convent" press conference; John Malkovich and Catherine
Deneuve arc there.
I learn three things about press conferences: Journalists are infinitely more intelligent and
articulate than actors and directors. Actors and directors will try their hardest to evade ques
tions and answer insightful ones with a "yes" or "no." And everyone in the world has a star
complex. Even 1 try to ask a question so Malkovich will look at me. I don't get called on.
The weather is getting darker and windier, naked people are still on the beach, and my
friends arrive in Cannes.
At dinner, the restaurant gets more and more crowded. We realize we are in the middle of
a party for the movie "Danger Zone." The only interesting people are Tony Curtis and the
Tropicana Girls.
I hit the 12:30 a.m. screening of "Desperado" by Robert Rodriguez. I see Antonio Ban
deras; his car practically drives over my toes. 1 am in love.
Friday, 1 skip the 8:30 am showing of the three hour and 12 minutes of "Underground"
in Serbo-Croatian. Can you blame me?
So, I go to the "Desperado" press conference. Antonio is so close; if I can just ask about
the representation of Latinos in the movie, he will be dazzled by my Spanish and ask me out
in front of everybody. I don't get called on.
I go to the "Ed Wood" press conference. Three journalists ask Johnny Depp if he likes to
dress in women's clothing, or to try on Kate Moss' clothing. As if anyone but Kate can wear
size two. If I can just ask my question on the use of black and white stock in "Ed Wood," he
will be dazzled by my beauty and ask me out in front of everybody. I don't get called on.
I see "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain." I take a nap,
eat potato chips and cheese for dinner, and go to the 10:30 showing of "Dead Man."
At the 8:30 a.m. screening of "Hate" (I'm up early, applause, applause...), followed by the
press conference, I think if I can ask about the contrast with American inner cities, they will
be dazzled by my amazing French and... never mind, 1 put my hand back down.
I finally ask my question at the "Dead Man" press conference about the script's similari
ty to the novel "Pedro Paramo," the possibility of afterlife in the movieand the notion of spir
ituality it brings to the script. Live on television, I take the microphone and say, "Allison
Amend, from The Stanford Daily and I have a question for Jim (Jarmusch) and Johnny
(Depp)." Depp doesn't ask me out.
I hang out at the Majestic and drink more champagne. At the press conference for"The
Englishman...," 1 ask a question about the place of feel-good comedies amidst extremely vi
olent films. Hugh Grant does not ask me out.
So, that was Cannes. Celebrity sightings included Willem Dafoe, Roger Ebert, Carole
Bouquet, Lara Flynn Boyle, Olivier Martinez, Naomi Campbell, the Edge and various what -
was-that-guy's-name-agains.
Best quote: John Malkovich, "1 hope the devil exists. If he doesn't, I don't have much of
a career."
Worst quote: Jim Jarmusch, "I'm not quite sure exactly what the philosophy in 'Dead
Man' is. Johnny can tell you what the film's about." Johnny Depp, "Is this about mgora?"
Best film: "Desperado."
Worst film: "Dead Man."
Best part of the festival: The free champagne.
Worst part of the festival: Where do I start?
Did I have fun? Mmmm.
Am I going back next year? Hell, yeah.
