# A 						dancing tune: Tommy's new Broadway musical
## 
### Linda Friedlieb 
new musical
mm fore it hits San Fran
cisco, we have to wonder about the decision
making abilities of its producers. Fortunate
ly, seeing "Buskers" — formerly billed as
"Stage Door Charley" and "Busker Alley" —
lays most of our doubts to rest.
"Buskers" is Tommy Tune's latest Broad
way-bound musical, a look at the street per
formers who entertained outside London's
theaters in the pre-World War II era. Long
legged Tune, a nine-time Tony Award win
ner, dances through the old-fashioned mu
sical with aplomb, confidence and style.
Tune plays "busker" Charley Baxter, a
song-and-dance man whose profession
stems from his genes. He started out busk
ing with his alcoholic dad as a child, and is
doing just tine until he meets young Libby
(Darcie Roberts) — a talented orphan look
ing to make her way up in the world. They
partner up professionally, and later person
ally, until Libby gets the big break that will
take her inside the theater, if not to happi
ness.
Clearly, "Buskers" has more of a plot,
thanks to writer A.J. Carothers and com
posers/lyricists Richard M. and Robert B.
Sherman, than Tune's last Broadway baby,
"Grand Hotel." However, the show some
times has a tendency to lapse into an over
whelming dance marathon, as seen in the un
fortunately never-ending number "Tap
'Appy Feet."
Sometimes, it's just a case of too much of
a good thing.
For the most part, the dancing is phenom
enal, the clear highlight of the show. Director
and choreographer Jeff Calhoun (the current
revival of "Grease!") uses a chorus of identi
cally clad buskers with aplomb — as Baxter's
shadow, echo, conscience, subconscious and
mirror.
Special rewards and a standing ovation for

extra strength go to the unnamed busker who
spent much of his time on stage singing up
side down while hanging from light posts.
A true contrast exists in story and produc
tion between the seasoned performer
(Charley / Tune) and the rising star new
comer (Libby / Roberts). Tune is masterful,
unfailingly precise with every note and step
while Roberts occasionally plays too much to
the audience rather than her companions
on-stage. Still, her strong voice and dancing
talent mark her as a future Broadway con
tender.
Despite the strong pair leading the show,
scenes are frequently stolen by two humor
ous cast members — Gladys and Mate. Mar
cia Lewis is priceless as Gladys, the dumpy fe
male busker singing the "Hula Love Song" in
long sleeves and a fake grass skirt. Sarcastic
yet endearing, this not-so-Polynesian
Princess starts out determined to be alone
but finally yields to her lovesick fellow busker
Arthur (Robert Nichols).
Mate is Gladys' dog, a marionette with the
stage name Taffy. Under the tutelage of Philip
Huber, Mate comes alive — wagging his
rump, looking exasperated, going to the
bathroom, subtly commenting on the hu
mans' foibles and mistakes.
Comedy is a big part of the show. A fa
vorite laugh-puller comes toward the end
when ego-laden alcoholic theatre actor Vic
tor Duchesi (played as a perfectly stuffed
board by Brent Barrett) exclaims to his co
horts: "Wait. I have a thought!" Producer
Max Beardsley (Drew Fliot) promptly replies
with great shock, "Good heavens!"
Despite the talent going into "Buskers,"
the production lacks the tightness and finesse
that belongs in a finished Broadway product.
The first act is long, with several seemingly
unnecessary or overly drawn-out reprises
and dance scenes.
The second act is a trifle confusing, as it
launches into what we presume is a fantasy

dance between Charley and Libby. We aren't
sure if they're back together, in a dream or
just entertaining us, and the mystery is never
fully cleared up.
11 this means is that
"Buskers" is hopefully still
growing and changing into a
refreshingly old-fashioned musical (in the
tradition of Rodgcrs and Hammerstein,
Steven Sondheim, et al.) as it heads to an
arena that has recently been musically
dominated by Andrew Lloyd Webber pro
ductions and the heart-wrenching "Les
Miserables."
Different, although perhaps not better,
"Buskers" is a brand new nostalgia trip.
