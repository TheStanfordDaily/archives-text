# Life in the Dead gone
## Experiencing the cult of the concert 
### Julie Cantor 
he ever-touring Grateful Dead trucked
into town last Friday. And thousands
Deadheads, wannabes, and I'm
not-a-Deadhead-I-just-like-the-Dead-heads
descended to the music, like little ants making
a beeline to water.
Friday's show was my second. I'm obvi
ously a Dead neophyte, missing the bootlegs
of early '70s shows at the Warfield. Hut even
without Deadhead status, you can still enjoy
the show.
Half the experience is the parking lot. And
it's not about parking. It's a square of asphlat
teeming with activity where laws of society
don't apply. No tax with purchase, nudity al
lowed, drugs encouraged. Sparkling with
chaos.
I arrived early so I could really do the lot.
Weaving between cars, down aisles, to check
out the wares at the make-shift booths in the
back of banged-up vans turned mobile
homes, complete with bed, stove, and new
born babe. Fans with tattered tecs, reminis
cent of another era, offered everything from
pro-marijuana stickers to patches ot those
technicolored dancing bears as 1 walked by.
And veggie dumplings, veggie falafels, veggie
spaghetti and veggie brownies with some spe
cial plant extract to enrich the concert experi
ence.
Hopeful concert-goers rolled through the
crowd, holding one finger up and draping
that tired arm over their head, asking "Who's
got my miracle today?" A free ticket to see
jerry is miracle material. I listened closely,
with my supersonic hearing, to pick up the
subtle cues of folks selling pot or asking for
"shrooms," whispering under the din of the

crowd. So sly.
And everywhere, babies and puppies. Tons
of 'em. As it' they're the one doing the multi
plying.
Did 1 mention there's lots and lots of hair?

Matted hair, hair under knitted caps,

hairy puppies, hair with twigs,
hairy lees of all kinds. A hair

extravaganza.
One more note on

the parking lot
scene: a ton of a

people don't
even come into j
M

the show.
They just stay
in the lot and J

listen to the
music play,
soaking it all

in.
1 actually 1
did the con- 1
cert. Very

cool. Excellent "
music. Great
improvisation. I

got hit in the head
with a flying tor

tilla and a marshmal-
low before the show

started. As expected.
Jerry still looks wild — just

a pair of glasses peering out under-

r o i c_7
neath mounds of hair. His kids probably
came out at birth with glasses, poofy gray hai,
and a beard, to boot.
During the pregnant lulls between songs, I
saw Jerry waiting for inspiration, for a vision
or something to travel down from the top of
Shoreline. The band waited for it to come
down too. but I'm sure the folks in front of
me tripping out on acid could see the vision

before it hit the stage.
Since they didn't play "Touch of Grey" in
the first set, they wouldn't play it all. So I was
a little bummed. 1 lad to eat tor consolation.
On my way to get fries, 1 ran into the spin-

ners — a shoeless, folksy group with

Amish-like clothing winding

themselves up slowly and

turning, turning,
. turning into a flat-

out spin. 1 hey
i spin for the en-

tire concert
i and get

miffed it
i you stop

their spin.
Suppos
edly, they
never
miss a

show.
It's all
fantasy, a

b throwback
' to the rau
cous '60s,

7 with cross
generational ap
i r . i

" peal tor tne young
kid types, and the die

hards who've been fol-

lowing the Dead for all

eternity. It's a world of consider

ation and niceness, people who say sorry if
they bang into you from the rush of the
crowd, people who seem like they'd let you
stay on their floor tonight, even if you
wouldn't do the same. You really should go
sometime.
Just keep in mind that it's not the place to
bring your I'owerHook hoping to get work
done between sets. Wrong call there.

On the way back to the car, we passed a
Disco Bus, complete with sparkly ball and
speakers blasting that YMCA song. Had to
pass it up though, and after mulling around,
we finally found the car near the port-a-pot
ties.
Just as we were pulling out, just when you
thought you'd seen it all, a random glassy
eyed girl with filthy socks hopped into the car
and onto my lap. She was quick, as if she had
practiced. And she told us to take her to Port -
land. We declined. OK, then San Francisco,
she gurgled, as if it was a big compromise on
her part. We had no clue who she was. I told
her the car behind us might be heading her
way, she scrunched up her face and bounced
out. Hope she ended up safe and sound in
Portland. Got to watch the chemical combi
nations sometimes.
Kind of makes you think that The Dead is
right on when they sing, "What a long strange
trip its been."
You never can tell what you're going to
find. And that's the great part about the
shows, what keeps people coming back, show
after show, partly for all that atmosphere, and
partly to hear the song that they haven't
played since 1983 that they might, just might,
bust out tonight. A magical experience,
something wildly different. Even without the
organic compounds.
There's a pull that makes you want to hitch
that ride to the next concert, eschew bour
geois comforts and sell veggie burritos after
the show.
Nearly pushed me to pack the duffle, break
in the Birks, and scrounge up a dime or two
just for the chance to see Jerry one more time.
Tell my mom it's a no go on graduation.
If you get a chance to go to a show, go. Def
initely. Get past the fear that everyone's weird
and strung out. Even if they are. Give it a try.
I'm sure they'll be back for you soon.
