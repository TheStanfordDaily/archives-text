## Mike Noren CHRIS KNOX Songs of You & Me 
### 
"Oh me, my celebrity gets me in all
kinds of poo," frantically sings part-time
Tall Dwarf Chris Knox, and it's easy to see
why. Possibly New Zealand's busiest rock
and roller, Knox balances his always
fruitful music career with separate careers
as a prominent New Zealand comic strip
artist and televised movie critic. Still,
Knox finds time to make enjoyable solo
albums on a regular basis, and he shows
no signs of slowing down.
Knox's latest, "Songs of You & Me," is
divided into two sub-albums: The first
half, titled "Hanging Out for Time to
Cure Birth," features the "songs of you,"
while the second, "A Stranger's Iron
Shore," features the "songs of me." To
gether they form a 21 -songepic, well over
an hour's worth of Knox's quirky, folky
songcraft.
Most of "Songs of You & Me" sticks to
the same basic formula that has worked
for Knox's previous solo efforts. Knox
makes weird, homemade pop nuggets,
marked by modestly buzzing guitars,

oddball instruments
and cheap drum ma
chines that seem to
be going too fast for

the music. With lyrics that range from
achingly pretty to hilariously twisted,
Knox achieves a memorable emotional
impact that varies from song to song.
In the triumphant rampage of "Shrap
nel," Knox gives us the kiwi equivalent of
Pink Floyd's "One of My Turns," singing:
"I'm gonna push, I'm gonna shove, I'm
gonna fuck your god above, till you ex
plode in shrapnelled flesh and disappear."
The song builds humor and intensity with
each twisted verse, as Knox's honest rage
is mixed with the gloomy wit that has be
come his trademark.
Unfortunately, some of the imagina
tive pop on "Songs of You and Me" should
never have left Knox's imagination. Songs
like the embarrassingly melodramatic
"Young Female Caucasian" or the just
plain annoying "Mirror Mirror" detract
from the flow of the album.
Hut despite all the riff-raff, it's still hard
say anything bad about an album that has
over a dozen great songs. "Songs of You
and Me" is a thoroughly entertaining re
lease, though it would have benefited
from a little self-editing, if Knox had only
had the time.
