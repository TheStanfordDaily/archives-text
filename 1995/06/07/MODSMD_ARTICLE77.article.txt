# SIXTEEN DELUXE

By all accounts, Austin, Texas, is as thriv
ing and vibrant a rock and roll city as there is
on the road map — as urban legend has it,
the Lone Star State capital is the live music
capital of the world. But try and think of an
Austin band and it begins to seem like a huge
scene without its own. Then try again. It's
safe to say that no group from Austin has
made an impact on Alternative Nation since
... well, since there has been an Alternative
Nation.
Depending on the historical context, Six
teen Deluxe is either Austin's latest or first
prospect for a modest level of popularity.
Even before recordinga thing, the band made
an impact on its home crowd that few native
hopefuls had before them. According to one
Austin critic type, "it only took me four min
utes of their four set [opening for Stereolab]
for me to fall in love" with Sixteen Deluxe.
What's more, the buzz over the fledgling
quartet's first seven-inch "Idea" has spread,
leaving the singles guy at Spin writing that it
was the best indie thing he had heard in a
while.
The group's new LP "Backfeedmagnet
babe" will likely attract more of the same:
The debut is a well-assembled, ambitious
slab of noise-pop mayhem, precise yet sloppy
yet pretty. Although they're most often com
pared to Brit shoegazers My Bloody Valen
tine, Sixteen Deluxe find more suitable paral
lels to Amerindie heroes — The quick learn
ers are, say, a sloppier Swirlies or a scruffier
"Copacetic"-era Velocity Girl. Sure, the Tex
ans drone and drone, but they do it with
punk energy rather than pale-faced intensity.
And like its standout State-side counter
parts, Sixteen Deluxe keeps things interesting
by changing the tone of the hazy mood.
"Idea" is a good place to start; it's the album's
earcatchingiest song, jumpy with its ultra
catchy guitar refrain and the muted yet lively
voice of girl guitarist/singer Carrie Clark.
Next, boy guitarist/singer Chris Smith
croons indistinguishably to the atmospheric
sparkle of "Floor 13." Then the brash pop of
"Baby Headrush" picks up the pace again,
only to give way to the drifting blare on
"Apron Strings." "Fetus" is a five-minute gui
tar drama that shows off all the band's dy
namic tricks, from the solid crunch at the be
ginning and end through the wrenching
melody in between.
So maybe the bright young thing won't be
able to turn around Austin's fortunes single
handedly. But Sixteen Deluxe is well on its
way to making a name for itself.
