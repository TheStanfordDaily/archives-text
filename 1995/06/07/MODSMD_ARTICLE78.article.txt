# ELLIS AND WYNTON MARSALIS
## Joe Cool's Blues 
### 
It all started five years ago. Around the
time when Charles M. Schultz (the highest

paid entertainer in America) landed the "Get
Met. It pays" advertising contract. It seemed
that everyone was ready to jump on that not
so funny Peanuts wagon.
In 1990 the first Peanuts gang album came
out. Then a couple of years later, Dave
Brubeck composed "Quiet as the Moon,"
music for a Charlie Brown and Company
television special. Now, Snoopy has his own
album, "Joe Cool's Blues," created by none
other than the world famous father and son
duo, Ellis and Wynton Marsalis.
But how can one be cynical when dis
cussing good ol' Good Grief? "Joe Cool's
Blues" has a split personality. One third of the
tracks are performed by the Wynton Marsalis
Septet, and the remainder by the Ellis
Marsalis Trio. Wynton's crew performs all
originals, with the exception of the ever-fa
miliar "Linus and Lucy," and Ellis and com
pany perform all Vince Guaraldi composi
tions.
Of Wynton's pieces, "On Peanuts Play
ground" perhaps best captures the feel of the
good old gang. Cumbersome in feel, this
piece gives the impression of what it must be
like to be balloon-headed Chuck on a slide,
just out of place enough to have a depressing
ly good time.
"Wright Brothers Rag" continues with the
playful theme, but fails by being too ridicu
lous. "Little Red-Haired Girl," on the other
hand, provides appropriate sentimentality of
distanced admiration with the joviality of
puppy love. "Snoopy and Woodstock" is also
good, and clearly one of the most creative
tracks on the album. It is here that Wynton is
in his element, playing in a style that frees it
self from the sometimes restrictive presence
of the album's theme. The horn work, as ex
pected, is phenomenal â€” bluesy and full of a
mocking arrogance.
Disappointingly, the most enjoyable
tracks are the ones you have heard before, the
Peanuts classics like "Oh, Good Grief!," "Pep
permint Patty" and "Charlie Brown." Even if
you don't recognize the titles, you will recog
nize the music, and enjoy it.
