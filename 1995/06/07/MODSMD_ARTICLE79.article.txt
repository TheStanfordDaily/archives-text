# ONCE UPON A TIME
## Once Upon a Time 
### 
In the musical world, it is often too easy to
settle for the mediocre over the exceptional.
Because average music rarely sounds un
pleasant, many listeners accept it without
much thought.
The truth is that while it is not hard to
make pleasing music, making music which
"matters" is extremely difficult. This is exact
ly what makes the giants of popular music of
the past century (Armstrong, Ellington, B. B.
King, The Beatles, Dylan, Springsteen, etc.)
so exceptional.
This distinction is just the problem with
Once Upon A Time's new, self-titled album.
Nothing is inherently wrong with the album.
The melodies are catchy, the sound can be in
triguing, the rhythms are developed, and the
musicianship is better than average.
The problem is that there is little within
the album which "clicks" — nothing which
jumps out and pulls in the listener helplessly.
All of the tracks are essentially forgettable,
and the album lacks the cohesiveness which
defines the best music.
If nothing else, "Once Upon A Time"
proves that formulaic "alternative" music is
entirely possible.
The lead singer, Elia Bel, does do some in
teresting work. An odd cross between

Madonna and Geddy Lee (of Rush), Bel has a
few compelling moments, most notably on
"Espiritu Libre." Because the song is written
in Spanish, her delivery is helped by the lan -
guage's natural lyricism.
Singing in English for the rest of album,
Bel does a sufficient job, as long as the lyrics
are not noticeably trite and embarrassing.
Too often the lyricists settle for low-brow
philosophizing and the pretentiousness
common to many young artists. On "God,"
Bel sings "God is who you want him to be."
What a fascinating insight...
The band's musicianship has it's mo
ments. On "Marry Me," for example, they lay
down crunchy rhythms and rolling guitar
lines which work quite well. More often than
not, however, the band sounds fragmented.
Accordingly, the liner notes reveal that they
used four different bass players for just eleven
tracks.
Not a bad album in any way, "Once Upon
A Time" is proof that listeners should always
remember to be discriminating. Why settle
for a mediocre album when one could buy a
brilliant one?
