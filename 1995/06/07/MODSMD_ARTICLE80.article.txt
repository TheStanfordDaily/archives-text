## KING CRIMSON THRAK 
### 
Unlike contemporary prog-rock brethren
Pink Floyd, Genesis and Yes, who drift
melodically towards the kind of saccharine
pop they once abhorred, King Crimson con
tinues to produce the edgy and unpredictable
music that established it as the best of the
seventies progressive rock groups.
"THRAK," the band's first album in 11 years
(and its first good album in two decades),
shows King Crimson in top form, integrating
complex and innovative musical ideas into

the context of a hard rock band.
Gone, however, arc the long instrumental
passages, the tension and release of earlier al
bums. Instead, "THRAK" is characterized by
its impatience. But this impatience is not al
together unwelcome, for it reflects the kind of
raw energy that was sorely lacking in Crim
son's trio of lifeless albums in the early '80s.
The album opens with "VROOOM" and
ends with "VROOOM VROOOM" and
"VROOOM VROOOM: Coda." These in
strumental mini-epics, vaguely reminiscent
of 1974's classic "Red," manage to combine
all of the traditional Crimson elements while
still sounding fresh. "Dinosaur" starts in a
fairly conventional way, trading verses and
chorus with nary a change in time signature.
The distinctive King Crimson signature soon
emerges, however, as the song breaks for a bit
of orchestral fun, courtesy of the newly-hip
Mellotron. And although the drumming on
"THRAK" is often too busy, "B'Boom," with
its swirling polyrhythms, provides the band
with a pleasant justification for its two drum
mers.
The catchiest tune of the lot is "Sex Sleep
Eat Drink Dream," which alternates between
the sparse guitar funk chorus and the chaot
ic, almost industrial verses. With Adrian
Belew screaming his distorted vocals, the
track achieves the kind of frenetic energy fans
have been missing.
"THRAK V only weakness can be heard in
"Walking on Air," "People" and "One Time,"
marked as clearly by Belew's oft-derided
"pop sensibilities" as "VROOOM" is marked
by Robert Fripp's guitar. On "People,"
Belew's Lennon-esque voice (which, though
pleasant, works better on the growling cho
rus of "Dinosaur") spews embarrassments
like "people are the main spring / turning the
world around / people, they're the main
spring / spinning this world upside down,"
reminding the listener that King Crimson has
never been about the lyrics.
Surely, Crimson can be forgiven these
duds, for "THRAK" represents a return to

the form that made King Crimson one of the
best and most influential progressive rock
hands.
