# TEENAGE FANCLUB
## Grand Prix 
### 
Say "Mellow Doubt" — the name of
Teenage Fanclub's new single — in any possi
ble way, and it always comes out as "mel
lowed out." And mellowed out might be a
more appropriate title for the acoustic ditty,
since the unpluggish number finds guitarist /
singer Norman Blake lovelorn and pensive as
he sings with a sparse accompaniment rather
than the quartet's signature pretty-side-of
grunge stuff.
Indeed, this mellowing out seems to be the
theme to the band's latest album, "Grand
Prix." Which might leave even the most fer
vent Teenage Fannies with their own mellow
doubts: The LP heads in a more refined di
rection instrumentally to mixed results, de
parting from the warm, fuzzy wall of guitar
near-perfected by the Glasgow, Scotland
group on earlier efforts.
So though better proficiency is gained in
the group's growth, some of the fresh exuber
ance that made 1991 's "Bandwagonesque"
the pop gem and 1993's "Thirteen" a worthy
successor gets buried by "Grand Prix's" crisp,
shiny clean production. For instance, the
sterile twinkle and big word refrain of
"Verisimilitude" and the half-baked piano
strings-horns of "Tears" come off re
spectably, but with little charm or personali
ty. No amount of explaining can redeem "I'll
Make It Clear," with its hackneyed "it's me for
you/and you for me" lyric and its misguided
Scots-try-to-funk interlude.
Still, Teenage Fanclub's nice guy sincerity
and irrepressible pop sensibility can't help
but break out to make "Grand Prix" a likable,
pleasant work more often than not. The
album's best selections combine nature and
nurture, sounding mature and a bit peppy at
the same time. "Neil lung," with its big gui
tars and perfect pitch, follows in the pure pop
lineage of "The Concept," TFC's would
be / shoulda-been hit off "Bandwag
onesque." This time, bassist / singer Gerard
Love conjures up the most distinctive tunes
of the bunch: "Sparky's Dream" twangs in all
the right places and "Don't Look Back"
switches speeds and moods effortlessly.
Love's "Discolite" is a good mark of the
band's progress in its balance between careful
clarity and spunky exuberance. It helps to
wipe away some lingering doubts about
Teenage Fanclub. Not all of them, but having
doubts also means that there's something
that's worth the effort.
