## Yuen Ping Low ABOUT TIME: STANFORD'S LONG AWAITED FILM SOCIETY 
### 
Almost two years ago, upon arriving at
Stanford University, I pried open the
massive campus directory with a single
minded sense of anticipation. Several hours
of shattering disbelief later, I finally stopped
thumbing through the pages and had grave
trouble swallowing the cold, hard fact....
Despite being endowed with its very own
linear accelerator facilities, Stanford was ac
tually devoid of a student film society!
There are nearly a do/en a cappclla out
fits, but no organized consumption of cellu
loid — other than a chance on Sunday
nights to brighten up Mem Ami's interior
space with streamers of toilet paper. And
who can blame us? All that ASSU Sunday
Flicks offers its captive congregation of frus
trated cinephiles-turned-litterbugs are little
more than commonplace second-runs that
have outlived their box-office viability at
nearby multiplexes.
brown University students, whose heads
turn giddy at the five-features-a-week

schedule put up by their film society
throughout the academic year, probably
take for granted a campus tradition that
dates further back than the origins of many
colleges in America. The University of
Chicago founded the very first varsity in
house film society in the country — possi
bly the world — not long after the medium
became a bona fide form of mass entertain
ment.
Let's face it, film theory and cultural
studies are today's hippest catch-phrases up
the ivory tower. Growing numbers of grad
uate students from Comparative l iterature
and other humanitarian disciplines are
turning away from the traditional written
word to carve new meaning in this 20th
century paradigm of sight and sound. The
visionary philosopher Walter Benjamin
heralded film as a composite canvas — one
that explodes pre-modern, elitist confines of
monolithic aura by ushering in a mechani
cal age of accessible, multi-textured art for

one and all.
Besides, quality cinema promises to un
leash effects that transcend its academic fa
cade. Recall all those Woody Allen charac
ters who typically encounter each other in
pitch darkness, as avant garde images ot
non-linear surrealism flicker past them on
makeshift lecture-theater screens?
Clearly, college film societies serve as
more than introductions to the Bunuelian
aesthetic, when it comes to classroom grati
fication — in the purest sense of the word of
course.
A friend who went to Berkeley some
years ago confided in me: "I don't even re
member the title of the class I took in film
history, hut I sure will never lorget our
mandatory Saturday midnight romps at
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.' "
All things considered, what occasion,
Dther than these silver-tinted college years,
;ould possibly be more intimate or afford
able, for acquainting oneself with the likes

of Godzilla and Go
dard.

Yuen Ping Low hereby congratulates the 1V95
Robert L. Pierce Memorial Award recipient
Jonathan Levitt for winning a grant to estab
lish the Stanford Film Society. If only for the
far-fetched scenario that someday, tongue
trippers like "Krzyzstof Kieslowski" anil
"Wong Kar-wai" might actually hobble their
way into the Stanford vocabulary to take their
place alongside "Dumb and Dumber IV —
How Loud Can lim Carrey Fart?"
