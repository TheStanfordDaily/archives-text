# NOT MUCH MEAT ON CHELSOM'S OFF-BEAT COMEDY 'FUNNY BONES'
## 
### 
Released quietly by Hollywood Pictures to
be brutally trampled under the feet of summer
blockbusters, Peter Chelsom's "Funny Bones"
slides into the off-beat comedy section of the
video store — but out of a mix of strange set
tings, oddball characters and wierd relics
there lacks a cohesive story to hold everything
together, and very few laughs to be found

along the way.
Writer-di
rector Chel
som, who at
tracted atten
tion for his

& Funny Bones

off-the-wall bent in "Hear My Song," clearly
relishes quirky details, pouring loving atten
tion over the comic side of freaks, mutes and
grotesquerie. But the film's uneven direction
fails to live up to its potential as an energetic
and frothy farce, a genre typified by down
under flicks such as "The Adventures of
Priscilla" and "Strictly Ballroom."
Jerry Lewis, who is still in top form, essen
tially plays himself as George Fawkes, a Vegas
stand-up immortal, whose son, Tommy,
played by a fleshy Oliver Piatt, cringes under

his father's long shadow as he seeks to forge his
own comedic career.
After bombing in Las Vegas, Tommy goes
into hiding and decides to mine for comic ma
terial at Blackpool — a once burgeoning car
nival town on the British coast and kind of Las
Vegas to 19th century English sheepshearers
(no joke). There he purchases acts from local
weirdoes and freaks.
From this unusual and promising start
Chelsom tacks on a string of plot devices:
magical Chinese eggs that putativcly bestow
immortal pep, two aged, down-on-their
luck vaudevillians, French smugglers, an old
torch song crooner, and a mostly mute
comic genius (Lee Evans). But rather than
Filling the story out, the elements collapse
into an incoherent mess that spins wildly
from one surprisingly unfunny subplot to
another and allows characters to enter and
exit inexplicably.
The main problem is that the film's initial
premise — Tommy's desperate desire to repli
cate his father's comic genius — vanishes
somewhere after the first half-hour of the film.
At this point "Funny Bones" careens into a

long, humorless subplot dealing with family
skeletons.
Much of the film's comedic and action
sequences, especially those involving
Evans, who has a commanding presence
and makes an exciting debut, start promis
ingly, but as a whole they tend to drag, as if
Chelsom realizes that the next funny beat
will be long in coming and wants to prolong

the moment.
Claiming that "Funny Bones" represents
the last of three semi-autobiographical films
dealing with his hometown of Blackpool,
Chelsom hopefully will find projects that,
when matched with his eye for offbeat mater
ial, will bring him to newer and more solidi
fied stories.
