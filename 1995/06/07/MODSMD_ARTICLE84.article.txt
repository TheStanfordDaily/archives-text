Crumb
Sporting emphatically round
rimmed glasses, a perpetually
sunken chest, combed-back hair and
an untrimmed mustache that together
approximate a clown's mask, Robert
Crumb redefines the notion of the
renegade comic artist as human
freak-show.
Dwelling on the explosive subject
matter, however, that screams to be
sensationalized, "Crumb" turns out to
be a documentary feature less con
cerned with splashing blobs of Tech
nicolor curiosity across its canvas.
Rather, the film moves more like a
minute brush-stroke that etches the
landscape of a complex, often unfath
omable human mind.
Johnny Mnemonic
Set too close in the future for credi
bility, "Johnny Mnemonic" is a high
energy romp through the back alleys

and cybernetic underworld of the year
2021.
Overloaded with 360 gigabytes in
his wet-wired synaptic memory im
plant, Johnny (Keanu Reeves) is car
rying vital information that could save
the planet. To make matters more
complicated, he is running from the
Yakuza (the Japanese mafia), and
must download his neural hard-drive
within 24 hours or lose both the up
loaded data and all his natural memo
ry
The movie which references such
pre-cyberpunk classics as "Brazil,"
"Total Recall," the "Terminator"
movies, "Blade Runner" and"The
Lawnmower Man," is fast paced and
entertaining.
Little Odessa
Going against the grain of most
crime films which tend to portray
thuggery as some exhilarating joy-

ride, 25-year-old writer-director
James Gray never romanticizes the
mafia life.
Instead, he focuses on the pitfalls
of violence and the vulnerability of
families. Tim Roth, plays Joshua
Shapira, an experienced hitman who
approaches his work with casual bru
tality and returns reluctantly to his
hometown of Brighton Beach, a Russ
ian Jewish enclave, to take on anoth
er job.
Though the performances in "Little
Odessa" are uniformly good, the film
gives little sense of what the charac
ters are striving for. So, though Roth
spends many moments during the
film with a troubled look on his face
before erupting into gun-waving out
bursts, it seems his only plans are to
knock off the next guy, get together
with an old flame and move on. If
there are any moments of regret or in
ternal struggle, they come very late

Fanci's Persuasion
Billed by its narrator as a "post
apocalyptic inter-species love story,"
"Fanci's Persuasion" is set appropri
ately in downtown San Francisco's
playland of amorphous sexuality.
On the pre-nuptial night of Fanci
Wiesenthal (Jessica Patton) and her
leather-clad fiancee Loretta (Boa) —
Fanci's bridal gown needs work;
friends are rehearsing a feline routine
for the ceremony and the Wiesenthals
are not pleased at the prospect of a
same-sex wedding.
From start to finish,"Fanci's Per
suasion" lives up to its promise of a
divine exercise in toxic postmodern
romance.
"Fanci's Persuasion" screens on
Saturday, June 10 at the Castro The
atre. Tickets to the 19th San Francis
co International Lesbian and Gay
Film Festival are available in advance
from BASS.
