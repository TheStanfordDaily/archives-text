The end of the quarter is just around the
corner, and undoubtedly you've got a lot of
time on your hands since, well, who studies
for finals anyway? So you may as well run
over to the video store and check out some of
the early summer video releases.
"Speechless" features Michael Keaton and
Geena Davis as two political speechwriters
who meet during a senatorial campaign, fall
for one another, and then discover that they
work for opposing sides. The film is light,
comic, and enjoyable, although it lacks sub
stance and originality. The script is mediocre
and the plot is predictable. Despite these
drawbacks, the film is worth renting for the
delightful verbal sparring between Keaton
and Davis. Keaton drags his feet a little
throughout the movie — he lacks his cus
tomary zing and energy. But Davis and he
play off one another quite well. The film's
surprise is Christopher Reeve, who plays a
small role as Baghdad Bob, an egotistical
newscaster. Reeve appears only a handful of
times in the movie, but his character is

quirky and memorable — his
comic acting a refreshing change
from his typical action-adven
ture and dramatic roles.
For those into less main
stream movies, "Mrs. Parker

and the Vicious
Circle" may be
worth renting.
The film features
an all-star cast, in
cluding Campbell
Scott, Matthew
Broderick, Peter
Gallagher, Jen
nifer Beals and
Andrew Mc-
Carthy. Jennifer
Jason Leigh stars
as 1920s poet and
playwright Mrs.
Parker, whose
personal and pro-

fessional life is portrayed in this film. 1
found this film to be extremely slow
and hard to follow. Based heavily on
dialogue rather than on action, this
movie requires a great deal of concen
tration and patience, qualities which I
apparently don't have since 1 fell

asleep at the halfway mark.
My personal favorite is "The War," a
drama which focuses on a Mississippi family
in the early 19705. Stephen (Kevin Costner)
is a Vietnam vet who returns home after
spending time in a mental institution. As
Stephen struggles to put his life back togeth-

er and make sense of the war in
his mind, he imparts his sto
ries and words of wisdom to
his son Stu (Elijah Wood).
"The War" is much less a war
movie than a coming-of-age
story, and Costner is much less
of the star than Wood. For
such a young actor, Wood has
a surprising amount of stage
presence, able to hold his own
as Costner's equal on the
screen. The script is well-writ
ten, the language lyrical and
the plot unique and interest
ing. "The War" is one of those
rare flicks that makes you
laugh and cry and continues to
inspire you long after the
movie is over.
Other new releases this
month: "Clerks," "Low Down
Dirty Shame," "Junior," "In
terview with the Vampire"
and "Legends of the Fall."
