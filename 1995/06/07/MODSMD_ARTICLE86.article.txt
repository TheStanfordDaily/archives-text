## Ed Yoon It may be La-La land, but movies are still made in the real world 
### 
At first glance, its difficult to see how any
thing coherent — let alone glittery and
possibly career-establishing — could sprout
from something as inelegant and haphazard
as moviemaking.
It's agonizingly slow, for one thing. Most
days on the set of "Apollo 13" would go like this:
An army of hammer and whipsaw-wielding
grips stitch together a mock Apollo spacecraft,
flipping it around, tearing off panels, adding
new ones. Then electricians wheel in their
lamps — little ones the size of pens, big ones
that do a nice job of broiling your hand if you
lean on them. Then the camera crew wheels in
their baby, the sleek black Panaflex camera, and
practice their moves during the shot.
The set looks prepared and functional. The
props are all in place. Special effects guys stand
by with little gizmos to go off at the right time.

Headset-wearing production assistants relay
the word like nervous SWAT team members.
Finally, the star — in this case Tom 1 lanks —
is summoned from his trailer.
The soundman is ready. We roll the cam
era. The camera assistant gives the clapboard a
satisfying slap. The performance begins, and
when it works, the costuming and writingand
acting — the whole money-sucking frivolous
enterprise — can be mesmerizing, even trans
porting.
But usually, things go wrong.
Tom's head turn is slightly ahead of the
camera move, so we do it again. Then there's a
light reflecting off the window, so move that
damn thing out of the way. Electricians hur
riedly scuttle it and we roll again. But we have
to reload the film, and that makes director
Ron Howard frown.

By now lorn s getting thirsty, so there s an
other delay as a production assistant sprints to
get him an Evian before he expires inside an
astronaut suit that makes him look like the
Stay-Put marshmallow man. Costume de
signers quickly surround Tom — more wor
ried about the suit's condition than Tom's —
while a make-up team converges like com
mandos on hair and complexion alert.
Next take. Tom's head turn is good, the
camera move is smooth and the reflection
gone, but the focus puller didn't spin the focus
fast enough — Tom's profile has been hazed
for a fraction of a second and since he's open
ing the film that won't do. The focus puller be
gins to sweat as he sees his career prospects
slowly dissolving before him.
Meanwhile, the rest of the unionized crew
is looking for a place to sit, reading, knitting or

sipping coffee because their department isn t
immediately involved in the current crisis, as
Tom attempts to avert imminent death in the
movie for the 12th time.
After a few months of this, all filming is
done. Then comes the editing. Mind numb
ing. Total brain lock. Individual lines are pe
rused again and again to the point of madness.
The tedium is colossal.
But out of the endless artifice and frustra
tion emerges a bright, glittering two-hour vi
sion of the world, a 1 lollywood picture where
Americans' fantasies and desires are made
flesh, where life glides by on rollerskates.
Ikit if there's any confirmation that such a
vision was never meant to be, go visit a movie
set and be surprised by what a deflating let
down it is, how frustrating and trying and dif
ficult it is, everyday. Just like vour own life.
