SFCU is celebrating Graduation and welcoming Summer with a Used Car Sale Party.
This party will be held right in your own backyard — at SFCU's Page Mill Service
Center on June 17. Enterprise Car Sales will be bringing many different makes and
models of 1993, 1994 and 1995 cars, trucks and minivans by Ford, Chevrolet,
Toyota, Dodge, Pontiac, and Mazda, to name a few. Most cars will be equipped
with air conditioning, power steering, power brakes, AM-FM stereo and tinted glass.
All vehicles are carefully maintained to meet Enterprise's high standards.
Special Financing for SFCU Members
SFCU will finance up to 100% of purchase price, tax, license,
and extended service agreements. You will receive a 1/2% dis
count if payments are made automatically from your SFCU
account, and an additional 1/2% discount if you purchase your
