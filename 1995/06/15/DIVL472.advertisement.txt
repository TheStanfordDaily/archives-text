WE ACHIEVE BY LEAPING BOUNDARIES.
At Cisco Systems, making respectable
PROGRESS ISN't GOOD ENOUGH. WE ALWAYS GO
BEYOND THE EXPECTED, ALWAYS IN THE DIRECTION
OF WIDE OPEN POSSIBILITIES. THAT'S HOW WE VE
MANAGED TO LEAP SO MANY BOUNDARIES IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND
CUSTOMIZED INTERNETWORKING PRODUCTS. VERY
SOON, VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY WILL RELY UPON
INTERNETWORKING. THAT MEANS THEY WILL RELY
UPON Cisco.
We believe in being the best. Cisco is an
EXCITING, PROGRESSIVE COMPANY. WE SEE A
CHALLENGE AS SOMETHING TO AIM FOR — TH€N
surpass. Our people not only use the latest
TECHNOLOGY — THEY CREATE IT. We BRING
TOGETHER EXPERTS FROM DIVERSE LIFE EXPERIENCES
AND OFFER THE IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO
REFINE THEIR TALENTS, PERFECT THEIR SKILLS, AND
PROMOTE THEIR STRENGTHS. A "COMPANY" CAN'T
MAKE US SUCCESSFUL — PEOPLE DO.
