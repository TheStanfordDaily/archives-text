The Scientific Proof of GOD
Atoms exist throughout the universe and within them, electrons.
Electrons (and neutrons, too, not to mention pions) spin constantly,
ceaselessly, perpetually. ALL ELECTRONS, ALL INCLUDING INSIDE OUR
BODY, SPIN AT THE RATE OF 720° PER ONE SINGLE REVOLUTION. Not
360" but 720" per one single revolution — THINK ABOUT IT. Electrons
exist and spin in a way impossible for our body, taken as a whole, to
do. If our body were spinning, or could spin, at 720° per one
complete revolution, this spin would immediately kill us because we
are not designed to withstand that kind of motion; such movement
to our body would be fatal. We would spin out of control and fly
apart. 720° pei one revolution is not even something we can FULLY
COMPREHEND because all the objects in our normal, everyday
experience which we can see and touch, all these cannot make a
chair, comb, or football move or spin at 720° per one revolution. To
do this involves an entire dimension unknown to our tangible world;
a dimension known to us only through our mind, our imagination
and our beliefs.
This is a central mystery & paradox of all existence in the
universe, including our own bodies. How could part of us, OUR
ELECTRONS, spin partly in some other dimension without that spin
driving us out of control & killing us? How could such an incredible
design be developed? This defies all common sense! There is one &
only one rational answer to this mystery & paradox. As it says in the
first book of Genesis, we are all created in the likeness of God. God
loves us & so God put very special design into our composition &
construction, & into the whole universe. Well, God didn't do it just
for fun; God did it because God loves us & wants us to live & exist
in God's own image, which then certainly requires a very
complicated & sophisticated design. Now admit it, haven't you
often felt you were someone very, very special, & that you had
unique talents, experience, abilities. & gifts to share with the world?
Of course you have, & that is because God has created (more
than) a spark of the Divine literally inside you. If you can think of a
better, more rational answer to the puzzle of the electrons, I take
my hat off to you. But if you cannot find such an explanation, then I
think one would be willfully imbecilic AND irrational not to accep>t
this proof I set before you. There are none so blind as those who will
not see, ft none so deaf as those who will not hear. You can lead a
horse to water, but you can't make 'em drink. Fortunately, too, there
are none so wise as those who will choose wisdom, there are none
so happy as those who will be happy, there are none so wonderful
as those who choose wonderment & wonderfulness, & thefe are
none so Divine as those who see, hear & accept their own special
portion of Divinity.
There are many other indications & aspects of God's great
design. You can read about them In various sources, & I
particularly commend one to you: Bevond the Quantum. Michael
