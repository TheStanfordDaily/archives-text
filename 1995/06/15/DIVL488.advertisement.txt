Positions Immediately Available:
Systems Analyst
$40,000 plus bonus
Wall Street Analytics, Inc. is a small, highly successful financial software
company based in Palo Alto. Established in 1988, we supply analytical
software to several of the nation's largest investment banks and provide
consulting services related to the structuring of billion-dollar deals.
We are currently seeking two Stanford computer science graduates to act as
financial systems analysts. These positions would involve maintaining
computer systems, programming, and the structuring and analysis of
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMO's). Being some of the most
complex financial instruments ever designed, they require substantial
problem-solving and logical skills.
The positions are immediately available and are likely to lead to long-term
Wall Street careers in one of the most lucrative and rapidly-expanding areas
of modern finance. The salary for the first year expected to be $40,000 plus a
quarterly performance bonus.
No prior financial experience is required, but applicants should be thoroughly

in C/C++ programming. Resumes and transcripts should be sent to:
