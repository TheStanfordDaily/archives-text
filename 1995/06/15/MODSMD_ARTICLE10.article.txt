# Living the ideal life on the Farm: activities 24 hours a day

### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Sometimes you have to won
der when Surah-Marie Martin
„ sleeps.
»" In her time at Stanford, Mar
gin has done an amazing number
of things: majored in economics,
!*held two jobs, served as a presi
dent of the senior class, held
/offices in her sorority, counseled
'students at the Bridge, orga
nized the Spring Faire craft
show, participated in an academ
ic society and been a class teach
ing assistant.
• "My biggest fear is of being
bored," explains Martin. "If I'm
not doing something 24 hours a
day I go crazy."
As amazing as this resume,
however, is how typical this sort
of schedule is of many Stanford
students. Like so many others
who have passed through the

Farm, Martin has piled on too
much work, watched others do
the same, and noted this Stan
ford trait with a hint of awe.
"Coming from public school . .
. I was so used to being busy all
the time but watching everybody
else not be busy," the Houston
native said. At Stanford, howev
er, "there is this sort of underly
ing pressure to keep up. ... I
think every Stanford student has
come to a point in their career
where they figure out what they
have to do for themselves and to
make themselves happy."
Martin has had several turn
ing points in her four years here.
The first came the day she
stepped on campus, an experi
ence she calls an "epiphany."
"I walked into the Quad and,
not to be cheesy, but it was
almost surreal. It was gor
geous," she said. At that point,
she knew she had made the right

choice of colleges. She also knew
that she was going to major in
math "for sure" and take a
healthy dose of computer sci
ence.
After one quarter, she
declared her major — economics.
She didn't change her mind
about the Farm, though. Indeed,
she says, her freshman year was
"just fun time" for her.
Then came the summer, and
the sophomore slump, and the
next change. Mid-way through
that second year, Martin said
she learned new things about
the importance and pleasure of
academics and hard work, one of
the lessons of Stanford.
"I grew up a lot and just
accepted myself as a Stanford
student and was proud," she
says.
She also discovered that the
more tasks she picked up outside
of the classroom, the better her

grades seemed to be — another
oft-noted Stanford phenomenon.
This love for work, she says,
"left an indelible mark," one
that will drive her to excel even
after Stanford: "I want to be the
best at whatever I do."
None of which is to say that
such hard work comes without
sacrifice. Compared to her
friends at other schools, for
example, Martin said she spends
much less time "chilling" with
friends and embracing the social
life.
Yet in these less-frequent
social contacts, Martin said, she
found yet another secret of Stan
ford — the people. Even though
the quantity of personal contact
at Stanford is at times lower, the
quality is exceptional, she added.
"I feel that the friendships
that I have made here are really
strong," she said.
These tight bonds come in

part, she said, from the fact that
Stanford attracts a different cal
iber of person than most col
leges. Indeed, even those stu
dents who do not hold Martin's
friendship have something else.
"I respect everyone at Stan
ford," she said. "Not that I like
everyone or I can't find flaws
with them, but I respect them."
Still, as Commencement
arrives, Martin knows it is time
to leave even the people behind.
Now she is preparing to move
from the Farm to the big city,
having snagged a two-year stint
as a financial analyst for CS
First Boston in Manhattan.
"I'm glad I'm going to an
exciting, bustling place like
Manhattan," she said, "because
I'm certainly sad about leaving
here. ... I wouldn't be sad to
come back to Stanford in the
future for schooling."
As she leaves, Martin said,

she has one last wish: "I'm not
leaving with a lot of accolades.
I'm just hoping that I've made
some impression on someone."
