# People play a large role in defining the magic of Stanford

### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
When senior Luz Herrera talks about Stanford, she often returns
to the people.
Her discussion of her undergraduate years — both the good and
the bad — seems tied to the people she has met, those who have
influenced her and who she, in turn, has influenced.
Sometimes the people have made her feel welcome. Other times,
they have brought debate, conflict, even pain. Either way, much of
her learning at Stanford has come through people, through "meeting
different people and seeing different perspectives, reinforcing my
beliefs and having to defend my beliefs," she said.
"My fondest memories are from living in (Casa) Zapata and some
of the people I was involved with there," Herrera said.
One year for her birthday, for example, two seniors picked Herrera up
and carried her down the stairs while female Zapata residents showered
her with flowers. Then, in what was a dorm semi-tradition, she was
tossed in another shower — of water, Herrera remembered, smiling.
The least fond memories also involve people, Herrera said, specif
ically the loss of two people: Zapata resident fellows Tony and Cecil
ia Burciaga, who "were a big part of my development at Stanford, of
a lot of people's development." It was the first day of spring quarter
last year, Herrera said, that she heard Cecilia Burciaga had been laid
off hy the University.

"I guess from there, everything just kind of escalated into other
things," she said. The lay-off, followed by public racial slurs at the
Flicks screening of "No Grapes" and other events piled on one anoth
er, leading to the student protests of last spring, protests that includ
ed a three-day hunger strike.
"There was a lot of anger about things, about what we were los
ing," Herrera said, looking back. "I think 1 grew a lot out of it, but 1
didn't necessarily like having those feelings. ... I still feel angry, even
though we did accomplish some things at the hunger strike last year."
Amid these, and other, memories of people, Herrera of course
mentions other facets of Stanford. Research, she says, is now a great
pleasure. The political science major and co-terminal sociology stu
dent wrote a thesis on Proposition 187 and minority rights in a
democracy.
She also listed many other activities as important to her Stanford
experience: being a resident fellow at Zapata, studying at Stanford's
programs in Florence and Washington, participating in MEChA (a
Chicano / Latino student organization), working with University
committees, serving in the student government and helping to
recruit minority applicants.
Politics and service have both played important roles in her edu
cation, she said. As a Gardner Fellow for public service, she will
spend next year either working on voter registration or helping farm
ers in Southern California, where she lives. That will be followed by
Harvard Law School.

Herrera urged students and others at Stanford to get more
involved with service and the politics of everyday life.
"I wish that Stanford would pay more attention to what's going on

outside the palm trees and incorpo
rating that in the curriculum. ... A
lot of things, if they don't happen at
Stanford, they won't happen any
where," she said. "Sometimes
things could be better. You feel
you'd like a different type of politics
or something. But that's true any
where."
But amid the discussion of all
these other activities and experi
ences, hopes and plans, Herrera
returns once again to Stanford's
greatest asset — its people.
"There's plenty of faculty members
and staff members who care," she
said.
"It's been a good journey," Her
rera said in summation. "I feel I've
grown a lot. I'm not scared to leave,
like some people are. I feel pre
pared."
