## Gazing at the corporate crib, daddy knows best 
### 
Somewhere around the age ofl 6,1 lost
my dad. Not to a bunch of angels,
offering him an eternity of regular
bowel movements and classical music. Not
to 16-headed aliens looking for a typical
TV-hating, Medieval-recorder-playing
computer guy.
Not to a perky secretary, wrenching
daddy out of the loathing arms of his
family, to play mid-life crisis and buy her
BMWs for the rest of her life.
I lost my dad to the real world.
With Sonny Boy slightly preceding me
at Stanford, Dad had to find a new,
improved way to pay the $20 to $40,000
bills. Orphan smuggling was too cliche,
wife beating was handled by the guy with
the earth-mover collection next door,
and car dealerships were too risky with
the George Herbert Walker Bush
lifestyle crash about to ensue.
Instead, my Dad turned in his lifer
straitjacket and infiltrated the land of
the hired gun. Scrapped that Bewitched
1950s big corporate job, with its three

martini lunches, poorly-dressed caste
system and company Oldsmobile.
Trashed the dreams of a comfy 40-year
stint in a powder gray cubicle with poor
acoustics to join the rough-and-tumble
1990s corps of the contractor a few years
early.
Giving up a stable career at age 50.
Leaving all hopes for a Rolex at the end
of a lifetime of shelved work at the curb
side, right next to the concept of main
taining a standard of living equal to his
parents'. Looking instead to pay for
another two palm stubs to line Palm
Drive.
The gift that keeps on giving.
At that moment, Dad became a road
warrior, marauding about the L.A. free
ways packing his dance card full of house
calls to cure the hurt and ailing comput
er systems of the Valley, San Bernardi
no, the L.A. basin. Jostling along as a
pioneer of the contract-killer employ
ment that is the 1990s phoenix rising
from the engorged flames of the 1980s

corporation. No commute too far. No
media server problem too complex. No
opus of code too discombobulated to be
repaired by the magic fingers of my dad,
the master, the downsizer.
Live by the sword.
Now the man who had spent the bet
ter part of his life safely securing his
family in the upper-middle class — by
making his lobotomized supervisors look
like John Malone with a Baby Bell cash
flow — works for himself. Marketing his
skills. Selling his honed expertise. Har
vesting the fruits of his labor.
No more Peter Principle. No more
shelved work. No more carrying a divi
sion of water-cooler-loitering coworkers.
The man, the myth, my dad — kicking
ass and taking business cards, for the
first time in his life.
The wife, that house, the 16-year-old
girl — a hazy memory that started and
ended every 16-hour day.
Die by the sword.
Dad has taken maybe three vacation

days in these last eight years. He's
jumped a few tax brackets, scored a few
killer contracts, beefed up a home office
he uses only to play computer solitaire
after his current IVi hour each-way com
mute. He had to overcome that fear of
starting from scratch and relearn the
real world game only a few years before I
would approach it myself.
He now has the arrogance to charge
almost what his time is worth, the skill
to successfully peddle a resume that has
no dates or companies on it and a confi
dence that never entered into the tarot
cards before.
Don't let yourself go.
As I pumped out resumes last June,
the frequency and urgency of Dad's
phone calls rose exponentially: Don't feel
like someone's doing you a favor by giv
ing you a job. Promise me you'll never
work for a big company. You've spent the
last 21 years of your life proving you
weren't just like everybody else, so why
do you want to take some job where

you'll be measured by just how well you
can fall in line? Always work for yourself.
Don't wait as long as I did.
Mistakes were made.
And as I refuse to heed his advice,
insisting on paying the imaginary dues I
was force-fed by the Jetsons, Dad is
there to pick up the pieces. Of course
they can't make decisions. Of course
you're the only one who can get the
work out the door. Of course you don't
fit into their corporate organization —
because your place is at the top of the
triangle and, unfortunately, that space
is taken.
Yes, Virginia, Dilbert is an accurate
picture of corporate America.
And, as I took my bull-in-a-china-shop
approach to working life, he was in my
corner to dress my wounds. Relacing my
boxing gloves in my many attempts to get

that second raise. Watching the
hydrogen peroxide fizz as I
described long hours on overdue
projects that I let crush my soul.
Waving the smelling salts under
my nose, reminding me that this
was the best time to learn how to
work for myself, to write a book,
to become the dictator of a small
Latin American country now that

the peso is rock bottom.
Ay caramba.
I don't ask him how the rat
race is any more. I look back on
all the days when I'd go out on
the patio to shovel my dilemmas
on him before his weary foot
even hit the pavement from his
car, and I realize. I see all the
bills I put in his hand, which he
tucked away in his coat lapel
with a quick "Allah will provide"
retort, and I bow my head. I see
all the proms, the computers, the
plane tickets, power suits and

phone calls, and I lower my eyes.
They had to come from some
where.
And as I tell him about my
newest unexpected $300 bill, he
crisply answers that $300 will be
a pedicure after I pull myself
together and double my salary.
And as he listens to this vision of
himself at age 22 babble on the
other end of the line, stubbornly
beginning the cycle he broke out
of at age 50, he laughs his know
ing laugh.
And as I lie awake at night

wondering if I will end up work
ing for gruel and a severe beating
every two weeks for the rest of
my natural life, I understand. It
all becomes clear. The risks, the
sacrifices, the tasks that lie
ahead.
I've found my dad again.
