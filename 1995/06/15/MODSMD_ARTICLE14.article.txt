## Leaving Stanford uncertain, scared and tan 
### 
When I was little, in fourth or fifth
grade, I savored the last days of
school. It was party time. There
were cupcakes with tart pink frosting
that I wiped off because it was gross and
movies I'd already seen five times. And I
didn't care. Because it was all good. Not
too much reflection. I couldn't wait to get
out and play.
Somehow, this is different. The thrill
is less pure. Memory mixes with desire.
This weekend, we'll be taking a quick
look around to collect nostalgia and
phone numbers like stamps. It's no won
der why.
There's a lot to be said for lazy after
noons and late mornings, for stressing
about papers that one or two people ever
read, for cramming information that you
forget, at best, three days after the test.
It's all part of this process that,
inevitably, we will look back and miss.
Stanford was just about everything
that shiny welcome brochure said it
would be. Yes, like someone turning on a

fire hose and asking you to take a drink.
We've met amazing people who do
more in a year than most people do in a
lifetime. And they have some depth as
well. We've been inspired by lectures on
the folds in Phryne's drape, on the neu
robiology of great religious leaders who
seem to have schizotypal personality dis
order, on whatever tidbit kept you awake
at 10 in the morning even though you
didn't sleep the night before — and you
weren't studying.
What do we know from all of the grad
uation advice splashed succinctly onto
the Hallmark cards stuffed in our P.O.
boxes? That it goes bv fast. That we
should enjoy the journey. That it's best to
do what you like, worry about the money
later, even if your parents' friends give
you that raised eyebrows look. This we
know.
Hopefully, by this point, we've not
only learned to suck in all that inspira
tion, but to actually think about it with
out becoming automated disciples.

I've heard from more than one profes
sor, in the last class on the last day of the
year, that we are special, we are lucky, we
are privileged. Because we've been to
Stanford, because we're motivated,
because we're smart. And you can't take
that away. I've heard that it is up to us to
gather ourselves, with confidence and
humility, and go out there to do some
thing.
And so we will.
We came as valedictorians, national
champions, essay contest winners. And
regular kids. We came to meet, and some
where between CIV and a few 3 a.m. con
versations, we felt inadequate, felt better
than, felt humbled. And it was good.
We're looking back on our decisions,
wondering if we made the most of our
Stanford time, if our choices here were
sound. Because we can't go back and do it
again, though we might want to try to
stick around for just a little longer to
suck the marrow out. But they won't let
you co-term twice.

Stanford means something different
to each of us. But it means something.
It's been a little like Never, Neverland. A
magical kind of place where you won't
grow up if you never leave.
Four (or five) years and $100,000 (or
so) later, who are we?
We're uncertain: trying to figure out
what we're doing and why. Even if we
have definite plans, we're still question
ing. Hoping that someone will give us the
magic word. Plastics. For the '90s.
We're worried: that our inner voice
becomes inaudible as we enter the world.
We're ecstatic: Hey, we are done.
We're scholars, we're athletes, we're
nomads. Trying to do well and find bal
ance in our lives. Hoping to make it big in
the big world, because — one way or
another, in whatever way big is — we
want it.
We've lived and been tested by an
honor code in an age where fornication
and trickery are common.
We've got piles of pictures and moun

tains of memories.
We're trying out new opportunities
without our training wheels. Packing and
moving, looking for new buddies and e
mailing our old ones. Getting ready to
shmooze all over again.
We've showed our asses at noon.
We started studying in our rooms
because the library got to be too far.
We shaved our heads, drank ourselves
into oblivion and wondered why. And
some of us didn't.
We've had our hearts stomped on, our
egos crushed. And we've made it through.
We're still students. Some of us are
starting once again in just a few weeks,
some of us are taking years off. We're in
medical school and law school. We're
starting our own businesses; we're going
to Hollywood. We're going to be invest
ment gurus and corporate counselors.

We'll be cleaning the environ
ment and teaching kids to read.
And we secretly want jobs where we
can wear pajamas most of the day.
We like the pressure. We strive
to be great if not to be perfect. We
want to feel safe and loved. Guar
anteed.
We have more career options
than we know what to do with,
and we are choosing between the
sanctioned and the risky. It's

tough. It really is.
We're an idealistic bunch who
know about IRAs and CDs, keep
ing an eye on the future as we
open the champagne.
And we'll always jump just a
little bit during "All Right Now."
We'll be judges and surgeons,
mommies and daddies. Just give
us a few years.
And we're still trying on faces,
as they say. Trying on faces to find
our own.
We're thrilled to be done. And
we can't believe we're finished.
We've had it good. And with
glassy-eyed satisfaction, we'll be

sad to go.
At least I will be. There were
times, quite a few of them in fact,
when I didn't want to be here,
didn't want to keep going. Just
couldn't pick another pack of
classes, do another pride of exams.
Those memories have turned a
quiet shade of blue, paling in com
parison to the friends, the fun, the
fact that I've changed. And I still
can't believe I paid retail.
I've never been good at closure.
I still never know what to say dur
ing those good-byes. I hate begin
nings, I hate endings. I just like
the middle, where you're all set

tied in and that gnawing what
am-I-doing-and-why-am-1-here
feeling wears ofT and things are
just fine. Inevitably, the feeling
will be back. Something about
change that ushers it in.
I leave this place thinking that
it was exciting and staid, enlight
ening and boring, enriching and
frustrating. And I'd do it again.
Differently, but again.
Like so much else that's
crossed my path, I don't know
how much I'll miss this until it's
gone.
Sure makes me wish for cup
cakes this time around.

sor, in the last class on the last day of the
year, that we are special, we are lucky, we
are privileged. Because we've been to
Stanford, because we're motivated,
because we're smart. And you can't take
that away. I've heard that it is up to us to
gather ourselves, with confidence and
humility, and go out there to do some
thing.
And so we will.
We came as valedictorians, national
champions, essay contest winners. And
regular kids. We came to meet, and some
where between CIV and a few 3 a.m. con
versations, we felt inadequate, felt better
than, felt humbled. And it was good.
We're looking back on our decisions,
wondering if we made the most of our
Stanford time, if our choices here were
sound. Because we can't go back and do it
again, though we might want to try to
stick around for just a little longer to
suck the marrow out. But they won't let
you co-term twice.

Stanford means something different
to each of us. But it means something.
It's been a little like Never, Neverland. A
magical kind of place where you won't
grow up if you never leave.
Four (or five) years and $100,000 (or
so) later, who are we?
We're uncertain: trying to figure out
what we're doing and why. Even if we
have definite plans, we're still question
ing. Hoping that someone will give us the
magic word. Plastics. For the '90s.
We're worried: that our inner voice
becomes inaudible as we enter the world.
We're ecstatic: Hey, we are done.
We're scholars, we're athletes, we're
nomads. Trying to do well and find bal
ance in our lives. Hoping to make it big in
the big world, because — one way or
another, in whatever way big is — we
want it.
We've lived and been tested by an
honor code in an age where fornication
and trickery are common.
We've got piles of pictures and moun

tains of memories.
We're trying out new opportunities
without our training wheels. Packing and
moving, looking for new buddies and e
mailing our old ones. Getting ready to
shmooze all over again.
We've showed our asses at noon.
We started studying in our rooms
because the library got to be too far.
We shaved our heads, drank ourselves
into oblivion and wondered why. And
some of us didn't.
We've had our hearts stomped on, our
egos crushed. And we've made it through.
We're still students. Some of us are
starting once again in just a few weeks,
some of us are taking years off. We're in
medical school and law school. We're
starting our own businesses; we're going
to Hollywood. We're going to be invest
ment gurus and corporate counselors.

We'll be cleaning the environ
ment and teaching kids to read.
And we secretly want jobs where we
can wear pajamas most of the day.
We like the pressure. We strive
to be great if not to be perfect. We
want to feel safe and loved. Guar
anteed.
We have more career options
than we know what to do with,
and we are choosing between the
sanctioned and the risky. It's

tough. It really is.
We're an idealistic bunch who
know about IRAs and CDs, keep
ing an eye on the future as we
open the champagne.
And we'll always jump just a
little bit during "All Right Now."
We'll be judges and surgeons,
mommies and daddies. Just give
us a few years.
And we're still trying on faces,
as they say. Trying on faces to find
our own.
We're thrilled to be done. And
we can't believe we're finished.
We've had it good. And with
glassy-eyed satisfaction, we'll be

sad to go.
At least I will be. There were
times, quite a few of them in fact,
when I didn't want to be here,
didn't want to keep going. Just
couldn't pick another pack of
classes, do another pride of exams.
Those memories have turned a
quiet shade of blue, paling in com
parison to the friends, the fun, the
fact that I've changed. And I still
can't believe I paid retail.
I've never been good at closure.
I still never know what to say dur
ing those good-byes. I hate begin
nings, I hate endings. I just like
the middle, where you're all set

tied in and that gnawing what
am-I-doing-and-why-am-1-here
feeling wears ofT and things are
just fine. Inevitably, the feeling
will be back. Something about
change that ushers it in.
I leave this place thinking that
it was exciting and staid, enlight
ening and boring, enriching and
frustrating. And I'd do it again.
Differently, but again.
Like so much else that's
crossed my path, I don't know
how much I'll miss this until it's
gone.
Sure makes me wish for cup
cakes this time around.
