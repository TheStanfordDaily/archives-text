## Abundant spirit of youth makes the Farm great 
### 
I must admit that I am sick of the "lasts."
The last day of classes. The last bike ride
through the Quad. The last Senior Pub
Night. Is there really such a need to call
attention to the end of everything? Person
iilly, I prefer denial.
Because, as our time at Stanford draws
to a close, I realize I don't have perspective
on anything right now. I'm not ready to
leave, but I'm burned out on academics.
I'm not a huge fan of California, but I have
tons of friends here now and that matters
more. So I'm not sure where I really belong.
I once again feel like that little girl who was
torn screaming from her mother's arm and
carried into nursery school. Sure it was the
right thing to do, but it hurt me so much at
the time.
When I can actually grab a moment of
silence these days, I feel Stanford and
everything I love about this place thriving
within me. That pulse is surrounded,
though, by clouds of fear and confusion and
I'm left pondering the question, "Why is

Stanford so hard to leave?"
It's difficult for everyone to graduate
from college, but I don't know of any other
school that has as many recent graduates
hanging around. About 75 percent of my
close friends will be here or in Palo Alto
next year. Good or bad, that's an amazing
testimony to the love Stanford students
have for this place. And I believe that what
ever keeps people here is also what makes
Stanford so special and unique.
In order to answer my own question, I
asked myself what Stanford is all about.
This is what I jotted down: beauty, effort,
energy, change, diversity, fun, excitement,
interaction, attempts at perfection, and a
combination of inane confidence and
unabashed insecurity. And I finally realized
that each of these words or phrases could
also be used to describe the word "youth."
Unlike our East Coast colleagues, Stan
ford embraces youth. We don't have tradi
tions, so we make them up (the Wacky
Walk is, after all, only a few years old). Five
national championships a year will never be

enough. We're constantly growing —
adding a few buildings every year; we're
even constructing a new quad. Just being
on this campus makes me feel like I can
accomplish anything.
Yet like a younger brother cast in a shad
ow, we also feel like we're never quite good
enough. We don't have that perfect cur
riculum, so we change distribution require
ments every few years. We're no longer
number one in U.S. News and World
Report's annual ranking of universities, so
we pressure the magazine to change the
way it computes its statistics. We feel like
we're always paying for our mistakes (i.e.
the indirect-cost controversy).
It's never easy being young, is it?
But instead of fighting the ups, downs
and confusion of youth, Stanford soaks it
up. Where will Stanford be in '20 years? No
one knows. You can bet that the Ivies will
still be clinging to their status quo, though.
I pray that Stanford never matures,
beoiuse then it will be like any other school.
Our youth is our best commodity and we

should be proud — not ashamed — of it.
For me, this realization was much more
than just defining Stanford. I've always
been one to enjoy being young but was
never one who embraced youth. What
exactly is the difference? I've always liked
having the rest of my life in front of me,
having few responsibilities and feeling care
free. But at the same time, I always resist
ed change. I always wanted to know where
I was going to be a year from now.
Well, the tough thing about senior year
is that you feel almost everything you
depend on slipping away, or at least chang
ing. You lose the security of academics and
have to figure out what you really want to
do. You have to make a decision about
where you're going to live — there's no
more shuttling back and forth between two
homes. Your family and friends are still
there, of course, but you don't know when
you're going to see them.
To top things off, you lose control over a
lot of things — sometimes a company or a
school determines everything and you don't

even get to choose. At the same time, you
want to savor every last second of college
and you have to complete those graduation
requirements. Senior year for me was a
wonderful, chaotic emotional roller coaster.
And that's why it was so important for
me to be at Stanford this year. Instead of
spending my time resisting change and
stressing over my lack of control, I've
learned from Stanford to cherish the
moment. This may sound simple and
cheesy, but it made a world of difference in
my senior year and will continue to affect
my life.
I will never forget staring into my beer
on New Year's Eve this December para
lyzed by fear because for the first time in
my life I didn't know where I would be or
who I would be with in a year. Of course
I'm still scared, but I realize now that this
uncertainty is the price of youth. With

youth, though, comes a million
benefits and that's more impor
tant to me than being scared.
So six months from now I'll be
settled in a cramped apartment
in my native Chicago, working
long hours and trying to readjust
to Midwestern winters. I know
I'll still be staring into my beer
while watching the Bulls, won

dering where my life is heading.
But more importantly, I'll also
be traveling to new places, meet
ing new people and doing new
things.
Thanks to Stanford, I've
learned that nothing productive
comes from fighting change, at
least at this point in our lives.
For me, my life is now about
working hard each day and being
honest with myself and believing
that the rest will fall into line.
And that's more of an education
than I could have ever asked for.
