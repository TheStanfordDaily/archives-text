## Democratic, participatory utopia can be gained 
### 
Here's a statistic that needs to be
thrown around a lot more often:
Only 38 percent of all eligible voters
cast ballots in last November's election. It is
very interesting that only a small percent of
the voters gave the Gingrichites not just a
"mandate" but a so-called "revolution." Ex-
Sierra Club member Newt barely scraped
his way to a victory in his own home district
in Georgia.
By abandoning hope, non-voters fulfilled
their own worst nightmare: electing a
Congress more sympathetic to corporate
interests than ever before. You know it's
bad when the New York Times runs a
three-part series on how lawyers for lobby
ing groups are actually writing legislation
which leaves the subcommittee chamber

before the senators or representatives even
have a chance to read it. That's okay, they
won't need to answer questions from the
press anyway — the lobbyists will take care
of that too.
As an ardent environmentalist (and one
who is considering becoming a lobbyist),
I'm often asked if" it isn't hypocritical to
oppose the strength of the timber lobby
while hoping all the while that the League
of Conservation voters beats the Republi
cans (and anti-environment Democrats)
into submission. The answer is a resound
ing no.
The difference is that the environmental
lobby provides elected representatives and
their staffs with valuable information —
the truth — about why protecting theenvi

ronment is beneficial to their constituents
and the country.
They represent a huge number of voters
who believe in the environmental cause. A
public opinion survey by the New York
Times and CBS News reported that 58 per
cent of Americans agreed with the follow
ing statement: "Protecting the environ
ment is so important that requirements
and standards cannot be too high and con
tinuing environmental improvements
must be made regardless of cost." Those
are pretty strong words for 58 percent of
Americans to agree on, and it is very
encouraging that they do.
Corporate interest lobbies, however, are
by nature undemocratic. They pressure
Congress to favor the desires of a very small

minority over the needs of the majority.
Granted, corporate considerations should
factor into a politician's equation just as
any other part of his or her constituency
does. In fact, corporate interests should
have a significant amount of power because
of their importance to the economy and
therefore to the welfare of America. But it
should be obvious even to Milton Friedman
that you don't want real estate developers
writing wetlands legislation. Period.
We are living in the darkest era this
country has seen since the Great Depres
sion, and possibly ever. But it is important
to remember that the Chinese character for
"crisis" is the same as the one for "opportu
nity." From this chilling mood of paranoia
and fear we must seize the opportunity to

create the Utopian society humans have
been capable of all along.
But we will not change the world by cow
ering at home on election day because we
are afraid that we will not make a differ
ence. The only way to make things better is
to hope and believe that they will improve.
Some prophesies are by nature self-fulfill
ing. If you believe that you can make a dif
ference, you actually do. It is that simple.
An we go out into the world, let us strive
to do everything we can to maintain our
idealism. Spread hope that humans can live
together in peace and harmony. 'I he more
people believe this, the more likely it is to
