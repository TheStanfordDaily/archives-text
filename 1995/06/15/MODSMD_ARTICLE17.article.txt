# Grads often feel relationship stress
## 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Seniors Scott Crist and Tina
Snowden have had a model Stan
ford relationship. They met during
their freshman year and have been
together ever since. In June, how
ever, Crist and Snowden will grad
uate. And, like all graduating cou
ples, they will have to redefine the
terms of their relationship.
"Graduation presents problems
because you are forced to finally
decide on stuff," Crist said. "The
variables change and most people
must begin to make money and
decide where their future is."
Some couples are able to find a
compatible path, others are not.
When conflicts arise, many stu
dents are more likely to follow
their career path, said Alejandro
Martinez, director of Student
Health Services.
"When students have to choose
between a need for intimacy and a
need for competency and accom
plishment, they generally will pur
sue competency and accomplish

ment," Martinez said. "They find
it extremely difficult to compro
mise that part of them."
According to Martinez, the doc
tors at Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services see proportionally
more seniors than any other stu
dent group. Martinez said that
relationship concerns are the most
common reason for students to
seek the counseling service.
When students come in seeking
help, counselors attempt to pro
vide them with a new perspective.
If a couple is looking to find a com
promise, counselors try to help
them find a solution that will satis
fy both students, Martinez said.
"Couples generally come in
pretty clearly stating that there is
a decision they need to make,"
Martinez said. "They are coming
in to see if they can work things
out and see if they can find some
continuity in their relationship."
To find this continuity, many
students only accept job offers that
allow them to be near to their part
ner. Other students defer going to
graduate school or choose to enroll

in a coterminal degree program.
Long distance relationships are
also an option.
As transportation and commu
nication improves, senior Amy
Mainzer said she believes that
long-distance relationships will
become more and more common.
"If you are a professional couple
it is very hard to stay together,"
Mainzer said. "Long distance rela
tionships are becoming a reality
and a way of life."
However, Martinez said he has
found that long-distance relation
ships are always a couple's second
choice, adding that most students
struggle to find a mutual path.
Senior Michael Schaal and
junior Belinda Fu began talking
about how to find that mutual
path as soon as their relationship
became serious.
"We both have different agen
das" Schaal said. "But we want to
try and stay near to each other and
still do the things that we want to
do."
Although Schaal could have
gone abroad next vear he choose to

stay and work at Stanford.
"I had to make a decision,"
Schaal said.
This same dilemma confronts
many other graduating seniors.
And at times couples are compelled
to end their relationship. Senior
Sue Lazzari said that she and her
boyfriend senior John Sanders
have decided to part ways.
"We've fought about it a lot,"
Lazzari said. "It's unnatural
because I would like to think that
the relationship would go on, but
the fact that so much distance is
coming between us means that we
have to start a new phase in our
lives."
Martinez said that couples
often decide to get married as a
way of solidifying their intention
to stay together.
"Marriage is a clear commit
ment to think about their part
ner," Martinez said. "Marriage
requires couples to give them
selves less freedom careerwise
and forces them to make sacri
fices to protect their relation
ship."
