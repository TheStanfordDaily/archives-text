# With 18 NCAA championships in the past 4 years, Stanford has become the elite school in the realm of collegiate athletics
## Home of Champions

The Home of Champions.
While many other universities
have slogans and self-adulations
regarding their athletic programs,
Stanford has, in recent history,
lived up to its billing as the Home
of Champions. Over the past four
years, while the Class of 1995 has
been on the Farm, the Cardinal
athletic program has brought
home an unprecedented 18 NCAA
team titles, four more than the
record Stanford set from 1990-94.
Eight varsity teams contribut
ed to the staggering mark of excel
lence, five men's squads and three
women's. Perhaps most impres
sive in the bunch is the women's
swimming and diving program
which was perfect in the past four
seasons, the seniors never having
to experience a taste of defeat.
Of course, there were many
Cardinal teams which went so far
and came up just short of a
national championship, and all
Stanford squads performed with
outstanding class and competi
tiveness. This is an athletic pro
gram which is truly a model in the
world of college athletics — a
home for champion student-ath
letes.
Now if we can just get that silly
Axe back. . . .
1991-92: The Cardinal takes
on the NCAA, then the world.
The year was truly an exciting
one from start to finish, as the
football team excited the Centen
nial Celebration and Orientation
crowd with a thrilling victory over
Colorado at Stanford Stadium.
The squad rebounded from a 1-3
start to win seven straight and
make its first bowl appearance in
six years at the Aloha Bowl. Led
by redshirt freshman quarterback
Steve Stenstrom and "Touch
down" Tommy Vardell, the Cardi
nal embarrassed the most suc
cessful Cal team in over half a
century by defeating the Golden
Bears, 38-21.
Over spring break, the swim
mers took center stage, as the
women and the men, led bv

Olympians Summer Sanders and
Jeff Rouse, ran away from the
competition at the NCAA Cham
pionships. One week later, coach
Tara VanDerveer's women's bas
ketball team defeated powerhouse
Virginia 66-65 in the Final Four
and went on to crush Western
Kentucky 78-62 to capture the
Cardinal's second title in three
years. The men's hoops team, led
by forward Adam Keefe, also got a
taste of March Madness. The
squad lost in the first round to
Alabama.
In early spring, the men's gym
nastics program, led by confer
ence Gymnast of the Year Jair
Lynch, rose to national promi
nence by capturing its first-ever
NCAA crown. The women's team
also had reason to celebrate after
gaining its first-ever NCAA berth.
While the gymnasts made the rise
to the top, the tennis squads,
accustomed to the view from the
top of the rankings, finished off
the year in style. Although the
women had their six-year title run
snapped in the NCAA semifinals,
the men were victorious for the
fifth time in six years. Senior Alex

O'Brien captured the Triple
Crown of NCAA tennis, adding
the singles and doubles titles to
Stanford's team championship.
The five NCAA team titles tied
Stanford with UCLA (1981-82)
for most in an academic year. But
for many Cardinal athletes, the
end of the academic year meant it
was time to pack their bags for
Barcelona and the XXV Olympic
Games. Stanford athletes
amassed a whopping 19 medals at
the 1992 Summer Games.
1992-93: The genius returns?
Head football coach Dennis
Green leaves Stanford to coach
the Minnesota Vikingn of the
NFL. Who would fill his shoes?
The Genius. God. Bill Walsh.
In 1992, longtime San Fran
cisco 49er coach Bill Walsh
ended his brief retirement to
return to the Farm, where he
had previously led Stanford to
two bowl appearances in the late
19705.
The Cardinal responded by
having one of its best seasons
ever, notching 10 wins, including
another lopsided victory in Big

Game. Stanford went on to play in
the Blockbuster Bowl on New
Year's Day and, led by Stenstrom
and senior Glyn Milburn, defeat
ed Fenn State 24-3 to finish the
season ranked No. 9 in the nation.
Playing the NCAA tournament
during fall quarter finals week
didn't hurt the women's volley
ball team, which passed its tough
est test, defeating No. 1 UCLA in
the finals. The Bruins, riding a
43-game win streak, were dubbed
"invincible" by CBS commenta
tors. It was the Cardinal who was
invincible that night, winning its
first NCAA title in four games
over the Bruins.
In what would be for champi
onship counters the "guarantees"
of each year, the swimming and
diving squads brought back their
second NCAA trophies, and the
men's gymnastics team did the
same.
The year was also one of expan
sion for the Department of Ath
letics, which announced the inclu
sion of three new women's varsity
sports — synchronized swim-

ming, lacrosse and water polo — one
each over a three-year span, in order
to bring the school closer to federal
Title IX gender equity compliance.
Two decades ago, women's varsi
ty sports did not exist on the Farm.
By n»xt year, the highly successful
women's program will boast 17
teams and over 100 athletic scholar
ships.
1993-94: More, we want more!
Last year, the Cardinal once
again picked up four NCAA titles. I
know, maybe we're getting a little
spoiled, but the incredible overall
strength of Stanford athletics was
evident as team after team ranked
in the top 10 in the country.
The year started out with the No.
1 water polo team capturing the
NCAA crown over Thanksgiving
weekend, defeating USC 14-10.
Senior goaltender Larry Bercutt
was named Tournament co-MVP.
The water polo title served to fur
ther emphasize a fact many people
already knew — there's some seri
ous talent to be found at deCuerre
Pool. The swimmers kept up their
end of the deal, with the women
winning in Indianapolis and the
men matching the three-peat in
Minneapolis a week later.
Just before the year ended, the
men's golf team captured its first

NCAA title since 1953 with a four
stroke victory over Texas. Junior
Notah Begay 111 highlighted the
tournament with an NCAA-record
62 in the second round.
Although the four team titles was
an amazing accomplishment, near
misses abounded throughout the
year. The women's soccer team,
ranked No. 2 in the nation, lost in
the NCAA semifinals to George
Mason. Stanford dominated the
match, but was defeated on penalty
kicks. In the spring, both tennis
squads fought their way into the
NCAA championship match before
falling, the women to Georgia, the
men to USC.
The biggest injustice of the year
was done to the No. 2 men's volley
ball team, which despite its national
ranking was snubbed by the NCAA
Selection Committee in its quest for
a Final Four wild-card berth.
For many die-hard Cardinal fans,
losing the Big Game, and the Axe,
cast a shadow on the year, albeit one
lifted by the countless superb
accomplishments later in the year.
Stanford was pounded by Cal 46-17
at home at Stanford Stadium.
1994-95: Back on top
It was another banner year for
Cardinal athletics. Stanford racked
up five more NCAA trophies, all by
teams which had won it all at some
point in the past three years.
Although the Cardinal couldn't
muster up a record-breaking title
number six, the year was excitinu

from start to finish.
In the fall, the water polo team —
led by National Player of the Year
Wolf Wigo, a four-time Ail-Ameri
can — defended its title by once
again leaving USC the bridesmaid.
The women's volleyball team bene
fited from championship experience
and young talent, including fresh
man sensation Kristin Folkl, beat-

ing the other
L.A. school for
the second time
in the champi
onship match.
Just before
Spring Break,
the women's
swimming and
diving team
finished its
amazing four
year undefeat
ed streak by
squeaking past
Michigan in the
last event of

the meet. The men were not so lucky
against the Wolverines, as they
fought hard but came up short, plac
ing second at the NCAAs. The male
gymnasts, unheralded throughout
the season, returned to the top, win
ning their third NCAA title in four
years. Title number five was
brought home by the undefeated
men's tennis squad, which was
ranked No. 1 all year.
Again, those who were keeping
track had visions of six, seven,
eight, maybe more. Along with

men's swimming finishing second,
the women's basketball squad
returned to the Final Four, losing to
eventual champion Connecticut.
Women's tennis made the NCAA
semifinals and men's golf, led by
four seniors and much-heralded
freshman Tiger Woods, left Stan
ford just short of the country-club
sweep, finishing second to Okla
homa State in a playoff hole.
In a year full of successes, the
men's basketball team returned to
the NCAA tournament, winning its
first tourney game in over 50 years
by downing UNC-Charlotte in the
first round. The baseball team over
came a rocky regular season to win
its NCAA regional and make an
appearance in the College World
Series in Omaha. Women's lacrosse,
in its first year of varsity status,
won the Western Women's Lacrosse
championship. Although the foot
ball team had some hard times,
seniors Stenstrom and wide receiver
Justin Armour rewrote the Stanford
and Pacific 10 Conference record
books.
Being at Stanford for the past
four years has been an incredible
experience for athletes and fans
alike. Eighteen NCAA team titles,
numerous individual and conference
championships and a lifetimes
worth of memories.
Yes, in the world of collegiate
athletics, Stanford truly is the
Home of Champions.
Go Cardinal!
