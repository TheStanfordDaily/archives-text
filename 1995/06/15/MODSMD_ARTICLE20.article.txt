# With 18 NCAA championships in the past 4 years, Stanford has become the elite school in the realm of collegiate athletics

The Home of Champions.
While many other universities
have slogans and self-adulations
regarding their athletic programs,
Stanford has, in recent history,
lived up to its billing as the Home
of Champions. Over the past four
years, while the Class of 1995 has
been on the Farm, the Cardinal
athletic program has brought
home an unprecedented 18 NCAA
team titles, four more than the
record Stanford set from 1990-94.
Eight varsity teams contribut
ed to the staggering mark of excel
lence, five men's squads and three
women's. Perhaps most impres
sive in the bunch is the women's
swimming and diving program
which was perfect in the past four
seasons, the seniors never having
to experience a taste of defeat.
Of course, there were many
Cardinal teams which went so far
and came up just short of a
national championship, and all
Stanford squads performed with
outstanding class and competi
tiveness. This is an athletic pro
gram which is truly a model in the
world of college athletics — a
home for champion student-ath
letes.
Now if we can just get that silly
Axe back. . . .
1991-92: The Cardinal takes
on the NCAA, then the world.
The year was truly an exciting
one from start to finish, as the
football team excited the Centen
nial Celebration and Orientation
crowd with a thrilling victory over
Colorado at Stanford Stadium.
The squad rebounded from a 1-3
start to win seven straight and
make its first bowl appearance in
six years at the Aloha Bowl. Led
by redshirt freshman quarterback
Steve Stenstrom and "Touch
down" Tommy Vardell, the Cardi
nal embarrassed the most suc
cessful Cal team in over half a
century by defeating the Golden
Bears, 38-21.
Over spring break, the swim
mers took center stage, as the
women and the men, led bv

Olympians Summer Sanders and
Jeff Rouse, ran away from the
competition at the NCAA Cham
pionships. One week later, coach
Tara VanDerveer's women's bas
ketball team defeated powerhouse
Virginia 66-65 in the Final Four
and went on to crush Western
Kentucky 78-62 to capture the
Cardinal's second title in three
years. The men's hoops team, led
by forward Adam Keefe, also got a
taste of March Madness. The
squad lost in the first round to
Alabama.
In early spring, the men's gym
nastics program, led by confer
ence Gymnast of the Year Jair
Lynch, rose to national promi
nence by capturing its first-ever
NCAA crown. The women's team
also had reason to celebrate after
gaining its first-ever NCAA berth.
While the gymnasts made the rise
to the top, the tennis squads,
accustomed to the view from the
top of the rankings, finished off
the year in style. Although the
women had their six-year title run
snapped in the NCAA semifinals,
the men were victorious for the
fifth time in six years. Senior Alex

O'Brien captured the Triple
Crown of NCAA tennis, adding
the singles and doubles titles to
Stanford's team championship.
The five NCAA team titles tied
Stanford with UCLA (1981-82)
for most in an academic year. But
for many Cardinal athletes, the
end of the academic year meant it
was time to pack their bags for
Barcelona and the XXV Olympic
Games. Stanford athletes
amassed a whopping 19 medals at
the 1992 Summer Games.
1992-93: The genius returns?
Head football coach Dennis
Green leaves Stanford to coach
the Minnesota Vikingn of the
NFL. Who would fill his shoes?
The Genius. God. Bill Walsh.
In 1992, longtime San Fran
cisco 49er coach Bill Walsh
ended his brief retirement to
return to the Farm, where he
had previously led Stanford to
two bowl appearances in the late
19705.
The Cardinal responded by
having one of its best seasons
ever, notching 10 wins, including
another lopsided victory in Big

Game. Stanford went on to play in
the Blockbuster Bowl on New
Year's Day and, led by Stenstrom
and senior Glyn Milburn, defeat
ed Fenn State 24-3 to finish the
season ranked No. 9 in the nation.
Playing the NCAA tournament
during fall quarter finals week
didn't hurt the women's volley
ball team, which passed its tough
est test, defeating No. 1 UCLA in
the finals. The Bruins, riding a
43-game win streak, were dubbed
"invincible" by CBS commenta
tors. It was the Cardinal who was
invincible that night, winning its
first NCAA title in four games
over the Bruins.
In what would be for champi
onship counters the "guarantees"
of each year, the swimming and
diving squads brought back their
second NCAA trophies, and the
men's gymnastics team did the
same.
The year was also one of expan
sion for the Department of Ath
letics, which announced the inclu
sion of three new women's varsity
sports — synchronized swim-
