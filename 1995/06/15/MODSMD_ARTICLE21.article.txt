# Wicks and Rotert break foes like a hammer and anvil
## 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
In the movie "Forrest
Gump," the title character and
his friend Jenny went together
like peas and carrots.
This season, for the second
ranked Stanford women's vol

ley ba 11 team, seniors Anne
Wicks and Denise Rotert came
together in a similar manner.
The squad used the pair like a
hammer and an anvil, flattening
opponents between the two.
It is a combination that has
become very familiar to those
who follow the team. Wicks, the

hammer, provides a strong force
at the net, using her hitting and
blocking skills to pound her
adversaries. After the 6-foot-2-
inch middle blocker rotates into
the back row and finishes with
her serving duties, more often
than not, head coach Don Shaw
will replace her with Rotert, the
anvil.
The 5-foot-11-inch defensive
specialist excels at ball control
and passing. Opposing hitters
and servers who attempt to chip
away at the Cardinal's game by
attacking her area of the court
rarely achieve their goals. After
she has completed her tour of
duty in the back row, Wicks
returns once again to wreak
havoc in the front row, starting
the cycle anew.
"These two players give us a
great combination," said Shaw.
"The fact that we can use their
respective strengths in such a
way really helps the team."
The relationship between
Wicks and Rotert has also influ
enced how they see the action on
the court when one is on the
floor and the other is not. They
are able to look through their
counterpart's eyes.
"It's sort of a bonding experi
ence," Rotert said. "I don't know
if I've ever passed a ball that
she's hit, but we're tied together
in a different way."
Shaw is quick to compliment
both women on their contribu
tions to the team's overall devel
opment and strength.
"They've been great team
players," he said. "They have
the right attitude and they've
done what it takes to succeed."
Shaw also noted that, despite
the way he used the two as one
at times, Wicks and Rotert are
both individuals with their own
talents.
For example, there are few, if

any at all, who would consider
Wicks a role player. She repre
sents an integral part of the
offense and the centerpiece of
the squad's blocking scheme.
Her outstanding play at
Lakeville High School in
Lakeville, Minn., garnered her
Volleyball Monthly's 1990 High
School Co-Player of the Year
Award. Combined with her aca
demic achievements, such ath
letic prowess made Wicks one of
five finalists for the Dial Award,
given annually to the nation's
top scholar-athlete.
While her feats look great on
paper and film, Wicks also has
impressed Shaw with her per
sonality.

'I don't really want to
think about the end.'

"As soon as I met her, just
getting to know her personality,
I felt she would be a foundation
block for this team." Shaw said.
"She's just such a solid person,
both physically and psychologi
cally."
When the highly-touted
Wicks first came to the Farm,
she found herself far down the
depth chart behind future U.S.
National Team players Bev
Oden and Amy Cooper. Accord
ing to Shaw, this only added to
her development.
"She came into a situation
where there was very little
opportunity to play," he said.
"But she didn't let it bother her
and used it to become a stronger
player."
After a strong junior cam
paign in which she had 230 kills

and led the team with 34 aces
and 90 blocks, Shaw named
Wicks team captain for the '94
season. The senior has down
played the role, even as she pro
vides veteran leadership.
"Being captain hasn't meant a
whole lot of leading," Wicks said.
"I think everyone here is pretty
good at taking care of them
selves. It's more making sure
that everyone's happy and well
adjusted, that everyone is feeling
good about what we're doing."
Because of Wick's attitude,
her adeptness in high-pressure
situations and the fact that she
is "just so cool," the team chris
tened her "Slick."
"I was sort of sad when I got
it," Wicks said. "I couldn't tell if
they were being sarcastic or not.
But I've grown into it."
Rotert, Slick's defensive
counterpart, has not accumulat
ed the high-caliber statistics her
teammate has. She's not sup
posed to.
Rotert, known as "Kitt"
because of her Camaro's resem
blance to the vehicle from the
television show "Knight Rider,"
enters matches to prevent
opposing offenses from cracking
the Cardinal facade.
"Denise is as solid a back-row
player as we've ever had," Shaw
said. "She's definitely an asset.
"It's a tough position to be in.
You don't always know when
you're going to be called on, so
you always have to maintain a
state of readiness. She's handled
it exceptionally well."
Rotert underwent shoulder
surgery during the off-season.
However, this has not stopped
the back-row specialist from
doing everything else that she
can to benefit the squad.
"I think it's helped me find
my role," Rotert said. "Before,
I'm not sure if I always knew

how I was supposed to help the
team. The injury sort of gave me
a place. I can see it as a good
thing."
Having experienced many
"good things," the seniors are a
little reluctant to face the end of
their Stanford playing days.
"It still hasn't really sunk in
yet," Wicks said. "It seems like
there's still so much more to do
that I don't really want to think
about the end yet."
Rotert agreed with this senti
ment.
"It's come a lot quicker than I
expected it to," she said. "It's a
strange feeling."
Still, the two seem happy
with their four-year journey in
Stanford's cardinal and white.
"The program's changed a lot
over our four years," Wicks said.
"I feel pretty good about where
it's gone and where it's going.
Overall, it's been a wonderful
experience."
Even after Wicks and Rotert
enter the post-Cardinal world,
the team will feel the effects of
their contributions, according to
freshman outside hitter Kristen
Folkl.
"Having Slick around has
taught me to be more confident,
to go about things more aggres
sively and to not worry so much
about being too aggressive," she
said. "From Denise, I have
learned a lot about being poised
and being ready. I have a better
sense of when to react and when
to wait when playing defense."
Wicks and Rotert played a
large part in integrating Stan
ford's amazing class of recruits
into the program.
"I could tell from my first two
weeks here that they were going
to do their best to make me feel
at home," Folkl said. "They have
made sure that we freshmen felt
comfortable."

"The fact that we can use their
respective strengths in such a
way really helps the team."
The relationship between
Wicks and Rotert has also influ
enced how they see the action on
the court when one is on the
floor and the other is not. They
are able to look through their
counterpart's eyes.
"It's sort of a bonding experi
ence," Rotert said. "I don't know
if I've ever passed a ball that
she's hit, but we're tied together
in a different way."
Shaw is quick to compliment
both women on their contribu
tions to the team's overall devel
opment and strength.
"They've been great team
players," he said. "They have
the right attitude and they've
done what it takes to succeed."
Shaw also noted that, despite
the way he used the two as one
at times, Wicks and Rotert are
both individuals with their own
talents.
For example, there are few, if

any at all, who would consider
Wicks a role player. She repre
sents an integral part of the
offense and the centerpiece of
the squad's blocking scheme.
Her outstanding play at
Lakeville High School in
Lakeville, Minn., garnered her
Volleyball Monthly's 1990 High
School Co-Player of the Year
Award. Combined with her aca
demic achievements, such ath
letic prowess made Wicks one of
five finalists for the Dial Award,
given annually to the nation's
top scholar-athlete.
While her feats look great on
paper and film, Wicks also has
impressed Shaw with her per
sonality.

'I don't really want to
think about the end.'

"As soon as I met her, just
getting to know her personality,
I felt she would be a foundation
block for this team." Shaw said.
"She's just such a solid person,
both physically and psychologi
cally."
When the highly-touted
Wicks first came to the Farm,
she found herself far down the
depth chart behind future U.S.
National Team players Bev
Oden and Amy Cooper. Accord
ing to Shaw, this only added to
her development.
"She came into a situation
where there was very little
opportunity to play," he said.
"But she didn't let it bother her
and used it to become a stronger
player."
After a strong junior cam
paign in which she had 230 kills

and led the team with 34 aces
and 90 blocks, Shaw named
Wicks team captain for the '94
season. The senior has down
played the role, even as she pro
vides veteran leadership.
"Being captain hasn't meant a
whole lot of leading," Wicks said.
"I think everyone here is pretty
good at taking care of them
selves. It's more making sure
that everyone's happy and well
adjusted, that everyone is feeling
good about what we're doing."
Because of Wick's attitude,
her adeptness in high-pressure
situations and the fact that she
is "just so cool," the team chris
tened her "Slick."
"I was sort of sad when I got
it," Wicks said. "I couldn't tell if
they were being sarcastic or not.
But I've grown into it."
Rotert, Slick's defensive
counterpart, has not accumulat
ed the high-caliber statistics her
teammate has. She's not sup
posed to.
Rotert, known as "Kitt"
because of her Camaro's resem
blance to the vehicle from the
television show "Knight Rider,"
enters matches to prevent
opposing offenses from cracking
the Cardinal facade.
"Denise is as solid a back-row
player as we've ever had," Shaw
said. "She's definitely an asset.
"It's a tough position to be in.
You don't always know when
you're going to be called on, so
you always have to maintain a
state of readiness. She's handled
it exceptionally well."
Rotert underwent shoulder
surgery during the off-season.
However, this has not stopped
the back-row specialist from
doing everything else that she
can to benefit the squad.
"I think it's helped me find
my role," Rotert said. "Before,
I'm not sure if I always knew

how I was supposed to help the
team. The injury sort of gave me
a place. I can see it as a good
thing."
Having experienced many
"good things," the seniors are a
little reluctant to face the end of
their Stanford playing days.
"It still hasn't really sunk in
yet," Wicks said. "It seems like
there's still so much more to do
that I don't really want to think
about the end yet."
Rotert agreed with this senti
ment.
"It's come a lot quicker than I
expected it to," she said. "It's a
strange feeling."
Still, the two seem happy
with their four-year journey in
Stanford's cardinal and white.
"The program's changed a lot
over our four years," Wicks said.
"I feel pretty good about where
it's gone and where it's going.
Overall, it's been a wonderful
experience."
Even after Wicks and Rotert
enter the post-Cardinal world,
the team will feel the effects of
their contributions, according to
freshman outside hitter Kristen
Folkl.
"Having Slick around has
taught me to be more confident,
to go about things more aggres
sively and to not worry so much
about being too aggressive," she
said. "From Denise, I have
learned a lot about being poised
and being ready. I have a better
sense of when to react and when
to wait when playing defense."
Wicks and Rotert played a
large part in integrating Stan
ford's amazing class of recruits
into the program.
"I could tell from my first two
weeks here that they were going
to do their best to make me feel
at home," Folkl said. "They have
made sure that we freshmen felt
comfortable."
