# A 						modest superstar
## Josh Stein is strong all around the gymnastics floor — and in the classroom, too 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
You probably don't spot him
as you walk into the spacious
Ford Center training facility.
After all, he doesn't look like
what you're looking for. You
expect the co-captain of a colle
giate gymnastics powerhouse to
be vocal, confident, perhaps even
cocky. But you find none of these
things in senior Stanford gym
nast Josh Stein. Of course, once
you see him compete, there is no
doubt he's the one.
Clearly, Stein is the best gym
nast on the team. He would be
the best on most any team. A
two-time U.S. National Team
member, Stein won All-Ameri
can honors this year at the
NCAA championships — which
the Cardinal team won. He was
also given the Nissen Award,
which is annually given to the
top collegiate gymnast in the
nation. Stein was the first Stan
ford gymnast to win the award
since Steve Hug in 1978.
While some of the younger
guys may approach Stein's abili
ty as they mature and gain expe
rience, at the moment, he is the
man.
"Without a doubt, Josh is a
great athlete," said sophomore
teammate and friend lan
Bachrach. "He's as good as we'd
all like to be."
Stein's greatest strength is
his ability to hit his routines
every time. He doesn't have a
spectacular bread-and-butter
event, but he doesn't need one,
because he rarely makes mis
takes.
"His trademark is definitely
his consistency," said head coach
Sadao Hamada. "He doesn't

really have a single strong event
and he has no weaknesses."
Yet Stein is exceedingly mod
est. He speaks of his accomplish
ments as if they represent the
norm, showing little pride, only
intensity and the drive to suc
ceed and improve.
"I don't really consider myself
what Sadao would call a 'Big
Gun,' " Stein said. "There are
definitely guys like (1992 Stan
ford Olympian] Jair Lynch who
have really proven themselves
and I don't think I'm at that
stage yet."
Hamada disagrees vehement
ly. "Josh is definitely in the top
level of gymnastics," he argues.
And yet, Stein has not always
been so dominant. In the junior
division, he was successful, mak
ing the junior national team
three times, but was never really
considered at the top of his class.
As a freshman and a sophomore,
he contributed to Stanford's
back-to-back NCAA titles but
never really showed the talent to
be a superstar.
Then last year it all turned
around. He qualified for the
1994 U.S. National team, beat
ing several highly-talented ath
letes and surprising everybody.
The take-off culminated at the
end of last season with his spec
tacular all-around finish at the
NCAA championships. Both he
and Hamada agree that the key
to his surge has been increased
confidence.
"Last year, I felt like I devel
oped a lot of strength and lost
some excess weight to reach my
optimal physical condition,"
Stein said, "but the key was def
initely performing well at Sum
mer Nationals and actually mak
ing the National Team. It kind of

showed me where I was at and
what I was capable of accom
plishing."
Like many gifted athletes,
Stein showed interest in the
sport as early as nursery school
and began competing at the age
of seven, when his family moved
to Houston. The presence of Bela
Karolyi, perhaps the most
renowned gymnastics coach in
the world, made the city a natu
ral center for the sport.
Throughout his teenage
years, Josh looked to a future on
the U.S. Olympic team. At that
time, the lifeblood of the squad
came out of UCLA. Stanford
never entered his mind as a col
lege possibility.
"After the 1984 Summer
Games, I wanted to go" to
UCLA, Stein said. "It was the
center of collegiate gymnastics
and, for a few years, it was the
only school that I was consider
ing.
"But my father suggested
that I might look into schools
with a better academic reputa
tion, and actually mentioned
Stanford, but I had never heard
of a gymnast who had come out
of here, so I was kind of discour
aged."
In the next couple of years,
star gymnasts Tim Ryan and
Conrad Voorsanger competed for
the Cardinal. For the first time,
Stein began to take the possibili
ty seriously.
"By my junior year, Stanford
was the only place I wanted to
be," he said. "It had great aca
demics to go along with great
athletics and, in the end, that
was exactly what I was looking
for."
Stein has definitely made
good use of Stanford's resources.

He plans to graduate with a
degree in English and hopefully
go on to medical school to
become an orthopedic surgeon.
"Being in gymnastics, I've
had a lot of contact with physi
cians for little things, like
sprains and breaks," he said. "I
really liked the interaction I had
with them and I wanted to stay
somehow involved with the
sport, so it seemed like the best
way."
In a time when the student
athlete has become increasingly
rare, Stein has somehow main
tained his sanity between a diffi
cult course load and an unforgiv
ing training schedule. Yet he
finds even this accomplishment
unremarkable.
"I've been doing this type of
thing my entire life," he said.
"I've always had to balance the
two, so college hasn't been so
much of a change.
"Sometimes during the mid
dle of the season things get
tough with midterms and meets
conflicting but, for the most
part, professors are very under
standing and usually I can study
during the meet and make the
exam up later."
And while he is definitely on a
career path, by no means has his
desire to participate in the
Olympics diminished. He has
hopes of representing the United
States at Atlanta in the summer
of 1996. With his National Team
placement and success in the col
legiate ranks, he has already
made progress in the right direc
tion.
"It's a step," he said. "It gets
my name circulating. But basi
cally it comes down to your
scores at USA Championships
and the Olympic Trials."

Nor will Stein entirely leave
the Cardinal squad — he will
stay on as a graduate assistant.
Still, it comes as no surprise that
he feels a twinge of nostalgia.
"I will definitely miss compet
ing with the team," he said. "I've
loved gymnastics all my life. In

way, I will be happy to leave.
Gymnastics has caused me a lot
of pain and it will be good to fin
ish.
"But I'm not ready to leave
quite yet. Hopefully I'll be able
to fulfill my goal of making the
Olympic team first."

The take-off culminated at the
end of last season with his spec
tacular all-around finish at the
NCAA championships. Both he
and Hamada agree that the key
to his surge has been increased
confidence.
"Last year, I felt like I devel
oped a lot of strength and lost
some excess weight to reach my
optimal physical condition,"
Stein said, "but the key was def
initely performing well at Sum
mer Nationals and actually mak
ing the National Team. It kind of

showed me where I was at and
what I was capable of accom
plishing."
Like many gifted athletes,
Stein showed interest in the
sport as early as nursery school
and began competing at the age
of seven, when his family moved
to Houston. The presence of Bela
Karolyi, perhaps the most
renowned gymnastics coach in
the world, made the city a natu
ral center for the sport.
Throughout his teenage
years, Josh looked to a future on
the U.S. Olympic team. At that
time, the lifeblood of the squad
came out of UCLA. Stanford
never entered his mind as a col
lege possibility.
"After the 1984 Summer
Games, I wanted to go" to
UCLA, Stein said. "It was the
center of collegiate gymnastics
and, for a few years, it was the
only school that I was consider
ing.
"But my father suggested
that I might look into schools
with a better academic reputa
tion, and actually mentioned
Stanford, but I had never heard
of a gymnast who had come out
of here, so I was kind of discour
aged."
In the next couple of years,
star gymnasts Tim Ryan and
Conrad Voorsanger competed for
the Cardinal. For the first time,
Stein began to take the possibili
ty seriously.
"By my junior year, Stanford
was the only place I wanted to
be," he said. "It had great aca
demics to go along with great
athletics and, in the end, that
was exactly what I was looking
for."
Stein has definitely made
good use of Stanford's resources.

He plans to graduate with a
degree in English and hopefully
go on to medical school to
become an orthopedic surgeon.
"Being in gymnastics, I've
had a lot of contact with physi
cians for little things, like
sprains and breaks," he said. "I
really liked the interaction I had
with them and I wanted to stay
somehow involved with the
sport, so it seemed like the best
way."
In a time when the student
athlete has become increasingly
rare, Stein has somehow main
tained his sanity between a diffi
cult course load and an unforgiv
ing training schedule. Yet he
finds even this accomplishment
unremarkable.
"I've been doing this type of
thing my entire life," he said.
"I've always had to balance the
two, so college hasn't been so
much of a change.
"Sometimes during the mid
dle of the season things get
tough with midterms and meets
conflicting but, for the most
part, professors are very under
standing and usually I can study
during the meet and make the
exam up later."
And while he is definitely on a
career path, by no means has his
desire to participate in the
Olympics diminished. He has
hopes of representing the United
States at Atlanta in the summer
of 1996. With his National Team
placement and success in the col
legiate ranks, he has already
made progress in the right direc
tion.
"It's a step," he said. "It gets
my name circulating. But basi
cally it comes down to your
scores at USA Championships
and the Olympic Trials."

Nor will Stein entirely leave
the Cardinal squad — he will
stay on as a graduate assistant.
Still, it comes as no surprise that
he feels a twinge of nostalgia.
"I will definitely miss compet
ing with the team," he said. "I've
loved gymnastics all my life. In

way, I will be happy to leave.
Gymnastics has caused me a lot
of pain and it will be good to fin
ish.
"But I'm not ready to leave
quite yet. Hopefully I'll be able
to fulfill my goal of making the
Olympic team first."
