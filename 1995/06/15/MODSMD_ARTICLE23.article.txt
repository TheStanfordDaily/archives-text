# Swimming far in four years, Frank Schneider has become a team leader
## The 						Horse carrying water polo 
### Kyle Utsumi Editorial staff 
At times, Frank Schneider can carry <
the Stanford water polo team on his
back. The man his teammates affection
ately call "Horse" has made the most of i
his senior season, leading the Cardinal
both in and out of the water.
Although Schneider has started for i
the team since midway through his 1
freshman campaign, the 6-foot-5-inch, <
205-pounder has played with more pas
sion this year than ever.
"Frank came to Stanford as a young
colt and he will leave as a mature horse," I
said head coach Dante Dettamanti. "He I
has matured in so many ways — not !
only in playing ability but in leadership I
and personality. It has been fun to see I
him progress." I
Assistant coach Ben Quittner also
noted the hunger Schneider has shown (
this season. "As a senior, Frank has (
really picked it up," Quittner said. "He
has turned it around 100 percent from i
his freshman year."

Schneider certainly excelled this year,
helping lead Stanford to its second-con
secutive NCAA water polo champi
onship. He was named co-tournament
MVP for his efforts.
Dubbed by many the best holeman in
the nation, Schneider blossomed into a
multi-talented threat at the center-for
ward spot while at Stanford. His excep
tional strength allows him the option to
turn his defender and earn either a shot
or a penalty.
This year, Schneider made a con
scious effort to add finesse to his game.
In doing so, he has developed into one of
the most effective passers from his posi
tion. Against UC-Berkeley in the Big
Splash, for example, Schneider scored
two goals and constantly kept Cal goai
tender Sean Nolan off-balance with a
host of shot attempts.
In comparing Schneider to one of his
competitors, Hrovje Cizmic of USC, Det
tamanti noted the difference in styles.
"Frank is not the same kind of hole
man as Cizmic," Dettamanti said.
"Cizmic is one-dimensional. Frank is

more versatile, more mobile and has
more shots."
Hailing from Saratoga, Calif., Schnei
der entered Stanford as the nation's top
recruit at his position after earning ail-
American honors at Bellarmine
Preparatory in San Jose. Schneider and
senior teammates Wolf Wigo, a driver,
and Jack Bowen, a goaltender, made
Dettamanti's recruiting class of 1991
the best in the nation.
The coach feels fortunate that
Schneider chose the Cardinal over the
Golden Bears, who had just won the first
of three consecutive national titles.
Schneider's decision wasn't hard once
he took a look at both institutions.
"Basically, a lot of my friends at Cal
seemed to have a lack of focus," Schnei
der said. "They were not focused on
what they wanted to do, what they
wanted to be. They seemed totally lost
— one of my main concerns was that
they didn't seem to be enjoying them
selves. It seemed like it was an abyss."

This year, there was no lack of
focus on Schneider's part. The
wizened senior took over the lead
ership role that he saw other tal
ented Cardinal stars hold during
his first three years. It wasn't
always easy, but it was something
the team needed.
"It's really a strange position
for me," Schneider said. "I've
never really been a leader out
there I've been more like a
clown figure in the past.
"This year, I |found] myself
responsible for seeing that my
final year fwas] successful,"
Schneider said, a responsibility he
took "very seriously."
While he found the success he
sought this year, the NCAA finals
haven't always been friendly to
the Horse According to Quittner,
the 1992 NCAA title match was
the turning point of Schneider's
Cardinal career. Stanford lost in
sudden-death overtime after ral

lying from a six-goal deficit in reg
ulation.
Last year, though, Schneider
went from experiencing NCAA
agony to feeling championship
ecstasy when he sealed a Cardinal
victory over USC by powering
home a goal from the hole with
less than a minute remaining to
put the Stanford lead out of
reach.
"After [the 1992] game, he
decided he wasn't going to lose
another" title match, Quittner
said. "Last year, he made sure we
won. He put the nail in [USC'sl
coffin."
There is no doubt in Schnei
der's mind that the overtime
thriller turned his attitude
around 180 degrees.
"It was absolutely a turning
point for me," Schneider said.
"After that, water polo began to
take on a whole new meaning. It
changed me — it changed my
attitude when I played and the
way I approach the game.
"At the end I was physically
and mentally exhausted," Schnei
der continued. "I started hyper

ventilating. I couldn't stand. I
couldn't move for half an hour. It
was a good experience and a bad
one too."
Since that point, Schneider has
become the centerpiece of an
explosive Cardinal offense. He is
not only a prolific scorer, but has
also amassed a large number of
assists and drawn numerous
penalties which don't show up on
the stats page.
"He has learned how to control
the game," Dettamanti said. "He
used to shoot the ball no matter
what when he got it. We'd throw
the ball in the hole and didn't
know what was going to happen.
It was turnover city."
With years of collegiate experi
ence, Schneider has adapted to
the style of play and has provided
an emotional spark to the squad
as well.
"There have been several
games in which he had a deter
mined look on his face," Detta
manti said. "He inspires the team
when he turns his man in the hole
— he's the main focus of the
offense. When he is angry, he is

unstoppable."
Although it doesn't seem wise,
several teams have angered
Schneider by resorting to physi
cally pounding him in the course
of a match.
"I broke a tooth from a head
butt against [University of the]
Pacific and an elbow to the
mouth moved some teeth
against USC," Schneider
recalled. "I play very physically
— part of the attitude is being
able to absorb abuse. I expect
cheap shots; it's not something
that bothers me.
"Of course, I do get my
revenge," Schneider added. "I
know how to get even. There are
lots of ways of hurting people in
the water without getting
caught."
Schneider's philosophy of
water polo is simple: "It's getting
down and dirty. It's getting in
there and fighting for four quar
ters, and regardless of the cheap
shots and no matter how many
times they hit you — we'll come
out on top at the end."
And so they did.

what they wanted to do, what they
wanted to be. They seemed totally lost
— one of my main concerns was that
they didn't seem to be enjoying them
selves. It seemed like it was an abyss."

This year, there was no lack of
focus on Schneider's part. The
wizened senior took over the lead
ership role that he saw other tal
ented Cardinal stars hold during
his first three years. It wasn't
always easy, but it was something
the team needed.
"It's really a strange position
for me," Schneider said. "I've
never really been a leader out
there I've been more like a
clown figure in the past.
"This year, I |found] myself
responsible for seeing that my
final year fwas] successful,"
Schneider said, a responsibility he
took "very seriously."
While he found the success he
sought this year, the NCAA finals
haven't always been friendly to
the Horse According to Quittner,
the 1992 NCAA title match was
the turning point of Schneider's
Cardinal career. Stanford lost in
sudden-death overtime after ral

lying from a six-goal deficit in reg
ulation.
Last year, though, Schneider
went from experiencing NCAA
agony to feeling championship
ecstasy when he sealed a Cardinal
victory over USC by powering
home a goal from the hole with
less than a minute remaining to
put the Stanford lead out of
reach.
"After [the 1992] game, he
decided he wasn't going to lose
another" title match, Quittner
said. "Last year, he made sure we
won. He put the nail in [USC'sl
coffin."
There is no doubt in Schnei
der's mind that the overtime
thriller turned his attitude
around 180 degrees.
"It was absolutely a turning
point for me," Schneider said.
"After that, water polo began to
take on a whole new meaning. It
changed me — it changed my
attitude when I played and the
way I approach the game.
"At the end I was physically
and mentally exhausted," Schnei
der continued. "I started hyper

ventilating. I couldn't stand. I
couldn't move for half an hour. It
was a good experience and a bad
one too."
Since that point, Schneider has
become the centerpiece of an
explosive Cardinal offense. He is
not only a prolific scorer, but has
also amassed a large number of
assists and drawn numerous
penalties which don't show up on
the stats page.
"He has learned how to control
the game," Dettamanti said. "He
used to shoot the ball no matter
what when he got it. We'd throw
the ball in the hole and didn't
know what was going to happen.
It was turnover city."
With years of collegiate experi
ence, Schneider has adapted to
the style of play and has provided
an emotional spark to the squad
as well.
"There have been several
games in which he had a deter
mined look on his face," Detta
manti said. "He inspires the team
when he turns his man in the hole
— he's the main focus of the
offense. When he is angry, he is

unstoppable."
Although it doesn't seem wise,
several teams have angered
Schneider by resorting to physi
cally pounding him in the course
of a match.
"I broke a tooth from a head
butt against [University of the]
Pacific and an elbow to the
mouth moved some teeth
against USC," Schneider
recalled. "I play very physically
— part of the attitude is being
able to absorb abuse. I expect
cheap shots; it's not something
that bothers me.
"Of course, I do get my
revenge," Schneider added. "I
know how to get even. There are
lots of ways of hurting people in
the water without getting
caught."
Schneider's philosophy of
water polo is simple: "It's getting
down and dirty. It's getting in
there and fighting for four quar
ters, and regardless of the cheap
shots and no matter how many
times they hit you — we'll come
out on top at the end."
And so they did.
