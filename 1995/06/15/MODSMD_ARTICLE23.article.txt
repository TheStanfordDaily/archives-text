# Swimming far in four years, Frank Schneider has become a team leader
## The
						Horse carrying water polo 
### Kyle Utsumi Editorial staff 
At times, Frank Schneider can carry <
the Stanford water polo team on his
back. The man his teammates affection
ately call "Horse" has made the most of i
his senior season, leading the Cardinal
both in and out of the water.
Although Schneider has started for i
the team since midway through his 1
freshman campaign, the 6-foot-5-inch, <
205-pounder has played with more pas
sion this year than ever.
"Frank came to Stanford as a young
colt and he will leave as a mature horse," I
said head coach Dante Dettamanti. "He I
has matured in so many ways — not !
only in playing ability but in leadership I
and personality. It has been fun to see I
him progress." I
Assistant coach Ben Quittner also
noted the hunger Schneider has shown (
this season. "As a senior, Frank has (
really picked it up," Quittner said. "He
has turned it around 100 percent from i
his freshman year."

Schneider certainly excelled this year,
helping lead Stanford to its second-con
secutive NCAA water polo champi
onship. He was named co-tournament
MVP for his efforts.
Dubbed by many the best holeman in
the nation, Schneider blossomed into a
multi-talented threat at the center-for
ward spot while at Stanford. His excep
tional strength allows him the option to
turn his defender and earn either a shot
or a penalty.
This year, Schneider made a con
scious effort to add finesse to his game.
In doing so, he has developed into one of
the most effective passers from his posi
tion. Against UC-Berkeley in the Big
Splash, for example, Schneider scored
two goals and constantly kept Cal goai
tender Sean Nolan off-balance with a
host of shot attempts.
In comparing Schneider to one of his
competitors, Hrovje Cizmic of USC, Det
tamanti noted the difference in styles.
"Frank is not the same kind of hole
man as Cizmic," Dettamanti said.
"Cizmic is one-dimensional. Frank is

more versatile, more mobile and has
more shots."
Hailing from Saratoga, Calif., Schnei
der entered Stanford as the nation's top
recruit at his position after earning ail-
American honors at Bellarmine
Preparatory in San Jose. Schneider and
senior teammates Wolf Wigo, a driver,
and Jack Bowen, a goaltender, made
Dettamanti's recruiting class of 1991
the best in the nation.
The coach feels fortunate that
Schneider chose the Cardinal over the
Golden Bears, who had just won the first
of three consecutive national titles.
Schneider's decision wasn't hard once
he took a look at both institutions.
"Basically, a lot of my friends at Cal
seemed to have a lack of focus," Schnei
der said. "They were not focused on
what they wanted to do, what they
wanted to be. They seemed totally lost
— one of my main concerns was that
they didn't seem to be enjoying them
selves. It seemed like it was an abyss."
