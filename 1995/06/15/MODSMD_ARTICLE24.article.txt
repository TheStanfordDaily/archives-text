# 'Hammer' man Lammersen
## When the great scorer goes to write of sportsmanship, Bart'll be the scrivener 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
"Time running down, Stanford and Ari
zona all tied up. Stoudamire crosses down the
lane. Shot sent back by Lammersen! Cross on
the break. All alone, pulls up for a three! No
good! Lammersen with the rebound! Lay-in
no good! On to overtime. .
The day was Jan. 14. The time was approx
imately 9:30 p.m. The place was right under
neath the basket for Stanford's graduating
senior center Bart Lammersen. A chance of a
lifetime to win the game, a contest that Stan
ford eventually lost to Arizona in overtime.
That will be a time and a place Lammersen
won't soon forget. Even now, the 6-foot-9-
inch man heaves a sigh of regret when talking
about that fateful evening where basketball
immortality was there for the taking — only
to clank off the front rim.
"The Arizona game at home for me was a
personal low point just because we had a
ranked team here in front of everyone," Lam
mersen said. "And I had a chance at the end to
make a difference in the outcome of the game,
and I couldn't finish it.
"It was just disappointing because it was a
chance that comes along once in a career
where you had a legitimate shot at the end to
decide the outcome. It hurts a little bit
because you didn't complete the play, yet you
tried your hardest to do it. I guess it comes
with the territory because if I had tipped it in
I would have been the hero and everything."
Major publications like the San Francisco
Chronicle would continue to dog the center
for weeks to come, never realizing that it was
Lammersen who blocked All-American stud
point guard Damon Stoudamire's shot to pre
vent the win in regulation and his hustle that
placed him in such an opportune place for
such an inopportune act.
But, then again, it's all about opportunity.
Lammersen is not haunted because he missed
the put-back, but more because he realizes
•what could have been.
"I think the Arizona game bothered him
quite a bit," said senior forward Andy Pop
pink. "It was an opportunity for him to do
something that he could have held on to for
the rest of his life."
Poppink, who had an opportunity the prior
season to down UCLA with a game-winning
shot, speaks from personal experience. "He
doesn't feel bad about missing it," Poppink
continues. "It haunts him because of the
prospect of it going in. What if it had gone in?"
If it had, it would have been a just reward
for Lammersen, who has essentially put
everything he has had on the court. Perhaps
that's the main statement about the Arizona
game. Whether it is rebounds, rejections, lay/,
ups or even missed put-backs, Lammersen
lets it all hang out.
Sportscasters and writers love to talk
about heart, but if you take a look inside Lam
mersen's hefty chest you might not find one.
In its place might lie a gigantic, beating bas
ketball. Some players have the love for the
game, while others simply live it. Guess which
type Lammersen is.
While you may be hard pressed to compare
Lammersen's journey on the hardwood to a
real-life "Hoop Dreams," basketball neverthe
less has been a driving force in this Virginia
native's life.
"Even though I'm done, I still love playing

the game," Lammersen said. "You really can't
stop cold turkey. Basketball has been my
whole life since I was a kid. The game of bas
ketball has given me the chance to meet some
great people and see some new things. I've
learned to handle adversity better.
"Basketball's also kept me focused. Grow
ing up, I had friends that weren't really run
ning with the right crowds. They had tried to
get me to hang out with them, but simply
because I loved playing basketball so much I
didn't. Those guys are definitely not where
they could or should have been or definitely
where I am now. Basketball's given me the
ability to keep my nose clean and stay out of
trouble."
Even out of practice, he can't get enough of
the game. Off the court, his roommates are

"Even though I'm done, I
still love playing the
game.... Basketball has
been my whole life since I
was a kid.'

teammates Poppink, David Harbour and War
ren Gravely. His hobbies are his friends and
his friends are basketball.
"It's going to be tough [leaving] because
they're such a big part of your life," Lam
mersen said. "The guys on the team, espe
cially in my class, have been the most impor
tant people in my life here. I've learned a lot
from those guys. The entire team's just real
ly close. The closeness of all the guys will be
missed."
But don't be mistaken. Lammersen has
given much more to the game than simply, as
he himself puts it, "a big white guy who likes
to play and plays hard every time out." With a
career points-per-game average of 3.1, Lam
mersen isn't exactly an offensive superstar.
Still, he has thrived in his role off the bench
and has made the most out of his big-time
minutes (17.4 per game) by relentless
rebounding and defense.
Throughout the season, the "Hammer," as
he has been aptly dubbed, has displayed a no
holds-barred attitude in the trenches.
"I just think I use my body \well," Lam
mersen said. "I've worked hard* to put on
some weight. I'm not as quick a\? a Marcus
Cainby or Ed O'Bannon, but I have, more size.
So I try to use it and lean on people\.
"I basically tell myself that no o!\ie's going
to get anything for free. If you're going to foul
someone you might as well get your\money's
worth. If he falls, I'll just help him upland tell
him that I'll do it again. I'm not goiAg to be
intimidated by anyone. If you go out th\>re and
think that you're tough, you might actually
play tough. On an everyday basis I'm\not a
hard-ass or a tough guy, but on the court I
just do what needs to be done. \
The 245-pound body of Lammersen wiVl be
sorely missed next season. With his depar
ture, that leaves the Cardinal with just <\>ne
returning player over 6-8: 7-foot-l-inch fresh

man Tim Young.
"We're going to miss Bart quite a bit," Pop
pink said. "He provided leadership. Also, he's
a physical big guy, and we'll miss his size,
strength and toughness."
All season long, Lammersen has been
invaluable as a key reserve player off the
bench when Young either becomes winded or
gets into foul trouble.
"He was kind of thrust into that role on the
team," Montgomery said. "He did a great job
of accepting that role and saying that's where
I can help and that's what I can do. He ended
up being a really good basketball player. He
was a guy that always knew what he was
doing. What you end up with is leadership,
stability and maturity to help a lot of the
younger, emotional guys. When he was voted
captain, it was a perfect deal."
More than that, however, Lammersen has
been integral in the tutelage of Young, Stan
ford's freshman phenom.
''He's had a tremendous impact in my
development," Young said. "When I first
started, I was nervous and unsure. He
brought me along slowly. He was always
patient and helped me get used to a new pro
gram and new plays," Young said.
Still, the Cardinal's senior captain could
easily have perceived the emergence of Young
as a bitter pill to swallow, with Lammersen
being the senior and, without Young, the
probable starter.
That never happened, however, as Lam
mersen, recognizing Young's talent, did
everything he could to make the transition
comfortable. No anger, no jealousy, just a lot
of support and teaching.
"I took it upon myself to make it easy for
Tim to fit in to the system," Lammersen said.
"I think it was clear right away that he was
going to be a significant part of this year's
team. I just tried to help him out so his adjust
ment to the athletic side of college life
wouldn't be so hard."
Young couldn't find a better tutor, either.
Players and coaches have gushed about Lam
mersen's knowledge of the game. Not only
may you find a basketball buried in his chest,
but maybe lodged in his cranium as well.
"Bart knows the game," Poppink said. "He
knows what the coaches want and he helps
the coaches a lot, too. He's also just a really
hard worker. A lot of the younger guys don't
have that kind of attitude, but Bart shows the
younger guys how hard you need to work to
succeed at this level."
Likewise, Montgomery praises Lam
mersen's disposition as a leader: "What he's
done is be a consistent worker, and probably
the most impressive thing is the leader he's
turned into. As a senior, he's turned out to
clearly be the leader, and it's always been pos
itive."
But now that Lammersen's rise with Stan
ford basketball — from a 7-23 ditch to a sec
ond-round appearance in the NCAA tourna
ment — has ended, what does the future
hold?
Even though he's graduating with a degree
in public policy, it will still have to do with
basketball. His sights are set on the European
leagues and, maybe farther into the future, a
front-office position in the NBA.
"If you're going to do something in life, you
might as well enjoy it," Lammersen said.
"And most anything that has to do with bas
ketball 1 enjoy."

tried your hardest to do it. I guess it comes
with the territory because if I had tipped it in
I would have been the hero and everything."
Major publications like the San Francisco
Chronicle would continue to dog the center
for weeks to come, never realizing that it was
Lammersen who blocked All-American stud
point guard Damon Stoudamire's shot to pre
vent the win in regulation and his hustle that
placed him in such an opportune place for
such an inopportune act.
But, then again, it's all about opportunity.
Lammersen is not haunted because he missed
the put-back, but more because he realizes
•what could have been.
"I think the Arizona game bothered him
quite a bit," said senior forward Andy Pop
pink. "It was an opportunity for him to do
something that he could have held on to for
the rest of his life."
Poppink, who had an opportunity the prior
season to down UCLA with a game-winning
shot, speaks from personal experience. "He
doesn't feel bad about missing it," Poppink
continues. "It haunts him because of the
prospect of it going in. What if it had gone in?"
If it had, it would have been a just reward
for Lammersen, who has essentially put
everything he has had on the court. Perhaps
that's the main statement about the Arizona
game. Whether it is rebounds, rejections, lay/,
ups or even missed put-backs, Lammersen
lets it all hang out.
Sportscasters and writers love to talk
about heart, but if you take a look inside Lam
mersen's hefty chest you might not find one.
In its place might lie a gigantic, beating bas
ketball. Some players have the love for the
game, while others simply live it. Guess which
type Lammersen is.
While you may be hard pressed to compare
Lammersen's journey on the hardwood to a
real-life "Hoop Dreams," basketball neverthe
less has been a driving force in this Virginia
native's life.
"Even though I'm done, I still love playing

the game," Lammersen said. "You really can't
stop cold turkey. Basketball has been my
whole life since I was a kid. The game of bas
ketball has given me the chance to meet some
great people and see some new things. I've
learned to handle adversity better.
"Basketball's also kept me focused. Grow
ing up, I had friends that weren't really run
ning with the right crowds. They had tried to
get me to hang out with them, but simply
because I loved playing basketball so much I
didn't. Those guys are definitely not where
they could or should have been or definitely
where I am now. Basketball's given me the
ability to keep my nose clean and stay out of
trouble."
Even out of practice, he can't get enough of
the game. Off the court, his roommates are

"Even though I'm done, I
still love playing the
game.... Basketball has
been my whole life since I
was a kid.'

teammates Poppink, David Harbour and War
ren Gravely. His hobbies are his friends and
his friends are basketball.
"It's going to be tough [leaving] because
they're such a big part of your life," Lam
mersen said. "The guys on the team, espe
cially in my class, have been the most impor
tant people in my life here. I've learned a lot
from those guys. The entire team's just real
ly close. The closeness of all the guys will be
missed."
But don't be mistaken. Lammersen has
given much more to the game than simply, as
he himself puts it, "a big white guy who likes
to play and plays hard every time out." With a
career points-per-game average of 3.1, Lam
mersen isn't exactly an offensive superstar.
Still, he has thrived in his role off the bench
and has made the most out of his big-time
minutes (17.4 per game) by relentless
rebounding and defense.
Throughout the season, the "Hammer," as
he has been aptly dubbed, has displayed a no
holds-barred attitude in the trenches.
"I just think I use my body \well," Lam
mersen said. "I've worked hard* to put on
some weight. I'm not as quick a\? a Marcus
Cainby or Ed O'Bannon, but I have, more size.
So I try to use it and lean on people\.
"I basically tell myself that no o!\ie's going
to get anything for free. If you're going to foul
someone you might as well get your\money's
worth. If he falls, I'll just help him upland tell
him that I'll do it again. I'm not goiAg to be
intimidated by anyone. If you go out th\>re and
think that you're tough, you might actually
play tough. On an everyday basis I'm\not a
hard-ass or a tough guy, but on the court I
just do what needs to be done. \
The 245-pound body of Lammersen wiVl be
sorely missed next season. With his depar
ture, that leaves the Cardinal with just <\>ne
returning player over 6-8: 7-foot-l-inch fresh

man Tim Young.
"We're going to miss Bart quite a bit," Pop
pink said. "He provided leadership. Also, he's
a physical big guy, and we'll miss his size,
strength and toughness."
All season long, Lammersen has been
invaluable as a key reserve player off the
bench when Young either becomes winded or
gets into foul trouble.
"He was kind of thrust into that role on the
team," Montgomery said. "He did a great job
of accepting that role and saying that's where
I can help and that's what I can do. He ended
up being a really good basketball player. He
was a guy that always knew what he was
doing. What you end up with is leadership,
stability and maturity to help a lot of the
younger, emotional guys. When he was voted
captain, it was a perfect deal."
More than that, however, Lammersen has
been integral in the tutelage of Young, Stan
ford's freshman phenom.
''He's had a tremendous impact in my
development," Young said. "When I first
started, I was nervous and unsure. He
brought me along slowly. He was always
patient and helped me get used to a new pro
gram and new plays," Young said.
Still, the Cardinal's senior captain could
easily have perceived the emergence of Young
as a bitter pill to swallow, with Lammersen
being the senior and, without Young, the
probable starter.
That never happened, however, as Lam
mersen, recognizing Young's talent, did
everything he could to make the transition
comfortable. No anger, no jealousy, just a lot
of support and teaching.
"I took it upon myself to make it easy for
Tim to fit in to the system," Lammersen said.
"I think it was clear right away that he was
going to be a significant part of this year's
team. I just tried to help him out so his adjust
ment to the athletic side of college life
wouldn't be so hard."
Young couldn't find a better tutor, either.
Players and coaches have gushed about Lam
mersen's knowledge of the game. Not only
may you find a basketball buried in his chest,
but maybe lodged in his cranium as well.
"Bart knows the game," Poppink said. "He
knows what the coaches want and he helps
the coaches a lot, too. He's also just a really
hard worker. A lot of the younger guys don't
have that kind of attitude, but Bart shows the
younger guys how hard you need to work to
succeed at this level."
Likewise, Montgomery praises Lam
mersen's disposition as a leader: "What he's
done is be a consistent worker, and probably
the most impressive thing is the leader he's
turned into. As a senior, he's turned out to
clearly be the leader, and it's always been pos
itive."
But now that Lammersen's rise with Stan
ford basketball — from a 7-23 ditch to a sec
ond-round appearance in the NCAA tourna
ment — has ended, what does the future
hold?
Even though he's graduating with a degree
in public policy, it will still have to do with
basketball. His sights are set on the European
leagues and, maybe farther into the future, a
front-office position in the NBA.
"If you're going to do something in life, you
might as well enjoy it," Lammersen said.
"And most anything that has to do with bas
ketball 1 enjoy."

"Time running down, Stanford and Ari
zona all tied up. Stoudamire crosses down the
lane. Shot sent back by Lammersen! Cross on
the break. All alone, pulls up for a three! No
good! Lammersen with the rebound! Lay-in
no good! On to overtime. .
The day was Jan. 14. The time was approx
imately 9:30 p.m. The place was right under
neath the basket for Stanford's graduating
senior center Bart Lammersen. A chance of a
lifetime to win the game, a contest that Stan
ford eventually lost to Arizona in overtime.
That will be a time and a place Lammersen
won't soon forget. Even now, the 6-foot-9-
inch man heaves a sigh of regret when talking
about that fateful evening where basketball
immortality was there for the taking — only
to clank off the front rim.
"The Arizona game at home for me was a
personal low point just because we had a
ranked team here in front of everyone," Lam
mersen said. "And I had a chance at the end to
make a difference in the outcome of the game,
and I couldn't finish it.
"It was just disappointing because it was a
chance that comes along once in a career
where you had a legitimate shot at the end to
decide the outcome. It hurts a little bit
because you didn't complete the play, yet you
tried your hardest to do it. I guess it comes
with the territory because if I had tipped it in
I would have been the hero and everything."
