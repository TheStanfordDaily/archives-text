# For senior captains, life goes swimmingly
## Seniors Crowe and Thayer share friendship, leadership and a passion for the pool 
### Ezra Baylin Staff writer 
Seniors Becky Crowe and Kendra Thayer
quickly became close friends — even before
their freshman-year classes began — when
they showed up to the first day of pre-season
swimming practice. There they found that the
rest of their teammates had met each other
during the summer as some of the youngest
members the U.S. National Team ever had.
"We were low-profile swimmers our fresh
man year," Crowe said. "Kendra and I sort of
knew each other, and the rest of our class was
already buddy-buddy because they had been
on the national team trips together all sum
mer. It is really intimidating to know that
your classmates have won at World Champi
onships, set American records and been to
international competitions all before they
started college."
However, with four national championship
rings, co-captains Crowe and Thayer are not
intimidated anymore. Both swimmers have
been elected All-Americans many times over,
and neither woman has ever lost a dual meet
while at Stanford.
Though they are strong individual per
formers, the extraordinary aspect of these two

athletes is their dedication to the team as a
whole. Clearly, their devotion to teamwork
and activities outside of swimming prompted
their teammates to elect them co-captains.
Both have been either on the Honor Roll or
Scholar-Athletes every quarter at Stanford,
and their teammates describe their captains
as natural leaders and the most committed
swimmers in the pool. In a class with
Olympian Jenny Thompson and champion
diver Eileen Richetelli, Crowe and Thayer
show that compassion and hard work are just
as important as individual greatness.
"No one cares more about people than
Becky," Thayer said. "She has been captain
for two years because everyone on the team
knows that she truly cares about them and
what they are doing."
Although Thayer has not been to the
Olympic games or set a world record, she epit
omizes the Cardinal scholar-athlete. She real
izes that there is more to life than swimming,
that deCluerre Pool is not the entire universe.
Thayer stresses that swimming is not the
primary reason she came to Stanford or the
reason she stays. "My parents always stressed
academics and down-played swimming. I am
an economics major with no Olympic aspira
tions, so I am first and foremost here to get an

education."
Though they have had overall success with
swimming, both have had to overcome serious
shoulder injuries, which demonstrates their
inner fortitude. Crowe's tendinitis in her
shoulder forced her to miss several meets in
her freshman year, so she was not a part of the
team that head coach Richard Quick sent to
the national championship meet.
"Even though 1 made the cut for nationals,
coach Quick had to leave some of the fresh
men home from nationals" because of NCAA
regulations, said Crowe. "It was fair. It was
the way it worked out. But it is really hard to
read about how your team is doing at nation
als and still feel like you are a part of the
team."
Thayer, too, suffered through nagging
shoulder problems, but desire kept her going.
"Over the past three years, my shoulders have
gotten worse,' Thayer said. "They really kept
me from doing anything my junior year and it
was horrible. I had the worst performance of
my Stanford career at the championships last
year, but we worked through it this summer
and made some real progress."
Though adversity struck Crowe and Thay-
