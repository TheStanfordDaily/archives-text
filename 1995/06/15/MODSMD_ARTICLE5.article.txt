# Faculty Senate passes new DR plan
## Distribution requirements lowered by two; grades to be required 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Dedicated, impassioned and eventually
wearying, members of the Faculty Senate last
Thursday hammered out a new system of dis
tribution requirements for undergraduates.
Slated to begin with the freshmen of 1996,
the new system reduces by two the number of
quarters of DRs undergraduates must pass. It
will also allow undergraduates to avoid either a
course focusing on gender, one on world cul
tures or one on American cultures. Currently
undergraduates must take classes that examine
all three issues.
The new slate of "General Education
Requirements" also releases transfer students
from the Cultures, Ideas and Values require
ment and mandates that DRs be taken for a let
ter grade. Finally, courses in the humanities,
social sciences, natural sciences, applied science,
technology and mathematics will be certified in
only one area; cross-listing courses in two areas
won't be allowed.
What future undergraduates will face are a
three-quarter CIV series; three quarters of sci
ence, technology and math (one of which must
be devoted to a physical or biological science);
and three quarters of humanities and social sci
ences classes (taking at least one class in each
category). The world and American cultures
l ~ i A.I

filled while taking CIV, humanities or social sci
ence classes — as with gender studies now —
and students need study only two of these three
areas.
Senate Chair Bob Simoni pointed out, how
ever, that the senate's Committee on Under
graduate Studies must create criteria for evalu
ating which courses can be certified as fulfilling
DRs before the system can work. Simoni said he
hopes the senate would have a proposal on the
criteria by the middle of next year.
The new DRs grew out of a feeling among
many faculty members and senators that the
number of requirements should be reduced.
The seminal point for this re-evaluation was the
Commission on Undergraduate Education.
While many senators agreed that the num
ber of requirements should drop, there was
sometimes pointed debate on how this should
be accomplished. Indeed, from the start the
meeting flowed over a subtext of two competing
sides: one that feared a removal of gender stud
ies and the cultures requirements, another that
feared the senate would postpone the vote on
the system until next year.
The meeting began with both University
President Gerhard Casper and Simoni urging
senators to create and pass an acceptable new
DR proposal that afternoon. Casper warned the
assembled professors to avoid "an institutional
incapacity to make choices." Simoni set forth
limited discussion times to speed debate.

No sooner had these sentiments been
echoed, however, than several professors spoke
against approving the motion, fearing that
some or all of the cultures and gender foci would
be axed from the requirements. Speakers said
they felt that they were being asked to vote on
this issue with no chance for discussion and a
few implied that other senators were attempt
ing to sabotage these politically sensitive
requirements.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof. Mary Pratt
pointed out that the cultures and gender
requirements were important because "the
intellectual and scholarly range" of what under
graduates learned "was found to be too nar
row." No longer requiring these courses, "has
the potential to alter radically the profile and
priorities of undergraduate education," she
said.
But requiring such courses sends the wrong
message about Stanford's priorities, said Politi
cal Science Prof. Stephen Krasner.
"It may l)e appropriate to mandate distribu
tion requirements that show students different
general ways of thinking across the humanities,
social sciences, and natural sciences," Krasner
said. "It is not appropriate to mandate require
ments that suggest what students should think,
something that both the American civilizations
and gender studies requirements do."
English Prof. Regenia Gagnier
cautioned against too narrow a
view of such courses. "Gender
studies is not about women's
issues," she said. "It is about
using gender as an analytic cate
gory to examine many, many
issues."
While Krasner agreed that
looking through the lens of gen
der is a valuable tool, he added
that it is not necessarily more
valuable than others Stanford
does not feel the need to require
courses in, such as economics or
game theory.
A middle ground was found by
Biology Prof. Pat Jones, who sug
gested the two-out-of-three plan.
Jones called her proposal "a prag
matic compromise" and said it
was preferable to losing all three
requirements. Many senators
seemed to agree, saying they did
not find the proposal ideal but
thought it the best compromise to
ensure forward motion on DRs.
Other debate over the new sys

tem centered on how prescriptive
to make the scientific and human
ist areas. In both cases, senators
voted to require more breadth —
for example by compelling both
humanities and social sciences
classes to fulfill the requirements,
barring the option of completing
all three DRs in one area or the
other.
Upon approving the new
requirements, the senate revisited
and reconfirmed two other deci
sions altering the language and
writing requirements for under
graduates.
Senators also altered two other
policies. First, they reduced the
number of activities course units
that can count toward graduation
from 12 to 8. Activities courses
include athletics and dancing, for
example.
The senators also voted to
restrict the number of units taken
for a "credit / no credit" mark
that count toward graduation.
For students graduating after
autumn 1996, only 36 units grad
ed "credit" or "satisfactory" will
count toward graduation — only
27 for transfer students. There is
currently no such limit.
