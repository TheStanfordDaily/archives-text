# New unit emphasizes holistic view of women's health care
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Visits to the doctor can be an intimidat
ing experience. Often times, the physi
cian's busy schedule results in a lack of
communication and intimacy that can
lead to misdiagnoses. This can lead doc
tors to miss signs of abuse or other causes
of medical problems in women.
But now, a group of Stanford students
has initiated plans for a new care unit
focused on outside problems that might
affect a doctor's diagnosis. What makes
this unit distinct from others in the nation
is that it takes a holistic view of women's
health issues.
"This is a radical approach to medicine
compared to the standard technical
approach," said Richard Blum, co-direc
tor of the project. "Normally, doctors are
the ones who make the decisions, but in
this unit, there will be many supporting
staff members helping to make the diag

nosis.
Students in Obstetrics / Gynecology
399 — advanced research - came up with
the program, called the Women's Health
Promotion Unit.
Junior Nisha Achaiya, a human biolo
gy major, said that the unit will put
women on an equal basis by making them
part of the health counseling process and
taking the time to speak to patients in a
supportive environment.
The unit may also serve as a referral
unit, said senior Sarina Berhera. If volun
teers discover other possible causes of ill
ness that women are reluctant to talk
about or that doctors miss, they can point
the patients to the proper specialist or
department.
"There could be other things that the
patient is not telling the doctor about or
the doctor is not asking. Factors like drug
abuse, spousal abuse, stress on t he job and
suspicion of doctors can cause physicians
to give inaccurate treatments," said
Berhera.

Low income women in particular fall
through the holes, she added.
According to Blum, the plan "is still an
experiment in process, and it's not just
another obstetrics / gynecology depart
ment. It's meant to be a supplement to
encourage doctor-patient interaction."
Along with Gynecology / Obstetrics
Prof. Emeritus Leroy Heinrichs, Blum
says he serves merely as an adviser to the
project. "It's the students who do most of
the work." he said. "I am truly amazed at
the level and quality of work done by the
undergraduates."
The spark that initiated the action was
when students in the class found out and
revived a long-dormant project to bring a
holistic view to women's health issues
here at Stanford, Blum said.
"Originally, the whole thing started out
as a class project," said Acharya. "We
started to find problems in women's
health where the standard medical case
did not work."
The class began to uncover problems

ranging from the capitation system of
reimbursement to poor communication
between doctors and patients.
The capitation system is when health
care units are paid per patient served.
There is great incentive for groups like
health maintenance organizations to see
as many people as possible in as little time
necessary to bring in greater profits,
according to senior Sarah Nixon, a human
biology major in the class.
It was then that the students found the
shelved plans for the women's referral
unit. They resolved to revive the project
and make it a viable operation.
"It's been a lot of work. We've inter
viewed literally hundreds of people from
doctors and other departments to prevent
duplication," said Acharya. "But we've
been very successful in our efforts and
have assembled a fully volunteer unit of
nurses and residents."
In addition to the donated labor, the
Medical Center has agreed to contribute
the use of space at the Hospital, said

Nixon.
"We've been able to get free space from
the Medical Center for our purpose," said
Nixon. "It's become a fully voluntary
unit."
"We wanted to explore the human side
of illness," said Blum. "Over 40 percent of
I female | patients who are given routine
technical examinations come hack not
having their problems cured."
If successful, it could become a pioneer
ing program for the rest of the country to
follow, said Blum.
"UCLA has initiated a program similar
to ours, but they have a lot of money and
lots of support behind them," said Blum.
"Here, we have students playing the major
role in the program. I think it's remark
able that undergraduates at this level have
been able to turn out a product of this cal
iber," he said
Acharya will stay through the sum
mer to see that t he program is ready for
possible implementation in the fall ul
