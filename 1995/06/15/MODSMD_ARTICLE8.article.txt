# Presidents, protests and personalities — 4 years in review
## 
### 
-1991-1992
September
• Stanford won a court ruling bar
ring the government from censor
ing publication of results from
federally funded research. Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy called this a "victory for
academic freedom."
• The University announced that
Cowell Student Health Center
would provide health insurance
for domestic partners beginning
winter quarter. This made Cowell
the first student clinic in the
country to provide these services.
October
• The University announced a $43
million budget-cutting program.
A 12-page statement was released
at the beginning of the month
announcing reduction targets for
the University schools and admin
istrative areas.
November
• After plans to eliminate per
forming arts at Stanford as part
of budget cuts, more than 600
students and faculty staged a rally
in White Plaza protesting the
move. More than 12 groups per
formed at the rally.
• Junior Daniel Lichtenstein com
mitted suicide in his room in
Toyon Hall Saturday, Nov. 11,
after a night of drinking. Police
found a bottle of pills near Licht
enstein, who left a suicide note.
December
• The directors of four ethnic
community centers expressed

concern over the effects of budget
cuts on campus centers. The
directors said they were worried
budget cuts would make it more
difficult to accommodate Stan
ford's growing minority popula
tion.
January
• Law student Keith Rabois
directed anti-gay remarks toward
Otero resident fellow Dennis
Matthies. The Stanford commu
nity responded — mostly through
fliers, posters and letters to The
Daily — for more than a month
after the incident.
• After a career of 25 years at
Stanford, Provost James Rosse
announced he would leave in
April to become president of Free
dom Newspapers, a Southern Cal
ifornia chain of newspapers. Uni

versity President Donald
Kennedy chose Operations
Research Prof. Gerald Lieberman
to succeed Rosse.
• Senior Stuart Thomas was sen
tenced for two misdemeanors —
statutory rape and providing alco
hol to a minor — in the conclusion
of a case that sparked a campus
debate on acquaintance rape.
Thomas received a sentence of
two years on probation, 100 hours
of community service and a
$1,000 fine.
February
• Senior employees at The Stan
ford Bookstore enjoy a host of lav
ish perquisites unheard of else
where in the college bookstore
industry, The Daily reported. The
perks included luxury automo
biles and the use of a motor home
and a vacation home in Twain
Harte, Calif. The Daily later
reported that the Bookstore had
lost $1.8 million in investments in
the previous year.
March
• Gerhard Casper, the provost at
the University of Chicago, was
appointed Stanford's ninth presi
dent on March 17, following a
highly secretive six-month search
and selection process that pro
duced 667 nominees and was com
pleted three months before its
deadline. Casper, a German immi
grant who became a national
authority on constitutional law,
came in as an outsider to Stan
ford, having served the last 25
years of his academic career at the

University of Chicago.
April
• The ASSU spring election came
to an unexpected end as the stu
dent body elected "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP," a group of four stu
dents promising to dismantle the
Council of Presidents. After the
election, the ASSU Senate passed
a budget that removed all money
from the COP's budget.
• While angry citizens rioted in
Los Angeles and San Francisco
over the acquittal of four white
police officers involved in the
beating of black motorist Rodney
King, Stanford reacted quickly
and peacefully with a midnight
march to the Palo Alto police sta
tion. In the days that followed,
students on campus wore black to
mourn the verdict. On May 1, a
noon rally drew more than 1,500
people to listen to speeches and
songs by ethnic community lead
ers. The rally culminated in
another march to the Palo Alto
police station, where the crowd
blocked traffic for more than an
hour.
May
• Although his first visit, in 1990,
was a bigger event, former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's
second visit to Stanford was
eagerly anticipated by the com
munity and marked by an unex
pectedly high demand for tickets.
In addition to speaking on "The
Rule of Law," the leader and his
wife, Raisa, toured the Hoover
Institution and viewed an exhibit
called "A Century of Revolutions:
Lenin to Gorbachev."
June
• Asst. Dean of Students Keith
Archuleta resigned June 2 amid
allegations that he had secretly
videotaped women while they
changed clothes in his bedroom
photography studio. Archuleta
was arrested May 31 and was
later sentenced to 200 hours com
munity service and four years of
probation.
1992-1993
September
• The Athletics Department
rejected a Stanford Band halftime
show titled "The Unauthorized
Biography of Gerhard Casper."

When Band announcers revealed
the decision, the department
threatened the Band with suspen
sion. The suspension was revoked
after the Band agreed to negotiate
guidelines for acceptable halftime
shows.
October
• Gerhard Casper took office as
Stanford's ninth president. Class
es were canceled as 7,000 stu
dents, faculty and staff attended
the inauguration ceremony. In his
speech, Casper invoked the school
motto, promising that the "winds
of freedom" would blow at Stan
ford.
• The Faculty Senate voted to
extend spousal benefits — includ
ing health insurance — to same
sex and domestic partners of Uni
versity employees. The plan was
later amended by the Board of
Trustees to include only same-sex
domestic partners.
November
• Bill Clinton was elected the
nation's 42nd president. A Daily
poll taken one week before
showed that 67 percent of Stan
ford students intended to vote for
Clinton.
January
• Casper proposed a three-year
undergraduate degree option in
an interview with the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. He later said that
the plan was still in the specula
tive stages.
February
• The Stanford Bookstore placed
its Twain Harte vacation home on
the market in an attempt to
recover funds poured into the
retreat for top employees. Book
store officials also said they had
spent nearly $900,000 to cover
legal fees resulting from the state
attorney general's investigation
into the store's compensation
practices.
• Prof. William Perry, co-director
of the Stanford Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Con
trol, was confirmed by the Senate
as deputy defense secretary.
• The Board of Trustees
announced a 7.5 percent tuition
increase for the 1993-94 school
year.

March
• President Clinton nominated
two Stanford experts to top posts
in Washington. Economics Prof,
and Hoover Senior Fellow Joseph
Stiglitz was nominated to be the
third member of Clinton's Coun
cil of Economic Advisers, and
School of Education Dean Mar
shall Smith was tapped to be
undersecretary of education, a
policy and budget position
redesigned especially for him.
April
• Allegations of cheating during
final exams in two courses
prompted professors and adminis
trators to launch an investigation
and withhold grades. Students in
Geophysics 04 and Philosophy
58, a Cultures, Ideas and Values
course, were told that they may
have to retake their winter quar
ter finals. It was later decided that
the original grades would count
despite numerous anonymous
allegations of cheating.
• Wallace Stegner, professor emer
itus of English, died after suffer
ing injuries in a car crash. The 84-
year-old Stegner founded Stan
ford's Creative Writing Program,
which helped train writers includ
ing Ken Kesey, Larry McMurty
and Scott Turow. Stegner had
won the Pulitzer Prize in 1972 for
his novel "Angle of Repose."
• After preferring not to have a
COP for a whole year, students
voted a Council of Presidents back
into office.
• University President Gerhard
Casper announced plans to estab
lish the Commission on Under
graduate Education, a body to re
evaluate curriculum and require
ments, during his first "State of
the University" address.
• Spurred by studies showing the
danger of second-hand smoke, the
University began consideration of
a policy prohibiting smoking in all
indoor facilities and banning the
sale of cigarettes on campus.
May
• 25 students picketed the hotel
where Stanford students were
being interviewed and pho
tographed for Playboy magazine's
"Girls of the Pac 10" issue.
Approximately 60 women turned
out to audition.

Students march to protest the 1992 verdict in the Rodney King case.
• Sharon Parker, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, resigned suddenly, prompt
ing a rash of anonymous fliers
criticizing University President
Gerhard Casper's policies on mul
ticulturalism.
• Stanford's Haas Center for Pub
lic Service was chosen as one of a
handful of sties nationwide for
President Bill Clinton's recently
unveiled national service pro
gram.
• University President Gerhard
Casper named Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice Stanford's
new provost. Rice previously
served as special assistant to

President George Bush for
national security affairs, on the
National Security Council and as
assistant director of the Center
for International Security and
Arms Control. Rice was a member
of the search committee that
selected Casper as Stanford's
president the year before.
• Economics Prof. John Shoven, a
veteran faculty member who
often testifies before Congress on
policy issues, was appointed Dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences. Shoven was a member
of the search committee that
selected Casper as Stanford's
president the year before.
1993-1994
October
• The University's ban on indoor

smoking went into effect, leaving
smokers in search of wide-open,
or at least well-ventilated, spaces
where they could take a few puffs.
• During a tour through the Bay
Area, President Bill Clinton
announced a $237 million boost
for the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center. The Department of
Energy recommended that SLAC
receive the funds to upgrade its B
factory, an improvement which
could eventually help scientists
discover the origins of the uni
verse.
• After two years in limbo, the
University launched a new sexual
harassment policy. The policy
includes provisions for com
plainant confidentiality and offers
complainants more options for
informal resolution.
• The annual Big Game Bonfire
was canceled in order to protect
the re-emergence of California
tiger salamanders in Lake Lagu
nita, the traditional site of the
bonfire. Environmentalists said
the fire would "undoubtedly
cook" the salamanders, which
were once thought to be extinct
on the Peninsula.
• The Commission on Undergrad
uate Education got underway
with its sweeping, year-long study
of all aspects of Stanford's under
graduate program. Among its
areas of study were advising, dis
tribution requirements, residen
tial education and the feasibility
of a three-year degree.
November
• After one year out of the politi
cal arena, former congressman
and Law Prof. Tom Campbell
returns — this time he was elect
ed to the state senate.
• Provost Condoleezza Rice
announced another $20 million in
budget cuts over the next three
years. The cuts would come main
ly out of administrative areas, and
some weak academic areas could
be eliminated, she said.

December
• Joining several other universi
ties, Stanford rescinded its divest
ment policy in South Africa as
that country began taking steps
toward ending apartheid.
January
• Fearing budget cuts to already
strapped ethnic centers, students
hold a rally to show their support
for the centers and to protest any
cuts.
• An earthquake measuring 6.6
on the Richter scale rocked Los
Angeles, leaving 40 dead and $1
billion worth of damages.
• Stanford Engineering Prof.
William Perry was picked to
replace Les Aspin as secretary of
defense. Perry had spent the past
year serving as deputy defense
secretary.
February
• A 5 percent tuition hike was
announced for the upcoming
school year. The increase
brought the total University bill
to over $25,000 for the first time.
• Law Prof. William Gould was
confirmed to head the National

Labor Relations Board after
much stalling by Republican sen
ators, who accused Gould of being
too labor-friendly.
• Gecilia Burciaga, Stanford's
highest-ranking Chicana admin
istrator, was laid off due to budget
cuts. A University employee for
20 years and a resident fellow at
Gasa Zapata, Burciaga was told
that her job in the Office of Stu
dent Affairs would be eliminated
as of August. Her layoff sparked
anger, astonishment and protest.
April
• University administrators
announced that there would be no
cuts to the ethnic centers in the
first year of budget cuts, eliciting
a sigh of relief from students. In
addition, the Career Planning and
Placement Center was spared
from a planned $50,000 cut.
• In the ASSU general elections,
half of the 36 groups that applied
for special-fee funding lost; for
several, this was due to an unusu
ally high abstention rate. Eight
groups that received a majority of
"yes" votes still were not funded
because the number of approving
ballots did not constitute 15 per
cent of the student population, as
required by ASSU Bylaws.
• The Dalai Lama whirled
through campus, chatting with
professors and giving an address
on global responsibility.
• The California Attorney Gener
al's Office filed suit against three
former Bookstore heads for inap
propriate investment of Book
store funds.
• A Faculty Senate committee
headed by Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood introduced a sweeping
proposal to tighten the current
grading policy by reinstating a
failing grade, moving up the
drop / add deadline and limiting
course retakes. The aim, accord
ing to the committee, was to curb
grade inflation and to create a
more historical transcript. A mod

ified version of the proposal
passed at the end of the school
year. Most of the new rules take
effect in the upcoming school
year.
May
• A group of nine Stanford stu
dents filed suit against Stanford
over the Grey Interpretation, the
campus speech code that pro
hibits students from making
inflammatory statements based
on race, sex, religion, disability or
sexual orientation. The suit
claims the code violates both the
federal and state constitutions
and calls for its immediate repeal.
The code has never been enforced
since its institution in 1990.
• Protesting the University's
"open hostility toward minori
ties," Chicano students went on a
hunger strike in the Quad, pre
senting the administration with

four demands: the creation of a
community center in East Palo
Alto, a campus-wide ban on
grapes, the creation of a Chicano
Studies program and the rehiring
of Chicana administrator Cecilia
Burciaga. Four students struck
for three days and hundreds of
others skipped at least one meal
in support of the demands. The
strike ended after the University
offered to create committees to
investigate each point but Burcia
ga's rehiring.
• Stanford alumnus Stephen
Breyer, chief judge of the Ist U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, was
nominated to replace retiring
Supreme Court justice Harry
Blackmun.
• A group of students protesting
for Asian-American Studies spoke
out at a Faculty Senate meeting.
The meeting adjourned prema
turely.
• Six Stanford athletes were
charged with vandalizing the
"Gay Liberation" sculpture on
the west side of campus. They
caused between $7,900 and
$8,900 damage by striking and
pouring black paint on the sculp
ture and jamming a bench
between two of the figures. The
incident drew widespread criti
cism from the campus communi
ty.
1994-1995
October
• Stanford alumni and Silicon
Valley pioneers David Packard
and William Hewlett jointly
donated $77.4 million toward the
construction of a new science and
engineering quad. The quad —
with a total cost of $110 million
will sit west of the main Quad.

Five existing buildings, including
the Physics Tank, were slated for
demolition as part of the project,
while four new buildings are to be
erected. The gift was the single
largest donation in the history of
Stanford.
• After a year-long study, the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education unveiled a 64-page
report detailing its recommenda
tions for the future of Stanford's
undergraduate program. Changes
include the development of a
three-quarter science core and
strengthened writing and foreign
language requirements, as well as
a call for longer-term looks at
such facets of undergraduate life
as teaching, advising, grading and
the academic calendar. The Facul
ty Senate has spent the year
reviewing, debating and voting on
the report's proposals.
• After more than four years of
highly publicized investigation
and debate, the government
ended its indirect-cost dispute
with Stanford, dropping all claims
that the University overbilled it
by $185 million in research costs
over a 12-year period in exchange
for a $1.2 million fee. The contro
versy made Stanford the focus of
much negative press attention
and led to the 1992 resignation of
then-University President Donald
Kennedy. The attention on billing
practices at Stanford and other
schools also led the government to
create a new system of indirect
cost regulation.
• Sophomore Jessica Williams
was killed and seven other stu
dents were injured in a car crash
in Hayward. The students' van
crashed into a guard rail and over
turned near the San Mateo bridge
after they were cut off by another
car. In memorial services, friends
remembered Williams, a native of
Carson, Calif., as similar to the
sunflowers she loved.
• Students protested against Cali-

year's vandalism.
fornia Proposition 187 with a
walkout of classes and a noontime
rally in White Plaza. The proposi
tion — which passed in the
November election — makes ille
gal immigrants ineligible for
social services such as public edu
cation and health care.
November
• While Republicans swept
Congress in many other areas of
the country, the trend was less
obvious in the Bay Area. U.S. Sen
ator Dianne Feinstein and U.S.
Representative Anna Eshoo both
won re-election. Incumbent Gov
ernor Pete Wilson was re-elected
as well, beating Democratic con
tender Kathleen Brown, a Stan
ford alumna.
• Dean of Students Michael Jack
son and his wife, Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church Diana Akiya
ma, announced their resignations

from the University. Jackson left
in March to accept the position of
vice president for student affairs
at the University of Southern Cal
ifornia, while Akiyama planned to
pursue a doctorate and serve as a
lecturer at USC.
January
• Palo Alto police arrested two
men in connection with the Nov.
13 murder of Stanford graduate
student David Liu at a Palo Alto
apartment. At the time of the
murder — which police said was
motivated by robbery — the 23-
year-old Liu was on an academic
leave of absence while completing
the work requirement for a mas
ter's degree in product design.
February
• In response to the Commission
on Undergraduate Education's
report, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven announced
that departments in his school
will be required to come up with
minor programs before the 1996-
97 academic year. Though still
under discussion, minors would
probably require students to com
plete 25 to 30 units of work,
Shoven said. Faculty Senate
members were by and large
enthusiastic about the idea.
• Art Prof. Albert Elsen, an inter
nationally renowned scholar
responsible for obtaining most of
Stanford's outdoor art collection,
died of an apparent heart attack.
Elsen was also a highly regarded
teacher whose classes drew large
numbers of students.
• The Board of Trustees approved
a 5.5 percent increase in under
graduate tuition, slightly higher
than the previous year's 5 percent
jump. The increase — which
comes from a 2-percent increase
plus the inflation rate — brings
tuition for the 1995-96 school
year to $19,695.
• Stanford announced plans to

create a new interdisciplinary
program in Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity. The pro
gram will allow students to choose
a major or minor in Chicano Stud
ies, Asian-American Studies or
African and Afro-American Stud
ies. Much of the work behind the
proposal was done by two commit
tee formed to examine possible
programs in Chicano Studies and
Asian-American Studies in the
wake of the May 1994 hunger
strike.
March
• In a precedent-setting decision,
Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Peter Stone struck
down Stanford's speech code.
Stone ordered an injunction
against the Grey Interpretation to
the Fundamental Standard after
nine Stanford students and alum
ni brought a suit against the Uni
versity in May 1994. The group
argued that the code violated Cal
ifornia's Leonard Law, which
extends First Amendment protec
tions to students at private uni
versities.
April
• The Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office charged former
Bookstore general manager Eldon
Speed, former assistant general
manager Philip Chiaramonte and
former controller Patrick McDon
ald with grand theft and tax eva
sion, the first criminal charges to
be brought in a case sparked when
a Feb. 5, 1992 story in The Daily
revealed that senior managers at
the Bookstore were receiving
perks unheard of at other univer
sity bookstores. Speed and
Chiaramonte could both face up
to eight years in prison and
McDonald five years for such
alleged crimes as using Bookstore
money to purchase a house in
Twain Harte, Calif, and to make
personal loans.

• University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice announced that Stanford
would neither support a Universi
ty-wide boycott of grapes nor
allow administrative units —
considered to be representatives
of the University — to boycott.
The decision, in response to a
report released by a committee
formed after the May 1994
hunger strike, effectively contin
ued the current policy but gave
more University support to stu
dent education on the issues.
• University officials canceled the
traditional Commencement pro
cession in an effort to shorten cer
emonies and move the event stage
closer to the audience. Using
nudity and beer to express their
displeasure, seniors staged
protests over the demise of the
"Wacky Walk" until the Universi
ty agreed to let students hold the
procession if they so chose.
May
• After failing to get enough
pledges to fill 90 percent of their
houses with members, Kappa
Alpha and Beta Theta Pi lost their
houses to the Draw. Since the
University is reviewing its policy
on Greek housing, the change
could possibly lead to some
unhoused fraternities or sorori
ties receiving houses in the
future.
June
• Provost Condoleezza Rice out
lined $4.6 million in budget cuts
for the 1995-96 year, much of
which will be achieved through
holding allocations to the Univer
sity's academic divisions con
stant, without increasing for
inflation. Schools will also be
charged a "space charge" based
on the square footage they occu
py, as well as a 6-percent levy on
expenditures from restricted
funds.
