# Defensive dialogue
## US Secretary of Defense William Perry, a Stanford professor and alumnus, to deliver Commencement address 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Secretary of Defense William Perry, a
Stanford professor and alumnus, will be
the featured speaker at the 104 th Com
mencement ceremony on Sunday.
Perry received two mathematics
degrees from Stanford, a bachelor's
degree in 1949 and a master's in 1950.
He went on to complete his doctorate in
his home state at Pennsylvania State
University. Perry most recently worked
at Stanford as director of the Center for
International Security and Arms Con
trol; he is still a professor of engineering
and economic systems.
Hinting at the subject of his speech in
the spring 1995 edition of the Stanford

Observer, Stanford's alumni newspaper,
Perry said he hopes to use some of the
recent foreign policy issues he has dealt
with as defense secretary for his address.
"I'm thinking of talking about the
ethics of foreign policy, the ethical issues
involved in questions like, 'Do we send
forces into Haiti?' 'Do we send forces into
Bosnia?' " he told the Observer.
Perry said he will also encourage grad
uates to spend some of their professional
careers in government service. "I speak
to that myself, because I never set it out
to be, and I have never been, making a
career in the government," he said. "But
I've always believed that spending a part
of my career in service to the government
was an important thing for a citizen to
do."

After an eight-week search to fill the
place of the late embattled former Defense
Secretary Les Aspin, Perry was named to
the post on Feb. 3, 1994. The Senate con
firmed his nomination in a 97-0 vote.
His current priorities include dealing
with the shrinking defense budget in the
face of post-Cold War cutbacks. Perry
has kept a low-profile in dealing with the
issues that plagued his predecessor, such
as equal rights for gays in the military
and sexual harassment.
University President Gerhard Casper
selected Perry for the speaker from a list
submitted by the four senior class presi
dents. The only restriction placed on the
choices was that the speaker had to have
a Stanford connection, said Senior Class
President Eric Chen.

After graduating from Stanford, Perry
went on to have a diverse career in busi
ness, government and academia.
Working with the company he found
ed, ESL Inc., Perry also consulted on
technology issues for the Department of
Defense. President Jimmy Carter
appointed him to the post of undersecre
tary of defense research and engineering
in the 19705. To take on the government
position, Perry sold the shares to his com
pany, making him a multi-millionaire.
In his first job in the Pentagon, Perry
was instrumental in developing the
radar-evading stealth bomber and fight
er, as well as the laser-guided missile
technologies used in the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.
After Carter's election defeat in 1980,

Perry eaine back to the Bay Area as man
aging director of Hambrecht and Quist, a
high-technology investment banking
firm.
Ferry then founded Technology
Strategies and Alliances in Menlo Park, a
technology consulting and investment
firm.
When he returns to Stanford this
June, Perry plans to hold a colloquium
with his colleagues at the School of Engi
neering.
One of Perry's former colleagues,
Institute for International Studies Direc
tor Walter Falcon, said that Perry's
speech will contain valuable advice for
Stanford's Class of 1995. "He'll have
something useful to say," Falcon said.
"He always does."
