If You Like Shakespeare.

Stanford Flying Club!
Stanford to the Ashland (Oregon)
Shakespeare festival in less than 2 hours (in a
typical four-seat club aircraft). And the costs?
Only about $45 per person, while no
advance purchase or airline-style restrictions
apply.
Shakespeare and many other adventures in
the Western States can be reached in a
couple of hours, and at a surprisingly low
cost when you get a pilot's license. Most
Members complete our Solo Pilot License
course with 10 to 20 hours of flying time.
Two-seat planes start at $39/ hr including fuel,
and you only pay for actual flight time. You
can even take a lesson while flying to
Ashland, and at 10,000 ft view Mount Shasta
on the way.
Call for details, a free flying- time map, and an
information kit. Or try our $75 test flight.
You'll love it!
