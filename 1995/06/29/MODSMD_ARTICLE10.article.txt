# Toward a Brave New World
## Stanford celebrates the 50th anniversary of the United Nations â€” and ponders an uncertain future 
### Sonia M. Giordani Editorial staff 
As leaders from around the
world convened in San Francisco
this week to commemorate the
golden anniversary of the U.N.
Charter, Stanford has also taken
the time to reflect on the enthusi
asm that surrounded the birth of
the international peace-keeping
organization.
Yet, as the U.N. anniversary
has been characterized by a birth
day-party atmosphere, Stanford's
commemorative events note the
historical context in which the
U.N. Charter was signed and un
derline that much has changed in
the 50 years since.
A display at the Herbert
Hoover Memorial Exhibit Pavil
ion entitled "1945" seeks to bring
to life the story of that watershed
year in world history through the
documents and photograpns of
Hoover's Archives. One of its
eight panels is dedicated to the
founding of the United Nations.
"I wanted to portray the excite
ment and immediacy of the mo
ment by showing original docu
ments of the time" that cannot
quite be captured by secondary
sources, said Elena Danielson, a
Hoover associate archivist, who
worked with Exhibit Coordinator
Cissie Hill.
The panei includes original
documents taken from the notes
of C. Easton Rothwell, who joined
Stanford's Hoover Institution in
1947 after serving as the Secre
tary General of the U.S. delega
tion to the 1945 U.N. Conference.
Brave new world
Professor Emeritus Ronald
Hilton, currently a visiting schol
ar at Hoover, was a Stanford pro
fessor in the School of Humanities
and Sciences when he participated
in the 1945 Conference as an ob
server. He recalled the spirit of eu
phoria that pervaded the year
1945, as the world prepared for its
postwar period and set out to cre
ate an effective international
peace-keeping organization.
"The war [in Europe] was
ended, though Japan was still
fighting," said Hilton. "But we
were going to create a brave new
world There was a lot of enthusi
asm."
Yet, Hilton recalls that the
United Nations was divided at
birth, marred by skepticism and
lack of cooperation among the Al
lies.
"I witnessed the very stunning
final session of the U.N. confer
ence" on June 26, 1945, at which
the charter was to be formally ap
proved, he said.
The session included an unex
pected crisis when Russian deputy
Andrei Gromyko contested an ar
ticle of the charter, delaying its
formal approval.

" Gromyko's objection was real
ly an expression of Soviet suspi
cion of the United Nations,"
Hilton noted in an article he pub
lished eariier this ye? r
Current concerns
The difficulties faced by the
United Nations have not abated
since the founding meeting, said
Hilton, adding tnat the difficulties
may be a major roadblock in the
future course of the United Na
tions.
According to Hilton, as the
U.N General Assembly increas
ingly becomes the stage of acute
division of opinion among dele
gates, there is the looming possi
bility that the United Nations
could fade out like the League of
Nations.
The 50th anniversary of the
United Nations coincides with a
particularly devastating conflict
in Bosnia that may have tarnished
the reputation of the organization
in its peace-keeping efforts.
"If [the United Nations] fails,
as we obviously have failed in
what was Yugoslavia, is this like
[the League's] failure in Ethiopia,
when [it] could not stop Italy or
the German force?" asked Hilton
at a conference entitled "The
World Order: The Network of In
ternational Organizations and
Systems" held at the Bechtel In
ternational Center J.?.st Friday.
"Frankly, I'm skeptical about
[the effectiveness of] the U.N.,"
said Hilton, in an interview this
week. "It's loaded down with 185
countries, and only about 10 are
willing to take any responsible
role."
Many leaders, including Presi
dent Clinton in his San Francisco
speech on Monday, have under
lined the need for further reform
in the United Nations' organiza
tion and procedure, he said.
"The real question is how,"
Hilton said.
Mid-life crisis?
The General Assembly is not
the only U.N. body grappling with
issues of reform. Many of the
United Nations' affiliated organi
zations are currently trying to
cope with the changes the last 50
years have brought.
"This is not the same world it
was 50 years ago," said Prof. Paul
Basch, who teaches International
Health in the department of
Health Research and Policy.
For instance, he said, the World
Health Organization has evolved
from being a physician-dominated
technical organization that
sought to rid the world of diseases
to an organization that tries to
provide primary health care and
that focuses on social aspects of
medicine.
Like many multi-national orga
nizations today, WHO also faces
competition for financial re

sources from other international
organizations such as the U.N. In
ternational Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the World Bank,
which also affects the scope of the
organization, Basch said.
The 50th anniversary of the
United Nations should be seen as
an opportunity to take a serious
look at suggestions for U.N. re
form, said Sir Brian Urquhart,
former Undersecretary General of
the United Nations, who was the
guest speaker at the conference
held last week at Bechtel.
He added that such reforms
were needed to make the organi
zation and its affiliated agencies
more effective as well as more

timely in their efforts.
"God knows there's plenty to
reform," he said, citing such ex
amples as the Civil Service, the fi
nancing of the United Nations,
and Security Council procedure.
In reflecting on the past and fu
ture courses taken by the United
Nations, Urquhart said, "it is im
portant to see the organization for
what it really is, which is a politi
cal process and a political experi
ment which is trying to reconcile
the world of independent sover

eign states with the very surpris
ing new phenomenon of 1995."
"It is the most universal effort
to reconcile national sovereignty
with international responsibility
and human survival," he added.
"I think that in 50 years' time
the U.N. is not going to be judged
by whether it succeeds or fails in
Bosnia. It's going to be judged on
whether it's been able to have any
useful impact on the huge global
economic and social problems," he
said.
"There is one thing that every
body does agree on," said
Urquhart, "And that is that the or
ganization intensely needs to be re
aligned and made more effective."

Catch-22
Others, however, doubt that re
forms to the United Nations
would result in comprehensive
change.
According to Assistant Profes
sor of Political Science Kurt Tay
lor Gaubatz, global government
could threaten national sover
eignty.
"The Catch-22 for the United
Nations is that the more powerful
vou make it, the more [that] the
powerful nations will ignore it,"

he added.
"Does the world look different
than it might have without the
U.N.?" asked Gaubatz in reflect
ing over the United Nations' first
50 years.
"The differences are modest at
best," he said. The United Na
tions' efforts in peace-keeping, de
velopment and human rights
"would have been done one way or
another," he said.
But to many this week, the
"UNSO" celebration afforded the
opportunity to reflect on the suc
cesses. While Bosnia and Somalia
ended up as bloody catastrophes
with the world pointing its finger
at the United Nations, some 17

on-going U.N. operations in the
past five years have kept the
peace, and should be viewed as
successes, said Abraham Sofaer,
a George P. Shultz Senior Fellow
at Hoover.
Sofaer plans on holding a con
ference later this year on U.N.
use of force, noting that the
birthday-party atmosphere of
the past week may not be con
ducive to critical analysis of the
United Nations at its 50-year
mark.
