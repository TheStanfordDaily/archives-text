Joggers are not the only ones
drawn to the golden hills behind the
Stanford campus. In fact, joggers
might have had to compete with the

throngs of ambassadors and delegates
that once may have convened in these
hills if Stanford was chosen as the seat of
the United Nations in 1945.

Among the many issues debated at the
1945 United Nations Conference in San
Francisco was the location of the new in
ternational organization. As late as Octo
ber 1945, it was reported that the Bay Area
— including a 1,000-acre tract of land be
hind Stanford campus — was being serious
ly considered as the seat of the United Na
tions.
"Stanford has been proposed by many
conference delegates as site for the world

organization," Jose San
son was quoted in the
July 13, 1945 issue of
The Daily.
Sanson was a
i graduate student

from Nicaragua studying economics and
international law at Stanford on a State
Department scholarship. He attended the
conference as private secretary to the
head of the Nicaraguan delegation, Dr.
Sacasa.
"America — and I mean the entire conti-

nent of Columbus — is the
champion of the new era
and must be the center of
the future peace-keeping
mechanism," he said.
"Already San Francisco
gave the world a charter, and
Stanford will give peace to
humanity," he added.
Geneva was ultimately
chosen to be the seat of the
peace-keeping organization.
Among other considera
tions were the Berkeley hills
near UC-Berkeley.
