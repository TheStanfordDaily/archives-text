## Matches found for marrow surgery 
### 
Two matches have been found for a bone-mar
row transplant for Stanford sophomore Evan
Chen, increasing his chances of surviving a rare
and life-threatening form of leukemia.
Although two student-organized bone marrow
typing drives at Stanford typed more than 1,000
people, the two matches for Chen came not from
Stanford, but from Taiwan.

Chen was diagnosed in May
with biphenotypic leukemia; a
bone marrow transplant from a
compatible donor is needed to
save his life.
A bone marrow typing drive
held by Chen's friends on June 2
targeted minority students and
became the largest minority bone
marrow typing drive in the coun
try, with 641 people typed.

The second drive aimed at national publicity for
Chen's case, with a rally open to the public that put
him in the national spotlight. The second drive reg
istered an additional 341 potential donors from
Stanford and the surrounding community.
"I got a lot of press after the second drive, but
it's sort of calmed down now," said Chen. "I was re
ally amazed that people cared so much."
The "driving force," as Chen called it, behind
the typing drives was his best friend, junior Yul
Kwon.
"We're best friends; we were friends since high
school," Kwon said. Kwon and Chen have been
roommates throughout their stay at Stanford,
Kwon added.
A second round of chemotherapy proved effec
tive, leading doctors to believe that the disease has
gone into remission. Chen was able to leave the

hospital Tuesday.
"It was probably the happiest day of my life. It's
great to be home," said Chen.
Chen explained that each time he relapses from
remission, it becomes increasingly more difficult to
treat the leukemia; a transplant is the only perma
nent cure.
Doctors want to perform the transplant while
Chen is in remission to increase prospects for
success. One doctor estimated a 60 percent
chance of surviving the transplant, and from
there, an 80 percent to 90 percent chance, said
Chen.
The two potential donors are currently being
tested to determine which is a better match.
"There is no such thing as a perfect match," said
Chen. "There are so many proteins to type."
Chen hopes to go into transplant surgery after
"a couple of weeks," when he regains his strength.
If all goes well, he may return to Stanford by win
ter quarter.
Kwon reflected on the impact of the situation on
his outlook on life.
"It really has a way of putting things into per
spective," Kwon said. "When you go to a school like
this you get caught up in things like grades. An ex
perience like this makes you realize [that] things
like grades and the status of your social life or
whatever are all sort of transient. . . . What hap
pened with Evan drives it home."
The experience — though not yet over — has
taught Chen about human nature.
"It made me realize, with the drives and every
thing, that there is a lot of good in people's hearts.
I'm not so cynical about human nature anymore,"
said Chen.
