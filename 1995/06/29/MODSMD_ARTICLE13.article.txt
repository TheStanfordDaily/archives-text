# Unabomber threat disrupts U.S. Mail
## Post Office holds all out-of-state packages indefinitely, waits for FAA's further notice 
### 
As a result of a recent threat
from the Unabomber, packages
headed out of state from Stanford
and all of California will be held in
definitely until further notice
from the Federal Aviation Admin
istration (FAA).
According to David Mazer of
the Corporate Relations Office for
the U.S. Postal Service in South
ern California, the Postal Service
will continue to fly letter mail, but
will refrain from shipping pack
ages on air carriers.
But Horace Hinshaw, a
spokesman for the Postal Service
in San Francisco, maintained that
he had not yet been informed that
letter mail was being sent out and
received a notice early Wednesday
morning which informed him that
all mail was being held.
"All mail is being staged or held
at Air Mail Facilities in the San
Francisco Airport. No mail is
being flown out of San Francisco,"
Hinshaw said yesterday.
The furor surrounding this in
cident was catapulted by a letter
that was received by the San Fran
cisco Chronicle Tuesday.
The letter read, "WARNING.

The terrorist group FC, called un
abomber by the FBI, is planning to
blow up an airliner out of Los An
geles International Airport some
time during the next six days. To
prove that the writer of this letter
knows something about FC, the
first two digits of their identifying
number are 55."
The FC is a group that the Un
abomber claims to be affiliated
with, although the FBI believes
that he works alone. The nine
digit identifying number appears
on some of the Unabomber's let
ters.
As a result, airlines have tight
ened security and most have
waived fees for flight changes.
"We have facilities at the San
Francisco airport from San Fran
cisco, San Jose, Oakland and
Sacramento," said Hinshaw. The
decision affects all of California.
Only mail that requires land
shipment will continue to be sent,
although all mail is processed as
normal, Hinshaw said. He added
that the FAA will determine when
to release the postal service from
the hold.
