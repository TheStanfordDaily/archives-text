Lyons service awards
Bolstering awareness of Stanford's
public service quarter, the Dean of Stu
dents' Office has distinguished 11 stu
dents with the James W. Lyons Award for
Service.
Initiated in 1982 by then-Dean of Stu
dents James Lyons, the awards are ad
ministered twice a year to "acknowledge
the contributions students make to Stan
ford and the community beyond which
contribute to the quality of life outside
the classroom," according to acting Dean
of Students Jim Larimore.
Candidates are first nominated by a
professor or community member. Ap
proximately 10 awards are given after re
view and selection by a committee from
the office.
Larimore stressed that the nomination
process is open, and recommendations
can come from anyone in the community.
"Undergraduate and graduate stu
dents who witness the work of their peers
most closely are a valuable resource for
nominations," he said.

Cardinal red planet
Economic viability, international coop
eration and the latest science and tech
nology breakthroughs made for a success
ful formula for a three-day conference on
Mars exploration at Terman and Dinkel
spiel Auditoriums June 19 to 21.
The event brought participants from
Europe, Russia, Japan, various NASA
centers and major aerospace corporations
and several illustrious astronauts to dis
cuss the feasibility of manned space-flight
to Mars.
Adopting a forward-looking format for
the event, the conference sessions were
video-recorded and broadcast via Liver
more satellite uplink, to be received at
over 80 sites across the country.
Tuesday night included a public dis
cussion with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and
Tamara Jernigan, which drew over 200
"very enthusiastic people," according to
Bruce Lusignan, an associate professor of
electrical engineering and director of
Stanford's Center for International Co
operation in Space (CICS).
Lusignan said, "The real impetus for
the symposium was to help the United
States and Russia develop joint ambitious
space programs, working together and
aiding in the disarmament process."
Cooperative decommissioning of tech
nologies into non-military applications is
vital to both our space programs and glob
al stability, he said.
According to Lusignan, the debates
were fruitful and the conclusions promis
ing. "Contingent on international cooper
ation, manned crews can be put on Mars
in 10 to 12 years with existing technolo
gies.
The annual costs of a Mars flight would
be two-thirds what is now spent on the
current space shuttle program each year,
Lusignan said.
Parking rates rise
As Transportation Programs takes
further steps to keep University traffic
running, parking permit rates will go on
the move. The rate increase will take ef

feet Sept. 1, including the elimination of
previously free parking zones in 'Z' lots.
Parking fees for 'A' lots will increase
from $280 to $290 a year, 'C' and resident
student permits will increase by $10 to
$80 apiece. 'Z' permits in formerly free
outlying lots will now cost $40 apiece, ac
cording to Jeffrey Tumlin of Transporta
tion Programs.
The cost hikes are not out of the ordi
nary, Tumlin said. Original planning pro
jections called for a 14-percent increase
per year in permit rates, to compensate
for parking structure debts.
The actual increase this year in 'A'
rates was limited to prevent too great a
difference between permit costs. As for
the sharp rise in 'Z' permits, Tumlin
said, "All of the 'Z' lots were oversub
scribed."
"We stopped giving permits away in
January," he said. "It was clear we had to
start charging to control demand."
New parking lots are slated for con
struction between Stanford Stadium and
Sunken Diamond, and between the Haas
Center and Mitchell Apartments. Two
lots removed last year near Stock Farm
Road will be replaced to increase space on
the west side of the Farm.
Breaking ground in the direction of
transportation alternatives, the trans
portation office also announced improve
ments in the routing and frequency of
Marguerite shuttle services for next fall.
The mini-buses will now service more
pickup sites around campus and will con
nect with greater frequency with Cal-
Trains at both the Palo Alto and Califor
nia Street stations.
June also marks the addition of a new
Bicycle Programs Coordinator, who will
begin planning new bike routes, campus
wide bicycle safety programs and im
proved bicycle security measures.
Ford renovations begun
Major renovation of the Ford Quad
grounds began last week and is scheduled
to be completed before the new academic
year begins.
The area, located between the Ford
Center and the old Encina Hall, will be
transformed into a landscaped plaza with
oak groves, lawn areas and open recre
ational sand volleyball courts.
The plans call for the conversion of Ar
guello Way into a pedestrian and bicycle
mall, closed to through vehicular traffic
between Serra Street and Campus Drive.

"We wanted to incorporate Arguello
into a unified athletic connective element,
extending what has already been started
across Campus Drive at the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center area," stated Tom
Zigterman, a project manager with the
Utilities Division.
Parking next to the Arguello tennis
courts will remain accessible. Funding
will come from the Department of Athlet
ics, the Stanford Infrastructure Program
and a donation by Thomas Ford, the real
estate developer whose gifts made the
Ford Center possible.
Sculpture garden nears completion
A 10-foot carved pole which was kid
napped last fall from the emerging Papua
New Guinea Sculpture Garden was recov
ered last week, and the project is on
course to be completed by summer's end.
"Gutok [the artist who created the
pole] is very pleased his pole has been re
turned," remarked Jim Mason, who origi
nated the sculpture garden and is over
seeing current construction in the wood
ed area in front of Roble Hall.
After a wet winter halted site installa
tion and landscaping, the final garden lay
out was redesigned. A large donation re--
ceived last week will allow the final stages
of site construction to proceed on sched
ule.
Mason also stressed the unique nature
of the construction and its expanding
needs. "Much of our work here is highly
specialized. Most processes are one-time,
one-of-a-kind, and require a lot of original
fabrication. It's quite unlike building a
building."
A public unveiling will take place at the
end of the summer. The garden will be
managed as part of the Stanford Art Mu
seum and will offer continuing communi
ty outreach programs. The site itself will
have an extensive signage system to com
municate the stories behind the pieces
and the artists' commentaries on them.
Volunteer efforts have been a crucial
part of the construction process, Mason
explained.
"We have enjoyed an overwhelming re
sponse to the project, from both the cam
pus and off-campus community," he said.
"A large extended family formed around
this effort â€” many letters are going back
and forth today between Palo Alto and
New Guinea right now."
