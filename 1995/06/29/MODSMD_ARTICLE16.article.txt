# Solar car races with the sun
## 
### 
Afterburner, Stanford's third
and final solar car, revved up its
engines and headed for Colorado
on June 21 as the 10-day, 1,800-
mile Sunrayce 1995 got under
way.
The solar car race started in In
dianapolis, Indiana, and enters its
final racing day today, with the
finish line in Denver, Colorado.
"They started out pretty
rough,'' said Mark Godfrey Mun
gal, associative mechanical engi
neering professor and advisor to
the Stanford Solar Car Project,
which spent the past two years
building the car.
Mungal said he spoke last night
with senior Katherine Von Reis,

one of the students who built the
car and is riding in the race.
Afterburner suffered some
problems with its motor for the
first couple days of the race, Mun
gal said.
"The leaders accumulated an
advantage" as solar cars zoomed
past Afterburner, he said, but Af
terburner regained some ground
soon after.
"They were quite a bit behind,
but then they worked themselves
up to 11th and then Bth place,"
Mungal said. "Maybe we'll catch
7th place."
The famous Michigan team,
which is supposed to have spent
close to $ 1 million for the solar car

it raced this year, has withdrawn,
said Mungal.
Mungal also noted that Stan
ford has in the past turned out
the cheapest solar car, with the
highest placement per dollar
spent.
Other than the setbacks caused
by the motor, Mungal reported
that the team is pleased with the
car's performance.
"If [the students] had had an
other week and found out there
were some problems with the
motor," said Mungal, Afterburner
may have outdone its predecessor,
the SUnSUrfer, which placed 7th
in Sunrayce 1990.
