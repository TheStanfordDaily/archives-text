# Biehl case comes to close, killers sentenced
## Biehl's parents plan to continue rights advocacy through the Amy Biehl Foundation 
### 
As democracy reaches for a
foothold in South Africa, the ordeal
following the 1993 murder of Stan
ford graduate Amy Biehl is coming
to a close after a fourth conviction
for her murder and the abolition of
the death penalty earlier this
month.
Biehl's parents say they will con
tinue Biehl's work in the struggle
for democracy and human rights
through a foundation in her name.
On June 6, a judge in Cape
I own, South Africa, sentenced Nk
tombeko Peni, 19, to 18 years in
prison for Biehl's murder. Peni was
'he fourth member of the Pan
Africanist Congress to be convicted
for the crime.
We are glad that the South

African judicial system was permit
ted to work without the carnival at
mosphere of the first trial," said
Amy's father, Peter Biehl.
The Biehls' opposition to the
death penalty is consistent with
their daughter's position.
"Amy was opposed to the death
penalty, so we share her desires,"
Biehl said.
Biehl added that an 18-year sen
tence in South Africa is considered
"stiff punishment" and noted that
South Africa outlawed the death
penalty on the same day as the
fourth conviction.
Amy Biehl spent 10 months in
South Africa as a Fulbright Scholar
working toward democracy for the
nation.

Members of the Pan Africanist
Congress, a black segregationist
group, accosted Biehl as she was
driving friends home to the town
ship of Guguletu on Aug. 25, 1993.
Biehl was to have left South Africa
the following day.
The mob mistook Biehl for a
white settler, and stoned and
stabbed her to death. Her three
companions, who were black, es
caped serious harm.
Although Peni denied participa
tion in the attack, his conflicting
stories and the credible testimonies
of two eyewitnesses led to his con
viction, according to Judge Braam
Lategan.
The Associated Press reported
on June 7 that Lategan called Peni

an "enthusiastic and wholehearted
participant in the attack.
Lategan said, "You, Peni, must
take responsibility for every knife
thrust, kick and brick blow. I find
you guilty of murder with direct in
tention."
One person awaits trial for the
crime, al5 year-old boy who was ar
rested but has not been issued a
trial date.
Peter Biehl and Amy's mother,
Linda Biehl, plan to visit South
Africa on July 6 to award scholar
ships and grants in the name of the
Amy Biehl Foundation.
"The purpose of the Amy Biehl
Foundation is to support human
rights and emerging democracies
wherever they are at issue. We em

phasize, as Amy did, gender rights
and women's issues," Peter Biehl
said.
