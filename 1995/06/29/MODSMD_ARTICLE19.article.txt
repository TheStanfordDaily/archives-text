The whereabouts of Hongda Harry Wu,

Chinese officials.
"We continue to be very concerned
about him," said Hoover Deputy Director
Charles Palm.
Wu was arrested on June 19 as he
crossed the border of Kazakhstan into
China. The conditions under which he is
being retained are uncertain, Palm said.
Palm noted that Wu is an American cit-

izen and was holding a
valid U.S. passport and a
Chinese visa at the time of
his arrest.
Chinese officials have
indicated that Wu is being
investigated for possible
crimes, Palm said.
The State Department
said that the Chinese gov
ernment has alleged that

Wu had visited areas forbidden to foreign
ers in his trip to China last spring, accord

ing to a report in yesterday's San Jose Mer
cury News.
"The U .dHS-tste Department has re
quested that the Chinese government ver
ify his whereabouts and that the U.S. be
granted access to him," Palm said.
The Chinese government has not yet
granted the Department of State's re
quest, said Palm.
Wu was arrested in 1960 after denounc
ing the Chinese Communist Party and was
detained in several labor reform camps —
called laogai — for 19 years.

Wu was finally released in 1979; he im
migrated to the United States in 1985.
Since then, Wu has worked to raise aware
ness of alleged human rights abuses in
China.
Wu founded the Laogai Research Foun
dation to expose the Chinese labor camp
system. He authored two books about Chi
nese prison labor camps and testified last
year before Congress, before the European
Parliament and before the U.N. Human
Rights Commission.
