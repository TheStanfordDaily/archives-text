## Stanford Athletics honored as best in nation 
### Emery Chen Editorial staff 
The much-heralded Stanford
University Department of Athlet
ics received another commenda
tion when it received the Sears
Director's Cup.
Athletic Director Ted Leland
was presented the trophy on June
20 during the annual National
Association of Collegiate Direc
tors of Athletics (NACDA) con
vention in Las Vegas.
The award, now in its second
year, honors the university with
the best all-around sports pro
gram. The Cardinal garnered the
honor by tallying a total of 971.5
points, with points awarded for
placing high nationally in select
ed events.
"I am very proud of the fact
that Stanford is so successful in
athletics," men's tennis coach
Dick Gould said. "It is indicative
of the fact that Stanford supports
its athletic programs."
North Carolina finished a dis
tant second with 789.5 points.
Last year the Tar Heels and Stan
ford also took the first two slots,
with North Carolina walking
away with top honors.
With the five NCAA titles the
Cardinal won this year, Stanford
tied a record it held with UCLA.
The Bruins originally set the

standard in 1981-82, while the
Farm was the final resting place
of five national championship
trophies in 1991-92.
The Cardinal's crowns came
this year in women's volleyball
and swimming/diving and men's
gymnastics, water polo and ten
nis. Other sports Stanford per
formed well in included women's
basketball, tennis, golf, soccer
and cross country and men's
swimming, golf, baseball and
cross country. All nine of those
teams ended the year in the top
10 nationally.
The Director's Cup is special
in that it signifies excellence in
many sports. Stanford took top
honors despite having a losing
record in football and a good, but
net excellent, men's basketball
program. With 19 of 22 sports
garnering points for Stanford,
the depth of the Cardinal's ath
letic program is evident. Gould
credits the administration for
much of the success.
"The administration . . . sup
ported Title IX early on," Gould
noted. "We made a real strong
statement on women's sports
right from the start."
In addition, Gould stated that
the autonomy the administration
gave to the various athletic pro
grams was key to some of the suc
cess the sports have achieved.

The Director's Cup was not
the only award given out at the
convention. Sears and the
NACDA honored five students

who work in the athletic depart
ment in a support role with
$5,000 postgraduate scholar
ships. One such recipient was

Stanford student Rob Ross, a
graduating senior who worked as
an intramural assistant for the
University.
