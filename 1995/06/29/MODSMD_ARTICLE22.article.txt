U "T Toop Dreams" is a very
I I powerful movie. Many
JL -A. have decried the lack
of Academy Award nominations,
and still more have taken um
brage at the harsh treatment of
Arthur Agee and William Gates by
the high school basketball ma
chine.
I, for one, have not seen the
film.
The documentary is high on
my list of must-see films, and I
plan on renting the three-hour

plus epic some
time soon. How
ever, my failure
to view the film
has not impeded
my ability to cri
tique one of the
motifs of "Hoop
Dreams", the
exploitation of
student ath
letes.

A couple of days ago, I was dis
cussing the film with a former
teacher and friend. Doree, one of
my CIV instructors, was interest
ed to discover what I thought of
the film. Like I previously said, I
have not seen the film yet. On the
other hand, 1 have read many of
the articles written about "Hoop
Dreams."
Most of the recruiting and
coaching horrors probably would
not faze me.
Athletes and institutions of
"higher" learning have an inter
esting relationship. Athletes rou
tinely take advantage of schools
and vice versa. This is not going to
change soon.
For example, I know of a case
involving a top-ranked athlete
and institution which involved a
mutually beneficial short-term
relationship.
I knew a certain person when
we were both in high school. He
went to a rival school and he was a
nationally-ranked tennis player. I
was three years younger, and my
tennis glory mainly came from my
ability to hit a serve really hard.
We knew each other because we
both participated in the same ten
nis program.

That player graduated from
high school and entered North
western University on a full ten
nis scholarship. Three years later,
I entered Stanford on a partial
academic and financial aid schol
arship.
I'm not absolutely sure what
his mind-set was when he accept
ed the scholarship to Northwest
ern, so I won't comment on it.
Personally, I accepted Stanford's
offer because I didn't make the
University of Michigan medical
program and I also thought Har
vard was a bit aloof.
After his freshman year as a
Wildcat, my friend was ranked
second in the nation, and he de
cided to turn pro just before the
U.S. Open started. When my
freshman year ended, I had no ca
reer plans.
Todd Martin did not do espe
cially well at Flushing Meadows,
although after a year or two, he
did reach No. 6 in the world. He
currently is ranked 17th and is
seeded at Wimbledon.
Todd made the correct career
choice. He also shocked and disap
pointed his coach by staying only
one year.
No one I know was critical of
his decision. In fact, there is a cur
rent craze in mid-Michigan to be
the next Todd Martin. Life contin
ues, and some people are happy.
On the other hand, there are
many who blast the decisions
made by some of those drafted by
the NBA last night.
There is not much different be
tween Todd Martin and the bas
ketball players. They understood
that they were potentially of pro
caliber. Most knew that they
would not spend four years in col
lege. Most of the universities also
knew that the athletes would not
use up their full college eligibility.
Both used each other; that is
the way it will remain.
As long as people continue
their fascination with sports,
young athletes will be exploited,
and they too will exploit.
If you had a chance right now
to run a major business and were


Emery Chen
virtually guaranteed to make mil
lions doing so, would you take it? I
know I would.
I also know Mike Robbins and
Todd Bartels would. Both of them
signed after being drafted by Major
League teams, braving tough odds.
Robbins and Bartles each spent only
three years in a Cardinal uniform.
Stanford baseball coach Mark
Marquess most likely has to recruit
players knowing they might spend
only three years on the team. Some
of his recruits use a Stanford schol
arship as leverage for a bigger sign
ing bonus if they are drafted out of
high school. Two players last year
did so. One of them, Matt Smith, re
ceived over a million dollars as a
signing bonus, and the other ap
proached that figure. One more
took that route this year, with an
other potentially doing the follow
ing in their footsteps.
Cardinal football, the cash cow of
the athletic department, hasn't had
that problem recently, although
Steve Stenstrom was tempted. If
success ever comes Stanford's way
on the gridiron, expect an exodus to
begin.
Top athletes will continually
leave college early to make money
playing sports. It seems ridiculous
to call some of them student-ath

letes. Most are just plain athletes, or
possibly athlete-students.
Stanford will continue to suffer
the departure of top players. The
University will never force them to
remain the full four years; doing so
would cause them to avoid the
Farm, and a person like Summer
Sanders brings too much prestige in
her years on campus to give up.
Stanford University, as you
know, is considered virtually the
equal of the Ivy League schools aca
demically. What makes the Univer
sity unique is the sports program.
The Cardinal recently won the
Sears Director's Cup, which is
awarded to the university that does
the best nationally in a selected
group of sports. Winning such an
honor obviously enhances the repu
tation of the University, and such
success is intoxicating.
Is the academics of Stanford
cheapened by the emphasis on ath
letics here? Maybe a little, but not
much. Unlike the University of
Miami's (Florida) president, Ger
hard Casper hasn't been asked to
eliminate football because it is over
running the institution.
This relationship between
sports, athletes, money and institu
tions will always continue, and I can
only hope everyone understands
what they're getting into.

Emery's ultimate dream is still to
play Major League baseball for the
Pittsburgh Pirates.
