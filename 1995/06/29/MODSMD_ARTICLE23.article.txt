## Innovative Visions: Ansel Adams and a Modern Glimpse at a History of Photography 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh 
WHEN PHOTOGRAPHY
MADE its mid-19th cen
tury debut into the art
world, disapproving critics scoffed at its cre
ative limits, condemning it as a shortcut
genre that confines art to the visual dull
ness of reality.
An afternoon at the Ansel Adams Center
for Photography in San Francisco, on the
other hand, offers more than 200 reasons to
shun such criticism for its own limits.
On display at the Center are two ex
hibits: one that conveys the impressive
gamut of the artistic, educational and envi
ronmental achievements made by one of
the 20th century's most renowned photog
raphers — Ansel Adams — and another
that "rethinks" 150 years of photography.
"Ansel Adams: A Life of Art and Advoca
cy" is a small collection of images, memora
bilia, and personal artifacts that focuses
less on Adams' photography than it does on
his life and the ways his art influenced the
world.
Among the works the Center features
are the first snapshots Adams took at
Yosemite National Park at the age of 14.
The faded prints, taken from a Kodak Box
Brownie camera in 1916, are small in size,
yet panoramic in their subject's grandeur
— the face of Half Dome Adams made fa
mous. These pictures mark the beginning
of a career dedicated to promoting photog
raphy as an art form and as an educational
tool for environmental advocacy.

Among the "environmental" photos the
Center features are early images Adams
shot while on outings in the Canadian Rock
ies with the Sierra Club, a national organi
zation that lobbies for environmental con
servation issues. "Moonrise, Hernandez,
New Mexico" is another print that illus
trates the powerful connection Adams
wields between images of nature and advo
cacy for it, both of which he once said "are,
to a rather impressive degree, concerned
with the 'affirmation of life.' "
An often unacknowledged aspect of
Adams' work is his reliance on the power of
the written word to complement the silent
voice of his photography. Displayed in the
corner of the gallery space is the portable
typewriter he took with him on nearly all
his travels. By featuring such artifacts, the
Center adds depth to the visitor's under
standing of Adams' work and character.
Although the insight the exhibit adds to
Adams' life and accomplishments is ad
mirable, the splendor of his photography re
mains the most impressive. The 8-by-10 alu
minum camera he used to shoot many of his
classic images sits at the center of the room.
Its presence seems to insist that everything
else in his life was a periphery to his art.
The second exhibit, "After Art: Rethink
ing 150 Years of Photography," tackles
what would be a daunting task if the cura
tor's intention were to give the viewing pub
lic an all-encompassing synthesis of photog
raphy's history.
Rather than taking the Photography 101
approach, "After Art" — a selection of works
owned by Joseph and Elaine Mosen, two of
the country's most prominent collectors of
photography — looks at photography's past

through a contempo
rary thematic lens
that forges remark
ably clear connec
tions and contrasts
between artists and
eras.
As Senior Cura
tor Chris Bruce
states in the exhib
it's introductory
panel, "Instead of
concentrating on the
background of histo
ry as the blueprint
upon which current
art is built and to
which it reacts, we
have chosen to look
first at the veil of the
present from which
certain aspects of
the past have
emerged as salient."
The first work on
display, "Guest (A.
F.) 25,000 solar im
ages, 4:43 p.m., Ist
September, 1993" by
Christopher Buck
low, looks something
like a human glow
worm. Its meaning,
however, is much
deeper. The pho
togram requires no
more than the sun
and a multiple pin
hole camera (no neg-

ative) for its production. Although aestheti
cally, the image seems to announce some new
space-age style, the primitive methods used
for its creation forge a powerful link between
the old and the new, one of the exhibit's dom
inant motifs.
The range of the exhibit's images is enor
mous. From the summit of Mont Blanc to
the surface of Mars, from Walker Evans' fa
mous "Alabama Farmer's Wife" to a self
portrait of Robert Mapplethorpe as satanic
angel — the variety is stunning, but never
overwhelming. The collection's images, re
gardless of how different they might ap
pear, complement and comment on each
other in impressively unexpected ways.
The juxtaposition of works is often as im
portant as the images themselves. In one
case, a close-up of carcasses at the Battle of
Gettysburg ("Incidents of War: A Harvest
of Death, Gettysburg, July 1863," Timothy
O'Sullivan) is displayed directly above a
blurred photo of toy soldiers ("Untitled,"
1974, from the "Hitler Moves East" series,
David Levinthal). Although the messages
the images send are entirely different, the
obvious parallel of visual effects suggests si
multaneous continuity and discontinuity
between the past and the present.
Another of the contrasts the exhibit of
fers is between the dominance of mid-19th
century portraiture and the late-20th cen

tury postmodern practice of ordering im
ages into categories. This evolution away
from glorifying the individual to masking
notions of uniqueness behind stereotypes is
one of the most obvious historical trends
the exhibit portrays. A comparison of fa
mous French photographer Nadar's por
trait of Viollet-le-Duc (1876-1884) to an
arrangement of expressionless faces ("Set
of Five Photographs," 1988, Thomas Ruff)
draws a stark contrast between the eras.
Because the exhibit shows both similari
ties and differences between various styles
and techniques, each visitor leaves with his
or her own unique conception of how pho
tography has developed over the past centu
ry and a half.
