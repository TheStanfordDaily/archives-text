Batman Forever Q
Batman Forever. Or at least until Dolby
labs develops a new movie sound system.
This two-hour sonic and visual phantas
magoria is showier and louder than its pre
decessors, but lacks the psychological depth
— hell, the intrigue — of the earlier Tim
Burton efforts.
Director Joel Schumacher's less gloomy
Gotham is nonetheless a bleak projection.
Competing idols soar with the beleaguered
Statue of Liberty; "tribal" bands run wild;
corporate bloodlust threatens kindly profit

sharers; and dualistic thought (a
\l)j hard-pressed theme) fails in a com
d

maniacal edge (and weird looks). So his con
stant brooding falls lightly.
: include Batman's
Jove interest: a sexv psychologist (Nicole
Kidman) whose suggestive banter, ever
n< } fixafc^
enrtorm caricatures. Jim Carrey's hyperac

tive comedy finally finds an appropriate out
let in the Riddler, and the consistently skillful
Tommy Lee Jones (Harvey Two-Face) avoids
overexposure by painting half his face.
But wait! Why chase the bad guys — be
j. sides the fact that they're not as good-look
|ifig as our protagonists? The Riddler's seem
ll||gly innocuous brain-drain machine pro
flpdes little narrative cohesion, though plen
ty of opportunities for Hollywood's techno
logical bombast. While we expected that, we
didn't figure that this two-hour joy-ride
would seem longer than "Gandhi."
