## The 						Stanford Weekly Editor's welcome 
### 
IT'S MY STORY, and
maybe yours as well: Once
upon a time, summer
meant barbecues, lazy after
noons at the beach, camping
— one long, sunny weekend.
Then, gradually, insidious
ly, reality crept in. Camps be
came classes, classes became
jobs, and then suddenly, faster
than I could say "internship,"
summer meant 40 hours a
week in an air-conditioned of
fice — just like the academic
year, only in white shirts and
ties. I found myself asking
where the summer had gone.
We age and grow and our
lives inevitably take on more
gravity and complexity. We
learn adult words like maturi
ty, responsibility, ambition,
work, pain, tragedy. Some
times it seems that we just
don't have the time anymore
for the revelry of youth.
And so many us — stu
dents, faculty and staff —
who will be reading The
Weekly this summer are here
on campus to continue with
the routine of the regular
academic year. We have for
saken summer fun at the
MTV beach house for more
serious pursuits — taking
summer classes, working on
a research project, or com
pleting an internship. As
we're absorbed in these en
terprises, it's easy to say the
carefree days of childhood,
and the opportunities for fun
and exploration, are gone.
But in truth,the more seri
ous tack our lives have taken
in adulthood only makes such
diversion more urgent. It's
not, enough merely to work
hard at a satisfying job. We
need to use the short, precious
time we have to sample and
enjoy the many other things
that make up our vast world.
If you've been neglecting
your needs in this area, now is
the perfect time to start. The
temperate months of summer
re an ideal time for explo

ration, especially while we're
living (however temporarily)
the academic life. And Stan
ford, of course, is an ideal place
to enjoy your summer.
By all means, do what you
set out to do: ace that stats
course, complete your re
search. But don't mistake sin
gle-mindedness for resolve, or
diversion for vice. Give your
self an occasional break. Open
your eyes a little wider. Take a
road trip. Play some ball. Fig
ure out what activities and ex
periences breathe life into
your life, and find some time
to take them in. You really can
do this without falling into a
funk of Gumpian aimlessness.
Really.
In some ways, this is the
approach that and my staff
and I hope to adopt as we bring
you The Weekly for the next
nine weeks. We'll still bring
you up-to-date news, com
mentary, photography, sports
and entertainment as you
would expect from the sum
mer incarnation of The Daily.
But each week, we'll also try to
bring you a few surprises,
something new and different.
The more relaxed magazine
format of The Weekly loosens
some of the restraints that
bind The Daily during the reg
ular academic year, and it
gives us some freedom to ex
periment. We'll try to bring
you something interesting.
You can help, by reading, of
fering your comments and
criticisms — or even by joining
our staff and helping produce
The Weekly.
For now, remember that it's
summer. Find some time to be
fascinated. Thanks for read
ing.
