## It's time to think freely 
### 
Summer has begun. The sea
son loaded with the highest
hopes and the grandest
schemes has arrived. Remember
those conversations during fi
nals week, when a few minutes
of fantasizing about road trips
and camping out brought a tem
porary respite from school?
Well, let the fun begin.
Come on, don't get lazy yet.
True, I spent a decent portion of
this past weekend on the floor of
my room, seeking an imaginary
cool breeze while watching bad
television. But I ventured out
side and explored a bit. I may not
have been exceptionally creative
or spontaneous, but I had some
experiences And that's the en
tire point of summer. It's not
about what you do — it's that
you think.
Recently, I was at Tower
Records with a couple of friends,
narrowly avoiding a Michael
Jackson cut-out, when I saw a
guy wearing a floral patterned
skirt and a blonde wig, browsing
through the soundtracks sec
tion. At that instant I knew I
just don't go out enough. During
the school year I saw the same
people everyday — my draw
mates, the Wilbur food service
guy who methodically slid my

card through the register and
the Rollerblader. It wasn't often
that I experienced something
new.
That individual at Tower
made me think that part of sum
mer's unique potential is beyond
beach trips and park picnics. It
allows you to think freely and
not just for a grade. Summer
doesn't need to be about slog
ging through a job to make a re
sume gleam or about letting the
brain atrophy by nourishing it
with episodes of "Entertainment
Tonight." It can be about think
ing about things outside your
self and devoting some time to
them within your mind.
Stanford talks about the
growth and personal exploration
that occurs during four years
here. I rarely seem to notice it.
Quarters are neatly separated
into work-filled weeks sand
wiched by even busier weekends
that culminate in a careening
ride through finals.
While entrenched within a
quarter, I think about school,
tests, the future and how they all
pertain to me. But during the
summer, I control the learning
and the thinking. I don't have to
attempt to Xerox a diagram of

DNA synthesis into my brain; I
can just read the newspaper and
simply think. I can try new
things and be away from my
jaded views of Stanford's activi
ties. Summer is the time to real
ly live.
Friends have told me when I
bring up certain issues during
the school year and that they
don't think about them; "I don't
have time to think about that,"
they claim while they deftly hop
around their dormmates who
are clustered in hallways talking
about "deep" stuff. As summer
approaches, they look forward to
"not having to think." Well, my
response is to look forward to
thinking.
Bust out that paint set you've
used as a bookend for the last
two quarters. Set up a workout
routine to help you get in shape.
Just think a moment about
what's going on besides the trail
er on the screen. Forget about
what you can make for dinner
with some lettuce and frozen
chicken. Think. Summer has
begun. Good luck.
