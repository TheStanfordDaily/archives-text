Good Samaritans can
still be found today,
even in Silicon Valley
Let it not be said that chivalry
is dead or that humankind is
sadly devoid of compassion and
kindness. For I have borne wit
ness to what proves otherwise.
Earlier this week, I was on my
way to Jordan Hall from an off
campus site when my car, inde
pendent of my wishes, decided to
have a flat tire. As circumstances
would have it, I was in a time
crunch and had let my AAA mem
bership lapse.
I attempted without success to
change that stubborn tire and
soon resorted to greeting each
passerby with a helpless look —
to no avail. Seconds before I was
about to call it quits, a gentle
man, a hero to the rescue, gave
me a helping hand.
He worked quickly and effi
ciently until the job was done. As

he turned to walk away, I
thanked him , then asked his
name. "They call me John," he
said, tipped his hat and rode off
into the sunset. 0.K., O.K. — he
did not have a hat, he walked
away and it was not into the sun
set but into his office building. All
the more impressive that amisdst
computer software, electronic
mail and silicon yuppiedom lies
an unprogrammable commodity
— kindness. Thanks, John.

Outside cleaning not
an option for self-ops,
says housing official
In the May 31 editorial about
University cleaning in student
managed houses, the statement
was made, "Currently, so called
self-operated houses — the target
of the change — are responsible
for their own cleaning, which

gives residents the option of
cleaning their house themselves
to keep room bills low, or hiring
outside cleaners."
Hiring outside cleaners is
explicitly not an option (see
the Fraternity Housing Agree
ment published last Septem
ber), and has never been part

of the programmatic definition
of student-managed resi
dences. The option is for stu
dents to clean the house them
selves of have the University
do it.
