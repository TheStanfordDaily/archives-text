And you thought Jim Carrey was nuts.
As expected, Stanford students reached new lev
els of absurdity at Commencement '95. The for
merly controversial and chaotic processional pro
duced sheer raucousness Sunday as students
overtook Stanford Stadium to get their degrees.
Like a 20-ring circus, commencement showcased
talents from sword-fighting semblances of super
heroes to parading soon-to-be paupers with plead
ing placards like, "Now what?"
New graduates seemed to have returned digni
ty and discipline to the Bookstore buyback
counter; they hopped around the field during
potato-sack races, deflected squirts of silly string
with plastic Toys 'R Us shields, and tried to flirt
with those automated, gun-toting Secret Service
men. It was like "Big" meets "In the Line of Fire
with just a touch of "Reality Bites."
The Blockbuster generation.
One classy iguana sported her own mini-gradua
tion cap. Three bleary-eyed grads squeezed out a final
all-nighter to blow up monstrous helium balloons,
complete with capped and gowned dummies, to
launch skyward. Impromptu basketball and volley
ball games that could have doubled as an ad campaign
for Nerf — "a game for anywhere, anytime." Child
hood was taped onto headgear in the guise of Ernie
and Bert balloons, Jack-and-the-Beanstalk giant
sized caps, stuffed animals, and colorful streamers.
It was the most widely attended all-campus
party of the year.
University President Gerhard Casper, with his
sophisticated European beret, graced the podium
amid friendly chants of "Gerhaaaaard! Between
laughing at the battle cry of a kazoo and stopping
to convey the "Go girl!" cheer for the Pioneer fem
inist spirit from the vocal front-section graduates,




Casper eloquently managed to pay homage to the
processional and Stanford graduation history
using the alliterative "Wacky Walk" as a vehicle
for his comments.
Though he didn't propose es
tablishing a University prize for
the most unique entrance to the
ceremony, Casper joked that he
was considering implementing a
new standard of dress — football
jerseys — for the faculty, where
his number would be No. 9 since,
as he noted, he is the ninth presi
dent of Stanford.
While there was hushed awe
when Casper mentioned that
plethora of Stanford alumni oc
cupying the top posts in the three
branches of government, there
was a growing hiss when the law
graduates were asked to stand.
And in a display of decorum,
the black-robed audience was ap
propriately muted and respectful,
save the syncopated "Graduation
Bingo" winners popping up dur
ing the Secretary of Defense
William Perry's speech.
Perry's address coalesced
American history with personal
experiences, academic themes
with real-world issues. While not
directly related to the milestone
of graduation, his remarks
stepped beyond Stanford's often
isolated and insulated environ
ment to touch on broader issues
of American involvement in a
world without an Iron Curtain,
noting that "the ending of the
Cold War has opened a door and
the future is out there — waiting
to come in."
To a generation of students
often accused of apathy, he urged
activism and engagement while
explaining the perils of isolation
ism, echoing President John

Kennedy's creed that "one person can
make a difference and everyone should
try."

Ironically, perhaps, protesters of
American policy in Bosnia chanted slo
gans outside the stadium prior to the cer

emony and moved their group to the
stands to hold signs during Perry's ad
dress. Overhead, a plane trailed a sign
with the message "Perry: Bosnia Is
Dying! Lift the Arms Embargo."
Graduations are certainly beginnings,
but they are more strikingly the end. For
Stanford grads, the finality of the event
was tempered by spirited chanted and
creative goofs during teary good-byes and
last walks around the track.

Like our psychotic googly-eyed tree,
the Ringling Brothers-esque Commence
ment is uniquely Stanford. Sure, it
makes us, well, a little wacko. But there
are plenty of opportunities for serious
ness to come. Why start so soon?
Stanford grads have given a new look
to a formerly stodgy occasion, and the an
tics of each class seem to grow exponen
tially more crazy. Tune in for Commence
ment '96.
