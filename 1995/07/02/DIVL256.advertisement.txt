You'll Love Stanford Flying Club.
Glacier Park or Yellowstone are within a
morning's easy reach for less than $100
per person in a four-seat club aircraft.
Yellowstone, and many other adventures
in the Western States can be explored
within just a few hours at surprisingly low
rates with your pilot's license from SFC.
Most members complete our Solo Pilot
License course with 10 to 20 hours of
flying time. Two-seat planes start at
$39/ hr and you only pay for actual flight
time. You can even take lessons while
flying to Yellowstone...
Call for details, a free flying-time map,
and a free information folder. Or take a
$75 test flight. You'll love itl
