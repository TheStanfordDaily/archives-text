Letters to the Editor
Got something on your mind?
The Weekly welcomes letters from its readers. Letters will be pub
lished at the editor's discretion and are subject to editing. All letters
must include the author's name, phone number and Stanford af
filiation, if any. Submissions with more than five signatures
must designate a representative.
Letters should be turned in on a Macintosh disk in
Microsoft Word format with a hard copy of the sub
mission, or emailed to letters@daily.stanford.edu.
