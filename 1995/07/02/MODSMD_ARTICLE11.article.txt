# Students get their STV in fall
## 
### 
As a result of a pilot study done last year in Florence
Moore and Escondido Village, Stanford Communica
tion Services will install STV cable units in the resi
dent rooms of seven major undergraduate and two
graduate residences on campus.
The arrival of STV will make Stanford one of the
last major universities to install cable in student resi
dences, according to Assistant Director of Communi
cation Services Maureen Trimm.
Students will have the option to purchase STV
cable for a monthly fee; several dorm locations already
have the installations.
Undergraduate students will continue to have free
cable viewing in dorm lounges, Trimm said.
"What will be available in the lounges will be the
same thing that is available today," Trimm said.
Interestingly, only 15 percent of Flo Mo residents
last year subscribed to STV cable in the pilot study.
Yet, an interest survey released in February 1995
from Lagunita predicted that 52 percent of under
graduates would subscribe to STV if given the option.
To make the cable renovations cost-effective, 30 per
cent of residents must subscribe.
On the other hand, graduate residents in Escondi
do Village showed greater interest, with close to 50
percent subscribing.
As a result of the enthusiasm, Communication Ser

vices began installing 270 more STV units during the
course of the year, in addition to the existing 300.
Trimm estimated that the project will likely break
even.
The new system will be divided into three tiers, paid
on a monthly basis. The first, called SUNet, includes
educational channels, including The Learning Chan
nel and The Discovery Channel, and comes at no
charge.
ABC, NBC, CBS, MTV, ESPN, CNN and other
channels will be available upon purchase of the "sec
ond tier" for $20 per month.
The third tier, which includes The Movie Channel,
HBO, Showtime and a sports channel, will cost $9.50
a month for one channel, $17 for two, or $28 for all
four.
Thirty channels, some of which are educational,
will be available in residence lounges, including
SUNet videos, a library channel, the Stanford In
structional Television Network, and basic network
channels.
While some might worry that having cable in dorms
would adversely impact residence programming, Flo
Mo Resident Fellow Ed Frueh said he noticed no dif
ferences in residence life during the Flo Mo pilot pro
gram.
