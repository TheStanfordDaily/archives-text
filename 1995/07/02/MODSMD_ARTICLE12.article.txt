# Directory plans virtual phone book for next year
## 
### 
Stanford students and Net surfers across
the globe will be able to plug into the Inter
net this fall for a spruced-up, on-line version
of the Stanford Directory.
The paperback volume, familiar to the
greater Stanford community of 31,000, is
getting a facelift — in silicon.
The on-line Directory will take advan
tage of the World Wide Web's multimedia
capacities, fusing words, pictures, sounds
and virtual reality technology, said junior
Steven Rosenbaum, organizer of the Direc
tory's digital transformation.

The trendy, techno-sawy World Wide
Web is an extension of the Internet which
has caught the imaginations of schools, in
dividuals and businesses around the world.
Many features of the on-line Directory
are already provided by Stanford's home
page on the Web, Rosenbaum explained.
However, he said, "our goals are to pro
vide new services and better access to exist
ing information."
"The 'white pages' service is already pro
vided bj' 'whois,' " said Rosenbaum, refer
ring to the student directory information al

ready available on the Internet. "But the
virtual Directory will have a killer, high
tech, seductive interface."
He is currently negotiating with Apple
Computer and Yahoo for hardware re
sources and consulting services. "There's
amazing potential," he added.
Although he is working with the Univer
sity and outside businesses, he intends to
maintain student control over the project,
he said.
The on-line Directory will provide links
to other universities and to the Palo Alto

area. It will also unify otherwise diverse ele
ments of Stanford. Future services will in
clude a virtual reality tour of the campus.
Rosenbaum adds that students, organi
zations and alumni are already establishing
themselves on the Internet.
"There's a lot of neat things about the
Net that you can link to out there," he said.
"We'd really like to see what students on
line are doing. Student publications provide
a great deal of interesting content that will
fit on the Web."
