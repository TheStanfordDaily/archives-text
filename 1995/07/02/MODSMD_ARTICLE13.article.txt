# Firing of Med Prof shocks department
## Students, faculty protest, demand explanation 
### 
With almost no warning and
little explanation, Medical School
Dean Eugene Bauer removed
Surgery Prof. John Niederhuber
from his department chairman
ship last Thursday, throwing the
department into turmoil and
drawing protests from students
and faculty.
Seeking an explanation, a
group of surgery residents inter
cepted Bauer at his home last
Thursday evening before he left
on a trip to Asia.
The change in management
came as a surprise and sent shock
waves through the surgery de
partment, according to Surgery
Asst. Prof. Augusto Bastidas.
"It's been a struggle for me all
weekend to try to keep the house
staff together," Bastidas said.
Niederhuber, who joined Stan
ford four years ago from Johns
Hopkins, was credited by students
and colleagues with turning the
surgery department from a laugh
ingstock into an internationally
recognized program. Some said
his removal will damage the Med
ical School's quality and reputa
tion.
"Dr. Niederhuber.. . brought a
lot of national prestige," said chief
general surgery resident John
Rimmer. "We feel very disappoint
ed, hurt and upset . . . that he's
been sort of cut down."
Bastidas said Niederhuber
helped redefine the character of
the department.
"He's changed Stanford from
looking more like a community
hospital to looking more like a uni
versity hospital," Bastidas said.
"The firing of John Niederhu
ber was more than firing an indi
vidual; it was a statement of phi
losophy," Bastidas said. "It would
seem to me, in the absence of an
explanation for this act, that ar
resting Niederhuber's progress in
achieving the stated goals of re
building sends the message that
the traditional academic surgeon
is not what Stanford is interested
in."
"John Niederhuber was fired
for doing his job well and never
compromising his strong princi
ples," Bastidas said. "This change
is a great loss for Stanford Univer
sity, its Medical School and its stu
dents."
Bauer sent a two-paragraph
letter to students and faculty
Thursday informing them that
Niederhuber would be removed
from his chairmanship. Dr.
Christopher Zarins, the Medical
School's chief of vascular surgery,
was named acting chair.
Students and faculty immedi
ately sought an explanation. After
unsuccessful attempts to reach
Bauer in his office Thursday, 15
residents, some in white coats or
surgical scrubs, drove to Bauer's
Los Altos home to discuss the situ
ation before Bauer departed on a
10-day trip.
The residents conversed with

Bauer for about an hour, during
which Bauer told them Niederhu
ber's dismissal arose from an in
dustry-wide shift toward man
aged care, the residents said. But
the residents said Bauer did not
give a specific explanation that
would justify Niederhuber's dis
missal.
"We tried to pin him down . . .
but he gave us a lot of nonspecific
reasons," Rimmer said.
Rimmer added that the timing
of the change in management —
just days after the arrival of new
residents — was especially inap
propriate.
"This comes at the beginning of
the first few days of the academic
year," he said. "The first week,
and their chairman is axed," Rim-

The firing of John
Niederhuber was
more than firing
an individual; it
was a statement
of philosophy.'

mer said.
Niederhuber said his dismissal
took him by surprise.
"I'm devastated and puzzled,"
he said. He could not offer a clear
explanation of why he was being
replaced.
"I think the only words that
were used was perhaps my strong
academic vision wasn't felt to be
appropriate at that time," Nieder
huber said.
Zarins, who was appointed act
ing chair, said Bauer did not ex
plain Niederhuber's dismissal to
him either.
"I think Niederhuber has done
a great job in building an academ
ic department of surgery," Zarins
said. "I intend to maintain and
build on what he has done."
Zarins also said he will try to
build new links between the Med
ical School and the neighboring
medical community.
Bauer and other Medical
School and University officials de
clined comment on specific rea
sons for Niederhuber's firing.
Bauer said Thursday night that
Niederhuber's dismissal was a
step in an ongoing process of
change in the management of the
department of surgery. He de
clined further comment, referring
questions to Medical School Com
munications Director Don Gib
bons.
Gibbons also declined comment
on the reasons for the change in
management.
