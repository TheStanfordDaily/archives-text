## Forever Tarango: passion, violence and drama 
### Kyle S. Utsumi Senior staff writer 
"Always expect the unexpected with
Jeff."
These were the words of Stanford
men s tennis coach Dick Gould, speaking
about the truly unexpected actions of for
mer Cardinal star Jeff Tarango.
larango, a three-time Ail-American
during his three-year stay on the Farm,
turned the traditionally elegant and well
mannered Wimbledon tennis tourna
ment upside-down last week when he be
came the first player ever to leave the
court in the middle of a match.
Coming into this year's fortnight,
Tarango had never won a match at the
All-England Tennis Club, losing in all six
of his previous attempts. This year,
Tarango made it through the first round,
then upset No. 15 seed Andrei Medvedev
to set up his third-round match against
Alexander Mronz, the ranked No. 115 in
the world. Instead of taking advantage of
the chance to reach the round of 16,
Tarango, No. 79 in the world, lost his
temper and forfeited in what he called
"the biggest match of my life."
After a dispute with chair umpire
Bruno Rebeuh over a service call,

Tarango asked to speak with supervisor
Gilbert Ysern. When Ysern failed to ap
pear, Tarango sat down in his chair and
was assessed a point penalty. At that
point, Tarango threw down two tennis
balls, picked up his equipment bag and
walked off the court and into a broiling
controversy.
Tarango's wife Benedicte approached
Rebeuh, shouted in his face and then
slapped the umpire at least once before
walking away, she told the press. Later,
in a press conference, Tarango made ac
cusations that Rebeuh told people he was
"good friends" with several players on
the Association of Tennis Players Tour
because he gave them matches.
The former Cardinal standout did
make it into the Wimbledon record books
— Tarango was fined a record $15,500 for
his actions. Wimbledon officials fined
Tarango $10,000 for verbal abuse to the
chair umpire, $5,000 for failing to com
plete the match and $500 for unsports
manlike conduct for shouting "shut up"
to the crowd.
Gould spoke well of Tarango, who still
keeps in touch with the Cardinal coach
and remains a strong supporter of Stan
ford tennis. The Cardinal won two NCAA
team championships with Tarango play

ing at No. 1 or No. 2 singles from his
freshman year until he left Stanford
early to turn pro.
"Jeff was a really good, fiery, tough
player," Gould said. "He was a great team
player and a great recruiter for us. He
was a joy to work with — we had a great
time with him."
On the topic of Tarango's actions,
Gould said, "For whatever reason, when
someone who was once part of your team
or family does something to embarrass
someone else, it is embarrassing."
Gould continued, "I'm not being a
judge, I wasn't there, but you hate to see
that happen. Jeff has always been known
as a fiery competitor who was never
afraid to say what's on his mind."
Gould also brought up the irony of the
timing of Tarango's outburst. Tarango
set the date of his wedding last year for
the second week of the tournament be
cause he had never won at Wimbledon.
One year later, Tarango and his wife were
again walking down an aisle in front of a
large crowd of people. This time, instead
of a priest wishing them well, it is most
likely ATP sanctions which await the
couple.
Tarango has 10 days to file an appeal
of the fines levied against him.
