# Made for television — sports that should be seen more
## 
### 
I miss some of the classic sports you used to
get on ESPN. The Total Sports Network™,
if it has time to show some of the "ex
treme" events, surely has time to air some of

my favorite athletic compe
titions.
Here's a list and descrip
tion of some of the sports I
A'ish were on television.
More after this word from
my sponsor.
"Hippie. The new drink
made from the most acidic
stuff on the earth. It'll blow
vour mind away."

Luge, or ice luge as some uncouth youths
who only know street luge might call it, is a
event to air. Despite the fact that the
I nited States, as many might suspect, is not a
world superpower in the sport, luge, and its
:ousin the bobsled, should get more time on
: he airwaves.
There is something thrilling in watching a
man or woman in spandex flying down a nar
row chute at speeds of more than 50 mph. The
nherent danger in the event and the possibil
ty of getting a major ass burn if you're not
•areful gets my adrenaline pumping a bit
quicker.
Americans don't seem to flock to the sport

for some odd reason, despite the fact that
many amusement parks have a similar activi
ty, the water slides. This, however, has not
tempered my love for the "frozen water slide."
Because it's summer in the Northern
Hemisphere right now, Australia, or possibly
the Antarctic, wou Id be my two choices for the
possible location of Luge '95.
"Delta Delta Delta Airlines. You'll love the
way we buy. Official sponsor of the 1996 Gin
grich Presidential Elections."
Hot on the heels of hockey, another Cana
dian national pastime will invade the lower 48
states, Alaska and Hawaii.
Be on the lookout for curling.
Yes, curling.
There is no greater joy than watching your
rock land in the center circle on your final
push. The teamwork of the sweepers and the
knocking away of your opponent's two rocks
was a work of art.
I was first introduced to this lovely sport on
the CBC, otherwise known as the Canadian
Broadcasting Company.
I actually enjoy watching a curling match.
The stance of the tosser as he or she lets go
of the rock and holds form for a few seconds is
poetry in motion. I love viewing the (some
times) frantic work of the sweepers with their
brooms as they move down the ice responding

to sharp barking commands. And of course,
there's the characteristic clink of the rocks
hitting each other on a perfectly placed shot.
Maybe it's the engineer in me, the one in
trigued with angles and inertia and precise
form. Or maybe it's my fascination with the
two announcers as they diagram potential
shots on the screen, displaying techniques I
thought were only used on the AP physics ex
amination.
Despite all this, curling still can't be seen
on U.S. network television.
A man's gotta dream. Maybe they'll put on
cricket.
"Koreshtown Kool-Aid. A third more
cyanide than Jonestown Kool-Aid, and it has a
better taste."
Bring back Australian-rules football and
roller derby.
ESPN has gone downhill ever since these
two sports left the programming schedule.
These two athletic competitions gave legiti
macy to ESPN.
They also added a fashion statement that
can't be beat.
I miss the dapper guy who stood by the re
ally tall poles and marked scores with a stiff
one-arm signal, or the even stiffer two-arm
signal. I want to dress like he did.
Every part of his uniform was perfect. The

crisp white suit with the extra starch was
magnificent, but the white fedora was even
better. He looked like the Dodgers scout that
stands behind home plate measuring pitch
speed — but much more elegant.
The football players would be muddy, un
kempt and looking like general brutes, while
he would be the man of reason, the one who
controlled the outcome of the match in his im
maculate white suit.
On the other side of the fashion world was
roller derby.
To give you perspective, roller derby was
the precursor of Hooters.
Big, full-bodied women in hot pants and
tight T-shirts on roller skates bashing each
other as they went around a track.
They were the adolescents' and white
trash men's fantasy.
Maybe it was scripted, a la "professional"
wrestling. Nevertheless, I lived for those mo
ments when the women would get off the
track into the coaches' area and beat the crap
out of the opposing head coach.
Now that was pure spoiling entertain
ment.

Emery apologizes for any terminology errors
and hopes to get the Stanford In-line Roller
Derby League up and running soon.
