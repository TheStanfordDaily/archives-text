## SPOTLIGHT SPIN Natalie Merchant Tigerlily 
### 
Since former 10,000 Maniacs
lead singer Natalie Merchant
announced her departure from
that band last summer, fans have

awaited her promised solo release with a mix
of curiosity and trepidation.
Now, backed by Jennifer Turner, Peter
Yanowitz and Barrie Maguire, Merchant
has delivered "Tigerlily," an 11-track work
of beauty that will reassure old fans as well
as win over a few newcomers.
Merchant's music and lyrics on
"Tigerlily" depart noticeably from 10,000
Maniacs territory. The dark brooding of Ma
tt iacs songs like "Jezebel" seems to have
transformed itself in some cases into a wary
optimism, as in the album's uplifting second
track, "Wonder." Emotional exploration
has replaced social commentary. And high
culture references to Giuseppe Verdi and
William S. Burroughs have vanished.
But no, Merchant hasn't gone completely
Republican. Her familiar style remains and
echoes throughout "Tigerlily"; as always,
Merchant's vocals infuse poetic, often
gloomy lyrics with a vitality and beauty vir
tually unparalleled in popular music.
This is startlingly evident on "River," an

Natalie Merchant
elegy to the late actor from whose name the
song takes its title. Regardless of whether
one buys into the song's near-apotheosis of
Phoenix ("let the youth of America mourn,"
Merchant decrees), it's impossible to remain
unaffected by its power and grace.
And in the tradition of "Like the Weather,"
the album includes those obligatory tunes
that are grating in their saccharine catchiness
— and that also manage to be irresistible. Tied

for the "Candy Everybody Wants" Award this
time around are the already-overexposed
"Carnival" and the slick-and-coy "Jealousy."
One of the album's most pleasant sur
prises — at least to the ear of one over
worked Weekly editor — is "Where I Go," in
which Merchant adopts a folky pace and
adapts her strange, part-accent, part-affec
tation singing voice to confess moments of il
licit solitude, away from"the mad pace, the

hurry / the troubles, the worries."
While Merchant definitely moves in some
new directions with this album, those who
couldn't abide the music of 10,000 Maniacs
most likely won't be too keen on "Tigerlily"
either. But those who doffed their caps when
word came of the band's breakup will find
themselves captivated upon hearing this
stunning solo effort.
