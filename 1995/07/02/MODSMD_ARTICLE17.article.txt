## Smoke 
### 
Director Wayne Wang's densely
narrated "Smoke" unfolds like a
heady and patient conversation.
Adapted from Paul Auster's 1990 Christ
mas story, the movie recalls "Pulp Fiction"
's moral grappling and deft narration —
but does so with greater feel and without
the hip veneer. Not that it lacks the aes
thetic: drawn-out shots, credible acting,
and the übiquitous wafting fumes rein
force the nostalgic grit provided by Brook-

lyn's background.
The story, or stories, spin around
Auggie Wren's smoke shop. Har
vey Keitel savors his well-deserved
role as the wise and wizened shop
keeper whose life's work is a grand
artistic project. Every morning for
the last 4,000 days, Auggie has

photographed his corner store from across
the street. Paul Benjamin (William Hurt),
a dour writer-friend still numbed by his
wife's violent death, just doesn't get it.
"Every day," Auggie explains, "the light
hits the earth at a different angle."
Reinvigorated by Auggie's project, Paul

sets back to work. He also takes in a 17
year-old runaway (Harold Perrineau's
Thomas Cole) in search of his father and
hiding out with the accidental profit from
a bungled heist. Thomas' father is the bit
ter but repentant Cyrus Cole, played with
force by Forest Whitaker, and their re
union makes for a powerful duel. In the
meantime, Auggie's old lover has re
emerged, urging him to intervene on be
half of a pregnant and strung-out teenag
er (Ashley Judd) who might or might not
be his daughter. Like the others, he must
improvise a tenuous morality to guide his
actions.

"Smoke" plays with the tales we tell
ourselves and each other. In this well-sto
ried world, everyone is both huckster and
sucker and only narrative force, as exem
plified by Auggie's project, can structure
an arbitrary world. Where does this leave
morality—the film's principal concern?
As another form of art. Where does this
leave our movie? As a slowed-down "Pulp
Fiction" with lots of sweaty gray T-shirts
and an equally hip conclusion. But the ef
fort is honest, so we recommend that you
go see it.
