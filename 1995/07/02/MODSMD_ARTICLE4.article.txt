Reduce house fees
and reflect changes
in house activities

With the cost of housing
the way it is now in
Palo Alto and neigh
boring cities and the difficulty
in finding it, students often
find summer housing both
convenient and economical.
This summer is no exception,
with many students living in
the Florence Moore dorms and
the apartments in Mirrielees.
Although summer housing
may seem attractive to most of
these students for those rea
sons, it may not be the best
deal around. Not including a
meal plan, the total room
charge for students living in
summer housing comes to
about $1,000.
Although this may seem
like a reasonable price, if the
same student was to stay here
during the fall quarter, or even
the winter quarter or spring
quarter, there would be virtu
ally no change in the price.
This should not come en
tirely as a surprise. Students
here for the summer still re
main in the same dorms,
which still have to cleaned and
maintained the same way. The
only difference is that the
weather is a little warmer and
the sun a little brighter.
But that isn't entirely true.
While the summer quarter is
shorter than the other acade
mic quarters, it comes with re
duced room bills. At the same
time, while the summer quar
ter comes with reduced activi
ties, there is no change in the
house fee.
The University summer
room bill is corrected for its
length. In Florence Moore,
students are charged $1,112
for a ten-week summer con
tract. During the fall quarter,
which begins Sept. 24 and ends

Dec. 16, the room bill totals
$1,198. So, there is a change in
price between the two quar
ters.
Although the longer quar
ters are slightly more expen
sive, summer housing still
comes with reduced dorm ac
tivities. In addition to paying
the room bill, students also
have to pay almost $30 a quar
ter for house activities â€” even
in the summer. While the room
payment pays for the room it
self, the house fee pays for ac
tivities.
Either on campus, or in the
dorms, there is a drastic reduc
tion in student activities.
Whatever the cause, students
over the summer do not partic
ipate in dorm activities, and as
a result there are very few ac
tivities to begin with. In a way,
it is a vicious cycle.
In Florence Moore, for ex
ample, an extremely small
percentage of students attend
ed house meeting. One resi
dent assistant keeps his door
locked most of the time and
hasn't bothered to put up
name plates. While it is not re
quired for an RA to be ener
getic, it just demonstrates the
lack of enthusiasm for activi
ties.
Even with the reduction in
activities, the house fee still re
mains on the University room
and board bill. This means
that students are paying the
same amount for activities
which do not exist in the sum
mer quarter.
While the University has
taken steps already to correct
for the time differences be
tween quarters, it has not yet
taken the same steps to adjust
for the difference in activities.
The University has to be weary
of overcharging students. At
the very least, the house fee
should be reduced, or there
should be a greater emphasis
on encouraging dorm-spon
sored activities with the house
fee.
