HEROES ARE IN demand.
Whether they take the
form of a soaring hoops
star tattooed with sponsor logos
or that of a group of overactive,
color-coordinated martial arts
experts, the logic remains the
same; we cannot shake our ob
session with heroes. Some ob
servers claim that society's rav
enous appetite for idols stems
from the surrounding moral and
ethical wasteland and escapism
allows us to abandon the times.
I think its not so much the de
mand but our selection of heroes
that requires attention. Flipping
through a face-book of American
cultural icons, I see faces twist
ing and molding into the flickers
on the television screen today,
and that's not a pretty sight.
Amid this most nationalistic
of holidays, I take a moment to
look away from the fireworks
blossoming above to consider the
heroes that exist now. Who and
where are the legendary figures
that will be recorded in the years
ahead as significant? As my mind
bounces across the realms of pol
itics, current events and enter
tainment, one thing appears
clear — the prerequisites for so
ciety's designation of a hero have
changed much since the days of
Washington and Jefferson.
At one time, individuals capti

vated America's notice through
performance — they gave stir
ring oratories, made firm judg
ments in court and smacked
fastballs into the bleachers to
win games. Today, anyone can
gain celebrity status and a fan
club just by mere association to
someone of note. "Later on
tonight's program, we interview
the former roommate of the ex
spouse to the now-infamous star
. . . stay tuned for details."
I am not implying that all
Americans gobble up the fatty
dishes served daily by the media,
those consisting of shreds of
news laden with mountains of
sordid sound bites and generous
helpings of video from hidden
cameras. But somehow mem
bers of the American public
don't just find the unforgettable
people attractive, but also some
other individuals.
When notorious criminals of
yesteryear landed behind bars,
people sighed in relief. Today,
they send them fan mail and
print trading cards with their
likenesses. A former heavy
weight champion emerges from
prison and basks in the cheers of
hundreds of spectators. I wish I
could pose some analogy that in
volves turning tables, but the re
ality is that the table is gone.
What was once considered

valiant and laudable is boring.
We want the "bad boy" — the
person who threatens the cam
eraman and laughs at responsi
bility. The actions may not be
"right," but hey, they're inter
esting to watch.
Perhaps we have asked too
much of our heroes, and now we
expect less than ever before.
Armed with minute attention
spans and some underlying de
sire to deride those perched
above Fame's tower, we pound
away at virtuous exteriors, hop
ing for miscues, almost expect
ing them. Upon finding them, we
quickly move on.
We eventually find heroes
thriving within the land of
make-believe, and project them
into reality. Ask the University
of Alabama how many calls they
received by people wanting to
know what year Forrest Gump
played football there. Unfortu
nately, we are left with idols who
did not exist and heroics never
performed. Every era has a dis
tinct list of notable achiever and
it would be nice if this one didn't
feature filmographies or arrest
records next to each name.

Dave looks forward to seeing hi
hero later thismonth.
