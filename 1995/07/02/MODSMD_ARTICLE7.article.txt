# Midsummer Night's Mozart
## Stanford rocks the Fourth with fireworks and Amadeus 
### 
As enjoyable and traditionally American as a
slice of homemade apple pie, Monday night's
"Midsummer Mozart Festival and Fireworks
Spectacular" enchanted an audience of more than
5,000 at Stanford's Frost Amphitheater.
The event kicked off this year's Independence
Day celebrations with an evening of spirited music
under a darkening, starry sky.
Music director and conductor George Wolfgang
Cleve led this year's festival, which featured bassoon
soloist Rufus Olivier in Mozart's Concerto for Bas-

soon and Orchestra in B-flat
major. Also performed was an
Overture to Oberon by Carl
von Weber; Mendelssohn's
Symphony No. 4, "The Ital
ian Symphony"; and Han
del's Music for the Royal Fire
works.
Families with members
young and old packed the am
phitheater early, so that the
lush grass of the grounds
could not be seen under a gi
gantic patchwork of bright,
multi-colored blankets;
champagne, strawberries and
sandwiches were passed out
to eager hands from wicker
picnic baskets and ice chests.
Others, attracted by the

aroma of barbecued chicken and hot dogs, made their
way through the throng of feasting people and head
ed for the vendors.
Children posed playfully in front of Mom and
Dad's cameras, with the holiday's red, white and
blue of bobbing balloons and waving flags in the
background.
Cleve began the performance with a rousing ren

dition of the "Star Spangled Banner." Conducting
without the score, a charismatic Cleve reveled in the
charged atmosphere of the orchestra playing at full
tilt and added his own energy to the performance
with his furrowed brows and occasional foot-stomp
ing.
Cellist Kelly Lawyer admiringly described Cleve
as one of the world's foremost conductors who pos
sesses a wonderful musicaiity.
"He always conveys exactly what he wants,"
Lawyer said.

The intermission
was followed by soloist
Rufus Olivier's perfor
mance of Mozart's bas
soon concerto. Olivier daz
zled the audience with a
two-minute unaccompa
nied solo during which he
produced buoyant, danc
ing phrases in a call-and
response fashion from his
instrument's different
registers, combined with
wonderfully spaced si
lences.
Cleve encouraged
the audience to break with
the convention of keeping
silence between move-

ments, and after he asked
the listeners to "go for it,"the amphitheater erupted
into shouts and whistles.
The evening's remarkable festivities were closed
by the audience clapping in time to "Stars and
Stripes Forever," while against the backdrop of a
lighted Hoover Tower, roman candles lit the night
sky with sparkling showers of red, white and blue.
