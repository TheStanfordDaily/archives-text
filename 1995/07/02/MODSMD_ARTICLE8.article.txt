# Harry Wu: One man's odyssey
## Stanford waits as two governments grapple over the detention of a Hoover research fellow 
### Jim Luh Editorial staff 
Half a world away from hot dogs, fire
works and marching bands, human rights
activist and Hoover Institution Research
Fellow Hongda Harry Wu celebrated his
Fourth of July detained by Chinese author
ities in Xinjiang Province in northwest
China.
Tensions have escalated over the past
two weeks between the United States and
China as Chinese officials have rebuffed re
peated requests by U.S. officials to see Wu,

who is an American
citizen.
Meanwhile, at
home, family, friends
and colleagues spent
the holiday weekend
anxiously awaiting
any word on Wu's lo
cation or condition,
hoping for the best
and fearing the worst.
Wu's detention is
particularly alarming
in light of his past ac
tivism. Wu, 58, has
been an outspoken
critic of the Chinese
government and has
made several trips to

China to document human rights abuses in
the Chinese prison-labor camps, or "laogai,"
where he spent 19 years as a political pris
oner. Many fear the Chinese government
will seek retribution while they hold Wu in
custody.
Dangerous game
For 18 days, the conflict has proceeded as
an exercise in diplomatic brinkmanship,
with Wu's liberty and safety and the future
of U.S.-China relations all apparently at
stake.
But despite exchanges at the top levels of
both governments, U.S. officials have made
little progress in arranging Wu's safe re
turn. Indeed, they have not yet been allowed
to visit Wu and check on his condition.
State Department spokesperson Chris
tine Shelly announced at a June 26 press
briefing that Chinese authorities had appre
hended Wu and a colleague, North Carolina
law student Sue Howell, on June 19 as they
crossed the border between China and
Kazakhstan. The State Department has
confirmed that Wu had a valid U.S. passport
and a Chinese visa.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry informed
the American Embassy in Beijing of Wu's
detention on June 23, in accordance with a

access and have been

nese unreasonable, in

four-day limit for notification that is pre
scribed by consular agreement between the
United States and China.
But, in violation of an additional require
ment that U.S. officials be granted access to
a detained citizen within 48 hours of notifi
cation, the Chinese refused to allow U.S. of
ficials any contact with Wu.
Howell was released on June 23 and has
returned to the United States. She appeai ed
at a press conference last week with Wu's
wife, Ching-Lee Wu.
Congress quickly joined them in demand
ing Wu's release.

The House of
Representatives
approved a unani
mous resolution
last Thursday
night condemning
Wu's detention
and demanding
that China imme
diately grant ac
cess to him.
The Senate
passed a similar
resolution the fol
lowing day. But
the legislative and
diplomatic effort
"doesn't seem to
have much of an ef-

feet," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said Friday.
Jeff Fiedler, a director of Wu's Laogai Re
search Foundation, said Saturday that the
Chinese government's refusal to allow ac
cess to Wu was grounds for serious concern
about Wu's condition.
The 48-hour deadline applies to the first
visit by consular officials, but after that,
Fiedler said, the consular agreement does
not require a second visit for another
month. The Chinese have refused to con
cede one visit to buy themselves another
month with Wu, Fiedler said, and that sug
gests the Chinese might be hiding some
thing — perhaps some harm that has befall
en Wu.
"What's the big deal?" Fiedler said.
"They seem to be playing a game here."
Over the weekend, the State Department
dispatched a representative to Horgas, a
town near the Chinese-Kazakh border, to
investigate reports that Wu was being held
in the Karamay Guest House there, accord
ing to State Department spokesman David
Johnson. Local officials said they had no
knowledge of Wu's whereabouts, Johnson
said.
Johnson added that the State Depart
ment official also located and visited a hotel

called Karamay, but picked up no leads on
Wu. The official has returned to the city of
Urumqi to await instructions.
The Chinese government protested the
consular official's inquiries. On Monday,
the Chinese Foreign Ministry released a
statement saying "the serious difficulties
facing Sino-U.S. relations," including Harry
Wu's detention, "are the sole making of the
U.S. government."
"We reject that," Johnson said. "We
asked for consular access and have been met
with a stone wall. . . . We had no other
choice."
Chinese officials have not announced any
formal charges against Wu, Johnson said.
Discussions have been proceeding at the

top levels of both governments. On Monday,
Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff met
with the Chinese charge d'affaires in Wash
ington.
And yesterday, Johnson said, the U.S.
charge d'affaires in Beijing, Scott Hallford,
met with the Chinese foreign minister to
seek higher-level discussions.
But the discussions have so far proved
fruitless, and hopes of Wu's return have not
increased, Johnson said.
"We're finding the actions of the Chinese
unreasonable, inexcusable," he said.
Johnson added that there are as yet no
plans for further action, aside from continu
ing discussions and stepping up diplomatic
pressure.

"We're doing everything we can through
diplomatic channels," Johnson said. "We ex
pect the Chinese to comply."
Patience and hope at home
Friends and colleagues at home in the
United States have been anxiously waiting
for word of Wu's condition, though hopes
are growing grim.
In Wu's hometown of Milpitas, the local
city government tied yellow ribbons at City
Hall, vowing not to remove them until Wu
comes home. But while the ribbons help ex
press Milpitas' message of hope and solidar
ity, they also painfully underscore that it is
anyone's guess when Wu will return.
"I'm hoping to hear what happened to
him exactly, because holding him in deten
tion . . . incommunicado makes people won
der whether this is like holding a hostage,"
said Hoover Consultant Yuan-li Wu, who is
not related to Harry Wu.
"Knowing what is customary practice
over there, I would be concerned for his per
sonal safety," he said. "People don't realize
what could be done."
Yuan-li Wu said Harry has braved the
dangers of returning to China out of a sense
of duty. He said Harry feels obligated to tell
the story of the Chinese labor-camp system.
"If you don't do it yourself, how can any
body else do it?" he said, explaining Harry
Wu's reasoning. "Freedom has to be earned.
... It doesn't just come to you, especially if
you lost it."
Another Hoover colleague, Senior Fellow
and East Asian Collection Curator Ramon
Myers, was also troubled by China's refusal
to grant access to Wu and the possibilities of
what might happen to him in custody.
"They're a thorn in the side of the gov
ernment," Myers said of Wu and other expa
triate dissidents. "[China] would like to
make an example of Harry Wu."
"In the eyes of that government, he has
broken laws," Myers said. "He's gotten in
formation that that regime would claim was
illegal."
Myers worried that China would contin
ue to delay negotiations for Wu's release.
"I'm sure [the State Department! has
been applying the maximum pressure it has
— but what pressure does it have?" he said.
"All you can do is bombard [China] with re
quests."
Myers said he and other friends had
pleaded with Wu not to return to China.
"He just couldn't be talked out of it,"he
said. "He's a very willful person who has his
own agenda."
The Hoover Institution is also doing its
part to speed Wu's return, according to

Deputy Director Charles Palm.
"The Hoover Institution is cooperating
with the Department of State," Palm said.
Palm declined further comment on the
nature and extent of any assistance Hoover
might be providing the State Department.
Everyone is painfully aware that the last
word of Wu's condition dates from June 23,
when Howell was released. Howell reported,
in Fiedler's words, that at that time "he was
fine, and eating — and ready."
Rough diplomatic waters
Wu's detention in China comes at a time
when the always-turbulent relationship be-

'Knowing what is custom
ary practice over there, I
would be concerned for his
personal safety People
don't realize what could be
done.'
— Yuan-// Wu

tween the United States and China are
growing particularly tense. In some ways,
Wu's detention can be viewed as a result of,
and a next step in, the recent deterioration
of U.S.-China relations.
Relations between the two nations have
taken a turn for the worse since the United
States granted Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, a visa to attend a reunion at Cor
nell University last month. Lee's visit ended
a 16-year ban on Taiwanese leaders visiting
the United States and signaled a step by
Washington toward expanding relations
with Taiwan.
China maintains Taiwan as a province of
its own and rejects claims to the island's in
dependence. The United States officially
recognizes China's dominion over Taiwan
and does not maintain formal diplomatic re
lations with Taiwan.
The United States stressed that granting
Lee a visa did not alter that policy. The move
nevertheless affronted the Chinese govern
ment and sent U.S.-China relations into tur
moil.
Last month, the Chinese government
again jailed pro-democracy leader Chen
Ziming, who was released last year at Presi
dent Clinton's request.
China also recalled its ambassador from
Washington and has delayed its approval of

the new U.S. ambassador to China, James
Sasser. Diplomatic relations between the
two countries were thus reduced to the
lower charge d'affaires level.
In addition, the Chinese government has
made overtures in the past month toward
improving relations with nations the United
States views as hostile, including Iran and
Iraq. China made oil purchasing deals with
Iran after the U.S. announced an embargo
on Iranian oil, and according to Central In
telligence Agency reports, China has deliv
ered nuclear arms components to Iran and
Pakistan.
Captive for 19 years
Wu has published two books about the
Chinese labor camps where he was impris
oned for 19 years. In 1992, he published
"Laogai — the Chinese Gulag." Last year,
Wu published "Bitter Winds," a memoir of
his imprisonment in the labor camps.
According to his account in "Bitter
Winds," Wu was born Wu Hongda in Shang
hai in 1937; as a youth he got the English
name "Harry" from a Jesuit priest. While a
student in 1957, Wu voiced his criticisms of
the Chinese Communist Party, responding
to Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-
Tung's call to "let a hundred flowers bloom
and let a hundred schools of thought con
tend."
But Wu's criticisms were not well re
ceived, and he was branded a "counterrevo
lutionary rightist" and an enemy of the peo
ple.
Wu arranged to escape China across the
Burmese border, but the plans fell through
when authorities apprehended one of his co
horts. In 1960, Wu was arrested and sen
tenced to "re-education" in a labor-reform
camp.
Wu and other political prisoners in the
camps endured disease, starvation, harsh
weather, isolation and physical abuse by
guards and fellow inmates. Meanwhile, they
were forced to work grueling hours in fields,
factories and mines.
Wu was finally released in 1979. In 1985,
he obtained a passport and left China for the
United States. Though he had a chance to
put the past behind him and begin a new life,
he grew increasingly eager to tell his story
and expose the laogai system. To that end,
he joined the Hoover Institution in 1988 and
established the Laogai Research Founda
tion in 1991.
Return to China
Wu first returned to China in 1991, ac
companied by his wife on a mission to docu
ment conditions in China's labor camps.

Though aware of the risks of returning, Wu
could not stay away.
He explained his reasons in an epilogue to
his book:
"Even though I had wanted to forget the
suffering of the past after arriving in the
United States and had wanted to heal the
wounds in my heart, the 19 years of sorrow

'Even though I had wanted
to forget the suffering of
the past after arriving in the
United States and had
wanted to heal the wounds
in my heart, the 19 years of
sorrow would not stop re
turning to my mind. I could
not forget what I had expe
rienced or those who still
suffered inside the camps.
If I didn't undertake this
task, I asked, who would?'
— Harry Wu

would not stop returning to my mind. I
could not forget what I had experienced or
those who still suffered inside the camps. If
I didn't undertake this task, I asked, who
would?"
Before he left, Wu took the added precau
tions of preparing a will and taping an inter
view.
Wu's efforts on that first trip and subse
quent trips to China have placed him in the
international media spotlight and earned
him the respect and attention of leaders
worldwide.
Wu has also testified several times be
fore Congress, most recently in May, when
he stated that the Chinese government
takes the organs of executed death-row in
mates for use in transplants. He has been
honored by a number of human rights or
ganizations.
For the past two weeks, Wu has again
managed to seize the attention of millions.
But this time the world is holding its
breath not because of the poignance of
Wu's tales of the past, but out of concern
for his immediate peril and hope for his fu
ture safety.

ing Wu's release.

The House of
Representatives
approved a unani
mous resolution
last Thursday
night condemning
Wu's detention
and demanding
that China imme
diately grant ac
cess to him.
The Senate
passed a similar
resolution the fol
lowing day. But
the legislative and
diplomatic effort
"doesn't seem to
have much of an ef-

feet," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said Friday.
Jeff Fiedler, a director of Wu's Laogai Re
search Foundation, said Saturday that the
Chinese government's refusal to allow ac
cess to Wu was grounds for serious concern
about Wu's condition.
The 48-hour deadline applies to the first
visit by consular officials, but after that,
Fiedler said, the consular agreement does
not require a second visit for another
month. The Chinese have refused to con
cede one visit to buy themselves another
month with Wu, Fiedler said, and that sug
gests the Chinese might be hiding some
thing — perhaps some harm that has befall
en Wu.
"What's the big deal?" Fiedler said.
"They seem to be playing a game here."
Over the weekend, the State Department
dispatched a representative to Horgas, a
town near the Chinese-Kazakh border, to
investigate reports that Wu was being held
in the Karamay Guest House there, accord
ing to State Department spokesman David
Johnson. Local officials said they had no
knowledge of Wu's whereabouts, Johnson
said.
Johnson added that the State Depart
ment official also located and visited a hotel

called Karamay, but picked up no leads on
Wu. The official has returned to the city of
Urumqi to await instructions.
The Chinese government protested the
consular official's inquiries. On Monday,
the Chinese Foreign Ministry released a
statement saying "the serious difficulties
facing Sino-U.S. relations," including Harry
Wu's detention, "are the sole making of the
U.S. government."
"We reject that," Johnson said. "We
asked for consular access and have been met
with a stone wall. . . . We had no other
choice."
Chinese officials have not announced any
formal charges against Wu, Johnson said.
Discussions have been proceeding at the

top levels of both governments. On Monday,
Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff met
with the Chinese charge d'affaires in Wash
ington.
And yesterday, Johnson said, the U.S.
charge d'affaires in Beijing, Scott Hallford,
met with the Chinese foreign minister to
seek higher-level discussions.
But the discussions have so far proved
fruitless, and hopes of Wu's return have not
increased, Johnson said.
"We're finding the actions of the Chinese
unreasonable, inexcusable," he said.
Johnson added that there are as yet no
plans for further action, aside from continu
ing discussions and stepping up diplomatic
pressure.

"We're doing everything we can through
diplomatic channels," Johnson said. "We ex
pect the Chinese to comply."
Patience and hope at home
Friends and colleagues at home in the
United States have been anxiously waiting
for word of Wu's condition, though hopes
are growing grim.
In Wu's hometown of Milpitas, the local
city government tied yellow ribbons at City
Hall, vowing not to remove them until Wu
comes home. But while the ribbons help ex
press Milpitas' message of hope and solidar
ity, they also painfully underscore that it is
anyone's guess when Wu will return.
"I'm hoping to hear what happened to
him exactly, because holding him in deten
tion . . . incommunicado makes people won
der whether this is like holding a hostage,"
said Hoover Consultant Yuan-li Wu, who is
not related to Harry Wu.
"Knowing what is customary practice
over there, I would be concerned for his per
sonal safety," he said. "People don't realize
what could be done."
Yuan-li Wu said Harry has braved the
dangers of returning to China out of a sense
of duty. He said Harry feels obligated to tell
the story of the Chinese labor-camp system.
"If you don't do it yourself, how can any
body else do it?" he said, explaining Harry
Wu's reasoning. "Freedom has to be earned.
... It doesn't just come to you, especially if
you lost it."
Another Hoover colleague, Senior Fellow
and East Asian Collection Curator Ramon
Myers, was also troubled by China's refusal
to grant access to Wu and the possibilities of
what might happen to him in custody.
"They're a thorn in the side of the gov
ernment," Myers said of Wu and other expa
triate dissidents. "[China] would like to
make an example of Harry Wu."
"In the eyes of that government, he has
broken laws," Myers said. "He's gotten in
formation that that regime would claim was
illegal."
Myers worried that China would contin
ue to delay negotiations for Wu's release.
"I'm sure [the State Department! has
been applying the maximum pressure it has
— but what pressure does it have?" he said.
"All you can do is bombard [China] with re
quests."
Myers said he and other friends had
pleaded with Wu not to return to China.
"He just couldn't be talked out of it,"he
said. "He's a very willful person who has his
own agenda."
The Hoover Institution is also doing its
part to speed Wu's return, according to

Deputy Director Charles Palm.
"The Hoover Institution is cooperating
with the Department of State," Palm said.
Palm declined further comment on the
nature and extent of any assistance Hoover
might be providing the State Department.
Everyone is painfully aware that the last
word of Wu's condition dates from June 23,
when Howell was released. Howell reported,
in Fiedler's words, that at that time "he was
fine, and eating — and ready."
Rough diplomatic waters
Wu's detention in China comes at a time
when the always-turbulent relationship be-

'Knowing what is custom
ary practice over there, I
would be concerned for his
personal safety People
don't realize what could be
done.'
— Yuan-// Wu

tween the United States and China are
growing particularly tense. In some ways,
Wu's detention can be viewed as a result of,
and a next step in, the recent deterioration
of U.S.-China relations.
Relations between the two nations have
taken a turn for the worse since the United
States granted Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, a visa to attend a reunion at Cor
nell University last month. Lee's visit ended
a 16-year ban on Taiwanese leaders visiting
the United States and signaled a step by
Washington toward expanding relations
with Taiwan.
China maintains Taiwan as a province of
its own and rejects claims to the island's in
dependence. The United States officially
recognizes China's dominion over Taiwan
and does not maintain formal diplomatic re
lations with Taiwan.
The United States stressed that granting
Lee a visa did not alter that policy. The move
nevertheless affronted the Chinese govern
ment and sent U.S.-China relations into tur
moil.
Last month, the Chinese government
again jailed pro-democracy leader Chen
Ziming, who was released last year at Presi
dent Clinton's request.
China also recalled its ambassador from
Washington and has delayed its approval of

the new U.S. ambassador to China, James
Sasser. Diplomatic relations between the
two countries were thus reduced to the
lower charge d'affaires level.
In addition, the Chinese government has
made overtures in the past month toward
improving relations with nations the United
States views as hostile, including Iran and
Iraq. China made oil purchasing deals with
Iran after the U.S. announced an embargo
on Iranian oil, and according to Central In
telligence Agency reports, China has deliv
ered nuclear arms components to Iran and
Pakistan.
Captive for 19 years
Wu has published two books about the
Chinese labor camps where he was impris
oned for 19 years. In 1992, he published
"Laogai — the Chinese Gulag." Last year,
Wu published "Bitter Winds," a memoir of
his imprisonment in the labor camps.
According to his account in "Bitter
Winds," Wu was born Wu Hongda in Shang
hai in 1937; as a youth he got the English
name "Harry" from a Jesuit priest. While a
student in 1957, Wu voiced his criticisms of
the Chinese Communist Party, responding
to Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-
Tung's call to "let a hundred flowers bloom
and let a hundred schools of thought con
tend."
But Wu's criticisms were not well re
ceived, and he was branded a "counterrevo
lutionary rightist" and an enemy of the peo
ple.
Wu arranged to escape China across the
Burmese border, but the plans fell through
when authorities apprehended one of his co
horts. In 1960, Wu was arrested and sen
tenced to "re-education" in a labor-reform
camp.
Wu and other political prisoners in the
camps endured disease, starvation, harsh
weather, isolation and physical abuse by
guards and fellow inmates. Meanwhile, they
were forced to work grueling hours in fields,
factories and mines.
Wu was finally released in 1979. In 1985,
he obtained a passport and left China for the
United States. Though he had a chance to
put the past behind him and begin a new life,
he grew increasingly eager to tell his story
and expose the laogai system. To that end,
he joined the Hoover Institution in 1988 and
established the Laogai Research Founda
tion in 1991.
Return to China
Wu first returned to China in 1991, ac
companied by his wife on a mission to docu
ment conditions in China's labor camps.

Though aware of the risks of returning, Wu
could not stay away.
He explained his reasons in an epilogue to
his book:
"Even though I had wanted to forget the
suffering of the past after arriving in the
United States and had wanted to heal the
wounds in my heart, the 19 years of sorrow

'Even though I had wanted
to forget the suffering of
the past after arriving in the
United States and had
wanted to heal the wounds
in my heart, the 19 years of
sorrow would not stop re
turning to my mind. I could
not forget what I had expe
rienced or those who still
suffered inside the camps.
If I didn't undertake this
task, I asked, who would?'
— Harry Wu

would not stop returning to my mind. I
could not forget what I had experienced or
those who still suffered inside the camps. If
I didn't undertake this task, I asked, who
would?"
Before he left, Wu took the added precau
tions of preparing a will and taping an inter
view.
Wu's efforts on that first trip and subse
quent trips to China have placed him in the
international media spotlight and earned
him the respect and attention of leaders
worldwide.
Wu has also testified several times be
fore Congress, most recently in May, when
he stated that the Chinese government
takes the organs of executed death-row in
mates for use in transplants. He has been
honored by a number of human rights or
ganizations.
For the past two weeks, Wu has again
managed to seize the attention of millions.
But this time the world is holding its
breath not because of the poignance of
Wu's tales of the past, but out of concern
for his immediate peril and hope for his fu
ture safety.


Bobby Lee — Daily file
Harry Wu speaks at Stanford Bookstore last year about his book, "Bitter Winds: A Mem
oir of My Years in China's Culag." Wu has been detained incommunicado in China
since June 19.
Half a world away from hot dogs, fire
works and marching bands, human rights
activist and Hoover Institution Research
Fellow Hongda Harry Wu celebrated his
Fourth of July detained by Chinese author
ities in Xinjiang Province in northwest
China.
Tensions have escalated over the past
two weeks between the United States and
China as Chinese officials have rebuffed re
peated requests by U.S. officials to see Wu,

who is an American
citizen.
Meanwhile, at
home, family, friends
and colleagues spent
the holiday weekend
anxiously awaiting
any word on Wu's lo
cation or condition,
hoping for the best
and fearing the worst.
Wu's detention is
particularly alarming
in light of his past ac
tivism. Wu, 58, has
been an outspoken
critic of the Chinese
government and has
made several trips to

China to document human rights abuses in
the Chinese prison-labor camps, or "laogai,"
where he spent 19 years as a political pris
oner. Many fear the Chinese government
will seek retribution while they hold Wu in
custody.
Dangerous game
For 18 days, the conflict has proceeded as
an exercise in diplomatic brinkmanship,
with Wu's liberty and safety and the future
of U.S.-China relations all apparently at
stake.
But despite exchanges at the top levels of
both governments, U.S. officials have made
little progress in arranging Wu's safe re
turn. Indeed, they have not yet been allowed
to visit Wu and check on his condition.
State Department spokesperson Chris
tine Shelly announced at a June 26 press
briefing that Chinese authorities had appre
hended Wu and a colleague, North Carolina
law student Sue Howell, on June 19 as they
crossed the border between China and
Kazakhstan. The State Department has
confirmed that Wu had a valid U.S. passport
and a Chinese visa.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry informed
the American Embassy in Beijing of Wu's
detention on June 23, in accordance with a

access and have been

wa11.... We're finding

nese unreasonable, in

four-day limit for notification that is pre
scribed by consular agreement between the
United States and China.
But, in violation of an additional require
ment that U.S. officials be granted access to
a detained citizen within 48 hours of notifi
cation, the Chinese refused to allow U.S. of
ficials any contact with Wu.
Howell was released on June 23 and has
returned to the United States. She appeai ed
at a press conference last week with Wu's

ing discussions and stepping up diplomatic
pressure.

"We're doing everything we can through
diplomatic channels," Johnson said. "We ex
pect the Chinese to comply."
Patience and hope at home
Friends and colleagues at home in the
United States have been anxiously waiting
for word of Wu's condition, though hopes
are growing grim.
In Wu's hometown of Milpitas, the local
city government tied yellow ribbons at City
Hall, vowing not to remove them until Wu
comes home. But while the ribbons help ex
press Milpitas' message of hope and solidar
ity, they also painfully underscore that it is
anyone's guess when Wu will return.
"I'm hoping to hear what happened to
him exactly, because holding him in deten
tion . . . incommunicado makes people won
der whether this is like holding a hostage,"
said Hoover Consultant Yuan-li Wu, who is
not related to Harry Wu.
"Knowing what is customary practice
over there, I would be concerned for his per
sonal safety," he said. "People don't realize
what could be done."
Yuan-li Wu said Harry has braved the
dangers of returning to China out of a sense
of duty. He said Harry feels obligated to tell
the story of the Chinese labor-camp system.
"If you don't do it yourself, how can any
body else do it?" he said, explaining Harry
Wu's reasoning. "Freedom has to be earned.
... It doesn't just come to you, especially if
you lost it."
Another Hoover colleague, Senior Fellow
and East Asian Collection Curator Ramon
Myers, was also troubled by China's refusal
to grant access to Wu and the possibilities of
what might happen to him in custody.
"They're a thorn in the side of the gov
ernment," Myers said of Wu and other expa
triate dissidents. "[China] would like to
make an example of Harry Wu."
"In the eyes of that government, he has
broken laws," Myers said. "He's gotten in
formation that that regime would claim was
illegal."
Myers worried that China would contin
ue to delay negotiations for Wu's release.
"I'm sure [the State Department! has
been applying the maximum pressure it has
— but what pressure does it have?" he said.
"All you can do is bombard [China] with re
quests."
Myers said he and other friends had
pleaded with Wu not to return to China.
"He just couldn't be talked out of it,"he
said. "He's a very willful person who has his
own agenda."
The Hoover Institution is also doing its
part to speed Wu's return, according to

Deputy Director Charles Palm.
"The Hoover Institution is cooperating
with the Department of State," Palm said.
Palm declined further comment on the
nature and extent of any assistance Hoover
might be providing the State Department.
Everyone is painfully aware that the last
word of Wu's condition dates from June 23,
when Howell was released. Howell reported,
in Fiedler's words, that at that time "he was
fine, and eating — and ready."
Rough diplomatic waters
Wu's detention in China comes at a time
when the always-turbulent relationship be-

'Knowing what is custom
ary practice over there, I
would be concerned for his
personal safety People
don't realize what could be
done.'
— Yuan-// Wu

tween the United States and China are
growing particularly tense. In some ways,
Wu's detention can be viewed as a result of,
and a next step in, the recent deterioration
of U.S.-China relations.
Relations between the two nations have
taken a turn for the worse since the United
States granted Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, a visa to attend a reunion at Cor
nell University last month. Lee's visit ended
a 16-year ban on Taiwanese leaders visiting
the United States and signaled a step by
Washington toward expanding relations
with Taiwan.
China maintains Taiwan as a province of
its own and rejects claims to the island's in
dependence. The United States officially
recognizes China's dominion over Taiwan
and does not maintain formal diplomatic re
lations with Taiwan.
The United States stressed that granting
Lee a visa did not alter that policy. The move
nevertheless affronted the Chinese govern
ment and sent U.S.-China relations into tur
moil.
Last month, the Chinese government
again jailed pro-democracy leader Chen
Ziming, who was released last year at Presi
dent Clinton's request.
China also recalled its ambassador from
Washington and has delayed its approval of

the new U.S. ambassador to China, James
Sasser. Diplomatic relations between the
two countries were thus reduced to the
lower charge d'affaires level.
In addition, the Chinese government has
made overtures in the past month toward
improving relations with nations the United
States views as hostile, including Iran and
Iraq. China made oil purchasing deals with
Iran after the U.S. announced an embargo
on Iranian oil, and according to Central In
telligence Agency reports, China has deliv
ered nuclear arms components to Iran and
Pakistan.
Captive for 19 years
Wu has published two books about the
Chinese labor camps where he was impris
oned for 19 years. In 1992, he published
"Laogai — the Chinese Gulag." Last year,
Wu published "Bitter Winds," a memoir of
his imprisonment in the labor camps.
According to his account in "Bitter
Winds," Wu was born Wu Hongda in Shang
hai in 1937; as a youth he got the English
name "Harry" from a Jesuit priest. While a
student in 1957, Wu voiced his criticisms of
the Chinese Communist Party, responding
to Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-
Tung's call to "let a hundred flowers bloom
and let a hundred schools of thought con
tend."
But Wu's criticisms were not well re
ceived, and he was branded a "counterrevo
lutionary rightist" and an enemy of the peo
ple.
Wu arranged to escape China across the
Burmese border, but the plans fell through
when authorities apprehended one of his co
horts. In 1960, Wu was arrested and sen
tenced to "re-education" in a labor-reform
camp.
Wu and other political prisoners in the
camps endured disease, starvation, harsh
weather, isolation and physical abuse by
guards and fellow inmates. Meanwhile, they
were forced to work grueling hours in fields,
factories and mines.
Wu was finally released in 1979. In 1985,
he obtained a passport and left China for the
United States. Though he had a chance to
put the past behind him and begin a new life,
he grew increasingly eager to tell his story
and expose the laogai system. To that end,
he joined the Hoover Institution in 1988 and
established the Laogai Research Founda
tion in 1991.
Return to China
Wu first returned to China in 1991, ac
companied by his wife on a mission to docu
ment conditions in China's labor camps.

Though aware of the risks of returning, Wu
could not stay away.
He explained his reasons in an epilogue to
his book:
"Even though I had wanted to forget the
suffering of the past after arriving in the
United States and had wanted to heal the
wounds in my heart, the 19 years of sorrow

'Even though I had wanted
to forget the suffering of
the past after arriving in the
United States and had
wanted to heal the wounds
in my heart, the 19 years of
sorrow would not stop re
turning to my mind. I could
not forget what I had expe
rienced or those who still
suffered inside the camps.
If I didn't undertake this
task, I asked, who would?'
— Harry Wu

would not stop returning to my mind. I
could not forget what I had experienced or
those who still suffered inside the camps. If
I didn't undertake this task, I asked, who
would?"
Before he left, Wu took the added precau
tions of preparing a will and taping an inter
view.
Wu's efforts on that first trip and subse
quent trips to China have placed him in the
international media spotlight and earned
him the respect and attention of leaders
worldwide.
Wu has also testified several times be
fore Congress, most recently in May, when
he stated that the Chinese government
takes the organs of executed death-row in
mates for use in transplants. He has been
honored by a number of human rights or
ganizations.
For the past two weeks, Wu has again
managed to seize the attention of millions.
But this time the world is holding its
breath not because of the poignance of
Wu's tales of the past, but out of concern
for his immediate peril and hope for his fu
ture safety.
