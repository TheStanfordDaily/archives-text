## Stiglitz moves into CEA post Former prof to advise President 
### 
Last Wednesday, President Clinton appointed
Stanford Economics Prof. Joseph Stiglitz as chair of
the three-member Council of Economic Advisers
(CEA).
Stiglitz has served as a member of the council
since leaving Stanford for Capitol Hill at the start of
the Clinton administration.
He will replace Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a UC-
Berkeley economist who left the chair to head the
National Economic Council.
According to Economics Prof. John Taylor, who is
himself a former CEA member, his colleague's recent
appointment "indicates that we're not only doing
good economic research, but we're also interested in
communicating economic ideas beyond the class
room." During the Bush administration, Stanford
economist Michael Boskin chaired the Council.
The CEA, first formed as part of the Employment
Act of 1946, advises the president on all economic is
sues, including micro-, macro- and international is
sues.
The Council offers "a kind of consensus economic
advice . . . widely held by mainstream economists,"
said Taylor, adding that its members frequently
come from the academic community.
Taylor spoke of the upcoming year's political cam
paign as a real challenge for the CEA, whose princi
pal purpose "is to provide as nonpartisan a picture of
what's going on in the economy as possible. . . and to
communicate economic ideas to the press and to the
public."
Most likely, Stiglitz will not deviate from the tra
ditional, objective role of past CEA chairpersons,
Taylor said.
Stiglitz is the founding editor of the American
Economic Association's Journal of Economic Per
spectives, a periodical created to make economic
ideas more accessible to non-specialists.
He has published leading textbooks in public-sec
tor economics and has taught at MIT, Princeton and
Oxford.
He is also a senior member of the Hoover Institu
tion and the Institute for Policy Reform in Washing
ton. Stiglitz's name is often dropped by fellow econo
mists speculating future Nobel Prize winners.
Stiglitz specializes in the effect of imperfect or in
complete information on the functioning of markets
and economies, but he is also hailed as one of today's
premier all-around theorists.
Because of budget cuts and similarities between

the CEA and other economic organizations, there
has been recent discussion regarding its elimination.
"It is very important to have this organization."
said Taylor. "It is unique. . . . Many governments
don't have such a thing. I think it would be a mistake
to eliminate it."
President Clinton intends to nominate Alicia
Munnell, assistant secretary for economic policy at
the Treasury Department, to the Council of Eco
nomic Advisers to fill the council seat Stiglitz leaves
behind.
