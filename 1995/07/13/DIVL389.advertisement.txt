That 's because, even during the summer, Stanford
supports a huge community of men and women â€”peo-
ple earning money and looking to spend it in the area.
Only The Stanford Weekly can deliver your adver
tisement to the faculty, staff and graduate students
working on campus all year, as well as the many un
dergraduates who stay for a
summer on The Farm and the hordes of tourists who
drop in for a visit. With 13,500 copies distributed
around campus and around town every Thursday,
there's no better way to reach your audience.
All this at a cost that won't make you feel like you
had your pocket picked.
