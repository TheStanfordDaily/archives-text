Cannery Row or Catalina Island. ..
You'll Love Stanford Flying Club!
Stanford to Monterey in 36 minutes, and for
less than $25 per person. Or for that matter-
Catalina Island - in only 2 hours and 20
minutes.
Cannery Row and other adventures are
available by air within a couple of hours at a
surprisingly low cost when you obtain a pilot's
license from SFC.
Most members complete our Solo Pilot License
course with 10 to 20 hours of flying time. Two
seat planes start at $39/ hr including fuel, and
you only pay for actual flight time. You can even
take a lesson while flying to Catalina Island.
Call for details, our flying-time trip planner, and
free information about flying lessons. Or try a
$75 test-flight. You'll love itl
