This past Saturday, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra
returned from a three-week tour in China, where it met fel
low Chinese musicians and students, held concerts in six
major cities and even spoke on China National Radio.
"Some amazing things happened on the tour," reflected
graduate student and former orchestra president Ike
Chuang, who is currently one of the violinists in the or
chestra. More than two years of preparation, fundraising,
and student coordination helped to make the tour an over
whelming success.

performed at

tour included performances in Beijing, Shanghai, uuilin,
Guangzhou (Canton), Jiangmen and Hong Kong.
East meets West
Opening with "For the Uncommon Woman,' a contem
porary piece by female composer Joan 1 ower, dii ector of oi
chestras and conductor Karla Lemon led the orchestra
through a lively and diverse program in each city.
Ranging from Mozart's Sifonia Concertante in L-rlat
Major to more recent Chinese composer Chen Yi s Ge Xu
(Antiphony)," Lemon did a remarkable job throughout the
entire tour, said photographer Alex Greenwood.
"We could not have expected anything more," he said.
While the performances were met with enthusiasm and
appreciation, at times orchestra members were uncertain
of how the concerts would be received. Orchestra percus
sionist Matt Springer — who is returning from his third in
ternational tour with the orchestra — commented that
sometimes the applause was polite.
"We knew the music was unfamiliar when the applause

came in between movements or when there was silence at

the end of a piece," he said. However, the perfor
mances seemed to be thoroughly enjoyed by all.

Oboist Sarah Young, who coordinated
publicity for the tour and will serve as

next year s orchestra presi
dent, commented that

"the uncommon pieces
were especially fun

to play."
Even though

"the audience in Hong
Kong was the only one to real
• . .i n- i • 1 rp »

ly appreciate the first piece by Tower,
Young said, "it was an important part of
the cultural exchange."
The concerts invited learning new styles

and customs across both cultures. Audiences
picked up on Western-style applause quickly,
and Stanford students also learned a few cus
toms, such as concluding their concerts by ap
plauding the audiences in appreciation.
The very idea of playing music in China

was fascinating to some. Springer, one of the chairs of the
tour, commented on how the rich cultural and musical her
itage of the region blended with contemporary Western and
Eastern elements.
"For thousands of years, they had a rich musical tradi
tion," Springer said. ' Then in 1976, with the Cultural Rev
olution, this tradition was suppressed."
However, recent efforts to revive the heritage combined
with new interests to generate an exciting musical climate,
he said. Not surprisingly, the performances with Chinese
musicians and instruments created some breathtaking
music for both orchestra members and audience members.
Interestingly, both Chuang and Greenwood commented
that the tour provided the first opportunity for many Chi
nese university students and young musicians to see and
hear Western-style conservatory music. Likewise, the tour
was an opportunity for Stanford's orchestra to play some
Chinese folk tunes and even a few ancient Chinese instru
ments.
At a small chamber recital for Wuyi University in Jiang
men for example, Springer had the opportunity to play the
"erhu," a Chinese two-string guitar, with several Chinese
musicians.
"It was really great," Young said. "That area does not
tend to get many musical performances, let alone Western
style ones."
Having learned the instrument and the music prior to
the tour, Springer was accompanied by Chinese musicians
playing the "yangqin," a string instrument played with a
mallet. The students performed a piece incorporating nu
merous Chinese folk tunes, many of which were familiar to
the audience.
The performance was so popular that not only was
Springer asked to sign autographs, he later gave lessons on
the erhu as well.
"This performance was one of the highlights of the
tour," Young said.
Bridging cultural boundaries
In addition to the performances, some of the most mem
orable moments involved discussions and meetings with
fellow Stanford and Chinese students. Lessons on cultural,
political and educational differences passed enthusiastical
ly between the two groups.

"They kept asking us how we did things here," freshman
Corey Karlin commented , adding that she and others were
equally interested in their lives.
"There was a sense of yearning," an eagerness to learn
and hear about new things, Chuang said. Groups went to
discos, dinners, and on walks together.
"We talked about identity — what it means to be Tai
wanese today, or Chinese," Karlin said. "We talked about
communism and dictatorships, but mostly we talked about
what we were seeing all around us: the rapid transitions in
development and modernization."
Struck by their kindness and curiosity, Karlin and oth
ers recognized that while the U.S. and Chinese govern
ments struggle over political debates, personal relation
ships are quite different. While the students discussed is
sues such as communism and "what it means to be com
munist" or democratic, the relationships were marked by
friendship rather than tension, she added.
While "some students were worried at the beginning of
the tour," Young noted that minimal concerns persisted.
Young hoped that the tour, "like any cultural exchange,
would ultimately improve the relations currently strained
between the two governments."
Overall, said Matt Springer, the "tour will be remem
bered as one of warmth and not of awkwardness."
The tour was also special for many in that some of their
family roots connected to Jiangmen, one of the cities on the
tour. At that performance, some students were able to meet
with relatives and perform for them. In fact, several or
chestra members remained in China after the tour to visit
with relatives.
Another highlight of the trip was a guest appearance on
China National Radio in which five students spoke and
played various pieces for almost two hours. The radio show,
comparable to "Fresh Air" on National Public Radio in the
United States, aired in front of a live audience of more than
1 billion people.
Coordinating the tour
The core three-member cargo crew, Chuang, Springer
and percussionist Victor Lee, tirelessly and successfully
made the trip run smoothly with the help of 20 student vol
unteers.
Chuang remembers frequent bureaucratic setbacks. In

Beijing, he negotiated with customs officials for four
hours "in a very small, dirty airport," in their efforts to
allow the instruments through.
Karlin was particularly impressed by the coordination.
"I have been on other tours before," she said, "but this one
was an exception."
Springer added that the logistics were often worked out
with the help of Chinese officials. On the last day of the trip,
exhausted and dehydrated, the student crew attempted to
load its cargo onto the airplane in the sweltering heat.
Springer recalls miraculously seeing a bag of bottled water
delivered next to the cargo. Apparently, members of the
trucking company had kindly had it delivered for them.
Not only did the cargo logistics run successfully, but
all of the planning contributed to the tour's smooth- a
ness. Orchestra presidents Allison Hu and Elizabeth jl
Christensen did an amazing job, Karlin remarked. jH
"We even had name tags in Chinese and hotel cards 9
in case we were lost," she said.
Both items were instrumental in the success of the
trip.
In addition, members also praised the orchestra's previ
ous presidents, Chuang and violinist and tour chair Elisa
Ong, the two who first conceived of the trip. Advisor, fund
raiser, and special guest Barbara Greenwood added that
the fund-raising efforts were commendable. More than 90
percent of the money was raised by students.
The tour was made possible by the generous sponsorship
of various people and organizations, including Helen and
Peter Bing, the Clement Chen Foundation, the Celia & Al
bert Clark Fund, the Department of Music, the President's
Office, and the School of Engineering. Helen Bing was one
of the honorary guests on the tour.
Prior orchestra tours included 1988 performances in
Eastern Asia, when the orchestra visited Japan, Singa
pore and South Korea. In 1991, the orchestra toured East
ern Europe and performed in Austria, Hungary, Czecho
slovakia and Germany. In the 1993-94 school year, the
group received the "Orchestra of the Year" award from
Paul Hertelendy, music writer for the San Jose Mercury
News.
Many expressed enthusiasm for the next international
performance; however, they will most likely have to wait
another three years.

This past Saturday, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra
returned from a three-week tour in China, where it met fel
low Chinese musicians and students, held concerts in six
major cities and even spoke on China National Radio.
"Some amazing things happened on the tour," reflected
graduate student and former orchestra president Ike
Chuang, who is currently one of the violinists in the or
chestra. More than two years of preparation, fundraising,
and student coordination helped to make the tour an over
whelming success.

tour included performances in Beijing, Shanghai, uuilin,
Guangzhou (Canton), Jiangmen and Hong Kong.
East meets West
Opening with "For the Uncommon Woman,' a contem
porary piece by female composer Joan 1 ower, dii ector of oi
chestras and conductor Karla Lemon led the orchestra
through a lively and diverse program in each city.
Ranging from Mozart's Sifonia Concertante in L-rlat
Major to more recent Chinese composer Chen Yi s Ge Xu
(Antiphony)," Lemon did a remarkable job throughout the
entire tour, said photographer Alex Greenwood.
"We could not have expected anything more," he said.
While the performances were met with enthusiasm and
appreciation, at times orchestra members were uncertain
of how the concerts would be received. Orchestra percus
sionist Matt Springer — who is returning from his third in
ternational tour with the orchestra — commented that
sometimes the applause was polite.
"We knew the music was unfamiliar when the applause

came in between movements or when there was silence at

the end of a piece," he said. However, the perfor
mances seemed to be thoroughly enjoyed by all.

Oboist Sarah Young, who coordinated
publicity for the tour and will serve as

next year s orchestra presi
dent, commented that

"the uncommon pieces
were especially fun

to play."
Even though

"the audience in Hong
Kong was the only one to real
• . .i n- i • 1 rp »

ly appreciate the first piece by Tower,
Young said, "it was an important part of
the cultural exchange."
The concerts invited learning new styles

and customs across both cultures. Audiences
picked up on Western-style applause quickly,
and Stanford students also learned a few cus
toms, such as concluding their concerts by ap
plauding the audiences in appreciation.
The very idea of playing music in China

was fascinating to some. Springer, one of the chairs of the
tour, commented on how the rich cultural and musical her
itage of the region blended with contemporary Western and
Eastern elements.
"For thousands of years, they had a rich musical tradi
tion," Springer said. ' Then in 1976, with the Cultural Rev
olution, this tradition was suppressed."
However, recent efforts to revive the heritage combined
with new interests to generate an exciting musical climate,
he said. Not surprisingly, the performances with Chinese
musicians and instruments created some breathtaking
music for both orchestra members and audience members.
Interestingly, both Chuang and Greenwood commented
that the tour provided the first opportunity for many Chi
nese university students and young musicians to see and
hear Western-style conservatory music. Likewise, the tour
was an opportunity for Stanford's orchestra to play some
Chinese folk tunes and even a few ancient Chinese instru
ments.
At a small chamber recital for Wuyi University in Jiang
men for example, Springer had the opportunity to play the
"erhu," a Chinese two-string guitar, with several Chinese
musicians.
"It was really great," Young said. "That area does not
tend to get many musical performances, let alone Western
style ones."
Having learned the instrument and the music prior to
the tour, Springer was accompanied by Chinese musicians
playing the "yangqin," a string instrument played with a
mallet. The students performed a piece incorporating nu
merous Chinese folk tunes, many of which were familiar to
the audience.
The performance was so popular that not only was
Springer asked to sign autographs, he later gave lessons on
the erhu as well.
"This performance was one of the highlights of the
tour," Young said.
Bridging cultural boundaries
In addition to the performances, some of the most mem
orable moments involved discussions and meetings with
fellow Stanford and Chinese students. Lessons on cultural,
political and educational differences passed enthusiastical
ly between the two groups.

"They kept asking us how we did things here," freshman
Corey Karlin commented , adding that she and others were
equally interested in their lives.
"There was a sense of yearning," an eagerness to learn
and hear about new things, Chuang said. Groups went to
discos, dinners, and on walks together.
"We talked about identity — what it means to be Tai
wanese today, or Chinese," Karlin said. "We talked about
communism and dictatorships, but mostly we talked about
what we were seeing all around us: the rapid transitions in
development and modernization."
Struck by their kindness and curiosity, Karlin and oth
ers recognized that while the U.S. and Chinese govern
ments struggle over political debates, personal relation
ships are quite different. While the students discussed is
sues such as communism and "what it means to be com
munist" or democratic, the relationships were marked by
friendship rather than tension, she added.
While "some students were worried at the beginning of
the tour," Young noted that minimal concerns persisted.
Young hoped that the tour, "like any cultural exchange,
would ultimately improve the relations currently strained
between the two governments."
Overall, said Matt Springer, the "tour will be remem
bered as one of warmth and not of awkwardness."
The tour was also special for many in that some of their
family roots connected to Jiangmen, one of the cities on the
tour. At that performance, some students were able to meet
with relatives and perform for them. In fact, several or
chestra members remained in China after the tour to visit
with relatives.
Another highlight of the trip was a guest appearance on
China National Radio in which five students spoke and
played various pieces for almost two hours. The radio show,
comparable to "Fresh Air" on National Public Radio in the
United States, aired in front of a live audience of more than
1 billion people.
