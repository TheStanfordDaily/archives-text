# My specialist... my computer screen
## Stanford pioneers the use of remote videoconferencing technology in medicine 
### Story by Steven Kasapi 
The hours of waiting in a specialist's
office after weeks of delay may soon
be as quaint as the drills and ham
mers of last century's medics. Telemedi
cine, the linking of medical sites by high
speed telecommunication networks, is
rapidly changing the way we see doctors,
with Stanford at the forefront.
"Our goal is to implement telemedicine
for different uses," said Jana Katz, product
manager at the Stanford Medical School.
Stanford became involved in telemedi
cine in October 1993.
There are already dozens of telemedi
cine programs in the United States. How
ever, most are run by the military or the
prison system or operate in rural commu
nities where enormous distances or haz
ardous conditions make access to special
ists difficult.
Stanford, however, chose to focus on
urban sites. The goal is to make telemedi
cine work medically, economically and

technologically.
"Our program is research- and service
oriented," said Jana Katz, telemedicine
program manager at the Stanford Hospi
tal.
"We're taking a critical look at cost-ef
fectiveness and seed costs," she added.
Telegraphs, telephones and radio have
been used to transmit medical information
for decades, but digital and telecommuni
cations technology has matured rapidly.
High-quality video, audio and data links
are becoming inexpensive and practical
ways to share medical information.
In principle, doctors can now listen to,
watch and supervise examinations of pa
tients anywhere in the world that telecom
munications technologies can reach.
A typical session
During a typical telemedicine session re
cently, Dr. Chris Barnard, a Stanford der
matologist, examined a patient referred to
him by a practitioner in San Jose. The pa
tient appeared on a 24-inch television mon
itor about eight feet in front of Barnard.
The patient watched another video screen
showing an image of Barnard, also cap
tured by a video camera mounted on the
monitor.

"It's not quite TV quality," Katz cau
tioned, but she added that it is not as rough
as what one might expect from real-time
computer imaging.
Barnard asked the patient questions
and gives instructions to the doctor on site
in San Jose. The patient seems relaxed Jok
ing occasionally with Barnard and the
other doctor.
A high-resolution camera, calibrated for
color fidelity and light sensitivity, captured
detailed images of the patient's mouth,
neck and chin. The images are transmitted
immediately to Stanford and displayed on a
computer screen in front of Barnard, who
studied the photographic-quality images as
part of his diagnosis.
Measurements from almost any medical
equipment can be transferred digitally to
the specialist and stored at both Stanford
and the remote site and included in the pa
tient's medical record.
"We've tested all the equipment," said

Barnard. "We've gone through many dif
ferent cameras. The hardware issues have
been addressed, and we're at a very suc
cessful level in terms of getting an afford
able system in place."
Stanford currently has four remote
sites. Each site was chosen to explore dif
ferent aspects of telemedicine, Katz ex
plained.
Drew Medical Clinic in East Palo Alto
uses telemedicine to provide treatment to
patients who are either reluctant or unable
to come to Stanford for treatment. Many
clients are from minority backgrounds and
have very low income. Cultural and lan
guage barriers and lack of adequate trans
portation can make it difficult for some
East Palo Alto residents to visit Stanford
Hospital. Telemedicine, it is hoped, will
provide inexpensive and easy access to
Stanford specialists.
At the San Jose Medical Group, physi
cians also consult specialists at Stanford by
telemedicine. Although they have their
own specialists, the San Jose Medical
Group now offers consultation with Stan
ford specialists using telemedicine, elimi
nating the standard wait of several weeks
for a regular consultation.
The third site, located in Singapore, will

mostly be used for sharing information be
tween doctors, Katz said. There are no
plans to use it to diagnose patients remote
ly. .
In all locations, a crucial goal is "to ex
tend consultation while making it cost ef
fective," Katz said.
Lytton Gardens site
Stanford's fourth and most recent
telemedicine site is Lytton Gardens, a Palo
Alto nursing home. Like the other sites,
Lytton Gardens is primarily concerned
with improving clients' access to Stan
ford's medical specialists.
"One of the concerns for all nursing
homes is the physician's time and atten
tion," said Vera Goupille, the chief execu
tive officer of Lytton Gardens.
"We're always interested in improving
our relations with physicians," Goupille
said. "There are also patients in hospitals
who might be served just as well by a nurs-

ing home using telemedicine. Right now
we're looking at doing liver transplant pa
tients and some others."
Patients who are stable but still need
routine monitoring are well suited to
telemedicine, Goupille said. Nurses or pri
mary care doctors in the nursing home
would provide immediate care, with spe
cialists available for regular monitoring
and immediate consultation, if needed.
"This is the first time in the country this
has been tried by a nursing home," said
Jonathan Wilson, project manager at Lyt
ton Gardens.
"There's been a lot of reluctance by pa
tients here to go back and forth to a hospi
tal," Wilson said. "They usually go by am
bulance even if it's not an emergency be
cause it's the best mode of transportation.
That's very costly for the patient, inconve
nient, and scary for some people. I think
having the option to do a lot of that here is
much better for the patient."
According to Goupille, patient and staff
response has been very positive.
"They get to see the physicians and are
able to communicate," she said. "If there is
any reluctance, it's before anyone has actu
ally seen or used it. As soon as the staff or
patients see the quality of the pictures,

[any concern I just sort of melts."
The teleniedicine equipment at Lytton
Gardens is similar to that at the other three
remote sites and at Stanford. A high-end
personal computer controls the video and
data acquisition using software written by
md/tv inc., of Orlando, Florida. Daou Sys
tems Inc. of San Diego and Hewlett
Packard provided the hardware.
High-speed digital communication is
provided by six Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) lines, each operating at
about 1.5 million bits per second. At maxi
mum speed using all six lines simultane
ously, the entire Bible could be transmitted
in less than five seconds. The ISDN lines
are being paid for by Calßen, a fund creat
ed by Pacific Bell.
The separate ISDN lines are combined
and the digital information compressed by
a unit called a CODEC (for coder / de
coder). Four of these lines are combined to
carry the video signal while the other two

will eventually be used to transfer data
taken using medical equipment at Lytton
Gardens to the center at the Stanford Hos
pital.
No medical instruments are used in the
room while Lytton Gardens' needs are still
being evaluated, although an electrocar
diograph (ECG), a device used to record the
electrical activity of the heart, is a likely ad
dition.
"We're still in the developmental stage,
but our plan is to use it in monitoring
transplant patients and perhaps other pa
tients who need to be monitored on a regu
lar basis," said Goupille.
Although most of the technical issues
have been resolved, ways of organizing doc
tors to consult for Lytton Gardens by
telemedicine still has to be worked out.
"We're ready," said Goupille. "We're
waiting for Stanford to work out their
schedule. It's the logistics of the scheduling
now, and getting the routine down for
physicians to incorporate this into their
day, and access to the room. We are ready
and we could do it tomorrow."
The first teledermatology session at
Lytton Gardens will take place next Tues
day, said Barnard. "For Lytton Gardens
the only thing I need to work out is who will
be the primary care provider."
Like many nursing homes, Lytton Gar
dens makes use of a number of doctors dis
tributed throughout the community. In
this pilot project, Barnard said, the prima
ry care provider must be properly trained
to avoid false diagnoses.
The instruments used in telemedicine
are standard technology, but taking mean
ngful video images requires high-quality
equipment, carefully controlled lighting,
and an operator who is trained in how to
use the camera.
"You need to get a very sensitive cam
era," said Kai Yamaguchi, an intern and re
cent Stanford graduate who helped set up
the Lytton Gardens facility. "If they're not
used right, there's no way to get an accu
rate diagnosis."
"The accuracy of diagnosing over
telemedicine equipment has been shown to
be as effective as looking at protected Ko
dachromes (color slide film)," added
Barnard. Dermatologists are often trained
using images on Kodachromes, and board
exams often include making diagnoses
from protected Kodachromes.
Barnard together with second-year
medical student Ming Cheng and Dr.

Susan Schwetter are simultaneously creat
ing a database of patients treated during
the telemedicine sessions. Cheng enters
data on the patient including relevant, med
ical information such as images and other
data taken during the session. The data
base will then be used to check the diagno
sis during the telemedicine with a later di
agnosis by another doctor using the same
images. Preliminary tests have shown that
diagnoses during the telemedicine sessions
agree well with subsequent diagnoses,
Barnard said.
Future of telemedicine
Although much of the focus in telemedi
cine is on real-time video and data transfer,
not all telemedicine will be conducted live.
The most practical form telemedicine takes
may be more like fast electronic mail than
like live conversation.
"There are two mechanisms for
telemedicine," Barnard said. "One is a live
teleconsultation where we actually have
the patient or the patient's physician at the
remote site and we do the consultation live.
The other is asynchronous consultation,
where the images are captured at the local
site and sent to our workstation back at
Stanford. Probably the greatest savings are
going to be in doing asynchronous consul
tation."
The advantage of asynchronous
telemedicine is that doctors can consult a
patient's records within their own sched
ule, much like voice mail or electronic mail
is used today.
"If you 're doing a live consultation, they
have to have a scheduled time slot. The pa
tient, the referring physician and the spe
cialist all have to be there at the same time.
That is most likely the biggest disruption to
the schedule," Barnard said.
Barnard suggests that a telemedicine as
sistant could run most of the session with
the patient and the specialist, with the pri
mary doctor arriving near the end of the
session for consultation and feedback.
Another issue in diagnosing a patient by
telemedicine is the loss of touch and feel,
often important in diagnosing skin disor
ders and lesions.
"I'm really relying on history and visual
inspection. I don't have the ability to feel
the skin," Barnard said.
"Visual inspection and history provide
more than 90 percent of the information I
need," he continued. However, the other 10
percent may require that the patient come

to the hospital for an examination.
Some doctors also fear that the personal
contact between doctor and patient may be
lost. But, as Goupille pointed out, that loss
of contact may be a blessing for some pa
tients.
"Studies have shown that the patients
have more control," said Goupille.
"They're in their own territory. In some
ways it equalizes the playing field. It makes
up for some of the lost touch and feel. You
can adjust the screen to make the person
close up or far away. There is a distance be
tween the patient and the doctor which can
be a comfort."

'If there is any reluctance,
it's before anyone has actu
ally seen or used it. As
soon as the staff or patients
see the quality of the pic
tures, [any concern] just
sort of melts.'

The current Stanford facilities are pilot
projects, mostly paid by donations from the
manufacturers of the equipment. Al
though costs are declining quickly, a typi
cal telemedicine site would be prohibitively
expensive for many private institutions
without substantial donations.
"We just don't happen to have $150,000
sitting around," said Goupille. "We may
find at the end of this study, as the technol
ogy evolves, that we don't need to spend
that amount. Would we do it at the end if
we still have to spend some money? We'd
have to look at what the tradeoff is, but I
don't think that we're going to get a free
ride forever."
Wilson agreed. "If you include all the
costs of laying the lines, plus all the hard
ware and software, plus all the time consul
tants have been working to fix all the
glitches, it would really add up. The contri
butions have been invaluable."
"I think that by going through this,
we're making it possible for other organi
zations to do this in a couple of years," he
added.

Acceptance into the medical infrastruc
ture is another major hurdle for telemedi
cine. Insurance companies, for example,
don't yet include telemedicine in their cov
erage.
Issues of liability also need to be re
solved. Barnard describes the arrangement
between Stanford and the San Jose Medical
Group as one possible model.
"Our agreement with San Jose is that
we share the liability with both providers,
but the primary care provider has the final
word. Our current agreement is basically
shared liability, with the specialist acting
as a consultant."
Before insurance companies will accept
telemedicine as valid treatment, Barnard
said, hospitals must show that telemedi
cine is both efficient and reliable. "The
point of our the research is to show this is a
cost effective system. . . .The main thing is
it has to be more cost-effective than cur
rent medicine."
Educational and peer-to-peer conferenc
ing are promising and less problematic
uses of telemedicine. Continuing medical
education, or CME, is an important part of
every practicing doctor's career which
could greatly benefit from widespread use
of telemedicine.
"TeIeCME is made more possible
through the use of telemedicine," Barnard
points out. "The idea would be to hold a
large teleconference between two institu
tions, or to archive a lot of cases."
Information in the form of pictures and
measurements is already being stored in
telemedicine sessions so it can be made
available to other institutions.
"We're talking about a huge database,"
Barnard added. "Instead of libraries full of
books, we're talking about lots and lots of
cases that aren't photographed or recorded
except in medical records. I really believe
it's possible for everyone to learn to use
telemedicine as part of their training, re
gardless of their specialty."
Cheng agreed, saying, "The more expo
sure I can get as a student to something
that will be in use in the future, the better."
The current medical system, however, is
not designed to allow treatment of patients
across the country. Currently a doctor is li
censed to practice state-by-state, so a doc
tor in California can only treat patients in
California.
"In Texas, they are working on getting a
limited license for doctors who want to
work outside of Texas," Barnard noted.

Already, doctors must pass national
exams before beginning their practice.
Another critical element for telemedi
cine is fast data transfer. Without high
data rates, video images become choppy
and captured images are slow to transfer.
Efforts are also underway to build the in
frastructure, but even in technologically
advanced regions like the Bay Area, high
speed ISDN lines are expensive.
Although hardware and software costs
are decreasing, high-speed telecommunica
tions network may take longer to mature.
Strong government support will be crucial
if telemedicine is to be affordable and use
ful, especially in rural areas.
Impact on Stanford Students
Despite the Stanford Hospital's pioneer
ing work, Stanford students will not treat
ed by telemedicine in the near future.
"Cowell [Student Health Center] has
been mentioned as a possible site," said
Katz, "but not seriously explored."
Dr. Ira Freedman, director of Cowell
Student Health Services, concurs.
"We nave no plans to participate in a
telemedicine program," he said, stressing,
however, that Cowell is keenly monitoring
the growth of telemedicine.
"It's a potential for primary care in gen
eral, and we're one of the sites that's close
ly watching that kind of thing," he said.

said, hospitals must show that telemedi
cine is both efficient and reliable. "The
point of our the research is to show this is a
cost effective system. . . .The main thing is
it has to be more cost-effective than cur
rent medicine."
Educational and peer-to-peer conferenc
ing are promising and less problematic
uses of telemedicine. Continuing medical
education, or CME, is an important part of
every practicing doctor's career which
could greatly benefit from widespread use
of telemedicine.
"TeIeCME is made more possible
through the use of telemedicine," Barnard
points out. "The idea would be to hold a
large teleconference between two institu
tions, or to archive a lot of cases."
Information in the form of pictures and
measurements is already being stored in
telemedicine sessions so it can be made
available to other institutions.
"We're talking about a huge database,"
Barnard added. "Instead of libraries full of
books, we're talking about lots and lots of
cases that aren't photographed or recorded
except in medical records. I really believe
it's possible for everyone to learn to use
telemedicine as part of their training, re
gardless of their specialty."
Cheng agreed, saying, "The more expo
sure I can get as a student to something
that will be in use in the future, the better."
The current medical system, however, is
not designed to allow treatment of patients
across the country. Currently a doctor is li
censed to practice state-by-state, so a doc
tor in California can only treat patients in
California.
"In Texas, they are working on getting a
limited license for doctors who want to
work outside of Texas," Barnard noted.

Already, doctors must pass national
exams before beginning their practice.
Another critical element for telemedi
cine is fast data transfer. Without high
data rates, video images become choppy
and captured images are slow to transfer.
Efforts are also underway to build the in
frastructure, but even in technologically
advanced regions like the Bay Area, high
speed ISDN lines are expensive.
Although hardware and software costs
are decreasing, high-speed telecommunica
tions network may take longer to mature.
Strong government support will be crucial
if telemedicine is to be affordable and use
ful, especially in rural areas.
Impact on Stanford Students
Despite the Stanford Hospital's pioneer
ing work, Stanford students will not treat
ed by telemedicine in the near future.
"Cowell [Student Health Center] has
been mentioned as a possible site," said
Katz, "but not seriously explored."
Dr. Ira Freedman, director of Cowell
Student Health Services, concurs.
"We nave no plans to participate in a
telemedicine program," he said, stressing,
however, that Cowell is keenly monitoring
the growth of telemedicine.
"It's a potential for primary care in gen
eral, and we're one of the sites that's close
ly watching that kind of thing," he said.

Doctor Chris Barnard uses telecommuni
cations technology to treat patients in
other cities.

Stanford Hospital. An image of the pa

Henry Hsu — Daily
The hours of waiting in a specialist's
office after weeks of delay may soon
be as quaint as the drills and ham
mers of last century's medics. Telemedi
cine, the linking of medical sites by high
speed telecommunication networks, is
rapidly changing the way we see doctors,
with Stanford at the forefront.
"Our goal is to implement telemedicine
for different uses," said Jana Katz, product
manager at the Stanford Medical School.
Stanford became involved in telemedi
cine in October 1993.
There are already dozens of telemedi
cine programs in the United States. How
ever, most are run by the military or the
prison system or operate in rural commu
nities where enormous distances or haz
ardous conditions make access to special
ists difficult.
Stanford, however, chose to focus on
urban sites. The goal is to make telemedi
cine work medically, economically and

technologically.
"Our program is research- and service
oriented," said Jana Katz, telemedicine
program manager at the Stanford Hospi
tal.
"We're taking a critical look at cost-ef
fectiveness and seed costs," she added.
Telegraphs, telephones and radio have
been used to transmit medical information
for decades, but digital and telecommuni
cations technology has matured rapidly.
High-quality video, audio and data links
are becoming inexpensive and practical
ways to share medical information.
In principle, doctors can now listen to,
watch and supervise examinations of pa
tients anywhere in the world that telecom
munications technologies can reach.
A typical session
During a typical telemedicine session re
cently, Dr. Chris Barnard, a Stanford der
matologist, examined a patient referred to
him by a practitioner in San Jose. The pa
tient appeared on a 24-inch television mon
itor about eight feet in front of Barnard.
The patient watched another video screen
showing an image of Barnard, also cap
tured by a video camera mounted on the
monitor.

"It's not quite TV quality," Katz cau
tioned, but she added that it is not as rough
as what one might expect from real-time
computer imaging.
Barnard asked the patient questions
and gives instructions to the doctor on site
in San Jose. The patient seems relaxed Jok
ing occasionally with Barnard and the
other doctor.
A high-resolution camera, calibrated for
color fidelity and light sensitivity, captured
detailed images of the patient's mouth,
neck and chin. The images are transmitted
immediately to Stanford and displayed on a
computer screen in front of Barnard, who
studied the photographic-quality images as
part of his diagnosis.
Measurements from almost any medical
equipment can be transferred digitally to
the specialist and stored at both Stanford
and the remote site and included in the pa
tient's medical record.
"We've tested all the equipment," said

Barnard. "We've gone through many dif
ferent cameras. The hardware issues have
been addressed, and we're at a very suc
cessful level in terms of getting an afford
able system in place."
Stanford currently has four remote
sites. Each site was chosen to explore dif
ferent aspects of telemedicine, Katz ex
plained.
Drew Medical Clinic in East Palo Alto
uses telemedicine to provide treatment to
patients who are either reluctant or unable
to come to Stanford for treatment. Many
clients are from minority backgrounds and
have very low income. Cultural and lan
guage barriers and lack of adequate trans
portation can make it difficult for some
East Palo Alto residents to visit Stanford
Hospital. Telemedicine, it is hoped, will
provide inexpensive and easy access to
Stanford specialists.
At the San Jose Medical Group, physi
cians also consult specialists at Stanford by
telemedicine. Although they have their
own specialists, the San Jose Medical
Group now offers consultation with Stan
ford specialists using telemedicine, elimi
nating the standard wait of several weeks
for a regular consultation.
The third site, located in Singapore, will

mostly be used for sharing information be
tween doctors, Katz said. There are no
plans to use it to diagnose patients remote
ly. .
In all locations, a crucial goal is "to ex
tend consultation while making it cost ef
fective," Katz said.
Lytton Gardens site
Stanford's fourth and most recent
telemedicine site is Lytton Gardens, a Palo
Alto nursing home. Like the other sites,
Lytton Gardens is primarily concerned
with improving clients' access to Stan
ford's medical specialists.
"One of the concerns for all nursing
homes is the physician's time and atten
tion," said Vera Goupille, the chief execu
tive officer of Lytton Gardens.
"We're always interested in improving
our relations with physicians," Goupille
said. "There are also patients in hospitals
who might be served just as well by a nurs-

ing home using telemedicine. Right now
we're looking at doing liver transplant pa
tients and some others."
Patients who are stable but still need
routine monitoring are well suited to
telemedicine, Goupille said. Nurses or pri
mary care doctors in the nursing home
would provide immediate care, with spe
cialists available for regular monitoring
and immediate consultation, if needed.
"This is the first time in the country this
has been tried by a nursing home," said
Jonathan Wilson, project manager at Lyt
ton Gardens.
"There's been a lot of reluctance by pa
tients here to go back and forth to a hospi
tal," Wilson said. "They usually go by am
bulance even if it's not an emergency be
cause it's the best mode of transportation.
That's very costly for the patient, inconve
nient, and scary for some people. I think
having the option to do a lot of that here is
much better for the patient."
According to Goupille, patient and staff
response has been very positive.
"They get to see the physicians and are
able to communicate," she said. "If there is
any reluctance, it's before anyone has actu
ally seen or used it. As soon as the staff or
patients see the quality of the pictures,

[any concern I just sort of melts."
The teleniedicine equipment at Lytton
Gardens is similar to that at the other three
remote sites and at Stanford. A high-end
personal computer controls the video and
data acquisition using software written by
md/tv inc., of Orlando, Florida. Daou Sys
tems Inc. of San Diego and Hewlett
Packard provided the hardware.
High-speed digital communication is
provided by six Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) lines, each operating at
about 1.5 million bits per second. At maxi
mum speed using all six lines simultane
ously, the entire Bible could be transmitted
in less than five seconds. The ISDN lines
are being paid for by Calßen, a fund creat
ed by Pacific Bell.
The separate ISDN lines are combined
and the digital information compressed by
a unit called a CODEC (for coder / de
coder). Four of these lines are combined to
carry the video signal while the other two

will eventually be used to transfer data
taken using medical equipment at Lytton
Gardens to the center at the Stanford Hos
pital.
No medical instruments are used in the
room while Lytton Gardens' needs are still
being evaluated, although an electrocar
diograph (ECG), a device used to record the
electrical activity of the heart, is a likely ad
dition.
"We're still in the developmental stage,
but our plan is to use it in monitoring
transplant patients and perhaps other pa
tients who need to be monitored on a regu
lar basis," said Goupille.
Although most of the technical issues
have been resolved, ways of organizing doc
tors to consult for Lytton Gardens by
telemedicine still has to be worked out.
"We're ready," said Goupille. "We're
waiting for Stanford to work out their
schedule. It's the logistics of the scheduling
now, and getting the routine down for
physicians to incorporate this into their
day, and access to the room. We are ready
and we could do it tomorrow."
The first teledermatology session at
Lytton Gardens will take place next Tues
day, said Barnard. "For Lytton Gardens
the only thing I need to work out is who will
be the primary care provider."
Like many nursing homes, Lytton Gar
dens makes use of a number of doctors dis
tributed throughout the community. In
this pilot project, Barnard said, the prima
ry care provider must be properly trained
to avoid false diagnoses.
The instruments used in telemedicine
are standard technology, but taking mean
ngful video images requires high-quality
equipment, carefully controlled lighting,
and an operator who is trained in how to
use the camera.
"You need to get a very sensitive cam
era," said Kai Yamaguchi, an intern and re
cent Stanford graduate who helped set up
the Lytton Gardens facility. "If they're not
used right, there's no way to get an accu
rate diagnosis."
"The accuracy of diagnosing over
telemedicine equipment has been shown to
be as effective as looking at protected Ko
dachromes (color slide film)," added
Barnard. Dermatologists are often trained
using images on Kodachromes, and board
exams often include making diagnoses
from protected Kodachromes.
Barnard together with second-year
medical student Ming Cheng and Dr.

Susan Schwetter are simultaneously creat
ing a database of patients treated during
the telemedicine sessions. Cheng enters
data on the patient including relevant, med
ical information such as images and other
data taken during the session. The data
base will then be used to check the diagno
sis during the telemedicine with a later di
agnosis by another doctor using the same
images. Preliminary tests have shown that
diagnoses during the telemedicine sessions
agree well with subsequent diagnoses,
Barnard said.
Future of telemedicine
Although much of the focus in telemedi
cine is on real-time video and data transfer,
not all telemedicine will be conducted live.
The most practical form telemedicine takes
may be more like fast electronic mail than
like live conversation.
"There are two mechanisms for
telemedicine," Barnard said. "One is a live
teleconsultation where we actually have
the patient or the patient's physician at the
remote site and we do the consultation live.
The other is asynchronous consultation,
where the images are captured at the local
site and sent to our workstation back at
Stanford. Probably the greatest savings are
going to be in doing asynchronous consul
tation."
The advantage of asynchronous
telemedicine is that doctors can consult a
patient's records within their own sched
ule, much like voice mail or electronic mail
is used today.
"If you 're doing a live consultation, they
have to have a scheduled time slot. The pa
tient, the referring physician and the spe
cialist all have to be there at the same time.
That is most likely the biggest disruption to
the schedule," Barnard said.
Barnard suggests that a telemedicine as
sistant could run most of the session with
the patient and the specialist, with the pri
mary doctor arriving near the end of the
session for consultation and feedback.
Another issue in diagnosing a patient by
telemedicine is the loss of touch and feel,
often important in diagnosing skin disor
ders and lesions.
"I'm really relying on history and visual
inspection. I don't have the ability to feel
the skin," Barnard said.
"Visual inspection and history provide
more than 90 percent of the information I
need," he continued. However, the other 10
percent may require that the patient come

to the hospital for an examination.
Some doctors also fear that the personal
contact between doctor and patient may be
lost. But, as Goupille pointed out, that loss
of contact may be a blessing for some pa
tients.
"Studies have shown that the patients
have more control," said Goupille.
"They're in their own territory. In some
ways it equalizes the playing field. It makes
up for some of the lost touch and feel. You
can adjust the screen to make the person
close up or far away. There is a distance be
tween the patient and the doctor which can
be a comfort."

'If there is any reluctance,
it's before anyone has actu
ally seen or used it. As
soon as the staff or patients
see the quality of the pic
tures, [any concern] just
sort of melts.'
— Vera Goupille

The current Stanford facilities are pilot
projects, mostly paid by donations from the
manufacturers of the equipment. Al
though costs are declining quickly, a typi
cal telemedicine site would be prohibitively
expensive for many private institutions
without substantial donations.
"We just don't happen to have $150,000
sitting around," said Goupille. "We may
find at the end of this study, as the technol
ogy evolves, that we don't need to spend
that amount. Would we do it at the end if
we still have to spend some money? We'd
have to look at what the tradeoff is, but I
don't think that we're going to get a free
ride forever."
Wilson agreed. "If you include all the
costs of laying the lines, plus all the hard
ware and software, plus all the time consul
tants have been working to fix all the
glitches, it would really add up. The contri
butions have been invaluable."
"I think that by going through this,
we're making it possible for other organi
zations to do this in a couple of years," he
added.

Acceptance into the medical infrastruc
ture is another major hurdle for telemedi
cine. Insurance companies, for example,
don't yet include telemedicine in their cov
erage.
Issues of liability also need to be re
solved. Barnard describes the arrangement
between Stanford and the San Jose Medical
Group as one possible model.
"Our agreement with San Jose is that
we share the liability with both providers,
but the primary care provider has the final
word. Our current agreement is basically
shared liability, with the specialist acting
as a consultant."
Before insurance companies will accept
telemedicine as valid treatment, Barnard
said, hospitals must show that telemedi
cine is both efficient and reliable. "The
point of our the research is to show this is a
cost effective system. . . .The main thing is
it has to be more cost-effective than cur
rent medicine."
Educational and peer-to-peer conferenc
ing are promising and less problematic
uses of telemedicine. Continuing medical

every practicing doctor's career which
could greatly benefit from widespread use
of telemedicine.

tions, or to archive a lot of cases."

it's possible for everyone to learn to use

gardless of their specialty."
Cheng agreed, saying, "The more expo
sure I can get as a student to something
that will be in use in the future, the better."
The current medical system, however, is
not designed to allow treatment of patients

telemedicine," Barnard said. "One is a live
teleconsultation where we actually have
the patient or the patient's physician at the
remote site and we do the consultation live.
The other is asynchronous consultation,
where the images are captured at the local
site and sent to our workstation back at
Stanford. Probably the greatest savings are
going to be in doing asynchronous consul
tation."
The advantage of asynchronous
telemedicine is that doctors can consult a
patient's records within their own sched
ule, much like voice mail or electronic mail
is used today.
"If you 're doing a live consultation, they
have to have a scheduled time slot. The pa
tient, the referring physician and the spe
cialist all have to be there at the same time.
That is most likely the biggest disruption to
the schedule," Barnard said.
Barnard suggests that a telemedicine as
sistant could run most of the session with
the patient and the specialist, with the pri
mary doctor arriving near the end of the
session for consultation and feedback.
Another issue in diagnosing a patient by
telemedicine is the loss of touch and feel,
often important in diagnosing skin disor
ders and lesions.
"I'm really relying on history and visual
inspection. I don't have the ability to feel
the skin," Barnard said.
"Visual inspection and history provide
more than 90 percent of the information I
need," he continued. However, the other 10
percent may require that the patient come

to the hospital for an examination.
Some doctors also fear that the personal
contact between doctor and patient may be
lost. But, as Goupille pointed out, that loss
of contact may be a blessing for some pa
tients.
"Studies have shown that the patients
have more control," said Goupille.
"They're in their own territory. In some
ways it equalizes the playing field. It makes
up for some of the lost touch and feel. You
can adjust the screen to make the person
close up or far away. There is a distance be
tween the patient and the doctor which can
be a comfort."

'If there is any reluctance,
it's before anyone has actu
ally seen or used it. As
soon as the staff or patients
see the quality of the pic
tures, [any concern] just
sort of melts.'
— Vera Goupille

The current Stanford facilities are pilot
projects, mostly paid by donations from the
manufacturers of the equipment. Al
though costs are declining quickly, a typi
cal telemedicine site would be prohibitively
expensive for many private institutions
without substantial donations.
"We just don't happen to have $150,000
sitting around," said Goupille. "We may
find at the end of this study, as the technol
ogy evolves, that we don't need to spend
that amount. Would we do it at the end if
we still have to spend some money? We'd
have to look at what the tradeoff is, but I
don't think that we're going to get a free
ride forever."
Wilson agreed. "If you include all the
costs of laying the lines, plus all the hard
ware and software, plus all the time consul
tants have been working to fix all the
glitches, it would really add up. The contri
butions have been invaluable."
"I think that by going through this,
we're making it possible for other organi
zations to do this in a couple of years," he
added.

Acceptance into the medical infrastruc
ture is another major hurdle for telemedi
cine. Insurance companies, for example,
don't yet include telemedicine in their cov
erage.
Issues of liability also need to be re
solved. Barnard describes the arrangement
between Stanford and the San Jose Medical
Group as one possible model.
"Our agreement with San Jose is that
we share the liability with both providers,
but the primary care provider has the final
word. Our current agreement is basically
shared liability, with the specialist acting
as a consultant."
Before insurance companies will accept
telemedicine as valid treatment, Barnard
said, hospitals must show that telemedi
cine is both efficient and reliable. "The
point of our the research is to show this is a
cost effective system. . . .The main thing is
it has to be more cost-effective than cur
rent medicine."
Educational and peer-to-peer conferenc
ing are promising and less problematic
uses of telemedicine. Continuing medical
education, or CME, is an important part of
every practicing doctor's career which
could greatly benefit from widespread use
of telemedicine.
"TeIeCME is made more possible
through the use of telemedicine," Barnard
points out. "The idea would be to hold a
large teleconference between two institu
tions, or to archive a lot of cases."
Information in the form of pictures and
measurements is already being stored in
telemedicine sessions so it can be made
available to other institutions.
"We're talking about a huge database,"
Barnard added. "Instead of libraries full of
books, we're talking about lots and lots of
cases that aren't photographed or recorded
except in medical records. I really believe
it's possible for everyone to learn to use
telemedicine as part of their training, re
gardless of their specialty."
Cheng agreed, saying, "The more expo
sure I can get as a student to something
that will be in use in the future, the better."
The current medical system, however, is
not designed to allow treatment of patients
across the country. Currently a doctor is li
censed to practice state-by-state, so a doc
tor in California can only treat patients in
California.
"In Texas, they are working on getting a
limited license for doctors who want to
work outside of Texas," Barnard noted.

Already, doctors must pass national
exams before beginning their practice.
Another critical element for telemedi
cine is fast data transfer. Without high
data rates, video images become choppy
and captured images are slow to transfer.
Efforts are also underway to build the in
frastructure, but even in technologically
advanced regions like the Bay Area, high
speed ISDN lines are expensive.
Although hardware and software costs
are decreasing, high-speed telecommunica
tions network may take longer to mature.
Strong government support will be crucial
if telemedicine is to be affordable and use
ful, especially in rural areas.
Impact on Stanford Students
Despite the Stanford Hospital's pioneer
ing work, Stanford students will not treat
ed by telemedicine in the near future.
"Cowell [Student Health Center] has
been mentioned as a possible site," said
Katz, "but not seriously explored."
Dr. Ira Freedman, director of Cowell
Student Health Services, concurs.
"We nave no plans to participate in a
telemedicine program," he said, stressing,
however, that Cowell is keenly monitoring
the growth of telemedicine.
"It's a potential for primary care in gen
eral, and we're one of the sites that's close
ly watching that kind of thing," he said.

Doctor Chris Barnard uses telecommuni

other cities.

Henry Hsu — Daily
The hours of waiting in a specialist's
office after weeks of delay may soon
be as quaint as the drills and ham
mers of last century's medics. Telemedi
cine, the linking of medical sites by high
speed telecommunication networks, is
rapidly changing the way we see doctors,
with Stanford at the forefront.
"Our goal is to implement telemedicine
for different uses," said Jana Katz, product
manager at the Stanford Medical School.
Stanford became involved in telemedi
cine in October 1993.
There are already dozens of telemedi
cine programs in the United States. How
ever, most are run by the military or the
prison system or operate in rural commu
nities where enormous distances or haz
ardous conditions make access to special
ists difficult.
Stanford, however, chose to focus on
urban sites. The goal is to make telemedi
cine work medically, economically and

technologically.
"Our program is research- and service
oriented," said Jana Katz, telemedicine
program manager at the Stanford Hospi
tal.
"We're taking a critical look at cost-ef
fectiveness and seed costs," she added.
Telegraphs, telephones and radio have
been used to transmit medical information
for decades, but digital and telecommuni
cations technology has matured rapidly.
High-quality video, audio and data links
are becoming inexpensive and practical
ways to share medical information.
In principle, doctors can now listen to,
watch and supervise examinations of pa
tients anywhere in the world that telecom
munications technologies can reach.
A typical session
During a typical telemedicine session re
cently, Dr. Chris Barnard, a Stanford der
matologist, examined a patient referred to
him by a practitioner in San Jose. The pa
tient appeared on a 24-inch television mon
itor about eight feet in front of Barnard.
The patient watched another video screen
showing an image of Barnard, also cap
tured by a video camera mounted on the
monitor.

"It's not quite TV quality," Katz cau
tioned, but she added that it is not as rough
as what one might expect from real-time
computer imaging.
Barnard asked the patient questions
and gives instructions to the doctor on site
in San Jose. The patient seems relaxed Jok
ing occasionally with Barnard and the
other doctor.
A high-resolution camera, calibrated for
color fidelity and light sensitivity, captured
detailed images of the patient's mouth,
neck and chin. The images are transmitted
immediately to Stanford and displayed on a
computer screen in front of Barnard, who
studied the photographic-quality images as
part of his diagnosis.
Measurements from almost any medical
equipment can be transferred digitally to
the specialist and stored at both Stanford
and the remote site and included in the pa
tient's medical record.
"We've tested all the equipment," said

Barnard. "We've gone through many dif
ferent cameras. The hardware issues have
been addressed, and we're at a very suc
cessful level in terms of getting an afford
able system in place."
Stanford currently has four remote
sites. Each site was chosen to explore dif
ferent aspects of telemedicine, Katz ex
plained.
Drew Medical Clinic in East Palo Alto
uses telemedicine to provide treatment to
patients who are either reluctant or unable
to come to Stanford for treatment. Many
clients are from minority backgrounds and
have very low income. Cultural and lan
guage barriers and lack of adequate trans
portation can make it difficult for some
East Palo Alto residents to visit Stanford
Hospital. Telemedicine, it is hoped, will
provide inexpensive and easy access to
Stanford specialists.
At the San Jose Medical Group, physi
cians also consult specialists at Stanford by
telemedicine. Although they have their
own specialists, the San Jose Medical
Group now offers consultation with Stan
ford specialists using telemedicine, elimi
nating the standard wait of several weeks
for a regular consultation.
The third site, located in Singapore, will

mostly be used for sharing information be
tween doctors, Katz said. There are no
plans to use it to diagnose patients remote
ly. .
In all locations, a crucial goal is "to ex
tend consultation while making it cost ef
fective," Katz said.
Lytton Gardens site
Stanford's fourth and most recent
telemedicine site is Lytton Gardens, a Palo
Alto nursing home. Like the other sites,
Lytton Gardens is primarily concerned
with improving clients' access to Stan
ford's medical specialists.
"One of the concerns for all nursing
homes is the physician's time and atten
tion," said Vera Goupille, the chief execu
tive officer of Lytton Gardens.
"We're always interested in improving
our relations with physicians," Goupille
said. "There are also patients in hospitals
who might be served just as well by a nurs-

ing home using telemedicine. Right now
we're looking at doing liver transplant pa
tients and some others."
Patients who are stable but still need
routine monitoring are well suited to
telemedicine, Goupille said. Nurses or pri
mary care doctors in the nursing home
would provide immediate care, with spe
cialists available for regular monitoring
and immediate consultation, if needed.
"This is the first time in the country this
has been tried by a nursing home," said
Jonathan Wilson, project manager at Lyt
ton Gardens.
"There's been a lot of reluctance by pa
tients here to go back and forth to a hospi
tal," Wilson said. "They usually go by am
bulance even if it's not an emergency be
cause it's the best mode of transportation.
That's very costly for the patient, inconve
nient, and scary for some people. I think
having the option to do a lot of that here is
much better for the patient."
According to Goupille, patient and staff
response has been very positive.
"They get to see the physicians and are
able to communicate," she said. "If there is
any reluctance, it's before anyone has actu
ally seen or used it. As soon as the staff or
patients see the quality of the pictures,

[any concern I just sort of melts."
The teleniedicine equipment at Lytton
Gardens is similar to that at the other three
remote sites and at Stanford. A high-end
personal computer controls the video and
data acquisition using software written by
md/tv inc., of Orlando, Florida. Daou Sys
tems Inc. of San Diego and Hewlett
Packard provided the hardware.
High-speed digital communication is
provided by six Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) lines, each operating at
about 1.5 million bits per second. At maxi
mum speed using all six lines simultane
ously, the entire Bible could be transmitted
in less than five seconds. The ISDN lines
are being paid for by Calßen, a fund creat
ed by Pacific Bell.
The separate ISDN lines are combined
and the digital information compressed by
a unit called a CODEC (for coder / de
coder). Four of these lines are combined to
carry the video signal while the other two

will eventually be used to transfer data
taken using medical equipment at Lytton
Gardens to the center at the Stanford Hos
pital.
No medical instruments are used in the
room while Lytton Gardens' needs are still
being evaluated, although an electrocar
diograph (ECG), a device used to record the
electrical activity of the heart, is a likely ad
dition.
"We're still in the developmental stage,
but our plan is to use it in monitoring
transplant patients and perhaps other pa
tients who need to be monitored on a regu
lar basis," said Goupille.
Although most of the technical issues
have been resolved, ways of organizing doc
tors to consult for Lytton Gardens by
telemedicine still has to be worked out.
"We're ready," said Goupille. "We're
waiting for Stanford to work out their
schedule. It's the logistics of the scheduling
now, and getting the routine down for
physicians to incorporate this into their
day, and access to the room. We are ready
and we could do it tomorrow."
The first teledermatology session at
Lytton Gardens will take place next Tues
day, said Barnard. "For Lytton Gardens
the only thing I need to work out is who will
be the primary care provider."
Like many nursing homes, Lytton Gar
dens makes use of a number of doctors dis
tributed throughout the community. In
this pilot project, Barnard said, the prima
ry care provider must be properly trained
to avoid false diagnoses.
The instruments used in telemedicine
are standard technology, but taking mean
ngful video images requires high-quality
equipment, carefully controlled lighting,
and an operator who is trained in how to
use the camera.
"You need to get a very sensitive cam
era," said Kai Yamaguchi, an intern and re
cent Stanford graduate who helped set up
the Lytton Gardens facility. "If they're not
used right, there's no way to get an accu
rate diagnosis."
"The accuracy of diagnosing over
telemedicine equipment has been shown to
be as effective as looking at protected Ko
dachromes (color slide film)," added
Barnard. Dermatologists are often trained
using images on Kodachromes, and board
exams often include making diagnoses
from protected Kodachromes.
Barnard together with second-year
medical student Ming Cheng and Dr.

Susan Schwetter are simultaneously creat
ing a database of patients treated during
the telemedicine sessions. Cheng enters
data on the patient including relevant, med
ical information such as images and other
data taken during the session. The data
base will then be used to check the diagno
sis during the telemedicine with a later di
agnosis by another doctor using the same
images. Preliminary tests have shown that
diagnoses during the telemedicine sessions
agree well with subsequent diagnoses,
Barnard said.
Future of telemedicine
Although much of the focus in telemedi
cine is on real-time video and data transfer,
not all telemedicine will be conducted live.
The most practical form telemedicine takes
may be more like fast electronic mail than
like live conversation.
"There are two mechanisms for
telemedicine," Barnard said. "One is a live
teleconsultation where we actually have
the patient or the patient's physician at the
remote site and we do the consultation live.
The other is asynchronous consultation,
where the images are captured at the local
site and sent to our workstation back at
Stanford. Probably the greatest savings are
going to be in doing asynchronous consul
tation."
The advantage of asynchronous
telemedicine is that doctors can consult a
patient's records within their own sched
ule, much like voice mail or electronic mail
is used today.
"If you 're doing a live consultation, they
have to have a scheduled time slot. The pa
tient, the referring physician and the spe
cialist all have to be there at the same time.
That is most likely the biggest disruption to
the schedule," Barnard said.
Barnard suggests that a telemedicine as
sistant could run most of the session with
the patient and the specialist, with the pri
mary doctor arriving near the end of the
session for consultation and feedback.
Another issue in diagnosing a patient by
telemedicine is the loss of touch and feel,
often important in diagnosing skin disor
ders and lesions.
"I'm really relying on history and visual
inspection. I don't have the ability to feel
the skin," Barnard said.
"Visual inspection and history provide
more than 90 percent of the information I
need," he continued. However, the other 10
percent may require that the patient come

to the hospital for an examination.
Some doctors also fear that the personal
contact between doctor and patient may be
lost. But, as Goupille pointed out, that loss
of contact may be a blessing for some pa
tients.
"Studies have shown that the patients
