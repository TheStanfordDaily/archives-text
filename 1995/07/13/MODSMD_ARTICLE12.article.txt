## A 						prize-winning Georgia satellite 
### 
Textbook engineering, and a little help from the
heavens, carried a team of Stanford researchers
across the finish line to a first-place performance at
the Fifth Annual Aerial Robotics Competition last
week in Atlanta.
The challenge: design an autonomous flying
robot. The task: locate six small metal disks scat
tered in a 6-foot ring, capture them one at a time,
then carry the disks over a tennis net and drop them
in a second 6-foot ring — without anyone directly
behind the helicopter's controls.
And do it all in the muggy, humid air of summer
in Georgia — the kind that wreaks havoc on gas
powered model helicopters trying to generate lift.
The three-person team from Stanford's Aero
space Robotics Laboratory to take up the challenge
included Stephen Morris, a former research associ
ate; Andrew Conway, who just received his doctor
ate, and doctoral student Bruce Woodley.
Assoc. Prof. Stephen M. Rock and Prof. Robert H.
Cannon, both of the Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, were the faculty advisers.
Aftermore than two years of research, fine-tun
ing of the engine and fuel mix and rigging of an array
of navigation equipment and a 486-equipped com
puter to their mechanical bird, the Stanford team
blew the competition away at the Georgia Institute
of Technology in Atlanta, where the Association for
Unmanned Vehicle Systems sponsored the affair.
They won on a wing and a prayer, appealing to the
skies above for some help.
The secret to the Stanford robot was its innova
tive use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for
satellite navigation.
By means of a continuous stream of information
sent out by a fleet of satellites orbiting the earth, the
helicopter was able to pinpoint its altitude and posi
tion within a centimeter. That data allowed the on
board computer to fly itself, according to Morris.
The GPS, originally designed for use by the mili
tary, is currently used by navigation systems rang
ing from seafaring vessels to lost mountain climbers.
Now aerial robots can be added to the list.
"We started out because plenty had been done on
robots that operated on land and in space," Morris
said. "But nobody had worked on anything in be
tween — in the atmosphere. We wanted to build a
flying robot."
In the marriage of GPS to the helicopter for self
navigation, the project had the formidable power of
other Stanford research behind them. Morris indi
cated that other students at Stanford had already
developed parts of the navigation system.
Although the vehicle wasn't able to capture all of
the disks and drop them off due to weight considera
tions, the showing was enough to garner first-prize
honors.
The Stanford team's robot was the first in the
competition's five-year history that was able to
achieve a stable hovering position or to pick up any
disks, Morris said.
The project also brought home a $7,000 purse.
