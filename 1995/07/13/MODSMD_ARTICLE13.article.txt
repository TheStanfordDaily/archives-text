# 14 win Fulbrights, will do graduate work overseas
## 
### 
While many Stanford students will be
leaving academics and pursuing a career in
the working world after their four years here,
nine recent graduates and five current doc
toral students will pursue study and research
abroad on Fulbright and relatedgrants.
According to the Overseas Resource Cen
ter at the Bechtel International Center, 14
students won full Fulbright Grants and three
others earned German Academic Exchange
Service Awards.
"It's a wonderful program," said Derek
Lewitton, who earned a law degree from
■Stanford this year. He has received support

from Stanford's Center for Conflict and Ne
gotiation in addition to a Fulbright Grant of
more than $20,000 in order to study methods
of conflict resolution in South Africa.
Created by Congress in 1946, the Ful
bright Program is intended to foster mutual
understanding among nations through edu
cational and cultural exchanges. The late
Sen. J. William Fulbright, primary sponsor of
the legislation, saw the program as a step to
ward building alternatives to armed combat.
"It's a heck of an opportunity to work on a
paper worth publishing," said Lewitton, who
was partly raised in South Africa and is ecsta

tic about going back to see some of his family.
"Nelson Mandela issued a plea to expatri
ate South Africans to come back and give to
the country in exchange for the benefits of
the education they received in South Africa,"
Lewitton said. "The Fulbright Scholarship
has made that possible for me."
Lewitton will be affiliated with the Center
of Applied Legal Studies at the University of
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, and also
plans to travel in Africa.
The Fulbright Program is currently the
U.S. government's premier scholarship pro
gram. However, Lewitton worried about its

future, questioning whether the program can
survive impending federal budget cuts.
Other Fulbright scholars from Stanford
this year included doctoral students Charles
Call, Ross Forman, John Shank, Deborah
Zetes and graduates Marshall Brickeen,
Michelle Friedland, Carlos Gallegos, Jean
Kim, Shan Liu, Elizabeth McKenna,
Michelle Rhee, Emily Schaffer and Eric Yoon.
German Academic Exchange Service
Award winners included graduates Andrew
Elia, Christian Heath and doctoral student
Bruce Lidl.
