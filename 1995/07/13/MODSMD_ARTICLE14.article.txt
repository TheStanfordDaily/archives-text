# China accuses Wu of spying
## U.S. officials given access to Wu for first time since his detention 
### 
Chinese authorities arrested human
rights activist and Hoover Institution
Research Fellow Hongda Harry Wu Sat
urday, accusing him of espionage.
But the weekend also brought re
newed hope for Wu's return, as Chinese
authorities finally agreed to allow U.S.
officials to visit him.
Wu, 58, has been held by Chinese au
thorities since June 19, when he was ap
prehended while crossing the border
from Kazakhstan into China. Until
Monday, China had denied U.S. officials
any contact with Wu, violating a con
sular agreement that grants access to
detained citizens within 48 hours of no
tification.
On Monday, U.S. Consul General Ar
turo Macias met with Wu for about half
an hour in a pretrial detention facility in
Wuhan, speaking with him by phone
through a glass partition.
It is unclear why the Hoover fellow
was brought to Wuhan, a city in central
China thousands of miles away from
where he was apprehended. One con
nection is that Wu lived in Wuhan in the
early 1980s, after he was released from
the Chinese prison-labor system and be
fore he emigrated to the United States.
Wu told Macias that he had enough
to eat, he had been examined by a doc
tor, and he was being held in an air-con
ditioned facility, State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a
press briefing yesterday. The meeting,
however, was monitored by Chinese of
ficials, Burns said.
Burns added that Macias gave Wu
books, newspapers and writing paper as
well as a list of Chinese attorneys. While
the State Department cannot provide
Wu with legal representation, the State
Department will "take a look at what we
can do," Burns said, "to assist in ar
ranging for legal representation."
The Chinese government accused
Wu of sneaking into China under false
names, stealing Chinese state secrets
and disseminating those secrets to in
stitutions and organizations outside

China, Burns said at a press briefing
Monday.
While some press reports have indi
cated that those crimes are punishable
by death in China, Burns said yesterday
that the State Department is still re
searching what potential penalties the
accusations against Wu might imply.
Macias was not allowed to talk to Wu
about the charges against him, Burns
said. Wu therefore might be unaware of

the nature and extent
of the charges against
him.
Wu has not yet been
formally charged with
specific crimes, Burns
said. The case is cur
rently in what Chinese
officials call a pretrial
investigation phase, he
said.

Wu will be tried by the local judicial
department in Wuhan, according to a
report by the official Xinhua News
Agency.
The U.S.-China Consular Conven
tion does not require the Chinese gov
ernment to grant access to Wu again for
another month, but Burns said U.S. of
ficials are pushing for more frequent
visits in Wu's case.
Wu's situation has attracted atten
tion on the highest levels of govern
ment. Wu's wife, Ching-lee Wu, trav
eled to Washington this week to appeal
to government leaders to pressure Wu's
return. She met with House Speaker
Newt Gingrich on Tuesday and is con
tinuing her lobbying efforts in Wash
ington.
"I think the Chinese should realize
that what Harry does is . . . good for the
Chinese people, for the next genera
tion," she said last Thursday, before Wu
was arrested.
Wu's arrest is just one of a number of
events that have strained U.S.-China
relations of late. Last month, the Unit
ed States granted a visa to Taiwan's
president, Lee Teng-hui, to attend a re

union at Cornell University. The Unit
ed States stressed that it still adhered to
its policy of treating Taiwan as part of
China, but the government of China
took offense at what it considered a ges
ture toward recognizing Taiwan as an
independent state.
China subsequently recalled its am
bassador from Washington and has
withheld approval of the new U.S. am
bassador to China, Jim Sasser.
The U.S. and Chinese governments
have also been at odds over Chinese oil
trade deals with Iran and allegations by
the Central Intelligence Agency that
China has delivered missile components
to Iran and Pakistan.
As much as Wu's situation seems to
be a product of the deterioration of
U.S.-China relations, his arrest also
seems to be exacerbating the tension be
tween the two nations.
"The way to resolve it is for the Chi
nese to conclude that it's in the best in
terest of the United States and China to
have Mr. Wu released, to be returned
safely and freely to the United States,'
Burns said.
But while the State Department con
tinues to step up pressure, the Chinese
government has made no decisive ges
ture suggesting it is ready to release
Wu.
Wu spent 19 years as a political pris
oner in China's labor camps, or "lao
gai," after he was arrested in 1960 for
criticizing the Communist Party. He
has since dedicated hie life to exposing
inhumane conditions and practices in
the laogai.
To that end, Wu founded the Laogai
Research Foundation in 1991. He has
also written two books on his experi
ences in the laogai ana has returned to
China several times to document condi
tions in the camps. He has also testified
before Congress and international
human rights organizations and has
been honored with numerous human
rights awards.
