# Policy on violence enacted
## Weapons outlawed, both threats and acts remain punishable under a codification of existing rules 
### 
In an attempt to ensure greater secu
rity in the workplace, Stanford officials
have enacted a new policy regarding vio
lence and threats of violence.
The policy bans all weapons from
campus and makes employees subject to
disciplinary action if they engage in acts
of violence, make threats of violence or
level false charges against other employ
ees. It also outlines ways for employees,
supervisors and security personnel to re
spond to and control violent acts or
threats.
"The policy is not saying anything dif
ferent," said Keith Smith, manager of
Employee Relations. "It is simply codify
ing the existing rules,"
However, according to Smith, the pol
icy seeks to respond to some preoccupa
tion over safety.
"There is an anxiety about security,
largely because the campus is so accessi

ble, so wide open," Smith said.
On an average weekday, Stanford has
a population of approximately 30,000.
Last year, 33 cases of assault, including
four aggravated assaults, seven rob
beries, one rape and one sexual assault
were reported, according to Campus Re
port.
Additionally, 15 cases of weapons of
fenses were reported, including seven
that involved firearms. In comparison
with other communities of similar size,
these figures fell well below the average.
The policy "was designed to raise
awareness and give guidelines for people
in the workplace," said David Rasch, di
rector of the Stanford Help Center.
Rasch convened a task force in No
vember 1994 to address issues related to
workplace safety.
"The task force was convened in part
to coordinate responses," said Rasch.

Members of the task force included
representatives from Public Safety,
Medical Center Security, Counseling and
Psychological Services and Training and
Organizational Development. Other
members included personnel managers
from the main campus, SLAC, the Med
ical School and Stanford Hospital, as well
as Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington.
Most large employers have already
adopted policies similar to Stanford, with
much success, but officials don't expect
to see a dramatic drop in Stanford's
crime rate, Smith said.
At the least, the policy will make Stan
ford a safer place by making "people
more secure knowing that their needs
are attended to," he added.
The new policy will go into effect on
September 1.
