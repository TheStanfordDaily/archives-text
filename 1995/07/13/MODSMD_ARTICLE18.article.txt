# Solar car wins fifth, off to land of rising sun
## 
### 
After 10 days of racing under the hot rays
of the summer sun, Afterburner — Stan
ford's third and possibly final solar car —
took fifth place in the 1,200-mile Sunrayce
1995 and may have spurred a renewal of in
terest in the future of the six-year-old Stan
ford Solar Car Project.
This year's placement in the biannual
Sunrayce competition from Indianapolis to
Denver matched the fifth-place perfor
mance of the Project's second solar car,
SUnSUrfer, in Sunrayce 1993.
"The competition was definitely more
difficult this year," said Dorian West, a me
chanical engineering major who has been
with the project for more than two years.
"The speeds were much higher."
Despite experiencing some harrying
technical difficulties with the motor and the
solar cells, which slowed the car down, the
team managed to pass three cars with only
50 miles left in the race.
West noted that the small size of the crew
who worked on the construction of the Af
terburner — only nine students — was a no

table obstacle, leaving the team to grapple
with technical questions throughout the
race.
"We've had a small team. If we had
enough people working, we could have done
better on the race," West said.
According to West, the Afterburner's
solar panels — which consisted of 4-inch
solar cells soldered together — were assem
bled by an outside firm so the team could at
tach them to the car with little fuss.
"We had a lot of problems with the solar
cells shorting out," West said. "We actually
had some fires."
"We increased the efficiency of the solar
cells by approximately 30 percent" over the
course of the race, West said.
The team also found itself wrangling
with a testy motor. West noted that the car
did not run a test drive with the newly in
stalled motor.
"We couldn't know the efficiency of the
motor," he said. "If we could have taken the
car through a test race, we could have got
ten third."

After the Sunrayce, the Japanese news
paper Yomuri Shimbum invited the team to
participate in a three-day, eight-hour race
in Japan including teams from Honda and
Nissan as well as the UC-Berkeley and
George Washington University teams.
The newspaper company will pay all ex
penses for five students and the Afterburn
er to participate in the race, which will take
place in Sazuka, Japan, just outside of
Tokyo, from Aug. 4-6.
The success of the Afterburner may have
been the boost needed to re-energize the
Solar Car Project's tenuous future.
The project has demanded long hours of
hands-on work from its members, particular
ly because of wavering student participation.
"Team members that went along who
were new are enthusiastic'' about keeping
the project alive, said West.
But they realize the need to make involvement
in the project more amenable to students inter
ested in working on the car while taking a full
course load during the year.
"The people who are interested in con

tinuing the project are looking at ways more
congenial for student involvement — ways
to open it up more to students," West said.
"There are a few of us who are thinking
about trying to get a project started for
1997," said Tom Lee, who just finished his
freshman year.
West noted that although many of the
students on this year's crew have graduated
or are burned out, there is still hope that
newcomers might carry on the tradition of
building one of the lowest-budget, high-per
formance solar race cars in the nation.
"The thing that makes the project at
Stanford special is that it's a student project
— and not the professors' designing the
stuff with the students working for them,"
West said.
The Afterburner's crew in Sunrayce *95
included Lee, West, senior Kate von Reis,
recent graduates Chris Shaw and lan Huta
galung, senior Michelle Koh, junior John
Angwin, sophomore Forrest Deuth and
graduate student Rob Bernier.
