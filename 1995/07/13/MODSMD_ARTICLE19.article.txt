## Summer women's basketball 
### John Yung 
Women's basketball fans can rejoice — the
once-dormant summer off-season is now the prime
time for the San Francisco Bay Area Women's
Summer Basketball League.
John Greenberg, who has run the men's league
for 16 years, said he started the women's league
because of the wide interest in women's basketball
in the Bay Area.
"It's going to be a good, fun event for partici
pants and Bay Area fans." Greenberg said. "This
year I decided to take some time to organize the
women's league."
The newly formed league began the season on
July 8 and plays every Saturday at Kezar Pavilion.
The games offers area college players a chance to
continue honing their skills in anticipation of the
upcoming season.
Although NCAA rules prevent coaches from
watching their players in action, many are sup
portive of the league, including Stanford coach
Tar a VanDerveer.
The league has six teams named after places in
the Bay Area: Contra Costa, Oakland, Marin, San
Jose, San Francisco and South Bay. Each team
contains a current Stanford player. Stanford fans
who have been watching women's basketball for a
few years will recognize most of the faces on the
South Bay team. The squad, coached by former
Cardinal quarterback John Paye, includes his sis
ter Kate Paye, Anita Kaplan, Christy Hedgpeth,
Molly Goodenbour, Rachel Hemmer and Heather
Owen.
Kaplan, Goodenbour, Hemmer, Hedgpeth and
Paye, all former Cardinal, first played together on
the 1991-92 National Championship team.
Other teams in the league also have Cardinal
players, with Kate Starbird playing for Marin,
Jamila Wideman for Oakland, Vanessa Nygaard
for San Francisco, Charmin Smith for San Jose
and Tara Harrington for Contra Costa.
"South Bay is overwhelming in quality." Green
berg said. "Hopefully the other teams can make a
match."
The coaches organize and recruit individuals
for the team; they are not restricted to their im
mediate areas. The league has an open-roster poli
cy allowing any player to join during the season;
however, it does require that, each team have at
least one outstanding high school player. Standard
NCAA rules are used during the games.
On opening day, South Bay defeated San Fran
cisco on opening day 127 to 97; Pave led all scorers
with 23, while Goodenbour contributed 24. Marin
nipped Contra Costa in the opening game, 76 to
73; Harrington led Contra Costa with 19. San Jose

also won, beating Oakland 83 to 70.
Tipoff begins at noon, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. each
Saturday; the regular season runs until Aug. 6.
The playoffs start one week later, on Aug. 12, and
the championship game is played on Aug. 19.
Kezar Pavilion is in San Francisco at the inter
section of Waller and Slammen Streets.
