## Stadium 
### Final Four 
There's going to be a big party
in 1999.
The NCAA Division I Women's
Basketball Committee selected
the San Jose Arena as the site for
the 1999 NCAA Women's Basket
ball Final Four.
The bid was made in conjunc
tion with Stanford, which will
serve as the host for the event, to
take place March 26 and 28 of that
year.
"It is a great honor for Stanford
University and the city of San Jose
to host the biggest women's colle
giate athletic event in America,"
Senior Associate Athletic Director
Cheryl said. "Women's col
lege basketball has been growing
in popularity in the Bay Area and
nationally for several years. I
think it's a win-win situation for
everyone."
The much-anticipated event is
expected to boost the economy and
recognition of San Jose and the
Bay Area. The 1995 Final Four
added approximately $6 million
into the economy of Minneapolis,
Minn. Ijevick stated that she ex
pects the economic impact to be
twice that in 1999.
Stanford has been planning to
bring a Final Four to the area for
10 years. This specific bid took
over a year.
"We had the best team in
putting Ithe bidl all together,"

Athletic Director Ted I said.
"It's a real compliment to a num
ber of people."
The team comprised represen
tatives of Stanford and the San
Jose Sports Authority. Tt present
ed its bid to the committee during
the summer meetings in Cape
Cod, Mass. On July 5, the commit
tee called, announcing its selec
tion.
"This is a great boost for bas
ketball on the West Coast," Stan
ford head coach Tar a VanDerveer
said. "To be able to host it is very
exciting for me.
"It'll be a big carrot for our
team to [try to] be playing in it,"
Van Dei-veer said.
Swimming
The Stanford men's swim team
has lost one of its key members.
Joe Hudepohl, an Olympic
Gold medal winner in Barcelona,
gave up his scholarship in order to
train for the 1996 Olympic games
in Atlanta.
Considered the top college re
cruit in the nation out of high
school, Hudepohl helped the Car
dinal to two national champi
onships. However, he has not won
an individual NCAA title.
Hudepohl will now train with
Jack Simon, who was his coach be
fore college.
The Oakland Raiders will move
mce again and become the Stanford
Raiders when they play the New
England Patriots at Stanford Stadi
um, Aug. 25.
"We're delighted that Stanford
has agreed to host the Patriots
game," Oakland Coliseum Presi
dent George Vukasin said. "It's a
fine stadium, they know how to
-aage big events and they are excel
lent people to work with."
The NFL preseason game will be
the first home game for the Raiders
in the Bay Area since they moved
back from Los Angeles.
The game could not be played at
the Coliseum because the Oakland
A's will play a home game on the
same day.
