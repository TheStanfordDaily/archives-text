# Professional sports, racism and society

### 
Baseball is in need of seri
ous help. When a Japan
ese import is looked upon
as the savior for a quintessen-
American occupation, I
can't help but fall down and roll
on the floor in laughter.
The Japanese are not first on
my list of knights in shining
armor.
Neither are the Chinese or

the Christian
Coalition.
The first two
took over my
grandparents'
country and oc
cupied it for
various periods
of time, impos
ing martial law
at will and seiz-

ing political
prisoners. The third is attempt
ing to do the same with my coun
try.
My biases aside, I can admire
Hideo Nomo.
Nomo is a man doing what I
always wanted to do — pitch in
the Major Leagues.
I have to disagree with his
choice of teams; I would have
preferred him in Pirate black
and gold rather than that dull
shade of blue. But I can't take
anything away from his accom
plishments.
Not only is he leading the Na
tional League in strike outs, he's
second in the NL in ERA, has a
sterling 6-1 record and started
the All-Star game, pitching two
shut-out innings, striking out
three.
More amazingly, he appar
ently hasn't encountered the
racism that many minority play
ers have had to face before him.
Moses Fleetwood, the first

black to play in the majors, was
eventually forced out by some of
the all-time greats in baseball.
Jackie Robinson had to endure
more than three years of taunts,
headhunting and dirty plays be
fore he got the chance to fight
back.
Roberto Clemente was con
sidered a whiner, a person who
faked injuries and a detriment to
his team before people realized
his true greatness after his
death.
More recently, Michael
Chang and Kristi Yamaguchi,
despite their successes — a
French Open title and Olympic
gold medal — could not get their
foot inside Madison Avenue. Ya
maguchi was considered too gig
gly, and Chang, well, he was too
Asian, i.e. too short.
Yamaguchi has made inroads
— she has been featured in ad
vertisements for milk. However,
she is an attractive female and a
figure skater, which plays to two
of America's fetishes — yellow
fever and figure skater lust.
There still is racism in sports.
Petulant, moody and a whin
er are adjectives that are exclu
sively applied to blacks and Lati
nos. When was the last time you
heard one of those terms applied
to a white athlete? (Christian
Laettner doesn't count.)
And that word athlete. Most
of the time, a black or Latino
star is referred to as an athletic
person, someone with loads of
talent which got him to where he
is.
A white person almost always
is referred to as hard-working,
getting the most out of his tools.
