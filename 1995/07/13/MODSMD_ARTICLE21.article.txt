Baseball is in need of seri
ous help. When a Japan
ese import is looked upon
as the savior for a quintessen-
American occupation, I
can't help but fall down and roll
on the floor in laughter.
The Japanese are not first on
my list of knights in shining
armor.
Neither are the Chinese or

the Christian
Coalition.
The first two
took over my
grandparents'
country and oc
cupied it for
various periods
of time, impos
ing martial law
at will and seiz-

ing political
prisoners. The third is attempt
ing to do the same with my coun
try.
My biases aside, I can admire
Hideo Nomo.
Nomo is a man doing what I
always wanted to do — pitch in
the Major Leagues.
I have to disagree with his
choice of teams; I would have
preferred him in Pirate black
and gold rather than that dull
shade of blue. But I can't take
anything away from his accom
plishments.
Not only is he leading the Na
tional League in strike outs, he's
second in the NL in ERA, has a
sterling 6-1 record and started
the All-Star game, pitching two
shut-out innings, striking out
three.
More amazingly, he appar
ently hasn't encountered the
racism that many minority play
ers have had to face before him.
Moses Fleetwood, the first

black to play in the majors, was
eventually forced out by some of
the all-time greats in baseball.
Jackie Robinson had to endure
more than three years of taunts,
headhunting and dirty plays be
fore he got the chance to fight
back.
Roberto Clemente was con
sidered a whiner, a person who
faked injuries and a detriment to
his team before people realized
his true greatness after his
death.
More recently, Michael
Chang and Kristi Yamaguchi,
despite their successes — a
French Open title and Olympic
gold medal — could not get their
foot inside Madison Avenue. Ya
maguchi was considered too gig
gly, and Chang, well, he was too
Asian, i.e. too short.
Yamaguchi has made inroads
— she has been featured in ad
vertisements for milk. However,
she is an attractive female and a
figure skater, which plays to two
of America's fetishes — yellow
fever and figure skater lust.
There still is racism in sports.
Petulant, moody and a whin
er are adjectives that are exclu
sively applied to blacks and Lati
nos. When was the last time you
heard one of those terms applied
to a white athlete? (Christian
Laettner doesn't count.)
And that word athlete. Most
of the time, a black or Latino
star is referred to as an athletic
person, someone with loads of
talent which got him to where he
is.
A white person almost always
is referred to as hard-working,
getting the most out of his tools.
Warren Moon, Randall Cun


Emery Chen
ningham and Steve McNair are
considered athletic quarterbacks.
Joe Montana, Jim Kelly and Dan
Marino are considered great quar
terbacks, ones who make the most
of their talent.
One of the differences between
the two groups is that the first three
are black and the second three are
white.
Steve Young is probably the only
white quarterback that might be
considered "athletic.'' However, he
is most often referred to as the
"running" quarterback.
Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken
are two of the hardest working stars
in Major League baseball. Ken Grif
fey Jr. and Frank Thomas are the
two stars who make the game look
so easy and haven't had that really,

really big career year yet.
Chad Curtis and Lenny Dykstra
are two gritty center fielders mak
ing the most out of their talent.
Kenny Lofton is the athletic basket
ball player who can still do more.
McGwire, Ripken, Curtis and
Dykstra are, you guessed it, white.
Griffey, Thomas and Lofton, ar
guably the three best in the Ameri
can League, are black.
Until this year, Eddie Murray, a
black first baseman who was one of
the most consistent players in base
ball, was considered sullen and
aloof and a bad presence in the club
house. Many who played with and
coached him — Jim Palmer and
Earl Weaver among many others —
consider Murray the most profes
sional person they know.
A columnist berates Barry
Bonds, considered by some to be the
best all-around baseball player in
the game, and asks for him to be
traded. Did he ask for Will Clark,

considered by some former team
mates to be a racist, to be traded de
spite his lack of production?
I'm not sure, as I wasn't around
when Clark was in the Bay Area.
Nomo hasn't faced such prob
lems — yet. In Japan, he was con
sidered to be a problem, one who
didn't play within the rules and
shook up the status quo. In fact,
many wanted him to fail in spring
training and see Chan Ho Park, the
Korean pitcher who made a similar
splash last year, succeed.
That wasn't racism. That was
just the media showing its dislike
for things Nomo did in Japan.
Currently, the media is blowing
off Nomo's terseness as difficulties
communicating in English. In a
year or so, when Nomo gets better
at English, will the media be as for
giving?
The United States has been
kinder to Japan in the past year
than it has previously. Americans

have exhibited sympathy over the
Kobe earthquake and subway
gassings.
Maybe hatred for Asians and mi
norities is decreasing. After all,
Nike did air a Nomo ad.
However, much remains to be
seen. This nation is shifting to the
right and restricting rights like
never before. There is an isolation
ist mood sweeping across America.
The only good Asian American is
a good-looking female Asian Ameri
can, and the poster girl, Connie
Chung, has fallen into disgrace.
Maybe baseball is on the right
track and Nomo is the savior.
Then again, maybe it's not base
ball that's in serious trouble and in
need of his help.
Maybe it's America.

Emery says everyone is racist and
sexist, it's ingrained in all of us.
After all, we're taught to notice dif
ferences.
