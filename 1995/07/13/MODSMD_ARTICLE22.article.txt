# Ex-Cardinal shake up Wimbledon
## 
### Emery Chen Editorial staff 
Twelve former Stanford tennis players competed
at Wimbledon this year; two helped make history, al
beit in vastly different ways.
The most notable was Jeff Tarango. Tarango,
after winning his first round match, upset Andrei
Mevedev of Ukraine in a four-set match. The fiery
lefty then faced Alexander Mronz of Germany but de
faulted the match when he walked off the court in the
middle of the second set. Tarango was subsequently
fined $15,500.
The other, Jonathan Stark, helped Martina
Navratilova win her 19th title at Wimbledon. The
mixed doubles team defeated Sandon Stolle of Aus
tralia and Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States
7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-3 in the finals. The pair of Stark and
Navratilova, despite Navratilova's "retirement,"
may team up for this year's U.S. Open.
In women's doubles, former Cardinal Meredith
McGrath teamed with Larisa Neiland of Latvia to
sweep into the semifinals, where they lost to the top
seeded team of American Gigi Fernandez and
Natasha Zvereva of Belarus. McGrath and Neiland
fell 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (7-9), 6-2.
In men's singles action, Patrick McEnroe, a team
mate of Tarango at Stanford, was the first of two con
secutive former Cardinal to fall to No. 1 Andre Agas
si. McEnroe lost in the second round in straight sets.
David Wheaton soon followed in McEnroe's foot
steps. Agassi took four sets to defeat Wheaton in the
third round.
Also losing in the third round was Jared Palmer.
Two-time defending champion Pete Sampras took
four sets to knock off the 75th-ranked Palmer. Der
rick Rostagno, a free spirit in his own right, was one
of the four former Cardinal who lost in the third
round of the men's draw. Rostagno fell to Todd Mar
tin in a five-set match on a day where the Centre
Court reached temperatures above 100 degrees.
On the women's side, Tami Whitlinger-Jones was
the only former Stanford player to advance past the
first round. After defeating Kimberly Po of the Unit
ed States, Whitlinger-Jones disposed of Ann Gross
man, also of the United States, in straight sets, 6-1,

6-4. However, she fell to sixth-seed Kimiko Date of
Japan in three sets in the third round, 1-6, 6-3, 6-3.
In men's doubles, McEnroe and former Stanford
player Jim Grabb, the fifth seed, were upset in the
first round by Scott Draper and Peter Tramacchi,
both from Australia, in four sets. Tarango and Hen
rik Holm of Sweden ironically won by default in the
first round before falling to the second seed. Todd
Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde of Australia ran
through Tarango and Holm in straight sets.
Stark teamed with Byron Black of Zimbabwe and
won their first two matches before losing to Marc
Goellner of Germany and Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia in three straight tie-breaks. The scores of the
tie-breaks were 7-4, 7-3 and 8-6.
The most famous Stanford tennis player, John
McEnroe, the brother of Patrick McEnroe — and the
previous holder, before Tarango, of the record for the
largest fine levied at Wimbledon — commentated.
