## BIG BASH FOR MICROBREWERIES Sneak peek at this weekend's Small Brewers Festival 
### Priscilla Wu 
Another weekend here at Stan
ford and what are you going to do?
Well, I suppose you could head
over to the mall again to check out
all those great sales. Or perhaps
you would prefer to cruise on down
to University Avenue to drink
some more cafe mocha.
This weekend's Seventh Annu
al Small Brewers Festival of Cali
fornia will lure you away from the
temptations of window-shopping
and cafe hopping. Downtown
Mountain View will be expecting
over 35,000 visitors for the festival
on Saturday and Sunday. This
nonprofit event is one of the
largest microbrew festivals in Cal
ifornia, and features more than
125 premium microbrews from

more than 40 different microbrew
eries in California, Oregon and
Washington.
For all you beer drinkers out
there (and even you non-beer
drinkers), this may be a good time
for you to get out and try some
thing new. Many of California's
top microbreweries will be there,
giving you a prime opportunity to
taste their beers.
The brews showcased will not
be of the Budweiser / Coors / Key
stone Light genre, which you could
find at any fraternity party here on
campus (sorry). What you will find
are premium, great-tasting micro
brews made with only the finest in
gredients.
Now wait a second, you say, I
thought all beers were made to
taste like water so you could chug
fast and get drunk cheap. Not true,
my misguided friend. x "'
As we begin our journey to beer
enlightenment, your first ques
tion might be, "What exactly is a
microbrewery?" According to the
Institute for Brewing Studies in
Boulder, Colo-, a mierobrewery
produces less than 15,000 barrels
of beer in one year. (For all you
trivia freaks, one barrel is equiva
lent to i 13.8 eases; a half-barrel is
one keg.)
Some of tffb larger raicrobrews
eries have outgrown this defini
tion, and have begun to use the
terms "specially brewery* or
"craft brewery." Don't let these,
technical terms intimidate you.'
They mean roughly the same
thing.
These brewers make beers
using only traditional ingredients
and methods. With only four basic
ingredients in their beers — bar
ley, hops, yeast and water —
there's no mystery to where the
fullness and variety of the flavors
come from. Bigger brewers use
other grains like corn and rice to
produce alcohol cheaply, even

though these
adjuncts con
tribute little or
no flavor or
color.
The micro
brewing indus
try has become
bigger in the
beverage scene
within the past
five to 10
years. In 1985,
there were
only 21 micro
breweries and
eight brew
pubs in the
United States.
By the end of
1994, the total
had reached
537, and it is
still growing.
Experts esti
mate that dur
ing the simmer
of 1995,:. a new

brewery or
brew pub will open somewhere in
the United States every other day.
Specialty breweries are growing
not only in number, but also in
stee* TJbe Palo Alto-based Pete's
Brewing Company, for example,
experienced .153 percent growth
last year alone.
•J: 1 Even with this tremendous
growth, specialty beers only com
prise about 1.5 percent of the en
tire beer industry. By. comparison,
Anheuser-Busch held a full 45
percent of the market share iast
year,
112 I OK, OK, What do all these num
bers mean, anyway? The micro
brewery industry is skyrocketing
in popularity. These beers are
good. Very good. Beer drinkers
have finally decided that they will
no longer blindly accept pale, low
bodied, lightly-flavored beers that
are barely worth the three bucks

you might pay for a 12-pack.
In addition to the festival's
beer-sampling, there will be a na
tionwide home brew competition
sponsored by the American Home
brewers Association. More than
150 different creations were en
tered in the competition last year.
For those who dream of becom
ing beer connoisseurs, there will be
information booths set up to pro
vide tips on brewing and general
beer education.
Lest you begin to think that this
is just going to be one bigbrew-haha
with only suds to drink, a variety of
Bay Area restaurants will keep you
from getting hungry. On hand will
be Polio's, California BBQ, Kapp's
Pizza Bar & Grill and my personal
favorite, Sausage Kingdom. With
your beer in one hand and your
sausage in the other, what more
could vou ask for?

How about a little music. A full
array of live entertainment is
scheduled, featuring bands play
ing blues, rock and roll, Irish / folk
and country. It's going to be one
big party, and it's for a good cause,
too. All proceeds go to local chari
ties. This festival is sure to be a
huge hit — a big bash for micro
brews.
