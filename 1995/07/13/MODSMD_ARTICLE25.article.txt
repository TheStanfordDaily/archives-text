## Apollo 13 
### 
You don't have to be a NASA histori
an to know the ending of "Apollo 13" be-

fore the movie even starts; it's no secret
that no one dies. Since suspense rarely works
when a story's end is known at the beginning,
you're probably wondering how director Ron
Howard makes the two-hour close call even re
motely intriguing. You're not alone. I'm still
wondering after a week of thinking about it.
The slightly contrived foreshadowing cer
tainly has nothing to do with it. Marilyn
Lovell's (Kathleen Quinlan) wedding ring
didn't have to slip off in the shower for us to re
alize that she was worried about her husband
Jim (Tom Hanks) Hying to the moon.
Although the special effects and cinematog
raphy are often spectacular, they are not much
more stunning than last week's evening news
footage of the historica U.S.-Russian link-up in
space. If the images achieve anything, they
make outer space seem terrifyingly enormous.
As the three-man crew drifts further into jeop
ardy, a universe that has been the playing field
for their most glorious dreams seems to become
a prison — with no possibility of escape.
The frantic dialogue between the astronauts
and the control room makes the film even more
nerve-wracking. The flight director on the
ground, Gene Krantz (Ed Harris), keeps his
fears in control with cigarettes and steely
nerves. Countless others scream and shout as
engineers struggle to figure out ways to make a
circle fit a square and to conserve the meager
remnants of the space craft's energy (which at
one point can barely fuel a coffee pot). All the
while, the tension mounts so high that the end

ing history has already written fades beneath
the suspense.
When the country develops a high-grade fever
to know every detail of the astronaut's ordeal, TV
networks nationwide devote their coverage al
most exclusively to the progress of the mission.
Broadcast footage with Walter Cronkite makes
the 25-year-old event seem as if it is unfolding
right there in the theater. The movie-theater au
dience forgets that it's not 1970.
As precious time begins to run out, Mission
Control keeps the astronauts hopeful, reveal
ing the weariness of their own battered hopes
only to the audience. All eyes and hearts fixate

on three men floating toward earth unsure of
just how daunting the odds against them are.
After a week of tireless effort, Apollo's final mo
ments in space, and the uncertainty of a safe re
turn to earth, reduce the power of technology to
the last viable option: crossed fingers.
When it's all over, the fate of this mission
NASA called a "successful failure" is no sur
prise. You knew they were coming home all
along. Somewhere between an action thriller
and an informative documentary, "Apollo 13"
feels like a history lesson you might learn on a
roller coaster.
