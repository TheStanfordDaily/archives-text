# Stanford alum Newman reinvents psychology
## Author launches an attack on traditional thinking â€” and offers a possible substitute 
### Samuel Park Staff writer 
Stanford alumnus and clinical
therapist Fred Newman is doing
to traditional psychology what
the iconoclastic thinker Camille
Paglia has done to modern femi
nism. In his new book "Let's De
velop!", Newman deconstructs
mainstays and debunks myths in
his field.
"The problem with conven
tional psychology is that it is not
as effective as many people be
lieve it to be," Newman said.
"There is a very profound focus
on insights and understandings,
and I think this methodology is
often mistaken.
"My opinion is that traditional
psychiatry, whether it has
Freudian, behavioral, or chemical
approaches, is not as helpful as it
could be," Newman said.

In fact, he said he sees it as
sometimes preventing people
from getting real help. What he
argues for instead is engaging in
creative activity to transform how
one feels and regards oneself.
"There is a movement within
psychology, of which I am a part
of, that comes to psychotherapeu
tic work with an approach more
consistent with helping people to
perform and to develop," New
man said.
This approach is based on peo
ple creating their own lives by
breaking out of what he sees as
"societally overdetermined roles
and standards." According to
Newman, this process of develop
ment can cure everything from
depression, anxiety and even
breaking addictions.
"Addiction is a pseudo-scientif
ic fiction that mocks Western sci
ence. It is one of the classical late

20th century examples of an at
tempt to generalize a fundamen
tal fact," Newman said.
In his book, Newman writes
that "there is no such thing [as
addiction). What there is, of
course, is a multi-billion dollar ad
dictions industry, which is enor
mously lucrative despite the fact
that it deals in myth."
Labeling people as "addicts,"
according to Newman, is not the
way to go to help them. Instead,
people should be encouraged to
play roles.
"We have this ability to per
form, create, imitate, and there
fore start to break out of social
roles by virtue of our ability to
perform differently," Newman
said. "In families, for example,
you see people acting in social def
initions. I try to help people see
that they can go beyond tradition
al forms of relationships."

Newman's book contains a se
ries of exercises to help people
break out of those "social defini
tions." In one of them, Newman
suggests the reader to exchange
roles with a family member for a
day. In another exercise, Newman
suggests the reader to write a
poem for one whole day every
time a problem comes up.
"Make a conscious decision to
go home, whether by car or walk
ing, in a totally different way,"
Newman said. "For example, if
you usually drive, then take a
walk. This is important because it
introduces into people's lives the
capacity to make a choice, rather
than to follow a pattern doing
something the same way."
This capacity to make choices
is at the heart of what Newman
sees as his major breakthrough.
Newman disagrees with the con
ventional belief in psychology

that development ends around
age 8.
"People are continually acquir
ing culture and transforming who
they are," Newman said. "I be
lieve in a kind of development
that doesn't stop after childhood,
but that can take place during an
entire life."
This disagreement with con
ventional psychology is not the
only problem that Newman has
with it.
"The first principle of tradi
tional psychology, reinforced over
and c r er again in ordinary lan
guage, is that it's necessary to go
"more deeply into" things, to "get
to the bottom," Newman writes in
his book. "This principle is in my
opinion a tremendous barrier to
development because it assumes
that life is static and unchanging
rather than the product of contin
uous human activity."
