## The
						Stanford Weekly Brunch or breakfast? 
### 
DURING THE summer,
Food Service under
goes a number of
changes. The prices of meals
are slightly increased, the
serving hours are changed
and different food is served.
Although many of these
changes are justifiable and
within reasonable grounds,
there is one that is not â€” serv
ing brunch between 9 a.m.
and 10:30 a.m.
For many students, the
weekend means relaxation
and rest. In the school year,
Food Service opens brunch at
about 10 a.m. and closes it at
12:30 p.m. That usually gives
exhausted students a time to
catch up on their sleep and eat
late.
There is no reason for Food
Services to think otherwise
during the summer. Despite
the quasi-relaxed atmosphere
that is prevalent throughout
the campus, students are still
keeping late hours during the
weekdays and want a chance
to sleep in during the week
end. However, in order to

catch the morning brunch,
they must wake up early.
In addition, Food Service
only serves two meals on the
weekends to Stanford stu
dents. If students miss the
morning brunch, they are
forced to wait until dinner,
which begins at 5 p.m. There
is a seven-hour break between
the two meals. During the
academic year, there is only a
five-hour break.
Students have already
begun to complain about the
early brunch. Several stu
dents have approached the
food service manager of Flo
rence Moore, and some have
even put up petitions to
protest the early brunch.
However, Food Service has
done nothing about the issue.
Although students are
given the option of having late
plates, that is not enough.
Brunch should be moved to "a
more reasonable hour," as one
petition puts it.
After all, brunch served
during breakfast hours can
hardly be called brunch.
