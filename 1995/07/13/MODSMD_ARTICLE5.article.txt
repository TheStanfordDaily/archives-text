# Bike racks don't hold
## 
### 
The new inverted-
U bicycle racks the Uni
versity has installed
around campus recently are in
many ways more attractive
and convenient than the older
bike racks. But in some cases,
they have been placed in a
manner that makes them less
convenient.
The racks are designed so
bicycles can be locked to either
side of the rack. But some
racks have been installed very
close to railings or walls. This
makes it difficult to park bikes
in both directions and effec
tively halves the usefulness of
the bike racks.
While it is possible to park
two bicycles facing in the same
direction, it increases the dan
ger that the bikes on the racks
will scratch or otherwise dam

age each other.
Making sure the bike racks'
design can be fully exploited is
especially important because
the new inverted-U racks each
accommodate only four bicy
cles if one bicycle is locked to
each U. Older racks provided
eight slots in the same space.
It might not be worth the
effort to move the bicycle
racks that have already been
installed. But it is definitely
possible to install the racks
more thoughtfully in the fu
ture.
Stanford's new bike racks
are a definite improvement
over the old ones, but in the
future, a little more judicious
ness in installing the racks
could ease campus bicyclists'
lives, if only a little bit, for
years to come.
