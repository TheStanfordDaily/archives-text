## Snail-mail comeback 
### 
I RECENTLY READ an arti
cle about the wonders of the
Internet in which someone
wondered if future generations
would ever learn how to write,
given the growing dependence
upon mouse and keyboard. As
improbable as the statement
sounds, I think it may have al
ready been proven true to some
degree. You know of what I
speak, elaine-best fans and adel
bert junkies. The letter is quick
ly becoming an artifact, and
writing one a lost art form.
I remember childhood sum
mers when I would dash to the
mailbox at the edge of the drive
way, practically assaulting the
mailman just to grab the day's
delivery. I was an expert sorter
— bill, bill, magazine, free cereal
sample, letter! My entire day
could hinge upon the discovery
of a few pages of looseleaf paper
crammed into a small envelope.
My cousin and I corresponded
for several years this way, swap
ping stories of misadventures
and mundane observations and
addressing each other with code
names that impressed us but an
noyed the Postal Service. Now
we have access to e-mail, but we

hardly ever write even though
the message could be delivered
in seconds rather than in weeks.
I'm sure that there are other
reasons for the decline in our
correspondence — I don't think
I could debate over the best pilot
in Robotech for half a page any
more. However, I notice disap
pointedly that I have forgotten
how to write real letters. Not the
stuff of e-mail shots — those
snippets of grammar where half
of the message contains
acronyms and abominable smi
ley faces. I'm talking about the
letter in pure form, where you
can admire a stamp and feel the
texture of stationery, and where
reading doesn't require a
scrolling key.
Maybe writing letters has be
come blase due to the sheer
speed of e-mail or its conve
nience. But, maybe we just don't
want to try. E-mail messages
don't require much foresight or
afterthought. With a few sec
onds and some well-coordinated
keystrokes, it's a done deal.
You've just told your friend
across the country in three lines
that nothing new is going on in
your life. It was so easy, though;

there was none of that vast
empty space that glares at you
from paper.
Beyond the joyful moment of
actually receiving a letter lies
the value of its content. A good
letter is like good conversation;
it is rare and engaging and has
its own rhythm and pacing. The
way that someone scrawls across
a page, scratching out words in
frustration or excitement, loop
ing their letters, then crushing
them together, allows the reader
to see the personality of the
reader. Nick Bantock's im
mensely popular "Griffin and
Sabine" series draws upon this
quality to tell the story of two
strangers and their mystical cor
respondence. As the pair draw
closer, the letters reflect their
giddiness and belie their fears.
Somehow a book of printouts in
Times 12 font just doesn't mea
sure up. In an era awash with
what is virtual, faster and more
complex, I still look forward to
opening a real mailbox, rusted
door and all.

Dave still owes Kristci a letter.
