## Unabomber presents moral quandary for journalism 
### 
The newspaper in
dustry, which is so often
seen as a mighty, princi
pled crusader against the estab
lishment, has been humbled into
indecision by a peculiar demand
by the terrorist called the Un
abomber.
The Unabomber is an un
known serial bomber held re
sponsible for a total of 16 bomb
ings since 1978. The attacks
have killed three people and in
jured 23 more.
Recently, this terrorist raised
a panic and disrupted air travel
and mail service in California
when he threatened to blow up
an airliner. He later dismissed
the threat as a prank.
The Unabomber has offered
to end his deadly ways and "per
manently desist from terrorism"
if, within three months, a major
news organization publishes a
manifesto expounding his anar
chist beliefs. His lengthy type
script was sent to The New York
Times and The Washington Post
(as well as Penthouse magazine).
So far, neither paper has an
nounced a decision on whether it
will publish the document, which

would fill about seven pages of a
newspaper.
I doubt the Unabomber would
be interested in publishing his
manifesto in The Weekly, given
our relatively small circulation
— a hundred times smaller than
either the Times or the Post —
and our concentrated distribu
tion area. Nevertheless, the Un
abomber's case raises important
questions with which all journal
ists and news organizations, in
cluding The Weekly, must grap
ple.
Among the many burdens
borne by the press is an obliga
tion to the truth. Newspapers
must report the facts, all the
facts, in a complete and unbiased
manner. As difficult as that
might be in practice, it is simple
in principle.
If it were that clear, a newspa
per editor could decide without
qualms not to publish the Un
abomber's manifesto. But all
over the world, and especially in
the United States, the media has
grown into a dominant force in
society. Through that growth,
the press has brought on itself
another great responsibility —

an obligation to the public good
and to public safety.
Usually these two goals are
parallel, and reporting the facts
completely increases the public
good. For instance, a newspaper
might run a story exposing a cer
tain hazard to the public. Or a
newspaper may decide not to
print false rumors that could in
cite riots or violence.
But, often, newspapers must
choose to compromise one goal
for the sake of the other. Some
times they must publish the facts
with the knowledge that doing so
may endanger the public. Some
times they must withhold some
facts for the good of the public.
For this reason, newspapers
will sometimes withhold the
names and addresses of victims
or witnesses in crimes — to pro
tect them from repercussions
and to ensure that others aren't
afraid to report crimes in the fu
ture. Sometimes newspapers
make deals with law enforce
ment agencies to withhold de
tails of an investigation until the
proper time so police efforts
aren't hampered by publicity.
But in covering every aspect of

human life — including war, vio
lence, misery and despair —
newspapers sometimes have to
make decisions that might con
tribute to the loss of someone's
livelihood or life, knowing that
the truth will serve the public
good in the long run.
The Unabom case presents
one of these situations, where a
newspaper's adherence to princi
ples might endanger public safe
ty.
"We will act responsibly and
not rashly, knowing that lives
could be at stake," Arthur O.
Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of
the Times, stated on receiving
the Unabomber's tract.
Indeed, if the newspapers de
cide not to publish the Un
abomber's tract, the Unabomber
might strike again, perhaps tak
ing another life. The editors of
the newspapers would be bur
dened by the knowledge that
they might have averted such a
disaster.
But, chances are, it wouldn't
be the first time, or the last, that
an editorial decision by a news
paper caused or prevented a
death. It would merely be the

most publicized.
Alongside its obligations to
the facts and to public safety, the
press has an obligation to its
public to remain independent,
and not to let its decisions fall
into the hands of others — be
they the newspaper's sources, its
government or its advertisers.
Surely a newspaper must not let
its content be determined by an
anarchist bomber.
If a newspaper printed the
Unabomber's tract, it would
send a message that the newspa
per had succumbed to the influ
ence of violence and threats. All
manner of terrorism might befall
the newspaper and the public.
Could a disgruntled writer
take hostages if the newspaper
refused to publish his op-ed
piece? How many hostages would
warrant a full page? If a newspa
per prints the Unabomber's
manifesto, the answers will be
"Yes" and "I'm not sure — we'll
talk." The implications would be
severe for the press and for the
public it serves.
