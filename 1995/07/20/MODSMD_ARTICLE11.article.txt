# Nearly 5,300 — mostly grads partaking in summer school

Who attends Stanford summer school
anyway?
The third week of summer quarter brings
the latest statistics from the Registrar's Of
fice: the official count is 5,279 students.
More than half — 3,252 to be exact — are
continuing their graduate work.
So, what's it like, studying under the
Stanford summer sun?
Susanne Scheele, from Kalamazoo,
Mich., graduated from the University of
Michigan in 1992 and is currently taking an
undergraduate organic chemistry course
while working as a research assistant. Come
fall, it's back to her graduate studies in epi
demiology.
Scheele thinks that summer school is
harder now that she is no longer an under
graduate.
"When I was an undergrad, my parents
wrote the checks and I didn't have to think
about life outside of school. Now I have to
take care of basic life problems that I didn't
have to worry about when I was 19," she
said.
Perhaps like many students, Scheele de
cided that because she works on campus, she
might as well take a class too. Due to the
extra pressures of financial liability, howev
er, she is not enjoying it as much as she
would have liked.
"I really used to love summer school as an
undergrad," Scheele said. "The professors
taught because they wanted to teach, and

tons of students stayed on campus. The at
mosphere at Stanford is different than
Michigan because there are so many youth
and athletic camps. . . . It's really dead here."
It may just be that undergraduates tend
to provide the vigor and excitement at most
schools, while graduate students tend to
have lives of their own, away from school.
If that is the case, the statistics support
the claim: there are only 578 undergraduates
enrolled in summer school classes at Stan
ford.
One of these rare undergraduates is Stan
ford sophomore Andrew Wong, who is using
summer school to further advance his stud
ies in computer science and economics.
"I wanted to get ahead on my major,
which will probably be econ and history,"
Wong said.
Wong is also taking advantage of the
smaller classes summer school offers.
"In my CS class," he said, "there are a lot
of graduate students taking CS to make
themselves look more attractive in the job
market; it's also practical. But in econ class,
there are a lot of high schoolers who are used
to a more interactive learning environment.
During the summer the class is smaller. Dur
ing the year there are about 300 to 400 peo
ple and now there are 30."
Fred Yau, from Hong Kong, will graduate
from Harvard in 1997 and is another one of
the undergraduates studying and living on
campus. Yau is taking intensive Chinese and
will go with his class to Beijing for four weeks
after learning the fundamentals of the lan

guage in the first five.
He likes the class but also thinks that
campus life is quiet.
"The first week was really tough, Yau
said. "You need to know people or you get
stranded on the weekend without a car.
He maintained that there is not as much
pressure during the summer.
"You have a different mentality and don t
expect to work as hard, " he said.
And, of course, there are some alums who
just can't get enough.
Almost 1,200 alumni are back on the
Farm to continue their studies. Those who
are not in graduate school — or rather, those
who are taking time off of work — are enjoy
ing themselves. Haydon Boone, Class of '93,
and Susan Liautaud, Class of 85, are learn
ing Italian for both entertainment and prac
tical purposes.
Boone works for Andersen Consulting
but needed to take some time off from the
grind of the consulting world.
He enrolled in summer school because he
"found that the UC extension program
wasn't as good and the classes were larger. In
addition, I live in Menlo Park so Stanford is
close to home. Plus, I like it here."
Consulting is high-pressure work, with
long weeks and tiny weekends, so Boone feels
"there is not nearly as much stress. When
you take a class because you want to as op
posed to having to, there is a big difference in
attitude."
Similarly, Liautaud is an international
lawyer who lives in Paris and is staying with

her parents in Atherton.
"It's great coming back to Stanford, and
there is no pressure," she said. "I'm not even
sure if I'm getting a grade. I have a job and
three kids; all of that gives you a different
perspective."
Despite Stanford's sometimes distracting
summer sun, classes are in session. And de
spite the fact that fewer students enroll in
the summer, there is life at Stanford. The at -
titudes of people on campus are more casual,
but it seems that many are learning and en
joying the summer just the same.
