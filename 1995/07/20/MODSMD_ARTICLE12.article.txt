# Jocks of a different kind fill Delt house
## Computer campers mix learning, play

Enter the next generation ofdig
iterati, sans generation gap. Al
though these pioneers may barrel
down the Infobahn with the best of
the electric elite, most of them do
not even hold a valid driver's li
cense.
You 've stepped into the comput
er lab of American Computer Ex
perience (ACE), a hastily trans
formed meeting hall in the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity house. On an
other day, it might easily double as
NASA's new computerized Mis
sion Control; one takes in the same
semblance of vaguely chaotic
order, the buzz of many voices
locked in concerted discussion, the
pitter-patter of feet rushing from
task to task.
Industrious, capable, quick —
everything the American public
might expect from the technologi
cally beautiful, were it not for the
fledgling faces of the employees.
Welcome to computer camp.
ACE presents summer camp in
the most campy, summery sense of
the word; the kids, aged 7 to 16,
play capture the flag, go swimming
and sleep over. They look up to
their counselors with adoring idol
atry, and are able to play among
themselves for seemingly inex
haustible lengths of time.
However, there is one major dif
ference between this program and
other programs: programming.
"Our first two objectives are to
keep the campers safe and to have
fun," said ACE Director Jim

Beach. "But our third goal is to
teach them as much as we can
about computers, no matter what
their ability level."
According to the brochure, in
struction from a corps of eight
counselors includes programming
in three languages — BASIC, Pas
cal and C++, an introduction to
navigating the Internet along with
HTML code and a generalized ex
posure to the myriad other uses to
which the microprocessor has been
lent — computer music, image
morphing, fractals and other such
specialties.
"We get all levels, from pure be
ginners, seven years old, to some
incredibly advanced 7-year-olds,"
Beach continued. "Most of them
have computers at home."
Through the cyber-glass
I feel like the new kid on the
block as I pick my way through the
banks of inert computers and their
energetic operators — both are
equally wired. I observe two chil
dren absorbed in completing a
short BASIC program to make a
computer keyboard that can play
scales. Another little knowbot bab
bles away about invisible files and
the relative merits of one program
versus another, apparently non
plussed by the ignorance of the re
porter standing behind him. What
ever their experience level, it is
clear these children learn along an
entirely different curve than most
of us.
When asked whether children
deal better with the material than

adults, Beach noted, "They tend to
learn hands-on, through experi
mentation rather than lectures."
One of the instructors, chem
istry graduate student Norma
Chang, added, "I think kids may do
better because they don't have the
prior expectations adults often
do."
Her point crystallized after I sat
down with 10-year-old Eric
Markow. Eric plans to start his
own programming company soon,
utilizing the knowledge of BASIC
he has acquired this week.
"I just can't do what I need in
Res Edit," he mutters as he logs
onto the Net. Soon we are cruising
through one of the America Online
chat sites, a "kids only" room in a
make-believe clubhouse.
With his face leaning over the
keyboard, he pecks out "Does any
one want to talk? I'm 10 / M."
The code designates his age and
gender. "That's how it's done
here," he explains to me politely.
Two responses appear within
seconds: "Hi, we are both 12 / F.
What is your name?" comes a
query from Missouri, and "Do you
like football?" hails from Dallas.
Before responding to the first,
Eric quickly posts an instant mes
sage to the Texan: "I have another
call, can you wait one minute?" He
then responds to the two girls with
nary a break in stride.
The display was flabbergasting
in its simplicity. I could just see his
little heart rate rising with the
baud rate as he jumped from the
immediate present into the space
less, anonymous world of the Net.
Yet for Eric, hopping on-line for a
spot of 4 o'clock tea and chitchat
seemed to come as naturally as last
week's chance encounter in the
sandbox.
Imagine how a self-possessing,
rational adult would have respond
ed to the experience: "Wait a sec
ond. Can I get carpal tunnel syn
drome from this?"

Beach shrugs: "These kids are
usually self-taught. They're very,
very motivated about learning
computers. It's a hobby for most of
them, and for some, it's their No. 1
interest."
In other cases, it's clearly not.
Take 14-year-old Monica Rov, who
sighed longingly at the mention of
the summer that could have been
someplace else, like tennis camp."I
guess I like [computer camp], but
it's not the greatest thing in the
world. Like going traveling —
that's exciting."
Fun and games?
Monica's concession brings up
another conspicuous issue. The
camp insists on being co-ed, but it
doesn't always look that way. Out
of some 60 children, only a handful
of girls can be counted.
While the boys tended to cluster
aggressively around the most cen
tral machines, the girls worked
quietly and individually away on
the periphery. This may have just
been in the nature of free-time,
which is spent mostly on games.

"Games are more for the guys
— with a lot of fighting and stuff,"
Monica said. Indeed, the boys were
as rowdy in the courtyard adjacent
to the computer lab as the brawlers
locked in mortal combat behind the
screen.
However, Chang acknowledged
her concern about the patterns.
"Part of the reason I'm here is
to combat the underrepresenta
tion of women in math and sci
ences," she said.
She hopes to encourage girls as
both a friend and instructor with
whom they can identify.
At this point, and despite my
best efforts, I was forced to ask:
And what of the nefarious dangers
of "cyberporn"?
"These kids all have the skills to
get it, but they simply don't look
for it," Beach stated flatly. "My ex
perience is they are unaffected by
it."
Let's face it. Cyberporn is prob
ably just not all that exciting to
those who think of kissing as the
equivalent of being attacked by a
slug.

sage to the Texan: "I have another
call, can you wait one minute?" He
then responds to the two girls with
nary a break in stride.
The display was flabbergasting
in its simplicity. I could just see his
little heart rate rising with the
baud rate as he jumped from the
immediate present into the space
less, anonymous world of the Net.
Yet for Eric, hopping on-line for a
spot of 4 o'clock tea and chitchat
seemed to come as naturally as last
week's chance encounter in the
sandbox.
Imagine how a self-possessing,
rational adult would have respond
ed to the experience: "Wait a sec
ond. Can I get carpal tunnel syn
drome from this?"

Beach shrugs: "These kids are
usually self-taught. They're very,
very motivated about learning
computers. It's a hobby for most of
them, and for some, it's their No. 1
interest."
In other cases, it's clearly not.
Take 14-year-old Monica Rov, who
sighed longingly at the mention of
the summer that could have been
someplace else, like tennis camp."I
guess I like [computer camp], but
it's not the greatest thing in the
world. Like going traveling —
that's exciting."
Fun and games?
Monica's concession brings up
another conspicuous issue. The
camp insists on being co-ed, but it
doesn't always look that way. Out
of some 60 children, only a handful
of girls can be counted.
While the boys tended to cluster
aggressively around the most cen
tral machines, the girls worked
quietly and individually away on
the periphery. This may have just
been in the nature of free-time,
which is spent mostly on games.

"Games are more for the guys
— with a lot of fighting and stuff,"
Monica said. Indeed, the boys were
as rowdy in the courtyard adjacent
to the computer lab as the brawlers
locked in mortal combat behind the
screen.
However, Chang acknowledged
her concern about the patterns.
"Part of the reason I'm here is
to combat the underrepresenta
tion of women in math and sci
ences," she said.
She hopes to encourage girls as
both a friend and instructor with
whom they can identify.
At this point, and despite my
best efforts, I was forced to ask:
And what of the nefarious dangers
of "cyberporn"?
"These kids all have the skills to
get it, but they simply don't look
for it," Beach stated flatly. "My ex
perience is they are unaffected by
it."
Let's face it. Cyberporn is prob
ably just not all that exciting to
those who think of kissing as the
equivalent of being attacked by a
slug.
