# Return to Trinity: Memory and prophecy
## Fifty years ago, a burst of light in the New Mexico desert signaled the dawn of the atomic age 
### Stewart Maclennan Contributing writer 
Fifty years ago last Saturday, as the cold predawn sky
over the southern New Mexico desert was tinged with the
first light of day, physicist Edward Teller stood with his
fellow colleagues 20 miles from a makeshift tower which
held the world's first atomic bomb.
In order to protect himself from the explosion, which
he predicted would equal 45,000 tons of TNT — a force
that seemed unachievable to most of the Manhattan Pro
ject scientists, he covered his face with sunscreen, wore
dark glasses, and held a piece of welder's glass to his face
with gloved hands.
At 5:29 a.m. Teller stared right at the tower, and 45
seconds later he saw a faint light appear and separate into
three parts. At first disappointed by the blast of nearly
20,000 tons of TNT, Teller took the blinders off his eyes
and was stunned by the light.
It was as if he had raised the curtains of a darkened
room to a midday sun.
At that moment, in a desert the Spanish conquistadors
called Jornada Del Muerto, or "Journey of The Dead," the
world was ushered into the atomic age.
One year after German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz
Strassman announced they had split an atom of uranium
in 1938, Teller requested $6,000 from the federal govern
ment to begin building the first nuclear reactor. In 1942
the Army appointed J. Robert Oppenheimer to continue
research at the remote desert mesa in Los Alamos, where
famed scientists Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi and Niels
Bohr worked with Teller to design the atomic bomb used
at Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945.
By the end of that year, more than $2 billion had been
spent on the Manhattan Project.
That was 50 years ago. Teller has since become known
as the father of the hydrogen fusion bomb — though he
maintains that he detests that appellation. Today, he can
reflect on the decades of controversy surrounding the
atomic bomb and comment on the role of weapons tech
nology and science education in the future.
"People have considered the atomic bomb a danger,"
Teller said.
"It turns out that the bomb has had a positive and sta
bilizing effect on international relations," he added.
"After the war, it would have been extremely difficult
to stop the Soviet Union, because in peacetime the armies
of the democracies could not have stayed mobilized,"
Teller said. "As it was, with technical means playing a
novel and important role, we could match the Soviet
Union after the war, and initially, we really stopped their
expansion."
Offering a different perspective, Political Science Prof.
David Holloway also commented on the consequences of
dropping the bomb.
"The atomic bomb had a profound impact; the immedi
ate result was to jump-start the Soviet nuclear program.
Stalin was determined to have a bomb of his own, and two
weeks after Hiroshima he ordered a crash program," Hol
loway said.
A young scientist
Now a fellow at the Hoover Institution, 87-year-old Ed
ward Teller left his homeland of Hungary in 1926 and
earned his doctorate in theoretical physics four years
later at the University of Leipzig in Germany. As a young
professor, Teller was characterized as an extremely gre
garious and flamboyant man who reveled in the world of
the mind, often challenging senior physicists at his uni
versity to games of mental chess and beating them sound
ly.
Teller worked in Germany until 1933 when Hitler was
named chancellor. Fearing that the growing anti-Semi
tism would ruin his career, he set sail for the United
States from London in 1934 with his wife, Mici, to take a
full professorship at the George Washington University.
Focusing his efforts on nuclear research for several
years in Washington, D.C., Teller was at home in March
1939 playing Mozart on the piano when he received a call
from his friend Szilard at Columbia University.
Szilard triumphantly announced that he had found the
neutrons which would enable him to harness the energy
of the split atom.
Members of the scientific community quickly realized
that the power of nuclear energy could have disastrous
potential if it fell into the wrong hands. Seeking greater
support from the federal government, Szilard drafted a
leUer to President. Franklin Roosevelt. Szilard. who did
not know how to drive, had Teller take him to Albert Ein
stein's home on Long Island so that the world's most fa
mous scientist could endorse it.
The turning point of Teller's life came when he was in

vited to the Eighth Pan American Scientific Congress in
the spring of 1940. Previously, Teller had not been inter
ested in politics, but when he heard in May that the Nazis
had begun rolling through Holland, Belgium and Luxem
bourg, he decided to use his invitation and go.
Teller listened carefully as President Roosevelt gave
the keynote address: "But I believe that. . . you and I, if in
the long run it be necessary, will act together to protect
and defend by every means at our command, our science,
our culture, our American freedom and our civilization."
Teller sensed that Roosevelt was telling the scientists
that it was their duty to use their abilities to defend Amer
ican values.
"Before I did not know what to do; afterwards I did,"
said Teller. "I made up my mind to go into my work in
every way possible."
Teller's Los Alamos dilemma
At Los Alamos, Teller had been contemplating the pos
sibility of a demonstration of the atomic bomb high over
Tokyo Bay as an alternative to its immediate use on Hi
roshima. On July 4, 1945, Teller received a petition from
his friend Szilard. It was addressed to Roosevelt and
asked him to "rule that the United States shall not, in the
present phase of the war, resort to the use of the atomic
bomb."
Teller was hesitant about circulating the petition
throughout the laboratory without obtaining the permis-

sion of Oppenheimer, the lab direc
tor. After a short conversation,
Teller decided to dismiss the peti
tion.
But Cold War historian Barton
Bernstein contends that Teller
never had any genuine intention to
support anything other than use of
the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
"Dr. Teller often falsely recol
lects his past," said Bernstein, who
added that "the correlation be
tween memoirs and reality is often
similar to the relationship between
the weekend fisherman and the
length of his fish."
Bernstein finds evidence for his
claim in a sentence from a letter
Teller wrote to Szilara after he had
received the petition. In it Teller
stressed that it was important to
get the facts out before the public
and that "for this purpose actual
combat use might even be the best
thing."
Teller offered his side of story.
"I liked Szilard's petition, but
Oppenheimer talked me out of it. I
now think that Oppenheimer was
right when he said that we should
not petition, but it would have
been much better if instead of peti
tioning, we would have worked out
the possibility of a demonstration
and submitted it as a third choice
for the President. That would have
been a part of our job to inform. We
could not expect the President to
know that the bomb could be used
in a demonstration."
Holloway agrees with Teller,
"One of the striking things was
that President Truman was pre
sented with very few options. He
knew nothing of the atomic bomb
until after Roosevelt's death and
inherited the assumption that it
would be used."
When asked whether the Tokyo
demonstration would have been ef
fective, Holloway was skeptical.
"A testing might have caused
the Japanese to surrender, al
though there was the risk that the
bomb might fail," Holloway said.
"The demonstration would not
have brought about a speedy sur
render and would not have
changed the votes in the War Cabi
net," according to Bernstein.
Regardless of whether the
demonstration might have induced
the Japanese to make peace, Hol
loway thinks the option should

have been more thoroughly explored.
"Whether or not the Japanese had surrendered, if
there had been a demonstration, I think that we would all
certainly feel better today," said Holloway.
Teller now feels that he failed in his duty as a scientist.
"Look — a scientist has three jobs. He must find the
facts, develop what he has found, and inform the public,"
he said. "In a democracy, no minority should have a spe
cial voice."
Some weeks after shelving the petition from Szilard,
Teller found out that Oppenheimer had been part of an
advisory panel to the government and had given his advice
in favor of immediate bombing.
"Oppenheimer made the point that as scientists we
should not interfere. That made me feel comfortable, and
I agreed. It was later that I found out that he did not tell
me the whole truth. He did not inform me that he himself
had been asked, and had not acted as a scientist, but as a
politician in favor of immediate bombing. That indeed,
did not leave a positive impression on me."
The controversy over a whether a demonstration
would have succeeded will surely continue, but Teller has
resolved his own doubts. In his book, "The Legacy of Hi
roshima," Teller writes, "It was necessary and right to de
velop the atomic bomb. It was unnecessary and wrong to
bomb Hiroshima without specific warning."
The legacy of FDR

Teller has imagined that a different postwar interna
tional order might have emerged had President Roosevelt
lived a few years longer.
"Ahh,'" Teller began after a long, reflective silence.
"I'm speculating in a way in which I know I shouldn't, but
knowing this, I'll tell you what I've dreamed of.
"Roosevelt, having known about the bomb, having
planned it, might have used it in a more imaginative way.
Whether he would have used the bomb in a demonstra
tion, or whether he would have dropped it, he would not
have done what Truman's administration did. He would
not have demobilized, nor would he have stopped support
of the Soviet Union," Teller said.
In reality, almost a year after the Japanese surren
dered, an attempt to begin international cooperation on
nuclear energy was conceived by Oppenheimer and draft
ed by Dean Acheson and David Lilienthal.
Called the Baruch Plan, the proposal was presented to
the Soviets at the United Nations in 1946 but was
promptly rejected by Stalin.
"The Baruch Plan was proposed too late, and without
any pressure on the Soviets. I would imagine that if Roo
sevelt were alive he would have realized our strength at
the end of the war. We don't demobilize; we have the
atomic bomb, and we tell Stalin that if he doesn't cooper
ate it will be a dangerous situation. We stop off our sup
port and tell him that we are considering our options," he

said.
Teller admitted that he doesn't know exactly how the
United States would have played out this threat, but he
said that it most likely would have had positive conse
quences.
"Roosevelt might have induced cooperation. Then he
would have been able to develop bombs for defense for the
international community."
Holloway agrees with Teller that if FDR had lived, he
most likely would have been more imaginative with the
atomic bomb, but he doubts that the Baruch plan would
have been successful.
"Stalin was determined to have his own bomb," he
said.
Bernstein presented a similar opinion. "The Baruch
plan was well-intentioned but poorly conceived. The Sovi
ets would never have allowed the United States to super
vise their nuclear development."
Future role of weapons technology
"When I wrote my last book, 'Better a Shield Than A
Sword,' I had no idea that the Soviet Union would col
lapse," Teller said. "That collapse makes the success of
technologies in the democracies look much better."
Teller advocates a much stronger U.S. commitment to
maintaining international stability today. "It would be
immensely helpful to cooperate in any mutually benefit-

ing way."
Teller, who was the principal fig
ure behind the Strategic Defense
Initiative of the 1980s, is quick to
say that it is still useful technolo
gy-
"When we first worked on SDI,
it looked like an immensely diffi
cult job because we had to try and
defend against tens of thousands
of missiles," he said. "It's an al
most impossible task. That prob
lem being reduced, we now have
something by which we can de
fend ourselves and our allies —
like the Japanese and the South
Koreans — against some percent
of this threat."
Teller claims the United States
has missed its chance. "Precisely
when it becomes feasible to do
this, our government says, 'The
Cold War is over; no need for de
fense.' It's completely upside
down," Teller said.
According to both Bernstein and
Holloway, the threat of nuclear
weapons is by no means over now
that the Soviet Union has col
lapsed and much of Eastern Eu
rope is experimenting with
democracy.
"We are still threatened by nu
clear weapons," said Bernstein,
who added that "although major
powers will rely less on them,
there is still the danger of an acci
dental or willful use."
"Now we are in a very different
world," Holloway said. "The
analogies that we draw from post-
World War I and World War II
aren't that helpful, and there is a
widespread sense that we're not
exactly sure what kind of period
we're in right now," he said.
Teller offers a solution to what
he considers the current instabil
ity in the international order.
"The United States should be
first in developing new weapons,"
he said. "Let me tell you the alter
native, which is now on the minds
of many people. Wars are caused
by weapons. The very best
weapons are made by the United
States. Therefore, if the United
States would only stop making
weapons, there would be no more
war. How much sense does that
make?"
Teller insists that the United
States is justified in developing
new weapons. "Weapons in the
hands of those who want peace

and who want cooperation can use them in a gradual way
to establish the roots for mutual benefit," he said. "SDI is
an outstanding example, where we can develop it for the
protection of everybody."
In addition, nuclear weapons will continue to play a
role in the future, according to Teller. "As we develop
greater accuracy, the need for a very big bang is decreased.
However, the possibility of using nuclear weapons of a
sub-kiloton size could still be extremely useful," he said.
"In general, the development of these smaller nuclear
weapons must be exploratory," Teller said. He empha
sized the consequences of failing to continue thorough re
search.
"If you don't go into it, then others will find lots of
other things that you don't know and can take you by sur
prise," he said.
Holloway is clearly opposed to further nuclear develop
ment.
"To reduce nuclear weapons is right," he said. "To take
measures against nuclear proliferation is also right."
As much as Holloway favors complete abolition of nu
clear weapons, he said that it would be problematic to see
how it could be done.
"It will be difficult to see if nations which commit to de
stroying their nuclear stockpiles actually do," he added.
The future of science
Even in his old age, Teller remains a very influential
spokesman for the continued improvement of science ed
ucation in the United States. When asked about the cur
rent state of science in this country, Teller sounded very
concerned.
"I'll tell you exactly what is happening — more money
has poured into science, but together with the money is a
lot more politics," he said. Himself the quintessential the
orist, Teller advocates a return to the study of pure sci
ence in the classroom.
"More than $100 billion is being spent on environmen
talism, in a matter mostly wasted, and at the same time,
as fields of this kind become more popular, technology
and science are becoming dehumanized," he said.
"If kids are taught always to work on applied science —
which is becoming more and more applied — they get de
humanized," he said. "Why should they work?"
Teller contends that there is a general feeling of worry
in science today.
"People are worried about radioactive contamination
to a degree entirely out of proportion," he said.
Teller said the demise of science can be illustrated in
the famous words attributed to Oppenheimer as he
watched the gigantic mushroom-shaped cloud rise up into
the sky above the Trinity test site in New Mexico.
"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds," Oppen
heimer supposedly said quoting a Hindu religious text.
"What if he would have said, 'We here have established
remarkable possibilities," Teller suggested. "Now it is up
to our great democracy to decide upon the best possible
use for them.' "
"Instead of playing up to fears, he should have played
up to hopes," he said.
Bernstein said, "There is no evidence that Oppen
heimer actually said those words at Trinity."
He added that in fact, an aide at the site remembers Op
penheimer's mentioning that the bombing was an exam
ple of human achievement.
Nonetheless, what has been the effect of Oppen
heimer's often-quoted words? "There is an aspect of fear
in nuclear weapons, and consequently they are only con
sidered as weapons of mass destruction, " said Teller.
Holloway also suggests that the public's apprehension
of nuclear power is tied to the fear of nuclear weapons.
Teller is adamant that nuclear weapons not be con
fused with killing.
"The remarkable thing is," Teller said, "that these
weapons of mass destruction might have been used without
killing anybody. They were used, however, to kill less than
200,000 people and end a war which killed 50 million."
He pointed out that the deaths in World War II
amounted to 10 percent of the total fighting participants.
"When Genghis Khan fought in Persia and in Hungary,
he killed more than 90 percent of the defeated army," said
Teller.
"The killing has been possible at all times," he empha
sized. "The limit of killing is not to be sought in the
weapons but in the intentions of the people."
As the public reflects on the bombings of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in the coming weeks, Teller asks that we
consider our bias towards nuclear weapons:
"1 would be very much opposed to the continued use of
the term, 'weapons of mass destruction.' All weapons can
be used to destroy. But if we want, all weapons can be used
for better purposes."

A hydrogen bomb is tested at Bikini Atoll. The first atomic bomb, predecessor of this bom LandL and progenitor of the nuclear age, was exploded 50 years ago this week.
