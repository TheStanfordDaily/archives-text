## Brimhall leaves for a new job 
### 
Reed Brimhall, director of Govern
ment Cost and Rate Studies and the in
terim Chief Administrative Officer of
the School of Medicine, has resigned
both posts and accepted a new position
as corporate controller and director of
finance with the Idaho-based Scientech
company.
The Office of Government Cost and
Rate Studies formed in 1991, when the
University was embroiled in controver-

sy over its indirect
cost, policies. It negoti
ates and reports on in
direct costs and staff
benefit rates with the
government, regu
lates rates charged by
University service
centers and maintains
University property
administration and
equipment inventories.

"I've been trying to do the best I can
to act for the dean [of the Medical
School] in administrative and financial
matters," Brimhall said.
Sara Bible will become acting direc
tor of Government Cost and Rate Stud
ies as of Brimhall's Aug. 5 departure.
Bible is currently the assistant director
for indirect costs. Bible stepped up and
took over the office's day-to-day opera
tions in early May when Brimhall start
ed working for the Medical School.
"I came here right when the indirect
cost crisis was beginning to happen"
four years ago, Brimhall said. "It's been
a great adventure, I'll tell you that."
"He's done a tremendous job. . . and
really become an indirect-cost expert
[on a national level]," Bible said of
Brimhall.
Both Brimhall and his wife are native
Idahoans. For them, the move to Scien
tech "is an opportunity to go home." He
said he is looking forward to spending
more time with his five children.
Scientech, Inc. is an engineeringcon
sulting firm involved in nuclear safety
and compliance, environmental con
sulting, computer security and wide
area network information system de
sign — "a small company by Stanford
standards," Brimhall joked.
