# Econ prof Boskin picked to help examine U.S. price index
## 
### 
Michael Boskin, a professor of economics
and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, has recently been selected by the Sen
ate Finance Committee to chair a commis
sion studying possible revisions to the U.S.
Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Boskin, a former chair of the Council of
Economic Advisers, is one of five econo
mists who have been chosen to review CPI
methodology. The commission will examine
whether the index is an effective measure of
cost-of-living increases.
A measure of average changes in prices
paid by consumers for a fixed market basket
of goods and services, the index is used as a
basis for adjustments in government enti
tlement programs and is also often used in
private-sector wage negotiations.
Boskin noted that the issue is really a
"confluence of two events. The first is that
the CPI — the changes in CPI — may be
overstating inflation."
This, in turn, "colors our view of many
important factors of our economy," he said.
"The CPI is used to adjust many data

categories," Boskin added. For example,
housing and food each assume different
index categories. Changes in the index each
year determine inflation rates. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics uses the index and infla
tion rates to calculate government entitle-

ment programs in any
given year.
Furthermore, accord
ing to Economics Prof.
John B. Taylor, the index
now operates with at least
two major biases.
"One concern is that the
CPI currently overstates
inflation," he said.
"It does not take into ac
count improvements in

quality," he remarked. In other words,
some good might improve in quality and be
comes twice as enjoyable to consumers, but
the index would not capture the change, he
said.
Another concern, Taylor pointed out, is
that when "certain goods rise in price, the

consumers will consume less."
The index in its current form assumes
that people will buy the same amount re
gardless of price changes.
Boskin, however, noted that overstating
inflation due to retrospective consumer
purchasing patterns is just one of many is
sues involved with the CPI methodology.
Another is the impact of new products avail
able to consumers.
Boskin said that "in 1989, while on the
Council for Economic Advisers, [he] initi
ated a program to improve the quality of
price measures." He said that Alan
Greenspan, the chair of the Federal Re
serve Board, likewise articulated the im
portance of the index in assessing the na
tional budget and the need to re-evaluate
the index.
The commission, appointed to specifical
ly review current methodology, will make
an interim report Sept. 15 and present its
final recommendations to the Senate Fi
nance Committee by June 15, 1996.
