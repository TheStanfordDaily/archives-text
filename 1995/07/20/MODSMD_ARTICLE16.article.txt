# Signs of hope seen in Wu case
## 
### 
Chinese authorities continue to hold
Hoover fellow and human rights activist
Harry Wu in custody, but new develop
ments over the past week signaled that
U.S.-China relations might be taking a
more positive turn, raising hopes of Wu's
release.
Meanwhile, at home in the United
States, supporters of Wu continued to voice
their demands for Wu's return.
The 58 year-old Wu, who is a U.S. citizen,
has been held by Chinese authorities since
June 19, when Wu was detained at the bor
der between China and Kazakhstan. Au
thorities arrested Wu July 8, accusing him
of sneaking into China under false names,
stealing Chinese secrets and disseminating
them outside China. The accusations ap
parently refer to Wu's activities document
ing conditions in the "laogai," the Chinese
labor camps where Wu spent 19 years as a
political prisoner.
A few recent developments are improv
ing the outlook for the future of U.S.-China
relations and the possibility of Wu's return.
Two Chinese officials hinted to The New
York Times that Wu might be released after
Chinese authorities complete a pretrial in
vestigation period, The Times reported July
13.
In addition, the U.S. and Chinese gov

ernments have agreed on an Aug. 1 meeting
between U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen in Brunei; the two high-level
officers will attempt to resolve some of the
conflict between the two nations.

In what might have
been another positive ges
ture, the Chinese govern
ment last weekend re
leased a prominent Shang
hai dissident, Yang Zhou,
apparently for medical rea
sons.
But there has been lit
tle progress in U.S. offi
cials' efforts to arrange
more frequent contact

with Wu, who is being held in a pretrial de
tention facility in Wuhan, central China.
Consular agreements between the United
States and China require only that China
grant access to Wu every 30 days, but the
State Department has requested more fre
quent access.
A U.S. official traveling in Wuhan on
other business attempted to visit Wu earli
er this week but was not allowed access, ac
cording to State Department spokeswoman
Nyda Budig. However, Budig said, the offi
cial was allowed to leave a power of attorney

form and reading material to be delivered to
Wu.
"We will continue to press for other vis
its," Budig added.
Meanwhile, Wu's supporters in the Unit
ed States continue to press for his release.
Wu's wife, Ching-Lee Wu, made a trip to
Washington last week, urging strong U.S.
action in discussions with high-level U.S.
leaders including House Speaker Newt Gin
grich, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,
Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and Na
tional Security Adviser Anthony Lake.
Ching-Lee Wu returned over the week
end and appeared in San Francisco to
protest a visit there by the mayor of Shang
hai. She left Monday on a trip to meet with
leaders in Europe.
U.S.-China relations have been in tur
moil since early June, when the United
States granted a visa allowing Taiwan's
president, Lee Teng-hui, to attend a re
union at Cornell University. Lee's visit
ended a 16-year ban on Taiwanese leaders
visiting the United States.
The move affronted the Chinese govern
ment, even though the United States
stressed that granting Lee's visa did not
change its policy of recognizing China's do
minion over Taiwan.
