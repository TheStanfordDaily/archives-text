## Annotations on the Internet Report details expanded communication capabilities 
### 
As battle for control over the Internet rages on in
Washington, D.C., three Stanford computer scientists
have presented a new data structure that increases the
possibilities of sharing information on-line.
A technical report published by doctoral student
Martin Roscheisen, master's student Christian Mo
gensen and Computer Science Prof. Terry Winograd
describes a method called "Com Mentor" for users to
exchange annotations and reviews about documents
on the Internet.
The report is part of a larger initiative called the
Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project (SIDL), a
four-year project set to begin in October. The goal of
the project is to create a "universal" library including
everything from personal information collections to
databases shared by scientists and scholars.
The paper is titled "A Platform for Third-Party
Value-Added Information Providers: Architecture,
Protocols, and Usage Examples" — but it is more than
a mouthful of jargon. Three interesting prospects for
Com Mentor, according to senior research scientist An
dreas Paepcke, are annotations, guided tours and rat
ings.
Annotations allow third-party information to be ac
cessed independent of the publisher. This allows arbi
trary reviews and comments by others to appear si
multaneously with a World Wide Web document. Ex
amples of annotations include reviews of a product
along with the advertisement or comments by scholars
on important documents.
"A professor could annotate a document with clari
fications," said Paepcke.
The Web is an extension of the Internet which al
lows users to publish text, graphics and other materi
al on-line.
Guided tours provide a means for users to create
their own links between Web documents. Links are
used currently by publishers to grant easy access to

other Web pages. A guided tour allows the user to cre
ate a personal link to other related documents.
As an example, Paepcke noted, "Martin has created
a guided tour of impressionist art by linking annota
tions from the outside," independent of the publisher.
In terms of censorship capability, ratings provide a
more personal solution to the current debate. Docu
ments on the Internet can be rated by independent
third parties. The rating precedes the document as
"meta-information." Users can set their Web browsers
to only view certain rating classifications.
Instead of a single all-encompassing ratings sys
tem, "voluntary ratings would be adopted," said
Roscheisen.
Ratings would be determined by many different
companies while parents configure their Web
browsers to their chosen rating company. Pornogra
phy can be rated on one hand by Playboy and on the
other by antiporn activists.
"The parents can choose whatever perspective they
want," said Roscheisen.
The solution would then be for companies to rate
the documents and for users to configure their on-line
browsers.
"The problem is [that] ratings are very subjective,"
Paepcke said. Parents can lock out documents with
certain ratings to prevent their children from viewing
those pages. Programs like Net Nanny and Surf Watch
provide a mechanism for blocking certain information;
those programs can be adapted to use the ratings pro
vided by Com Mentor.
Other possibilities with the new data structure, ac
cording to the technical report abstract, include
"structured discussion about paper drafts, collabora
tive filtering, seals of approval, tours, shared 'hot lists'
with section-based visibility control, usage indicators,
co-presence and value-added trails."
