# Steam repairs pack Plaza with fencing
## 
### 
People passing through
White Plaza may find them
selves impeded by hundreds of
feet of fencing blocking the front
of the Old Union building.
The fencing is part of the sec
ond phase of the White Plaza
Steam and Condensation Re
placement project, the first
phase of which was completed
last summer.
The University is replacing a
system of pipes that return the
steam condensate to the Univer
sity's central steam plant. Ac
cording to Project Manager Lew
Lane, steam line replacement

was necessary because the pipes
were corroded beyond repair.
"These pipes have reached
the end of their useful life," he
said.
Lane estimated that "por
tions of the area will be returned
to public use soon" and that
most of the work will be finished
by mid-September. He added,
however, that some of the work
might extend into fall quarter.
The construction is located at
the center of activity on campus,
but Lane said it is causing "no
significant inconvenience."
