# Language head will be revealed
## New administrator will oversee instruction, programs 
### 
In the culmination of an exhaustive search
process, Senior Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Etchemendy plans to introduce a new di
rector for the University Language Center at the end
of this week, pending that individual's formal accep
tance.
Nine fmalists for the position were selected last
March, but a decision was not made until late in
June.
"The University has made a formal offer to a top
rate scholar in second-language acquisition," said
Ralph Hester, chair of the French and Literature De
partment.
Part of the delay was due to the fact that the posi
tion was new, and therefore relatively uncertain, re
marked French and Italian Prof. John Schnapp.
"Senior positions require more delicacy," he said.
"It's something of a lifetime commitment."
The director's duties will include overseeing for
eign language instruction, coordinating research and
training projects and developing interdisciplinary

ties between departments in languages, linguistics
and cultural studies.
The language departments have weathered rough
waters over the last several years. In the 1993-94
academic year, the combined departments lost four
faculty positions, the only ones to be cut from hu
manities departments.
Shortly after, recommendations from the Com
mission on Undergraduate Education began to roll
in, each spawning its own set of controversies.
The most significant of these has been the consol
idation of the disparate departments into a single Di
vision of Literature, Language and Culture.
Last academic year was the pilot year for the pro
gram, which struggled to retain the autonomy and
distinctiveness of the individual departments while
organizing them under a useful administrative and
research-oriented umbrella.
The changes elicited numerous concerns from the
faculty, but won generally favorable reviews.
