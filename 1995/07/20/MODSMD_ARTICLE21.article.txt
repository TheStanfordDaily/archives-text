## Tennis loses for first time this season Scott Humphries turns pro, follows Stanford men's tennis tradition 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
Some say he could have begun his profes
sional career without ever playing a point in
an NCAA dual match; at the age of 18, he was
that good. Instead, he joined the Stanford
men's tennis team in the fall of 1994 and, in
his freshman year, helped head the Cardinal
to a 27-0 record and an NCAA National
Championship.
Now, Scott Humphries has completed the
final chapter of his short but illustrious
Stanford career. Just weeks after signing the
Honor Code on his CIV final-exam bluebook,
Humphries has signed on the dotted line of
an agent's pro contract.
"I thought it was best for my tennis, and I
felt it was the best thing for me to do,"
Humphries said. "I look forward to playing
pro tennis. It's something I always wanted to
do."
Cardinal head coach Dick Gould reacted

to Humphries' decision with a better-to
have-loved-and-to-have-lost-than-to-never-
have-loved-at-all attitude.
"We wish Scott our best," Gould said. "He
was an integral part of the team. His game
picked up dramatically at the end of the year.
We will miss him, because he was our No. 2
singles player and also because he was a
great doubles player, as evidenced by his
final ranking of No. 3 (along with partner
Paul Goldstein).
"We will also miss him because he was a
great person. We felt very fortunate that he
was here for a year, but Scott apparently saw
an opportunity he felt he could not pass up.
We will follow his progress with great inter
est, just as we have with past Stanford play
ers who turned pro." •
Although Humphries had played several
pro tournaments while still enrolled at Stan
ford, he debuted as a full-fledged profession
al on July 10 at the Miller Lite Hall of Fame
Championships in Newport, R.I. There, he

lost his first round match to Germany's
Joern Rezenbrink, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4).
Humphries' next ATP Tour match came last
Tuesday at the Legg Mason Classic in Mary
land, where he was beaten by former Card.-
nal All-American Jonathan Stark, 6-1, 6-3.
The 19-year-old from Alamo, Calif., ar
rived at Stanford with impressive creden
tials, including a Wimbledon Boys' Singles
Championship. He did not disappoint the
Cardinal faithful, racking up a slew of dou
bles championships with fellow freshman
Goldstein and taking the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Singles Title, defeating eventual NCAA
singles finalists Sargis Sargsian of Arizona
State and Brett Hansen of USC along the
way. Humphries was also named NCAA
Rookie of the Year and finished with a No. 7
ranking nationally in singles.
Incoming freshman Ryan Wolters (who
like Humphries was a U.S. National Team
Member and a graduate of Palmer Tennis
Academy) will compete with sophomores

Misha Palacek and Charles Hoeveler to fill
the void in the lineup caused by Humphries'
departure.
