# Tongue firmly in cheek, a rating of sports anchors
## 
### 
I'm amazed if anyone actually reads my
columns. In fact, I'm actually amazed if
anyone pays attention to me.
So I guess it's fortunate I want to get into
television. That way I'll know that people pay
attention to me because they'll be the ones call
ing into the station trying to get my ugly face
off of the air.
Either that, or they will remember me as
the person who drank beer on camera. I guess
that'll be my legacy from this summer; the
time I went to the beer festival and filmed my
self drinking a fine lager.
And yes, I'm still hung over.
As with any television anchors, sportscast
ers have on-air personalities which either en
dear them to their viewers or annoy the hell
out of them. I've watched too much TV sports,
I've formed my own opinions, and since I have
a column, I'll air my opinions. Maybe you'll
agree with some of them; maybe you won't.
Have fun critiquing them.
I know I did.
ESPN, the Total Sports Network™, has the
largest stable of sportscasters, all with their
own personalities.
For example, Keith Olberman used to be
known as the mustached sarcastic guy on
ESPN, but he changed and is now known as
the non-mustached sarcastic guy on ESPN.

His tag-team partner, Dan Patrick, also has
his own distinct personality. He's the straight
man in the team, the quiet guy in high school
that no one ever picked on because he was
never noticed, the Beavis to Olberman's Butt
head (which they actually did for one of their

"Plays of the Week").
"Did You Know?" Chris
Berman is now known as the
heavy-set guy who spews out
the bad nicknames, and one
of my favorites, Charley
Steiner, is the really heavy
set guy with the beard who is
very personable and friendly.
He's kind of the guy who
you'd want to have as a
friend. I'll eternally respect

him for his on-air five minutes of straight
laughter after watching and listening to Carl
Lewis butcher the Star Spangled Banner.
My dog sings better than Lewis.
Robin Roberts is the no-nonsense (we're
talking ESPN here, so she's not that no-non
sense) woman who really knows her stuff.
The rest of the ESPN staff is basically inter
changeable, although Craig Kilborn is turning
into the new version of Van Earl Wright (or
whatever his name is). For those youngsters,
Wright was the original grating voice, the guy

who made dogs howl and made you wish he
would shut up. With his breathy intonations,
Kilborn actually makes me yearn for the punk
ish nasal drone of Peter Gammons, the guy
people love to ridicule.
At CNN's Sports Tonight, Nick Charles is
guy at the barroom who thinks he knows
everything and isn't afraid to say so. A friend of
mine, John, thinks the other guy, Charles'
partner, is pretty good, but I can't remember
his name. He is better than Charles, but then
again, who isn't?
Actually, locally, there is someone that Nick
Charles is better than.
Dan Fouts.
No one, I mean no one, is worse at sports
casting than Dan Fouts. He looks as comfort
able live on camera as Nancy Kerrigan; how
ever, Kerrigan might even have a better deliv
ery than Fouts based on her painful Saturday
Night Live performance. I wonder what would
happen if KPIX Channel 5 ever sends Fouts
live on location.
Thankfully, KPIX has a better sportscast
er. No, I'm not talking about that old guy who
looks like he retired 10 years ago; I'm referring
to Rick Quan. He may be known as The Asian
Guy, but I guess that's better than being called
the "Pirates Guy" as I have been before.
Channel 7 and Channel 2, ABC and Fox re

spectively, has no one that stands out. Maybe
they're good, maybe they're not. If KTVTJ is
forced to hire the dregs from KPIX, then there
might be something wrong with their sports
department.
I've only seen one guy from KGO Channel
7, and I have no clue what his name is. He
seems personable, though.
And that leaves me with Channel 4, KRON,
and as Eric often says, the best for last.
Uh, I was being facetious.
Gary Radnich, someone told .me, wears
shorts when he anchors the sports. According
to urban folklore, it has been said that he once
wore spandex.
Thankfully, they only film from the waist
up.
Radnich looks as if he has a perpetual sneer
and his voice is grating.
However, I do give him credit for being
more comfortable on the air than Dan Fouts,
and he is well-known.
The other guy is okay, but like some others,
I can't remember his name, and that's not a
good sign.
That's it for me; my buzz is wearing off. I
guess I've angered enough people for today.

Emery would like to thank that one person who
actually had the guts to say she's a fan of his.
