## BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF SOUND Playing with digital music at Stanford 
### Melissa Hung

and Acoustics (CCRMA). Melody and tra

allows CCRMA to be open 24 hours a day,

sources of the aforementioned unclassifi

able genres.
A part -— or perhaps the eccentric
cousin — of the Music Department,
CCRMA began as a vision of its current di
rector, Music Prof John Chowning. In the
early '70s, Chowning developed and
patented an easy and relatively inexpen
sive technology for synthesizing sound.
Yamaha purchased the patent < the second
highest paying patent in Stanford histo-
and Chowning's discoveries gave birth
to the first generation of mass-produced
synthesizers. CCRMA evolved unexpect
edly under Chowning as the number of
people interested in computer music grew.
Now, registered Stanford students and
visiting scholars spend the school year at
tending classes and seminars and doing re
search at CCRMA. An undergraduate
major, Music, Science and Technology,
willfully bridges the techie-fuzzy gap and
focuses on "the musical ramifications of
rapidly evolving computer technology and
digital audio" and"the acoustic and psy
choacoustic foundations of music."
At the graduate levels students can get
degrees in their major fields of study while
focusing on various nuances of computer
music, or they receive a D.M.A. in compo
sition or a doctorate in Computer-Based
Music Theory and Acoustics. Multidisei
plinary in nature, computer music draws
researchers from such diverse depart
ments as engineering, physics, computer
science, psychology and music (including
performance, analysis and composition),
Researchers' interests range from physi
cal modeling of musical instruments and
reverberating environments to investiga-
.probl«syis of haiman control of com
puters and sound synthesis algorithms to
sound perceptions and its applications.

The Knoll between June 26 and July 8, you
may have ventured into a maze of audio
territory being explored by blindfolded
CCRMA workshop participants. They
were delving into the uncharted territory
of virtual reality for the ears — in essence,
experiencing how the manipulation of
one's sense of hearing can create the im
pression of an object's presence. Titled
"Introduction to Psychoacoustics and Psy
chophysics: Audio and Haptic Compo
nents of Virtual Reality Design," this
workshop, just one of five, showcases just
some of CCRMA 5 s innovative material.
Other workshops delve into subjects like
algorithmic composition and music score
printing software.
As during the school year, these work
shops (which continue through Aug. 4)
draw composers from all over the world
Visiting scholars from around the globe
allow for a meshing of Western and non-
Western musical culture; tango melodies,
motifs and rhythms may become unlikely
partners to computer musical language.
Another source of creativity stems from
CCRMA's location. CCRMA's proximity to
the technology mecca of Silicon Valley has
Stimulated a mutually beneficial exchange
of ideas.
CCRMA's innovations in computer
music, however, remain noncommercial.
Much of the software and tools currently
being developed and used at CCRMA will
appear on the market as "cutting-edge"
technology two or three years from now.

"Techhology-oriented composers will
take any piece of gear and convert it into
an instrument," Igoudin noted. The elec
tric guitar was the first electro-acoustic in
strument made expressly for creative pur
poses.
In the '70s and '80s, the computer pro
vided artists with a way to choreograph
noises beyond what other electric acoustic
instruments had allowed them to do, Since
ttee computer deals directly with frequen
cies rather than notes, a composer, by
adding one hertz at a time, can slide grad
ually between t he frequencies that corre
spond to certain pitches — somethingthat
is physically impossible to do with tradi
tional musical instruments.
The advent of Musical Instrument Dig
ital Interface (MIDI) in the early '80s al
lowed interaction between electronic mu
sical instruments. At its most basic, MIDI
can tell an instrument when to begin and
end playing a specific note. More advanced
capabilities include controlling modula
tion devices, master volume, sound and
the receipt of information. It can also be
used to indicate the metric position within
a composition. Computers are now effec
tively linked to instruments through
MIDI, allowing a more accessible way to
edit, store and experiment with sounds.
Even though computers have saturat
ed today's society, little of the computer
music produced on CCRMA grounds
makes it beyond the academic realm.
Igoudin said this is due to the high cost of
tools in early production stages and the
public's lack of familiarity with the musi
cal concepts CCRMA experiments with.
Although initially banished to aeade
mia, noncommercial music concepts are
often adopted by more commercial outfits
over time. In the '70s. groups like Emer
son, Lake and Palmer and Pink Floyd ex

'80s it was new wave and new age. Today >
obscure computer music continues to live
somewhat vicariously in the more main
stream electro-acoustic pop and ambient
music that have also spawned from it. For
purely technical reasons, motion-picture
soundtracks also often consist of pure elec
tro-acoustic computer music.

As CCRMA continues
contributing to the music in
dustry from the sidelines and
reshaping the music world, a
burgeoning collection of eclec
tic computer music is being as

CCRMA began as a vision of its current di

early '70s, Chowning developed and
patented an easy and relatively inexpen
sive technology for synthesizing sound.
Yamaha purchased the patent < the second
highest paying patent in Stanford histo-
and Chowning's discoveries gave birth
to the first generation of mass-produced
synthesizers. CCRMA evolved unexpect
edly under Chowning as the number of
people interested in computer music grew.
Now, registered Stanford students and
visiting scholars spend the school year at

focuses on "the musical ramifications of
rapidly evolving computer technology and

At the graduate levels students can get
degrees in their major fields of study while
focusing on various nuances of computer
music, or they receive a D.M.A. in compo

Music Theory and Acoustics. Multidisei

researchers from such diverse depart

science, psychology and music (including
performance, analysis and composition),

"Techhology-oriented composers will

In the '70s and '80s, the computer pro
vided artists with a way to choreograph
noises beyond what other electric acoustic
instruments had allowed them to do, Since
ttee computer deals directly with frequen
cies rather than notes, a composer, by
adding one hertz at a time, can slide grad

is physically impossible to do with tradi
tional musical instruments.
The advent of Musical Instrument Dig

can tell an instrument when to begin and
end playing a specific note. More advanced
capabilities include controlling modula
tion devices, master volume, sound and
the receipt of information. It can also be
used to indicate the metric position within
a composition. Computers are now effec
tively linked to instruments through
MIDI, allowing a more accessible way to
edit, store and experiment with sounds.
Even though computers have saturat
ed today's society, little of the computer
music produced on CCRMA grounds
makes it beyond the academic realm.
Igoudin said this is due to the high cost of
tools in early production stages and the
public's lack of familiarity with the musi
cal concepts CCRMA experiments with.

often adopted by more commercial outfits

somewhat vicariously in the more main

purely technical reasons, motion-picture
soundtracks also often consist of pure elec

"music production" are continually chal

and Acoustics (CCRMA). Melody and tra

offer sounds beyond the range physically
passible for humans playing traditional in
struments. Programmers invent cutting

lation easier, simultaneously expanding
musical boundaries.
