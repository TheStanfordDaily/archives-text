Neil Young
Mirror Ball

The term "grunge" is a slippery
and overhyped word, first used by
critics and MTV to describe Nir
vana's hugely popular "Nevermind"
album, and shortly afterwards, Pearl
Jam's debut, "Ten." The word spread al
most as quickly as Nirvana itself and soon
defined the entire city of Seattle and any
one who happened to wear flannel.
But what, musically, is grunge? And
what does Pearl Jam have to do with it, be
sides Eddie Vedder's flannel shirts and
stage dives? Songs like Nirvana's "School"
typify the genre: a simple tune, clouded by
distortion and grating vocals. This defini
tion could just as easily fit Neil Young.
Young reappeared as a giant on the pop
ular music scene with his 1989 album
"Freedom" and hasn't retreated since, im
mersing himself in modern youth culture
with songs like "Rockin' in the Free
World" (which he played twice at the re
cent Pearl Jam show to satisfy the idiot
contingent of the Pearl Jam fan base who
recognize only what they hear on their
loudspeaker of rock gospel, KOME) and
the album "Sleeps with Angels," his trib
ute to Nirvana's Kurt Cobain.
You might not expect Pearl Jam's style
to mesh well with Neil Young's. "Mirror
Ball," their recent collaboration, proves
that an old war horse can keep up with kids
half his age. Pearl Jam's sound is less
grunge than groove. Their driving rhythm
section deftly pushes and retreats the
music behind Vedder's soulful wailing.
Upon first listen, one can easily miss
Pearl Jam's contribution. The album opens
with "Song X", a Neil-style sea shanty with
guitars crashing behind the "hey ho, away
we go, we're on the road to nowhere" cho
rus. The song screeches to a halt, ending
with wailing feedback and doomsday lyrics:
"The priest was there with sandy hair reli
gion by his side / He saw his law was broken
/ The punishment was applied."

Obviously, Young hasn't yet settled into
middle age, as have virtually all his peers.
He tells us as much in the "Ocean": "people
my age they don't do the things I do / They
go some place while I run away with you."
He is a warrior, and a crafty one. The song
"Downtown," with its title alone, echoes a
theme dating back '20 years to Tonight's
the Night's "Come on Baby, Let's Go
Downtown." In this song, Young is at his
garage / folk / trash best, using the time
less format that he has refined for the past
25 years with his band Crazy Horse.
Eventually, the Pearl Jam groove
makes itself heard. The sound is tighter
than one expects from Young, and al
though it is as noisy as the best stuff from
"Ragged Glory" or "Rust Never Sleeps," it
moves forward in a more orderly fashion.
On "Peace and Love," the pace builds
and builds before exploding with Vedder's
only appearance on the album. And there
isn't the classic Young opus; one antici
pates the grander, slower "Truth be
Known" to extend to 10 minutes, but it
ends crisply after only four.
For all its precision, Mirror Ball sounds
like Neil Young. Pearl Jam fans who fell
asleep at the Golden Gate Park show be
cause they couldn't figure out how to mosh
to "Down by the River" will be very disap
pointed. This album does prove how tal
ented Pearl Jam's Gossard, Ament, Mc-
Cready and new drummer Jack Irons are,
as they manage to add a new element to a
legend's trademark style.
As for Young, he just keeps on going.
Mirror Bail is the sixth album he has made
since 1989, and completes what is a re
markable half-decade of music. The "fa
ther of grunge" has made more good music
in the '90s than anyone else, even if one ig
nores the 20 years of work he had under
his belt before he tackled this decade.
Young remains above any hype and pub
licity thrown at him, and will surely out
live many more MTV-generated trends.
Pearl Jam would do well to last half as long
as Young, and with luck they've learned
some lessons from their collaboration with
rock's past and current king.

Fugazi
Red Medicine

Now that alternative rock's
punk revolution has basically
amounted to quicker grunge, punk
music threatens to become a watered-down
parody of itself, glorifying, as Guy Picciotto
sings, "a thousand grudgingyoung million
aires." With their fifth album, "Red Medi
cine," D.C. punk vets Fugazi offer some re
newed hope for the genre, both through
their mastery of the hard-core basics and
their refusal to stick to them.
On tracks like "Bed for the Scraping"
and "Downed City," Fugazi continues to
develop their own brand of melodic punk
with all the satisfying severity and musical
maturity that made 1990's "Repeater" a
classic. Still, other songs demonstrate the
complexity, flexibility and imagination
that make "punk" a limited and mislead
ing label for the band's multifaceted
sound.
"Combination Lock" and "Version," two
instrumental tracks, best illustrate the
group's precise and purposeful musician-

Foo Fighters
Foo Fighters

Like Courtney Love a year ago, former
Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl now
faces the considerable task of leading
his own band out from the shadow of Kurt
Cobain's tragedy. As the first official Nir
vana spinoff, Grohl's Foo Fighters have to
contend with legions of fans that are expect
ing another Nirvana to pick up where the
last one left off.
While the Nirvana factor will surely boost
the sales of the Foo Fighters' self-titled
debut, it will also shift the focus away from
Grohl's own distinct style and approach,
which are the real strengths of this record.
Grohl shows a more mild-mannered side
of the loud punk-pop sound perfected by his
former band. His vocals are pleasant and al
most downright chipper at times, and his
lyrics are comfortably vague. What the
group lacks inartistic intercity they make
up with casual personality and charm.
It makes sense, then, that the album's
weakest moments are also its most Cobain
like. Grohl's repeated yells of "Hate it" (in
"Good Grief) and"I don't owe you any
thing" (in "I'll Stick Around") sound out of
place and unnatural, like generic chunks of
angst inserted just to keep the mosh pits
happy.
The Foo Fighters are at their best when
they can find pleasure in being plain, building
up a loud calm rather than a bitter frenzy.
With its drifty vocals and heavy sway,
"Floaty" has a definite floaty element to it,

ship, adding an almost classical beauty to
the record's stream of sophisticated hard
rock.
With its tensely sedate verses and al
most Stipelike chorus, "Fell, Destroyed" is
one of the album's more ear-catching
tracks, balancing Fugazi's trademark in
tensity with their increasing pop fluency.
"Do You Like Me" and "Target" offer simi
lar glimpses of the band's more radio
friendly side, while still remaining jagged,
inventive and fierce.
Fugazi's sound has always been rooted
in heavy, medium-paced punk, but "Red
Medicine" finds it branching in new and
different directions, even more so than on
previous records. So while this may be the
band's poppiest album to date, it may also
be their most challenging, as its continuous
blending, bending and shifting of genres
demand that the listener keep pace.
"Red Medicine" ends fittingly with
"Long Distance Runner," a deliberate,
evolving anthem about not staying in one
place. "It all boils down to not hanging
around, to keep moving in front of the grav
ity," sings lan MacKaye, fighting the fight
against stagnation and emerging success
ful.

but it remains anchored in solid guitar rock.
The lightweight pop of "Big Me" is similarly
refreshing, and "Oh, George" casts a peace
fully longing mood reminiscent of Dinosaur
Jr.'s "Where You Been" album.
Harder rockers like "Wattershed" and
"Good Grief' are still emotionally mellow,
though they're spiced with the tightly ur
gent musicianship of Grohl, who reportedly
played all of the instruments on the album
except for a single guitar part.
The spitfire drumwonk of "This Is A
Call," for instance, lets you overlook how
much the song sounds like a grungy Beach
Boys tune, transforming a would-be snoozer
into a fully enjoyable rock track.
It still might be a while before people can
say the name Dave Grohl without thinking
about the name Kurt Cobain, but until then,
the Foo Fighters have put forth a good, solid
rock album that fortunately doesn't smell all
that much like teen spirit.
