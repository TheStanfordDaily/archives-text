Nine Months

Hollywood spoils everything. It
takes a screenplay's potential
for subtle wit, churns it
through its predictability machine,

and spits out a formula that aims to satisfy
the basic desire of most American film view
ers: a happy, sappy ending.
"Nine Months" views like a dime-store
novel reads. Samuel (Hugh Grant) and Re
becca (Julianne Moore), a picture-perfect
unmarried couple, encounter a life-altering
conflict — Rebecca's pregnancy, deal with it
and the ensuing problems in an unerringly
typical fashion and live happily ever after.
Same old story. Been there. Seen that.
Could have wasted seven bucks in more in
teresting ways (Look at Grant — he isn't
shy about showing how to get more bang for
your buck).
Ironically enough, the movie's biggest
attraction is also its biggest failure. As
Samuel, the self-centered materialistic psy
chiatrist, Grant lacks the charm and off
hand wit which his performance in Mike
Newell's "Four Weddings and a Funeral"
would make us expect.
Samuel's narcissism — annoying as it
may be — is not what makes Grant's per
formance so disappointing. Flaws often cre
ate the depth and complexity that make

characters memorable, but Samuel's faults
are boyishly simple. Whether he whines
about trading in his Porsche or about not
getting sex, he makes it difficult if not im
possible to empathize with his selfish anxi
eties.
Like all flawed heroes, Samuel arrives at
an understanding of his loathsome wrongs
too late. The tearful moment of truth when
an ultrasound image of his son overwhelms
him is one of the film's few possible saving
points. Silence, in this case, is far more ef
fective than the rarely believable dialogue.
Although the moment lends sincerity to his

turnaround, his post-catharsis perfor
mance lacks the polish of a true gentleman.
Although Julianne Moore plays a strong
Rebecca, the character herself is less likable
than Moore's performance. Sharing souls
while perusing the aisles of a toy store is one
of the examples where Moore makes a poor
ly written script tolerable. She can do noth
ing, however, for the terribly gaudy silk
teddy lip-sync to Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get
It On."
Most of the film's best lines and funniest
faces belong to supporting actress Joan Cu
sack, who plays Gail Dweyer, a quirky

mother of three brats who is unluckily but
happily married to loudmouth family man
Marty, played by Tom Arnold.
Cusack's clumsy mannerisms and shame
lessly corny comments demonstrate an ef
fortless talent that outshines all other per
formances, including Robin Williams'. His
cameo appearance is amusing but not as hi
larious as the preview would make you ex
pect. Though Williams' humor is usually
brilliantly spontaneous, his scenes rely too
heavily on those funny malapropisms that
might be funnier if they were less numerous.
Much to my bewilderment, "Nine
Months" is cleaning house at box offices.
My guess is that its undeserved success
owes itself more to Grant's sensationalized
jaunt on Sunset Boulevard than to any
qualities of the film itself.
If you've seen the previews, you've seen
it all. Wasting your time on bad movies
certainly isn't

the worst form
of summer en
tertainment.
But you can
pay less to see
more of them if
you go to
Blockbuster in
stead.
