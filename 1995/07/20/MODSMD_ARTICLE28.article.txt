### Shana Yansen 
The Summer Executive Institute on
Women and Leadership began last week,
bringing 25 upper-middle and senior man
agement women to Stanford from all across
the country to attend an eight-day session
focusing on leadership issues.
Sponsored by the Institute for Research
on Women and Gender, the course, now in
its second year, is "designed to foster new
paradigms in leadership education" and
aims to encourage a "creative, integrative
learning environment that enables partici
pants to discover their own authentic lead
ership," said Sherri Matteo, executive direc
tor of the summer institute.
Currently, women account for less than
10 percent of senior management positions
in American corporations, and according to
Matteo, only 30 percent of all business
school graduates last year in the United
States were women.
Attending the institute this session are
women executives from such companies as
Sega and Acuvue, executives from financial
firms, entrepreneurs and even a school prin
cipal.
Michaelene Risley, vice president and
general manager of Sega Corporation, com

mented that she came to the conference be
cause she "has been interested in gender is
sues for a long time . . . and would like to
make the most of being a woman."
Risley added that less than 10 percent of
senior management in her corporation are
women.
Similarly, Ellen Preston, national sales
manager for Acuvue and one of few women
on her level of management, commented
that "differences often have more to do with
age than gender."
She reflected that older generations of
management have very different life experi
ences and expectations in the workplace.
Examining these issues is something she
hopes to do in the course.
Likewise, Elease Wright of Aetna Life
and Casualty Insurance and Financial Ser
vices Corporation mentioned that "it was
exciting to be able to work with other pro
fessional women" in this type of setting.
Looking forward to hearing different per
spectives on leadership and management,
she mentioned that one challenge women
and minorities face in management is that
they are in a double bind.
"If a woman makes a mistake," she re
marked, "people notice, but if it's a man, it
can easily pass unrecognized."

Wright also observed that women are still
disproportionately represented in "staff po
sitions, while men overrepresent line jobs,
where you see profit and loss."
Having researched and experienced
many of the issues raised by the women at
tending this year, Margaret O'Keefe
Umanzio remarked that what she hopes
women will draw from the course a sense of
"what the real, true essence of authentic
leadership is."
She added that if she "were to come up
with one overarching purpose of the whole
conference. . . it is to allow these partici
pants to experience in the course what it is
like to step into the unknown, and in the
process of stepping into the unknown" to
come to understand their own personal
leadership.
"So what we've set up here," Umanzio
elaborated, "is to over the eight days, take
them on a whirlwind tour."
Umanzio began the first day by "going
over the last 8,000 years (of history)," she
said.
"I will be looking at the patterns around
the world throughout history, going back to
6,000 8.C.," she said. "We will look at ideol
ogy, the organizational forms that have de
veloped and the definitions of leadership.

We then compare these cross-culturally."
Not only are the women learning about
leadership and social organization histori
cally, but Umanzio suggested that they are
"talking about fundamentally changing the
way in which relationships are structured
and changing the way in which power is dis
tributed. ... If we are not able to do this at
this point in time, Umanzio warned, "we are
just going to continue seeing exactly what
we have had for the last 8,000 years."
Initiated last year, the executive insti
tute was so successful that three sessions
are being offered this summer on campus.
After teaching a course at Mills college to
gether on women and leadership, Umanzio
and Paola Gianturco, the instructors for the
course, began coordinating the summer in
stitute with Matteo and Nikki Draper, pro
gram coordinator for the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender. Both in
structors are corporate executives them
selves — Umanzio is managing director of
the Asset Development, and Gianturco is
president of the Gianturco Company.
The institute aims to maintain the net
work of women executives through re
unions and e-mail in order to foster contin
ued leadership, support and learning in cor
porate management for women.
