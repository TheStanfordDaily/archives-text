## The 						Stanford Weekly Evict illegal tenants 
### 
OVER THE PAST few
weeks, the University
has found several sub
letters in summer housing
and has evicted them from
their subletted homes. While
subletting does not appear to
be very large problem, it is
good that the University is
taking an aggressive stance
on its policies.
Subletting at Stanford in
the summer is not an uncom
mon practice. Students regu
larly rent their two-person
apartments to other students
and thereby reduce their cost
of living for the summer. It is
easy enough to spot sublet
ting in Rains, Mirrielees and
Escondido Village.
Although subletting is for
bidden by the Housing
Agreement that every stu
dent signs before accepting
University housing, many
students find that they can
get away with it over the
summer.
Students who rent out
their rooms or apartments
for the summer are violating

the legal agreement they en
tered with the University.
Students should be forced to
abide by this contract with
the University as they would
any other binding legal
agreement.
In addition to serving the
University's legal and finan
cial interests, evicting stu
dents who are staying illegal
ly during the summer also
helps contribute to the resi
dential atmosphere. Stu
dents who sublet the apart
ments are often forced to
avoid contact with other stu
dents and resident assis
tants. These students, then,
are not contributing to resi
dential life.
The University is within
its rights to eject subletters
from University housing. By
finding subletters and ask
ing them to leave, the Uni
versity is not only showing
students that the law is
meant to be obeyed, but is
also giving them valuable
lessons that will help them
for the rest of their lives.
