# Affordable apartments
## 
### 
TO THESE STUDENTS,
MANY of whom have
summer jobs, all that is
necessary is an apartment for
sleeping. It might not be eco
nomical to stay in nearby
towns when they can live on
campus and sublet University
apartments from friends or
acquaintances.
Subletting violates the
Housing Agreement, and the
University has correctly eject
ed subletters it has found in
University apartments. But
examining the problem of
summer subletting makes evi
dent one way the University
can help ease students' sum
mer housing woes.
Some students sublet space
in University housing simply
to lower the cost of housing —
for instance, residents in a

two-person room can save
money if they rent space on the
floor to a third person. Other
students sublet housing be
cause they will not occupy
their apartments for the whole
summer.
The University should look
into making apartment-style
housing plans for students
more affordable and flexible in
the future. Where possible, the
University could offer lower
room rates to students willing
to live in more crowded rooms.
It could also allow students to
rent University housing for
only part of the summer.
By taking these steps, the
University could prevent con
flicts with student subletters
and help make summer life
easier — and cheaper — for its
students.
