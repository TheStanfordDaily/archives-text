## The
						culture of work 
### 
Every day my sturdy
brown-and-black clock radio
erupts with the sounds of
morning; traffic reports crackle
from the speaker, and snippets of
news updates tug at my eardrums.
By 7 a.m., I'm choking myself with
a badly knotted tie and finding out
that I put shaving cream on my
toothbrush. As my roommate
heads peacefully into another hour
of rest, I nudge my car into the
quiet streets to begin another sum
mer's day at the office.
I don't want to give the impres
sion that I don't like working; I
enjoy my job. Having logged hours
everywhere from an electronics
warehouse to a horse show to a
governor's office, I've been fortu
nate enough to encounter an inter
esting mixture of people, environ
ments and, most notably, work.
I've learned a lot from the working
world, and I now understand that
this ecosystem of water coolers and
voice mail truly harbors its own
culture.
One distinct feature is the role of
coffee. When I churned out 17-hour
days at a horse show, the staple for
everyone was gallons of this stuff.
My boss did not enjoy coffee — she
needed it. Upon stepping into her

car, my feet crushed the inhabi
tants of a Styrofoam-cup grave
yard. She amazed me not only with
her caffeine tolerance but with the
added physical gifts she obtained
from this potent elixir. Imagine
blading full speed in front of Toyon
with a Dixie cup of the liquid and
never spilling a drop of it. Then you
could understand her driving skills
with coffee in hand.
I've found the same reliance
upon coffee in other places as well
— for those who work in offices,
check the difference in the de
meanor of your co-workers before
and after the first pot finishes
brewing in the morning.
Another point of interest within
the working world involves the
struggle for control of The Radio.
For inhabitants of cubicle colonies,
the type of music piping through
speakers is crucial in making the
workday into an uninterrupted
medley of good tunes and produc
tivity — or turning it into a lesson
in discord, an onslaught of mind
numbing Muzak and botched as
signments. A summer in an office
with co-workers who literally
guarded the radio and maintained
its dial at "all country, all the time"
taught me this lesson.

Finally, intra-office relations
prove the most distinguishing and
curious aspect of the working cul
tures which I've explored. The
memorandum serves as a good ex
ample — I initially took it at face
value, a paper that dryly recited a
reminder or a change in plans. That
is not its true purpose — it can be a
speech, a warning or even a shout
expressed through Helvetica.
These are observations of the
real core of the working world -
the unsaid and the implied. Busi
ness meetings confer ideas, con
flicts, but with such a unique di
alect of inferences and intonations
that they can mask thoughts like "I
told you so," "I don't know" or
"Yeah, whatever." Here is where I
can currently learn the most; hope
fully, I can apply this newfound
glossary in conversation during
the school year. In this way I won t
have any problems, only "chal
lenges," and I won't be indecisive,
I'll be "researching opportunities
for re-engineering my master
plan."
