## Graduate student has found paradise at Stanford 
### 
Going to graduate
school at Stanford straight
out of college is like dying
and floating into heaven. The anxi
ety that clutches feverishly onto
every senior college student evapo
rates as soon as one walks through
the Main Quad. Most of my friends
are delaying even the application
process to grad school, so they can
taste the bit of the real world. But
life in the Stanford universe is
chimeric; an air of fantasy gently
swirls around the senses, refresh
ing your nostalgia for an eternal
spring.
One feels lighter here; although
our minds are busy assimilating

daunting stretches of knowledge,
there is a bounce, a joi de vivre no
ticeable in the student's walk. Per
haps there is something mystical to
reputation that fuels the myth of
what it means to be here. Or maybe
it's the accessibility to accom
plished professors and well-funded
facilities that is so impressive.
My friends are either out of the
country, running from America or
living at their parents' house,
where they work at anonymous in
ternships a commute away from
home. Some of my older friends are
still at college, desperately trying to
milk what's left of naivete and ide
alism of an undergraduate career.

But we play our cards as they're
dealt.
The great thing about going to
Stanford is that I'm not dead and
I'm not in heaven. The world is a
beautiful place when you converse
with brilliant people from around
the globe and walk through his
toric architecture in an unhistoric
state. It seems as if Stanford is an
aberration to the throwaway cul
ture characteristic of California.
Not that I don't love California, but
there is something different here.
Pride in tradition is uncommon out
West, as any Easterner will notice.
I imagine that the campus was
magically lifted from an edenic

dreamland of rich thought and
beauty and deposited in Palo Alto
as a gift.
I don't know what brought me
here, if it was a generous payback
for all of the hard work or the pass
ing fancy of a nameless admissions
counselor. Whatever it was, I feel
luck, and luck can only be good.
The days of summer are drifting
idly and each other, suffusing
memory and time into a warm,
green blur of tranquility. So if this
is what it means to be at Stanford, I
can only hope that heaven will be
as sweet.
