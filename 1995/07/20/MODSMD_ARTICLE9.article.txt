# Alumnus says 'Moon at Noon' was exercise in 'psychotic puberty'

I have just finished reading
Dr. Thomas Sowell's "Observa
tions" article in the July 17 issue

of Forbes, entitled "Bosnia vs.
Stanford." I'm sure you will find
the article, covered with caustic
comments, posted on your bul
letin board. Over the years I
have become somewhat inured
to the klutzy counterculture ca
pers of Stanford students; how

ever, mass moonlighting at high
noon in the main plaza on cam
pus presents a puerile portrait of
the bottom of the class. Incredu
lously, this exposure of caboose
cleavage was the project of a psy
chology course. I think it can be
more accurately described as an

exercise in psychotic puberty.
Apparently, the project was a
success because a number of stu
dents made perfect asses of
themselves. I wonder if their
professor joined them?
