You'll Lovl Stanford Flying Club!
Fly to Santa Fe or Taos in less than 5 hours for less
than $125 per person, and no advance purchase
or airline-style restrictions apply.
Santa Fe and many other aerial adventures are
within a morning's easy reach, and at a
surprisingly low cost once you become a pilot
through SFC.
Most Members complete our Solo Pilot License
course with 10 to 20 hours of flying time. Two
seat planes start at $39/ hr. including fuel, and you
only pay for actual flight time. You can even take
a lesson while flying to Santa Fe.
Call for details, a free flying-time map, and our
free information folder. Or try a $75 test flight.
You'll love it!
