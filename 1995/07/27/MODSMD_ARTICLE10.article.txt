# The 						UC regents drop their affirmative action policy; Stanford defends its own
## 
### Eric Hsu Contributing writer 
Stanford boasts one of the
most ethnically diverse campuses
in the country. As universities go,
it also weighs in with the best in
terms of academic excellence and
the strength of its student body.
Yet neither quality is neces
sarily a consequence or a guaran
tee of the other.
That is the challenge which
faces the Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid each year when
it settles down to choose a new
crop of students.
In the wake of the controver
sial University of California re
gents' decision regarding affir
mative action policies, the Stan
ford community may find cause
to reflect on the convoluted de
tails of its own position towards
minority recruitment and selec
tion. In an interview Wednesday,
Dean of Admissions and Finan
cial Aids James Montoya stood by
Stanford's long-sought goals of
maintaining diversity alongside
academic distinction.
Dean Montoya summarized
Stanford's policy with the state
ment that "all students, targeted,
or nontargeted, are looked at as
individuals, and on the basis of
their own unique experience."
The story behind Stanford's
selection criteria begins in 1885,
when Leland and Jane Stanford
founded the university "to ad
vance learning, the arts and sci
ences, and to promote the public
welfare." In the most recent Fac
ulty Senate version, which was
ratified in 1989, immediately fol
lowing the original charge comes
the statement that "[the Univer
sity! seeks undergraduates of
varied ethnic, social, cultural and
economic backgrounds: women
and men whose talents, achieve
ments and character suit them
for leadership."
This initial stab at an "ideal di
versity" makes no mention of af
firmative action. Combined,
these two statements reflect the
fact that throughout its history,
Stanford has sought to provide
the best education and produce
the best citizens for the con
stituency it serves, acknowledg
ing the fact that through time,
that constituency has changed in
composition.
Having established that the

University extends consideration
to everyone at any given time, the
criteria statement goes on to clar
ify what "everyone" means to a
private institution like a univer
sity.
It indicates that Stanford is
not xenophobic, and that the "un
dergraduate community is drawn
from throughout the United
States and from many foreign
countries."

Neither is this a trade or tech
nical university: "The University
admits students with highly de
veloped skills in particular areas
as well as those with versatility in
a number of fields."
Poets have as a good a chance
at admission as the next calculus
whiz or as the next doodler, as
does the person who is all three.
Moreover, the statement con
tinues, Stanford strives not to be
a school for the idle rich. Hence,
"admissions are decided without
regard to the applicant's econom
ic resources."
Finally comes a two-part state
ment with the catchphrase: "Af
firmative action programs pro
mote equality of opportunity for
minorities; there are no restric
tive quotas of any kind." The
clause after the semicolon falls in
the spirit of the paragraph. The
University does not exercise any
restrictive quotas upon either mi
nority or majority populations.
As for the first part, Stanford
does, however, engage in affirma
tive-action programs which seek
to promote the "equality of op

portunity for minorities."
The first consideration in ap
proaching this tangled affair is to
determine Stanford's definition
of a targeted minority popula
tion. At present, these include
African Americans, Mexican
Americans and Native American
Indians.
James Montoya, Dean of Ad
missions and Financial Aid, ex
plained the term as "those groups
which are under-represented by
both national and state stan
dards."
African Americans comprised
7.5 percent of the 1994-95 admit
ted class, Mexican Americans 9.4
percent and Native Americans
1.2 percent. The proportions of
these groups in state and nation
al populations, according to the
1990 census, are 12 percent na
tionally for African Americans,
25.8 percent in California for
Mexican Americans, and 0.8 per
cent nationally for Native Ameri
can Indians. Within a reasonable
statistical margin, all of these
groups qualify.
Montoya indicated that under
representation is more than a
numbers game. "Under-repre
sentation should also result from
clear, historical inequality in this
country, rather than result from
problems of poverty, recent im
migration or discrimination in
some foreign country."
He also cautioned against
overzealousness. In determining
which populations fall under af
firmative action policies, "we
must also think about the addi
tional question — that of re
sources which will be necessary
to support targeted groups."
Montoya went on to point out
that "targeted" status is not stat
ic. He cited a recent Faculty Sen
ate committee study which re
viewed Stanford's affirmative ac
tion practices and reevaluated
those populations which quali
fied as targeted.
Dated October 4, 1994, the
committee report states, "The of
fice of Undergraduate Admis
sions is responsibly carrying out
stated Stanford University poli
cies. . . . The three ethnic groups
currently targeted for under
graduate admissions — African
Americans, Mexican Americans
and Native Americans — should
continue to be targeted."
Montoya noted that the exis

tence of these periodic investiga
tions, undertaken by the faculty
themselves, addresses the nu
merous requests of different
groups to be considered targeted.
Montoya indicated the status
of under-represented popula
tions sometimes informs the se
lection of schools to which special
mailings and recruiting visits is
made. But they remain only com
ponents of a larger recruiting
program.
Outreach efforts like these ef-

'I think there are
many individuals who
misunderstand and
oppose what they
think is to be the
case There are
those who believe
ethnicity is the prima
ry criterion for admis
sion, versus academ
ic achievement.'
— James Montoya

fectively allow the admission
committee to cultivate a highly
diverse applicant pool and worry
less about the exact ethnic make
up of the class. The result is the
luxury of selecting from compar
atively qualified students.
The moment of truth arrives
when the folders finally show up
on Dean Montoya's desk and a de
cision must be made between
equally qualified applicants; tar
geted groups receive special con
sideration. However, "legacy" ap
plications and the children of eli
gible Stanford faculty and staff
also receive special attention —
designations which are all the
prerogative of an independent,
private university.
As an independent institution,
Stanford does not fall under the
same guidelines that govern pub
lic schools like the University of
California and the California
State University system. It does

receive public funds form the
state in the form of Cal Grants,
which supplement student finan
cial aid.
Nonetheless, Stanford's ad
missions and hiring procedures
are in compliance with state and
federal nondiscrimination laws.
"As far as we know, nondis
crimination federal guidelines
have not been revised, and we are
in keeping with them," Montoya
stressed.
For Stanford, however, the
question of affirmative action re
mains one based on principle.
Montoya stressed that the num
ber of minorities at Stanford
"represents the University's com
mitment, which is not mandated
by the federal government."
Of course, the most critical
variable among all these consid
erations is, and will always re
main, academic achievement.
The opening of the hefty para
graph which constitutes the
heart of the selection criteria
statement states in plain terms,
"The primary criterion for ad
mission is academic excellence; a
compound of exceptional capaci
ty, scholastic performance in re
lation to available opportunities
and promise of intellectual
growth."
"I think there are many indi
viduals who misunderstand and
oppose what they think is to be
the case," Montoya said. "There
are those who believe ethnicity is
the primary criterion for admis
sion, versus academic achieve
ment.
"An important part of my posi
tion is to provide a clear descrip
tion of our programs and demon
strate that academic excellence
and personal achievement are the
primary criteria, whether they
are minorities or non-minori
ties."
Even if representation and
equal opportunity reach equilib
rium, the challenge of what di
versity means to society and what
can be learned from it has not yet
been answered, and may never
be, Montoya said.
Alluding to exactly this hazi
ness which hangs over all the Ad
mission Office's activities, Mon
toya said, "What constitutes an
ethnically diverse student body is
a question that we have struggled
with for a long time and will al
ways continue to struggle with."
