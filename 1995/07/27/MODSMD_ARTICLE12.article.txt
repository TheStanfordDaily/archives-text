# Fire burns Foothills
## 
### 
The Stanford Police have no sus
pects in a suspicious two-alarm fire
that blazed on University property
near the Dish and the Stanford Stu
dent Observatory July 19, accord
ing to Detective Tim Schreiner.
The fire consumed two acres of
dry grass in the Foothills off Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard and Stan
ford Avenue and was said to be of
"highly suspicious origins" by Palo
Alto Fire Battalion Chief Ken Car
dinale.
Forty firefighters from the Palo
Alto, Mountain View and Los Altos
units were called upon to battle the
blaze. It took them two hours to
bring the fire under control. Nei
ther the observatory nor the Dish
was damaged in the fire.
The caller who reported the
blaze also saw a car of young adults
leaving the area, Cardinale said. A
preliminary investigation of the
site revealed nothing that could
have ignited the fire, such as power
lines.
According to Gary Dufresne,

Fire Inspector of the Palo Alto Fire
Department, subsequent investiga
tion uncovered "lots of evidence,"
including bottle caps dated July
1995.
"It looked like a group ... was
having a little party up there,"
Dufresne said.
Nevertheless, from available evi
dence, it is impossible to determine
whether the fire was incendiary or
accidental, said Dufresne.
The Foothills near the Dish are
renowned as a hangout for area
teenagers who want to view the city
lights from Stanford heights,
among other things, said Dufresne.
He speculated that a group of
youths may have accidentally start
ed the fire and fled the scene.
With this year's heavy rainfall,
the grass in the Foothills is longer
than usual, making grass fires in
the area a particular concern.
"These present a significant dan
ger if we don't get them out quick
ly," Cardinale said.
