# New dean of students named
## Wais comes from Maryland, wants to promote communication 
### 
The Office of the Vice Provost
and Dean of Student Affairs ap
pointed Marc Lee Wais Dean of
Students Tuesday. The announce
ment came after a search to fill the
position vacated by Michael Jack
son in late March.
Wais will be leaving his job as
assistant vice president for stu
dent affairs at the University of
Maryland at Baltimore, a post he
has held for the last three years.
Wais previously had served as the
dean of students at his alma
mater, Fairleigh Dickinson Uni
versity in New Jersey.
The University of Maryland en
rolls 1,000 undergraduates and
4,200 graduate and professional
students.
"I missed working with under
graduate students," Wais said. As
Stanford's dean, Wais will work
with 14,000 students, half of
whom are undergraduates.
Although Wais's family has
mixed feelings about moving from
Baltimore, they understand that
coming to Stanford presents a
great opportunity, he said.
However, "we haven't asked
the 11-month-old," Wais, who has
two daughters, added.

Wais formally will take on the
position on Sept. 17.
"It may give me just enough
time to catch my breath and pre
pare for new student Orienta-

tion," he said.
Wais said he
hopes he can en
courage students
to communicate
with him.
"I just don't
want to commu
nicate [only] with
student leaders,"
he said. In addi
tion to talking to
student leaders,

he hopes to engage students in
dining halls and at campus events.
He sees the dean's role as facil
itating efforts by students to
shape their campus, rather than
molding the campus to his own vi
sion.
"Students are the central force
that shapes the campus communi
ty," he said. "It's really where they
see themselves, and me helping to
achieve that."
Wais said he is not sure how
much work is needed in helping
Stanford students stay focused on

academics, but from what he has
seen it will not be much of a prob
lem.
"Do they take academics here
seriously? My sense is absolutely,"
he said.
James Larimore, who has been
serving as acting dean of students
since Jackson's departure, said he
will return to his doctoral pro
gram in the School of Education.
He said he will probably get to
work with Wais as part of a re
search assistantship with the
Provost's Office.
"I'm really looking forward to
working with him," Larimore
said. "He is a seasoned profession
al."
An 18-member search commit
tee composed of students, faculty,
and staff and headed by Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid James Montoya
began poring over applications for
the position in May. They nar
rowed the pool down to the five
strongest finalists before Vice
Provost and Dean of Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds made the
final decision.
