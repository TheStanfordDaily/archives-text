# New language head 'speechless'
## 
### 
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Etchemendy announced the appointment of Eliza
beth Bernhardt this week as director of the new Stan
ford Language Center.
"Professor Bernhardt is an outstanding re
searcher in the field of second-language acquisition,"
Etchemendy said. "This was a difficult search process
made from an extremely strong applicant pool."
Bernhardt will also be a professor in the German
Studies Department.
"I'm speechless, rather odd for a language special
ist," she said.
Bernhardt will be leaving her professorship in the
School of Education at Ohio State University, where
she has been teaching for the last 10 years. In addition
to her many published works, she has won numerous
awards for research in the study of second-language
reading skills.
"My foremost goal is to ensure that Stanford pro
vides the best foreign-language instruction available
nationally," she said.
The new center is the result of a recommendation
from the Commission on Undergraduate Education,
which also encouraged the creation of a Division of
Literature, Language and Culture to house Stan
ford's six language departments.
Construction of the Language Center in Building
30 should be completed by next summer,
Etchemendy said.
Bernhardt will assume her post shortly after
Labor Day. In a preliminary interview, she indicated

her first priority as director will be to facilitate the im
plementation of the new language requirements set
for the 1996-97 school year, another Commission rec
ommendation.
The Language Center will coordinate computa
tional and equipment resources, but Etchemendy
stressed it will be more than a resource center.
"What I think most people don't realize about this
center is that we're taking a leadership role in lan
guage instruction nationwide," he said.
Since the inception of the new Division of Litera
ture, Language and Culture, controversy has sur
faced about the ability of foreign languages at Stan
ford to retain the autonomy and distinctiveness of
their individual departments.
For example, the executive committee which
heads the division will have control over all appoint
ments and promotions in the various departments.
"I want to avoid the principle that the only differ
ence between foreign languages is that they sou nd dif
ferent," said Slavic Languages and Literatures Prof.
Richard Shupbach.
Bernhardt, however, said, "The executive com
mittee and the dean's office have the same objective
— the delivery of the best services in foreign-lan
guage instruction. I don't believe any one of them
wants to see the individual departments homoge
nized. I don't think there's any dispute about this.
And if I believed there was a dispute, I wouldn't be
here."
