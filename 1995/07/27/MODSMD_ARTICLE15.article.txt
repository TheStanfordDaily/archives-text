## Baseball: When we enjoyed the game 
### 
One of the best stories I've heard was
my attempt to run away. During a
camping trip with my family and
friends in C anada, I stole the keys from my
parents and tried to drive away. Unfortu
nately, or fortunately, I was foiled when I
broke the key in the ignition of the car, forc
ing my parents to call a locksmith for help.
I was two at the time.
I never tire of hearing this story or the
hundreds of others involving me or my fami
ly. Most of the oddities in my life happened
when I was very young, and my only connec
tions with these events are through the
words of my parents.
Likewise, I never tire of reading about his
tory and people retelling history. There is a

wealth of information
available if you go and read
a book. My bookshelves at
home are filled with the his
tory of the world. The col
lection runs from ancient
history (Greek myths) to
relatively modern history
("The Guns of August") to
"A Brief History of Time."
However, the majority

of the shelf space is devoted to my menagerie
of sports history, especially baseball history.
I once heard or read that the smaller the
ball, the better the books (golf is not consid
ered a sport).
This has to be the most true statement in
sports, even more so than the übiquitous
"We're taking it one game at a time."
The best-written works on sports are the
ones on baseball. The game lends itself to the
written word. There are many reasons for
this but the best is:
Baseball is poetry in motion.
Like poetry, it's an acquired taste, and
sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad.
Also, there's a rhythm with every game.
Sometimes you may feel it's too slow, and
other times it's just doesn't feel quite right.
But when it's a work of art, everybody
knows it.
It is the same with writing on baseball.
The most famous work is "Casey at Bat."
Most everyone remembers the final words,
"mighty Casey has struck out." (My feeling
is that the Mudville Nine needed a player to
protect Casey and take the pressure off him,
much like Barry Bonds needs Matt
Williams.)
Others remember the Cubs' double play
combo of Tinkers to Evers to Chance even
though they weren't great defensively, never
talked to each other and Frank Chance was a

royal pain in the ass.
They were fabled in neither story nor
song but poetry.
The history of baseball is probably more
important than the game itself.
While the Civil War documentary was
worth around eight hours to Ken Burns,
baseball took up 19.
I have the entire documentary on tape.
No other sport looks back on itself in such
grand a light. Football remembers its history
as a bloody time where certain plays had to
be outlawed because too many people were
getting hurt, or maybe memory goes as far
back as the original Oakland Raiders. For
many, basketball's past only goes back to
1980, when two guys, a black and a white, en
tered the league and saved it. Others might
reminisce about the ABA and its red, white
and blue balls, and the rest know only two
eras: before Michael Jordan retired and after
he came back.
For baseball, people remember its past as
when it was a game.
A quick quiz of history:
Ask anyone, who's the best player ever in
football? Not many will have an answer of
the top of their heads.
Ask the same question for basketball and
most will say (sadly) Jordan.
Ask it about baseball and you'll start a
brawl.
Another quiz, this time word association:
Canton. Springfield. Cooperstown.
The correct answers are China, the Simp
sons and James Fenimore Cooper.
Or you could go with the location of the
Halls of Fame for football, basketball and
baseball, respectively. Now, how many of
you actually knew that?
When I visited Cooperstown one fine
summer day, my understanding of baseball
changed. Prior to then, it was only words and
the brief images I had seen on television. It
all changed.
I was in awe. My jaw dropped as I entered
a time I had only read about.
All those names came alive.
Ruth, Gehrig, Cobb, Young, Wagner,
Waner, Williams, DiMaggio, Mantle, Mays,
Aaron, Clemente and Morandini (well, Mick
ey did donate his spikes to Cooperstown
when he made that unassisted triple play).
I worshipped the shrine of Honus, the
Flying Dutchman, when I saw his locker and
uniform. I swelled with emotion when I saw
the life-size statue of Roberto Clemente
wearing his number 21.
The most expensive baseball card was
there, as was the bat that was made out of a

telephone pole. The Negro Leagues came
alive as pictures became associated with the
words I read.
And the busts, the hundreds and hun
dreds of faces cast in bronze.
I went to each one, looking and trying to
reconcile the faces and the names. As I saw
each one, I would turn to my sister and tell
her a brief fact or story about each player.
All the things I had previously read now
meant something.
History is not complete until you've read
it and seen it. The first time I visited the Lou
vre, it meant nothing to me.
Later, I read about art history and studied
it. When I went back seven years later, those
images and works gave me a chill I didn't
think possible. The Mona Lisa was a letdown,
but the Venus de Milo was true beauty.
Cooperstown may be a nice place to visit if
you only have a passing interest in baseball,
but to really have an understanding for the
game, you have to learn about it first.
I recommend reading everything you can
about baseball, but there are some works you
cannot do without if you want to be consid
ered a true fan.
Before you do anything, learn some stats
of the greatest players in the game. Know
how many home runs Hank Aaron and Babe
Ruth hit, find out Ty Cobb's batting average.
Discover what positions they played and
whether Cy Young was a righty or lefty. "The
Baseball Encyclopedia" used to be the source
for this, but they've changed to "Total Base
ball." I think they've ruined the aesthetics
with the switch.
Read Lawrence S. Ritter's "When It Was
a Game." It's the best book on baseball ever.
It contains stories of the great players of the
'10s, '20s and '30s in their own words.
I also suggest Roger Angell's "Once
Around the Ballpark." Angell is a editor of
the New Yorker and in my opinion, the best
writer on baseball. This is a collection of his
best stories and it has a strong transcenden
tal influence.
Finally, I recommend the "Fireside" se
ries. A collection of the best works ever on
baseball, it contains both fiction and nonfic
tion pieces. The "Fireside Reader" is a col
lage of the first three books, and it is the best
one. The fourth book came out a few years
ago, but I found it disappointing.
Remember, history is not dead unless you
choose to ignore it.

Emery would like to change history and take
back Jose Lind's error in game seven of the
1992 NLCS.

It is the same with writing on baseball.
The most famous work is "Casey at Bat."
Most everyone remembers the final words,
"mighty Casey has struck out." (My feeling
is that the Mudville Nine needed a player to
protect Casey and take the pressure off him,
much like Barry Bonds needs Matt
Williams.)
Others remember the Cubs' double play
combo of Tinkers to Evers to Chance even
though they weren't great defensively, never
talked to each other and Frank Chance was a

royal pain in the ass.
They were fabled in neither story nor
song but poetry.
The history of baseball is probably more
important than the game itself.
While the Civil War documentary was
worth around eight hours to Ken Burns,
baseball took up 19.
I have the entire documentary on tape.
No other sport looks back on itself in such
grand a light. Football remembers its history
as a bloody time where certain plays had to
be outlawed because too many people were
getting hurt, or maybe memory goes as far
back as the original Oakland Raiders. For
many, basketball's past only goes back to
1980, when two guys, a black and a white, en
tered the league and saved it. Others might
reminisce about the ABA and its red, white
and blue balls, and the rest know only two
eras: before Michael Jordan retired and after
he came back.
For baseball, people remember its past as
when it was a game.
A quick quiz of history:
Ask anyone, who's the best player ever in
football? Not many will have an answer of
the top of their heads.
Ask the same question for basketball and
most will say (sadly) Jordan.
Ask it about baseball and you'll start a
brawl.
Another quiz, this time word association:
Canton. Springfield. Cooperstown.
The correct answers are China, the Simp
sons and James Fenimore Cooper.
Or you could go with the location of the
Halls of Fame for football, basketball and
baseball, respectively. Now, how many of
you actually knew that?
When I visited Cooperstown one fine
summer day, my understanding of baseball
changed. Prior to then, it was only words and
the brief images I had seen on television. It
all changed.
I was in awe. My jaw dropped as I entered
a time I had only read about.
All those names came alive.
Ruth, Gehrig, Cobb, Young, Wagner,
Waner, Williams, DiMaggio, Mantle, Mays,
Aaron, Clemente and Morandini (well, Mick
ey did donate his spikes to Cooperstown
when he made that unassisted triple play).
I worshipped the shrine of Honus, the
Flying Dutchman, when I saw his locker and
uniform. I swelled with emotion when I saw
the life-size statue of Roberto Clemente
wearing his number 21.
The most expensive baseball card was
there, as was the bat that was made out of a

telephone pole. The Negro Leagues came
alive as pictures became associated with the
words I read.
And the busts, the hundreds and hun
dreds of faces cast in bronze.
I went to each one, looking and trying to
reconcile the faces and the names. As I saw
each one, I would turn to my sister and tell
her a brief fact or story about each player.
All the things I had previously read now
meant something.
History is not complete until you've read
it and seen it. The first time I visited the Lou
vre, it meant nothing to me.
Later, I read about art history and studied
it. When I went back seven years later, those
images and works gave me a chill I didn't
think possible. The Mona Lisa was a letdown,
but the Venus de Milo was true beauty.
Cooperstown may be a nice place to visit if
you only have a passing interest in baseball,
but to really have an understanding for the
game, you have to learn about it first.
I recommend reading everything you can
about baseball, but there are some works you
cannot do without if you want to be consid
ered a true fan.
Before you do anything, learn some stats
of the greatest players in the game. Know
how many home runs Hank Aaron and Babe
Ruth hit, find out Ty Cobb's batting average.
Discover what positions they played and
whether Cy Young was a righty or lefty. "The
Baseball Encyclopedia" used to be the source
for this, but they've changed to "Total Base
ball." I think they've ruined the aesthetics
with the switch.
Read Lawrence S. Ritter's "When It Was
a Game." It's the best book on baseball ever.
It contains stories of the great players of the
'10s, '20s and '30s in their own words.
I also suggest Roger Angell's "Once
Around the Ballpark." Angell is a editor of
the New Yorker and in my opinion, the best
writer on baseball. This is a collection of his
best stories and it has a strong transcenden
tal influence.
Finally, I recommend the "Fireside" se
ries. A collection of the best works ever on
baseball, it contains both fiction and nonfic
tion pieces. The "Fireside Reader" is a col
lage of the first three books, and it is the best
one. The fourth book came out a few years
ago, but I found it disappointing.
Remember, history is not dead unless you
choose to ignore it.

Emery would like to change history and take
back Jose Lind's error in game seven of the
1992 NLCS.
