Following the highly publicized ex
plosion of Jeff Tarango at Wimbledon,
two additional former Cardinal athletes
added to the reputation of Stanford
stars being spoiled.
Both incidents occurred in New York.
The first involved Yankees pitcher Jack
McDowell, who played baseball for the
Cardinal in the '80s.
Apparently frustrated with the way a
name against the Chicago White Sox
went and the constant booing from the
fans, McDowell "threw the bird" at fans
last Tuesday. He later apologized.
As penance, he was required to pay a
$5,000 fine and buy an unspecified num
ber of tickets to be given away to fans.
The other former Stanford athlete
was tennis great John McEnroe, who
was involved in a dispute with a neigh
bor.
McEnroe's 61-year-old neighbor,
Eleanor Weinstein, told the New York
Daily News he grabbed her and spun her
around after she confronted him about
monopolizing the apartment elevator.
A statement released by a spokesman
for McEnroe denied those charges.
"Angry words were exchanged by
both parties, but the other incidents re
ported in the newspaper story bear no
resemblance to the facts," the statement
read.
Weinstein filed a complaint with the
police, but police said that she failed to
name the suspect and the case was
dropped.
