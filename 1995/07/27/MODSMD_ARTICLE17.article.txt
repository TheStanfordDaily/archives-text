glimmer Movie Se^tel£ I:'-U •• I
Packed in among Stanford students,
Silicon Valley execs, deathrockers,
teenagers and a token elderly couple, I
waited for the movie to begin. Patrons
passed the time dancing in the aisles.
As the lights dimmed, the crowd went
wild over previews lb#%e Crow" and
"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan." Noth
ing in space is scarier than Ricardo Mon
taiban with silicone pecs.
|Other - scheduled films include "A
Clockwork Orange," "Monty Python and
the Holy Grail" and John Woo's über-bru
tal "Hard-Boiled."
Through Sept, 16, the Aquarius will
roll out the cheese. The series is, in the
words of current manager Steve Mager,
"*a lot ol|olA/.sassk&' movies people
haven't seen for a while ... movies with
an edge, a campy presence, something
unique,"
Mark Lippawen, a Stanford student
and Aquarius employee, compared the se
ries with Stanford's now-defunct Friday
Night * Classic" Flicks series.
"You're definitely going to get a differ
ent' kind crowd," he said, : *one thai
comes oat to the classics, not just the new : i
18ms they've missed in the theater."
As demonstrated by the "Blues Broth
ers" patrons in black suits who crunched
toasted white bread, a midnight screening
is a phenomenon, not a time slot.
"It was nice to see a bunch of people
getting dressed up " Lippawen said*
If this scenario sounds like a showing of
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show," it
should.
In many ways, the Aquarius Summer
Movie Series fills the void left b| the dis
appearance of "The Rocky Horror Picture
Show," which departed along with the
Varsitj? f&eater last siii&ner, Likeihat do
part ed cult event, Summer Movie Series
targets young people.
*J&ds can come here that are-&nder
age; this gives people a place to golim a
Saturday night that's a group environ
ment/ noted Steve Mager, the Aquarius'
manager,
Last summer, the Aquarius unsuccess
fully ran "The Rocky Horror Picture

Show,*' ,'IM
Lippawen said, "Rocky Horror gets
pretty stale after a while— In the past
couple years it didn't generate the popu
larity that we have" with the Summer
Movie Series, He explained that the
Aquarius aims to create an exciting at
mosphere through the venue's variety.
"If we can get a lot of people to come
every Saturday because it's a fun place to
be, then we've succeeded," h&saiC.
Mager introduces the features himself
by passing out door prizes to random au
dience members. The prizes include free
movie passes and gif|;|Wficateste local
vendors.
Stanford senior farina jUng*-; who
watched "Wild at Heart" in the smaller
auditorium, said/that; : ahe- ;
theater ambience to that of a dorm enter
tainment system, "It's $o much eose||o
see (these films} on the big screen, and be
surrounded by- all these other! people,
laughing."
Compared td Flicks, she preferred the
Aquarius environment
"I don't hke;pasiri throwing J#j.ft's
tacky." she said. "And there weren't just
college students here."
"Movies are made to be seen on a wide
screen," Goluboff said, "You should watch
movies at the movies."
Jake and Elwood return
For years, television's Smaller aspect

However, the audience paid the price of
poor print copy.

the actors' lips don't inOVO with their
Voices.
Despite problems with fdm quality, the
music was loud and Barnes

orphanage,|ihe#! : exact; |he wrath o£tte
local *la# enticement authorities,.: the
local Nazi party, a Country and Western
band and a blatantly psychopathic ex-girl
friend (Carrie Fisher). The film has an all
star cast r .featuring musical and cultural
icons Pee-Wee Herman, Steven Spielberg,
Frank Os and Twiggy.
Jake and Elwood tip their fedoras to
cinematic classics like Charles Laughton's
"The Night of the Hunter," Sergei Eisen
stein's "October" and D«W, Griffith's
"Birth of a Nation." Although subtle, the
mini-parodies are readily apparent if the
filmgoer is familiar with these other
movies.
Even I was kitsched.
Saturday night special
Though not as climactic for college stu
dents as for their curfewed teenybopper
counterparts, Mager hopes the midnight
movie-watching experience will provide
both groups with fun outlets fo|jamimmer
Weekend. He is contemplating iontmuing
the series next summer* and even inffrthe
school year,

bjrthe Aquarius' staff; however; schedules
jforiifuture films may be picked from a sug
gestion box or even picked to coincide wits*
Stanford's Sunday Night Flicks.
"It might not be a bad idea to play our
series off of Stanford's, Something to com?
plement what they're showing and feed
Off [Flicks'] popularity," Lippawen sug
gested >4 J.y
For instance, if Stanford shows the lat
est Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster,
the Aquarius can show "The Terminator"
orfftercules in New York.*
