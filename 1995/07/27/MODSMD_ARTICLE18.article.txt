# Gilroy Garlic Festival: great tastes to match breath
## 
### Melissa Hung Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writers 
It's a garlic world after all. In the small
town of Gilroy, from July 28 to 30, a pun
gent wonderland will spring up. Touted as
the "smelliest party on the continent," the
annual Gilroy Garlic Festival will prove
that garlic can be incorporated into every
facet of your life. Among the plethora of

bulb creations, you will
find garlic foods, garlic
hats, garlic crockery and

garlic paintings.
A nonprofit event, the festival start
ed 17 years ago as the brainchild of
Rudy Melone, then president of Gavilan
College in Gilroy. Inspired by an article
about a French garlic festival, Melone
set out to prove that right in the back
yard of the Bay Area, where the garlic
crop nets $35 million to $40 million a
year, was where the main garlic revelry
should be. The scene was set at a Rotary
Club luncheon. Melone invited hard
core garlic careerists — the growers,
shippers and processors — to show
Gilroy Rotarians, along with some food
editors, how important the economic
and nasal impact of garlic was on the
area.
Seventeen years later, through the
sweat and community pride of volunteers,
over $4 million raised through the Garlic
Festival have been donated to local organi
zations and charities.
Last year, 125,000 garlic lovers made the
Garlic Festival sojourn, admittedly, most as
slaves to their taste buds. The many entic
ing dishes this year will include calamari,
scampi, pasta con pesto and pepper steak
sandwiches — all with a garlic twist. Save
some room for the Cajun garlic wings, gar
lic sushi, escargot, mushrooms stuffed with
garlic and garlic chicken.
For the eccentric sweet tooth, there is
garlic ice cream. And everyone must savor

a classic — the garlic bread.
Unfortunately, garlic food is not
dropped like manna from heaven. But since
it's not, why not watch some of the festi
val's celebrity chefs turn into garlic special
ists for three fun-filled days? Among them
this year will be television star Martin Yan
from "Yan can Cook."
Or don the white puffy hat yourself and
enter your favorite garlic treat into the The
Great Garlic Cook-Off. Your garlic dish will
be joining the huge masses of garlic used at
the festival. In 1994 alone, 2,888 pounds of
fresh garlic were pressed, chopped and han
dled lovingly to create the fine delicacies
available.
But don't let your stomach hog the day,
for in Gilroy, garlic goes beyond your in
nards. There will be an arts and crafts area
where you can find other fragrant relics of
the not-so-subculture of Gilroy. The booths
will also have original jewelry, sculptures
and beautiful stained glass, all temporarily
garlic-scented.
If you've been meaning to explore your
creative, vampire-fighting side, take advan
tage of the garlic braiding classes that will
be offered.
And you can braid (or dance) to the beat
of live entertainment! Four different stages
will feature sounds and sights including
belly dancing, bluegrass, folk music and
country / rock.
Whether or not you have dreams and

hopes of Garlic Court royalty for yourself or
a loved one, the Gilroy Garlic Festival will
welcome you pungently and make you feel
like Queen or King of the Bulb for a day, or
two, or three.
