Distinguished cardiologist
and Cardiovascular Medicine
Prof. Richard Popp is scheduled
to succeed Dr. Robert Cutler as
senior associate dean for acade
mic affairs in the School of Med
icine on Sept. 1.
Popp, currently a member of
the Medical School Appoint
ment and Promotions Commit
tee, has held multiple adminis
trative positions, including
chair of the Faculty Practice
Program Finance Committee
from 1990 to 1992. He served
as associate chair of medicine
from 1980 to 1983 and as act
ing chief of two divisions — res
piratory medicine and cardiolo
gy-
Cutler left the senior posi
tion after 13 years of service.
Popp is "an extraordinarily
diligent and faithful citizen of
the School of Medicine. He is a
very level-headed, even and fair
individual," said Medical School
Dean Eugene Bauer. He added
that Popp was likewise a re
markable individual faculty
member noted for his research

and academic career.
"The major functions of the
position," according to Bauer,
"include faculty recruitment,
development, and overall reten
tion."
Although the senior dean has
assumed "incremental respon
sibilities," such as moderating
"conflicts of interest, scientific
misconduct, research integrity
and federal regulation," specific
challenges facing the new dean
parallel "those of the Medical
School in general," Bauer
noted.
One challenge will be to
"focus on recruitment of top
notch faculty in times of major
constraint of resources," Bauer
said. He hopes that the Medical
School will "not compromise on
quality, despite the realities of
imposing restrictions."
An expert on Parkinson's
disease, Cutler has been at
Stanford since 1974. In 1988,
he was appointed senior associ
ate dean for faculty affairs (now
renamed academic affairs).
