# Farm greets five new trustees
## 
### 
After an intensive months-long selection process,
the Alumni Trustee Selection Committee has select
ed five Stanford alumni to serve on the Board of
Trustees beginning Sept. 1.
The new trustees were chosen largely for the
skills, personal qualities and experiences that they
would bring to the board, according to Alumni Asso
ciation President William Stone.
The new trustees are: Douglas Brown of Albu
querque, N.M., the president and chief executive
officer of Talbot Financial Services; Elizabeth Du
manian of Mountain View, a psychotherapist; Ivan
Fong of Bethesda, Md., an associate with the law
firm of Covington and Burling; Chien Lee of Hong
Kong, founder and director of Scottish and East
ern Investment Services; and Beverly Ryder of Los
Angeles, a manager at Southern California Edison
Co.
John Freidenrich, chair of the Board of Trustees,
said was impressed with all the new members.
"I think it's a wonderful group of people," he said.
"This group is intelligent and informed, with the
time and energy and the ability to cope with direc
tion setting in a group," Stone added.
Four of the five members will serve five-year
terms beginning in September, while Brown will
complete the remainder of a term vacated by former
trustee Anne Bingaman.
Ranging from a former law clerk for Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to an interna
tional businessman, the new trustees bring new di
versity to the board. Lee, who holds a bachelor's, an
MBA and a master's in operations research from
Stanford, will be the board's first international
trustee.
According to Freidenrich, Lee's appointment

marks an important step in the University's efforts
to maintain a worldwide outlook.
However, while Lee's appointment is symbolical
ly important, Freidenrich said, it would be a mistake
to ignore Lee's individual qualifications and the cre
dentials of the other appointees.
"We were very happy to have a candidate of his
qualifications," he said.
In a separate process, the board appointed Brad
ford Freeman of Los Angeles to a five-year term that
began last month. Freeman was originally on the se
lection committee to pick the five new trustees but
was later nominated by the board.
Though not equipped with a fixed agenda, some
appointees are looking to focus on some specific is
sues.
"I was interested in serving the University in a
different capacity" said new trustee Dumanian, who
co-founded the Haas Center for Public Service as an
undergraduate. Dumanian said she has an interest
in alumni affairs, in Residential Education and in
giving the students a voice in the day-to-day affairs
of the University.
Other members have not targeted specific areas
of interest in the University. Brown said he feels that
his first task is learning the ropfcs.
"The first thing a rookie does is listens and
learns," he said.
Freeman also said he was still learning about the
workings of the board.
"I'm sort of the new kid on the block," Freeman
said.
Freeman said that while he has served on a num
ber of boards in the past, serving as a University
trustee presents a unique challenge.
