## The 						Stanford Weekly Keep affirmative action 
### 
Regents' decision is
poorly thought out
mend it, don't end it.

THE JULY 20 affirma
tive-action decision by
the University of Cali
fornia regents is sure to send
ripples throughout the nation.
The regents voted by a surpris
ingly decisive margin to end
racial and gender preferences
in hiring, employment con
tracts and admissions at the
nine UC schools, respondingto
the growing public discontent
with affirmative action, its
goals and its methods.
By eliminating all racial
and gender preferences, the re
gents risked oversimplifying
the issue of affirmative action
and jeopardized the quality of
the UC system — partially, it
seems, to serve the Presiden
tial ambitions of Gov. Pete Wil
son.
Certainly, affirmative ac
tion programs should not be
immune to scrutiny. Universi
ties should constantly review
their policies, and if they find
that some policies are unfair,
discriminatory or otherwise
undesirable, those policies
•shfmid modified or tossed
out.
-Although some affirmative
action programs may need to
be dismantled, it is not reason
enough to abandon affirma
tive action altogether, as the
regents did. As President Clin
ton wisely counseled in a
speech Wednesday, the na
tion's approach to affirmative
action should be to "mend it,
don't end it."
Affirmative action pro
grams are still necessary in our
nation to ensure that tradi
tionally disadvantaged groups
are allowed fair and equal op
portunities. It would be ludi
crous to claim that equality of
opportunity has been achieved
in society, or even on college

campuses. Women and minori
ties are still represented
among the nation's college fac
ulty at rates disproportionate
to the population. Personal
preference and personal effort
alone cannot explain the dis
parity; the dominance of
whites and males in higher ed
ucation is due in part to past
and present discrimination
against women and members
of certain racial and ethnic
groups.
Another suggestion often
offered, wrongly, by opponents
of affirmative action is that
women and minorities should
establish equality themselves
by working harder than tradi
tionally privileged groups.
This is as unreasonable as, say,
asking whites and males who
are not responsible for dis
crimination to give up their
property and status to correct
past wrongs. Systematic dis
crimination should be elimi
nated by changing the system,
not by placing unfair demands
on individuals.
Thankfully, Stanford offi
cials have said the University
will stand by affirmative ac
tion even as the political tide
rises against it. But while the
UC regents' decision does not
affect Stanford directly, future
actions by the state and federal
government may threaten
Stanford's ability to continue
its commitment to affirmative
action.
Instead of prematurely de
claring victory against dis
crimination and slashing
blindly at affirmative action
programs, policy makers must
continue the fight and take a
more prudent approach to
ward repairing flawed affir
mative action programs. Stan
ford students, faculty and
staff should do their part by
involving themselves in
thoughtful discussion of affir
mative action across the na
tion and by taking a principled
stand in support of worthy
programs.
