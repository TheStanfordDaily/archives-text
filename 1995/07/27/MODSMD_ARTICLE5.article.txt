Chen was wrong; Clemente was loved by Pittsburg fans

I'M WRITING IN response to
Emery Chen's "Professional
sports, racism and society." I
have no reason to quibble with
Chen's statement that "there is
still racism in sports," although I
question his observation that
"petulant, moody and whining
are adjectives that are exclusive
ly applied to blacks and Latinos."
John McEnroe and Tonya
Harding most readily come to my
mind as athletes who've been
lambasted in the popular press

for their personality traits. Since
racism persists in all other seg
ments of our society, I see no rea
son to assume that sports might
be an exception.
However, I wish to take issue
with this young writer's asser
tion that "Roberto Clemente was
considered a whiner, a person
who faked injuries and a detri
ment to his team before people
realized his true greatness after
his death." I'm not sure which
"people" Chen is referring to, but

as someone who grew up as an
avid, white baseball fan in Pitts
burgh in the '60s and '70s, I can
assure him that Roberto
Clemente was loved, respected
and revered during his career by
thousands of Pittsburgh fans of
all ages and races. His sudden
death at the peak of his career
was mourned as a tragic loss in
that city.
Chen's one-sentence dismissal
of Clemente's fans is not only a
dishonor to the memory of

Clemente, but also a denigration
of the strides made by all of the
great and courageous baseball
players, from the Negro Leagues
to Jackie Robinson to Roberto
Clemente, in integrating profes
sional baseball. Moving forward
and not forgetting the accom
plishments of their predecessors
should be the task of all new,
young players and sports writers.
