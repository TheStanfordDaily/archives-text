## Worlds of suspicion 
### 
IWAS FLIPPING through my
dorm -directory recently when I
spotted a friend's tidy square of
personal data with his favorite say
ing: "Don't expect anything from
anyone." Initially I was surprised
by his choice, because he generally
maintained a congenial attitude.
Now I realize that his selection had
less to do with his demeanor than
with his perceptiveness. In retro
spect, he may have succintly sum
marized the law of a world filled
with mistrust.
Maybe I attended too many
grade school assemblies playing
out frightening scenarios of chil
dren meeting evil strangers, or saw
too many public service announce
ments featuring the dog in the
trench coat. In any case, I under
stood that strangers were not to be
trusted — you weren't to get in the
car or step into the house. But the
people you knew by name or could
recognize by uniform, well, you
could run to them for help and
knock on their doors. The world
was clearly separated in this way,
and I was relieved. I couldn't trust
everyone, but at least I knew who I
could trust.
Somehow that blessedly simple
philosophy was flattened under the

wheels of mankind rushing to em
brace his insecurities. Whether
peering through a lens or being
openly obnoxious, we perpetuate
our suspicions of others in every
arena. Acquaintances, co-workers
and symbols of the law and the
state can no longer be granted the
leniency of trust that was given
easily in the past.
We no longer fear betrayal — we
anticipate it, absorb it and shrug it
off. Employers split time between
watching the showroom floor and
the employee lounge. A corporate
giant allegedly lied to Congress
after claiming to have no basis for
finding addictive properties of
nicotine. Members of federal law
enforcement agencies appear on
videotapes of "Good 01' Boys
Roundups" that include vendors
hawking T-shirts that depict the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the
cross-hairs of a gun. High schools
promote mandatory drug testing
for athletes. A state governor bases
his gubernatorial race on a promise
not to run for President if elected,
and months later, he begins a drive
for the White House.
The saddest victim of this social
disintegration is the most sacred —
our personal relationships. Ire

cently learned of the development
of a new series of laboratory tests
that enable parents to submit hair
and other samples to learn if their
children have traces of drugs with
out them knowing it. Perhaps the
war on drugs has merely ushered
in a new weapon, and this sort of
stealth is necessary in some eases.
Nevertheless, I find the support for
such tactics from both the testing
companies and parents disturbing
Promoting awareness is one mat
ter. Advocating suspicion another.
Perhaps people have suffered
too many wounds from ill-given
empathy or misguided warmth.
Events like the Susan Smith inci
dent leave a lasting sting of both
sadness and anger. But amidst all
these precautions and peeping,
prenuptial signings and panes o(
bulletproof glass, what has im
proved? People do not sigh with re
lief from their newfound edginess;
they feast upon it. We have wel
comed anxiety and nurtured ani
mosity — you can trust in that.

Dave promises not to be tardy an\
more. Or else he might be, shall w
say, "evicted."
