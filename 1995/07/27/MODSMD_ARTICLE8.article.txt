# Docs train for emergencies on dummy patients

In the midst of complicated surgical pro
cedures, the bleeding, an anesthetized pa
tient could, at any moment, suffer such com
plications as asthmatic attack. Years of med
ical training teach doctors to perform
surgery, but for novices to the medical field,
handling emergency situations may be the
most difficult skill to learn. And the only way
to get better is to practice.
In an emergency situation with a real
human life at stake, a resident would proba
bly have to yield control to the more experi
enced doctor â€” until now.
At the Palo Alto Veterans Administration
Hospital, some "patients" are actually com

puter-controlled mannequins capable of
simulating most of the bodily functions peo
ple may fall prey to in an emergency situa
tion: stopped heat rate, rapid breathing,
asthmatic attack.
The process, also called simulated
surgery, is a joint project of the PAVAH and
the Stanford Medical Center. It was designed
to let anesthesiologists and residents in
training rehearse for emergency-room situa
tions without the risks of using a real human
being.
The simulated surgical utility at PAVAH
occupies four rooms and forms a key new
part of the Center for Anesthesia Crisis Man
agement.
Such test runs allow medical personnel to

practice control, delegation and effective
communication under simulated operating
room pressures.
The technique was started by Stanford
Prof. David Gaba in 1986 when he became
interested in studying how anesthesiolo
gists think and work and in improving pa
tients' safety. Using applied concepts from
aviation, Gaba modeled the simulation
surgery after a flight simulator that was
used to train pilots.
This July, simulation surgery was incor
porated into the PAVAH.
The simulator is currently being used by
anesthesia residents in training in a course
called Anesthesia Crisis Resource Manage
ment. This past weekend, a three-day course

was held at Stanford to train instructors,
and discussions are being held to incorporate
the simulator into the UC-San Francisco
curriculum.
This center targets anesthesiologists, but
Gaba is pursuing the development of analo
gous courses for ICU personnel, emergency
room staff and operating room nurses. He
hopes to develop combined team-training
paradigms for nurses and surgeons that
would train each of the "crew" members.
The response to the simulator has so far
been positive.
As anesthesiologist Steven Howard re
marked, "It's all practice. When you meet it
in the real world, you'll know how to deal
with it."
