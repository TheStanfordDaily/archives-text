# Decision brings no change—but much controversy to Farm
## 
### Stewart Maclennan Contributing writer 
In a historic decision which de
fied President Bill Clinton's plea to
"mend, not end" affirmative action
July 19, the governing regents of
the University of California voted
to end decades of affirmative action
policies designed to diversify the
faculty, staff and students at the
nine UC campuses.
Although the regents' decision
will certainly provoke further de
bate at such elite campuses as UC-
Berkeley, the question on the
minds of faculty, administrators
and students on this side of the Bay
will be whether the ruling will have
an impact at Stanford.
The final vote of 14 to 10 to elim
inate race as a factor of student ad
missions was at one point inter
rupted by Rev. Jesse Jackson and
more than 100 protesters linked
arm-in-arm, singing, "We Shall
Overcome." In addition, the re
gents voted in a separate decision to
end race- and gender-based hiring

and contracting.
Gov. Pete Wilson, an outspoken
opponent of quotas and minority
set-asides, exercised his preroga
tive to oversee the meetings and
called upon the Board of Regents to
end affirmative action. "We cannot
tolerate university policies or prac
tices that violate fundamental fair
ness, trampling individual rights to
create and give preference to group
rights," he said at the regents'
meeting last Thursday.
The new ruling will undoubtedly
boost Wilson's standing among
conservative Californians as a 1996
Republican presidential contender.
Although the governor had earlier
in his career favored affirmative ac
tion, he was jubilant when the re
gents adjourned after hours of de
bate.
"The adoption of [these mea
sures] says California's diversity
should be achieved naturally rather

than through preferences," he said
at the meeting.
Jackson disagreed. "You can go
forwards or backwards. Going
backwards means denying race and
gender as factors," he said last
week. "This is politics at its lowest."
When asked if the decision will
affect Stanford, Sally Dickson, di
rector of the Office of Multicultural
Development, said, "It will not
change anything we are doing."
Stanford reacts
"What we are doing is right. We
believe in it; diversity is very impor
tant," Dickson said.
She added that she did not ex
pect Stanford's commitment to af
firmative action to substantially
hurt the University even as affir
mative action falls out of favor with
the public. She also pointed out
that some of Stanford's affirmative
action policies are mandated by
state and federal anti-discrimina
tion laws.
"If we are following the law, I
hope we don't receive any negative
publicity," Dickson said.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner also emphasized that the
legal context of the ruling is impor
tant and yet not very clear. Kras
ner, who described affirmative ac
tion as "wrong in principle," cited
White House Spokesman Leon
Panetta's statement that the feder
al government could potentially
withdraw funding from the UC sys
tem if the new policies are em
ployed.
"It would be irresponsible of
Stanford to eliminate affirmative
action if the government were to
drop funding or research grants
from the University," Krasner said.
The regents' vote, along with
President Clinton's July 19 state
ment supporting affirmative ac
tion, indicates that the issue is be
coming an increasingly prominent
and tense issue on the nation's
agenda.
"It's no surprise that affirma
tive action is an issue in which there
is not agreement in our society,"
Dickson said.
Multicultural Educator Tommy
Lee Woon said he worried that the
decision might have a divisive im
pact on American society.
"I feel like the decision escalates
the polarization that's going on in
this society," Woon said. "It creates
an even more dangerous social and
political environment for all of us."
"The whole idea of taking sides
may not be the right thing to do," he
said.
Chris Clarke, assistant director
of El Centro Chicano, also said he
feels that the recent UC ruling will
fuel political fires.
"There are now two very ex
treme political poles, with Wilson at
one end and maybe Jackson at the
other," Clarke said.

University Communications Di
rector Terry Shepard said the Stan
ford administration had no imme
diate plans to make a statement on
the UC decision.
"We won't comment on the UC
ruling," he said. "We're not experts
on the matter and it would be best
to let them go through with their
own process. We're worrying about
Stanford."
Shepard did, however, empha
size that the regents' decision has

little bearing on Stanford.
"The decision has no direct ef
fect on us. It may even have less di
rect effect on the UC campuses
than everyone thinks. We're not
going to do anything based on the
fact that this happened at the UC
[schools]. I think, in general,
there's no sense that Stanford
should dramatically change its
course; most people are reasonably
comfortable that we're doing the
right thing," he said.
Law School Dean Paul Brest ex
pressed a similar sentiment.
"Both the Stanford administra
tion and the Board of Trustees have
supported affirmative action for a
long time — not quotas, but the di
versity that someone brings to the
University," he said. "It would sur
prise me greatly if we followed suit
of the UC. We pride ourselves on
our independence."
Shepard said Casper will issue a
statement on affirmative action in
the fall.
Varied perspectives
"Affirmative action has
worked," Dickson said, adding that
it has provided opportunities to
groups who were discriminated
against in the past.
Clarke warned that the benefits
of affirmative action may be under
mined by the regents' ruling.
"Students are going to take the
UC decision as a signal," he said.
"For first-generation minorities,
there's not a lot of information on
affirmative action out there. When

they hear about the UC decision,
many may say to themselves, I m
not going to apply here,' and will
end up selecting themselves out of
the admissions process."
Clarke stressed that Stanford
should now take steps to clearly ar
ticulate its position on affirmative
action, and added that his own or
ganization, El Centro Chicano, will
define its own vision of affirmative
action for the public.
"Affirmative action should look
at the whole individual,' he said.
"Race and gender should be consid
ered to the same degree as a special
education at an elite private
school."
Calling Stanford's admissions a
"fairly sensitive system," Clarke
said he thinks the University's cur
rent procedure will work to the ad
vantage of minorities if all other
factors are equal.
"Our ideal is a colorblind soci
ety," he said, "but we're not there
yet."
Sophomore Julie Johnson, pres
ident of the Stanford College Re
publicans, said she thinks that af
firmative action has done more
harm than good.
"There was a time when it was
really necessary to have affirmative
action, but now preferences aren't
the best way to address the issue of
race," she said. Johnson added that
affirmative action has had the ef
fect of demeaning minorities.
"A cloud of suspicion hangs over
the heads of minorities," she said.
She said it was unfortunate that
"any real achievements and accom
plishments are cheapened."
According to Johnson, minority
students often ask themselves if
they were accepted to schools be
cause of their qualifications or be
cause they were members of target
ed minorities.
"No human deserves to live with
that doubt," Johnson said.
Gavin Funabiki, chair of the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, said he supports the Universi
ty's efforts to make Stanford as "di
verse as possible," and that the cur
rent percentage of Asian Ameri
cans at Stanford is "about right."
Just Presidential politics?
Critics of the regents' decision
claim that presidential politics
played too great a role.
Krasner said there was no doubt
that Wednesday's ruling was partly
motivated by Wilson's attempts to
latch onto a controversial issue
which will bring him into the politi
cal spotlight. He added, however,
that there is "clearly widespread
concern in society over whether af
firmative action is a just policy."
Clarke said he was disappointed
that Wilson has taken such a severe
position in order to attract atten
tion.
"It's obvious that presidential

politics are involved," he said.
Johnson disagreed. "In reality
politics must always be taken into
account when policy is
formed. Persons with authority
must pay attention to the attitudes
of people. In other words, if the end
of affirmative action wasn't some
thing that people wanted, then
Gov. Wilson wouldn't be pursuing
it," she said.
Brest offered a similar outlook
"I think the issue of affirmative
action goes beyond Gov. Wilson's
candidacy," he said. "There clearly
is a nationwide expression of con
cern about affirmative action 1 low
deep the concern is and exactly
what it's about varies tremendous
ly. For one thing, a politician
doesn't highlight an issue unless lie
thinks that he's speaking to a con
cern that exists."
Affirmative action's future
To many Stanford administra
tors, the fate of affirmative action
remains unclear. Dickson speculat
ed about the effects the UC ruling
might have on Stanford's future
applicant pool.
If the number of black and Lati
no students enrolled at UC schools
declines after the regents' decision
goes into effect, as the UC officials
have predicted, she said, Stanford
might see changes in the future in
the size and characteristics of the
pools of applicants to Stanford's
graduate and professional schools
Woon said that he could not pro
diet what might lie in the future for
affirmative action at Stanford, but
he said that history might offer
some glimpse of the future.
"Some people have made refer
ences to how similar events oc
curred after slavery," he said. Ac
cording to Woon, after slavery, sup
port services for former slaves were
established and then later eliminat
ed by Congress.
What happened to those efforts
long ago might provide clues to tin
fate of affirmative action, he said
