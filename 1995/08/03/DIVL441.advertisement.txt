You'll Love Stanford Flying Club!
Fly to Puget Sound or San Diego in a few hours,
in a private airplane for less than $60 per person.
No airline-style restrictions apply.
Puget Sound and many other adventures in the
Western States can be reached within just a few
hours, and at a surprisingly low cost, when you
learn to fly through the SFC.
Most Members complete our Solo Pilot License
course with 10 to 20 hours of flying time. Two
seat planes start at $39/ hr. including fuel, and you
only pay for the actual engine time. Ybu can even
use a trip to Puget Sound as a flying lesson.
Call for details, a free flying-time map of the
Western States, and a free information folder. Or
try a $75 test flight. Ybu'll love itl
