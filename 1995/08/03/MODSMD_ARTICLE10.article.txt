## Don't try to remake history – learn from it apolitically 
### 
Recently, while on a
visit to Japan, I had a
chance to see something
that most Americans have been
prevented from seeing: a museum
exhibit detailing America's World
War II atomic bombing of Japan.
The museum, located in Hi
roshima, was well thought-out
and executed. Exhibits effectively
showed the destruction the bomb
wrought wrought on people and
property. Other displays showed
technical information about atom
ic bombs and the current state of
nuclear armament and testing.
Curators had attempted a quite
brief explanation of why America
had dropped the bomb. Other
signs — new ones that had been
pasted over old text — expressed
regret for Japan's wartime inva
sion of other Asian nations. Pearl
Harbor was mentioned once, tan
gentially; the sign did not include
the fact that Japanese troops were
the attackers on December 7.
Running behind all the exhibits
was a clear message. It is the view
both of the museum and the city
that houses it that the Aug. 6,
1945 nuclear bombing was a form
of nuclear test. Other nuclear
testing continues today; the newly
elected French president has com
mitted to more trials.

The conclusion presented by
the exhibit was that no people will
be safe until all testing stops and
all nuclear weapons are gone.
Whenever a test is carried out, Hi
roshima's mayor sends a telegram
asking that country's leader to
cease testing. Some of the
telegrams were on display in the
museum.
In sum, the museum did its job.
Visitors received information,
gained understanding and were
spurred to think. It was not too
long or too short, too maudlin or
too austere.
If I've gone on at length about
the museum, it's because most
Americans have been deprived of
their chance to see a similar pre
sentation, although not for lack of
planning. The Smithsonian Insti
tution had arranged for a full ex
hibition to explore the bombing,
complete with artifacts, informa
tion and interpretations about the
bombing, its effects, meaning and
necessity.
Then the Smithsonian's exhib
it was halted. Some veterans'
groups, feeling provincial, were
scandalized that anyone would
provide information that might
lead someone to question the rec
titude of the atomic bombing. A
host of politicians and govern

ment employees — some on the
attack, others on the defensive —
quickly scaled back the exhibit to a
shadow of its former self. In doing
so, our national museum robbed
the public it is supposed to serve of
the chance to learn, to better un
derstand and to analyze an event
of world-historical importance.
Why did this embarrassment
occur? Why did an institution ded
icated to information cave in to
censorship? After all, history is by

Andy Dworkin

definition in the past, and what's
over and done can't hurt anyone.
But history is not in the past, it
is in the present. History is tied up
with questions about power and
morality, debates over fact and in
terpretation. Moral judgments are
one of the easier — and many be
lieve less important — parts of his
tory, yet they inevitably pop up.
The withering of the Smithson
ian exhibit is not really a debate
over the past, then. It's also not a
debate over historiography; I have
heard few historians oppose the
exhibit as originally planned. The
furor was over power. Veterans,
politicians and others were ex
pressing fear that Smithsonian

visitors might think about the
bombing and decide it was wrong.
In their worst-case scenario,
many people would decide the
bombing was wrong and knock
the nuclear hawks from their
pedestal. Prestige would fall, and
with it, power.
It's not just that the winners
write history. History also writes
the winners. And when history is
reconsidered, so are the heroes
and villains. Some call it revision
ism, or reevaluation, or rectifica
tion. Yet there is a simpler term
for this process of gathering and
evaluating information on the
past, trying to gain insights and
evaluate decisions and results:
history. These processes are the
very work of history.
I guess one should not wonder,
in that case, that history can prove
so controversial, and not just at
the Smithsonian. In the drafting
and subsequent criticism of na
tional history teaching standards,
Americans fought not only over
the past but over who has power
today. Other battlegrounds in
clude Columbus Day ceremonies,
Disney movies and theme parks,
Southern Baptist conventions.
These fights in themselves are
not bad; indeed, they serve to edu
cate people about historical is

sues, to spur inquisitive minds.
The tragedy comes when the de
bate ends and censorship begins.
The tragedy is that some people
think asking questions and
reevaluating old answers is too
dangerous for the American pub
lic. We are treated like children,
and an opportunity to grow is lost.
When I entered the atomic
bomb museum in Hiroshima, I be
lieved that the United States was
right to bomb that city 50 years
ago. After seeing the destruction it
caused, and after gaining a greater
understanding of the nature of the
event and its aftermath and the
nuclear position of the world
today, I was compelled to reevalu
ate. I thought about the issues in
new ways. I learned. And in the
end, I still believe that the U.S.
bombingof Hiroshima was proper.
I guess the people who stopped
the Smithsonian's exhibit
couldn't imagine something like
that happening to a visitor — or
didn't want to risk another out
come. So they made sure no one
would have the opportunity.
How they are judged will be left
to history.
