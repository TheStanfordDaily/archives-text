"We should have just demon
strated it, not wiped out a whole
city!"
"The A-bombs instantly killed
103,000 people! It wasn't moral to
use them!"
And the beat goes on. Every
year. And this year, the 50th an
niversary of the Aug. 6,1945 atom
ic bombing of Hiroshima.
The belief that Japan was ready
to surrender is usually the first ar
gument people offer in condemning
the use of the A-bombs. History,
however, reads much differently.
In May 1945, tentative openings for
peace talks were made by Allen
Dulles, chief of our OSS Branch in
Bern, through the Japanese lega
tion in Switzerland. They were met
with silence. On July 26 — 12 days
before the first A-Bomb was
dropped on Hiroshima — the Pots
dam Declaration was broadcast to
Japan threatening "utter destruc
tion" of the Japanese homeland un
less the imperial government of
fered its unconditional surrender.
On July 28, Japanese newspa
pers published a government-cen
sored form of the Potsdam Declara
tion. Cut out of the wording was the

Allied promise that the Japanese
people would not be enslaved as a
race or destroyed as a nation. That
evening, American airplanes
dropped copies of the full text of the
declaration over 11 Japanese cities,
warning that a tremendous air
bombardment would result if
Japan did not surrender under the
terms of the Potsdam Declaration.
The Allied ultimatum was ig
nored. The banner headline of the
New York Times on July 30 read,
"Japan Officially Turns Down Al
lied Surrender Ultimatum."
No Japanese dared speak of
peace. More than 400 people in
Japan were arrested during 1945

on the mere suspicion of favoring
negotiations. What many Ameri
cans did not know then, and per
haps still do not know, was that the
Japanese people were not in control
of their fate. The Japanese
Supreme War Council was. And
what many Americans have also
forgotten — or never knew — was
the ferocity with which the Japan
ese always fought. Remember the
invasion of Tarawa by the U.S.
Marines in 1943? Only eight of a
garrison of 3,000 Japanese sur

vived.
In World War II the Japanese
lost 1,555,308 killed in battle.
Twenty men died for every one that
was wounded. As many Japanese
died on the small island of Oldnawa
as were killed by the Hiroshima A
bomb. The Japanese always exhib
ited their determination to fight to
the death — theirs and their
enemy's. At the moment of Japan's
surrender the population was mo
bilized to fight to the death, and slo
gans everywhere proclaimed "One
Hundred Million Japanese will die
for the Emperor and the Nation."
By the end of June 1945, Allied
aerial bombing had devastated five
of Japan's largest industrial cen
ters — Nagoya, Kobe, Osaka, Yoko
hama and Kawasaki. More than
260,000 people killed, 2 million
buildings destroyed, and 10 million
people were homeless. And yet the
Japanese continued to fight. Even
after the A-bombing of Hiroshima,
the Japanese Supreme War Coun
cil announced that the casualties
and devastation caused by the A
bomb were by no means as great as
the firebomb raids Tokyo and other
cities had already withstood.
The next argument in condem
nation of the A-bomb says that the
Allied powers should have demon

strated the A-bomb to show the
Japanese how destructive it was.
Well, they did. First on Hiroshima,
on August 6, 1945, and then —
three days later — on Nagasaki.
More than 103,000 people were in
stantly killed.
Foreign Minister Togo's and
Prime Minister Suzuki's argu
ments to accept the Potsdam Decla
ration continued to meet heavy op
position from Japan's Supreme
War Council and the Cabinet. Fear
ing an imminent A-bomb strike on
Tokyo, Suzuki asked Emperor Hi
rohito to make the decision. He did,
and soon after dawn on Aug 10 a
wireless message announcing
Japan's readiness to accept the
terms of the Potsdam Declaration
was sent via Switzerland and Swe
den to the governments of the Unit
ed States, Britain and China. A
copy was also delivered to the Sovi
et Embassy in Tokyo.
The Japanese military contin
ued to fight against surrender, and
the war went on. On Aug. 12,
Japanese suicide submarines sank
an American submarine, destroyer
and destroyer escort.
At noon, on Aug. 15, 1945, Em
peror Hirohito's recorded three
minute announcement of Japan's
surrender under the terms of the

Potsdam Declaration was broad
cast to his nation. It was accom
plished despite the attempts by
groups of Japanese officers and
men to take Hirohito into "protec
tive custody" to abort any decision
to surrender.
The third argument A-bomb
critics offer is that the use of the A
bomb wasn't "moral." Killing peo
ple, however, is what war is all
about. Is it "moral" to kill 1,030
people or 10,300, and not moral to
kill 103,000? Over 50 million died
in World War 11. How many of them
were killed morally and how many
were not?
Both President Harry Truman
and Prime Minister Winston
Churchill regarded the A-bomb as a
military weapon and never had any
doubt about the need to use it to
compel Japan to surrender.
The two atomic bombs did what
no weapons of any other nation
could have done at that time. They
saved Japan from invasion and the
loss of perhaps a million Japanese
and American lives. The A-bomb
ended a terrible war. That was the
moral thing to do.
