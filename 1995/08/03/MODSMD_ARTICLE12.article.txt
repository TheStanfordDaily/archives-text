# Missile technology adapted to blast away tumors

A group at the Stanford Med
ical Center has combined precise
image tracking, robot control and
X-ray surgery to treat patients
with previously inoperable brain
and neck tumors. They can track a
tumor so accurately that sur
rounding tissue is unharmed by
their intense X-ray beam — with
out requiring physical restraint of
the patient.
The technique, known as com
puter-mediated stereotaxic radio
surgery (CMSR), involves track
ing the head and neck using X-ray
images taken during an operation
and comparing them to a stored
three-dimensional X-ray "map" of
the patient.
"It's a very simple algorithm
that came out of cruise missile
technology," explained Richard
Cox, a radiation physicist at the
Medical Center working on the
project.
A CAT (Computer Axial To

mography) scan of the region to be
treated forms the map which
guides the X-ray beam. The CAT
scan itself is a series of X-ray slices
combined by a computer to form a
three-dimensional model of part
of the patient's body.
The key to accurate tracking of
the tumor is careful matching of
bone images in the CAT scan to X
ray images taken during surgery.
Using the bones as markers, small
motions of the patient can be reli
ably measured and tracked, and
even small tumors can be pin
pointed and killed.
"In many respects it's more
akin to conventional surgery than
to conventional radiation," said
Dr. John Adler, a Stanford neuro
surgeon in charge of the project.
Other forms of stereotaxic ra
diosurgery seem barbaric in com
parison. To keep patients from
moving during conventional ra
diosurgery, their heads are rigidly
bolted into a frame by screws
which penetrate their skulls.
Until recently, this was the only

option for patients requiring in
tense radiosurgery.
Tuesday morning, a patient un
derwent CMRS for a tumor deep
in his brain. He entered the oper
ating room wearing street clothes.
Adler and several other doctors
and technicians positioned him on
the operating table, fixing his
head lightly in a brace to keep him
from moving out of the range of
the imagine system.
A large, folded robot arm pro
truding diagonally from one cor
ner of the room held the X-ray
source. The source consisted of a
small linear electron accelerator
with an X-ray tube on one end.
X-rays are high-energy light
particles that destroy living tissue
in large doses. They are produced
when the fast electrons from the
accelerator smash into a target,
creating a fine, high-energy beam
which acts as the "scalpel" in ra
diosurgery.
Once the patient's head was
manually positioned in the imag
ing system in Tuesday's opera

tion, the computer took over.
Mounted on the roof, two X-ray
sources — similar to those used by
dentists for dental X-rays — pro
jected images of his head onto
plates that were read into the com-

puter system.
The control
ling computer
compared the
two images
taken by the X
ray cameras to
the correspond
ing projections
calculated from
the stored CAT
scan. The com
puter then cal
culated the pa
tient's head po
sition to within
a fraction of a
millimeter.
Armed with
the exact tumor
location, the
computer
gracefully posi-

tioned the robot arm holding the
X-ray source. The first position
pointed from the floor up toward
the patient's head at a precarious
