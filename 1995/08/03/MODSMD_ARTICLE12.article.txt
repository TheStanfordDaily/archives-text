# Missile technology adapted to blast away tumors
## 
### Steven Kasapi Contributing writer 
A group at the Stanford Med
ical Center has combined precise
image tracking, robot control and
X-ray surgery to treat patients
with previously inoperable brain
and neck tumors. They can track a
tumor so accurately that sur
rounding tissue is unharmed by
their intense X-ray beam — with
out requiring physical restraint of
the patient.
The technique, known as com
puter-mediated stereotaxic radio
surgery (CMSR), involves track
ing the head and neck using X-ray
images taken during an operation
and comparing them to a stored
three-dimensional X-ray "map" of
the patient.
"It's a very simple algorithm
that came out of cruise missile
technology," explained Richard
Cox, a radiation physicist at the
Medical Center working on the
project.
A CAT (Computer Axial To

mography) scan of the region to be
treated forms the map which
guides the X-ray beam. The CAT
scan itself is a series of X-ray slices
combined by a computer to form a
three-dimensional model of part
of the patient's body.
The key to accurate tracking of
the tumor is careful matching of
bone images in the CAT scan to X
ray images taken during surgery.
Using the bones as markers, small
motions of the patient can be reli
ably measured and tracked, and
even small tumors can be pin
pointed and killed.
"In many respects it's more
akin to conventional surgery than
to conventional radiation," said
Dr. John Adler, a Stanford neuro
surgeon in charge of the project.
Other forms of stereotaxic ra
diosurgery seem barbaric in com
parison. To keep patients from
moving during conventional ra
diosurgery, their heads are rigidly
bolted into a frame by screws
which penetrate their skulls.
Until recently, this was the only

option for patients requiring in
tense radiosurgery.
Tuesday morning, a patient un
derwent CMRS for a tumor deep
in his brain. He entered the oper
ating room wearing street clothes.
Adler and several other doctors
and technicians positioned him on
the operating table, fixing his
head lightly in a brace to keep him
from moving out of the range of
the imagine system.
A large, folded robot arm pro
truding diagonally from one cor
ner of the room held the X-ray
source. The source consisted of a
small linear electron accelerator
with an X-ray tube on one end.
X-rays are high-energy light
particles that destroy living tissue
in large doses. They are produced
when the fast electrons from the
accelerator smash into a target,
creating a fine, high-energy beam
which acts as the "scalpel" in ra
diosurgery.
Once the patient's head was
manually positioned in the imag
ing system in Tuesday's opera

tion, the computer took over.
Mounted on the roof, two X-ray
sources — similar to those used by
dentists for dental X-rays — pro
jected images of his head onto
plates that were read into the com-

puter system.
The control
ling computer
compared the
two images
taken by the X
ray cameras to
the correspond
ing projections
calculated from
the stored CAT
scan. The com
puter then cal
culated the pa
tient's head po
sition to within
a fraction of a
millimeter.
Armed with
the exact tumor
location, the
computer
gracefully posi-

tioned the robot arm holding the
X-ray source. The first position
pointed from the floor up toward
the patient's head at a precarious

angle.
As the treatment progressed,
the arm slowly swept out five dif
ferent wide arcs to avoid exposing
the healthy tissue to too much radi
ation. Every dose, however, hit the
tumor.
After 45 minutes, the patient
walked out of the operating room
with a slight smile, gently aided by
his wife and joined by other family
members. He looked cheerful — de
spite nearly an hour of radiation
treatment. If the patient had un
dergone conventional stereotaxic
radiosurgery, he would have been
unconscious, and head wounds
fVi >m the brace alone would have re
quired hospitalization.
Despite its success, CMRS is still
in its beta testing stage, and the al
gorithms for position sensing are
till being investigated.
"Do we have the best algo
rithms?" Cox asked rhetorically,
if s not clear. We probably don't."
Nor does CMRS have approval
from the Food and Drug Admin
istration. Adler called the ap
proval process "very slow and te
dious."
"Unfortunately," Adler contin
ued, "people are dying all the time,
and it's my job to do the best I can."
"The most optimistic scenario

calls for [approval] being issued in
about 18 months," he said.
Adler sounded almost like a rev
olutionary when discussing his
CMRS work. "It really took a radi
cal view of how the world should be
organized to try to push this
ahead," he said.
Val Blanchette of Good Samari
tan Health Systems of San Jose, an
investor in the project, suggested
that the FDA is working hard but
"needs more time to evaluate the
software."
Asked what the biggest immedi
ate hurdle is for CMRS, Adler
replied, "Money."
Most big medical companies like
Siemens and General Electric, he
said, see themselves as diagnostic
companies, not treatment compa
nies. They have small divisions
which do work related to treat
ment, "but they're not committed,"
he said.
Neurosurgeons favor a "very
precise, very aggressive treatment"
in contrast to general radiation
therapy, Adler said. Medical com
panies are "traditionally aligned
with the radiologists" who favor
broad exposure and long-term
treatment.
"It's taken some dedicated cus
tomers, some out-in-left-field ven
ture capitalists and one small
crazy company (Accuray Inc. of
Santa Clara, Calif.) to try to make
this happen," Adler said emphati
cally.
