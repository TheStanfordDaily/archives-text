# From flautists to flautas, there's everything under the sun
## Stanfordites summer at Cal

Stanford's rivalry with UC-Berkeley has been am
plified by insults, pranks and animosity, but the rival
school has drawn a few Stanford students to its sum
mer school program. These Stanford-Berkeley con
flicts are also present in relationships: cross-univer
sity relationships prove a true test of devotion.
No where is the rivalry better illustrated than
during the week of the Big Game. Fourth-year Stan
ford student Cleve Cheng, who attended UC-Berke
ley last summer, commented on the Stanford-Cal ri
valry. He took a first year German class with mostly
graduate students.
"I always wore red, it was like a gang thing, people
get obnoxious around the Big Game era, but it's usu
ally not that bad."
Nonetheless, barring education, cleanliness and
safety, Stanford students at UC-Berkeley said the
school does have some redeeming qualities that
make it an interesting and unique place to live.
A major plus that the students reported was the
Berkeley food. Unlike Stanford, the food choices for
UC-Berkeley students after hours is not limited to
Stern Late Night and a trip to Juice Club. UC-Berke

ley students can choose from an array of food rang
ing from Korean barbecue to a "Fat Slice" of pizza
until 2 a.m.
"It's cheaper; it tastes better; it's easier to get to,"
said Stanford junior Jorge Chen, who has spent the
last six summers at UC-Berkeley.
Chen frequents one of the most popular pizza
places in Berkeley, Blondie's, located less than a
block from campus, where customers can purchase a
large slice of pizza for less than $2.
Good food is not without its risks, however.
"The first day of school," Cheng said, "I walked on
to the campus and picked up a copy of The Daily Cal,
and on the cover it said 'Man Killed at Blondie's.' I
had been to Blondie's a half a dozen times, too."
Telegraph Avenue is one of the main thorough
fares in the city, leading directly onto campus; the
busy street hosts many of the popular restaurants; it
can be thought of as an expanded Tresidder Union
within walking distance with more variety and
cheaper food.
"I've had everything from burritos to pizza to
falafels to sushi," said said recent Stanford graduate
Julie Cantor. "You can see how Stanford would be
better if Palo Alto was closer to Stanford and within
