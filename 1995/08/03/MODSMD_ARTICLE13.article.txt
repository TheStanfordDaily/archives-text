# From flautists to flautas, there's everything under the sun
## Stanfordites summer at Cal 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
Stanford's rivalry with UC-Berkeley has been am
plified by insults, pranks and animosity, but the rival
school has drawn a few Stanford students to its sum
mer school program. These Stanford-Berkeley con
flicts are also present in relationships: cross-univer
sity relationships prove a true test of devotion.
No where is the rivalry better illustrated than
during the week of the Big Game. Fourth-year Stan
ford student Cleve Cheng, who attended UC-Berke
ley last summer, commented on the Stanford-Cal ri
valry. He took a first year German class with mostly
graduate students.
"I always wore red, it was like a gang thing, people
get obnoxious around the Big Game era, but it's usu
ally not that bad."
Nonetheless, barring education, cleanliness and
safety, Stanford students at UC-Berkeley said the
school does have some redeeming qualities that
make it an interesting and unique place to live.
A major plus that the students reported was the
Berkeley food. Unlike Stanford, the food choices for
UC-Berkeley students after hours is not limited to
Stern Late Night and a trip to Juice Club. UC-Berke

ley students can choose from an array of food rang
ing from Korean barbecue to a "Fat Slice" of pizza
until 2 a.m.
"It's cheaper; it tastes better; it's easier to get to,"
said Stanford junior Jorge Chen, who has spent the
last six summers at UC-Berkeley.
Chen frequents one of the most popular pizza
places in Berkeley, Blondie's, located less than a
block from campus, where customers can purchase a
large slice of pizza for less than $2.
Good food is not without its risks, however.
"The first day of school," Cheng said, "I walked on
to the campus and picked up a copy of The Daily Cal,
and on the cover it said 'Man Killed at Blondie's.' I
had been to Blondie's a half a dozen times, too."
Telegraph Avenue is one of the main thorough
fares in the city, leading directly onto campus; the
busy street hosts many of the popular restaurants; it
can be thought of as an expanded Tresidder Union
within walking distance with more variety and
cheaper food.
"I've had everything from burritos to pizza to
falafels to sushi," said said recent Stanford graduate
Julie Cantor. "You can see how Stanford would be
better if Palo Alto was closer to Stanford and within

walking distance."
Cantor is currently taking two
physics classes at UC-Berkeley
and is living in the city of Berke
ley.
Although diversity is an aspect
that both schools stress in their
students, UC-Berkeley combines
the college atmosphere with a di
verse city.
The city is diverse not only in
its racial makeup, but in its so
cioeconomic makeup as well,
meaningthat students aren't just
mingling with young college stu
dents but also with tourists and
the colorful denizens of Berkeley.
"They have weird people
around all of the time and they
are fun to watch," commented
Cheng. "There were bums every
where — not that I mind bums.
There was also a man playing a
flute by the creek."
Panhandlers are as much a
part of the Berkeley lifestyle as
the street vendors and thrift
shops.
"The homeless people are def
initely around — they'll ask you
for change," Cantor said. "It's re
ality; it's a cross-section of the
real population, more than you'd
get walking through White
Plaza. It's the real world."
For Berkeley, there were no
complaints of college seclusion
that are often heard at Stanford.

The college flows directly into
the college town.
As a government-affiliated
university, UC-Berkeley's tu
ition is considerably lower than
Stanford's. This holds true for
the school's summer classes as
well.
Stanford charges per unit dur
ing the summer, and these costs
make UC-Berkeley's fees more
attractive, especially for basic
classes that are roughly equiva
lent everywhere.
"The only reason I went there
in the first place was because it
was so much cheaper to go there
for the summer than Stanford,"
said Cheng. "I would have paid
$5,500 at Stanford, and ended up
paying $925, so it was worth it,
despite the two-hour commute."
Cantor also agreed with
Cheng about the cost of UC-
Berkeley's summer school. She is
currently taking 12 units this
summer. "If I was taking these
classes at Stanford it would cost
me $5,000," she said.
The quality of education did
not appear to be a significant fac
tor when considering which sum
mer school to attend.
"It's $1,000 for two classes
here — that's just tuition. Hous
ing is only $150 here," said Chen,
although he added that "we pay
for what we get at Stanford."
Red or blue?
Despite the long-standing ri
valry between the two schools,
none of the Stanford students at

UC-Berkeley experienced any
significant harassment.
"The only harassment I've
gotten was friendly harassment
when one of my Berkeley friends
took off my Stanford alumni hat
and stuffed it behind a plant,"
Cantor said. "I would feel a little
bit intimidated if I wore my Stan
ford clothes to the gym, though
— I might try that."
Although most students en
joyed their UC-Berkeley experi
ence, their Stanford faith re
mained strong.
"Berkeley's a run-down,
strange, drug-infested place that
I really liked despite all of the
those things — or maybe because
of all of those things," Cheng
said.
"I liked it as a non full-time
student there; all my friends and
relatives that have gone there
have had a hell of a time getting a
degree," he added.
"They all hate it there," he
said. "They say it's hard to meet
people and they get no support
for pursuing their career paths."
Cantor, although she loves
Berkeley, said that Stanford
would still have been her first
choice for her undergraduate ed
ucation.
"For myself I think I needed to
feel a little more safer and feel a
little more coddled. I think that
people need that immediately out
of high school," Cantor said.
"The transition was a bit
smoother by going to Stanford,"
she said.
