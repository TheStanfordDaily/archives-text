# Grad students facing new hurdles
## For many, admission into a Stanford graduate program is just the beginning of a great adventure. 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
Graduate students comprise
the majority of the student popu
lation on the Stanford campus
during these summer months, but
from all directions, these students
are feeling the crunch of an imper
fect environment.
According to a July 26 class en
rollment report, 85 percent of the
more than 5,000 summer school
students on campus are graduate
students. The departments with
the most graduate students in
clude chemistry, physics and engi
neering. These students are com
pleting research, teaching, writ
ing their theses and taking class
es.
The sheer numbers do not indi
cate the troubles that graduate
students face en route to a perfect
academic appointment or indus
trial job. Not only have the job op
portunities for these graduate
students as instructors and assis
tant professors flagged, but recent
adjustments in student loans
have placed more of a financial
burden on students.
In addition, cuts in private and
federal funding for research are
becoming increasingly limited.
Many minority students also echo
complaints of unwelcoming grad
uate programs that the Universi
ty has sought to address through
out the years.
Although Stanford officials
have sought to address these is
sues, they have failed to find solu
tions to problems that have only
reached the beginning of their as
cent.
A stale market
A survey released in July by the
Institute for Higher Education at
Stanford and the Rand Corpora

tion of Santa Monica concluded
that graduate students in sciences
may have as low as a one in four
chance of finding permanent, full
time employment in their fields.
The study examined job oppor
tunities in 13 science and engi
neering fields, 210 institutions
with doctorate programs, and
more than 1,000 educational in
stitutions that employ people with
doctorates.
These results only confirm
what graduate students have
known all along — that job oppor
tunities are scarce, no matter
what the field. Most hope for aca
demic positions at universities
and colleges. Many who don't re
ceive those appointments turn to
jobs in industry; some eventually
change fields.
Graduate students facing the
competitive, oversaturated job
market have prepared themselves
for compromise.
James Plummer, a graduate
student in physics, is studying for
the physics qualifying exam this
summer.
He explained his plan for life
after graduate school:
"First of all, my intention is not
to go the normal job track. I want
to go into the space program, al
though that's getting cut too. Sec
ondly, I already know people who
are willing to hire me as a postdoc.
And thirdly, I'm very open-mind
ed about going into different
fields."
Some cling to the hope of find
ing great jobs by taking postdoc
toral positions offering experience
and research opportunities at low
wages. These temporary positions
become holding grounds for aspir
ing professors.
"Postdocs are pretty much wel
fare for scientists," said Tim Ma
chonkin, a second-year graduate

student in chemistry. Machonkin
is continuing his research on cop
per proteins this summer.
Another option that was previ
ously available has now also be
come stifled — teaching at lesser
known institutions. "What they'll
do is take a job at some Corncob
College in Wyoming — College of
the Dirt," Plummer said.
But even the Corncob route has
reached a dead end. Machonkin
recalled a friend at his undergrad
uate school, the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor, who faced
500 other competitors for a posi
tion at North Carolina State, not
exactly the cream of the prover
bial corn crop.
Compound this with the con
cern of finding a tenure-track po
sition which, intuitively, eventu
ally leads to a tenured university
position, and the average gradu
ate student's transition from
school to the real world is obvious
ly not a smooth one.
Each student also compiles dif
ferent lists of what they value in
their future job. These wants are
not necessarily the standards of
prestige and money.
English graduate student
Manuel Martinez, ranks student
interest as a high priority in his
employment selection. With a
focus on American Modernism
and Chicano Studies, Martinez
hopes for a university job with a
large population of students inter
ested in Chicano Studies.
"So the best places for me
wouldn't necessarily be places like
Princeton, Yale or UC-Berkeley,"
he said. "They would be places like
the University of Texas or the
University of New Mexico. I want
to be at a university where I have
students that are interested in
what I'm teaching."
Martinez said that his area of

expertise was
growing
rapidly,
whereas Eng
lish majors in
Victorian Lit
erature and
the Renais
sance would
find it most
difficult to get
a job.
The
competition
for humani
ties professor
ships tops out
at about 25 to
30 applicants
for a position,
Martinez esti
mated. Com
pared to the
500 applicants
for a chem
istry job dis
cussed earlier,
it is apparent
that science
and engineer
ing are areas
that have the
greatest
amount of
overproduc
tion of doctor
al students.
The In
stitute for
Higher Learn
ing study esti
mated that

the supply of
doctorate re
cipients lor
chemistry,
physics and
mathematics
exceeds the
demand by
51.5 percent;
other results
concluded 23
percent for
geological sci
ences, 26 per
cent for
chemical en
gineer i n g
and 44 per
cent for me
chanical en
gineering.
However,
the highest
amount of
overproduc
tion is in
computer sci
ence doctoral
students,
who have a
50.3 percent
excess. (The
numbers do
not reflect
the actual
unemploy
ment rate in
these fields,
but rather an

estimate of disparity between sup
ply and demand.)
Many doctorate recipients who
are unable to find jobs turn to con
sulting to pay the bills and put
food on the table, said Plummer.
Consulting jobs are lucrative, al
though they do not allow for re
search, which is a major consider
ation to many students.
Hugh McGuire, who completed
the dissertation for his computer
science doctorate in June, said
that although he had not yet
begun his job search, there was a
definite problem in finding acade
mic jobs.
"Friends of mine have been try
ing several things, and they all end
up in the industry," he said.
He explained that the aversion
to jobs in the industry may be in
part due to the difficulty in re
turning to an academic discipline
after working in the industry:
"Once you go into industry, you
work all day and all night for
them, and ifyou want to go back to
a university job, you have to pub
lish, which you can't do if you are
working all of the time.
"You can go from academic to
industry but it's hard to go back
when it's the other way around —
so it is a significant choice you
have to make," he said.
In 1993, a survey by the Na
tional Science Foundation deter
mined that the job market had de
clined significantly since the late
1980s for science and engineering
graduates. In addition, an Ameri
can Physical Society report stated
that the unemployment rate for
doctorate recipients in physics
had jumped from 5 percent to 12
percent from 1992 to 1993.
Despite such studies, the
amount of graduates at Stanford
remains the same.
In May of this year, the Faculty
Senate Planning and Policy Board
issued a preliminary recommen
dation not to limit the number of

entering graduate students, but to
better inform them of the choices
they must make in the future.
This recommendation came in
spite of the board's research,
which concluded that the market
for doctorate recipients would not
improve significantly in the fu
ture.
If the proposal is approved in
the fall, departments would pro
vide prospective students with re
ports detailing the average time
needed to complete a degree, the
potential for funding during their
studies and the job prospects for
the future.
Some have questioned the Fac
ulty Senate's decision as catering
to the professors' wants instead of
the students' needs. Machonkin
said current students would bene
fit from fewer graduate students,
although professors may not want
to give up their graduate assis
tants.
According to Arthur Bienen
stock, associate director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and chair of the Planning and
Policy Board at the time, the
board felt that "we should not ar
bitrarily limit the opportunities of
young people who want to pursue
a Ph.D. and who are qualified. The
choice is theirs, not ours. Our job
is to inform and let them make
their own decision."
Experts propose expanding re
search funding to create more jobs
for these doctorate recipients, but
that solution does not seem likely
as the amount of research grant
money available continues to de
cline.
A lack of funding
"When you go to graduate
school you pretty much make a
commitment to living poor," Mar
tinez said.
Limiting the number of gradu
ate students may translate into
more money and better facilities
for the current students in a grad

uate program.
"You've got to wonder where
all of the money is going," said Ma
chonkin. He explained that each
professor has grant money that is
not clearly allocated and added
that the chemistry department —
although well-funded — lacks
modern facilities such as in-house
nitrogen lines, "which is unheard
of."
The proposed cuts in federal
funding toward student loans and
research grants also threaten
Stanford's graduate students.
Congress' plan to balance the bud
get, passed in June, reduces the
student loan program by $10 1 bil
lion. Specifically, the budget calls
for 1.8 million graduate students
to lose federal subsidies, which
allow them to avoid repayment
while still in school.
Furthermore, federal grant
sources like the NSF and the Na
tional Endowment for the Hu
manities, also have an uncertain
future.
Although most science pro
grams guarantee funding for stu
dents through fellowships or jobs
as teaching assistants or research
assistants, humanities students
must find other means in order to
pay for their education.
Asale Angel-Ajani, a graduate
student in anthropology focusing
on Italy and Europe, said she
avoided student loans this year
by teaching two classes this sum
mer. She served as a teaching as
sistant for Anthropology 1 spring
quarter and is teaching the class
at Stanford this summer. She
also taught a seminar for the
Irvine Program, a program for
future doctoral students which
concluded this week.
"But it worries me for public
schools and what [the funding
scarcity! means for graduate stu
dents across California," she said.
"It means they will take a longer
time to complete their educations.

They will ac
cumulate
undergradu
ate and grad
uate debts,
and a lower
number of
people may
apply to
graduate
schools."
The lack
of support
toward edu
cation has
implications
not only for
future gen
erations of
students but
also for the
future of the
nation.
"As a
nation, you
have to
maintain
your techno
logical edge,"
Plummer
said. "It's a
dangerous
thing, be
cause there
are other na
tions that
want to be in
the position

we are in. It
takes a rich nation to produce
physicists and to invest in pure
science, but it's important to have
a strong military and scientific
base."
Pure science does not have an
immediate payoff, nor do many of
the humanities and the arts. In
these areas, finding research
funding has become increasingly
difficult.
"It's a cutthroat type of a situa
tion," Angel-Ajani said. "Ifyou are
lucky, you get money from outside
sources. It gives you more status;
your work is more validated."
She elaborated on how reduc
tions in grants have affected her.
"For my study of Europe, grants
have decreased since last summer.
They have no money this summer
— if they were giving eight or 12
grants out last summer, now they
might be giving two.
"The NSF is in jeopardy be
cause of Newt Gingrich. Losing
that will be tragic for grad stu
dents," she added.
For the most part, cuts in funds
have yet to greatly affect Stanford
graduate students, who, through
fellowships and grants, maintain
the necessary funding.
These students are allotted
stipends which vary from depart
ment to department; they also
apply for grants and fellowships
for more money. In obtaining one
of these awards, persistence may
be the best advice.
"I've been denied more fellow
ships than I've received; you've
got to keep trying," advised Plum
mer.
Not so colorblind
Another major area of concern
for many graduate programs is
the lack of female and minority
students in several fields.
"My biggest problem with
physics is not the money; it's the
physicists," said Plummer, who is
black. "There are many women

and minorities that quit the pro
gram, and it's not because they are
not talented. It is oftentimes a
hostile environment for women
and minorities."
"There was a black physics
Ph.D. that graduated a few years
ago; his name was A 1 Green,"
Plummer said. "Now, there are
two black physics grad students
here today, me and this other guy
who's new. We have been called A 1
Green so many times. A 1 was
about 4'B" I'm 6'l" — the shame
of it is that they consider them
selves liberal."
Stanford's physics department
houses only 13 women out of a
total of 103 students, yet the lack
of women is not necessarily due to
a lack of talent. Plummer felt that
all of the women he encountered
were exceptionally talented and
attributed the low matriculation
rate to the uninviting attitude of
the physics field as a whole.
The problem of a lack of women
and minorities completing their
graduate degrees is one that is not
new to the academic world. The
NSF sponsored a convention
three years ago at UC-Berkeley ti
tled "The Scientific Culture:
Bringing it into Balance." They
have since renewed the $250,000
grant for fostering this balance.
In the chemistry department,
Machonkin viewed the issue as
more of a problem for underprivi
leged minorities, rather than
women. He added, however, that
"as far as women are concerned,
there isn't entirely a level playing
field. The situation has gotten
dramatically better, though."
Women make up about a third
of the chemistry graduate pro
gram, whereas Machonkin said
there was only one African-Amer
ican.
Overall, less than a third of the
total graduate enrollment at Stan
ford this summer is female, al-

though in the
humanities,
the number of
women often
exceeds the
number of
men.
Angel-
Ajani ex
pressed con
cern at the low
number of
people of color
in the gradu
ate programs
on campus.
"There
aren't enough
graduate stu
dents of color
in the human
ities," she
said. "When
you have a
population of
people of color
going to col
lege for the
first time in
their family,
let alone get
ting an ad
vanced de
gree, the per
centages
aren't
there. . . .
Generally, you
don't find peo
ple of color

here from those 'lower-name,
lower colleges.' "
Martinez agreed that minority
students generally do not make it
to graduate school.
"If you are Chicano or Latino
and lucky enough to get into an
undergraduate school, you are
going to be pushed towards a more
'practical' academic field," he
said.
In 1989, the University set a
goal to double the number of grad
uating minority doctoral stu
dents, but they failed to achieve
their goal. Targeted minority and
female graduating students in
creased by only 30 percent, leav
ing a 70 percent shortfall.
In setting the goal, Stanford ac
knowledged the disparity between
the numbers but did not provide
resources for the project. The re
port, issued in October 1994, de
termined that although there has
been solid progress towards more
minority graduate students, addi
tional measures and resources
need to be allocated toward the
cause.
Consequently, Provost Con
doleezza Rice formed the Commit
tee on the Recruitment, Retention
and Graduation of Targeted Mi
nority Graduate Students in an ef
fort to increase enrollment. Tar
geted minorities consist of African
Americans, Native Americans and
Mexican Americans / Puerto Ri
cans.
The success of such actions has
yet to be seen, but Martinez re
marked that Stanford has made a
conscious effort to balance its un
dergraduate and staff ethnically.
"At Stanford, there is a good
representation of Latinos and
Chicanos as faculty," he said. "At
my undergraduate school (St.
Mary's University of San Antonio)
there were no Latinos. I was inter
ested in working with a Latino
professor, and the department has

made good steps in acquiring peo
ple for Chicano Studies" at Stan
ford.
Martinez added, however, that
students at other schools may not
be so lucky.
"At conferences I've met a lot of
people that have no one to work
with for these degrees," he said.
Why dive into the program?
Despite numerous setbacks,
problems and difficulties, there is
something about being a Stanford
graduate student that makes it all
worthwhile.
"Stanford is a high-quality in
stitution," Bienenstock said. He
said the Policy and Planning
Board stood by the statement that
if any school is to educate gradu
ate students, it should be Stan
ford.
These students show en
durance through bumpier times
out of love for the subject that
they are studying. Few would
argue that it takes a devoted per
son to spend six long, poverty
filled years — and likely the rest of
their lives — in one field. It is this
devotion that allows them to com
promise wealth and possible fame
for what they love to do.
"If I can't find a job at a univer
sity, I could work in a community
center or I'll teach at high school,"
Angel-Ajani said.
Stanford graduate students
have found ways to provide for
themselves through grants, fel
lowships and stipends and have
made back-up plans for their fu
ture, whether changing fields or
lowering standards. But, as
products of a top research uni
versity, Stanford doctoral stu
dents may just be better
equipped to face the problems
that lie ahead.
After all, as Machonkin said,
"Everyone thinks they can make
it. Otherwise they wouldn't be
