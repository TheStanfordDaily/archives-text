## Americans say Wu tape not a real confession 
### 
U.S. officials and other supporters at
home are skeptical of what the Chinese gov
ernment claims is a confession by Hongda
Harry Wu, the Hoover Institution research
fellow and human rights activist who has
been held by Chinese authorities since June
19.
Wu was apprehended while crossing the
border between China and Kazakhstan.
Chinese authorities have accused Wu of
sneaking into China on false names, steal
ing Chinese state secrets and disseminating
those secrets outside China.
The official Xinhua News Agency report
ed July 27 that during a police interroga
tion, Wu "confessed to having deliberately
falsified the facts" in films he made with the
British Broadcasting Corp. Those films re
ported human rights abuses in the Chinese
prison-labor camps where Wu spent 19
years as a political prisoner.
A videotape of the interrogation intercut
with scenes from Wu's BBC documentaries
was sold to several Western news agencies

for $3,000.
Xinhua claimed Wu admitted intention
ally falsifying the reports, but the videotape
shows him putting much of the blame for in
accuracies on the BBC.
The BBC has stood by its reporting and
has pointed out that the tape never shows
Wu denying the main points of the reports.
U.S. officials and supporters are placing
little stock in China's claims of Wu's confes
sion.
"It appears to have been a tape which was
made by the Chinese," Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said at a July 28 Na
tional Press Club luncheon, "and I think we
can all have some understanding of the con
ditions under which such a tape might have
been made by Harry Wu. And so I think
there. . . ought to be some skepticism about
all the statements that are made on the
tape."
While the Xinhua report characterized
Wu's statement as a confession, Wu's wife,
Ching-Lee Wu, said that in the taped seg

ment, Wu discusses disagreements he had
with the documentaries' producers and
does not admit to any crime.
"He just talked about the disagreement
between him and the BBC about the editing
process," she said. "I watched the 13-
minute tape carefully. He didn't confess
anything."
Wu said her husband's appearance in the
tape was distressing.
"He looked very tired, and terrible," she
said. "He has lost a lot of weight."
"I think he must be mentally mistreat
ed," she said. "You can tell: four people
questioned him, maybe for hours, or days."
Christopher met Tuesday with Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Brunei to
discuss important matters in U.S.-Chinese
relations. State Department spokesman
David Johnson said at a press briefing yes
terday that Wu's case was one of the topics
of discussion and the meeting was construc
tive, but Christopher gained little ground in
urging Wu's return.

The State Department has also been un
successful in its requests to see Wu. The
U.S.-Chinese Consular Convention re
quires only that access to detained citizens
be granted every 30 days, but the United
States has been pressing for more frequent
access.
The Chinese government is due to grant
access again under the consular agreement
within the next few days, since the last con
tact U.S. officials had with Wu was a July 10
meeting between Wu and U.S. Consul Gen
eral Arturo Macias in Wuhan, a city in cen
tral China.
Johnson said at a July 31 press briefing
that as long as Wu is incarcerated, "it's very
difficult to envisage any circumstances"
under which Chinese President Jiang
Zemin can meet with President Clinton.
Also in question is whether Wu's incarcera
tion will prevent First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton from attending an international
women's conference in Beijing next month.
