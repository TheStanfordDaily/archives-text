# After long wait, universal ID cards become a reality
## University will have more information, control 
### 
After almost a year-long delay, the new
Stanford University ID card is making its
debut on campus. The card promises to
bring considerable benefits to its holders,
but also tighter controls.
The Registrar's Office has the formida
ble task of "carding" more than 26,000 peo
ple by Sept. 26, when the new card will go
into effect. To do so, it has first targeted
students, faculty and staff who are current
ly on campus. Their cards will be issued in
the first four weeks of the undertaking.
This week, the Registrar's Office
launched a massive mailing campaign to in
form students, faculty and staff about pro
cedures for receiving their card, as well as
its elective features. The mailing includes a
brochure entitled "The Stanford Card," a
letter and timetable.
With this strategy and the published
timetable the office hopes to avoid "a crush
when the majority of students return to
campus in mid-September," explained Eliz
abeth Hodge, assistant to the Registrar.
In addition to replacing the flimsy paper
quarterly IDs with a permanent photo ID,
the Stanford Card has much-touted option
al features. Card holders may choose the
Stanford Card Plan, "a debit-down account
with which you can purchase a variety of
goods on campus," according to the
brochure.
Moreover, cardholders can elect the
Wells Fargo ATM option, enabling stu
dents who open an account with Wells
Fargo to use their card for both ATM and
ID purposes.
Many holders may find it convenient to
have an all-in-one card, while others may
choose to use the card only as an ID, said
Hodge. Wells Fargo, which in conjunction
with the Registrar's Office has set up a toll
free number so future holders may open ac
counts, has already received a number of

calls expressing interest and concern.
Some students have asked whether they
are required to open an account with Wells
Fargo, Hodge reported. Others are con
cerned about potential information ex
change between Wells Fargo and the Uni
versity.
However, "Stanford will not know any
thing about your checking account, and
Wells Fargo won't have access to your aca
demic records," Hodge said.
Nevertheless, Hodge admitted that the
card will allow the University both greater
control over access to facilities and provide
it with more information. At each ID check
point or campus commercial outlet, stu
dents will present their card and swipe it
through readers which will run an eligibili
ty check to determine the registration sta
tus of the holder.
"It will be much more automated and
convenient, but also tighter control," said
Hodge.
Not everyone is delighted at the
prospect. Physics graduate student Tim
Stowe said, "I don't know why they went
through all this trouble. It was so easy to
sneak into the gym using someone else's
ID."
The University will also know more
about "who is using what, which is not im
portant at the individual level, but will
help the University make good decisions
about resources and facilities," Hodge
added.
As for students' concerns about the dis
closure of comprehensive information,
Hodge said, "The University has a long his
tory with student records issues . . . and
will treat this information with the same
level of confidentiality as the University
treats other records."
