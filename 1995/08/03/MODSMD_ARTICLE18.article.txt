Robert S. Feigelson, who
has worked on crystal
growth and materials pro
cessing for more than 30
years, was recently awarded
the highest honor for tech
nological and experimental
achievement by the In
ternational Organization
for Crystal Growth (IOCG).

"It's sort of like a Nobel Prize in my field
without any money," said Feigelson, who
graced the cover of Science, a leading research
publication, in 1988 with his technique of
laser-guided crystal growth.
The lOCG Laudise Prize was given to
Feigelson "in recognition of his outstanding,
broad and widely acknowledged contribution

to experimental crystal growth," in particular
for work done on materials for nonlinear op
tics and superconductors.
It is given every three years by the lOCG,
which represents 3,000 researchers around
the world. This year's prize was given in the
Netherlands on June 22 and included a
framed original map of Holland made in 1684.
Feigelson received his doctorate at Stan
ford after first becoming interested in crystals
at Sperry Rand Research Center in Massa
chusetts.
"And I've been at it ever since," he said.
At Stanford, Feigelson started in the Cen
ter for Materials Research, a crystal growth
laboratory which he continues to direct today.
It is now one of the most prominent crystal
growth facilities based in a university in the
United States.
