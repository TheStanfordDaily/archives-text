# Petition may curb planned Stanford mall expansion
## 
### 
The Stanford Shopping Center
may need to erase some of its blue
prints for expansion, if a petition
submitted by a group of concerned
Palo Alto residents is adopted by
the Palo Alto City Council on Mon
day night.
The initiative-petition, which
was submitted to the City Council
July 14 by the Citizens for Affirma
tive Planning, concerns the growth
of nonresidential areas in Palo Alto
and may hold critical implications
for a proposed 12 percent expan
sion of the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter. Monday night's council meet
ing will decide on whether to imme
diately adopt the petition without
alteration or to put the petition on
the November ballot, said Palo Alto
City Clerk Gloria Young.
Among the items included in the

group's initiative is the retention of
a 1989 nonresidential growth limit
that allotted 65,000 square feet for
the shopping center's expansion. In
the six years since, approximately
16,000 square feet of that allot
ment have been utilized.
The proposal for the additional
12 percent expansion in the square
footage designated for the shop
ping center's development came
last November as part of the Sand
Hill Road Projects. According to
Andrew Coe, director of communi
ty relations for Stanford, the pro
posed expansion would increase
the development allotment to
160,000 square feet, which in
cludes 45,000 square feet allotted
in 1989 but not yet utilized.
But some Palo Alto residents ex
pressed concern about the implica

tions of increased commercial de
velopment. The petition grew out
of concern that excessive growth
will amplify traffic congestion and
further tip the jobs-housing imbal
ance, said Emily Renzel, a spokes
woman for the citizens' group and a
former member of the City Coun
cil.
"We think that's too much
system we
have," Renzel said.
Creating jobs where a housing
shortage already exists will "in
crease commuter traffic, she added.
If growth limits are raised above
those adopted in 1989, Palo Alto
will need "more major improve
ments just to keep the traffic flow
ing," she said.
The citizens' group aims to
"reaffirm present growth limits in

nonresidential zones," Renzel said.
Their proposed initiative would
forbid rezoning residential land,
halve the allowable square footage
of buildings in the California-Cam
bridge Avenue Business District
and retain growth limits adopted in
1989.
The University is currently re
viewing the initiative and is "trying
to analyze its effects on Stanford,"
Coe said.
The Sand Hill Projects are cur
rently in the midst of the Envi
ronmental Impact Report con
ducted by the City of Palo Alto.
The City Council will rule on the
proposals after results are re
leased in 1996.
The citizens' group decided to
submit the initiative before it be
comes too hard for the City Council

to "do a U-turn" as it considers ele
ments of a draft comprehensive
plan, Renzel said.
"In general, I think it seems pre
mature to submit an initiative
when the city is in the middle of re
viewing its comprehensive plan,"
Coe said.
"We've been hoping the council
would take the bull by the horns,
but they've been ambivalent at
best," Renzel said. She added, how
ever, that "they've been receptive
enough to keep proposals alive in
the earlier stages and currently."
To foster its economic growth,
Palo Alto "has become more recep
tive to concerns of the business sec
tor" in the past eight to 10 years,
according to Ken Schreiber, the
city's director of planning.
