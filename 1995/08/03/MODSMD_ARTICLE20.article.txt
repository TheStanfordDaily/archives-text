# Over what?
## Newsweek story puzzles one honoree 
### 
In the '80s they were called
yuppies, and in now in the '90s
they are members of the "over
class" — that's the term used by
Newsweek magazine in their
July 31 issue to describe the
ir r oup in which it places 100
members of "a new American
elite."
And among those picked were
Stanford Provost Condoleezza
Rice, Economics Prof. Paul
Krugman and Hoover Institu
tion Research Fellow Shelby
Steele. Krugman was puzzled by
the distinction.
"I don't know what it means
to be on this list," Krugman said.
"I think it's silly."
Members of the list span a
wide array of fields, such as acad
emia, business, entertainment,
law, politics and sports. Ranging

from basketball superstar Grant
Hill to Vice President A 1 Gore,
the list includes some of Ameri
ca's richest, most influential and
most educated people.
According to Newsweek, the
group is marked by their wealth
and their espousal of the "ideolo
gy of merit." As the '90s version
of the yuppies, "they lead a dis
tinctive lifestyle, yuppie tastes
updated," according to the maga
zine.
However, the list and its in
tent seemed to baffle at least one
of its members. Krugman said he
doesn't recognize himself in
Newsweek's characterization of
the "overclass" and feels that he
"could have done without it."
"I hope it doesn't describe
me," he said.
