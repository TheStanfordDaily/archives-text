In the ever-changing world of managed health care,
Stanford Health Services and the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation (PAMF) have found a way to achieve some
long-term stability by signing a five-year agreement.
Under the new agreement, PAMF, which has only
outpatient services, will agree to continue its long
standing practice of sending the majority of its man
aged care patients to Stanford Hospital. Approximate
ly 50 percent of the foundation's patients belong to
managed-care plans, according to PAMF Public Af
fairs Director Jay Thorwaldson. The agreement also
deals with how the managed-care dollars will be dis
tributed.
"The importance of this agreement is that it signi
fies our close relationship with the Palo Alto Clinic,"
said Peter Van Etten, chief executive officer of Stan
ford Health Services.
According to Van Etten, the agreement was made
in part because of the fact that the two organizations,
which had enjoyed a close relationship since the 19505,
seemed to be growing apart in recent years.
The agreement is part of broader discussions be
tween the foundation and Stanford Health Services to
create a joint network to provide primary care. Last
October, the two organizations signed a letter of intent

to form the joint network along with Sutter Health, an
organization of which PAMF is an affiliate.
Stanford and the foundation are also discussing
plans to create a community-based health and well
ness research center on the foundation s campus
sometime in the near future. The proposed center
would serve as an education and research point in the
community, and there is a strong likelihood that the
Center for Disease Prevention at Stanford would be lo
cated there, said Dr. David Drucker, PAMF's chief op
erating officer.
The closer ties between the foundation and the Uni
versity are indicative of the growing need to provide ef
ficient care at lower costs, Thorwaldson said. They
also allow the two groups to plan for the future.
"Health care is going through some revolutionary
changes, and this gives us one plank of stability for the
future, knowing that we'll be there for Stanford and
Stanford will be there for us," said Thorwaldson.
While the new agreement won't affect Stanford stu
dents, it will bring peace of mind to faculty who see
PAMF physicians under managed-care health plans.
"The relationship will be maintained so as to pro
vide them with the best care possible," Van Etten said.
