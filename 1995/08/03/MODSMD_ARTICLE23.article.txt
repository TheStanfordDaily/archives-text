Great expectations.
More than just a Dickens novel, it is a
title applied to everything at Stanford, in
cluding the men's water polo team.
The Cardinal has won the NCAA Na
tional Championship two years in a row,
and the expectation is that the squad will
take home its third straight in the 1995
season.
Stanford most likely will be ranked No.
1 in the nation with a team talented in all
aspects.
"We should have the best offensive at
tack in the country," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "We have many people who
can score, with three left-handers and
three right-handers in the starting lineup.
We have an excellent defense, outstanding
goaltending and excellent depth. We have
no weaknesses."
Three All-Americans return to the
Farm, including Jeremy Laster and Brian
Wall in. Laster, the second leading scorer
last year as a junior, is considered to be an
excellent shooter and defender and was co-
MVP at the 1994 NCAA tournament. He
won the Block "S" Outstanding Male Ju
nior Athlete at Stanford after scoring 55
points, including a nation-high 18 2-point-

ers.
Wallin is a junior and will
take over the vacancy left by
the graduation of Ail-Ameri
can Frank Schneider. Wallin
scored 48 points last season,
fourth highest on the team,
and will be the primary cen
ter-forward.
Goalie Jack Bowen is the
other returning Ail-Ameri
can. A first-teamer, Bowen
was a co-MVP at last year's
tournament and spent his
summer training with the
U.S. National "A" team as the

only collegiate goalie training with the
team.
Other projected starters are Dan
Lehoczky, Josh Leachman, Dan Hancock
and Brian Pyle. Lehoczky, a junior, hails
from Budapest, Hungary and was a mem
ber of the Hungarian National Youth
team. Leachman scored 30 points last year,
one fewer than Lehoczky, and was a mem
ber of the U.S. Junior National team, as
was Hancock. Hancock moved into the
starting lineup midway through last sea
son and finished with 25 points.
Six new players will enter the Cardinal
program this year; four were high school
All-Americans last year. Those expected to

make a major impact are Arturo Rodelo, a
freshman from Mexico City, and Peter Os
borne, who is moving across the street to
Stanford from Palo Alto High School.
This year's schedule culminates in the
NCAA Championship, which will use a dif
ferent format from last year. Four teams
will qualify for the tournament, down from
eight. Two teams will be selected from the
Western United States, one from Division
II and one from the East. The winner of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tour
nament, in which Stanford is expected to
participate, will gain an automatic berth in
the NCAA tournament. This year's edition
will be held Dec. 1 and 3 at Stanford.
