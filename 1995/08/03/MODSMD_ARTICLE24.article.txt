# Absurd moments in sports; do sports decrease smarts?

### 
I MISS "WILBUR Hall." Not the building
but the comic strip. Those of you who read
The Daily a couple years ago might re
member the comic. I really liked it. In fact, it
was one of the few things I consistently read
every day.
No other cartoon, in my opinion, has been
able to capture the American-Asian angst as
well as it did. In addition, Wilbur Hall was able
to intertwine that angst with the Stanford ex
perience in a way no other comic strip has
been able to, before or after.
That should be no surprise; there are only
a few other Asian characters in cartoons that
I know of, Wicky in "Jump Start" and the
racist portrayal of a Japanese guy in "Beetle
Bailey." As far as I know, no one else has been
able to capture the endless comical facets of
Stanford University.
People at Stanford take themselves too se
riously.
Also, the "Taco Bell" architecture is really
annoying. I'm hoping that the next major
earthquake destroys every building and Stan
ford acquires good taste when it is forced to re
build.
By the way, is Taco Hell ever coming to
Tresidder?
Another place that needs to take itself less
seriously is the greater metropolitan Lansing
area.
Recently, Lansing, which basically is my
home town, achieved national prominence
when the not-yet-in-existence Lansing
Lugnuts™ minor-league team was mentioned
in Sports Illustrated.
Of course, someone writes to SI and

whines about the name, as the town has been
doing so ever since "Lugnuts" was leaked to
the public. Lansingites have even gone so far
as to exhibit Grand Rapids envy by comparing
"Lugnuts" to "Whitecaps," the nickname of
the West Michigan team (which is located in
Grand Rapids).
Lansing mayor David Hollister, rightfully
so, has told the town to get a life and lighten up.
My personal theory is that Lansing is jeal-

ous of the attention Grand
Rapids, that cesspool, has
received ever since they
broke the full-season single-
A league attendance mark
or because they became the
home office of the Top Ten
List.
I've been to Grand
Rapids many a time, and I
can say that I've never seen
a whitecap anywhere near

there. Lake Michigan really doesn't have
waves.
As a side note, the rest of America seems to
be mildly enthusiastic about the name. I've
been told that on the Giants' TV broadcast,
the announcers wore Lugnut hats and men
tioned that they like the name.
As the No. 1 Lugnut fan in California, and
possibly the country (I wear the hat and I have
a T-shirt), I'm glad the name is catching on.
Minor league baseball is supposed to be fun
and irreverent. It's just a game; it's not a life
or-death situation. Enjoy it.
Speaking of enjoying sports, I'm overjoyed
to see Monica Seles back. It's been too long

since she was forced to leave tennis.
Seles, as most of you know, was the top
ranked women's tennis player in the world
when she was stabbed by a deranged man.
Her absence was marked by controversy,
which is unfortunate.
Her clothing company threatened to sue
her for taking time off from the game, and her
attacker, Gunther Parche, was convicted but
given only probation. In addition, those who
profited from her absence, most of the top
women tennis players, complained about the
co-No. 1 ranking Seles will be granted on her
return.
The absurdity of the situation has been
well documented, and I'll try to stay out of the
fray.
I will say that I used to make fun of Seles'
distinctive grunt by threatening to turn off
the sound whenever I watched her matches.
However, during the 27-month period when I
couldn't hear that grunt, there was a definite
void in the sporting world.
Why do people not realize how great some
thing is until it's gone?
I'm afraid that the NBA players are soon
going to suffer the same lesson the tennis
world learned from Seles' departure.
The NBA is currently in a labor dispute,
much like Major League Baseball was last
year. And to add to the situation, some play
ers, Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing in
cluded, are threatening to decertify the play
er's union.
Yes, this is the same Michael Jordan that
sat out spring-training games in accordance
with the Major League Baseball Players Asso

ciation's wishes.
I'm unclear about the basketball players'
gripes with their union, but I suspect that the
players' agents are the main forces behind the
move to decertify.
If the union is broken up, then forget about
watching basketball for a good portion, or
maybe all, of this season.
Greed and stupidity reign.
Mention those words, and baseball springs
to the mind. With animosity still lingering on
the heels of the strike, there has been a spate of
"interactions" between the players and fans.
1 guess Charles Barkley and Vernon
Maxwell can relate to what the baseball play
ers are feeling.
To list a few incidents, Mo Vaughn suffered
a black eye when he "protected his woman" in
a bar. Jack McDowell flipped Yankee fans the
bird, and Roberto Alomar's life was threat
ened by a stalking woman fan with a gun.
To top it off, just a few days ago, a scout for
the Baltimore Orioles got into a fight with
drunken "fans" at a game. One day later, Chili
Davis slapped someone who he thought was
heckling him with racist epithets during a
game. It turns out that he hit the wrong fan
and those who were taunting Davis were a few
seats away.
Aren't sports wonderful?
