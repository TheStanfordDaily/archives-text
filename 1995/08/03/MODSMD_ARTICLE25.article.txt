## It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing: Jazz great Ray Brown comes to the Farm 
### Stewart Maclennan 
a heck out Ray Brown. Just a hand
ful of notes played with his rich,
percussive tone and his unflagging
sense of swing certainly won't convey the
fact that at 69, Brown is one of the oldest
jazz bassists alive, but there's no doubt his
buoyant playing will instantly tell you that
he is a musician of monumental ability.
Today he remains one of the most her
alded bassists in jazz history. But don't take
my word for it; hear him yourself Monday
night when he performs with his trio, in
cluding pianist Benny Green, at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. One of the highlights of the
Stanford Jazz Workshop's Five-Star Mas
ters Series, Brown will also be playing with
Grammy Award-winning tenor saxophonist
Joe Henderson on Wednesday evening.
Born in Pittsburgh in 1926, Brown first
remembers hearing jazz on the radio at
home. "I started out playing the piano and
began listening to Fats Waller, whom my
dad really liked."
At six, Brown saw a jazz concert at a local
theater and decided then that he wanted to
devote himself to music.
I asked Brown when he got his first big
break.
"To musicians in those days, your first
'break' came when you got your first job; for
me, that was when I was hired by Jimmy
Hensley to play in his group," he said.
Since that first gig, Brown hasn't looked
back. He moved to New York in 1945 and
instantly made his mark on the jazz scene
when he was hired without an audition by
Dizzy Gillespie for his band, which includ
ed Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and Max
Roach.
In the late '40s and early '50s, Brown
helped found the Modern Jazz Quartet and
toured extensively with jazz diva Ella
Fitzgerald, then his wife. The bassist made
his most lasting contribution to jazz when
he teamed up with pianist Oscar Peterson
and guitarist Herb Ellis, forming a power
house of a trio which many feel hasn't been
surpassed since. After working with Peter
son for 16 years, Brown continued to per
form and record with the best in jazz, win
ning a Grammy in 1963 for his composition
"The Gravy Waltz" with Steve Allen.
"I've always enjoyed playing music, and
I've been really fortunate to play with great
musicians for all of 50 years," said Brown.
What would it be like to have played with
Count Basie, Lester Young, Duke Ellington,
Stan Getz and Miles Davis, to name a few?
"It would be as if I asked you, 'What's it
like being married to Marilyn Monroe?'
You'd smile. What else is there to say?" he
said.
"It would be too hard to pass over any one
of the musicians that I've played with —
could you?"

Definitely not.
Norman Granz, a pioneer jazz record pro
ducer and founder of the Verve label, real
ized the musical potential when musicians
like Brown teamed up with other top-flight
jazzmen. In 1944, Granz invited many of
them to play at a live benefit at Los Angeles'
Philharmonic Hall. The historic perfor
mance became the prototype of a world-fa
mous series of concerts know as "Jazz at the
Philharmonic." Brown was a regular per
former with JATP throughout the '40s and
'50s and frequently toured in Europe.
"People in Europe are very enthusiastic
about listening to jazz; sometimes you get
the feeling as if they appreciate the music
more than in the States, but no matter
where you go the crowds are great," said
Brown.
Brown will be on hand at the Stanford
Jazz Workshop during the advanced jazz
residency camp from Aug. 6 to 12. Students
of jazz and faculty members alike will be able
to hear him perform in master classes and
discuss how he approaches jazz.
Even when Brown is playing a standard
blues, one of the most basic and traditional
vehicles of jazz, his strongly melodic base
lines have a rare quality in jazz: they lock in

tightly with the rhythm section, providing a
rock-solid foundation over which other
soloists can improvise, yet they are crafted
with such musical structure that his bass
playing always stands out with a unique,
and immediately recognizable voice.
The question on the minds of more human
musicians like those of us at the Stanford
Jazz Workshop is: How does he do it?
"You can't analyze music too much,"
Brown cautioned. "When you get up on
stage, you forget about everything else and
you play from your heart. Jazz is about get
ting the right feeling — just let it come right
out. The notes will always take care of them
selves."
Easier said than done. But if you've lis
tened to Brown you know he's being sincere.
Although he's regarded by his peers as a
supreme technician, his playing never caus
es listeners to focus on what notes or scale
he's using, as is the case with many jazz mu
sicians. Instead, you're immediately aware
of what mood he's in. After all, as Brown
says, jazz is about "intangible things."
To Brown, jazz is a music you can't plot
or predict; there are never-ending variations
to it, and he seems intent on exploring every
one. It's no wonder that he continually finds

enjoyment in his music.
"Let me make an analogy," said Brown.
"What's you favorite dessert? Raspberry
sorbet? All right, playing jazz would be as if
someone offered you raspberry sorbet every
day of the year. Would you refuse it? No
112 )'
way!
Sounds like heaven to me.
We moved away from this mouth-water
ing subject and I asked him how he liked
playing with younger stars like Benny Green
and bassist Christian Mcßride, who affec
tionately refers to Brown as "Pop."
"They're great players," said Brown. He
mentioned a recent jam session with saxo
phonist Steve Coleman, a pioneer in the
"hip-bop" style of jazz who will bring his
group, the Metrics, to Dinkelspiel as part of
the Stanford Jazz Workshop on Saturday,
Aug. 12.
Although Coleman and Brown definitely
belong to different schools of jazz, Brown
emphasizes that many of today's younger
players are very versatile.
"'We had a good time," recalls Brown. "I
think you could put Steve into any group
and he'd play what you're playing."
Brown said it's natural that jazz will con
tinue to change, bringing young players like
Coleman into the spotlight.
"You know, different people will produce
different music."
When asked if he likes everything he
hears, Brown said, "There are some things I
like better than others. Sometimes jazz can
get a little too 'free' for me."
But he insists that jazz is not changing as
much as the public thinks.
"It's a very natural process," he said,
claiming that record companies and the
media often create labels for new styles of
music which only serve to "splinter" jazz.
"Jazz is not about names — we're only
concerned with the music," he said.

Brown, I'm all for it.

a heck out Ray Brown. Just a hand
ful of notes played with his rich,
percussive tone and his unflagging
sense of swing certainly won't convey the
fact that at 69, Brown is one of the oldest
jazz bassists alive, but there's no doubt his
buoyant playing will instantly tell you that
he is a musician of monumental ability.
Today he remains one of the most her
alded bassists in jazz history. But don't take
my word for it; hear him yourself Monday
night when he performs with his trio, in
cluding pianist Benny Green, at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. One of the highlights of the
Stanford Jazz Workshop's Five-Star Mas
ters Series, Brown will also be playing with
Grammy Award-winning tenor saxophonist
Joe Henderson on Wednesday evening.
Born in Pittsburgh in 1926, Brown first
remembers hearing jazz on the radio at
home. "I started out playing the piano and
began listening to Fats Waller, whom my
dad really liked."
At six, Brown saw a jazz concert at a local
theater and decided then that he wanted to
devote himself to music.
I asked Brown when he got his first big
break.
"To musicians in those days, your first
'break' came when you got your first job; for
me, that was when I was hired by Jimmy
Hensley to play in his group," he said.
Since that first gig, Brown hasn't looked
back. He moved to New York in 1945 and
instantly made his mark on the jazz scene
when he was hired without an audition by
Dizzy Gillespie for his band, which includ
ed Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and Max
Roach.
In the late '40s and early '50s, Brown
helped found the Modern Jazz Quartet and
toured extensively with jazz diva Ella
Fitzgerald, then his wife. The bassist made
his most lasting contribution to jazz when
he teamed up with pianist Oscar Peterson
and guitarist Herb Ellis, forming a power
house of a trio which many feel hasn't been
surpassed since. After working with Peter
son for 16 years, Brown continued to per
form and record with the best in jazz, win
ning a Grammy in 1963 for his composition
"The Gravy Waltz" with Steve Allen.
"I've always enjoyed playing music, and
I've been really fortunate to play with great
musicians for all of 50 years," said Brown.
What would it be like to have played with
Count Basie, Lester Young, Duke Ellington,
Stan Getz and Miles Davis, to name a few?
"It would be as if I asked you, 'What's it
like being married to Marilyn Monroe?'
You'd smile. What else is there to say?" he
said.
"It would be too hard to pass over any one
of the musicians that I've played with —
could you?"

Definitely not.
Norman Granz, a pioneer jazz record pro
ducer and founder of the Verve label, real
ized the musical potential when musicians
like Brown teamed up with other top-flight
jazzmen. In 1944, Granz invited many of
them to play at a live benefit at Los Angeles'
Philharmonic Hall. The historic perfor
mance became the prototype of a world-fa
mous series of concerts know as "Jazz at the
Philharmonic." Brown was a regular per
former with JATP throughout the '40s and
'50s and frequently toured in Europe.
"People in Europe are very enthusiastic
about listening to jazz; sometimes you get
the feeling as if they appreciate the music
more than in the States, but no matter
where you go the crowds are great," said
Brown.
Brown will be on hand at the Stanford
Jazz Workshop during the advanced jazz
residency camp from Aug. 6 to 12. Students
of jazz and faculty members alike will be able
to hear him perform in master classes and
discuss how he approaches jazz.
Even when Brown is playing a standard
blues, one of the most basic and traditional
vehicles of jazz, his strongly melodic base
lines have a rare quality in jazz: they lock in

tightly with the rhythm section, providing a
rock-solid foundation over which other
soloists can improvise, yet they are crafted
with such musical structure that his bass
playing always stands out with a unique,
and immediately recognizable voice.
The question on the minds of more human
musicians like those of us at the Stanford
Jazz Workshop is: How does he do it?
"You can't analyze music too much,"
Brown cautioned. "When you get up on
stage, you forget about everything else and
you play from your heart. Jazz is about get
ting the right feeling — just let it come right
out. The notes will always take care of them
selves."
Easier said than done. But if you've lis
tened to Brown you know he's being sincere.
Although he's regarded by his peers as a
supreme technician, his playing never caus
es listeners to focus on what notes or scale
he's using, as is the case with many jazz mu
sicians. Instead, you're immediately aware
of what mood he's in. After all, as Brown
says, jazz is about "intangible things."
To Brown, jazz is a music you can't plot
or predict; there are never-ending variations
to it, and he seems intent on exploring every
one. It's no wonder that he continually finds

enjoyment in his music.
"Let me make an analogy," said Brown.
"What's you favorite dessert? Raspberry
sorbet? All right, playing jazz would be as if
someone offered you raspberry sorbet every
day of the year. Would you refuse it? No
112 )'
way!
Sounds like heaven to me.
We moved away from this mouth-water
ing subject and I asked him how he liked
playing with younger stars like Benny Green
and bassist Christian Mcßride, who affec
tionately refers to Brown as "Pop."
"They're great players," said Brown. He
mentioned a recent jam session with saxo
phonist Steve Coleman, a pioneer in the
"hip-bop" style of jazz who will bring his
group, the Metrics, to Dinkelspiel as part of
the Stanford Jazz Workshop on Saturday,
Aug. 12.
Although Coleman and Brown definitely
belong to different schools of jazz, Brown
emphasizes that many of today's younger
players are very versatile.
"'We had a good time," recalls Brown. "I
think you could put Steve into any group
and he'd play what you're playing."
Brown said it's natural that jazz will con
tinue to change, bringing young players like
Coleman into the spotlight.
"You know, different people will produce
different music."
When asked if he likes everything he
hears, Brown said, "There are some things I
like better than others. Sometimes jazz can
get a little too 'free' for me."
But he insists that jazz is not changing as
much as the public thinks.
"It's a very natural process," he said,
claiming that record companies and the
media often create labels for new styles of
music which only serve to "splinter" jazz.
"Jazz is not about names — we're only
concerned with the music," he said.
When it comes to musicians like Ray
Brown, I'm all for it.
