Kids

Larry Clark's "Kids" is, unsur
prisingly, embroiled in controversy <
for its frank depiction of teen drug
use, sex and violence. With all the

hype anticipating the film, and the recent
flap over the film's NC-17 rating (distribu
tors have opted to release it unrated),
"Kids" is sure to attract a lot of attention in
the theaters. Viewers expecting highbrow
porn will be disappointed, but others will
find "Kids" a serious and engaging though
perhaps overanticipated film.
"Kids" presents a day in the life of New
York City street kids, focusing on Telly (Leo
Fitzpatrick) and Casper (Justin Pierce), a
humorously aimless but terrifying pair —
Beavis and Butt-head meet Lyle and Erik
Menendez. The film begins with Telly doing
what he does best — locking lips with a
young (obviously too young) girl in her bed
room, then talking her out of her virginity.
Telly's penchant and talent for seducing
virgins becomes even more menacing when

we learn that he is infected with HIV.
Jenny (Chloe Sevigny), whose only sexu
al encounter was with Telly, discovers that
she has the virus and races off to find him.
Meanwhile, Telly has already set his sights
on his next target, 13-year-old Darcy (Yaki
ra Peguero), and he goes off with Casper on
a tour of New York youth subculture. Along
the way, they steal cash and malt liquor,
consume blunts and whip-its and sneak an
evening dip in a closed swimming pool.
Like Clark's photography, the film por
trays street life with stark, often brutal
honesty, without offering any moral judg
ments or prescriptions. Washington Square
whiz-kid Harmony Korine's script comple
ments Clark's style well; it is simplistic and
wonderfully spare. Though the film stum
bles occasionally, lingering too long over ob
vious moments, it always picks itself back
up.
Clark is also backed up by strong perfor
mances — or perhaps just authentic non
performances — by the film's nonprofes
sional cast. Music by sometime Sebadoh
frontman Lou Barlow punctuates the in

tensity.
Some of the film's strongest moments
contribute more to scene than to plot devel
opment: a subway accordionist's creepy,
unearthly rendering of "Danny Boy"; a roll
by by a legless man on a skateboard repeat
ing his chant, "I have no legs"; a brutal
beating in the park.
The film's ending, a series of encounters
at a decadent party, is uncomfortably irres
olute. Clark and Korine offer no closure to
the events of the preceding 24 hours, just a
vague moment of contrition that the audi-

ence knows is
only too fleet
ing.
All told,
"Kids" doesn't
quite live up to
the hype, but
that's an unfair
demand to make
of what can only
be called an out
standing film.
