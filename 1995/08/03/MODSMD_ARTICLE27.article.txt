# She Loves Me: Local theater group romances the stage
## 
### Eric Hsu 
Musicals are, as a general rule, a
dicey lot. Foremost is that nasty
genre condition they tend to suffer
from, always limited to the "romantic com
edy" or "sentimental romance." They can
be a bit like a case of recurring nasal drip.
But the Peninsula-based Theatre Works'
new production of the recently revived
"She Loves Me" is hugely enjoyable. Even
the most guarded audience members will
find themselves charmed by it's unassum
ing wit and style.

The musical is a collaboration of three
artists: Jerry Bock (music), Sheldon Har
nick (lyrics) and Joe Masteroff (book). Bock
and Harnick have written the scores for nu
merous musicals, including "Fiorello" and
"Fiddler on the Roof." Masteroff is perhaps
best known for his later book-turned-musi
cal, "Cabaret".
Besides all the basic ingredients of a
good musical stew — syncopation, clever
rhymes, the "goofy yet adorable" guy —
"She Loves Me" possesses that little dash of
restraint, or maybe just enough reckless
ness, to make up something naturally good,
not merely "feel-good."
The ambience of the Lucie Stern The-

ater sets an under
stated tone for the
evening. It has a
comfortable, play
house feel, a far cry
from the tawdry af
fairs of the big city.
As a practical result,
almost all of the
seats are good. And
they don't squeak.
The main action
of "She Loves Me"
takes place in a
quaint perfume
shop somewhere in
mid-1930s Bu
dapest. The plot is a
gimme. Two clerks,
Amalia Balash and
Georg Nowack, an
tagonize each other
daily, not knowing
they are passionate
pen pals deeply in
love with each
other's literary
selves.
The leads, played
by Mandy Munnell
as Amalia and Jack
Davis as Georg,
struggled with their
parts early in the
show. Line delivery
occasionally paled
against the desired
effect, and their
character grasp
seemed uncertain,

hedging between a genuine lead and mere
ly a supporting role. Neither actor possess
es the kind of stand-out vocal or stage pres
ence which would have guaranteed instant
success to the parts as written.
They did, however, manage to grow into
their roles with surprising agility. Georg,
the first to discover the identity of his pen
pal, plays up the tenderness, insecurity
and restlessness which are the burdens of a
helpless observer. His part was also
marked by occasional streaks of fiery love
and anger. One such outburst, the title
song "She Loves Me," is cautiously offered
at first but carries the understanding of a
mature actor.
Amalia's character, the reactive and
unwitting love object, is understandably
less interesting. Yet Munnell manages to
post some vocal numbers of note, includ
ing "Mr. Nowack, Will You Please" and
"Where's my Shoe?", absorbing perfor
mances wherein she finally expresses her
personality. In the case of both leads, the
combination of their hard work and Bock
and Harnick's discriminating lyrics
eventually gained them the audience's
favor.
Just as the whole thing begins to flag
near the end of the first act, the directors
pull out an episode which should go down
as one of the most perversely sophisticated
and well-choreographed non-sequiturs in
musical history.
Step into Cafe Imperiale, a candlelit es
tablishment done up in rich brocade drap
ery — emerald — where the heights of fris
son collide with the depths of kitsch. Be
tween incognito couples done up in drag,
long-stemmed cigarettes, and an assort
ment of masked opera phantoms, a well
oiled couple tangos solemnly across the
floor to the music of gypsy violins. Mean
while, a headwaiter and busboy engage in
the reckless number "A Romantic Atmos
phere," which blends inexplicably with the
weirdness of the rest. The influence of
some of the darker colors of Masteroff s
"Cabaret" can be felt here, a wild edginess
which should bring the audience to their
own seat edges.
Although the story of "She Loves Me"
follows Amalia and Georg's duplicitous ro
mance, the real heart of the show lies in the
capering of the other clerks who work in
the Parfumerie.

One of the most memorable contribu
tions from the outstanding supporting cast
is the character Kodaly (Clark Sterling), an
ostentatious but irresistible dandy whose
scandalous affairs thread intrigue
throughout the play His finale comes out
in a shameless display of grandstanding,
"Grand Knowing You," with unforgettable
coat technique and a clear understanding
of the difficult "sidle" movement used in
wooing women.
Other winning solo performances in
clude the virtue parable "Try Me" sung by
delivery boy Arpaud (Patrick Dukeman),
lovelorn Ilona Ritter (Meg Mackay) in "A
Trip to the Library", and Ladislav the clerk
(Patrick Flick) singing "Perspective."
Bock and Harnick's score is not the
bold, innovative stuff of their earlier col
laboration, "Fiddler on the Roof, al
though Bock includes some gorgeous solo
violin passages. (Don't fret, the principal
violinist of the orchestra is more than up to
snuff.) While the songs themselves are ca
pable, they are still only conventional.
The production's zing springs from the
way meaty characters find expression in
razor-sharp dialogue and entertaining
monologue. A good example of Harnick's
considerable skill is the fugue-like "Sounds
While Selling", a piece made up of synchro
nized snatches from six different conversa
tions. How many lyricists can get away
with using "genuflection" and "solvent" in
the same light opera?
If it's true what they say, that the ap
peal of musicals lies in their improbable
but infectious idealism, "She Loves Me"
exploits that appeal well. Watching the
show is an odd but enjoyable combination
of self-deception and self-indulgence. If
you're not careful, you may find yourself
smiling at it.
