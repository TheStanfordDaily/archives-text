Waterworld

After all the fish and sea
metaphors, after all the bashing of Holly
wood's most expensive fiasco, after the
bickering between director Kevin Reynolds
and star Kevin Costner, viewers should
watch "Waterworld" without any expecta
tion. It really isn't that bad.
As a summertime action flick, "Water
world" provides an exciting adventure with
a unique setting. As a $175 million invest
ment and a science-fiction parable, though,
"Waterworld" sinks.
Starring Costner, Dennis Hopper,
Jeanne Tripplehorn and Tina Majorino,
"Waterworld" takes place in the future,
after the polar ice caps have melted, cover
ing the Earth in unending sea. As the
Mariner, Costner is an outcast mutation
with gills to breathe underwater, webbed
feet to outdistance opponents and a tri
maran that is out of sight.
After a piss-poor opening scene showing
Costner recycling his urine, the movie hits
hard with incredible action scenes worthy
of all the special costs. The Mariner sails
into a floating village that is attacked by
"Smokers," goons on gasoline jet-skis led by
the maniacal Deacon (Hopper). Water-ski
ing and powerboating take on whole new
meanings as different methods to lay siege
upon a watery castle.
Costner plays an at-first interesting SOB
who tacitly fights for his own survival. He's
a silent, independent hero who supposedly
learns to love by the end of the movie.
Hopper is surprisingly funny (don't take
him seriously) as a crackpot demagogue
atop the Exxon Valdezish Smoker fortress.
Also commanding kudos is the 10-year-old
Majorino, who steals several scenes with de
lightful bravado. OnlyTripplehorn, playing
Helen, is left in skimpy shipwrecked outfits

to play the standard damsel who is almost
helpless in distress.
The problem with "Waterworld" is
twofold. The script wasn't even finished be
fore the shooting began, leaving too many
plausibility holes and plot inconsistencies.
The bickering between star and director
gave the movie a mixed-up feel. "Water
world" switches from a serious post-apoca
lyptic action drama a la "Mad Max" to an ac
tion comedy with Hopper as the "don't just
stand there, kill something" lunatic villain
of the "True Lies" genre.
"Nothing is free in Waterworld," says
the Mariner. For viewers, $7 on the big
screen doesn't disappoint anyone looking
for two and a half hours to spend laughing
on the edge of their seats. Take this movie
with a bit of humor.
However, anyone looking for more might
want to wait for the movie to hit the dry
land of the video store.

Party Girl

As soon as the opening
credits roll, you know this art-house flick
will tickle your Fendi fetish, your funk fixa
tion and (if neither of these two apply) at
least your funny bone. As soon as the fruit
striped fonts do the cha-cha on screen to
technoid syncopation, you know "Party
Girl" will not be a soporific, dull, melodra
matic, sluggish film that would feature, let's
say, Joan Plowright.
Instead, this flick features Parker Posey as
Mary, a doe-eyed femme vitale who has a pen
chant for Gaultier and the ability to sashay
effortlessly in 5-inch platforms. She is a can
dyflipped 24-year-old who works "freelance,"
arranging warehouse parties that not only
attract hipsters, pranksters and voguesters
but also the cops who bust the party and strip
Mary of her much-needed earnings.
Desperate for moolah, Mary approaches
her librarian godmother for yet another in a
series of "loans." Instead of receiving anoth
er wad of green, Mary gets a job opportuni
ty. She starts working as a clerk at her god
mother's library.
Initially, Mary greets the Dewey Decimal
System with tedium, listlessness and com
parisons to the Sisyphean ordeal (especially
when she is ordered to label 20 copies of
"The Myth of Sisyphus" before stacking
them). But here comes the lapel-gripper;
Mary begins to feel guilty for being such a
defunct library clerk: "Even Keith Richards
would be a better librarian than me!" Mary
then realizes that she needs a vocation, that
"freelance" work just doesn't cut it, and that
library science is indeed her Buddha.
As Mary, Parker Posey fares well as an in
your-face sprite. She successfully portrays
the brazen party girl as she overarticulates
her sassy retorts and glows in her day-glo
tights. Posey is particularly charming when,

stomping through library stacks in leopard -
spotted platform wedgies, she pleads to be
taken seriously as a Dewey Decimal groupie.
It is unfortunate that the script fails to
emphasize the outrageous and quirky possi
bilities in her character, as was done to Holly
Golightly in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." As a
result of the screenplay's neglect, Mary just
ain't as memorable as Holly . . . and "Party
Girl" just ain't as memorable as "Breakfast."
"Party Girl" is a cocktail that can give you
the pleasant cinemaniacal buzz you paid
seven bucks for. But, alas, it's a flick without
adequate resonance. So don't expect a hang
over.
