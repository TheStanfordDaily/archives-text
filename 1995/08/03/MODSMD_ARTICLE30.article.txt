Live 105
Noisy Neighbors

Bay Area listeners have come to
expect one thing if any from San Francisco
radio station Live 105: homogeneous
grunge. This makes the surprising variety
and depth of their newest compilation,
"Noisy Neighbors," all the more pleasing.
With this second local band CD, Live 105
provides a colorful glimpse into the diver
sity and dynamics of the Bay Area music
scene.
The disc features both pleasing and
lame songs, but with a grand total of 19

Tripping Daisy

/ am an Elastic
Firecracker

There's a fine line between a generic
knockoff and an exciting new act that recy
cles old sounds into something fresh — and
Tripping Daisy straddles it.
Along with up-and-coming bands like
Veruca Salt and Elastica, this Dallas quar

bands represented, there's bound to be
something to suit almost anyone's liking.
Special points of interest include: D.
Tox's "Ghosts of Ecstasy," a thrashy bit of
dance noise reminiscent of Jesus Jones'
later work. Devotees of Nine Inch Nails
are sure to enjoy D. Tox's harder synth
edge. The Brian Jonestown Massacre
holds the folksy place on the compilation.
If R.E.M. did a rendition of "Scarborough
Fair," it just might sound like this. With
pleasant, soothing vocals over chiming
bells and trumpets, the beat makes the
song sound like an old Western theme.
Bloody Mary's "Over the Edge" = Alice
in Chains. A refreshing departure from the

tet struggles to forge its own identity out of
others.' Think of Tripping Daisy's latest
album, "I Am an Elastic Firecracker," as
"Ritual de lo Habitual" remade by some
thing that is a crossbreed of Green Day's
hyper punk and the ambitious psychedelia
of Smashing Pumpkins.
The band's alt-rock hit "I Got a Girl"
typifies the sort of mixed reaction Tripping
Daisy elicits. On first listen, it seems like a
silly song with half-baked lyrics annoying
ly delivered by whiny singer Tim DeLaugh
ter, whose sometimes grating voice hap
pens to be the closest thing the group has to

mix's heavy grunge content is Jimmy Two
Times' ska number "Swank." The sound is
endlessly jangly but fun, a great introduc
tion to ska for those with little back
ground.
On the lighter side is Bernice With
Vegas de Milo, with "That Asshole Bob."
The track is rampant with catchy lyrics
like "Dump that asshole Bob so I can be
with you" over a mellow rock sound. With
such a cool name, it can be hoped that it's
actually a decent band, but "That Asshole
Bob" may be little more than a clever tune.
Perhaps the best song is "Witness" by
Emerald Transmission, a lovely melodic
track that would be thoroughly at home on

a signature sound. The chorus of "I feel
we're going higher and higher" is that
something familiar that you can't quite
pinpoint; same with the roaring guitar
work, though "Nevermind" seems like a
close relative. Yet Tripping Daisy's ram
bunctious melody and energy go a long
way, setting an insistent tone that grows
more attractive with each listen despite
whatever reservations. In short, it's a radio
single that is more interesting than most
formulaic hits.
Much of the album is as fleeting as it is
accessible; however, only a few cuts compel

a more technopoppy version of the Twin
Peaks soundtrack. Emerald Transmis
sion's style is quite unique, and their calm
but pulsing atmospheric sound alone makes
the whole collection worth checking out.
Chock full of such interesting sounds
and styles, "Noisy Neighbors" is a great
way to support local music from the safety
of your own home. No longer will you have
to walk into an unknown club with crossed
fingers in search of new music. Proceeds
from the CD go to the Wilderness Society,
so take advantage of this opportunity to
support a variety of good causes and broad
en your musical horizons.

To give Tripping Daisy its due, "Elastic
Firecracker" is not without its striking mo
ments. "Trip Along" patiently gets to the
point and takes off when it does, the vocals
and the guitars climbing with the daydream
lyrics. The next track, "Raindrop," keeps the
momentum going, pushing forward with
pretty melodies and jumpy rhythms. Here,
Tripping Daisy crosses the line, creating
something original from the past and present
rather than merely rehashing then re-serv
ingboth.
