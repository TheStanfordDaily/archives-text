## The 						Stanford Weekly Summer conferences 
### 
Conferences are
everywhere. Every
summer, hundreds of
unfamiliar faces flood the
Stanford campus. Some
times, these faces come in the
form of high-school cheer
leaders, or on the other ex
treme, administrators of uni
versity networks. Whatever
the occasion, it always seems
that Stanford hosts a confer
ence for it.
Without a doubt, these
conferences bring variety to
the Stanford campus during
the summer. They also serve
as great money-makers for
the University. But the ques
tion that needs to be an
swered is how these confer
ences help regular Stanford
students and the Stanford
community.
If conferences do not bene
fit the overall mission of the
University, then there is no

reason to continue having
them during the summer.
While it may seem like
most conferences that are
held at Stanford are of little
or no benefit to Stanford stu
dents, there are indirect ben
efits that stem from them —
the biggest being money.
For the University, the
summer conferences are a
great profit-making enter
prise. Many of the confer
ences are able to charge ex
traordinary prices for staying
on campus, and a large per
centage of that money goes
straight back to the Universi
ty.
This means that the Uni
versity can keep tuition down
and continue its mission of
education and research.
That's why — within reason
— the University should con
tinue to host conferences on
campus.
