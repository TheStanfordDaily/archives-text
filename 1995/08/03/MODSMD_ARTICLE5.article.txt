# Beware of new IDs
## 
### 
WE 'VE WAITED AND
waited, and now
they're finally here.
Plastic universal ID cards.
With these cards, students
will be able to do anything -
buy their lunches, buy tick
ets to athletic events and, in
the future, maybe even do
their laundry. They may
never leave home without
them.
But while the Stanford
community will benefit great
ly from the new, more conve
nient cards, the cards also
present a danger to privacy.
As the universal ID as
sumes more and more uses,
the potential increases for in
vading cardholders' lives.
For example, the IDs, togeth
er with modern technology,
would make it possible to
record and analyze student
purchasing patterns for mar
keting purposes.
This potential is certainly

no reason in itself to fear the
new ID cards, especially since
the University has promised
that records associated with
the universal IDs will only be
used for purposes approved
by the Registrar. Cardhold
ers will also be able to exam
ine their records at any time.
However, the University
and the Registrar's Office
should take further steps to
protect privacy. The Regis
trar's Office should keep
cardholders constantly in
formed of exactly what infor
mation is being recorded and
how that information is
being disseminated and used
inside and outside the Uni
versity. This could be as easy
as posting up-to-date reports
on the Folio computer sys
tem. These simple precau
tions can help protect card
holders' privacy and reas
sure them that the cards pre
sent no danger.
