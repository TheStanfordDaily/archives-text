Affirmative action could be based on economics instead of race

A LLOW ME TO applaud The
L\ Stanford Weekly for its com-
A. Xprehensive coverage of the
UC Regents' recent vote on affir
mative action. This is indeed a cru
cial issue, and it merits in-depth
discussion. What I must question,
however, is the logical premise be
hind the editorial of July 27, 1995.
You say that affirmative action is
"still necessary ... to ensure that
traditionally disadvantaged groups
are allowed fair and equal opportu
nities." You then proceeded to
point out that racism still exists in
America, a situation which you
suggested necessitates the contin
ued existence of programs which
reward participants on the basis of
race or gender.
Mv question is this: is it truly
fair to say that an entire race or

gender can be "disadvantaged?"
This implies that every member of
this group somehow has little
chance of making it in life without
special assistance. While particular
races (i.e. blacks, Hispanics, Indi
ans) and women in this country do
have lower standards of living and
representation in assorted fields
than white males and Asians on
average, the key fact to remember
is that this is only on average.
There are certainly many individu
als who are exceptions to
this rule â€” not every individual
classified in a "disadvantaged"
group is worse off than all the indi
viduals in the "advantaged"
groups. Current affirmative action
policies, however, do not take this
into account.
For example, say there is a

black female who lives in Beverly
Hills whose parents are financially
well off and who attends an expen
sive private school. How "disad
vantaged" has her ethnicity and
gender made this individual? Also,
let's say there's a white male who
lives in a run-down neighborhood
in San Francisco whose parents
work for minimum wage and
whose school is infested with drugs
and violence. How "advantaged" is
he because of his skin color and
gender? If these two imaginary
people applied to Stanford, to what
degree should race be used as a cri
teria in admission? Here lies a
problem, because these two indi
viduals, the "above average" black
and the "below average" white,
don't fit neatly into the stereotypes
affirmative action assumes they

should.
What should be done? Tf the
goal of affirmative action is to help
the truly disadvantaged, it should
be applied on a basis that makes
more sense than just race or gen
der: the circumstances surround
ing specific individuals. Averages
are not absolutes, and a blanket as
large as race or gender can some
times cover individuals who don't
need it. In light of this, let's redi
rect our attention toward the cir
cumstances specific individuals are
in, employing an economic / social
affirmative action policy as op
posed to a race / gender one. This,
and not current policies, is better
suited to truly aid the downtrod
den of society.
