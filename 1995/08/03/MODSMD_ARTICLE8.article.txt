## What is worth winning? 
### 
RECENTLY, A MAN named
John Kruk retired from his
career as a professional
baseball player. This event of lit
tle, if any, significance interested
me. I am not a devout John Kruk
fan, and I don't consider baseball a
favorite sport. Nevertheless, I ap
preciate the desire to compete,
and by reading about Kruk I can
better understand a subject about
which much has already been
written and recorded — the drive
to win.
When I think of winning, I
don't think of athletes aloft on
their teammates' shoulders or a
new President waving his hands
amidst a downpour of balloons; I
think about my softball team. On
Sunday afternoons this summer
I've patrolled grassy patches of
the outfield for my cousin's
squad. The heart of the roster
consists of husbands and wives
and their children, who take as
much pleasure from watching
grounders roll between the sec
ond baseman's legs as they do
from lining sharp singles up the
middle.
My initial impression of this
apparently relaxed atmosphere
was one of slight disappointment

— this didn't look like the time to
smear on layers of eye-black, and
the thought of sliding into a 10-
year-old second baseman to break
up a double play didn't seem ap
propriate. But after a few games I
realized that I was greatly mistak
en — several players were happy
to participate, but were even more
eager to win. After observing
shady recruiting practices before
important games and hearing
schemes for tiring opposing pitch
ers ("everybody take two strikes
first; make his arm tired") I began
to think that perhaps I wasn't tak
ing this activity seriously enough.
I mention this endeavor be
cause it shows that at any level in
any arena, whether the corporate
world or grade school, profession
al baseball or weekend softball, we
play to win. Competing effuses
some addictive charm that com
pels us to peek at others' finals in
the box outside the professor's of
fice and eggs us into shouting
matches during intramural vol
leyball. We may deny these under
currents within our nature or
sheepishly admit to them, but we
rarely understand them.
Competing is valuable — men
tion can be made of its divisive na

ture, but challenging someone or
something else confers important
experiences for all involved, be
cause competition is not inherent
ly about winning. I respect that
aspect of competition that urges
the individual toward self-better
ment. My old cross-country coach
adored the phrase "you can he bet
ter than you are," and I realize
that the moments of competition \
recall most often occurred when 1
became aware that I had earned
the skills necessary to succeed,
and not during the actual winning
or losing, success or failure.
In explaining his decision to re
tire from the professional ranks,
John Kruk stated that his desire
"to compete at this level was
gone." He reportedly doubted his
ability to both produce results for
the team and for himself while se
verely injured. He exited by leav
ing the game and simply driving
away. But in his final at-bat, he
singled — the hit did not matter in
the final score, but that wasn't re
ally the point.

Dave will slide this weekend fo
Team Hirano.
