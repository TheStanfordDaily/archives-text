## Medicarecuts could be costly Med Center stands to lose up to $33.5 million 
### 
Stanford Health Services (SHS)
could lose about $33.5 million an
nually for the next seven years if
proposed budget cuts to reduce
Medicare and Medicaid reimburse
ments are passed in Congress this
fall, according to a survey of local
hospitals released by U.S. Rep.
Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton.
Academic medical centers
across t he country stand to lose the
most from such cuts, said Peter
Van Etten, the president and chief
executive officer of SHS.
The more difficult medical cases
tend to be researched and treated
at facilities like Stanford Hospital
and oftentimes incur higher bills.
The proposed cuts would result in
disproportionate reductions in
payments to teaching institutions
and doctors. Van Etten said.
According to a letter written
from SHS Chief Financial Officer
James Sulat to Eshoo outlining the
impact of the 11 possible changes
to the Medicare and Medi-Cal pro
grams on SHS, the largest blew
would be dealt by the proposed re
duction of Indirect Medical Educa
tion adjustment to 3.0 percent. By
this reduction alone, SHS would

stand to lose $20 million in reim
bursements for operating costs as
sociated with the training of in
terns and residents enrolled in
Stanford's graduate medical edu
cation programs.
Limits to Direct Medical Educa
tion reimbursements for resident
salaries and fringes, including
salaries and associated programs
"related to the administration of
the graduate medical education,"
would reduce Medicare payments
to SHS by $3 million.
Disproportionate Share Hospi
tal (DSH) payments, by which gov
ernment funds seek to contribute
to hospitals that have "more than
their average share" of elderly, in
digent and critically ill patients,
would be phased out over two
years.
"Elimination of the DSH pay
ments would cause significant fi
nancial hardship to this institu
tion," Sulat said.
The Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren's Hospital also reported a pro
jected loss of $6 to $7 million per
year if disproportionate share dol
lars currently provided by Medic
aid were reduced.

The proposed trimmings of
health care funds are part of the
Republican budget resolution that
outlines a $452 billion reduction in
Medicare and Medicaid programs
by the year 2002.
Van Etten said the proposals to
cut health-care funding are part of
a political game played in Washing
ton.
"The Republicans have gotten
themselves into a bind," he said.
Having committed themselves to
scaling down the federal budget,
but also promising not to touch So
cial Security and defense, Republi
cans found that "health care is the
only thing left."
The proposals for cuts in the
health-care sector come at a partic
ularly tense time for many health
care facilities that have aggressive
ly cut costs over the past few years
to brace themselves for the severe
competition of health maintenance
organizations.
"Now I fear that the same eco
nomic forces that have resulted in
payment well below our costs from
HMOs for employed managed-care
patients will be used to reduce
Medicare payments," Van Etten
said in a statement before Con
gress's Health Subcommittee on
July 20, acting as a representative
of all of the nation's medical
schools and their associated teach

ing hospitals.
HMOs have driven down prices
dramatically in recent years. How
ever, Van Etten said, the savings of
fered by HMOs do not reflect more
efficient delivery of health care.
"More and more health-care
funds are being spent on profit and
administrative costs rather than to
pay doctors and hospitals for the
services provided," said Van Etten.
Stanford University health facil

ities have undergone major reorga
nization over the last five years in
an attempt to more effectively com
pete with California's HMOs. Ac
cording to the President's Office,
health facilities slipped from a $4.3
million profit in fiscal year 1992-93
to a $14.7 million loss in 1993-94.
Moreover, by the end of this
year, SHS will have reduced its
spendingby $83 million since 1992.
