# No-growth bill to go to voters
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council voted unanimously
Monday night to place a growth-limiting initiative
that may affect Stanford on the November ballot, ac
cording to City Clerk Gloria Young.
The council decided to put the issue to the voters
rather than to adopt it now. Measure R, as the ini
tiative has been titled, would limit commercial
growth citywide and would curtail plans to expand
the Stanford Shopping Center.
The council voted 9-0 to oppose the initiative and
to create an ad hoc committee to pen an argument

against it for the ballot.
The council's decision "was not a surprise," said
Emily Renzel, a former City Council member and a
spokesperson for the Citizens of Affirmative Plan
ning, the citizens' group that collected more than
4,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot.
Renzel said she did not expect the council to endorse
an initiative that would limit its power.
Critics of the initiative charge that it will limit the
council's ability to alter land-use
rules for the next 20 years. Among
other provisions, the initiative
would cement most existing land
use rules until 2016 unless voters
approve revisions at the ballot box.
In the discussion preceding the
vote, proponents of the initiative
"urged the council to adopt the ini

tiative," Renzel said. The citizens'
group has formed a committee to
work on drafting an argument in
favor of the initiative for the ballot.
In addition to limiting expansion
of the shopping center, "the initia
tive, if it passes, could also restrict
efforts by the Stanford Medical Cen
ter to improve its ability to deliver
health care to Palo Alto and the re
gion," said Andrew Coe, director of
community relations for Stanford.
The petition, submitted July 14,
arose out of concern that excessive

commercial growth would traffic
and further tip the jobs-housing im
balance, Renzel said.
The initiative would forbid re
zoning residential land, halve the
allowable square footage of build
ings in the California-Cambridge
Avenue Business District and re
tain growth limits adopted in 1989.
A coalition of community and
business leaders, the Citizens for
Palo Alto's Future, has formed to
oppose the initiative.
