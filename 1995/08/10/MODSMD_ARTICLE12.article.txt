BEIJING (AP) - Human
rights activist and Hoover Insti
tution Research Fellow Harry
Wu told a U.S. diplomat who vis
ited him in prison Wednesday
that he suffered back pain and
had not yet received detailed in
formation about his charges.
'"He appeared to be in good
health and reasonably good spir
its," said U.S. Embassy
spokesman Rob Laing.
State Department spokesman
David Johnson reported that Wu
told consular official Daniel Pic
cuta that he had not been mis
treated but that he was experi
encing back pain from a condition
which preceded his incarceration.
"Mr. Wu told our consul that
he'd been told nothing more

about the possible charges
against him than what both of
them had read in Chinese news
papers," Johnson said.
Piccuta asked for a clarifica
tion of the charges, a copy of the
formal arrest notice and more
frequent visits with Wu, but the
Chinese only told him the re
quests would be given "consider
ation," Johnson said.
Wu, 58, has been held in
China since June 19, when au
thorities apprehended him at a
border crossing; he was formally
arrested last month and accused
of spying.
Wednesday's meeting was
only the second time a U.S. con
sular official has been allowed to
see Wu.
