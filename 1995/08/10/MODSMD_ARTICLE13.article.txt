# Pro-union protest
## Workers want farm to say 'Union, yes!' 
### 
Carrying signs that read "fails to
pay wages and economic benefits
established by carpenters in this
area," members of a carpenters'
union are protesting Hillhouse
Construction Company Inc., the
company rebuilding five Stanford
residences.
"Hillhouse is contracted to Stan
ford to do a cheaper job, and he's
taking it out of his worker's hides,"
said Jim Jacobsen, one of the pro
testers.
Two undergraduate houses, Sla
vianskii Dom and Grove-Lasuen,
are being rebuilt by Hillhouse,
which sometimes employs
nonunion carpenters.
Stanford project manager Greg
Gehlen is worried that the protest
might affect the progress of con
struction.
"I'm a little concerned from an

image standpoint," he added.
"Hillhouse gave the low bid on a
publicly open project," Gehlen said.
He said he is aware that Hillhouse
is a nonunion contractor.
A manager for Hillhouse de
clined comment and directed all
questions to Gehlen.
Carpenter protesters arrive
around 7 a.m. and picket on the cor
ner of Campus Drive East and May
field at the site of Grove-Lasuen
and at the other houses, Jacobsen
said. Up to 14 protesters have been
present, he said.
According to Jacobsen, Hill
house is paying substandard wages
to its workers without benefits.
Gehlen said he did not know
what Hillhouse pays its workers.
He said Hillhouse is on the ap
proved contract list.
