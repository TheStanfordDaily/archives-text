### Emery Chen Editorial staff 
High hopes abound for the Stanford men's
and women's cross country teams this year.
Last year, the Cardinal women finished
seventh at the NCAA Championships after
capturing the Pacific-10 title for the second
straight year.
1 his year, all but one of the top runners
from 1994 returns, and, adding to the opti
mism, Stanford just named Beth Alford-Sulli
van as assistant coach.
Alford-Sullivan was head coach of the
women's cross country at Mankato State Uni
versity the past two years. She garnered nu
merous honors, including the 1995 United
States Track Coaches Association Indoor Re
gional Coach of the Year.
In 1994, she was named the 1994 head
coach of a United States women's distance
running team, and this summer she served as
an assistant track and field coach at the U.S.

Olympic Festival in Colorado Springs, Colo.
Some of the runners Alford-Sullivan will
lead at Stanford are Kortney Dunscombe,
Monal Chokshi, Sarna Renfro, Leila Burr,
Amanda White and Amy Mac Arthur.
Dunscombe was the Cardinal's top runner
and was the top American freshman last year.
She placed fourth at the Pac-10 and at NCAA
District-8 Regionals and won Ail-American
honors after placing 18th at the NCAAs.
Chokshi placed eighth at the Regionals,
and Renfro finished 10th at the Pac-10 Cross
Country Championships and was named Ail-
American.
Some top entering freshmen are Mary
Cobb, Cara Aley and Kristina Betzold. Cobb
finished 21th at the 1994 Junior World Cross
Country Championships, and Betzold was the
Wisconsin state cross country champion.
"We have the makings of an outstanding,
nationally ranked team," Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna said. "We should be
ranked in the top eight in the preseason."

The Cardinal men are equally optimistic,
with the entire team returning from the one
which placed second at the NCAA District-8
Regionals and sixth at the NCAAs.
Junior Greg Jimmerson leads the squad
after finishing sixth at the NCAAs and being
honored as an Ail-American. Last season,
Jimmerson placed first at the 1994 U.S. Ju
nior Cross Country Championships.
J.J. White and Rob Reeder will also be
greatly counted on. White, a junior, was Stan
ford's No. 2 runner at the District-8 and
NCAA meets last year while Reeder is a con
sistent runner.
Top newcomers include Brad and Brent
Hauser, both three-time Kinney finalists,
Jason Balkman, Jeff Fischer and two trans
fers, Jason Lunn and James Long.
"I'm not sure if there is a deeper team in
the United States," said Lananna. "The focus
of our team is to make the NCAAs. If we make
it to the the NCAAs we will be a very strong
team. It'll be an exciting year."
