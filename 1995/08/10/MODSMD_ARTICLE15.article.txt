# Another football season is upon us-well some of us
## 
### 
WHEN I SPENT my formative child
hood years in the Midwest, sports, es
pecially football, were a big part of my
life and the world around me. They still are.
On a personal level, as a young boy, I would
play football games by myself, much like
Calvin does with Hobbes. I would run the
wishbone, throw screen passes to myself and,
my favorite, punt and kick field goals.
()n a global level, I would share and revel in
the weekly ritual called major college football.
Every Saturday, during the autumn
months, entire cities would be deserted as
men, and many women, would either vegetate
in front of the television screen or travel to
giant cement stadiums, hold massive tailgate
parties and watch college football.
l ake, for instance, the city of Ann Arbor.
Only 109,000 people live in the home of the
University of Michigan, but, week in and week
out, 102,000 or more fans pack Michigan Sta
dium to watch the Wolverines play football.
Even considering that U. ofM. has 32,000 col
lege students, those attendance numbers are

The ultimate football tradition and fans,
however, reside in South Bend.
Notre Dame and college football are syn
onymous (the College Football Hall of Fame
will open in South Bend this fall).
The lineage runs deep. Knute Rockne and
Ara Parseghian have coached at Notre Dame.
A smattering of great players are George Gipp,
a.k.a. "The Gipper," the Four Horsemen and
Joe Montana.
Notre Dame Stadium, a miniature version
of Michigan Stadium, is one of the most beau
tiful stadiums in the country, with a view of
"Touchdown Jesus." There is nothing in life as
enjoyable as spending a crisp autumn after
noon, with green fields and trees ablaze with
red and gold leaves, sitting in that venerable
brick coliseum watching the Fighting Irish
conquer Florida State.
Okay. So maybe I wasn't at that game. But
I did watch Notre Dame crush Navy back in
1981 and, being the impressionable young
child I was, it was the best sporting event I
have ever experienced.
During my high school career, I could count

on derision and berating from my classmates
and teachers for rooting for Notre Dame

against Michigan and Michi
gan State. I, of course, would
have the last laugh after
they won both times.
Here in California, I
don't quite feel the same
passion in the people around
me for football and other
major sports as I did grow
ing up.
How else could I sit in the

student section at Stanford Stadium and root,
rather loudly I might add, for Notre Dame
when they played here in 1993 and not get
beaten up, or at least verbally harassed?
It's all part of the apathy toward football by
much of the campus. I also have to agree with
ex-Cardinal Coy Gibbs' recent reported com
ments that there is a resentment of the foot
ball players themselves.
Maybe it has something to do with athletes
with scholarships getting a free ride to Stan
ford while the rest of us have to pay more than

$110,000 for our education.
Even so, Cardinal football has a great tradi
tion that should not be so easily dismissed.
Walter Camp and Pop Warner coached foot
ball here, as did Bill Walsh. Ernie Nevers,
James Lofton, John Elway and Jim Plunkett
all played here. The Stanford-Cal rivalry
(which I believe is a bit overrated by locals).
And there's always "The Play" and "Revenge
of the Play."
I have come vaguely close to reaching nir
vana twice in my three years of season ticket
holding. The first came after the 1992 Big
Game when I was on the field at Cal, joining
the legions of Cardinal devotees shouting "we
got in" at those hapless Golden Bear followers.
The second was last year — Washington vs.
Stanford. Official attendance — 44,200. Yeah,
right — I was one of 15,000 braving the drizzle
watching a smash-mouth football victory for
the Cardinal.
It was a great football game.

Emery can't wait to leave this sports-fan hell
