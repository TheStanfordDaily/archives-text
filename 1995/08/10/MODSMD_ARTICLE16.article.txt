# Intermission
## It came from Outer Mongolia: "The Legacy of Chinggis Khan" at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco 
### Kristic Lü Stout 
After five years of treasure sniffing,
transcontinental negotiation and
meticulous restoration, the largest
survey of Mongolian art ever to be exhibited
in the United States has hit San Francisco.
Until Oct. 15, the Asian Art Museum will be
showcasing "Mongolia: The Legacy of
Chinggis Khan," a collection of 155 sacred
and secular works from the 17th through
early 20th centuries.
Mongol mystery
'Tis a culture shrouded in enigma.
The mere mention of Outer Mongolia (a
name more fitting for an alien orb than for a
landlocked nation) conjures images of
Fourth World neglect and barbaric exploits.
One is reminded of barren grasslands,
hordes of menacing warriors or perhaps
Chinggis Khan (otherwise known by the
Persianized Genghis Khan) hungrily suck
ing the bloody neck of his galloping horse
(nourishment for that Mongol marauder
who's always on the go).
Constipated by Mongolian misconcep
tions, it's little wonder why "Mongolian art"
is construed by many as a matter more para
doxical than sweet and sour pork.
Fortunately, the Asian Art Museum's
Mongolian exhibition successfully destroys
the misconceptions of Outer Mongolia as it
celebrates the magnificent craftsmanship of
the nation's Buddhist art.
Mongol renaissance
In the 16th century, the Mongol empire
reconverted to a Mongol empire based upon
the empire of Chinggis Khan. In an attempt
to recreate Chinggis' empire, Altan Khan
reestablished the relationship between Tibet
and Mongolia.
The result of this convergence was an in
credible artistic renaissance, a renaissance
which gave rise to the exquisite Buddhist-in
fluenced art in this exhibition.
The works in the exhibition include gold
spun ridingjackets, sacred texts, silver head
dresses, sacred masks, Buddhist silk ap
pliques, multipart-casted bronzes and a can
vas tent (or "ger" ) big enough to house a few
Mongol camels in a hot tub.
Although it is easy to pick favorites in this
realm of exotic renaissance art, all the ob
jects on display are equally divine in design
and powerful in presence.
"The strength of the show is that there is
no key piece," said Asian Museum project
director Hal Fischer. "The quality is uni
versally high."

Hal Fischer, who raised more than $1 mil
lion to mount this show, acknowledges the
exquisite quality that each and every one of
the exhibit's 155 objects exude. But like the
exhibit's visitors, Fischer can't help but con
fess an affinity for a few key pieces, one of
which is a portrait of the elephant-headed
deity named Ganesha.
"The Ganesha I love," said Fischer. "It is
the Mongolian Babar." The exhibit's Gane
sha is the Tibetan Buddhist version of the
Hindu symbol of wealth. In the portrait, the
12-armed Ganesha is painted in a brilliant
scarlet. It is prancing atop a mongoose that is
excreting gems from both orifices. The scene
is comic-like in its dazzling color scheme and
tickling display.
'Tis Mongol pop art.
Whereas the gambolin' Ganesha may en
chant enthusiasts of 2-D Tibetan merri
ment, Chief conservator Linda Scheifler-
Marks fancies the sensual gilt bronze sculp
tures of Zanabazar, the greatest artist of the
Inner Asian renaissance. She considers his
erotic Sitasamvara the key piece of the show.
The sculpture, a miracle in multipart cast
ing, depicts a young man in active compas
sion with his consort.
"The Zanabazar piece of the embracing
couple is incredible," Scheifler-Marks said.

"The concept that is being meditated here is
that the females represent wisdom and the
male represents compassion. The idea is that
when you are in union there is a complete
balance, there is enlightenment."
"The sculpture is so lifelike," she contin
ued. "It is proportioned beautifully. Just
breathe air into them and they would come
to life. What Zanabazar is saying with his
sculpture is that enlightenment is attain
able here and now. It's not just for the di
vine."
Zanabazar's gilt bronzes are visual feasts
which uncannily resemble miniature beings
encased in frozen dermis. Painted with cold
gold (gold dust mixed in a solution with yak
skin glue), the bronze exteriors resemble
sumptuous flesh envelopes.
Zanabazar's bronzes have such a pres
ence it's not hard to imagine their magnifi
cence actually leading a staring novice to
ward Buddhist nirvana.
Making mongol magic
To lure the Ganesha and the Sitasamvara
away from Outer Mongolia and into San
Francisco, the museum staff had to maintain
healthy intermuseum contact for almost five
years, a task that Fischer did not see as a
major challenge.
"The process of attaining the pieces was
not difficult," he said. "The curators formed
a good relationship with the museum direc
tors abroad."
When Fischer and museum curator
Terese Tse Bartholomew brought the Mon
golian collection to San Francisco last
March, the chief conservator was pleased to
see the excellent physical status of the ob
jects.
"They were in incredibly good condition,"
Scheifler-Marks said. "In Mongolia, the cli*
mate dries the objects in the winter and con
tinues a very low humidity in the summer
time, which is a very stable climate for art
work."
Although the process of obtaining and
restoring the Mongol artwork did not prove
to be overwhelming for the museum staff,
the Asian did meet a challenge when it
came time to arrange the exhibit walls with
the diverse array of freshly imported
pieces.
"The hard part was figuring out how to
take disparate objects to work together to
make a story," Fischer said. "That's how the
creativity of the curators show up."
The museum curators have successfully
woven a story that manages to intertwine
nomadic lifestyle with Tibetan Buddhist tra
dition, the brilliant scarlet skin of Ganesha

with the ashen face of a fallen shaman, the
golden hue of the Emperor's robe with the
silver ornaments of a Buriat tribe saddle.
The didactics pasted to the museum walls
are richly informative and enlightening. I
was particularly fascinated by the Mongo
lian exhibition's wall-scrawled exposition of
a "tsam," or ritual dance theater performed
by Buddhist monks.
I participated in a tsam while traveling in
Mongolia last year. But despite my fluency in
pantomime, I was unable to ask the monks to
clarify the meaning of the ritual.
The exhibit's clear and concise descrip
tion of the displayed tsam masks and acces
sories not only heightened my former appre
ciation for the physical beauty of the pieces
but also explained why one monk had mod
eled a clay skull and another donned the
robes and visage of a weary old man. The
monks were telling a story, and that same
story is now being told in the chambers of the
Asian Art Museum.
"Mongolia: The Legacy of Chinggis
Khan" spins an incredible tale of parading
monks, fanciful deities and divine union.
This collection of gold-hemmed robes,
bronzed lovers and footpaths to enlighten
ment continues from now until Oct. 15 at
the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco.
