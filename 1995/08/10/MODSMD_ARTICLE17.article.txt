## Tales from the Punchbowl SPOTLIGHT SPIN 
### 
Still fiddling away, San Francisco trio
Primus comes at us this time even twangier
and weirder. "Tales from the Punchbowl"
opens with "Professor Nutbutter's House
of Treats," a warped symphony that stops
and starts against the backdrop of disem
bodied carnival-crowd noise.
Then comes "Mrs. Blaileen", the dark
tale of Donny, who is "Oh, what a lonely
boy." The album continues in this manner,
never looking you straight in the eye, but
hooking you like the eerie lights of the car
nival on the outskirts of town.
Primus plays its own music, which is nei
ther normal nor a reaction to the norm. They
have had their moments in the spotlight
(they headlined Lollapalooza two years ago)
and always have at least one song per album
that gets MTV and radio air time (from
"Tommy the Cat" to "My Name is Mud" to
the current hit "Wynonna's Big Brown

Beaver"). However, they have never taken
the musical world by storm and probably
never will. They have their niche, and are
content to explore it all the way to the bottom.
The strongest songs on "Tales" —
"Southbound Pachyderm" or "On the
Tweek Again" — are masterful creations
that highlight the group's enormous tech
nical abilities. Les Claypool's manic bass
takes the instrument to another level. He
has pushed what is normally the passive,
consistent instrument in a band directly
into the spotlight. There is almost never a
bass line you can track in a Primus song.
Claypool sends it all over the place, from
booming bottom lines to guitarlike solos.
Tim "Herb" Alexander matches Clay
pool with his superfast crisp drumming (the
standard riff in "Glass Sandwich" would
qualify as a drum solo on most records), and
Larry Lalonde's searing guitar floats on top
of the rumbling to complete the mix. Clay
pool's voice is also on the fringes of the
bizarre, resembling anything from a mos
quito to a weed-eater.
You don't really sing along to Primus,
you just try to figure out what the hell
they're talking about.

The sound has gotten looser since "Friz
zle Fry," the band's first big album, and in
so doing, it has lost a little of its edge. There
were no goofy songs like "Space Farm" or
"Hellhound 17 1/2" on "Frizzle Fry." Each
song was a complete unit that had its own
story.
Songs on "Tales," on the other hand,
often fade into each other, or start in the
middle, or stop before you're ready for them
to finish. The lyrics, too, have lost some of
their purpose. On "Frizzle Fry" Claypool
railed in his own interesting way against
the ills of society, but on "Tales from the
Punchbowl," he resorts to telling tales, sto
ries of childhood, high school and driving
through the Grapevine. Instead of "an over
aged boy of 39 has left the wing today / The
first time in his life he has made that step /
Be numbed by society and plagued by inse
curity / He's entered in a race that must be
won," we get, "Oh I can still remember Julie
Tolentino, the dancing Filipino / We used to
run around / Her and Flouncin' Freddy
were goin' hot and steady / Now she runs a
dyke bar, the biggest one in town."
The album concludes with one of the
transcendental songs: "Over the Electric

Grapevine." The song rumbles along, fed by
a monstrous bass line, primal drums and
eerie, searing guitar. As the characters in
the song hurtle toward the Grapevine in
their automatic Datsun, the song slowly but
surely picks up speed, Les whispering,
humming and howling the lyrics. The
drums get faster, and you can envision a
huge truck barreling down on our heroes as
they struggle up the huge incline. In
"Grapevine" Primus makes sense, and you
are left with a peculiar feeling of bewilder
ment and awe.
While "Tales" may not be the most con
sistent or solid

record Primus
has made, it
does convey a
mood — a crazy
carnival world
that doesn't
quite make
sense but is
oddly enticing,
and at its best,
amazing.
