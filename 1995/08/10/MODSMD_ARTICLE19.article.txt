# Stanford doctors help deaf boy hear first sounds
## 
### 
On August 3,4-year-old Trenton Crabtree
of Foster City could hear for the first time
since birth.
In June, doctors at the Stanford Medical
Center and the California Ear Institute im
planted a new hearing device in Trenton's
head. The operation made him the first
American child to receive the latest in a fami
ly of controversial implants.
The Clarion implant that Trenton re
ceived is one of a growing number of cochlear
implants designed to restore partial hearing
in profoundly deaf people. The device, some
feel, provides clearer sound quality and more
flexible operation than previous implants.
Already, Trenton can distinguish some
sounds, including his name. It will take up to
one year, however, before he can understand
speech without lip-reading, according to Lisa
Tinokawa, the children's program director at
the ear institute.
Many advocates for the deaf, however, are

skeptical of cochlear implants.
The National Association of the Deaf "de
plores the decision of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration [to allow cochlear implants in
children] which was unsound scientifically,
procedurally, and ethically."
"I'm not sure we'll ever see eye to eye with
the deaf community regarding cochlear im
plants," Tinokawa admitted, "but I hope we
can help them understand that we are not try
ing to change deaf children into hearing chil
dren. . . . There's nothing wrong with being
deaf. [Cochlear implants] are only tools to
help kids communicate with the community
around them."
Cochlear implants are becoming more
popular. The FDA approved the use of the
new Clarion device in children in June, mak
ing it the second device available for implan
tation in children.
Normally, sound enters the ear through
the ear canal and make the eardrum vibrate.

As the eardrum vibrates, it shakes three
small bones. The small bones create waves in
a fluid-filled, snail-shaped region of the inner
ear called the cochlea.
The fluid waves travel down the cochlea
and agitate tiny hair cells on the walls. The
motion of the hairs stimulates nerve endings,
and the brain recognizes the motion as sound.
In profoundly deaf people, the hairs in the
cochlea are often damaged. Conventional
hearing aids do not improve their hearing be
cause the hairs cannot stimulate the nerve
endings.
Cochlear implants combine a microphone,
a voice processing unit and a receiver-elec
trode array unit implanted in the head to con
vert sounds into direct nerve stimuli. The
brain eventually learns to interpret these
stimuli as speech and other sounds.
The Clarion and other cochlear implants
do not create the full range of sound a person
with hearing senses. It can take years before a

person learns to interpret the stimuli created
by cochlear implants.
Roger Carver, a deaf educator and advo
cate in Canada, has criticized the devices as
intrusive and unnecessary.
"We need to address whether intervention
and rehabilitation strategies address the real
ities of being deaf and incorporate the experi
ences of deaf adults," he said in an address to
the Cochlear Implant Forum for the Canadi
an Hearing Society.
Advanced Bionics Corporation, the manu
facturer of the device, recommends the device
mainly for adults with severe deafness who
lost their ability to hear after learning to
speak. Ideal recipients also find conventional
hearing aids unhelpful and are highly moti
vated.
The Clarion was developed by the Re
search Triangle Institute at UC-San Francis
co and Advanced Bionics Corporation.
