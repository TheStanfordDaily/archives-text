## The 						Stanford Weekly Summer intramurals 
### 
Students should
have sports to play
summer quarter.

IT'S PERFECT weather.
The sun is shining and
there are gentle breezes.
It's the type of weather people
dream about playing in.
But yet the basketball, vol
leyball and sometimes even the
tennis courts remain devoid of
players. On any given day, it
seems like Stanford students
and their visiting counterparts
like to avoid the school's athlet
ic facilities.
That's probably not a fair as
sumption. During the school
year, it is also sometimes hard
to spot students outside in the
sunshine. And then there is the
Oval, which always has its
share of sports fanatics.
However, there is a notice
able difference between the
academic year and the summer
quarter in terms of sports.
There are no summer intra
mural sports this year.
While some may say that
there are some students who
are too busy to play intramu
rals and the intramural system
is difficult to set up and main
tain. there are many reasons to
have summer intramurals.
For many students, intra
mural sports offer .the oppor
tunity of playing a sport in a
team environment. Intramur
al teams that are built around
dorms or around clubs in
which members do not know
each other well usually develop
good friendships. In the regu
lar academic year, many peo
ple meet each other for the
first time through intramu
rals.
Friendships among Stan
ford students could also ex
pand to visiting students.
Many Stanford students do not
get a chance to get to know
their visiting neighbors, and
the intramural system could

offer them a good opportunity.
That is no different in the
summer. Summer intramu
rals, if offered, would provide
the same social benefits as they
do during the school year. And
meeting new people is especial
ly important during the sum
mer, when many are more re
served than they are during the
school year.
Besides fostering friend
ships and a team attitude, in
tramural sports give students
the perfect opportunity for
recreation. Many students get
so caught up in their studying
that they lose sight of the fact
that all work and no play is bad.
Because there are no intra
mural sports, many of these
students find that constant
work is an alternative. Having
intramural sports will insure
that these students will have
some fun over ihe summer.
In addition, by requiring
weekly participation, intramu
rals force a commitment upon
students. Since few extracur
ricular activities continue
through the summer, intramu
rals continue to stress the
value of commitment to stu
dents.
Intramurals also add life
and variety to campus. Face it:
during the summer, there isn't
much going on on campus.
With intramural sports, at
least students will have the
choice of participating in
school-sponsored activities.
Finally, intramural sports,
especially in the summer, are
simply fun. After all, the
weather is ideal in the summer
for playing in the sun.
Setting up summer intra
murals, however, is no easy
task. It would require having a
director to organize the sports,
referees who would be able to
go to every game and a number
of willing participants.
However, given the over
whelming benefits of summer
intramurals, the University
should make an effort to set
some up.
