## Who really belongs? 
### 
WITH ALL THAT has been
written and stated about af
firmative action, I find that
at the core of this volatile issue is the
idea of belonging, a feeling of self-as
suredness in one's position in rela
tion to others. Beyond the well-pub
licized finger-pointing and political
back-alley brawls, what I find essen
tial is the stance people take on who
is deserving of what within the
structure of an American society.
Whereas some people zero in on
today's hierarchical framework in
the working world as contemporary
and acceptable, others gaze upon a
vast flowing path that merely
repackages the injustices of cen
turies past into what exists today.
After sampling from the variety
of coverage of this issue, I still think
aboui. belonging, and more specifi
cally, about a documentary entitled
"Incident at Oglala."
I don't recall exactly why I first
wanted to see this Robert Redford
prodnced film. Perhaps I wanted to
learn more about the American In
dian Movement than what a para
graph in U.S. history offered in high
school. Whatever the incentive, I
watched it and found the events and
emotions detailed within it forming
interesting parallels to the stuff of

recent headlines. The work de
scribes the mid-1970s shooting of
two FBI agents on an American In
dian reservation and raises ques
tions about the role of the FBI in the
subsequent arrests and trials of
three Native American suspects.
Through first-person interviews, re
creation of the event j, and pieces of
evidence, the filmmaker meticu
lously points to mistakes and other
factors that may have left an inno
cent man shackled with consecutive
life sentences in prison.
While fascinated with the details
of the actual court, even more en
lightening were the words of various
inhabitants of the reservation â€” one
which had been decimated by vio
lence and engaged in perpetual con
flict with the federal government. As
these individuals spoke deeply about
the suffering and raw despair they
had endured, I understood that
their struggles and desires for self
actualization were akin to those of
people lobbying for affirmative ac
tion, but at a much bleaker level.
As these embattled men and
women recounted tales of enduring
incessant violence, they spoke not of
street gangs but of men toting rifles
bought with government funds and
a leader who represented a federal

office. Raids did not consist of strate
gic tactics on strongholds, but drive
by shootings targeting neighbor
hoods with children playing in the
yard. Whereas affirmative action
seeks equality within the structures
of society such as employment and
education, here was a group desiring
the opportunity to simply exist.
Privileges that the majority of these
individuals' countrymen have long
assumed and abused still did not
enter into these lands.
From witnessing events unfold
on neglected expanses of America in
the recent past, I have received a
harsh reminder that the repercus
sions of race and society stretch far
beyond Congressional legislation
and melodramatic press confer
ences.
Belonging is not just about quali
fying as measurable in relation t<
others; it is about having the oppor
tunity to accept oneself. I realize
now that when words such as
"equality" and "opportunity" are
bandied about, there is much more
than affirmative action to consider.

Dave thinks Sonia would be arrest
ed for doing that.
