NCSU is a fine academic institution â€” not a Corncob College

THIS LETTER IS in re
sponse to the article "Grad
students facing new hur
dles" in the Aug. 3 issue of The
Stanford Weekly. On page 8, the
article states that "North Caroli
na State" was "not exactly the
cream of the proverbial corn

crop."
As an alumnus of North Car
olina State University, I felt that
I, as well as the other former
NCSU students that are
presently here at Stanford in
graduate school, received a very
good technical education at our

undergrad institution. NCSU is
not some unknown, "College of
Dirt." Rather, it is a well-known,
well-respected institution of
27,000 students in the capital
city of North Carolina near Re
search Triangle Park. It was
rated to have the second-best en

gineering institution in the
Southeast, behind Georgia Tech
Surely, NCSU cannot be com
pared to a no-name, "Corncob
College."
