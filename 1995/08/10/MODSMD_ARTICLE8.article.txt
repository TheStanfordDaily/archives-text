# Stanford grads' software startup not just small potatoes

### Vivien Mohanna 
KartoffelSoft. Derived from
the German "Gruner Kartof
felkops," which means "green
potatohead." But to a few Stan
ford students, it rings a different
bell. Not only is it the starchiest
software company Silicon Valley
has to offer, but its employees
come fresh from the Farm.
Kartoffelsoft is actually an edu
cational software -company spe
cializing in computer program
ming for students aged 9 and up.
Justin Kitch, the company's
founder, graduated from Stanford
in 1994. By October, he had set up
his company with partner Matt
Harad, another Stanford alum
nus.
In fact, all but one of Kartoffel-
Soft's employees are either Stan
ford students or alumni.
"We recruit our staff from
Stanford University, because of
the gifted students found there,"
said senior Thai Bui, a staff mem

ber at KartoffelSoft. "We all have
a similar background, which helps
us at a personal level."
Most of the staff members of
KartoffelSoft got involved
through listings posted on cam
pus, while the others are doing
temporary summer internships.
A staff of eight programmers
makes for a homey office setting,
allowing members of the staff to
input ideas throughout various
projects.
"I think there is a lot more to
learn here than at a large compa
ny, because it is a startup compa
ny and we all have more responsi
bilities," said junior James Kim.
Tove Martin, who will graduate
from Stanford next year, is work
ing at KartoffelSoft on a summer
internship and appreciates the
small surroundings.
"We don't get preoccupied with
meaningless tasks," he said. "We
keep focused on larger, more
meaningful projects."
And that's just what Kartoffel-

Soft has been doing. The company
finds itself in the midst of unveil
ing its first kids' software pro
gram, FUNdaMENTAL.
FUNdaMENTAL uses a simple
programming language to allow
the user to manipulate graphical
objects on the screen; it aims at as
sisting students in computer use.
Although the project has not
yet been released, it has been test
ed in several local schools.
"So far, there have been many
positive reactions with the stu
dents," Bui said. "It takes away
the tedious difficulty that is typi
cal of computers."
KartoffelSoft plans to release
FUNdaMENTAL in schools and
homes nationwide within the next
few months.
As for the future of Kartoffel-
Soft, these potatoheads don't plan
on staying buds for long.
The students feel that working
for KartoffelSoft has opened
doors to a promising future in a
world of computers. "It has al

lowed me the opportunity to see
what I want to do in my life, for my
career," Bui said.
"We hope to experience success

with our new product, to establish
security for our future and to keep
developing quality products,"
Kim said.
