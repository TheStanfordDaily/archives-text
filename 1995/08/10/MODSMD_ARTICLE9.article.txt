# Jazz workshop transforms Stanford into an international jazz mecca
## The 						23-year-old Stanford Jazz Workshop attracts jazz legends—and wide-eyed hopefuls—to campus for instruction, discussion and fun 
### Stewart Maclennan Contributing writer 
Inside a hushed Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, jazz aficionados young
and old gather around a Steinway
concert grand to witness an event
most of them have only dreamed of
— legendary jazz bassist Ray
Brown counting off the blues to pi
anist Benny Green.
"Ah-one, two... one, two, three,
four," whispers Brown, and his trio
instantly comes alive; bass, piano
and drums fill the entire hall with a
pulsating swing, and the audience
responds with an irresistible foot
stomping delight.
Moments like these are com
monplace at the Stanford Jazz
Workshop, now in its 23rd year.
The nationally renowned non
profit organization presents a two
month long concert series, three
weeks of intensive jazz instruction
for musicians of all ages, and a se
ries of community workshops, all of
which are open to the public and
boast appearances by landmark
jazz musicians.
Performances and classes
taught by Horace Silver, Joe Hen
derson, Ray Brown, Benny Green
and Steve Coleman have highlight
ed this week's adult residency pro
gram, in which more than 220 ad
vanced players have been partici
pating in a jam-packed, six-day pro
gram that includes master classes,
music theory instruction, small-en
semble playing and nightly con
certs with faculty and students.
Director and co-founder Jim
Nadel recalled the origins of the
Jazz Workshop:
"In 1973 I had just graduated
from Stanford, and a friend of
mine, Bert Carelli, and I were both
interested in playing jazz. There
weren't many opportunities to play
jazz then, so we began to have jam
sessions, as people do all over the
world, every Monday. But what
was different was that on Tuesday,
the same musicians got together
and talked about the music."
He emphasized the educational
nature of those meetings, "We
would say, 'I thought about this,' or
'I approached the music in this
way.' We all exchanged ideas about
our approaches to improvisation.
Then we talked about what songs
we were going to practice for the
next week and all went home and
worked on them."
"Out of that grew what we have
at Stanford this week, with the
same open spirit about sharing
ideas," he said.

According to John Yanofsky,
publicist for the Jazz Workshop,
the first official program began in
1982, with open enrollment for
adults. In 1985, accommodations
were made for children, and three
years later the workshop began a
concert series which has grown in
length and quality ever since.
"This year, we have the most im
pressive concert series ever," said
Yanofsky, who added that artists
such as Grammy-winning tenor
saxophonist Joe Henderson, vocal
ist Madeline Eastman and hip-bop
innovator Steve Coleman will be
featured in performances for the
remainder of this week.
Teaching youth the art of jazz
This year, roughly 300 musi
cians aged 12 to 17 attended one or
both of the workshop's week-long
jazz camps centered in Stanford's
Braun Music Center.
"The kids' camp is very inten
sive," Yanofsky said. "We want to
bring in a wide variety of kids with
all levels of experience. When they
get here, we group them according
to their ability."
Although coming to the work
shop can cost anywhere from $380
to $700 depending on travel ex
penses, both Nadel and Yanofsky
stressed that enrollment is not lim
ited to those with ample resources.
Yanofsky emphasized that the
workshop gave away $30,000 in
scholarship money, mostly to those
younger musicians.
"One of the objectives of the pro
gram is to offer scholarships to stu
dents with jazz potential but not
necessarily the funds," Nadel said.
"Over 50 students are on scholar
ships this year."
For many of the teenagers, a
week at the workshop will expose
them to more music than they have
had in their lifetimes.
"They start the day out with mu
sicianship. This class is based on
call-and-response learning style,"
Nadel explained.
"It's like a jazz conversation in
that the teacher will play some
thing, the students will respond,
and then the teacher will alter the
next response slightly, as if they
were in dialogue," he said.
"The next class is music theory,
based on traditional Western music
concepts, only all the example are in
jazz," he said. "Then they have the
chance to apply what they've
learned in a small ensemble."
In addition to playing jazz in fac
ulty-supervised combos, the kids
have a host of other options from

which to choose.
"There are always open jam ses
sions, free practice time, jazz histo
ry lectures which cover different
periods daily and private lessons
and recreation. In the afternoon
they come back for lemonade — be
cause they are kids."
Fourteen-year-old Saqib Fa
heen of Palo Alto has been playing
the drums for almost three years
and heard about the program
through a friend. In exchange for
helping out at the workshop doing
odd jobs, Nadel let him play in both
weeks of the kids' camp for free.
"It was cool," Faheen said. "The
workshop gave me the chance to
brush up on my playing and to get
tips from real professionals."
Faheen credits drum instruc
tors "Dodger" Posey and Eddie
Marshall for his improvement dur
ing the two weeks and said he hopes
to come back next year.
"I really liked working with all
the other musicians and then get
ting to try out all the new stuff we
learned in the combos," he added.
The adult residency program
The third week of the Stanford
Jazz Workshop features a one week
session for adults, which, with a few
exceptions — like the 11-year-old
drum phenomenon who jams with
the faculty on weekday nights in
the Coffee House — is limited to
older players of intermediate to ad
vanced ability.
"The adult program is more
menu-driven," Nadel said. "Al
though musicians must audition to
enroll in the workshop and are
placed in ensembles by the faculty
according to their ability, they are
free to choose their own theory and
master classes."
In addition to jamming with
other students, the workshop of
fers a series of "specials," master
classes led by world-renowned jazz
musicians. Topics have included
small ensemble arranging led by
Horace Silver, collective improvisa
tion concepts with Steve Coleman,
and trio playing with Ray Brown
and Benny Green.
"There is a wide variety of jazz
perspectives represented in the
program," Nadel said. "You'll find
everything from classical to mod
ern and contemporary jazz — from
Steve Coleman and his popular fu
sion of jazz and rap to Ray Brown
and Horace Silver, who have been
playing jazz for over five decades."
"Our goal is simple," he said.
"We are committed to jazz educa
tion and the presentation of high

quality, uncompromising art in an
environment that respects the
music. We are in a concert hall, not
a smoke-filled diner."
"We are also interested in the ex
change of ideas about the music and
in ways to nurture this American
art form," he said. "Jazz in particu
lar speaks across language and cul
tural borders. The skills that jazz
requires, such as cooperation, com
munication and listening, as well as
spontaneity, are important to fos
ter in people of all ages."
A brief walk through the music

center will quickly illustrate that
the workshop offers a truly rare en
vironment. In between jam ses
sions, students hang out and speak
jazz lingo.
"Hey, did you check out Steve
Coleman this morning? What a
cat!" said one saxophonist to anoth
er.
Others rush over to Campbell
Recital Hall to check out a master
class on jazz piano taught by Silver,
who played "Tokyo Blues," a mod
ern jazz classic which was per
formed by a group of faculty the

week before in a tribute to Silver.
"The students are very enthusi
astic and focused at a very high
level," Nadel said. "There is a
tremendous amount of learning
and information exchange. The fac
ulty too really get something back
from the workshop. They are very
often inspired by the students."
A diverse faculty
In addition to the handful of jazz
superstars who are in residence pri
marily during the adult residency
program, Nadel has brought fine
professional musicians from all
over the country and the world to
share their insights on jazz.
For 24-year-old Yosvany Terry,
a native of Camaguay, Cuba, his
three weeks spent performing and
teaching the saxophone have
marked his first time in the United
States.
"It's really amazing how orga
nized everything is," said Terry,
who added that "it's really nice that
Jim and the faculty have every -
thing in the right place.
"Being able to play in concerts
and at jam sessions in the Coffee

House as well hear all these jazz
stars like Ray Brown and Horace
Silver has really inspired me to
work hard when I return to Cuba,"
he said.
Terry, a professional who has
only been studying the saxophone
for eight years, has performed at
jazz festivals in Europe and tours
regularly with his family's group,
Don Panchos, both in Cuba and in
South America.
He said it is very important for
jazz musicians in Cuba to have the
opportunity to play in the United
States, but he explained that "it is
very difficult to come — the cultur
al exchange between our countries
has stopped."
Terry has been considered an in
spirational performer to students
and faculty alike during the work
shop; he was invited by Latin piano
heavyweight Rebecca Mauleon to
perform with her at the Concord
Jazz Festival two weeks ago.
"I'd love to keep coming back,"
he said. "Playing in a university en
vironment with so many interested
musicians and being able to go to
workshops with stars like Steve

Coleman has really recharged my
battery," added Terry, who will be
returning to Cuba this week.
Even for veteran John McKen
na, who has been with the work
shop for six years, performing and
teaching at Stanford has continual
ly been "kind of a half-vacation,
half-work situation."
McKenna, a freelance saxophon
ist and composer based in Brook
lyn, N.Y., said, "I like the whole idea
of a jazz workshop. It gives me the
chance to learn from students and
faculty and give something back to
the music."
McKenna has spent some of his
free time exploring the Stanford
campus; he raved about the Rodin
Sculpture Garden.
Even though he said the work
shop is continually getting better,
McKenna has only one suggestion:
"I just wish the Coffee House would
stay open until 2," he said. "By mid
night, I'm just getting started but
then it's already time to quit. And
the people are packed in there —
they seem to be enjoying the music
as much as lam."
Even so, it would hard to imag

ine more jazz music taking place at
the Jazz Workshop. Students will
agree that their week spent at
Stanford leaves little to complain
about.
Jazz heaven?
"This is the best possible jazz
workshop [because] Ray Brown is
here," said Tom Elliott, a 37-year
old Oakland resident and bass play
er who is spending his third year at
the workshop.
"In my opinion, Ray Brown is
the greatest bassist who's ever
lived, and I'm happy to call him my
friend," said Elliott, who has con
versed with the jazz master during
master-classes and workshops.
Earlier this week, Elliott men
tioned to Brown that he was having
trouble playing at faster tempos,
and was blown away when the for
mer bassist for Charlie Parker in
vited him to his hotel room for some
personal instruction.
"I'm thrilled," said Elliott, who
added that the workshop is "a good
vehicle to get back into playing reg
ularly in a professional situation."
Nadel said that he is always ex
cited to have musicians like Brown
at Stanford.
"The summer workshop faculty
involves three kinds of faculty
members: those that are excep
tional teachers, those that are ex
ceptional and inspirational musi
cians, and those that are both —
like Ray Brown," he said. "The
music department's academic pro
gram, with which I am involved,
has benefited from the summer
program because we have been
able to bring in and recognize some
of the best teachers and perform
ers in jazz."
Elliott's own thoughts echoed
this sentiment.
"This has always been a rich ex
perience. Anytime I put energy into
music it comes back many times
over from the jazz community,
which does a great job in nurturing
and supporting its less experienced
players," he said.
"There is no conservatory sys
tem for jazz; this is as close as we
get," he added. "In order to play
jazz, you must put your own energy
into the music, and there's no place
like the workshop to gain it from
the people arou nd you."
Helping keep jazz alive
Elliott said institutions like the
Stanford Jazz Workshop will help
promote jazz music.
"Jazz will stay in good shape for
the future," he said.

The Stanford Jazz Workshop
not only benefits the musicians
who travel from all over the country
to study here, but also the Universi
ty Music Department as well.
"The summer workshop has
served as a laboratory in some v/ays
for the Stanford Music Depart
ment's jazz studies because we get
to try out many ideas in the sum
mer," Nadel said. "Our experiences
show us which faculty members are
exceptional and who we'd like to in
vite back here during the school
year to teach."
Both Nadel and Yanofsky
stressed the importance of jazz edu
cation for today's youth.
"With more and more music pro
grams getting cut from schools, our
program offers unparalleled hands
on education," Yanofsky said.
"There's a real emphasis on learn
ing here, and I think the workshop
is helping keep jazz alive."
"We are lucky to feature the
most talented musicians who love
giving back to the music through
teaching. These are energetic, ex
cited people who want to learn," he
added.
Nadel is optimistic about the
workshop's future.
"There is no other program that
has this depth of variety, perfor
mance opportunity, and strength in
faculty," he said. "Everyone that
has ever attended this has wanted
to return."
Yanofsky concluded, "The work
shop shows musicians that jazz is a
discipline, a lifestyle."

Although the Stanford Jazz
Workshop is now winding down for
the year, there are still two more
concerts as part of the workshop's
Five-Star Master's Series, which
features some of the top names in
jazz.
Performing Friday night at 8
p.m. in Dinkelspiel will be Made
line Eastman and Kevin Ma
hogany, both considered to be two of
the world's pre-eminent jazz vocal
ists.
Alto saxophonist Steve Coleman
will bring his exciting combination
of hip-hop, funk and rap to the jazz
tradition to Dinkelspiel the follow
ing night, also at 8 p.m. He will be
performing with his band, the Met
rics.
Tickets can be purchased by call
ing (415) 725-ARTS. For more in
