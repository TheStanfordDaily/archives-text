# SLAC attack: Physics labs brace for funding battle
## SLAC's next challenge may lie not within the atom but in Washington, as funding for basic research is threatened in Congress. 
### Sonia M. Giordani Malcolm Maclachlan 
Research scientists at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
have spent years trying to get to
the bottom of the matter — and
the antimatter.
For nearly 30 years, the SLAC
facility — a national laboratory
funded by the U.S. Department of
Energy and situated atop 426
rolling acres of the Foothills — has
drawn scientists from all over the
world and from multiple disci
plines with its 2-mile-longhigh-en
ergy electron accelerator.
The U.S. House Science Com
mittee toured SLAC last Thurs
day. providing the center's direc
tors a chance to explain their re
search — and the opportunity to
justify continuation of their more
than $140 million annual budget.
Despite SLAC's tremendous ac
complishments, Director Burton
Richter professed to be nervous.
"Everybody knows that this
Congress is in a mood to get the
budget balanced seriously and
rapidly." he said to reporters after
showing a six-member congres
sional committee around the facil
ity.
The leadership of Science Com
mittee Chair Robert Walker. R-
Pa., should give Richter reason to
be confident. Walker — who
gained notoriety a few years ago
for being the first congressman to
speak to empty House chambers in
order to get airtime on C-SPAN —
is known as on outspoken advocate
of technology. He has taken flak
for suggesting the creation of a
Cabinet-level department of sci
ence at a time when most Republi
cans want to cut bureaucracy.
On Thursday, he certainly
sounded like a SLAC supporter.
"We have a very firm commit
ment that we need to be doing
basic science." he said at a press
conference after the tour.
Walker noted that his commit
tee had voted to increase science
research funds above last year's
levels and even above levels recom
mended by President Clinton. This
statement is backed by Science

Committee Communications Di
rector Melissa Sabatine, who said
the center's funding is safe for the
1996 fiscal year.
Gravity Probe B, part of the B-
Factory Project currently under
construction and scheduled for
completion in spring 1998, was the
only one of the center's projects
slated to be cut, but the committee
recently voted to restore it's fund
ing. Sabatine added that the visit
was merely a routine oversight
trip.
At one point. Walker lashed out
for a moment at a reporter who
questioned why Congress would
maintain funding for SLAC while
cutting social programs.
"Since the beginning of this na
tion, we have always had these
people who would like to do the
things now that it looks like we
should do and not invest in the fu
ture," he said. "I think the devel
opment of new knowledge is what
is going to allow us to do these
things in the future."
However, while stating support
for research. Walker also noted a
need for peer review and account
ability in science. He also touched
on the idea of business getting
more involved in research.
Those comments were echoed
by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-
Calif., who told reporters that the
committee is trying to weed out
wasteful programs.
"Many scientific projects were
not returning to the taxpayers
what they put in," Rohrabacher
said. "They've been paying for a lot
of white-coated WPA (W T orks
Progress Administration)."
This kind of talk worried ap
plied physics graduate student
Tim Stowe. who has worked at
SLAC.
"The politicians who fund this
research, most of them don't have
any scientific background," he
said. "They really look at the situa
tion economically. They see corpo
rations that seem to get a lot more
out of the money they spend. But
corporations are never going to do
this basic research."
Stowe admitted that basic re
search is often expensive but said

that sooner or later if must he done
for science to advance. He added,
however, that he understands if
Congress wants to consider the
issue of "how many colliders we re
ally need?*'
Corporate involvement is often
not practical, said SLAC Scientific
Information Officer John Rosell,
because it can take 20 or 30 years
to find practical applications for
discoveries in physics. This fact is
sometimes hard for people to un
derstand, given that the lag time in
other scientific fields is much
shorter — often a year or less in
electrical engineering. Additional
ly, the high cost involved in high
energy physics often threatens the
popularity of these projects.
"It's a big deal to work at a pro
ject that's funded," said sixth-year
physics graduate student Joseph
Berg. SLAC itself and the sheer op
portunity of working at such a fa
cility were factors in his decision to
do graduate work at Stanford. But
he added that his ability to do re
search could be seriously affected
by how Congress ends up funding
the sciences.
"Basic research is basic re
search," Rosell said. "We're trying
to figure out why you and 1 exist.
Somebody takes that knowledge
and finds a use for it somewhere
down the line. The MRI (Magnetic
Resonance Imaging) is a direct re
sult of research done here."
Funding SLAC
The L T .S. Department of Ener
gy's 1995 fiscal year budget within
the state of California totals a
stunning $1.58 billion, which is di
vided among eight programs, ac
cording to a monthly DOE
newsletter.
For the 1995 fiscal year, SLAC
was allocated $170 million for on
going support and construction in
its high-energy physics research.
The funding pays for SLAC's 1,300
full-time staff, 850 users from 60
universities, 11 government labo
ratories and 72 foreign institu
tions.
An additional $22.4 million
went to the separate but closely re
lated Stanford Synchrotron Radia

lion I laboratory (SSRL), which uti
lizes the linear accelerator for ex
periments on synchrotron radia
tion rather than high-energy
physics.
Begun as a separate research
facility in 1973, SSRL was the first
laboratory dedicated to generating
X-rays produced by electrons cir
culating in a storage ring.
Capable of scanning objects in
100 times finer detail than a nor
mal X-ray, researchers have found
useful applications for the technol
ogy for AIDS and other medical re
search, in addition to research in
semiconductors and toxic-waste
disposal, according to SSRL Direc
tor Arthur Bienenstock.
SSRL itself pays for a staff of 90,
and for 956 users from 49 universi
ties, 16 government laboratories,
42 foreign institutions and 31 in
dustrial facilities — including
AT&T, IBM, Intel and Hewlett-
Packard.
Lack of funding limited SSRL to
six months of operations this year.
They turned down half of all re
search requests.
"Could some of the work you re
ject help pay the bills?" Walker
asked after the presentation, one of
several times that he brought up the
possibility of greater corporate in
volvement in the center's activities.
Bienenstock said he hopes to ex
pand operations in the future to
nine or 10 months annually in
order to accommodate more re
quests. He noted, however, that
the facility has a policy of charging
companies for some of the operat
ing costs of research and demands
some payment when a company
starts marketing a product devel
oped with the help of research done
at the facility.
Linear history
The business of SLAC is to
study the subatomic realm of par
ticles and antiparticles.
"They thought they were fin
ished when they got to atoms,"
said SLAC Prof. Richard Taylor,
whose work at SLAC earned him
the 1990 Nobel Prize in physics.
Stanford's multimillion dollar
facility has justified its existence

over the last 30 years by constant
ly adding innovative projects to its
world-class linear accelerator.
Such innovations are presented as
justification for continued govern
ment funding in a time when Con
gress is anxious to cut the budget.
SLAC's research in high-energy
physics and synchrotron radiation
have not only yielded worldwide
recognition in prestigious awards
such as the Nobel Prize but have
also inspired laboratories of compa
rable caliber throughout the world.
Researchers utilize high-energy
beams of electrons and their an
tiparticles, known as positrons, ac
celerated in the 2-mile-long tunnel
in experiments that pursue the
subatomic struct ure of matter and
the forces that exist between the
tiniest components of particles.
Although no longer the largest,
SLAC remains a leading linear ac

(.deration facility.
"At the time it was built, it was
bv far the largest accelerator. We
ould do 20 GeV (gigavolts, or bil
lions of electron volts) when others
were stuck at 5 or 6," Taylor said.
The brainchild of researchers
l'rom Stanford, MIT, Caltech and
\ C-Berkeley, SLAC was funded an
initial $114 million under contract
with the Atomic Energy Commis
sion and began construction in
1962. it took 10 years of intense
research and planningbefore Stan
lord's linear accelerator pulsed its
first electron beam through the 2-
mile-long tunnel at exactly 6:38
a.m. on May 23, 1966. The beam
held 30 times more current than
the most powerful linear accelera
tor existing at the time in the Unit
ed States, Stanford's Mark 111.
Between 1966 and 1972,
SLAC's early experiments were

carried out solely through work
with the linear accelerator, or
linac. Since then, the capacity
and scope of the linear accelerator
facility have grown. SLAC scien
tists have developed new recepta
cles into which the accelerated
electron beams from linac are
channeled.
Critical developments at SLAC
began with the birth of the Stan
ford Positron-Electron Asymmet-
(SPEAR) storage ring in
1972 through a collaborative effort
between Stanford and Princeton
University. The machine utilizes a
colliding-beam technique where
beams of electrons and their an
tiparticles, the positively charged
positrons, rotate in separate circu
lar paths in opposite directions.
The electrons and positrons
tend to follow separate paths ex
cept at certain points, where detec

tion equipment is set up to look at
what happens when the particles
collide. However, such a collision
requires that the electron beams
travel with high enough energy,
and this is exactly what is accom
plished by beaming electrons
through the linear accelerator.
After running the 2-mile length of
the accelerator, the energized elec
trons are diverted into SPEAR.
SPEAR played a crucial role in
the 1974 discovery of the charm
quark, the fourth kind of quark
found. The discovery verified the
validity of counting the quark as a
substructure of matter and
brought Richter, the current
SLAC director, the Nobel Prize in
physics in 1972.
SPEAR also earned Prof. Mar
tin Perl the Wolf Prize in 1982 for
the discovery of the new tau parti
cle, the third electrically charged
elementary particle to be discov
ered after the electron and the
muon particles.
Based on the success of SPEAR.
SLAC went on to build another,
bigger accelerator, called the
Positron Electron Project (PEP),
which utilized the same storage
ring technique and increased the
energy of the colliding electron and
positron beams by a factor of three
or more.
While SPEAR generates a total
of 8 GeV between the two particle
beams, PEP is capable of producing
30 GeV within the storage ring.
The increased energy has permit
ted further study of quarks by al
lowing examination of the smaller
particles produced in the collisions.
By 1980 SPEAR was replaced
by PEP in high-energy physics re
search, but it had already found a
new home. As early as 1973,
SPEAR was being utilized at the
infant SSRL, the nation's first lab
oratory to research X-ray synchro
tron radiation. By 1991, SPEAR
was turned over to SSRL.
Naturally inclined to travel in a
straight line, the electron and
positron beams are curved by the
pull of magnets installed along
their paths. As the particles rotate
within the storage ring, they emit
photons.

In high-energy physics experi
ments, photons are considered
waste products, but the resulting
rays "'are the bread and butter for
synchrotron radiation research,"
Bienenstock said.
Another SLAC innovation was
the Stanford Linear Collider, com
pleted in 1989. The collider em
ployed an entirely new accelerator
technique. Essentially, electron
and positron beams energized in
the linear accelerator are injected
into two small storage rings and
transported along two long curving
routes drawn by magnets. The par
ticle beams are crashed into one an
other at a single collision point that
terminates the beams. Such a sys
tem utilizes close to 100 GeV.
The latest SLAC endeavor in
the ongoing search to learn more
about the structure of subatomic
matter is the B-Factory Project,
comprised of a higher-energy,
more complex PEP II storage sys
tem and a more sophisticated de
tector system, called Baßar.
Given a total of $177 million to
be used over a five-year construc
tion period, the PEP II project up
grades the former PEP I, while the
Baßar detector program, still in its
first year, is working with an addi
tional $70 million from the Depart
ment of Energy and from foreign
contributions.
The goal of the B-factory will be
to accelerate particles to such a
high velocity that they annihilate
each other and produce the maxi
mum number of B meson and anti-
B meson pairs, which will then be
looked at more closely.
With life spans of less than a bil
lionth of a second, looking for a B
meson or its antiparticle is "like
looking for a needle in a haystack,"
said Tom Elioss, acting associate
director of PEP 11. "But Baßar is
geared to look for them."
The detector system will detect
differences in t he rates of decay be
tween the two particle types,
which are expected to offer some
insight into why matter and anti
matter are not equally present in
the universe — a phenomenon
known as the Charge-conjugation
Parity (CP) violation.

SLAC has been working closely
with the Lawrence Berkeley Labo
ratory and Lawrence Livermorv
National Laboratory for the pro
ject. Baßar itself is the result of a
collaborative effort of 10 different
countries, 75 laboratories and uni
versities and hundreds of scien
tists, according to Elioss.
"It all goes back to the Big
Bang," said Elioss. "Matter and
antimatter should have been cre
ated equally, but they were not.
The comparison of the two parti
cles helps to explain why not. It's a
little key to why the universe is the
way it is."
SLACkers' Future
SLAC's future seems assured
by last week's congressional visit.
Talking to reporters outside the
building after the news conference
last week, Richter was cautiously
upbeat.
"I think things went very well. I
just wish we could have shown
them more of what we do here," he
said.
"Things are never safe." he
added. "It's a constant effort to jus
tify your existence. It's always
easy, in times of budget troubles,
that they want to hit things that
won't pay off for a long time.
That's the basic problem of basic
science."
But already SLAC is making
plans for its next project. Called
the Next Linear Collider, the pro
ject will build a much longer facili
ty expected to generate energies
close to a trillion electron volts.
The new facility will pave the way
for the next generation of linear
colliders.
Other nations, including Japan
and Germany, have also expressed
an interest in the construction of
such a facility, Taylor said. Who
will build it first and who will build
it better remains to be seen.
That may be the key to the fu
ture of SLAC — remaining on the
cutting edge of linear-accelerator
technology.
"We have to have a new idea
every once in a while to stay alive,"
Taylor said. "Labs come and go —
not that that is a bad thing."
