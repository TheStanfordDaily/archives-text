# British headline spurs 'hysteria' over English prof's book review
## 
### 
Stanford English Prof. Terry Castle's
literary review of a new Oxford edition of
letters written between 19th century
novelist Jane Austen and her sister Cas
sandra has spurred heated debate re
cently in the British media. Castle's arti
cle appeared in the Aug. 3 issue of the
London Review of Books and was given
the cover headline "Was Jane Austen
Gay?"
While the article contains specula
tion on the homoerotic undertones of
the Austen sisters' intimacy, Castle was
neither responsible for the magazine's
sexy headline nor its equally titillating
press-release title, "Jane and Cassan
dra — Did They Or Didn't They?"
Instead of highlighting controversy,
the titles themselves seemed to be the
source of the hype, or what Castle called
the "tabloid hysteria" and "unbeliev
ably puerile" behavior exhibited by both
British press and Austen scholars.
In her recent whirlwind of media en
counters, including a BBC television
appearance via satellite, Castle has
been unwillingly caught up in a debate
which centers largely on homosexuality
and incest, and which she feels does not
deal with the actual content of her arti
cle.
"Unconscious homoerotic elements
of a kind . . . were fairly common . . .

among unmarried women and siblings"
in 19th century Victorian England, Cas
tle said. "Conventions of the time forced
a lot of same-sex intimacy that we would
ftoday] code as gay."
According to Castle, public debate
has failed to recognize the distinction
between homoeroticism and homosexu
ality. To be homoerotic, in the sense of
an intense bond between members of
the same sex, does not necessarily imply
engaging in explicit sexual activity.
"We have such a crude language for
talking about sexuality . . . [and] sim
plistic ways of thinking about relation
ships," Castle said, adding that critics
and readers have traditionally over
looked the importance of female-fe
male relationships in literature and
history.
Understanding the crucial role Cas
sandra played in Austen's emotional life
allows for richer literary interpretation
of the author's work, she said.
In her article, Castle wrote, "Sororal
or pseudo sororal attachments are ar
guably the most immediately gratifying
human connections in Austen's imagi
native universe.
"It is a curious yet arresting phe
nomenon in the novels that so many of
the final happy marriages seem de
signed not so much to bring about a

union between hero and heroine as be
tween the heroine and the hero's sis
ter."
Most upsetting to Castle have been
what she called "unbelievably homo
phobic" attitudes which have surfaced
over the past few weeks, and that even
the possibility of Jane Austen's homo
sexuality has so strongly offended many
contemporary British readers.
Some Austen scholars have charged
that Castle, a "Californian," is ignorant
of cold English winters and thus the
need for the Austen siblings' physical
intimacy in bed.
Although discussion over her article
has strayed from its original context —
which Castle described as an attempt to
"understand more fully Austen's men
tal world" — the fact that people are
talking about the issue of homosexuali
ty in a more "forthright," if homopho
bic, way is important.
According to Castle, it is "a step for
ward conceptually [in the process of)
the granting of citizenship to homosex
uals through the gradual recognition of
the homosexual presence in literature
and art."
Castle has written her own press re
lease, to be published in the next issue
of the London Review of Books.
