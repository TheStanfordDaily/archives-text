Computer thefts soar
: With a recent rise in computer thefts,
equipment losses reported over the past
two months account for nearly half of the
losses reported this year, according to the
Stanford Police.
From Jan. 1 until the end of May,
$53,779 in computer equipment was re
ported stolen. By contrast, the months of
June and July saw 11 computer-theft inci
dents totaling $42,036.
Most of the thefts occurred in academic
buildings on campus, including the Gradu
ate School of Business, the Quad and the
Green Earth Sciences Building. The stolen
equipment was usually unattended and
unsecured, police said.
"Usually ; our theft rate goes down in

the summer because students aren't
here," said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said the recent rise in com
puter thefts might be the work of a serial
burglar who is familiar with the campus.
The suspect was arrested twice on cam
pus in the 1980s but is currently out of cus
tody and at large.
"We are still doing some fingerprint
work and other stuff," Niemeyer said.
The suspect's name will be released
when police have made a positive identifi
cation.
