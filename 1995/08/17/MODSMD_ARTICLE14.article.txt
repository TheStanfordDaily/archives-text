## Women's volleyball aims for another title Question about whether Folkl or Sharpley will play this year for Stanford 
### Emery Chen Editorial staff 
Athletic teams at Stanford are expected to
win — and the women's volleyball team is no
exception.
Last year's squad won the NCAA Champi
onship, defeating UCLA for the national title.
The Cardinal went 27-1 and only two players
were lost to graduation for this year. In addi
tion, National Player of the Year Gary Wen
dell returns to lead the team.
"Expectations will be high, as usual," Stan
ford head coach Don Shaw said. "But a key
factor in our success will be the 'national team
question marks' we have in Kristin Folkl and
Lisa Sharpley. We may not know their status
until the middle of September or the start of
t he conference season."
Sophomores Folkl and Sharpley currently
are working out with the U.S. National Team
and may not play on the Farm this season.
Many are betting that Folkl, Volleyball Maga
zine's Freshman of the Year, will be asked to
remain with the squad and play in the
Olympics. Whatever happens, Shaw has a
plan.
"The lineup possibilities include one with
Folkl and Sharpley, one without Folkl and
Sharpley, one with Folkl and without Sharp
ley and one with Sharpley and without Folkl,"
Shaw said. "If Sharpley is with us, we'll prob
ably continue our 6-2 offense. But if she isn't,
t hen we could revert to a 5-1."
Even without the duo, Stanford still has a
potential national championship team. Wen
dell. Marnie Triefenbach, Wendy Hromadka
and Barbara Ifejika will form the core of the
squad.
Senior setter Wendell was a consensus
first-team All-American last year and Volley
ball Magazine named her Player of the Year.
Wendell lead the team in assists, had a hitting
percentage of .335 and turned down an oppor-

tunity to train with the U.S. National
Team. Triefenbach, a senior outside
hitter, also was named Ail-American
and she finished second on the squad
in kills, behind Folkl. A first-team All-
Pacific-10 selection, Triefenbach led
the team in aces.
Hromadka, another senior outside
hitter, supplies consistency and ver
satility to this year's squad. She is ex
pected to play a major role this sea
son.
A sophomore middle blocker, Ifeji
ka, one of two Canadians ever to play
for Stanford, started most of last
year. She hit .303 and finished third
on the team in blocks, behind Sharp
ley and Anne Wicks, who graduated.
Others who will play a big part in
this year's team are Maureen
McLaren, Eileen Murfee and Cather
ine Julliard. McLaren, a senior, is the
only Cardinal female to win NCAA
championships in two sports in the
same year. She is a backstroker on the
swimming team in addition to being
an outside hitter. Junior middle
blocker Eileen Murfee is a good offen
sive player, hitting .315, and is ex
pected to succeed Wicks. Julliard
often was the first player off the
bench last year. The third setter on
the team, Julliard, walked on to the
squad.
This year's schedule begins with
the State Farm NACWAA Showcase
in Lincoln, Neb. Nebraska, Penn
State and Cal State-Northridge, along
with Stanford, will comprise the field.
Nebraska and Stanford, the No. 1 and
No. 2 teams in last year's end-of-the-

regular-season polls, could potentially meet if
both teams win their first-round matches.
If all goes as planned for the Cardinal, the

squad's season would end at the NCAA Finals
on the campus of the University of Massachu
setts.
