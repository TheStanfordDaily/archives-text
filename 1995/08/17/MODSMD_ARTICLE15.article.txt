Golfers
The United States team
that will compete in the 35th
Walker Cup Match will not
suffer a dearth of Stanford
players.
Stanford golfers Tiger
Woods and Notah Begay 111
were named to the partial
squad of four players. Six addi
tional golfers will be selected
later.
Woods, a sophomore, won
the 1994 U.S. Amateur and
helped the Cardinal to a sec
ond-place finish at the 1995
NCAA Championships. He
ended the tournament tied for
fifth place.
A senior last year, Begay
tied with Woods for fifth at the
Championships and recently
won the Northeast Amateur.
He was a quarterfinalist at the
1993 U.S. Amateur. â€¢
Women's soccer
Soccer America's women's
soccer preseason poll is out,
and Stanford ranks third.
Seven starters are return
ing from last year's squad,
which reached the NCAA
quarterfinals. In all. 16 Cardi
nal players are returning from
the team, which finished 16-2-
2 and fourth in the final poll.
In perhaps the most obvi
ous selection in all of college
athletics, eight-time defending
NCAA champion North Car
olina is atop the rankings. Last
year's runner-up, Notre Dame
is second.
