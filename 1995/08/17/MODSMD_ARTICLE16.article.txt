## The 						Bard is in the Bay 
### Melissa Hung Elizabeth Murtaugh 
Ail the world's a stage this summer
in the Bay Area. An enticing vari
ety of Shakespeare is in perfor
mance, rich with opportunities to satisfy
any palate for theater. Like most of the
Bard's plays, the ensemble of shows pre
sented will entertain both the intellectual
and the smut-loving sides of any audience.
Among the numerous productions going
on this summer, two theater companies in
particular demonstrate how differently one
can enjoy the works of our language's great
est playwright. Hosted in an open-air,
Globe-like amphitheater nestled in the Sies
ta Valley of Orinda, the California Shake
speare Festival is the Bay Area's oldest.
In Santa Cruz, famous for more out
landish productions, Shakespeare gets a
wacky, 20th century face lift.

Kings and drunks
The wooded grove that surrounds
Bruns Memorial Amphitheater seems like
a site Shakespeare himself might have
chosen for his productions. Just as his
characters often seek the idyll of an escape
into the woods, following the windy path
to the theater (built expressly for Shake
speare performances) will remind you to
forget everything but the wiles of Eliza
bethan England.
Don't let the first scene of the California
Shakespeare Festival's "Henry IV, Part I"
fool you. Political as this play is, it is not as
dry and austere as the opening dialogue
between the fretful king and his right
hand man, the Earl of Westmoreland. Mas
ter of contrast that he is, Shakespeare be
gins the play with a serious tone to make
the upcoming ribaldry seem even more
comic.
Enter Sir John Falstaff (played by
Shakespeare veteran Joe Vincent), one of
the most lovable, laughable sinners on
stage, and one of this production's most
winning performances. Sporting perhaps
the biggest beer belly in theatrical history,
Falstaff steals, lies, drinks and makes a
fool of himself with the grace of the hip
popotamus he looks like.
All the while, he is young Hal's (Don
Burroughs) guide through the wayward
misadventures that make his father, the
king, uneasy about the future of his coun
try's throne.
Hal is caught between two worlds: one
that weighs him down with the concerns
of imminent kingship over an unstable
England, and another that distracts him
from the burdens he would rather not be
sober enough to think about.
In contrast to all the other actors cos
tumed in Renaissance garb, this T-shirt
and blue-jean-clad Hal — bearing a strik
ing resemblance to James Dean — appears
to be an anachronistic rebel without a
cause.
While his distinctly modern outfit sets
him apart from the rest of the cast imme
diately, Burroughs hardly relies on his
clothes to draw special attention to his
character. Early on in the performance, he
delivers a convincing version of one of the
most famous asides in all of Shakespeare's
plays:
"And like bright metal on a sullen
ground, / My reformation, glitt'ring o'er
my fault, / Shall show more goodly and at
tract more eyes / Than that which hath no
foil to set it off / I'll so offend to make of
fense a skill / Redeeming time when men
least think I will."
Hal's metamorphosis from a miscreant
to a valiant soldier-statesman bridges the
huge gap between the upper and lower

classes in Elizabethan England. Ethnic
bickering between enemy Brits adds an
other layer of comedy to the play's politics.
The rivalries are funniest when charac
ters are mocking each other's accents and
attire. The bare-chested, saber-bearing
Scotsman with his flaming red mane and
plaid kilt got the most laughs in my section
of the audience.
The entire cast's impressive command
of this, Shakespeare's zaniest history is a
masterful melange of fun and politics.
Radical
Blondie pulses dreamily against the
redwoods. The forest floor is remodeled.
A wood-chip-and-twig carpet is your blan
ket for an evening. One large streaming
sunbeam spotlights a world-class collec
tion of wicker picnic baskets.
This natural clearing in the forest —
the Festival Glen at UC-Santa Cruz —
calls for strange frolicking creatures and
serious revelry, and although a crowd of
hungry Shakespeare groupies might
qualify, it is "The Tempest," produced by
Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC), that
truly supplies both in healthy, campy
portions.
Served on a stage that resembles a
booby-trapped skateboard ramp, SSC's
production of "The Tempest" has a flounc
ing vitality, partially the result of a drag
queen makeover, a new early '80s sitcom
wardrobe and a few tasteful Buck Rogers
on-the-skids accessories. Further vivifica
tion of the original Shakespeare text de
rives from the pop-culture physicality and
palates of the players. Prospero, in full
mad-scientist regalia, wielding a TV*an
tenna staff, is the wronged but rightful
Duke of Milan. With the help of island
sprite Ariel, the Duke creates a tempest
that shipwrecks the usurping King of
Milan's (Prospero's brother Antonio) en
tire party — in order to make right.
The tale grows complicated as those on
the island eventually run into one another
— or fail to.
Decidedly uncharacteristic character
portrayals abound. A buffed-out Ariel,
Eric Newton, prances on a trapeze, pulling
Olympic-gymnast moves without a hint of
exertion in his sassily delivered lines.
Alonso and Ferdinand, respectively King
and Prince of Naples, are portrayed by one
actor, Michael Stuhlbarg, with the help of
strategically placed stage doors and a
mannequin.
"The Tempest" delivers the plot's
havoc and subsequent reconciliation with
fast-paced surprise-a-minute charm, em
bodying SSC's original goal to produce
Shakespeare in a form relevant and at
tractive to the 20th century audience.

Nancy Bertossa, SSC marketing man
ager and publicist, said that rather than a
highbrow academic attraction, SSC is a
people's festival. SSC's seasonal audience
approximates 40,000, 40 percent of which
come from outside Santa Cruz County.
Notoriously offbeat productions and
nontraditional casting — such as a soap
opera rendition of "Hamlet" — have been
the professional nonprofit theater's spe
cialty since its conception 14 years ago.
This season, along with "The Tem
pest," SSC presents "King Lear" and
Ronald Harwood's "The Dresser," a play
about an English Shakespeare company
performing "King Lear" while besieged by
Fascist bombings (shown in the Perform
ing Arts Theater).
According to Bertossa, Scheie chose
these three plays in accordance with his
own personal preferences, those of the di
rectors he hoped to work with, and the
overarching thematic ties between the indi
vidual works. In each of this season's plays,
a powerful father figure is challenged to ac
knowledge the boundaries of his ability to
control both humans and nature.
With the production of "The Tempest,"
Scheie has managed not to control the ac
tors and their environs, but instead to
skillfully provide a guiding vision.
Whether classic or cult, this summer's
Shakespeare will remind you of scores of
reasons why Shakespeare simply never
gets old. As prophetic as they are poetic, his
plays will never bore us, because their sub
jects blend our lofty dreams with the stuff
of everyday life.
