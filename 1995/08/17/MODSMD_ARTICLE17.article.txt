Safe
Where I live is a soon-to-be gated
golf course "community," so I braced
myself for Todd Haynes' inevitable re
proach and warning: for those who

would Brazilianize America, there is no place
to hide. "Safe" says this lightly, but mostly it
just made me feel glad I didn't live in South
ern California. That place is scary.
True, the opening sequence features a
gate sliding open to a suburban sanctuary
and the rest of the movie demonstrates
pretty convincingly that money can't buy
safety. But from which danger? What lurks
in "Safe" is not violent crime, but rather an
immaterial menace, metaphorically tagged
"the environment." The mysterious "envi
ronmental illness" from which our
house / trophy wife suffers is much less a
physical disease than a cultural malady.
.The point being that you can withdraw
from the Uzi-toting gangs but not that cul
ture whose toxicity they manifest. Its fumes
pervade the gates.
In Haynes' last feature, "The Karen Car

penter Story," Ken and Barbie dolls act out
the tragedy of anorexia. In "Safe," the direc
tor allows himself live humans, although Ju
lianne Moore's pallid Carol remains a fragile
doll. A self-styled "milkaholic," she whiles
away her days on the Fernando Valley
"homemaker" circuit — fruit dieting with
friends, furnishing her frigid domicile,
breathing in the aerosol culture.
After diagnosing her general languor as "a
disease you catch from the environment," ac
tual symptoms (psychosomatic, genuine, or
both?) begin to appear, and Carol decides to
enroll herself in Renwood — "a safe haven
for troubled times" tucked away in the
desert.
Haynes' Renwood taps all potential for the
bizarre. In the name of "wellness," the cultish
leader motivates his flock with New Agey
mantras and tight syllogisms: "self-hate is bad,"
so "give yourself to love." Here, Carol learns
about "unloading" and "safe rooms" and it is
not long before she is lugging around an oxygen
tank and living in her own fiberglass igloo.
If Haynes' visiting husband and stepson
are disconcerted by the spontaneous chanting
of the Renwood anthem, then we are, by the

movie's end, downright freaked out. They
never even saw the staggering convalescent
in his Gap spacesuit. The soundtrack's or
gans play like a Gothic "Halloween."
Haynes' fantastically eerie "Safe" doesn't
chastise. Carol's illness is ambiguous in origin
and the critique thickly veiled. Moreover,
these suburbanites are victims too. It's hard
not to feel sorry for them.
It's also hard not to like this movie (al
though the absence of any other moviegoers at
the show demands qualification: it must not be
impossible). Haynes' vision is, as usual, origi
nal. San Fernando is a cultural apocalypse so
terrible and

bizarre that it
renders an other
wise scary movie
almost funny —
but not quite.
"Safe" res
onates like it
should. And still
I can't get that
spacesuited guy
out of my head.

Wow!
