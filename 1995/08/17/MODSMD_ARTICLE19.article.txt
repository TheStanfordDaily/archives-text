# Safety phones and cheap tickets, but no discs
## ASSU works in summer 
### 
Students may soon be headed to theme
parks at a reduced price, thanks to the
ASSU.
According to Publications Board Di
rector Danny Bressler, ASSU will be in
troducing its entertainment services,
which aims to provide Stanford students
with discounts on a variety of products
and services, including tickets to sporting
events and Great America and ski trip
packages.
While Bressler stressed that the pro
ject is still in its developmental stages, he
said the ASSU will be unveiling some
thing solid soon.
"There has been a lot of positive feed
back, a lot of interest in having this,"
Bressler said.
Although there are currently only a
few ASSU senators and two members of
the Council of Presidents on campus, they
are also helping to see projects begun in
the 1994-95 academic year to fruition, ac
cording to ASSU Senate Chair Alane
Murdock.

One of these projects is the installation
of courtesy phones at the entrance of all
dormitories.
"Campus security was really lacking,"
said Murdock said. The installation of
courtesy phones is one of the pillars in the
ASSU's plan to make the Stanford cam
pus a safer place.
Murdock admitted that Stanford has
an extremely low incidence of crime, but
she said that "it is necessary for this cam
pus to be proactive, and not wait for some
thing to happen."
The ASSU's safety recommendations
foresee the strategic location of courtesy
phones throughout campus as well as in
creased lighting on campus.
An additional change involving the
ASSU was the closure of Disc Connection,
a CD exchange, which according to
Bressler was not financially viable. The
Disc Connection opened last fall as part of
an entrepreneurial grant program spon
sored by the ASSU.
