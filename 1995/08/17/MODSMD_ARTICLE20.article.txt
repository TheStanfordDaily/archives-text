# Students test grad life
## 
### 
This summer, a small group o( minority
undergraduates from Princeton, Yale, Cor
nell and UCLA are exploring graduate
school and academic careers at Stanford as
part of the undergraduate Minority Sum
mer Research Exchange Program.
Running for eight weeks between June
26 and August 18, the program involves
each member institution sending 10 minor
ity undergraduates to other schools which
act as hosts.
Geneva Lopez, assistant director of grad
uate studies and director of minority gradu
ate student services in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, coordinates Stan
ford's participation in the program.
"Stanford has been a part of this ex
change program for seven years, and we
have undergraduates who are conducting
research at all of the member institutions,"
she said. Lopez directly surveys professors
for their availability to work with under
graduates during the summer.
Faculty mentors guide the students in
honing their research skills and improving
their abilities to analyze and solve new prob
lems. Such experience is intended to make
participants more qualified as graduate
school candidates.
Chemistry Prof. Dale Drueckhammer,
who has worked with the program for three
years, said that getting students involved in
research is definitely important at the un
dergraduate level.
"The program is still useful even if it's

not the same field of research that a student
might later pursue," he said.
To help pay for room and board, partici
pants are funded by the Ford Foundation, the
Mellon Foundation and Stanford through a
stipend totaling $3,500 per student.
Students work on individual research
projects according to their fields of interest.
Each student is expected to make at least
one major oral presentation and to submit a
10- to 20-page paper at the end of the pro
gram. They also participate in numerous
field trips and workshops that discuss
teaching, research writing and the Gradu
ate Record Examination.
The program is open to minority under
graduate students of all disciplines. Poten
tial applicants of African-American,
Alaskan Native, Mexican-American, Puerto
Rican and Native American descent are so
licited by schools that participate in the ex
change program.
Selected applicants are interviewed to
evaluate their interest in pursuing doctoral
degrees. Final selection is based on those in
terviews and the overall application.
Criteria such as grades, letters of refer
ence, awards and honors, participation in
extracurricular activities and the appli
cant's personal statement of purpose are
considered, but Lopez maintains that "the
most important factor considered is the ap
plicant's interest in academic research and
in pursuing the Ph.D. degree."
