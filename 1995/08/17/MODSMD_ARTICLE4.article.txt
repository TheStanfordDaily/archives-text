## The 						Stanford Weekly Fight no-growth bill 
### 
Last Monday, the
Palo Alto City Council
voted unanimously to
place a gTowth-limiting ini
tiative on the November bal
lot.
Known as Measure R, the
initiative would give the pub
lic a chance to limit commer
cial growth in the entire city -
including the Stanford Shop
ping Center and possibly
Stanford Medical Center.
Curtailing either of these
two institutions on campus
would not be wise. By leasing
out the Stanford Shopping
Center, Stanford makes a
good deal of money. The ex
pansion of the shopping cen
ter stands to only help the
University and the sur
rounding community, which
benefits from the jobs and
revenue the shopping center

produces.
If the initiative is passed, it
would put a halt on the Uni
versity's plans to expand the
shopping center by 160,000
square feet. Limiting the
growth of the shopping cen
ter will only hurt the Univer
sity and students.
In addition, there is a risk
that the Stanford Medical
Center could be hindered in
its efforts to deliver health
care to residents of nearby
neighborhoods. Any news of
limiting the Medical Center
is bad news.
Although Palo Alto's con
cerns of increased traffic and
a jobs-housing balance are
justified, there must be other
ways of dealing with them.
Affecting two of Stanford's
main services to the commu
nity is not acceptable.
