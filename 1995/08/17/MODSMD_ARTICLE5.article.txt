# Housing and storage
## 
### 
A S THE END of the
/\ summer quarter ap-
JL JLproaches, students are
once again faced with one of
the great dilemmas of college
— figuring out what to do
with their stuff.
For many who left campus
after the spring quarter, that
meant going through their
things and carefully putting
them in boxes that would
later reside under Wilbur or
an outside storage facility. Al
though the lines may have
been long, University storage
was probably the most conve
nient for these students.
Summer students are also
given a similar option known
as interim storage. Although
this interim storage works ex
actly like the one offered at
the end of spring, it may not
be t he most convenient option
possible.
Because most summer stu
dents leave campus for about
two to three weeks, packing
their belongings and moving

them to Wilbur may not be
the easiest solution. What
might be easier is to just leave
their things locked in their
summer dorms until they re
turn.
Some of these students al
ready have roommates who
stay on campus during the in
terim housing period. Instead
of boxing" up their things, it
might just be simpler to leave
them in the rooms and pay a
small fee. The same can be
said of rooms where no one
stays on campus during inter
im housing.
Although safety may be a
concern, students should re
alize that there is no guaran
tee of security in interim stor
age. In addition, there are al
ways students who stay dur
ing the interim period and can
report suspicious behavior.
Students who leave their
belongings in their rooms —
even when charged a fee —
will probably appreciate the
lack of a hassle
