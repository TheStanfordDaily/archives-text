## Gender Warriors??? 
### 
LAST FALL, I took a class
geared for the discussion of
gender as related to the sci
ences. Since it fulfilled both the
University's gender requirement
in addition to another distribution
requirement, the class was over
flowing with a diverse mixture of
students. At the first section meet
ing, students crammed into a
small corner room, toting shiny
new books and pushing chairs
about, generally ready for discus
sion. The teaching assistant
scrawled his name across the
chalkboard and distributed copies
of the syllabus.
And then it all went downhill.
Someone began the discussion
with a broad generalization about
women. This raised the ire of an
other student across the room.
The terms "sexist" and "chauvin
ist" then flew like spears across
the crowded room when even more
entered into the fracas. With the
discussion reduced to high-volume
name-calling, I should have
walked out. Mercifully, the hap
less TA managed to boom his voice
over the rabble and the hour ended
— nothing accomplished except
the creation of disgusted factions.
I remember these events now as

a female student walks to her
classes at the Citadel and Congress
continues to mull over what to do
with Sen. Bob Packwood. I don't
know how much progress has been
made to balance opportunities for
women. Some point, with encour
agement, to numbers like the col
lege enrollment statistics. Others
point to matters like the Tailhook
scandal that rattled this country's
military as evidence of woefully
slow advancement. From what I
have come to understand of this
topic, there is no shortage of opin
ions. But there exists a distinct
drought of elaboration about the
roots of the problem and how it can
be communicated.
Perhaps these circumstances
explain why the judicial system
has taken such a prominent role in
determining the course of gender
relations — its dynamics may in
clude finger-pointing, but it even
tually leads to decisions. I some
times wonder about the long-term
consequences of society's reliance
on court decisions in this area.
Recently a group of women
were awarded a sizable amount of
financial compensation for suffer
ing a variety of offenses by a for
mer employer, a top-ranking offi

cer in a powerful corporation.
Some observers consider the event
a significant victory in the battle
against sexual harassment. The
case maintains coverage of this
issue in the public eye, and the vic
tors can be pleased that their suf
fering was recognized. But what
does the defendant learn? He re
turns to his position and I question
if he, or anyone else, thinks about
his actions.
Punishment corrects wrongdo
ing and sometimes it is the neces
sary route to solving a problem.
However, in the case of gender is
sues, it would be promising to see
greater exploration.
In my class, more than one indi
vidual launched into tirades
against a person or society. Authors
were quoted and page numbers
were cited. Unfortunately, that was
the extent of the dialogue. Despite
the talking, little was said beyond
restating the dilemma. Ultimately,
I learned to put up with loud voices,
but my education to understand
ended that first section.

Dave thanks Dr. S. Eng for setting
the standard.
