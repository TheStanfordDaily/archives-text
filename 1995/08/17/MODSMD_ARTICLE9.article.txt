# Biology Prof. Schimke recovering from accident
## Paralyzed in a February bike/car accident, he works hard learning to use his muscles once more 
### John Yung Contributing writer 
On a hot summer day in the
spinal cord injury unit of the Palo
Alto Veterans Administration Med
ical Center, Robert Schimke sits in
a wheelchair playing Shanghai on a
Macintosh.

He has been in the hospital since
February, when parts of his spine
were crushed in a bike crash. Soon,
he will finally return home after
spending five and half months in
the hospital.
On Saturday, Feb. 25, three bi
cyclists were approaching the inter
section of Portola Road and Sand
Hill Road. The driver of a beige
Honda Civic watched as two of
them turned right. Schimke, the
third bicyclist, went straight.
The California Highway Patrol
concluded that Schimke had the
right of way as he cruised across the
intersection on his Trek 5200 and
was struck by the car. Now he has
two wheelchairs, his manually op
erated chair, which is still difficult
to maneuver, and his power chair,
which can go 7 to 8 mph.
"It's been quite a change for
someone who is reasonably active
to somebody who can't move one
thing," Schimke said.
After the collision, paramedics
took Schimke to Stanford Medical
Center. The outlook was bleak, be
cause he was unable to move any
part of his body below his neck. He
had dreams about fighting in a war,
even though he never served, ac
cording to his wife, Stanford biolo
gy professor Patricia Jones.
After two weeks completely par
alyzed, Schimke moved a toe, and at
least a semblance of hope re

stored.
Schimke used to ride his bike
every day from Stanford to his
home in Palo Alto; he is now an in
complete quadriplegic. He has no
upper-body sensation. He has lost
autonomous muscle control, in
cluding temperature and blood
pressure sensation, as well as bowel
and bladder function.
Sections of Schimke's spine
were crushed, and neurons leading
to muscles below his neck were de
stroyed. Now the neurons must re
generate and relearn their func
tions, and his tissues must be exer
cised to restore strength. Some
areas of his body still can't feel a
thing, and in other areas, it is even
worse.
"Some sensations are perceived
as pain," he said. "It is extremely
unpleasant."
It will be a long, difficult road to
regain muscle control after being
paralyzed. Schimke spends four
hours a day in therapy.
"I think it's closest to being a
newborn child," he said.
"I have to relearn how to use [my
muscles]," Schimke said. "Some
things you don't even think about,
like brushing your teeth and get
ting in and out of bed."
Schimke hopes to walk again,
but first he must learn to stand.
"Too much time in a wheelchair,
and your butt gets sore," he said.

Amazingly, Schimke maintains
a sense of humor and optimism and
avoids dwelling on the past.
"There's no sense in having any
anger or revenge," he said.
He is struggling to regain the
ability to write; he now finds it diffi
cult to move his fingers and press a
keyboard. But Schimke uses the
power of technology to overcome
some hurdles.
His computer now has an extra
large trackball instead of a mouse.
He uses a grip that fits over four fin
gers with a prong at the end to
punch keys which have been re
arranged for easier access to the
more frequent letters. With a grin,
he said there are plans for a voice
recognition system.
Schimke has been an outstand
ing researcher and professor, one of
the reasons for the Biological Sci
ences Department's success.
He graduated from Stanford
with a degree in biological sciences
and a medical degree. However, in
stead of practicing, Schimke be
came interested in basic research
at the National Institutes of
Health.
"I took a year off to do research,
and I fell in love with it,"he remi
nisced.
Schimkejoinea Stanford's phar
macology department in 1966 and
became chairman in 1969. He
transferred to biological sciences

because he enjoyed the breadth of
basic research questions the de
partment was working on.
"I also enjoy the stimulation of
interacting with undergraduate
students," he said.
Not only a great teacher,
Schimke has an incredible record of
research success. He has won a
number of prestigious research
awards
Schimke's lab studied how cul
tured animal cells become resistant
to cancer chemotherapeutic agents.
Among other achievements,
Schimke discovered the phenome
non of gene amplification.
However, Schimke doubts he
will return to laboratory research.
"I don't anticipate I'll be able to
run a lab," he said. "It was small to
begin with."
Schimke is more optimistic
about future teaching. Though he
may not be able to teach large lec
ture courses, he is excited about
sponsoring small tutorials.
What he finds most exciting is
the prospect of returning home. His
house has been refitted with an
extra-large shower, a ramp leading
to the back door and new corridors
to fit a wheelchair.
Recovery will take at least a year,
and Schimke will face a lifetime
struggle to stay healthy.
"You have to use everything you
got, which isn't much," he said.
