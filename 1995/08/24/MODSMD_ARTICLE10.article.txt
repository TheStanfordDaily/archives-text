# Raiders visit continues a longstanding tradition
## The 						NFL on the Farm: Stanford has been host to a Super Bowl and birthplace of gridiron greats 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Oakland Raiders' much-anticipated
visit to Stanford Stadium this week is a his
toric event, but it isn't a first. Stanford and
pro football go back a long way. From Ernie
Nevers, who played with the Duluth Eski
mos and the Chicago Cardinals from 1926 to
1931, to last year's crop of NFL draftees, the
Cardinal has placed more than its fair share
in the football job market. Stanford was also
the site of a memorable Super Bowl 10 years
ago, the first ever to take place in a college
stadium.
What follows is a look back at that Super
Bowl and at some Stanford football stars
who have gone on to become NFL legends,
viewed through the eyes of history and the
words of The Stanford Daily.
Super Bowl XIX
Super Bowl XIX was memorable, not for
the game, but for who was there. The two
teams playing were the San Francisco 49ers
and the Miami Dolphins; the coach for the
Niners was named Bill Walsh, and the quar
terbacks were Joe Montana and Dan Mari
no.
According to a report in The Daily by
Dave Dutcher, "Montana relies less on raw
physical talent than does his counterpart,
but in the 49ers' controlled, short passing

game, execution is primary."
It's nice to know that nothing has
changed in the Niners' philosophy.
A few days before the game, Walsh had
this to say about returning to the field where
he had coached before and would do so again
later: "It'll be great if we win, and walking
out of the stadium I can take a look around
at the campus, but before that, there's no
room for sentimentality. I won't have time
out there on the field to think about it. All
that matters is that there's a well-marked
field."
Ticket prices for the game were $60, and
200 were allocated to University students,
faculty and staff and distributed in a lottery.
Even the entrepreneurial spirit that per
vades Stanford today existed a decade ago.
"About half of those students who won
tickets through this draw indicated they
would consider scalping the prize if the price
was right," according to a poll The Daily
conducted at the time.
As for the game itself, The Daily reported
that "at the end of the third quarter . . . the
literally hundreds upon thousands of media
representatives were kindly asked to gather
at the southern end of the press box if they
wanted to go to the locker rooms for inter
views. ... By the time that announcement
was made, the game was over."
"The simple truth is that the San Fran
cisco 49ers dominated the Miami Dolphins.

The Dolphins' ma
chinelike offense was
missing a few nuts
and bolts Sunday,"
and "San Francisco
solved what could
have been the great
est puzzle in Nation
al Football League
history, 'How do you
stop Marino?' "
The scoreboard
read 38-16, and Mon
tana was named
Super Bowl MVP
with his 24 of 35
passing for a then
record 331 yards
through the air.
Jim Plunkett
Some consider
him the best football
player in Stanford
history; after all, he
was voted so during

the Stanford centen
nial celebration. Jim
Plunkett was the
first, and only, Indi
ans (as Stanford was
nicknamed back
then) player ever to
win the Heisman
Trophy and he was
one of three overall
No. 1 draft picks
from Stanford.
The much-bally
hooed quarterback
played his first game
on Sept. 21, 1968.
"At 1:35 tomor
row afternoon, the
curtain may rise on
the Jim Plunkett era
in Stanford football
history," The Daily
reported the previ
ous day.
"Plunkett, as any
one who hasn't been
cave-exploring for
the past six months
knows, will be the
Tribe's starting
quarterback for the
1968 grid campaign.
A sophomore (eligi
bility-wise) who red
shirted last year,
Plunkett will get his
first taste of varsity
competition tomor
row when the Indi
ans host San Jose
State in the season
opener.
"A 6-3, 203-
pounder, Plunkett
brings with him a

style of quarterbacking which Stanford
football fans haven't seen in years — the
pro-style, drop-back passing attack. [Head
coach John] Ralston calls him 'the best
thrower we've had since I've been here.' "
As reported in The Daily, the game
against the Spartans went well despite being
a little long for some tastes: " 'That had to be
the longest game in history,' assistant coach
Jack White commented after Saturday's 3-
hour-and-15-minute contest. A new rule
which calls for stoppage of the clock after
every first down was the prime factor in de
laying play."

Maybe part of the reason for the length of
the game was all the scoring the Indians did:
"A well-oiled Stanford football machine,
with poised Jim Plunkett at the controls,
ground outclassed San Jose State into the
dust Saturday afternoon, 68-20.
"The wizardry of Plunkett and his light
ning-fast battery mate Gene Washington
proved too much for the hapless San Jose
eleven. Plunkett connected on 10 of 13 pass
es for 277 yards and four touchdowns.
"Plunkett's impressive debut perfor
mance was no doubt the highlight of the af
ternoon."
Plunkett was later voted Back of the

It's a little-known fact that in between his two terms at Stanford,
Bill Walsh had some other coaching jobs, including one where
he returned to Stanford to claim victory in Super Bowl XIX.

Jim Plunkett won the 1970 Heisman Trophy as a Cardinal quar
terback before going on to a stellar career in the NFL.
Game. That year, he passed for 2,156 yards,
completing 52.9 percent of his attempts.
Over his career, he amassed 7,544 yards
through the air in his three years, connect
ing on 530 of 962 passes for a 55.1 percent
completion rate.
In 1970, his senior and Heisman Trophy
year, Plunkett led Stanford to the Rose
Bowl despite losing the final two games of
the regular season, finishing with a record
of 8-3.
Big Game that year was highlighted by a
wild romp through the streets of San Fran
cisco. "Police, a more-than-topless dancer
[pictured in a front-page photograph], sev
eral dazed alumni and more than 3,000
rooters, revelers and assorted parade
chasers" marked the event, which included
threats of disruptions and cancellation of
the game by the People's Athletic Libera
tion. "Local yippies" and the traditional
"beating of a person running on the field"
by the Stanford Band were also on hand.
The PAL stated, "The Big Game is a tra
dition that reaffirms values which are the
strength of Amerika — brutality, drugs and
rape. It is an example of 'overkill' in which
the purpose is to annihilate your opponent.
We will take any action necessary to stop it."
Sam Goldberg, leader of the Jock Libera
tion Front, which was part of PAL, rap on
the field with a National Liberation Front
flag. He was promptly beaten unconscious
by the Stanford Band.
The Rose Bowl was a much better and
uplifting affair. Fred Leeson, "Daily Grid
Scribe, Ret.," waxed poetic in his lead de
tailing the victory over Ohio State and
Woody Hayes:
"Savor again the final minute, the tu
multuous spellout rumbling through the
bowl of humanity, the band incessantly
rocking, the second-team offense running
out the clock and the lights starting to glow
lavender in the settling smog.
"When the countdown was over, the
most daring whimsy of Stanford fans was
reality on the Rose Bowl scoreboard: Stan
ford 27, Ohio State 17."
Plunkett had a great game in leading the
team.
"Plunkett, finishing up the classic col
lege career of all time, completed 20 of 30
passes for 265 yards, 11 of 13 coming in the
second half, including The Pass — a scram
bling, 35-yard effort caught by Bob Moore
between two defenders on the Buckeye 2
that set up the go-ahead touchdown in the
fourth quarter.
"Plunkett, playing perhaps his finest
game for Stanford, was forced to change his
plays at the line of scrimmage 'at least half
the time, partly to contend with OSU's
safety blitz."
The Heisman Trophy race was won by a
much larger margin than the 10 points in
the Rose Bowl. Plunkett tallied 2,229 votes
to Joe Theismann's 1,410 of Notre Dame.
As Ralston commented, "It's great."
•John Elway
The headline in the Feb. 22, 1979 edition

of The Daily read "Cards sign nation's No.
1 high school quarterback."
John Elway, best known for his last
minute drives as well as his losses in the
games that mean the most — like Super
Bowl games — combined both in one mem
orable game on the Stanford campus.
However, to assume that one game could
sum up his great college career would be to
do a great disservice to the legacy he left
behind.
Elway came into Palo Alto as a highly
touted freshman. He instantly was a major
part of the team. "Having already won the
N0.2 spot behind [Turk] Schonert, the 6-
foot-3,180-pounder has an arm that others
only dream about — other opposing coach
es begin having nightmares."
He got his first substantial amount of
playing time in a victory against Boston
College his freshman year. As reported in
The Daily, he went 12 for 21 for 132 yards
and three touchdowns "and generally made
the Eagle defense look bad, skirting their
pass rush with Baryshnikov-like moves and
riddling the BC secondary with his .44 cal
iber arm.
"[He] impressed everyone with his flat,
hard and accurate passes. Yet Elway's most
noticeable attribute was not his arm, but
the extreme poise he showed while leading
the Cards to 23 second-half points.
"After the first time we scored it was just
bing, bing, bing, bing right down the field,
which gave me a lot of confidence," Elway
said at the time, adding, "1 just went in
there to try and do my best."
From that humble beginning, he did his
best, fulfilling all expectations by the end of
his senior year.
"IHead coach Paull Wiggin probably il
lustrated how far Elway is above everyone
else when he said 'We wonder what's wrong
with John when he only throws for 250
yards, when any quarterback in America
would love that kind of day,' " The Daily re
ported.
Big Game 1982 was one game in which
Elway threw for more than 250 yards. He
connected for 330 that day, 29 of them on a
fourth-and-17 pass from the 13-yard line
with 58 seconds remaining. The last
minute drive led to a Mark Harmon field
goal for a 20-19 lead.
Then came "The Play." With four sec
onds on the clock, Stanford kicked the ball
off to Cal. After catching the ball, players on
the Cal team lateraled the ball about five
times, but officials appeared to call the
game over when one of the ball handlers
was tackled as he was passing the ball. Cal
eventually ran the ball in for a touchdown
through a celebrating Stanford Band, who
rushed the field thinking the game was
over.
A few seconds later, the game ended and
so did Elway's college career. However, he
wouldn't forget that game. The Daily re
members:
"Elway came out of the locker room
some 20 minutes or more after the game.
He said he needed time to think.

"But his emotion was unquestionable.
Behind the calm, poised quarterback accus
tomed to talking to the press, Elway was
angry. The anger of someone who just had
something taken away. It was the anger of
someone knowing that something of his has
been unrightfully stolen.
"This game was just a farce," Elway told
The Daily after the game. "It's an insult to
college football. It's just a farce.
"I don't believe that they (the officials)
can take something away like that. I've seen
the tape three times and there is no doubt
that the guy was down.

"They took the game away from us. It's
unbelievable.
"I did not want to end it this way", Elway
said, letting sadness for a few quick seconds
drown his anger. This is my last game, the
one I'll always remember."
James Lofton
James Lofton's greatest assets are his
confidence and his ability to dance in the
end zone,' quarterback Guy Benjamin said
of his talented receiver in the locker room

James Lofton's performance at Stanford in the mid-1970s foreshadowed a brilliant ca
reer as an NFL receiver.
after a recent practice," a Daily article said.
Lofton agreed, saying, "You can't ques
tion yourself. . . . When a play is called to
me, I have no negative thoughts. I know I'll
be open. If the ball is anywhere near me, I'll
catch it."
His confidence was soon eclipsed by his
ability. Considered by most the best receiv
er of all time in the NFL before some guy
named after a grain took over, Lofton was a

star in the Pac-8 conference in both football
and track.
As The Daily reported, "His long legs are
powerful enough to make him a world-class
long jumper (best jump: 26' 9") and a fine
sprinter (best times: 20.7 and 46.6, respec
tively, in the 200 and 400 meters)."
Lofton stood 6-foot-3 when he was on the
Farm and weighed 187 pounds. During the
time he played (1977 was his senior year),
large receivers were unique, not the norm.
His size and physical talents were hard to
ignore, especially if your name was James
Lofton.
"'I think I have great hands," Lofton told

The Daily at the time. "That has to be my
biggest asset. My weakness is in carrying
the ball after it's caught. I'd like to be as
quick as Darrin [Nelson]. If I could be as
quick as that, I'd be unstoppable."
Benjamin, the quarterback who often
threw to Lofton, recognized Lofton's tal
ents and faults.
"James and Tony [Hill] are two really
good athletes who are really fast," Ben
jamin told The Daily at the time. "I think
James has the potential to be much better
than Tony [who played 10 years as a wide
out for the Dallas Cowboys] because he has
better natural ability.

"One fault James has, though, is he gets
a little tied up with the defensive backs.
He's more concerned about where the de
fensive backs are than letting them worry
about him. But he's improved tremendous
ly over the last year in that respect."
Lofton continued to improve. In his se
nior year, he caught 53 passes for 931 yards
and set the Stanford single-season receiv
ing record of 12 touchdowns. In the NFL,
well, he did nothing but set a few records
and appear in a few Super Bowls.
As Walsh said in 1977 of Lofton, "He is
the greatest receiver I've ever been associ
ated with."
