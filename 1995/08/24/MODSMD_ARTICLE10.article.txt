# Raiders visit continues a longstanding tradition
## The
						NFL on the Farm: Stanford has been host to a Super Bowl and birthplace of gridiron greats 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Oakland Raiders' much-anticipated
visit to Stanford Stadium this week is a his
toric event, but it isn't a first. Stanford and
pro football go back a long way. From Ernie
Nevers, who played with the Duluth Eski
mos and the Chicago Cardinals from 1926 to
1931, to last year's crop of NFL draftees, the
Cardinal has placed more than its fair share
in the football job market. Stanford was also
the site of a memorable Super Bowl 10 years
ago, the first ever to take place in a college
stadium.
What follows is a look back at that Super
Bowl and at some Stanford football stars
who have gone on to become NFL legends,
viewed through the eyes of history and the
words of The Stanford Daily.
Super Bowl XIX
Super Bowl XIX was memorable, not for
the game, but for who was there. The two
teams playing were the San Francisco 49ers
and the Miami Dolphins; the coach for the
Niners was named Bill Walsh, and the quar
terbacks were Joe Montana and Dan Mari
no.
According to a report in The Daily by
Dave Dutcher, "Montana relies less on raw
physical talent than does his counterpart,
but in the 49ers' controlled, short passing

game, execution is primary."
It's nice to know that nothing has
changed in the Niners' philosophy.
A few days before the game, Walsh had
this to say about returning to the field where
he had coached before and would do so again
later: "It'll be great if we win, and walking
out of the stadium I can take a look around
at the campus, but before that, there's no
room for sentimentality. I won't have time
out there on the field to think about it. All
that matters is that there's a well-marked
field."
Ticket prices for the game were $60, and
200 were allocated to University students,
faculty and staff and distributed in a lottery.
Even the entrepreneurial spirit that per
vades Stanford today existed a decade ago.
"About half of those students who won
tickets through this draw indicated they
would consider scalping the prize if the price
was right," according to a poll The Daily
conducted at the time.
As for the game itself, The Daily reported
that "at the end of the third quarter . . . the
literally hundreds upon thousands of media
representatives were kindly asked to gather
at the southern end of the press box if they
wanted to go to the locker rooms for inter
views. ... By the time that announcement
was made, the game was over."
"The simple truth is that the San Fran
cisco 49ers dominated the Miami Dolphins.

The Dolphins' ma
chinelike offense was
missing a few nuts
and bolts Sunday,"
and "San Francisco
solved what could
have been the great
est puzzle in Nation
al Football League
history, 'How do you
stop Marino?' "
The scoreboard
read 38-16, and Mon
tana was named
Super Bowl MVP
with his 24 of 35
passing for a then
record 331 yards
through the air.
Jim Plunkett
Some consider
him the best football
player in Stanford
history; after all, he
was voted so during

the Stanford centen
nial celebration. Jim
Plunkett was the
first, and only, Indi
ans (as Stanford was
nicknamed back
then) player ever to
win the Heisman
Trophy and he was
one of three overall
No. 1 draft picks
from Stanford.
The much-bally
hooed quarterback
played his first game
on Sept. 21, 1968.
"At 1:35 tomor
row afternoon, the
curtain may rise on
the Jim Plunkett era
in Stanford football
history," The Daily
reported the previ
ous day.
"Plunkett, as any
one who hasn't been
cave-exploring for
the past six months
knows, will be the
Tribe's starting
quarterback for the
1968 grid campaign.
A sophomore (eligi
bility-wise) who red
shirted last year,
Plunkett will get his
first taste of varsity
competition tomor
row when the Indi
ans host San Jose
State in the season
opener.
"A 6-3, 203-
pounder, Plunkett
brings with him a

style of quarterbacking which Stanford
football fans haven't seen in years — the
pro-style, drop-back passing attack. [Head
coach John] Ralston calls him 'the best
thrower we've had since I've been here.' "
As reported in The Daily, the game
against the Spartans went well despite being
a little long for some tastes: " 'That had to be
the longest game in history,' assistant coach
Jack White commented after Saturday's 3-
hour-and-15-minute contest. A new rule
which calls for stoppage of the clock after
every first down was the prime factor in de
laying play."

Maybe part of the reason for the length of
the game was all the scoring the Indians did:
"A well-oiled Stanford football machine,
with poised Jim Plunkett at the controls,
ground outclassed San Jose State into the
dust Saturday afternoon, 68-20.
"The wizardry of Plunkett and his light
ning-fast battery mate Gene Washington
proved too much for the hapless San Jose
eleven. Plunkett connected on 10 of 13 pass
es for 277 yards and four touchdowns.
"Plunkett's impressive debut perfor
mance was no doubt the highlight of the af
ternoon."
Plunkett was later voted Back of the

It's a little-known fact that in between his two terms at Stanford,
Bill Walsh had some other coaching jobs, including one where
he returned to Stanford to claim victory in Super Bowl XIX.
