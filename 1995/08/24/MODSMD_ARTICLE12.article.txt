# Editor resigns
## Anderson set to leave his position as head chief of independent Stanford Magazine 
### 
After nearly five years as editor of
the Alumni Association's indepen
dent publication, Stanford Maga
zine, Bruce Anderson will leave his
position on Sept. 1.
Anderson announced his resigna
t ion in late July, two months after
the Stanford Alumni Association
voted unanimously to merge Stan
ford Magazine with the University
alumni publication, the Stanford Ob
server.
"If we weren't undergoing a
major shift with the |Stanford] Mag
azine, maybe I would have stuck
around a little longer — then again,
maybe not," said Anderson, who saw
the timing as simply "a neat transi
t ion point for the next editor."
"Int he past, the editor has had an
enviable degree of latitude in shaping
the magazine," he added. "I am not
su re' that the next editor will have the
same latitude."
An article in Saturday's San
Francisco Chronicle suggested that
Anderson's resignation may have
been prompted by disagreement
with University administration over
the content of articles presented to
t he alumni readership. The Chroni
cle report noted one story about
Stanford's indirect-cost scandal and
another discussing gay and lesbian
life on campus.
Alumni Association President
Bill Stone said that on several occa
sions University President Gerhard
Casper had expressed frustration
with "missed opportunities" by both
publications, which were "not focus
ing attention on issues that the Uni
versity was eager to communicate."
Given the limited number of
times per year that the publications
reach alumni, opportunities to cover
stories focusing on issues "central to
Stanford" should not be wasted, said
University Communications Direc
tor Teny Shepard.
Shepard referred to the cover
s tory in a recent issue of the maga
zine featuring the golf team at Stan
ford as an example.

"If we were going to have only
four magazine issues per year... we
should be focusing on teaching,
learning and research at Stanford,"
Shepard said.
"The president — who is a very
important entity — is not, however,
fthe magazine's] primary con
stituency," Anderson said. "Our pri
mary audience is the Alumni Associ
ation membership.''
The goal of the magazine, Ander
son said, is to best serve the needs of
the readership.
One concern that prompted the
overhaul of Stanford's alumni publi
cations was the Observer's question
able effectiveness in delivering news
about Stanford and campus life to
the alumni.
"It's a remake of the Campus Re
port," Stone said of the Observer.
"It's not prepared with the alumni's
mailing list in mind."
After it became clear that the Ob
server was due for change, discussion
began ovei whether having two sep
arate publications would confuse
alumni, Shepard said.
It is hoped that the new joint pub
lication will "more effectively speak
to the University's agenda," said
Stone.
Editorial staff at the two publica
tions "will be working together, or at
least coordinating for story ideas" so
they do not step on each other's feet,
Stone said.
The new joint 112-page maga
zine, due to appear next spring, will
be co-produced six times a year. Stan
ford Magazine's current four-mem
ber editorial staff will publish 80
pages, including the Class Notes por
tion and advertisements. A 32-page
section entitled "Stanford Today,"
which will be overseen by Stanford
News Service, will replace the Stan
ford Observer.
Anderson will probably stay with
the magazine as editorial director
until the end of the year unless he de
cides to take another job offer.
