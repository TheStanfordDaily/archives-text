# Chinese court convicts Wu, sentences him to 15 years
## Hoover Fellow may serve prison term before being expelled 
### 
A Chinese court Thursday convicted human rights
activist and Hoover Institution Research Fellow Harry
Wu of spying, sentencing him to 15 years in prison, ac
cording to China's official Xinhua News Agency.
The court also said Wu will be expelled from China.
Under Chinese law, Wu must serve the prison sentence
before he is expelled, according to a court spokesman
who gave his name as Mr. Yang.
U.S. Embassy spokesman Robert Laing said it was
not yet clear when Wu would be expelled and whether

Chinese authorities would insist he
serve the prison term.
The Wuhan Intermediate People's
Court pronounced Wu guilty of spying,
posing as a government worker and il
legally obtaining, buying and provid
ing state secrets to foreigners. Wu and
his attorney have decided not to ap
peal, Laing said. Appeals in China al
most never change a verdict.
The 58-year-old Wu, who is a U.S.

citizen, has been held by Chinese authorities since June
19, when he was apprehended with a colleague at the
border between China and Kazakhstan. On July 8, Wu
was formally arrested and accused of espionage in con
nection with his efforts to expose human rights abuses
in the laogai, the prison labor camps where he spent 19
years as a political prisoner. He was later held at a pre
trial detention facility in Wuhan, a city in central China.
In Wyoming with vacationing President Clinton,
deputy White House press secretary Ginny Terzano de
clined comment, saying, "We are waiting for informa
tion from the United States Embassy in Beijing. There
are only press reports at this time. Nothing has been
said by the Chinese government."
Wu's sentence comes at a low point in U.S.-Chinese
relations. On Wednesday, China's official Xinhua News
Agency released a scathing commentary that rebuked
the United States for taking a hegemonic outlook to
ward China's development and said U.S.-Chinese rela

tions were at their worst since 1979, when the two na
tions established formal diplomatic ties.
"We would like to advise those Americans with an
anti-China mentality to give up their anachronistic way
of thinking... so that Gold War II can be avoided," the
commentary stated.
Wu's conviction was a chilling partial realization of a
Los Angeles Times report Wednesday that quoted se
nior Clinton administration officials as saying they be
lieved Wu would be tried within two days and then re
leased after being convicted on minor charges.
Wu's case has received international attention as one
of the major battlegrounds in the escalating tensions be
tween the United States and China. Some political lead
ers have urged a stern response to Wu's imprisonment,
including economic sanctions, but the Clinton adminis
tration has elected to approach the Wu case with delib
erate caution.
"I think the situation is in a position where the less
that is said about it right now the better," President
Clinton said in an Aug. 10 press conference.
It remains in doubt whether First Lady Hillary Rod
ham Clinton will attend a U.N. conference on women
next week in Beijing. Many have joined Wu's wife and
colleagues in urging Clinton to forego the conference to
show solidarity with Wu.
Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff will meet
with leaders in China this week to discuss U.S.-Chinese
relations, including Wu's imprisonment.
In June, China denied U.S. access to Wu despite a
consular agreement that allows access to detained citi
zens within 48 hours of notification. The Chinese gov
ernment has since allowed consular officials two meet
ings with Wu spaced 30 days apart, the minimum fre
quency required by the consular agreement. They have
rebuffed U.S. requests for more frequent access.
U.S.-Chinese relations have been in a downward spi
ral since June, when the United States granted a visa to


Wu
