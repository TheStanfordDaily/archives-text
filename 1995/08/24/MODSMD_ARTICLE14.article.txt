## Former Stanford prof. wins position by 19-1 margin in regents vote 
### 
Former Stanford Psychology
Prof. Richard Atkinson was se
lected last week by the Board of
Regents to replace Jack W. Pelta
son as president of the University
of California..
Atkinson, 66, will resign his po
sition as chancellor at UC-San
Diego and will assume the presi
dency Oct. 1.
The regents voted 19-1 in favor
of Atkinson, with three regents
abstaining and three absent. The
one opposing vote came from stu
dent regent Edward Gomez, re
sponding to student complaints
about the Atkinson's inaccessibil
ity as chancellor.
Hoover Fellow Glenn Campbell
was one of the regents who ab

stained. Campbell said his main
concern was Atkinson's age.
Another reason Campbell ab
stained "had to do with the payoff
[Atkinson] gave to some woman,"
he said, referring to a suit
brought against Atkinson by for
mer lover Lee Perry alleging he
had convinced her to abort their
child.
Atkinson claimed he was sepa
rated from his wife Rita at that
time. He eventually paid Perry
$250,000 in an out-of-court settle
ment.
Atkinson served on the Stan
ford faculty from 1956 to 1980
and during that time spent three
years at UCLA.
"He was a very optimistic, posi

tive guy, and tends to get people to
work easily with him," said Psy
chology Prof. Gordon Bower, a
former colleague. "He has good
administrative skills."
Atkinson officially left Stan
ford in 1980 to become the chan
cellor at UC-San Diego, which has
since then boasted a 62 percent in
crease in student enrollment and
climbed to the top 10 in federal
funding for research.
The regents' first choice for the
position was Ohio State Universi
ty President Gordon Gee, who de
clined the offer amid the furor
over the regents' vote last month
to end affirmative action pro
grams.
