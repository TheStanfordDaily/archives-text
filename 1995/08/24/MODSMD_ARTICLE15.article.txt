# Packard Hospital avoids loss in funding by submitting plan
## 
### 
Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital has weathered a lot of tur
moil this summer. In addition to a
surprise facilities inspection two
months ago, it found its Medicare
and Medi-Cal funding threatened
and its initial plan for correction
sent back for amendment.
The hospital's correction plan
and was approved last week after
its second submission.
The saga began in June when
the eight members of the state De
partment of Health Services visit
ed the hospital to investigate a
complaint.
The audit uncovered many pa
perwork violations detailed in a
25-page report completed on June
16. The problems, although only
involving paperwork, actually
could have seriously jeopardized
patient carc, .said Carla Framiglio,
district manager of the DHS office
in San Jose.
The report noted some incom
plete records and loose files on

shelves, including some old re
ports from as far back as 1983
without medical record numbers.
"It wasn't that there was just
all of this filing laying around,"
Framiglio said. "There were many
reports and X-rays about people
that were ill, and they were not
filed properly. That information is
critical to the care that they would
or would not receive."
The severity of the problems
prompted the DHS to threaten to
withhold Packard's Medicare and
Medi-Cal funding if they weren't
immediately corrected. Framiglio
said her office expected the prob
lems to be corrected within 30
days.
Packard immediately complied
with the DHS requests, assem
bling more than 100 pages of a cor
rection plan. After some further
tinkering by the hospital, the plan
was approved by the DHS last
week.
"At LPCH, we understand the

importance of keeping and docu
menting patient medical records,"
O'Connor wrote in a statement.
"We will begin to implement the
necessary procedures to ensure
our compliance with the state. . . .
We fully anticipate continued par
ticipation in the federal Medicaid
and state Medicare programs."
Of the problems cited in the
audit, she said, "Clearly it's not
the ideal situation."
O'Connor said the hospital has
taken some steps to prevent fu
ture problems.
"We have installed a check
and-balance system. We are look
ing to work with outside industry
experts for medical records. And
we are reevaluating our current
policies," she said.
The hospital is also evaluating
staff levels and incorporating the
hospital's quality management
department in the oversight of the
