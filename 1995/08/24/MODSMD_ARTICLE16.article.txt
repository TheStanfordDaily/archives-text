# Scientists to test new HIV drug
## 
### 
Stanford scientists plan to begin
clinical trials next month on a
promising new drug for controlling
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
If the clinical trials are successful,
the new substance, called HBY 097,
could be an effective tool in stem
ming the spread of HIV. Developed
by Hoechst Ag and Bayer Ag, the
drug will be tested at an additional
four sites in the United States.
The trials will monitor the reduc
tion in virus concentration, the
onset of HFV resistance to the drug
and physical side effects.
Trials are set to begin in late Sep
tember, according to Jane Norris, a
physician assistant working on the
project, and will last for 12 weeks.
Despite promising laboratory re
sults, HBY 097 is only one in a col
lection of anti-viral drugs to treat
HTV — not a stand-alone drug.
''Most of us think a multiple-drug
therapy is probably very soon going
to be standard therapy," said David
Katzenstein, associate medical di
rector of the AIDS Clinical Trials
Group and assistant professor of
medicine in infectious diseases at
Stanford.
HBY 097 is the latest in a family
of non-nucleoside reverse transcrip
tase inhibitors (NNRTI). Previous
NNRTIs, such as nevirapine and
delaviridine, caused the AIDS virus
to mutate quickly into a resistant
strain. The mutated strain propa
gated as quickly as the unmutated
virus and rendered long-term treat
ment ineffective.
HBY 097 is a "second-genera
tion" NNRTI, according to Katzen

stein. Although HBY 097 still causes
HIV to mutate, the most common
mutation it produces replicates
much more slowly than the original
unmutated virus. Thus, it is hoped
the drug will reduce concentration
levels of the AIDS virus in infected
people.
To make copies of itself, the AIDS
virus relies on hooking into the DNA
of a host cell. The virus creates a bi
ological machine, called a reverse
transcriptase enzyme, which attach
es the AIDS virus' genetic informa
tion onto the DNA of the host cell. As
the host cell divides and multiplies, it
creates copies of the AIDS virus'
DNA along with its own. After many
cell divisions, another biological ma
chine converts the AIDS virus DNA
back into the AIDS virus itself.
HBY 097, like previous NNRTIs,
jams the reverse transcriptase en
zyme by latching onto a specific
marker on the enzyme. Without the
reverse transcription enzyme, the
AIDS virus cannot encode itself in
cell DNA and thus cannot replicate.
Unfortunately, the AIDS virus
mutates very easily and rapidly. In
laboratory studies the site onto
which HBY 097 attaches, Codon
190, has tended to mutate until HBY
097 was no longer effective.
However, unlike mutations from
other NNRTIs, the mutated enzyme
that HBY 097 creates is less efficient
at transcribing the virus' genetic in
formation. The mutated AIDS virus
replicates i .self more slowly and, if
no other counteracting mutations
occur, the mutated virus will have a
lower concentration in the body.

In order to track the mutation of
the virus, researchers will first check
specifically for the presence of a mu
tation in the Codon 190. If some
thing other than a Codon 190 muta
tion occurs, a study of the entire ge
netic sequence will be made to better
characterize the virus.
"Our expectation based on hav
ing done this for a number of years is
that the virus is very smart," said
Katzenstein. "There's a whole lot of
it and the question is whether a
change on some other part of the en
zyme will compensate for a [Codon]
190 mutation. Maybe we'll find a
fully resistant virus that's fully vim
lent."
The 12-week trial period was cho
sen because other NNRTIs caused
complete resistance within four to
six weeks. However, the treatment is
so short that no long-term benefits
are expected for participants, said
Katzenstein.
"It's an interesting com promise,"
he continued. "There's a gradual
process before you ever get to any
thing like therapy being offered."
HBY 097 will be administered in
varying doses in combination with
AZT, another type of antiviral treat
ment already approved by the Food
and Drug Administration.
The Clinical Trials Group is look
ing for HIV-positive volunteers with
CD4 counts of between 200 and 500
who have never used an antiviral
treatment. People interested in par
ticipating should contact Norris at
the Medical Center at (415)723-
2805.
