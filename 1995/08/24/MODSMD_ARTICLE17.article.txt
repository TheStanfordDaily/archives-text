# Shopping Center to get facelift
## 
### 
The 40-year-old Stanford Shopping Center, starting
to show signs of its age, is getting a face lift.
New renovations, to be completed in phases through
1997, are now underway at the 70-acre mall.
Recognizing that "things are becoming worn," the
shopping center management hopes to "create an up
dated look," said Carolyn Johnson, assistant director of
the shopping center.
It has been nineyears since the last major project ren
ovated the shopping center with new buildings and fea
tures.
The renovations will include painting the exterior, re
placing awnings, lighting, signs and walkway paving and
adding landscape elements.
"We're trying to keep an elegant earth-tone palette,"
Johnson said of the overall new look.
Renovations in Phase 1 have a price tag of $650,000,
though no budget has been set yet for Phase 2 improve
ments. The Exterior Enhancement Project is being paid
for "by the University out of shopping center income,"
Johnson said.
In Phase 1, begun early this month, painters are giv
ing buildings a light tan coat, to be accented by lighter
ivory tones on steel arches and louvers. New red terra
cotta awnings will be installed on perimeter buildings,
while existing awnings on interior buildings will be re
placed with metal louvers resembling plantation shut
ters.

Phase 1 work, to be completed by mid-October, is
being done nights and early mornings to minimize in
convenience to customers and merchants. The work will
be suspended during busy seasonal periods.
In the second phase, which starts next year, the old
brick pathways meandering throughout the center —
worn from the scurry of shoppers' shoes and stroller
wheels — will be replaced by limestone paving. Some of
the repaving will be completed during the day, although
circulation pathways will be maintained at all times.
In addition, a new system of location and directory
signs will be developed to integrate one look from among
the existing hodgepodge of styles, Johnson said. She
added that the new signs will be more effective in pro
viding information.
Other Phase 2 renovations will also be illuminating
for future customers. Skylights will be installed in cov
ered areas in the shopping center, and the current globe
light fixtures will be replaced with pole- and wall-mount
ed bracket lanterns.
The exterior makeover may increase business insofar
as it will create "an even more attractive and beautiful
place" to shop, she said.
Established in 1956, the shopping center was one of
the first opened in Northern California. It is the Bay
Area's most successful shopping center in volume and
sales per square foot.
