# New Credit Union branch at Tresidder
## 
### 
Students will no longer have to
trek down Pampas Lane to with
draw money from the Stanford
Federal Credit Union when it
opens a new branch on campus
next month.
The new branch, located on the
second floor of Tresidder Union,
will begin operation Sept. 5.
The branch comes on the heels
of a recent agreement between the
University and Wells Fargo Bank
— the credit union's key competi
tor on campus — to utilize the new
universal ID card, which will dou
ble as a Wells Fargo ATM card.
The awkward timing is coinci
dental, however. According to

Dorothea Oregowgki, business de
velopment director at the credit
union, plans for the branch began
more than a year ago.
Gregowski said the credit
union hopes to assure "members
and potential members that we
can provide the services."
In addition, the credit union
will install an ATM in Arbuckle
Lounge at the Graduate School of
Business; the ATM will be avail
able Sept. 27.
With the addition of the new
branch and ATM, the credit union
will operate a total of four branch
es and 11 ATMs on Stanford land.
