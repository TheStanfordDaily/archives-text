# Rollerblades banned inside Green Library
## 
### 
Green Library has expanded its
restrictions to include a form of
transportation popular among
many Stanford students, especially
during the sunny days of summer.
Many campus buildings current
ly require in-line skates to be re
moved and carried upon entering.
However, Green has begun asking
patrons to conceal their skates in a
closed bag or leave them behind the
front counter at their own risk.
Naheed Zaheer, an assistant li
brarian at Green, said the original
access policy was instituted several
years ago to deal with the problem of
skateboards. Now that the popular
Rollerblades have become a com
mon sight among Stanford stu
dents, the regulation has been ex
tended to include them.

"Just like skateboards,
Rollerblacles are loud and create a
disturbance for others in the li
brary," said Zaheer. "Students are
not allowed to carry their
Rollerblades around in the open for
safety reasons. Leaving their skates
in the aisles can pose a risk to others
who are not expecting such obsta
cles on the floor."
Sophomore Leighton Kan said
he understands the need for build
ings to keep peoples from skating
around on the carpeted floors, but
he doesn't see any problem with car
rying his skates around with him in
the open.
"People can trip over book bags
on the floor just as easily as a pair of
Rollerblades," he said.
