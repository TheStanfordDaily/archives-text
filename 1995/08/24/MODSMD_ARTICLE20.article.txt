## Their rooms, your story 
### Melissa Hung 
They look directly at you as you walk
through the gallery. All
except lan P., who is slouched by a wall
of nudie pictures watching TV. Each gaze is
intent, no matter what other emotion the
face seems to betray. The presence in each
room and the rooms themselves exist in a
constant state of change.
Through September 24, at The San Jose
Museum of Art, you are given a chance to
view humanity at its most mysterious stage
— one which many of us are just emerging
from. "Adrienne Salinger: Teenagers in
Their Bedrooms," allows a glimpse into the
bottleneck years where dependence butts
heads with independence.
For seven years we are all termed
teenagers. Those nebulous years when your
role is to "become" and everyone is hoping
"you'll just grow out of it" are brought to life
through these age and awkwardness varied
faces and the one space that is their own.
Some are at the closing of those often
stereotyped years, and some are just begin
ning. Certain rooms have a clear parental
influence, and some seem to have been ter
ritorially marked by the young person star
ing back at you.
The only text accompanying each photo
is a card with a first name and last initial.
With a dearth of information it is impos
sible not to try and guess each person's
story from their expression and possessions.
In a black, form-fitting dress, Latrelle D.
stands secure and trophy-like in a front of a
bureau covered with stuffed animals. Is it be
cause she is proud of the body she is growing
into?
Is Auto C.'s chubbiness baby fat or beer
belly?
Which of them would talk to each other
at school? Do they have brothers and sis
ters?
A little girl sits on the bed next to Lynne
M. The child could be either little sister or
daughter; she holds a black and white pic
ture similar to the one she is in. Lynne has
dark glasses, on and the visibility of her eyes
changes as your body moves in front of the
light source. Is her face serious or content,
or both?
Also hanging in the gallery is a photo of

Jason C. He must belong to these blurry
teen years, even though he looks about 10.
He sits on his bed surrounded by a dog, a
white kitten, and a couple of rodents in their
plastic apartments. He looks as if he were
about to say something.
Whose story?
Adrienne Salinger, an associate profes
sor in the Department of Media Arts at
Syracuse University, met the upstate New
York teens in malls, restaurants, at the
gym, through each other and through
friends. She asked if she could come into
their homes and photograph them in their

rooms, requir
ing only: no
cleaning or
preparing in

Latrelle D.

any way and no parents. Of the 40 who
agreed, we are allowed access to the rooms
and faces of 25 in the form of large 30-inch
by 40-inch color photographs.
Each photo shoot lasted approximately
four hours, with two hours occupied by a
videotaped interview. As the series evolved,
it began to make sense to do a book. The re
cently published result, "In My Room:
Teenagers In Their Bedrooms," sits at the
entryway to the exhibit.
The book is a completely different expe
rience from the show. Next to each photo
are a couple of paragraphs from the inter
view, and at the end of the book is a "where
they are now" blurb.
Salinger is aware that her presence is in
each picture, through framing, lighting,
perspective and pose. The bodies of some of
the teens betray a discomfort difficult to
pinpoint. Is it a result of these years they
don't quite know how to fit or the stranger
with the onslaught of camera gear in the
room? A placard displays Salinger's words
of caution: "Perhaps I'm telling my own sto
ries as well as the teenagers'."
As museumgoers gaze at each photo, a vi
sual version of the childhood game "tele
phone" continues. Although the large pho
tographs allow you to comb the individual
bedrooms for clues, the conclusions you have
drawn from the pack of cigarettes on the
dresser or the abundance of hair-care prod
ucts seem to contain mostly your own
truths.
This was sne of the reasons that Chief

Curator Peter Gordon decided against post
ing excerpts from Salinger's interviews
with the teens. Citing Salinger's own refer
ences to the fictive impact of her presence,
he is suspicious of taking a couple of para
graphs from a two-hour-long interview. Did
the teens say what they thought she would
like to hear? Did Salinger pick certain state
ments for their dramatic interest?
"It would be fiction squared," Gordon ex
plained, admitting at the same time that
text omission allowed him extra wall space
to hang more of Salinger's photos.
And his greed is understandable. Dis
played without the text, the immediacy of
each photo emerges. You can see things in
the full-size photos that you can't in the
book. Each photograph stands on its own,
with the impact of each increased by its re
lation to the others.
As intended, the exhibit is an entity in it
self, not a book on the wall. Arranged by
Gordon with casual thematic and formal re
gard, the photos tend to alternate by sex. He
had fun setting up little tensions and find
ing things that resonated between pho
tographs but was careful not to push differ-

ences or similarities too much.
Comically overillustrating
the point, he said, "I could have
put all the guitar players togeth
er, but that would have been too

Leslie M.

much."
He has attempted to maintain
the delicate balance between pre
senting the artist's intent and
adding a little rhythm and pacing,
noting that "every person would
have set it up a little bit differ
ent."
Happy coincidences
Gordon first became acquainted
with Salinger's work in 1990
when a Leslie M. showed up on his
desk on an invitation. He was
struck by the image and for years,
doing the show has been on his
"wish list." The opportunity did
not occur until this year.
The timing has been surprising
ly appropriate.
"Patssi Valdez: A Room of One's
Own," the show concurrently

running in the other second-floor, side-wing
gallery, coincidentally also has a "room-as
extension-of-self" theme. Gordon said the
correspondence was completely unplanned,
that "the room idea just sort of happened."
The recent publication of Salinger's
book, "In My Room: Teenagers In Their
Bedrooms" by Chronicle Books was also a
happy coincidence.
As was the summer opening of Larry
Clark's controversial movie "Kids." Al
though discussing the same issue, "Kids"
and "Adrienne Salinger: Teenagers in Their
Bedrooms," take very different approaches.
The similar theme has caused much com
parison between the two artistic endeavors.
The San Jose Museum of Art has taken ad
vantage of this and teamed up with Camera
One Movie Theater in San Jose to offer mu
tual discounts.
Acknowledging that he is far removed
from any teenage contact at this point,
Gordon feels that the Salinger exhibit de
nies any attempt to stereotype
"teenagers," whereas "Kids" gives a less
diverse portrayal.
The only downside to presenting the ex
hibit this summer is that schools are not in
session. Gordon had had visions of "teen do
cents taking tours of teens through a show a
about teens." Unfortunately, the show could
only have corresponded with the academic
schedule if it had been delayed until 1997.
Still, the percentage of younger museum
goers has noticeably increased since the
opening of the exhibit. Without a school bus

Happy coincidences
Gordon first became acquainted
with Salinger's work in 1990
when a Leslie M. showed up on his
desk on an invitation. He was
struck by the image and for years,
doing the show has been on his
"wish list." The opportunity did
not occur until this year.
The timing has been surprising
ly appropriate.
"Patssi Valdez: A Room of One's
Own," the show concurrently

running in the other second-floor, side-wing
gallery, coincidentally also has a "room-as
extension-of-self" theme. Gordon said the
correspondence was completely unplanned,
that "the room idea just sort of happened."
The recent publication of Salinger's
book, "In My Room: Teenagers In Their
Bedrooms" by Chronicle Books was also a
happy coincidence.
As was the summer opening of Larry
Clark's controversial movie "Kids." Al
though discussing the same issue, "Kids"
and "Adrienne Salinger: Teenagers in Their
Bedrooms," take very different approaches.
The similar theme has caused much com
parison between the two artistic endeavors.
The San Jose Museum of Art has taken ad
vantage of this and teamed up with Camera
One Movie Theater in San Jose to offer mu
tual discounts.
Acknowledging that he is far removed
from any teenage contact at this point,
Gordon feels that the Salinger exhibit de
nies any attempt to stereotype
"teenagers," whereas "Kids" gives a less
diverse portrayal.
The only downside to presenting the ex
hibit this summer is that schools are not in
session. Gordon had had visions of "teen do
cents taking tours of teens through a show a
about teens." Unfortunately, the show could
only have corresponded with the academic
schedule if it had been delayed until 1997.
Still, the percentage of younger museum
goers has noticeably increased since the
opening of the exhibit. Without a school bus

They look directly at you as you walk
through the gallery. All
except lan P., who is slouched by a wall
of nudie pictures watching TV. Each gaze is
intent, no matter what other emotion the
face seems to betray. The presence in each
room and the rooms themselves exist in a
constant state of change.
Through September 24, at The San Jose
Museum of Art, you are given a chance to
view humanity at its most mysterious stage
— one which many of us are just emerging
from. "Adrienne Salinger: Teenagers in
Their Bedrooms," allows a glimpse into the
bottleneck years where dependence butts
heads with independence.
For seven years we are all termed
teenagers. Those nebulous years when your
role is to "become" and everyone is hoping
"you'll just grow out of it" are brought to life
through these age and awkwardness varied
faces and the one space that is their own.
Some are at the closing of those often
stereotyped years, and some are just begin
ning. Certain rooms have a clear parental
influence, and some seem to have been ter
ritorially marked by the young person star
ing back at you.
The only text accompanying each photo
is a card with a first name and last initial.
With a dearth of information it is impos
sible not to try and guess each person's
story from their expression and possessions.
In a black, form-fitting dress, Latrelle D.
stands secure and trophy-like in a front of a
bureau covered with stuffed animals. Is it be
cause she is proud of the body she is growing
into?
Is Auto C.'s chubbiness baby fat or beer
belly?
Which of them would talk to each other
at school? Do they have brothers and sis
ters?
A little girl sits on the bed next to Lynne
M. The child could be either little sister or
daughter; she holds a black and white pic
ture similar to the one she is in. Lynne has
dark glasses, on and the visibility of her eyes
changes as your body moves in front of the
light source. Is her face serious or content,
or both?
Also hanging in the gallery is a photo of

Jason C. He must belong to these blurry
teen years, even though he looks about 10.
He sits on his bed surrounded by a dog, a
white kitten, and a couple of rodents in their
plastic apartments. He looks as if he were
about to say something.
Whose story?
Adrienne Salinger, an associate profes
sor in the Department of Media Arts at
Syracuse University, met the upstate New
York teens in malls, restaurants, at the
gym, through each other and through
friends. She asked if she could come into
their homes and photograph them in their

rooms, requir
ing only: no
cleaning or
preparing in

Latrelle D.

any way and no parents. Of the 40 who
agreed, we are allowed access to the rooms
and faces of 25 in the form of large 30-inch
by 40-inch color photographs.
Each photo shoot lasted approximately
four hours, with two hours occupied by a
videotaped interview. As the series evolved,
it began to make sense to do a book. The re
cently published result, "In My Room:
Teenagers In Their Bedrooms," sits at the
entryway to the exhibit.
The book is a completely different expe
rience from the show. Next to each photo
are a couple of paragraphs from the inter
view, and at the end of the book is a "where
they are now" blurb.
Salinger is aware that her presence is in
each picture, through framing, lighting,
perspective and pose. The bodies of some of
the teens betray a discomfort difficult to
pinpoint. Is it a result of these years they
don't quite know how to fit or the stranger
with the onslaught of camera gear in the
room? A placard displays Salinger's words
of caution: "Perhaps I'm telling my own sto
ries as well as the teenagers'."
As museumgoers gaze at each photo, a vi
sual version of the childhood game "tele
phone" continues. Although the large pho
tographs allow you to comb the individual
bedrooms for clues, the conclusions you have
drawn from the pack of cigarettes on the
dresser or the abundance of hair-care prod
ucts seem to contain mostly your own
truths.
This was sne of the reasons that Chief

Curator Peter Gordon decided against post
ing excerpts from Salinger's interviews
with the teens. Citing Salinger's own refer
ences to the fictive impact of her presence,
he is suspicious of taking a couple of para
graphs from a two-hour-long interview. Did
the teens say what they thought she would
like to hear? Did Salinger pick certain state
ments for their dramatic interest?
"It would be fiction squared," Gordon ex
plained, admitting at the same time that
text omission allowed him extra wall space
to hang more of Salinger's photos.
And his greed is understandable. Dis
played without the text, the immediacy of
each photo emerges. You can see things in
the full-size photos that you can't in the
book. Each photograph stands on its own,
with the impact of each increased by its re
lation to the others.
As intended, the exhibit is an entity in it
self, not a book on the wall. Arranged by
Gordon with casual thematic and formal re
gard, the photos tend to alternate by sex. He
had fun setting up little tensions and find
ing things that resonated between pho
tographs but was careful not to push differ-

ences or similarities too much.
Comically overillustrating
the point, he said, "I could have
put all the guitar players togeth
er, but that would have been too

Leslie M.

much."
He has attempted to maintain
the delicate balance between pre
senting the artist's intent and
adding a little rhythm and pacing,
noting that "every person would
have set it up a little bit differ
ent."
