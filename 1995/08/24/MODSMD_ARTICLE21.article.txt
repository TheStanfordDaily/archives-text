# FEATURE FLICKS
## The 						Brothers McMullen 
### 
An Irish flute pipes out a folksy
Celtic tune as the opening credits
to this Marlboro Road Gang Pro-

duction roll. The low-budget, surprise
smash hit hasn't even started yet, and
screenwriter / director / actor Edward
Burns has already set the tone for the no
frills candor that makes his tell-it-like-it-is
romantic comedy so refreshingly original.
Set in the same working class Long Is
land neighborhood in which Burns himself
grew up, "The Brothers McMullen" looks
and laughs at the joys and trials of love and
all the ways we strive for and avoid it.
As close as the brothers are to each other,
their approaches to love-life crises couldn't
be more divergent. Each abides by his own
distinct list of rules, either obeying, reject
ing, or ignoring those of the Roman Catholic
Church — an institution which plays a for
mative role in the philosophies they develop
about sex, their family, themselves and who
they are becoming.
Happily married Jack (Jack Mulcahy)
wrestles with the temptation of cheating on
his wife, then wonders just how offensive
the Pope would find his adultery. In a
quandary about the implications of such a
sin, he goes to his "altar boy" brother
Patrick (Mike McGlone) for advice.
Of all the film's many impressive perfor
mances, McGlone's steals first prize for the
character most wrenched by conflicts be
tween desire and obligation. The advice he
gives his brothers is always some version of

his unerring (or almost unerring) loyalty to
Catholicism. "Hey," he says, "repression
isn't such a bad thing."
Unbending as his deference to religion
may be. Patrick is a "fruitcake" romantic

whose heart often tricks his head into
amending the rigid rules to which he feels
unconditionally bound. His painful gri
maces are wonderfully convincing portraits
of a soul torn against itself. Listening to him

brood over each new reason why he is going
to hell gets more hilarious as he becomes
more terrified by the possible repercussions
of his mistakes.
In sharp and amusing contrast, Barrv
(Burns) avoids emotional attachment as if it
were an incurable disease. With well-prac
ticed resilience, he calls Patrick's lonely
confusion the "when-will-I-get-laid-again
blues" and reassures him that getting the
ax is far preferable to getting a ring.
Barry confesses that his true love is the
no-strings freedom of bachelorhood. Then
Audrey (played by Burns' girlfriend. iMax
ine Bahns) takes his fear of commitment for
a spin that makes him rethink his slash
and-burn philosophy of dumping girlfriends
before they peel away too much of his pro
tective shield of manhood (his "bright phal
lic" banana theory is brilliantly humorous).
Audrey is the film's only bothersome
shortcoming. Evidently over conscious of
the camera, Bahns gives an adequate but
noticeably nervous performance. She may
have been Burns' inspiration for the role,
but her screen presence makes the film's
spotlight romance seem both awkward and
improbable. Somehow, she seems undeserv
ing of Barry's attractive and ironically
charming charisma.
Nonetheless, it all works like a charm.
Absent of the slightest hint of predictable
sappiness, the plot surmounts its conflict
and concludes before you're ready for the
story to end.
As you're wishing the movie weren't
over, the final credits roll to Sarah McLach
lan's "I Will Remember You" — a fitting
tribute to a truly memorable film.
