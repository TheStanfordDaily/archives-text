# Unzipped

### 
In 76 minutes, "Unzipped"
zips through the whirlwind res
urrection of fashion-design wun
derkind Isaac Mizrahi, whose

spring collection, at the movie's start, has
just gotten slammed by the fashion press.
Inspired by "Nanook of the North" (the
chief of many eclectic pop inspirations),
Mizrahi stakes his comeback on fur and the
faith that his Eskimo stylings will overcome
a popular aversion "that's about women not
wanting to look like cows."
It is a trying task. Mizrahi draws and de
signs, selects swatches, books the catwalk
ers, coaxes übermodels into changing be
hind a transparent scrim, gets "nanooked"
when Jean-Paul Gaultier goes Eskimo and
finally triumphs with a resplendent and
well-received show. In the end, he returns to
the newsstand where he had stood dejected
months earlier; this time, however, the re
views glow.

As a documentary, "Unzipped" is itself a
fascinating scrim. The peek into the fashion
industry gives a good feel for the scramble
and thrill of production, while New York
City and the bill's boastings (Cindy Craw
ford, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Linda
Evangelista) lend their own inherent thrills.
The movie's real draw, however, is
Mizrahi. Animated, driven, and good-spirit
ed, he makes for a refreshingly likable sub
ject. It is nice to see him succeed.
Much of "Unzipped" is shot in a grainy
black-and-white (with the final production
appropriately done in color), and the skittish
camera work matches Mizrahi's own frenet
ic pace — as does a jazzy back track which
keeps the story moving along.
Interspersed TV clips illustrate his pop
culture references while interviews with his
mother chart his passion for clothes. The
final cinematographic product is, like
Mizrahi's clothes, a mishmash of styles and
techniques.
All in all, it's a neat little movie.
