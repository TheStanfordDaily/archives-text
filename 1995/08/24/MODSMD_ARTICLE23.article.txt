## Luna Penthouse 
### 
With "Penthouse," their third
full-length release, Luna once again
delivers a daring package of music in

that slick, unpretentious style that won
them acclaim in their previous two albums.
Everything that makes Luna's music en
dearing is here again in the 11 tracks on
"Penthouse": that urbane, distracted, yet
soulful twang of Dean Wareham's vocals,
and those delightfully opaque lyrics: "And
at the Sideshow by the Seashore / The girls
are dressed as mermaids / An electrical
storm / has caught us in a trap."
Wareham is propelled along by Feelies
alumnus Stanley Demeski on drums, Sean
Eden on guitar and a remarkably versatile
Justin Harwood on bass. Far more than just
an acoustic section, Demeski, Eden and
Harwood are clearly in no danger of becom
ing "those other three guys in the band."
"Penthouse" draws on an eclectic mix of
musical influences. Echoes linger from
Wareham's old band, turn-of-the decade rev

olutionaries Galaxie 500. And as if Luna's
first two efforts hadn't already drawn more
than enough comparisons to the Velvet Un
derground, here, too, the band consciously
or unconsciously continues its homage to the
Velvets throughout the album.
On "Double Feature," Wareham sings
the wonderfully understated lyrics in a Joy-
Divisionish drone: "Over and over / It's a
merry-go-round / It changed all by itself /

Don't you say that I'm
unkind."
Let no one say,
though, that Luna's
style is a mere imitation
of past greatness. Every
song on the album
seems to celebrate the
band's love of experi
mentation, from the
dreamy "Moon Palace"
to the powerfully driven
"23 Minutes in Brus
sels."
No matter which
mode they choose — the
edginess of "Double

Feature" or the mellow
placidity of "Kalamazoo" — the band can
seemingly do no wrong. If there is a weak
spot on the album, it's "Hedgehog," an un
characteristic moment of superficiality on
an otherwise strong album.
One of the most pleasant surprises on
"Penthouse" is an unlisted 11th track
where the band offers a rendition of "Bon
nie and Clyde," a song by the late French

pop star Serge Gainsbourg. The guest vocal
ist is none other than Stereolab's Laetitia
Sadier. Aside from the track's technical
merit, it's worth it just to hear Wareham
sing in French.
As on the first two albums, 1992's "Lu
napark" and 1994's "Bewitched," the songs
on "Penthouse" seem to complement one
another to form a coherent whole; they
achieve the kind of unity that's the mark of
a well-produced set. Overall it's a remark
able album, better perhaps than either of its
two predecessors.
While some might have doubted Luna
could match the

quality of their
first two exquis
ite albums for a
third time, with
"Penthouse" the
band proves that
there's no end in
sight to its dar
ing, original, and
eminently listen
able sound.
