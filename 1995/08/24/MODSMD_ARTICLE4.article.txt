## The 						Stanford Weekly Editor's farewell 
### 
Don't let go of those
small moments that
made your summer

THE PECULIAR tradi
tions of The Stanford
Daily require that each
editor, at the end of his or her
term, pen a "farewell" message
to appeal- in the editorial col
umn: what you're reading now.
In a sense, it's strange. I'm not
leaving campus. I'm not even
leaving The Daily — after a
brief vacation I'll be right back
here helping The Daily prepare
for fall quarter.
What I am leaving, though,
is the editor's office, the cozy
room in the back of The Daily
where lies the power and re
sponsibility to shape the direc
tion of the campus newspaper
and, ideally, campus life in gen
eral.
In many way's the editor's
chair is the most comfortable
one in our office — maybe if
you drop by sometime we'll let
you tiy it out. But like many
past editors, I've tried to spend
as little time as possible sitting
in that chair, electing instead to
be out in the thick of things,
participating in rather than
merely directing the opera
tions of the paper.
A few short weeks ago, I set
out with an inexperienced yet
eager staff to put out a fair and
accurate paper that both re
flects and contributes to life on
campus and in the surround
ing community. It's been tough
at times, but looking back, I
would say we've succeeded.
But that judgment is, of
course, not mine to make. You,
our readers, must decide for
yourselves whether we have
achieved what we set out to do.
Producing a newspaper is a
unique endeavor in that its
product is a volatile, transient
thing. A reader might some
times clip an interesting article
or save an issue for an archive,

but in general, most people
keep a newspaper only until
the next issue comes out, oi
until the next recycling pickup,
or until the next time the dog
does his business.
Later this week, I will sit in
the editor's chair one more
time and reflect a little on these
past nine weeks before I pre
pare to pass the torch on to our
fall staff. Not much later, after
this issue has been swept away
from distribution racks, dorm
rooms, offices, cafe tables, all
record of my tenure as editor
will be gone, save for a few
archived copies in the Daily of
fices and the depths of Stan
ford library system.
At the risk of overaggrandiz
ing my work this summer, I
would venture to say that a
newspaper is a lot like the
world it is supposed to reflect
— ever-present, yet always
fleeting, a progression of singu
lar events of varying impor
tance. Yet strangely, it is these
moments that give continuity
and meaning to our existence.
Tradition demands that this
editor's farewell contain at
least an attempt at some advice
on life and how to live it. And
so, to that end, and in the des
perate hope of keeping my
summer's work alive in some
way, I implore you not to forget
the events of tfyis summer,
whether they were events re
ported in The Weekly, on CNN
or in that secret journal in your
desk drawer, or all three.
What you and I have done
this summer, and the struggles
we have faced, real and imag
ined, trivial and world-chang
ing, are more than just resume
items or anecdotes. They are
experiences, part of a wonder
ful past that enriches our lives
immeasurably. With that, I say
farewell, and thanks for read
ing.
