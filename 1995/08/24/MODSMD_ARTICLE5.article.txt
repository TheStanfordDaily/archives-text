## The 						changes of fall 
### 
THERE IS A phase of human
psychological development
mentioned in the Human Bi
ology core that refers to a time
when young people consider them
selves actors in an elaborate and
dramatic production. These indi
viduals find their lives flooded with
powerful events and emotions, and
a fascinated audience of peers and
relatives watches every scene.
I don't know whether this stage
is more likely to occur during a
particular season, but I would
guess if it were it would be during
the fall.
Don't deny it — summer is
over. Nighttime engulfs the week
end barbecues much faster, slick
advertising jingles like "Back to
Cool" litter the newspaper, and I
haven't heard the echoes of
"We've got the spirit, yeah, yeah!"
peeling from Wilbur Field for at
least a week. Along with these
turning points in the year comes
the time to reflect on the snap
shots and ticket stubs of the sum
mer. We also spend this time be
ginning our trek back to the the
ater described above.
Surrounded by pals in a Roble
quad or staring at the walls of a
stark Kimball single, the curtain

rises and we reassume our roles.
This change is fed by that part of us
that tells us that those around us
are constantly observing us, caring
about our deeds and the words we
speak each day. We are again ac
knowledged by the campus world
as organizers, writers, politicians
and the like — tremendously im
portant figures.
One of the drawbacks of this
transformation is the loss of the
summertime environment. The
gentle, long days that nudged a
person to try something different,
to live as desired and not as expect
ed, rapidly dissolve. This era is re
placed by neatly filled pages of fam
ily planners boasting rainbows of
highlighter ink and ribbons of ex
clamation points on sticky paper
squares screaming about what is
due, where to go, who to be.
Another, more sobering reality
of merging into this fast lane is the
fallacy of this notion of self-impor
tance, of playing on Life's stage be
fore scores of others. Sorry, Daily
columnists of yesterday and oth
ers, but most folks simply do not
care that much about the wrinkles
in your life, your lost love, the job
you got or how drunk you got last
weekend. The guy in line behind

you at the Coffeehouse isn't listen
ing to your story, and most
passersby will notice whether you
have paper and a pencil on your
door to leave a note for a guy down
the hall long before they see the
collage of photos and comic strips
you carefully placed there.
These thoughts may not reach
a large number of people. The indi
viduals of whom I speak are those
who experimented this summer,
perhaps because there was no one
around to observe them or tease
them for what they did or how well
they did it. Maybe these endeavors
were minor, or unsuccessful: you
couldn't quite figure out how to fix
the gear shifters, or you still smack
your jump serve way past the end
line. This doesn't matter. The cru
cial point is that efforts were made
to live as desired, and now is the
crucial time to either keep that
self-assuredness or risk losing it
amidst an imagined crowd of wary
onlookers. The audience for this
play is only you, but there is no ob
server more important.

Thanks Bel, E. Sato and to E. Hsi
for helping to cope with It.
