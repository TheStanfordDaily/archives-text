# Business School lends manpower to public sector
## Internship fund encourages graduate students to forego the private sector and work at nonprofits 
### Bobby Chen Contributing writer 
For Stanford students, summer usually
means employment that provides experi
ence and some extra cash for the school
year. Yet some students at the Graduate
School of Business opt to forego the larger
salaries offered by most private-sector in
ternships.
Instead, they choose to bring their man
agerial expertise to nonprofit organiza
tions. Helping them in that endeavor is the
Stanford Management Internship Fund,
which encourages business students to ex
plore and pursue summer jobs in the public
sector by providing them with additional
funding.
Jim Thompson, director of the Business
School's Public Management Program,
said that SMIF provides a lot of benefits to
both students and the nonprofit organiza
tions for whom they work.
"The students add a marketing and fi
nancial perspective to the organization's
business management," he said. "Often,
these nonprofit organizations have busi
ness problems which the students can help
alleviate. Also, the students get a wonderful
opportunity to see how the nonprofit sector
works."
SMIF interns have been involved in a va
riety of managerial positions. They are re
cruited by nonprofit organizations such as
Yosemite National Park, the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the Rainforest Alliance and
Care International in Vietnam.
SMIF was founded in 1981 to encourage
Stanford MBA students to seek summer op
portunities in the public and nonprofit sec
tors. It provides a stipend that allows stu
dents working for nonprofit organizations
to earn approximately 60 percent of the av

erage summer salary in private-sector jobs.
According to Thompson, the average
student working in the private sector re
ceives roughly $10,000 for 10 weeks of work
during the summer. SMIF provides a
stipend to students working in the public
sector that brings their salaries up to about
$6,000 for a 10-week internship.
"For example, if a student working at a
nonprofit organization earned $300 a week,
SMIF would match the salary by providing
an additional $300 per week," he said.
Thompson said SMIF is primarily fund
ed by other Business School students.
Those who work with private businesses
during the summer voluntarily contribute
1 to 2 percent of their summer income to
help fund the SMIF stipends. Between 80
and 90 percent of Business School students
contribute money to SMIF each year.
Alumni, faculty and staff also donate addi
tional money to SMIF.
Co-chair Cheryl Zando, who will be a sec
ond-year business student in the fall, said
approximately 15 students are being subsi
dized this year. Her own work with Save the
Children is being funded by SMIF.
She credits SMIF as one of the reasons
why she decided to attend business school
at Stanford.
"I was very interested in working for a
nonprofit organization this summer," she
said. "Without SMIF, it would have been fi
nancially difficult to choose that option."
Zando believes the nonprofit experience
helps even those who don't intend to work
in the public sector after obtaining their
MBAs.
"Many people in business will eventually
get the chance to serve on the board for a
nonprofit organization, regardless of where
they work after graduation," she said.
SMIF treasurer Gerald Wluka, who will

be a second-year business student in Sep
tember, said that extensive fundraising for
the program occurs throughout the school
year.
"We hold a big spring event to solicit
pledges from students and faculty," he said.
"Also, much of winter quarter is spent edu
cating the first-years about SMIF and how
it can help them in their summer employ

ment search."
According to Wluka, first-year business
students who intend to work in the private
sector during the summer usually pledge ei
ther a fixed amount or the equivalent of one
day's salary to SMIF.
"SMIF also gets some grants from out
side foundations and several thousand dol
