# Solar Car team races to impressive finish in Japan
## Despite a sharp decline in numbers, project finishes fifth in a three-day collegiate and international race 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
For many people, the solar car seems to
be merely a far-fetched idea, a novelty that
belongs only in the distant future. Howev
er, for a group of nine dedicated students at
the Stanford Solar Car Project, that far
fetched idea is an absorbing reality.
The Solar Car Project team recently fin
ished fifth in a three-day race in Suzuka,
Japan, near Nagoya. The race, sponsored by
the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun,
took place Aug. 4 to 6, and consisted of 60
teams, including cars from Honda and Nis
san as well as college teams from UC-Berke
ley and George Washington University.
The team had been invited by Yomiuri
Shimbun in hopes of attracting some Amer
ican teams to a race that consisted mostly of
Japanese teams. The newspaper paid all ex
penses for five students.
According to junior John Angwin, the
team's strong finish was no small accom
plishment.
"They did a really great job considering
the constraints," said Angwin, who was not
able to go to Japan. "We were racing mostly
against corporations who had large budgets
and large teams, and our crew was pretty
small."
The team had gone to Japan not expect
ing too much.
"We were thinking of the race as an op
portunity to go to Japan and get some expe
rience; we weren't expecting to do so well,"

said senior lan Hutagalung. "Then when
we finished third in the preliminary heat we
started taking it more seriously."
The Japanese race consisted of three
heats lasting three hours each, with the
purpose being to race as many laps as possi
ble around the Suzuka Circuit race track.
Although the group was initially unsure
how the car would perform, the team man
aged to complete 66 laps.

"We didn't have much time to prepare,
and we had never competed in this race be
fore," Hutagalung said.
The car involved in the race was the
Solar Car Project's Afterburner, the third
solar car built by the project.
Planning for Afterburner's design start
ed in the spring of 1994. By last summer,
three different scale models were construct
ed.

One of the initial tasks was to design a
car that would have the least amount of sur
face area. After some deliberation, the
group finally chose a design that was con
ceived by Stephen Morris, an engineering
research associate in the Department (If
Aeronautics and Astronautics.
By September, plans were sent to Boein
Co. and the car's molds were constructed 1
In late December, the group assembled the
interior, the suspension and the chassis.
The car's inner portion comprises the
brake, the accelerator and a steering wheel
6 1/2 inches in diameter. The car's batteries
are connected to the side of the car. At
tached to the chassis are the car's two front
wheels and a third rear wheel. The tires are
bicycle racing wheels, which give minimum
rolling resistance.
One of the problems the group faced
early on was a shortage of people. The first
meeting in the spring last year attracted 60
enthusiastic students, but as time passed,
interest waned and people began to drop
out.
In the end, only nine students remained
and members of the group began putting
more and more time into the project.
"There were times I'd work 80 hours a
week on the car," said Dorian West, a me
chanical engineering major who has been
with the project for more than two years.

the car. Together with the driver, the car
weighs 850 pounds; its top speed is about
40 mph. The solar panels, consisting of 4-
inch solar cells soldered together, are at
tached to the top of the outer shell.
Solar cells, which produce approximate
ly 1,000 watts per square meter, can range
anywhere from 10 percent to 20 percent ef
ficiency. Due to cost considerations, the
team chose cells with an efficiency of 14
percent.
The solar panels, which were assembled
by an outside firm, convert the sun's ener
gy it to electricity to power the car's 10-
horsepower motor. The car also has a de
vice called a peak power tracker which opti
mizes the sun's rays and makes the solar
panels work as efficiently as possible. On a
cloudy day, the energy must be drawn pri
marily from the electricity stored in the
car's two batteries.
The SSCP began in 1988 and has since
built three cars, the Sunburner, the SUn-
SUrfer and, most recently, the Afterburn
er, which was built for Sunrayce 1995, a 10-
day, 1,200 mile solar car race from Indi
anapolis to Denver.
The last few weeks before the Sunrayce
were spent test driving and fine-tuning the
car. The race began on June 20 and for the

first two days, everything ran smoothly.
However, the team soon ran into a few
problems. First there were problems with
the car's motor, so the project had to get a
replacement sent to them from UC-Berke
ley's solar car team, which wasn't partici
pating in the race.
Then they started having problems with
the solar panels. The solar cells were over
lapping when they were soldered together,
and they shorted out. Instead of 14 percent
efficiency, the cells were functioning at 10
percent to 11 percent efficiency.
The race slowed down for the next four
days as it began to get more cloudy, and the
team fell into 12th place. Then on the night
before the last day, June 29, the team ran
into a bit of luck. It was uncertain whether
the next day would be sunny or cloudy, and
the various teams were debating whether
to use all their battery power or not.
"We decided to save some of our power,
and there was a big argument over that,"
West said.
Luckily for the Stanford team, the next
day was cloudy and they were able to finish
in fifth place.
In spite of the team's strong finish in
Japan and in the Sunrayce, the future of
the Solar Car Project is still up in the air,
according to Hutagalung.
"Some of the team members are gradu
ating, and we'll have to see whether the en
gineering department will approve our pro
ject for next year," he said.

SUrfer and, most recently, the Afterburn
er, which was built for Sunrayce 1995, a 10-
day, 1,200 mile solar car race from Indi
anapolis to Denver.
The last few weeks before the Sunrayce
were spent test driving and fine-tuning the
car. The race began on June 20 and for the

first two days, everything ran smoothly.
However, the team soon ran into a few
problems. First there were problems with
the car's motor, so the project had to get a
replacement sent to them from UC-Berke
ley's solar car team, which wasn't partici
pating in the race.
Then they started having problems with
the solar panels. The solar cells were over
lapping when they were soldered together,
and they shorted out. Instead of 14 percent
efficiency, the cells were functioning at 10
percent to 11 percent efficiency.
The race slowed down for the next four
days as it began to get more cloudy, and the
team fell into 12th place. Then on the night
before the last day, June 29, the team ran
into a bit of luck. It was uncertain whether
the next day would be sunny or cloudy, and
the various teams were debating whether
to use all their battery power or not.
"We decided to save some of our power,
and there was a big argument over that,"
West said.
Luckily for the Stanford team, the next
day was cloudy and they were able to finish
in fifth place.
In spite of the team's strong finish in
Japan and in the Sunrayce, the future of
the Solar Car Project is still up in the air,
according to Hutagalung.
"Some of the team members are gradu
ating, and we'll have to see whether the en
gineering department will approve our pro
ject for next year," he said.
