# Solar Car team races to impressive finish in Japan
## Despite a sharp decline in numbers, project finishes fifth in a three-day collegiate and international race 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
For many people, the solar car seems to
be merely a far-fetched idea, a novelty that
belongs only in the distant future. Howev
er, for a group of nine dedicated students at
the Stanford Solar Car Project, that far
fetched idea is an absorbing reality.
The Solar Car Project team recently fin
ished fifth in a three-day race in Suzuka,
Japan, near Nagoya. The race, sponsored by
the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun,
took place Aug. 4 to 6, and consisted of 60
teams, including cars from Honda and Nis
san as well as college teams from UC-Berke
ley and George Washington University.
The team had been invited by Yomiuri
Shimbun in hopes of attracting some Amer
ican teams to a race that consisted mostly of
Japanese teams. The newspaper paid all ex
penses for five students.
According to junior John Angwin, the
team's strong finish was no small accom
plishment.
"They did a really great job considering
the constraints," said Angwin, who was not
able to go to Japan. "We were racing mostly
against corporations who had large budgets
and large teams, and our crew was pretty
small."
The team had gone to Japan not expect
ing too much.
"We were thinking of the race as an op
portunity to go to Japan and get some expe
rience; we weren't expecting to do so well,"

said senior lan Hutagalung. "Then when
we finished third in the preliminary heat we
started taking it more seriously."
The Japanese race consisted of three
heats lasting three hours each, with the
purpose being to race as many laps as possi
ble around the Suzuka Circuit race track.
Although the group was initially unsure
how the car would perform, the team man
aged to complete 66 laps.

"We didn't have much time to prepare,
and we had never competed in this race be
fore," Hutagalung said.
The car involved in the race was the
Solar Car Project's Afterburner, the third
solar car built by the project.
Planning for Afterburner's design start
ed in the spring of 1994. By last summer,
three different scale models were construct
ed.

One of the initial tasks was to design a
car that would have the least amount of sur
face area. After some deliberation, the
group finally chose a design that was con
ceived by Stephen Morris, an engineering
research associate in the Department (If
Aeronautics and Astronautics.
By September, plans were sent to Boein
Co. and the car's molds were constructed 1
In late December, the group assembled the
interior, the suspension and the chassis.
The car's inner portion comprises the
brake, the accelerator and a steering wheel
6 1/2 inches in diameter. The car's batteries
are connected to the side of the car. At
tached to the chassis are the car's two front
wheels and a third rear wheel. The tires are
bicycle racing wheels, which give minimum
rolling resistance.
One of the problems the group faced
early on was a shortage of people. The first
meeting in the spring last year attracted 60
enthusiastic students, but as time passed,
interest waned and people began to drop
out.
In the end, only nine students remained
and members of the group began putting
more and more time into the project.
"There were times I'd work 80 hours a
week on the car," said Dorian West, a me
chanical engineering major who has been
with the project for more than two years.
By the middle of March, the team began
constructing the outer shell and the ribs of
