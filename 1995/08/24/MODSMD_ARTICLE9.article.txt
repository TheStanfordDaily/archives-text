## Big changes, big hopes for Cardinal as Willingham takes charge 
### Emery Chen Editorial staff 
It was time for a new identity.
The Stanford football team arrived at a
crisis after last season. The Cardinal were
considered Rose Bowl favorites, but the
squad finished last. A Heisman candidate
led one of the best offenses in the country,
but the defense gave up the most points in
the Pacific-10 Conference. The most obvi
ous sign came when the big-name head
coach appeared to lose control of the team â€”
and his interest in coaching.
Stanford suffered through a 3-7-1 season
which was marked by blowouts, disappoint
ments and tension between the upper and
underclassmen. Change was needed, and
the Cardinal wasted little time.
When the gun was fired to mark the end
of Big Game and the end of the season Nov.
19, many of the on-field leaders played their
final college game. Graduation ensured a
large turnover of players in the starting line
up, but more changes were in store.
Nine days later, Bill Walsh held a press
conference to announce his resignation as
head coach. This action had its own reper
cussions as the anticipated influx of new
coaches occurred and Scott Frost, the start
ing quarterback in the final two games after
the injury to Steve Stenstrom, transferred.
Taking the helm
Into the fold stepped Tyrone Willingham.
Willingham, a former assistant coach for
Stanford under Dennis Green, was culled
from Green's Minnesota Vikings coaching
staff to lead the Cardinal program. The hir
ing of Willingham, who was known for his
leadership and character, was seen by many
as an attempt to restore order to the Stan
ford football team.
One of his first priorities was to stop team
dissension, and he was unequivocal in his
actions.
"If it is an obvious problem, I have to ad
dress it," Willingham said. "I think it was a
serious problem."
Freshmen and sophomores, who were re
cruited by Walsh, played an integral role in
the last two seasons, and some older players
were unhappy with the situation.
"The past two years, with the under
classmen coming in and being treated the
way they were, the team kind of separated,"
fifth-year senior Mark Butterfield said.
Senior cornerback Kwame Ellis also had
a take on the situation.
"We're not going to sacrifice wins to play
youngsters," Ellis said.

During the three years Walsh coached
the Cardinal, Stanford had a combined
record of 17-17-1. However, most of the
groundwork of the 1992 season, when the
team went 10-3 and won the Blockbuster
Bowl, was laid by Green and his coaching
staff.
Willingham's solution for starting roles
is simple and indicative of his personality.
Every position is open, and everyone is a
candidate for the starting role. The best
man wins the job.
If that player is a senior, then the senior
starts. If the best player is a freshman, that
freshman starts.
"We have one football team," Willingham
said. "Only one. It doesn't say Stanford se
nior football team. It says Stanford foot
ball."
The rule is simple, unassailable and one
that athletes can appreciate. Willingham
must have benefited from that exact same
rule; after all, he walked on at Michigan
State University and earned three varsity
letters as a quarterback. All of this despite
being, shall we say, small for a football play
er.
His travails as a student athlete led to his
philosophy and his intensity in life.
"My philosophy has been very consis
tent," Willingham said. "I will work as hard
as I can, as long as I can, as best as I can. . . .
That will be the same thing I ask of our foot
ball team."
According to junior running back Mike
Mitchell, Willingham has applied that phi
losophy to the Cardinal squad during his
first tenure as an assistant coach on the
Farm and now as a head coach.
"I heard so much about him, I was going
to wait and see what he wasgoingto belike,"
Mitchell said. "I heard how disciplined he
was, how he brings the best out of every
body. Everybody did the best they could do.
He pushed them to the limit.
"In spring^practice], he pushed us. He
pushed us. These next two weeks, I expect
him to push us even farther."
This physical intensity was something
that wasn't stressed as much under Walsh's
administration.
"It was totally different under Coach
Walsh," sophomore running back Anthony
Bookman said. "I see a much different work
ethic and discipline (under WillinghamJ.
The things he's bringing in and the things
we're doing, you can definitely tell a differ
ence between him and Coach Walsh. I am
working harder under Coach Willingham
than under Coach Walsh."
The approach Walsh took was different

than the approach Willingham is taking.
"I wouldn't say Walsh was easier,"
Mitchell said. "It's more intense now. It's
more 'get down to it, go to the field and play.'
There was a lot of mental work [with
Walsh 1, there was a lot of stress that way.
Now it's go out and play football."
The team that will take the field against
San Jose State on Sept. 2 will look and act
different from the one that tied Northwest
ern in the first game last year. For one, four
year starter Steve Stenstrom will not be tak
ing the snaps at quarterback.
The quarterback question
Much of the tension last year came after
Stenstrom broke his finger against Wash
ington. Sophomore Scott Frost entered the
game in the second half and rushed for 88
yards, helping Stanford to the 46-28 victory.
With Stenstrom out for the season,
Walsh tabbed Frost as the starter, ahead of
Mark Butterfield, who is considered to be a
better passer and is more similar to Sten
strom as a quarterback. Adding to the oddi
ties of last year, Frost, who is considered a
running quarterback, started five games
early in the season as a free safety.
If Frost was named the starting quarter
back for this year, Butterfield would have
changed more than his position; he would
have swapped universities.
"If they were going with Frost, then I
would have transferred to a Division II
school," Butterfield said.
Instead, it was Frost that transferred.
Soon after Walsh resigned, Frost an
nounced that he would sit out one year and
enroll at the University of Nebraska.
With this action, the starting quarter
back position was opened up to Butterfield
and redshirt sophomore Tim Carey. Will
ingham ensured that each would get a
chance to compete for the job, and the first
round of competition began during the
spring practice.
The first round of this battle resulted in a
draw. Coming out of spring, the depth
charts had Butterfield and Carey listed as
co-No. I.
Both quarterbacks were highly rated
coming out of high school. Butterfield was
Ail-American in publications and listed as
the eighth best quarterback in the nation by
Super Prep magazine. Carey was also
named Ail-American, and Super Prep listed
him as the fourth-best prospect at quarter
back.
In terms of experience at the college level,
the two are similar. Butterfield spent three
years caddying for Stenstrom and received

little playing time;
Carey has none. How
ever, Butterfield is not
worried about being
lost during the football
games.
"I don't have the
game experience, but I
know I can go out
there and do it," But
terfield said. "I'm
going to go out there
and get the job done."
Similarly, Carey
has strong confidence
in his own abilities.
The lack of game expe
rience won't hurt his
chances, Carey said,
adding that he has got
ten plenty of work on
the practice field.
While both he and
Butterfield are consid
ered passing quarter
backs, there are signif
icant physical differ
ences between (he
two.
"Two things
stand out," Willing
ham said. "One would
be mobility and (the
otherl ball velocity.
Butterfield throws a
little bit firmer ball
than Carey, who's a
touch passer. Tim is
slightly more mobile
than Mark."
Although both
are currently equals,

however, the one who finally wins the start
ing job will be the person who steps up and is
the leader of the squad.
"Any football team would like to have one
guy who steps above the other," Willingham
said. "It's gives the guys an understanding
of who is in charge. But if you don't get the
kind of leadership that you need, you have to
seek it out, you have to find it. If you don't
get the kind of execution you need, you have
to seek it out."
The backups for Butterfleld and Carey
are a couple of freshmen, and one may not
stay for the year. Chad Hutchinson and Tim
Smith are the two recruits.
Hutchinson, if he doesn't sign with the
Atlanta Braves (he was selected in the first
round of the major-league baseball draft),
will play both football and baseball for the
Cardinal. Others who played football and
baseball for Stanford include John Lynch,
Brian Johnson and John Elway. Lynch and
Elway are now in the NFL, while Johnson is
in the majors. Hutchinson has possibly the
strongest arm for the Cardinal. His fastball
was clocked at 94 mph on the radar gun.
Smith played both quarterback and safe
ty for his high school team. A gifted athlete,
Smith is known as a good running quarter
back.
Stanford is known as "Quarterback U."
with Elway, Jim Plunkett and John Brodie
coming from its ranks. The tradition contin
ued last year with the team depending on
the passing ability of Stenstrom for most of
the offense. However, that was under the
guidance of Walsh, inventor of the "West
Coast Offense." This year, the "Midwest Of
fense" invades Palo Alto.
Running" the show
"In offense, we want to have a balance in
both running and passing," Willingham
said. "On first down, you'd like to be a team
that is 50-50 in both running and passing."
While this may seem like an obvious goal
to strive for, two years ago, Stanford passed
for 3,709 yards and rushed for only 700.
Last year, the Cardinal passed for 3,358
yards and ran for 1,531.
In the five games where Stanford ran
more times then it passed, the Cardinal
were 3-1-1. The lone loss was by 1 point
against California. In the two games where
Stanford ran for more yards then it passed
for, the Cardinal won.
With this in mind, Willingham is going to
stress the run, much like the Midwestern
style football he played and coached. The
ability of the backfield corps will not change
his mind.
"We have superb players in the running
back position," Willingham said.
He should know, as he coached Glyn Mil
burn and Tommy Vardell as the running
backs coach. Milburn set the Stanford
record for all-purpose running in 1990, and
Vardell set a school record for touchdowns
in 1991.
The added emphasis on the run has the
running backs happily anticipating the up
coming season.
"Every running back in the program is
excited," Mitchell said. "It's 'give me the
ball.' It's your turn to step up. You're the
one that's going to lead the team to victory."
Mitchell was stepping up early last year,
but a misstep ended his season. After rush
ing for 136 yards against Northwestern and
179 in the victory over San Jose State,
Mitchell managed only one more carry be
fore an ankle injury caused him to miss the
final eight games. In his three games, the
big, quick runner averaged 7.5 yards per
carry and scored four touchdowns.
"The big key is staying healthy," Book
man said. "With Mike |Mitchelll getting
back and healthy, that's what we need."
In Mitchell's absence, Bookman received
the bulk of the halfback duties. Bookman, a
small scamperer in the style of Glyn Mil
burn, ended up as the starting running
back. He had a impressive series of four
games in which he ran 74 times for 4*23
yards. Bookman ended up with 577 yards
rushing on the season. He also returned
kickoffs and punts.
With last year's starter Ethan Allen
graduated, the fullback position is filled by
Adam Salina and Greg Cornelia. Salina, a ju
nior, ran for 143 yards and four touch
downs. At 6-foot-3 and 260 pounds, he can
block just about anybody. Cornelia received

limited playing time last year as a sopho
more and is currently trying to overcome in
juries.
Passing efficiency
While the passing game will not be as
prominent this year, it will still be a major
pail of the Stanford offense. Two key re
ceivers may be gone, but there is plenty of
talent in the wings.
Justin Armour, the quintessential pos
session receiver, caught 67 passes for 1,092
yards last season but has gone off to the
NFL. However, junior flanker Brian Man
ning is ready.
Manning, the second receiver last year,
caught 46 passes for 899 yards. A burner,
Manning has the ability to break away and
score a touchdown on any catch.
Armour and Manning complimented
each other very well last season, as Manning
would spread the defenses and force the
safeties and corner backs to acknowledge
(he deep threat. This, in turn, would allow
Armour to grab everything underneath for a
8- or 10-yard gain.
Manning will now attempt to do the same
with Mark Harris, a 25-year-old sixth-year
senior. Harris grabbed 15 passes last year in
a reserve role but turned in a good season in
1993. That year, Harris caught 35 passes for
580 yards and four touchdowns.
Damon Dunn gives the Cardinal another
deep threat. Dunn did not see much action
in the wide receiver role as a freshman last
year, but he did turn in one of the most ex
citing plays of the season with his 100-yard
kickoff return against Arizona State. Dunn
will be counted on to fill that role, and he will
add depth at receiver.
One of (he better tight ends of Stanford
history, Tony Cline, has graduated into the
pros. Juniors Greg Clark, Tommy Hanson
and Derek Hubbard will be asked to replace
his 35 receptions and blocking ability. Clark

and Hubbard are new to the program after
transferring from junior colleges.
The defensive glue
Last year, opposing teams ran for 2,136
yards, good for second-worst in the Pac-10
Opponents passed for 2,310 yards, and
Stanford ranked eighth in the Pac-10 in
total defense.
Even worse was the scoring defense. The
Cardinal were last in the Pac-10.
1 his, however, was an improvement
from the 1993 season where Stanford gave
up 389 points. The Cardinal gave up 30
fewer points last year.
But this is a new year, and there are new
faces and defensive plans. Bill Harris, the
defensive coordinator and one of eight new
assistant coaches, scrapped the 3-4 set and
is going with the 4-3, with four linemen and
three linebackers.
"With four linemen, you can try to get a
guy like [left end] Jason White, who's 260
I pounds], on the tight end and try to create
a mismatch," Harris said.
The new defense is designed to stop the
run while retaining the flexibility to contend
with any formations the opposing offense
uses.
"Defenses are set basically by what the
offenses run," Harris said. "You've got to
have defenses that are adaptable. People
will play one-back sets, and you've got to be
able to defend that."
Harris does not believe last year's de
fense was poorly designed, but he does be
lieve execution was lacking.
"1 looked at [last year's game] film and
the philosophy of the defense, the way it was
set up and the way it was supposed to work,"
Harris said. "I think the main reason it
didn t work was because they were playing a
lot of rookies. So regardless of what they're
playing, what they put in or what they
thought would work, people couldn't exe-

cute it. I'm hoping the
people who played as
freshmen and sopho
mores play better. It all
comes down to execu
tion."
With the intensi
ty Willingham is stress
ing, expect more pas
sion and emotion out of
the defense. Harris,
somewhat contradict
ing the NCAA's recent
move to stifle any sort
of emotional response
on the field, is allowing
the defense to, well,
enjoy itself.
"Coach Harris
has brought into this
program his philosophy
that it is okay to be en
thused about what
you're doing on the
field," Ellis said. "It's
all right to celebrate
and feel good about
yourself on the field
and show everybody
that we're happy to
come out here and per
form. The character fof
the team] is slowly
evolving into a much
more enthusiastic type
of defense."
Will Stanford
turn into Miami? It's
highly unlikely, but if
the defense draws
penalties for unsports
manlike conduct, the
Cardinal must be doing
something good.
The core of the de
fense will include line
men White and Kailee
Wong, a sophomore,
linebackers Mike Hall
and Brian Batson and
cornerbacks Leroy
Pruitt and Kwaine
Kllis.
The two leading
tacklers last year, Coy
Gibbs and Jason Fisk,
both graduated. Mike
Hall, No. 3 on the list,
will probably start at

middle linebacker.
Hall made 75 tackles
last year, five for loss
es, and also intercept
ed one pass.
Brian Batson will
start as one of the
outside linebacker
positions. Batson
made 18 tackles last
year in five games. A
broken leg suffered
during the Notre
Dame game ended
his season for the sec
ond consecutive time.
What sets Batson
apart from other line
backers is his ability
to cover passes and
his athletic ability.
Pete Swanson and
White, both seniors,
suffered injuries dur
ing spring practice
but should be leaders
of the defense. A very
large man at 6-foot-5
and 305 pounds,
Swanson is quick and
made 14 tackles last
year in six games. He
also racked up six
sacks for total losses
of 25 yards. White,
after missing the first
three games due to a
suspension for off
the-field activities,
tallied 36 tackles and
four sacks. He is con
sidered one of the
team's best pass
rushers.
Right end will be
patrolled by W 7 ong, a
quick and explosive
lineman. Last season,
Wong made 23 tack
les, sacked the quar-

terback once and broke up three passes.
Ellis and Pruitt will be keys in the sec
ondary. With the added emphasis on stop
ping the run, the cornerbacks will need to
blanket the wide receivers, as less help will
be coming from the linebackers. And if Stan
ford blitzes more than in the past, often
there will be one-on-one coverage in the sec
ondary.
Pruitt, a junior, is shorter than most re
ceivers at 5-foot-9 but has speed and quick
ness. Last year Pruitt made 39 tackles and
four interceptions to lead the team. He also
broke up five passes. Ellis, a senior, will also
be counted on in the secondary. Last year he
racked up 10 tackles and one sack as a re
serve.
Kicking into high gear
The kicking game has many questions.
Punter Aaron Mills is gone, and following an
inconsistent season, senior place-kicker
Eric Abrams will need to regain the form of
his freshman year.
Abrams started off his career with a great
season in 1992, making 16 of 20 field goals
and 31 of 32 points after touchdowns (PAT).
However, subsequent years have been dis
appointing. The decline began his sopho
more year, when he converted 11 of 18 field
goals and 34 of 35 PATs. Last year, Abrams
made 9 of 18 and missed three PATs; he was
eventually replaced by Mills.
Consistency was a problem, and Abrams
missed four field goal attempts from inside
of 40 yards. One of his misses, a 32-yard at
tempt against UCLA, sailed wide with 20
seconds to go in the game, allowing the Bru
ins to complete its 31-30, come-from-behind
victory. From farther out, Abrams was only
2-6, although he did hit a career-long 50-
yard field goal against San Jose State.
Kevin Miller will replace Mills as punter.
Miller, a redshirt freshman, averaged 41
yards per attempt his senior year in high
school. Last year, Mills punted 44 times for
a 40.5-yard average and had a net average of
36.0 yards per punt.
The challenges ahead
Stanford has been chosen to finish last in
the Pac-10 by many major publications, in
cluding Athlon. Keep in mind, however, that
last year Athlon picked Oregon, the Pac-10's

representative in the Rose Bowl, to finish
ninth and Stanford first.
This year's schedule begins on Sept. 2
with a journey to San Jose State for the first
time since the series opener in 1900. Last
year, Stanford won for the third straight
time, 51-20, leaving the series record at 39-
10-1 for the Cardinal. The Spartans finished
at 3-8 during the 1994 campaign, but this
year returns starting quarterback Alii
Abrew.
Utah and Wisconsin round out the non
conference schedule. Utah, which finished
10-2 last year, is returning almost no one at
skill positions and is unranked in national
polls. The Badgers defeated Duke at the Hall
of Fame Bowl to end its season at 7-4-1, and
starting quarterback Darrell Bevell is back.
However, most of its running game is gone,
and that was where Wisconsin did most of
its damage.
The conference schedule, consisting of
eight games, begins at Oregon. The defend
ing Pac-10 champion has 17 starters return
ing, but quarterback Danny O'Neill is gone,
as is their leading rusher, Dino Philyaw.
The trail then leads to Arizona State, site of
one of three 1-point losses last year, then
heads back for a home game against Wash
ington. The victory over the Huskies last
year was the highlight of a mostly depress
ing season.
The UCLA and USC games sandwich a
matchup with Oregon State. UCLA and
USC are considered the two top teams this
year, and both, while losing their starting
quarterbacks, have explosive players at the
running back and wide receiver positions.
The conference schedule leaves out Arizona
this year, which certainly makes the sched
ule seem a little easier. The Wildcats defeat
ed Stanford 34-10 last fall, thoroughly
shutting down the Cardinal running game.
However, Washington State, which had the
top defense last year in the Pac-10 and the
second-best run defense, replaces Arizona
and should threaten for the conference
title.
Big Game is in Stanford Stadium this
season. After Stanford held the Axe for six
consecutive years, the Golden Bears have
now stolen possession for two. Last year's
game was for pride. Hopefully, this year's
will mean more.
