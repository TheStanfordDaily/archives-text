★★ ★ ★
Soundtracks are usu
ally a dodgy investment.
Many times, the tracks
are throwaways, filler or
irritating "themed
songs (Remember "Bat
dancc"?). Now, Clueless
the movie may or may
not suck, hut the sound
track producers have
pulled together an immensely appealing collection.
In the standout single, Kim Wilde's '80s anthem
Kids In America gets a punked-out makeover by
the Muffs (why didn't someone think ol this
before?). Otherwise, listen tor Luscious Jackson's
disco inferno "Here, still groovy despite a too-bus\
dance remix, and Coolio's gangsta-pop "Rollin
With My Homics." Other strong contributions
come from newcomers Supergrass ("Alright"),
Hiisker-l)ii-esquc punkers Smoking Popes ("Need
You Around") and the ever-perky Jill Sobule
("Supermodel"). This CP will make you feel
young, hip and beautiful all over again.
