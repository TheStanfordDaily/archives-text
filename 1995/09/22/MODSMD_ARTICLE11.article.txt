reactions includc screaming and tears. That's
what Rick Stegall sees from students awarded
one of the school's new "first-generation scholarships.

Stegall is director of the ( api
cal C ampaign hind-raising group
at 111, one ot a growing num
ber of schools ottering special
scholarships to students who
demonstrate financial need and
whose parents do not have bache
lor s degrees. I erms of the pro
grams van from one school to
another, hue the principle behind
them is the same.
"One young ladv that we
awarded it to last war had alreadv
borrowed all the monev she could
borrow,' Stegall s.ivs. "She broke
down and wept, she was so happ\.
Samar I ighttoot, a sophomore
at ( olorado State I ~ s,ivs his schol
arship allowed him to attend ( Sl'
rather than a smaller school in his
native (. leveland. "Its two less
loans I have to take out, he savs.
It I didn't get a prett\ big
scholarship, I wouldn't be able to
go here, s.i\s |osh ( ooper, a
senior at 111. "I was relieved.
Paul I hayer, director ot the
center tor educational access and
outreach at ( Si ', takes credit tor
starting the first program ot this
kind in I l Wi.
In C olorado, people have
seen how successful it has been in
attracting and retaining students.
I hayer sa\s. "On a national level,
its probabh being looked at as an
alternative to other kinds ot schol
arships race-based scholarships
and the like.
I hayer sa\s he doesn t know
an exact number ot the schools

with similar programs, but he
thinks ( Si 's programs is rare.
" I here s been a lot ot interest,
he says."I reallv do think it's
going to be a promising concept
tor a lot ot places.
At ( SU, approximate!)
students benefit from the pro
gram. In its first year, the 111
program had only eight recipients,
even though (>() percent ot stu
dents were eligible, Stegall s.ivs.
"What's surprising is how well
the students have done in terms of
leadership and performance,
I haver s.ivs. "We're serving a dif
ferent cut ot students that isn t
otherwise recognized, rewarded
and encouraged.
