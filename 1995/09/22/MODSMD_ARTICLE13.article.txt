# Schools Drop Their Scores
## 
### 
PACK UP YOUR NO. 2 PENCILS, KIDS. A RECENT
survey from the National Center for Fair
and Open Testing reports that more than
200 colleges and universities have dropped SATs or
AC Fs as an admissions requirement.

1 he bottom line is that
SAT/ACT scores are not
good predictors of how stu
dents will perform in col
lege, says Pamela Zappar
dino, executive director for
the American testing watch
dog group. "The best pre
dictors are high school
records."
Xappardino says the
scores are unreliable and
highly coachable, which
gives added opportunity to
students who can afford
coaching material.
"Nothing savs schools

must use SA I scores, but our
studies have shown .111 increase in
the number of schools using
|them],' says Jan Clams, executive
director for the SAT College
Board.
Kansas State U. offers open
admission to students graduating
from an accredited Kansas high
school but requires SAT/ACT
scores from out-of-state students.
"Requirements tor out-of-state
students are stricter, but we do not
discourage them from applying,
says Barbara Dawes, associate direc
tor of admissions at KSU.
Dawes believes that SAT/ACT
scores arc a good comparative assess
ment of .1 student s skills and some
times all a school has to go on.
After one semester of being
SAT/ACT free, Connecticut Col
lege has diversified its campus, a

move that both students and faculty
have praised.
"We felt attention on a four-year
examination of quality was more
important than a three-hour test,"
says Lee Coffin, Connecticut's dean
of admissions.
Courtney Minden, a junior at
Connecticut College, says the
change is good and that she looks
forward to a more well-rounded
atmosphere.
"My SAT scores were a huge hit
on my self-confidence because I did
n't do as well as I'd hoped,' Minden
says."I think some students fear col
lege because of their scores. This
way, students can think about col
lege and not about outsmarting an
SAT test."
