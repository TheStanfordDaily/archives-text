WHI-.N YOU THINK OI- PKOIM 1 I RAMPI.INCi A
stage, you probably envision a rock con
cert with a bunch of security guards
yanking fans out of the spotlight.

But at the M(iM studios in
Orlando, I la., about SO members
of six black fraternities and soror
ities stomped around on stage as
much as they pleased... to the
tune of a $5,000 award.
In this year's annual stepping
competition, S. I .0.M.1'!
each team had only three min
utes to wow judges with their
best step routines. And we're not
talking step aerobics. Stepping is
a traditional dance made up of
synchronized footwork and clap
ping that has been passed down
through generations of black
Greek life.
After outstepping the compe
tition, the Phi Beta Sigma men

from ( lark Atlanta U., Cia., and
the Delta Sigma I bet a women
of Southern Methodist U.,
Texas, walked away with the
prize money.
Phi Beta Sigma members
11 ever doubted they'd ta k e
first place. "Of course we
came on with a cocky attitude
who didn't?" says Phi Beta
Sigma member William Jones.
Missed the competition? You
can rush the stage at next year's
event or catch S.T.O.M.P!
hosted by rapper 1 I Cool J. and
I V Siren Adrienne-Joi Johnson,
on national TV this fall.



Step this way.
