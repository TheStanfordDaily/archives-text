Eggs
At the U. of California, Irvine,
"scrambled eggs" have taken on a new
and disturbing meaning.
In June, three panels appointed by
the university found that Ricardo Asch,
a fertility specialist at UCl's Center for
Reproductive Health, had transplanted
patients' eggs and embryos and con
ducted research on them without the
donors' knowledge or consent.
Officials at UCI announced in July
that as many as 35 women may have
been involved in improper transplanta
tion of eggs and embryos at the clinic.
The panel also found that at least nine
patients received a non-FDA-approved
fertility drug.
The initial findings by the panel
released in June estimated that only
five women received eggs from non
consenting donors.
The accusations alleged that Asch
and two other doctors, Sergio Stone and
Jose Balmaceda, mishandled the con
sent process, didn't report all of their
earnings to the university and didn't
make the required payments to the
university for the undeclared income.
The investigation stemmed from
several reports, dating to February
1994, filed by various administrators
who dealt with the clinic. Because the
investigation began seven months later,
UCI also was accused of neglecting to
respond quickly to the complaint, but
the panels didn't sustain the allegation.
Fran Tardiff, a university
spokesperson, says the investigation
progressed slowly because the physi
cians refused to produce the necessary
records and information. The panel also
found that the university acted as
quickly as it could to put together the
investigations, Tardiff says. All three
doctors have denied any wrongdoing.
On June 2, the university terminated
its contract with the clinic and told its
doctors to remove their medical equip
ment from campus.
Although the preliminary investiga
tion is over, Tardiff says that the uni
versity is in the process of suing the
clinic for records that the physicians
have refused to release. Until those
documents are recovered, "the true
scope of the wrongdoings will remain
unknown," she says.
"The doctors were wrong, and a lot
of people here feel it was wrong for UCI
to cover this up," says Ken Felipe, a
sophomore at UCI. "It's not really the
talk of the school or anything.... But I
think an explanation of exactly what
happened and what the school will do
about it should be published."
