download. To date, more than 7S college publications have expanded to
include on-line versions of their newspapers, and the number is growing
rapidlv as the information superhighway spins an even bigger Web.
Whv the expansion from broad sheet to byte? Cost is one factor: "For
smaller newspapers, the biggest expense is newsprint and distribution, says
Marshall Miller, a junior at Brown U. and executive editor of the Broun
Daily Herald. Being on the Web broadens circulation without the added
expense of print.
"College students have the time, the knowledge and the freedom to tr\
new things, and there are few barriers to their creative freedom," says Jeff
Boulter, a senior at Bucknell U. in Pennsylvania and editor in chief of //'<
Bucknellian, which jumped on the Web in 1 l ) l )4.

The story of The Hucknelluin \ on
line version is fairly typical: Initially,
the newspaper was available through
Ciopher, a clumsy Internet tool that
limited the paper to a text-only for

mat. Then the- newspaper was placed on the Web, which, with the addition of
pictures and graphics, made it more user-friendly.
The new audience for college newspapers ranges from students and
alumni to random Web surfers. "Its .1 little frightening to think that some
one across the globe can read about what's going on at school just as easilv .is
one of mv classmates can," s.ivs Karen Apollo, a senior at C lorncll U. "But .is
long .is 1 have a paper copy of the Sun to keep me busy during lecture, I
guess there's no harm 111 going 011-line.'
1 or those who tear that their campuses will become just another truck stop
on the information superhighway, some editors have a more positive outlook.
"The college campus as .1 separate and secluded entity is a prehistoric
notion, says Charles Ratliff, .1 gr.ul student and editor in chief of The Sum
mer WHdoit .11 the U. of Arizona. " I he traditional campus will continue to
be replaced b\ .1 more global and virtual one The move to on-line news
papers is only part of .1 111111 li larger trend, and .1 good one at that."
Good or bad, there remains much room for growth. Currently, most on-line
papers are simply pared-down electronic editions of the original paper versions;
they typically have all text and few or no photos. Unlike print editions, howevei
publications on the Web offer the bonus of linked sources, which allow immedi
ate access to various Web sites, newspaper archives and school homepages.
So what exactly does the future hold? On-line papers will probabl
evolve into DIY publishing â€” Web users will designate, point by point, th
exact content of the news or information they wish to receive rather th
settle for the broad, standardized matter chosen by others.
But whether students and their publications are able to remain the u
ative spinners of the Web or are destined to become entangled in it
has vet to be decided. Stav loiyjed on.
