that's what some students say

Suzanne Cobban, a senior at
Ramapo ( 'ollege in New lersey, has
made transferring an art form — she
has three notches in her undergradu
ate belt. Cobban, a New Jersey
native, started at New York U. for a
taste of city life but soon found cos
mopolitan living less than glamorous.
"It was what I pictured life after
college to be like — living on my

own, taking care of day-to-day
things, Cobban savs.
She says her first transfer — to
Roston College — was like going
back to high school: "Very clique-y
and nearly impossible lor a transfer
to meet people.
Bv the end of her sophomore
year at Boston ('ollege, pressure to
choose a major forced her into a
yearlong sabbatical from school.
I.ast fall, ( oh ban enrolled at
Ramapo, and she plans, for the
moment, to stay.
josh Me km Icy, a sophomore at
the I'. of Miami in Ohio, trans
ferred from Rhodes (.ollege in I cn
nessee to escape the crash course in
Beer and Fraternity 101.
McKinley savs he wasn i getting
his money's worth at Rhodes. I
drank too much," he says."I came
here to calm down. It's .1 much big
ger campus — drinking isn't the
only thine to do.

Frit I). Stern, a junior at North
western U., considered transferring
to a smaller school tor a more per
sonal education.
"You think [college] is going to
be like Berkeley in the '60s — lots
of activism and interaction with fac
ulty," Stern says. "[But] I got
thrown into huge classes where 1
hardly knew the professors. Once
Stern learned how to find smaller,
more personal classes at Northwest
ern, he changed his mind about
transferring.
Clary Knglegau, executive director
of admissions and records at Texas
A&M U., says that transferring is a
good option for students who do the
right research. "Students must recog
nize that four-year institutions have
unique personalities with unique
requirements, he says."The earlier
you investigate, the better.
Hating solo in the cafeteria,
finding your way around campus

and straightening out
class c red its top the
list of hassles you can
expect to encounter
when transferring.
But for many, tempo
rary setbacks are
worth the move.
Wes Del Col, now
a senior at Rhodes
College, transferred
from Union College
in New York. "I came
from a prep school,
and Union was just
like [it]," DelC.ol says.
"It was a huge frater
nity school. I he acad
emics were fine fur
engineers, but it was
n't the best place in
terms of off-campus
opportunities.
With a year at
Rhodes behind him,
Del Col is settling in.
"Sitting alone in the
dining hall is a pain in
the ass," he says."I
constantly questioned
whether I made the
right decision. [But] it
wouldn't be transfer
ring if you weren't
starting all over
again."
