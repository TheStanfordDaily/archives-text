The naked truth
Just because Tom Carter has never
seen a naked woman before doesn't
make it obscene [C Mail, May 1995],
I'm sure that the young woman in the
photograph was shocked to learn that he
Considers her a barnyard animal. I hope
that Mr. (barter doesn't make this his lat
est crusade in his ongoing effort to make
a name for himself in right-wing circles.
Get off the soapbox and start working
on solving real problems.

If you believe in God (Judeo Christ
ian, and 75 percent of us do, according
to the poll), and you believe that
humans are created in God's image, then
finding the human form "obscene" is to
find God s image obscene as well. If va
don't like the merchandise, the fault lies
with the manufacturer.

I read "Banner Yet Waves" (May
1995], and I was appalled that so many
people find it difficult to acknowledge our

national Hug. Arc we,
.ls one melting pot of
individual cultures, no
longer believers in
true diversity? ()r is it
that because we are so
diverse, we tail to real
ize what plucked the
strings in our antes
tors hearts to create
this wonderful nation?
Although manv
would say America
has man\ strengths
and weaknesses,
would we not rather
say that throughout it
all, our national flag
has been a symbol of
what ihe entire world
has sought to be?
Stand up and honor
our nation's Hag.

I am upset with the [coverage of] the
new Ron Howard film, Apollo 13 [May
1995). This is by far one of the greatest
rescue operations ever. Due to an explo
sion, mission control, as well as the
astronauts, had no idea what was wrong
or if the capsule was able to be brought
back. I "hey were not lost in space, as you
were led to believe by [the] comments. I
am a movie fan. This is a story that is
long overdue in being told, and it should
not lose its significance by people misin
terpreting the story.

Anil an added to whoever is
responsible tor the caption in the photo
graph ("Riding mower, space shuttle. Same
difference, right?"). Space travel is not
something to be taken lightly, much less to
be made tun ot! It was tar from funny.

Anti-opinion poll?
I m writing in regard to your May
student opinion poll, "Are you pro
choice or anti abortion: Ihe pulling
revealed 57 percent pro-choice and 43
percent anti-abortion. But upon reading
the students comments, I noticed an
incredibly high number of anti-abortion
views printed in comparison with those
pro-choice, lo be exact, I found only
three statements, out of the 12
expressed, to be consistent with the 57
percent pro-choice. Are the people in
charge ot the polling subtly revealing
their own opinion? Or do you just feel
that because anti-abortionists have been
so loud, outspoken and sometimes vio
lent in expressing their beliefs, you need
to give them more space in your maga
zine? It greatly disturbs me that you can
so easily distort the information that's
been given to you. Is this what your
magazine has come to? I hope not.

1 would like to make a suggestion for
you when preparing an opinion poll.
When you ask the question, "Are you
pro-choice or anti-abortion?" you are
already, bv means of the way your ques
tion is phrased, biasing your readers.
"Anti-" causes a negative emotion in read
ers, whereas "pro-" causes a positive feel
ing. "Pro-abortion" and "pro-life would
be more appropriate. You would be omit
ting the "anti-" bias-producing word. I
would suggest that you repoll your readers
using language diat is consistent with an
unbiased philosophy of journalism — one
that promotes objectivity, not liberalism.
Actually, when you really analyze the
situation, "pro-choice" denotes that a
choice is available for all involved. How
ever, the baby is given no choice in an
abortion. Consider the possibility that
you and your staff could have been
aborted babies as a result of the misguid
ed irresponsibility ot the parents.
