blowing hangover may not be how you spell relief. Still, vo
might want to give this and other home remedies a shot
they're cheap and easy, and they just might work.
Kitchen cabinet remedies aren't cure-alls, say Joan Wilen and l.ydi
Wilcn, authors of Chicken Soup & Other Folk Remedies (Fawcet
Columbine), but they do offer inexpensive and safe alternative treatments i
minor ailments.
From head to toe, books on home remedies feature a variety of treat
ments for almost everything that ails you. For example, if you're sour on tr\
ing the lemon hangover cure, a tablespoon of honey every minute for H\
minutes may make you feel sweet again. Or load up on liquids — just n<
the kind that come with pink umbrellas.

POISE

If insomnia is keeping you lip al
night, the Wilctis suggest putting
chunks of a yellow onion in a tight
ly sealed jar. When you have trouhl
falling asleep, open the jar and tak

a deep whiff. Either the initial shock or the gradual essence d onion should
knock you out in no time (about 1 S minutes).
Instead of popping cough drops to soothe a sore throat, ease that dirty
sock off after a long day and sleep with it wrapped around your neck. It'll
take your sore throat — and breath — away. A convenient rationale for
owning 30 pairs of dirty socks or a bona fide remedy? lake a stinkin guess.
Meanwhile, at the bottom (that's feet — what were you thinking?), salt
water and sunlight can send athlete's foot back where it came from. So can
walking foot-naked on the beach in the Bahamas, but that might cancel tlu
inexpensive part.
But tryer, beware. Not all remedies work for all people. Michael
Mel ure, a junior at Trinity U. in Texas, attempted to get rid of a wart b\
putting a used tea bag on it for 1 5 minutes every day for 10 days. "I'd have
to say there was a slight wart reduction," Mel.ure says, "but 1 think I'm con
vincing myself that it's flatter because 1 spent all that time strapping tea bag
to my elbow."
Kristina Sehurr, a graduate student at the U. of" Maryland, College Park
tried to ease the itch of a mosquito bite by putting saliva and wet soap on it
Ihe whole idea was a little distasteful, Sehurr says."The soap got drv ,uu
crusty. It was gross, and it made me think about it more. I'm scratching it
rieht now."
