But contrary to what Harvard
students have believed since then,
it isn't true that Wiedner attached
a stipulation requiring all students
to pass a swim test. I essons are

sports, says a source in the Harvard
news office.
At Duke I', in North Carolina,
a 3-foot stone wall surrounds the
former women's campus (from
when the men's and women's cam
puses were separate). According to
the myth, endowment benefactor
James B. Duke stipulated in his will
that a 10-foot wall separate the men
from the women. But the rebel
builders got around that require

True or false:
•The U. of Maryland, College Park, awarded a doctorate — in health and
human performance — to a dead woman.
(True, in 1994, to Rafaela Coello, who was 84 when she died.)
• Famed U. of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne really told his players,
"Win one for the Gipper."
(False. His actual words were: "The day before he died, [Notre Dame football
player] George Gipp asked me to wait until the situation seemed hopeless —
then ask a Notre Dame team to go out and beat Army for him. This is the day,
and you are the team.")
• About the only thing that can get you out of class is a natural disaster.
(True. Washington State U. canceled classes for four days in 1980 when
Mount Saint Helens erupted; classes at the U. of Miami were canceled for a
month in 1926 because of a hurricane; Hanover College lost 32 of its 33 build
ings and a week of classes in 1974 when a tornado swept through Indiana.)
