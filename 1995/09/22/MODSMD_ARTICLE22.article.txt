says. "There's not really a bookstore here that sells new and used classics uul
has the texts right there, too."
MarvlMßCl, the campus public interest group at the I . of Maryland
holds a book swap at which students can trade their old texts tor c reel it
toward new ones.
But even the alternatives pose problems. "Sometimes you wait for the
book swap, and then they don't have what you need, savs Maryland seniot
Matt Ramsdell. "So you end up going to the bookstore anyway.
Another alternative, offered at Eastern Illinois U., is a school-run
textbook-rental system. A fee of about $5 per credit hour is added to sin
dents bills when they register lor classes. Although some courses require
more books than others, university officials say the fees even out over
four years.
"We've really gotten positive feedback," says Donna Dawson, text
book-rental clerk at HIU, "especially from transfer students who come
here and are amazed that they don't have to spend hundreds of dollars
on books.

Just remember — if you look hard enough, you'll be able to hit your
books harder than thev hit your wallet.
