VER DRHAM OF WORKING siDI BY
side with Martin Scorsese? Can
you imagine Quentin Tarantino
asking your advice on whether to
leave in the ear-slicing scene?
Would you be willing to risk an ulcer
to give stardom a chance?
If you re one of the risk-takers,
chances are you're heading toward your
first position: production assistant
a.k.a. the glorified, underpaid, under
appreciated, catch-all position that
thousands of college students and
recent grads pour into each year.

At the bottom of the totem pole, PAs often find
themselves working 16 hour davs, making average
pay and submitting to .1 lot of psychological abuse.
"All the pressure trickles down to the PAs, savs
Sarajanc Bos, a ' l )S graduate of Western Michigan
U. and a PA for Mighty Morpl>in Power Rangers:
Ihe Movie. "If you don't have thick skin, vou'll
never survive.
Rubbing elbows ss ith Hollvwood moguls for a
living sounds like fun, hut not when vou're everv
one's keeper. (letting actors on the set at the right
time is easier said than done.
"When the actors wouldn't listen to me telling
them the\ were needed 011 the set, I'd get reamed.
Bos says.

graduate of the IJ. of
Missouri who has
PA-ed on the sets of
On Deadly Ground,
Maverick little
(Hants, says he didn't
like being treated like
a subhuman species.
"I almost got fired
once for not checking
to see if there was
sour cream 011 one of
the lunches 1 was sent
to pick up."
New York U. film
student Jordan
Montmitn, who has
spent a few semesters

working as .1 PA for Iron list Productions and sev
eral student films, remembers driving more than an
hour to a location to find he was the onlv one there.
I he crew hadn t bothered to tell me that tlicv
wouldn't be filming that dav, he says. " I here's no
place for pride in the PA position.'
< 'leaning the set down to the last cigarette butt
is just another demeaning experience for PAs, but
its a blessing compared with other tasks. "I ve
known PAs who have had to search tor hours for a
certain kind of cigarette, and one who was ordered
by an actor to buy condoms," Ross savs.
The highs are real high, but the lows are real low
for PAs, says Donald ( ager 11, a graduate of the I'.
of Southern California who has PA-ed tor llag
niann/I andau Films and recently worked on the set
of the upcoming movie I ye for an I'.ye. ( ager recalls
one of his worst days as a PA: "A two-ion generator
thai took 12 men to push it around rolled onto the
tip of tin big toe. I yanked m\ foot awa\ just in
time but limped around the rest of the da)'."
How do PAs cope with the psvchologic.il war-

"Once when the Power Rangers were shooting
pick-up shots for their movie. Bos says,"I got to
wave a piece of cardboard to create a breeze in one
of the Ranger s hair."
I he highlight of Ross career as a PA was being
on the set of /it lie Giants with executive producer
Steven Spielberg. After watching him give direction
in tin. movie, Ross was determined to speak to him.
I asked him if he wanted a water, lie said no,"
Ross savs.
"In between my PA duties, I once got to hang
out with Sugar Ray I conard s sou, who had accom
panied his father to the set for a home video boxing
game commercial," ( ager says.
Kill from Kill n Play came over to one of my
friends and started rapping with him," says Tim
Kelly, a '')5 graduate of the U. of Southern Califor
