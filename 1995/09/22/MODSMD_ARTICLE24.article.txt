Expecting to see a lot of fresh
young faces in your classes this
year? Well, we've got news lor
you — the face of Americas col
lege student is changing. It's
growing older, with more wrinkles and
responsibilities than the traditional 18-
to 21 -year-old has.
Iwenty-nine-year-old J.D. Burke
should know. According to the
National Center lor Education Statis
tics, 40 percent of today's students are
over the age ol 24. Burke is one of
them, and his second time back, the
U. of Wyoming has lost its charm.
I his time he's all business.
Getting serious
"I tame to college right out of [high] school, like
everybody else, he says. "Drank a lot of beer and
chased a lot of girls. I just did what everybody else
was doing, except the homework. I lis grades fresh
man year were so low that he was put on probation
and eventually suspended.
After losing funding tor college, then sowing his
oats in the Navy, Burke is back to hitting the books
as an electrical engineering major — with a lot
more riding on his studies than just finding a fulfill
ing career. I le has a wife and two (soon to be three)
children to think about.
Katie Flynn, 52, of the U. of Utah, was in the
same boat. She cheered at the graduations of her
husband and daughter, then decided it was her
turn. Rut before she could earn her anthropology
degree, Flynn had serious hurdles to clear — like
learning how to be a student again. "1 hadn't taken
a test in 30 years, she says.
Approximately one-third of the students attend
ing the U. of Utah qualify as nontraditional, Flynn
says. As former president of the Non- I raditional
Student Organization, she made sure there were
programs that addressed issues such as peer mentor
ing and what to do when studying and attention
craving 2-vear-olds divide students time.
Flynn, who sometimes took classes with her 30-
year-old son, feels privileged to have had so much
family support. Other nontraditional students aren't
so luc kv, she savs.
Without a Mom-and-Dad scholarship, many
older students — often alone, sometimes divorced
and supporting children — have to tap other
sources for tuition money and basic living expenses.
l or the Burkes, both full-time students at the U.
of Wyoming, other sources include Uncle Sam.
Sure, J.D. s C>l bill helps out, but what really keeps
them afloat is the government-provided food and

child care for their 4-year
old, I iv. Their third-grader,
Simon, goes to school,
which frees up Mom and
Dad to t. ike classes.
In the evenings, they
hand crayons and paper to
I iv, and the rest of the tam
ilv sits down together to do
homework.
11 may be hard to sur
vive on welfare now, but
Burke sees it as the govern
ment's investment in his
family's future.
"It is absolutely impera
tive that you get your
degree, Burke says. "[Oth
erwise), you'll be an absolute
drain on society, and you'll
be behind the eiglu ball.
I he statistics are on Ins
side. I he National Center
for Education Statistics says
that college-educated men
earn .1 yearly average of
$17,000 more than those
with only a high school edu
cation. (College-educated
women earn $12,500 more.
Changing
priorities
Thirty-year-old John
lyler can sympathize, lie

and his wife, Susan, are expecting their first
baby, which makes his return to college even
more necessary.
"It puts pressure on me to get good grades and
get through school,' says l yler, who attends Austin
Community College in Texas. "Making .111 'A' in
class was important to me [before). Now I'm more
interested in learning the material so I remember it
after the class.
Because many draw an older clientele, commu
nity colleges often have more programs to ease 11011-
traditional students into the workload.
"ACC really helps nontraditional students get
acclimated," Tyler says. I le plans to earn his associ
ate s degree there and then transfer to a larger, four
year university nearby.
Lisa Callico's story may very well be every sru
dent's worst nightmare. Sixteen years and five col
leges after first entering the world of higher educa
tion, she has finally found the right school and
program at James Madison U. in Virginia.
The twist is that the 34-year-old grad student is
still living in undergraduate housing because the
university doesn't set aside housing specifically for
grad students.
For both I iallico and her sophomore roommate,
Debra Jacob, this has been a trying semester, (ialli
co is frustrated that Jacob likes to watch I V and lis
ten to the radio while she's trying to study. Jacob
feels she must ask tor permission to do those things.
"Sometimes I feel like I'm living with my
mother, Jacob says.
"I feel like I am her mother sometimes,"

responds (iallico. Hut in the end. mothering isn t
her goal; she just wants a quiet place to study.
"That's all she does, complains Jacob, who just
wants to return from classes to dorm-sweet-home.
Despite her dorm room dilemma, Gallico says
she deals with problems similar to those of most
students — choosing a major and then getting the
classes she needs.
but (iallico handles the social scene a little dif
ferently from traditional students. "I just want to
center on the classes," she says. "Then maybe later 1
can meet more people."
Payoff time
I'ven though she s had her share of setbacks,
(iallico expects to earn her master's in dietetics by
fall and say goodbye to college once and for all.
"Lord have mercy, I've been in school half my
life, she says. "People ask me why I'm still
doing this. I've been in school this long. I may as
well finish."
Tyler has a different reason tor his return.
"When you get to be 25 or 30 and you look
around and everybody [your agel has their
degrees or their own home, you want to settle
down, he savs. "We're going back to get some
stability in our lives.
Whether you're under the legal drinking age or
old enough to take calculus with your kid, co liege
classrooms are a common ground. Soon there may
be no such thine as a "nontraditional" student.
