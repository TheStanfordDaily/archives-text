right through l ): 40 biochem and
10:50 lab, through lunch and The
You tig tuul the Restless.
I lei roommates were frustrated. I he\ tried to
wake her up tor classes and to make her eat.
Danielle wished the\ would leave hei alone. She
didn't care anymore.
A week before finals, the\ found het in the bath
room gaunt and pale except for a bloodied left
wrist, but alive. A razor had eased the feeling of
emptiness and made the plea for help.
Depression is the leading cause of suicide, and,
according to the American Psychiatric Association,
suicide is the third leading cause of death among
I to 24-yeai olds.

says Michelle Dixon, .1 social worker at Philhaven
women's services in Pennsylvania.
Commonly recognized symptoms of deprcs
sion include feelings of hopelessness and sadness,
loss of motivation, change 111 sleep patterns (either
sleeping too milch or too little), loss of appetite,
low energv, poor self-esteem, woimng about the
past, irritability and loss ot interest 111 activities
previously enjoyed.
It's tough to tell whether .1 friend is clinicalh
depressed or jusi sad. to know whether to intervene
or bun out.
I wish I li.id recognized it earlier as depression
and not just mv roommate's personality,' savs one
of Danielle s roommates, ( arev, a I emple senior.
I felt limited trving to be .1 best friend, balanc
ing the role ol a confidant and knowing what slu

Danielle attempted suicide twice before C'arc\
and other roommates involved .1 school counselor.
"Its normal to want to help, but know that you
cannot change things, Dixon says. She says that
when someone becomes isolated, indulges in clan
gerous behavior or engages in suicidal acts, outside
help is needed. Main college and universitv coun
seling centers treat depression.
Between 80 and 90 percent of all depressed peo
pie respond to treatment, which can include ps\
chothcrapy, medication or a combination of the
two, according to the AI'A. Nearly all depressed j
people who get treatment see at least some relief
from their s\ tnptoms.
Depression is often as bewildering to \ictims as
it is to then lo\eil ones.
