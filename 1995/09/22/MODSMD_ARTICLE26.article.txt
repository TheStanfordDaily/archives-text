The latchkey kids of the '80s are flying
into the real world with more emotional
baggage than can fit into the overhead
compartment.
There are statistics to prove it: Those
born after 1955 are three times as likely to
suffer from depression as those born before,
and since 1945, the 20-to-29 age group has
more than tripled its suicide rate. Simply
put, many members of our Breakfast Club
won't be joining us for lunch.
But now there's Prozac.
Since its introduction in 1988, Prozac
has become the second most commonly
prescribed drug in the country. And because
nonpsychiatric physicians can prescribe
Prozac, it's also being used to treat an ever
wider range of afflictions and bad habits â€”
smoking, PMS, weight control, premature
ejaculation, you name it.
But despite its versatility and impressive
65 percent success rate in treating depres
sion, everyone reacts differently to the won
der drug of the '90s. Sally, an Orange Coast
College |unior, had quit school, used
amphetamines and cocaine, was bulimic
and fought constantly with family and
friends. Today, two years after going on
Prozac, Sally is a drug-free 4.0 student who
enjoys a happy, productive life.
Then there's Lillian, a recent U. of Texas
graduate who found Prozac's side effects to
be nothing but trouble.

"It screwed up my sex life," Lillian says.
"I was no longer orgasmic."
This is a consequence that often divides
users along gender lines. Women are irked
by the reduction of sexual sensation, while
guys claim Prozac makes them Energizer
bunnies of love.
Surprisingly, it's not cases like Lillian
that concern skeptics, but success stories
like Sally's. Critics worry about the long
term effects of taking Prozac. Some fear
future medical problems, while others envi
sion a New World Order society of passion
less robots.
Ridiculous? Yes. But these concerns are
valid, since Prozac will undoubtedly alter
the events that unfold in our lifetime The
question for our generation is: Will the
change be for better or worse?
If a substantial portion of the population
is on Prozac, how will that affect, say, poll
tics? Would John F. Kennedy have been
voted in by an electorate of Prozac poppers?
If so, would Oswald, if on Prozac, still have
assassinated him? Would a chemically bal
anced Jim Morrison still have written "The
End," then overdosed himself into oblivion?
Or would he have written more sanguine
pop songs ("A Fresh Start"?) and be partici
pating in a joint reunion tour with the Eagles
right about now?
As we bravely march toward the end of
the millennium, Prozac, for better or worse,
is now part of our arsenal. And like any
device, it is only as helpful or destructive as
the person who uses it.
