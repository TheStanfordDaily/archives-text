Patrick Toft, a junior at the

after Jeopardy! drew one of the 1 1
postcards his mother sent in for
him. hi even wasn't necessarily his

lucky number— his mom just got tired of sending
them, I oft says.
After his name was drawn, I oft faced a grueling

"It was nerve-racking but a lot of fun, Toft says.
The only drawback, Toft says, is that it takes
120 days after the air date to get your money.
Because of the lag time between taping and airing
the show, Toft is actually waiting about five months
for his prize. Talk about nerve-racking....
Taking a trip to California for the modern gold

way to earn a year's supply of Rice-a-Roni?

But getting there wasn't easy. At

I hose who passed the pre
liminary exam — IS puzzles
in five minutes — went on to

the next level, a written
exam consisting of five
more minutes of white

knuckle, heat-the-clock Wheel of lor
tune-style puzzles. (irey says most stu
dents can't handle the pressure and arc
eliminated during this round.
Before the final cut, contestants not
only take .t variety <>t written tests hut
.llso are judged on speech and voice quali
ty, enthusiasm and presentation. Being
bashful won't get you .1 spin of the Wheel.
After hours of dodging vowels and
slaying consonants, four students from

four different schools were crowned as
finalists. Their royal mission: a trip to
Orlando, I la., for a week of sun and fun
and oh yeah, competition, lor last year s

"college week, the 16 college contestants
were put up in.1 posh hotel at Disney World

a lot to get there. Grey says. "It's harder than it

/eopurdy! has a slightly different search method
tor its college tournament, says Jeopardy!s contes
tant coordinator Suzanne I hurber.
By promoting the college tourney in September,
leopiirrh! joins the back-to-school hvne. So when

"■ / r~
you buy your new jeans, back
pack and spiral notebooks, join
tin- 1 (),()()() to 20,000 students
who send in postcards in hopes of
getting on the show. But don't
hold your breath, because Alex
only draws about 1,200 names
for the first cut.
Patrick Toft, a junior at the
U. of Minnesota, got his chance
after Jeopardy! drew one of the 1 1
postcards his mother sent in for
him. hi even wasn't necessarily his

lucky number— his mom just got tired of sending
them, I oft says.
After his name was drawn, I oft faced a grueling
battery of tests, including a killer 50-question video
exam. About l ) 0 percent of applicants fail to make it
to the next level: a mock game. But jeopardy! is
looking for something different from Wheel of For
tune in its oral auditions.
"If they're enthusiastic, that's great. Ihurber
says, "but we're mainly looking to see if they under
stand the structure of the game.
I oft got it — he won $5,000.
"It was nerve-racking but a lot of fun, Toft says.
The only drawback, Toft says, is that it takes
120 days after the air date to get your money.
Because of the lag time between taping and airing
the show, Toft is actually waiting about five months
for his prize. Talk about nerve-racking....
Taking a trip to California for the modern gold
rush — only to walk away with empty pockets —
could turn someone off to correct spelling and remem
bering to phrase responses in the form of a question.
But it could prod a starving student to ask: What's one
way to earn a year's supply of Rice-a-Roni?
