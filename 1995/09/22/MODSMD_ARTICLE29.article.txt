"We're in an era of transition, and it's a little

"Some women still want

it's still the walk ol fame [lor men] ami the walk

freer, and that s good, but I hope they're being
responsible.'
But even lugate wouldn't sav that dating s dead.
"Just altered significantly. It's not the SOs idea
of the drive-in, holding hands.

That's it. It's not that dating s dead. It's that it's
50... done. Something our parents did and that we
packed away with out band jackets and prom key
chains.

"People are still doing the old-fashioned
thing, savs Renee Norton, a senior at San
Diego State U. "But only if they want to
impress someone. In college, there are no

parents to impress. Your friends aren't
going to see you meeting someone at
your locker like in high school."

Exactly. We're at college to
meet new and different people, to
expand our horizons. Not to hole
up with one person for four years.

"! have a lot more fun when I
go out with a hunch of people,"
says Robert Garcia, a junior at Flori
da International U. "I've never

actually tried to meet a female [to
date] at school."
Norcott has a boyfriend now, but
she didn't jump into a relationship.
"The first year, 1 casually dated a

whole lot of people. Dates were
more hanging out with friends
than going on a formal date."
No, daring's not dead.
"Maybe sleeping," says Roger

Sikes, ,1 sophomore at the U. of ( entral Arkansas.
"It's harder to find someone who wants to settle
down during college. I hey just want to have fun.
Since college is by its very nature .1 transitory
experience, it makes sense to shv awav from com
mitment.
"A lot of students don't know where they're
going to he after graduation. Norcott points out.
"They may not even know if they're going to he
around next semester.
It dating's sleeping, when will it wake up? Just in
time to enter the Real World, for many. Now, while
you're surrounded by people of similar ages and
interests, it's OK to be unattached.
After college, though, you may not live in a col
lege town. I he pool of eligible singles gets smaller.
Relatives and friends — who when you were 18 said
you were too young to get serious and that you
should concentrate on school — begin making that
ticking noise.
" 1 he older I get, the more pressure I feel to have a
boyfriend and to date seriously," UNC's Fugate says.
"People's priorities change," San Diego's Nor
cott explains. " Fhey become more concerned with
finding a person who would benefit them socially
and be a lifetime mate. Cioing to a bar with beer on
sports night might become going to a nice dinner."
HU's Garcia compares the change to the transi
tion from high school to college.
" I here was this whole group of people you only
saw during class. Once you graduated, you saw only
your good friends. I guess the same thing might
happen. You get better jobs, more responsibilities.
You have less time to just hang out."
And once we have the means to date, suggests
WSU's ( ,ory, we may not know how.
