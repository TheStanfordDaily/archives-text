# Nothing is for Everyone
## 
### Robert Manker, Assistant Editor 
Experts say our generation values
nothing, knows nothing and will
become nothing. What's the problem?
Nothing is the great natural
resource it once was. Nothing is a wise
investment. Nothing lasts forever, and
an ever-growing slice of America has
nothing to call its own.
Nothing is in our wallets, in our
leaders, in our media. We're given
nothing every day, and every day we
have nothing to show for it.
Our very dollar — the essence of
American being — is backed by debt,
backed by nothing. What do Wall Street
traders really trade? Nothing. Hog
futures? Hogs that do not yet exist?
Nothing.
Nothing is keeping American indus
try alive. U.S. companies are producing
nothing in America; U.S. auto makers
are selling nothing at a fair price; and
we're exporting nothing to Japan.
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich
has promised nothing for public broad
casting, nothing for the arts and noth
ing for education. In return, many
Democrats say Gingrich is good for
nothing. Interesting.
But the Republicans credit the
media for nothing. I think they're right.
The entire media-created and media
sustained idea of Generation X is based
on the premise that we do nothing.
"There's nothing to it," media execu
tives say. I agree.
The mega-hit fixture of NBC's entire
programming week — Seinfeld— is a
self-proclaimed show about nothing.
The satirical wit of syndicated colum
nist Dave Berry is about nothing.
Angst and indifference are nothing.
The collective cultural derivative of an
aborted Pearl Jam tour — nothing.
(Nothing should be written in stone.)
What do we have after eight months
of the O.J. trial? Nothing.
Kato Kaelin. Joey Buttafuoco. Puck.
These people did nothing. And their
message is simple — nothing guaran
tees a successful Hollywood career.
Late-night infomercials are nothing.
"You too can make nothing by doing
nothing at home. Send nothing for our
new self-help video 'You'll do nothing,
and you'll like it.' Just call 1-800-
NOTHING."
Scholars, politicians and half-kooky
columnists, all with sweeping psycho
babble stereotypes of our generation.
All — nothing.
So next time someone tries to lump
you in with everybody else, just tell 'err.
that nothing is for everyone.
"Thanks," you say?
It's nothing.
