strategies to date, she says. Heine the entire surro
gate courtship industry of personal ails, dating ser
\ ices and cyberdating.
This is part of the future of dating, say Rodney
M. ( ate and Sally A. I loyd, authors of the book
Courtship.
"The initial events of courtship may be changing
from informal introductions by one's friends to for
mal services that may maximize the chances of com
patibility," they say.
Cate and I loyd make several other predictions,
among them a rise in the age at first marriage,
another wave of sexual liberalism (once AIIXS is
cured or more reliably prevented) and still more
equality between the sexes.
Sounds like

we're on track. And, it seems, shallow waters run
deep. (V something like that. C asual dating now is
paving the w.tv fur more solid and equitable rela
tionships later, says Ball State's Adams.
"People want more emotional relationships," she
says. " I hey want more caring on both parts but
haven't been conditioned for it." Again, Adams sees
prescribed gender roles as a barrier.
But we're the ones crumbling those barriers and
coming at relationships on more equal terms.
"That makes for a deeper, more in-depth, more
interesting relationship, Adams says.
And that, conveniently, concurs with ('ate and
I lovd's ultimate conclusion:

"W c believe that the cimplc will remain a pri
mary unit, and that love, togetherness, quality time,
good communication and mutually satisfying sexu
ality will remain important themes in our culture
through the next century."

cafeteria. Sure you could go to a fancy restaurant
and order the specialty. But at the cafeteria, you can
wear your boxers and a ripped I -shirt, and the
choices are endless. You can mix and experiment
philosophizing and philandering one semester;
studying and buddying the next; a term of learning
and loving, and so on. You might decide to move
on to the filet mignon. But hey, there's nothing
wrong with shepherd's pie, either.
