Some students would like to forget the religious regimen dic
tated by well-meaning parents. To many of us, Cod was some
one who held up dinner and wasn't too keen on covering.
But according to Cynthia Kisser, executive director of the
Cult Awareness Network (C.A.N.), more college students are
turning to less-structured or nondenominational religions. Kiss
er reports an increasing number of complaints about Bible
based groups preying on this resurgence of student interest in
spiritual issues.
"College students are at an open point in their lives intellectual
ly,' Kisser says. "They're questioning. They're searching.' Ihe new
pressures and freedoms associated with college may increase a stu
dents vulnerability to membership in religious cults, she says.

gions, s.ivs ( arol Ciainbalvo, an exit counselor for
individuals trying to leave a cult. "The issue is not
one ot belief systems — it's one of psychological
coercion and thought reform." she says.
According to C.A.N, representative and former
cult member Martin But/., cults are groups that use
some means ot coercive persuasion or deception to
recruit and maintain members,
"We estimate that there are 2,500 to 5,000
destructive cults and that as many as 5 million peo
ple are affected by the cult issue, But/ says.
A consensus on cults, their number and their
impact is unlikely. According to J. Gordon Melton,
director of the Institute tor the Study of American
Religions in Santa Barbara and author of The (.nit
Experience (Pilgrim Press), "reports ot cults number-

• Thought reform — Mem
bers are manipulated, coerced
or persuaded to act or think in
accordance with the cult.
• Charismatic leadership —
One person or a small group of
individuals at the top makes all
of the decisions and filters
selective information to the
lower levels.
• Deception or hidden
agendas (often financial)
• Isolation of members —
Members often dissociate
themselves from family and
friends who are not involved in
the organization.
• Exploitation of members
— Members may be required to
give an excess amount of
money or energy to special
projects.
• Special or divine purpose
— The rights and indepen
dence of members are sec
ondary to the goals of the
group.

ing in the thousands and involving
people in the millions contain gross
l\ exaggerated figures circulated by
anti-cult groups to promote a cli
mate of hysteria."
Melton estimates that there arc
only "00 "alternative" religions in the
United States and Canada; 75 have
been identified as cults. About 25 of
those groups are considered contro
versial, and the remaining 50 arc only
involved in passing controversies.
For more than 15 years,
C.A.N, has been collecting articles
on the controversial ministry The
Way International, a Bible-based
Christian group with headquarters
in New Knoxville, Ohio.

Bill Greene, director of public relations at I he

are free to come and go as they wish," Greene says.

Will and The Way
Ramona Meraz, a 21 -year-old Arizona State U.
senior, is a "follower" of The Way International.
According to Meraz, the Way teaches followers
how to ask questions and find answers in I he
Word (Clod's).
"Anyone who has been to .1 Way fellowship or
meeting can tell you that nothing strange goes 011,
Meraz says.
Witnessing, evangelizing, pioneering — whatev
er the term — makes up part of the weekly work for
followers. Meraz asks new friends to come to at
least one fellowship service.
"A lot of friends I've brought to fellowship do
come back, Meraz says. "They don't necessarily
have the same commitment 1 do, but they see
that they've been blessed.
Giambalvo says that new members typically
devote only a tew days a week to the group, lun with
time, the commitment involves more peripheral activ
ities, such as picnics, date nights and Bible studies.
Greene counters that people who fellowship with

The Way work only three to tour
hours per week.
In addition to doing course
work for The Way. attending fel
lowship meetings and reading The
Word daily, Meraz supports her
self and receives grades worths of
grants and scholarships.
Meraz is considering dedicating
her life to ministry in The Way
Corps, but her postgraduate plans
aren't set in stone.
Equally confused about post
graduate life is 23-year-old Jennifer
Steedly, a former Jehovah's Witness
and recent U. of Oregon graduate.
Steedly was .1 Witness before she
started college. As a Witness, she was-

n't allowed to date, celebrate birthdays or participate in
sports or extracurricular activities.
"I was socially atrophied, Steedly says. "At Hrst
it was easier having people know I was a Witness
because it excused my ignorance. Now only my
close friends know.
During high school, Steedly pioneered door to
door for 60 hours a month. After graduating,
Steedly pioneered 90 hours a month and had a
part-time job to pay for living expenses.
Emergency exit
(letting out can be as difficult as being in a cult,
but many do eventually leave. Exit counseling is a
voluntary method of intervention. With deprogram
ming, members .ire forced to listen to a counselor.
Steedly was a Witness tor a year before her
father, who was not .1 Witness, got her exit counsel
ing. He became concerned when Steedly decided
not to attend college.
"Cloing to college was deeply frowned upon,
she says. "They felt the end of the world was near
and your highest priority should be prosclyti/ing.
At first, Steedly refused to speak with the exit
counselors. Eventually, she watched a succession of
videos about mind control, cults and the Witnesses
and became convinced Steedly that she had been
deceived by the leaders of the Witnesses.
Her faith in God was the only thing that kept
her sane after leaving the Witnesses, Steedly says. By
leaving, she lost contact with all of her family and
friends still involved with the Witnesses.
"I've learned that there's a huge difference
between believing in Clod and being religious,"
Steedly says."I don't consider myself a religious
person, but I still believe in Clod."
Destructive cults and myths go hand in hand,
according to Kisser. One of the predominant myths
is that people who get involved in these organiza
tions are weak-minded or have some sort of psycho
logical problem.
"We [at C'.A.N.) want to emphasize that every
one is a potential recruit," Butz adds. "There are
plenty of good people [in cults] — good people
caught up in a had thing."

one who held up dinner and wasn't too keen on covering.
But according to Cynthia Kisser, executive director of the
Cult Awareness Network (C.A.N.), more college students are
turning to less-structured or nondenominational religions. Kiss
er reports an increasing number of complaints about Bible
based groups preying on this resurgence of student interest in
spiritual issues.
"College students are at an open point in their lives intellectual
ly,' Kisser says. "They're questioning. They're searching.' Ihe new
pressures and freedoms associated with college may increase a stu
dents vulnerability to membership in religious cults, she says.

But don't contuse culls with alternative reli
gions, s.ivs ( arol Ciainbalvo, an exit counselor for
individuals trying to leave a cult. "The issue is not
one ot belief systems — it's one of psychological
coercion and thought reform." she says.
According to C.A.N, representative and former
cult member Martin But/., cults are groups that use
some means ot coercive persuasion or deception to
recruit and maintain members,
"We estimate that there are 2,500 to 5,000
destructive cults and that as many as 5 million peo
ple are affected by the cult issue, But/ says.
A consensus on cults, their number and their
impact is unlikely. According to J. Gordon Melton,
director of the Institute tor the Study of American
Religions in Santa Barbara and author of The (.nit
Experience (Pilgrim Press), "reports ot cults number-

• Thought reform — Mem
bers are manipulated, coerced
or persuaded to act or think in
accordance with the cult.
• Charismatic leadership —
One person or a small group of
individuals at the top makes all
of the decisions and filters
selective information to the
lower levels.
• Deception or hidden
agendas (often financial)
• Isolation of members —
Members often dissociate
themselves from family and
friends who are not involved in
the organization.
• Exploitation of members
— Members may be required to
give an excess amount of
money or energy to special
projects.
• Special or divine purpose
— The rights and indepen
dence of members are sec

group.

anti-cult groups to promote a cli

Melton estimates that there arc
only "00 "alternative" religions in the
United States and Canada; 75 have
been identified as cults. About 25 of
those groups are considered contro
versial, and the remaining 50 arc only
involved in passing controversies.
For more than 15 years,
C.A.N, has been collecting articles
on the controversial ministry The
Way International, a Bible-based
Christian group with headquarters
in New Knoxville, Ohio.

Will and The Way
Ramona Meraz, a 21 -year-old Arizona State U.
senior, is a "follower" of The Way International.
According to Meraz, the Way teaches followers
how to ask questions and find answers in I he
Word (Clod's).
"Anyone who has been to .1 Way fellowship or
meeting can tell you that nothing strange goes 011,
Meraz says.
Witnessing, evangelizing, pioneering — whatev
er the term — makes up part of the weekly work for
followers. Meraz asks new friends to come to at
least one fellowship service.
"A lot of friends I've brought to fellowship do
come back, Meraz says. "They don't necessarily
have the same commitment 1 do, but they see
that they've been blessed.
Giambalvo says that new members typically
devote only a tew days a week to the group, lun with
time, the commitment involves more peripheral activ
ities, such as picnics, date nights and Bible studies.
Greene counters that people who fellowship with

The Way work only three to tour
hours per week.
In addition to doing course
work for The Way. attending fel
lowship meetings and reading The
Word daily, Meraz supports her
self and receives grades worths of
grants and scholarships.
Meraz is considering dedicating
her life to ministry in The Way
Corps, but her postgraduate plans
aren't set in stone.
Equally confused about post
graduate life is 23-year-old Jennifer
Steedly, a former Jehovah's Witness
and recent U. of Oregon graduate.
Steedly was .1 Witness before she
started college. As a Witness, she was-

n't allowed to date, celebrate birthdays or participate in
sports or extracurricular activities.
"I was socially atrophied, Steedly says. "At Hrst
it was easier having people know I was a Witness
because it excused my ignorance. Now only my
close friends know.
During high school, Steedly pioneered door to
door for 60 hours a month. After graduating,
Steedly pioneered 90 hours a month and had a
part-time job to pay for living expenses.
Emergency exit
(letting out can be as difficult as being in a cult,
but many do eventually leave. Exit counseling is a
voluntary method of intervention. With deprogram
ming, members .ire forced to listen to a counselor.
Steedly was a Witness tor a year before her
father, who was not .1 Witness, got her exit counsel
ing. He became concerned when Steedly decided
not to attend college.
"Cloing to college was deeply frowned upon,
she says. "They felt the end of the world was near
and your highest priority should be prosclyti/ing.
At first, Steedly refused to speak with the exit
counselors. Eventually, she watched a succession of
videos about mind control, cults and the Witnesses
and became convinced Steedly that she had been
deceived by the leaders of the Witnesses.
Her faith in God was the only thing that kept
her sane after leaving the Witnesses, Steedly says. By
leaving, she lost contact with all of her family and
friends still involved with the Witnesses.
"I've learned that there's a huge difference
between believing in Clod and being religious,"
Steedly says."I don't consider myself a religious
person, but I still believe in Clod."
Destructive cults and myths go hand in hand,
according to Kisser. One of the predominant myths
is that people who get involved in these organiza
tions are weak-minded or have some sort of psycho
logical problem.
"We [at C'.A.N.) want to emphasize that every
one is a potential recruit," Butz adds. "There are
plenty of good people [in cults] — good people
caught up in a had thing."
