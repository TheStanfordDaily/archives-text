In countlcss articles not unlike

journalists have tried to define what
makes a movie a e nll lavorite, and
none lias ever succeeded.
But let's get real. C ult films

Cult classics every college
student should see

Here are some core picks — best viewed at midnight, ot course.
Tha Parallax Vlaw (1974, Alan J. Pakula) The scariest conspiracy
film of all time puts JFK io shame. Warren Beatty plays a reporter who gets caught
up in a web of intrigue and murder while investigating the assassinations of politi
cal figures. So cynical and dark a version of America that even the light at the end
of the tunnel is dim.
Spldar Baby (1964, Jack Hill) And you thought John Waters (Pink
Flamingos) was weird. This tale of a family of inbred killers is the standard old dark
house genre with twists so kinky they put hard-core fetishists to shame. Classic
exploitation filmmaking.
Hoatf (1968, Bob Rafelson) Starring the Monkees and written by Jack
Nicholson, this is the only truly successful (although not financially) psychedelic
film. It's an active deconstruction of the prefab teenybopper rock stars, and it rev
els in smashing icons — the group appears as dandruff in a hair commercial at one
point — and tweaks the nose of rock movies in general. Even the music is good.
A Buckat of Blood (1959, Roger Corman) Made in two days, this
strange little horror story about a coffeehouse busboy with dreams of being a
sculptor proves that ultra-low-budget films can be not only well-made but also
more witty and subversive than studio projects. Walter Paisley wants so badly to
impress the artists who hang around the cafe that he's willing to ki11...
accidentally, at first.
Joa Varmum tha Volcano (1990, John Patrick Shanley) With
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan? Yes. It's a criminally underrated allegory of the
movie business — with a bad ending tacked on by timid producers. This one
combines the elements of magical realism: Brechtian theater, pulp '30s serials
and cowboy songs. Some of the best lunatic romantic dialogue ever lensed. The
story is daffy, as are the characters. That's the best part. Don't believe what
you've heard.
Q (Tha Wirt gad Sarpant) (1982, Larry Cohen) A prehistoric god
in the form of a giant pterodactyl has built a nest in the Chrysler building! You real
ly don't need to know any more about it, except that it elevates the standards for
characterization in B-grade horror films with an impressive array of actors who are
really allowed to act. (Also see God Told Me To by Cohen.)
Tha Trial (1963, Orson Welles) The consummate Kafka nightmare done
up in classically expressionist detail by the greatest director of all time. The spaces
squeeze Josef K. into odd corners, just like the plot does. The real story lies in the
shadows, barely visible.
A Naw Laaf (1971, Elaine May) Starring Walter Matthau, this long-lost
dark comedy is about class in America told through the eyes of star-crossed lovers.
One of them spends most of the film trying to kill the other in order to save the
family fortune (in the vein of The Ruling Class, which is also highly recommended).
My Braakfamt With Blaaala (1983, Johnny Legend, Linda
Lautrec ) Starring Andy Kaufman, this satire of the pretentious My Dinner With
Andre takes place at a Sambo's restaurant in Los Angeles. Two characters order
greasy food and chew the fat about their careers as entertainers and wrestlers. So
subtle it's almost not even there. But it is. The joke is on you. Nothingness hasn't
been so absurd since Waiting for Godot.
Forblddan Zona (1980, Richard Elfman) Odd nightmare set in
what looks like a Betty Boop cartoon of hell, all of which breaks loose. Freaks
and perverts abound as Oueen Doris and King Fausto battle for control of the
forbidden zone, where Oingo Boingo make the music and everybody scores.
Consummate cult.
OK, we ran out of space. But here are some more cult movies you won't want to
miss: Little Shop of Horrors (original), The State of Things, Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, The Cars that Ate Paris, Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things and
Mickey One (a Holy Grail of cult filmdom — starring Warren Beatty).

Sean Nelson, a junior at the U. of Washington, is the film critic for the Glass Onion
and he watches way too many movies.


Lunacy, B-grade horror,
cowboy songs — cult films
offer the whole schmeer.


Cult films turn over A New Leaf.
