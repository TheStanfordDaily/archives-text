Change is also registering on the
charts. Singles b\ New York artists
now frequently show up on the Bill
board top 10 and New York radio
station Hot (WQII D saw its rat
ings skyrocket when it switched to a
predominantly Hast Coast hip-hop
format. More importantly, the new
artists themselves are bucking past
trends of competition and rivalry in
favor of cooperation and unity.
(iiiest spots on albums are now more
common than ever, and there seems
to be a real sense of community
brewing as rappers realize the value
of collaboration for the music's sake.
"Hverybody's comin together,
and there's not as much jealousy,
envv and animosity, savs lek of
Sniif n Wessun, one of the many
new groups that have been more
than willing to lend out their skills in
an effort to help their brethren. Both
l ek and his partner Steele rapped on
Black Moon's debut "Hnta Da

Stage, and
the two also
contribute a
verse on a
posse cut for
the Fast
Coast all-star
album The

D&D Project.
"I check broth-

ers out there like AX, Nas and
Mobb Deep, savs Raekwon.
" I hev re makinn ii more real...

and vou gotta respect that.
I his type of camaraderie

was nowhere to be found a
few years ago, but the new
breed of Hast Coast artists
seems to value the onnortunitv

~ If /
to work with other talented rap
pers. "It's all one love, and we're a part
of that," says lek. "We're just doin
our thing, and kecpin the music alive.'
Righteous brothers
New artists are also keeping the
Hast Coast tradition of hip-hop inno
vation alive. Hollowing in the loftv
footsteps of innovators like A I rihe
Called Quest, De l.a Soul, and Diga
hle Planets, both the Roots and the
Boogiemonsters are taking the musi
cal form to new levels of creativity.
Both hands recently released
stellar debuts that have critics and
true hip-hop fans drooling over the
welcome change of pace. I he Roots
are the first group to fuse purely live
instrumentation and lyrical dexterity

while retaining street credibility.
The Boogiemonsters, who refer to
the Roots as one of their "brother
groups," rely heavily on spirituality
and an ever-fluid style, which they
hope to use as a tool in changing
hip-hop. One of their goals is to
bring the music away from repeti
tion and dryness — thus, the water
imagery on their debut Riders of the
Storm: The Underwater Album.
"When we talk about water, its
like we want to take hip-hop under
water for a baptism, because a lot of ii
is dirt\ right now, says Yodared, one
of the four-man Boogiemonster crew.
"We're trying to inspire a move
toward righteousness. I here's a line
being drawn in hip-hop... with two
definite sides — the side of the wicked
ness and the side of righteousness.
There's people straight talkin about
murder as acceptable and degrading
women as acceptable. We're trying to
move away from that, and we know
not everyone is going to follow, but
we're trying to set the pace so those
who want to come out and speak right
eousness can follow our lead.
East Coast family
But will new Fast Coast artists
follow the lead of the Boogiemon
sters, Wu- I'ang C lan, Biggie and
the others? Are we seeing the open
ing stages of a long-term upswing in
Hast Coast hip-hop or just being
blessed by a very cool I.ilnc alarm?
Powell is not sure.
"I don't know if I'd call what
we're seeing a resurgence, says Pow -
ell. "People are realizing that they
have to change things up, and that's
cool, but I don't know il a few groups
blowin up makes ii a resurgence yet
All seeds need time to grow. Let s
hope this is only the beginning.
