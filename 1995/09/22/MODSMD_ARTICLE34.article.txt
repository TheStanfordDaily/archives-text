Extra Fancy
Los Angeles' Extra Fancy
may be the nation's most
famous unsigned band.
Countless aggressive
live shows and a deafening
street buzz have earned the
band extensive media cov
erage — typically the sort
of hype reserved for a
major-label debut.
"Everything is sort of
happening the opposite way
from how it normally does,"
says bassist D.A. Foster. The
band — which also includes
vocalist Brian Grillo, gui
tarist Michael Hateley and
drummer Derek O'Brien —
has been playing in the L.A.
area for nearly three years.
With great hype comes
great headaches, though.
The band is often pegged as
"homocore," a media tag
Grillo, the only gay member,
says he could do without.
"[Our music] is not
'homocore,"' Grillo says,
"because there are three
straight guys playing along.
Our music's for everybody."
Sinner Man, the band's
independently produced
debut, incorporates the heav
ier end of punk, industrial
and even rockabilly, comple
mented by Grillo's husky
vocals and candid lyrics.
"When I first started this
band, I was at a point in my
life where I really needed to
start looking at myself and
getting inside my head,"
Grillo says. "It's very liber
ating to expose every little
detail about myself in front
of a bunch of people. The
cool thing about this punk
movement coming back is
that people really seem
open to new things."

Musicallv, the band continues to appropriate the

It took three years to

the album celebrates the disco decade musically and

A good example of a modern music hi/ phenom

when MI V picked up the "No Rain video off

great way to get acquainted with this
most excellent band. For the initiated,
it's a great way to get the rarities

Luna
Penthouse
Elektra
Before techno/house/trip-hop/etc.,
trance music depended on metronomic
drumming and inventive guitar sounds
(think Velvet Underground). Luna's Dean
Wareham (formerly of Galaxie 500) has
this routine down pat, and his lovely lyri
cal landscapes make Penthouse feel like
a slow barbiturate dream.

Catherine Wheel
Happy Days
Fontana/Mercury
As their radio hit "Black Metallic" evi
denced, Catherine Wheel can do wonders
with guitar dynamics. In fact, the tempta
tion is to call the guitars on this CD "majes

son. Oh, what the hell — they're majestic.
Check Rob Dickinson's duet with Belly's
Tanya Donnelly, "Judy Staring at the Sun."

Luna

Elektra
Before techno/house/trip-hop/etc.,
trance music depended on metronomic
drumming and inventive guitar sounds
(think Velvet Underground). Luna's Dean
Wareham (formerly of Galaxie 500) has
this routine down pat, and his lovely lyri
cal landscapes make Penthouse feel like
a slow barbiturate dream.

As their radio hit "Black Metallic" evi
denced, Catherine Wheel can do wonders
with guitar dynamics. In fact, the tempta

son. Oh, what the hell — they're majestic.

Pocket
Band
Extra Fancy
Los Angeles' Extra Fancy
may be the nation's most
famous unsigned band.
Countless aggressive
live shows and a deafening
street buzz have earned the
band extensive media cov
erage — typically the sort
of hype reserved for a
major-label debut.
"Everything is sort of
happening the opposite way
from how it normally does,"
says bassist D.A. Foster. The
band — which also includes
vocalist Brian Grillo, gui
tarist Michael Hateley and
drummer Derek O'Brien —
has been playing in the L.A.
area for nearly three years.
With great hype comes
great headaches, though.
The band is often pegged as
"homocore," a media tag
Grillo, the only gay member,
says he could do without.
"[Our music] is not
'homocore,"' Grillo says,
"because there are three
straight guys playing along.
Our music's for everybody."
Sinner Man, the band's
independently produced
debut, incorporates the heav
ier end of punk, industrial
and even rockabilly, comple
mented by Grillo's husky
vocals and candid lyrics.
"When I first started this
band, I was at a point in my
life where I really needed to
start looking at myself and
getting inside my head,"
Grillo says. "It's very liber
ating to expose every little
detail about myself in front
of a bunch of people. The
cool thing about this punk
movement coming back is
that people really seem
open to new things."

Urge Overkill

(icff'rn

I ve figured it out.
i See, I rge (Overkill is less
.1 rock band than a per
petual meditation on
the state of roi.k baiul
dom. I lies ve cultivated
a martini and-velvet
image of swank that is
jso breathtakinglv cool it
threatens to take over

not |iim the hand s music but the entire planet.
( oolness has us cost, however, and 111 the case ot
I 'rge 1 , it means vou can never dissociate the music
Iroin the image. Which isn't a problem it you're in
the mood to just feel hip and be roi ked, you know,
like ( heap I'rick rocked. It's in the c]uietet
moments, like I xit s delicate "View ot the Rain,
that the coolness becomes a problem. Because in
vihir heart, sou want to sing along with a line like
I ake a walk outside vourselt/C Jet to know the per
son behind the lace/Is 11 someone you can really
love?" But you're afraid the Boys in Urge would
laugh and call you a si\s\
Musicallv, the band continues to appropriate the
best rock rills of the past 20 years, but I don t think
that's even a crime anymore. Urge is the best there
is at what they do making dashing, disposable
rock historv. And that s a compliment.

Spirit of '73:
Rook for Choice
Various Artists
Sony

It took three years to
get this record made, as
skittish major labels,
freaked by the Ice- I /
Warner fiasco, refused
to mess with the politics
of a pro-choice compila
tion. So sisters did it tor
themselves.
Featuring "girl bands

of the '90 s doing covers of girl singers of the '705,"

the album celebrates the disco decade musically and
politically (I'J -7 3 was the vear of the Roc v. Wade
decision). I lighlights include Joan Jett and Rock lor
( hoice founders I ~~ covering the Runaways "(cher
ry Bomb and he's Plumb's faithful version of "It I
( an ( I lave You."
What s on the record is fine — its what s not on
the record that's .1 bit disappointing. Where are the
big hitters? Sine.id 0 ( (inner, Salt-n-Pepa, The
Breeders, Ihe B-S2s and M( I vte — all staunch
supporters of women's rights were reportedly con
tatted tor the project. Sure, logistics can be tough on
a compilation, but jeez — where d everybody go?
