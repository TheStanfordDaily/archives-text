Robert Rodriguez started the indie fire burning
with his S~\()()() II Mariachi. Now, with big-studio
backing and big-name talent (Antonio Banderas
plays the musician with the loaded guitar) for its
sequel, he puts bis tricks aside — or ai least polishes
them — and does some serious filmmaking.

Screen Saver
A Reason to Believe
A movie on date rape? Ugh. No thanks.
But wait, there's A Reason to Believe.
Higher Learning was disappointing
because it tried to tackle too many issues
and couldn't give any the treatment they
deserved — particularly the rape plot line,
which got further convoluted with the sex
ual-orientation-questioning plot line.

On the
Set
A special-effects artist
painstakingly arranges yak hair
on a giant rat creature. "Take
note of this," says actor Tom
Savini (Creepshowl and II).
"Everybody else turns into a
bat. I turn into a rat."
Savini plays Sex Machine, a
customer at the Titty Twister
bar in From Dusk Till Dawn, the
upcoming Robert Rodriguez
<Desperado) vampire horror
film. Scriptwriter Quentin
Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) and
George Clooney (TV's ER) play
gangster brothers who seek
refuge at the Titty Twister.
Greg Nicotero, the "N" of
the KNB special-effects com
pany, demonstrates another of
his creations, a twitching bat
that attacks Clooney in the
movie. "George was upset
because the bat out-acted
him," Nicotero says.
Nicotero also points out a
decapitated head, which is
modeled after Robert Kurtzman
("K" of KNB). "This is human
hair," he says. "You can't style
synthetic. See, Bob has kind of
the Ohio high school hairdo."
Everybody in the special-effects
room gets killed at some point
in the movie, Nicotero says.
Production designer Cecilia
Montiel explains her vision of a
new design for vampirism in
Mexico: "Don't expect any
Gothic here. It's naco. Border
style — tacky and decadent."

A Reason to Believe is a thorough explo
ration of the subject, but it doesn't feel like
an after-school special or one of those good
for-you movies you were forced to watch in
health class — movies that are OK but that
in no way relate to your life. These scenarios
are believable, and the movie's actually still
fun to watch. Music includes songs from
REM, Blind Melon and 10,000 Maniacs.
A Reason to Believe stars Allison
Smith (TV's Kate & Allie). It opens nation
ally in September.
