Burn, Baby,
Burn
Fed up with years of self
indulgent generational irony,
national fraternity Gamma
Zeta Chi recently announced a
ban on kitschy '70s references
in all fraternity-owned houses
"We're particularly strict
about referencing a certain
1970s family that is 'much
more than a hunch,' if you
know what I'm talking about,"
said president Kip Kaplan at a
press conference.
Any fraternity member
caught singing Schoolhouse
Rock songs or publicly display
ing Cheryl Tiegs posters will be
immediately deactivated.
"We're serious," Kaplan
said. "No girls in those clingy
iron-on shirts, no novelty lunch
boxes and no late-night drunk
en choruses of a certain sound
track that rhymes with Hatter
Gay Fight Beaver. Oh, yeah â€”
and no playing ball in the
house!"
Kaplan was immediately
impeached.
