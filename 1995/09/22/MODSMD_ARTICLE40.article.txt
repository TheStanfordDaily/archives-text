# ALL-CONSUMING PASSION
## The 						products of our generation 
### 
I S TAKHN TWENTY-SOME YEARS
a of social programming and mil
lions of hours of television satu
-1 ration, but it has finally been
accomplished. The advertising
industry has created the perfect con
sumer generation.
I realized this last week when I saw a TV
commercial lor Red Wolf beer. I was about six
hours into an afternoon of sports programming,
so I was already susceptible to subtext, when 1
started thinking....
"Red Wolf — yeah, man. I'm like a red wolf.
I'm mysterious and solitary, stalking moonlit forest
glades. Totally. I'm a red wolf, dude. I hunt alone
because I'm like, you know, a lone hunter and shit.
So I bought a six-pack of Red Wolf. As I sat
down with my first beer, I noticed I did feel a lit
tle more ferocious. Bv the fifth beer, I was down
right savage.
Anyway, Eve decided to stop fighting and be the
consumer I was born to be. Most of mv opinions
and v,dues have been provided by I V as it is. So |
figure, what the lies lor a lew mcaslv dollars I
can have a brand new self image laboriously crafted
b\ the nation's finest advertising thinkers!
I irst things lirst. I went out vesterda\ and
bought a liillette twin razor. I figured, those guys
that use (iillctte razors on EV are real manly like
and sew. (Now don t get me wrong, I 111 plcntv
manlx like. After all. I wear Patagonia outdoor xvear.
You can tell just In looking at that label that Em

rugged, man. I'm
probably out
climbing some
breathtaking vista
right now.)
Armed with my
close, comfortable

shave, I went out to
get some more prod
ucts — the kind of
products that say,
"Hey. I'm young and
hip and tree. I'm the
kind ol guy who goes
clubbing, reads Details
and has a lot of sex."

i got some
cologne because
Kate Moss digs
guys that smell
somewhere between
love and madness.
Then I bought a pair

of Hoc Martens because I'm the type
of blue-collar fellow that can afford
really expensive impostor work boots.
Also, because I'm thrill-seeking and

dangerous, I got me a top-of-the-line 15-speed
mountain bike that hangs upside down in my
apartment, right next to my cross-country skis and
snowboard.
I felt pretty good, but something was missing.
So I replaced all my furniture with cool post-mod
ern wood finish stuff that looks like it came off a
C aribbean cargo boat. 1 hen I bought some matte
bl.uk electronic devices and wired them .ill togeth
er into ,1 central remote system with stereo sur
round sound. I inally, I just put .1 down payment
on a I and Rover — a mighty juggernaut of a vehi
cle that can handle all terrains and go for 8,000

on a single tai '■% 1
of gas. Unfort
nately, I dint;
the bumper on i j

telephone pole so now it's in the shop.
Granted, all these changes have been .1 1
expensive, hut that's OK. Because Commero. 1 !
her infinite wisdom, has provided me with a w.i t
full ot credit cards. It's a warm feeling, actually, li
ing merged into this grand, all-encompassing ent
that is consumer America. Not unlike, say, the v\
a massive gelatinous space blob incorporates 1
local townsfolk into itself, dissolving them slow
and painfull until their boiling fits li is liter.ill
melted from their —
Whoa! Sorry, getting .1 little off track there. Bi
you see my point.
