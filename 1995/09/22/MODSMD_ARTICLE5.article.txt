ABRIKF BUT MHMORABLK KIMDHMIC OF FIJI.I. MOON
fever struck Stanford U. in June when resource
ful psychology students turned a class project
into a Guinness record. Well, almost.

The group of students tested the
limits of marketing influence by
publicizing Moon at Noon, an orga
nized protest against university poli
cies and an attempt to set the record
tor mass mooning.
What the mooners and gawkers
alike didn't know was that the
"protest" was actually part of a
research project testing theories of
influence used by advertisers and
salespeople. The students had to use
social-influence techniques to
encourage people to do something
they wouldn't ordinarily do.
With a tempting lack of
mooning records in the Guinness
Book to inspire them, the stu

dents posted fliers and contacted
local newspapers and radio sta
tions to maximize coverage and
interest in the event.
And unwitting students at Stan
ford took to the idea .is .1 rebellious
move against what they felt were
increasingly strict rules set by the
university.
"Moon organizers had to grin
and bare it along with approximate
ly 220 cheeky drawer-droppers and
700 witnessing jaw-droppers who
showed up at the crack of noon to
lend their buns to the cause.
