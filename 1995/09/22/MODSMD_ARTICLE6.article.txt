• Gina Grant will attend Tufts U. this fall. Grant was initially accepted by Har
vard U. and Columbia U., but both universities rescinded after admissions officials
discovered that in 1990 she had pleaded no contest to manslaughter charges for
the death of her mother.
• Remember the Harvard murder/suicide from last spring (junior Sinedu
Tadesse stabbed her roommate, junior Trang Ho, 45 times and then hanged her
self)? Been wondering what more has come out (especially since before the inci
dent, the school newspaper had received a note and picture of Tadesse reading,
"Keep this picture. There will soon be a very juicy story involving the person in this
picture.")? Keep wondering. The Harvard Crimson turned over the note and photo to
police, and the Middlesex County district attorney's office has nothing new to
report on the case, says D.A. spokesperson John Towle.
• U.S. District Court Judge C. Weston Houck ruled in June that Shannon Faulk
ner, the first woman member of the Citadel's all-male cadet program, will not live
in the school's infirmary — apart from the male cadets — or receive a less strenu
ous training program. Citadel officials withdrew their request that Faulkner shave
her head in the fall when she begins the cadet program.
• During promotions of its college football coverage, ABC Sports is airing music
performed by the Michigan State U. marching band. Eighty-five of the band's 285
members recorded a fight song in June to be used in the spots.
