Thhsk days, it's not
a question of if you
are going to college
but whereâ€” four-year uni
versity or community col
lege? But what if even that
choice was taken away?
Outrageous? Not to the Califor
nians for Community College Equi
ty, who have proposed to eliminate
all freshman and sophomore classes
at state universities and shift them
to 107 community colleges.
"Community college transfers are
outperforming the people who start
as freshmen at University of Califor
nia and California State University
schools," says Robert Oliphant,
executive director of CCCK. "You're
not only saving money, but you also
improve the quality of the upper
division programs.'
U. of California, Berkeley, senior
Mark l.eong doesn't see a problem
with the proposal. "1 went to com
munity college first, and 1 don't
think the experience diminishes my
education," he says.
Could this signal the end of
freshman life as we know it?
"I think this idea sucks," says
Deidra Hale, a freshman at CSU,
Northridge. "Being forced into a
community college regardless of
how well we do in high school is
unfair because it takes away our
choice.
"If I'm smart enough to get into
a university, 1 should be able to go
to that university," agrees Cecelia
Waring, a CSU, Sacramento,
sophomore.
"There are a lot of myths sur
rounding this idea, says Charles
Lindahl, associate vice chancellor of
the CSU system. "Where they
implemented it, it failed.
Florida put the concept to the
test in the '60s by creating four
upper-division-only universities, but
thev weren't equipped to adapt to

the state's rapidly growing popula
tion, says Alan Stonecipher,
spokesperson tor the Florida State
U. System Board of Regents.

"We had to keep changing and
adding on to the university system,'
Stonecipher says. "So in 1981, the
legislature authorized lower divi
sions for those four universities."
Under the new system, student
could save some serious cash, but
what expense?
"It they do this, there isn't .11
incentive to do well in high schoo
Hale says."I studied hard, help
out in student government, voli
tecrcd, and I don't know if I wo
have done it it someone told nu
only place I could start w.is
community college."
