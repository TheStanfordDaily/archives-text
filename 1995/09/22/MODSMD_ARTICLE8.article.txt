# Go Speed Racer, Go!

SOMK KIDS SETTLE FOR TEH BALL AND MAJOR
league dreams. Others dribble on the play
ground, hoping for dunks in the Final Four.

Not Adam Friend. Fie found
inspiration on a race track in
Maine and pursued his dream to
race stock cars — and New
Hampshire College picked up
part of the tab.
Friend, a junior at New
Hampshire College, persuaded
his school to give him an athletic
scholarship — worth more than
$ I 5,000 — to race.
"When I went looking for a
sponsor, I knew 1 couldn't ask
Pepsi or Pennzoil, because they
probably weren't going to give
that kind of money to a raw
rookie," says Friend, who's 21.
"So I said to my parents, 'What
about the school?' I hey thought
I d flown over the cuckoo's nest,
but that only made me want to
do it 110 percent more.
Armed with plenty of enthusi
asm and a detailed proposal,
Friend took his dream straight to
the president of the 1,100-stu
dent college. Friend sold the
administration on his unique idea
for representing the college, and
they gave him the green light and

some cash. Although the Maine
Ford Dealers give Friend some
financial support, New Hamp
shire College is his main sponsor.
From the cuckoo's nest to the
American-Canadian 18-race tour
circuit, Friend's proposal has
taken off. He's probably the only
driver to show up at races with a
Ford Thunderbird bearing his
school's name and blue-and-vel
low colors.
"1 knew if I could make this
thing fly, it would be good for
the school," Friend says.
And with the exception of the
all-too-frequent speeding ticket
he gets when lie's feeling compet
itive on the highways of New
Fngland, Friend says he has tried
not to let racing change his life as
a student.
"People don't look at me like a
celebrity or anything, he says.
"And I don't expect them to. I go
to college and people see me every
day. I'm just a regular person."
