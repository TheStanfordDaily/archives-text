CIIKIS F.RNIM IS AI Ills His I Will \
he's not himself. I lu- junior from
Michigan's Wayne State U. has
played everything from McDonalds "Mac
lonight to Michigan State L'.'s "Sparty to
the Detroit I iuers "Paws.

I rncst is clawing his was through
school as a professional mascot.
I he I erndale, Mich., native got
his start in 1989. A ninth grader at
the time, I r nest began to shine as
the "Mac l onight moon man for
public appearances in the Detroit
area. "Mv mom worked lor the gu\
who made appearances as Ronald
McDonald, and the\ needed some
body to lill in, he s.ivs. I was |iist
in the right place .it the right time.
I hen came stints as his high
school mascot and later as Michigan
States Spans Spartan. Ks that
time, he s.ivs, mascoting was in his
blood.
But when I rncst first stepped
onto the lush, green grass of I iger
Stadium this summer, he knew his
dream had come true. I witling his
orange and black striped tail in his
hand, I rnest debuted as the I igcrs
first mascot "l'aws.
"I just sent in m\ resume, he
s.ivs. " I here were about 100 of us.

I here wasn't an actual trvout, just
an interview process. I he\ knew m\
talents ahead of time, I guess.
I rnest s favorite part of the job is
playing cat and mouse with the
c rowd.
I lie fans are rc.ilk starting to
like me, he savs. "I enjo\ being able
to get smiles on the kids faces. It's
just the biggest rush. I just love to
get people all pumped up.
But getting people pumped up
every d.iv has its down side, too.
"I haven t had a day off in, like,
three months. 1 rnest savs. "But I
love it.
I n addition to I igcrs games,
I rnest appears as Paws for birth
davs, weddings and other functions.
I he onl\ thing I won't do is
bachelorette parties, I rnest sass
with .is much pride as a man in a
tiger suit can have. " 1 hat's just
something for the reputation of the
organi/at ion.
I rnest transferred from Michi-

gan State to Wayne State this fall to
be closer to his job. but he savs he
won t tr\ out tor the mascot job
there. I m wav too busv with
Detroit. I inest s,i\s And I'm not
even sure Wayne State has a mas
cot.
I inest, a broadcast journalism
major, says he d like to be the
I igers mascot tor another five to 10
years before pursuing his ultimate
careet goal sports broadcasting.
I i nest doesn t have a long term
contract with the I igers, and he
won i sa\ how much money he
makes not even a ballpark figure.
Put he s not ruling out the idea ot
st,i\ ing in his c ui rent field.
\\ ho knows what will happen,
he s.i\s. "Maybe I can make the
I iger mascot bigger than lite,
mavhc even bigger than the San
Diego ( liicken.
