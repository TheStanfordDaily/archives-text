# 3-0-1!
## Football undefeated for first time since '86 season 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. This team is for real. Believe it.
Although it's far too early to be talking bowl games,
Stanford made its initial mark on the Pacific 10 Confer
ence schedule in convincing fashion Saturday against de
fending division champion ()regon. The ('ardmal, picked
last in the Pac-10 by many preseason prophets, up-ended
12th-ranked Oregon 28-21 at Aut/en Stadium.
The victory over the Ducks (3-1 overall, 1-1 in the
Pac-10) may be exactly what it takes to catapult Stan
ford (3-0-1, 1-0) into the national spotlight. However,
the feat still isn't enough to impress t he, as always, im
perturbable Tyrone Willingham.
"This is only as big as one game gets," said the Car
dinal's first-year head coach "It does not make a sea
son. What it does is allow us to maintain our momen
tum and remain undefeated
Other members of the Stanford coaching staff were
a little more jubilant in their approval of Saturday's
outcome.
"You're trying to get these kid.- to believe what
you're doing is right," said defensive coordinator Bill
1 larris. "And then you go out and beat a team like Ore
gon. That does a lot.
"Oregon is a good football team We're happy as
dogs. We beat them at borne
On a day when the Cardinal erased from its memo

I Hicks, it was fitting that the big play of the game came

mind.

Eliel Swinton after their upset win Saturday over the University of Oregon. 28-21.
I knew I had to redeem myself to
the team. Someone was looking
out for me. It was pretty sweet to
take it all the way."
The 96-yard return marked the
second time this season Stanford
has brought a kickoff back for a
score. Sophomore Damon Dunn
also ran one back 91 yards in the
season opener at San Jose State.
Kvans' run also showed how
deadly the Cardinal s return

Oregon 21
Stanford 28

Oregon s momentum, which had
been building, fell completely
apart as Stanford went up 21-14.
" The kickoff return was the big
play of the game," said senior
quarterback Mark Butterfield.
"The fans were getting on Marlon
because of the foul. Five minutes
later he comes back and makes
that play."
On the Cardinal's second drive
of the fourth quarter, Butterfield,
who threw 12 completions on 22
attempts for 186 yards, helped
engineer a 89-yard drive that
gave Stanford a two-touchdown
lead.
On a key third-down play, But
terfield completed a pass to senior
receiver Mark Harris across the
middle for 10 yards and the first
down. On third-and-seven from
Stanford's 41, Butterfield hit
junior flanker Brian Manning on
a deep fade for a 31-yard gain.
Manning made the play despite
tight coverage by Oregon's Alex
Molden, a first team all-confer
ence selection in 1994.
"Someone tipped my hand and
the ball didn't go exactly where 1
wanted it to," Butterfield said,
'"but Brian came back and got it."
The Cardinal burned Molden
again two plays later. Butterfield
connected on another deep fade to
senior flanker Andre Kirwan for a
28-yard touchdown. Kirwan, rac
ing down the right sideline, dove
into the endzone, and, with Mold
en's arm in his face, came up with
the ball. The noisy crowd of web
foot faithful — numbering
45,237, the sixth largest in stadi
um history — fell silent.
"Molden is a great corner, but I

saw that the safety was fading to
tht' other side and [Kirwan] was
one-on-one with Molden," Butter
field said. "1 gave Andre a chance
and he made the catch."
"I just said 'Get to it and get
the job done,' " Kirwan said. "I
got close and dove and came up
with it."
With the score at 28-14, it was
now up to Stanford's defense to
preserve the win in the remaining
five minutes. 19 seconds. This it
accomplished, showing in the pro
cess a backbone that had been
absent for most of the previous
two seasons. However, any Duck
fans that left the stands early
missed an exciting ending.
Rejuvenated in the second half
after Oregon coach Mike Bellotti
yanked him out of the game
towards the end of the first,
Graziani took the Ducks quickly
from their own 20 to the Stanford
5, hitting a number of his backs
and receivers on the drive.
One of these completions
proved very costly, however.
McLemore, leveled by junior free
safety Josh Madsen after a 10-
yard gain, was carried off the field
with a back injury. The Ducks'
deep threat, had caught 11 passes
for 176 yards on the day. Losing
McLemore would make the unen
viable Oregon task of putting
together two touchdown drives
even more difficult.
But after 10- and 12-yard com
pletions to Whittle, Graziani fin
ished the first of what the Ducks
hoped to be two scoring drives
with a 5-yard strike to wide out
Damon Ricketts in the fronl left
corner of the endzone with 2:58
left to play.
The weary Cardinal defense
then made its way off the field but
were soon called back on again.
Oregon recovered an onside kick
after the ball ricocheted off junior
safety Alistair White, the hero of
Stanford's 27-20 victory at Utah.
"I expected it to bounce and it
didn't," White said. "It skidded
and hit my leg and I saw it get
away. 1
With starting field position at
their own 46. Graziani and the
Ducks had a good chance to even
the score considering how tired
the Cardinal defensive front had
become after Oregon's scoring
drive. But after allowing Oregon
one first down, the defense
clamped down.
Sophomore defensive end Carl
1 lansen first sacked Graziani for a

two-yard loss. Madsen then hit
Duck split end Jibri 1 lodge on sec
ond down, forcing him to drop a
pass. Sophomore defensive end
Kailee Wong, a Eugene native,
pressured Graziani into throwing
an incomplete pass on third down.
Finally, on fourth down, Graziani
failed to connect with Damon
Griffin, giving the Stanford
offense the ball to run out the last
2:10.
" The defense was smiling out
there in the fourth quarter," said
senior cornerback Kwame Ellis.
"We knew we were going to win
the game. Fatigue will not be an
enemy of this ball club."
It easily might have been how
ever Oregon ran 93 plays on Sat
urday, an abnormally high num
ber.
"We were fortunate to get
home on that last drive," Bill
Harris said. "First, you're out
there 20 plays [on the 80-yard
touchdown drive). Then, with
the onside kick, we were out
there again. We were tired,
believe me."
The Ducks put the ball in the
air 58 times in hopes of eventual
ly catching the Cardinal, the most
passes attempted against Stan
ford since San Diego State in
15)87. Harris was very pleased
with this figure, as it meant that
Whittle (averaging 106 yards per
game on the ground) was not con
trolling the tempo of the game.
The Oregon back finished with 72

yards on 21 carries.
"I wish they would've thrown
60 times," Bill Harris said. "I said
on Friday that if they're throwing
50 times, we're going to win."
Many of those throws found
receivers and yardage, however.
Oregon gained 345 yards in the
air. Throw in 109 yards on the
ground and the Ducks amassed
454 yards of total offense, over
150 more than Stanford.
Most of the yardage came in
the second half, however, as
Graziani and the Duck offense
ran into problems in the first.
After beginning the game with a
convincing 80-yard touchdown
drive that ended with an 11-yard
pass to McLemore, Graziani,
whom Bellotti referred to as "the
best quarterback in the confer
ence," fell apart.
The Ducks got the ball back
after Stanford went three-and
out. On the next Oregon drive,
the Duck quarterback, pressured
by the Cardinal defensive line,
threw into the Cardinal secondary
where Madsen intercepted the
ball for his second pick of the
year.
After a 3-yard return to the
Duck 37, Stanford began its own
scoring drive, spearheaded by the
running of junior Mike Mitchell,
making his return to the lineup
after a two-week absence due to
an elbow injury. The Cardinal
evened the game at seven on
junior Greg Cornelia's one-yard

run around right end.
When Oregon regained posses
sion, it didn't take long for
Graziani to give it right back to
Stanford. On the third play from
scrimmage, nose tackle John
Hebert crashed through the
Duck offensive line. Graziani,
hoping to avoid the sack, threw
wildly down the field where Stan
ford's White made the pick at the
Cardinal 48.
Afterwards, a screen pass to
sophomore Anthony Bookman
resulted in a 14-yard gain. Stan
ford then marched to the Oregon
26 after a defensive holding penal
ty. following a 9-yard run by
Mitchell and a 10-yard surge by
Cornelia which knocked Oregon
strong safety Jaiya Figueras out
of the game, Bookman scampered
into the endzone to put Stanford
up 14-7.
"IThe Ducks] play hard," said
Mitchell, who ran 11 times for 57
yards. "They're a good team. But
it was just another challenge.
They said they could stop us, and
we took up the challenge. In the
first half, we proved that we could
run."
The Stanford pass rush forced
another Graziani error a short
time later. Throwing just as he
was hit, the Duck quarterback
surrendered an interception to
junior cornerback Leroy Pruitt.
"Everybody wants to get out
there and make plays," said junior
defensive end Brian Werner.

"That's the bottom line here."
Bellotti could not stand any
more of Graziani's errors, pulling
him in favor of backup Ryan
Perry-Smith on the next drive.
The substitute took the Ducks
over mid-field, assisted by a refer
ee's inadvertent whistle which
negated a Perry-Smith fumble
which Stanford would have recov
ered.
"We were disappointed because
we thought we had a chance at the
ball," Willingham said. "We
thought there was a fumble."
As a result, instead of having
the ball, the Cardinal was trying
to prevent the Ducks from scor
ing. Oregon drove to the Stanford
28 before Hebert sacked Perrv-
Smith for a six-yard loss. That
placed the Ducks out of the range
of their field-goal kicker.
Again and again, the Cardinal
stepped up to make the big plays
that were needed. Although sta
tistically speaking, the Ducks
whooped up on Stanford, whenev
er something needed to be done, it
got done. Stanford capitalized on
Oregon errors and made few of its
own. The contest was a far cry
from 1994, when the squad found
ways to lose games.
"This is really different,"
Mitchell said. "For the first time
in three years, we cashed in.
"The defense played great.
Once the offense gets clicking on
all cylinders, we're going to be a
good team."
