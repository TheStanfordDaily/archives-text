## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff Writer 
"No means no! was the message that
about 60 marchers sent to a serial rapist, or
any would-he rapist, Saturday morning in
Palo Alto. Insisting that area residents cannot
live in fear, speakers outside City Hall offered
advice on how to stay safe and work to
improve society, followed by very practical
lessons in self-defense.
The march was staged in response to a seri
al rapist who has attacked seven women in
I'alo Alto, Menlo Park and Sunnyvale since
Aug 21.
"I heard too many women say they weren't
willing to go out and do things because of the
rapist that's out there, and I decided 1 didn't
want to live in that community,'' said Jade,
the Stacey's Bookstore employee who orga
nized the march and who goes by only one
name.

"Power has been taken
away from the people in the
community and given to the
rapist," Jade told the crowd.
"Our intent today is to take
that power back."
After gathering in Lytton
Plaza at 11:30 a.m.. the pro
cession traveled the short dis
tance to City Hall, led by a
sign that read "Palo Alto
Fights Back." As the crowd

listened in the sun, speeches were punctuated
by the ringing of a hell every six minutes
how frequently, on average, a rape occurs in
America.
Alexandria Jacobs, who was raped at gun
point two years ago, told the crowd that she
was there to "put a lace to faceless victims'
and spread the word that sexual assault is
unacceptable.
"The effect of silence on rape is denial. " she
said. "And the outcome is that it keeps on hap
pening."
Women in particular fall victim to rape, ;tnd
Jade said women are not sale anywhere on this
planet. Yet several speakers pointed out that
women cannot live in fear, holed no in then

houses, which would oe a tragedy in itself.
Following the speeches, several people pre
sented safety tips. Ethel "High Test" Konop
ka, one of four red-bereted Guardian Angels
present, urged women to be aware of their
surroundings and use common sense.
Two teams of self-defense trainers then dis
played techniques to deter would-be rapists,
I rom a palm t<> t he nose or a knee in the groin
to heating the attacker with various house
hold objects.
The demonstrations, and indeed the whole
event, seemed to excite the receptive crowd.
Maria Steyn, a Stanford co-terminal student,

said she attended the march "because I think
rape is something people need to be aware of. . .
(and) to show that people are intolerant of
rape."
Added senior Vanja Stenius, "Modifying
your behavior to avoid |rape| is not solving the
problem. It's just avoiding it. Steps need to be
taken to show this is not acceptable."
Students interested in self-defense courses
taught at I niversitv Lutheran Church can
call 497-7432. Self-defense courses are also
available through the Palo Alto YWCA, and a
free two-hour defense workshop will take
place Fridav at the Bav Area Model Mugging
