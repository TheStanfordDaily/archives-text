## Israel, PLO agree to sign pact ending West Bank occupation 
### 
TABA, Egypt (AP) — After all
night talks, a shouting match and
an angry walkout by Yasser Arafat,
Israel and the PLO agreed yester
day to sign a pact at the White
1 louse ending nearly three decades
of Israeli occupation of West Bank
cities.
The agreement, the second
phase of the 1993 Israel-PLO peace
treaty, was hailed by Palestinian
leaders as a major step toward cre
ating their own state. Other Pales
tinians said it gave them too little,
and militant Jewish settlers vowed
to do anything necessary to scuttle
it.
The 460-page pact allows for
Palestinian self-rule in 30 percent
of the West Bank — containing
most of its Arab population — after
a step-by-step Israeli pullout.
Israel has occupied the lands since
the 1967 Mideast War.
The plan also allows for Pales
tinian elections.
The accord was initialed in
Taba, an Egyptian resort on the
Red Sea, bv the chief negotiators,
Ahmed Qureia of the Palestine

Liberation Organization and
Israel's Uri Savir, just before the
Jewish New Year holiday. The
signing in Washington is set for
Thursday.
"We will work so that this new
year will be a real year of peace,"
said Arafat, the PLO chairman.
"This agreement will open the door
for a better future ... to create a
new Middle East of security and
peace."
The agreement followed night
long talks that capped more than
80 hours of tense negotiations.
Earlier yesterday, a shouting
match erupted between Arafat and
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres and the PLO leader stormed
out.
Arafat was angry that Israel
refused to expand the borders of
the self-rule enclave in Jericho.
There were also reports he wanted
a more specific timetable for the
release of about 5,000 Palestinians
in Israeli jails.
But Arafat relented after
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin promised to discuss the

prisoner issue in Washington
before Thursday's signing, Pales
tinian sources said. Other officials
said talks got back on track after
intervention by U.S. Mideast coor
dinator Dennis Ross and Egyptian
officials.
Peres called the accord "history
in the real meaning of the word."
"It is a tremendous attempt to
bring people that were born in the
same cradle, who were fighting on
the same fronts, to agree on a new
112 uture," he said.
President Clinton called the
agreement "a big step on the road
to a just and lasting peace in the
Middle East."
Extremists on both sides of the
political divide in Israel and the
West Bank pledged to wreck the
accord.
Militant Jewish settlers warned
of bloodshed and vowed violent
opposition. And as news of the pact
spread in the West Bank, Palestini
an youths hurled stones at Israeli
soldiers in two cities. In Nablus, a
youth was killed in a fourth day of
clashes.

In Hebron, protesting youths
were disappointed the agreement
will not bring a full Israeli with
drawal. Some troops are to
remain to protect the 450 settlers
living among the city's 120,000
Palestinians.
The agreement detailed securi
ty measures aimed at preventing
conflict between radicals among
the 140,000 Jewish settlers and
the 1 million Arabs in the West
Bank.
A summary of the agreement said
it would "allow the Palestinians to
conduct their own internal affairs,
reduce points of friction between
Israelis and Palestinians and open a
new era of cooperation and coexis
tence based on common interest, dig
nity and mutual respect."
Rabin said Palestinians would
get control over 30 percent of the
2,270-square-mile West Bank,
which is about the size of
Delaware.
The accord distinguishes
between the seven cities where
there will be full autonomy
Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarm, Qaiqilya,

Ramallah, Bethlehem and most of
Hebron — and rural areas where
overriding security authority will
remain in Israeli hands.
The 12,000-strong Palestinian

police force is expected to carry out
joint patrols with Israelis in some
areas. But the Palestinian police
will not have authority to arrest
Israelis.
