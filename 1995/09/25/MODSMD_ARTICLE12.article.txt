Terror trial jury in deliberation
NEW YORK (A P) — Prosecutors in the biggest terrorism
trial in U.S. history accused Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and
nine others of hatching a "monstrous" plot to kill thousands
of people in a series of bombings in New York.
But by the time the jury began deliberating Saturday, the
defense had put the tactics of the nation's top law enforce
ment agency on trial, accusing the FBI of plotting to frame
the defendants to revive its reputation.
Abdel-Rahman, a blind, Egyptian religious leader, i
charged with leading 14 Muslims in a plot to bomb the United
Nations, the FBl's Manhattan offices, tin 1 Holland and Lin
coin tunnels and the George Washington Bridge all in a sin
gle day.
Three defendants pleaded guilty, a fourth testified for the
government and a fifth will be tried later. The remaining K
defendants, if convicted, face maximum prison sentences
ranging from life to 20 years. Deliberations continued yester

day and are expected to last about two weeks.
No more 55?
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is cruising toward a
repeal of federal speed limits despite a simple law of nature —
drive faster and you raise the risk of dying or getting horribly
hurt in a crash.
Survey after survey found that true in most states where
the 55 mph speed limit on rural interstates has been raised to
65. Fatalities rose 20 percent on average — a loss of 400 to
500 more lives a year, according to the Insurance Institute for
1 lighway Safety.
Hut between anti-Washington sentiment, the clamor for
states' rights, and relatively cheap gas, safety has taken a
back seat to convenience: Congress expected to reconcile
I louse and Senate versions of a repeal this week.
Motorists itching to hit the accelerator look forward to swing
the clock turn back to 1973, when states set their own limits.
The range was up to 75 mph, except in Montana and Nevada.
