JERUSALEM (AP) - Yasser
Arafat wished Israelis a happy
Jewish New Year in Hebrew
yesterday, but Israel was on
high alert yesterday against pos
sible attacks by Palestinian rad
icals who want to sabotage
peace talks.
A smiling Arafat declared
"Shana Tova," or good new
year, before negotiators ini
tialed a pact in Taba, Egypt, on
expanding Palestinian self-rule.
Israel's foreign minister, Shi
mon Peres, reciprocated with a
similar greeting in Arabic.
But police were posted in
malls and outdoor markets

jammed with holiday shoppers,
guarding against Palestinian
militants who have waged a
two-year campaign of bombings
and shootings in an attempt to
derail the talks with Israel.
As the holiday began yester
day evening, Israelis gathered
for festive family dinners
including fish and apples dipped
in honey to express wishes for a
sweet new year.
The New Year marks the
start of a 10-day period of soul
searching, known as the "Days
of Awe," during which Jews
believe God decides who lives
and dies in the coming year.
