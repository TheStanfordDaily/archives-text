# End in sight at Simpson trial

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Remember
them, prosecutors will tell jurors.
Remember Nicole and Ron — a slender
blonde in a black halter dress, a handsome
young man in jeans and a tailored shirt —
and the violence visited upon them. Remem
ber the river of blood.
For prosecutors, the challenge of final
arguments in the O.J. Simpson murder trial
begins tomorrow with resurrecting the vic
tims whose memory has faded in and out
throughout the trial.
For defense attorneys, summation offers
the chance to turn jurors' eyes in another
direction — toward the racism, lies and
frame-up allegations that constitute the
heart of the defense.
Yes, remember the victims, the defense
will say. O.J. Simpson remembers, too. He
grieves for the mother of his t wo young chil
dren. and he did not kill her.
Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. is

likely to return to the themes of his opening
statement, delivered eight long months ago:
Simpson was framed, set up, victimized.
And he will seek to convince jurors that the
evidence is such a mess it would be a crime
to convict Simpson.
"Johnnie Cochran will be over the top,"
predicted Loyola University law professor
Laurie Levenson. "He will be waving the
flag and speaking from the mount."
She said he'll also offer jurors "a smor
gasbord of doubts to choose from."
Emotion will work better for the defense
than the prosecution, Levenson said,
although summoning images of the victims
is key to the presentation.
"The victims have gotten lost," said Lev
enson, who has spent many days of the trial
in the courtroom.
Simpson is charged with the June 12,
1994, slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown
Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
