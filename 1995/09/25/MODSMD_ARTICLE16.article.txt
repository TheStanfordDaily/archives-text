# Editor's welcome
## 
### 
Never let km see you
sweat — not showing on
the* outside what is going on
inside — is a familiar concept to
most of us.
In 14 years of ballet class, I was
always taught to "make it look
easy," to smile even if your toes
were bleeding or the step was par
ticularly hard. In the same way, I
remember being worried that if I
cried in front of my elementary
school classmates, they would
think less of me.
The Daily is something of a
reflection about the people who put
it out, but its outward appearance
rarely shows the internal staff
changes the organization goes
through twice each year. Every new
editor hates to admit it, hut most
readers will only notice some dif
ferent names in the staff box on the
bottom of this page, once in
September and again in February.
Outside, our stories, photos and
headlines look much the same.
Too much change, like the little
boy who cried wolf, can be confus
ing and misleading for both our
staff and our readers. So in some
ways it's a good thing that you, the
reader, will probably not notice any
major changes in The Daily's pages
this volume even though our entire
staff is new.
In other ways, it's not so good.
The Daily is one of those campus
organizations that everyone loves
to hate, and there have been plenty
of times in the last few years when
I've wished that some of our
biggest critics could see just how
much heartache and debate went
into a particular decision.
As an organization, The Daily
has gone through a lot in the last
two years. There have been con
flicts and mendings, falling-outs
and making-ups, mistakes and cor
rections, and plenty of internal
changes. But even if you've been
reading it all this time, you proba
bly haven't seen most of that.
What you won't see on your
pages this volume, then, is where
The Daily stands now. After a year
of upheaval and a year spent
redefining ourselves, there are very
few experienced staffers left. The
staff this volume is young —
younger than usual — and while
they bring in fresh ideas, the lack

of experience is The Daily's great
est challenge right now.
Putting out a paper is not so
hard, but putting out a good paper
is a real challenge. That's why
learning and experience are so
important at The Daily. The orga
nization has been around for 104
years; I doubt it will go away any
time soon. Hut if we want to con
tinue to be the best source of cam
pus information that we can possi
bly be, we need to build a stronger
foundation for the future.
You may wonder why I'm telling
you all this. The reason is so that
when you read The Daily this year,
you'll be aware that what you see
on the paper's pages is a learning
process. In many ways, it will be a
nice thing to watch if you keep your
eyes open for it. We'll have the abil
ity to try new, creative things and
avoid being bound by all of the past
conventions.
It's also so that you can recog
nize the decision-making process
that we go through nearly every
day. If there's something you don't
like, realize that it's not necessari
ly the product of irresponsible,
malicious journalists, but the
result of an often heated debate
about what our responsibilities and
roles are. Offer us your opinion if
you disagree — you'll find us open
to suggestions.
And finally, understand that we
are going to make mistakes. Give
us the opportunity to learn from
those errors. At the same time,
don't hold past errors against us.
We have a lot of hard work in
front of us, but I have every confi
dence that this young staff is up to
the task. Along with youth comes
energy and creativity, and how
these two qualities channel into a
responsible and readable product is
something I'm excited to see. This
year, I hope to find that the energy
inside the organization is visible
outside as well.
