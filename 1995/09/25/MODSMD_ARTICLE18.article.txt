## A
						wealth of resources after Stanford 
### 
THE STANFORD
Alumni Associa
tion, in Bowman
Alumni House, is nes
tled under the canopy of
magnificent oak trees
located just off of
Tresidder's back patio.
As fresh student faces
arrive on campus, we

hope they'll find their way to our
doorstep. The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion is dedicated to reaching, serving, and
engaging all Stanford alumni. Life after
Stanford, from our perspective, truly
begins while you are still students on the
Farm.
The seeds of involvement are planted
in the form of the Student Alumni Net
work (STAN). STAN is a student volun
teer group which organizes many of the
on-campus student alumni career panels
and coordinates student alumni brunch
es that take place in the homes of local
Bay Area alumni each spring. The Alum
ni Association also operates the award
winning Student Mentor Program which
allows interested, self-motivated stu
dents to select career mentors from a
pool of hundreds of local alumni. Addi
tionally, the Alumni Contact Service is a
database of over 6,000 alumni volunteers
across the country whom Stanford stu
dents and alumni can contact for infor
mational interviews and career network
ing.

Hopefully you will be wise enough to
reap the benefits of such programs while
you're still in school. Where else can you
sit down to brunch with the founder of a
major Bay Area consulting and business
management firm or have the chief of
consu'tation at UC-San Francisco Medi
cal School as your personal "big buddy?"
Stanford connections you make now
could potentially be great resources for
you down the road.
And when that road leads past gradu
ation, it will be paved with programs to
cultivate your interests further. The Bay
Area alone hosts a Professional Women's
Group and the Cardinal Young Alumni
Association, which plans events for
recent graduates to socialize and grow in
their first five years out of school.
No mat ter where the winds of change
carry you after graduation, Stanford
Alumni Association networks are in place
to reach, serve and engage you and to
nurture strong intellectual and emotion
al connections between the University
and the Stanford family. One such con
nection is the award-winning Stanford
Magazine. Also, we will soon launch the
Stanford On-Line Alumni Resource Sys
tem (SOLAR System), which will serve as
an information and communications ser
vice for all alumni of Stanford. Initially,
SOLAR will offer on-line information
about SAA events, Web pages for alumni
clubs around the world and links to on
line information published by University

departments. In the future, we may offer
e-mail and Web page accounts, on-line
distance learning programs and much
more.
"But all this awaits me in the future.
I don't have to know about any of this
now," you may be telling yourself. To
many students, life after Stanford seems
like a distant footnote on the pages of a
crowded Stanford calendar, it's really
not too early, though, to plant the seeds
of awareness, activity and growth now.
More than a few alumni can attest to the
fact that one's Stanford career seems to
pass as quickly as the changing of the
seasons. You don't have to take my word
for it â€” just take a moment to talk to
some of the alumni as they return to
campus for Reunion Homecoming Oct.
12-15, or better yet, volunteer to be a stu
dent helper for the weekend! It's yet
another great opportunity to learn first
hand from former students who walked
on the Farm before you.
We hope you'll embrace our invitation
to visit the Alumni Association and learn
more about the opportunities that await
you. We're here to expand your interests
and involvement for as long as you are a
part of the blossoming Stanford family.
And that, my fresh-faced friends, is for
life.

Kim Bluitt '92 is the program director for
student activities at the Stanford Alumni
Association.
