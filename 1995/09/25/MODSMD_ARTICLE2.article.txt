# User-friendly home page in the works
## 
### September TreviÃ±o Staff writer 
Those surfing the World Wide Web will soon
stumble upon a new University homo page that
officials sa> will capture the essenco of Stan
ford while providing a more user-friendly ap
proach.
"The goal is for it to be more efficient and
helpful to browsers," said Terry Shepard, di
rector of University communications. "It will
look different, and the content and organiza
tion will be changed."
The World Wide Web is a graphical exten
sion of the Internet which fuses words, pic
tures, sounds and virtual reality technology.
The University sent out 15 proposal requests
to graphic designers via e-mail in mid-August.
Six designers responded. While Shepard would
not disclose their names, he said that the pool in
cluded some alumni, a mechanical engineering
graduate student and firms from San Francisco

to the east coast
"We are getting real close,"
said Shepard, who expects a
designer to be selected bv the
end of the mont h.
Although Shepard would not
confirm, industry sources said
that the search has been nar
rowed to two of the pr< ip< isals.
The I niversity traditional
ly has designed the home page

in-house, without outside solicitation.
But Shepard said this time, the University
"wanted a professional designer with a lot of ex
perience with the Web," adding that the switch
will not he very expensive.
The bids are all clustered around $12,000,
plus or minus a couple thousand, he said.
"We're not spending much money on this,"
Shepard said. "It's about what we'd spend on a
design of a publicat ion wit h similar complexity. '
The difference between individual bids is a

measure of only a few thousand dollar , which
he added would allow t he I niversitv to choose
based on design as opposed to price.
The object of redesign is to control page size
to minimize scrolling, to make it faster and eas
ier to locate information and to encourage
schools and departments to adopt similar de
signs for their home pages.
Among slated changes, designers will recat
egorize information to increase efficiency and
to reduce confusion.
"Ideally, anyone going to the home page can
find what they are looking for quickly," Shep
ard said.
Shepard said that the I niversity may also
create more prominent categories for alumni
and individual schools, perhaps marking them
with special icons. But Shepard emphasized
that style is key.
"In the end, we want ... to represent our


Shepard
excellence and the attributes of
our University since this is the
gateway to Stanford for a lot who
haven't visited," he said. "We
want people to see the page and
say, 'Wow.'
"It's a good idea to get people

involved who are skilled (in
designing), said Don Geddis, a
research associate in the Comput
er Science Department who
designed the original home page
two years ago while pursuing his
Ph.D. in computer science. "It
shouldn't just be left in the hands
of people with computer experi
ence . . . you want to have a give
and take process. "
Pattv I loppe. design director

for the Stanford Design Group,
said the University also may be
interested in broadening its pool
of applicants to attract firms with
specialized experience in interac
tive window design for the Inter
net and with knowledge about
how to communicate to large
audiences.
There is still no word on what
the new Web pages will actually
look like, as a designer will not be

announced until the end of the
month. The University's home
page currently displays a picture
of the front of the Quad, including
Memorial Church. Shepard said
the new design could include any
thing from photos to a more
abstract representation of the
University.
The new home page should
appear on the University's Web
site this December, Shepard said.
