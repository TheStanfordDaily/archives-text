### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Welcoming the class of 1999, Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper on Fri
day encouraged entering freshmen to
explore all opportunities at Stanford,
hut warned them to be wary of catego
rization and stereotyping.
In a speech to over 800 112 resh men and
their parents in the Quad, Casper told
students that although they will
encounter hardships, they should
always persevere.
"As you cross bridges to meet
strangers at Stanford, the going will
sometimes be rough," he said. "That,
however, is part of the excitement that
Stanford offers you."
Casper implored students to find role
models, saying they were a necessity for
a successful education. He emphasized
Stanford's diversity in providing inspi
ration to students.
"To become a person . . . involves,
after all, the challenge to become one
sell in the roles one must play," Casper
said in his speech, entitled "On Playing
Hamlet." "Each student must be
accepted by each fellow student as an
autonomous individual, without regard

to his or her sex, race or any other fac
tor irrelevant to participation in the life
of t he I niversity."
Casper listed seven reasons why stu
dents attend Stanford, ranging from its
setting m Palo Alto to its global influ
ence throughout the Pacific Him and
the world He encouraged freshmen to
participate in all facets of Stanford's
intellectual and social atmosphere.
"Those of you who seize the initiative
and seek out the incredible range of
opportunities that Stanford has to offer
you across the entire spectrum of a very
comprehensive university and then
make choices, will be rewarded in ways
that are not easily matched anywhere,"
he said.
Casper cited alumni donations as a
major reason that Stanford is able to
offer these rewards "One day, Stanford
will therefore call on you, too, to display
the same sense of moral obligation to
help others that our alumni now show on
your behalf." he told the class of 1999.
Offering moral support, Casper
added that the millennium's final class
will create it.- own educational golden
age.
"Your opportunities are golden," he
said "Ifonk von make use of them, this

will be a golden age of education and
because of you, it will be one for us as
well."
Following Casper's remarks, Vice
Provost and Dean of Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds delivered a passionate
and often personal speech directed espe
cially to parents about the student's
separation from the family.
"You will probably miss their con
stant response to words of advice like
'oh really, I)ad' or 'oh, Mother,' " she
said. "My advice to you is just to relax.
Our children have the capacity to do
well in spite of us."
Edmonds encouraged introspection
among freshmen. "Rememl>er, this is
not a dress rehearsal," she said. "This is
your life. So seize the moment."
Orientation Coordinator Rich Stolz
ended the convocation with a final wel
come, discussing the series of events
which led him from a freshman listening
to the welcome to a senior giving one.
Students and parents found both
speeches inspiring. "I was touched. 1
was inspired," Branner resident Dan
Wolk said. Wolk's mother Lois was
especially impressed with Edmonds'
talk, adding that "it brought a tear to
mv eve."
