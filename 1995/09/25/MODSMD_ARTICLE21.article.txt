# Farm, tribal colleges enter partnership
## Stanford joins initiative to holster Native American presence in higher education 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
Building 011 its own experience,
the Stanford American Indian
Program Office will participate in
an innovative program designed
t<> help universities across the
country create new opportunities
for Native American students.
Benny Shendo, director of
Stanford's American Indian Pro
gram and the resident fellow in
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, is one of the
coordinators for the Native Amer
ican Higher Education Initiative,
a project seeking to improve rela
tion.- between trihally controlled
colleges and mainstream four
year universities.
"The initiative seeks to
strengthen the trihally controlled
colleges," he said. "It also creates
an opportunity for networking
and developing programs among
various trihally controlled col
leges and four-year institutions to
support Indian students."
The program is funded bv the
W.K. Kellogg Foundation, which
has provided a $30.000 planning

grant during the initiative's first
phase to each of 29 tribal colleges
usually two-year community
colleges located on reservations.
These tribal colleges work
closely with the National Institute
for Native Leadership in Higher
Education, whose membership
consists of .'5O to 40 mainstream
universities throughout the Unit
ed States. Each member institu
tion receives a $150,000 grant for
project development during the
initial phase of the program.
(Jrants disbursed by the Kel
logg Foundation will total $1.51
million.
The initial part of the initiative
runs 18 months and involves the
creation of "new programming
and partnerships to support stu
dents at both tribal colleges and
four-year universities," Shendo
said.
"After the first phase, we will
hopefully have at least some
vision or plan to implement on the
grand scale at tribal colleges and
four-year institutions," lie added.
" The second phase is implementa
tion. Rollout: will decide w hat thev

like and will do a major funding
initiative on that."
The official program descrip
tion published by the Kellogg
Foundation states several goals
for the new initiative, including
stronger tribal colleges, leader
ship development, improved
retention and graduation rates
for Native American students at
four-year institutions, and better
relations between tribal and four
year institutions.
Shendo said a key objective of
the initiative is the development
of programs that will help stu
dents develop skills for their
careers and communities.
"We want to develop more pro
grams that support Indian stu
dents at the undergraduate and
graduate level," he said. "Hope
fully, we can help them realize
their potential. Some can take
their knowledge and skills back to
tribally controlled colleges or
their communities.
"We would also like to use this
initiative to help Native American
students obtain more core faculty
positions at major institutions

like Stanford, he added.
Shendo said another major
concern of four-year colleges has
been the traditionally low reten
tion rate of matriculated Native
American students.
"One of the problems is that no
one really knows what the reten
tion rates for Indian students
have been,'" he said. "There's not
a lot of data available, especially
for triballv controlled colleges and
other two-year community col
leges. The numbers are so small
sometimes that we end up just
being an asterisk."
Ho added that Stanford has a
pretty good graduation percent
age for Native American students
close to 90 percen* â€” but that
other universities need help in
improving their retention rates.
Only 4 percent of all Native
American students in the United
States graduate from a four-year
institution, according to the Kel
logg Foundation's program
descript ion.
"The numbers aren't very
good," Shendo said. "We have a
long way to go in this area."
