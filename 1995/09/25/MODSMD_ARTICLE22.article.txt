# ASSU helps students find fun on the cheap
## 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
('ollege students aren't made at money, and
you usually need a lot of it to do anything fun
around here.
Thanks to a new ASSI program, however,
Stanford students may enjoy various dis
counts at surrounding locations, as well as
potential standing discounts. The effort,
known as "ASSI Group Discounts," is spear
headed by Project Manager Danny Bressler
and ASSI Financial Manager John Hall
The ASSU is negotiating special rates
which will he offered to Stanford students. "At
a school with 12,000 students, someone
should be in the business of getting our stu

dents some deals," said Hall
He added t hat t he ASSI , as a force on cam
pus, does not want to be seen as an elite group
of politicians. Rather, the organization is
there in part to "provide a bit of stress relief
for the students," and should "offer some fun
and save money, too."
The first opportunity to take advantage of
(I roup Discounts is Oct. 7 and <S Students can
save .$lO during "Stanford Day" at Great
America. The ASSU has negotiated a $17 lick
et for Stanford students which can be pur
chased from resident assistants, at the ASSI
office, or at the Cardinal Collection. Tickets
will go on sale Friday.
"If there is enough interest m the Great
America weekend, Group Discounts will be a

regular program throughout the year," Hall
said. Resident assistants will receive a calen
dar of discount events in the near future and
information will also be available through the
ASSI site on the World Wide Web, he said.
Bressler and Hall have explored other areas
and say there are many potential discounts
ahead, including airport shuttle rides during
finals week and holidays, ski packages, muse
um trips and movie passes.
"We knew there were certain areas of
interest many Stanford students have in com
mon, and those are the ones we've tried to
explore," Hall said "We feel this sort of pro
gram applies to a much broader community of
the Stanford population, including graduate
students and students with families "
