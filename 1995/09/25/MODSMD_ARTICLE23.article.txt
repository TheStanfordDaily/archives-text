# Directory weaves new threads on the Web

The Stanford Directory joins the digital
revolution tins fall with the Virtual Directory,
an on-line version of the hook, complete with
splashy graphics and useful links.
Students searching the Virtual Directory,
which is divided into nine categories, can find
everything from an on-line time schedule to
coupons from Ming's Chinese Restaurant.
"The Virtual Directory is done for students
by students — we know what kind of services
students want to get to out on the Web," said
senior Matt Gregory, project manager for the
Virtual Directory.
The Virtual Directory is currently featured
in Netscape's "What's Cool?" page a select
list chosen by Netscape administrators from
thousands of sites on the Internet. A ment ion
in "What's Cool?" usually translates to a lot of
exposure. People from Argentina to Uruguay
have visited the site in the past few days.
"I think that this project also makes Stan
ford look good around the world," Gregory
said. "The great thing about the Web is that
anyone can access it from anywhere; there's no
other student-run Web project like this one."

The Virtual Directory is not merely an on
line copy of the regular Stanford Directory. Its
categories take full advantage of the interac
tive nature of the Web. In the "Virtual Com
munity," any group can post its events on a
weekly on-line calendar. A future feature will
be an electronic bulletin board, an on-line ver
sion of the Tresidder board.
"The advantage of the Web is that it is
interactive, constantly evolving and — to be
quite honest a lot of fun," Gregory said.
(Iregory stressed that the Virtual Directory
is neither the Stanford home page nor a
replacement for the Directory. Rather, the
Virtual Directory acts as a supplement to
these resources.
"This is an exciting new medium that has
developed very fast," he said. "I do feel that
the Virtual Directory has the potential to
become a Stanford institution like the Stan
ford Directory is now."
Last spring, senior Steve Rosenbaum, pro
ject director of the Stanford Directory, con
ceived of creating an on-line directory which
would take advantage of the rapidly expanding
World Wide Web. Working with Information
Technology Systems and Services, a campus
computing group, Rosenbaum began the ini-

tial stages of planning In mid-July, Gregory
was hired as project manager.
At first, Gregory based the Virtual Directo
ry on categories taken from the Directory. For
example, one section called Campus Informa
tion contains the Stanford groups that are tra
ditionally listed in the red pages of the Direc
tory. However, the Virtual Directory has links
to organizations' home pages, thus providing
quick access to more information.
The Virtual Directory was created on a
small budget by sharing the resources of the
Stanford Directory, Gregory said.
"Luckily, we didn't have to start from
scratch," he added The computer that runs
the Virtual Directory was donated by Apple
Computer as part of its Seed Server Program.
Students can get involved with the project
through the new ASSI internship program,
which provides opportunities lbr undergradu
ates to work with ASSI businesses.
"As a new project, we are going to need a lot
of help from students," Gregory said. "The
World Wide Web is the place to be now, and I
look forward to getting a lot of students
involved in the project.''
