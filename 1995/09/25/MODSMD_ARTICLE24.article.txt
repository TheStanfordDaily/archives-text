It's not often Super Bowl cham
pionships are decided in
September. It's also not often
defensive backs in professional
football receive $35 million con
tracts. Then again, it's also not
often the mere mention of one
name will either send shudders
down the collective spines of NFL
owners or send them into an irate
fit of rage. But one man has made
all this possible — Jerry Jones.

Now "Jerrah," as friends call him, may not be

the No Cals (that's short for Northern Californians
and also in the case of Stanford, those crispy, golden,
brown furry treats across the bay) credit, however.
They accomplished their goal.
But Sports Illustrated aptly stated a few weeks

off-season free agency defections hurting both
teams, one might truly be able to debate the question
of NFL supremacy for hours and hours and days and
