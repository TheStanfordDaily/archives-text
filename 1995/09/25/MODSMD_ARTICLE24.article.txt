## D is for Dallas, Deion, Dynasty 
### 
It's not often Super Bowl cham
pionships are decided in
September. It's also not often
defensive backs in professional
football receive $35 million con
tracts. Then again, it's also not
often the mere mention of one
name will either send shudders
down the collective spines of NFL
owners or send them into an irate
fit of rage. But one man has made
all this possible — Jerry Jones.

Now "Jerrah," as friends call him, may not be
your favorite owner. God knows he's not mine, and
I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan.
Talk about your roller coaster rides. Axes Landry.
New regime finishes 1-15. A few seasons later we're
holding the Lombardi trophy... twice. Ruins all of
that by running one of the greatest coaches in foot
ball out of town. Why? Ego. Hires some ex-college
coach who's been sitting on a couch all these years
watching Keith Jackson bellow, "Whoa Nellie!"
"Anyone can coach a team with this much talent,"
Jerrah says.
Maybe, but not to the Super Bowl, as Cowboy fans
witnessed last year. The Niners, who have been play
ing catch-up to the Cowboys for most of the last

three seasons, finally caught up.
But i( wasn't through the matura
tion of players or the development of
talent as (he Cowboys did en route
to their two Super Bowls. The Nin
ers did it through cash— cold and
hard.
San Fran went out and bought a
Super Bowl, and the crown jewel
within this royal assembly of grid
iron mercenaries was none other

than that multi-nicknamed
sideshow "Neon" Deion "Prime Time" Sanders. Give
the No Cals (that's short for Northern Californians
and also in the case of Stanford, those crispy, golden,
brown furry treats across the bay) credit, however.
They accomplished their goal.
But Sports Illustrated aptly stated a few weeks
ago that Dallas is "Back with a Vengeance." With
off-season free agency defections hurting both
teams, one might truly be able to debate the question
of NFL supremacy for hours and hours and days and
days and months and months and, ultimately,
emerge without a solid conclusion.
But that parity (if you can call two teams domi-


Daniel

nating an entire league parity )
was shattered the day Deion decid
ed to do Dallas. Not only was the
cornerback position on the Cow
pokes unquestionably upgraded,
but now the Winners, which is all
they've been doing since the
Sanders fiasco, are forced to play
either a safety or an unproven sec
ond-year man at the corner. Ouch.
I had thought all of this was bla
tantly obvious. If San Fran had
signed Deion, I would have to
humbly admit that the Lombardi
Trophy would rest in enemy hands
by the time the Pro Howl had
rolled around. It appears to me,
however, that several 49er fans
around these parts are somewhat
lacking in the department of either
humility or intelligence. Or maybe
both.
K very where on this beautiful
campus, tragically located in this

god-forsaken professional sports
hell known as Northern Califor
nia, Niner fans have bumped into
me and uttered verses of nonsense
such as:
"Niners are still the best."
"We don't need Deion."
"Rice will take Deion."
"Blah. Blah. Blah."
The truth of the matter is that
the Niners are defending champs,
but they are no longer the best.
The Niners need Deion like you
and 1 need sleep — in a bad way.
And Rice and Deion will battle to a
stand-off like they usually do. Rice
will catch his passes and score his
touchdowns, and Deion will get his
picks and do his high-stepping.
Of course, these bleary-eyed
San Francisco fans have unques
tionably missed the boat as far as
the ramifications of "Operation:
Deion."
The results of the Sanders sign
ing are a moderate to large
upgrade of the Dallas defense and
a cataclysmic, apocalyptic down
grade of the Niner defense. The

issue, my near-sighted 3Com
denizens, is not Rice vs. Deion, or
Deion vs. anyone. The issue is the
Cowboy offense vs. the Deion-less
secondary and Deion taking away
a large portion of the field fort In*
S.F. offense, much like he did to
Dallas last year.
And last year's nonsense is non
sense that we shall never be sub
ject to again. Jones hat done it
again. There are people you love
like Dan Marino. There are people
you hate like William Floyd. There
are people you love to hate like
William Floyd. And then there are
those people you hate to love like
•Jerry Jones.
In fact, Jones, due to his unique
brand of ego-inflated, megaloma
niacal, manipulative genius (just
ask NFL Properties who, by the
way, will, as 1 larvard law professor
Paul Weiler predicted, lose its suit
against Jones), has always sal
firmly entrenched atop that list of
individuals you just hate to love.
However, there's a new king of
that heap, and he shares the same

surname as the second best run
ning back in the league.
Since Sanders' signing, my
very moral fiber has been torn at
the seams. Despite Jones' terrible
miscalculations of the past, he's
at least partially redeemed him
self by making the other owners
look like fools and proving that he
is not only on the cutting edge,
but as far as the NFL is con
cerned, he is the cutting edge. It's
also wonderful to see the Cow
boys and Niners engaged in this
Holy War with Jones doing his
damage via blockbuster deals
with the likes of Pepsi, Nike and
Deion, while so-called "cap god"
Carmen Policy resorts to frantic,
frustrated, pathetic name calling.
Carmen, there's no crying in
football.
Sanders, however, poses quite a
different dilemma. Up until Ins
signing with Dallas, the best thing
Deion had going for him was his
electrifying performances as a Fal
con. going toe-to-toe and holding
his own airainst another Cowbov

Nemesis and admittedly the great
est wide receiver to play the
game, Jerry Rice. After his
tenure / prison sentence with the
Falcons, Sanders understandably
jumped ship. What was not so
understandable was where he
landed. 1 pegged Deion for a Dol
phin all the way. But with his
move to the Niners, I w;is forced to
pull out all the epithets for "Pee on
the peon" Deion Sanders.
But what do 1 do now? This
inner turmoil and emotional strife
are the stuffs with which great
Russian novels are made. How can
1 accept Deion? More importantly,
how can the other Cowboys accept
Deion? 1 low can Emmitt Smith
accept Deion?
In the case of Smith, we have a
workhorse, Hall of Fame running
back who carries the ball and gets
pounded over 25 times a game,
averaging less in terms of salary
than a defensive back who hates
contact and will only play in half
the games. I just shake my head as
I'm sure Emmitt was doing when

he heard the news. "What's a guy
to do?" Emmitt and I both ask our
selves.
There's also another question I
ask myself. What could Jerry have
been thinking? To the casual
observer, things like team chem
istry and other intangibles have
been jeopardized, not to mention
the salary cap. Mad man? I think
not.
Jones took it upon himself to
bring the rings back to Dallas. He
feels responsible for not going hard
after Deion last year. And alter
showing the world how real cham
pionship teams are built, not
bought, Jones feels justified this
year in doing things the 49er way
— with money.
Still, chances are my soul, not
to mention Emmitt's as well, will
never be quite at peace about this
whole Deion thing. But I have a
feeling that Emmitt will feel a lot
better about it all when he's wear
ing his third Super Bowl ring. And
if Emmitt feels better about it,
heck, I do too.

1 accept Deion? More importantly,
how can the other Cowboys accept
Deion? 1 low can Emmitt Smith
accept Deion?
In the case of Smith, we have a
workhorse, Hall of Fame running
back who carries the ball and gets
pounded over 25 times a game,
averaging less in terms of salary
than a defensive back who hates
contact and will only play in half
the games. I just shake my head as
I'm sure Emmitt was doing when

he heard the news. "What's a guy
to do?" Emmitt and I both ask our
selves.
There's also another question I
ask myself. What could Jerry have
been thinking? To the casual
observer, things like team chem
istry and other intangibles have
been jeopardized, not to mention
the salary cap. Mad man? I think
not.
Jones took it upon himself to
bring the rings back to Dallas. He
feels responsible for not going hard
after Deion last year. And alter
showing the world how real cham
pionship teams are built, not
bought, Jones feels justified this
year in doing things the 49er way
— with money.
Still, chances are my soul, not
to mention Emmitt's as well, will
never be quite at peace about this
whole Deion thing. But I have a
feeling that Emmitt will feel a lot
better about it all when he's wear
ing his third Super Bowl ring. And
if Emmitt feels better about it,
heck, I do too.
It's not often Super Bowl cham
pionships are decided in
September. It's also not often
defensive backs in professional
football receive $35 million con
tracts. Then again, it's also not
often the mere mention of one
name will either send shudders
down the collective spines of NFL
owners or send them into an irate
fit of rage. But one man has made
all this possible — Jerry Jones.

Now "Jerrah," as friends call him, may not be
your favorite owner. God knows he's not mine, and
I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan.
Talk about your roller coaster rides. Axes Landry.
New regime finishes 1-15. A few seasons later we're
holding the Lombardi trophy... twice. Ruins all of
that by running one of the greatest coaches in foot
ball out of town. Why? Ego. Hires some ex-college
coach who's been sitting on a couch all these years
watching Keith Jackson bellow, "Whoa Nellie!"
"Anyone can coach a team with this much talent,"
Jerrah says.
Maybe, but not to the Super Bowl, as Cowboy fans
witnessed last year. The Niners, who have been play
ing catch-up to the Cowboys for most of the last

three seasons, finally caught up.
But i( wasn't through the matura
tion of players or the development of
talent as (he Cowboys did en route
to their two Super Bowls. The Nin
ers did it through cash— cold and
hard.
San Fran went out and bought a
Super Bowl, and the crown jewel
within this royal assembly of grid
iron mercenaries was none other

than that multi-nicknamed
sideshow "Neon" Deion "Prime Time" Sanders. Give
the No Cals (that's short for Northern Californians
and also in the case of Stanford, those crispy, golden,
brown furry treats across the bay) credit, however.
They accomplished their goal.
But Sports Illustrated aptly stated a few weeks
ago that Dallas is "Back with a Vengeance." With
off-season free agency defections hurting both
teams, one might truly be able to debate the question
of NFL supremacy for hours and hours and days and
days and months and months and, ultimately,
emerge without a solid conclusion.
But that parity (if you can call two teams domi-


Daniel
Kao
nating an entire league parity )
was shattered the day Deion decid
ed to do Dallas. Not only was the
cornerback position on the Cow
pokes unquestionably upgraded,
but now the Winners, which is all
they've been doing since the
Sanders fiasco, are forced to play
either a safety or an unproven sec
ond-year man at the corner. Ouch.
I had thought all of this was bla
tantly obvious. If San Fran had
signed Deion, I would have to
humbly admit that the Lombardi
Trophy would rest in enemy hands
by the time the Pro Howl had
rolled around. It appears to me,
however, that several 49er fans
around these parts are somewhat
lacking in the department of either
humility or intelligence. Or maybe
both.
K very where on this beautiful
campus, tragically located in this

god-forsaken professional sports
hell known as Northern Califor
nia, Niner fans have bumped into
me and uttered verses of nonsense
such as:
"Niners are still the best."
"We don't need Deion."
"Rice will take Deion."
"Blah. Blah. Blah."
The truth of the matter is that
the Niners are defending champs,
but they are no longer the best.
The Niners need Deion like you
and 1 need sleep — in a bad way.
And Rice and Deion will battle to a
stand-off like they usually do. Rice
will catch his passes and score his
touchdowns, and Deion will get his
picks and do his high-stepping.
Of course, these bleary-eyed
San Francisco fans have unques
tionably missed the boat as far as
the ramifications of "Operation:
Deion."
The results of the Sanders sign
ing are a moderate to large
upgrade of the Dallas defense and
a cataclysmic, apocalyptic down
grade of the Niner defense. The

issue, my near-sighted 3Com
denizens, is not Rice vs. Deion, or
Deion vs. anyone. The issue is the
Cowboy offense vs. the Deion-less
secondary and Deion taking away
a large portion of the field fort In*
S.F. offense, much like he did to
Dallas last year.
And last year's nonsense is non
sense that we shall never be sub
ject to again. Jones hat done it
again. There are people you love
like Dan Marino. There are people
you hate like William Floyd. There
are people you love to hate like
William Floyd. And then there are
those people you hate to love like
•Jerry Jones.
In fact, Jones, due to his unique
brand of ego-inflated, megaloma
niacal, manipulative genius (just
ask NFL Properties who, by the
way, will, as 1 larvard law professor
Paul Weiler predicted, lose its suit
against Jones), has always sal
firmly entrenched atop that list of
individuals you just hate to love.
However, there's a new king of
that heap, and he shares the same

surname as the second best run
ning back in the league.
Since Sanders' signing, my
very moral fiber has been torn at
the seams. Despite Jones' terrible
miscalculations of the past, he's
at least partially redeemed him
self by making the other owners
look like fools and proving that he
is not only on the cutting edge,
but as far as the NFL is con
cerned, he is the cutting edge. It's
also wonderful to see the Cow
boys and Niners engaged in this
Holy War with Jones doing his
damage via blockbuster deals
with the likes of Pepsi, Nike and
Deion, while so-called "cap god"
Carmen Policy resorts to frantic,
frustrated, pathetic name calling.
Carmen, there's no crying in
football.
Sanders, however, poses quite a
different dilemma. Up until Ins
signing with Dallas, the best thing
Deion had going for him was his
electrifying performances as a Fal
con. going toe-to-toe and holding
his own airainst another Cowbov

Nemesis and admittedly the great
est wide receiver to play the
game, Jerry Rice. After his
tenure / prison sentence with the
Falcons, Sanders understandably
jumped ship. What was not so
understandable was where he
landed. 1 pegged Deion for a Dol
phin all the way. But with his
move to the Niners, I w;is forced to
pull out all the epithets for "Pee on
the peon" Deion Sanders.
But what do 1 do now? This
inner turmoil and emotional strife
are the stuffs with which great
Russian novels are made. How can
1 accept Deion? More importantly,
how can the other Cowboys accept
Deion? 1 low can Emmitt Smith
accept Deion?
In the case of Smith, we have a
workhorse, Hall of Fame running
back who carries the ball and gets
pounded over 25 times a game,
averaging less in terms of salary
than a defensive back who hates
contact and will only play in half
the games. I just shake my head as
I'm sure Emmitt was doing when

he heard the news. "What's a guy
to do?" Emmitt and I both ask our
selves.
There's also another question I
ask myself. What could Jerry have
been thinking? To the casual
observer, things like team chem
istry and other intangibles have
been jeopardized, not to mention
the salary cap. Mad man? I think
not.
Jones took it upon himself to
bring the rings back to Dallas. He
feels responsible for not going hard
after Deion last year. And alter
showing the world how real cham
pionship teams are built, not
bought, Jones feels justified this
year in doing things the 49er way
— with money.
Still, chances are my soul, not
to mention Emmitt's as well, will
never be quite at peace about this
whole Deion thing. But I have a
feeling that Emmitt will feel a lot
better about it all when he's wear
ing his third Super Bowl ring. And
if Emmitt feels better about it,
heck, I do too.
