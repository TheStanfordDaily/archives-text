Mistakes kill and the Stanford women's soccer
team made too many of them last Saturday night on
(he road when it fell to Santa Clara 3-2.
"There's no question we didn't play as well as we
could have," said senior midfielder Dena Dev. "In
the first half, we had no rhythm."
The Broncos capitalized on two early Cardinal
mistakes to grab a 2-0 lead. Santa Clara kept pos
session of (he ball and Stanford was unable to clear
the ball decisively.
"We didn't shut them down," Dey said. "We gave
them second shots (on goal)."
Santa Clara opened the second half with another
goal to extend its lead to 3-0.
"We made a few mistakes in the first half," said
senior sweeper Jessica Fischer. "We just had to bat
tle (to come back|. We didn't give up."
The Cardinal tried to make more aggressive runs
toward the goal in an attempt to get back in the

game. Goals by
freshman forward
Kelly Adamson and
Dey highlighted
Stanford's furious
comeback.
Adamson scored
the first Cardinal
goal to start the

n 'W s

resurgence. On a free kick, Dey bent the ball past
the wall. Adamson, who was charging toward the
goal, took the pass and scored.
Stanford registered its second goal when sopho
more midfielder Rita Hermiz sent the ball into the
middle of the box. Dey, who was running into the
middle of the box from the left side, converted the
pass into a score.
The Cardinal then had a couple more opportuni
ties to tie the contest but could not capitalize.
"It's a long season," Dey said. "We've been real
izing the areas we need to step up in. Hopefully, we
can gain some momentum (before the postseason)."
