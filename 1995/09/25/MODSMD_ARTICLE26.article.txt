Maybe all it took was a wake-up call.
Alter two stunning upset losses early in
the season rocked the foundation of the
defending national champion Stanford
women's volleyball team, the oth-ranked
Cardinal managed two impressive road victo
ries against Pacific 10 Conference title con
tenders I CL\ and I SC in Los Angeles last
weekend Stanford (S 2 overall, 1-0 in the
Pac-10) bested the Bruins (6-3, (>-2) in four
games 11-15, 15-7, 15-5, 19-17 on Saturday

and swept the Trojans (2-4,0-3) on Friday 15-
10, 15-8, 15-7.
Facing a raucous Pauley Pavilion crowd
and a determined opponent in UCLA, Stan
ford's Saturday night match proved much
more difficult than Friday night's pasting of
the Trojans.
The Bruins frustrated Stanford in game
one. Plagued by the execution errors that
cost the team crucial games in its earlier
losses to Texas and Texas A&M, Stanford
repeatedly gave the Bruins opportunities
to score and eventually lost the opening
game.
From that juncture, Stanford's response
departed significantly from its performance
in previous matches. Stanford raised its level
of play to a point where the Cardinal clearly
outmatched the Bruins. Kills rained over
Bruins from every angle in game two, as
Stanford dominated throughout and won
easily. Came three unfolded in a similar
manner, as the talent that led Stanford to
the NCAA title shined through. t'CLA was

never in the game, and the Cardinal coasted
to victory.
In the opening periods of game tour, the
Bruins looked as if they would roll over and
die in the face of the Stanford onslaught
When the score reached 12-3, however,
L'CLA fought hack with tight defense and a
spirited Pauley Pavilion crowd. The come
back seemed to take its toll on Stanford, as
errors crept hack into tin* Cardinal game
First, UCLA scored four consecutive
points to cut the Cardinal lead to 12-7 After
a Stanford timeout, tlit* Cardinal came back
and won two straight points to reach match
point at 14-7. Stanford was unable to put the
Bruins away, however, as strong blocking
from UCLA's front line helped the Hruins
turn back four Cardinal match points and
score seven points in a row. For the first time
in the game, Stanford trailed, 14-15.
However, just as Stanford could not cap
italize on it.~- lead, the Bruins couldn't finish
off the Cardinal. Faced with no fewer than
eight game points against them, Stanford
held U( 'LA at bay and tied the game at 15.
More back-and-forth play followed, and
after four more unsuccessful match points
for Stanford, the score stood at 17-17.
Sophomore Debbie Lambert then gave
the Cardinal an 18-17 lead with a kill, and
suddenly Stanford again had match point.
After consecutive sideouts, a serve from
junior middle blocker Eileen Murphy proved
more than the Bruins could handle and
Stanford finally closed out the match in
game four.
On the other end of the spectrum, Friday
night's showdown with USC the team
Stanford defeated in last season's NCAA
finals â€” lacked the drama of a close match
with competitive play. Stanford thoroughly
controlled every aspect of play, never facing
a serious threat in any of the three games.
With Stanford and Washington State unde
feated in conference play, USC will have to
struggle just to make the NCAA tourna
ment.
Stanford, on the other hand, has righted
itself for the time being. Its first road sweep of
the Los Angeles schools in five years gives
Stanford the inside track to the conference
title.
