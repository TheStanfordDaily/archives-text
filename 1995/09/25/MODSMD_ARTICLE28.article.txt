## Freshmen twins lead men at Fresno St. Invitational

It's Sept. 23, 1995 in Fresno, Calif'., and the
weather is "dreadfully hot!"
While Stanford cross country head coach Vincent
Lananna described the torrid weather, his men's
cross country team blistered the race course at the
Fresno State Invitational this past Saturday en
route to a second-place finish. With the exception of
first-place finisher Fresno State, the Cardinal left all
the other teams in the dust.
Two highly recruited freshman, Brad and Brent
Hauser, were particualrly impressive. Clocking 25
minutes, 25 seconds for the 8000 meter course, the
twins finished 1-2 for the Cardinal team and placed
fifth and sixth overall.
Although it was the twins' first collegiate race,
they didn't have all that much to say. After much
coaxing, Brent graciously spared a few words.
"The race was five miles instead of three miles,"
he said.

When asked for any additional comments, the
Hauser brother nonchalantly declined. "I'm a pretty
laid-back guy," he said.
That's understandable, because Brent Hauser
lets his running do the talking. And as for the sec
ond-place finish by the men's team, Lananna said
it was part of the strategy. Lananna would defi
nitely prefer a slow start and a strong finish for his
men's team this season.
"We're never great at the beginning but that's
fine, because it's at the finish that we aim to finish
strong," he said.
This Saturday, the men will host Northern Ari
zona, UCLA, Cal and other squads at the Stanford
Cross Country Invitational.
"Look for a battle between us and last year's
NCAA fourth-place team, Northern Arizona,"
Lananna said.
Also look out for the laid-back Cardinal runner
Brent Hauser running somewhere up front with his
brother.
