For those cross country fans that missed the
Stanford women's cross country team this week
end at the Washington Invitational, don't worry
because other teams also had difficulty catching
the Cardinal— well, almost all the other teams.
The women from Washington finished ahead
of over 10 teams with a score of 50 points, fol
lowed by Stanford, which fell just four points
behind. Head coach Vin Lananna, however,
wasn't too concerned with the second-place finish.
"Toward the end of last season, our runners
were a little out of gas," said Lananna. "So this
year, we're trying a different strategy. We'll run
different people each race, and our runners will
still be fresh at season's end. "
Despite the team's second-place finish, the

Cardinal women fared one better in the individu
al standings. Freshman standout Mary Cobb from
Santa Barbara, Calif., took top honors by gallop
ing through the 5,000 meter course in 17 min
utes, 18 seconds. Following her was sophomore
Sarna Renfro in sixth place and junior Monal
Chokshi in ninth. Hounding out the top five for
the women were freshman Cara Aley and senior
Ann Sheehy.
"Though we came in second, we upset Oregon.
Overall, it was a great race for our women,"
Lananna said. "Again, the second-place finish
isn't that important because we're looking ahead
to the NCAA qualifying District-8 on Nov. 10."
This Saturday at the Stanford Golf Course, the
Cardinal women's cross country team takes on
some of the best from across the nation in the
Stanford Invitational.
