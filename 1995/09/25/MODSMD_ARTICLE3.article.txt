# 'The most exhilirating, exciting job I'll have in my whole life’

Walking around her office in
Building 10, Assistant to the Pres
ident Jean Fetter pauses beneath
a basketball hoop on the back of
the door.
"I admitted the first women's
basketball NCAA championship
team, you know," she says, going
on to recall the tournament and
the winning game.
The championship games were
in early April, "right in the height of
admissions season," she said. Then
the dean of admissions, Fetter had
agreed to fly to Tennessee to cheer
on the Stanford women if they pro
ceeded far in the tournament.
True to her word, she signed
her last letter granting a lucky stu
dent entrance to Stanford at 9
p.m. that Friday in 1990. Satur
day at 6 a.m., she was on a plane
even though head basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer, "said I

terrified the team. They felt they
had to win if I was coming," Fetter
remembered.
The team triumphed that night,
leaving Fetter, herself the captain
of her varsity basketball team at
Oxford University, with one of her
fondest memories of seven years as
Dean of Admissions. Looking back
after several years, she recalls the
time as a series of good memories.
Cheering on the Cardinal at the
basketball game was "one of the
most thrilling things I've done,"
Fetter said in a recent interview.
And being dean of admissions was
"wonderful ... It was without
doubt the most challenging job,
the most exhilarating, exciting job
I'll have in my whole life."
A popular campus personality
known as "Dean Jean," Fetter left
the dean's post in 1991. saying the
office needed new blood. She took a
year off, in theory, spending much
of it on the search committee that
eventually brought in Gerhard

Casper as University president and
writing a book that was published
last spring.
Upon his arrival, Casper recruit
ed Fetter for his assistant, the posi
tion she now holds and where she
plans to stay.
As assistant to the president, the
cheerful Fetter — originally from
Wales and a physicist by training
receives most of the reports that go
to the president. She oversees a total
of 13 administrative units and hears
reports from five other groups.
Having completed her book,
"Questions and Admissions: He
flections on 100,000 Admissions
Decisions at Stanford," Fetter
said she isn't planning to embark
on a new project. From being over
whelmed with admissions applica
tions to being overwhelmed by
the search for the president, Fet
ter's one-year sabbatical in 1991-
92 was hardly a break.
