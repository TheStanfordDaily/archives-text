# 'The most exhilirating, exciting job I'll have in my whole life’
## 'Dean Jean' writes and reflects on 20 ideal years on the Farm 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff 
Walking around her office in
Building 10, Assistant to the Pres
ident Jean Fetter pauses beneath
a basketball hoop on the back of
the door.
"I admitted the first women's
basketball NCAA championship
team, you know," she says, going
on to recall the tournament and
the winning game.
The championship games were
in early April, "right in the height of
admissions season," she said. Then
the dean of admissions, Fetter had
agreed to fly to Tennessee to cheer
on the Stanford women if they pro
ceeded far in the tournament.
True to her word, she signed
her last letter granting a lucky stu
dent entrance to Stanford at 9
p.m. that Friday in 1990. Satur
day at 6 a.m., she was on a plane
even though head basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer, "said I

terrified the team. They felt they
had to win if I was coming," Fetter
remembered.
The team triumphed that night,
leaving Fetter, herself the captain
of her varsity basketball team at
Oxford University, with one of her
fondest memories of seven years as
Dean of Admissions. Looking back
after several years, she recalls the
time as a series of good memories.
Cheering on the Cardinal at the
basketball game was "one of the
most thrilling things I've done,"
Fetter said in a recent interview.
And being dean of admissions was
"wonderful ... It was without
doubt the most challenging job,
the most exhilarating, exciting job
I'll have in my whole life."
A popular campus personality
known as "Dean Jean," Fetter left
the dean's post in 1991. saying the
office needed new blood. She took a
year off, in theory, spending much
of it on the search committee that
eventually brought in Gerhard

Casper as University president and
writing a book that was published
last spring.
Upon his arrival, Casper recruit
ed Fetter for his assistant, the posi
tion she now holds and where she
plans to stay.
As assistant to the president, the
cheerful Fetter — originally from
Wales and a physicist by training
receives most of the reports that go
to the president. She oversees a total
of 13 administrative units and hears
reports from five other groups.
Having completed her book,
"Questions and Admissions: He
flections on 100,000 Admissions
Decisions at Stanford," Fetter
said she isn't planning to embark
on a new project. From being over
whelmed with admissions applica
tions to being overwhelmed by
the search for the president, Fet
ter's one-year sabbatical in 1991-
92 was hardly a break.
The search for a new president
began with sending out 162,000 let
ters soliciting nominations. "1 per
sonally wrote 3,000 letters respond
ing to nominations," Ketter said.
"These letters generated 667
these numbers stick in your mind
667 prospective applicants."
And just as the presidential
search came unexpectedly six
weeks into Fetter's sabbatical,
plans for the book generated them
selves, too.
"It was a sheer accident," she
said. "I had given in my resigna
tion from the |admissions] job. . . .
I was still in the office, and one
day, 1 was riding my bike down
Alvarado Row.
"I was thinking about a prob
lem that was sitting on my desk. I
thought, 'Why don't I write this
down?' Then I thought, 'Why
don't 1 write this all down?' "
The result was '250 pages
explaining not how to get into
Stanford, but how the University
admissions process works.
Writing a book about admis
sions and answering the presi
dent's mail is a far cry from the
work Fetter did for her degrees,
including a dissertation on
"Sunspot Velocity Fields" for a
specialization in solar physics.
But, Fetter says, "Life is full of
the unexpected. And 1 haven't
anticipated anything yet."
As the young woman who won
tlie Hurry Prize for best all

around undergraduate during her
early years at St. Hugh's College
in Oxford University, Fetter
couldn't have pictured her coming
life at Stanford - especially the
colorful moments as a Gaieties
cast member.
"My most memorable role in
Gaieties was as Glinda the Good,"
Fetter said. "Not only did 1 have to
be dressed in this white tube out
fit with a wand and a crown, but
they wanted me to come up
through the hatch onto the stage."
The hatch in Memorial Audito
rium was a tight fit and, she said,
during every rehearsal and per
formance of the pre-Big Game
show, she worried about the dress
getting caught as she rose in a
puff of smoke.
"It's funny," Fetter said of
another Gaieties performance. "I
still remember some lines. 'What
is your name?,' I would ask.
'What are your SAT scores?' "
Fetter sees California itself as
a colorful change from the British
Isles.
"It's a glorious place to live,"
said Fetter, who often still visits
her mother in England. "You
wonder why anybody lives any
where other than California.
"Stanford for me has been an
incredibly stimulating place to
live and work," she said, still
impressed at (he beginning of her
20th year here. "Stanford is abso
lutely ideal for me. I grew up in a
country where the class system
was insidious.
"Northern California is proba
bly the most democratic, egalitar
ian place you could consider

being," she said. "Everyone has
an opportunity to ho hoard."
And while she has spent three
decades in the state, Stanford has
hoi pod open up tho rest of the
world to her, Fetter said.
"The tiling I love most is the
interaction with the students,"
she said, remembering an occa
sion when she stood waiting for a
(light from an island in the South
China Sea to Seoul, the only Cau
casian in the group. "Then this
voice cries out, 'Dean Jean!,' " she
said. It was a Korean Stanford
student waiting in the same area.
Another time, riding a train in
Budapest, a student came up and
asked Fetter to watch her bags
while she found a seat. And, she
said, every time she flies to Lon
don to visit family, a Stanford stu
dent is likely to bo just around the
corner in the airport.
"I don't think there's anywhere
m tho world where 1 don't have
contact with Stanford," she said.
Fetter will have time to test
that theory, now that she is plan
ning some personal time into her
schedule in order to visit her son,
who is helping to establish a
national park in tho Peruvian
Andes, and her daughter, who
recently gave birth to Fetter's
first grandchild.
"I don't have any dramatic pro
fessional plans yet and never
have," Fetter said. "My profes
sional career has always been
totally serendipitous.
"You never can know what's
goiiik r to happen next," she said.
"And that's what makes life excit
ing."
