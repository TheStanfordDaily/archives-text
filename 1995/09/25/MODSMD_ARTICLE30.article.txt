# Field hockey opens league play with a bang

### Alda Leu Contributing writer 
Stanford made up Cor its lackluster
non-league play by registering an impres
sive 3-0 victory over NorPac Conference
opponent Pacific on the road this past
weekend. The Cardinal ended non-confer
ence play with a mediocre 2-3-0 record
before yesterday's league win.
The thrashing of the Tigers on their
home turf represented the first step Stan
ford took in contending for the NorPac
title.
Senior Leah Jacobs called the games a
progression. "It's good that we had gone to
Michigan and played two competitive
teams and learned from our matches
against them," she said. "We are applying
that knowledge to the games we're playing

Pacific
Stanford

from now on.
Although seniors Elise Morgan, .Jen
nifer Glueck and Jacobs provide veteran
talent and direction, all of Stanford's
points and assists came from freshmen.
From the outset, Stanford dominated
Pacific, controlling the ball and keeping it
on the Tiger's end of the field. According
to head coach Sheryl Johnson, every
aspect of the Cardinal game was on during

the contest, from passing to dribbling to
shot attempts.
"We were much more aggressive,"
Sheryl said. "They played hard and they
dominated the game."
Before a game, Johnson usually tells
her team a few key ideas to keep in mind
during the contest. The game plan against
Pacific, Johnson said, was to "stay
focused, beat the opponent to the ball and
concentrate on winning the game."
The Cardinal did all of those things
against Pacific.
The first half belonged to Stanford.
With 10 minutes, 40 seconds left, fresh
man forward / midfielder Carey Cloyd
knocked in a shot in the circle off of an
assist from freshman defender / midfield
er Sarah Medeiros.
The first half yielded no Pacific shot

attempts, and during the second half, the
Tigers logged only three. Meanwhile,
Stanford attempted .'59 shots.
During the second half Pacific managed
to bring the ball down to the Stanford side
of the field more often, but could not con
vert.
The Cardinal's aggression proved con
tagious, according to Jacobs. "When vari
ous members are being aggressive, that
energy spreads," she said.
With 9:23 remaining in the second half,
freshman forward / midfielder Jordyn
Kramer was fouled at the goal line and
scored on the subsequent penalty stroke.
Kramer also nailed another shot with
one minute left to play. That shot came
from the right side in the circle and was
unassisted.
"It was a very consistent game for

everybody," Johnson said.
Next week, Stanford will play Califor
nia at Kleeburger Field in Berkeley.
Cal won the conference last year, beat
ing Stanford in the conference champi
onship game. Like Stanford, the Bears are
also making some adjustments this year,
acclimating themselves to a new head
coach.
When asked what the team will work
on, Jacobs said, "I think it's just really
cleaning things up, making sure our pass
ing is clean and in the lane because the Cal
defenders will step up more than Pacific."
Johnson's expectations for the follow
ing game are to continue with tremendous
passing. In addition, the Cardinal will
strive to "continue to dominate and con
tinue to make sure we control the pace of
the game."
