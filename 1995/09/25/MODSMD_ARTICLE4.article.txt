# Toyon fix put on hold for 2 years
## 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Students hoping to draw into
Toyon Hall next year might want to
wait renovation of the four-class
dorm, as part of the Capital Im
provement Program, has been post
poned until the summer of 1998.
Originally intended to occur
next summer, the renovation of
Toyon has been delayed t wo years
and is now scheduled to take place
after work on Lagunita Court gets
finished.
"Wepushed hard the past three
years to get Wilbur, Flo Mo and
Stern I completed |," said Housing
Facilities and Services Manager
Rodger Whitney. "These are very
large and intense projects. . . . We
wanted to get a better process
when we start in the summer."
The Capital Improvement Pro
gram (('IP) was originally a 10-
year program designed to reno
vate all the major undergraduate
and graduate residences on cam
pus. Now, in only its third year,
the program looks as if it will be
drawn out to 12 years.
An intensive program
Mechanical Engineering Assoc
Prof. Rolf T'aste, the resident fellow
in Toyon, said the CIP has taken its
toll on everybody involved.
"Between Stern and Flo Mo,

they've knocked themselves out,"
he said. "I think they realized it
was time to take a step back and
take a breather."
With work still being done on
Stern Hall and Florence Moore
Hall, Whitney said it was too much
to expect the dorm renovations to
continue going on year after year.
"There's always things we
want to do that we didn't first ex
pect," he said. "We want to do it
. land] 1 think it will help
to spread the program out more."
Whitney added that the renova
tion of Wilbur was just recently
completed and that work is still
being done to "close out" Flo Mo
and Stern.
"There are some things that
you have to let evolve to see if
they're up to standards," he said,
adding that among some of the is
sues included roof repairs, heat
system, carpet and furniture. "We
need to see if they're holding up.
These are things you can't tell
after only the first months."
In addition, the delay gives the
money in ('lP's budget a chance to
gain more interest.
"It does help their budget to
wait a year," Faste said. "I think
t hey'vegone a little over with each
renovat ion."
Whitney added that the delay
allows Housing and Dining Ser
vices t(t "borrow more money over
a longer period of time
The Wilbui renovation in IH9U
cost $8.1 million l.ast year .» Flo
Mo project cost $<> 5 million, and
this summer'.-. Stern overhaul ran
at about $ 10 1 million.
Rating club problem
Another major issue delaying
the renovations to Tovon involved
the eating clubs located just north
of the dormitory. According to
Nick Peters, manager of t he eat
ing clubs, the area which the eat
ing clubs currently occupy is slat
ed to be taken down and replaced
with academically oriented build
ings in the near future
"We all want to make the right
decision for the eating clubs,"
Peters said. "We have very close
ties to 1 Housing and Dining Ser
vices Director] Keith Guy's office
... land) the negotiations are
going very well
Peters added that the building
which now houses the eating
clubs was built in 1951 and needs
major work.
"It is just falling apart I'he
price of upkeep is getting pro
hibitively expensive," Peters said
Currently in their 101st year of
existence, the eating clubs consist
of five units, including three self
operatives, one co-operative and
the Terrace Cafe, which has been
converted to a 24-hour snack shop.
"We're looking into several
possibilities," Peters said. "II it's
going to be done our way, we're
going to have to raise some
money. . . . As a student organiza
tion, we can't start raising money
until the spring."
The options currently being
considered include: keeping the
current building, which Peters said
is "highly unlikely;" running the
food out of the Branner kitchen; or
putting the eating clubs in the

opposite parking lot of I oyon
Whitney -aid hi office ha
completed it- work .sitli I oyon
"We knew how w- were going to
do the renovation.- I'he eating
club situation, however, has not
been resolved, ho .->anl "We
derided not to move ahead with
I o\on until the eating club issue
get> decided
He added that there was "no
real wav to get that done in time
for next summer
Peters agreed that a lot more
research had to be done, but that
by the end of the spring, they
"hope to have a clear direction'
on the issue.
"We're going to take our time
making the decision, Peters said.
"Whatever we decide will have a
major impact on the rest of the
campus
The smaller projects
According to Whitney, none of
the major undergraduate dorms
are scheduled to he renovated
next summer l.agunita is set for
refurbishing in 1997, then Toy on
and Branner in the subsequent
years.
The smaller project s, however,
will still he worked on. including
the Row houses and Kscondido
Village.
According to the original
schedule, four Row houses were
supposed to he renovated per
year, but Housing and Dining
Services has decided to cut that
number down to three. La Mai son
Francaise, Kairos and the Delta
Kappa Kpsilon house are getting
their facelifts next summer. In
addition, Governor's Corner is
scheduled to be redone in year I 1
or 12 of the plan, or around the
year 2003 or 2004.
The schedule for Kscondido
Village, however, will remain the
same. "Those apartments need a
lot of work. We're not letting up
on that one, Whitney said.
The renovations to Kscondido
are set to be completed by the
year 2000 as originalk intended,
