Students hoping to draw into
Toyon Hall next year might want to
wait renovation of the four-class
dorm, as part of the Capital Im
provement Program, has been post
poned until the summer of 1998.
Originally intended to occur
next summer, the renovation of
Toyon has been delayed t wo years
and is now scheduled to take place
after work on Lagunita Court gets
finished.
"Wepushed hard the past three
years to get Wilbur, Flo Mo and
Stern I completed |," said Housing
Facilities and Services Manager
Rodger Whitney. "These are very
large and intense projects. . . . We
wanted to get a better process
when we start in the summer."
The Capital Improvement Pro
gram (('IP) was originally a 10-
year program designed to reno
vate all the major undergraduate
and graduate residences on cam
pus. Now, in only its third year,
the program looks as if it will be
drawn out to 12 years.
An intensive program
Mechanical Engineering Assoc
Prof. Rolf T'aste, the resident fellow
in Toyon, said the CIP has taken its
toll on everybody involved.
"Between Stern and Flo Mo,

they've knocked themselves out,"
he said. "I think they realized it
was time to take a step back and
take a breather."
With work still being done on
Stern Hall and Florence Moore
Hall, Whitney said it was too much
to expect the dorm renovations to
continue going on year after year.
"There's always things we
want to do that we didn't first ex
pect," he said. "We want to do it
. land] 1 think it will help
to spread the program out more."
Whitney added that the renova
tion of Wilbur was just recently
completed and that work is still
being done to "close out" Flo Mo
and Stern.
"There are some things that
you have to let evolve to see if
they're up to standards," he said,
adding that among some of the is
sues included roof repairs, heat
system, carpet and furniture. "We
need to see if they're holding up.
These are things you can't tell
after only the first months."
In addition, the delay gives the
money in ('lP's budget a chance to
gain more interest.
"It does help their budget to
wait a year," Faste said. "I think
t hey'vegone a little over with each
renovat ion."
Whitney added that the delay
