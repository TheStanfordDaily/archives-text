# In-room Ethernet hook-up fees triple

### Frank Guinan Senior staff 
(Connecting to the Information
Superhighway just got a little
more expensive this year: Resi
dent inl Computing has raised the
activation fee for an in-room Eth
ernet connection from $10 to $30.
An Ethernet connection allows
students to hook up to the main
I Diversity network, including
Axess and Folio, as well as utilize
Internet tools such as e-mail and
the World Wide Web.
According to Residential Com
puting Director Jeff Merriman,
the increased fee was needed to
subsidize tin 1 salaries of 11 new
resident computer coordinators
on campus.
"This is the main revenue
source we're going to use to pay
the new KCCs," he said.
The new RCCs will be located
throughout the University, with
three new RCC positions on the
Row, two each in Florence Moore
Hall and Lagunita, one each in

Kimball Hall, Toyon Hall and
Serra and one for both Lantana
and Castano.
"There was a huge number of
students per RCC," Merriman
said. "What we found with in
room connections is that one RCC
can only handle 100 to 150 stu
dents before going mad.... Other
universities found that to be a
good range as well."
The salary for an RCC who
lives in a residence equipped with
in-room connections is $805.62
per quarter. For RCCs in resi
dences without in-room connec
tions, the salary is $150 less.
Merriman added that in the
past, the extra $150 was subsi
dized by Networking and Commu
nication Services, who also used to
lease out the adapters for the in
room connections. This year, the
subsidy as well as the adapters are
no longer being provided.
The subsidy was originally in
tended as a "boot-strap measure,"
