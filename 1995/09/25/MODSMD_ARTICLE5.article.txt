# In-room Ethernet hook-up fees triple

### Frank Guinan Senior staff 
(Connecting to the Information
Superhighway just got a little
more expensive this year: Resi
dent inl Computing has raised the
activation fee for an in-room Eth
ernet connection from $10 to $30.
An Ethernet connection allows
students to hook up to the main
I Diversity network, including
Axess and Folio, as well as utilize
Internet tools such as e-mail and
the World Wide Web.
According to Residential Com
puting Director Jeff Merriman,
the increased fee was needed to
subsidize tin 1 salaries of 11 new
resident computer coordinators
on campus.
"This is the main revenue
source we're going to use to pay
the new KCCs," he said.
The new RCCs will be located
throughout the University, with
three new RCC positions on the
Row, two each in Florence Moore
Hall and Lagunita, one each in

Kimball Hall, Toyon Hall and
Serra and one for both Lantana
and Castano.
"There was a huge number of
students per RCC," Merriman
said. "What we found with in
room connections is that one RCC
can only handle 100 to 150 stu
dents before going mad.... Other
universities found that to be a
good range as well."
The salary for an RCC who
lives in a residence equipped with
in-room connections is $805.62
per quarter. For RCCs in resi
dences without in-room connec
tions, the salary is $150 less.
Merriman added that in the
past, the extra $150 was subsi
dized by Networking and Commu
nication Services, who also used to
lease out the adapters for the in
room connections. This year, the
subsidy as well as the adapters are
no longer being provided.
The subsidy was originally in
tended as a "boot-strap measure,"
said Sandra Senti, director of
Networking Systems. "We wen*
giving |Residential Computing] a
little bit of money to help them
get started. With the increasing
number of RCCs and the budget
pressures now, we found we could
no longer do that."
As for the Ethernet adapters,
Senti said, "There was a growing
number of people who were leas
ing the adapters. The logistics
became more of a concern . . . as
hundreds and hundreds of stu
dents got hooked up."
Merriman said the adapters
which Networking Systems used
to lease cost the University
around $200 each. Students paid
just $50 to lease the adapters and
activate their connections for the
whole year.
"We saw that the benefit for
students renting the adapters
didn't justify the cost for the
rental," he said. Before, with only
300 to 400 students, leasing the
adapters wasn't a logistical prob
lem, Merriman said. "Now with

about 1,000 students having m
room connections, we just
couldn't support that, he said
Merriman added that most com
puters these days come with either
built-in Ethernet or the option to
install an Ethernet card, which
costs around $100 Either of these
options would "benefit students
long after tlu*v leave Stanford."
The increased activation fee,
however, is likely to raise a few eye
brows among returning students.
"I think returning students
will be upset," said senior Patrick
Weston, an KCC in the east hous
es of Flo Mo. "Anytime the Uni
versity raises prices for some
thing, it annoys students."
Weston added, however, that
he thinks students will still be
getting a very good deal. "You
would have to pay $200 to $.'H)O
elsewhere for this kind of net
work support
Vuji Iligaki, an RCC in Kim
ball agreed. "For this kind of con
nection, the $30 fee is a tremen
dous deal," he said.
"Compared to other (network
ing! services, such as A( )L (Amer
ica Online) . . here, you get 100
times the performance for one
tenth the price," Iligaki added
