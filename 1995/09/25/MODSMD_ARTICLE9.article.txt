# Making it snappy
## New process eases computer registration 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
This year, Residential Com
puting is introducing a new way
for students to register for an in
rooin Internet connection by hav
ing t hem applv on t he World Wide
Web.
"We're hoping it will make
things easier," said Residential
Computing Director .Jeff Merri
man. "Its aim is to give (resident
computer coordinators! the infor
mation in a standard way.
In order to activate one's in
room connect ion, a student has to
go to Res Coinp's home page on
the Web and follow the link to the
application form.
The information students will
need to supply on the form
includes their name, e-mail
address, residence, room number
and the types of computer and
operating system thev have.
The information from the form
t hen goes to t he appropriate RCC,

who then sets up the connection.
"The standard reply is from 2-1
to .'}b hours," said senior Patrick
Weston, an R( 'C in the east hous
es of Florence Moore Hall. "Hut
they're usually a lot quicker."
According to Kimball RC'(' Yuji
Higaki, in the past, the process of
applying for the in room connec
tion involved a lot of arbitrary e
mailing. "The form now automat
ically generates and sends the
information via e-mail to the
RCC It's easier on hoth
sides."
Rather than pay Res Comp
directly when thev get the con
nection, students will have to
wait and pay the $30 activation
fee along with their winter quar
ter University bill. It is still
unclear, however, how a student
will pay t he fee if he or she applies
for the connection during the
winter or spring quarters.
