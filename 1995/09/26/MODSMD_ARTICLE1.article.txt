# Still waiting
## Other changes planned, but fast food slow at Tresidder 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
When the management of Tresidder Union's retail
services changed hands more than a year ago, Uni
versity officials said students could expect new busi
nesses, an improved appearance and a bigger, refur
bished Coffee House.
Many of these changes have yet to lie seen.
The Stanford Management Company, which as
sumed control over Tresidder's retail services last
year, is working to identify new businesses and ven
dors for Tresidder, said Jim Larimore, former acting
dean of students, adding that the next meeting over
the reorganization of Tresidder would most likely in
clude a discussion of the services and amenities of
fered
I le said the talks would likely explore possibilities
for "low-cost, late-night food options" for students,
including solicitation of fast food establishments.
But the Stanford Federal Credit Union is the only
business slated to open a Tresidder office this school
year. Students, meanwhile, have been anxiously
awaiting a Taco Bell for several years.
The Stanford Management Company has yet to
provide a concrete projection of when it expects the
fast food restaurant to open.
'"The students have voiced their opinion that they
want a Taco Bell and we're working toward it," said
Amber Bracht, administrative assistant for the Stan
ford Shopping Center with the management compa
ny. "But it's not happening as quickh as we had
planned.
Margaret Ann Kidler, a member of the 'Tresidder
Union task force, said that, among other things, the
task force discussed how to implement plans to final
ize the opening of a Taco Bell and explore the possi
bility of soliciting other fast food chains.
Bracht said t he management company would be in
a better position to make projections after meeting
with the new Dean of Students, Marc Lee Wais, who
was named to the position this summer and only re
cently arrived on campus.
While no new businesses are slated for this year,
students can still expect to see con
struction projects and office shuf
fling at Tresidder.
On Wednesday, construction on
the first-floor, main lobby
rest rooms will begin. Bathrooms
will be refurbished to accommodate
disabled students and visitors. The
$170,000 project, sponsored by the
management company, calls for
widened doorways, lowered coun
ters, resurfaced floors and new uri
nals, among other things.
In the winter, the computer sci
ence offices on the second floor will
move to the new Gates Computer
Science Building and Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Marv Kdmonds'

office will move into the computer
science department space. The
Dean of Students' office will then
take the space vacated by Edmonds.
Bracht said that while there are
no plans to expand the CoHo,
minor improvements are slated for
this fall, calling primarily for
replacement of equipment and
appliances, she said.
"There are no plans for expan
sion," she said. "It was talked
about briefly, but it was not a big
issue. The operator does not want
to expand."
Kdmonds said that the main
focus for Tresidder over the sum
mer was to "bring things up to par"
by completing various mainte
nance projects and added that,
after such projects are complete,
Tresidder would be in a better posi
tion to offer space for new services.

Larimore said summer con
struction projects were necessary
"to take care of long-term deferrec
maintenance."
The ventilation system in the
first-floor main kitchen used b)
Hon Appetit received a major over
haul with the installation of a new
fume hood. The project totalec
more than $200,000.
Second-floor cement walkways
were resealed, the main sewer line
was replaced and all public access
areas, including both first- and sec
ond-floor lobbies, received safety
glass.
Also this summer, to make waj
for the addition of the credit union
the offices of Meeting Services wen
relocated to the Birch conference
room and Bon Appetit, administra
tive and catering offices were con
soli da ted.
