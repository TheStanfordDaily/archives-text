# Perot group to form third party

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a turn
about that could dramatically reshape
thf 1996 elections, Ross Perot vowed
last night to establish a new, reform
minded political party that would
nominate a presidential candidate
and try to swing congressional races.
Perot, whose 19 percent showing in
the 1992 presidential race e-posed
the deep discontent with the two
major parties, said he had no inten
tion to run as the new party's stan
dard bearer. ' This is not about me
running for president," he said. "The
last thing I want is for this thing to be
about me" Hut he did not flatly rule
it out
He said he had no candidate in
mind and refused to offer a list of
prospect-. But when asked about
retired (Jen. Colin Powell, who is con
sidering a 1996 run as a Republican
or independent, Perot s.iid "certainly
we want people of that stature and
quality
"We are going to start the process
of creating a political party for the
independent voters,"he said. "It will
not be owned by the special inter
ests."

He said the new venture would be
named the Independence Party, or
the Reform Party in states, such as
California, where a conflict prevents
use of the Independence name.
Once the new party qualifies for
thi> ballot, hardly a certainty, Perot
said it would open its presidential
nominating process to anyone who
could get the backing of 10 percent of
the new party's members.
The organization then would
choose a presidential nominee
through a nationwide convention pro
cess. He said it was possible, but high
ly unlikely, that the party could
decide to back one of the major party
presidential candidates.
Perot said tin' new party would not
field congressional candidates, or at
least not on any widespread basis, but
would endorse candidates from the
major parties and offer them its slate
on state ballots. Phis is not unheard
of; the Conservative Party in New
York, for example, often backs Repub
lican candidates.
I he new party's agenda would mir
ror that of his United We Stand
group: dramatic campaign finance

and lobbying reforms including a gift
ban, trimming congressional and
presidential pensions, and balancing
the budget. He said he would finan
cially support the early work, but that
the venture ultimately would have to
raise its own money.
Joan Vinson, the Maryland execu
tive director of United We Stand, said
the new party could be available to "a
candidate like Colin Powell or Bill
Bradley or Ross Perot or Sam Nunn."
Not since the Republican Party
was established in 1856 has a new
party been able to push aside a major
existing party and establish itself as a
national force. Like the Whigs did
then, Perot predicted either the
Democratic or Republican party
would disappear if his effort is suc
cessful.
"I would be surprised if it doesn't
sweep across the nation," said Cali
fornia I nited We Stand executive
director Piatt Thompson, who indi
cated that Perot had been a reluctant
convert to the idea. "I think it has
been the input from the people that
has dictated it,"he said.
