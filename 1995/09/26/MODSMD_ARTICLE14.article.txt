## Editorial Safety a big concern 
### 
Students should beware and
not be naive to the presence
of crime on campus.

CAMPUS SAFETY is often
taken for granted here at
Stanford. The potential
threats to students are not as
apparent as in an urban area like
New Haven or Philadelphia,
where the inner-city backdrop is
a constant reminder to lock the
doors and avoid walking in poorh
lit areas alone at night.
Our University is fairly isolat
ed and set in an affluent subur
ban area. This creates the
impression — the false impres
sion— that the problems associ
ated with urban campuses are far
off and that there is little to
worry about here.
The reality is that our campus
faces many of the threats and
dangers found at schools like
USC or Penn. The serial rapist
that has been terrorizing Palo
Alto in past weeks seems shock
ing and anomalous because stu
dents have been lulled into a false
sense of security.
Consider the following statis
tics for Columbia University's
city campus, which is just a few
blocks away from Harlem, consid
ered to be a dangerous inner city
ghetto. In three years, between
1991 and 1993, Columbia campus
security reported rapes, 83 rob
beries, 32 aggravated assaults,
499 burglaries and — unbeliev
ably — a mere single instance of
auto theft.
Those figures may seem unin
teresting. even pedestrian, but
when compared to Stanford's
crime rates, the results are sur
prising and scary. While violent
crime here at Stanford was con
siderably lower, the University
topped Columbia with 541 bur
glaries, 2104 bicycle thefts and a
whopping 119 cars stolen for the
same period.
Stanford administrators have
attempted a variety of solutions
to address campus safety con
cerns. Among them: installing

more phones and outlining safe
travel routes where police are
likely to find people in trouble
quickly; improving the lighting
on these safe routes; providing
resident assistants with travel
route and emergency information
pamphlets to hand out to stu
dent.-. and emphasizing the need
to be vigilant day or night
through public information pro
grams.
Stanford Police and the Uni
versity- Planning Office contin
ue to make recommendations and
to push for greater improvements
in the way safety programs are
planned out and executed. We
encourage them to take swifter
action in addressing the problem
of dim — and often absent —
lighting throughout campus and
the lack of phones for use in case
of emergency.
In addition, we suggest that
the number and types of emer
gency phones installed on campus
be expanded. The map of safe
travel routes provided by the
Stanford Police shows there are
less than 30 phones available for
use in case of emergency.
Not only are more phones
needed, but they need to be clear
ly marked. Rather than using
plain pay phones, as it does now,
the I diversity should invest in
the so-called "blue phones,"
which are clearly distinguished,
mounted in easily accessible red
boxes and flash a blue siren light
to alert anyone arou nd oft rouble.
Harvard has over 118 of these
blue light emergency phones scat
tered across its campus. Adminis
trators say they are continuing to
study t heir options.
At the same time, students
should themselves be aware that
the Farm is not some pastoral
paradise. If you must walk alone,
then use the safe travel routes
and read the guidelines provided
by the Stanford Police. Unlike the
safety information at the begin
ning of an airline flight, you
should pay attention to the pam
phlets, rather than tossing them
to one side when the RAs hand it
to you. He responsible for your
own safety.
