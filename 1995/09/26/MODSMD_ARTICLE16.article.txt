## Campus should dare to debate 
### 
EVERY YEAR Stan-
Cord presents thou
sands of bright,
I young students with the
| opportunity to invest i
-1 gate new ideas, learn
'from the perspectives of
I others and sharpen their
own views in the process.
Tomorrow, many of us

will be national leaders, but today wt
aren't engaging in the type of discus
sion necessary to cultivate in us tht
examined views of refined thinkers.
In the next few months, take note, i!
you haven't already, of how reluctant
most students here are to discuss
"touchy" issues openly. In my three
years here, I have rarely witnessed an
honest, serious, student-to-student dis
cussion about affirmative action, immi
gration, welfare or any other of tlx
many pressing social issues of our day.
Yes, students do talk about thes<
issues, but at the first sign of an
impending heated argument, most stu
dents either stop talking or politely
defer to the argumentative converse! - .
"Yeah, I see what you're saying." How
many times have I heard that during
mv Stanford experience? Too many
It's awful the way we run from mean
ingful political discussion.

What's worse, it doesn't even have to
be meaningful for us to avoid it — it
just has to be political. Last year, when
I petitioned to get myself on the ASSU
ballot, half the people I approached
seemed scared to death by the word
"petition." They recoiled as though I
were offering a hot potato. They
appeared as if the CIA were towering in
helicopters above, ready to swoop down
and label them "subversive" if they
signed, forever axing their chances of
landing a Goldman, Sachs partnership.
Thus, you can imagine how fervently
many students here avoid political situ
ations that do mean something. In May
of 1994, when MEChA students began
a hunger strike in the Quad to protest
several University inequities, many
students encountering the strikers
wore a look of incomprehension, almost
embarrassment, as they witnessed the
ardent marching and chanting.
From the onlookers' faces, one
would have thought the strikers were
desecrating Memorial Church. No, the
strikers were only being political — in
an acceptable American manner 110
less. The inability of students to stom
ach actions such as those of MEChA,
however, reveals just how divested
much of this campus is from genuine,
insightful discussion of issues.

The pervasive lack of open discussion
isn't limited to the student body either.
President Casper has been consumed by
the "silent scholar" disease. In his three
years here, Mr. Casper has refused to
take a public stance on numerous issues
of importance to Stanford students, dis
missing controversial public issues by
claiming they have no direct impact on
Stanford as an academic institution.
Come on, is he that afraid of alienat
ing potential donors?
Whatever the case, Mr. Casper ought
to set a good example for us. He too
should participate in the open exchange
of ideas he encourages us to engage in.
Identity and solid logic aren't found
entirely through books. In fact, I don't
think they can ever be fully expressed
unless we examine thoroughly the views
of those around us — allowing our own
ideas to be examined as well — through
contentious discussion. So, instead of
letting the ideas you came to Stanford
with calcify, do yourself and your alma
mater a favor. Argue with someone
today. There's plenty to talk about.
Julian Castro is a senior majoring in
political science and communications.
In his spare time, he argues in front of
others as an ASSU Senator.
