# Fire House gears up for new year
## Women's Center concerned over decreased gender requirement 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Yesterday, amid the buzz of Orientation activ
ity, the first floor of Stanford's Fire 1 ruck House
did not ring with bells and whistles but with the
voices of five panelists chosen to speak about
their experiences as women in the Stanford com
munity.
The panel discussion was sponsored by the
Stanford Women's Center. Marya Howell, the
center's coordinator, explained that the discus
sion. called "Women's Perspectives of the Stan
ford Experience, was meant to alert incoming
frosh to the challenges of being a college woman
and to educate the Stanford community about
the different re-ource that the Women s ( enter
has to offer both women and men.
"We like to get in touch with the frosh as soon
as thev get on campus. Howell said. "We want to
get them into the women's community and get
them thinking about gender issues," she
explained.
The panelists- were selected to represent a
wide cross-section of the I'niversity. Among the
five were Residence Dean Lisa Webb, Anthropol
ogy Prof. Carol Delaney, Biology Prof. Sue
McConnell, senior Jennifer Silva and graduate
student Julia ('ruler
"I think the panel helped make women more
aware," said junior Kula Razek. Razek, who
spent the summer working at the Women's Cen
ter, explained that she was particularly interest
ed m what Delaney called a "fear of feminism."
"A lot of women are afraid to be labeled a fem
inist," Razek said They are afraid of being
labeled ;i> a radical or a lesbian or they think
thev are not going to get a boyfriend, she said.

The stigma of the label, however, is something
th;it Razek and Howell both said they felt was
invalid, considering the diverse community that
is represented at tin* Women's Center.
"We are open to all women and we are open to
discussion," Howell said
The center will be holding an open house Oct.
5 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. to acquaint women with
ttn> different services and groups on campus. The
Graduate Women's Network will also hold an
open house at the center on Sept. 2H from 5 p.m.
to 7 p.m. In addition, literature about women's
resources will soon be distributed.
According to Howell, an updated version of
the annual publication "A Women's Guide to
Stanford" will be distributed to all female fresh
men within the week. The guide, like the center,
provides women with a broad introduction to the
variety of concerns that they will face as women
on a college campus.
Within the manual, women can find informa
tion about the resources that the University
offers. Traditional subjects like health, sexuality
and residential life are treated along with sub
jects like spirituality, body image and depression.
Interested students can also find out details
about the different women's groups on campus
Groups like the Women's Leadership Coali
tion, the Sisters in Stanford, and the Intersoror
ity Council all hold meetings at the Women's
Center. A resource library and lounge are also
available at the center, and there is always a
staff member trained to provide counseling at
the center's contraceptive store, "Ye Olde Safer
Sex Shoppe."
"The Safer Sex Shoppe gives women a way to
protect themselves without going to Cowell."
Howell said.
