Alter repeatedly entering one of Ins resi
dent's dorm rooms naked, a Cowell Cluster
house officer was arrested early Friday morning
for indecent exposure.
Michael Kuhanks, 20, spent Friday night in
jail on charges of burglary and felony indecent
exposure, Stanford Police ('apt. Raoul Niemey
er said yesterday.
The indecent exposure charge has since been
reduced to a misdemeanor and the burglary
charge has been dropped by the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office, Niemeyer
said.
Kuhanks, house manager 111 ZAP, allegedly
walked into a room there around 4 a.m. Friday,
disturbing the two women sleeping inside.
Niemeyer said Kuhanks entered the outer
J room of a two room double but "the first young

lady was asleep and didn't hear him come in,"
Niemeyer said. He then approached the sliding
door tn the inner room, where a second woman
was .-till awake
The second woman "heard some movement
in her room. She opened her sliding door to
investigate and saw this individual standing
there,"' Niemeyer said.
At that point, the woman told police, she
wasn't sure it the man was completely naked,
although she noticed he had no shirt on.
"She was very startled," Niemeyer said, but
"he excused himself and left.
Shortly thereafter, "lx> and behold, the door
opens again and there he is. And he is stark
naked," Niemeyer said. After the naked man
again apologized and left, "the two ladies took the
phone and went into the rear part of the room
and closed the door to make some phone calls."
The women were eventually connected to
police, but Niemeyer said, just before Ins

deputies responded. Kubanks tried to enter the
room a third time.
The deputies "found the guy still there, try
ing to get in the sliding door." which t he women
had locked, Niemeyer said.
Kubanks was taken into custody at 4:20 a.m.
He posted bail and was released from jail the
next day, Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said the police and district attor
ney have yet to find a motive for Kubanks'
actions Police reported Kubanks "admitted to
drinking previous to that, but the deputies who
arrested him did not feel he was impaired,"
Niemeyer said
Kubanks told police he "heard some noises in
the hallway so he went out to investigate" and
ended up disturbing the women in their room,
Niemeyer said.
The University has not yet taken any action
on the case, said Residence Dean Pat Polhe
mus.
