The No. .'i Cardinal water polo
team (9-1 overall, 2-0 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) cele
brated the return of All-American
Jeremy Leister with a bang, win
ning the Air Force Tourney last
weekend.
Latter immediately asserted his
presence, scoring eight goals in the
tourney, including one from two
point range. I lis effort stood second
only to that of junior two-meter
man Brian Wallin, who led the
team with nine goals, including a
two-pointer.
The Cardinal capped off its title
run with a 9-H victory over eighth-

ranked Air Force team. Although
the margin of victory was three
goals, the game proved to be some
thing of a struggle. Not only did the
Cardinal have to battle the Falcons
in front of their home crowd, but it
also had to deal with the elements.
"We struggled against Air Force
a bit," said head coach Dante Detta
manti. "They are a good team, and
we were at their pool. Playing at
7000 feet, in a hot , humid, indoor
pool, is not easy when you are not
used to it. I think that at sea level
we are six goals better than them."
The Cardinal and the Falcons
played to a standstill during the
first quarter, with each team scor
ing three goals. During the second
quarter, little changed although the
Cardinal were able to mount a one
goal lead at 5-4.
Neither team's offense could
capitalize during tin 1 third period,
so the game headed into the fourth
quarter with Stanford still leading
by a point. Air Force soon negated
that slim advantage after the final
period began, however, as the Fal
cons converted a two-pointer. Sud
denly finding itself trailing, t he ( ar
dinal proceeded to turn up the
intensity and came roaring back to
life.
"That has been our bug-a-boo
this year," Dettanianti said, refer
ring to the two-point goal his team
surrendered "We have allowed too

many two-pointers and let teams
get back into games. This time we
just decided that enough was
enough."
The Cardinal squad scored four
unanswered points on goals from
Walliii, Laster, senior Daniel
Lehoczky and senior Brian Pyle.
Wall in, who now leads the Cardinal
with 27 points in just 10 games, tied
the game, and Pyle's goal gave
Stanford the lead for good.
Lehoczky's point provided the Car
dinal some breathing room, insur
ing that even a two-point attempt
by Air Force would only tie things
up. With one second left to play,
Laster iced the game by converting
a penalty shot.
'That w;is a tough game for us,"
Dettamanti said. "We were really
working hard for our opportunities,
and it seemed like nothing we did
could find the back of the net. Then
[Air Force) would throw up all
kinds of freaky shots. You just don't
expect a man to shoot when he is
pressed up against the wall. It was
so unorthodox."
The road to the tournament
final proved considerably easier
than the last game, but the Cardi
nal (lid have to face the ninth
ranked I'C-Santa Barbara. The two
teams met earlier in the season
with the Cardinal escaping narrow
ly, 8-7. This time around, however,
Dettamanti s squad wasted no time

m asserting its dominance as Stan
lord raced to a 7-0 first quarter lead.
Yet, the Cardinal were never
entirely able to put Santa Barbara
away, a.- the pesky (iauchos kept
climbing back from large deficits.
Nevertheless, the outcome was
never in any real doubt in a game
which saw nine Stanford players
score.
"With the (ugh altitude, 1 tried

to keep substituting], " Dettaman
ti said.
Despite the liberal substitution
plan by Dettamanti, the leading
scorers in the Santa Barbara game
were all starters. Wallin again led
the team with four points, while
Laster and Pvle both tallied three
points. Each of the three players
managed to score from two-point
land.

The game against the Gauchos
was the first test of any sort in the
tourney for the Cardinal, which
played UC-Davis and the Universi
ty of Redlands in its opening match
es of the tournament.
