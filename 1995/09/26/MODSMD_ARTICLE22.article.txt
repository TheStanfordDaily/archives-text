# Made in Chicago with pride
## 
### 
Hey. What up. Since you are all unwillingly
subject to my opinions (brilliant as they
are) for the next five months, I thought I
would lake this opportunity (surplus of space) to
introduce myself. My name is Courtney Mann.
I'm a 6-foot-4 sophomore (OK, I'm 5-fdot-9 hut
that doesn't rhyme with sophomore, and it doesn't

sound nearly as cool). I hail 112 rom Highland Park,
111., just north of Chicago. Here's a couple of per
sonal tenets I adhere to so you can prepare your
self for what's in store for the upcoming volume.
My life rides a roller coaster known as the
Chicago Bulls organization. One day last season, I
instigated a four-hike pile-up, received a "C" on a
CIV paper and lost my wallet. As if that weren't
enough, dining service featuml stuffed hell pef>
l>ers for dinner. Later that night, t he Bulls beat the
Knicks. Phenomenal day.
When Michael Jordan retired, 1 cried. During the
buildup before his return, I put my life on hold while
I checked the AP Wire and FSPNNet every five
minutes. When it Ixvame official, I cried once again.
A classic rock station in Chicago advertises
itself as, "Made in Chicago, with pride " I heavily
considered wearing that bumper sticker on my
butt cheeks.
