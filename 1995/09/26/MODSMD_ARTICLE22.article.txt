# Made in Chicago with pride
## 
### 
Hey. What up. Since you are all unwillingly
subject to my opinions (brilliant as they
are) for the next five months, I thought I
would lake this opportunity (surplus of space) to
introduce myself. My name is Courtney Mann.
I'm a 6-foot-4 sophomore (OK, I'm 5-fdot-9 hut
that doesn't rhyme with sophomore, and it doesn't

sound nearly as cool). I hail 112 rom Highland Park,
111., just north of Chicago. Here's a couple of per
sonal tenets I adhere to so you can prepare your
self for what's in store for the upcoming volume.
My life rides a roller coaster known as the
Chicago Bulls organization. One day last season, I
instigated a four-hike pile-up, received a "C" on a
CIV paper and lost my wallet. As if that weren't
enough, dining service featuml stuffed hell pef>
l>ers for dinner. Later that night, t he Bulls beat the
Knicks. Phenomenal day.
When Michael Jordan retired, 1 cried. During the
buildup before his return, I put my life on hold while
I checked the AP Wire and FSPNNet every five
minutes. When it Ixvame official, I cried once again.
A classic rock station in Chicago advertises
itself as, "Made in Chicago, with pride " I heavily
considered wearing that bumper sticker on my
butt cheeks.

The professional organizations
of the Green Bay Packers, the
Detroit Pistons and the New York
Knicks have no class whatsoever.
Michael Jordan is the best every
thing the NBA has ever seen the
best player, the lx\st athlete, the
best scorer, tin 4 l>esf defender. He's
so dominant that I'd even give him
l>est center as a bonus. Olajuwon
was downright impressive in the
playoffs and 100 percent deserved
all of the credit he received. But
come tlit» 1995-96 NBA season,
watch out for a Jordan who for the
first time in five years has some
thing to prove.
The world was a better place
with the Boston Garden and ('liica

go Stadium.
Deion Sanders could be the
NFL's newest prostitute, and .Jerry
Jones is definitely its biggest pimp.
I once felt sorry for Patrick
Kwing l>ecause he could never win a
championship. But Pat, you just
gotta hit those, big guy.
Dear Dennis Rodman: enough of
you already. Sit down.
What's up with Cleveland? I
mean Vinny Testaverde is your
starting quarterback, you're win
ning your first pennant since World
War 11. and everyone knows your
basketball team as that "team" Jor
dan tools all over. Wouldn 't you just
move away?
The Ivy league? Let's be honest
here. It's a cute little division and
all, hut with Stanford's academics
and dominance in NCAA athletics,
haven't we said enough?
Übiquitous is my favorite word.

It will l>e in at k'.tst 75 permit of my
columns.
What's up with this lack of cable
television? I mean for a school that
can place me on the cutting edge of
computer technology wherever 1 am
on campus, I should be able to
watch Sports Center 112 rom my room.
I'm dying here.
Five Seinfeld reruns per week is
the best thing that has happened to
me since breakfast. ("Listen, you're
going to have to brush up on your
movie quotes if you want to keep up
with me.)
Did 1 mention how good Michael
Jordan is?
I need to go to Pasadena before I
graduate, and I'm not talking about
a spring break road trip.
If you classify me as a Cubs fan. I
may have to kill you. The White Sox
may be pathetic right now, but the
bottom line is, wild card race,

realignment or whatever, flu 1 Cubs
still suck. As proof, I give you one
name: Greg Maddux. By the way,
Frank Thomas is the best hitter in
baseball.
Steve Stenstrom, Kashaan
Salaam, and llaymont 11arris - can
you say backfield of the future?
Watch out San Fran, Dallas, I see
an NFC dynasty on the Midwest's
horizon.
Brevin Knight is by far the
smoothest player in the Pac-10, and
with the top six guys returning
from last year's team, March Mad
ness may hit Ivoscoe Maples Pavil
ion as early as November.
Exactly who does William Floyd
think he is anyway? The greatest
backs in the game (Walter Payton,
Tony Dorsett, Eric Dickerson,
Barry Sanders) have always been
class acts. Makes sense though
Floyd has about ;ts much of their

class as lie has of their talent.
Oh, 1 almost forgot to let you
know that no one steps to Michael
Jordan.
For the most part, I will be dis
seminating incredibly genius infor
mation about the wide world of
sports in these columns. If you are a
gambler, take mv advice. If not, you
might want to consider starting.
After all, in my first column ever as
a naive freshman, 1 did forecast the
happenings of the NBA Finals down
to each match up. Too bad Brian
Hill didn't hire me as a coach (or a
shooting guard for that matter).
So there you are. .lust a few of
the commandments that dictate the
patterns of my life. I really must go
now. I have to begin replying to the
phenomenal amounts of fan mail
already overflowing my desk here at
the Storke Publications Building.
Oh, nice to meet you.
