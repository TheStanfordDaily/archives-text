Unfortunately for the Stanford men's soccer
team, "three times" proved anything but the
charm for the Cardinal this past weekend at the
UC-Santa Barbara Tournament. Traveling to
Santa Barbara to test the competition of the
southern Pacific coast, the Cardinal (3-4 overall)
lost games to UC-San Diego (5-1-1) by a score of
3-1 and to host UC-Santa Barbara (6-0-1), 3-0.
"We played poorly," said Stanford head coach
Colin Lindores. "Maybe this is a bad spot on the
road and we will get out of it."
Stanford started Sunday well by posting an
early goal against the Tritons. Nineteen minutes
into the firs) half, sophomore Eric Vandevelde
took a hard shot at goal from the right corner of
the penalty box. San Diego's keeper was able to
save the ball but could not hold on to it, allowing
Stanford sophomore Jeff Szekeres to score with a

solid put-back.
However, Stanford did not score for the
remainder of the contest while San Diego's
offense kicked into gear. Lefe Vittitoe came off
the bench for the Tritons and sparked San Diego
with his head rather than his feet. He scored San
Diego's first point before halftime to tie the game
on a header that squirted past junior goalkeeper
Ryan Craig. The Tritons' Stefan Martinsen

goals to be competitive. It's

assisted on the play.
San Diego continued to tally goals in the sec
ond half. Three minutes into the half, Vittitoe
struck again. He received a crossing ball from the
right side of the field from Guillermo Jara and
shot it past Craig, again striking the blow with
his head.
In the closing minutes, Levi Parker headed in
a crossing ball from the left side of the field to

register the Tritons' third
score. Vittitoe once again
asserted his presence by provid
ing the assist.
The Cardinal did not fare any
better in Friday's game against
the Gauchos. Santa Barbara
out-shot Stanford 15-6. The
score was tied ()-(> at half time
and remained notched until the
middle of the second half. Then
Santa Barbara back Steve Hen
nessy blasted a shot from 20
yards out that got past fresh
man goalkeeper Jon Bruck. Ten
minutes later, Gaucho back
Greg DePaco crossed the ball to
forward Kristian Bene, who
then fired it past Bruck. The
scoring concluded when DePaco
passed the ball by Bruck after
receiving a cross from Jeff
Job nson.
Stanford will return home this
weekend for the Reebok Cardi
nal Classic at Maloney Field
"We are hoping to get out of
this [slump] and start demon
strating some competitiveness,"
Lindores said. According to the
coach, Stanford must deal with
more than just one problem to
turn things around. "We've
given up too many goals to be
competitive," he said. "It's
going to take more than a
quick-fix applicat ion."
The Cardinal will confront
Old Dominion on Friday at
noon. On Sunday, it will tackle
east coast powerhouse Mas
sachusetts at -1 00 pin.
