Unfortunately for the Stanford men's soccer
team, "three times" proved anything but the
charm for the Cardinal this past weekend at the
UC-Santa Barbara Tournament. Traveling to
Santa Barbara to test the competition of the
southern Pacific coast, the Cardinal (3-4 overall)
lost games to UC-San Diego (5-1-1) by a score of
3-1 and to host UC-Santa Barbara (6-0-1), 3-0.
"We played poorly," said Stanford head coach
Colin Lindores. "Maybe this is a bad spot on the
road and we will get out of it."
Stanford started Sunday well by posting an
early goal against the Tritons. Nineteen minutes
into the firs) half, sophomore Eric Vandevelde
took a hard shot at goal from the right corner of
the penalty box. San Diego's keeper was able to
save the ball but could not hold on to it, allowing
Stanford sophomore Jeff Szekeres to score with a

solid put-back.
However, Stanford did not score for the
remainder of the contest while San Diego's
offense kicked into gear. Lefe Vittitoe came off
the bench for the Tritons and sparked San Diego
with his head rather than his feet. He scored San
Diego's first point before halftime to tie the game
on a header that squirted past junior goalkeeper
Ryan Craig. The Tritons' Stefan Martinsen

San Diego continued to tally goals in the sec
ond half. Three minutes into the half, Vittitoe
struck again. He received a crossing ball from the
right side of the field from Guillermo Jara and
shot it past Craig, again striking the blow with
his head.
In the closing minutes, Levi Parker headed in
a crossing ball from the left side of the field to
