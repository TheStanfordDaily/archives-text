# Women's golf positioning for power early
## 
### Courtney Mann Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's golf squad is
starting this season exactly where it left
off the last one.
After finishing last May with a
fourth-place performance at the NCAA
Championships, the Cardinal cracked
tlu* 1995-96 preseason polls at that
same No. 4 slot. Yet by returning four
solid veterans and landing an outstand
ing freshman recruit. Stanford will not
be content for too long sitting behind
No. 1 San Jose State, No. 2 Texas and
defending champion Arizona State.
The Cardinal will unveil its new line
up for 1995-96 early in October at the
University of Washington Invitational.
Later that month, Stanford will return
home for the Stanford Invitational and

then head off in early November for the
Golf World Tournament at Hilton
Head, S. C.
Despite being off-season tourna
ments, these contests figure prominent
ly into the jockeying for golf supremacy
in the upcoming season. The tourna
ment on the Farm the weekend of Oct.
20-22 features 12 of the top 15 teams in
the nation, and Hilton Head limits its
invitations to the top 12 teams in the
country.
"IThese tournaments are| signifi
cant because we're going to play
tremendous competition and we're
going to see how we sit with |the best
teams in the nation I if we improved
or stayed the same,'' said head coach
Tim Baldwin. "We're going to find out
how we stack up against the best, and
t hey're also on three tremendous golf

courses."
As indicated by Stanford's team
ranking, the Cardinal has high expecta
tions on the individual level as well. Out
of 10 preseason First Team All-Ameri
cans, the Cardinal roster boasts two in
juniors Andrea Baxter and Mhairi
McKay. Baxter finished fifth in last sea
son's NCAA Championships while
McKay came in eighth.
Vicky Strada finished further down
at 35th, yet her performances during
the off-season, which included victories
at the Pacific Northwest Amateur
Tournament and at a prospective pro
fessional's tournament, have been
everything but disappointing. Senior
Julie Bowen rounds out the veteran
portion of the tournament roster.
"Those first four . . . they are really
volatile players because they can hit the

ball so far," Baldwin said, "especially
the first three. They're the three
strongest players in college golf. Nobody
hits it farther than they do in college
golf."
Baldwin and his staff have also
brought in freshman Michelle Sperry to
help carry Stanford to the next level.
Sperry expects to make an immediate
impact as .she cracks into the starting
lineup. However, Baldwin will not nec
essarily look for Sperry to splash onto
the scene and lead the Cardinal to victo
ry.
"We're looking for her to play the
way I feel she can be an asset to the
team," Baldwin said. "She's a very
steady player, and she's a steady person.
I'm not expecting her to have super
great rounds, but I'm not expecting
her to have any had ones either.
With the second of the three

tournaments held at Stanford, the
squad will have some added incen
tive to shine.
"We all want to play well on our
course and because the field is so
strong," Baldwin said, "and you
always want to play well in front of
your friends and your parents if

they conn* out to the game. But
