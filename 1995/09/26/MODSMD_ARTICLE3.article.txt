# Grants to centers are welcome help
## Mentors, retention part of productive year 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Just as students trickled back
onto campus last fall, the admin
istrat ion announced it would
grant $200,000 to Stanford's four
ethnic centers over the next two
years.
Now, one year later, the cen
ters have found the money to be a

blessing.
The Black
Community Ser
vices Center, El
Centro Chicano,
the Asian Ameri
can Activities
Center and the
American Indian
Program Office
received $25,000

each last year, to be followed by an
equal installment this year.
The grants, announced Sept. 7,
1994, came after a series of
protests in the spring of that year
over rumored cuts in ethnic cen
ter budgets.
And after swinging to a low in
their prospects for the future,
ethnic center directors say, the
year to come looks bright as plan
ning continues and programs are
st rengt hened.
Programm ing prospers
First and foremost, directors
agreed, the grants allowed the
ethnic centers to concentrate
more on programming than fund
raising, which previously had
soaked up valuable hours.
With the grant, "we basically

had funding to keep operations
going at the Asian American Ac
tivities Center, hire a limited stu
dent staff and . . . carry out pro
grams with program funds," said
Director Kick Yuen. "We've actu
ally never had program funds as
part of our budget. This has really
been a blessing."
Although Yuen attributed his
center's past problems fitting pro
gramming into the budget to the
fact that the Asian-American cen
ter is the youngest of any at Stan
ford, El Centro Chicano Director
Frances Morales said her group
has encountered the same hurdle.
"Everyone feels it was some-

thing that was
needed," she said
of the grant
handed down bv
the provost. "In
our El Centro
budget, we don't
have much
money for pro
gramming."
Money in hand

"allows us to really sit down and
talk about the needs we have in
the community," said Benny
Shendo, director of the American
Indian Program Office.
"We have such a small budget
for programming," Shendo said.
The grant "has allowed our stu
dents to focus more on program
ming and do a better job on quali
ty, as opposed to trying to find
money and plan for it at the same
time. Having the resources cer
