# Grants to centers are welcome help
## Mentors, retention part of productive year 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Just as students trickled back
onto campus last fall, the admin
istrat ion announced it would
grant $200,000 to Stanford's four
ethnic centers over the next two
years.
Now, one year later, the cen
ters have found the money to be a

blessing.
The Black
Community Ser
vices Center, El
Centro Chicano,
the Asian Ameri
can Activities
Center and the
American Indian
Program Office
received $25,000

each last year, to be followed by an
equal installment this year.
The grants, announced Sept. 7,
1994, came after a series of
protests in the spring of that year
over rumored cuts in ethnic cen
ter budgets.
And after swinging to a low in
their prospects for the future,
ethnic center directors say, the
year to come looks bright as plan
ning continues and programs are
st rengt hened.
Programm ing prospers
First and foremost, directors
agreed, the grants allowed the
ethnic centers to concentrate
more on programming than fund
raising, which previously had
soaked up valuable hours.
With the grant, "we basically

had funding to keep operations
going at the Asian American Ac
tivities Center, hire a limited stu
dent staff and . . . carry out pro
grams with program funds," said
Director Kick Yuen. "We've actu
ally never had program funds as
part of our budget. This has really
been a blessing."
Although Yuen attributed his
center's past problems fitting pro
gramming into the budget to the
fact that the Asian-American cen
ter is the youngest of any at Stan
ford, El Centro Chicano Director
Frances Morales said her group
has encountered the same hurdle.
"Everyone feels it was some-

thing that was
needed," she said
of the grant
handed down bv
the provost. "In
our El Centro
budget, we don't
have much
money for pro
gramming."
Money in hand

"allows us to really sit down and
talk about the needs we have in
the community," said Benny
Shendo, director of the American
Indian Program Office.
"We have such a small budget
for programming," Shendo said.
The grant "has allowed our stu
dents to focus more on program
ming and do a better job on quali
ty, as opposed to trying to find
money and plan for it at the same
time. Having the resources cer

The first year
Identifying needs was the first
step taken by the ethnic centers
when they found grants in hand.
El Centre Chicano members
spent most of last year planning,
and hope to implement new pro
grams this year, while other ethnic
centers jumped right into the game
and have dramatically increased
their programming from where it
stood.
"1 >i*.st year, we used it a lot for
development purposes," Morales
said of the grant. "We spent a lot of
time trying to assess the needs of
our community.
"We had some focus groups with
sophomores and some with gradu
ate students," she said. "This year,
we will be implementing some pro
grams for graduate and undergrad
uate students."
But El Centro has not spent the
year idly.
"Last year we were able to start
tutoring for students in writing and
chemistry," Morales said. The
tutoring indirectly helps El Centro
achieve other goals for the Chi
cano, Latino community, includ
ing increasing retention rates and
encouraging students to make the
most of Stanford, she said

El Centro already offered some
tutoring, handled informally when
graduate students were in the com
munity center, but "this way it is
organized," Morales said. Graduate
students were able to receive a
stipend for their tutoring this year,
she added.
The Asian American Activities

Center was also
busy with its
grant last year,
Yuen said.
"We have two
major programs
that we're focus
ing on with the
provost's funds to
the ethnic cen
ter," Yuen said.

"The first is a program we're call
ing the Asian American Ph.D.
Forum. . The second is the Asian
American Interactive Mentoring
Program."
The forum for graduate stu
dents focuses on doctoral students
in the humanities and social sci
ences, School of Education and
(Iraduate School of Business.
"The tendency is that the num
bers of Asian-American students
are much lower in those depart
ments, as compared to other
departments around the Universi
ty," Yuen said "What we are
attempting to do is to bring togeth
er the Asian-American doctoral stu
dents . . and the Asian-American
faculty members in those depart
ments to share their research inter

ests and contribute to the develop
ment" of the students.
The first gathering of the forum
was held last spring quarter and
w;iii "very successful," Yuen said.
The second major program Yuen
has been part of focuses on under
graduate students, matching
sophomores with faculty and staff
on campus. Because Asian Ameri
cans comprise more than 20 per
cent of the undergraduate popula
tion at Stanford but less than f> per
cent of faculty, the program is
important to connect t he two, Yuen
said.
"The likelihood of any under
graduate student having an
instructor who is an Asian-Ameri
can faculty member is very slim,
actually," he said. "We match
undergraduate students with a fac
ulty or staff mentor. A relationship
is built through the course of the
year."
At the BCSC, the focus last year
was on undergraduate retention,
said new director Morris Graves,
who came to Stanford in June.
With workshops on resume
writing, study skills, library skills
and job searching, the center hopes
to help keep African-American stu
dents at Stanford.
"A major portion of the money
went to the Partners in Academic
Excellence program," Graves
added. That program teams fresh
men with doctoral students to
make the freshmen feel comfort
able from the onset, while provid

ing extra help with academics.
Other programs include the
establishment of an honor roll for
African-American students, the
Black Community Awards Pro
gram and work on the Stanford

Admit Weekend
and a graduate
admit weekend.
Some money
has gone to the
beginnings of a
resource library
Graves hopes to
establish in the
BCSC
Shendo has

used the grant to help students
active in Native American groups
on campus reach out to students
elsewhere.
"One of the programs we had
was a research symposium that
included graduates and undergrad
uates from Stanford and also Indi
an students from other Bay Area
schools.
"That was to promote graduate
school," Shendo said. For younger
students, "we did an outreach pro
gram to some of the Bay Area high
schools — basically bringing Indian
students in high school and even
junior high to Stanford for a day to
expose them to careers in various
fields."
And the students took some
timeout to form a focus group with
Native American faculty, designed
to focus on other opportunities that
mav be developed further at Stan

ford.
What's next
Going into the second install
ment of the grant, more new ethnic
center programs may lx* developed,
but much of the money will be
spent stabilizing programs from
last year, directors sajd.
"This is just the beginning,"
Yuen said.
The Asian American Interactive
Mentoring Program had 45 men
toring pairs this year, and "we hope
to grow," Yuen said. "It's really
developmental at this stage."
"We will also be working with
Asian-American faculty to host a
round table," he added. "We'll be
pulling them together just so they
have an opportunity to understand
some of the issues that face stu
dents."
For El Centro, Morales said, last
year was a planning year. "This
year, we will be implementing some
programs for graduate mid under
graduate students," she said
"For the frosh, we're developing
a program that will help students
make connections with faculty
early on in their academic years,"
she said. "The program will also
help them make the transition into
Stanford."
Chicano / Latino graduate stu
dents might see a research program
similar to that at other ethnic cen
ters. "We will have a graduate stu
dent forum that would include pre
sentations with faculty about how

to make connections, how to find
funding, how to cope with
stress. . .. There will be some other
informal events where students
will come together and share their
academic work, so students can
learn from each other."
The BCSC is developing a fel
lowship program for African-Amer
ican graduate students, hoping to
set aside $5,000 to develop criteria
and a selection process that would
award a few students $1,000 each
to support graduate research,
Graves said.
In addition to that, and a similar
program in the works for under
graduates doing research, "we
want to take some of our money
and try to identify elements that
have hindered African-American
students from accomplishing their
objectives . . . and develop some
new programs that counter some of
those things," Graves said.
The goal this year for the Amer
ican Indian Program Office is "to
build on what we created," Shendo
said. "One of the things we want to
do is find a better strategy for
recruitment of students in all grad
uate schools."
Shendo said he also hopes to use
the money to continue strengthen
ing graduate-undergraduate rela
tionships among Native Americans.
"In the past year, we've seen a
lot more interaction between our
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents," he said. "That's one of the
things we're pretty excited about."

The first year
Identifying needs was the first
step taken by the ethnic centers
when they found grants in hand.
El Centre Chicano members
spent most of last year planning,
and hope to implement new pro
grams this year, while other ethnic
centers jumped right into the game
and have dramatically increased
their programming from where it
stood.
"1 >i*.st year, we used it a lot for
development purposes," Morales
said of the grant. "We spent a lot of
time trying to assess the needs of
our community.
"We had some focus groups with
sophomores and some with gradu
ate students," she said. "This year,
we will be implementing some pro
grams for graduate and undergrad
uate students."
But El Centro has not spent the
year idly.
"Last year we were able to start
tutoring for students in writing and
chemistry," Morales said. The
tutoring indirectly helps El Centro
achieve other goals for the Chi
cano, Latino community, includ
ing increasing retention rates and
encouraging students to make the
most of Stanford, she said

El Centro already offered some
tutoring, handled informally when
graduate students were in the com
munity center, but "this way it is
organized," Morales said. Graduate
students were able to receive a
stipend for their tutoring this year,
she added.
The Asian American Activities

Center was also
busy with its
grant last year,
Yuen said.
"We have two
major programs
that we're focus
ing on with the
provost's funds to
the ethnic cen
ter," Yuen said.

"The first is a program we're call
ing the Asian American Ph.D.
Forum. . The second is the Asian
American Interactive Mentoring
Program."
The forum for graduate stu
dents focuses on doctoral students
in the humanities and social sci
ences, School of Education and
(Iraduate School of Business.
"The tendency is that the num
bers of Asian-American students
are much lower in those depart
ments, as compared to other
departments around the Universi
ty," Yuen said "What we are
attempting to do is to bring togeth
er the Asian-American doctoral stu
dents . . and the Asian-American
faculty members in those depart
ments to share their research inter

ests and contribute to the develop
ment" of the students.
The first gathering of the forum
was held last spring quarter and
w;iii "very successful," Yuen said.
The second major program Yuen
has been part of focuses on under
graduate students, matching
sophomores with faculty and staff
on campus. Because Asian Ameri
cans comprise more than 20 per
cent of the undergraduate popula
tion at Stanford but less than f> per
cent of faculty, the program is
important to connect t he two, Yuen
said.
"The likelihood of any under
graduate student having an
instructor who is an Asian-Ameri
can faculty member is very slim,
actually," he said. "We match
undergraduate students with a fac
ulty or staff mentor. A relationship
is built through the course of the
year."
At the BCSC, the focus last year
was on undergraduate retention,
said new director Morris Graves,
who came to Stanford in June.
With workshops on resume
writing, study skills, library skills
and job searching, the center hopes
to help keep African-American stu
dents at Stanford.
"A major portion of the money
went to the Partners in Academic
Excellence program," Graves
added. That program teams fresh
men with doctoral students to
make the freshmen feel comfort
able from the onset, while provid

ing extra help with academics.
Other programs include the
establishment of an honor roll for
African-American students, the
Black Community Awards Pro
gram and work on the Stanford

Admit Weekend
and a graduate
admit weekend.
Some money
has gone to the
beginnings of a
resource library
Graves hopes to
establish in the
BCSC
Shendo has

used the grant to help students
active in Native American groups
on campus reach out to students
elsewhere.
"One of the programs we had
was a research symposium that
included graduates and undergrad
uates from Stanford and also Indi
an students from other Bay Area
schools.
"That was to promote graduate
school," Shendo said. For younger
students, "we did an outreach pro
gram to some of the Bay Area high
schools — basically bringing Indian
students in high school and even
junior high to Stanford for a day to
expose them to careers in various
fields."
And the students took some
timeout to form a focus group with
Native American faculty, designed
to focus on other opportunities that
mav be developed further at Stan

ford.
What's next
Going into the second install
ment of the grant, more new ethnic
center programs may lx* developed,
but much of the money will be
spent stabilizing programs from
last year, directors sajd.
"This is just the beginning,"
Yuen said.
The Asian American Interactive
Mentoring Program had 45 men
toring pairs this year, and "we hope
to grow," Yuen said. "It's really
developmental at this stage."
"We will also be working with
Asian-American faculty to host a
round table," he added. "We'll be
pulling them together just so they
have an opportunity to understand
some of the issues that face stu
dents."
For El Centro, Morales said, last
year was a planning year. "This
year, we will be implementing some
programs for graduate mid under
graduate students," she said
"For the frosh, we're developing
a program that will help students
make connections with faculty
early on in their academic years,"
she said. "The program will also
help them make the transition into
Stanford."
Chicano / Latino graduate stu
dents might see a research program
similar to that at other ethnic cen
ters. "We will have a graduate stu
dent forum that would include pre
sentations with faculty about how

to make connections, how to find
funding, how to cope with
stress. . .. There will be some other
informal events where students
will come together and share their
academic work, so students can
learn from each other."
The BCSC is developing a fel
lowship program for African-Amer
ican graduate students, hoping to
set aside $5,000 to develop criteria
and a selection process that would
award a few students $1,000 each
to support graduate research,
Graves said.
In addition to that, and a similar
program in the works for under
graduates doing research, "we
want to take some of our money
and try to identify elements that
have hindered African-American
students from accomplishing their
objectives . . . and develop some
new programs that counter some of
those things," Graves said.
The goal this year for the Amer
ican Indian Program Office is "to
build on what we created," Shendo
said. "One of the things we want to
do is find a better strategy for
recruitment of students in all grad
uate schools."
Shendo said he also hopes to use
the money to continue strengthen
ing graduate-undergraduate rela
tionships among Native Americans.
"In the past year, we've seen a
lot more interaction between our
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents," he said. "That's one of the
things we're pretty excited about."

Just as students trickled back
onto campus last fall, the admin
istrat ion announced it would
grant $200,000 to Stanford's four
ethnic centers over the next two
years.
Now, one year later, the cen
ters have found the money to be a

blessing.
The Black
Community Ser
vices Center, El
Centro Chicano,
the Asian Ameri
can Activities
Center and the
American Indian
Program Office
received $25,000

each last year, to be followed by an
equal installment this year.
The grants, announced Sept. 7,
1994, came after a series of
protests in the spring of that year
over rumored cuts in ethnic cen
ter budgets.
And after swinging to a low in
their prospects for the future,
ethnic center directors say, the
year to come looks bright as plan
ning continues and programs are
st rengt hened.
Programm ing prospers
First and foremost, directors
agreed, the grants allowed the
ethnic centers to concentrate
more on programming than fund
raising, which previously had
soaked up valuable hours.
With the grant, "we basically

had funding to keep operations
going at the Asian American Ac
tivities Center, hire a limited stu
dent staff and . . . carry out pro
grams with program funds," said
Director Kick Yuen. "We've actu
ally never had program funds as
part of our budget. This has really
been a blessing."
Although Yuen attributed his
center's past problems fitting pro
gramming into the budget to the
fact that the Asian-American cen
ter is the youngest of any at Stan
ford, El Centro Chicano Director
Frances Morales said her group
has encountered the same hurdle.
"Everyone feels it was some-

thing that was
needed," she said
of the grant
handed down bv
the provost. "In
our El Centro
budget, we don't
have much
money for pro
gramming."
Money in hand

"allows us to really sit down and
talk about the needs we have in
the community," said Benny
Shendo, director of the American
Indian Program Office.
"We have such a small budget
for programming," Shendo said.

dents to focus more on program
