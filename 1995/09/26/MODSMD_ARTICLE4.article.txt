# Building a video bridge
## New Stanford cable Channel 51 to include discussions, lectures, art and sports 
### Carolyn Sleeth Contributing writer 
As you (li|) through the stations on
your dorm television, on one of those
rare evenings without much home
work, you click past channel 51, a sta
tion that used to be just brightly col
ored strips.
Then you realize that strip of fluo
rescent green has turned into your bi
ology professor, Donald Kennedy, giv
ing a lectlire.
Wait. This isn't STV. Why is a Stan
ford professor lecturing on television?
The answer is the new Channel 51, a
pilot station on cable reaching both
Stanford and the surroundingcommu
ii it ies.
Everything from lectures and
roundtable discussions to Pacific 10
basketball and performing arts pro
grams are included in this fall's lineup.
"We want people to know about
Stanford, to take advantage of the cam
pus. to come t<> campus events. We are
a video bridge to the community," said

Marian Adams, a consultant working
on the programming.
Channel 51 Executive Producer
Randy Bean agrees. "We will embrace
not only the broader community but
also Stanford. When deciding what to
broadcast, 1 ask myself what is the
most appealing, what will widen my
mind and broaden mv horizons, what
will teach me something that I didn't
know five minutes ago." said Bean.
"If we know a faculty member to be
a hidden treasure, a compelling speak
er, then we want to share them with
the community," Bean said.
The first round of programming will
include an original interview series, In
terchange, hosted by Douglas Foster,
director of Stanford News Service, who
will interview faculty about their re
search. This week, Foster will talk to
Psychology Prof. Claude Steele about
his research on affirmative action.
Another part of the programming
beginning this week is a series of stu
dent films. Developed by communica
tion irraduate student Etani! Invang,

the series features film projects by
graduate students in communication.
Inyang said that the selection of
films is based on both the content and
technical quality of the films. "1 think
it is really important to let the commu
nity know about the documentary film
program at Stanford," said Inyang.
"This is a gi eat way to express this tal
ent."
Programming will also include lec
tures and speakers that were previous
ly recorded on video. "Selection is lim
ited bv the quality of the recordings,"
said Director of Communications ser
vices Jan Thomson, "but we are trying
as many as we can."
One way Channel 51 will reach out
to different audiences is by broadcast
ing its programs three separate times
each day, once "from 7 to 10 in the
evening, again from 1 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. to
reach night owls, and then again the
next day from 2 to 5 in the afternoon
for senior citizens and people who work
at home." said Adams.
Bean said the decision to rerun this

programming was "very premeditat
ed."
"We want to be responsive to people
who have different hours," Bean said.
"I personally pushed for the nighttime
hours so that we could reach out to stu
dents."
"Stanford is so big . . . there is so
much going on t hat it is very difficult to
choose what to broadcast," Adams
said.
('able Co-op, required by the city of
Palo Alto to provide some educational
access stations, allocated a channel to
Stanford eight years ago and hopes to
share the resources of the University
with the community.
It took longer than expected to fol
low through with the idea but, accord
ing to Thomson, some pressure from
hot h Cable Co-op and the public to use
the station forced the University to de
cide on some programming.
Right now it takes about a week for
Channel 51 to turn around a taped
show and prepare it for airing.
"This Wednesday is tin* first day
that we will be making decisions
while we are on the air," Bean
-aid. Future plans are to broad
cast more timely programming.
For instance, a show on the histo
ry <Â»112 Big Game will air the week
of the game.
In the future, Bean said, the
station is hoping to expand its
offerings. "The taped shows that
we are doing right now art 1 not
etched in stone," Bean said. "The
idea is to stay with the taped
material and then branch out,
cover events, maybe do a live
show."
IVggy Boucher, the marketing
coordinator for Cable Co-op, said
that she is glad something is
finally happening with the sta
tion. "I hope this is something
people really enjoy, and it
becomes a resource and responsi
bility. It is a great opportunity for
Stanford to express itself."
