Like people of a certain age, Stanford's Hoover
Tower, erected 51 years ago, is undergoing a facelift.
The University has begun a renovation program
for I loover Tower "to restore t he structure to its orig
inal condition without changing its character and de
sign," said .John Maillard, head of the Rainbow Wa
terproofing and Restorat ion Co., the contractor hired
to work on the tower.
The project began Sept. (), after a six-week delay
because people wanted to visit the tower during the
summer. Since then, workers have succeeded in
cleaning much of t he tower's masonry surface.
"The entire tower has been cleaned up, with re
moval of all mildew, accumulated rust and damaged
masonry surface." Maillard said. "The deterioration
has been more prominent at the top, and there has
been concrete missing at the top of the dome for some
time."
The work, so far, has also involved the removal of
unstable masonry loosened by water penet ration and
expansion of the metal st nature while rusting.
Maillard said that his company was now in the
process of determining the exact restoration proce
dures that must be performed.
