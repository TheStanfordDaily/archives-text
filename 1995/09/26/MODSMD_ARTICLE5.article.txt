# Trashed tower

Like people of a certain age, Stanford's Hoover
Tower, erected 51 years ago, is undergoing a facelift.
The University has begun a renovation program
for I loover Tower "to restore t he structure to its orig
inal condition without changing its character and de
sign," said .John Maillard, head of the Rainbow Wa
terproofing and Restorat ion Co., the contractor hired
to work on the tower.
The project began Sept. (), after a six-week delay
because people wanted to visit the tower during the
summer. Since then, workers have succeeded in
cleaning much of t he tower's masonry surface.
"The entire tower has been cleaned up, with re
moval of all mildew, accumulated rust and damaged
masonry surface." Maillard said. "The deterioration
has been more prominent at the top, and there has
been concrete missing at the top of the dome for some
time."
The work, so far, has also involved the removal of
unstable masonry loosened by water penet ration and
expansion of the metal st nature while rusting.
Maillard said that his company was now in the
process of determining the exact restoration proce
dures that must be performed.

Scaffolding rings Hoover Tower, which is undergoing extensive cleaning for the first time in many years
"Right now, the cleaning phase
and removal of deteriorated sur
faces is about 80 percent com
plete," he said. "Naturally, when
you do this type of restoration
work, you unveil all soils of condi
t ions.
"We have to determine exactly
what repair procedures are neces
sary," he added. "We use a .'i. r )0-
foot crane to make a visual inspec
tion of the cleaned area, and we
work with the campus architect
and the project manager to come
up with some specific recommen
dations about what should be
replaced."
Which repairs will be complet
ed are determined by both the rec
ommendations and the amount of
money the University would like
to spend on the restoration, Mail

lard said.
He emphasized the importance
of paying careful attention to poten
tial problems during the visual
inspection stage, citing the fact t hat
the use of flic crane alone will cost
the I Diversity more than $60,000.
"It makes more economical
sense to do something now rather
than stalling another restoration
project later," he said.
The final stage of the restora
tion involves the actual reconstruc
tion of the masonry. The contrac
tor plans to use colored concrete to
match the original hue of the
tower. After the concrete has been
restored, a water-repellent sub
stance will be applied to the build
ing's outer surface to slow future
water damage.
Rainbow is currently aiming for
an Oct. 31 completion date. Howev
er, unforeseen repairs could come
up during the visual inspection
that would push the finish date
back, Maillard said

Maillard believes students and
faculty will definitely see a differ
ence in the tower's appearance
once the restoration is completed.
"Naturally, one thing that you
will see is that the tower will be
clean," he said. "The broken tiles
on the dome, as well as the mildew
and rust on the building surface
will be gone."
Maillard stressed the need to
maintain the original structure and
character of a restored building,
especially landmark buildings like
Hoover Tower, whose restorations
are carefully controlled by the
Department of the Interior
"We take a building that has suf
fered through earthquakes, lack of
maintenance and aging, and we put
it back in a sound state without
changing its overall aspect," he said.
"We have an old saying in our
field: If you've done a great job, no
one can seethe difference" between
the restored and the original, he
added.
