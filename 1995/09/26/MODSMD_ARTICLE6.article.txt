# No sheet
## Linen service scrambles to fill freshmen orders 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
The ASSU lias spent the last few days scrambling
to remedy the glitches in its distribution of linens
through the ASSU Linen Service.
Because the ASSU has worked with the distrib
utor, ACME Linen, for several years, the business
project's managers were unpleasantly surprised
when the shipment failed to arrive in its entirety
Friday. They contracted with the supplier 10
weeks ago and had never had any problems until
now.
"We're really kind of shocked," said ASSU Finan
cial Manager John Hall. "There's never been any
complications in the delivery of sheets or custom
items."
The majority of the missing items were custom
items, including armrest covers and Stanford embroi
dered blankets, Hall said. Most sheets arrived on
time, he added.
Concerning the distributor's attitude about its
mistake, Hall only said that the ASSU would "never
do business with them again," because, besides milk
ing the mistake, they weren't "particularly coopera
tive" about fixing it.
Yesterday, for example, the ASSU had counted on
distributing items between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., but t he
manufacturer fell through again. "The ASSU will re
cover the costs from the supplier," said Hall, "and sue
them if necessary for damages."
An apologetic letter, offering the ASSU's regrets
and a complimentary blanket, went out to all fresh
men lacking items.
"We realize beyond a simple apology we have a re
sponsibility to make good on our promise," said Hall,
who spoke just before leaving to pick up a shipment of
sheets in San Jose. "Our staff has been working non
stop to get this taken care of."
The freshmen seem to be taking the setback in
stride with a fairly relaxed attitude. John Niekrasz, a
freshman living in Soto, said that his missing items
were personally delivered by ASSI' senator Bill Shen,
who also left him with the free blanket. "He was to
tally nice about it," said Niekrasz. "God, our upper
classmen are cool."
Another linen-lacking frosh, Javier Torres, said he
thought the ASSU was handling the crisis well. "I
would "ve been mad if the ASSU hadn't delivered any
thing, but they tried," said Torres. "I got a free blan
ket. though, and I used it at Frosted Flicks, so that
was cool."
Anyone still lackingitems can pick them up Thurs
day in the Tresidder Union parking lot between 12
p.m. and 4 p.m.
Hall said that "by and large," most of the students
were served, and added that dealing with such short
comings is "one of the challenges of run ninga student
business."
