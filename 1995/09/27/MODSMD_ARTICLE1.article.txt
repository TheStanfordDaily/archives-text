# 5 engineering departments ranked No. 1
## Academic awards 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
According to a review published by the
National Research Council this fall, five of
Stanford's 43 doctoral programs have the
best academic reputation in the nation.
While some professors praised the rank
ings, others questioned the University's
commitment to the humanities in light of
the more highly ranked departments in the
School of Engineering.
The 740-page report clearly confirmed
the strength of the University's School of
Engineering. The three largest engineering
departments — mechanical engineering,
electrical engineering and computer sci
ence — were ranked first by their peers in
"scholarly quality."
With typical academic reserve, Mechan
ical Engineering Department Chair Ronald
Hanson said he was "pleased' with the re
sults, which he said would add to the Uni
versity's appeal.
"There's something about Stanford," he
said. "We kind of feel like if we have a stu

dent come out here, we've got a really good
chance" of enrolling that student.
The University also tied for first with
the University of Chicago in the field of
ecology, evolution and behavior and took
first m psychology.
Marvin Goldberger, dean of natural sci
ences at CC San Diego and co-chair of the
National Research Council committee that
produced the report, cautioned against
reading too much into it.
"Everybody wants to find a way of look
ing at the data that makes (their institu
tion! look good," he said. The report,
though, was intended more as a reference
tool to he placed alongside the council's last
report, published in 1982. Among the vari
ables considered by t he council are the per
centage of women in each program, as well
as the median number of years to gradua
tion.
Rankings are based solely on a survey of
about 100 professors per discipline, who
rated programs on the quality of their fac-
ulty and their effectiveness in pro
ducing qualified professors.
Knglish Prof. Marjorio Perloff,
the depart ment's director of gradu
ate studies, agreed that the rank
ings should he taken with a grain of
.salt, but argued that they could
also fx- seen as a wake-up call, at
least in Stanford's case.
"Stanford needs to devote more
of its budget to tin- humani
ties," she said.
The conventional wisdom that
Stanford's main competitors in the
humanities are Ivy League schools
does not hold up, she said.
"I think we're getting to be like
('altcch and MIT," she said.
Duke's rise from 28th in the
19H2 rankings to fifth this year
shows that "star material" can
make a difference, she said, mean
ing more senior positions should

be added instead of the junior posi
tions that have been added in
recent years.
Computer Science Department
Chair John Hennessy admitted
that his field was "moving very
fast" which makes it easier to make
a reputation.
Hanson, on the other hand,
attributed his department's suc
cess to an emphasis on basic
research. Because the University's
graduate program in mechanical
engineering is about five times (jig
ger than its undergraduate pro
gram, professors can devote more
time to research, he said. That
means professors can publish more
often and receive more attention
from colleagues.
Overall, 32 of the University's
doctoral programs were ranked
in the top 10, giving it second
place behind I'C Berkeley,
which placed 35 of its 3b entries
in the top 10, and ahead of Har
vard, which had 2H top-10 pro
grams.
