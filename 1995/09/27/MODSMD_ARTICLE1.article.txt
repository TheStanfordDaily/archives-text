## Academic awards

According to a review published by the
National Research Council this fall, five of
Stanford's 43 doctoral programs have the
best academic reputation in the nation.
While some professors praised the rank
ings, others questioned the University's
commitment to the humanities in light of
the more highly ranked departments in the
School of Engineering.
The 740-page report clearly confirmed
the strength of the University's School of
Engineering. The three largest engineering
departments — mechanical engineering,
electrical engineering and computer sci
ence — were ranked first by their peers in
"scholarly quality."
With typical academic reserve, Mechan
ical Engineering Department Chair Ronald
Hanson said he was "pleased' with the re
sults, which he said would add to the Uni
versity's appeal.
"There's something about Stanford," he
said. "We kind of feel like if we have a stu

dent come out here, we've got a really good
chance" of enrolling that student.
The University also tied for first with
the University of Chicago in the field of
ecology, evolution and behavior and took
first m psychology.
Marvin Goldberger, dean of natural sci
ences at CC San Diego and co-chair of the
National Research Council committee that
produced the report, cautioned against
reading too much into it.
"Everybody wants to find a way of look
ing at the data that makes (their institu
tion! look good," he said. The report,
though, was intended more as a reference
tool to he placed alongside the council's last
report, published in 1982. Among the vari
ables considered by t he council are the per
centage of women in each program, as well
as the median number of years to gradua
tion.
Rankings are based solely on a survey of
about 100 professors per discipline, who
rated programs on the quality of their fac-
