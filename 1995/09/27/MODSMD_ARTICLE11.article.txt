Clark closes Simpson case
LOS ANGELES < AI *) — A furious Judge
Lance I to blacked out TV coverage of the O.J.
Simpson trial for an hour yesterday, then
reopened the camera's eye as a prosecutor
assembled a picture puz/le for jurors showing
Simpson as a killer.
Prosecutor Marcia Clark, delivering a closing
argument that built in power throughout the
day, disavowed her own police witness as a racist,
ridiculed a defense contamination-conspiracy
theory as "far-fetched" and said blood evidence
marks Simpson as a murderer.
"At the conclusion of all of our arguments,"
she said, "when you open up the windows and let
the cool aii" blow out the smokescreen t hat's been
created by the defense, with the cool wind of rea
son, you will see that the defendant has been
proven guilty, easily, beyond ii reasonable

doubt.
Clark was the first lawyer to address jurors in
the climactic summations, which began one year
to the day since prospective jurors first reported
to the courthouse.
