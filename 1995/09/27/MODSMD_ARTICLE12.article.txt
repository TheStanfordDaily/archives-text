# Bosnian factions plan elections

NEW YORK (AP) - Prodded by
the United States, Bosnia's warring
factions agreed yesterday to guide
lines for elections and a future gov
ernment for their ethnically torn
country, but remained far apart on
how to st<ip the fighting.
All sides hailed the agreement as
a step toward peace, but their vary
ing interpretations of what it
meant highlighted tin* arduous
work that lay ahead in ending tin* 3
1/2-year-old war.
"There is no guarantee of suc
cess, but today's agreement moves
us closer to the ultimate goal of a
genuine peace," President Clinton
said.
The Bosnian Serbs, who want to
eventually unite their land with
neighboring Serbia, had opposed a
strong central government. The
Muslims, who hope t< > keep Bosnia

intact, wanted to make it as power
ful as possible.
The negotiations were the first
since a U.S.-brokered agreement
was clinched in Geneva on Sept. 8.
That agreement proposed keeping
Bosnia's external borders intact
while dividing the state roughly SO
SO between Serbs and the Muslim-
Croat federation.
The government of Bosnia will
consist of a parliament, a collective
presidency and a judicial system.
Two-thirds of parliament would
be elected from the territory con
trolled by the Muslim-Croat federa
tion, the other third from Bosnian
Serb lands. Parliamentary action
will bo by majority vote, provided
that includes at least one-third of
the votes on each side.
Left undecided was how many
people would make up the collective

presidency. As in the the case of the
parliament, two-thirds would be
elected from the Croat-Muslim fed
eration and the remainder from
Serb territory.
The power-sharing formula is
enormously complex. Presidential
decisions would be taken by majori
ty vote, but if one-third of the group
disagrees with a decision and
declares it to be "destructive of a
vital interest" it would be referred
to that entity's parliament. If two
thirds of the members of that enti
ty's parliament voted against the
action, it would not take effect.
The agreement also obligates
both sides to support freedom of
movement and the right of refugees
to return or receive just compensa
tion for their homes, as well as to
allow free speech and protect
human rights.
