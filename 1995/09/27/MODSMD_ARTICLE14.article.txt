## The
						Grape Policy 
### 
Implementation of the
Grape Policy may be
harder than it seems

Thought skttlkd for
good. the grape policy contro
versy has resurfaced This
time, however, the question is not
one of" moral obligation but of prac
tieal implementation.
Last year's policy decision — the
result of a year s work by a Grape
Policy Committee formed in the
wake of a May 1994 hunger strike
dealt mainly with the question
of whether Stanford, as an organi
zation, had an obligation to make a
political stand by boycotting grapes
in response to the treatment of the
workers who harvest them.
Though University President
Gerhard Casper denied the boycott
to administrative units, he sup
ported the right of individual resi
dences to vote on the boycott, call
ing them "local communities that
engage in a measure of self-gover
nance "
Nobody apparently seems to
have thought much about the
added burden that this implemen
tation will place on those local com
ma nit ies.
The responsibility of implemen
tation has fallen on the shoulders
of the resident assistants, who are
asked to administer dorm-based
educational sessions on the treat
ment of workers harvesting Cali
fornia table grapes and a subse
quent vote in each dining hall to
determine whether grapes will be
served.
Many RAs, however, have
already expressed concern over the
plan, which they see as cumber
some and indirect. More impor
tantly, they feel a vote on such a
sensitive issue so early in the year
will cause unnecessary rifts at a
time when residences are trying
their hardest to build communities.
There is no question that contro
versial issues deserve discussion at
Stanford. We are here to learn,
both academically and from each
other, and serious debate is an
important part of every education.

But debate over this issue could
prove particularly dangerous at a
time when residences are trying
their hardest to become cohesive.
This is not a run-of-the-mill, theo
retical debate over nuclear arms or
war in Bosnia. The decision each
dorm makes will visibly affect it for
t he rest of t he year.
For some people, this is a very
sensitive topic. If the residence
decides against these people, sub
jecting their feelings to majority
rule, they could feel stabbed in the
back by the housemates whom they
have to live with for the next eight
months. That is not the kind of
community that Stanford's world
famous Residential Education
should try to build.
In addition, there is the added
question of shared dining halls.
Most residences — including those
in Wilbur, Stern, Florence Moore,
Lagunita and Governor's Corner —
eat with members of other houses.
The plan for those dining halls is to
have the houses in each complex
come together to vote on whether
the dining hall serves grapes or not.
But that means that Casper's
"local communities" will not be
making their own decisions. Any
one who has ever lived in one of the
places listed above can tell you that
individual houses rarely mix with
others in the same complex. Arroyo
and Cedro share a dining hall, but
they are two completely separate
communities. A decision made bv
members of a complex who don't
know each other is not a local com
munity decision.
On the whole, asking RAs to
implement this plan through a
forced group decision is more trou
ble than it's worth. There is nothing
wrqng with asking them to pass out
informational literature and hold
educational sessions. But the actual
decision should be left as an individ
ual choice, with the responsibility
for more education falling on the
shoulders of those who care enough
about this issue to defend it.
Moral arguments aside, econom
ically, it will make no sense for Food
Service to serve food that no one
will eat. If enough people choose
individually not to eat grapes, the
message will get across.
