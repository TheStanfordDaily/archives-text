# Campus viewpoint
## Gerhard Casper Seven reasons you should be at Stanford 
### 
I ATTEMPTED TO
answer that question
last Friday as we wel
comed our newest under
graduate's the ('lass of
1999 and transfer stu
dents. Today, I welcome
back you veteran Farm
hands, and wish to share

with you the seven answers I offered your
newest colleagues.
First and foremost, you should be hen
because Stanford is one of the best univer
sities in the world. This university is dedi
cated to the pursuit of many excellences
Teaching, learning and research do not
benefit from stagnant air but from fresl
winds blowing, from interaction wit I
many different people who are at the Iron
tiers of various fields of research. No, not
everybody at Stanford is foremost a teach
er; yes, a number of classes are taught b\
teaching assistants (in whose training w<
invest great care); yes, this is a very com
plex institut ion serving society in different
ways. However, those of you who seize tin
initiative and seek out the incredible rang*
of opportunities that Stanford has to offer
you across the entire spectrum of a very
comprehensive university, and then make
choices, will be rewarded in ways that an
not easily matched anywhere.
Second, you should be at Stanford
because there continues here what one
might call a "Western" spirit of pioneering
entrepreneur-ship, energy. It is the spirit o!
developing an idea and then running wit I
it. While ivy can l>e found on campus, it i.-
not the dominant plant. As Wallace Stegn
er, the great writer, said in his Founders
I )ay speech during the University's centen

nial year, 1991: "|l|t was not a new dream
that the Stan fords tapped into. What made
their enterprise special was its ambitious
scale, its radical format, its non-denomina
tional and coeducational character and
above all its location |in California]."
Third, you should be at Stanford
because of the diversity it contains as
expressed by any measure capturing the
type of academic achievements and inter
ests, artistic and athletic accomplish
ments, ethnic and social backgrounds. We
value and seek this diversity, both to be
faithful to our task to educate leaders for a
diverse and complex society — a society
that will, we hope, overcome undue ten
dencies toward stratification — and to pro
vide a rich and challenging environment in
which our students learn much from one
anot her Very few among you have gradu
ated from a high school or lived in a com
munity with such diversity. As you cross
bridges to meet strangers at Stanford, the
going will sometimes be rough. That, how
ever, is part of the excitement that Stan
ford offers you.
Fourth, you should be at Stanford
because of the opportunities it affords for
service to the public. Members of a univer
sity community, whatever their views,
must not shy away from the social and
political issues of their time, from citizen
s-hip, from engaging in service to the public
service in the many forms such service
can take Stanford is very supportive of
those endeavors that are made most effec
t ive b\ applying t he same critical reasoning
to public service that is otherwise prized at
the University.
Fifth, you should be at Stanford
because the institution believes in the

Roman adage "a sound mind in a sound
body." The pursuit of many excellences at
Stanford includes athletics. Athletics play
a large role in the lives of many Stanford
students; activities range from involve
ment in one of the 33 Division 1 varsity
sports to participation in intramural sports
to hiking in the foothills. As a philosopher
once wrote, "A healthy beggar is happier
than an ailing king."
Sixth, you should be at Stanford
because of its global reach and its location
on the Pacific Rim. Stanford's president
even speaks with an accent (or so people
allege). Our eight overseas campuses, of
which 1 greatly hope you will avail your
selves, stretch from Europe to Latin Amer
ica to Asia. The philosopher William
James, at Founders' Day in 1906, prophet
ically thought of Stanford "in a century" as
"devoted to truth, radiating influence, set
ting standards." He stressed then Stan
lord's potential for helping people in Amer
ica ajid Asia understand one another bet
ter. Stanford, over the last century, has
certainly mediated between America and
Asia, though, to be sure, never restricted
itself to these two continents.
Seventh, you should be at Stanford
because of the setting we are in at this par
ticular moment: the yellow sandstone
arches and cloisters, the "red tile roofs
against the azure sky."
Why should you be at Stanford?
Because these attributes interact with mid
reinforce one another, compounding their
value and, together with you, making
Stanford truly incomparable.

Gerhard Casper is the president of the Uni
uersity.
