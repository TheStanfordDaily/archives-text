Student disgruntled with University services and prices

TIIK NEW YEAR begins. Now rules
and regulations make their way
through the bureaucracy. Having
been here for (our years 1 have seen and
felt many changes. Hut there are some
eternal truths: 1) the tuition fee increase
will always beat the inflation, and 2) the
student stipend increase will never beat
the inflation.
Dors this mean that the Stanford stu
dents are too smart to be affected by the
inflationary tendencies of the economy?

Student Communication Services is
the best thing that could have happened
to students. It is a shield that protects us
from money hounds like AT&T and
MCI. A call to India through Communi
cations Services costs $1.02 / minute
while AT&T currently charges
$0.73 / minute. Does one need a Ph.D. in
math to say that Communications Ser
vices offers a better deal?
If you live in EV you can't have more
than five happy visitors. II you expect

unannounced visitors, just pray that
they budget $25 for a parking ticket they
are likely to get.
The housing office brings in new
rules, complicates and tightens old ones
on an annual basis. Soon the instruction
booklet will be bigger than Encyclopedia
Britannica. If you can't read and digest
the information, you don't deserve to be
at Stanford.
Printer's Inc. gives a 20 percent dis
count to Stanford students. The Stan-

Cord Bookstore does not indulge in such
dirty tricks to attract customers. You
can have the privilege of paying the full
amount to this non-profit, philanthropic
organization.
1 {ere are some easy ways for Stanford
to earn much needed money: 1) coin
operated water-fountains and
restrooms, and 2) a permit to park bicy
cles.
