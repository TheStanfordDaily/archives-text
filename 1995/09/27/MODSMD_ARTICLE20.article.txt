They'll probably do it too.
— The Management
Indulge me a moment to play the
sage. Allow me, dear frosh, trusting
transfer, to spurt wisdom gained pre
sumably by experience.
Which I do have some of. I have, after
all, been here for 12 quarters — most of
them registered.
I've been Once Around The Quad.
I've begged Shiela at the Bursar's Office
not to make me pay the penalty fees on
mv bill more than thrice, and both Dean
the Bookstore lady and Denny's dear
Ova know me by name. Yes, it's fair to
sav I know one or two things about this

lovely institution and its sundry social
revelries.
Veritably venerable for having been
around too long. That's me.
So please, let me hork just one more
clam onto that pile o' wisdom-pearls
you've collected, I'm sure, in the past
few weeks. Because this might actually
be of some help.
Here goes:
While you're scooping and schmooz
ing and clinging to your hallmates, hud
dling together like Cheerios for sur
vival; while you're indiscriminately
choosing others from the lost crowd to
share your college time with, don't
make friends with upperclassmen.
Leave the old farts be.
Don't bond with sophomores, don't
drink with juniors, don't sleep with
seniors. Don't make connections with
anyone who doesn't still have their tas
sel dangling from their rear-view mirror
and a Polaroid of their soon-to-be ex
hometown-honey bluetaped to their
bookshelf of CIV books.
It's just not worth it. Because we pick
up and leave. It's true — we're not
dependable. We'll be gone before you
even declare Econ.

When it comes down to the yucky
pragmatics of social function, upper
classmen are only good for teaching you
how to footnote and buying your
Safeway suitcases of Hud Lite. And not
to mention they'll prematurely shatter
your cushy undergraduate future
schema with constant reminders of the
fruitlessness and frust ration of the job
search. (Quick question: Why do people
say "not to mention" right before
they're going to mention something?
It's a dumb expression. Let's all
promise to stop using it, okay?)
I know it's not in line with the pert
pro-socialisms RA training wanted so
badly for me to internalize, but I have to
admit it age-ism is an effective social
tactic — especially if you have any
intention of having any drawmates left
come junior year.
The status of hangin' with the older
crowd just doesn't retain much water
when held against all you'll eventually
lose.
Yes, dear Hranner ian, sweet
SLEuphile, there are definitely better
people for you to hang with and talk to
while you're here lofting your brows
from mid to high.

So what if no one ever really leaves
after they graduate? So what if the a
older farts always find some way, some
excuse to stick around campus for at
least another year — coterms, double
majors, local jobs, full-time tour guiding
or just crashing on couches — so what?
They'll only embarrass you and make
you feel old when, some three short
years from now, you'll be trying to
recapture frivolous youth by making
friends with the frosh in your dorm.
Take me for example: You couldn't
find a less encouraging soul for a frosh
to befriend. I'm the worst of the kind, a
fifth-year senior. Not even responsible
enough to have applied to grad school
or gotten a job or even graduated on
time. 'Just a double major and an hon
ors thesis and a complex about the
whole thing. 1 go to parties off-campus
. . . . I have friends in med school ... 1
could recommend three local bars that
have Dry Blackthorn on tap . . . .when
there's an Ox ford reu n i on, I' in
there. . .
You don't want to be my friend. You
don't want to know what I know. You
want a heaping teaspoon lull of that
blissful stuff someone once called igno

ranee. At least for a little while.
Because, dear frosh, innocent incom
ing, it all blows by. It really does. Like a
nervous 15-year-old gettin' his first
slice of booty, college shoots its wad
before you can count to 10. Pretty soon
you'll find yourself going to senior pub
nights and heading to the Bookstore to
try on a cap and gown. And you'll prob
ably stop and say hi to Dean while
you're there.
So stick with your own kind. They're
like you: wide-eyed and eager and as
dumb as feet. Perky types. And they'll
be with you the whole way through.
And if you still can't get that footnote
tiling down right and Command -E is
too difficult for you, ask a professor.
Preferably one with tenure.
