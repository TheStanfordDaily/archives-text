### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
The Daily Californian, UC-Berkeley's stu
dent-run newspaper, has added another voice
to the raging debate over affirmative action
with its recent editorial in favor of the UC
Regents' decision this summer to abandon
affirmative action policies in admissions and
hiring.
"Race-based affirmative action needed to
end because it is racist. In its place, we recom
mend policies of socio-economic affirmative
action and outreach programs," the editorial
states.
According to Daily Californian Opinions
Editor Matt Belloni, editorials reflect the
majority opinion of a l()-member editorial
board. One member writes the editorial, and
the entire board adds comments and revi
sions. The vote on the affirmative action edi
torial was six to four.
"I feel that the current affirmative action
policies are outdated in terms of judging stu

dent needs," Belloni said. "However, the Daily
Cal is in support of preserving diversity,
through alternative programs."
Student reaction to the editorial has been
mixed
I'm not happy with their decision," said
Felicia Sze, executive vice president of the
Associated Students of University of Califor
nia. "I've spoken to a lot of students who feel
that the Daily Cal was not in line with the
majority of how students really feel
"I know a lot of people who dismissed their
endorsement," Sze said. "They've had a lower
readership in the past few years."
Belloni said, however, that the Daily Cali
fornian doesn't intend to speak for everyone.
"Berkeley is so diverse that there's no way
we could," Belloni said. "The Daily Cal
received a lot of mail, both positive and nega
tive 1 believe that more students are in favor
of the Regents' decision than administrators
believe."
Sze, on the other hand, said, "faculty and
staff members are in lull support of affirma*

tive action. Now the only questionable issue is
student action."
S/.e said the ASUC will vote today on two
bills dealing with the affirmative action issue
and predicted that the ASUC will vote against
the Regents' decision and in agreement with
the faculty and Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien,
who both support affirmative action.
"On Oct. 12, students are planning a walk
out," Sze said. "As students, we must try to
influence the Regents' decision."
Belloni voiced some doubts about the ulti
mate effectiveness of the student protest.
"The rallies that go on every day are like a
car alarm: You don't pay much attention to
them," Belloni said, adding that his views did
not necessarily represent those of The Daily
Californian "If you hear one once, maybe
you'll listen, but i' ou hear them everyday,
then no one pays ;â–  ention to them."
"This i. a different student body than from
the past.'' lie added "There is no mass mili
tancy. People are more concerned with other
things."
