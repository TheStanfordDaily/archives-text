## Newly tested anti-HIV drug looks promising Study shows increase in potency without toxicity 
### Alison Davis 
The war against AIDS may have a
new army of allies — drugs called pro
tease inhibitors. Saquinavir is one
member of this new class of anti-HIV
drugs currently undergoing clinical
testing.
Researchers at the Medical Center
have recently found that higher than
normal doses of saquinavir prove to be
much more effective in reducing viral
load, or the amount of virus in HlV
infected individuals, with only minor
side effects, according to Dr. Jonathan
Schapiro, postdoctoral fellow in infec
tious diseases.
Schapiro performed the study with
lab director Mark Winters, physician
assistant Jane Norris and other
researchers at Stanford's Center for
AIDS Research.
"Very high doses appeared to sup
press HIV infection without life
threatening toxicities, and the side
effects are reversible, making this
experimental drug very attractive to
physicians and patients," said
Scbapiro.
He presented the group's findings
Sept. 18 at the 35th Annual Inter
science Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy in San
Francisco.
A handful of pharmaceutical compa
nies are currently developing protease
inhibitors to fight HIV infection, but
so far saquinavir is the furthest along
in development and testing.
The Stanford group studied 40 HlV
positive patient volunteers — 20
receiving twice the previously tried
dose of saquinavir and 20 receiving
four times the original amount. To
qualify for the study, patients were
required to have a low CD4 count and
no outward symptoms of AIDS. CD4

cells, needed for a healthy immune sys
tem, are characteristically low in HlV
infected individuals.
Previous clinical trials with protease
inhibitors like saquinavir showed only
modest anti-HIV activity and almost
no side effects. This prompted Dr.
Thomas C. Merigan, who supervised
the study as director of the Center for
AIDS Research at Stanford, to design a
carefully monitored study involving
much higher doses of the drug.
The group hypothesized that one
reason why lower doses of saquinavir
had not worked as well might be due to
reduced bioavailability, or actual drug
concentration, inside the body. It turns
out that saquinavir is in fact poorly
absorbed by the body, then destroyed
by the liver — leaving very little active
drug left to combat the HIV virus,
Schapiro noted.
The HIV virus invades cells, using
and abusing them to manufacture
copies of itself. All currently available
anti-HIV drugs work by inhibiting
enzymes, or the workhorses, of the
11IV virus.
At present, the only anti-HIV drugs
approved for treating patients are
dideoxynucleoside analogs. One exam
ple of this type is AZT, or zidovudine.
The target of drugs like AZT is a pro
tein made by the HIV virus called
reverse transcriptase, an enzyme
involved in a very early step of virus
production. AZT works by shutting off
reverse transcriptase.
In contrast, saquinavir blocks a dif
ferent enzyme in the HIV life cycle,
affecting a later maturation phase. The
deadly HIV virus replicates itself by
synthesizing a long precursor protein,
which requires processing into smaller
pieces to form functional virus parti
cles. This process is accomplished by
another HIV-made enzyme called pro-

tease. Protease inhibitors, like
the drug saquinavir, block this
step, leaving large unpro
cessed blobs of protein —
"junk viruses" — which are
not infectious, Schapiro said.
One of the most trouble
some features of viruses like
HIV is their high mutation
rate, or their ability to con
stantly change — enough to
make them rapidly resistant to
drugs like AZT. So far, prelim
inary results suggest that
patients receiving high-dose
saquinavir may be less likely
to develop resistance to the
drug, since higher doses were
associated with a lower viral
mutation rate, Schapiro said.
Another advantage to using
protease inhibitors like
saquinavir is that human pro
teases, which are essential
parts of living cells, are very
different from the HIV pro
tease, rendering them unaf
fected by the inhibitor,
Schapiro pointed out. This is
m contrast to reverse tran
scriptase inhibitors like AZT,
which have as their target an
HIV enzyme with similarities
to an enzyme found in a nor
mal human cell. This results
in some of the toxic side
effects of AZT on human cells
in the body.

The most promising route for thera
py might be a combination approach so
that lower doses of several drugs can
be given simultaneously — hitting
multiple targets of the HIV virus while
minimizing side effects. "It's likely
that two, three, even four drugs in
combination might both reduce viral
load as well as the number of muta

tions," said Schapiro.
However, Schapiro expressed cau
tion about regarding saquinavir as a
cure. "We don't know if this drop in
viral load and increase in CD4 cells will
result in patients living longer," he
said.
Several companies, including Hoff
mann-La Roche, who provided some of
the funding for the study, are current

ly searching for improved formulations
of protease inhibitors like saquinavir,
which will be better absorbed by the
body.
Schapiro emphasized that the study
represented a great example of cooper
ation between Stanford and the neigh
boring community. "The patients in
the study were an excellent group of
dedicated volunteers," he said.
