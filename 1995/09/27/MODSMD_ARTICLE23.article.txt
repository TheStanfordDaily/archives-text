# Beyond the Cold War . . .
## Springer leads department to new heights 
### Anand Ramachandran Contributing writer 
Despite a significant decline
in the aerospace industry over
the past few years, due primari
ly to the end of the Cold War,
tlu i technology inspired by the
astronautics and aeronautics
fields are proving to be as valu
able as air and space travel
itself.
Stanford's Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics
continues to be a leader in the
emerging field of composite
materials engineering.
Aeronautics and Astronau
tics Chair George Springer con
ducts investigations on compos
ite materials and develops new
uses for them. Composites are
materials made up of either
glass, kevlar, graphites or com
binations of these and other
substances. All composites
share three characteristics:
lightness, strength and stiff
ness. A composite can be both
strong and flexible.
The uses of composite mate
rials being developed at Stan
ford is the most exciting part of
Springer's research. Springer
and his colleagues have been
successful in using new compos

ite materials, purchased in bulk
from different manufacturers,
to help make not just spacecraft
parts, but also fishing rods, ten
nis racquets, bicycles, sailboats
and artificial hearts.
The Stanford group creates
what are called "smart struc
tures." That is, they develop tin 1
techniques and processes by
which such products as tennis
racquets are made.
These smart structures come
in many forms, such as design
tools for manufacturing and
product development. These
tools are then dispersed to vari
ous private companies as com
puter software.
Using the software produced
at Stanford, companies can
design products using the com
posite materials. Springer pro
vided the analogy of a tailor
with a roll of cloth, who wants
to know how to make a suit as
opposed to a rag.
The Stanford team in the
astronautics department pro
vides the know-how to turn raw
materials into finished prod
ucts. Currently numbering over
50, the Stanford computer
codes are used throughout the
world.
Another form of a smart

structure is an "expert system"
— a self-controlling mechanism.
For example, the Stanford team
has produced new mirrors for
use in space.
These new mirrors incorpo
rate piezo-electrics, fiber optic
technology and actuators woven
into the composite mirror to
control the mirror's warping.
This is done by cleverly taking
advantage of a key feature of
the new composites — their
ability, unlike metals, to bend in
one direction but not in anoth
er.
As the mirror in space begins
to warp in one direction, a sig
nal can actually be sent through
the mirror to warp it back the
other way. The result is a mir
ror that behaves as if it were not
in space. This could prove to be
very useful for the future of
space telescopes such as the
Hubble Telescope.
Composite materials still
continue to play an active role
in the aeronautics industry,
from which they first evolved.
For example, many of the new
Boeing 777 commercial aircraft
used by United Airlines are
made of composite materials.
The floor panoling for the cargo
is composed of fiberglass, epoxy

and aluminum with a wood
core.
The hull of the jet engines
are made of carbon fiber, epoxy
and an aluminum honeycomb
which provides great strength
and resistance to heat, while
being very light.
As a result, the new 777 can
carry the same load as a 747
while requiring two less
engines.
Another very practical and
interesting use of the composite
materials is in sporting goods
such as tennis racquets and
bicycles. There is always a great
demand for lighter, stronger
bicycles, but the composite bicy
cles produced thanks to the
research at Stanford far exceed
ed the expectations of even the
most discriminating cyclists.
The latest composite bicycle
introduced by the Kestrel com
pany is "an innovative three
piece Rubicon composite frame
that allows the suspension to
interact with a rider's position
in or out of the saddle."
The cycle itself is made of a
carbon fiber and kevlar thermo
plastic. The composites are
"cooked" at just the right tem
perature and pressure to pro
duce a thermoplastic with the
desired qualities. The processes
of this "cooking" are being
developed here at Stanford.
The Stanford program is also
geared toward very specific
problems in the private sector,
an innovation new to the
department. Springer explains
that recently a ski company
complained of lackluster perfor
mance from existing skis. One
of the department's 25 doctoral
students was soon at work in
developing new skis fashioned
out of the new composites.
Springer cites another exam
ple of his department's innova
tive edge, using the story of the
Americas Cup to illustrate the
wide spectrum of uses for com
posites.
When the United States team
for the Americas Cup Yachting
race needed a faster boat, the
Stanford group was able to
develop new uses for composite
kevlar, graphite, and glass. The
American boat, A-3, made of the
new composites, won the Amer
icas Cup.
The future of these new com
posite materials is very promis
ing, says Springer. In addition
to continuing its development of
composite rockets and shuttle
parts for NASA, the department
is making the most of a declin
ing space industry by diversify
ing its work into the by-product
fields of astronautics engineer
ing.
