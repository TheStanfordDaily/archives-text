# Get off the ceiling

Q. How can flies land any
where — like upside
• down on a ceiling ?
A As you stealthily make
• your approach to kill
• the irritating buzzing
noise, moments before the net
of the fly-swatter squishes the
microscopic beast to a pulp,
millimeters from victorious and
crushing death — the bug
escapes. You know what I'm
talking about. Everytime
you're trying to read your oh
so-interesting CIV book, tiny
pests insist on practicing acro-

batic maneuvers in
front of your face.
Let's face it. We
(let's not forget — I
am the Science Bug)
bugs have an uncan
ny ability to escape.
Not only are we phe
nomenally quick, we
can go everywhere
and anywhere you
mere mortals can't
— like your ceiling.
Now, how do we bugs
manage to land
upside down on the
ceiling, you ask?
Well, when a bug
heads for the ceiling,

its flying right side up. So, to
land on the ceiling, it must do
a flip somewhere along the
way. But when? Where? How?
Elementary, my dear Spider
man-idolizer.
Now, there are really only
two ways for a bug, or any
thing for that matter, to flip
over. Imagine you were an Air
Force jet pilot coming in for a
landing on an aircraft carrier.
Except this time there's a twist
— you're approaching the run
way hardtop facing down. How
would you straighten yourself
out? You would do a spin, or a
hard roll to one side. You could
then land safely.
It was thought for a long
time that this was how we
bugs also managed to land,
except that our runway was
upside down on the ceiling.
But you humans were just
plain wrong. We bugs are not
quite so adept at rolling over.
Unlike jet aircraft, which have
large engines for thrust, we
have to flap our winds really,
really fast, which can get real
ly, really tiring. It is nearly
impossible for bugs to roll over
while flying.
Once high speed cameras
were developed, nosy humans
(and there are a lot of them)
could spy on our activities and

observe our flight patterns
closely. High speed cameras
take several hundred pictures
per second. With these cam
eras, scientists were able to
watch flies as they landed on
the ceiling. Surprisingly, the
scientists found that the bugs
didn't do a barrel roll like the
pilots. Instead, they did more
of a back flip — kind of a gym
nastic — or rather bugnastic
— maneuver.
When a bug is on the ceil
ing, it sticks its forward feet
out ahead of its body. Using a
half-flip, the bug plants its feet
on the ceiling. Then Mr. Bug
swings the rest of its body up
until all six legs — count 'em

— are firmly on
the ceiling. Fur
thermore, we bugs
secrete a sticky
substance from the
pads of our feet,
which helps us
hang on.
Once the bug
is on the ceiling, it
can even move
around upside
down. The usual
bug-activities —
picnics, barbecues,
walks along the
beach — can all he
accomplished
while comfortably

hanging from the ceiling. How
ever, to avoid the coming dan
ger of the dreaded fly-swatter,
the bug must stay alert. This
raises another interesting
question: how does a fly get off
the ceiling just as death
approaches?
The answer to this question
is a bit simpler. You see, we
bugs have these incredible sen
sors on our heads that warn us
of incoming danger — our
huge bug eyes! Endowed with
these rather useful monstrosi
ties, we can detect very slight
changes in light — like the
shadow of the savage fly-swat
ter or a human hand.
When a bug detects danger,
it stops producing the sticky
substance, jumps off the ceil
ing (or any surface) and flies
off for dear life. So, I'll give
you a little secret: If you ever
need to swat a poor relative of
mine (and there are a couple
that I'm dying to get rid of),
aim just ahead of the bug.
When the bug jumps up to
escape, it'll jump right into
your trap. Now — go kill your
self a bug.
