# COP outlines proactive student-service goals for the year
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Contributing writer 
Financial aid and better faculty advis
ing are among the top priorities for the'
new Council of Presidents. Elected last
April, Mike Choo, Nicole Vazquez, Rich
Stolz and Jon Oram plan to really focus
on student needs.
Vice Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds said she met with
the new COP last spring to outline goals
for the year.
"I want them to be very actively
involved with (incoming Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais) as well," Edmonds said
One way the COP plans to put their
ideas into action is through a new intern
ship program aimed at underclassmen,
particularly freshmen. Dorm representa
tives will be given responsibilities as
interns in tin l ASSU.
"We want to connect to the dorm rep
resentatives and put them into working
ASS I' positions," Stolz said.
In recent years, dorm representatives
have actively attended ASSU meetings at
the beginning of the year hut participa
tion has dwindled later in the year.
"We'll he putting the representatives
to work on projects like the course guide,
where they learn to how to research a
project and pass the issue through the
administration." Stolz said.
Oram stressed that one of the OOP's
major goals is to work proactively, not
only serving to "jump up and scream
when a fire alarm goes of 112 " Choo agreed,
hut said much of their experience had
been in reacting to problems.
For example, Choo said, the ASSU
intervened last year when a new Univer
sity policy threatened to limit solicitation
of alumni donations by student groups.
This proactive attitude applies to
another project the COP is concerned

with — faculty advising. Oram said that
after talking to freshmen, he and the
other COP members noticed that some
parts of the advising system are less than
adequate. The COP wants to address the
problem before the issue becomes too
heated.
Oram said the COP is considering pro
viding positive incentives for faculty to
encourage good and enthusiastic advis
ing, hoping that faculty will set good
examples for each other.
The COP also wants to be proactive on
the national controversy over federal
financial aid.
"The cost of education is rising, and
we need to inform the student body about
what is going on in Congress," Choo said
"We want to research what is happening,
educate the student body and organize
advocacy about the cuts in aid."
Last year the COP organized a rally
and a letter-writing campaign against
proposed cuts to student aid in Congress
Stolz said they plan to try to set up an
office in the ASSU that deals with stu
dent financial aid and informs students
about the changes in federal financial aid
to schools.
Another project in the works for the
ASSU is a course guide — a publication
which evaluates courses according to stu
dent opinions, including reviews of the
professor and the course materials.
Although it is unlikely that a course
guide will be available this year, the COP
plans to lay the foundation for the project
by conducting evaluations and providing
a framework.
Choo will also continue the OOP's
work to improve postal service at Stan
ford, most importantly making it faster,
but also looking into alternate means of
mail delivery.
Oram, a co-terminal student, repre
sent.-- the ('()P's link to Stanford's gradu

ate schools This year, the members o!
tlic COP plan t<> make special efforts to
reach the graduate student population by
putting out .1 biweekly newsletter report
ing the activities of the ANSI' It will be
delivered to graduate students depart
mental mailboxes.
The ('()!' will also hold programs in

graduate residences and attempt to reach
students through e-mail. The COP also
plans to form a graduate student caucus
so graduate students are better able to
represent their own interests
Stolz said that the COP would also like
to set up a survey system to better under
stand student needs Although the ASS I

currently uses phone polls, the creation
of tin' new Virtual Directory will make
reaching students more efficient. The
only problem with reaching students
through tlu' Directory's World Wide Web
site, Stolz said, is that the polling may not
be as random as through the previous
system.
