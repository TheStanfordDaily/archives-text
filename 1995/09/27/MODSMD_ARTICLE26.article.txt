## Anchors away! Stanford sailing faces season of uncertainty Co-ed sailing hopes to overcome youth 
### Daniel Kao Editorial Staff 
Stanford's co-ed sailing team, a high
seas powerhouse throughout the last cou
ple of years, will find itself traversing
murky waters filled with surprises this
upcoming season
After leading the nation for most of
last year, this year's seventh-ranked Car
dinal squad finds itself in a position that
can only be described as "in transition
Stanford not only graduated its top sailor,
Ail-American Charles Meade, but also
finds itself without senior leadership
Aside from one junior, the remaining
members of Stanford's youthful crew are
all sophomores and freshmen. I'his can be
seen as the bad news, according to coach
Steve Bourdow.
The good news, however, is that Bour
dow raced many of this season's sopho
mores last year as freshmen to get them
some experience. As for talent, there's no
shortage of that for the Cardinal sailors.
"We have only one junior returning,
and all the rest are sophomores and fresh
men," Bourdow said. "But they're a good
group.
"We didn't have that great of a finish
last year because we used so many fresh
man. Last year, they lacked experience,

but now they have that experience."
The headline sophomores will be last
year's freshmen stars -John Meade,
younger brother of Charles Meade, Dan
Zimbaldi, and I'hil Barow .Junior skipper
Adam Lowry will serve as the elder states
man and leader of the bunch.
A talented freshmen crop includes
standout Steve Kleha "1 expect [Klehal
to be very strong," Bourdow said. "He
just needs to settle in. We kind of rushed
our frosh last year "
With a youthful but nevertheless tal
ented core, the Cardinal will once again
tout one of the deepest teams in the
nation. "We're deep as usual, Bourdow
said. "We have much more talent and
depth than a lot of other schools.
"We'll definitely fare better at the larg
er regattas where teams are required to
use more personnel "
Still, despite the talent and depth,
other teams in California are making a
strong push for the national crown, an act
best illustrated by the California Golden
Bears' No.l ranking.
The young Cardinal won't just roll
over and die however. Stanford per
formed satisfactorily at a preseason inter
sectional, where the team finished sev-
ent h.
"It was a fairly strong start,'
Hourdow said "We have sonii

exciting freshmen. The finish in
seventh was okay."
Stanford hopes to perform a
little better in the season-open
ing Navy Fall Regatta on Oct. 13
and 14. A top-five finish is the
goal.
However, with such a vouth

ful group, there will be little
pressure.
"We led for all of last year,
and we felt some of that pres
sure," Bourdow said. "Now,
we're so young that the pressure
is completely off. I think we'll
surprise some people."
