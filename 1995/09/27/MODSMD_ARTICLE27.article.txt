# Women sailors look to answer questions
## 
### Daniel Kao Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's sailing team
stood atop the rest of the heap for half of
last season. However, the squad fell apart
towards the end of last year, producing a
disappointing and shakv ninth-place fin
ish at Nationals.
With the start of this season on the
horizon, the women's team once again
finds itself on shaky, unstable ground and
choppy waters.
The third-ranked team might not
remain No. 3 for long after losing two of
its stars, seniors Cinnamon Hampikian
and Gretchen Uznis.
"We're really disappointed in losing
Cinnamon and Gretchen," said head
coach Steve Bourdow. " They're both pret
ty hard-core Ipremedical students] and
really wanted to concentrate on their
studies."
That leaves last year's ace skipper
Alice Manard as the lone returnee from
what was once a very talented upper-class
core of skippers. To make matters worse,
Manard's crew, senior All-American Sibyl
Diver, will be abroad for much of the sea
son, hut will fortunately return in time
for the spring season.
"Alice is really solid,'' Bourdow said
"She'll be sailing and performing well in a

lot of the single-handed events. At the
same time, she'll also be asked to train ;i
new crew.
"We're going to struggle a little bit in

'We re going to struggle a
little bit in the beginning.
We're ranked No. 3 right
now, but a lot of that prob
ably has to do with last
season s success. After
sailing in one event, the
rankers will probably
know that this team lost
some talent.'

the beginning We're ranked No 3 now,
but a lot of that probably has to do with
last M'ason s success. After sailing in one
event, the rankers will probably know
that this team lost some talent.
Losing its two top recruits to
other schools doesn't help Stan
ford's program either. One recruit
just recently sailed herself to a
first-place finish for Dartmouth.
With the loss of Hampikian
and Uznis, sophomore Susan
Bradford, who switched to crew
last season, will be asked to go
back to driving and skippering
the boat.
"It may take a little time for
Susan because of the transition
from switching her to crew and
asking her to go back to driving,"
Bourdow said, "but we're look
ing for her to fill in and step up."
That leaves somewhat of an X
factor for the third skipper slot,
as freshman Taylor Robinson wdl
tic handling those duties. Hope
fully for the Cardinal, that ques
tion and others will be answered
in the affirmative this coming
weekend at the Single-handed
Districts at Stanford and at the
Naw Fall Reiratta in October
