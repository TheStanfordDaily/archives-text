# Golf reloads with new talent
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Last year, the perennially strong Stanford
men's golf program received a tremendous
boost from the arrival of Tiger Woods, admit
tedly the most highly-touted junior golfer
ever to join the college ranks. However, this
season's infusion of new blood appears to be
no less impressive.
Head coach Wally Goodwin emerges from
the recruiting wars with freshmen Joel Kri
hel and Scott Wang, two of the most sought
after prospects to hit the links this year.
"1 his is definitely a really strong crop for
us, Goodwin said. " These guys could defi
nitely make an impact immediately."
As the top junior for the last two years,
Kribel is clearly the crown jewel of the
incoming class. The California native has
displayed talent over the last few years that
has left coaches and recruiters drooling.
"He does everything well," Goodwin said.
"He drives for tremendous distance, has a
great irons game and putts well too. He has a
tremendous future."
Such rave reviews inevitably create com
parisons between Kribel and last year's golf
wunderkind Woods. Already, Kribel has
shown comparable ability, nearly sweeping

He drives for tremendous dis
tance, has a great irons game
and putts well too. He has a
tremendous future.'

last year's American Junior Golf Associa
tion's four major tournaments and posting a
lower stroke average than Woods did when
he played in the events a year earlier.
"Obviously, it's hard to compare the two
results since they played in different years
against different people," Goodwin said, "but
it was the same courses and tournaments."
Coming in with Kribel, fellow Californian
Wang is Goodwin's second coup of the
recruiting season. Wang, born and raised for
eight years in Taiwan, is the product of
Robert Louis Stevenson High near Pebble
Beach, a preparatory school renowned for its
powerhouse golf program. While not as wide
ly known as ivnbcl, Wang, still hopes to con
tribute this year.
"I know that I'm not as good as Tiger or
•Joel, he said. "Hopefully, I can just play
hard and help the team out."
Like Kribel, Wang brings with him his
own pedigree, having finished second in the
California State Juniors a year ago. He also
shares the burden of comparisons, hailing
from the same high school as former Stan
ford great Christian Cevaer, a two-time All-
American, two-time Pacific 10 Conference
champion and holder of the second lowest
career stroke average in Stanford history.
"It doesn't really affect me, Wang said. "1
don't feel like I have to walk in Christian's
footsteps or anything. I just want to play my
very best."
In addition to his two proteges, Goodwin
may get an unexpected bonus out of the
freshman class in walk-on Tyler Dennis. The
Salt Lake City native is currently playing in
qualifiers in an attempt to make the team.
"1 like Tyler a lot." Goodwin said. "He's a
hard-working guy and a great kid who
doesn't give up. I'm not sure where he stands
right now, but I'm sure that he'll give it his
best until the very end of the qualifiers."
