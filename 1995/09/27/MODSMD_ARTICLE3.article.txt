# Salamander delays grad dorm
## Threatened species pushes construction back a year 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Just when students and faculty thought they had heard the
last of the California tiger salamander, the threatened species
has popped up again. This time, the 6-inch black salamander has
postponed the construction and opening of a new graduate stu
dent residence.
The tiger salamander gained campus-wide attention in the
fall of 1993, when concern over its extinction caused the Univer
sity to cancel the traditional Big Game Bonfire held annually in
the Lagunita lake bed. The bonfire — which was sponsored and
funded by the Axe Committee — was normally held the week be
fore the Stanford-UC-Berkeley football game as part of the Big
Game rally; it typically towered about 250 feet high.
The University postponed the bonfire indefinitely last year
pending more study of the habitat and migration patterns of the
salamanders.
Groundbreaking on the graduate housing, to be located near
Governor's Corner, was originally supposed to begin this sum
mer With concern over the effects on the salamanders living in
and around Lake Lagunita, however, the groundbreaking has
been delayed and is now set to begin in June 1996.
"It was found that the construction might disturb the migra
tion route of t lie salamanders,"' said Keith Guy, director of Hous
ing and Dining Services. "As part of the mitigation, we plan to
survey that area."
One of the biggest populations of tiger salamanders is in the

lake bed itself. The salamander, once thought to be extinct in the
Peninsula area, lays its eggs in the lake bed during the winter and
spring. When the lake is drained during the summer, the sala
manders migrate out into the surrounding area and hibernate in
burrows.
