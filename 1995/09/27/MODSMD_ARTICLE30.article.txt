# Top-ranked cycling club speeds into new season
## Cardinal cyclists strive to be nothing but the best 
### Courtney Mann Editorial staff 
On a campus with moun
tain bikes and racing cycles
at every turn, it is only fit
ting that the Stanford
Cycling Club boasts a No. 1
ranking among 100 colle
giate cycling teams around
the country.
The club sport, a part of
Stanford athletics for over
20 years, most recently
placed second at the Track
Cycling Nationals earlier
this month. Marian College
edged the Cardinal with Hl3
points to Stanford's 732 in
the track competition, in
which cyclists race their
way around a .330-meter
track without brakes. All-
American senior Tracy
Timms led the Cardinal
with a second-place finish in
the competition.
Stanford's No. 1 rank
ing, however, reflects its
ability to perform success
fully on all three cycling
cylinders — track cycling,
road racing and mountain
hiking. While the Cardinal
trains this fall for the
upcoming Mountain Rike
Nationals at Fort Lewis
College in Durango, Col.,

Stanford already wears the
road racing crown. The Car
dinal took that title at the
Road Nationals last May,
edging out California by 19
points.

'The first priority
is Mountain Bike
Nationals. We have
to do well to retain
our No. 1 ranking.'
-Dave Bailey

Stanford's only competitor,
as the Colorado Buffaloes
landed third place with only
287 total points compared
to Stanford's 420. Tirnms, a
co-captain of this year's
club, again paced the Cardi
nal with a fourth-place fin
ish. while All-American
Joan Wilson led the club
with a second-place perfor
mance.
Yet the Cardinal remains
unsatisfied with one cham
pionship as the Mountain

Bike Nationals sits on the
horizon. "The first priority
is Mountain Hikt» Nation
als," said Ail-American
graduate student Dave Bai
ley. "We have to do well in
order to retain our No. 1
ranking. We basically want
to do what we did last year,
which is win the conference
championship and then go
on to win team nationals."
The race will consist of
four laps around an eight
mile loop which will chal
lenge riders with over 1,000
feet of climbing and single
track racing. In last year's
first-ever Mountain Bike
Nationals, the Cardinal
placed sixth. Graduate stu
dent Mike Cummer finished
first in the B category for
Stanford
"Mike probably could
have placed in the top five
or six in the A category, but
we wanted to get the points
for first place," Bailey said.
Along with Timms, Bai
ley, Wilson and Cummer,
the club features another
All-American in sophomore
Margot Quandt. Quandt,
who also rows for Stanford,
has earned Ail-American
