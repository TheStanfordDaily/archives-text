# Top-ranked cycling club speeds into new season
## Cardinal cyclists strive to be nothing but the best 
### Courtney Mann Editorial staff 
On a campus with moun
tain bikes and racing cycles
at every turn, it is only fit
ting that the Stanford
Cycling Club boasts a No. 1
ranking among 100 colle
giate cycling teams around
the country.
The club sport, a part of
Stanford athletics for over
20 years, most recently
placed second at the Track
Cycling Nationals earlier
this month. Marian College
edged the Cardinal with Hl3
points to Stanford's 732 in
the track competition, in
which cyclists race their
way around a .330-meter
track without brakes. All-
American senior Tracy
Timms led the Cardinal
with a second-place finish in
the competition.
Stanford's No. 1 rank
ing, however, reflects its
ability to perform success
fully on all three cycling
cylinders — track cycling,
road racing and mountain
hiking. While the Cardinal
trains this fall for the
upcoming Mountain Rike
Nationals at Fort Lewis
College in Durango, Col.,

Stanford already wears the
road racing crown. The Car
dinal took that title at the
Road Nationals last May,
edging out California by 19
points.
The Golden Bears were

'The first priority
is Mountain Bike
Nationals. We have
to do well to retain
our No. 1 ranking.'
-Dave Bailey

Stanford's only competitor,
as the Colorado Buffaloes
landed third place with only
287 total points compared
to Stanford's 420. Tirnms, a
co-captain of this year's
club, again paced the Cardi
nal with a fourth-place fin
ish. while All-American
Joan Wilson led the club
with a second-place perfor
mance.
Yet the Cardinal remains
unsatisfied with one cham
pionship as the Mountain

Bike Nationals sits on the
horizon. "The first priority
is Mountain Hikt» Nation
als," said Ail-American
graduate student Dave Bai
ley. "We have to do well in
order to retain our No. 1
ranking. We basically want
to do what we did last year,
which is win the conference
championship and then go
on to win team nationals."
The race will consist of
four laps around an eight
mile loop which will chal
lenge riders with over 1,000
feet of climbing and single
track racing. In last year's
first-ever Mountain Bike
Nationals, the Cardinal
placed sixth. Graduate stu
dent Mike Cummer finished
first in the B category for
Stanford
"Mike probably could
have placed in the top five
or six in the A category, but
we wanted to get the points
for first place," Bailey said.
Along with Timms, Bai
ley, Wilson and Cummer,
the club features another
All-American in sophomore
Margot Quandt. Quandt,
who also rows for Stanford,
has earned Ail-American
recognition for two consecutive
years us a truck cyclist.
After the mountain bike sea
son ends in December, the
cycling club will cross-truin
during winter in prepurution
for the road season, which will
thrust them into races every
weekend in spring.
While they train for Stan
ford, a number of cyclists will
also have the red, white and
blue in tho buck of their minds,
us they huve intentions of
showcasing their talents at the
Olympic Trials. "A few others
und 1 ure going to try to go to
Olympic Trials, and we're
going to be training pretty hard
for that," Bailey said, lie will
team up with Ma-Ne Rodriguez
and Takeshi Doy.
Timms also hopes to repre
sent the United States. "I went
to Trials four years ago when 1
started at Stanford and did
fairly well, but not well enough
to be a part of the team," he
said. "As far as this year, it's
pretty difficult [to make the
team]. But my goal is to have a
top-10 finish at the Olympic
Trials."
Stanford's cycling success
does not come without dedica
tion and training, however. The
club heads out from the post
office every afternoon at 3:30
p.m. for rides of varied difficul
ty for anywhere between 15
and 40 miles. On weekends it
leaves the post office as early us
9:00 u.m. on rides as long us
1 'J<> miles.
The Club will hold un infor
mational meeting for interest
ed riders of all experience next
Wednesduy. Additional infor
