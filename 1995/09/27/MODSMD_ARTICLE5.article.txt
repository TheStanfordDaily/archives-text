### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
In only its second year back on cam
pus, summer storage seems to onct
again be a thorn in the University'. l
side.
According to Herma Ross, adminis
trative service manager at Housing Fa
cilities and Services, seven student, 1
have reported their bikes missing in tin
basement of Stern Hall after leaving
them there over the summer in Univer

sitv storage.
"We're checking through, the entire
space now," Ross said. "Because of the
[SternJ construction, there was a lot of
dust and debris down there. ... It's
easy to miss the tags on the bikes. ''
Stern Hall was renovated this sum
mer as part of the Capital Improvement
Program, a 12-year program designed
to refurbish all the major undergradu
ate and graduate residences on campus.
The bikes were stored in the Twain
basement, a place that Ross said was

originally not going to be disturbed dur
ing the Stern renovation.
"The const ruction has just been un
believable," Ross said. "The place was
under lock and key. ... It is very un
likely that t he bikes are missing."
Sophomore Josh Koons, who is one
of the seven students who reported
their bikes missing, disagreed.
"A friend of mine and I looked
through all the sections twice," he said.
"I'm pretty doubtful that we over
looked it

I le added, however, that there was
"quite a bit of dust on everything" and
that the storage area was not very well
lit.
When he approached Ross, he was
reassured that the problem would be
resolved by the end of the week, Koons
said.
"They said they would replace the
bike, or something along those lines,"
he said.
Ross confirmed that the I 'Diver
sity would lend replacement bikes
to the students while they were
looking for the missing ones.
"We want to make sure these
students do have the ability to move
around and be mobile," she said.
"We will have the problem resolved

b\ Friday Right now, we're assum
ing |the bikesl are all t here
If the bikes are not recovered,
Ross said, the Iniversity will do
"everything we can to make sure
students are satisfied, adding
that the I diversity may replace
the bikes or reimburse the stu
dents.
To find the bikes, Ross said,
housing officials will confer with the
contractors who renovated Stern to
make sure that the hikes were not

relocated during construction.
This year, students had to pay
$20 to have their bikes stored in
Stern. Because of budget con
straints and fire codes, free sum
mer storage was discontinued for
two years in 1992. In 1994, the
University reintroduced summer
storage but began charging a fee.
Ross added that in all her years
with summer storage, she has
never had a problem with any
thing being lost.
