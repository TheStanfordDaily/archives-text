In only its second year back on cam
pus, summer storage seems to onct
again be a thorn in the University'. l
side.
According to Herma Ross, adminis
trative service manager at Housing Fa
cilities and Services, seven student, 1
have reported their bikes missing in tin
basement of Stern Hall after leaving
them there over the summer in Univer

sitv storage.
"We're checking through, the entire
space now," Ross said. "Because of the
[SternJ construction, there was a lot of
dust and debris down there. ... It's
easy to miss the tags on the bikes. ''
Stern Hall was renovated this sum
mer as part of the Capital Improvement
Program, a 12-year program designed
to refurbish all the major undergradu
ate and graduate residences on campus.
The bikes were stored in the Twain
basement, a place that Ross said was

originally not going to be disturbed dur
ing the Stern renovation.
"The const ruction has just been un
believable," Ross said. "The place was
under lock and key. ... It is very un
likely that t he bikes are missing."
Sophomore Josh Koons, who is one
of the seven students who reported
their bikes missing, disagreed.
"A friend of mine and I looked
through all the sections twice," he said.
"I'm pretty doubtful that we over
looked it

I le added, however, that there was
"quite a bit of dust on everything" and
that the storage area was not very well
lit.
When he approached Ross, he was
reassured that the problem would be
resolved by the end of the week, Koons
said.
"They said they would replace the
bike, or something along those lines,"
he said.
