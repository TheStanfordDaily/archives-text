# Ethical questions for Sofaer
## Hoover fellow under censure 
### Amy Slueter Staff writer 
When Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Abraham
Sofaer agreed to represent the government of Libya in
the case of the 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight
103, he was fully convinced that he was making a
morally and ethically appropriate decision.

However, District of Columbia
Bar Counsel Leonard Becker did not
agree. According to Becker, Sofaer
violated "revolving door" rules
which specify that government em
ployees cannot privately participate
in the same matters in which they
had government involvement.
Becker submitted a formal peti
tion to censure Sofaer in -July, with
public hearings to take place in De

cember.
Throughout his tenure us chief State Department
legal adviser, Sofaer was responsible for formulating
various foreign policies, including those focused on
terrorist regimes. At. the State Department, Sofaer
had access to briefings and ot her classified documents
dealing with the Pan Arn case.
Sofaer, however, said he believes his actions were
not in violation of federal or Bar Counsel codes.
"1 believe that what I was planning to do was right,"
Sofaer said in an interview yesterday. After he agreed
to represent Libya on a limited basis, he said he was
confronted with such a hostile public reaction that he
never filed any documents or met with any I >ibyan rep
resentatives.
Sofaer, a former federal district judge, said be was
not interested in helping the Libyan government shirk
their responsibilities to the victim's families, but in
bringing the Libyan government in line with U.N. Se
curity Council resolutions.
Those resolutions require the Libyan government to
pay compensation to each of the families of the 270 vic
tims caught in the explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The resolutions also require the Libyans to surrender

Libyan nationals Basset Ali
Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Khitnah so they can be tried in con
nection with the bombing in either
the I nited States or Scotland.

"To this day I think it would In
a useful and proper thing for me t<
try to convince tin 1 Libyan govern
ment to comply with the 1 \
Security Council resolutions.'
Sofaer said.
"It was a dangerous thing for
me to do politically, but it was con
sistent with my obligations a:- <i
lawyer, as an American and as ;i

Jew," Sofaer added, explaining
that he has often been charged
with selling out his ideals.
This accusation, Sofaer said, i
based on the fact that many peoplt
believe he had agreed to helj
1 Jbyan dictator Moammar (iadhafi
evade the law. 1 ie contends, howev
er, that this has never been tin
case.

"The Libyans originally came to
me asking for me to represent Gad
hafi, but I told them I would only
help them to comply with the I'.N.
resolutions." Sofaer said. " They
agreed to pay me to help them meet
the resolutions in a face-saving
way."
According to an Associated
I Yess report, t he Libyans offered to

pay Sofaer $250,000 a month for
his services.
Sofaer said the Libyans hired
him so that they could improve
their relationship with the Tinted
Nations and the international com
munity.
"It always helps people when
they do the right thing," Sofaer
said, explaining that Libya would

benefit bv complying with the U.N.
resolutions.
After the December hearings,
Sofaer said he plans to concentrate
once again on his studies in law,
diplomacy and national security.
"When it is over, people will
come back, and I firmly believe that
people will conclude that I did not
do anything wrong," Sofaer said.
