# Ethical questions for Sofaer
## Hoover fellow under censure 
### Amy Slueter Staff writer 
When Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Abraham
Sofaer agreed to represent the government of Libya in
the case of the 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight
103, he was fully convinced that he was making a
morally and ethically appropriate decision.

However, District of Columbia
Bar Counsel Leonard Becker did not
agree. According to Becker, Sofaer
violated "revolving door" rules
which specify that government em
ployees cannot privately participate
in the same matters in which they
had government involvement.
Becker submitted a formal peti
tion to censure Sofaer in -July, with
public hearings to take place in De

cember.
Throughout his tenure us chief State Department
legal adviser, Sofaer was responsible for formulating
various foreign policies, including those focused on
terrorist regimes. At. the State Department, Sofaer
had access to briefings and ot her classified documents
dealing with the Pan Arn case.
Sofaer, however, said he believes his actions were
not in violation of federal or Bar Counsel codes.
"1 believe that what I was planning to do was right,"
Sofaer said in an interview yesterday. After he agreed
to represent Libya on a limited basis, he said he was
confronted with such a hostile public reaction that he
never filed any documents or met with any I >ibyan rep
resentatives.
Sofaer, a former federal district judge, said be was
not interested in helping the Libyan government shirk
their responsibilities to the victim's families, but in
bringing the Libyan government in line with U.N. Se
curity Council resolutions.
Those resolutions require the Libyan government to
pay compensation to each of the families of the 270 vic
tims caught in the explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The resolutions also require the Libyans to surrender
