# A 						last look at joy, fun and five jam-packed days in the sun
## Freshmen reflect on their 1995 Orientation activities 
### Heather Knight Editorial staff 
As classes begin today, the Stanford
Class of 1999's carefree Orientation
days are over, and real college life be
gins.
The freshmen's reaction to their Ori
entation experience on the Farm is
about as diverse as the class itself.
One common complaint was that Ori
entation had been shortened by a day
"It's been fun, but it's also been kind
of hectic," said Hob Rakove, a Eucalipto
resident. "I find myself already adapting
to the college schedule. 1 sleep for five
hours and feel drowsy all the next day."
"It's been lots of fun, but it's been al
most too busy," said Allison Dietz, a res
ident in Larkin. "I wish they'd stretch it
over a longer time."
Avoiding several activities kept some

freshmen afloat in the campus bustle.
"I didn't go to most activities; I just
kind of explored it on my own, said Tay
lor Canfield, a Trancos resident, who at
tributed the decision to laziness.
Some freshmen actually liked the
packed schedule, however.
"I've loved Orientation. I think it's
great how busy it is. It's kept me from
being homesick," said Vanessa Krick
son, a Larkin resident.
Though most freshmen said they en
joyed the social activities, many thought
academic advising left a lot to be desired.
"I don't know how much I've learned
about the classes thing," said Corie
Calfee, a Donner resident. "There needs
to be a how-to book that says all the aca
demic questions."
"I wish there was more academic ad
vising. I don't really know about [classes
starting!," said Chad Milner.

Beverly Yang, a Branner resident,
said she doesn't feel ready for classes,
partially because she hasn't had much
contact with her freshman adviser. She
also said she has only seen her advising
associate once, which wasn't enough to
discuss her academic options.
MuFuUnSun and Faces in the Com
munity were among the most popular
activities receiving the majority of posi
tive coomments from this year's fresh
man.
Like last year, "Sex in the 9()'s" got
mixed reaction, however.
"1 didn't like 'Sex in the 9()'s,' " Mil
ner said. "I thought it was cliched and
did not address the issues "
Others thought the program was
fairly well done, however.
"It got the entire dorm talking," said

Junipero resident Brad Kane. "It
wasn't so cheesy. It got the point
across."
Several freshmen agreed that
some of their best experiences so
far have been dorm activities.
"I've gotten really close to my
dorm in just three days," Erick
son said.
" The dorm discussion adds ;i
lot — it's good to have that dia
logue," said Alice Cook, a Mirln

resident.
Freshmen were also pleased
with their newfound indepen
dence. "I like the freedom.
There's no curfew, no parents,"
Erickson said.
The deadlines, or lack thereof,
have proven strange for some
112 reshmen, though.
Calfee, a varsity swimmer, said
she was surprised to wake up for
early morning practice Tuesday
morning, while her dormmates
were just getting back from a long
night of partying.
"It was a new day for me and
an old dav for them." she said

Main memorable moments
have arisen throughout Orienta
tion for freshmen
Rakove said he was shocked
when he arrived at the entrance
of Kucalipto and bis resident
assistants began calling, "It's
Rob! It's Rob!"
"I thought, do I have celebrity
status here':'" he said "It was the
best possible way to start ()rienta
tion."
Others had trouble naming
their most memorable Orienta
tion moment.
"All the memorable moments, I
can't quite remember." Kane said
