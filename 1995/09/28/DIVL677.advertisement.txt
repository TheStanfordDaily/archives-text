Abunt t-'wr speakers; ,
Piem-Gilles de Gennes, a French theoretical physicist at the College de France, received the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1991. He has made ma/or contributions in the fields of
superconductivity, magnetism, polymer physics and liquid crystals. ()ver the course uf his
long and impressive career, he has pursued a wide variety of scientific fields.
Hanoch Gutfreund is President of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. He has
worked on the excitonic mechanism for organic and high temperature
superconductors, and has also made a number of contributions to the theory of
neural networks.
lierruirdo Huberman is a Xerox Research Fellow and a Consulting Professor in the
Department of Applied Physics at Stanford University. He has worked in condensed
matter physics, statistical mechanics and chaotic dynamics. He is a co-winner of the
1990 CECOIA prize in Economics and Artificial Intelligence.
Vladimir Kresin was born in Moscow, Russia, received his Ph.D. in the field of
superconductivity, and taught at Moscow University: He is known for his marry
contributions to strong coupling superconductors. Since 1980 he has been staff scientist at
, the Laurence Berkeley- laboratory, University of California, Berkeley.
