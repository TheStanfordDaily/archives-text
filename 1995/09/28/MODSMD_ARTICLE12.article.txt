# Senate passes GOP spending bill
## EPA, veterans to face cuts; Democrats suggest Clinton veto 
### 
WASHINGTON <AP> - Over Demo
cratic objections, the Senate passed a $62
billion spending bill yesterday that would
slash money for environmental protection,
housing programs and veterans' benefits.
Democrats, who said in advance that
they lacked the votes to make substantial
changes in the bill, urged President Clin
ton to veto it. The House previously
approved equal or divpt-r spending cuts, so
those differences must still Ik* resolved.
The legislation, passed by a vote of 55-
45, Is the first of three broad domestic
spending bills being considered by the Sen
ate this week. Senate Minority Leader
Thomas Daschle, D-5.1)., called the bills
"extremism on parade" and said the only
recourse was to urge a presidential veto.
The Senate bill would cut the Environ
mental Protection Agency's budget by
one-fourth to $5.6 billion, includinga $4.'M>
million slash in its Superfund program for
toxic waste cleanup.
It also would cut housing programs by
$5 billion, one-fiflh of current spending,
eliminate Clinton's Americorps national
service initiative and reduce veterans' pro

grams by $395 million.
Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska was the
lone Democrat to vote for the bill.
The reduction in the EPA budget —
though less severe than that approved by
the House — still "places the American
public at serious risk," said EPA Adminis
trator Carol Browner. She said air and
water pollution control efforts would be
curtailed and work at hundreds of Super
fund toxic waste sites would stop.
Republicans defended the spending
reductions as part of a broader campaign
to reduce the federal deficit.
"It sets priorities in very tough times,"
said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo. "We've
done ;ls good a job as possible within the
dollars available."
But Democrats said the priorities were
wrong and that many of the cuts would
finance tax reductions for the wealthy.
An attempt to restore $360 million to
help the homeless was rejected 52-48,
despite pleas that the cut in the homeless
assistance program would hurt "those
that are most in need." The House has
made even deeper cuts of $440 million in

the fund for the homeless.
The legislation also would scuttle Clin
ton's year-old Americorps national service
initiative, one of his favorites, by providing
no money for it. An attempt to restore
$425 million — half of what Clinton had
sought — w;is rejected 52-47.
The bill would cut veterans' programs
bv $395 million from current spending lev
els, for a new total of $37.3 billion, nearly
half of which is fixed spending that
Congress cannot change. Veterans health
benefits would be increased slightly but
kept at $700 million less than the adminis
tration had sought.
"As a veteran, I find this to be an
obscenity," said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
a decorated Vietnam War veteran.
"This is about priorities, about what we
stand for," Stan. Barbara Boxer, I)-Calif.,
said after the vote. "We turned our backs
on the veterans of this country, we turned
our backs on the lowest of the low, the
homeless people. We didn't have to do it."
"This bill eminently deserves the veto it
is going to get," said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.
