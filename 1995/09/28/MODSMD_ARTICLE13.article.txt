# Prosecutors outline Simpson's motive
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) Jurors
heard O.J. Simpson's fury and his
slain ex-wife's haunting plea dur
ing a 91 1 call: "().J., ().J. The kids
are sleeping," as a prosecutor used
Simpson's own voice against him
in dosing arguments yesterday.
Prosecutor Christopher I )arden
depicted the football 1 lall of Earner
as a spurned man, an obsessed ex
husband driven by inner demons
to kill.
"O.J. Simpson is a murderer,"
the prosecutor said bluntly. "You
have to look at all the evidence. . . .
You'll see that he did it and we
proved it. We proved it beyond a
reasonable doubt "
Harden focused on the violence
that erupted periodically during
the Simpsons relationship. Often
speaking so quietly he could barely
be heard, he described Simpson as
a time bomb, a man with a "short

fuse" that burned every day
toward the climactic moment
when he took up a knife and
released his rage.
He urged jurors to remember
the rage they heard on the 911
tapes and realize, "He's not the
person you see on those commer
cials and football games. That's a
public facade."
Jurors listened somberly as
Harden reminded them of the
story they had heard repeatedly, a
scenario of events leading to the
June 12, 1994, murders.
The prosecutor told of Simp
son's demeanor that day and sug
gested he had been spurned not
only by his ex-wife but by his girl
friend, Paula Barbieri, who left his
home after he declined to take her
along to his daughter's dance
recital.
At the recital, he said, Ms.

Simpson ignored him.
"He'd been rejected in public,"
Harden said, suggesting that was
what drove Simpson to devise a
plan for murder.
The only release for his sim
mering rage, Harden suggested,
was to take a knife and kill.
"He's in there one on one. The
hatred he has for her that night
flows out of him into t he knife and
into her," Harden said. "He kills
her and he kills Goldman in this
rage. . . . There was a gradual
release."
Harden pointed to what he
call<Kl "one of the most remarkable
things in this case," that after the
killings, the murderer's shoe prints
showed he did not run away.
"He didn't run. He didn't jog,"'
Harden said "He just walked
awav. He had released all that
anger."
