## Ranking priorities 
### 
FOR THE FIRST time in three
years, we're No. 4 — No. 4 in
the U.S. News & World Report
annual rankings, that is. Congratu
lations, Stanford.
We may not have the edge on
Harvard, Princeton or Yale — yet
but we can now claim to be the
proud superior of MIT and Caltech,
which have both been ranked high
er than Stanford in the past.
The University has done well for
itself. New programs created by the
admissions committee have not
only increased the freshman yield
rate by one percent, but also lurched
us forward in the rankings. Early
decision, a new prospective fresh
man program and a revised Presi
dential Scholars program have all
done their job.

But does that annual ranking
really mean anything?
Admittedly, the U.S. News &
World Report college issue is the
magazine's bestseller. Millions of
prospective freshman study it,
spending hours looking at the rat
ings. And certainly, the popular
magazine influences Stanford's
image.
However, the goal of Stanford
should not be to win percentage
points. The goal of Stanford should
be to give its students the best edu
cation available. Any sacrifice of this
objective for a measly few points is a
poor decision.
A ranking system which con
stantly changes its methodology,
even when read by millions, should
not be a priority for the University.
