# Picture imperfect

For freshmen, the
hoopla of orientation is over
as they settle down with
classes and activities. But what will
their lasting memories of the past
week be after they graduate? Per
haps as they flip through the fresh
man picture hook, they will be
reminded of the "welcome to Stan
ford" events and reminisce about
friends they made at the beginning
of their Stanford undergraduate
career.
Unfortunately, unlike the quali
ty of students, in the past few
years the standards of the fresh
man picture book has steadily
deteriorated. This year's picture
book contains some major errors.
Misspelling of names and losing
pictures are a problem for any pub
lication, but such errors have
appeared more frequently in this
year's issue. And how is it that this
year's picture book comes to have
last year's index? Perhaps it
should be viewed as an improve
ment because last year's picture
book was missing an index alto
gether.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn, who was an assis

tant on the project, explained that
there were particularly vexing cir
cumstances associated with this
year's production of the picture
book, the most damaging being that
Stanford is obligated to accept khe
lowest bidder on the picture book
contract. It seems the old adage
"caveat emptor" has once again
shown that you get what you pay for.
Still, it's not as if the books were
cheap. According to Dunn, it cost
over $10,000 and countless volun
teer hours to produce the picture
book. Unfortunately, switching
publishers caused unforeseen pro
duction delays.
Production schedule aside, the
main problem has been funding.
According to Dunn, New Student
Orientation used to have a staff
specifically assigned, rather than
"lent out," to the picture book.
Budget cuts have long since elimi
nated that "perk."
If money is the concern, howev
er, hopefully the New Student Ori
entation program learns from this
year's mistakes. Adding a few extra
dollars to the cost of Orientation
for a keepsake of some of life's best
years is probably worth it.
