Clinton urges students to protect the future of education

THIS IS a busy time for you. But
while you are choosing classes and
making decisions that will help
you build a good life for yourself, the
Congressional majority is working to
make drastic cuts in education — in your
student loans, in national service and
even in your scholarships. And the cuts
will jeopardize the future you and your
generation are working toward.
I want you to know that I oppose
tiheso cuts. I will do everything in my
pou'er to fight them and to see to it that
the dream of higher education remains
real for all Americans. I will do this not
only by defending the opportunities of
those of you who are already in college,
but bv opening the doors further to make
.sure that even greater numbers of
deserving Americans have the chance to
fjtand where you stand today.
For the first time in a long time, lead
ers from both parties are resolved that
We must balance the federal budget.
From the day I took office, I've been
committed to this goal — to getting rid of
the budget deficit that quadrupled our
national debt in the 12 years before I
came to Washington. So far, we have
made great progress. In three years, we
have cut the difficulty nearly in half,
Irom $290 billion to $160 billion.
Now we are ready to eliminate the
deficit entirely. On this, the Congres
sional majority and I see eye to eye.
But just how we get rid of t he deficit is
another matter. The majority in
Congress wants to balance the budget in
seven years, and do it while giving an

unnecessarily large tax cut. But in order
to do these things, the Congressional
majority would make enormous cuts in
education.
My balanced budget plan would take
more years than Congress' to eliminate
the deficit, but that's a small price to pay
to keep your scholarships, your student
loans and national service safe as well. It
would also preserve our ability to protect
the environment and the integrity of
Medicare for our older citizens.
Balancing the budget is about more
than numbers. It's about our values and
our future. Education has always been
the currency of the American Dream.
When I was your age, it was assumed —
based on our long history — that each
generation would have a better life than
the preceding one. More than anything
else, a good education is the way we pass
this vision on to those who come after us.
The facts speak for themselves. Earn
ings for those with no post-secondary
education have fallen substantially in
the last 15 years. The only people for
whom earnings have increased steadily
are people exactly like you — those
Americans with more education. Fverv
year of higher education increases your
earnings by six to 12 percent. Those
years also mean a strong overall econo
my and richer lives for those who have
them.
Balancing the budget will be good for
our economy and your future if it's done
right. But simply balancing the budget
won't do us much good in the long term
if your generation does not have the edu

cation it needs to meet the challenges of
the next century.
Just think of what the Congressional
majority's plan, if it passes the Senate in
its present form, would do to you, your
classmates and any of the one out of two
college students around you who
receives federal aid. It would:
1) Raise the cost of student loans by
$10 billion over a seven-year period by
charging you interest on your loan while
you are in school. This would increase
the cost of a college education bv as
much as $3,100 for undergraduates and
$9,400 for graduate students.
2) Deny up to 360,000 low-income
students who desperately needed Pell
Grants in 1996.
3) Shut down Americorps, our nation
al service initiative, which gives thou
sands of young people a year the chance
to earn and save money for college while
serving their country.
By contrast, my balanced budget plan
builds on the national consensus that we
must help people help themselves,
through the power of education. It can
eliminate both of our deficits: our budget
deficit and our education deficit. My plan
cuts wasteful spending by more than $1
trillion, hut it also increases investments
in education by $40 billion over the next
seven years.
Think over how my balanced budget
plan would help guaranty your future
and all the hard work you're about to put
into it. It will:
1) Increase funding for Pell Grants by
$3.4 billion, which would allow almost

one million more students to benefit
from the program.
2) Kxpand Americorps to let even
more young Americans serve their com
munities and go to college.
3) Protect our direct-lending pro
gram, which makes student loans more
affordable, with more repayment
options, and save taxpayers, parents and
students billions of dollars.
In taking on the responsibility of edu
cating yourselves, you have chosen the
right and difficult path. You did the work
you had to do to get into college. You
may be working now to pay your way.
And your family may have worked long
hours and made great sacrifices to help
you get where you are today.
You deserve the nation's support. And
your future success will likely repay our
common investment. I do not accept the
arguments of those who condemn irre
sponsibility in young Americans and
then seek to deny the nation's helping
hand to the millions of you who are
doing the right things.
I hope you'll support my efforts to
protect education and balance the bud
get. The fight for education is the fight
for your future. In my life — and the
lives of countless Americans — educa
tion has meant the difference between
the impossible and the possible. It
should be true in your lives, too. With
your help, we'll keep it that way.
