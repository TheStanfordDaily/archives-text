## Schwab gives a big boost to GSB housing 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
While the name Schwab may be more associated
with stocks and options than graduate housing, a do
nation fiom the well-known University trustee is
going to fund what will now be called I he Schwab Res
idential Center.
The Graduate School of Business housing project,
scheduled for completion in 19;y7, received a recent
boost from Stanford alumnus Charles Schwab and
his wife, 1 lelen. The building will cost $28.3 million,
not including $1 million in construction finance, ac
cording to Paul .Johnson, associate dean for adminis
tration at the Business School.

Johnson did not disclose the
amount of the Schwabs' donation,
but said buildings are usually named
after people who donate "a signifi
cant amount."
Charles Schwab got both his
bachelor's and MBA degrees from
Stanford and is the founder of
Charles Schwab Inc., a brokerage l
firm based in San Francisco.
The 280-room housing project,

complete with meeting rooms, lounges, a library,
computers, in-room computer connections and laun
dry and dining facilities, will house both participants
in the Business School's executive education pro
grams and graduate students. Groundbreaking for
the project will begin in January, said Keith Guy, di
rector of I lousing and Dining Services.
More than just a new building on campus, t he fa
cilitv will be a boon to the Business School, whose ex
ecutive education programs draw between 500 and
000 business executives every summer, said Cathy
Castillo, director of news and publications for the
Business School.
In the past, the executives were housed in under
graduate dormitories such as Lagunita Court, Flo
rence Moore I bill and Kimball I lall. Many of the pro
fessionals did not appreciate the living accommoda
t ions, according to Guy.
"While the food was wonderful, the executives
were disturbed" at having to walk down the hall to
use the communal bathrooms, he said.
"Particularly the women were unenthusiastic
about traipsing down the hall," said Business School
Dean Michael Spence.
Spence added that the dorms were especially un
comfortable in summer heat.
All the rooms will have air conditioning and pri
vate baths, with every two rooms sharing a kitch
enette.
The new 280-room facility will also provide more
latitude for executive education programs that occur
during the school year, Castillo said. In the past, pro
grain participants were housed in hotels when un
dergraduate housing was occupied.
"Executive education is a very important part of
what we do," Spence said.
"It's our way of understanding the problems
they're facing" in the business world, he said.
Accordingly, the Schwab Residential Center will
encourage business executives to come to Stanford by


Schwab
allowing them to stay on campus
in a facility comparable to those
at other top business schools,
Spence said.
In addition, the facility will
provide housing for graduate stu
dents during the course of the
school year, helping to "meet that

unmet demand," Johnson said.
"There is a campus-wide short
age of grad student housing," he
said. Of the 280 rooms, 220 will
house graduate students during
the school year and (SO will be set
aside for executives. Business
School students will have priority
over other graduate students,
Guy said.
While the proximity of t he new
building to the Business School
will certainly be convenient, some

students feel that having on-eam
pus accommodations will not
much improve the quality of
graduate student life.
"I think Stanford has a better
life" without dorm-room accom
modations, said Dan Enthoven, a
1995 Business School graduate.
"We gained by having houses.
There's such a strong off-campus
life — it's easier to throw dinner
parties and huge raging keg parties
in a house than in a dorm room."
