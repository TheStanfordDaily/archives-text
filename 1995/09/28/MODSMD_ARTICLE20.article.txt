## Sandeep Singhal Segregation between students at Stanford 
### 
STANFORD attracts
over 13,000 students
from around the
world, making it one ol the
most diverse aim puses in
the nation. Yet there is a
major dividing line that
segregates over half of its
students.
If you ask any Stanford

graduate student where the primary inter
est of the University lies, he or she is likely
to reply, "serving the needs of the under
graduate." Why might this ho? Outside
their academic work, graduate students
often feel ignored by both the administra
tion and student groups.
Graduate students have few opportuni
ties to meet students outside their depart
ment. Unlike undergraduates, whose
social lives center around their dorms,
roughly half of the graduate students live
off-campus. The University administra
tion has made no commitment to housing
all graduate students in the near future.
While programming in the graduate
residences fills the gap for a lot of graduate
students, these events clearly cannot ade
quately serve those living off-campus.
Graduate resident assistants (GRAs) are
paid a pittance for the time and effort they
spend to help build this graduate student
community.
One perpetual problem facing graduate
students is the lack of information they
receive about events happening around tin-
University. Public lectures, ethnic pro
grams and debates are almost never publi
cized outside the undergraduate dorms,
and when posters do make it "to t he world
outside Campus Drive," they are sparse
and poorly placed. And people wonder why
graduate students express no interest in

on-campus events?
Indeed, The Daily itself is also guilty of
ignoring graduate students. This is not
entirely unexpected. After all, The Daily is
m many ways a reflection of the rest of the
campus. Consider, for example, the "Wel
come to Stanford" issue of Friday, Sept.
22 In this giant 86-page issue, The Daily
neglected to mention graduate students
even once, even though there are more
new graduate students than freshmen. It
appears that The Daily simply forgot that
thousands of graduate students came to
campus last week.
The Daily's neglect for graduate stu
dents is even apparent when reference is
made to graduate studies. ()ne article men
tions the National Research Council's eval
uation of Ph.D. programs. Although this
ranking is of interest to graduate students,
The Daily's article buried the information
in the continuation page of the U.S. News
& World Report ranking of undergraduate
colleges and the graduate ranking is not
mentioned in Uig headline.
More examples? Why is there a story
about DR requirements changing next
year but no story about the upcoming end
of tuition remission (which helps to defray
the cost of graduate student tuition)? Why
is there mention of the new Dean of Stu
dents but no mention of the new Director
of Residential Education and Graduate
Residences? Why is there mention of the
renovation of Stern Hall and other under
graduate dorms but no mention of the con
tinuing Escondido Village renovations (or
the fact that the EV renovation schedule
has been stepped up)? Why are there mul
titudes of interviews with RAs but no
interviews with GRAs? Why does the
ASSU article discuss opportunities for
freshmen to be interns or senate associates

but not mention that first-year graduate
students can also get involved? Why is
there an article about freshman class
diversity but no mention of graduate stu
dent diversity? Why is there a full list of
freshman orientation activities but no
mention of graduate student welcome
activities or programs planned by the
Bechtel International ('enter?
(iraduate students might be interested
in learning that the off-campus housing
market this year is the tightest in a decade.
Or what about the fact that the Manzanita
Park trailers were being kept on campus
for another quarter to house some of the
huge number of graduate students left
unassigned this year, or construction of
the new graduate student housing has
been delayed for at least another year (and
maybe longer)?
Many administrators read The Daily as
a reflection of student opinions. Time and
time again, active reporting in the Daily
has proven to be a lightning rod for change.
Graduate students last year saw this after
The Daily reported apartment cleaning
problems ui Escondido Village. As long as
The Daily does not represent graduate stu
dent news, however, administrators can
continue to ignore the silent majority.
Of course, to make a difference, The
Daily must make a commitment to change
its reporting. It needs to make the difficult
decision to reach out to graduate students
and find out what is happening in the grad
uate community.
Does it have the courage?

Sandeep Sin glial is a graduate student in
computer science and is not as scary as he
looks. The Daily welcomes ami encour
ages more grad students to come and
write for the paper.
