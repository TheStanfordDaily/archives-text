of color.
"It has surprised people," said
Douglas Foster, director of Stanford
News Service, which publishes the
weekly paper now called Stanford

notice.
"We started thinking last year
that the newspaper has had the same
look for a couple of decades," he said.
"The main motivation was to make it
more readable."

The new title now appears across the front section
in color, in a different type face and in larger print.
Previously, it was tucked in the top left corner.
"We thought it would look a lot cleaner if the left
hand side of the page did not carry so much weight,"
he said.
Foster said the new format looks "more direct and
cleaner" when compared with the old. He added that

the new name will help external media outlets >i}ui
other outside subscribers more readily identify tin
paper with the University.

tions within the paper, giving news articles, ess;ry -
and profiles more distinguishable formats, he said
