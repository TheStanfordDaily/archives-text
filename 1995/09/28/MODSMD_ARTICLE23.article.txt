## Folkl on Farm for fall Status for basketball season remains uncertain 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Sometimes, making a big decision in life
comes down to a gut feeling. For sophomore
volleyball standout Kristin Folkl, that gut
feeling told her to return to Stanford, at least
for the fall quarter
Folkl, a two-sport athlete who last year
played volleyball in the fall and then joined
the women's basketball squad at the end of
the season, returns to Stanford after spend
ing the summer on tour with the United
States National Women's Volleyball team.
Kolkl had the option to remain with the
national team this fall, where she would vie
for a spot on next year's Olympic team.
The decision was not an easy one for the 6-
foot-2 outside hitter to make. "During the
decision process, I made a list of the pros and
the cons of both sides," Folkl said. "It turned
out that both seemed pretty equal. In the
end, I decided to rely on a gut feeling."
While Folkl has no regrets about her final
decision, she admitted to the difficulty of
reaching it. "Going on a gut feeling is some
what scary, since you're basing a big decision
on emotion."
When the volleyball season ends, there
will be another large decision for Folkl to
tackle. Once again, she will have to decide
whether to stay on the Farm or leave to
rejoin the national team, which will be train
ing in San Diego. That decision will affect
whether or not Folkl will be seen on the bas
ketball court in the winter. "If I leave in Jan
uary, obviously I won't be playing. If I stay
here, I'll still have to decide. Right now, I'm
really tired. That's something I'll decide in a
few months."
Folkl led last year's championship squad
in both kills and solo blocks and ranked sec
ond and fourth in aces and digs, respectively.

The highly touted freshman totaled a hitting
percentage of .350 for the season. As a prep at
St. Joseph's Academy in St. Louis, Folkl led
her volleyball team to a 94-match winning
streak, four state titles and a No. 2 year-end
national ranking. She also led the school's
basketball team to four consecutive state
championships and was named a First Team
Ail-American her senior year. Last year,
Folkl averaged 9.5 points and 5.5 rebounds
for Tara VanDerveer's women's basketball
team, which advanced to the NCAA Final
Four.
After earning First Team All-American
honors as a freshman last year and helping
the Cardinal win its second NCAA volleyball
crown in the past three years, Folkl has
accomplished more than most manage in an
entire career. But defining her priorities led
to Folkl's remaining at Stanford.
"[The option to return to] school is always
going to be there, but the national team is
always going to be there too," Folkl said. "It's
really a matter of what your priorities are.
Right now, school is my top priority."
Helping the Cardinal defend its national
title is another top priority for bust year's Vol
leyball Magazine National Freshman of the
Year. Since returning to the squad earlier
this weok, Folkl says practices have been
rough as she gets reaccustomed to the style of
game the Cardinal favors.
"It should take a week tops to get used to
being back and for the team to get used to me
being back," Folkl said. "We're fortunate
that this team is very adaptable Right now, 1
have to get used to their sets and they have to
find where I want the ball. They have a
tougher job because setting is hard. They're
great setters though, so it won't be much of a
problem."

Sophomore Kristin Folkl airs it out on an innocent opponent in a game against Villanova last season. Folkl is bring
ing her elevation act back to the Farm in 1995.
Throughout the decision pro
cess, Folkl found support and
encouragement from her team
mates as well as Cardinal head
coach Don Shaw. "From the
start, I felt that my teammates
really supported me," Folkl said.
"1 really appreciated that. 1
know lots of teams wouldn't

have been that way It's almost
like I am being selfish, tolling
them "Phis is what I'm going to
do ' But they're groat people II
they have minded, I haven't Celt
it."
Shaw acted as an adviser to
his sophomore star without
adding pressure to Folkl's diffi
cult situation. "The decision
involved him from the start
it's his program," Folkl said
"He always supported me and
didn't try to swa\ me one way or

the other. 1 appreciated that and
I fee! very lucky."
For the rest of the Pacific 10
('(inference and the nation's
finest women's volleyball teams,
Folkl's return to the Cardinal
may seem like an unlucky break.
Stanford, No. 1 in the season's
opening polls, powered to a vic
tory over current No. 1 Nebras
ka without Folkl's services.
After dropping a pair of matches,
the Cardinal (8-2) is currently
ranked No. 4 in the nation.
