# Cardinal success depending on its specialties
## Return team, kicking game highlight big victories at Oregon, San Jose State 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
One way to become a special team is to field
great special teams. En route to its first season
opening, undefeated month since 1986, the Cardi
nal kicking and coverage units have made the big
plays — the ones that often went the other way in
years past.
As Stanford (3-0-1, 1-0 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) moved into the polls for the first time
since the 1994 preseason at No. 22, senior Marlon
Evans made his first trip to the top of the NCAA
leaderboard in kickoff returns. The backup wide
receiver gave Stanford the lead it would never

We believe in each other and we
believe in our coach. We're very
confident that if we play well, we
can beat anyone we play. I didn't
think that 3-0-1 was that far out of
the realm of possibility. I wish we
were 4-0 actually.
— Eric Abrams

relinquish in last week's upset of then-No. 13
Oregon with a 96-yard kickoff return.
"Marlon Evans' kickoff return basically took
the momentum away from them," said senior
kicker Eric Abrams, another fine special teamer.
"They had just tied the score, and people might
have been starting to doubt what was going to
happen. That immediately gave us the momen
tum back."
The runback boosted Evans' average to an
astronomical 46.0 yards per return. Not to be out
done, Evans' backup at wide receiver, sophomore
Damon Dunn, holds down the second spot in the
Pac-10 and ranks sixth in the nation.
Dunn, who led (he conference in the category
last year, has returned six kickoffs for 194 yards
(a 32.3 average) in 1995, including his second
career kick-return touchdown, a 91-yarder at San
Jose State. Never before in Stanford's history had
the Cardinal registered two kickoff-return scores
in one season.
According to Evans, the special teams' excel-

lence has extended beyond spec
tacular kick returns.
"Eric Abrams has been kick
ing real well," Evans said.
"We've blocked two punts and
we've taken two kickoffs back
for touchdowns. We look at spe
cial teams as another way of
making plays. We put in the time
to make sure -t4:at we beat the
other team in special teams."
After struggling through the
prior two campaigns, Abrams
has rebounded to the form he
displayed in his freshman year of
1992, when he buried 16 of 20
field goal attempts. After land
ing in former coach Bill Walsh's
doghouse late last season by
going 9 for 18 while suffering
from nagging injuries, the now
healthy senior has converted five
of six tries this season (including
a 50-yarder), with the only miss
coming on a block.
".Just getting a new lease on
life with the coaching change
and a fresh slate was a big factor
for me," Abrams said. "I've
always had confidence in my
abilities, but it was kind of sti
lled last year. I would say that I
am extra-confident this year."
Abrams' 7.5 points per game
ranks third in the Pac-10, as do
his five field goals. He has also
drilled all 15 point-after-touch
downs (except for a blocked try
in the opener against the Spar
tans). His 30 points tie senior
running back Greg Cornelia for
the team lead.
While the Cardinal has put
points on the board with its spe
cial teams, Stanford has not
allowed opponents to recipro
cate. San Jose State, Utah, Wis
consin and Oregon have com
bined for only 18.1 yards per
kickoff return, barely half of

Stanford's phenomenal total. Emerging sopho
more star Chris Draft and senior Kwame Ellis
both have registered kick blocks to thwart scoring
threats and give Mark Butterfield and the Stan
ford offense excellent field position.
"The players that we have on the team like

(ire# Cornelia, Adam Salina, Derek Hubbard,
Damon McDougal — these are all guys who pla>
offense and defense and star for us," Evans said
"I just think that the caliber of players that we
