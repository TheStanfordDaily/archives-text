# Cardinal success depending on its specialties
## Return team, kicking game highlight big victories at Oregon, San Jose State 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
One way to become a special team is to field
great special teams. En route to its first season
opening, undefeated month since 1986, the Cardi
nal kicking and coverage units have made the big
plays — the ones that often went the other way in
years past.
As Stanford (3-0-1, 1-0 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) moved into the polls for the first time
since the 1994 preseason at No. 22, senior Marlon
Evans made his first trip to the top of the NCAA
leaderboard in kickoff returns. The backup wide
receiver gave Stanford the lead it would never

We believe in each other and we
believe in our coach. We're very
confident that if we play well, we
can beat anyone we play. I didn't
think that 3-0-1 was that far out of
the realm of possibility. I wish we
were 4-0 actually.
— Eric Abrams

relinquish in last week's upset of then-No. 13
Oregon with a 96-yard kickoff return.
"Marlon Evans' kickoff return basically took
the momentum away from them," said senior
kicker Eric Abrams, another fine special teamer.
"They had just tied the score, and people might
have been starting to doubt what was going to
happen. That immediately gave us the momen
tum back."
The runback boosted Evans' average to an
astronomical 46.0 yards per return. Not to be out
done, Evans' backup at wide receiver, sophomore
Damon Dunn, holds down the second spot in the
Pac-10 and ranks sixth in the nation.
Dunn, who led (he conference in the category
last year, has returned six kickoffs for 194 yards
(a 32.3 average) in 1995, including his second
career kick-return touchdown, a 91-yarder at San
Jose State. Never before in Stanford's history had
the Cardinal registered two kickoff-return scores
in one season.
According to Evans, the special teams' excel-

lence has extended beyond spec
tacular kick returns.
"Eric Abrams has been kick
ing real well," Evans said.
"We've blocked two punts and
we've taken two kickoffs back
for touchdowns. We look at spe
cial teams as another way of
making plays. We put in the time
to make sure -t4:at we beat the
other team in special teams."
After struggling through the
prior two campaigns, Abrams
has rebounded to the form he
displayed in his freshman year of
1992, when he buried 16 of 20
field goal attempts. After land
ing in former coach Bill Walsh's
doghouse late last season by
going 9 for 18 while suffering
from nagging injuries, the now
healthy senior has converted five
of six tries this season (including
a 50-yarder), with the only miss
coming on a block.
".Just getting a new lease on
life with the coaching change
and a fresh slate was a big factor
for me," Abrams said. "I've
always had confidence in my
abilities, but it was kind of sti
lled last year. I would say that I
am extra-confident this year."
Abrams' 7.5 points per game
ranks third in the Pac-10, as do
his five field goals. He has also
drilled all 15 point-after-touch
downs (except for a blocked try
in the opener against the Spar
tans). His 30 points tie senior
running back Greg Cornelia for
the team lead.
While the Cardinal has put
points on the board with its spe
cial teams, Stanford has not
allowed opponents to recipro
cate. San Jose State, Utah, Wis
consin and Oregon have com
bined for only 18.1 yards per
kickoff return, barely half of

Stanford's phenomenal total. Emerging sopho

threats and give Mark Butterfield and the Stan

In the punting game, Stan
ford has provided consistency if
not fireworks. Sophomore
Kevin Miller, the new punter
charged with filling the shoes of
graduated Aaron Mills, has
responded to the challenge,
averaging a consistent 38.4
yards per punt with minimal
return yardage. Dunn's 9.4-
yard average returning punts
stands seventh in the league. In
short, after suffering two
blocked kicks against the Spar
tans in the opener, the Cardinal
special teams have performed
flawlessly.

the forefront should come as lit
tle surprise. New head coach

first Stanford coach without a

Chuck Taylor in 1951, coached

88
One of the last members to
join Willingham's staff at Stan
ford, special teams coach Phil
Zacharias, headed the special

in 1987. Their no-nonsense
approach has won the players'
respect on both sides of the ball
and, obviously, in the kicking
games.
Abrams, for one, is not over

lence has extended beyond spec
tacular kick returns.
"Eric Abrams has been kick
ing real well," Evans said.
"We've blocked two punts and
we've taken two kickoffs back
for touchdowns. We look at spe
cial teams as another way of
making plays. We put in the time
to make sure -t4:at we beat the
other team in special teams."
After struggling through the
prior two campaigns, Abrams
has rebounded to the form he
displayed in his freshman year of
1992, when he buried 16 of 20
field goal attempts. After land
ing in former coach Bill Walsh's
doghouse late last season by
going 9 for 18 while suffering
from nagging injuries, the now
healthy senior has converted five
of six tries this season (including
a 50-yarder), with the only miss
coming on a block.
".Just getting a new lease on
life with the coaching change
and a fresh slate was a big factor
for me," Abrams said. "I've
always had confidence in my
abilities, but it was kind of sti
lled last year. I would say that I
am extra-confident this year."
Abrams' 7.5 points per game
ranks third in the Pac-10, as do
his five field goals. He has also
drilled all 15 point-after-touch
downs (except for a blocked try
in the opener against the Spar
tans). His 30 points tie senior
running back Greg Cornelia for
the team lead.
While the Cardinal has put
points on the board with its spe
cial teams, Stanford has not
allowed opponents to recipro
cate. San Jose State, Utah, Wis
consin and Oregon have com
bined for only 18.1 yards per
kickoff return, barely half of

Stanford's phenomenal total. Emerging sopho
more star Chris Draft and senior Kwame Ellis
both have registered kick blocks to thwart scoring
threats and give Mark Butterfield and the Stan

After a disappointing season last year, senior placekicker Eric
Abrams is once again kicking up big numbers for the 22nd-ranked
Cardinal.
have out there is one of the rea
sons why we're doing so well.
There are some second- or
third-string guys, but we have
the starters out there [on spe
cial teams 1."
In the punting game, Stan
ford has provided consistency if
not fireworks. Sophomore
Kevin Miller, the new punter
charged with filling the shoes of
graduated Aaron Mills, has
responded to the challenge,
averaging a consistent 38.4
yards per punt with minimal
return yardage. Dunn's 9.4-
yard average returning punts
stands seventh in the league. In
short, after suffering two
blocked kicks against the Spar
tans in the opener, the Cardinal
special teams have performed
flawlessly.
The rise of special teams to
the forefront should come as lit
tle surprise. New head coach
Tyrone Willingham, now the
first Stanford coach without a
loss in his first four games since
Chuck Taylor in 1951, coached
special teams ;it Michigan
State, North Carolina State and
Rice for nine years, from 1980-
88
One of the last members to
join Willingham's staff at Stan
ford, special teams coach Phil
Zacharias, headed the special
teams unit at Morehead State
in 1987. Their no-nonsense
approach has won the players'
respect on both sides of the ball
and, obviously, in the kicking
games.
Abrams, for one, is not over
whelmed by the squad's unbeat
en start.
"We believe in each other
and we believe in our coach,"
Abrams said. "We're very confi
dent that if we play well, we can
beat anyone we play. I didn't
really think that 3-0-1 was that
far out of the realm of possibili
ty. I wish we were 4-0, actual
ly."
Not surprisingly, Evans feels
the same way.
"I don't think |the fast start |
surprises me or any of my team
mates," Evans said. "We're just
happy to be on top of our con
ference right now, but we have
loftier goals of playing on Jan
ua'-7 1."
