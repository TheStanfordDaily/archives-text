# Women runners hope to trounce No. 5 Arkansas
## 
### Matt Miller 
There is no need to dive under a desk or
brace yourself' in a doorway. It is not the big
one. That rumble in the ground you hear this
Saturday will merely be the pounding feet of
more than 4,000 runners competing for top
honors in the 22nd annual Stanford University
Cross Country Invitational, the biggest college
meet on the West Coast.
The Stanford women's cross country team is
excited about its first home meet as it prepares
to negotiate the 5,000 meter race at the Stan
ford Golf Course. The Cardinal opened the sea
son with a victory in Mammoth Lakes and a sec
ond-place finish at the Washington Invitational
in Seattle, but the Invitational will be the first
race in which everyone on the team will run
and, in head coach Vin Lananna's opinion, is
"the real opening weekend" to the cross coun
try season. In the team's first two meets,
Lananna ran a young squad, hoping to give his
stellar freshman athletes some experience
before this weekend.
"This is a very big race for our team," said
freshman phenom Mary Cobb, who began her
collegiate career with an individual victory in
Seattle. "It is the first time that the whole team
will be running. It is also an important meet
because of the home-field advantage."
That "home-field advantage" may be a mis
nomer, as the Cardinal team returned from
Mammoth Lakes less than two weeks ano and
has only trained on the golf
course twice. However, Lananna
likes what he sees from his team.
"The women have been very suc
cessful on this course," he said.
"It is more of a finesse course
than a strength course and we
have good distance runners as
well as strong milers."
Lananna will run eight run
ners in the group A Open classifi
cation. Freshmen Cobb, Cara
Aley and Kristina Betzold will
join sophomore sensations Kort
ney Dunscombe and Sarna Ren
fro. The leadership of the team is
expected to come from junior cap
tain Ann Sheehy and juniors
Monal Chokshi and Leila Burr.
Chokshi, defending Pacific 10
Conference champion in the
3,000 meters, expects a strong
performance from her teammates
and herself. "We are all excited
about having everyone run," she
said. "We're going to try to win
we win do it if everyone is up for it
and ready to go.
The team's level of enthusiasm
is only matched by the level of com
petition. The Cardinal squad, cur
rently ranked seventh in the
nation, must contend against No. 5
Arkansas, No. 29 Missouri and No.
30 UC-Irvine. In all. 123 colleges
and universities will compete.
"The women's race will be very
exciting," Lananna said. "Our top
kids will have to break up
Arkansas' (op kids. If that can
happen, I think we stand a very
good chance of knocking them
