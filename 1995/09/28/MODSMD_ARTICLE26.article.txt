# Men's running 'machine' set for Invitational
## 
### Matt Miller 
The machine.
To sophomore Matt Farley, that is a much
more appropriate moniker for the Stanford
men's cross country team than the tradition
al Cardinal.
"We started calling ourselves 'The
Machine' last year," Farley said. "We feel
that we are each a vital part â€” individual
cogs that make the whole thing go."
The machine will be tested at this week
end's Stanford Invitational, the 22nd edition
of the biggest cross country meet on the West
Coast.
The talent-laden Cardinal team will face
stiff competition from top-25 powers UCLA,
Missouri and Texas, as well as traditional
rival California. Also running this weekend
will be Northern Arizona, who captured the
Big Sky Conference title last year and fin
ished fourth at the NCAAs. The Lumberjacks
return six of their top seven runners from
that squad, but Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna feels his charges have a good chance
to win the meet if they run a smart, conser
vative race over the Stanford Golf Course's
8,000 meter course.
"Unlike with the women's team, we need
to keep a small gap between our runners and
run in a solid group," Lananna said.
