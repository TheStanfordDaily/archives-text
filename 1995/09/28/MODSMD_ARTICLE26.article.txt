# Men's running 'machine' set for Invitational
## 
### Matt Miller 
The machine.
To sophomore Matt Farley, that is a much
more appropriate moniker for the Stanford
men's cross country team than the tradition
al Cardinal.
"We started calling ourselves 'The
Machine' last year," Farley said. "We feel
that we are each a vital part — individual
cogs that make the whole thing go."
The machine will be tested at this week
end's Stanford Invitational, the 22nd edition
of the biggest cross country meet on the West
Coast.
The talent-laden Cardinal team will face
stiff competition from top-25 powers UCLA,
Missouri and Texas, as well as traditional
rival California. Also running this weekend
will be Northern Arizona, who captured the
Big Sky Conference title last year and fin
ished fourth at the NCAAs. The Lumberjacks
return six of their top seven runners from
that squad, but Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna feels his charges have a good chance
to win the meet if they run a smart, conser
vative race over the Stanford Golf Course's
8,000 meter course.
"Unlike with the women's team, we need
to keep a small gap between our runners and
run in a solid group," Lananna said.
T his will be the third meet ol
the year for the Cardinal, but
the first time that Lananna will
run his entire lineup. Co-cap
tain and junior star Greg Jim
merson will headline the team's
group A runners, which include
fellow juniors J.J.White, Bryan
Zmijiewski and Dave Dyer, and
senior Mark Fadil.
Stanford's youth movement
makes up the remainder of
group A: Farley, sophomore
Nathan Nutter and the duo that
will have many an opponent see
ing double this year. Brent and
Brad Hauser, tin 1 fabulous
freshman twins from Texas.
The Stanford Invitational is
the first big meet of the year and
will be an important litmus test
for the Cardinal runners.
"I like to call this the real
opening weekend of t he season,"
Lananna said. "It is a good
opportunity to identify our
strengths and weaknesses as a
team. The first two meets of the
year I like to consider practice
meets."
Not lost on Stanford's
"machine" was the importance
of spending three weeks train
ing in Mammoth Lakes prior to
the Invitational. The town's ele
vation of 7,500 feet helped build
the runners endurance and the
time together developed the
team unity that is so important
in cross country.
"Unity is important," Farley
said. "There is an adage in cross
country that you are only as

good as vour fifth runner."
The scores in cross country
are compiled by counting the
overall finishing place of each
team's top five runners. Thus, a
team could have the top four

finishers and nevertheless fin
ish last.
However, with the talent on
this team, finishing last won't
b«' a concern for the Stanford
Machine.
