# Delts to lose house at end of quarter
## Administrators cite 'management issues' in decision 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity will lose
its house at (lie end of fall quarter and its
members will hi' forced to live elsewhere,
University officials said yesterday.
The house, located at 353 Campus Drive

and consisting of 27 two
room doubles, will be avail
able as a coed self-operating
house for students on the
winter quarter waiting li.st,
said Residential Education
Director .Jane Camarillo. A
st ndent staff will I*- hired to
run the facility.
Delt members were in
formed of the decision by

the Office of Student Activities in a letter
dated Tuesday and signed by Camarillo and
Dean of Students Marc Lee Wais.
"The circumstances dictated this deci
sion," Wais said yesterday. "Over the years,
they have been notified formally in writing
to remedy the problems. They simply
haven't been able to do that."
He cited three reasons for the abrupt do

cision: significant debts the Delts owe the
University, behavioral problems and what
Wais termed "management issues." The de
cision to evict the Delts was made chiefly bv
Wais and Camarillo, both new Stanford ad
ministrators.
The fraternity was the subject of a formal
investigation by Student Activities in Janu
ary for what Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe called "poor house manage
ment." However, the University decided in
March to allow the Delts to maintain the fa
cility under certain conditions, most of
which dealt with responsibility issues.
The invest igation was prompted by many
incidents in recent years, the most memo
rable of which occured when a Delt member
drove a golf cart through one of the house's
windows last year.
Currently, the Delts owe $41,000 to the
University with an additional $76,000 in fall
quarter rent fees due Oct. 13, Camarillo said.
The review committee, Camarillo said,
"took a pretty hard stance. They said, 'This
is an opportunity to redeem yourself.' What
I'm doing is finding that they're not in com-
