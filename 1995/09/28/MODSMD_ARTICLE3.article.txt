# Delts to lose house at end of quarter
## Administrators cite 'management issues' in decision 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity will lose
its house at (lie end of fall quarter and its
members will hi' forced to live elsewhere,
University officials said yesterday.
The house, located at 353 Campus Drive

and consisting of 27 two
room doubles, will be avail
able as a coed self-operating
house for students on the
winter quarter waiting li.st,
said Residential Education
Director .Jane Camarillo. A
st ndent staff will I*- hired to
run the facility.
Delt members were in
formed of the decision by

the Office of Student Activities in a letter
dated Tuesday and signed by Camarillo and
Dean of Students Marc Lee Wais.
"The circumstances dictated this deci
sion," Wais said yesterday. "Over the years,
they have been notified formally in writing
to remedy the problems. They simply
haven't been able to do that."
He cited three reasons for the abrupt do

cision: significant debts the Delts owe the
University, behavioral problems and what
Wais termed "management issues." The de
cision to evict the Delts was made chiefly bv
Wais and Camarillo, both new Stanford ad
ministrators.
The fraternity was the subject of a formal
investigation by Student Activities in Janu
ary for what Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe called "poor house manage
ment." However, the University decided in
March to allow the Delts to maintain the fa
cility under certain conditions, most of
which dealt with responsibility issues.
The invest igation was prompted by many
incidents in recent years, the most memo
rable of which occured when a Delt member
drove a golf cart through one of the house's
windows last year.
Currently, the Delts owe $41,000 to the
University with an additional $76,000 in fall
quarter rent fees due Oct. 13, Camarillo said.
The review committee, Camarillo said,
"took a pretty hard stance. They said, 'This
is an opportunity to redeem yourself.' What
I'm doing is finding that they're not in com-


Wais
pliance with those conditions."
Ultimately, fraternity mem
bers' attempts to meet the condi
tions proved unsuccessful when,
m a meeting last week, Delts
admitted that they failed to meet
the imposed guidelines necessary
to retain their house, Camarillo
said.
Although residential changes
in fraternity houses normally
occur at the beginning of spring
quarter, Wais emphasized that
the reason for the unprecedented
timing of the decision is the Delts'
long history of problems.
"If one looks at the overall
record of the fraternity, it has
been an ongoing process for a
number of years," Wais said.

"People are going to be held
accountable for their actions."
Delt members will receive ran
dom placement on the winter
quarter housing waiting list,
Camarillo said. However, they will
not be allowed to live at their cur
rent residence.
Despite the announcement,
Wais said he is committed to
Greek life on campus. Hut he
admitted that when he started as
dean Sept. 17, he was surprised
the fraternity had not been evict
ed sooner due to the "compelling"
circumstances. "I'm surprised it
took the University this long to
take action," he said.
The news was not received well
by members of the Delt fraternity,
most of whom, Delt President
Mark Lippert said, could not com
ment without clearance from the
Athletics Department. The large
majority of Delt members belong

to varsity athletic teams.
"We'll know more about it"
later in the week, said Lippert,
one of the few Delt members who
is not a varsity athlete. The Delts
plan to meet today with both Stu
dent Activities and the Athletics
Department, he said.
Trey Stolz, a member of the
Sigma Alpha Kpsilon fraternity
and president of the Interfraterni
ty Council, said the decision by
Student Activities is another bar
rier between fraternities and the
University. Last year, both the
Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta Pi
fraternities lost their houses due
to lack of membership.
Wais, however, is confident
that the Delts will reclaim their
house in the future.
"We hope the fraternity will be
able to re-collect itself and come
back," he said. "It is still a recog
nized fraternity."
