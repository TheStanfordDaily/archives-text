When (luru talks about the band he's on
the road with, he's talking about fami
ly. 1 lis personal fusion of hip-hop and
jazz isn't just kicking the latest groove, but
creating a fusion of generations.
"Black families have been divided
throughout history," Guru said in an inter
view from his hotel room on a tour stop in
Minneapolis. Fventhough none of the mem
bers of his current touring band are related to
him, he still talks about them .is if they were
relatives. " The family I got now is real tight,
(iuru says in Ins gravelly, deep voice. "Night
after night they're getting better and better."
So too does Guru's rap place a focus on
family and unity with none of the slang
words that arc normally associated with the
genre.
"I've taken rap to another level— it repre
sents family, represents unity, represents a di
alogue between generations," he says.
lor example, on the intro track of his
newest album, (iuru raps, "I or too long / the
black family structure has been systematical
ly divided. .. . I'm talkin' about a 360 degree
mind revolution."
Rappin' and reason

members having to perform during I li.inks
giving celebrations at his grandparents'
house.
"When we were kids, our parents exposed
us to a lot ol reading, creative writing and

But when rap came 011 the scene, C.uru
found something that was hitting a vibe his
lainilv was unable to give him. I laced a lot
of st 1111 in the street,'' (iuru savs, describing
his youth in Boston's Roxburv district. Mis
house was across from the projects, and
(iuru saiil he "got 111 a lot of trouble and hurt
my family a little.
"Rap for me was almost like a therapy,"
(iuru says. His parents were unable to com

"My father was saying I was going to be a

stuff that really pushed me."
It was when two cousins, a Harvard stu
dent and a student at Boston University,
came to live 111 his house in Boston that (iuru
found some people with whom he could

communicate. "They talked to me 111 a way
that my parents didn't," Guru says. "They
helped me get back on the right track.'
Breaks in the Big City
With his cousins' help, (iuru eventually
decided to go to Atlanta's Morehouse
College. His rapping began in Ins
summers home from school, when Guru
would record demo tapes. But the music
business offered no easy breaks. After seeing
other Boston grown musicians like Bobby
Brown and New Fdition leave for New York,
(iuru followed their lead and headed for the
Big Apple.
I le didn't make it big on the scene at first.
After arriving in New York, (iuru found em
ployment as a case worker for young people
in jail and foster children, from the experi
ence, Guru has taken his moral bent to re
unite the masses under .1 new musical flag. In
"I ilesaver," the second track on Jazzmatazz's
second album, (iuru steps straight into his
role-model role. "Our kids are lost / we must
strive for essential gains," he raps. "I've come
to give direction / for I / am the lifesaver."
On "Skit A," ( iuru tackles the issue even
more directly. 111 response toan interviewer's
question as to whether rappers are role mod
els, (iiiru says,"I believe that if there are peo
ple following mv music and listening to me,
then I 'in responsible. Doesn't mean I'm per
fect. You know, I 111 human.
I le shopped around demos until he flnal
l\ got his break 111 the mid-1980s with
Gangstarr, his first group. The rap artists
making it big at that time, like D| |a//v left
and the I resh Prince and Stetsasonic, were .ill
experimenting with elements of jazz. "All
those people using 70s funk it was like
where are we going to go with that, Guru
s.i\s. It was a natural progression for hip
hop to go in.
I lis big break came after Spike I ee noticed
Gangstarr's first video and decided to use
one ol then tracks along with Bradford
Marsalis' sa\ in his film, "Mo' Better
Blues."
Alter touring both in the United States
and I urope, < iuru decided to branch out on
a solo project that would incorporate more
jazz into Ins rap. lazzmatazz came out of the
idea to get all the most sampled people into
the studio to lay down their own tracks, (iuru
explains.
The jazz greats of today weren't always
playing straight ahead stuff. "In the '70s,
they weren't playing to jazz, they were play
ing to funk," (iuru sa\ s. "Why shouldn't they
be playing to hip-hop now?"
I lie legendary trumpeter Donald Byrd
was the first to sign on, and after that "the rest
was a domino effect," (luru says.
Jazzmatazzin'
Hip-hop, be bop — it's all the same
thing," (iuru says.

(iuru's second effort with lazzmatazz,
"Volume II: The New Reality,' isn't just a
album, but a jam session of all kinds of jazz
and hip-hop artists, hosted by Guru. Guru's
album credits read like the cast list to a
Robert Altman flick — including jazz greats
Branford Marsalis and Freddie Hubbard,
and also up and coming stars Me-shell
N'degeocello, Jamiroquai and lni Kamoze.
In true jazz spirit. Guru doesn't write his
lyrics until he gets into the studio with the
artists. " That's where I learn more about
music," he says.
For his live shows, (iuru said that he tries
to keep the same spirit of improvisation alive,
lust back from a tour of jazz festivals in Fu
rope that included the Montreaux |az/ festi
val, the sound is getting more jazzy, more
live. IheDJ is still the maestro," (iuru says,
but he lets able musicians Donald Byrd, sax
ophonist and tintist Derrick Davis, key
boardist Ruben Wilson, guitarist Zachary
Breux or drummer Willie McNeil open up
when they want to, laying back on the rap for
a chorus or two.

I he album design on both of Jazzmatazz's
covers is an imitation of the standard Blue
Note design. Does Guru think he's the new
Blue Note or is hip-hop the new jazz?
"In the cadences of the jazz beat you can
hear the similarities," Guru says, snapping
back at any comparisons between him and
something redone. "The beat is thicker in rap
— just way heavier."
Hip-hop and jazz come full circle in
(iuru's world.
"1 bstory repeats itself," Guru says.

Guru's cool comes to campus.
WRITTEN BY )BURT HERMAN

When (luru talks about the band he's on
the road with, he's talking about fami
ly. 1 lis personal fusion of hip-hop and
jazz isn't just kicking the latest groove, but
creating a fusion of generations.
"Black families have been divided
throughout history," Guru said in an inter
view from his hotel room on a tour stop in
Minneapolis. Fventhough none of the mem
bers of his current touring band are related to
him, he still talks about them .is if they were
relatives. " The family I got now is real tight,
(iuru says in Ins gravelly, deep voice. "Night
after night they're getting better and better."
So too does Guru's rap place a focus on
family and unity with none of the slang
words that arc normally associated with the
genre.
"I've taken rap to another level— it repre
sents family, represents unity, represents a di
alogue between generations," he says.
lor example, on the intro track of his
newest album, (iuru raps, "I or too long / the
black family structure has been systematical
ly divided. .. . I'm talkin' about a 360 degree
mind revolution."
Rappin' and reason
In person, (iuru is just as political. "The
politici.ins want to build more prisons and
they want to stop gangsta rap, but they
don't want to spend money on communi
ties," (iuru says."I feel like il they would real
Iv listen, llic\ could see that these rappers are
giving them warning signals.
"II they want to shut us down, it's gonna
i a use *. haos.
(iuru, whose real name is Keith I lam, is
brother to Stanford 1 >rama Associate I'roles
sot I lan \ I lam. I rom a young age, (iuru re
members having to perform during I li.inks
giving celebrations at his grandparents'
house.
"When we were kids, our parents exposed
us to a lot ol reading, creative writing and
stull," (iuru says.
But when rap came 011 the scene, C.uru
found something that was hitting a vibe his
lainilv was unable to give him. I laced a lot
of st 1111 in the street,'' (iuru savs, describing
his youth in Boston's Roxburv district. Mis
house was across from the projects, and
(iuru saiil he "got 111 a lot of trouble and hurt
my family a little.
"Rap for me was almost like a therapy,"
(iuru says. His parents were unable to com
municatc with him about the things that
were happening 111 his life. "I didn't really
have an outlet to disc uss it with them," (luru
says. "When |mv father| came home, he
wanted peace and quiet.
"My father was saying I was going to be a
bum," (iuru explains. "I look at it now as
stuff that really pushed me."
It was when two cousins, a Harvard stu
dent and a student at Boston University,
came to live 111 his house in Boston that (iuru
found some people with whom he could

communicate. "They talked to me 111 a way
that my parents didn't," Guru says. "They
helped me get back on the right track.'
Breaks in the Big City
With his cousins' help, (iuru eventually
decided to go to Atlanta's Morehouse
College. His rapping began in Ins
summers home from school, when Guru
would record demo tapes. But the music
business offered no easy breaks. After seeing
other Boston grown musicians like Bobby
Brown and New Fdition leave for New York,
(iuru followed their lead and headed for the
Big Apple.
I le didn't make it big on the scene at first.
After arriving in New York, (iuru found em
ployment as a case worker for young people
in jail and foster children, from the experi
ence, Guru has taken his moral bent to re
unite the masses under .1 new musical flag. In
"I ilesaver," the second track on Jazzmatazz's
second album, (iuru steps straight into his
role-model role. "Our kids are lost / we must
strive for essential gains," he raps. "I've come
to give direction / for I / am the lifesaver."
On "Skit A," ( iuru tackles the issue even
more directly. 111 response toan interviewer's
question as to whether rappers are role mod
els, (iiiru says,"I believe that if there are peo
ple following mv music and listening to me,
then I 'in responsible. Doesn't mean I'm per
fect. You know, I 111 human.
I le shopped around demos until he flnal
l\ got his break 111 the mid-1980s with
Gangstarr, his first group. The rap artists
making it big at that time, like D| |a//v left
and the I resh Prince and Stetsasonic, were .ill
experimenting with elements of jazz. "All
those people using 70s funk it was like
where are we going to go with that, Guru
s.i\s. It was a natural progression for hip
hop to go in.
I lis big break came after Spike I ee noticed
Gangstarr's first video and decided to use
one ol then tracks along with Bradford
Marsalis' sa\ in his film, "Mo' Better
Blues."
Alter touring both in the United States
and I urope, < iuru decided to branch out on
a solo project that would incorporate more
jazz into Ins rap. lazzmatazz came out of the
idea to get all the most sampled people into
the studio to lay down their own tracks, (iuru
explains.
The jazz greats of today weren't always
playing straight ahead stuff. "In the '70s,
they weren't playing to jazz, they were play
ing to funk," (iuru sa\ s. "Why shouldn't they
be playing to hip-hop now?"
I lie legendary trumpeter Donald Byrd
was the first to sign on, and after that "the rest
was a domino effect," (luru says.
Jazzmatazzin'
Hip-hop, be bop — it's all the same
thing," (iuru says.

(iuru's second effort with lazzmatazz,
"Volume II: The New Reality,' isn't just a
album, but a jam session of all kinds of jazz
and hip-hop artists, hosted by Guru. Guru's
album credits read like the cast list to a
Robert Altman flick — including jazz greats
Branford Marsalis and Freddie Hubbard,
and also up and coming stars Me-shell
N'degeocello, Jamiroquai and lni Kamoze.
In true jazz spirit. Guru doesn't write his
lyrics until he gets into the studio with the
artists. " That's where I learn more about
music," he says.
For his live shows, (iuru said that he tries
to keep the same spirit of improvisation alive,
lust back from a tour of jazz festivals in Fu
rope that included the Montreaux |az/ festi
val, the sound is getting more jazzy, more
live. IheDJ is still the maestro," (iuru says,
but he lets able musicians Donald Byrd, sax
ophonist and tintist Derrick Davis, key
boardist Ruben Wilson, guitarist Zachary
Breux or drummer Willie McNeil open up
when they want to, laying back on the rap for
a chorus or two.

covers is an imitation of the standard Blue
