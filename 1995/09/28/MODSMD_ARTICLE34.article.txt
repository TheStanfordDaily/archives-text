# Marcus Mabry explores prejudice and fosters understanding
## 
### 
I have to admit, I felt strange when I first
picked up "White Ducks and Black
eyed Peas: ( oming ot Age Black in
White America hv Marcus Mahry. Here I
was, a white Republican \v ith an untlattering
opinion of affirmative action, being asked to
review an autobiography chronicling the
struggles of a talented young Mat k man as he
moves through society.
1 wondered whether people would take
the review seriously because of this fact.
More importantly, I worried whether I
would be able to understand Mabrv's experi
erice.
I shouldn't have worried. Mabry is an ex
ceptional writer, as evidenced by his position
as Newsweek's toreign correspondent in Paris.
Although he and I come from different worlds
and I can never truly imagine the tests he faced
(and still faces), Mabry paints a vivid enough
picture of his life that I feel that I do under
stand to some extent the experiences of his life.
Mabry was raised in Trenton, N.I. and
New York (.'ity by his hard-working grand
mother and his optimistic, always-dreaming
mother. He and his family, at one time or an
other, received help from nearly every public
assistance program the nation had to offer.
Somehow, they made ends meet.
Asa boy, Mabry's classmates titled him "the
professor," in reference to his inquisitive na
ture and the fact that he curled up with a book
more often than he rough-housed with the

neighborhood kids. While the taunts both
ered him at times, this thirst for knowledge al
lowed him to escape from the ghetto. He
gained admission to 1 awrenceville Academy,
an elite preparatory acadeim in New Jersey,
on lull scholarship. Mabr\ considers the years
spent at 1 awrenceville the best years of his life.
I'hey weren't easy years, though. At
law renceville, he had to deal with the preju
dices sometimes malicious, sometimes
not — ot his classmates and with the belief
that he was a token black at a nearly all-white
institution. When he returned home on
school vacations, he had to deal with the
harsh reality ot his family's life and the fact
that many of his relatives and old friends now
viewed him as an outsider, from this point
on, Mabry rarely hail a place to call home.
The I awrenceville education and his own
abilities gained him entrance to Stanford,
where he was unable to forge a lasting rela
tionship with the campus' African American
groups. Because of his willingness to develop
friendships with members of all races and
classes, he was considered a traitor to his own
race. His internal battle over his self-appoint
ed role as a black "ambassador" to the white
world was a difficult one that would not end
with graduation.
Now, after finding employment as a jour
nalist, Mabry is able to live well, although his
career is still plagued by prejudice. This only
increases the guilt he feels about his success

and the angst he feels about
the unfulfilled dreams of his
family and the black com
munity. He wishes to help
those he has left behind, yet
at the same time he does not
want them dependent upon
him.
Mabry writes honestly,
chronicling Ins own prejn
dices as well of those of the
white world. He relates the
story of how he believed a
rival in an election at
I awrenceville was a racist,
only to find out when lie and
the other boy exchanged di
aries that his beliefs were
wrong. Mabry is embar
rassed by his own error in
judgment anil by the anger
he expresses in his own jour
nal.

Another trying experi
ence lor Mabry was finally
meeting his lather, a successful judge in the
South, during his first lew years out of col
lege. Attempting to lorge a relationship with
the man was hard for Mabry, who wants to
know and love his father, but resents him for
never taking responsibility.
Mabry's story is a very vivid one, made
even more poignant by the current debates

Courtesy ol Scribner
over welfare, affirmative action and opportu
nity. I le offers 110 answers to these problems,
Init his experience may he a valuable tool in
fostering understanding, developing solu
tions and teaching us to address our preju
dices. A must read for all members of the
human race — he they black, white or green.
