# PAVEMENT and the truth they made for you
## 
### Mike Noren 
Stephen Malkmus probably said it best in
"Trigger Cut" when he sang, "I learned
the truth / the truth in the words / truth
I made for you / because it's just as good."
With Pavement, the way they fuck around
with thought is far more important than
what they really think.
Try as critics might to peg their influences,
there's much more to this group than some
blend of the Velvet Underground, KIM, the
Pixies and the Fall. I rom their earliest days in
Stockton, Pavement melted noise and
melody and sincerity and sarcasm into one,
producing a skewed pop racket that seemed
to come together like a glorious accident. But
beneath the haphazard arrangements and I
don't give-a shit smirks, they've just been a
band on a selfish mission to make music that
works for them. Pavement songs are laced
with inside jokes and oblique references that
require the listener to put all the pieces to
gether even though (list a few of the pieces are
supplied. However, although the meaning
tucked within these songs may be clear only
to the band members themselves, the
thought and emotion are intriguing and real
to outsiders as well.
I bis uniquely warped approach to music
making has brought Pavement loads of
indie-rock media attention, much of which
has been confused over-analysis aimed at
"figuring out" what it's all about. Under
standably, members of Pavement have not al
ways been the most cooperative sources of
insight. Asked il lie often makes stuff up dm
ing interviews, guitarist Scott "Spiral Stairs"
Kannberg replies openly, "All the time."

So despite Kannberg s pleasant and down
to-earth demeanor, I didn't approach this
phone interview expecting straightforward
explanations ot the hand and their music.
"When you're doing a lot of interviews, it
gets tiring, and sometimes you just sa\ what
ever comes to vour head, he warns me. But
fortunately, on this afternoon, I'm
Kannherg's first and only interview
wedged in before his 2:30 dentist appoint
ment and he assures me, "I'm telling yon
the truth
Last seen decked out in cowboy gear and
teasing cattle on M I V, Pavement aren't
operating on your usual road to rock
stardom. As the rest ol the alt rock world in
\ests in punks attitudes and distortion ped
als, Pavement don cowboy hats, whip out a
steel pedal guitar and perform their new sin
gle behind cardboard cut outs of donkeys
and cacti. It might not he the best money
making maneuver, hut it does manage to

shake things up and make people wonder
what the hell they're thinking.
"We just thought it was a funny thing to
do, with all this fake punk around, to go back
to our real roots," Kannberg says with a
laugh. The group's country and western gim
mick started with songs like "Range Life" and
"Father to a Sister of Thought," but the
clincher has to be the huge, gnarly beard that
drummer Steve West wore throughout the
summer's Lollapaloo/.a tour.
"Yeah, that's part of it," Kannberg says of
the growth before sadly reporting that West
shaved it off on the last day of Lollapalooza.
But it'll be back, Kannberg suspects, "be
cause he lives in rural Virginia — lie's like a
farmer there, a hay farmer."
It's unsure whether West really is a hay
farmer in Virginia, as there have been other
reports that he's living in New York along
with bassist Mark Ibold. Malkmus also
spends most of his time in New York, while
percussionist / back-up yeller Bob Nas
tanovich lives in Louisville, Kentucky.
With band members scattered across the
country, Kannberg, who resides in San Fran
cisco, compares his time with Pavement to
going away to college. "All of us just get to
gether for, like, six months out of the year as
a band," lie says. "It's a temporary thing, be
cause it's not really our way of life."
In case Pavement ever falls through,
Kannberg has been preparing to launch a ca
reer in urban planning. In fact, a careful lis
ten 10 songs like "Two States" and "Western
Homes' — both written by Kannberg —
might reveal a slight slant towards

that interest. "Two States" cspe
c ially, according to Kannberg,
is mostly about the way that
the businesses in southern
(California are "draining the
state." Kannberg plans to
continue studying urban
planning, as he is well
aware that "it's
r.itv Inn*»

in a band for over five years."
Pavement began six years ago in Stockton,
California. Longtime friends Kannberg
and Malkmus recruited garage-studio
owner Clary Young to play drums, and they
released two singles and a 10-inch EP, which
Chicago indie label Drag City has since re-re
leased on the compilation "Westing (by mus
ket and sextant)."
In 1992, Pavement made its first big splash
by signing with Matador Records, which re
leased its debut album, "Slanted & Enchant
ed." As the genius of this record became more
and more apparent, Spin magazine called it
"the Holy (irail of indie rock" and ranked it
best album of the year. Pop gems like "Zurich
Is Stained" and "Summer Babe" were offset
by chaotic experimentation and elegant
songcraft, while Malkmus* loose wordplay
balanced an endearing selflessness with an al
most Eonzie-like coolness. This impressive
debut, along with the equally impressive
"Watery, Domestic" EP, started the hype ma
chines cranking, with "the next REM" fore
casts springing from music mags across the
country.
In the following months of touring,
Kannberg and Malkmus' musical project de
veloped into a more formal band, with the
departure of original drummer Gary Young
and the addi-

tion of Ibold, Nastanovich and West.
Shortly after these lineup renovations
came the band's second and most accessible
LP, "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain." This
time around, they cut down on the noise and
tuzz that covered much of their earlier work
and put forth an almost straightforward col
lection of pop songs, with "Gold Soundz"
and "Cut Your Hair" showing a surprisingly
radio-friendly side of the group. "Cut Your
Hair" actually bears a striking resemblance
to the bouncy, melodic pop of Prince's
"Raspberry Beret."
Again, the group's thoughtful songwrit
ing and casual musicianship brought them
rave reviews, but it was a controversial verse
from "Range Life" that brought them the
most attention: "Out on tour with the
Smashing Pumpkins / nature kids, I / they
don't have no function /1 don't understand
what they mean and I could really give a fuck
/ The Stone Temple Pilots, they're elegant
bachelors / They're foxy to me, are they foxy
\ to you? /1 will agree, but it does absolutely
nothing / nothing more to me." Although
Smashing Pumpkins' management denies
any involvement, this passage was reported
ly responsible for Pavement's exclusion from
1994's Lollapalooza, which the Pumpkins
headlined.
Arrogant as it may seem, that verse can
also be seen as an innocently funny com
mentary on the music industry, reportedly
from the stand
point of a con-

fused, out-of-date country rocker who just
doesn't understand the whole alternative
rock craze.
"It we would've recorded that record
today, it wouldn't be the Smashing Pump
kins and the Stone Temple Pilots. It would be
someone else who's getting pushed a lot,"
Kannberg explains. "It wasn't anything real
ly against those bands in particular."
Perhaps to prove that point, Malkmus
changes the words to that song each time
they play it live. Past live versions of "Range
Life" have included lines ranging from "Out
on tour with the Gin Blossoms / They got
brains as big as opossums" to "Out on tour
with Material Issue / Makes me sad I think I
need a tissue."
"Material Issue," Kannberg recalls with a
quiet laugh. "That was a good one."
Earlier this year, Pavement released their
third LP, "Wowee Zowee," a wonderful
ly lazy hour of shameless genre-hop
ping that stands as Pavement's most diverse
project to date. But what some consider "di
verse" others consider "scrambled," and
"Wowee Zowee" didn't meet with the warm
media reception that its predecessors en
joyed. Rolling Stone gave it two and a half
stars, and Spin gave it only a lukewarm rec
ommendation. "It was the first time that
we'd ever really gotten bad press," Kannberg
says proudly. "And I think we had it coming
for a while."
"Wowee Zowee" was a clear signal that
Pavement were not going to be "the next
REM" — at least not riyht away. It wasn't

long ago ill,it Malkmus repeated the
words "don't expect" as the "Watery,
Domestic" HP faded to a close, and
now Pavement recall that warning,

stubbornly refusing to live up to
anyone's expectations but
the band members' own.
A clear break from the

indie-rock mold,
"Wovvee Zowee" is
.1 confused and
confusing celebra
tion of Pavement's
own mellow inde
pendence — the
album's scribbled
liner notes confess,
"I hope and hope
for an ahistorical
moment, hence
the garbled di//\
tone."
"We never realb

thought of us as a real 'indie' band,"
Kannberg says plainly. "I don't really con
sider 'Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain' an
indie-sounding record. 'Crooked Rain'
had a definitely different sound from
'Slanted & Enchanted,' and I think
'Wowee Zowee' went past that — maybe
more classic rock or something. . . . It's
fragmented and a lot different from our
other stuff."
This summer, Pavement took their war
bled vision on the road, joining the likes of
Hole, Sonic Youth and Sinead O'Connor on
the l.ollapalooza main stage. While the
venues were a bit huge and the crowds a bit
disinterested for Pavement's taste, they
managed to entertain themselves.
I he highlight of the tour, according to
Kannberg, took place at the Chicago show,
when the group poked fun at the city's
commercial-alternative radio station,
QlOl. Before the band took the stage, a fake
QlOl announcer grabbed the mike and at
tempted to lead the crowd in cheers for
some of alt-rock's more questionable acts
including Bush, Better than Ezra and
Sheryl Crow — before finally introducing
Pavement.
"That's actually a friend of ours who
does that every time we play Chicago,"
Kannberg explains. "But that time, a lot of
people were, like, cussing at him, because
they actually thought he was real. And then
afterwards we were in our dressing room
and Courtney Love comes in and goes,
'Where's that QlOl guy? I want to talk to
him!' And our friend said 'Here I am,' and
he totally played the part. And Courtney
iust tore into this guy. It made her look real
ly stupid. She was going like 'Why don't you
play our music?' and stuff. And this friend
of ours was like '()li, you're washed up. I low
old are you really?' And he was just totally
saying stuff. It was great."
Kannberg's 2:30 dentist appointment
brought our interview to an abrupt
halt, but not before he filled me in on
what to expect from Pavement in the near fu
lure. Pavement have a single titled "I love
Perth' that the\ plan to release in January,
and Kannberg also has a Spiral Stairs solo re
lease on the hori/on. I inally, Pavement will
shirt recording their next full length album
in the spring. "We need time to rest and write
songs,' he says, "so we'll j nsi kind of do it
fresh when we're ready. I think it'll be poppi
er than the last album."
That's what he fells me, but I wouldn't
count on if. It's belter oil if you don't expec I.
