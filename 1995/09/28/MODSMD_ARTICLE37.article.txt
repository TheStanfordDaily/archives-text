## RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS One Hot Minute 
### 
VVith the addition of former lane's Addic
lion guitar great 1 )ave Navarro on their latest
release "One Hot Minute," the Red Hot Chili
Peppers take steps in new directions, old di
rections and I'm-not sure they know
where the hell they're-going directions.
Since Navarro is such a powerful force on
guitar, ii is unsurprising that his presence has
had a huge influence the band's overall
sound. I lis heavy grinding rifts drive songs
such as "Warped," " Transcending" and "Cof
fee Shop," while 1 lea and ('had Smith are still
able to provide the Peppers' obligator)' funky
rhythm section. "Warped is particularly
reminiscent of luana's Addition, with Navar
ro, I lea and Smith providing an impressively
tight and hard soundscape while Anthony
Kiedis unsuccessfully warbles out his best
Perry Tarrell impersonation.
I lowever, even with the new, tighter-and
tougher sound, kiedis's lyrics continue to
center around the same old themes: lust, love
and "fucking... shit up." "Walkabout" and
"One Big Mob" exemplify Kiedis' trademark
gibberish chant. "One Big Mob" is particu
larly incoherent with lyrical gems ranging
from"I am you are me /1 am you are me...
aw yea aw yea," all the way to "Picaboo street
in Timbuktu / Do I need to repeat that a boy
named Sue / Rocking to the beat of a Kanga
roo / Let me kiss your feet and your forehead
too."
Songs like the shamelessly dramatic
"Tearjerker" and "My friends" are the alter
na-baliads that almost guarantee that "One
Hot Minute" will at least compare in popu-

larity with its predecessor. "My 112 riends,"
which begins with a beautifully succinct
melody to the lines "My friends are so de
pressed / I feel the question of your loneli
ness," could have just as easily started out
with "Sometimes I feel like I don't have a
partner. . ." Nonetheless, these catchy tunes
are sure to have the hordes humming all the
way to the local record store.
So "One I lot Minute" docs take a big step
forward with the addition of Dave Navarro.
However, given the Red Hot Chili Peppers'
shaky track record with guitarists, it is ques
tionable how long these advances will last.
