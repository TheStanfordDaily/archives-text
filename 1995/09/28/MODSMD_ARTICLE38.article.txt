# AIR MIAMI
## me. me. me. 
### 
Air Miami used to be Unrest, or at least
most of that overrated yet underappreciated
IK indie trio. Unrest played a bright, airy,
kinda flimsy pop, sparse with the guitar ef
fects but heavy on the affectation. By many
accounts, the band's 1991 release "Imperial
f.f.r.r." was one of the year's best, with the
1993 follow-up "Perfect Teeth" loaded with
more of the same. Yet soon after their first
major label I P "Perfect Teeth" was released
on Reprise subsidiary 4AI), the group broke
up.
Then Unrest front man / Teenbeat label
honcho Mark Robinson and bassist /singer
Bridget dross formed Air Miami, a duo pro
ject with rotating contributors that main
tains the vibe of its predecessor. Vet the
sounds on Air Miami's debut album "me.
me. me." are different, strong and fierce,
rather than clean and brittle. So while Robin
son's uppity voice couldn't sell his emotive
lyrics with Unrest's pristine soundscapes be-

hind him, Air Miami's racket is more com
plete, and somehow more appropriate. I he
opening track "I Hate Milk is loud, even
raucous at points, fitting oh-so-much better
with the melodrama of the chorus ol "Please,
please / Someone kill me soon." "Definitely
Beachy" comes off big and bold, where
Robinson's snooty assertion that, "I very
body loves me / Everybody loves how I look"
is matched in attitude by a crescendo ol gui
tar and bass. F.ven the instrumental noodling
that runs out the song draws attention
thrilling stuff and not vain filler.
Most appealing!}, Cross proves herself
more than an equal partner to the vaunted
Robinson, serving up the smoothest, most
pleasant tunes on the album. "Seabird" soars
on feathery guitars, with ( ross' wispy croon
painting the ebb and title ol a shore; in "Af
ternoon Train," she gets a tad loungey, her
voice swaying while syncopated rhythms be
neath keep the beat.
Yet not all of Air Miami's expansion on the
Unrest theme emerges so successfully.
Robinson dabbles a bit with some New Wave
sounds, which is harmless enough — except
ing the disastrously catchy "World Cup
Fever," a silly, kitschy song that comes off like
a bad commercial jingle that gets stuck in
your head. Still, Air Miami gets points tor
originality and development, moving for
ward instead of reveling in the delusions of
past grandeur.
