Superchunks sixth lull-length represents
one more tentative step on the path of rein
vention. "Here's Where the Strings Come In"

falls a stumbling halt-beat away from what
was becoming numbingly familiar: up-tempo
pop-punk, just catchy enough to get you com
fortable, just caustic enough to keep you inter
ested. Mac Metlaughan's reedy, pre-pubescent
vocals lend charm to the blisstul mess, and the
four-some from ( hapel I (ill seems content to
remain unvaried, firmly entrenched in their
comfort zone, with each new development
just a slight variation on a theme. Last year s
"Foolish" restated the case, perfected the form
and cried out for new ideas. "Strings," thank
fully, delivers a few, maneuvering the uneven
ground and overriding garage-rock inertia
without breaking a working mold.
I'he first track, "Hyper Hnough," with its
frantic tunefulness, could be the catchiest
thing the band has written. Stratospherically
breezy, with "single" tattooed across its
twitchv manic surface, the song offers one
more chance to revel in the familiar blend ot
bold delicacy. But then the punkish, choppy
phrasing of "Iron On" and "Yeah It's Beautiful
Here Too" fill the first half of the album with
stuttering repetition â€” an old, played-out Su
perchunk trick.
From there, though, it's oil to newer, if not
always greener, pastures. Songs like "Sunshine
State" and "Silverleaf and Snowy Tears" slip
from affecting introversion to misanthropic
melodrama. Superchunk is not at their best at
this tempo, a tad turgid, ripe with lingering
overkill.
The second half of the album, though, gets
it right. "Detroit Has a Skyline," "Green 112 low
ers, Blue Fish" and especially the exquisitely
anti-sentimental title track expand rather
than just slow down. Acoustic guitars and an
organ are welcome additions to the mix. The
songs seem wider, more complex, still un
abashedly appealing. The fullness sounds new,
healthier, as if Superchunk have finally given
themselves some breathing room.
One thing that hasn't changed, though, is
Mac's full endorsement of the I Mascis school
of cool-guy self-effacement. "I'm digging in

Superchunk's punk-pop still has a few new tricks.
