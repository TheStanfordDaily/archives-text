In a decision that could seriously af
fect students at Stanford and across the
country, the Senate Labor and Human
Resources committee voted Tuesday to
cut $10.8 billion from the federal student
loan program.
The committee's package requires
schools to pay the government a new fee
on all loans to students. According to
Cynthia Rife, assistant director of finan
cial aid, the .85 percent fee on student
loans will cost the University approxi
mately $276,000 a year.
The federal government currently
pavs a subsidiary for (he interest on st u
dent loans whilf I he student is in school
and for six months after graduat ion The
committee also voted to eliminate this
six-month grace period.
Stanford officials and student leaders

said the move would hurt not only the
University but students and their par
ents as well, and called for student action
against the cuts.
"I am hoping our student organiza
tions get involved," said Rife. "This will
cost the I niversity."
Explaining the program
Stanford mainly uses two typesofstu
dent loans, Stafford loans money lent
from t he government to banks and cred
it unions and Perkins loans, federal
money lent to students through the I ni
versity According to the proposal,
Stafford loans would be cut to 20 percent
of the total student loan volume, down
from 40 percent
The interest rate on PLUS loans,
which are loans the federal government
gives to parents, would go up approxi
mately 1 percent as well.
Nationally, the cost of loans for stu-

dents and their families will increase
$ 12.4 billion dollars.
"This tax will create a difficult sit tui
tion Funds must be found some place."
said Larry Norton, Stanford's director of
government relations.
Although the new costs will probably
be pooled with the general University
operating costs, Rife added that she
didn't know where money would come
from.
1 lorton said the elimination ofthesix
month period would be especially diffi
cult for students.
"The interest would begin to accrue
the day after graduation." said Morton.
The interest "is a substantial amount —
an undergraduate borrowing the maxi
mum amount for a 10-year loan, about
$17,000, will pay $1,000 dollars more."
"Certainly it's going to be a hard
ship for students to not have that grace
period." said Rife. "It will be much

more costly."
Lewis Roth, press secretary for Hep.
Anna Eshoo — the I)emocratic congress
woman from Stanford's district — said
the total cost of a student loan for an un
dergraduate student could increase be
tween 15 and 20 percent.
For a student going through both un
dergraduate and graduate schools, the
loan could increase by up to 50 percent.
"Last year, Stanford students got 3.3
million dollars in work study program
money," said Roth. "By eliminating the
interest subsidy, you are eliminating
students."
He said the average income of the
families this package will affect is
$35,000. "These are middle class fami
lies. Either students will look at the new
cost of loans and decide to attend a less
costly or prestigious university, or decide
