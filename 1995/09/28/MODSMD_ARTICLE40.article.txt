# GARBAGE
## 
### 
from behind the board, Butch Vig has
made an incomparable impact on modern
American rock and roll. The hit-making pro
ducer squeezed the pop song out of Nirvana,
turned the pretensions of Smashing Pump
kins into radio-friendly anthems and helped
the likes of Sonic Youth and Soul Asylum
bridge the gap between the underground and
the mainstream.
In that sense, Vig's own band Garbage may
be nothing more than a celebrity sideshow
featuring the guy who turned the knobs on
"Nevermind" and "Siamese Dream," a ready
made project riding on the coattails of the
success ol others. After all, nobody noticed
Garbage's over-the-top chanteuse Shirley
Manson when she performed in something
goth called Angelfish. If that says nothing
about the music on Garbage's self-titled
debut, it diffuses the hype and builds down
the expectations.

That the production
sounds sparklingly
clean and the guitars
throb relentlessly
comes as no surprise.
Yet the first coiling riff
on the opening track
"Supervixen" says
more for the band than
any press release or any
of Manson's irritating,
faux-toughgirl vocals.
That initial blast of
searing guitar is more
promising than any
thing that follows, like
My Bloody Valentine
come back to life. So
when Manson kicks in
with her trite, over
wrought lyrics
Make .1 whole new re
ligion: a falling star
that you cannot live
\\ ithout," so the chorus
goes — the facade of
noise <. rashes down.
Give credit to Vig for
trying to keep things
interesting and avoid

getting into a grunge rut. Bit; rhythms and
programmed samples offset the chugging
guitars, keeping the beat sot by contemporary
Br'it trip-hop artists like Iricky. "Not My
Idea" hints at the Jesus and Mary ( ham, with
a cleaner sound and more meat on its bones.
Still, the effort tails because there's too
much of everything. Too much Vig-as-pro

ducer, too much Manson-as-seductive
singer, too much stuff to keep the album and
the songs cohesive. 1 he record's alt-rock
radio track "Queer" speaks to the band's glar
ing shortcomings best: the retrain of "the
queerest of the queer/ the strangest of the
strange / the coolest of the coo! / the lamest
ofthe lame' rambles on without restraint, ig
noring any sense ot subtlety. Its ,is it most is
best, which it isn't.

On their major-label debut, Jawbreaker maintain shreds of their indie cred.
