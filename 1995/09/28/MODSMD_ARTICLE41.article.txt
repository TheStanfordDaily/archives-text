# JAWBREAKER
## Dear You 
### 
Ivor since the release of their first I I',
1990s "Unfun," lawbreaker have been some
what o! a punk phenomenon. On three indie
I Ps, the band created a style that, while re
maining rooted in punk's simplicity and raw
energy, blended deft lyrics, elaborate musical
texturing and tortured yet still melodic vocals
to create a sound that was exclusively their
own. lawbreaker were a punk s dream: intclli
gent, talented and — despite the accessibility
ol their music — strongly devoted to the "do
it-yourself" ideals ol the punk community.
Their oft-repeated vow to never sign to a
major label made them sometimes seem like a
Bay-Area Fugazi: dedicated to success on their
own terms and unwilling to compromise to
the demands of the profit-driven industry.
That all changed last fall, when, after
months of speculation, lawbreaker signed
with (ieffen. As a fan, I was disappointed by
their decision, which seemed to insult the
dedicated fanbase that had believed in the
ethics the band has now tossed aside. So
when I heard "Dear You," the band's major
label debut, I really wanted to hate it. Well, no
such luck, lawbreaker's new record does
sound different from their old stuff — a lot
different, but enough of their old ability and
depth remains to interest both old and new
fans alike.
Don't get me wrong — "Dear You" con
tains its fair share of easy-listening crap.

While singer Blake Schwarzenbach's lyrics
si ill show a gift for intelligence and witty
wordplay, at times lie's reduced to silliness
like "Life is an oyster / locked in its shell / you
like the taste / but you can't stand the smell."
His once-rough voice, a hallmark of the
hand's earlier sound, has been overproduced
almost to death. Much of the elaborate niusi
cality that set lawbreaker oil from their pop
punk peers has been stripped away in order
to create shorter songs more suitable for Buzz
Bin bombardment.
But despite all the fluff, Jawbreaker still
knows how to put together a good song. The
slow, ballady "Accident Prone" highlights the
melodic, harmonic and lyrical depth that
marked their earlier releases. "Chemistry" is
a catchy, poignant tale of high-school rejec
tion, while the powerful, edgy "I I ove You So
Much It's killing l : s Both," apparently a song
about abortion, reverberates with a rage and
angst well-suited to its weighty subject mat
ter. Jawbreaker may have lost something in
their jump to the majors, but they still stand
head and shoulders above most of the alter
native rock crowd.
