## AMERICAN HEROES Unstrung Heroes 
### 
I lie death ol .1 parent is a confusing and
anguishing experience lor .1 young hoy, espe
ciallv when his role models consist ol an out
ol touch lather and two hall crazed uncles.
With humor and poignancy, "IJnstrung I le
roes" tells the story ol one hoys coping
process as his mother grows weaker.
Ihe hoy, Stephen I .id/ (Nathan Watt),
leads a near normal, late-*s()s life with a cou

pie of exceptions. His father, Sid (John lur
turro), is .in inventor who believes in the
power ol science to solve the world's proh
lems and constantly devises and documents
his oddball creations. Although he is unsure
il his dad is a weirdo, like the kids at school
say, or a genius, as his 1110111 (Andie Mat
Dowel I) tells him, his home life is basically
set ure and carefree until his mother becomes
ill.
Moth Stephen and his father are forced to
come to grips with the inevitability ol her
death. Shut oil from his resting mother and
at the mercy ol a shady nanny, Steven feels

The whole dysfunctional family.
helpless in .1 slowly disintegrating home.
In order to regain normalcy, Steven ironi
cally turns to his two off-kilter uncles. Uncle
Albert collects junk from the trash and sew
ers while the other, played by Michael
Richards (Seinfelds Kramer) lives in fear
that "they" are after him.
In his uncles, Stephen finds the stability and
acceptance his father never provided and
comes to accept that his mother, the paragon of
love and comfort in his life, is dying. He also
discovers his own power of creativity and a new
sense of religion from his idiosyncratic uncles.
Under the direction of Diane Keaton,
"Unstrung Heroes" touchingly chronicles

the relationships between a boy, his parents
and his uncles under the worst of circum
stances. both the unique soundtrack and the
creative scene transitions add to tlie movie s
charm yet it's the quirky characters, particu
larly Stephen's uncles, which make the movie
so compelling.
While Stephen and his father take differ
ent paths, they are finally reconciled in a pre
dictable, yet moving ending. Stripped of the
flash and dazzle of today's blockbusters,
"Unstrung Heroes" presents an honest yet
eccentric look at how one boy grows and
changes as he loses the person he loves most.
