# BITE INTO A CUTTING-EDGE FANG FILM

Vampire films have become as hard to kill
as the monsters themselves these days. Twelve
years after "The

Tarantino and

David l.ynch are
now coming out
with their own "I
vant to suck your
blood" flicks. The

latest release is
M ichael Al mereyda's

"Nadja," starring Nina I owen- >
sohn (the architect in "Schindler's
l ist") as a confused and seductive

vampiress lurking in the midnight
streets ol New York C!ity.

Peter Fonda stars in two roles, main
ly as a I)r. Van I Iclsing, an eccentric vam
pire killer; and Su/y Amis, ("The Usual

Suspects") plays a midwestern nurse in love
with the vampire Fdgar (Jared 1 larris). Lines
such as, "he was like Flvis in the end .. . the
magic was gone," and the surreal relation
ships between the characters bear the dis
tinct mark of David Lynch, the film's execu
tive producer. The director, known for his
twisted depiction of down-home Ameri

cana, appears briefly in "Nadja" as a slightly,
well, I.ynchian morgue attendant.
The film is shot entirely in black and
white, interspersed with hallucinatory Pix
elvision cuts recorded on a used $45 Fisher-
Price camera. "Nadja" is reminiscent of the
MTV-styled "Natural Horn Killers": short

scencs
arc layered

onto each other to
create a swirl of gritty

urban impressions and
quick blasts of violence. The
dizzying and sexual cinemato
graphic style, along with excellent

performances, helps to cover
for the simplistic, Dracula

remake story.
1 was mesmerized

by the multi-tex
tured and fast-

paced vision

of this
film. But my

friend was bored
by the plot, which

was all too reminiscent
of Ed Wood's kooky and

lame horror flicks. Howev
er, we both loved the
soundtrack, which brought
us into the theater in the

first place. Short bursts of music
from Portishead's debut album,
"Dummy," intensified the already
richly gothic and film noire-like

qualities of the film.
This is a perfectly superficial film.
The vampiress Nadja's pain and long-

ing lor a normal lite is nut an echo ot
real emotion. However, the perfor
mances by Fonda, Harris and Amis
make for an entertaining hour and a

half, and the slick, experimental di
rection is a treat in itself.
"Nadja" is like a visual candy that

never loses its flavor. But you can't live
on sweets alone.
