## 'SHOWGIRLS' BARES ALL FOR NOTHING 
### 
Having gone to school in Las Vegas, I'm
used to getting quirky looks when I mention
I've lived there. I guess when people think of
the place they have visions of sinful showgirls
dancing in their head.
That's the stereotype writer Joe Eszterhas
and director Paul Verhoeven — the men who
brought you "Basic Instincts" — play on in
their new skin flick, "Showgirls." But instead
of being a serious expose on the seemy side of
the entertainment industry, it mutates into
what my fellow movie reviewer and I thought
was a hilarious, if ludicrous, film about a
semi-talented dancer who has great, urn, taste
in costumes and nail polish. We could not
stop laughing — it was like a silly B-rate
movie on par with an I d Wood flick.
This may have been due to the tact that it
was almost impossible to take Elizabeth
Berkley seriously because in the back of our
heads we couldn't get past the idea that we
were watching Jessie — peppy class president,
studious valedictorian and all-around nice
gal in "Saved by the Bell." Apparently, her act
ing ability has not progressed far from her
days in high school. It may have gotten worse.
The plot is simple enough. Berkley plays
Nomi Malone, a young woman with a sordid
past trying to make it as a dancer, uh, showgirl
in Las Vegas. Along the way, she meets some

unsavory folks and finds out the road to fame
is paved with the mangled bodies of people
stepped on during one's climb to the top.
Throughout the movie, people fit into neat

and quick stereotypes. It's a veritable encyclo
pedia of political incorrectness. The men
were all predatory and sleazy (except lor Kyle
MacLachlan, who's a decent fellow but has a

fetish for cocaine) and the women either
helpless or manipulative. There are also
bitchy gay guys and nasty lesbians. 1 particu
larly liked the sleazy oriental businessmen
who had nothing better to do than to lurk
about in strip bars and ogle at nude girls.
Most every review column has slammed
"Showgirls," from the New York Times, which
calls it "a bare-bottom bore" to the Merc, say
ing it's "vulgar, venal and utterly idiotic." Even
the guys at the I )aily office, a pretty laid-back
bunch, are berating its obviously sexual allure
and NO 17 rating. The negative reviews were
incited not only by the bad acting but by the
stunningly deplorable dialogue: "You look
better than a 10 inch cock" is the line at which
audience members can no longer restrain
laughter or disgust.
but that does not mean that "Showgirls'
doesn't have any redeeming qualities. The
dancing was good, the scenes ol the nude Las
Vegas revue were artistically well done (great
costumes, on par with "Priscilla," I think) and
the bisexual villainess ( ristal, played by Gina
Ciershon, is one major babe. Who says you
can't have it both ways?
So is it worth the price of admission? I say
go for it. If you've got over two hours to kill
and a few bucks in loose change lying around,
"Showgirls" is great to see with some friends.
It's like Vegas itself: hot and gaudy, and you'll
be talking about it for a long time.

Elizabeth Berkley acts too badly to turn anyone on.
