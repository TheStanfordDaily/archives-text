# 'SE7EN' OFFERS THRILLS AND CHILLS
## 
### 
"Se7en" is one of the best movies I've seen
in a while, but I didn't like watching it at all.
When I first thought of ways to describe it,
I thought of comparing it to a scab — you
know you shouldn't pick at it, but you just

can't resist it. However, it's more like plung
ing a knife into your own stomach over and
over again, but being unable to stop yourself
because the pain just feels too good.
Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, who
wrote "Se7en" while working as a cashier at
lower Records in New York (lily, and direc
tor David l incher ("Alien3") paint a dark,

gritty and disturbing tale. Rain falls con
stantly, darkness hides everything and dis
concerting background noises intrude into
your mind.
Brad I'itt, in .1 role where he barely ever
has his shirt off, plays David Mills, a young
detective recently transferred to the precinct.
He teams up with I t. William Somerset
(Morgan freeman), a

griz/lcd veteran with
in days of retirement.
Pretty original
combo, right? Don't
worry — the old
cliche works well in
this case.
The two are pulled
into the twisted world
of a cunning killer
a religious fanatic
named John Doe who
hopes to make a state
ment about the moral
decay of society by
using the seven deadly
sins as the underlying
theme of seven mur
ders committed over
seven days.
As the film moves
through its grisly
course of torture and
murder, the charac
ters' respective views
of human nature are
tested and altered by
their contact with
Does sickened mind.

Mills, who
seems to be
lieve that he
can save the
world single
hande d I y,
must face the
fact that
somet i m e s
evil cannot he
stop p e d .
Soiner s e t ,
made numb
by his years of
exposure to
the underbel
ly of a large
metropolis,
learns that
some things

are still worth fighting for. both must deal, as
does the moviegoer, with the part of himself
that feels as disgusted with the world as the
killer does.
I rom the disorder of its opening credits to
the intensity of its conclusion (pay close at
tention to what 112 reeman's character says in
the bar), the viewer is bombarded with the
vile machinations ol both I )oeand the city he
despises. Which evil is worse? What is right
and what is wrong? The finale offers no an
swers and leaves the viewer questioning his
own nature.
Rarely have I been so transfixed by a film.
Although it grates on the nerves, turns the
stomach and churns the soul, "Se7en" is a
movie that you'll want to see.
