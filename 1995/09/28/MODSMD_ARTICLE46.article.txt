## Travis Vigil A 						growing man's rock-a-pella fantasy 
### 
Walking through White Plaza the
other day, strange, vibrant sounds
floated by my ears. Sounds that ca
ressed my aural faculties and strangely
tempted me. Sounds that were just familiar
enough to make me listen and just different
enough to make me wonder.
No, it wasn't Van Morrison singing
"brown I'.yed Girl;" nor was it him singing
"Moondance." It was someone else; some
thing else, something better, sweeter and
smoother. Welcome my friends. Welcome to
Stanford, Mecca tor Rock A Pella, one of the
only places in the world where singing a tap
pella might get you some action.
Now as a young and inexperienced lad, I
always tended towards loud, raucous music.
You know, music that displays r.iw emotion
through blaring guitars and a heavy back

beat; three chords and the truth. The kind of
music that makes your head snap like a whip
and your feet dance uncontrollably. But that's
all changed now.
I remember that night my freshman year
like it was yesterday. I saw them on a brisk
Stanford evening. They were clad in white
jerseys and shimmering in the moonlight.
My lord, they were larger than life. As their
siren sounds lured me in, I dared to dream it.
I dreamt that maybe if I practiced my scales,
pampered my vocal chords and ate my
Wheaties, I too could be a Rock A Pella god.
No amps, no mike and, for love of God, no
guitar. It's )ust me in my black leather pants,
snake skin boots, too-cool for you shades
and a big, shiny belt Inkkle, just like that one
guy from the ( ult. It's me a cappella god.
I'm belting out hard hitting, smooth, mellow

sounds.
I would strike fear in the hearts of the min
ions just like Dec Snider from Twisted Sister.
I would be badder than 1 ienry Rollins, scari
er than Alice Cooper. I would be the Iggy Pop
of a cappella, stringy and tough with the
meanest vocal chords in the continent. My
rendition of the fesus Lizard's "Then Comes
Dudley" would make the women swoon and
the men quiver as the soul less sounds hit
them in the face like sonic guano.
I would knock 'em dead when I smash up
all my equipment at the end of each show like
the Who or Nirvana. Wait, 1 don't have any
equipment. Well, I 'd smash something up at
the end of each show. I do have a pitch pipe.
That would be pretty spectacular. I could
smash the pitch pipe with a giant mallet and
spew tiny shards of destroyed pipe into the

audicnce just like a Gallagher show, without
the skinny bald man.
Yes, I wish it could be me and my back-up
band of only 10 other people up there on
stage. The spotlight illuminates me. Sweat
drips slowly and erotically off of my face.
Women's undergarments shower me from
the audience. Bobby McFerrin can just forget
being happy and he had better start to worry
because when this a cappella god takes the
stage the mountains will crumble.
So you alterna-types can have that guitar
those drums and that bass. You can keep youi
riffs, distortion and loud blaring stadium
shows. Just give me my vox, a can of bud ant
maybe a couple of other voxes to back me up
and I'm ready to go. All 1 need is my starting
note from the pitch pipe and then there's n<
telling what might happen.
