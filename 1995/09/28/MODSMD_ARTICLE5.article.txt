"Traveling in a hot air balloon feels
like you're floating like a cloud, ;it the
whims of the winds around you," said
Lawrence Poree, a research associate
and third-year student at the Stan
ford Medical School.
Poree is offering rides in his hot air
balloon this Saturday morning on the
intramural fields to raise enough
money to send 1,000 pounds of much
needed medical supplies to Kenya's
Tenwek Missionary Hospital, the
largest Protestant hospital in Africa.
After receiving his Ph.D. at UC-
Berkeley in toxicology in 1988, Poree
became a faculty research scientist at
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
For his graduation and birthday, his
wife presented him with a ride in a hot
air balloon. Since then, Poree has
been flying for eight years and has
t tied ballooning as a business.
"It was a lousy business. It was
more charity events than anything
else," Poree said.
Though ballooning was an unsuc
cessful business venture, the hobby
has proved worthwhile in unexpected
ways.
Poree travels to the height of 1,000
feet in his balloon and "you just end
up wherever vou end up." The balloon
has no maneuverability and t ravels at
a steady rate of 5 miles per hour.
Poree usually lands on someone's
property and hands out a bottle of
champagne along with a colorful bal
loon pin.
()nce he landed in a winery in west
ern Maryland in his rainbow-colored
balloon. The owner of the winery had
gone to a Bible retreat the previous
weekend with the slogan "Lift Your
Spirits Higher" and a rainbow-col
ored balloon was the symbol. Upon
seeing Poree's balloon out of his bed

room window that morning, the?
owner said to him, "the Lord must ve
sent you." Instead of receiving the
champagne from I'oree, the owner
presented him with many bottles of
wine.
Another time I'oree was sett ing up
his balloon on an open field in the
early morning darkness when he
looked up and saw 100 pairs of eyes
staring off in the distance. When he
flew above the field he saw a huge
herd of deer After landing miles later,
people began coming out of t he trees.
It was the first day of hunting season.
"Ballooning gives you a great view
you can't get any other way," I'oree

said. "It's like a walk through the top
of the forest ."
"I tried skydiving and parasailing
and found that I like to float around
looking at the scenery but not the
falling," Poree said. "The balloon is
really a large parachute and allows
you to see the environment in a differ
ent way."
Oddly enough, the main danger in
ballooning is not falling, since you
would bit the ground slower than if
you were strapped to a parachute. Ac
cording to Poree, hitting powerlines,
however, may cause serious injuries.
Surprisingly, Poree has successful
ly combined his love of ballooning

with his desire to provide medical help
for missionary hospitals in Africa bv
donating the proceeds from balloon
rides to supplement the shipping
costs of the medical supplies. Visiting
Kenya several times, he has seen first
hand the need for improved hospital
equipment.
While visiting Tenwek Hospital,
Poree asked what kind of pain-killers
were used and the simple answer was
"none at all." Gloves were washed and
reused after surgery, and the hardest
items to come by were everyday sup
plies such as tips of crutches.
