# Big Blue donation
## IBM gives money for campus research

In order to promote research
utilizing high-end computers,
IBM has donated $745,000
worth of hardware, software,
'grants and graduate fellow
ships to five Stanford research
• teams.
One of the teams to receive
support was a group from the
Center for Integrated Systems.
Headed by Robert Button, pro
fessor of electrical engineering,
the group is investigating ways
•to build more efficient comput
er circuitry.
"The equipment will be used
to do computational prototyp
ing, which is the ability to
design next generation elec
tronics for computing or infor
mation infrastructure," Button
said.
'•'IBM provided the group
with hardware and software to
upgrade their SP/1 computer to
a more powerful SP/2, Button
said. The upgrade is valued at
approximately $200,000. The
group also received $30,000 for
• jiOrsonnel support.
'♦'•'Another team that obtained
from IBM is group led
»f)y Rajeev Motwani, assistant
professor of computer science
They received an IBM RISC
System/6000/590, which i.-
worth about $85,000.
"It's going to be used for
optimization in compilers and
databases," Motwani said. "We
are working on techniques to
make programs and databases
run faster."
Also receiving an IBM RISC
System/6000/590 computer
was the team headed by Shan
Wang, assistant professor of
materials science, and engi
neering and electrical engineer
ing at the ('enter for Research

on Information Storage Materi
als. The team will use the
equipment in it.s research on
high density data storage,
Wang said.
IBM has given ;i $34,000
IBM RISC System/6000/370
to Hector Garcia-Molina, pro
fessor of computer science
and electrical engineering.
According to Molina, the com
puter will aid in the develop
ment of software to centrally
manage separate database
programs
The final grant was to the
team of Edward Shortliffe, pro
fessor of medicine. They
received a IBM RISC Sys
tem 6000 370 to study the use
of medical terminology.
The recipients said they
thought they received the sup
port from IBM because of the
distinction of their research
projects and because of their
past work with IBM
"We received the equipment
because we have a good reputa
tion and because we have had
good collaboration with IBM
|before|," Wang said. "IBM has
always been a strong supporter
of information storage at Stan
ford."
All receiving support were
excited about t he donations and
said they expected them to aid
in their research
I hitton noted the sophistica
tion of the IBM computers,
while Larry Fagan, co-director
of the Shortliffe team, said the
computers would allow greater
compatibility with their collab
orators at Columbia Universi
ty-
"We are very excited. We
look forward to making many
important contributions with
this [equipment! and fruitful
collaboration with IBM I in the
future!," Want: said.
