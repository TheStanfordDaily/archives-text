# Sher to run for Campbell's state Senate seat
## 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
Assemblyman and Stanford Law Prof.
Emeritus Byron Sher became the latest play
er in the California legislature's game of
political musical chairs last Friday, announc
ing his formal candidacy for the state Senate
seat being vacated by another Stanford law
professor, Tom Campbell.
"After talking it over with my family this
past week, I've decided to run for the state
Senate," Sher said in a press release.
Slier currently represents the 21st Assem
bly District, which consists of much of San
Mateo County and the communities of Palo
Alto, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills and Stanford.
On Sept. 14 CampbeJl declared his inten
tion to run for the U.S. House seat being
vacated by Rep. Norm Mineta. Campbell will
resign from his state Senate seat to cam
paign for Congress, after which a special
election must be held to fill the vacancy.
If he wins the special election, Sher will
represent his current constituents as well as
other Peninsula communities including
Cupertino, Saratoga, Los Gatos and Camp
bell.
Sher's chief of staff, Kip Lipper, said
Sher's decision to run was based partly on
the rampant partisanship he said has over
run the state assembly.
"The infighting among various factions
has become verv heated, and substantive

progress related to environmental progress
has been put aside in the interest of partisan
warfare," Lipper said. "Assemblyman Sher
believes that running for and serving in the
Senate will provide a forum where he can
continue to work on the policies that concern

his constituents."
Sher has been involved
with a number of issues
since he began serving in the
Assembly in 1980, including
consumer protection, eco
nomic development, im
provements in public educa
tion and protecting abortion
rights.
Many of his legislative

accomplishments have been in environmen
tal policy. He is chair of the assembly's Nat
ural Resources Committee, and he played an
active role in passing a number of environ
mentally conscious laws, including the Cali
fornia Clean Air Act, the California Safe
Drinking Water Act and the Integrated
Waste Management Act.
In addition, he smoothed passage for a bill
that allows the state to purchase the Headwa
ters Forest, which houses the last remaining
coastal redwoods. He has also pushed for a bill
to promote the development of environmental
technology, which would create job and busi
ness opportunities while helping the environ
ment.
Sher said in the nress release that the cur

rent attitude of the legislature toward these
issues played a key role in his decision to seek
the Senate seat.
"When 1 began my current term in the
Assembly, I seriously considered closing out
my career in the legislature and returning to
Stanford," he said. "However, in the past
nine months I ve become quite concerned
over what I've seen in the state capital.
"This year, the new majority in the
assembly tried to force through huge tax
breaks for the wealthy at the expense of our
public schools," he added. "The anti-choice
forces sent a strong signal that they won't
stop until they've eliminated a woman's
right to make her own reproductive choices.
And California's landmark environmental
laws are under unprecedented attack from
the right.
"In my view, as the Assembly becomes
more chaotic and less productive, the state
Senate will be the forum in which this state's
future ultimately will be decided," Sher said.
"That is why I have decided to run."
With a Republican majority in the Assem
bly, the Democratic Party is scrambling to
retain control of the Senate. However, Lip
per said, partisan politics did not play a
major part in Sher's decision.
"Assemblyman Sher has been one who
has eschewed excessive partisanship," Lip
per said. "He's looking more at being able to
continue the accomplishments he's made in
the state Assembly "
