## 'Do the right thing' Cochran gives fiery closing appeal in Simpson case 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — In a thundering sum
mation that rocked the court, Johnnie Cochran .Ji
exhorted O.J. Simpson's mostly black jury yester
day to "do the right thing" and acquit Simpson as
a message against racism and police misconduct
In the fevered style of a revival preacher,
Cochran invoked biblical texts, referred to two key
detectives as "the twin devils of deception" and
told the jurors that fate had given t hem a chance to
change history.
Cochran's impassioned appeal, which enraged
the father of one murder victim, was followed by
the cooler, scientific analysis of defense attorney
Barry Scheck, who told jurors: "There is a cancer
at the heart of this case."
Scheck insisted they could not trust any of the
DNA analysis of blood because the samples were
contaminated and tampered within the "black

hole" of the Los Angeles Police Department crime
lab.
"Somebody played with this evidence," he said.
"There's no doubt about it."
Cochran's emotion-packed discourse — often
focused on Detective Mark Fuhrman — clearly was
designed to rouse feelings of racial solidarity
among the nine black members of the 12-person
jury.
"A racist is someone who has power over you,"
he told them "This man would lie and set you up
because of the hatred he has in his heart."
He played for jurors the sound of Fuhrman's
voice speaking the infamous racial epithet that he
swore to them he had not spoken in 10 years. He
read to jurors every word of a letter from witness
Kathleen Bell, who said she heard Fuhrman advo
cate burning all blacks.
