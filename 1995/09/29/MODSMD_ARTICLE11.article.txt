WASHINGTON (AP) — In another milestone
toward peace, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Kabin
and PLO chief Yasser Arafat signed a historic agree
ment yesterday ending Israel's military occupation
of West Bank cities and laying the foundation for a
Palestinian state.
"We want you as good neighbors," the gravelly
voiced Rabin told Arafat, his onetime blood enemy.
"Enough killing and enough killing of innocent
people," Arafat declared to loud applause.
Under the glittering chandeliers of the Past
Room, President Clinton presided over two hours of
speeches and pageantry before an audience of 200
diplomats, foreign ministers, Cabinet secretaries
and members of Congress. Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein joined
Clinton as witnesses to the accord.
"Chapter by chapter, Jews and Arabs are writing
a new history for their ancient lands," Clinton said.
Arafat and Rabin both called on Syria and Lebanon
to drop their reluctance to join the peace process.
To worldwide acclaim, Arafat and Rabin signed a
tortuously negotiated agreement for Israel to relin

quish control of territory it captured from Jordan in
the 1967 Six-Day War.
The agreement outlines in painstaking detail the
step-by-step withdrawal of Israeli forces and the
transfer of governing authority for Palestinian self
rule in .'lO percent of the West Bank, containing most
of its Arab population. The accord also allows for
Palestinian elections.
"Please, take a good, hard look," Rabin told the
hushed audience. "The sight you see before you at
this moment was impossible, was unthinkable just
three years ago."
But Rabin also warned that peace could crumble
unless both sides unite against terrorists who are
trying to prevent peace. "Don't let it happen," he
implored.
"If all the partners to the peacemaking do not
unite against the evil angels of death by terrorism,
all that will remain of this ceremony are color snap
shots, empty mementos," Rabin said.
For his part, Arafat said the accord "demon
strates (he irreversibility of the peace process." He
called it the "peace of the brave."
