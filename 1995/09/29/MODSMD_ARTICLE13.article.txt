STV should not
make students pay
for free television

STUDENTS TUNING their
television sets to "Seinfeld"
and "Friends" may find a
nasty surprise this year. NBC is
scrambled, and so are ABC, CBS
and Fox. If you want them or any
of the channels that are typically
broadcast for free outside of Stan
ford, you're going to have to shell
out some dough.
Just about every undergraduate
residence, minus a few Row hous
es, is cable-ready for this year. To
receive cable, students must sub
scribe to STV, Stanford's cable
television service. Compared to
other cable companies, STV's
rates are quite fair — if you forget
that students are forced to pay for
broadcast channels they previous
ly got for free.
Making students pay for basic
television channels, like the major
networks and local stations, is a
rip-off, plain and simple. It is
unfair to students, and the Uni
versity should seriously reevaluate
its current policy.
According to the University,
broadcast channels are considered
"entertainment," making it legiti
mate to charge students for them.
Although the University's position
is somewhat valid, it is not an
argument without flaws.
To begin with, the major net
works are not only a source of
entertainment. While they carry a
wide range of comedies and dra
mas, they also offer a variety of
news stations. Local news, nation
al news and TV news magazines
like "20/20" are just a few of the
shows that students can find on
television stations.
Last year, the University did
away with CNN because it was a
financial burden on the institu
tion. Although that took away a
major news channel, it was accept

able because broadcast news was
available. By taking away broad
cast news, students are left with
very little opportunities to watch
the news.
Students can still view public
television for information on cur
rent events. Hut PBS falls short of
broadcast television. Its news pro
gramming provides nowhere near
the same breadth of coverage and
range of times that the major net
works offer.
Secondly, the University policy
seems contradictory. Although the
University doesn't allow individu
al students to receive broadcast
channels, it allows dorm lounges
to receive them. If the University
wants to establish a policy of not
broadcasting "entertainment" sta
tions for free, then it should stick
to its policy. Anything else sends
out the wrong message.
Finally, one of the goals of Resi
dential Education is to give stu
dents a home away from home.
Most homes don't have to pay $20
to receive broadcast channels.
Some students might even
argue that with the high cost of liv
ing on campus, the very least the
University could do is to make free
television what it is — free. It's
perfectly understandable to charge
for MTV and ESPN, but lot the
major networks into the rooms.
And it's not as if students have
any other choice. By making stu
dents pay for broadcast television,
the University is effectively mak
ing a monopoly out of STV No
matter how powerful students'
antennas are, it is hard to pick up
channels other than UPN and the
Home Shopping Network.
Since antennas don't work very
well and satellite dishes are pro
hibited by Residential Education,
the only way students can get
broadcast television is to pay for
basic cable — even if they only
want the free channels.
Students who disapprove of the
University's decision not to broad
cast network channels for free
should contact STV and let the
University know that it needs to
change its policy.
