# Campus viewpoint
## Joaquin Castro Hmm, what does the ASSU do? 
### 
What is the
ASSU? At this
point, we're prob
ably best known for leav
ing homesick freshmen
without Ihhl sheets.
For upperclassmen, the
ASSU conjures thoughts
of wanna-be politicians
who litter the campus
with banners, flyers and
otherwise boring campaign literature
every April. Before you dismiss us as a
bunch of ambitious do-nothings, howev
er, take a moment to consider how the
ASSU contributes to student life at Stan
ford
The roles and responsibilities of the
ASSU are many. First and foremost, it
provides fun and useful student services
and represents the student body in Uni
versity decision making. Students who
find hitting the snooze button a fourth
time more appealing than crawling out
of bed for a 9 a.m. physics class take
solace in our Lecture Notes service. For
the frustrated few who do attend class,
we offer Sunday Night Flicks — a paper
fight playground where academic agony
and wholesome violence come together.
The ASSU also sponsors the Speaker's
Bureau, which has invited cultural,
social and political leaders such as Spike

Lee, Joycelyn Elders and Oliver North
to lecture. All said, the ASSU spends
thousands of dollars on its business pro
jects.
Our potential is much greater. With a
force of over 14,000 students behind it,
the ASSU has tremendous bargaining
power in its interaction with the admin
istration and the Faculty Senate, but it
needs your help to realize its potential.
Opportunities to work with the ASSU
abound.
The ASSU Senate, the student repre
sentative body, offers students a chance
to participate in student government.
Each year, both undergraduate and grad
uate students elect 10 voting and 10 non
voting senators each, in addition to a
Council of Presidents elected by all stu
dents. The senate and the COP are the
students' direct link to the University
administration. In fact, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper comes before the
senate each quarter to chat.
The senate also selects senate associ
ates who work with senators on various
projects, and each dorm elects an ASSU
representative who interacts with the
senate. Dorm representatives add a per
sonal and local connection to student
government. They inform the senate of
concerns or complaints that students in
their house may have about Residential

Education, Dining Services, academics
and even the ASSU itself. Those of you
just itchin' to jump into the fray are in
luck! Each spring (lie ASSU Nomina
tions Committee selects students to sit
with administrators and faculty on Uni
versity committees. These committees
provide students an opportunity to help
shape University policy and mingle with
University bigwigs. That alone should
water the mouth of every resume packer
and recommendation seeker out there.
The time to join is now. The ASSU
wants to improve your life here at Stan
ford. We'll tackle everyone's favorite prob
lem the ever-popular food service. Ever
been in a class with three "nice" TAs anil
one "hard-ass" — and you get stuck with
the hard-ass? We'll argue for the improve
ment of teaching. And when it's 2 p.m.,
SURE is done for the night and you've got
to walk from Manzanita to Sterling Quad,
you'll greet strangers cheerfully on your
trek home, knowing that we've worked to
improve campus safety.
C'mon. We'll make changes. We'll
have fun. And if you're wondering how to
join, just ask the guy with the green hair.
