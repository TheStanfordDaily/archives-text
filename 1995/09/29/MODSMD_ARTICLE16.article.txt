Bookstore should buy the amount of books professors want

I WANT TO bring to the attention of
the Stanford community, students,
faculty and administrators a fact
well known to some of us, and one of its
more recent illustrations. The Stanford
Bookstore has, in the past, routinely
ordered less books than requested by
course instructors, evaluating (most
often without consulting the instruc
tors) the enrollment in a course. This is
done to maximize profits — no books are
sent back to the publisher, and the stu
dents who really want their own copies
will order them. Today, I learned that

the Bookstore had ordered 115 less
copies of Hesiod's "Theogony" (a
required text for this week) than I had
requested (340). This was done without
consulting me. The course I am teaching
is History 1 — the first tier of History
CIV — where the frosh overwhelmingly
buy their books, if only because they
have little other choice. This unilateral
decision has disrupted teaching in this
very first week of classes, at the very
moment when the frosh are the most
confused.
The Stanford Bookstore enjoys a cen

tral location on an isolated campus for
which it pays slim rent. It enjoys other
privileges such as the benefits of the
Stanford logo and the sale of Stanford
paraphernalia. It has a quasi-monopoly
situat ion as a provider of books.
I talked with the new Bookstore
course material manager, Hani Sayegh.
He assured me that the Stanford Book
store would do its best to remedy the
specific situation I just outlined. He
assured me as well that he felt the Book
store's mission is, in his mind, to serve
the community. He will tour Bay Area

bookstores to make sure to capture a
supply of Virgil's "Aeneid" for this com
ing week. 1 am grateful for this effort
although deeply upset that our frosh
had to face this situation. This is why I
still want to lodge a public complaint
about the original mishap, which cannot
be corrected, and fire a warning shot
across the bow of the Bookstore. May
the publicizing of this unfortunate inci
dent help warrant that it will never
repeat itself again under his watch.
