Live from Stanford Uni
versity, where t he dagger
that indicates which
courses in the Courses and
Degrees handbook fulfill the
gender studies requirement
also represents Lorena Bob
hitt's tool of choice, it's week
two of me being out-picked and
out-prophesized by campus big
wigs who were probably oracles
in earlier lives. This week's
guest seer: Director of Athletics
Ted Leland.
After over a year of failing to
predict correctly the fate of the
Stanford football team, I can
actually say for sure for the
first time, with all certainty,
that I will be correct on my
prognosticating for the Cardi
nal this weekend. No doubt
about it, I'd bet my life on it.
My prediction: the squad will
have a bye this weekend and
won't play.
Colorado at Oklahoma
Youth and experience clash
this weekend in the Big 8 one
of the premier matchups in
what will become the premier
conference in the nation next
year.
Colorado, with young head
coach Kick Neuheisel at the
helm, invades Oklahoma, engi
neered by the archival master
of college football, Howard
Sehnellenberger.
If these guys were going to

play a game of football trivia or
VCR Quarterback, I'd probably
go with Howard. And if I were
betting on a game of one-on-one
basketball between the two, I'd
go with Rick's fresh legs. But
c'mon, we're talking about two
teams of over 100 athletes here,
and there are some other criti
cal variables to consider.
Colorado quarterback Koy
Detmer completely tore his
ACL last weekend, and if he is
even on the field in Norman,
he'll be playing pinochle on the
sidelines with a fourth-string
Colorado bottle boy. But his
replacement in last week's
game, John Hessler, ate Texas
A&M alive with three touch
downs and 177 yards in three
quarters and is sure to fill in
nicely for the injured Detmer at
Oklahoma.
The fact that the Sooners
racked up 560 yards and 51
points last weekend against
North Texas doesn't say much.
And when your backup quar
terback manages to score three
touchdowns, you know you're
playing against a defense that
couldn't hold Droopy the Dog to
under 200 yards on the ground.
Leland agrees. Hi' sees a dis
parity m the quality of the two
coaches' rosters. "The young
coach has too many athletes for
the old coach."

I his week begins the great

slide that can only end in the
return of'the Axe to the Stanford
campus in November.
Hut ( al is facing an Arizona
team that hardly resembles the
squad ranked No. 1 in the nation
by Sports Illustrated at the
beginning of last season The
"Desert Swarm defense has
been blown apart by a tactical
attack of injuries and gradua
tions. and tin 1 backs run like
they've got sand in their eyes.
I he Wildcats rank dead last in
the I'ac-K) in rushing, the first
time in eight years they have
been ranked lower than fourth.
behind makes his prediction
with only a twinge of reserva
tion: "I hate to count out those
(iolden Hears, but Arizona is
tough at home.'
Fortunately for the declawed

Wildcats, their passing game is
looking up Unfortunately, an
Arizona squad relying on it.- air

weekend, all Arizona will need is
12 guys in legal pads and hel

Washington at Oregon State
It's a pathetic state of affairs
in Corvallis, a town where a vic
tory against a Division I-AA
team to open the N' AA season is
like winning the national cham
pionship three years in a row.
Somehow the Beavers have man
aged to disappoint their fans, a
feat I would have thought impos
sible considering how accus
tomed the Beav faithful are to
being molested on the gridiron.
In a bold move of unparalleled
proportion, behind predicts the
upset "OSI is a better team
than the wa\ it has played, and
the Huskies have st niggled some
of late.
As far as I in concerned, the
Heavers will continue to disap
point And what's the best way

to disappoint fans that have
lived through 25 years of pitiful
football? Kasy. Continue to play
pitiful football the one year you
are actually supposed to be
decent. These fans are so used to
humiliation, they don't even
wear bags over their heads at the
games anymore. Instead, they
don't even bring their heads, or
the remainder of their bodies, to
the game. They stay home
and probably wear bags over
their heads there.

Arizona State at USC
Before the Sun Devils get beat
by Stanford next weekend in
Tempe, the squad is going to
take a little sojourn west to the
bowels of crime-ridden urban
Los Angeles and the Coliseum.
If the Arizona State squad
isn't mugged on the way into the
stadium, the team will certainly
be assaulted on the football field
by the Trojans.
USC outmatches ASI in
almost every position, and only
the elder Sun Devil quarterback
Jake I'lummer is a danger to the
Trojans' undefeated record.
Leland thinks that "the Trojans
of Figueroa have too much fire
power" for the dim Sun Devils.
While this game is al! but a
donation to USC's win column,
the Trojans shouldn't look this

gift horse in the mouth. Transla
tion for tin- I'SC players: don't
sit back on your fat wallets and
take the win 11k«* you were
accepting a gift 112 rom your junior
college coach.

Notre Dame at Ohio State
1 know I've said this before,
but I've just got to be right this
time. The Buckeyes will put the
Irish in its place and send the
squad running for its rosary. It
will take more than an end/one
prayer for Notre Dame to pull
this one out.
Wishing former Stanford Ath
letic Director and current Ohio
State AD Andy Geiger luck,
Leland prognosticates a Buckeye
victory. "Ohio State's new 'Cali
fornia Offense' will be too much
for Notre Dame in Columbus."
I've had about as much suc
cess picking Irish games in the
past as 1 would have actually
finding a practicing Catholic on
the Notre Dame roster. But as
the eternal optimist would say,
that only means that I'm well
overdue for a victory.
