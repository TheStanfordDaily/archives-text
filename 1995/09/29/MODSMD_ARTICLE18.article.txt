Live from Stanford Uni
versity, where t he dagger
that indicates which
courses in the Courses and
Degrees handbook fulfill the
gender studies requirement
also represents Lorena Bob
hitt's tool of choice, it's week
two of me being out-picked and
out-prophesized by campus big
wigs who were probably oracles
in earlier lives. This week's
guest seer: Director of Athletics
Ted Leland.
After over a year of failing to
predict correctly the fate of the
Stanford football team, I can
actually say for sure for the
first time, with all certainty,
that I will be correct on my
prognosticating for the Cardi
nal this weekend. No doubt
about it, I'd bet my life on it.
My prediction: the squad will
have a bye this weekend and
won't play.
Colorado at Oklahoma
Youth and experience clash
this weekend in the Big 8 one
of the premier matchups in
what will become the premier
conference in the nation next
year.
Colorado, with young head
coach Kick Neuheisel at the
helm, invades Oklahoma, engi
neered by the archival master
of college football, Howard
Sehnellenberger.
If these guys were going to

play a game of football trivia or
VCR Quarterback, I'd probably
go with Howard. And if I were
betting on a game of one-on-one
basketball between the two, I'd
go with Rick's fresh legs. But
c'mon, we're talking about two
teams of over 100 athletes here,
and there are some other criti
cal variables to consider.
Colorado quarterback Koy
Detmer completely tore his
ACL last weekend, and if he is
even on the field in Norman,
he'll be playing pinochle on the
sidelines with a fourth-string
Colorado bottle boy. But his
replacement in last week's
game, John Hessler, ate Texas
A&M alive with three touch
downs and 177 yards in three
quarters and is sure to fill in
nicely for the injured Detmer at
Oklahoma.
The fact that the Sooners
racked up 560 yards and 51
points last weekend against
North Texas doesn't say much.
And when your backup quar
terback manages to score three
touchdowns, you know you're
playing against a defense that
couldn't hold Droopy the Dog to
under 200 yards on the ground.
Leland agrees. Hi' sees a dis
parity m the quality of the two
coaches' rosters. "The young
coach has too many athletes for
the old coach."
