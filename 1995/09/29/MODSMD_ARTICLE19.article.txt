# Women's soccer to face nation's best
## Cardinal will battle Texas and top-ranked North Carolina this weekend 
### Bobby Cuza 
Three of the top 11 teams in the nation will be
on hand this weekend when the women's soccer
team hosts the 1995 Stanford Nike Invitational.
The 1 lth-ranked Cardinal will have its hands
full trying to extend its 21-game home winning
streak. Stanford will meet the Texas Longhorns
in a 2 p.m. match today, then clash with top
ranked and nine-time defending national cham
pion North Carolina at noon on Sunday. Santa
Clara, ranked No. 7 after last week's upset win
over the Cardinal, rounds out the four-team
field.
Stanford brings a 6-2-0 record (1-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) into the tournament com
ing off last Saturday's disappointing loss to the
Broncos. The loss, the team's second in three
games, came less than a week after Notre Dame
shut nut the Cardinal 2-0 at the Adidas/ Notre
Dame Invitational in South Bend.
"We're going to try to rebound as soon as we
possibly can," said head coach lan Sawyers. "We
need to get back to the level of playing that we've
established."
North Carolina, undefeated at 7-0 and ranked
No. 1 in the nation, stands once again as the
heavy favorite to win the national champi
onship, a feat which would run the Tar Heels'
string of consecutive NCAA titles to 10 The Tar
Heels boast a 98-1-1 record in their last 100
matches, including a 1-0 victory over the Cardi
nal last October at the Texas Challenge in Hous
ton. The Tar Heels have also outscored their
opponents this year by a combined total of 42-2.
North Carolina once again finds itself under
the guidance of head coach Anson Dorrance, who
has compiled an astounding 331-9-10 record (a
winning percentage of .960) in his 16-plus sea
sons at Chapel Hill. This year's squad is led by
junior forward Debbie Keller (11 goals, six
assists) and sophomore forward Robin Confer
(nine goals, three assists). Senior goalkeeper
Tracy Noonan has a 0.31 goals-against average
and eight saves in 585 minutes of work.
Texas, meanwhile, continues to work its way
through a grueling schedule. The Longhorns (3-
6-0) have lost four of their matches to top-25
teams, and the road ahead isn't getting any
smoother. Each of the team's next six opponents
is currently ranked in the top 25. Sophomore
