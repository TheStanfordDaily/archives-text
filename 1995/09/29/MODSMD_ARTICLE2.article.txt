# Students feel effect of grade policy
## Advisers encourage more caution as fall classes are chosen 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
As the much-anticipated new grad
ing policy takes effect t his fall, students
say the stricter requirements have led
t hem to be more conservative in choos
ing classes, a sentiment encouraged by
t heir advisers.
I'he Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter is t tying to ensure that students are
aware of how grading policy changes
will affect them by informing student
and faculty advisers and having them
pass on t he information to their advis
ing groups.

( hanges in the grading policy in
clude a four week grace period to drop
classes without the drop showing up on
the transcript, the return of a failing
grade, a six-week time limit to change a
class from a grade to P N(' and a star
on the transcript if a student decides to
retake a class. The new policy was
passed by the Faculty Senate in June
1994 and goes into effect t his quarter.
The grading policy change is being
explained in detail to all 112 reshmen, said
senior Heidi Hwong, head student co
ordinator for advising associates.
"Most people understand the basic
ouestion. A lot of people are not versed

with the details, however," said
Hwong. "They can come to us, and
we'll deal with each on a case-by-case
basis."
Senior Nisha Acharya, head AA for
Naranja, said that the personal contact
with advisers helps freshmen keep
things straight. "We sit down with the
frosh and make sure that they under
stand the deadlines and check up with
them to see that t hev are keeping up,"
she said.
Chemistry Prof. Daniel Stack, him
self an adviser, is doing the same for his
Chemistry 31 class. "I informed them
in the first lecture that the policy has

changed, and all of the important dates
are listed in the class calendar."
Acharya said the new system has
changed how she advises her students:
"I encourage them to try stuff out, but
I'm more conservative now. I tell them
not to take too much, to slow down and
start off easy. I don't want them to get
hurt by the system."
Acharya believes that the new policy
is stressful for many of the freshmen
and will influence what classes both
new and returning students will take.
But Stack feels that it will not sway
students much. "1 don't really
tlunk that it\> going to make that
much of a difference. Even if you
decide to drop after t he ninth week,
having a 'withdrawal on your
transcript is relatively painless."
Some students agreed, saying
that while tin- policy is an irrita
tion, it is not disastrous. "It makes
you more realistic," said junior
Mutsuko Yamada, a mechanical
engineering major.
"It's hard for 1 upperclassmen 1
who want to retake classes for their
major â€” it makes you careful,
said senior Mao-y I ran, an indus
trial engineering major.
Comparing the new policy to
the old, Hwong said: "It's a com
pletely different wav <>112 thinkinu

They're planning tilings more
carefully."
Advisers don't want to alarm
their students, but rather keep
them up to date, said senior Geeti
ka Agrawala, an AA. "I want to
make sure they understand, but I
don't emphasize that it's a real
change from the past, she said.
Acharya. however, .-.aid ."-lit' feels
the difference "I used to tell fresh
men that they could start with four
classes because they could always
drop Nov. I tell them stick with
three, even if it seems too little at
first."
Hut freshman John Stockton
doesn't feel too much pressure:
"I'm not really worried about it
vet. Once 1 get my grades, I proba
bly will."
Freshman Kddie Xagha is less
accepting. "We -liould be able to
drop classes any time we want. It's
a Stanford tradition."
