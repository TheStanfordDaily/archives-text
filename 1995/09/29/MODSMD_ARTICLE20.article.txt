# Spikers set to take on Arizona
## Volleyball in for a hot time vs. Wildcats and Sun Devils 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
One would think that after the
Stanford women's volleyball team
swept No. 7 UCLA and No. 19
USC in Los Angeles last weekend,
the race for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence women's volleyball title
would be No. 4 Stanford's race to
lose. Yet, listening to Cardinal
coach Don Shaw describe the
remaining portion of Stanford's
schedule leaves the frightening
impression that the race is still
wide open.
"These four [upcoming] games
could be the toughest stretch in
the conference," Shaw said. "We
have to play I No. 131 Arizona and
No. 151 Arizona State [today and

Saturday in Maples PavilionJ and
then go up and play I No. 91 Wash
ington State and (No. 17) Wash
ington on the road. All four of
those teams can beat you.
However, if Shaw is looking for
consolation, there is a veritable
plethora of places to find it First,
Stanford is on a roll. The Cardinal
(8-2 overall, 4-0 in the Pac-10) has
won five consecutive matches and
is coming off its first road sweep
of the Los Angeles schools since
1991.
"The sweep was great," Shaw
said. "It doesn't happen very
often, so it's nice to get it [when
you can |."
Whereas Stanford was plagued
by execution problems earlier in
the season, of late, Stanford

seems to excel in every phase of
the game, although rarely in all
phases at the same time.
"The team is doing a good job,"
Shaw said. "Against USC, we
played good defense, and against
UCLA we were doing well with
our offense and sideouts. We're
still not consistently performing
well in all phases of the game
though."
As Shaw was quick to point
out, however, the return of First
Team All-American and National
Freshman of the Year Kristin
Folkl will provide a boost to his
team. Friday's game against Ari
zona will be Folkl's first since the
national championship victory
over UCLA to end last season.
On paper, the 6-foot-2 sopho
more from St. Louis adds consid
erable firepower to an already
potent Stanford offense. Last
year, Folkl led the squad with
exactly 100 more kills than run
ner-up junior Marnie Triefen
bach.
"Kristin will definitely help,"
Shaw said. "As important as her
numbers is the fact that her pres
ence on the court helps our team a
great deal."
Though Shaw will play Folkl
this weekend, he cautioned that it
will take some time for her to
readjust to college volleyball after
spending the summer with the
Llnited States National Team.
"It will take her awhile to
establish her timing, especially in
hitting," Shaw said. "In the
international game, it's like tak
ing the next step. The speed of the
game is much faster, and she'll be
used to hitting a much higher set
because the international game is
much more of a power game."
Folkl returns to the Cardinal
at a time when the team is posting
some outstanding individual per
formances. In Folkl's absence,
senior setter / outside hitter Cary
Wendell has led the team offen
sively. Last year's NCAA Player
of the Year has been spectacular
so far this season despite missing
two games with a back injury
from which she has yet to recover
fully In the eight games in which
she has played, Wendell has regis
tered five triple-doubles, includ
ing an amazing night against
UCLA last Saturday in which she
amassed 22 kills, 47 assists (both
season highs) and 13 digs.
In addition, sophomore Debbie
Lambert came out of the blue this
season to light fireworks of her
own. The 6-foot-0 outside hitter
played the best match of her
career while essentially playing in
just two games against the Bru
