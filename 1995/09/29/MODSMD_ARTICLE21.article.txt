# Polo to gun for top teams
## 
### Paul Barr 
While classes have just .start
ed and most students aren't yet
concerned with exams, Stanford
water polo players are propping
for their own test of fire this
weekend. And although the Car
dinal season has a minimum of
two months remaining, the
team's post-season hopes may
very well hang in the balance.
Today's game against No. 6
UC-lrvine marks the beginning
of a crucial three-day, five-game
stretch for the No. 3 Cardinal (9-
1, 3-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation), during which it will
face off against some of the top
teams in the country
Following today's 3:00 p.m.
matchup at Stanford's own
DeGuerre Pool, the Cardinal
will travel to California, where it
will participate in the Northern
California Tournament tomor
row and Sunday.
While it might be a natural
tendency for Stanford to look
ahead to the tourney, where it
can move up in the rankings by
defeating top-ranked USC or
second-ranked Cal, head coach
Dante Dettamanti warned that
his squad can by no means over
look today's game against the
Anteaters (4-3, 1-2 MPSF).
"I feel that there are six
teams that could go to the
NCAA tournament," Detta
manti said. "All of those teams
are within two goals of each
other. Irvine is one of those
teams."
In order to best Irvine, the

Cardinal will have to focus its
defensive efforts on a trio of
Anteaters who have scored in
double digits. The Anteaters
have an effective attack from
the two-meter position, with
senior Matt Maunz and sopho
more Rvan Bailey combining for
25 points. Junior Omar Amr is
second on the squad with 12
points.

'I feel that there are
six teams that could
go to the NCAA
tournament. All of
those teams are
within two goals of
each other.'
— Dante Dettamanti

"They've got a good, solid
team," Dettamanti said. "They
usually execute fundamentals
very well and are in good condi
tion."
Masterminding this approach
is UC-Irvine head coach Ted
Newland, who is in the 30th year
of his tenure. Newland is a
familiar face to some Stanford
players, as he coached Cardinal
senior Josh Leachman and
junior Brian Wallin at the World
University Games this summer,
perhaps granting him some
extra insight into Stanford's
offensive attack. Newland also

has his own contingent of
Games veterans in Bailey, Amr
and senior Craig Watson.
Although a game is seldom
decided by numbers alone, the
Cardinal does hold the statisti
cal edge. Stanford boasts a
three-spot advantage in the
polls, as well as five more victo
ries and two fewer losses than
the Anteaters. And while the
Cardinal has played three more
games than Irvine, it is never
theless astonishing that Wallin,
who leads the team with 27
points, has accounted for as
much offense as the top two
Anteaters combined. As a team,
the Cardinal holds a staggering
offensive edge, having scored 60
more points than Irvine.
Nevertheless, it is clear why
Dettamanti expects a tough
game. A closer look at the
Anteater's record shows that
two of their losses came against
second-ranked Cal, a team
which handed the Cardinal its
only defeat of the year, while
the third was against fourth
ranked Pepperdine. In addition,
following the trend of tremen
dous parity that exists among
the top six teams this season,
Irvine beat the fifth-ranked
UCLA Bruins earlier in the
year.
Whatever the outcome of
today's game, the victor will not
have long to sit on its laurels.
Because of the rankings, Stan
ford will once again face UC-
Irvine in first game of the
critical Northern California
Tournament.
"Seeding in a tournament is
so important," Dettamanti said.
"Because of the parity among
the top six, and the sudden drop
off after that, the top two seeds
get a real advantage."
Speaking of the rather pre
cipitous decline of talent after
the top six teams, the second
seeded Cal Bears will open the
tourney against seventh-ranked
Long Beach State, a team Stan
ford dismantled in a 14-3 rout.
Thus, while the Bears will likely
coast into the second day of
play, the Cardinal will have to
battle.
Such matchups are important
because of the ramifications of
the tournament itself While the
NCAA Championships are still
two months away, the rankings
that are established after the
Nor Cal tourney may very well
decide which four teams are
accepted into the national cham
pionship round at the end of the
year.
"It is time for the guys to
start getting nervous," Detta
manti said. "The season is on
the line."
In its second contest, the Car
dinal will face UC Davis for the
second time this season. Unlike
the game against UC-Irvine or a
potential rematch with rival Cal,
the second go-around with UC-

Davis holds little drama. This
past weekend, Stanford and the
Aggies met in the Air Force
Tournament, with the Cardinal
posting a football caliber victo
ry, 17-7.
If Dettamanti's squad man
ages to play up to its seeding,
Stanford will most likely get a
chance to redeem itself against
Cal in the semifinals. Earlier in
the season, at the Southern Cal
ifornia Tournament, the Bears
grinded out a 7-5 win, taking
advantage of a lackluster perfor
mance by the Cardinal. The loss
upset Stanford from its presea
son position atop the polls and
landed the team in its current
slot at No. 3.
But after the Cardinal played
the first portion of the season
without team leader and All-

American Jeremy Laster and
endured injuries to key players.
Dettamanti feels that his squad
is finally at full strength.
"[today) is the first time that
we will have everyone back and
healthy," he said. "There are no
more excuses. We just have to
perform."
The Bears are led by sopho
more Brent Albright, who has
notched 14 points in seven
games to date. Perhaps more
important is the classic con
frontation between the high
powered Cardinal offense and
Cal's stringent defense, spear
headed by goalie Toby Dommer.
The Bears have allowed an aver
age of only 5.43 goals per game.
In 10 games this year, Stanford
has averaged just over 12 goals
per contest offensively.

Although Stanford players
would love to erase the memory
of their previous loss to Cal,
their true goals are slightly
more grandiose. Whether the
road to the championship goes
through No. 1 USC and its four
Croatian players, or fifth
ranked UCLA, which has
regained the services of its own
National Team member, or a
surprising Pepperdine squad,
one thing is clear. Dettamanti
and his team have one thing in
mind.
Just win.
"We would like to get a
chance at USC because we have
had some magic against them
over the years," Dettamanti
said. "But we just want to win
the tournament. If we win, we'll
be back at No. 1."

the two-meter position, with
senior Matt Maunz and sopho
more Rvan Bailey combining for
25 points. Junior Omar Amr is
second on the squad with 12
points.

'I feel that there are
six teams that could
go to the NCAA
tournament. All of
those teams are
within two goals of
each other.'
— Dante Dettamanti

"They've got a good, solid
team," Dettamanti said. "They
usually execute fundamentals
very well and are in good condi
tion."
Masterminding this approach
is UC-Irvine head coach Ted
Newland, who is in the 30th year
of his tenure. Newland is a
familiar face to some Stanford
players, as he coached Cardinal
senior Josh Leachman and
junior Brian Wallin at the World
University Games this summer,
perhaps granting him some
extra insight into Stanford's
offensive attack. Newland also

has his own contingent of
Games veterans in Bailey, Amr
and senior Craig Watson.
Although a game is seldom
decided by numbers alone, the
Cardinal does hold the statisti
cal edge. Stanford boasts a
three-spot advantage in the
polls, as well as five more victo
ries and two fewer losses than
the Anteaters. And while the
Cardinal has played three more
games than Irvine, it is never
theless astonishing that Wallin,
who leads the team with 27
points, has accounted for as
much offense as the top two
Anteaters combined. As a team,
the Cardinal holds a staggering
offensive edge, having scored 60
more points than Irvine.
Nevertheless, it is clear why
Dettamanti expects a tough
game. A closer look at the
Anteater's record shows that
two of their losses came against
second-ranked Cal, a team
which handed the Cardinal its
only defeat of the year, while
the third was against fourth
ranked Pepperdine. In addition,
following the trend of tremen
dous parity that exists among
the top six teams this season,
Irvine beat the fifth-ranked
UCLA Bruins earlier in the
year.
Whatever the outcome of
today's game, the victor will not
have long to sit on its laurels.
Because of the rankings, Stan
ford will once again face UC-
Irvine in first game of the
critical Northern California
Tournament.
"Seeding in a tournament is
so important," Dettamanti said.
"Because of the parity among
the top six, and the sudden drop
off after that, the top two seeds
get a real advantage."
Speaking of the rather pre
cipitous decline of talent after
the top six teams, the second
seeded Cal Bears will open the
tourney against seventh-ranked
Long Beach State, a team Stan
ford dismantled in a 14-3 rout.
Thus, while the Bears will likely
coast into the second day of
play, the Cardinal will have to
battle.
Such matchups are important
because of the ramifications of
the tournament itself While the
NCAA Championships are still
two months away, the rankings
that are established after the
Nor Cal tourney may very well
decide which four teams are
accepted into the national cham
pionship round at the end of the
year.
"It is time for the guys to
start getting nervous," Detta
manti said. "The season is on
the line."
In its second contest, the Car
dinal will face UC Davis for the
second time this season. Unlike
the game against UC-Irvine or a
potential rematch with rival Cal,
the second go-around with UC-

Davis holds little drama. This
past weekend, Stanford and the
Aggies met in the Air Force
Tournament, with the Cardinal
posting a football caliber victo
ry, 17-7.
If Dettamanti's squad man
ages to play up to its seeding,
Stanford will most likely get a
chance to redeem itself against
Cal in the semifinals. Earlier in
the season, at the Southern Cal
ifornia Tournament, the Bears
grinded out a 7-5 win, taking
advantage of a lackluster perfor
mance by the Cardinal. The loss
upset Stanford from its presea
son position atop the polls and
landed the team in its current
slot at No. 3.
But after the Cardinal played
the first portion of the season
without team leader and All-

American Jeremy Laster and
endured injuries to key players.
Dettamanti feels that his squad
is finally at full strength.
"[today) is the first time that
we will have everyone back and
healthy," he said. "There are no
more excuses. We just have to
perform."
The Bears are led by sopho
more Brent Albright, who has
notched 14 points in seven
games to date. Perhaps more
important is the classic con
frontation between the high
powered Cardinal offense and
Cal's stringent defense, spear
headed by goalie Toby Dommer.
The Bears have allowed an aver
age of only 5.43 goals per game.
In 10 games this year, Stanford
has averaged just over 12 goals
per contest offensively.

Although Stanford players
would love to erase the memory
of their previous loss to Cal,
their true goals are slightly
more grandiose. Whether the
road to the championship goes
through No. 1 USC and its four
Croatian players, or fifth
ranked UCLA, which has
regained the services of its own
National Team member, or a
surprising Pepperdine squad,
one thing is clear. Dettamanti
and his team have one thing in
mind.
Just win.
"We would like to get a
chance at USC because we have
had some magic against them
over the years," Dettamanti
said. "But we just want to win
the tournament. If we win, we'll
be back at No. 1."
