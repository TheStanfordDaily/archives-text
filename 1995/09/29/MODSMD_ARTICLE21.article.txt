# Polo to gun for top teams
## 
### Paul Barr 
While classes have just .start
ed and most students aren't yet
concerned with exams, Stanford
water polo players are propping
for their own test of fire this
weekend. And although the Car
dinal season has a minimum of
two months remaining, the
team's post-season hopes may
very well hang in the balance.
Today's game against No. 6
UC-lrvine marks the beginning
of a crucial three-day, five-game
stretch for the No. 3 Cardinal (9-
1, 3-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation), during which it will
face off against some of the top
teams in the country
Following today's 3:00 p.m.
matchup at Stanford's own
DeGuerre Pool, the Cardinal
will travel to California, where it
will participate in the Northern
California Tournament tomor
row and Sunday.
While it might be a natural
tendency for Stanford to look
ahead to the tourney, where it
can move up in the rankings by
defeating top-ranked USC or
second-ranked Cal, head coach
Dante Dettamanti warned that
his squad can by no means over
look today's game against the
Anteaters (4-3, 1-2 MPSF).
"I feel that there are six
teams that could go to the
NCAA tournament," Detta
manti said. "All of those teams
are within two goals of each
other. Irvine is one of those
teams."
In order to best Irvine, the

Cardinal will have to focus its
defensive efforts on a trio of
Anteaters who have scored in
double digits. The Anteaters
have an effective attack from
the two-meter position, with
senior Matt Maunz and sopho
more Rvan Bailey combining for
25 points. Junior Omar Amr is
second on the squad with 12
points.

"They've got a good, solid
team," Dettamanti said. "They
usually execute fundamentals
very well and are in good condi
tion."
Masterminding this approach
is UC-Irvine head coach Ted
Newland, who is in the 30th year
of his tenure. Newland is a
familiar face to some Stanford
players, as he coached Cardinal
senior Josh Leachman and
junior Brian Wallin at the World
University Games this summer,
perhaps granting him some
extra insight into Stanford's
offensive attack. Newland also

has his own contingent of
Games veterans in Bailey, Amr
and senior Craig Watson.
Although a game is seldom
decided by numbers alone, the
Cardinal does hold the statisti
cal edge. Stanford boasts a
three-spot advantage in the
polls, as well as five more victo
ries and two fewer losses than
the Anteaters. And while the
Cardinal has played three more
games than Irvine, it is never
theless astonishing that Wallin,
who leads the team with 27
points, has accounted for as
much offense as the top two
Anteaters combined. As a team,
the Cardinal holds a staggering
offensive edge, having scored 60
more points than Irvine.
Nevertheless, it is clear why
Dettamanti expects a tough
game. A closer look at the
Anteater's record shows that
two of their losses came against
second-ranked Cal, a team
which handed the Cardinal its
only defeat of the year, while
the third was against fourth
ranked Pepperdine. In addition,
following the trend of tremen
dous parity that exists among
the top six teams this season,
Irvine beat the fifth-ranked
UCLA Bruins earlier in the
year.
Whatever the outcome of
today's game, the victor will not
have long to sit on its laurels.
Because of the rankings, Stan
ford will once again face UC-
Irvine in first game of the
