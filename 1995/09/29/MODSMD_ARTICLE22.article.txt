## Men's soccer out to right an offense gone wrong 
### Daniel Kao Editorial staff 
There are big games, and then there are really big
games. For the struggling Stanford men's soccer
team (3-4), this weekend's showdowns versus Old
Dominion and Massachusetts are definitely games
of the significantly more massive variety.
After coming out of the starting blocks on fire
this season, capturing the title at the Wake Forest
Tournament, Stanford has cooled down consider
ably to say the least. A once graceful, efficient, pow
erful Cardinal squad has transformed into a sput

losing streak.
"We started off really well, winning the big tour
nament in North Carolina." said junior goalkeeper
Ryan Craig "But since then, we've struggled, and
morale has been real low."
The scoring has been low as well. In Stanford's
last five games, of which Stanford has dropped four,
opponents have outscored the Cardinal 14-3. This

lagging offense will he Stanford s main concern this
weekend. In hopes of jump-starting some of its
frontline scorers, the Cardinal will push its skilled
players a little further up the field. Other than that,
the name of the game is cashing in on opportunities.
"Things just haven't been clicking as well as they
were early on," said sophomore midfielder Eric Van
develde. "When we get opportunities, we need to
capitalize. We have to start putting our chances
away and get the hall to the back of the net."
If goals don't come for the Cardinal this weekend,
Stanford could be in for a long season. With confer
ence play just over the horizon, these matches defi
nitely fall into the must-win category.
"This is a make-or-break weekend," Craig said. "1
don't want to say that the whole season comes down
to this weekend, but these games are definitely sig
nificant. The onus is on us to win."
More precisely, the onus is on the Cardinal to
score. This fact isn't lost upon Vandevelde, Stan-
