# Start Diversions 95
## 
### 
Welcome to the new Diversions. Now let
me digress. Upperclass friends, do you
remember Freshman Orientation?
Gee, I sure do — seems like years ago, though
According to some, those were the best days
on the Farm: a whole week at Stanford with
out classes or homework. Go where you please,
do what you please. Orientation programs
(Faces of the 90s, Sex in the Community, etc.)
are "recommended but not mandatory."
Ah yes, there's me and all my little fresh
man chums running around happily, getting
to know each other, getting oriented. From
the first a cappella concert to MuFuUnSunAn-
Then Sum to the last a cappella concert, we
anticipated — nay, felt the full liberation of
our impending Stanford experience. And oy,
such nice weather Just like we'd read about in
"Approaching Stanford."
Well, as the first fiscal week of school draws
to a close, another Orientation fades away
behind us. That's right, kids, no more free
crackers in the Bookstore for you. And all those
over-excited OVs not overrun by overworked
Super Shuttle drivers relieving stress have
hung their red T-shirts up for yet another year.
New students settle. Old students return. And
as we are reunited, coming together in pursuit
of'higher learning, we find ourselves asking the
same question — not so much to seek an
answer, but because we feel we should:
"How wan your summerl"
Yup, from here on out, nothing's really
new. Or is it?
Welcome to the new Diversions. Sorry for
digressing.
"New?" you say. "But it looks the same."
Well, to be entirely honest — and after all,
why shouldn't we be? — to be entirely honest,
maybe we do look the same. We're in transi

tion. Like a few remote and seldom-traveled
or noticed areas of campus, this page is cur
rently under construction.
Ah, hut even so, look closer. You'll see us
moving in a new direction. Forward. Upward.
Sideways perhaps. Maybe a little to the left,
or right. Never back.
And so, humble reader. I offer the follow
ing pledge, a promise. A guarantee if you will.
In this volume of Diversions, you will not see
the tired jokes of Stanford lore. You know
what 1 mean, the cliched comments that cause
us to chuckle, lest we consider our own dis
comfiture (Ooooh, good word, "discomfi
ture"). You know, just like we'd read about in
"Approaching Stanford." Well who needs
that? Not us. Not you. No. Nope. Nada. Say
no more.
Well, all right. For you new kids on the
Farm (NKOTF), let's review just a small sam
pling. Here goes:
• Dating, as an institution, is rare at Stan
ford.
• Hoover Tower resembles the male repro
ductive organ, sheathed in a reservoir-tipped
condom no less It was erected in 1941.
• The food served bv University Dining
Service is not highly regarded by students.
• Service at the Stanford Post Office is less
than reputable. Lines are often long. Mail is
often late. Often pre-perused.
• Members of the Stanford community use
inane abbreviations for several campus loca
tions and landmarks. For example, "Chu" is a
silly-sounding shortening of the word
"Church," which, it may be pointed out, is
already only one syllable.
• Branner sucks. Get it?
• Etc.
Ha ha. Yeah, right. We'll have none of that.

Nope, you won't see any of that here.
The above mentioned are facts, more or
less. Not jokes. To be honest, there is nothing
inherently funny about them. Therefore, any
humor must be derived. Forced. Contrived.
This is below us.
Our mission, instead, is to explore Stan
ford. explore each other, explore the world
and find that which is innately fun and funny.
Natural humor. w " yyU Lh on
humor * htl mijtrivHd you UWj
>1 ready ifta iia.tihii pupa Please laugh.
But we'll go even farther than that. Like
the excavators in White Plaza, we want to dig
deep. There are questions out there, and we
want to find some answers.
"Gee, my summer was kinda okay sorta, I
guess."
No, we mean answers to the tough ques
tions. Can apathy really be a driving force?
Would the Reagan Library have changed us?
What do Stanford students really think about
the issues that matter most? And who cares?
What's love got to do with it?
Together, we will discover. I promise. And
after all, I'm not just the editor . . I'm also a
reader. (BaDumßum Tzzzzzch!)
So read, enjoy. Start your weekend off in
the right direction. And remember that Diver
sions is here for you. The name says it all.
"Diversions." It's everything you want to do,
it's everything you think you shouldn't do*
