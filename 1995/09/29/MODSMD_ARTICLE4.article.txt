In 1991, the University gave
$750,000 in interest-free loans to
Laurence Moagland, CEO of Stan
ford Management Company, as
part of a recruitment package to
bring him to Palo Alto.
According to The Chronicle,
more than two dozen colleges and
universities give out low-interest
loans to senior officials in order to
help with housing.
In addition, Shepard said Stan
ford faculty members and some
senior administrators ha\e access
to a housing assistance program
that offers moderate interest loans

and limited salary supplements.
In response to these kinds of
recruiting techniques, Congress
proposed legislation last year to
make a series of adjustments in
Internal Revenue Service regula
tions governing non-profit organi
zations.
According to Larry Morton,
director of Government and Com
munity Relations, one of these
adjustments would have prohibit
ed loans of any kind for "organi
zation managers," including "any
officer, director or trustee of an
organization, or any individual
having powers or responsibilities
similar to those of an officer,
director, or trustee."
Congress never passed the bill
something Morton attributes to
the fact that its language was
"much too vague."
