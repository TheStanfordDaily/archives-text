# Clusters get new upgrades
## 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
In addition to much of the ren
ovation and construction on cam
pus, a number of significant im
provements in residential com
puter clusters have greeted Stan
ford students.
Jeff Merriman, director of Res
idential Computing, said all clus
ters have received $225,000 in up
grades for computer equipment
and printing.
"We got rid of all the old 1 com
puters! and replaced them with
Power Mac 7100s," he said. "All of
them have 16 megabytes of RAM,
15-inch multiscan monitors and
('I) R()Mdrives
He also noted that all grayscale
monitors have been replaced with
color monitors.
In addition to the replacement
of obsolete computers, each clus
ter received a new Hewlett -
Packard 4M Laserjet printer. The
black Next machines and printers
have been removed, and a new
spooler system has been set up to
handle printing. Seven SunSparc
servers will handle print jobs
across campus.
Dane Spearing, assistant direc
tor of Residential Computing in
charge of networking, said the
new system will make printing
much more efficient and less 1 ike-
Is to be disabled for any significant
amount of time.
"Printing should be much
faster and at twice the resolu
tion," lie said. "Since the Suns are
mutually redundant, others can
take the place of any print spooler
that happens to go down, increas
ing the reliability of printing in the
clusters."
Spearing said only one of the
new print servers is currently
functional. He plans to have all
seven ready in a month, but he
said printing will not be compro
mised in the mean time.
"Students won't see a differ
ence in printing their papers, he
said. "In fact, having only one
server for all the clusters right
now demonstrates that the com
puters can support each other if
any one of them isn't working."
He added that he can move the
print load from a disabled server
to a working one in only a few
minutes.
Eric Schmitt, one of the resi
dential computer coordinators for
Florence Moore West, said he is
happy with the improvements in
the printing system.

" I he new printers are very
nice," he said " There used to be a
lot of backup in printing before,
hut once the spoolers come on
line, we should have almost no
problems."
Merriman said the I Diversity
replaces about one-third of its
installed computers each sum
mer, working around the sum
mer-session students and confer
ence attendees.
"We try to make sure no com
puter remains in the cluster for
longer than three years," he said.
He added that the Macintosh
Centrist's and Quadras will
remain in the clusters until next
summer when they will reach the
end of their three-year cycle.

About IHO computers were
replaced this summer, and about
90 more will be replaced next
summer.
Schmitt said be didn't see any
problem with continuing to use
the Centrises and Quadras in the
clusters.
"They're fine for most of the
stuff we're doing," he said. "We're
still running Word 5.1, and
they're fast enough that it's diffi
cult to tell the difference for most
things — especially telecommuni
cations, which is what most peo
ple do in the cluster."
According to Merrinvnn, the
cluster improvements were fund
ed by the reserve budget of Hous
ing and Dining Services. Mone\ is

put back into the reserve through
student room rent.
He added that Residential
Computing has come to depend
un the resale of old equipment
that has been phased out of use in
the I niversity
"We usually manage to recover
15 to 20 percent of tin- original
sale price of old equipment," he
said. ' This year, we expect about
$70,000 from resale.
Merrimap said they have no spe
cial arrangements with Apple or
1 lewlett
Packard, but that they do solicit gift
funds from corporations

ble IdnnationJ from Apple this
