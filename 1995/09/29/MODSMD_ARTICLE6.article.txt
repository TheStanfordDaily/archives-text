# Mommy Van brings comfortable care

Kevin sits on t he cushions in t he huge
van, staring mesmerized at the televi
sion .as Captain Hook and the ticking
crocodile battle it out. A crumbling
chocolate chip oatmeal cookie in one
hand and apple juice in the other, he is
far off in Nevetland. Suddenly, he re
members his responsibility and hops off
tin? seat, darting into the next room.
His mot her lies on an examining table
having her unborn baby's heart rate
monitored, and he looks nervously at t he
wires attached to her stomach. She
smiles at him and assures him its okay

"It's accessible, much more conve
nient and much less crowded than the
clinic," says Kay Daniels, doctor on the
Stanford Medical Center's first mobile
prenatal care unit, the Mommy Van.
I)aniels, currentlv t he only doctor for

t he viin, is ;in energetic and friendly
woman with a Star Trek pin on her doc
tor's coat. Today she brought the hatch
of homemade cookies which Kevin is eat
ing. Kexin is watching movies Daniels
brought with her from when her kids
were younger.
''We try to make it comfortable and
homey in here, even though it's kind of
cramped,'" she says.
The van is spot less and airy, and man
ages tn appear roomy even when two pa
t ients, four children, 1 )aniels and her as
sistant, 'Jennifer Kspinoza, are sitting
and standing around the television chat
ting.
The MonimyVan doesn't have the
cold feeling of a doctor's office because
Daniels and Espinoza often talk and
laugh with the patients. For privacy, the
van has two rooms with closing doors
where fetal heart monitoring and ultra
sounds are done.
Facli Thursday, the 36-foot-long

trailer sits outside of the Drew Health
Foundation, a public clinic in East Palo
Alto. Many pregnant women at Drew are
on McdiCal and are told to go to the
Stanford clinic if they need treatment
that Drew cannot provide. Drew now
refers some women to the van, and the
women set up appointments about a
week in advance.
"It's much easier to come here than
go to the clinic," Laura Barrera, Kevin's
mom, says. Barrera is being tested to en
sure that her almost-due baby's heart
has a healthy response to a buzzing noise
which Daniels uses to alert the baby.
"This kind of procedure couldn't be
done at Drew," says Daniels. "They
don't have the kind of sophisticated
equipment needed to do this type of test.
I Barrera 1 would have to go all the way up
to the Stanford clinic."
Daniels scans the graph of the baby's
heartbeat as it scrolls out of the ma-

chine. "Wow, is it active!" sht
exclaimed. "This kid won't calm
down!"
Barrera smiles. "It's supposed
to be due tomorrow," she says
"But I think next week. Kevir
wants it to be sooner."
Barerra finishes her test and

depart, he can't resist grabbing
just one more cookie. "Adios!"
calls Dr Daniels.
Barerra spent just a half-hour
in the van. "Usually it takes more
than an hour, with waiting and all
that, she savs of her clinic visits.
"The women here face many
different barriers like language
and transportation," says
Daniels "We want to bring high
technology to their communities
and make it accessible."
Many of the women who go to

Drew for prenatal care have chil
dren and .jobs, and some have no
car. It is difficult for them to take
the extra time to make the trip to
Stanford for an exam when Drew
cannot give them proper treat
ment, so women will often not get
the tests and treatment they need.
"Some women have asthma
and we need to make sure t hat t he
babv is getting enough oxygen.
Some women are worried because
they aren't feeling the baby move
much, or the baby is past, the due
date We can do tests right here to
see if everything's okav. says
Daniels.
Another problem is that many
of the women speak only Spanish
and sometimes have trouble com
municating with their doctors
Daniels and Kspino/a are both
bilingual.
"Clinics are doing a better job
with providing bilingual tare.
Sometimes the\ use translators,
but you often have to wait for
help. Ksnino/.a savs

The Mommy Van has been up
and running since Oct. 12, 1994
The van currently travels to Drew
for three hours Thursday after
noons. Daniels and Espinoza usu
ally see about seven patients each
week.
In the future, the van hopes to
travel to other clinics in Sunny
vale and Mountain View and
expand its days and times of oper
ation, according to Espinoza.
"We had some trouble in the
beginning making the communit\
aware that we were out here,"
Espinoza says. "But things have
been picking up lately, and our
schedule is usually pretty full
now."
Although the Mommy Van cur
rently provides only high tech
care to women, "we have a vision
to provide full blown prenatal
care on the van eventually," says
Daychin Campbell, a prenatal
program administrator at the
Stanford Medical Center.
Campbell says she hopes that

in the future, the van will follow
women all the way through preg
nancy, with gynecological and
general health tare alongside the
specialized testing which the van
currently provides.
now we're concentrat
ing on giving them the care that
they can't get near home, said
Daniels, who works on other out
reach programs through the Med
ical Center that attempt to bring
quality care closer to home

it easier for women to get care,
and to develop a more efficient
referral system for women who

"What we want to do is decen
tralize medical care and bring it to
people who don't have access,"
