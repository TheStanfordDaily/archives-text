Kevin sits on t he cushions in t he huge
van, staring mesmerized at the televi
sion .as Captain Hook and the ticking
crocodile battle it out. A crumbling
chocolate chip oatmeal cookie in one
hand and apple juice in the other, he is
far off in Nevetland. Suddenly, he re
members his responsibility and hops off
tin? seat, darting into the next room.
His mot her lies on an examining table
having her unborn baby's heart rate
monitored, and he looks nervously at t he
wires attached to her stomach. She
smiles at him and assures him its okay
he heads happily back to his movie
"It's accessible, much more conve
nient and much less crowded than the
clinic," says Kay Daniels, doctor on the
Stanford Medical Center's first mobile
prenatal care unit, the Mommy Van.
I)aniels, currentlv t he only doctor for

t he viin, is ;in energetic and friendly
woman with a Star Trek pin on her doc
tor's coat. Today she brought the hatch
of homemade cookies which Kevin is eat
ing. Kexin is watching movies Daniels
brought with her from when her kids
were younger.
''We try to make it comfortable and
homey in here, even though it's kind of
cramped,'" she says.
The van is spot less and airy, and man
ages tn appear roomy even when two pa
t ients, four children, 1 )aniels and her as
sistant, 'Jennifer Kspinoza, are sitting
and standing around the television chat
ting.
The MonimyVan doesn't have the
cold feeling of a doctor's office because
Daniels and Espinoza often talk and
laugh with the patients. For privacy, the
van has two rooms with closing doors
where fetal heart monitoring and ultra
sounds are done.
Facli Thursday, the 36-foot-long

trailer sits outside of the Drew Health
Foundation, a public clinic in East Palo
Alto. Many pregnant women at Drew are
on McdiCal and are told to go to the
Stanford clinic if they need treatment
that Drew cannot provide. Drew now
refers some women to the van, and the
women set up appointments about a
week in advance.
"It's much easier to come here than
go to the clinic," Laura Barrera, Kevin's
mom, says. Barrera is being tested to en
sure that her almost-due baby's heart
has a healthy response to a buzzing noise
which Daniels uses to alert the baby.
"This kind of procedure couldn't be
done at Drew," says Daniels. "They
don't have the kind of sophisticated
equipment needed to do this type of test.
I Barrera 1 would have to go all the way up
to the Stanford clinic."
Daniels scans the graph of the baby's
heartbeat as it scrolls out of the ma-
