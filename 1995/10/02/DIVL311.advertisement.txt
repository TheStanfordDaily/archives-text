Fee
Refunds
All registered students are eligible to apply for a whole or partial refund of
funding to student organizations. Please also be aware that by taking a
refund, you are indicating that you do not wish to support that group and its
activities, and that in fairness to other students who do support the group,
you should not take advantage of their services. Organizations like Legal
Counseling and Speakers Bureau receive a listing of student ID numbers
that request a refund, and may choose to deny services to those students.
Potential change: Pending Senate approval, refunds will be credited to your
University bill.
There are two ways to request a refund:
1) From your Leland e-mail account or any Stanford
Unix account.
At the prompt ("elainel2:>\ kk amy2> \ etc.) type:
telnet assu-serve 1234
and press enter. Follow the instructions.
2) From Netscape or a World Wide Web browser that
supports telnet.
Open the location:
http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/assu/
and select the Fee Refund button.
You may need to download NCSA Telnet before running the fee refund program.
