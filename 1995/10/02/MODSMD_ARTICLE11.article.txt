Oinar Abdel-Rahman and nine
other militant Muslims were con
victed yesterday of conspiring to
wage a holy war against the Unit
ed State* with a string of terrorist
homhings and assassinations.
Most of the defendants looked
on sternly, but one smirked and
another repeatedly yelled in Ara
bic, "Allahu Akbar!" or "God is
great!," alter jurors left the room.
Lawyers lor the defendants
said all will appeal.
The verdict concluded a nine
mouth trial that brought more
than 200 witnesses and hun
dreds of exhibits to a heavily
guarded Manhattan courthouse
patrolled daily by a bomb-sniff
ing dog.
Facing a rarely used Civil War

era seditious conspiracy charge,
the defendants were accused of
plotting to force the United
States to stop supporting Israel
and Egypt, two enemies of mili
tant Muslims.
The plot's centerpiece was a
plan to set off five bombs in 10
minutes, blowing up the I'nited
Nations, the Lincoln and Holland
tunnels, the George Washington
Bridge and a federal building
housing the FBI, tin l government
charged. Videotapes showed
defendants mixing bond) ingredi
ents in a garage just before their
arrest in 1993.
Yesterdays verdict came in the
second of three trials stemming
from the trade center bombing,
which killed six people, did $500
million worth of damage and mil

verized Americans' feeling of
security.
Four men were convicted last
year in the Feb. 20, 1993, bomb
ing and sentenced to 240 years in
prison.
The man accused of master
minding the trade center bomb
ing, Ramzi Yousef, is expected to
go on trial next year. He was
arrested in Pakistan this year
after two years on the run.
"II terrorism is theater, the
acts of terrorism planned by these
defendants was theater of the
absurd," James Kallstrom, chief
of the FBl's New York office, said
after the verdict. "In their own
demented way, they were going to
send the I nited States a message.
These verdicts return the favor in
the strongest possible language.
