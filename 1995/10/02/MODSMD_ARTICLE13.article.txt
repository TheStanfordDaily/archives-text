Admissions program may
he practical, but it is also
elitist and questionable.

N( )\V THAT THK freshmen
have settled in, it is time for
the University to begin
thinking about next year's erop of
students. It is time to begin review
ing the applications of prospective
112 reshman, making sure that they ;ire
the high-caliber students Stanford
accepts.
From year to year, there are very
few criticisms that can be made of
the admissions procedure. But
before the admissions committee
dive- into the process this year, it
must reevaluate its Presidential
Scholar- program.
This past year, there were a num
ber of changes in the Presidential
Scholar- program, including flying
scholars out for Stanford Admit
Weekend and awarding them a
$1,500 research grant. Although
these changes may not have been
solely responsible, there was a 10
percent increase in the number of
Presidential Scholars that chose to
matriculate this year.
The goal of the Presidential Schol
ars program is to help increase the
number of highly talented freshmen
that choose to attend the University.
From a practical viewpoint, the Pres
ident lal Scholars program makes
perfect sense. From a moral stand
point, however, the plan is unethical
and ill-conceived.
Theoretically, everyone admitted
into the University has an equal
right to be here. The letter sent out
to all accepted students not only
notifies them of their acceptance, but
reminds them that they are not a
mistake. Students admitted into the
University meet the academic and
personal criteria the University
demands.
The Presidential Scholars pro
gram, however, says otherwise. By
setting apart the top 150 candidates,
the University essentially establish
es an elitist atmosphere — whether
it wants to or not.

Fven more importantly, by giving
the scholars a $1,500 research grant
and increased faculty contact, the
University no longer treats its stu
dents equally. It is one thing to set
apart the top students in the incom
ing class, but it is another to give
them opportunities that other fresh
men do not receive.
Ideally, every student accepted
into Stanford should be on an equal
footing and be able to access the
many opportunities the University
provides. However, the Presidential
Scholars get an automatic first crack
at t hose opportunities.
Admittedly, the University is not
depriving other students of the same
opportunities. There are many
opportunities for students to obtain
research grants and study directly
with professors. It is just that stu
dents typically have to work for
those opportunities and do not have
them handed on a silver platter.
The Presidential Scholars deserve
the recognition given to them. How
ever, while it is certain that Presi
dential Scholar s have proven them
selves, they have excelled only under
the high school environment. Non-
Presidential Scholars could also
emerge as stars once they find them
selves surrounded by the resources
Stanford provides.
Since not everyone has the same
opportunities in high school, it
would be better if the Presidential
Scholars program only set apart stu
dents who have performed remark
ably well at Stanford.
Finally, by awarding the $1,500
research grant, students are effec
tively bribed to attend Stanford. A
student that is offered admission
into both Stanford and Harvard may
choose Stanford because of the lucra
tive financial incentive, even though
the grant can only be applied when
they begin research.
Stanford is not the only school to
offer such a program. Harvard, for
example, also sends out a notice to its
top admitted students, But while it is
true that Stanford needs to attract
the most talented students to main
tain and improve its academic repu
tation. the Presidential Scholars pro
