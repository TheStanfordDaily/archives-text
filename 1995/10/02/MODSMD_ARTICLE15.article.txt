# Campus viewpoint
## Hanno Sander Hey frosh, Branner RAs don't suck 
### 
STKVK. HANS,
(iautum, uh,
excuse me, what's
your name? I'm Hanno
Sander, and I'll l>e your
RA for (he year?"
With those first, words,
1 started my life as an
RA. No, wait. We actual
ly started training as I\As

two weeks before you frosh got here. As
with anything else, a true professional tries
to make his job appear as effortless as possi
ble.
Many of you frosh may think of RAs as
nothing more than doormen who go and
unlock the door when your room malt
locks you out — whether on purpose or
not. You upper-class people may have an
even less glamorous opinion of us But the
fact is, RAs go through .1 lot and jump
through more hoops tban Bill (iates at tax
time to be "your parents away from
home." So this column will try to demysti
fy the cloud of ignorance that shrouds our
noble profession as "residential educa
tors."
Some things we did tit integrate you mti
the Stanford community were obvious
the hand-crafted door signs, elaborate pic
ture boards, colorful welcoming posters and
staff memlx'rs who wore the look ofcxhaus
tion from memorizing all your names.
Yet, many of the ot her things we had to
go through to become your mentors away
from home are not so apparent, at least

not yet When we first arrived for our gru
eling two-week training session, we got a
huge [jacket I mean something that
looks like the transcript from the O.J.
t rial, scheduled with events that filled our
every waking moment from dawn to dusk
with fascinating topics like discussing the
grape policy for four hours to seminars on
creating "meaningful residential commu
nities." All this was done not to indoctri
nate us to some ideology, but to help
enhance the living environment you occu
py.
Admittedly, it was not as if we could not
be laid back and have fun with these ses
sions, where we worshipped Tommy
Woon's hair and Ann Porteus' wicked jokes
on Brainier for which we will soon wreak
revenge We loved these guys because they
excited us about our responsibilities and
focused us 011 the task at hand, building —
what's that again? — a "meaningful resi
dential community."
Those "silly games" or "boring semi
nars'' that we RAs all encourage you to
attend actually serve a purpose. Take
"Crossing the Line," a program in which
many frosh will soon lie able to participate.
Sure, it stalls out silly — we ask questions
about where are you from, schools, even
shopping preferences. But at the end, you
will ho|x'fully come away with a greater
understanding about our identities and
those of our fellow dorm mates.
Another activity we participated in as
part of our crack ItA training rein men was

the "group facilitation seminar." For sever
al days we discussed techniques for better
personal and group communication. Now,
as RAs, we are able to lead a discussion on
any topic known to man. We hope to lead
discussions in our houses that will intro
duce our residents to many different ideolo
gies.
And to understand more about RA staff
dynamics, we were left to perish on ;t moun
tain after our fictitious corporate helicopter
crashed. It was a true bonding experience as
we tried to save our rotten hides in time to
get back with only a four-quart cooking pot,
a rifle and snowshoes.
()f course, 1 have no doubt that my (lock
in Brainier will participate with full zeal in
all these activities. After all, Brannerites are
somehow specially selected by Res Ed based
on team spirit, aesthetics and knowledge of
exotic beverages.
But Branner should not be considered
the only star in the Stanford cosmos. In
fact, all frosh here in Branner are really no
different from the frosh in "lesser dorms"
such as Kmc and Donner. Sure, we have our
stellar athletes and scholars, but so does
everyone else on campus. That's what so
spectacular about Stanford
So there you have it — a quick rundown
on what we RAs had to do to get to be your
"parents away from home." I hope you all
appreciate this.

Hanno just loves his Branner frosh, it
seems.
