We need more PCs and fewer Macs on this campus

I CAN FKEL the (lames from here. But
I didn't come i<> Stanford just to chill
with the status quo — quite the con
trary, in fact. What status quo, you ask?
Well, let's start with the fact that there
are, statistically, no PCs available to stu
dents on this entire campus. That may he
because Macs are arguably the superior
option according to many. Nevertheless,
as a 35-year-old undergrad, I can attest to
t be harsh reality that once most students
leave the artificial environment of the
"Apple Core," they will be hit hard with
the reality that PCs are the most used
computers on the planet.
Sure, SI Ns, I )KCs and SGIs are found
en masse among various specialized
industries, and the Mac has a good
foothold in various publishing fields
'though not for long with the advent of
the;'),()()() Silicon Graphics Indv iinpend
ing).
The point is — and I'm sure that I'm
not the first crackpot to make this that
Stanford students are deprived of an
essential aspect of relevant education

about today's workplace by the pervasive
SAPP: Stanford-APPIe monopoly. It's
very nice that Apple has given so "gener
ously" to the Cniversity, and I'm certain
that it has not done so merely as an
attempt to hook users just like any other
corner pusher whose first trips are always
free — a la Microsoft giving away the
"free" Money program Yet., in a cult ural
ly and technically diverse world, the
absence of PCs might be considered, shall
we say, as chip-based discrimination.
Certainly, in a perfect world, we would
all run some version of an X-windowing
system, but we are not in a perfect world.
Kven so, the anti-Win9s mania is almost
as bad as the anti-OS/ 2 mania. Both of
these operating systems are marvels
OS 2 more so compared to PC operating
systems of five years ago. "They always
lock up." was the complaint my Mac
evangelist friend regularly voiced about
32bit PC OSes So when I first sat down
at the Tresidder Lair to teach Karel to
climb mountains, I thought, "Well, at
least I don't have to worry about a possi

ble lockup." Accordingly, 1 spent 35 min
utes teaching Karel it is a cute little
critter, ain't it? to scurry about with
out a thought of hitting "Save As."
Need I continue? Not only did the Pow
erPC- lock up in the middle of a very tricky
and processor-intensive " I)KKINK-NFAV
INSTRUCTION" procedure, but while
wait ing on the reboot process, I wandered
to the two other vacant Macs in my row.
Both had also locked up and were aban
doned! I wonder what these power users
had attempted to do. Maybe they had 17
different processes running like some X
windows junky and then tried to run a
program designed to estimate the odds of
Stanford ever allowing students to
explore alternate computing environ
ments. But I doubt it More likely it was
some unrealistic task like opening Kudora
or, heaven forbid, "DFFINF-NEW
INSTRCCTION I can't wait to call the
Mac-evangelist and tell him I've finalh
seen "The Light."
Of course, if he had Internet Phone on
a PC like 1 do, 1 wouldn't have to pav the

long distance charges. I've been talking to
in) family in Phoenix and San Diego for
free since I arrived on The Farm three
weeks ago. Sure, the program cost $60,
but t hat's only one month's phone bill for
many I think I'll call Mac Man collect and
put his name on MCl's "Friends" list.
According to some, I may have a silicon
chip on my shoulder. Yet, that does not
change the fact that few other institu
tions in this country that are better posi
tioned to begin integrating these Apple
and PC systems in an "inTaligent"
(compu-humor, there) manner tban Stan
ford
I hope that some readers will begin to
consider the potential value of providing
an opportunity for students to learn more
about the most prevalent computers in
the world bv increasing the PC population
in the clusters. If only two or three nodes
;it each cluster were PCs, I do not see any
big threat to the core of the Apple.
Or is that why there are no PCs?
