Stanford needs greater student / faculty
involvement in promoting an atmosphere of aca
demic integrity, says Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole.
In her exploration of innovative ways to
encourage student honesty at Stanford, Cole and
some of her colleagues arc turning to the Internet
as a possible forum for students who have com
mitted academic violations to share their experi
ences anonymously.
In a teleconference on academic integrity last
week, Cole mentioned that the electronic forum is
being considered as a method of dealing with some
Stanford students who recently violated Stan
ford's 1 lonor Code.
"We are considering using electronic news
groups on campus as a means for students with
violations to offer fellow students suggestions to
avoid similar violations," Cole said, referring to
what she called an increasing need to confront two

"especially prevalent academic problems at Stan
ford — plagiarism and unpermitted collabora
tion."
Such a preventative / educational strategy
"might provoke vicarious learning," she added.
Cole said she was inspired to pursue this peer
educational method upon reading a letter pub
lished in the California Aggie, a UC-Davis newspa
per, written by a student suspended for cheating,
who described the humiliation and regret he
endured as a consequence of his dishonesty.
Since students are often much more inclined to
listen to each other's advice rather than faculty
members or administrators, Cole added, learning
about the details of personal experiences might
discourage students from risking academic dishon
esty.
"They might say ' That could be me and then
not cheat," Cole suggested.
Although the actual effects of an on-line
approach will be hard to determine. Cole said she
thinks that the potential for students to learn
from their peers' experiences is great.
