### Matt Miller 
The Stanford men's cross coun
try team completed a Cardinal
sweep Saturday as it raced to victo
ry against a nationally competitive
field at the 22nd Annual Stanford
Cross Country Invitational at the
Stanford (Jolf ("ourse.
Teams from 23 different schools
descended upon Stanford to com
pete for the prestigious title,
including third-ranked Northern
Arizona and other national powers
such as Missouri, Texas, Utah and
Cornell. Pacific 10 Conference
rivals I'CIA and California were
also on hand, but the day belonged
to the men wearing cardinal and
white.
Stanford, ranked sixth in the
nation coming into Saturday,
edged Northern Arizona by four
points, .)( to 61 "A little too close
for comfort," head coach Vin
Lananna said with a smile on his
face, fully aware of the fact that to
knock off a powerhouse team like
Northern Arizona is a remarkable
accomplishment at any score.
Stanford and Northern Arizona
left everyone else eating their dust
The next closest competitor was
UCLA, which finished more than
100 points behind the leaders.
Utah and Azusa Pacific rounded
out the top five team scores Fres
no State had beaten the Cardinal
earlier in the season at the Fresno
Invitational, where Stanford ran
less than its whole team, but fin
ished sixth this weekend.
Cal's senior star Richie Boulet
captured the individual title, cover
ing t he 8,000 meters in a time of 24
minutes, 28 seconds, a pace of less
than five minutes per mile. In fact,
all of the top four individual racers
ran at a sub-five-minute-mile pace.
UCLA sophomore sensation
Mebrahtom Keflezighi took sec
ond-place honors for the second
straight year at the Invitational,
finishing in 24:32.
Junior co-captain Creg Jimmer

son was the top runner for the Car
dinal. crossing the finish line just
one second behind Keflezighi to
take third place. "I think I saved a
little too much because 1 wasn't
really sure how far along my train
ing was," Jimmerson said. "I was a
little bit too conservative, but
that's not necessarily bad. Boulet
and Keflezighi were the two guys I
expected to be up there. I thought I
could get one of them, but I still
feel good."
The race certainly proved the
importance of team depth in the
sport of cross country, as UCLA's
second finisher could only garner
19t h place overall, and ('al's second
runner was a distant 77th, elimi
nating each team from the overall
tit le hunt despite outstanding indi
vidual efforts 112 rom their stars.
Behind .Jimmerson came a 4-5-6
finish from Northern Arizona's
Tim Martin, John Howell and
Theo Martin UC-Riverside junior
Dan Reed led his team with a sev
enth place finish At that point, the
battle between the Cardinal and
the Lumberjacks for the team title
began to heat up.
Stanford's outstanding fresh
man twins, Brad and Brent Haus
er, finished eighth and 10th over
all, bookends around Northern
Arizona's Jama Bile, who took
ninth. Cardinal senior Mark Fadil
crossed the line in 11th place, con
firming the all-too-familiar cross
country adage that you are only as
good as your fifth runner.
The Lumberjacks held an eight
point lead after each team had its
first four runners across the line,
but Stanford's depth was too much
for Northern Arizona. Junior
Bryan Zmijewski rounded out the
Cardinal scoring by finishing 25th,
well ahead of the Lumberjacks'
fifth finisher Jim Cera, who could
only manage .'s7th place, far
enough behind Zmijewski to give
Stanford the four-point victory.
