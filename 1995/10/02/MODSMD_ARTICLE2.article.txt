## Programs scaled back, other funding found 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
Despite being denied funding in last
spring's ASS I' election, most student
groups that did not receive special fees
said their organizations are doing fine
financially.
Junior Eric Gavidia, station manager of
S( HN TV, said t he lack of special fee 112 und
ing from tin' student body hasn't really
changed the television station's outlook on
programming.
"It hasn't affected the ideas and heart of
SCBX, he said. "()ur primary function is to
support st udentsand organi/.at ions on cam
pus, and we have lot> of dedicated people
and talent helping us do t hat "
Last April, S< T»N TV. Redwood ( Kitdoor
Club, Shooting Star Productions, the Axe
Committee, the Stanford Hybrid Automo
bile Research Project and the Caribbean
Students Association were all turned down
for special fees in t he elect ion
Most of the groups have sought other
methods of funding to offset the 10.->.s of
ASS I special fees.
Craig Xajac, a graduate student in mate
rial.-. science engineering and chair of the
Axe ('ommittee, said his group part icipates
in a wide variety of act i\ it ies to raise money.

"We do a variety of manual-labor jobs for
(lie Athletics Department." he said "Our
big fund raiser is staffing Flicks, which runs
year long. We're always looking for things
to do."
Junior 1 )anny Zeibert, executive produc
er for Shoot ing Star Productions, which has
run a traveling children's theater in tlu l
past, said his group applied for annual
ASS I' funding, which requires groups to
have smaller budgets.
"We've also got a financial manager who
is applying for funding from community
groups, and we're applying for a grant 112 rom
t lu- California Arts Council to support some
of our activities," Zeibert added
(iavidia said SCBN is t urning to sales to
cover some of t heir costs.
"We're not allowed to sell advertising,"
he said "We receive minimal revenue from
a service that we provide to campus organi
zations, such as the Asian American Stu
dent Association fashion show. We film the
event for free, and we sell the tapes for $ 10.
It's a very reasonable price for students,
and we manage to cover some oft he costs in
buying the tapes and maintaining our
equipment."
On the other hand, the Redwood Out
door Club has (bund scaling back on activi-
ties the most effective method of
staying within their budget.
Clem Tillier, a graduate stu
dent in aeronautics and astro
nautics and director of Redwood,
said the group can no longer
spend as much money on leader
ship training and capital
improvement.-
"Before, we used to train lead
ers and buy a lot of equipment,
but not anymore, lie said. "Our
main focus is running outdoor
trips, and we've had to figure out
how to train our leaders less
expensively."
Although the lack of funding
has definitely affected the finan
cial outlook of these groups, they
all maintain that they are manag
ing without any real impact on
the quality or number of activities
they will conduct this year.
(iavidia said SCBN would con
tinue to offer six hours of pro
gramming daily In addition, they
will begin working directly with
the ASS I by airing "TeleKlicks,"
a series of 12 feature films
"We're going ahead with stu
dent programming," he said.

"Despite the setbacks we've had
we've still got to keep moving for
ward."
Zajac said the Axe Committet
is getting involved in even mort
activities now that it does not
receive special-fee funding
"The money we raise is oui
money," In? said. "We can put that
money toward several events,
whereas before almost all of out
funds went toward the one majot
event of the year, the Big (iamt
bonfire."
The Axe Committee is plan
ning to get involved in more spirit
activities this year, Zajac said,
including face painting, rallies
and a possible road trip to I S('
"We won't be cutting activi
ties," he added. "ASSC funding is
a nice perk, but if we don't get it
we just find another way to obtain
the money. We've got enough ded
icated people to help US."
Zeibert also plans to havt
Shooting Star Productions partic
ipate m more shows and improvi
sation workshops.
"Last year, we put on th<
Shooting Star Traveling Chil
dren's Theater This year, we ri
expanding into comedies and dra
mas on campus*, and we'll bt
doing some drama teaching ;it

local elementary schools, he said.
Tillier said the lack of special
fee funding would not affect the
number of outdoor trips conduct
ed by Redwood However, he
added that without organized
leadership training, his group
would suffer in the future.
"It's hard to tell at this point,"
be said. "It's not going to affect
the number of t rips right now, but
we're going to experience some
long-term effects We have abso
lutely no need for funds right
now, but this situation doesn't
allow us to expand
(Javidia agreed tnat lack of spe
cial-fee funding would affect stu
dent television due to lack of capi
tal improvements.
"Most of our equipment is
dated because we don't have any
money to purchase new equip
ment right now," he said. "When
we filmed the Fleet Street spring
concert, for example, you could
see the color difference when the
cameras switched angles. Some of
the singers ended up looking
greenish.
"The lack of funding has defi
nitely affected the quality of our

dent Association fashion show. We film the
event for free, and we sell the tapes for $ 10.
It's a very reasonable price for students,
and we manage to cover some oft he costs in
buying the tapes and maintaining our
equipment."
On the other hand, the Redwood Out
door Club has (bund scaling back on activi-
ties the most effective method of
staying within their budget.
Clem Tillier, a graduate stu
dent in aeronautics and astro
nautics and director of Redwood,
said the group can no longer
spend as much money on leader
ship training and capital
improvement.-
"Before, we used to train lead
ers and buy a lot of equipment,
but not anymore, lie said. "Our
main focus is running outdoor
trips, and we've had to figure out
how to train our leaders less
expensively."
Although the lack of funding
has definitely affected the finan
cial outlook of these groups, they
all maintain that they are manag
ing without any real impact on
the quality or number of activities
they will conduct this year.
(iavidia said SCBN would con
tinue to offer six hours of pro
gramming daily In addition, they
will begin working directly with
the ASS I by airing "TeleKlicks,"
a series of 12 feature films
"We're going ahead with stu
dent programming," he said.

"Despite the setbacks we've had
we've still got to keep moving for
ward."
Zajac said the Axe Committet
is getting involved in even mort
activities now that it does not
receive special-fee funding
"The money we raise is oui
money," In? said. "We can put that
money toward several events,
whereas before almost all of out
funds went toward the one majot
event of the year, the Big (iamt
bonfire."
The Axe Committee is plan
ning to get involved in more spirit
activities this year, Zajac said,
including face painting, rallies
and a possible road trip to I S('
"We won't be cutting activi
ties," he added. "ASSC funding is
a nice perk, but if we don't get it
we just find another way to obtain
the money. We've got enough ded
icated people to help US."
Zeibert also plans to havt
Shooting Star Productions partic
ipate m more shows and improvi
sation workshops.
"Last year, we put on th<
Shooting Star Traveling Chil
dren's Theater This year, we ri
expanding into comedies and dra
mas on campus*, and we'll bt
doing some drama teaching ;it

local elementary schools, he said.
Tillier said the lack of special
fee funding would not affect the
number of outdoor trips conduct
ed by Redwood However, he
added that without organized
leadership training, his group
would suffer in the future.
"It's hard to tell at this point,"
be said. "It's not going to affect
the number of t rips right now, but
we're going to experience some
long-term effects We have abso
lutely no need for funds right
now, but this situation doesn't
allow us to expand
(Javidia agreed tnat lack of spe
cial-fee funding would affect stu
dent television due to lack of capi
tal improvements.
"Most of our equipment is
dated because we don't have any
money to purchase new equip
ment right now," he said. "When
we filmed the Fleet Street spring
concert, for example, you could
see the color difference when the
cameras switched angles. Some of
the singers ended up looking
greenish.
"The lack of funding has defi
nitely affected the quality of our
work." he added "If you have a
shodd\ piece of equipment, you II
end uo with a shoddv uroduct."
Despite being denied funding in last
spring's ASS I' election, most student
groups that did not receive special fees
said their organizations are doing fine
financially.
Junior Eric Gavidia, station manager of
S( HN TV, said t he lack of special fee 112 und
ing from tin' student body hasn't really
changed the television station's outlook on
programming.
"It hasn't affected the ideas and heart of
SCBX, he said. "()ur primary function is to
support st udentsand organi/.at ions on cam
pus, and we have lot> of dedicated people
and talent helping us do t hat "
Last April, S< T»N TV. Redwood ( Kitdoor
Club, Shooting Star Productions, the Axe
Committee, the Stanford Hybrid Automo
bile Research Project and the Caribbean
Students Association were all turned down
for special fees in t he elect ion
Most of the groups have sought other
methods of funding to offset the 10.->.s of
ASS I special fees.
Craig Xajac, a graduate student in mate
rial.-. science engineering and chair of the
Axe ('ommittee, said his group part icipates
in a wide variety of act i\ it ies to raise money.

"We do a variety of manual-labor jobs for
(lie Athletics Department." he said "Our
big fund raiser is staffing Flicks, which runs
year long. We're always looking for things
to do."
Junior 1 )anny Zeibert, executive produc
er for Shoot ing Star Productions, which has
run a traveling children's theater in tlu l
past, said his group applied for annual
ASS I' funding, which requires groups to
have smaller budgets.
"We've also got a financial manager who
is applying for funding from community
groups, and we're applying for a grant 112 rom
t lu- California Arts Council to support some
of our activities," Zeibert added
(iavidia said SCBN is t urning to sales to
cover some of t heir costs.
"We're not allowed to sell advertising,"
he said "We receive minimal revenue from
a service that we provide to campus organi
zations, such as the Asian American Stu
dent Association fashion show. We film the
event for free, and we sell the tapes for $ 10.
It's a very reasonable price for students,
