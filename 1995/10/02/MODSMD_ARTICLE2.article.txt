Despite being denied funding in last
spring's ASS I' election, most student
groups that did not receive special fees
said their organizations are doing fine
financially.
Junior Eric Gavidia, station manager of
S( HN TV, said t he lack of special fee 112 und
ing from tin' student body hasn't really
changed the television station's outlook on
programming.
"It hasn't affected the ideas and heart of
SCBX, he said. "()ur primary function is to
support st udentsand organi/.at ions on cam
pus, and we have lot> of dedicated people
and talent helping us do t hat "
Last April, S< TÂ»N TV. Redwood ( Kitdoor
Club, Shooting Star Productions, the Axe
Committee, the Stanford Hybrid Automo
bile Research Project and the Caribbean
Students Association were all turned down
for special fees in t he elect ion
Most of the groups have sought other
methods of funding to offset the 10.->.s of

Craig Xajac, a graduate student in mate

year long. We're always looking for things
to do."
Junior 1 )anny Zeibert, executive produc
er for Shoot ing Star Productions, which has
run a traveling children's theater in tlu l
past, said his group applied for annual
ASS I' funding, which requires groups to
have smaller budgets.
"We've also got a financial manager who
is applying for funding from community
groups, and we're applying for a grant 112 rom
t lu- California Arts Council to support some
of our activities," Zeibert added
(iavidia said SCBN is t urning to sales to
cover some of t heir costs.
"We're not allowed to sell advertising,"
he said "We receive minimal revenue from
a service that we provide to campus organi
zations, such as the Asian American Stu
dent Association fashion show. We film the
event for free, and we sell the tapes for $ 10.
It's a very reasonable price for students,
and we manage to cover some oft he costs in
buying the tapes and maintaining our
equipment."
