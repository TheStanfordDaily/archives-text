# Cobb wins second straight race

### Matt Miller 
With all due respect to Web
ster's Dictionary, perhaps there
should be a picture of the Stan
ford women's cross country
team next to the definition of
"dominate." That is, of course, if
anyone can possibly catch up
with them to snap the photo.
On a picture-perfect Saturday
at the Stanford Golf Course, the
Cardinal runners played the role
of ungracious hosts as they
crushed the heavy competition
at the 22nd Annual Stanford
Cross Country Invitational.
With all of its top runners
running together lor the first
time this season, the Cardinal
dominated the race from start to
finish, beating fifth-ranked
Arkansas by 29 points. Stanford
finished with 28 points to
Arkansas' 57, No. 29 Missouri's
154 and No. 30 UC- Irvine's 1 73.
Pacific 10 Conference rivals Cal
ifornia and UCLA finished with
182 and 230, respectively.
Freshman Mary Cobb raced
to her second straight individual
title, making her two-for-two in
her collegiate career. Last week
end she took first place at the
Washington Invitational in
Seattle. On Saturday, Cobb
cruised through the 5,000 meter
course in 17 minutes, 10 sec
onds, edging Arkansas senior
star Megan Flowers by six sec
onds.
"We totally dominated, " Cobb
said. "1 think we all knew we
were in really good shape and
that we had trained well, but I
don't know that we were expect
ing to do this well. We pulled
together so well today, it was
great."
The Cardinal strategy of
dividing up the top Arkansas
runners worked virtually with
out a flaw, as sophomores Sarna
Ren fro and Kortney Dunscombe
and junior Monal Chokshi man
aged to separate Flowers from

the rest of her teammates.
Renfro finished third with a
time of 17:25, followed by Chok
shi at 17:30. Dunscombe crossed
the finish line at 17:43, good
enough for seventh place and
three seconds ahead of the sec
ond Arkansas runner, Kelly
Cook.
Junior captain Ann Sheehy
rounded out the scoring for the
Cardinal, finishing 13th. In
cross country, the overall places
of each team's top five finishers
are added together to create the
team score.
Seven Stanford runners fin
ished in the top 20, and no one
performed any worse than 55th
in the highly competitive field of
162 runners. In all, 22 colleges
and universities competed.
Arkansas' Flowers set the
pace early, taking a 14-second
lead over the pack for the first
mile, but she could not shake
Cobb, who narrowed the gap to
three seconds during the second
mile. Cobb finally overtook the
Razorhack senior for good with
about 900 meters remaining.
The defining section of the
course was the long hill which
starts a mile and a quarter into
the race. "As I was going up the
hill, I kept passing more and
more Arkansas runners," Chok
shi said. "That's what I new
assistant| coach IBeth Alford-)
Sullivan told us to do - work up
the hill â€” and she was right.
That's where we totally domi
nated."
Stanford proved to everyone
that cross country is indeed a
team sport. Renfro felt the bene
fits of having the entire team
ru n.
"It was a really exciting team
race," she said. "It helped a lot
to run with Kortney and Mary.
During the race, having our
whole team there just made the
biggest difference."
