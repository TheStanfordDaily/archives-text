Things turned ugly in a hurry
yesterday afternoon for the Stan
lord women's soccer team. Mired
in a second-half scoreless tie
against top-ranked North Caroli
na (10-0-0), the Cardinal (7-3-0)
surrendered three goals in a span
of less than four minutes as the
Tar Heels snapped the Stanford's
2'2-game home winning streak
wit h a 3-0 victory.

iNeariy z,uuu tans snowed up at
Harry Maloney Field to watch the
marquee matchup of this week
end's Stanford Nike Invitational.
For 67-plus minutes, they
watched the two teams battle
evenly, with only five shots taken
on goal in the first half, three of
them by North Carolina. But after
containing the Tar Heels' offen
sive attack for a period and a half,
the dam suddenly broke midway
through the second half .
"We were outstanding in the
first half." said head coach lan
Sawyers, "but three defensive
breakdowns, three lapses of con
centration, and boom."
It took exactly three minutes
and 32 seconds for the nine-time
defending national champion Tar
11 eels to blow the game wide open,
erasing what was an otherwise
inspired performance by the Car
dinal. North Carolina's Robin

i onler, trie team s second-leading
scorer, broke the scoreless tie 22
minutes, 40 seconds into the sec
ond half with a shot past fresh
man goalkeeper Erin Bryla Two
minutes and 43 seconds later,
freshman midfielder Tiffany
Roberts dribbled in from the left
side and booted one past the
sprawling Bryla to put the Tar
Heels up 2-0, just 49 seconds
before Debbie Keller's header net
ted North Carolina a .'5-0 lead.
"I'm disappointed," said senior
defender Jessica Fischer. "We
were 20 minutes away, and then a
live-minute spell, and we're gone.
We just broke down, giving a few
kicks away, giving a few throws
away. Other than that we played
really well."
The Cardinal squandered a
golden opport unity to take control
of the match in the 64th minute,
when a flurry of kicks on goal
failed to produce a score. "That
would have been tremendous,"
Sawyers said of the missed oppor
tunity. "It would have been a nice
one to have to put some pressure
on them.
"I'm veiy competitive, so of
course I'm never happy when we
lose. But I'm delighted with the
positive things. We played one of
the best games we played this
year. For huge portions of this
game, we outplayed the national
champions."
Sunday's loss extended North
Carolina's dominance over the
Cardinal. The far Heels now
boast a 4-0-1 lifetime mark
against Stanford, including last
year's 1-0 win at the Texas Chal
lenge in Houston. Tar I leels oppo
nents have mustered a combined
total of only two goals this year to
North Carolina's 18.
In Friday afternoon's match
against Texas, Sawyer's squad
simply followed the lead of senior
midfielders Dena Dey and Carmel
Murphy, who each registered a
goal and an assist apiece in a 3-0
victory.
The Cardinal dominated the
contest throughout, outshooting
the Ijonghorns IH-4, including a
12-2 margin in the second half.
Bryla made one save en route to
her sixth shutout of the season.

28:35 into the first half when she

and Murphy. Freshman midfield-
