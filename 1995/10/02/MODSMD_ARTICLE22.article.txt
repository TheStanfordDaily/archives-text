Competing at full strength for
t lie first time this season, the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball team
( 10-2 overall, 6-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference) scratched and clawed
its way to victories over No. 15 Ari
zona State (8-3, 2-3) and No. 13
Arizona (9-3, 1-3) this weekend at
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
moved into sole possession of first
place in the Pac-10 Saturday night
after defeating the Sun Devils 1.1-
13, 15-12, 15-7. On Friday, Stan
ford downed the Wildcats 15-13,
15-11. 15-9.
Saturday's game included a pre
game ceremony in which Stan
lord's 1991 nat ional championship
banner was unfurled from the
rafters atop Maples Pavilion. The
crowd of 1,620, consisting mostly

of alumni, saluted members of last
year's squad, 13 of whom remain
on the team this season. Anne
Wicks, captain of the 1994 team
and one of only two graduated
seniors, was also in attendance.
Following the ceremony, the
1995 squad celebrated in style,
sweeping the Sun Devils in three
games. Stanford dominated game
three. The taller, more talented
Cardinal firmly established itself
at the net. Stanford's blockers
repeatedly scored points or insti
gated errors from ASU hitters,

leading to a 15-7 victory that
clinched the match.
Stanford scored the first five
points of the game, getting two of
them off blocks. After the Sun
Devils cut the advantage to 5-2,
the Cardinal reeled off six straight
points to take an 11-2 lead. Stan
ford's effectiveness at the net per
sisted, as the Cardinal used three
blockers to score and to force an
unusually high number of hitting
errors from ASU. The Sun Devils


Senior Marnie Triefenbach bumps a pass to awaiting teammates in
a three-game sweep of the Arizona State Sun Devils.
