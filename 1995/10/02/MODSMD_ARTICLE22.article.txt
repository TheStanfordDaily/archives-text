Arizona 13 11 9

Competing at full strength for
t lie first time this season, the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball team
( 10-2 overall, 6-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference) scratched and clawed
its way to victories over No. 15 Ari
zona State (8-3, 2-3) and No. 13
Arizona (9-3, 1-3) this weekend at
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
moved into sole possession of first
place in the Pac-10 Saturday night
after defeating the Sun Devils 1.1-
13, 15-12, 15-7. On Friday, Stan
ford downed the Wildcats 15-13,
15-11. 15-9.
Saturday's game included a pre
game ceremony in which Stan
lord's 1991 nat ional championship
banner was unfurled from the
rafters atop Maples Pavilion. The
crowd of 1,620, consisting mostly

of alumni, saluted members of last
year's squad, 13 of whom remain
on the team this season. Anne
Wicks, captain of the 1994 team
and one of only two graduated
seniors, was also in attendance.
Following the ceremony, the
1995 squad celebrated in style,
sweeping the Sun Devils in three
games. Stanford dominated game
three. The taller, more talented
Cardinal firmly established itself
at the net. Stanford's blockers
repeatedly scored points or insti
gated errors from ASU hitters,

leading to a 15-7 victory that
clinched the match.
Stanford scored the first five
points of the game, getting two of
them off blocks. After the Sun
Devils cut the advantage to 5-2,
the Cardinal reeled off six straight
points to take an 11-2 lead. Stan
ford's effectiveness at the net per

blockers to score and to force an
unusually high number of hitting
errors from ASU. The Sun Devils

The relative ease with which
Stanford took game three was the

affair, with hitting errors from
Stanford keeping the Sun Devils
in the game. Trailing 6-4, the
Cardinal scored nine of the next
10 points, including a stretch <>112

lead. After five consecutive points
from ASI cut Stanford's lead to
one, Stanford's blockers forced

"None of these games (in the

Friday's match against the

Shaw put it. Stanford was "total

1995 debut for Stanford was an
inauspicious one, as she had
nearly twice as many hitting
errors (seven) as kills (four).
"Kristin's not there vet."

Shaw said. "She'll be all right
once her timing comes back, but
she's under unbelievable pres
sure. After playing with the
national team, she comes back
here and every time she touches
the ball, everyone expects a kill
The key substitution of the
match came when Shaw replaced
Folkl with Hromadka. The 6-foot
-0 outside hitter from Pacific Pal
isades, after struggling with her
passing early in game one, played
brilliant!} in games two and three
to finish with 10 kills and six digs.
In addition, Stanford seemed to
play better as a team with Hro
madka back on the court.
"Wendy and | sophomore |
Paula [McNameel came in and
played really well," Shaw said.
" That's the joy of having such
depth on the bench. We can
always run fresh players in the
lineup, and we're not in too much
trouble if any one player is having
an off night."
()ne player who never seems to
have an off-night is Wendell, who
registered her sixth triple-double
of the season and led a dramatic
comeback in game two. After
struggling to take game one 15-
l.'i, Stanford found itself behind
11-4 in the second. Wendell hit
.522 for the match on her way to
13 kills, 29 assists and 12 digs.
"It was another great come
back,'' Shaw said. "We're just not
firing on all cylinders yet, so we
can't seem to avoid falling behind
at times. Our execution keeps
improving, though, and we know
we will play a lot better later in
the season."
Game three featured some
controversy, as a disputed touch
ing-the net call against the Wild
cats gave the Cardinal a 9-6 lead.
Arizona coach David Rubio
argued vociferously, forcing ref
eree Mickey Matthews to give
bun two yellow cards and a red
card The red card gave Stanford
a point and a 10-6 lead. The Wild
cats seemed to let down after
that, and the Cardinal cruised to
a 15-9 victory to clinch the
match.
Arizona senior Barbara Hell
increased her league-leading kills
total to 206 with 14 kills against
Stanford. For the match, Hell hit

Following the ceremony, the
1995 squad celebrated in style,
sweeping the Sun Devils in three

Cardinal firmly established itself
at the net. Stanford's blockers
repeatedly scored points or insti

leading to a 15-7 victory that
