able, but the Cardinal did not relent.
Stanford head coach Colin Lindores described the
play in the second half as "helter skelter and not the
type of soccer I coach or like to see played." I lowever the
urgency with which the Cardinal played in the second
half helped it master the momentum and smack Mas

Stanford sophomore Eric Vandevelde immediately
went to work on the psyche of the Massachusetts
defender guarding him a* the second half commenced.
