# Missing Stern bikes returned
## 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
Some of the dozen students
whose bikes disappeared from
Stern storage this summer are
cruising campus again, but for
others, walking remains the pri
mary means of transportation.
Farlier last week, seven stu
dents reported their bikes missing
from the Stern summer storage
area a number which has now
increased to between 10 and 12,
according to Henna Ross, admin
istrative services manager at
Housing Facilities and Services
As of Friday afternoon, Ross
said, "there were about 10 to 15
unclaimed bikes left in the stor
age- area We have taken invento
ry, and we're trying to match It he
remaining bikesl to their owners.
Hopefully, somebody may have
just taken the wrong bike."
Stern llall was renovated this
summer as part of the Capital
Improvement Program, a 12-year
program designed to refurbish all
the major undergraduate and
graduate residences on campus.
The hike.- were stored this sum

mer in the Twain basement under
the University's summer storage
program.
Although the University
secured the storage area with a
fence prior to the construction,
the contractors still had to enter
into that area to make the neces
sary renovations, Ross explained.
In fact, the contractors, not the
University, will assume responsi
bility for the missing bikes, she
said.
Everyone is working together
to find tin- hikes, she explained
"The contractors are making a
good effort to help us," she said
Ross said on Friday that by
today the Housing Facilities and
Services Office "will have put
together a statement to help the
students know the next action
I they should) take" regarding
their bikes.
Ross assured that the students
would not be inconvenienced in
any way, explaining that every
student who needed a bike has
been issued a replacement hike
for now.
However, sophomore Josh
Koons said that he's "still walk

ing " Koons said hi' was supposed
to hear something by Friday
about his hike but did not receive
a call.
"I'm still waiting to hear from
them," he said. "Ill probably call
them" today.
Although Koons recognized
that "these things do happen," he
said he was still not happy with
the way the situation has been
handled.
"I'm a little disappointed with
the speed |of the investigation!,"
he said "It's been over a week,
and it seems by now that they
should have figured this out."
Though Ross was not available
to answer Koons' concerns, she
said Friday that Housing Facili
ties and Services officials have
located "about four bikes"
throughout the past week.
Ross also explained that she
understands the urgency of the
matter, noting that for a Stanford
student, "being without your hike
is like being without your car."
She said she was confident that
"there would be complete |stu
dentl satisfaction" regarding this
matter
