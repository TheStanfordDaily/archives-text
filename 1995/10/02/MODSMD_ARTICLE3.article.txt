## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
According to some of the coun
try's experts on academic integrity
and dishonesty, cheating remains
"a major problem in higher educa
tion."
The discussion was broadcast
live Friday to 105 North American
universities from Ohio's Howling
(ireen State 1 Diversify Sitting on
a panel of six scholars well-versed
in the history and current status
of cheating on college campuses,
Stanford -Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally ('ole emphasized t he encour
aging discrepancy between rates
of cheating at schools with and
without honor codes.
Even though exams at schools
with honor codes must be unproc
tored. Cole said, the premise that
"trust begets trustworthiness"
holds t rue at a promising rate.
Rutgers University Prof. Don
ald McOabe another member of
the live panel discussing "Academ
ic Integrit> The Truth of the Mat
ter" offered statistical support
for ('ole's observation. ('iting a se
ries of studies he conducted be
tween 1990 and 1994, McC'ahesaid
that approximately 57 percent of
students ;it schools with honor
codes admit to having cheated at
least once in their college careers.

versus 78 to 87 percent at schools
wit bout honor codes.
Although most panel members
agreed that honor codes tend l<>
foster comnumicat ion and respect
between faculty and students,
they also noted that a code "is not
a panacea, citing the question
able reliability of self-reporting
and the low rate of students re
porting fellow students as issues
t hat need (<> he addressed.
In an interview yesterday, ('ole
said, "Stanford's honor code has a
very low profile compared to
other institutions affiliated with
t he Center for Academic Integrity,
a consortium of over 70 colleges
and universities in the I'nited
States and C anada of which ('ole is
currently theexecutive director
"There is virtually no educa
tion on and prevention |of cheat
ing at Stanford |, ( ole said.
"About 98 percent of the t line, ,-t u
dent misconduct is resolved
through an administrative process
behind closed doors
In order for an honor code to
work, Cole stressed, students and
faculty must be thoroughly in
volved in the format ion of policies
and the exchange of suggestions
for improvements in discouraging
academic dishonest\
Such interaction is unfortu
nately rare at Stanford, Cole .-aid,
referring to the fact that only one
of approximately fi() ca.-es of stu
dent misconduct reported at Stan
lord in the 1991-9f> academic year
w;ls handled hy the Stanford .Judi
cial Council, an 11-member stu
dent faculty organization.
Much of the debate during the
teleconference centered around a
nationally recognized series of
studies that Rutgers McCabe
U'gan in 1990, [Milling students and
faculty in American universities
I he first year, he asked (i.OOO
students in .*{ 1 U.S. schools about
issues related to academic integri
ty. I he following year, he present
ed a similar survey to 800 faculty at
about half of those same institu
tions. Then in 1993, nine medium
and large state universities were
added to the study

In 199-1, Mc( abe compared his
data to a database compiled in 19(i2
by William Rowers and found that
-4udents are cheating earlier in
their college ciireers than they were
30 years ago The [>ercentage of
those claiming to have cheated at
least once has increased only slight
ly, but students who cheat do it
more often today than those a gen
eration ago, the studies found.
Unpermitted collaboration on
assignments h;is s»vn an increase of
100 percent the most dramatic of
all trends observed Business and
engineering students admit to the
highest rates of cheating nation
wide 89 and 78 percent respec
tively And although males have
historically cheated more than their
female counterparts, women are
now cheating just as of ten as men.
While many of the studies' find
ings point an accusing finger at stu
dents, certain figures raise ques
tions of apathy and indifference on
the part of faculty, panelists said
Among the faculty polled in
McCabe'- 1992-93 study, 90 per

cent had observed a student cheat,
but only 40 percent among that
group had actually reported the
incidents. Only half of all the pro
fessors surveyed said they would l>e
willing to pursue a judicial resolu
tion to a student's cheating
These figures, which suggest
that professors should do more to
discourage and punish cheating,
correspond with the widespread
student sentiment that faculty are
too lenient, panelists said
In a closing statement, the
panel's host — Texas A&M Assoc.
Vice President for Student Affairs
and Business Prof. William 1,
Kibler stressed the importance
of continuing and expanding
research on academic dishonesty,
calling on all campus communities
"to move from talk to action
In the next two to three weeks,

cheating to approximately 400
Stanford undergraduates, along

Stanford undergraduates, along
with thousands more to the same
.'{l institutions that participated in
the 1990 study.
According to some of the coun
try's experts on academic integrity
and dishonesty, cheating remains
"a major problem in higher educa
tion."
The discussion was broadcast
live Friday to 105 North American
universities from Ohio's Howling
(ireen State 1 Diversify Sitting on
a panel of six scholars well-versed
in the history and current status
of cheating on college campuses,
Stanford -Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally ('ole emphasized t he encour
aging discrepancy between rates
of cheating at schools with and
without honor codes.
Even though exams at schools
with honor codes must be unproc
tored. Cole said, the premise that
"trust begets trustworthiness"
holds t rue at a promising rate.
Rutgers University Prof. Don
ald McOabe another member of
the live panel discussing "Academ
ic Integrit> The Truth of the Mat
ter" offered statistical support
for ('ole's observation. ('iting a se
ries of studies he conducted be
tween 1990 and 1994, McC'ahesaid
that approximately 57 percent of
students ;it schools with honor
codes admit to having cheated at
least once in their college careers.

versus 78 to 87 percent at schools
wit bout honor codes.
Although most panel members
agreed that honor codes tend l<>
foster comnumicat ion and respect
between faculty and students,
they also noted that a code "is not
a panacea, citing the question
able reliability of self-reporting
and the low rate of students re
porting fellow students as issues
t hat need (<> he addressed.
In an interview yesterday, ('ole
said, "Stanford's honor code has a
very low profile compared to
other institutions affiliated with
t he Center for Academic Integrity,
a consortium of over 70 colleges
and universities in the I'nited
States and C anada of which ('ole is
currently theexecutive director
"There is virtually no educa
tion on and prevention |of cheat
ing at Stanford |, ( ole said.
"About 98 percent of the t line, ,-t u
dent misconduct is resolved
through an administrative process
behind closed doors
In order for an honor code to
work, Cole stressed, students and
faculty must be thoroughly in
volved in the format ion of policies
and the exchange of suggestions
for improvements in discouraging
academic dishonest\
Such interaction is unfortu
nately rare at Stanford, Cole .-aid,
referring to the fact that only one
of approximately fi() ca.-es of stu
dent misconduct reported at Stan
lord in the 1991-9f> academic year
w;ls handled hy the Stanford .Judi
cial Council, an 11-member stu
dent faculty organization.
Much of the debate during the
teleconference centered around a
nationally recognized series of
studies that Rutgers McCabe
U'gan in 1990, [Milling students and
faculty in American universities
I he first year, he asked (i.OOO
students in .*{ 1 U.S. schools about
issues related to academic integri
ty. I he following year, he present
ed a similar survey to 800 faculty at
about half of those same institu
tions. Then in 1993, nine medium
and large state universities were
added to the study

In 199-1, Mc( abe compared his
data to a database compiled in 19(i2
by William Rowers and found that
-4udents are cheating earlier in
their college ciireers than they were
30 years ago The [>ercentage of
those claiming to have cheated at
least once has increased only slight
ly, but students who cheat do it
more often today than those a gen
eration ago, the studies found.
Unpermitted collaboration on
assignments h;is s»vn an increase of
100 percent the most dramatic of
all trends observed Business and
engineering students admit to the
highest rates of cheating nation
wide 89 and 78 percent respec
tively And although males have
historically cheated more than their
female counterparts, women are
now cheating just as of ten as men.
While many of the studies' find
ings point an accusing finger at stu
dents, certain figures raise ques
tions of apathy and indifference on
the part of faculty, panelists said
Among the faculty polled in
McCabe'- 1992-93 study, 90 per

cent had observed a student cheat,
but only 40 percent among that
group had actually reported the
incidents. Only half of all the pro
fessors surveyed said they would l>e
willing to pursue a judicial resolu
tion to a student's cheating
These figures, which suggest
that professors should do more to
discourage and punish cheating,
correspond with the widespread
student sentiment that faculty are
too lenient, panelists said
In a closing statement, the
panel's host — Texas A&M Assoc.
Vice President for Student Affairs
and Business Prof. William 1,
Kibler stressed the importance
of continuing and expanding
research on academic dishonesty,
calling on all campus communities
"to move from talk to action
In the next two to three weeks,
\le( 'al>e will l>e sending surveys on
cheating to approximately 400
Stanford undergraduates, along
with thousands more to the same
.'{l institutions that participated in
the 1990 study.
