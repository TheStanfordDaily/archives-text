Though talk in Washington may
he of peace at last between Israel
and the I 'alest me 1 jberat ion ()rga
nizat ion. t here are varying degrees
of convict ion on the Stanford cam
pus about how soon, and how easi
ly, that ideal will grace the Middle
East.
hast Thursday, a White House
filled with international diplomats
and leaders witnessed the signing
of an accord bet ween Israels I 'rime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and FIX)
leader Yasir Arafat.
The accord, which turns over
much of Israel's West Hank to
Palestinian self-rule, is an effort bv
both parties to begin disentangling
Palestinians and Israelis by estab
lishing separate Palestinian-ad
ministered territory and restoring
peace to an area ravaged by a histo
ry of wars and terrorism.
"I'm in favor of anything that

raises t he level < >112 peace and l< twcr
the level of bloodshed, said St.m
ford I lillel liabbi Ari ('artun.
When asked if he thought the
most recent accord is a significant
step towards establishing peace,
however, ('artun gave a flat "no "
"My major feeling about this,
he said. i> t hat " KSO pages wort h of
agreement is not going to he easiiv
implemented
Natalie (irunfeld, a student and
chair of the Jewish Campus Rela
tions ( 'ouncil,said, "I would becau-
I ious about getting too optimistic
However, (irunfeld added. "To
me there's something symbolic
about the fact that it occurred at
the Jewish new year."
While she acknowledged that
several obstacles remain before a
final settlement can be reached,
(irunfeld said the accord "shows
commitment to peace, and that's
t he most important aspect
The accord is a follow-up to the
1993 Oslo agreement m which a
timeline for settling land and
sovereignty matters was set.
Thursday's agreement cedes the
majority of the West Hank to the
Palestinians with the stipulation
that Israeli troops must evacuate
from those areas by next March .'?<)
Some students said they weren't
sure the agreement adequately
addressed Palestinian concerns,
despite Israeli concessions.
"I don't think what |the Pales
tinians! are getting represents the
.'ispiratinns of the Palestinian peo
pie," said Yaser Haddara, a gradu
ate student in elect rical engineering
who is Muslim. "No sovereignty is
being given to the Palestinians "
In addition to finding fault with
the provisions of the agreement,
Haddara said he disagrees with the
negotiation process in general,
asserting that "the participants m
the process are not on equal foot ing.
"We're seeing a negotiation pro
cess between a state that has vast
military powers and very strong
economic support from the rest of
the world with a group of people

that has been isolated from the rest
â€¢ it the world, that has been given
certain laliels," he said.
Israeli student Gil Rabinovici
also expressed discomfort with the
current agreement
Rabinovici emphasized that he
would like to see the agreement
handled with a different strategy
"liefore implementing any sort of
interim agreement He pinpointed
the issues of final borders, whether
t here will be a Palest inian state or
not and the status of east .Jerusalem
as things for which a negotiation
strategy should be established.
I bis particular accord is a very
dangerous one,' said Rabinovici,
who was born in Jerusalem and has
lived there most of his life. ' It max
imize.- the friction between the
sides'' to have Jewish communities
remaining in newly Palest inian
c<>nt nilled areas, he said
Rabinovici expressed concern
that terrorism will increase as a
result of the accord, even though
Arafat and Rabin have said they
bo|)e it will decrease
"If we're talking with I Arafat |
as a partner for peace, we expect
him to act against any organiza
tion that opposes the process he's
leading," Rabinovici said, referring
to what lie sees as Arafat's failure
to crack down on terrorism by the

extremist group Mamas. "I would
have liked to have seen more proof
of good will" from the Palestinian
leader, he said.
Haddara disagreed While I
don't think | Arafat) is doing a good
job," he said, the PLO leader
"should not be considered responsi
ble for the security of Israel
History Prof. Steve Zipjierstein,
director of the Jewish Studies Pro
gram, said that the Jewish enclaves
on the West Bank would not bean
obstacle to the peace process.
"The bulk are likelv to lie
induced to leave by the Israeli gov
eminent." he said, since most Jew
ish residents live on the West Bank
for economic reasons.
Zipporstein identifies the major
barrier to a final agreement a> the
future of Jerusalem, to which both
Palestinians and Israelis lay claim.
Nevertheless, Zipperstein said
he has faith in the agreementabil
ity to form a lasting resolution
Kven if there is a radical change
in the Israeli government, Zipper
stein said, the Israeli right wing ha
acknowledged the impossibility of
overthrowing the new Palestinian
administrative structure in the
West Bank. " The agreement is a
veiy important step . it makes
changes on the ground irrevoca
hie," he said.
