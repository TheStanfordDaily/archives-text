# Prof. runs camp for cancer-stricken children
## 'Dr. Mike' takes extra time to make his patients happy 
### Leila Ettefagh 
Thanks to "Dr. Mike, there is a place
where baldness is cool and chemo jokes are
shared over lunch.
Dr. Michael Amylon is not your average
professor of pediatric hematology and pedi
atric oncologist at Stanford Hospital. In
1981, he founded Camp Okizu, a summer
camp for children with cancer
"Although 1 had no history of cancer in my
own family, 1 was inspired hy my young pa
tients," Amylon said. "I enjoy interacting
with the kids on friendly terms instead of
simply being the man who gives them their
painful shots and treatments."
One of Amylon's most satisfying experi
ences at (lamp Okizu occurred when lie
worked with a five-year-old cancer patient.
The boy had a bone tumor in his arm and
had to have Ins arm amputated short l.v before
coming to camp. ()bviously upset, the boy an
grily kept to himself during his swimming
lessons,
Amvlon watched as the swim instructor
taught t he boy how to swim with one arm and
saw a transition as the boy learned that he
was still a capable person. Moments like
these make the extra hours worthwhile,
Amylon said.
Despite the children's physical limita
t ions, Camp ()kizu has evolved into your typ
ical kid's summer camp with various activi
ties such as swimming, archery and boating.
"The only difference is that at tins camp
there is an infirmary with nurses and doctors
for the medical needs of children with life
threatening diseases, Amylon said
Despite his busy schedule teaching and
seeing patients, Amylon makes time to tend
to children at the camp He describes the
extra work as something that gives him bal
ance. His experiences contribute to his work

the empathetic side of modern
physicians.
In addition to meeting the needs
of the children, the camp has
expanded to include a program
called SIMS (Special and Important

weekend camps for their parents.
Amylon was honored with the
H)9f) Robert <J Koshland Award
for outstanding service to human
itarian causes. The Koshland
