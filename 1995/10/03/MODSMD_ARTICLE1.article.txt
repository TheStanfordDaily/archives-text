Two temporary workers, hired
to photograph students and staff
for Stanford's new photo identifi
cation card system, were arrested
last week for allegedly making
counterfeit cards.
During a slack time while pho
tographing II) cards on Sept. 23,
co-workers allegedly observed the
two individuals — Kevin Street,
35, of Mountain View, and Peter
Johnson, 28, of San Mateo — pos
ing for the camera, Stanford Po
lice Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
They allied University Registrar
Roger Printup, who then contact
ed the Stanford Police.
The suspects allegedly made
the fake IDs using their photos
and information from students
and staff, Niemeyer said. Each of
the two printed about eight
cards, with different permuta
tions of II) numbers and faculty
or staff status.
Students or staff members iire
able to obtain Wells Fargo ATM
access through the new II) card.
By counterfeiting the II) cards,
Street and Johnson could gain ac

cess to ATM accounts only if they
discovered the PIN codes,
Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said the alleged
counterfeiters could have poten
tially obtained the codes from stu
dents simply by identifying them
selves as Wells Fargo employees
and asking students to verify
numbers.
However, Street and Johnson
"were caught before they could
get any vital information against
students," Niemeyer said.
"No person who is working on
the ID card project had access to
any information other than the
[student or staff member's | name
and address," Printup said.
"They had access to no biographi
cal information."
The suspects were temporari
ly employed by Wells Fargo Bank
on Sept. 21 for the job of issuing
the dual Stanford ID / ATM
cards.
Street and Johnson were each
charged with felonies and booked
into the San Jose Main Jail Both
suspects had considerable crimi
nal histories, Niemeyer said.
Street was still beinir held on
