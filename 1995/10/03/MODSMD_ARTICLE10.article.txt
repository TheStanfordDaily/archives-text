Senate to resume Whitewater inquiry
WASHINGTON (AP) — Rejecting a plea from the Whitewater
prosecutor, the Senate will resume its investigation of the Clintons'
real estate venture, with public hearings late this month on how
the White Mouse and federal officials handled the controversy.
In a strong signal that his criminal probe of President and Mrs.
Clinton is far from over, Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr
unsuccessfully urged the Senate to limit the scope of its inquiry.
Among the issues Starr said would be hindered by a Senate
investigation is the ongoing inquiry of Clinton's 1990 campaign for
governor. That investigation has focused on deputy White House
counsel Bruce Lindsey.
But Sens. Alfonse D'Amato and Paul Sarbanes wrote Starr yes
terday that the Senate "should not delay its investigation" - that
the interests of the Whitewater prosecutor "do not outweigh the
Senate's strong interest" in finishing its work by February.
Court lets pro-abortion law stand
WASHINGTON (AP) The Supreme Court cast aside a broad
challenge to federal limits on abortion-clinic protests as its 1995-
96 term began yesterday with a blizzard of paperwork but with
out the chief justice.
Giving a big victory to abortion-rights advocates, the court let
stand rulings that said the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act does not infringe on anyone's freedom of expres
sion or religion.
Although the action was not a ruling — and therefore not nec
essarily the definitive word on the law's validity it was a key
setback for anti-abortion activists.
Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice called
the court's action "very disappointing," but said his organization
would continue challenging the federal law
Deborah Ellis of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund
welcomed the action benefiting the Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act. "FACE has been effective in reducing the
onslaught of violence to which women, doctors and their families
have been subjected," she said.
Lower courts had ruled in a case from Virginia that Congress,
in passing the clinic-access law, had acted within its authority to
regulate interstate commerce.
