# Simpson jury reaches verdicts
## Decision comes in under four hours; will be announced this morning 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — O.J. Simpson's
jurors stunned the courtroom and the
nation yesterday by reaching verdicts in the
sensational eight-month murder trial in less
than four hours. The decision was kept
secret until today.
Simpson, apparently as surprised as any
one by the swift resolution, stood biting his
lip as the 10 women and two men of the jury
filed into court at 2:55 p.m. Ho stared at
them, but none looked his way and through
out the brief court session they kept their
eyes on the judge.
The decision was announced as many
Americans were just beginning to debate
how many weeks the jurors might be out.
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito said the
verdicts would be read today at 10 a.m.
allowing time for all attorneys and families
to be there.
In announcing the startling news, Ito
said bis court clerk told him that the panel
had made its decision.
"Is that correct?" he asked.
"Yes," said the jury forewoman.
There were gasps in the hushed court
room.
Lawyers on both sides seemed almost
dazed.
"Surprise doesn't begin to describe my
feelings. I am stunned at the speed," defense
attorney Carl Douglas said.
Prosecutor Christopher Harden, asked if
he could believe the rapid end to delibera
tions, said, "I think I have to believe it. It's
happening. Nothing shocks me anymore "
Defense attorney F. Lee Bailey, who went
to visit Simpson in jail late yesterday after
noon, said he was "delighted" by the timing.
"No jury has ever convicted an innocent
man this quickly," he said confidently.
The announcement came after jurors
asked for and heard a repetition of testimo
ny from a limousine driver that concerned
the time when Simpson was picked up for a
ride to the airport on the night of two mur
ders.
Ito, who had sent jurors from the court
room after the reading of the testimony,
seemed startled when three loud buzzes
sounded in the courtroom, signaling jurors
bad reached verdicts.
The jury forewoman also appeared a bit
rattled. Asked for the verdict forms, she said
she had signed them, placed them in an

envelope, sealed it and left them in the
deliberation room.
Ito sent her to fetch the envelope, which
was then placed in the hands of a court
bailiff and stored for safekeeping overnight.
Ito said he was delaying reading the ver
dicts to give all parties time to return to
court for the climactic moment. Jurors nod
ded and smiled understandingly.
"Ladies and gentlemen, have your last
pleasant evening," he told them, suggesting
they use the time to pack their belongings.
As they filed out, Simpson rose again and
watched grim-faced as the jurors left . When
it was time for him to return to jail, he
dropped his pen on t he defense table and left
the room with a somber expression.
In all, jurors had spent less than four
hours in reaching their verdict — two hours
and 20 minutes in morning deliberations,
and an additional hour and 10 minutes
rehearing testimony from limousine driver

Allan Park. They cut the rereading short,
asked for verdict forms and signaled their
decision.
It was one of the fastest verdict decisions
m memory for such a long, high-profile trial,
indicating that once the sequestered jury
broke its silence about the case, the pan
elists found they were all in agreement.
If they had any doubts, they were appar
ently answered by the reading of Park's tes
timony, a precise, minute-by-minute
account of bis efforts to rouse Simpson for a
trip to the airport the night of the murders.
Prosecutors had suggested that the jurors
review the limousine driver's account.
Simpson was brought from jail to attend
the open court session, and he and Douglas
were the only ones at the defense table nor
mally occupied bv an army of attorneys.
The prosecution was represented by
deputy district attorneys Harden and
William Hodgman.


Judge Lance Ito holds the envelope containing the verdicts in O.J. Simpson's double mur
der trial. The envelope spent last night in a courthouse safe and will be opened this morn
ing when court resumes at 10 a.m.
