## More Marguerite 
### 
ARE YOU one of those hapless
souls on the Stanford campus
who neither has a car nor a
bike? The large size of our school
may lend itself to postcards and
building calf muscles, but it doesn't
allow for poor students to get
around too easily.
For years, the University's
answer to the problem of increasing
traffic, congestion and parking has
been to institute a public trans
portation system known as the
Marguerite Shuttle Service. Since
its inception, the Marguerite has
been the butt of jokes, with com
plaints of buses that were barely
filled or constantly late â€” if they
showed up at all. Students also com
plained that the Marguerite operat
ed on too limited a scope and too few
hours.
Now the managers of Stanford's
transportation programs, who oper
ate the Marguerite, are trying to
revamp the system by scrapping the
existing schedule entirely in favor of
a new one. Their goal is to "create a
transit plan for the whole campus

and community." While the logo
and buses will remain the same, the
service, say program directors, will
be more extensive and timely.
The Marguerite management
has already introduced several mea
sures as part of its first phase of
improvements, such as adding more
buses to beef up existing routes and
doubling the current schedule. The
increased access to key sites like the
Quad, the Medical Center, Stanford
Mall, downtown Palo Alto and the
CalTrain station will hopefully alle
viate parking problems on campus.
In addition, extending the hours of
operation to fit the schedules of stu
dents and professors who commute
will encourage people to take advan
tage of the shuttle.
In the next phase, the Mar
guerite hopes to continue its expan
sion by adding service on weekends
and starting an "on-call" shuttle
service which will pick up people
from distance parts of campus.
We applaud the Marguerite's
efforts and hope it continues with
plans to improve.
