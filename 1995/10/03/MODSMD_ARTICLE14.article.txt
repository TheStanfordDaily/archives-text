# A 						matter of taste
## 
### 
Perhaps you have
noticed Stern Hall on your
way to class. How could you
miss it — it's become one of the
most mismatched structures on
campus due to its paint job.
This is not the first time a build
ing has caused great public contro
versy. I.M. Pei's glass pyramid in
front of the Louvre raised hackles
among the French conservatives
for disturbing the uniform, tradi
tional Baroque facade. Residents in
San Antonio Texas, were in a huff
over a new library that has a shock
ing shade of "enchilada red" paint
ed on it. And in San Jose, the same
architect who planned the San
Antonio library designed the civic
center — in mango.
But, as our headline suggests,
it's a matter of taste. What is
avante-garde for some is laughable
for others. Stern is now headed for
the same sort of infamous exis

tence. People will debate, until it
gets repainted, about how some
designer could have been so auda
cious in choosing such an uncon
ventional shade of whatever color it
is meant to he.
In any event, many people have
found the color of Stern to be dubi
ous at best, and we think that the
University could perhaps have been
more conservative in its choice of
decor. But then, part of the Stan
ford experience is about question
ing the dominant paradigm and
experiencing new ideas. While we
do raise objections, we do not con
demn. In fact, we think the whole
controversy is rather amusing.
One hundred years ago, the Eif
fel Tower was lambasted by poets
and artisans for destroying the
Parisian vista. Perhaps in 100
years, we will be looking at Stan
ford's campus and wonder what all
the fuss over Stern was about.
