Yt)U FIND yourself
at a Stanford event
athletic, cultur
al, freshman Orienta
tion, whatever. The sun
is shining, you are with
your pals and you just
skipped class, taking a
break from the daily
demands and rigors of

life on the Farm. You hear the band Ix'gin to
play and see the Dollies a-dancing. Every
thing's normal so far. Then, bounding out
of nowhere, comes the mascot.
You watch it bounce, dance, skip, strut,
jump, zig, zag and run around for awhile.
The band ceases to play, everybody leaves
(including all of the kids that were trying to
look up inside to see what is really in the
costume of the mascot) and then either a
freshman or somebody not familiar with
the University asks you, "What 111 the lu'll is
that stupid green thing doing here?" You
reply by saying, "That's our mascot." The
confused person then asks you with a some
what bewildered and disgusted look on their
face, "Aren't you guys the Cardinals?"
No, we aren't the Cardinals, as in the
bird. We are the ( ordinal — as in the color.
And yes, that crazy green thing is the mas
cot. No, it is not an asparagus spear suffer
ing from excessive growth hormones. Yes, it
is "the Tree."
After a minute or so of explaining to this
person what the mascot is (at le;ist twice,
because he or she didn't believe it the first
time), they ask you with a chuckle, "Why is
the mascot of Stanford I'niversity a Tree?"

You pause and realize that you don't
know why the Tree is the mascot. Well, 1
think that now is as good a time as any to
tell the story, so put down that useless book
translated from third century Latin, crack
open that package of instant hot chocolate
with marshmallows that your aunt gave to
you (I love those things!) and let me tell you
how it goes.
One fine October day (the third, I
believe) in 1888 or something like that,
Leland Stanford w;ls traveling across the
country with his family in one of his trains.
They started in New York, went through
many states and stopped in California.
When they got off the train, Mrs. Stanford
said, "Gee whiz! That sure was a long trip.
Just think if we had to walk. Then it would
have taken a really longtime!"
Mr. Stanford blew his nose, said he hated
the dust and kept mumbling something
like, "Money, land, railroads. Money, land,
railroads." Then, bounding off the train in
his knickerbockers and a ribbon around his
neck, Leland Stanford Junior said to his
parents, "Wow! That was fun. You know
what my favorite part about the whole trip
was? Do you? Huh, huh, do you?"
"Be quiet Junior!" said Leland Sr. "You
are more annoying than an ingrown toe nail.
What did you like about the trip, and tell me
now so I don't have to listen to it later."
"I liked all of the trees that we saw," Jr.
said.
"I cleared out all of the trees to make
room for the tracks," Sr. said.
"There aren't any trees?" fir. said. "Well,
I like trees a lot, and so does mom."

"No I don't," Mrs. Stanford said. "I'm
allergic."
"Well, I like trees dad," Jr. said.
"Fine, I'll keep that in mind," said Sr.
while saying things like, "I should send him
back to Cornell, the stupid kid."
Then, poor Jr. died, Sr. built the Univer
sity because he felt sorry for his son,
remembered about the trees and the rest is
history.
Pretty neat huh? Well, too bad that isn't
the real story. Here is how it really hap
pened.
Stanford University's mascot used to be
referred to as the "Indian." In 1972, the
University started getting a lot of heat
about being disrespectful towards Native
Americans. Stanford then decided to take
up the color Cardinal instead. Many stu
dents and other people (especially the Band)
didn't like this, so as a joke, the band man
ager's girlfriend painted herself green, car
ried around branches and called herself
"the Tree." (She got the idea from the seal
of the University.) The tradition continued
and finally caught on for good about 10
years ago.
So there you have it. Now, when you go
back home for Christmas and your family
starts talking to you about the Stanford
Cardinals, you aui put them in their place.
Is our tradition different from any other
school? It's a little wacky, perhaps, but we
have to have fun somehow.

Mr. Horizon went through a lot to be the
Tree, including setting himself on fire, so be
respectful when you see him.

Just think if we had to walk. Then it would
have taken a really longtime!"
Mr. Stanford blew his nose, said he hated
the dust and kept mumbling something
like, "Money, land, railroads. Money, land,
railroads." Then, bounding off the train in
his knickerbockers and a ribbon around his
neck, Leland Stanford Junior said to his
parents, "Wow! That was fun. You know
what my favorite part about the whole trip
was? Do you? Huh, huh, do you?"
"Be quiet Junior!" said Leland Sr. "You
are more annoying than an ingrown toe nail.
What did you like about the trip, and tell me
now so I don't have to listen to it later."
"I liked all of the trees that we saw," Jr.
said.
"I cleared out all of the trees to make
room for the tracks," Sr. said.
"There aren't any trees?" fir. said. "Well,
I like trees a lot, and so does mom."

"No I don't," Mrs. Stanford said. "I'm
allergic."
"Well, I like trees dad," Jr. said.
"Fine, I'll keep that in mind," said Sr.
while saying things like, "I should send him
back to Cornell, the stupid kid."
Then, poor Jr. died, Sr. built the Univer
sity because he felt sorry for his son,
remembered about the trees and the rest is
history.
Pretty neat huh? Well, too bad that isn't
the real story. Here is how it really hap
pened.
Stanford University's mascot used to be
referred to as the "Indian." In 1972, the
University started getting a lot of heat
about being disrespectful towards Native
Americans. Stanford then decided to take
up the color Cardinal instead. Many stu
dents and other people (especially the Band)
didn't like this, so as a joke, the band man
ager's girlfriend painted herself green, car
ried around branches and called herself
"the Tree." (She got the idea from the seal
of the University.) The tradition continued
and finally caught on for good about 10
years ago.
So there you have it. Now, when you go
back home for Christmas and your family
starts talking to you about the Stanford
Cardinals, you aui put them in their place.
Is our tradition different from any other
school? It's a little wacky, perhaps, but we
have to have fun somehow.

Mr. Horizon went through a lot to be the
Tree, including setting himself on fire, so be
respectful when you see him.
