## Major league hell 
### 
As of precisely 4:05 p.m
PST, the world of Major
League Baseball went to
hell in a hand basket. Just over
24 hours later, things got worse.

I'm not talking about labor
disputes or player strikes or
lockouts â€” nothing of such
despicable a nature. But still,
you know times are bad when
you turn your attention to the
playoff schedule and see the Col
orado Rockies and Seattle
Mariners headlining the day's
action. Yikes!
What can you say about the
Rocks. They're a bright, young,
I prosperous organization with an
even brighter future. Yeah right
and a Rockie starter might
I actually get a complete game.
What the Rockheads really
I are are just a rag-tag band of
j young wash-ups that couldn't
I hit in a real ballpark if their lives
I depended on it, so they just all
went to Coors Field to belt 30
i homers a season. If you're a
marginal, struggling hitter that
has a tendency to hit weak fly
outs, then Coors is the place for
you. If you're a batter and can
barely loft the ball out of the
infield, then Coors is the place
for you. If you're a little leaguer
and have visions of smashing
Maris' home run record, then
Coors is definitely the place for
you.
Coors Field, also widely
known under the pseudonyms
of the Launching Pad, Cape
Coors, Coors Canaveral or sim
ply Mission Control, is the
place where a young man's
longball dreams come true . . .
and then some. The thin Rocky
Mountain air coupled with a
smallish outfield make for foot
ball scores night in and night
out. That's not even the worst

part of it, however, because
after all, both teams play on
the same field. Therefore, fire
works are blasted by both
teams.
The worst part of it all is the
statistics for Rockie players.
Where else can smallish, under
sized third basemen named
Vinny Castilla belt a Ruthian
number of home runs. While
Vinny finished the season with
"just" 32 dingers, he did make a
strong mid-season run at shat
tering Maris' record. How great
would that have been? Vinny,
who probably swings the bat
slower and weaker than some of
the players on the Taiwanese
Little League squad, setting the
standard in the annals of base
ball for most home runs in a sea
son.
Don't forget about Dante
Bichette or Andres Galarraga
either. Both were castaways
from teams like the Brewers and
Cardinals that actually needed
power. Both were noted for their
poor work ethic and undisci
plined playing styles. Yet now,
Galarraga has belted 31 round
trippers, and Bichette is being
touted as the league's MVP with
his 40 home runs, .340 batting
average and 128 RBIs.
We're not talking about a
park like Wrigley where it's "hit
ter friendly." We're talking
about Coors Field where it's
"hitter automatic." Fly balls and
infield pop-ups carry like hot air
balloons. If you can get it air
borne, it's got a chance.
Even outfielder Larry Walk
er's numbers are suspect.
Despite having solid seasons in
Montreal, Walker too has been
the beneficiary of Coors Field,
posting 36 taters to round out
the Rockies most unlikely quar
tet of 30-plus home run slug
gers. So what shall we do with
all these Rocky Mountain air
inflated artificial numbers?
First, we pray to the sports
gods that Bichette doesn't win
the MVP with his falsified statis
tics. Sure, "Bichette happens,"
but an MVP lor old Dante would
be "bull-chette."
