## Major league hell 
### 
As of precisely 4:05 p.m
PST, the world of Major
League Baseball went to
hell in a hand basket. Just over
24 hours later, things got worse.

I'm not talking about labor
disputes or player strikes or
lockouts — nothing of such
despicable a nature. But still,
you know times are bad when
you turn your attention to the
playoff schedule and see the Col
orado Rockies and Seattle
Mariners headlining the day's
action. Yikes!
What can you say about the
Rocks. They're a bright, young,
I prosperous organization with an
even brighter future. Yeah right
and a Rockie starter might
I actually get a complete game.
What the Rockheads really
I are are just a rag-tag band of
j young wash-ups that couldn't
I hit in a real ballpark if their lives
I depended on it, so they just all
went to Coors Field to belt 30
i homers a season. If you're a
marginal, struggling hitter that
has a tendency to hit weak fly
outs, then Coors is the place for
you. If you're a batter and can
barely loft the ball out of the
infield, then Coors is the place
for you. If you're a little leaguer
and have visions of smashing
Maris' home run record, then
Coors is definitely the place for
you.
Coors Field, also widely
known under the pseudonyms
of the Launching Pad, Cape
Coors, Coors Canaveral or sim
ply Mission Control, is the
place where a young man's
longball dreams come true . . .
and then some. The thin Rocky
Mountain air coupled with a
smallish outfield make for foot
ball scores night in and night
out. That's not even the worst

part of it, however, because
after all, both teams play on
the same field. Therefore, fire
works are blasted by both
teams.
The worst part of it all is the
statistics for Rockie players.
Where else can smallish, under
sized third basemen named
Vinny Castilla belt a Ruthian
number of home runs. While
Vinny finished the season with
"just" 32 dingers, he did make a
strong mid-season run at shat
tering Maris' record. How great
would that have been? Vinny,
who probably swings the bat
slower and weaker than some of
the players on the Taiwanese
Little League squad, setting the
standard in the annals of base
ball for most home runs in a sea
son.
Don't forget about Dante
Bichette or Andres Galarraga
either. Both were castaways
from teams like the Brewers and
Cardinals that actually needed
power. Both were noted for their
poor work ethic and undisci
plined playing styles. Yet now,
Galarraga has belted 31 round
trippers, and Bichette is being
touted as the league's MVP with
his 40 home runs, .340 batting
average and 128 RBIs.
We're not talking about a
park like Wrigley where it's "hit
ter friendly." We're talking
about Coors Field where it's
"hitter automatic." Fly balls and
infield pop-ups carry like hot air
balloons. If you can get it air
borne, it's got a chance.
Even outfielder Larry Walk
er's numbers are suspect.
Despite having solid seasons in
Montreal, Walker too has been
the beneficiary of Coors Field,
posting 36 taters to round out
the Rockies most unlikely quar
tet of 30-plus home run slug
gers. So what shall we do with
all these Rocky Mountain air
inflated artificial numbers?
First, we pray to the sports
gods that Bichette doesn't win
the MVP with his falsified statis
tics. Sure, "Bichette happens,"
but an MVP lor old Dante would
be "bull-chette."

Then we just put an asterisk
behind each and every Colorado
player to denote their horribly
unfair advantage in obtaining
their juiced statistics. And just to
spare fans from the blasphemy of
playing postseason games at
Coors, let's just put an asterisk on
the Rockies' making the playoffs
and shelf them until next season.
Speaking of sorry excuses for a
stadium, and a team for that mat
ter, let's turn our attention to the
ignominious Kingdome and the
team it houses — the Seattle
Mariners. I feel the pain of the
California Angels. To lose a 13-
game lead hurts immensely, but
to lose it to a team like the
Mariners in a one-game playoff
must hurt even more.
Alter floundering amidst the
seas of professional baseball for 19
years, the team best known for
overpaying Jay Buhner because
he's Ken Griffey Jr.'s best friend

has finally made the playoffs.
Sigh. Makes you want to cry — I
mean really cry.
Now, not only do we get the
Rockies and Coors Field but we
get the Mariners and the King
dome. Ah yes, the wondrous King
dome, which set the tone for all
dome stadiums to have their roofs
cave in. Forget Olympic Stadium,
the Skydome or the Georgia
Dome. It will always be the King
dome that will be best remem
bered for beginning and glamoriz
ing the trend of crashing roofing
panels.
And if roof plates falling on
your head weren't frightening
enough, there's the small, or big
as the case may be, matter of
Randy Johnson. Dubbed the
Stephen King of baseball by-
Sports Illustrated, Johnson can
very well be the stuff nightmares
are made of. Hut is it because of
his fastball or because of his
swarthy, ungroomed profile? See
ing as how fireballers like Roger
Clemens and Nolan Ryan weren't
close to being as scary as Johnson,
I would have to go with the Big

Unit's less-than-pleasant physical
demeanor. Did I say the Big Unit?
What a silly nickname. It almost
sounds like the Big Eunuch, but
that's definitely someplace scary
that I don't want to go.
The lone bright spot out of all
of this is the fact that we won't
have to put up with these playoff
pretenders for long. The Rockies
don't stand a chance against the
Atlanta Braves who have slowly,
but surely erected their own mini
National League dynasty.
Powered by their awesome
pitching staff, the Braves should
make short work of the Rockies.
Keep in mind as well that Atlanta
too has a few big bats in Chipper
Jones, David .Justice, Ryan Klesko
and Fred McGriff. As for Col
orado, they might have some bats
but not much pitching. Newly
acquired Brett Saberhagen, who
was supposedly there to anchor
the staff, has gotten a bad case of
whiplash the last few months see
ing balls sail over his head, and
with Kevin Ritz as the front-run
ning starter, I would say that the
Rockies definitely have something

to worry about.
As for those Mariners, the victo
ry against the Angels might have
launched them into the playoffs,
but it will also prove to be their
bane. Seattle was pushed into start
ing Johnson in the do-or-die contest
versus California, and therefore
won't be able to start Johnson for
two games in the series.
On the other side of the ball,
the New York Yankees and Don
Mattingly in particular are riding
the euphoria of making it to the
postseason I'm sure the Mariners
are on cloud nine as well, but I've
got a feeling that Donnie Base
ball's first trip to the postseason
won't be a short one.
Both the Braves and the Yan
kees are steeped in postseason tra
dition. The Rockies and Mariners
are simply trespassers in the
month of October whose temerity
will be dealt with severely. So as
long as everyone does what
they're suppose to do, i.e. Rockies
and Mariners lose, our stay in
baseball hell won't last too long.
After all, things can't get any
worse, can they?

won't be able to start Johnson for
two games in the series.
On the other side of the ball,
the New York Yankees and Don
Mattingly in particular are riding
the euphoria of making it to the
postseason I'm sure the Mariners
are on cloud nine as well, but I've
got a feeling that Donnie Base
ball's first trip to the postseason
won't be a short one.
Both the Braves and the Yan
kees are steeped in postseason tra
dition. The Rockies and Mariners
are simply trespassers in the
month of October whose temerity
will be dealt with severely. So as
long as everyone does what
they're suppose to do, i.e. Rockies
and Mariners lose, our stay in
baseball hell won't last too long.
After all, things can't get any
worse, can they?
As of precisely 4:05 p.m
PST, the world of Major
League Baseball went to
hell in a hand basket. Just over
24 hours later, things got worse.

I'm not talking about labor
disputes or player strikes or
lockouts — nothing of such
despicable a nature. But still,
you know times are bad when
you turn your attention to the
playoff schedule and see the Col
orado Rockies and Seattle
Mariners headlining the day's
action. Yikes!
What can you say about the
Rocks. They're a bright, young,
I prosperous organization with an
even brighter future. Yeah right
and a Rockie starter might
I actually get a complete game.
What the Rockheads really
I are are just a rag-tag band of
j young wash-ups that couldn't
I hit in a real ballpark if their lives
I depended on it, so they just all
went to Coors Field to belt 30
i homers a season. If you're a
marginal, struggling hitter that
has a tendency to hit weak fly
outs, then Coors is the place for
you. If you're a batter and can
barely loft the ball out of the
infield, then Coors is the place
for you. If you're a little leaguer
and have visions of smashing
Maris' home run record, then
Coors is definitely the place for
you.
Coors Field, also widely
known under the pseudonyms
of the Launching Pad, Cape
Coors, Coors Canaveral or sim
ply Mission Control, is the
place where a young man's
longball dreams come true . . .
and then some. The thin Rocky
Mountain air coupled with a
smallish outfield make for foot
ball scores night in and night
out. That's not even the worst

part of it, however, because
after all, both teams play on
the same field. Therefore, fire
works are blasted by both
teams.
The worst part of it all is the
statistics for Rockie players.
Where else can smallish, under
sized third basemen named
Vinny Castilla belt a Ruthian
number of home runs. While
Vinny finished the season with
"just" 32 dingers, he did make a
strong mid-season run at shat
tering Maris' record. How great
would that have been? Vinny,
who probably swings the bat
slower and weaker than some of
the players on the Taiwanese
Little League squad, setting the
standard in the annals of base
ball for most home runs in a sea
son.
Don't forget about Dante
Bichette or Andres Galarraga
either. Both were castaways
from teams like the Brewers and
Cardinals that actually needed
power. Both were noted for their
poor work ethic and undisci
plined playing styles. Yet now,
Galarraga has belted 31 round
trippers, and Bichette is being
touted as the league's MVP with
his 40 home runs, .340 batting
average and 128 RBIs.
We're not talking about a
park like Wrigley where it's "hit
ter friendly." We're talking
about Coors Field where it's
"hitter automatic." Fly balls and
infield pop-ups carry like hot air
balloons. If you can get it air
borne, it's got a chance.
Even outfielder Larry Walk
er's numbers are suspect.
Despite having solid seasons in
Montreal, Walker too has been
the beneficiary of Coors Field,
posting 36 taters to round out
the Rockies most unlikely quar
tet of 30-plus home run slug
gers. So what shall we do with
all these Rocky Mountain air
inflated artificial numbers?
First, we pray to the sports
gods that Bichette doesn't win
the MVP with his falsified statis
tics. Sure, "Bichette happens,"
but an MVP lor old Dante would
be "bull-chette."

Then we just put an asterisk
behind each and every Colorado
player to denote their horribly
unfair advantage in obtaining
their juiced statistics. And just to
spare fans from the blasphemy of
playing postseason games at
Coors, let's just put an asterisk on
the Rockies' making the playoffs
and shelf them until next season.
Speaking of sorry excuses for a
stadium, and a team for that mat
ter, let's turn our attention to the
ignominious Kingdome and the
team it houses — the Seattle
Mariners. I feel the pain of the
California Angels. To lose a 13-
game lead hurts immensely, but
to lose it to a team like the
Mariners in a one-game playoff
must hurt even more.
Alter floundering amidst the
seas of professional baseball for 19
years, the team best known for
overpaying Jay Buhner because
he's Ken Griffey Jr.'s best friend

has finally made the playoffs.
Sigh. Makes you want to cry — I
mean really cry.
Now, not only do we get the
Rockies and Coors Field but we
get the Mariners and the King
dome. Ah yes, the wondrous King
dome, which set the tone for all
dome stadiums to have their roofs
cave in. Forget Olympic Stadium,
the Skydome or the Georgia
Dome. It will always be the King
dome that will be best remem
bered for beginning and glamoriz
ing the trend of crashing roofing
panels.
And if roof plates falling on
your head weren't frightening
enough, there's the small, or big
as the case may be, matter of
Randy Johnson. Dubbed the
Stephen King of baseball by-
Sports Illustrated, Johnson can
very well be the stuff nightmares
are made of. Hut is it because of
his fastball or because of his
swarthy, ungroomed profile? See
ing as how fireballers like Roger
Clemens and Nolan Ryan weren't
close to being as scary as Johnson,
I would have to go with the Big

Unit's less-than-pleasant physical
demeanor. Did I say the Big Unit?
What a silly nickname. It almost
sounds like the Big Eunuch, but
that's definitely someplace scary
that I don't want to go.
The lone bright spot out of all
of this is the fact that we won't
have to put up with these playoff
pretenders for long. The Rockies
don't stand a chance against the
Atlanta Braves who have slowly,
but surely erected their own mini
National League dynasty.
Powered by their awesome
pitching staff, the Braves should
make short work of the Rockies.
Keep in mind as well that Atlanta
too has a few big bats in Chipper
Jones, David .Justice, Ryan Klesko
and Fred McGriff. As for Col
orado, they might have some bats
but not much pitching. Newly
acquired Brett Saberhagen, who
was supposedly there to anchor
the staff, has gotten a bad case of
whiplash the last few months see
ing balls sail over his head, and
with Kevin Ritz as the front-run
ning starter, I would say that the
Rockies definitely have something

to worry about.
As for those Mariners, the victo
ry against the Angels might have
launched them into the playoffs,
but it will also prove to be their
bane. Seattle was pushed into start
ing Johnson in the do-or-die contest
versus California, and therefore
won't be able to start Johnson for
two games in the series.
On the other side of the ball,
the New York Yankees and Don
Mattingly in particular are riding
