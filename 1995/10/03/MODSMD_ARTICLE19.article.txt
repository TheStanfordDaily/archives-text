# Nor Cal water polo battle royale
## Cardinal aquamen defeat Cal but fall to USC in tough tourney 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
The Stanford water polo team
rebounded from a disappointing
loss last Friday to place second in
last weekend's Northern California
Tournament.
On its way to the championship
game, the Cardinal (12-3, 2-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) avenged the two losses that it
suffered earlier in the season by
defeating California and UC-
Irvine. The team also rolled over
UC-Davis for the second time this
season before losing to top-ranked
USC 14-13 in the tournament
final.
The game against the Trojans |
lived up to any possible expecta
tions stemming from a matchup l
between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams |
in the nation. It started off inauspi- |
ciously enough, as third-ranked j
Stanford took a 2-1 lead into the I
second quarter. USC then took a i
two-goal lead at halftime, outscor- j
ing the Cardinal 3-1 in the second i
quarter. Stanford responded to the j
Trojan's offensive surge with three 1
goals of its own in the third period j
to regain a one-goal advantage with j
one quarter to play.
What ensued was a fourth quar- !
tor that resembled a shoot-out '
more than a water polo match. In a
frenzied offensive outbreak, the
Cardinal and Trojans accounted for
13 goals in the final period. USC
knotted the score at 12 with just
seconds to play, forcing overtime.
In the first three-minute period
of extra time, Cardinal senior
Brian Wallin, who has been t hi' cor
nerstone of the team in the early
going, rifled a shot from the two
meter spot past the Trojan goalie to
give Stanford a 13-12 lead.
The Cardinal maintained that
slim edge throughout the first peri
od of overtime and deep into the
second until Trojan Hrovje Cizmic
heated a two-point shot past Cardi
nal goalie Jack Bowen with 27 sec
onds remaining, giving USC a 14-
13 edge. Stanford's final attempt at
tying the score was thwarted, and
the Trojans took the game and the
championship.
Senior Jeremy Laster stepped
up in a big way, leading the Cardi
nal with five points, including one

goal from two-point range. Bowen
turned in his trademark solid per
formance with nine saves.
"It was just an amazing water
polo game," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "It was tough to lose,
but overall, I was pleased."
While losing to USC was per
haps something of a bitter pill, it
was sugarcoated both by the over
all high quality of the match and by
the fact that to get to the champi
onship, the Cardinal defeated co-
No. 1 California in the semifinals.
Last weekend was the second
time that the Cardinal and Bears
met. In their prior confrontation,
Cal took advantage of some sloppy
play by Dettamanti's squad, as well
as the absence of All-American
Laster, and defeated the Cardinal

7-5.
This time around, Stanford
proved that it had not forgotten the
early-season loss, racing out to a 3-
0 lead in the first quarter. With
1:29 to play in the first half, Stan
ford extended its lead to 8-2.
Though the Bears climbed back to
make the score close, they were
never able to overcome such a large
deficit, eventually falling to the
Cardinal 13-11.
"The game was really not that
close," Dettamanti said. "I felt that
we were four or five goals better
than them the entire game. I think
that we showed Cal up for what
they are — I don't think that they
are a No. 1 or No. 2 team."
Almost as pleasing to Dettaman
ti as the win was the equitable dis

tribution of goals. Each of the
starters scored at least one goal,
with Wallin once again leading the
way with four points, all from the
two-meter spot.
"We really need balanced scor
ing," Dettamanti said. "You ain't
just have one or two guys getting
the goals. That's not much of an
offense."
During Saturday's pool play, the
Cardinal coasted through its sec
ond game of the day as it once again
man-handled UC-Davis . The victo
ry over the Aggies saw eight differ
ent Stanford players contribute
goals, including three points from
Wallin and (wo points from fresh
man Arturo Rodelo.
