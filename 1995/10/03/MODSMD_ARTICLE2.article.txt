# Stanford Fund shows little gain
## Total giving only up by 1 percent, according to its first annual report 
### Elizabeth Goldman Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writers 
Despite last year's creation of
the Stanford Fund — which focuses
on raising unrestricted funds for
undergraduate programs — under
graduate alumni giving increased
by only 1 percent over the past year.
In its first annual report released
Friday, the fund reported that un
dergraduate alumni giving in
creased from 30.3 percent to 31.1}
percent between 1994 and 1995.
Hut in each of the two previous
years, undergraduate l alumni giv
ing had increased by a greater rate,
jumping from 24 percent to 25.7
percent between 1992 and 1993,
and from 25.7 percent to 30.3 per
cent between 1993 and 1994.
All numbers were reported for
academic years ending in August.
According to John Ford, vice
president for development, this
year's increase was not as large as
the year before because it is diffi
cult to sustain such significant in
creases.
"The previous year's 5 percent
increase was dramatic," Ford said.
"I However,] it takes roughly 800
donors to increase 1 percent. Fach

year we add 1,500 or 1,600 new po
tent ial donors. To get that graduate
class to keep giving is no easy task.
It is a real challenge to keep the per
centage moving up."
"The reason we saw a greater
[increase! the year before was that
[University President Gerhard J
Casper came in and really began to
focus on ... the importance of
alumni giving." said Nancy Wells,
director of the Stanford Fund.
"Your first year of a new leader and
a new focus, you would see a fairly
big jump. The second year, it would
make some sense that the increase
would slow down."
However, both Ford and Wells
said they were pleased with this
year's increase.
Still less than the Ivy League
Despite the gains of the past few
years, the number of Stanford
alumni who donate is still much
lower than those from comparable
institutions, primarily for two rea
sons, Ford said.
"First, other schools have dri
ven home to students from the day
they come on campus that they
have an obligation and a responsi
bility to give," Ford said. "We have
not been nearly as direct in deliver

ing this message."
He noted that last year was the
first time a Stanford president in
structed freshmen about the impor
tance of alumni giving during Ori
entation.
"Second, Harvard, Yale and

Princeton have strong class affilia
tions and strong class identity,"
Ford said. "Fund raising is orga
nized around the class so there is
more peer pressure to give. Stan

ford has organized the undergrad
uate experience in a different way.
Fundraising has not been the
principal reason around which
one organizes."
Future prospects
Ford said ho believes the per
centage of undergraduate alumni
donating will increase in the
future because of a greater focus
on class identity and on the
importance of alumni donations.
"1 think we will do better in the
future . . . although it will be a
tough, slow climb," Ford said.
"We will be able to build stronger
class identity, and we will be able
to find ways for alumni to stay
involved with the University. We
set a goal of having 40 percent of
undergraduate alumni donating
by the end of decade, and I think
we will do it."
Other goals include increasing
next year's overall alumni dona
tion participation to 35 percent
and next year's undergraduate
unrestricted donations to 25 per
cent, Wells said. This year, only
22.H percent of undergraduate
alumni made an unrestricted
donation.
Changing the focus of the
Stanford Fund from a repository
for all giving to the University to a
mechanism only for funds direct
ed to undergraduate programs

will also stimulate donations,
Ford said.
"The annual report that goes
out to alumni this week . . . will be
very stimulating for undergradu
ate giving," Ford said. "We are
sending it to all alumni whether
they gave last year or not to show
how important gifts are and the
impact they have.
"There are a lot of people who
felt their gifts, whether small or
large, used to go into a bottomless
pit," he added. "This report shows
our alumni that those gifts com
bined have a very important
impact on the quality of life for
current undergraduates."
Council of Presidents member
Michael Choo, a member of a
Stanford Fund committee which
met last year, said the fund's
effects on undergraduate alumni
giving will be more noticeable in
several years.
"A lot of the effects of Stanford
Fund giving will be long crm,"
Choo said. "We're not going i > see
the effect until the younger alum
ni are in a position to give."
With an understanding ui the
fund and its purposes, "students
and alumni will be more cog
nizant of how much money the
University needs," Choo said.
"People will be able to say the
Stanford Fund helped them when
they were undergraduates."
In a statement in the Stanford
Fund report, Casper called the
results "encouraging."
"As we begin a new academic
year, the Stanford Fund con tin

ues to be among my highest prior
ities," Casper said. "Annual gifts
to the Stanford Fund provide the
vital discretionary support that
preserves our ability, year after
year, to attract the very best col
lege students and faculty, and to
offer them the resources they
need to do superb work."
Contributors to the fund
Some of the students attracted
to Stanford several years ago con
tributed to the increase in giving.
Nearly 800 members of the
Class of 1995 donated a combined
total of $22,114. More than 50
percent of the class contributed.
Other major sources of dona
tions, according to the report,
came from undergraduate alum
ni, non-alumni parents, friends
and corporate matching dona
tions.
A total of 19,584 people donat
ed to the Stanford Fund last year,
giving a total of $3,820,624.
The 31.3 percent of undergrad
uate alumni who participated —
15,839 people — gave $3,072,618.
Non-alumni parents gave
$222,813, while friends gave
$203,469 and corporate donors
matched $299,610 in donations.
The report also showed that
alumni give more during reunion
years than non-reunion years.
For instance, the class of 1944,
back for its 50th reunion, gave
more than $2 million, while alum
ni from the classes of 1949 and
' >59 gave more than $4 million
i ach.
