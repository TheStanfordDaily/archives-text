# Stanford Fund shows little gain
## Total giving only up by 1 percent, according to its first annual report 
### Elizabeth Goldman Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writers 
Despite last year's creation of
the Stanford Fund — which focuses
on raising unrestricted funds for
undergraduate programs — under
graduate alumni giving increased
by only 1 percent over the past year.
In its first annual report released
Friday, the fund reported that un
dergraduate alumni giving in
creased from 30.3 percent to 31.1}
percent between 1994 and 1995.
Hut in each of the two previous
years, undergraduate l alumni giv
ing had increased by a greater rate,
jumping from 24 percent to 25.7
percent between 1992 and 1993,
and from 25.7 percent to 30.3 per
cent between 1993 and 1994.
All numbers were reported for
academic years ending in August.
According to John Ford, vice
president for development, this
year's increase was not as large as
the year before because it is diffi
cult to sustain such significant in
creases.
"The previous year's 5 percent
increase was dramatic," Ford said.
"I However,] it takes roughly 800
donors to increase 1 percent. Fach

year we add 1,500 or 1,600 new po
tent ial donors. To get that graduate
class to keep giving is no easy task.
It is a real challenge to keep the per
centage moving up."
"The reason we saw a greater
[increase! the year before was that
[University President Gerhard J
Casper came in and really began to
focus on ... the importance of
alumni giving." said Nancy Wells,
director of the Stanford Fund.
"Your first year of a new leader and
a new focus, you would see a fairly
big jump. The second year, it would
make some sense that the increase
would slow down."
However, both Ford and Wells
said they were pleased with this
year's increase.
Still less than the Ivy League
Despite the gains of the past few
years, the number of Stanford
alumni who donate is still much
lower than those from comparable
institutions, primarily for two rea
sons, Ford said.
"First, other schools have dri
ven home to students from the day
they come on campus that they
have an obligation and a responsi
bility to give," Ford said. "We have
not been nearly as direct in deliver

ing this message."
He noted that last year was the
first time a Stanford president in
structed freshmen about the impor
tance of alumni giving during Ori
entation.
"Second, Harvard, Yale and

Princeton have strong class affilia
tions and strong class identity,"
Ford said. "Fund raising is orga
nized around the class so there is
more peer pressure to give. Stan
