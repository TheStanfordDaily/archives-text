# Defensive line hangs tough
## Injured frontline spearheads No. 19 Stanford's defense 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
It has been bruised and bat
tered. It has been pounded and
pummeled. At times, it seems as if
it has been beaten within inches
of its proverbial life — only to
come back begging for more a few
moments later.
It is the Stanford football
team's defensive line. And the
continued success of the 19th
ranked Cardinal may depend
upon its ability to fend off a few
more beatings and administer
some of its own.
"As the line goes, we go," said
defensive coordinator Bill Harris.
"That's why we could have used
Jason White against Wisconsin.
They had some big hogs [on the
offensive line) throwing us
around and he could have given
us some rest."
White, a senior defensive end,
is only one of a handful of defen
sive linemen that have missed
time due to knee injuries. Senior
tackle David Carder banged up
his knee during preseason prac
tices and sat out the first three
games of the year. White went
down late in the fourth quarter
against Utah and is slated to
return this weekend at Arizona
State. Senior nose tackle John
Hebert sprained his left knee at
Oregon and will miss at least
three games. The losses have kept
the line short-handed and, at
times, scrambling to make ends
meet.
"It changes the player rota
tion," said senior defensive tackle
Pete Swanson. "We only have a
limited number of guys who can
play."
The tension this fact causes
was palpable in Eugene.
"The rotation (at the end of the
Oregon game] was whoever was
healthy, go play," Harris said.
"Pete, go play. Kailee [Wong], go
play. All you can do is go play and
see if what you have left is enough
to hold down the fort."
The temporary loss of Brian
Werner up in Oregon only exacer
bated the situation. Five minutes
into the third quarter, the junior
defensive end attempted to block
a short pass and had his legs
taken out from underneath by
Duck running back Kicky Whittle.

He landed on his neck and, for a
few scary moments, couldn't feel
anything in his arm. The trainers
removed him from the field and
feared that he had sustained a
spinal injury.
Luckily, their fears were not
confirmed. And when Hebert
went down at the start of the
fourth quarter, Werner was
screaming to return to the game
so that he might help his com
rades on the line.
"(The coaches] were really con
cerned because it might have been
a spinal injury," he said. "But we
only had two guys out there rotat
ing. I was yelling at the coaches.
They were yelling at me.
"There was definitely a strong
sense of urgency. There were
going to be breakdowns."
With so many linemen miss
ing-in-action, the coaching staff
was tempted to (ill the gaps with a
few freshmen who may otherwise
he redshirted.
"There are freshmen who can
play and who I think are good
enough to play," Swanson said.
"Hut the coaches don't want to

play them and waste a year of
their eligibility just for a few
plays."
The decimated defensive line
pulled together long enough to
stop the Duck's last-quack
attempt to tie the game. Sopho
more defensive ends Carl Hansen
and Wong managed to put just
enough pressure on Oregon quar
terback Tony Graziani to prevent
him from converting a Duck first
down.
"If you have to use | freshmen J,
you use them," Harris said. "But
we're going to try not to as long as
there's a healthy upperclassman
body out there."
The Ducks' last series encoun
tered the same kind of pressure
the Cardinal line had applied in
the first half. Hansen, Swanson
and Co. forced Graziani to get rid
of the ball much more quickly
than he wanted to throughout the
initial period. The result was an
ineffective Oregon offense and a
jump-start for Stanford.
"The line performed well
