# Field hockey loses to Cal

This past Saturday, the Stanford field hockey
team fell to California by a margin of 1-0 in a
hard-fought game marked by close shots and dis
appointments.
The heated rivalry between Stanford and Cal
was not the only reason the Cardinal wanted so
badly to defeat the Golden Bears. It was much
more than a simple "Oskie-Tree" thing. This
year's Cardinal field hockey team has its eye set on
the Northern Pacific Conference championship,
and it was Cal that stood in its path last year.
Since then, both teams have undergone major
change. Stanford got eight recruits, and the Bears
got a new head coach. Cal's coach of many years,
Donna Fong, retired, and her replacement, Shelly
Onstead, who served as an assistant coach for 10
years, must contend with the loss of key players
and new additions to the team. But on the field,
the two teams had one goal in mind, and that was
simply to win.
Stanford's senior members tried to instill in the
younger players the importance of the game. This
included a team dinner at Cardinal coach Sheryl
Johnson's house the day before and motivational
e-mail messages from the captains.
"I think the whole team knew how important
the game was," said freshmen Jordyn Kramer.
"There are a lot of young people on the team that
play, and |the seniors] were trying to [fosterl a

good mental attitude.
"It's a big rivalry, and also Cal and Pacific are
the only teams in our league. If we can beat both
of them, we go to the NCAA [Championships]."
In addition to psyching up for the game, Stan
ford prepared physically for the artificial turf as
well. The team practiced indoors and performed
more running drills to adjust to the field. But
working within the 10 yards of Astroturf next to
the varsity weight room is nothing compared to
the 100 yards at Kleeberger Stadium.
"The biggest difference in the game is that they
practice on Astrot urf all the time," Johnson said.
"That's definitely to their home-field advantage.
The ball runs through and the game is much
faster. The ball does what you want it to do. For a
team like mine, we're a passing team, and the
Astroturf can go all day long."
The mental and physical training helped Stan
ford play an excellent game against Cal â€” excel
lent, but not enough to win.
"It was a close game," Johnson said. "We had
some corner plays that were pretty well executed."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the plays were
well-executed, but not followed through. Fresh
man Sarah Meideros provided a golden opportuni
ty in the second half when her shot attempt hit a
defender's foot and drew a penalty shot. Kramer
took the penalty try and barely missed the goal. "I
sort of felt that I let everybody down, but every
body was so supportive," Kramer said.
However, Johnson was not disappointed at all
by her team's play.
"The (statistics! were all very close for both
teams," Johnson said. "It could have gone either
way."
There was little disparity between each team's
