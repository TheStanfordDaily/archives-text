# Field hockey loses to Cal

This past Saturday, the Stanford field hockey
team fell to California by a margin of 1-0 in a
hard-fought game marked by close shots and dis
appointments.
The heated rivalry between Stanford and Cal
was not the only reason the Cardinal wanted so
badly to defeat the Golden Bears. It was much
more than a simple "Oskie-Tree" thing. This
year's Cardinal field hockey team has its eye set on
the Northern Pacific Conference championship,
and it was Cal that stood in its path last year.
Since then, both teams have undergone major
change. Stanford got eight recruits, and the Bears
got a new head coach. Cal's coach of many years,
Donna Fong, retired, and her replacement, Shelly
Onstead, who served as an assistant coach for 10
years, must contend with the loss of key players
and new additions to the team. But on the field,
the two teams had one goal in mind, and that was
simply to win.
Stanford's senior members tried to instill in the
younger players the importance of the game. This
included a team dinner at Cardinal coach Sheryl
Johnson's house the day before and motivational
e-mail messages from the captains.
"I think the whole team knew how important
the game was," said freshmen Jordyn Kramer.
"There are a lot of young people on the team that
play, and |the seniors] were trying to [fosterl a

good mental attitude.
"It's a big rivalry, and also Cal and Pacific are
the only teams in our league. If we can beat both
of them, we go to the NCAA [Championships]."
In addition to psyching up for the game, Stan
ford prepared physically for the artificial turf as
well. The team practiced indoors and performed
more running drills to adjust to the field. But
working within the 10 yards of Astroturf next to
the varsity weight room is nothing compared to
the 100 yards at Kleeberger Stadium.
"The biggest difference in the game is that they
practice on Astrot urf all the time," Johnson said.
"That's definitely to their home-field advantage.
The ball runs through and the game is much
faster. The ball does what you want it to do. For a
team like mine, we're a passing team, and the
Astroturf can go all day long."
The mental and physical training helped Stan
ford play an excellent game against Cal — excel
lent, but not enough to win.
"It was a close game," Johnson said. "We had
some corner plays that were pretty well executed."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the plays were
well-executed, but not followed through. Fresh
man Sarah Meideros provided a golden opportuni
ty in the second half when her shot attempt hit a
defender's foot and drew a penalty shot. Kramer
took the penalty try and barely missed the goal. "I
sort of felt that I let everybody down, but every
body was so supportive," Kramer said.
However, Johnson was not disappointed at all
by her team's play.
"The (statistics! were all very close for both
teams," Johnson said. "It could have gone either
way."

There was little disparity
between each team's shot attempts
and goalie saves. Stanford attempt
ed 13 shots inside the circle, where
as the Bears tried 15. The Cardinal
made up this deficit with eight shot
attempts outside the circle com
pared to Cal's two. Defensively,
both teams' goalies had their hands
full. Cal's goalie recorded 12 saves
and Stanford's Kelly Naylor regis
tered 15.
"Our defense was solid." John
son said. "Our keeper played very
well. Kelly actually made some real
ly nice saves — some slide tackle
saves — and the defense cleared
them out for her."
Cal's goalie had her work cut out
for her with Stanford's seven well
executed penalty corners. Naylor,
on the other hand, contended with
only four penalty corners from the
opposition.
Although the Bears scored the
only goal it needed in the first half,
the second half belonged to Stan
ford. The Cardinal controlled the
ball, as it did in the beginning of the
contest. Kramer explained that the
halftime break allowed Stanford to
regroup and get focused. The Cardi
nal played hard in the second half
but simply could not put a ball in
the goal.
"We controlled the ball a lot, but
instead of shooting, we were pass
ing more," Kramer said. "We didn't
have enough shots inside. Next
time we'll do a better job of getting
the shots off."
The game, although a loss,
earned Stanford the respect it knew
it deserves. "We knew [the Bears]
looked at it like we wouldn't be a big
deal, but I think that now they defi
nitely will have to respect us after
the way we played," Kramer said.
Stanford must now host Pacific
today at 3 p.m. Two weeks ago,
Stanford crushed Pacific 3-0. but
the Cardinal is not complacent.
"We shouldn't take Pacific light
ly." Naylor said. "Anything can
happen. We just need to focus and
play our game.
"When we play our game we can
beat anyone. All of the games count
equally."
The Tigers will work to prevent
the easy penetrations to their
defense that occurred in the last
game. Stanford, on the other hand,
will use the contest to prepare for
its rematch against Cal on Satur
day.

After a tough 1-0 loss to Cal, Cardinal field hockey will race into the
fray today against Pacific.
California

This past Saturday, the Stanford field hockey
team fell to California by a margin of 1-0 in a
hard-fought game marked by close shots and dis
appointments.
The heated rivalry between Stanford and Cal
was not the only reason the Cardinal wanted so
badly to defeat the Golden Bears. It was much
more than a simple "Oskie-Tree" thing. This
year's Cardinal field hockey team has its eye set on
the Northern Pacific Conference championship,
and it was Cal that stood in its path last year.
Since then, both teams have undergone major
change. Stanford got eight recruits, and the Bears
got a new head coach. Cal's coach of many years,
Donna Fong, retired, and her replacement, Shelly
Onstead, who served as an assistant coach for 10
years, must contend with the loss of key players
and new additions to the team. But on the field,
the two teams had one goal in mind, and that was
simply to win.
Stanford's senior members tried to instill in the
younger players the importance of the game. This
included a team dinner at Cardinal coach Sheryl
Johnson's house the day before and motivational
e-mail messages from the captains.
"I think the whole team knew how important
the game was," said freshmen Jordyn Kramer.
"There are a lot of young people on the team that
play, and |the seniors] were trying to [fosterl a

good mental attitude.
"It's a big rivalry, and also Cal and Pacific are
the only teams in our league. If we can beat both
of them, we go to the NCAA [Championships]."
In addition to psyching up for the game, Stan
ford prepared physically for the artificial turf as
well. The team practiced indoors and performed
more running drills to adjust to the field. But
working within the 10 yards of Astroturf next to
the varsity weight room is nothing compared to
the 100 yards at Kleeberger Stadium.
"The biggest difference in the game is that they
practice on Astrot urf all the time," Johnson said.
"That's definitely to their home-field advantage.
The ball runs through and the game is much
faster. The ball does what you want it to do. For a
team like mine, we're a passing team, and the
Astroturf can go all day long."
The mental and physical training helped Stan
ford play an excellent game against Cal — excel
lent, but not enough to win.
"It was a close game," Johnson said. "We had
some corner plays that were pretty well executed."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the plays were
well-executed, but not followed through. Fresh
man Sarah Meideros provided a golden opportuni
ty in the second half when her shot attempt hit a
defender's foot and drew a penalty shot. Kramer
took the penalty try and barely missed the goal. "I
sort of felt that I let everybody down, but every
body was so supportive," Kramer said.
However, Johnson was not disappointed at all
by her team's play.
"The (statistics! were all very close for both
teams," Johnson said. "It could have gone either
way."
There was little disparity between each team's

There was little disparity
between each team's shot attempts
and goalie saves. Stanford attempt
ed 13 shots inside the circle, where
as the Bears tried 15. The Cardinal
made up this deficit with eight shot
attempts outside the circle com
pared to Cal's two. Defensively,
both teams' goalies had their hands
full. Cal's goalie recorded 12 saves
and Stanford's Kelly Naylor regis
tered 15.
"Our defense was solid." John
son said. "Our keeper played very
well. Kelly actually made some real
ly nice saves — some slide tackle
saves — and the defense cleared
them out for her."
Cal's goalie had her work cut out
for her with Stanford's seven well
executed penalty corners. Naylor,
on the other hand, contended with
only four penalty corners from the
opposition.
Although the Bears scored the
only goal it needed in the first half,
the second half belonged to Stan
ford. The Cardinal controlled the
ball, as it did in the beginning of the
contest. Kramer explained that the
halftime break allowed Stanford to
regroup and get focused. The Cardi
nal played hard in the second half
but simply could not put a ball in
the goal.
