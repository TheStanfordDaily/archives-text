For Cardinal sailing, competi
tion has often left Stanford in
rough waters, but on Saturday,
the winds changed. Host to last
weekend's Pacific Coast Women's
Single-handed District Qualify
ing Regatta, the Cardinal showed
what it takes to get to Nationals.
Junior Alice Manard and
freshman Taylor Robinson were
t he only two sailors competing for
Stanford, finishing first and fifth
respectively. Going into the
regatta as the favorite, Alice
breezed through each of the 14
races, blowing the second-place
finisher, UC-Irvine's Fiona

Maclean, out of the water. After
Stanford lost two .solid sailors
before the season began, Alice
stepped right up to lead (he
women's team, according to
coach Steve Bourdow.
Bourdow has high hopes for
Manard in her upcoming races at
Nationals, which will take place
in Portland, Ore. Although she
will face 16 of the country's best,
Manard will not be daunted.
Last year in Boston, Manard
look eighth at Nationals sailing
in unfamiliar waters and rough
conditions. "This year I have
hopes for Alice to place in the top
five, if not the top three, alt hough
she is up against some really

strong sailors," Bourdow said.
Kor Robinson, however, Satur
day's qualifier proved to be a
learning experience. After only
two days of practice, Taylor did
not hesitate to prove her poten
tial.
"She sailed really, really well
and I know the experience will
give her confidence in her next
regatta," Bourdow said.
Coming up for Stanford is its
first intersectional regatta, which
will be held at California. Manard
will race in the single-handed
competition. Robinson, however,
is preparing to take on the Naval
Academy in the double-handed
competition at Annapolis.
