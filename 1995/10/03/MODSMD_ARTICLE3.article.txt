# Stanford tries to defeat local growth limits
## 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Stanford has donated a telephone survey worth close
to $19,000 to help defeat a Palo Alto initiative thut
could adversely affect future development projects, in
cluding a major expansion of the Stanford Shopping
Center.
One of the initiative's provisions proposes to main
tain a 1989 non-residential growth limit that allocated
65,000 square feet for the shopping center's develop
ment. Since then, about 16,000 square feet have been
used, leaving 48,000 to 49,000 for future development.
The University, however, submitted a proposal to
the Palo Alto City Council last November to increase
the Shopping Center's 1989 square footage allotments
by 12 percent to 160,000 square feet.
Measure R, on the Nov. 7 ballot, proposes to curb
commercial development in the city of Palo Alto and
fixes residential zones for 20 years. Proponents of the
measure say it will curb traffic congestion and help to
correct a skewed jobs-to-housing ratio imbalance.
"It really should be of no surprise that Stanford is
opposed to this," said Andy Coe, Stanford's director of
community relations. "Stanford development projects,
both potential and real, are targets. What would be un
usual is if we weren't involved."
He said Stanford funded an August telephone sur
vey of Palo Alto citizens to gauge, among other things,
where the community stood on the issue. That infor
mation was donated to Citizens for Palo Alto's Future,
a group opposed to the initiative.
Coe said that no other major development projects
are in the works. But the measure, if passed, could block
future improvement plans for the Stanford Medical
Center and new development in the Stanford Research
Park, he said. Coe added that a hotel-conference center
slated to service research park companies would also be
jeopardized because the intended construction site is
currently zoned as residential. If the measure passes,
the rezoning moratorium would block commercial de
velopment on the site.
To the extent that Stanford could carry out reason
able commercial projects, fewer dollars would come in if
the initiative passes and the teaching and research mis
sion of the University would suffer, Coe said.
Hut heemphasized that the measure is a "Palo Alto
wide initiative" and that many facets of the community
have come together to oppose the measure.
"It is clearly a bad initiative," said Will Beckett, co
chair of Citizens for Palo Alto's Future, which is made
up of residents, business organizations and community
groups. "Wedon't think it's a growth-control initiative.
We don't think it will control traffic."
"It really puts a crimp on the ability to plan in the fu
ture," he said, adding that the measure would hamper
efforts to control congestion by blocking rezoning mea
sures that would allow city planners more flexibility in
managing traffic problems.
Hut Emily Renzel, a coordinator of Citizens for Af
firmative Planning, which backs the initiative, said that
the city should not consider loosening zoning limits es
tablished in 1989 because the street system would not
be able to sustain added congestion. A former council
member, Renzel said that the council has been review
ing a proposal that calls for at least 2.4 million addi-
tional square feet to Ix.' slated for
development.
Such a proposal "is alarming
because it's beyond what the city can
luindle and throws off job-to-hous
ing balances," she said, adding that

the ratio is already three-to-one.
"This translates into a lot of
commuter traffic," Renzel said. "It
would be massive congestion if
built out to those levels."
But Beckett, who is a member of
t he advisory committee submitting
the development plan, said that "a
lock on comprehensive planning is
a slap m the face to a project that is
still under way."
