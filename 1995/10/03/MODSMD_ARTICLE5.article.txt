The first official ASSU Senate meeting, though
sprinkled with snide comment*about parliamentary
procedure, began with Senate Chair Alane Murdock's
firm statement concerning her enforcement of the
sweatshirt rule.
Murdock clarified her stance on the ASSU's sweat
shirt rule, saying that it falls under the Fundamental
Standard of the University.
By an amendment to the ASSU Constitution passed
in the 1994 spring general election, ASSU senators are
required to wear sweatshirts throughout the day of a
meeting in order to have voting privileges. The sweat
shirts display the time and place of the senate meet
ings. Murdock emphasized that as senate chair, she
would not be personally responsible for enforcing the
rule.
ASSU senator Lamar Baker questioned what exact
ly "wearing" an ASSU sweatshirt entailed — whether
around the waist, around the shoulders or as a turban
on the head.
Murdock refused to address such subtleties, and re
ferred Baker to Stanford's Fundamental Standard —
the rules governing student conduct on campus. If a
senator lies about having worn a sweatshirt all day, it
would be considered a violation of the standard.
Murdock also discussed senate membership.
