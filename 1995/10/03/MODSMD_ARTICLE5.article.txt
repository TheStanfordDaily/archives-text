# Procedure and uniforms start new ASSU year
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Sara Southern Contributing writers 
The first official ASSU Senate meeting, though
sprinkled with snide comment*about parliamentary
procedure, began with Senate Chair Alane Murdock's
firm statement concerning her enforcement of the
sweatshirt rule.
Murdock clarified her stance on the ASSU's sweat
shirt rule, saying that it falls under the Fundamental
Standard of the University.
By an amendment to the ASSU Constitution passed
in the 1994 spring general election, ASSU senators are
required to wear sweatshirts throughout the day of a
meeting in order to have voting privileges. The sweat
shirts display the time and place of the senate meet
ings. Murdock emphasized that as senate chair, she
would not be personally responsible for enforcing the
rule.
ASSU senator Lamar Baker questioned what exact
ly "wearing" an ASSU sweatshirt entailed — whether
around the waist, around the shoulders or as a turban
on the head.
Murdock refused to address such subtleties, and re
ferred Baker to Stanford's Fundamental Standard —
the rules governing student conduct on campus. If a
senator lies about having worn a sweatshirt all day, it
would be considered a violation of the standard.
Murdock also discussed senate membership.
Though three graduate senators,
Matt Kelao, Rich Barnett and
Walt Williamson, resigned last
spring, 15 graduate senators
remain on the senate. Until the
number of graduate senators
drops to 10, no new elections will
be held, Murdock said.
Later in the meeting, ASSU
Financial Manager John Hall
introduced a plan to cut ASSU
spending on special-fee refunds.
Approximately $14,000 is spent
yearly to pay for postage and mail
ing costs of fee refund checks.
Anywhere from $2.22 to $3.10
is spent mailing refund checks
that average $24, Hall said. He
added that spending 10 percent of
the value of the check in its mail
ing is wasteful and inefficient.
Under Hall's plan, the Stan
ford identification numbers of

students requesting refunds
would be given to the Bursar's
Office, which would then credit
the money to the student's
account. The plan will be voted on
at next week's senate meeting.
The senate also dealt with sev
eral legislative items at last
night's meeting.
The (Iroup Discounts Business
Project, headed by senior Danny
Bressler, was approved by the
senate. The project offers dis
counts at various attractions in
the Bay Area, the first of which is
available this Saturday and Sun
day at Lireat America.
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen
proposed giving senate associates
voting privileges in committee to
"better expose senate associates
to the entire senate process and
give them a more hands-on role."
He also stated that voting senate
associates would help committees
reach quorum, and allow first
vear students to have a formal

voice in the senate.
Senate associates are usually
chosen by a nominations chair.
Since there is currently no nomi
nations chair, associates will be
selected by an executive commit
tee consisting of the Council of
Presidents, the financial manag
er, the senate chair and the
deputy chair, Murdock said.
Undergraduate senator Howard
proposed an amendment to
Shen's bill, which required a quo
rum of elected senators to lx i pre
sent before senate associates could
vote. This motion caused an
extended period of bickering —
almost two hours — over pjirlia
mentary procedures concerning
whether a bill not in its final form
could be amended.
The deadline to apply for a sen
ate associate position is this Fri
day. The COP is also looking for
people to fill cabinet positions and
for interns interested in policy
research and advocacy.
