Editor's note: This is the first installment of
an occasional series. It is the true story of
seven freshmen, picked to live in an all-frosh
dorm, Junipero, and have their lives chal
lenged. Find out what happens when the
small talk ends and people start getting
real. The Real World, Stanford.
Joe Freund, Sacramento, Calif.
I le comes from your basic "nuclear" fam
ily — two parents, a brother, a sister and, of
course, a family pet — but this sure isn't
your everyday, average Joe. In response to
t ho letter from the admissions office regard
ing his "markedly declining grades during
the last part of his senior year," Joe
laughed.
"The way I figured, by the time [Stan
ford] tfot my grades, they had probably also
cashed my check," Joe explained. "As an
economist, the opportunity cost for doing
labs in physics and homework for math
wasn't worth the marginal utility I could
gain by hanging out with friends or even
studying on my own for AP tests." Entering

STANFORD

with over 40 AP credits to his name, Joe's
theory apparently paid off.
Coming from a strong Jewish back
ground, Joe recently attended Rosh
1 lashana services on campus.
"It's really nice to have a support struc
ture where you can meet people who have
the same cultural ties," Joe said. "Leaving
home, I feel like I've been cut off from my
old youth group and synagogue, my main
ties to my religion. It's nice to have some
thing else here for me."
One facet of Stanford that troubles Joe is
the widespread "political correctness."
"For a University that encourages people
to speak out and be open, the political cor-

redness here is way overdone,
Joe complained. "In fact, this
place is so irked with rampant
political correctness that it seems
almost hypocritical. People
should tolerate each others' view
points more."
On the up side, Joe is
impressed with the notable
amount of dorm bonding that
takes place within the Stanford
com munity.
"When one person wanted to
go to the party last night, 20 oth
ers followed," Joe said. "So far the
parties have been a lot of fun. But
I know that studying will still
come first I didn't pay $29,000 to
get drunk. I could have done that
at home for much less. One thing
that surprises me is the number
of students who don't party.
There even seems to be a large
militant group of anti-alcohol stu
dents."
Kevin Chen, Knoxville, Tenn.
"When I came during Pro Fro
weekend, I was really shocked
that there was such a large pro
portion of Asian Americans here.
In Tennessee, there were about
three in my entire graduating
class of 150, including myself,"
Kevin said. "The first 10 people I
met on campus were Asian, and I
thought I was in Chinatown. Hut
then I realized that it was just
like being at home. People here
come from all different back
grounds, and they're all still peo
ple."
Having studied at a boarding
school for tlu 1 last four years,
Kevin is no stranger to the partic
ulars of living away from home
especially laundry and room
mates. However, one comfort he
no longer experiences i.- waking to
the familiar face of his identical
twin brother, who is now attend

ing school in Virginia.
"I was worried about how my
roommate and I would get along
because my brother and I were
really close," Kevin admitted.
"But Joe [Freund'sl cool. He's not
a 'do your own thing to be a rebel'
type of guy, but a 'do your own
thing because it's you.' I wish I
was a little more like that because
sometimes I see things based on
how others see them. Then some
times I go through phases and
just say 'fuck that' and do what
ever I want."
Kevin describes himself as "lib
eral" concerning his views on
today's college scene.
"I thought the 'Sex in the '90s'

program during Orientation was
very practical," Kevin said. "I
don't know how it is here, but I
have a lot of friends who go to
state schools and they'd tell me
stories about people hooking up
left and right during orienta
tion."
>Jean I)e La Torre, Vaeaville,
Calif.
"My family's really mixed up,"
Jean said. "We have a very strong
bond and 1 can talk to my parents

about everything. Hut there are a
lot of conflicts beneath the sur
face."
When Jean's mother became a
Jehovah's Witness, her child
hood became confined by the
strict rules of the religion, for
bidden to attend birthday parties
and celebrate holidays, Jean was
also prohibited from associating
with the "worldly" people of
other beliefs.
"The church basically said that
you shouldn't attend college or
pursue higher education and pro
fessional careers. I wanted to
learn, not so I could get a big job
someday, but just for the sake of
learning. I do believe in the
morals of saving sex until mar
riage and not drinking, but turn
ing away friends and education I
just couldn't accept."
Breaking away from the reli
gion put a strain on her relation
ship with her mother at first, but
Jean said that with more commu
nication, their relationship has
improved over time.
Looking back, Jean said she
does not regret the events of her
childhood.
"I don't think that life would
really be t he same if everything
was always happy," she said.
"You would never really know
who your true friends are. Real
friends are the ones who are there
for you when things are bad. You
have to take the good with the
bad, it's all part of life."
Tusha Dwamcna, Jersey City,
NJ
An only child from a single
parent. home, Tasha describes her
relationship with her parents as
"one long struggle."
"I don't know much about my
culture because my father, who is
from Ghana, West Africa, left
when 1 was in junior high," Tasha
explained.
"It was an emotional and
financial struggle with my moth
er I had to deal with her always

blaming me for our situation. I
couldn't communicate with any
one without being hostile or sar
castic. Sometimes things would
get so tense that I would purpose
ly stay away from home to avoid
bearing my mom complain about
my dad."
Coming from a magnet public
high school that functioned on
ethnic quotas, Tasha was well
prepared for the cultural diversity
at Stanford.
"I've always been deemed as
different," Tasha said. "Here, peo
ple give you a chance. But coming
from the East Coast, I still have
that New York mentality where
people are stereotypically cold. It's
like culture shock, but in a good
way. I tell myself that this place
isn't real because people are too
accepting. When people smile at
me, I often hesitate and question
why they're so friendly."
Grant Brown, Lake Oswego,
OR
After visiting the Ivy Leagues
on the East Coast, there was no
question why Grant chose Stan
ford as his No. 1 school. "People
here seem so much more laid
back," he said. "I see people sit
ting out on the grass and it seems
so much more comfortable. Stan
ford also offers a much better
package in terms of sports and
other activities."
A soccer fanatic since the sixth
grade, Grant is one of the newest
members of the Stanford men's
varsity team. Unfortunately, he
has already suffered a sprained
ankle and broken finger this sea
son. Like most incoming fresh
men, Grant is not sure what to
expect of his first year. Already he
has a fear of early morning class
es. Another uncertainty about
college life is dealing with a long
distance relationship.
"My girlfriend, who I've been
going out with for two years, is a
freshman at Boston College,"
Grant said. "It's tough because we

can't always be there for each
other and know what the other is
doing."
George Holbert, Soquel,
Calif.
He's the type that prefers a
problem set over a paper. When a
math problem is done, it's done,
whereas a paper can be revised
repeatedly. In other words, he

classifies himself as a 'techie'.
"I went to an engineering talk
during orientation and it was so
overwhelming," George admitted.
George originally chose Stan
ford because it was close to home,
not for the atmosphere. "I met a
lot of great people when 1 came
for Pro Fro weekend," he said.
"At first I got the impression that
everyone was drunk all the time,
especially since I don't party
myself. But it's only partially
true, and people do study a lot."
Besides losing all his keys dur
ing Orientation at MuFuUnSun,
George has had a pretty smooth
adjustment into college life. He
hopes to get involved with a band
on campus, his instrument of
choice being the bodhrcin, a goat

skin drum used in traditional
Irish bands.
"So far everything has been
going well, including things
between my roommate and me,"
George said. "Grant is very slick,
but not in a conniving sense.
When I hear him talking to his
girlfriend on the phone, he's very
comforting. He seems to always
know what to say."
Chandra Chistenson, Salt
Lake City, Utah
Living in a Mormon communi
ty as a non-Mormon has been one
of Chandra's greatest challenges.
Her family broke away from the
religion when she was 13.
Although she hasn't seen her
birth father since age eight,
Chandra has a strong paternal
relationship with her mother's
fiance.
"Even though I'm not Mor
mon, I know a lot about the reli
gion because I was brought up
with it," Chandra explained. "My
high school was very cliquish.
Everyone was the same, there
was no diversity. I felt repressed,
like we had to believe a certain
way and do certain things."
Chandra has heard the rumor
about the lack of dating on cam
pus, but still hopes to find a
boyfriend here this year. "I just
want a guy friend that I can real
ly talk to," she said. "In high
school, I didn't get invited to any
dances and had only a couple of
good friends. I was never into
playing those high school games.
And here I don't feel like I have
to. It's nice to have a new start
where people won't judge me by
my past."
Chandra is one of the few
incoming freshmen to have a sin
gle room. "At first I was really dis
appointed because I was looking
forward to meeting my room
mate," she said. "But now I like it
because I don't have to worry
about my roommate doing weird
things."
