# White Plaza soon to be whole again

Students walk by it every day, yet no one seems
to know why there is a large dusty hole in the mid
dle of White Plaza.
While some students have suggested imaginative
theories about the purpose of the construction, pro
ject manager Lou said the repairs are routine
and should be completed by Oct. 15.
I Mine said that the project is designed to replace
steam pipes that lie under White Plaza. Earlier this
summer, fences enclosed most of the plaza, leaving
narrow walkways around the Claw and in a few
other places.
Now, tall fences guard deep holes dug to reach
the aging 8-foot steel and 4-foot copper-nickel pipes
that shuttle hot steam between the University's
natural gas steam plant, located by the Stanford
Medical Center, and campus buildings.
"The old pipes were deteriorated and had holes in

them, so they have to be replaced," said Lane.
The project should be finished soon, leaving White
Plaza open once again for bikes to sail through.
"We are scheduled to finish on Oct. 15, but the
way these things are, we'll probably be done about a
week late, weather permitting," Lane said.
The work will cost the University over $250,000.
Students had some imaginative answers as to
what White Plaza would have to offer once the dirt
was back in place.
Junior Emma Petty said yesterday she wondered
if the projects were not in fact "a plot to prevent
campus protests or a cappella group performances."
Senior Eleanor was no less skeptical.
"They do it every year. They dig big ditches, look at
stuff and then fill them in again."
"I don't have any idea what they are doing, but if
they put in a pool I wouldn't mind," said Hudel
Lueche, a visiting research scientist studying struc
tural biology.
