beginning with the tall quarter, 1995. These policies apply to all undergraduate
students and to all graduate students with the following exceptions: 1) these policies
do not apply to any student enrolled in the M.I), program through the Medical
School: 2) these policies do not apply to any student in the University taking a
course in the I aw School or the Business School (this would include, for example, a
I'll.I), student in Fconomics taking a course in the Business School who would follow
the rules ol the Business School only lor the course being taken through the
Business School).
When to withdraw from courses.

New grades and symbols (NP. W, CR, RP)
What to do if you still have questions.
lhe revised grading policies establish new dates for adding and dropping courses
and units and for withdrawing from classes. The dates for each of the quarters of
the 1995-96 academic year are noted in the enclosed information. These dates will be
adhered to strictly by the Registrar's Office. All changes to your academic schedule
up to the deadline dates may be done through the Axess system.
Ihe new grading policies also establish a new grade of "NP" (Not Passed) as a grade
that may be given to a student in a regularly graded course (i.e., a course that is
graded A. B, C, D) who has not done passing work in a course.
Incomplete grades are to be requested by students by the last day of classes. It is the
instructor's prerogative to determine whether an incomplete grade is warranted and]
to establish the conditions under which the incomplete will be given. However, at
the end ol one calendar year, any incomplete grade that is still on a student's record
will automatically be converted to an NP or NC by the Registrar's Office. Faculty are
under no obligation to accept work from a student to change the NP or NC grade to a
regular grade one calendar year after the course has ended.
A detailed description of all Stanford grading policies may be found in the Stanford
Bulletin, pages 49-50 and 54-57. If you have further questions concerning the new

A new notation. NP ("Not Passed"), will be used in place of the "NC" in courses taken for a letter grade but not passed.
The "NC will continue to be used to represent unsatisfactory performance in courses taken on a satisfactory/no credit
basis. 'NC and "NP" notations recorded for courses after Summer 1994-95 will be visible on student transcripts.
A new notation of "CR" ("Credit") will replace the "+" previously used when a student's performance has been
satisfactory in a course s/he elected to take on a satisfactory/no credit basis. The "S" will continue to be used in courses
where satisfactory/no credit grading is not student-elected, but instructor-mandated. There is no change for either "CR" or
"S" m requiring C- or better performance.
A new notation of "W" ("Withdrew") will be recorded when a student withdraws from a course between the start of the
sth and the end of the Bth week of the quarter. This notation will be visible on student transcripts.
As stated below. the Registrar's Office will replace the original grade recorded for a course with a new notation, "RP"
("Repeated Course"), when a student retakes the course. This notation will be visible on student transcripts.
B. INCOMPLETES
Incompletes in courses taken in 1994-95 or later must be changed to a permanent grade or notation within one year (i.e.
prior to the first day of the fifth quarter which follows the course, including Summer Quarter). If the"I" remains
uncleared after that time, it will be changed automatically by the Registrar's Office to a "NC" or "NP" as appropriate for
the grading option selected. Also, students may not drop courses in which an Incomplete ("I" notation) was awarded, if
those courses were taken in 1994-95 or later.
Note that these policies do not apply to Incompletes in courses taken prior to Autumn 1994-95. Those "I"s will remain as
they are on students' records until they are either dropped by the student or cleared by a grade from the instructor.
C. COURSE RETAKES
A student may retake ONCE any course s/he completed (regardless of grade or notation earned - "NC", "I",
whatever!) or from which s/he withdrew and have the original grade or notation replaced by the notation "RP" (for
"repeated course"). When retaking a course, the student must register for the same number of units as when s/he
originally took the course, and the course number must match EXACTLY the department number, course number, and
suffix of the original course. Courses without matching numbers cannot be assumed to be equivalent and will not be
accepted as retakes.
If the course is being offered with a choice of grading options (letter grade or CR/NC), the student may, adhering to the
usual deadline for electing a grading option, elect whichever grading option s/he wants (regardless of which grading
option was elected when the course was taken for the first time).
Upon completion of the retake, the Registrar's Office will automatically change three things in the student's record: the
units for the first time the course was taken will be reduced to 00, the grade for that first time will be changed to an "RP",
and the grade for the second time will be specially (lagged on the student's transcript to indicate that it is a repeated
course. The student's record would then carry entries similar to this:
Autumn 1994: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 00 units RP
Autumn 1995: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 03 units C #
A student may not retake a course again in the future (for a third time), unless s/he received a "NC" or "NP" when s/he
took it for the second time. Upon completion of the third attempt, the Registrar's Office will automatically change the
units for the second time to (X), and the third time will appear on the transcript with its units, grade, and the special flag to
indicate that it is a repeated course. The end result will look like this:
Autumn 1994: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 00 units RP
Autumn 1995: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 00 units NP #
Winter 1995: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 03 units C+ #
* These changes, adopted h\ the Faculty Senate on f/INi, do not affect the grading systems and registration procedures used in courses within the Officc ot the I diversity Registrar.

beginning with the tall quarter, 1995. These policies apply to all undergraduate
students and to all graduate students with the following exceptions: 1) these policies
do not apply to any student enrolled in the M.I), program through the Medical
School: 2) these policies do not apply to any student in the University taking a
course in the I aw School or the Business School (this would include, for example, a

What to do if you still have questions.
lhe revised grading policies establish new dates for adding and dropping courses
and units and for withdrawing from classes. The dates for each of the quarters of
the 1995-96 academic year are noted in the enclosed information. These dates will be
adhered to strictly by the Registrar's Office. All changes to your academic schedule
up to the deadline dates may be done through the Axess system.
Ihe new grading policies also establish a new grade of "NP" (Not Passed) as a grade
that may be given to a student in a regularly graded course (i.e., a course that is
graded A. B, C, D) who has not done passing work in a course.
Incomplete grades are to be requested by students by the last day of classes. It is the
instructor's prerogative to determine whether an incomplete grade is warranted and]
to establish the conditions under which the incomplete will be given. However, at
the end ol one calendar year, any incomplete grade that is still on a student's record
will automatically be converted to an NP or NC by the Registrar's Office. Faculty are
under no obligation to accept work from a student to change the NP or NC grade to a
regular grade one calendar year after the course has ended.

A new notation. NP ("Not Passed"), will be used in place of the "NC" in courses taken for a letter grade but not passed.
The "NC will continue to be used to represent unsatisfactory performance in courses taken on a satisfactory/no credit
basis. 'NC and "NP" notations recorded for courses after Summer 1994-95 will be visible on student transcripts.
A new notation of "CR" ("Credit") will replace the "+" previously used when a student's performance has been
satisfactory in a course s/he elected to take on a satisfactory/no credit basis. The "S" will continue to be used in courses
where satisfactory/no credit grading is not student-elected, but instructor-mandated. There is no change for either "CR" or
"S" m requiring C- or better performance.
A new notation of "W" ("Withdrew") will be recorded when a student withdraws from a course between the start of the
sth and the end of the Bth week of the quarter. This notation will be visible on student transcripts.
As stated below. the Registrar's Office will replace the original grade recorded for a course with a new notation, "RP"
("Repeated Course"), when a student retakes the course. This notation will be visible on student transcripts.
B. INCOMPLETES
Incompletes in courses taken in 1994-95 or later must be changed to a permanent grade or notation within one year (i.e.
prior to the first day of the fifth quarter which follows the course, including Summer Quarter). If the"I" remains
uncleared after that time, it will be changed automatically by the Registrar's Office to a "NC" or "NP" as appropriate for
the grading option selected. Also, students may not drop courses in which an Incomplete ("I" notation) was awarded, if
those courses were taken in 1994-95 or later.
Note that these policies do not apply to Incompletes in courses taken prior to Autumn 1994-95. Those "I"s will remain as
they are on students' records until they are either dropped by the student or cleared by a grade from the instructor.
C. COURSE RETAKES
A student may retake ONCE any course s/he completed (regardless of grade or notation earned - "NC", "I",
whatever!) or from which s/he withdrew and have the original grade or notation replaced by the notation "RP" (for
"repeated course"). When retaking a course, the student must register for the same number of units as when s/he
originally took the course, and the course number must match EXACTLY the department number, course number, and
suffix of the original course. Courses without matching numbers cannot be assumed to be equivalent and will not be
accepted as retakes.
If the course is being offered with a choice of grading options (letter grade or CR/NC), the student may, adhering to the

Incompletes in courses taken in 1994-95 or later must be changed to a permanent grade or notation within one year (i.e.
prior to the first day of the fifth quarter which follows the course, including Summer Quarter). If the"I" remains
uncleared after that time, it will be changed automatically by the Registrar's Office to a "NC" or "NP" as appropriate for
the grading option selected. Also, students may not drop courses in which an Incomplete ("I" notation) was awarded, if
those courses were taken in 1994-95 or later.
Note that these policies do not apply to Incompletes in courses taken prior to Autumn 1994-95. Those "I"s will remain as
they are on students' records until they are either dropped by the student or cleared by a grade from the instructor.
C. COURSE RETAKES
A student may retake ONCE any course s/he completed (regardless of grade or notation earned - "NC", "I",
whatever!) or from which s/he withdrew and have the original grade or notation replaced by the notation "RP" (for
"repeated course"). When retaking a course, the student must register for the same number of units as when s/he
originally took the course, and the course number must match EXACTLY the department number, course number, and
suffix of the original course. Courses without matching numbers cannot be assumed to be equivalent and will not be
accepted as retakes.
If the course is being offered with a choice of grading options (letter grade or CR/NC), the student may, adhering to the
usual deadline for electing a grading option, elect whichever grading option s/he wants (regardless of which grading
option was elected when the course was taken for the first time).
Upon completion of the retake, the Registrar's Office will automatically change three things in the student's record: the
units for the first time the course was taken will be reduced to 00, the grade for that first time will be changed to an "RP",
and the grade for the second time will be specially (lagged on the student's transcript to indicate that it is a repeated
course. The student's record would then carry entries similar to this:
Autumn 1994: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 00 units RP
Autumn 1995: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 03 units C #
A student may not retake a course again in the future (for a third time), unless s/he received a "NC" or "NP" when s/he
took it for the second time. Upon completion of the third attempt, the Registrar's Office will automatically change the
units for the second time to (X), and the third time will appear on the transcript with its units, grade, and the special flag to
indicate that it is a repeated course. The end result will look like this:
Autumn 1994: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 00 units RP
Autumn 1995: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 00 units NP #
Winter 1995: Physics 019 Intro to Physics 03 units C+ #
* These changes, adopted h\ the Faculty Senate on f/INi, do not affect the grading systems and registration procedures used in courses within the Officc ot the I diversity Registrar.

Printed below is a description of the new grading policies that will be in effect
beginning with the tall quarter, 1995. These policies apply to all undergraduate
students and to all graduate students with the following exceptions: 1) these policies
do not apply to any student enrolled in the M.I), program through the Medical
School: 2) these policies do not apply to any student in the University taking a
course in the I aw School or the Business School (this would include, for example, a
I'll.I), student in Fconomics taking a course in the Business School who would follow
the rules ol the Business School only lor the course being taken through the
Business School).
When to withdraw from courses.
What happens to repeated courses.
New grades and symbols (NP. W, CR, RP)
What to do if you still have questions.
lhe revised grading policies establish new dates for adding and dropping courses
and units and for withdrawing from classes. The dates for each of the quarters of
the 1995-96 academic year are noted in the enclosed information. These dates will be
adhered to strictly by the Registrar's Office. All changes to your academic schedule
up to the deadline dates may be done through the Axess system.
Ihe new grading policies also establish a new grade of "NP" (Not Passed) as a grade
that may be given to a student in a regularly graded course (i.e., a course that is
graded A. B, C, D) who has not done passing work in a course.
Incomplete grades are to be requested by students by the last day of classes. It is the
instructor's prerogative to determine whether an incomplete grade is warranted and]
to establish the conditions under which the incomplete will be given. However, at
the end ol one calendar year, any incomplete grade that is still on a student's record
will automatically be converted to an NP or NC by the Registrar's Office. Faculty are
under no obligation to accept work from a student to change the NP or NC grade to a
regular grade one calendar year after the course has ended.
A detailed description of all Stanford grading policies may be found in the Stanford
Bulletin, pages 49-50 and 54-57. If you have further questions concerning the new
grading policies, please see Chcrene Marchant in the Registrar's Office, Grades

A new notation of "CR" ("Credit") will replace the "+" previously used when a student's performance has been
satisfactory in a course s/he elected to take on a satisfactory/no credit basis. The "S" will continue to be used in courses
where satisfactory/no credit grading is not student-elected, but instructor-mandated. There is no change for either "CR" or
"S" m requiring C- or better performance.
