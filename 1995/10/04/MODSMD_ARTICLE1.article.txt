# A 						new RA role?
## ZAP incident and new administration raise questions about alcohol policy 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
A change of administration at the Res
idential Education Office and the arrest
of a ZAP resident assistant on indecent
exposure charges are fueling a campus
wide tightening of the University's alco
hol policy, according to some RAs.
While administrators insist that nei
ther the alcohol policy itself nor the RAs'
role in enforcing that policy have
changed, some RAs claim that the Uni
versity has in recent weeks increased
pressure to monitor fellow students,
making the RAs wary of losing their jobs.
"They have interpreted |the policy! so
that if someone is drinking to excess, we
are to approach t hem and . . . more or less
stop them," said Terra RA Mark Elson.
Some RAs also complained that ad
ministrators seem unwilling to speak
about the issue and that Row RAs were
given unclear instructions at a meeting
last Thursday.
University officials responded to their

concerns by stressing the legal responsi
bility of the University to obey state law
and the RAs' status as employees and
representatives of the University.
"Apparently, some RAs felt that they
could break the law and University policy
and that it would be inappropriate for us
to challenge them on that," said Row Res
idence Dean Patricia Polhemus, who said
she did not attend the Thursday meeting.
RAs have asked for a written clarifica
tion of their role, Elson said, and another
meeting has been scheduled for this
Thursday.
"They're trying to draw a clear line for
us as to when to step into a dangerous or
abusive situation," said Hans Mitteleu
ropa RA Robin Wall. "But the role has [al
ready j changed a little bit
Central to the new sense of urgency
about alcohol is the ZAP incident, which
occurred during Orientation week. Ac
cording to police reports, then-house
manager Michael Eubanks startled two
female ZAP residents by walking
naked into their room at 4 a.m.
Eubanks, 20, admitted to
drinking that night; both he and
the two women involved have
since left the house.
The disruptive incident raised
concerns over whether ZAP KA
Bobby Yeh, also 20, will be held
accountable as a "community
builder" for the actions of his peers.
Senior Mary Abad, an RA at
553 Mayfield, got the impression
that the University, without
changing its policy, was putting
increased pressure on RAs.
"We're not supposed to do any
thing, but then our jobs would be
on the line, and that isn't fair,"
Abad said.

University administrators
have attempted to clear up the
issue by sticking to carefully craft
ed positions.
"There's nothing in the KA
position description that says
they are the enforcers of the Uni
versity's alcohol policy," said Res
Ed Director Jane Camarillo, who
was hired last May.
She also added that University
policy and California state law
forbid the sale or provision of
alcohol to minors.
So far, the issue has mainly
circulated among the 35 How
RAs, some of whom say they have
altered their behavior in response
to the increased pressure. Haus
Mitt, in a switch from last year,
has decided to add a social chair
to its house staff. Abad said she
has warned 553 Mayfield resi
dents against incautious alcohol
use.

Hut the presence at last Thurs
day's meeting of Residence Deans
Lisa Webb and Andy Hernandez
suggested to some that a new,
stricter tone could spread to other
parts of campus.
Some liAs, such as Enchanted
Broccoli Forest RA Y.K. Tsai, say
the whole thing was "no big deal,"
while administrators say they are
continuing to work things out
with RAfl.
Yeh, on the other hand, said he
has "learned a lot" from his
recent experiences.
"There is blatant abuse of alco
hol on this campus, and the Uni
versity needs to do all it can to
enforce its policy," he said. "When
the University had a policy and
the houses weren't enforcing it,
it's equivalent to having no policy
at all. . . . What happens when
somebody actually breaks the pol
icy â€” that's a little hazy."
