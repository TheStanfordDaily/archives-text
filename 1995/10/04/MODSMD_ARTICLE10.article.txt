# 16 months: following the Simpson story
## 
### 
(AP) â€” At the beginning, in
summer 1994, Simpson's
formidable defense team faced an
uphill battle against a prosecution
team armed with powerful circum
stantial evidence: a blood trail load
ing from Ms. Simpson's condo
minium to the bedroom of her ex
husband's estate, blood in his
Bronco, a bloody glove found on a
pathway behind his house, and
hair and fiber evidence that prose
cutors said were direct links to
Simpson.
And then there was the murder
timeline, which prosecutors tried
to establish with an odd array of
witnesses, including Simpson's
unconventional house guest and a
young limousine driver.
Simpson's lawyers claimed the
timeline was speculative and didn't
make sense. Simpson had sched
uled a flight to Chicago and a
limousine pickup to the airport the
night of the killings. Prosecutors
Marcia Clark and Christopher Har
den claimed Simpson had time to
drive to Ms. Simpson's residence,
two miles from his estate, slash
and hack two people to death,
escape with only a cut finger and
return home to change out of
bloody clothes, dispose of a weapon
and leave for the airport.
I )NA analysts offered mind-bog
gling statistics suggesting Simp
son's blood was not merely one-in
a-million likely to be linked to the
killings, but the only blood type on
the planet likely to show up at the
crime scene.
The prosecution took six
months to present one of the most

elaborate cases ever mounted by
the office of District Attorney (iil
Garcetti.
But the defense, dared by Hard
en to "put up or shut up," told
jurors there was reasonable doubt.
Yes, Simpson's blood was pre
sent, they said. But it was planted
by over-zealous police detectives.
The glove behind the house was
also planted, they stud, and they
singled out one rogue detective
with racist leanings as the archi
tect of a conspiracy to get Simpson.
Mark Fuhrman's name became
almost as famous as Simpson's.
For a time, it seemed he was on
trial. A series of audiotapes in
which he spouted racist vitriol and
uttered an abhorrent epithet sur
faced toward trial's end and turned
the case topsy-turvy. Jurors were
allowed to hear only a snippet of
the new evidence, and Fuhrman
returned to the stand outside their
presence, invoking Fifth Amend
ment protection against self
incrimination.
Clark admitted in closing argu
ments that Fuhrman was"the
worst the LAP I) had to offer" and
tried to distance the prosecution
case from him. But it was too late.
Fuhrman had been a key link in
finding too much of the evidence.
In final arguments, Cochran
denounced Fuhrman as a "racist,
genocidal perjurer" and urged
jurors to send ;i message th:it such
behavior would not be tolerated.
"Maybe you are the right people
at the right time in the right place
to say: 'No more!' he told the
majority-black jury He urged ;i

message against racism and police
corruption that would reach a
waiting world.
The Browns and the Goldmans
have filed civil lawsuits against

Simpson seeking money for the
murders they insist he committed,
and yesterday's not guilty verdicts
in the criminal case will not affect
those proceedings.
