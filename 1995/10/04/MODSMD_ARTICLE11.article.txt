# Reactions across the country
## 
### 
(AP) — It was as if an entire
nation was holding its breath
and, m an instant, let it. go in a
sigh, a gasp, a whoop and a curse.
"Oh my God!" shouted a facto
ry worker in Toledo, Ohio. "Yes!"
exclaimed an airport worker in
Chicago. "I just can't believe
this!" said a YMCA staffer in Con
cord, N.H.
Once again, people stopped
what they were doing. Once
again, they turned to television or
radio. And once again, what they
saw and heard seemed almost too
much to believe.
In the minutes ticking up to the
verdict, the response was almost
universal. People were mostly
quiet, jittery. Some cracked jokes,
seemingly to break the tension.
"This is sooo agonizing," said one
woman in New York.
After the verdict was read -
after the court clerk crisply pro
nounced Simpson innocent of the
murders — the reactions varied
from place to place, and from race
to race.
Cheers outweighed any other
response from the multiracial
crowd outside the Los Angeles
courthouse where Simpson was
tried. The reaction was similar

outside the NBC studio in New
York, where the crowd was most
ly white, young and dressed in
conservative"business attire.
"There WILL bo a Naked Gun
Part IV!" one young New Yorker
veiled. The crowd laughed.
But elsewhere — at a senior
citizen's center in Concord, at a
shopping mall in Toledo — the
response was mostly limited to
gasps of shock.
There were exceptions, to be
sure, but most blacks seemed
relieved and pleased by the ver
dict, while whites seemed far
more divided. Some people
argued that the verdict was a tri
umph of the justice system; oth
ers said it was a triumph of
money and fame
With some people shaking
their heads, the silent crowd
broke up and slowly left the store.
One of them, 30-year-old Ray
Mason, said he had follow**! the
case since the beginning and
could not miss seeing the verdict
read.
"I left work to see this," he
said. "This is the biggest thing in
my lifetime. This is the biggest
thing since man walked on the
moon."
