## Editorials Federal Budget Cuts 
### 
Senate cuts will hurt
students and they are
only the beginning.

COLLEGE STUDENTS
ARE said to be among the
most politically apathetic
souls on the planet. Who can
blame them? After all, their
schedules are ususally stretched
to the limit with classes and
social events. The last thing
they want is to be hassled with a
political issue.
But Congress has just created
a major hurdle that affects a
majority of Stanford students
and college students across the
country. Last week, the Senate
Labor and Human Resources
Committee voted to cut $10.8
billion from the federal student
loan program as part of the
Republican drive to balance the
budget in the coming years.
In addition to charging col
leges a .85 percent levy on loans
they make, the committee also
approved the elimination of the
grace period in which students
have the interest on their loans
subsidized by the government.
The added fee, which
amounts to nothing more than a
tax on education, will cost the
University $2 76,000 a year,
according to Cynthia Rife, assis
tant director of financial aid.
Rife did not specify how the
office would replace the lost
funds, should the cuts become
legislation. She would say only
that "the funds would have to
found somewhere."
We can see only one place
where additional funds can be
raised — by passing the cost of
the charge to students. The
other alternative is no less pal
itable — reducing aid packages
received by students who will
probably be reevaluated as being
"less needy" to cover the loss.
Our ultimate fear is that the
policy of need-blind admissions
mav have to be reconsidered if

the aid budget is stretched any
further.
The Senate committee rea
sons that these cuts will be, in
the long run, beneficial to all
Americans because they will
reduce the size of the federal
deficit for future generations.
While their goal is lauditory,
their logic is analogous to a per
son trying to save money by
starving themself. Republican
plans, passed in their current
form, are going to starve the
educational base of our nation
by raising considerably the cost
of getting a college education,
plain and simple.
As disasterous as all this
sounds, unbelievably, the situa
tion could have been worse. Stu
dents and college adminstrators
who rallied en masse to protest
the scope of the cuts put off
additional targets that include
the PLUS loan program, direct
student lending programs , stu
dent work programs, and the
interest subsidy for loans while
students are stil in school.
According to some estimates, if
all the cuts go into place, the
cost of loans for students
attending undergraduate and
graduate instituations could
soar up to 50 percent.
But the reprive is only tempo
rary. Committee chair Nancy
Kassenbaum is poised to take a
$1.15 billion cut out of the
direct loan program by lowering
the volume of loans. Already,
Stanford administrators and
student groups like the Council
of Presidents have mobilized
with colleges across the country
to try to stem the flow of the
Republican cuts.
We support the efforts of Uni
versity administrators and
greatly encourage more stu
dents to join campus groups in
fighting this ill-conceived attack
on aid programs that helps a
majority of students attend
Stanford. We must show
Congress that college students
are well capable political
activism
