Response to the great PC-Macintosh debate

Mr. Silverton, who is majoring in
the science, technology, and soci
ety field, has stated in his letter,
"We need more PCs and fewer Macs on
this campus," that "of course, if he [Mac
evangelistl had Internet Phone on a PC
like I do, I wouldn't have to pay the long
distance charges ... I think I'll call
Mac Man collect and put his name on
MCl's 'Friends' list."
I think that Mr. Silverton should check

the facts first before implying strongly
that Mac users do not have access to the
software in question, Internet Phone, or
any other software similiar to it. As a mat
ter of fact, there has been such a piece of
software available on the Internet for
Macintosh users and has been available
for a long time, probably as long as the PC
version of the Internet Phone. The name
of the application is Net Phone and is
made by a company in Israel. Moreover, a

free demo version of the Net Phone is
available on all info-mac ftp sites on the
Internet such as sumex-aim. Stanford,edu,
amug.org, ftp.hawaii.edu, etc. The direc
tory path is / pub / mirrors / info
mac / com m / tcp / net-phone
123.demo.hqx. I have checked this demo
application and have even received some
Net calls from a good friend of mine in
Florida who has the full version of Net-
Phone.

In conclusion, there is indeed an
Internet phone application available for
all Macintosh users and I urge them to
check out the free demo version of Net-
Phone available on all info-mac ftp sites.
I also suggest that Mr. Silverton should
do the same in case his PC crashes
again.
