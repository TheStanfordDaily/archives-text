# Campus viewpoint
## Sherri Taylor A 						queer perspective of Stanford 
### 
As the now school
year has begun
and the campus is
buzzing with activities
for both fresh and famil
iar faces, I have been
asked to lx> the big 'ol
political lesbian that 1
sometimes am and reflect
on my experience as a

queer woman at Stanford.
Many of you know or will come to know
how easy it is to develop a kind of tunnel
vision here on "The Farm." It is easy to fall
into believing that everyone is as easygoing
and mellow as your immediate peer group.
It was no different for me during the time I
came out. I came out to my friends in my
sophomore year and was treat<nl with the
same respect, acceptance, and support that
I had always been given. The only notice
able difference was that now I could talk
about my crush on Jane Doe instead of fak
ing a crush on John Doe. I was also pleas
antly surprised to hear many of my friends
using gender neutral terms during conver
sation instead of assuming heterosexuality.
If you haven't guessed, my friends are won
derful but, I soon realized that they are
exceptionally progressive people.
In those early years I didn't consider
myself a "political" queer. I wore my pink
triangle on my backpack, came out to vari
ous other people when and if I felt it was
appropriate and that was enough for me.

My birth as an activist occurred during the
week following the Segal incident. I won't
go into details, but in the *93-'94 school year
the statue entitled "Gay Liberation" was
vandalized by a group of drunken young
men belonging to particular fraternities and
athletic teams. Now, I'm not here to beat a
dead horse, but the Segal incident played a
pivotal role in my decision to become politi
cal. I was aware that what the vandals had
done was wrong, yet there was something
more. The defaced statue depicts people
queer people.
A few days after the vandalization, I was
speaking with some friends about their feel
ings concerning the week's events because I
wasn't sure how I felt. I asked a bisexual
friend of mine why she was involved in get
ting immediate redress from the parties
involved and she said, "It doesn't matter if
the statue is beautiful or ugly that is not the
[joint for me. I believe that there is an
undercurrent of intolerance for bisexual,
lesbian, and gay people on this campus that
has been ignored far too long. Inevitably it
comes to a head and something like this
happens. If we are to prepare ourselves as
queers to go out into the 'real' world then
we have to open our eyes and our mouths
when an injustice Ls committed. What if I
had been walking by the statue with my
lover when it was being vandalized? What
could've happened?" I'm not sure this
woman knows what an impact her words
had on me, but I have not been able to for

get them and I don't ever want to. I thought
about her words and began to get angry. I
wa.s angry with the University for not being
quick to execute punishment. I was angry at
the vandals. How dare these people (who
didn't even know me) make me feel threat
ened in what 1 have come to know as my
home? 1 associated the feeling with how I
felt the first time some ignorant person, also
drunk, allied me a nigger and 1 decided then
to channel my anger and frustration posi
tively. ()ne can only lx> angry and frustrated
for so long, right?
I was able to find my place bv participat
ing in the Lesbian, (Jay, and Bisexual (LGB)
Speaker's Bureaus. For those of you who
don't know, the LGB Speaker's Bureaus are
panels of various L(IB Stanford students
who take time from their schedules and
lives to talk about their personal experience
of being queer at Stanford and in gener
al. Generally, 1 find the panels to be a blast.
I like telling people what it feels like for me
to be a queer woman of color at Stanford
and in everyday life. This past year howev
er, I was able to gain much more insight
into my own beliefs because my audience
was limited to a specific group of Stanford
students — fraternity men.
When I was approached to do the frater
nity panels I immediately said, "yes!" I was
ready to butt heads with each of them, find
out that the stereotypical fraternity man

does indeed exist, and come away
feeling infinitely superior. What I
didn't expect was to learn a little
bit more about myself, meet some
very cool people and have some
really interesting conversations.
These guys are great! 1 loved being
a panel member on the fraternity
panels. I went to each one feeling
extremely anxious and ready to
leave depressed and irritated but
instead I always left the bouses
feeling good. 1 admit to being sur
prised at the number of thoughtful
questions and comments.

The one thing that 1 am most
appreciative to them for is their
let's-get-down-to-t he-nitty-grit ty-
HONESTY. 1 feel that there was a
true forum for some honest dia
logue. I mean these men weren't
afraid to tell me how they felt and
why they felt that way. They were
also quick to admit lack of specific
reasons for their feelings and / or
total ignorance of certain LGB
issues. Both the audience and the
panelists "let it all hang out" so to
speak, and in doing so we were able
to talk, — really talk — about how
we felt. It was unbelievably
refreshing.
Lest I over-romanticize this sit
uation, there were moments dur
ing which I was at my wits end

with all of them. I just wanted to
call them all fascist pigs who were
over-compensating for their small
genitals, go home, and stop trying
to converse with them. But, I have
found that at those exact moments,
I learned more about myself.
At one point, a fraternity man
asked me why queers have to be
political all of the time, "you know,
kissing in public and all that." My
response to him was that not
everything a queer person does is
political or is meant to be taken as
political. If I want to kiss my girl
friend, then 1 want to kiss my girl
friend and you can l>et that it's not
for anyone else's benefit. Leave a
tender moment alone.
My response to his question was

a small revelation from myself to
myself, hence, now I call myself a
part-time political lesbian. I had
several other mini-self-revelations
due to some fraternity man's ques
tioning. It was an excellent learn
ing experience for me, and now I
am better equipped to answer
questions about my beliefs because
they have undergone a "trial by
fire."
Well, 1 m sure you 've all enjoyed
my reminiscing and are more than
eager for me to bid you farewell,
but allow me to tell you a short
story. One evening, after doing a
fraternity panel, the other two
male members and I were walking
back to the Coffee I louse to have
some instant energy and talk about

the evening. It had been one of the
more frustrating and tedious pan
els, so we really needed to reassure
each other that we had been as
attentive and tolerant as possible.
We noticed a black Jeep following
us and one man joked, "Oh, they've
come to get us now, heh-heh!"
We all knew that his words rang
far too true for many queer people,
and chose to fill the silence with
nervous laughter. Instinctively
picking up our pace, we hurried
down the street which of course
was dimly lit and densely packed
with shrubs and trees. The Jeep
stopped and a man jumped out
shouting, "Hey! Wait right there!"
I looked at the men that I was with
and saw genuine panic registered

on their faces. I can't imagine what
kind of emotions were passing over
my own. The man ran toward us
and he said, "I just wanted to
thank you for coming tonight. I'm
a member of [the fraternity] and I
thought that what you had to say
was really good. It made me think
about my views a lot. I'm sorry if I
scared you guys, but you know
inside the house and all . . . well,
that's all I wanted to say. Bye." He
ran back to his Jeep and headed
back to his house — the house he
felt he had to leave in order to
thank us.

Sherri Taylor can be seen at the
Coffee House and at the occasional
fraternity sponsored soiree.
