# Campus viewpoint
## Sherri Taylor A
						queer perspective of Stanford 
### 
As the now school
year has begun
and the campus is
buzzing with activities
for both fresh and famil
iar faces, I have been
asked to lx> the big 'ol
political lesbian that 1
sometimes am and reflect
on my experience as a

queer woman at Stanford.
Many of you know or will come to know
how easy it is to develop a kind of tunnel
vision here on "The Farm." It is easy to fall
into believing that everyone is as easygoing
and mellow as your immediate peer group.
It was no different for me during the time I
came out. I came out to my friends in my
sophomore year and was treat<nl with the
same respect, acceptance, and support that
I had always been given. The only notice
able difference was that now I could talk
about my crush on Jane Doe instead of fak
ing a crush on John Doe. I was also pleas
antly surprised to hear many of my friends
using gender neutral terms during conver
sation instead of assuming heterosexuality.
If you haven't guessed, my friends are won
derful but, I soon realized that they are
exceptionally progressive people.
In those early years I didn't consider
myself a "political" queer. I wore my pink
triangle on my backpack, came out to vari
ous other people when and if I felt it was
appropriate and that was enough for me.

My birth as an activist occurred during the
week following the Segal incident. I won't
go into details, but in the *93-'94 school year
the statue entitled "Gay Liberation" was
vandalized by a group of drunken young
men belonging to particular fraternities and
athletic teams. Now, I'm not here to beat a
dead horse, but the Segal incident played a
pivotal role in my decision to become politi
cal. I was aware that what the vandals had
done was wrong, yet there was something
more. The defaced statue depicts people
queer people.
A few days after the vandalization, I was
speaking with some friends about their feel
ings concerning the week's events because I
wasn't sure how I felt. I asked a bisexual
friend of mine why she was involved in get
ting immediate redress from the parties
involved and she said, "It doesn't matter if
the statue is beautiful or ugly that is not the
[joint for me. I believe that there is an
undercurrent of intolerance for bisexual,
lesbian, and gay people on this campus that
has been ignored far too long. Inevitably it
comes to a head and something like this
happens. If we are to prepare ourselves as
queers to go out into the 'real' world then
we have to open our eyes and our mouths
when an injustice Ls committed. What if I
had been walking by the statue with my
lover when it was being vandalized? What
could've happened?" I'm not sure this
woman knows what an impact her words
had on me, but I have not been able to for

get them and I don't ever want to. I thought
about her words and began to get angry. I
wa.s angry with the University for not being
quick to execute punishment. I was angry at
the vandals. How dare these people (who
didn't even know me) make me feel threat
ened in what 1 have come to know as my
home? 1 associated the feeling with how I
felt the first time some ignorant person, also
drunk, allied me a nigger and 1 decided then
to channel my anger and frustration posi
tively. ()ne can only lx> angry and frustrated
for so long, right?
I was able to find my place bv participat
ing in the Lesbian, (Jay, and Bisexual (LGB)
Speaker's Bureaus. For those of you who
don't know, the LGB Speaker's Bureaus are
panels of various L(IB Stanford students
who take time from their schedules and
lives to talk about their personal experience
of being queer at Stanford and in gener
al. Generally, 1 find the panels to be a blast.
I like telling people what it feels like for me
to be a queer woman of color at Stanford
and in everyday life. This past year howev
er, I was able to gain much more insight
into my own beliefs because my audience
was limited to a specific group of Stanford
students â€” fraternity men.
When I was approached to do the frater
nity panels I immediately said, "yes!" I was
ready to butt heads with each of them, find
out that the stereotypical fraternity man
