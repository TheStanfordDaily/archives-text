## A 						selection from the private letters 
### 
The last love letter I wrote was, for
several reasons, neither sent nor
received. I put it out now so that at
least someone will read it. Names have
been altered to protect the embittered.
Sweet Kimberly,
It was so hard to watch you leave the
other night — my contacts had dried out
and I was all out of saline.
But still, 1 thought as I lay myself to
sleep, how nice life is that you could be
my last thought before slumber strikes.
So much nicer than those recurring
images of Mrs. Renson, my elementary
school nurse. 1 wonder what ever hap
pened to her. . . .
Such awful, naughty thoughts 1 have
of you. Things Mother would lie ashamed
to hear. Yet still she insists on hearing
everything. Though, it is certainly good
to see her take such an interest in our
relationship. In fact, only yesterday she
asked me for your room key and a list of
times you are sure not to be home.
What of my feelings? I can't sleep. I
feel the scratches on my back and my
heart goes pitter-pat. Who'd have
thought rolling over on a cat would be so

traumatic? I do hope you have Cleo's
claws clipped before I spend the night
again.
I must admit, it embarrasses me to
speak so frankly of sex, especially since
we have not had it yet. Hut you did
promise it would be soon — as you said,
"When O.J. walks. . . ." Rejoice!
Your devotion knows no end, and for
that reason alone I feel I can overcome
any obstacles to our union. Not to men
tion I have been working out voraciously
and am confident that your boyfriend will
be a surmountable adversary by the end
of the month. Next time you will drive
him to the hospital, I promise.
Oh, but your boyfriend — why do you
insist on retaining him? Is it the checks?
His car? The adventure of dating a mar
ried man? Or do you have genuine feel
ings for him?
I torture myself trying to understand
your motives — so hard, sometimes I
bleed. Sometimes you seem so inconsis
tent to me: you tell me to meet you by the
Dish at midnight, yet you refuse to tell
me which day. I will try again tomorrow.
And then how you snapped at me for
speaking to you in public. I, more than
anyone, want to keep your honor intact,

but 1 sincerely doubt my asking you to
stop throwing pebbles at me will arouse
suspicion. You're such a dirt!
I guess it's like Ari said: "You just
can't understand women, not without a
proper autopsy."
Hut look at poor Ari: 25 and still a vir
gin. It was so nice of you to sit up with
him last night. He seemed so much the
better for it this morning. Like a new
man. Whatever it was you said to him
must have really done the trick.
You do have such a wonderful effect on
people. For example, after meeting you.
Mother began drinking again and seems
much happier now. . . so at peace. And
my brother hasn't eaten a thing since he
heard we were dating. He looks great. As
for myself, I've been enjoying my meals
more than ever — that is, since you start
ed letting me eat in the restaurant with
you when I buy you dinner.
My mind is flooded with thoughts of
you; my pillow's soaked.
Only recently I finished reading your
short story. It was, of course, exceptional.
Though I worried at times you may have
borrowed from my history for your char
acter, "Heinrich." Do you really think me
so bleak? So guileless? Do you think I

will, as you said, . . spend my remain
ing years retching in the squalor of (my|
own dementia?"
For my own part, 1 see in me a future
with promise. I have always been a
dreamer, but now, with you, sweet Kim
berly, 1 feel I truly can accomplish any
thing. I'm even thinking of retaking Stats
60. Who knows? Soon, maybe, I will be
able to dress myself.
Oh, but those are just the short-term
fantasies. Soon, off to the real world
where, with you by my side, I will make a
difference. I promise. Perhaps I can serve
the world as I do you, though I don't
know if 1 have the time to do all that vac
uuming. What a grand planet it would be
if the world governments adopt my plan
of thumb wrestling over border disputes.
No more wars, no more hatred! Only
grown men holding hands, thinking it
battle.
I thought some on the dream you had
that you told me of and I think I disagree
with your interpretation. When you
gave hirth to that snake and it tried to
strangle you, 1 don't think that was me
at all. And when your mother became a
wide-brimmed hat, I think it may have
had more to do with her overprotective

ness and your sunburn than that kiss
she and 1 shared. Really. When she
dropped the charges, I honestly believed
that the incident was gone from all our
minds.
Sweetest Kimberly, do tell me: What
are these things, these emotions, which
propel me to you? Do they move me for
ward or backward from my destiny? And
will the nausea ever cease?
In perfect poetic form I find myself
enamored of your faults. By mine own
affections they seem to me not defects
but adornments. The missing tooth
becomes a refuge for my tongue, the
bald cusp of your head becomes a
denuded mirror for the light of the
heavens to shine off. . . . The wonder of
you!
I think it was Blake who said it best:
Bagel bagel burning bright
in the fire of the night
I wish I may 1 wish I might
know the Love so fraught with fright.
O' never ne'er will tears impede the sight
of the eyes that behold your precious light.
Sleep well, my dear. And dream about
me if it's at all convenient.

tion I have been working out voraciously
and am confident that your boyfriend will
be a surmountable adversary by the end
of the month. Next time you will drive
him to the hospital, I promise.
Oh, but your boyfriend — why do you
insist on retaining him? Is it the checks?
His car? The adventure of dating a mar
ried man? Or do you have genuine feel
ings for him?
I torture myself trying to understand
your motives — so hard, sometimes I
bleed. Sometimes you seem so inconsis
tent to me: you tell me to meet you by the
Dish at midnight, yet you refuse to tell
me which day. I will try again tomorrow.
And then how you snapped at me for
speaking to you in public. I, more than
anyone, want to keep your honor intact,

but 1 sincerely doubt my asking you to
stop throwing pebbles at me will arouse
suspicion. You're such a dirt!
I guess it's like Ari said: "You just
can't understand women, not without a
proper autopsy."
Hut look at poor Ari: 25 and still a vir
gin. It was so nice of you to sit up with
him last night. He seemed so much the
better for it this morning. Like a new
man. Whatever it was you said to him
must have really done the trick.
You do have such a wonderful effect on
people. For example, after meeting you.
Mother began drinking again and seems
much happier now. . . so at peace. And
my brother hasn't eaten a thing since he
heard we were dating. He looks great. As
for myself, I've been enjoying my meals
more than ever — that is, since you start
ed letting me eat in the restaurant with
you when I buy you dinner.
My mind is flooded with thoughts of
you; my pillow's soaked.
Only recently I finished reading your
short story. It was, of course, exceptional.
Though I worried at times you may have
borrowed from my history for your char
acter, "Heinrich." Do you really think me
so bleak? So guileless? Do you think I

will, as you said, . . spend my remain
ing years retching in the squalor of (my|
own dementia?"
For my own part, 1 see in me a future
with promise. I have always been a
dreamer, but now, with you, sweet Kim
berly, 1 feel I truly can accomplish any
thing. I'm even thinking of retaking Stats
60. Who knows? Soon, maybe, I will be
able to dress myself.
Oh, but those are just the short-term
fantasies. Soon, off to the real world
where, with you by my side, I will make a
difference. I promise. Perhaps I can serve
the world as I do you, though I don't
know if 1 have the time to do all that vac
uuming. What a grand planet it would be
if the world governments adopt my plan
of thumb wrestling over border disputes.
No more wars, no more hatred! Only
grown men holding hands, thinking it
battle.
I thought some on the dream you had
that you told me of and I think I disagree
with your interpretation. When you
gave hirth to that snake and it tried to
strangle you, 1 don't think that was me
at all. And when your mother became a
wide-brimmed hat, I think it may have
had more to do with her overprotective

ness and your sunburn than that kiss
she and 1 shared. Really. When she
dropped the charges, I honestly believed
that the incident was gone from all our
minds.
Sweetest Kimberly, do tell me: What
are these things, these emotions, which
propel me to you? Do they move me for
ward or backward from my destiny? And
will the nausea ever cease?
In perfect poetic form I find myself
enamored of your faults. By mine own
affections they seem to me not defects
but adornments. The missing tooth
becomes a refuge for my tongue, the
bald cusp of your head becomes a
denuded mirror for the light of the
heavens to shine off. . . . The wonder of
you!
I think it was Blake who said it best:
Bagel bagel burning bright
in the fire of the night
I wish I may 1 wish I might
know the Love so fraught with fright.
O' never ne'er will tears impede the sight
of the eyes that behold your precious light.
Sleep well, my dear. And dream about
me if it's at all convenient.

The last love letter I wrote was, for
several reasons, neither sent nor
received. I put it out now so that at
least someone will read it. Names have
been altered to protect the embittered.
Sweet Kimberly,
It was so hard to watch you leave the
other night — my contacts had dried out
and I was all out of saline.
But still, 1 thought as I lay myself to
sleep, how nice life is that you could be
my last thought before slumber strikes.
So much nicer than those recurring
images of Mrs. Renson, my elementary
school nurse. 1 wonder what ever hap
pened to her. . . .
Such awful, naughty thoughts 1 have
of you. Things Mother would lie ashamed
to hear. Yet still she insists on hearing
everything. Though, it is certainly good
to see her take such an interest in our
relationship. In fact, only yesterday she
asked me for your room key and a list of
times you are sure not to be home.
What of my feelings? I can't sleep. I
feel the scratches on my back and my
heart goes pitter-pat. Who'd have
thought rolling over on a cat would be so

traumatic? I do hope you have Cleo's
claws clipped before I spend the night
again.
I must admit, it embarrasses me to
speak so frankly of sex, especially since
we have not had it yet. Hut you did
promise it would be soon — as you said,
"When O.J. walks. . . ." Rejoice!
Your devotion knows no end, and for
that reason alone I feel I can overcome
any obstacles to our union. Not to men
tion I have been working out voraciously
and am confident that your boyfriend will
be a surmountable adversary by the end
of the month. Next time you will drive
him to the hospital, I promise.
