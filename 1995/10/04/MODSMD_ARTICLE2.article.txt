Amid the emotion and confusion that arose after
the announcement of O.J. Simpson's acquittal, sev
eral Stanford law professors provided some answers
hy focusing their analysis on various aspects of the
i rial.
"The prosecution had a good case, but some er
rors in their presentation gave the defense an op
portunity for an acquittal," said Law School Assoc.
Prof. Kim Taylor-Thompson. "For example, the
prosecution decided not to bring in the freeway
chase, which would have entitled them to instruct
the jury to consider it to be flight, and thus con
sciousness of guilt."
Moreover, the defense provided the reasonable
doubt necessary fort ho not guilty verdict, Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg said. "The defense is not required
to prove that Simpson is innocent," he added.
Creating this doubt was a major strategy in the
defense's case, Taylor-Thompson said.
"The defense factored into (he minds of the ju
rors that t hey could not trust 1 lead detectives] Mark
Fuhrman or Phillip Van Adder," Taylor-Thompson
said. "What lias been cast as an issue of race is real
ly an issue of trust with the |Los Angeles Police De
partment!. If people cannot trust the evidence, they
cannot convict."
Law Prof. Miguel Mendez praised the defense's
strategy.
"[Johnnie] Cochran was outstanding in exploit
ing the weaknesses of the prosecution in his closing
argument," Mendez said.
However, the Fuhrman tapes â€” infamous

recordings of Fuhrman relating

were not a major issue in the
verdict, Taylor-Thompson said.
"On the first day of closing
arguments, Cochran was devoted
to listing reasonable doubt," Tay
lor-Thompson said. "He gave
ample reason to find doubt in the
case, without bringing up race."
Taylor-Thompson also gave an
explanation for the jury's short
deliberation time.
"The evidence came in over a
year," she said. "After all, we, who
have just been watching the trial
and leading the rest of our lives,
have already made our conclusion.

Being sequestered, the jurors have
been thinking about nothing else."
Although Simpson may not be
tried by the federal government,
he does face future legal action,
Taylor-Thompson said
"Both the Goldman and Brown
families are filing a civil suit for
wrongful death," Taylor-Thomp
son said.
In addition, Simpson faces a
protracted custody fight with his
children's maternal grandparents,
Weisberg added.
None of the Law School profes
sors said they believed that the
Simpson verdict itself calls for
reform of the justice system.
"People should avoid sound-bite
sanctimony," Weisberg said. "If
they say thus case had made them
more cynical, t hey should in fact feel
delighted. They should recognize

that the opposite usually happens."
Mendez voiced a concern that
people may misuse the Simpson
case to diminish the rights of the
accused.
"They may try to change the
jury unanimity rule in California,
and the number of jurors needed
to convict," Mendez said. "This
case does not justify taking away
these rights. Everyone can be an
accused."
Weisberg also warned against
considering the Simpson case as
representative of the legal system.
"This case is completely atypi
cal as to be irrelevant," he said.
Taylor-Thompson agreed.
"I'm concerned that people will
try the fix the system based on the
case," she said. "People are gener
alizing this unique trial to the
average case."
