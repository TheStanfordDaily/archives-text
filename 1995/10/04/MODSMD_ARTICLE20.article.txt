# Council rejects expansion plan

### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Proponents of a Palo Alto initiative to slow devel
opment breathed a sigh of relief Monday night when
the city council unanimously rejected a propositi that
would have allowed up to 1.5 million additional square
feet of commercial development in the Stanford
Research Park.
A citizen's committee proposed backing the plan to
increase allowable construction space for research
park companies in exchange for a University agree
ment to an "urban limit line" that would reserve cer
tain University land for open space protection. But
Stanford was not interested.
"The real objective was for residents to get Stan
ford to commit land in perpetuity," said Andy Coe,
director of community relations. "From our perspec
tive it was not necessary. We had not asked for extra
space and we already have strong agreements govern
ing open space lands."
Coe said that officials have already reached open
land space preservation agreements.
Land reserve agreements were made in the early
19705, setting aside open space within the research
park for a period of 10 to 20 years in exchange for the
rights to build the 10 million square-foot park, said

Curtis Feeny, executive vice president of the Stanford
Management Company, which oversees the park.
But, he said, it is against the University's founding
charter to dispose of land in perpetuity. "It has been
the position of the University that Stanford land is
inalienable," he said.
Feeny said that, while Stanford did not make the
expansion proposal, some research park companies
may have benefited from the proposed increase since
they have built to capacity.
"If a company needs to expand, we'll work through
the process to make that possible," said Feeny, acknowl
edging that the approval process would be lengthy.
Carol Jansen, who heads economic resource plan
ning for Palo Alto, said such expansion would be "in
the doggone difficult category."
Feeny said that, while he does not expect current
development caps to present an immediate problem,
they could possibly lead to attrition in the future.
One possibility is to allow companies within the
park to transfer development rights, enabling those
companies that have built to capacity to buy the legal
rights of another firm that does not plan to expand.
"But that's very difficult to implement," said
Feeny. The University, the companies involved and
the city would "have to come together to make it work
on a case-by-case basis."
