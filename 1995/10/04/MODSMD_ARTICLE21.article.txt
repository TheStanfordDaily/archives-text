Retired Hoover Institute librarian Mary Lusia
Schofield passed away Sept. '27 in Palo Alto, at the
age of 90.
A native of Palo Alto, she worked as a cataloguer
at Hoover for 40 years until retiring at the age of 71.
During the course of her lifetime, Schofield also
amassed a 10,000-volume collection of children's lit
erature, which is now part of Stanford's collection.
Schofield's connections with Stanford stretched
over almost all of her 90 years, said close friend Carol
Jacobs, beginning with a trip to the University with
her mother when Schofield was six years old.
"She would talk to me often about how her moth
er would go to Stanford when she was married and
Mary was a little girl," Jacobs said.
On these trips, Schofield was introduced to the
libraries that played a major role in her life.

"Mary remembered sitting under the library
tables playing with paper dolls while her mother was
studying," Jacobs said.
Schofield also earned two master's degrees from
Stanford, Jacobs said.
After retiring from Hoover, Schofield taught a
class on the history of children's literature in her
apartment.
"She had these 10,000 books in her little three
room apartment in Kingscote Gardens," Jacobs said.
Schofield collected her books over the course of
many visits to both new and antiquarian bookstores.
"Once, someone showed her some original Beatrix
Potter, and she fell in love with it," Jacobs said.
Jacobs said Schofield was an inspiration to her,
and that the collection is one of the best in children's
literature in the western United States.
"I think that her main interest in life was chil
dren's books, and her love for Stanford. She had a
tremendous love for Stanford.
