Statement by Gerhard Casper, President
on Affirmative Action at Stanford University
October 4, 1995

With increasing frequency, students, faculty, trustees, alumni
and others have asked where Stanford should be on affirmative
action. I determined several months ago to express my own views
on the subject to the Stanford community at the first Faculty Senate
meeting of the fall. Affirmative action involves some of the most
difficult and complex issues in our society Reasonable people
differ on what it means, has meant or ought to mean. In the hope
that it will facilitate further examination and discussion, I offer my
full statement here to the senators, and all of Stanford, in advance
of the Oct. 12 Senate meeting.
â– 
Government-mandated affirmative action began with
President Lyndon Johnsons Executive Order 1 1246 of 1965.
Affirmative action requirements applicable to the employment
decisions of federal contractors, including universities, were
substantially reinforced and extended under President Nixon.
Most regulations originate with the executive branch rather than
Congress, and require outreach, plans, goals, and timetables State
regulations also come into play. Some affirmative action for
instance, in college admissions is voluntary in the sense of not
being mandated by government.
Affirmative action docs not require, and does not mean,
quotas or preferment of unqualified over qualified individuals.
Indeed, such preferment may violate anti-discrimination laws.
Affirmative action is based on the judgment that a policy of true
equal opportunity needs to create opportunities for members of
historically underrepresented groups to be drawn into various walks
of life from which they might otherwise be shut out. Barriers
continue to exist in society, and therefore affirmative action asks
us to cast our net more widely to broaden the competition and to
engage in more active efforts for locating and recruiting applicants.
Of course, the very act of broadening the competition means
that more candidates will seek, and be considered for, the same
finite number of admissions places or employment openings and
the competition for them will therefore be more intense. It would
be hypocritical to suggest that affirmative action, even without
quotas, does not diminish the opportunities for some who, in the
past, might have benefited from a narrower casting of nets or
narrower definitions of merit.
The terms "merit" and "qualified" occasionally are used as if
they were self-defining. Merit, however, ordinarily depends on
many qualities of an individual and on judgments about how their
combination might further the tasks of a university, government
agency, or any other organization. Still. I repeat: Affirmative action
does not justify admitting, hiring, or promoting those who are not
well-qualified for the work ahead of them.
For about 30 years, debate about affirmative action has been
constant, though only occasionally very heated. In 1995. the
discussion has become more intense and much louder. It is not
sufficient to explain this phenomenon in terms of electoral politics.
The politicians are responding to views and opinions whose forceful
expression has triggered, and been triggered by, plans for a referen
dum in California. The "California Civil Rights Initiative," as
presently worded would prohibit using "race, sex, color, ethnicity
or national origin as a criterion tor either discriminating against or
granting preferential treatment" to anyone in public schools,
employment, or contracting. The initiative is not at least not
directly aimed at private institutions such as Stanford University.
It is often unclear why a given public controversy erupts at a
particular moment. I am not an expert on social movements, and
my hunches may or may not have some basis in fact. To me it
seems that a confluence of various trends has led to the present
crescendo concerning affirmative action.
(1) The traditions of our country emphasize the individual
person and individual autonomy rather than group membership.
The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution was
primarily aimed at the unequal treatment of individuals on account
of race. Affirmative action makes group membership a salient
characteristic of an individual. This defining element has left many
Americans uneasy, including some supporters of affirmative action.
(2) Because affirmative action has conferred legal status on
group membership, many are worried about a balkanization of our
society. They are especially concerned about the possibility that
some separatist forms of multiculturalism are incompatible with the
desire of maintaining a more open and more stable country. While
American law mostly forgoes quotas, there is a suspicion that plans,
goals, and timetables represent a "quota mentality."
(3) Claims for the benefits of affirmative action have been
proliferating. They have thus undercut the original rationale for
affirmative action that flowed not exclusively, but primarily, from
the historical grievances of African Americans. Groups that have
been the victims of a multiplicity of social, cultural, religious, and
economic traditions and institutions advance claims that raise
complex questions about the responsibilities and competencies of
government.
(4) Our country, for the last 30 years, has been going through
vast demographic, economic, and social transformations that seem
to bring into question many, if not all, values that once dominated.
Also, economic uncertainties a few decades ago did not seem to
have the comprehensive reach that, for instance, characterizes
present-day "downsizing." As only too many Americans know,
downsizing may leave the unskilled, skilled and highly skilled of
all age groups alike suddenly without jobs. In this setting, educa
tion becomes even more crucial than it has always been. Thus,
getting into a good school that has only a limited number of places
is an urgent desire of many students and their families. They worry
about whether they will receive fair consideration in competitions in
which, at Stanford for example, less than 20 percent of the already
self-selected applicants to the freshmen class are offered admission.
I should like to address further the specific subject of college
admissions at Stanford. To the extent to which I deal with questions
concerning underlying principles, much of what I should like to
say also applies to, or at least has implications for, employment at
Stanford. 1 am making these comments against the background of
the national debate about affirmative action. However, I am re
stricting myself to what Stanford is doing and what, in my view, it
should be doing. I have emphasized in the past, and I repeat now,
that Stanford University is a private institution that has, and should
have, considerable freedom in the pursuit of its educational goals
and ideals.

Let me begin by speaking about what Stanford has stood for
since its founding. When I.eland Stanford and his wife, Jane, lost
their 15-year-old only child, Leland Jr., in 18X4. they decided to use
their wealth to do something for "other people V sons and daugh
ters. This sentiment led to the founding of our university.
In a 1 1 >()2 address, which formally amended the Founding
Grant, Jane Stanford stressed that the moving spirit of the founders
was "love of humanity and a desire to render the greatest possible
service to mankind." I quote: "The University was accordingly
designed for the betterment of mankind morally, spiritually, intellec
tually. physically, and materially. The public at large, and not alone
the comparatively feu students who can attend the University, are
the chief and ultimate beneficiaries of the foundation." The
university's "chief object" was to be "the instruction of students
with a view to producing leaders and educators in every field of
science and industry."
The university's initial policy of not charging tuition was
adopted I again quote Jane Stanford, to "resist the tendency to the
stratification of society, bv keeping open an avenue whereby the
deserving and exceptional may rise through their own efforts from
the lowest to the highest station in life. A spirit of equality must
accordingly be maintained within the University." I point out that
Stanford admitted women when many of its peers would not even
have considered the possibility.
The means that Jane and Leland Stanford chose to implement
their lofty goal "to promote the public welfare" was to found,
endow, and have maintained "a University of high degree." The
quality of the university was the sine qua non for the pursuit of the
more general ends. Nowadays, we would go beyond seeking a
university merely of high degree and instead refer to achieving and
keeping a university of the highest degree.
This ev ocation of our institutional purposes is helpful in
reminding us that it would be exceedingly narrow -minded to assume
that the pursuit of the univ ersity as envisioned in the founding
documents calls for a one-dimensional approach in choosing those
to whom we give the opportunity to study at Stanford. As we look
for the leaders of tomorrow, if all we considered were capacities
measurable on a scale, without taking into consideration other
aspects of being "deserving and exceptional," we would be betray
ing the Founders. We would be betraying the Founders if we
disregarded their stated concern about "the tendency to the stratifi
cation of society."
In the early years of Stanford, to gain admission as an under
graduate, you could choose between taking the university's entrance
examination or presenting certificates from your school that showed
that your grades were a set percentage higher than the lowest
passing grade at the school. In short, you had to demonstrate the
ability to do the work of the university.
Under David Starr Jordan's "radical plan" the only specifi
cally prescribed subject was English, and Stanford, ahead of its
time, considerably liberalized the other admission prerequisites.
This allowed a wider group of students to qualify for admission to
Stanford than under more orthodox systems in which universities
overdetermined the required preparatory subjects and thus limited
the pool of students to the graduates of certain secondary schools.
Most students entered Stanford by certification rather than examina
tion and. in 191 1. the university abolished its own examinations,
relying on the College Entrance Examination Board instead.
Under the influence of Lewis Terman. in 1920 Stanford
additionally began to require an aptitude test. The Stanford test
eventually was supplanted by the SAT. The Committee on Admis
sions used a ten-point system in which school record and aptitude
test received three points each, while four points were reserved for
the Committee's judgment regarding "the student's personal quali
ties, general promise and so on." Since 1950, the university has
been looking for ev idence of a strong academic record in high
school, the results of standardized tests, and three recommendation
letters to confirm qualities of intellectual v itality, character, citizen
ship. and initiative.
These generally applicable considerations were supplemented
by the Faculty Senate in 1986 with a more detailed set of "Criteria
for Undergraduate Admissions." According to the principles laid
down in 19X6, "The primary criterion for admission is academic
excellence" as demonstrated by scholastic performance, scores on
standardized national tests, documented perseverance and attain
ment in activities outside the classroom, the personal statement, and
high school recommendations.
There are no restrictive quotas of any kind and admissions are
decided without regard to an applicant's economic resources.
Stanford seeks undergraduates of varied ethnic, social, cultural,
and economic backgrounds whose talents, achievements, and
characters suit them for leadership. In the case of every person
admitted, there has been a judgment that the applicant is "deserving
and exceptional."
A few categories of applicants certain ethnic minorities,
legacies and athletes receive special consideration provided they
meet these requirements. Children of Stanford alumni receive
preference among applicants of approximately equal qualifications,
as do children of eligible faculty and staff. Furthermore. Stanford is
committed to a substantial presence of African Americans, Mexican
Americans, and Native Americans in the undergraduate student
body. Finally, the Department of Athletics may designate outstand
ing athletes for special attention. The Dean of Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid has final authority over all admissions.
All applicants receive careful consideration and the admis
sions rev iew takes individual circumstances of the applicant into
consideration. These efforts aim at a class characterized by diver
sity in terms of academic interests, artistic and athletic accomplish
ments. leadership qualities, and ethnic and social backgrounds.
Why should we look for such diversity? The main goals are two.
First, we want a rich educational environment to challenge our
students. Students learn much from one another. Second, we want
to be faithful to our task to educate leaders for a diverse and com
plex society a society that will, we hope, overcome the undue
tendencies toward stratification. This cannot be done unless the
country's demographic diversity finds a presence on campus.
We do not admit minorities to do them a favor. We want
students from a variety of backgrounds to help fulfill our educa
tional responsibilities, not. to my mind, to address the effects of
historic discrimination, although that might be a result. University
admissions offices are not set up to sit in judgment on what injus-

tices society should compensate for and who should pay the price.
Furthermore, who possesses the wisdom and insight for the task .'
Admissions decisions, on the basis of an applicant's demonstrated
achievements, should he forward-looking. We must not admit some
and thereby exclude others because we arrogate to ourselves the
power to sort out who owes what to whom.
How an individual applicant has dealt with disadvantage
obviously is relevant to assessments of capability and resilience.
However. I am extremely wary of any admissions process in which
economic and social disadvantage (including dysfunctional home
environments) become categorical criteria to be formally weighed
in decisions about whom to admit as a student. In order to survive
as a sane society, we should not create incentives for ever more
people to think in terms of victimhood or to play the role of victims,
or to suggest that one must be disadvantaged to be given serious
consideration in the college admission process.
Should race and ethnic background be a factor in our decision
making'.' If the invisible hand could be rel ed upon to produce
admissions pools or employment pools that reflect the ideal of equal
opportunity at all levels of society, including in the leadership
positions for which Stanford prepares, special outreach would not
be necessary. If the members of society mostly ignored race and
ethnicity, we could forgo taking them into consideration. We hope
that one day we will be able to do so.
Alas, I think it would be naive to assume that racial and
gender stereotypes do not work against many who would otherwise
be capable of taking advantage of opportunities at all stages of life.
In Fires in the Mirror, the dramatization of the Crown Heights riots
of I 1 ) 1 ) Iby our Stanford colleague Anna Deavere Smith, George
Wolfe talks about venturing outside the African American neighbor
hood in which he had grown up. I quote:
And then I would go beyond a certain point
I was treated like I was insignificant.
Nobody was
hosing me down or calling me nigger.
It was just that I was insignificant.
I strongly believe it remains necessary to level the field, to
recognize that there are vast differences between primary and
secondary schools and how they develop ability, and to make
conscious efforts to increase the presence of underrepresented
minorities at all levels of society. This may even work to the
advantage of a minority applicant who himself does not come from
a disadvantaged economic or cultural background. It is the respon
sibility of educational institutions such as Stanford to find and
educate those who can become the leaders of the future in a
multiethnic and multiracial society. Alas, our society is quite color
conscious. and we therefore cannot yet afford to be colorblind.
I am, of course, fully aware of the fact that my view of the
matter leads me to take into consideration criteria that are very
problematic. There is, first of all, the utter arbitrariness of racial
and ethnic labeling. Boxes to be checked may look neat on paper
but there is little underlying or inherent sense. What is race? What
is a race? What is ethnicity? How do we deal with racial or ethnic
mixing? Why is the child of a black parent and a white parent
classified as black? Why does one-fourth American Indian ancestry
qualify a person as Indian, while slightly less does not? Are the
classifieatory laws of apartheid South Africa what we end up
emulating? Is our way out, self-classification, something to be
fairly relied on? When government and courts dictate race relations,
we quickly get caught in contradictions and absurdities.
These reservations, however, do not diminish my belief that
institutions such as Stanford, if indeed they want to be universities
of the highest degree, need the discretion to do as best they can in
their efforts to find and educate the leaders of tomorrow. As we
pursue our goals, there is no room for categorical preferences, there
is no room for quotas, there is no room for preferring the unquali
fied over the qualified. However, there is also no room with respect
to any applicant for making quantitative, scaleable admissions
criteria the sole touchstones of intellectual vitality, talent, character,
and promise. That has never been the case at Stanford, and I hope it
never will be. It is Stanford's very characteristic that it has never
been one-dimensional and yet it has been able, especially over the
last four decades, to become one of the world's most selective
institutions. Our capacity to pursue many excellences will remain
undiminished as long as we continue to get the balance right and do
not waver in our commitment to quality.
I said at the outset that many who worry about the consider
ation of race and ethnic background in admissions and employment
decisions worry about enhancing the balkanization of American
society. They worry, not without justification, about institutions
falling victim to highly politicized ethnically or racially oriented
groups that pursue their own narrow agendas without care for, or in
direct opposition to. the overall welfare of the institution or society.
Indeed we must at all times guard against enhancing and freezing,
rather than ameliorating, cleavages. We must call attention to the
citizenship held in common.
The university is an institution dedicated to the search to know
the search to know of each member in her or his individual
capacity. A university needs to be integrated in order to pursue its
tasks. Even with affirmative action, students are evaluated and
admitted to Stanford as individuals, not in groups. No university
can thrive unless each member is accepted without regards to labels
and stereotypes. This is the case with students, faculty, and staff.
In a university, the first question in response to an argument must
never be "Does he or she belong to the right group?" Instead the
only criterion must be "Is the argument valid?" An argument must
never be dismissed or accepted ignored or respected because the
speaker is male or female, black or white, American or foreign.
As concerns affirmative action policies - which raise issues
that are among the most difficult that a society can confront - I
think it is of the greatest importance that all those who participate
in the debate refrain from demonizing their opponents.
Maintaining and furthering Stanford University is an incred
ibly delicate task. It is a joint intellectual and moral effort of
faculty, students, trustees, alumni, and local, national, and world
wide friends. I cannot be sure about the answers to my own ques
tions. All of us, on all sides of the issue, are and w ill be open to
criticism. The request I have to make of those who would be critical
is that they also make the effort to understand.

matter leads me to take into consideration criteria that are very
problematic. There is, first of all, the utter arbitrariness of racial
and ethnic labeling. Boxes to be checked may look neat on paper
but there is little underlying or inherent sense. What is race? What
is a race? What is ethnicity? How do we deal with racial or ethnic
mixing? Why is the child of a black parent and a white parent
classified as black? Why does one-fourth American Indian ancestry
qualify a person as Indian, while slightly less does not? Are the
classifieatory laws of apartheid South Africa what we end up
emulating? Is our way out, self-classification, something to be
fairly relied on? When government and courts dictate race relations,
we quickly get caught in contradictions and absurdities.
These reservations, however, do not diminish my belief that
institutions such as Stanford, if indeed they want to be universities
of the highest degree, need the discretion to do as best they can in
their efforts to find and educate the leaders of tomorrow. As we
pursue our goals, there is no room for categorical preferences, there
is no room for quotas, there is no room for preferring the unquali
fied over the qualified. However, there is also no room with respect
to any applicant for making quantitative, scaleable admissions
criteria the sole touchstones of intellectual vitality, talent, character,
and promise. That has never been the case at Stanford, and I hope it
never will be. It is Stanford's very characteristic that it has never
been one-dimensional and yet it has been able, especially over the
last four decades, to become one of the world's most selective
institutions. Our capacity to pursue many excellences will remain
undiminished as long as we continue to get the balance right and do
not waver in our commitment to quality.
I said at the outset that many who worry about the consider
ation of race and ethnic background in admissions and employment
decisions worry about enhancing the balkanization of American
society. They worry, not without justification, about institutions
falling victim to highly politicized ethnically or racially oriented
groups that pursue their own narrow agendas without care for, or in
direct opposition to. the overall welfare of the institution or society.
Indeed we must at all times guard against enhancing and freezing,
rather than ameliorating, cleavages. We must call attention to the
citizenship held in common.
The university is an institution dedicated to the search to know
the search to know of each member in her or his individual
capacity. A university needs to be integrated in order to pursue its
tasks. Even with affirmative action, students are evaluated and
admitted to Stanford as individuals, not in groups. No university
can thrive unless each member is accepted without regards to labels
and stereotypes. This is the case with students, faculty, and staff.
In a university, the first question in response to an argument must
never be "Does he or she belong to the right group?" Instead the
only criterion must be "Is the argument valid?" An argument must
never be dismissed or accepted ignored or respected because the
speaker is male or female, black or white, American or foreign.
As concerns affirmative action policies - which raise issues
that are among the most difficult that a society can confront - I
think it is of the greatest importance that all those who participate
in the debate refrain from demonizing their opponents.
Maintaining and furthering Stanford University is an incred
ibly delicate task. It is a joint intellectual and moral effort of
faculty, students, trustees, alumni, and local, national, and world
wide friends. I cannot be sure about the answers to my own ques
tions. All of us, on all sides of the issue, are and w ill be open to
criticism. The request I have to make of those who would be critical
is that they also make the effort to understand.
Statement by Gerhard Casper, President
on Affirmative Action at Stanford University
October 4, 1995

With increasing frequency, students, faculty, trustees, alumni
and others have asked where Stanford should be on affirmative
action. I determined several months ago to express my own views
on the subject to the Stanford community at the first Faculty Senate
meeting of the fall. Affirmative action involves some of the most
difficult and complex issues in our society Reasonable people
differ on what it means, has meant or ought to mean. In the hope
that it will facilitate further examination and discussion, I offer my
full statement here to the senators, and all of Stanford, in advance
of the Oct. 12 Senate meeting.
â– 
Government-mandated affirmative action began with
President Lyndon Johnsons Executive Order 1 1246 of 1965.
Affirmative action requirements applicable to the employment
decisions of federal contractors, including universities, were
substantially reinforced and extended under President Nixon.
Most regulations originate with the executive branch rather than
Congress, and require outreach, plans, goals, and timetables State
regulations also come into play. Some affirmative action for
instance, in college admissions is voluntary in the sense of not
being mandated by government.
Affirmative action docs not require, and does not mean,
quotas or preferment of unqualified over qualified individuals.
Indeed, such preferment may violate anti-discrimination laws.
Affirmative action is based on the judgment that a policy of true
equal opportunity needs to create opportunities for members of
historically underrepresented groups to be drawn into various walks
of life from which they might otherwise be shut out. Barriers
continue to exist in society, and therefore affirmative action asks
us to cast our net more widely to broaden the competition and to
engage in more active efforts for locating and recruiting applicants.
Of course, the very act of broadening the competition means
that more candidates will seek, and be considered for, the same
finite number of admissions places or employment openings and
the competition for them will therefore be more intense. It would
be hypocritical to suggest that affirmative action, even without
quotas, does not diminish the opportunities for some who, in the
past, might have benefited from a narrower casting of nets or
narrower definitions of merit.
The terms "merit" and "qualified" occasionally are used as if
they were self-defining. Merit, however, ordinarily depends on
many qualities of an individual and on judgments about how their
combination might further the tasks of a university, government
agency, or any other organization. Still. I repeat: Affirmative action
does not justify admitting, hiring, or promoting those who are not
well-qualified for the work ahead of them.
For about 30 years, debate about affirmative action has been
constant, though only occasionally very heated. In 1995. the
discussion has become more intense and much louder. It is not
sufficient to explain this phenomenon in terms of electoral politics.
The politicians are responding to views and opinions whose forceful
expression has triggered, and been triggered by, plans for a referen
dum in California. The "California Civil Rights Initiative," as
presently worded would prohibit using "race, sex, color, ethnicity
or national origin as a criterion tor either discriminating against or
granting preferential treatment" to anyone in public schools,
employment, or contracting. The initiative is not at least not
directly aimed at private institutions such as Stanford University.
It is often unclear why a given public controversy erupts at a
particular moment. I am not an expert on social movements, and
my hunches may or may not have some basis in fact. To me it
seems that a confluence of various trends has led to the present
crescendo concerning affirmative action.
(1) The traditions of our country emphasize the individual
person and individual autonomy rather than group membership.
The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution was
primarily aimed at the unequal treatment of individuals on account
of race. Affirmative action makes group membership a salient
characteristic of an individual. This defining element has left many
Americans uneasy, including some supporters of affirmative action.
(2) Because affirmative action has conferred legal status on
group membership, many are worried about a balkanization of our
society. They are especially concerned about the possibility that
some separatist forms of multiculturalism are incompatible with the
desire of maintaining a more open and more stable country. While
American law mostly forgoes quotas, there is a suspicion that plans,
goals, and timetables represent a "quota mentality."
(3) Claims for the benefits of affirmative action have been
proliferating. They have thus undercut the original rationale for
affirmative action that flowed not exclusively, but primarily, from
the historical grievances of African Americans. Groups that have
been the victims of a multiplicity of social, cultural, religious, and
economic traditions and institutions advance claims that raise
complex questions about the responsibilities and competencies of
government.
(4) Our country, for the last 30 years, has been going through
vast demographic, economic, and social transformations that seem
to bring into question many, if not all, values that once dominated.
Also, economic uncertainties a few decades ago did not seem to
have the comprehensive reach that, for instance, characterizes
present-day "downsizing." As only too many Americans know,
downsizing may leave the unskilled, skilled and highly skilled of
all age groups alike suddenly without jobs. In this setting, educa
tion becomes even more crucial than it has always been. Thus,
getting into a good school that has only a limited number of places
is an urgent desire of many students and their families. They worry
about whether they will receive fair consideration in competitions in
which, at Stanford for example, less than 20 percent of the already
self-selected applicants to the freshmen class are offered admission.
I should like to address further the specific subject of college
admissions at Stanford. To the extent to which I deal with questions
concerning underlying principles, much of what I should like to
say also applies to, or at least has implications for, employment at
Stanford. 1 am making these comments against the background of
the national debate about affirmative action. However, I am re
stricting myself to what Stanford is doing and what, in my view, it
should be doing. I have emphasized in the past, and I repeat now,
that Stanford University is a private institution that has, and should
have, considerable freedom in the pursuit of its educational goals
and ideals.

Let me begin by speaking about what Stanford has stood for
since its founding. When I.eland Stanford and his wife, Jane, lost
their 15-year-old only child, Leland Jr., in 18X4. they decided to use
their wealth to do something for "other people V sons and daugh
ters. This sentiment led to the founding of our university.
In a 1 1 >()2 address, which formally amended the Founding
Grant, Jane Stanford stressed that the moving spirit of the founders
was "love of humanity and a desire to render the greatest possible
service to mankind." I quote: "The University was accordingly
designed for the betterment of mankind morally, spiritually, intellec
tually. physically, and materially. The public at large, and not alone
the comparatively feu students who can attend the University, are
the chief and ultimate beneficiaries of the foundation." The
university's "chief object" was to be "the instruction of students
with a view to producing leaders and educators in every field of
science and industry."
The university's initial policy of not charging tuition was
adopted I again quote Jane Stanford, to "resist the tendency to the
stratification of society, bv keeping open an avenue whereby the
deserving and exceptional may rise through their own efforts from
the lowest to the highest station in life. A spirit of equality must
accordingly be maintained within the University." I point out that
Stanford admitted women when many of its peers would not even
have considered the possibility.
The means that Jane and Leland Stanford chose to implement
their lofty goal "to promote the public welfare" was to found,
endow, and have maintained "a University of high degree." The
quality of the university was the sine qua non for the pursuit of the
more general ends. Nowadays, we would go beyond seeking a
university merely of high degree and instead refer to achieving and
keeping a university of the highest degree.
This ev ocation of our institutional purposes is helpful in
reminding us that it would be exceedingly narrow -minded to assume
that the pursuit of the univ ersity as envisioned in the founding
documents calls for a one-dimensional approach in choosing those
to whom we give the opportunity to study at Stanford. As we look
for the leaders of tomorrow, if all we considered were capacities
measurable on a scale, without taking into consideration other
aspects of being "deserving and exceptional," we would be betray
ing the Founders. We would be betraying the Founders if we
disregarded their stated concern about "the tendency to the stratifi
cation of society."
In the early years of Stanford, to gain admission as an under
graduate, you could choose between taking the university's entrance
examination or presenting certificates from your school that showed
that your grades were a set percentage higher than the lowest
passing grade at the school. In short, you had to demonstrate the
ability to do the work of the university.
Under David Starr Jordan's "radical plan" the only specifi
cally prescribed subject was English, and Stanford, ahead of its
time, considerably liberalized the other admission prerequisites.
This allowed a wider group of students to qualify for admission to
Stanford than under more orthodox systems in which universities
overdetermined the required preparatory subjects and thus limited
the pool of students to the graduates of certain secondary schools.
Most students entered Stanford by certification rather than examina
tion and. in 191 1. the university abolished its own examinations,
relying on the College Entrance Examination Board instead.
Under the influence of Lewis Terman. in 1920 Stanford
additionally began to require an aptitude test. The Stanford test
eventually was supplanted by the SAT. The Committee on Admis
sions used a ten-point system in which school record and aptitude
test received three points each, while four points were reserved for
the Committee's judgment regarding "the student's personal quali
ties, general promise and so on." Since 1950, the university has
been looking for ev idence of a strong academic record in high
school, the results of standardized tests, and three recommendation
letters to confirm qualities of intellectual v itality, character, citizen
ship. and initiative.
These generally applicable considerations were supplemented
by the Faculty Senate in 1986 with a more detailed set of "Criteria
for Undergraduate Admissions." According to the principles laid
down in 19X6, "The primary criterion for admission is academic
excellence" as demonstrated by scholastic performance, scores on
standardized national tests, documented perseverance and attain
ment in activities outside the classroom, the personal statement, and
high school recommendations.
There are no restrictive quotas of any kind and admissions are
decided without regard to an applicant's economic resources.
Stanford seeks undergraduates of varied ethnic, social, cultural,
and economic backgrounds whose talents, achievements, and
characters suit them for leadership. In the case of every person
admitted, there has been a judgment that the applicant is "deserving
and exceptional."
A few categories of applicants certain ethnic minorities,
legacies and athletes receive special consideration provided they
meet these requirements. Children of Stanford alumni receive
preference among applicants of approximately equal qualifications,
as do children of eligible faculty and staff. Furthermore. Stanford is
committed to a substantial presence of African Americans, Mexican
Americans, and Native Americans in the undergraduate student
body. Finally, the Department of Athletics may designate outstand
ing athletes for special attention. The Dean of Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid has final authority over all admissions.
All applicants receive careful consideration and the admis
sions rev iew takes individual circumstances of the applicant into
consideration. These efforts aim at a class characterized by diver
sity in terms of academic interests, artistic and athletic accomplish
ments. leadership qualities, and ethnic and social backgrounds.
Why should we look for such diversity? The main goals are two.
First, we want a rich educational environment to challenge our
students. Students learn much from one another. Second, we want
to be faithful to our task to educate leaders for a diverse and com
plex society a society that will, we hope, overcome the undue
tendencies toward stratification. This cannot be done unless the
country's demographic diversity finds a presence on campus.
We do not admit minorities to do them a favor. We want
students from a variety of backgrounds to help fulfill our educa
tional responsibilities, not. to my mind, to address the effects of
historic discrimination, although that might be a result. University
admissions offices are not set up to sit in judgment on what injus-

tices society should compensate for and who should pay the price.
Furthermore, who possesses the wisdom and insight for the task .'
Admissions decisions, on the basis of an applicant's demonstrated
achievements, should he forward-looking. We must not admit some
and thereby exclude others because we arrogate to ourselves the
power to sort out who owes what to whom.
How an individual applicant has dealt with disadvantage
obviously is relevant to assessments of capability and resilience.
However. I am extremely wary of any admissions process in which
economic and social disadvantage (including dysfunctional home
environments) become categorical criteria to be formally weighed
in decisions about whom to admit as a student. In order to survive
as a sane society, we should not create incentives for ever more
people to think in terms of victimhood or to play the role of victims,
or to suggest that one must be disadvantaged to be given serious
consideration in the college admission process.
Should race and ethnic background be a factor in our decision
making'.' If the invisible hand could be rel ed upon to produce
admissions pools or employment pools that reflect the ideal of equal
opportunity at all levels of society, including in the leadership
positions for which Stanford prepares, special outreach would not
be necessary. If the members of society mostly ignored race and
ethnicity, we could forgo taking them into consideration. We hope
that one day we will be able to do so.
Alas, I think it would be naive to assume that racial and
gender stereotypes do not work against many who would otherwise
be capable of taking advantage of opportunities at all stages of life.
In Fires in the Mirror, the dramatization of the Crown Heights riots
of I 1 ) 1 ) Iby our Stanford colleague Anna Deavere Smith, George
Wolfe talks about venturing outside the African American neighbor
hood in which he had grown up. I quote:
And then I would go beyond a certain point
I was treated like I was insignificant.
Nobody was
hosing me down or calling me nigger.
It was just that I was insignificant.
I strongly believe it remains necessary to level the field, to
recognize that there are vast differences between primary and
secondary schools and how they develop ability, and to make
conscious efforts to increase the presence of underrepresented
minorities at all levels of society. This may even work to the
advantage of a minority applicant who himself does not come from
a disadvantaged economic or cultural background. It is the respon
sibility of educational institutions such as Stanford to find and
educate those who can become the leaders of the future in a
multiethnic and multiracial society. Alas, our society is quite color
conscious. and we therefore cannot yet afford to be colorblind.
I am, of course, fully aware of the fact that my view of the
matter leads me to take into consideration criteria that are very
problematic. There is, first of all, the utter arbitrariness of racial
and ethnic labeling. Boxes to be checked may look neat on paper
but there is little underlying or inherent sense. What is race? What
is a race? What is ethnicity? How do we deal with racial or ethnic
mixing? Why is the child of a black parent and a white parent
classified as black? Why does one-fourth American Indian ancestry
qualify a person as Indian, while slightly less does not? Are the
classifieatory laws of apartheid South Africa what we end up
emulating? Is our way out, self-classification, something to be
fairly relied on? When government and courts dictate race relations,
we quickly get caught in contradictions and absurdities.
These reservations, however, do not diminish my belief that
institutions such as Stanford, if indeed they want to be universities
of the highest degree, need the discretion to do as best they can in
their efforts to find and educate the leaders of tomorrow. As we
pursue our goals, there is no room for categorical preferences, there
is no room for quotas, there is no room for preferring the unquali
fied over the qualified. However, there is also no room with respect
to any applicant for making quantitative, scaleable admissions
criteria the sole touchstones of intellectual vitality, talent, character,
and promise. That has never been the case at Stanford, and I hope it
never will be. It is Stanford's very characteristic that it has never
been one-dimensional and yet it has been able, especially over the
last four decades, to become one of the world's most selective

ing athletes for special attention. The Dean of Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid has final authority over all admissions.
All applicants receive careful consideration and the admis
sions rev iew takes individual circumstances of the applicant into
consideration. These efforts aim at a class characterized by diver
sity in terms of academic interests, artistic and athletic accomplish
ments. leadership qualities, and ethnic and social backgrounds.
Why should we look for such diversity? The main goals are two.
First, we want a rich educational environment to challenge our
students. Students learn much from one another. Second, we want
to be faithful to our task to educate leaders for a diverse and com
plex society a society that will, we hope, overcome the undue
tendencies toward stratification. This cannot be done unless the
country's demographic diversity finds a presence on campus.
We do not admit minorities to do them a favor. We want
students from a variety of backgrounds to help fulfill our educa
tional responsibilities, not. to my mind, to address the effects of
historic discrimination, although that might be a result. University
admissions offices are not set up to sit in judgment on what injus-

tices society should compensate for and who should pay the price.
Furthermore, who possesses the wisdom and insight for the task .'
Admissions decisions, on the basis of an applicant's demonstrated
achievements, should he forward-looking. We must not admit some
and thereby exclude others because we arrogate to ourselves the
power to sort out who owes what to whom.
How an individual applicant has dealt with disadvantage
obviously is relevant to assessments of capability and resilience.
However. I am extremely wary of any admissions process in which
economic and social disadvantage (including dysfunctional home
environments) become categorical criteria to be formally weighed
in decisions about whom to admit as a student. In order to survive
as a sane society, we should not create incentives for ever more
people to think in terms of victimhood or to play the role of victims,
or to suggest that one must be disadvantaged to be given serious
consideration in the college admission process.
Should race and ethnic background be a factor in our decision
making'.' If the invisible hand could be rel ed upon to produce
admissions pools or employment pools that reflect the ideal of equal
opportunity at all levels of society, including in the leadership
positions for which Stanford prepares, special outreach would not
be necessary. If the members of society mostly ignored race and
ethnicity, we could forgo taking them into consideration. We hope
that one day we will be able to do so.
Alas, I think it would be naive to assume that racial and
gender stereotypes do not work against many who would otherwise
be capable of taking advantage of opportunities at all stages of life.
In Fires in the Mirror, the dramatization of the Crown Heights riots
of I 1 ) 1 ) Iby our Stanford colleague Anna Deavere Smith, George
Wolfe talks about venturing outside the African American neighbor
hood in which he had grown up. I quote:
And then I would go beyond a certain point
I was treated like I was insignificant.
Nobody was
hosing me down or calling me nigger.
It was just that I was insignificant.
I strongly believe it remains necessary to level the field, to
recognize that there are vast differences between primary and
secondary schools and how they develop ability, and to make
conscious efforts to increase the presence of underrepresented
minorities at all levels of society. This may even work to the
advantage of a minority applicant who himself does not come from
a disadvantaged economic or cultural background. It is the respon
sibility of educational institutions such as Stanford to find and
educate those who can become the leaders of the future in a
multiethnic and multiracial society. Alas, our society is quite color
conscious. and we therefore cannot yet afford to be colorblind.
I am, of course, fully aware of the fact that my view of the
matter leads me to take into consideration criteria that are very
problematic. There is, first of all, the utter arbitrariness of racial
and ethnic labeling. Boxes to be checked may look neat on paper
but there is little underlying or inherent sense. What is race? What
is a race? What is ethnicity? How do we deal with racial or ethnic
mixing? Why is the child of a black parent and a white parent
classified as black? Why does one-fourth American Indian ancestry
qualify a person as Indian, while slightly less does not? Are the
classifieatory laws of apartheid South Africa what we end up
emulating? Is our way out, self-classification, something to be
fairly relied on? When government and courts dictate race relations,
we quickly get caught in contradictions and absurdities.
These reservations, however, do not diminish my belief that
institutions such as Stanford, if indeed they want to be universities
of the highest degree, need the discretion to do as best they can in
their efforts to find and educate the leaders of tomorrow. As we
pursue our goals, there is no room for categorical preferences, there
is no room for quotas, there is no room for preferring the unquali
fied over the qualified. However, there is also no room with respect
to any applicant for making quantitative, scaleable admissions
criteria the sole touchstones of intellectual vitality, talent, character,
and promise. That has never been the case at Stanford, and I hope it
never will be. It is Stanford's very characteristic that it has never
been one-dimensional and yet it has been able, especially over the
last four decades, to become one of the world's most selective
institutions. Our capacity to pursue many excellences will remain
undiminished as long as we continue to get the balance right and do
not waver in our commitment to quality.
I said at the outset that many who worry about the consider
ation of race and ethnic background in admissions and employment
decisions worry about enhancing the balkanization of American
society. They worry, not without justification, about institutions
falling victim to highly politicized ethnically or racially oriented
groups that pursue their own narrow agendas without care for, or in
direct opposition to. the overall welfare of the institution or society.
Indeed we must at all times guard against enhancing and freezing,
rather than ameliorating, cleavages. We must call attention to the
citizenship held in common.
The university is an institution dedicated to the search to know
the search to know of each member in her or his individual
capacity. A university needs to be integrated in order to pursue its
tasks. Even with affirmative action, students are evaluated and
admitted to Stanford as individuals, not in groups. No university
can thrive unless each member is accepted without regards to labels
and stereotypes. This is the case with students, faculty, and staff.
In a university, the first question in response to an argument must
never be "Does he or she belong to the right group?" Instead the
only criterion must be "Is the argument valid?" An argument must
never be dismissed or accepted ignored or respected because the
speaker is male or female, black or white, American or foreign.
As concerns affirmative action policies - which raise issues
that are among the most difficult that a society can confront - I
think it is of the greatest importance that all those who participate
in the debate refrain from demonizing their opponents.
Maintaining and furthering Stanford University is an incred
ibly delicate task. It is a joint intellectual and moral effort of
faculty, students, trustees, alumni, and local, national, and world
wide friends. I cannot be sure about the answers to my own ques
tions. All of us, on all sides of the issue, are and w ill be open to
criticism. The request I have to make of those who would be critical
is that they also make the effort to understand.
Statement by Gerhard Casper, President
on Affirmative Action at Stanford University
October 4, 1995

With increasing frequency, students, faculty, trustees, alumni
and others have asked where Stanford should be on affirmative
action. I determined several months ago to express my own views
on the subject to the Stanford community at the first Faculty Senate
meeting of the fall. Affirmative action involves some of the most
difficult and complex issues in our society Reasonable people
differ on what it means, has meant or ought to mean. In the hope
that it will facilitate further examination and discussion, I offer my
full statement here to the senators, and all of Stanford, in advance
of the Oct. 12 Senate meeting.
â– 
Government-mandated affirmative action began with
President Lyndon Johnsons Executive Order 1 1246 of 1965.
Affirmative action requirements applicable to the employment
decisions of federal contractors, including universities, were
substantially reinforced and extended under President Nixon.
Most regulations originate with the executive branch rather than
Congress, and require outreach, plans, goals, and timetables State
regulations also come into play. Some affirmative action for
instance, in college admissions is voluntary in the sense of not
being mandated by government.
Affirmative action docs not require, and does not mean,
quotas or preferment of unqualified over qualified individuals.
Indeed, such preferment may violate anti-discrimination laws.
Affirmative action is based on the judgment that a policy of true
equal opportunity needs to create opportunities for members of
historically underrepresented groups to be drawn into various walks
of life from which they might otherwise be shut out. Barriers
continue to exist in society, and therefore affirmative action asks
us to cast our net more widely to broaden the competition and to
engage in more active efforts for locating and recruiting applicants.
Of course, the very act of broadening the competition means
that more candidates will seek, and be considered for, the same
finite number of admissions places or employment openings and
the competition for them will therefore be more intense. It would
be hypocritical to suggest that affirmative action, even without
quotas, does not diminish the opportunities for some who, in the
past, might have benefited from a narrower casting of nets or
narrower definitions of merit.
The terms "merit" and "qualified" occasionally are used as if
they were self-defining. Merit, however, ordinarily depends on
many qualities of an individual and on judgments about how their
combination might further the tasks of a university, government
agency, or any other organization. Still. I repeat: Affirmative action
does not justify admitting, hiring, or promoting those who are not
well-qualified for the work ahead of them.
For about 30 years, debate about affirmative action has been
constant, though only occasionally very heated. In 1995. the
discussion has become more intense and much louder. It is not
sufficient to explain this phenomenon in terms of electoral politics.
The politicians are responding to views and opinions whose forceful
expression has triggered, and been triggered by, plans for a referen
dum in California. The "California Civil Rights Initiative," as
presently worded would prohibit using "race, sex, color, ethnicity
or national origin as a criterion tor either discriminating against or
granting preferential treatment" to anyone in public schools,
employment, or contracting. The initiative is not at least not
directly aimed at private institutions such as Stanford University.
It is often unclear why a given public controversy erupts at a
particular moment. I am not an expert on social movements, and
my hunches may or may not have some basis in fact. To me it
seems that a confluence of various trends has led to the present
crescendo concerning affirmative action.
(1) The traditions of our country emphasize the individual
person and individual autonomy rather than group membership.
The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution was
primarily aimed at the unequal treatment of individuals on account
of race. Affirmative action makes group membership a salient
characteristic of an individual. This defining element has left many
Americans uneasy, including some supporters of affirmative action.
(2) Because affirmative action has conferred legal status on
group membership, many are worried about a balkanization of our
society. They are especially concerned about the possibility that
some separatist forms of multiculturalism are incompatible with the
desire of maintaining a more open and more stable country. While
American law mostly forgoes quotas, there is a suspicion that plans,
goals, and timetables represent a "quota mentality."
(3) Claims for the benefits of affirmative action have been
proliferating. They have thus undercut the original rationale for
affirmative action that flowed not exclusively, but primarily, from
the historical grievances of African Americans. Groups that have
been the victims of a multiplicity of social, cultural, religious, and
economic traditions and institutions advance claims that raise
complex questions about the responsibilities and competencies of
government.
(4) Our country, for the last 30 years, has been going through
vast demographic, economic, and social transformations that seem
to bring into question many, if not all, values that once dominated.
Also, economic uncertainties a few decades ago did not seem to
have the comprehensive reach that, for instance, characterizes
present-day "downsizing." As only too many Americans know,
downsizing may leave the unskilled, skilled and highly skilled of
all age groups alike suddenly without jobs. In this setting, educa
tion becomes even more crucial than it has always been. Thus,
getting into a good school that has only a limited number of places
is an urgent desire of many students and their families. They worry
about whether they will receive fair consideration in competitions in
which, at Stanford for example, less than 20 percent of the already
self-selected applicants to the freshmen class are offered admission.
I should like to address further the specific subject of college
admissions at Stanford. To the extent to which I deal with questions
concerning underlying principles, much of what I should like to
say also applies to, or at least has implications for, employment at
Stanford. 1 am making these comments against the background of
the national debate about affirmative action. However, I am re
stricting myself to what Stanford is doing and what, in my view, it
should be doing. I have emphasized in the past, and I repeat now,
that Stanford University is a private institution that has, and should
have, considerable freedom in the pursuit of its educational goals
and ideals.

Let me begin by speaking about what Stanford has stood for
since its founding. When I.eland Stanford and his wife, Jane, lost
their 15-year-old only child, Leland Jr., in 18X4. they decided to use
their wealth to do something for "other people V sons and daugh
ters. This sentiment led to the founding of our university.
In a 1 1 >()2 address, which formally amended the Founding
Grant, Jane Stanford stressed that the moving spirit of the founders
was "love of humanity and a desire to render the greatest possible
service to mankind." I quote: "The University was accordingly
designed for the betterment of mankind morally, spiritually, intellec
tually. physically, and materially. The public at large, and not alone
the comparatively feu students who can attend the University, are
the chief and ultimate beneficiaries of the foundation." The
university's "chief object" was to be "the instruction of students
with a view to producing leaders and educators in every field of
science and industry."
The university's initial policy of not charging tuition was
adopted I again quote Jane Stanford, to "resist the tendency to the
stratification of society, bv keeping open an avenue whereby the
deserving and exceptional may rise through their own efforts from
the lowest to the highest station in life. A spirit of equality must
accordingly be maintained within the University." I point out that
Stanford admitted women when many of its peers would not even
have considered the possibility.
The means that Jane and Leland Stanford chose to implement
their lofty goal "to promote the public welfare" was to found,
endow, and have maintained "a University of high degree." The
quality of the university was the sine qua non for the pursuit of the
more general ends. Nowadays, we would go beyond seeking a
university merely of high degree and instead refer to achieving and
keeping a university of the highest degree.
This ev ocation of our institutional purposes is helpful in
reminding us that it would be exceedingly narrow -minded to assume
that the pursuit of the univ ersity as envisioned in the founding
documents calls for a one-dimensional approach in choosing those
to whom we give the opportunity to study at Stanford. As we look
for the leaders of tomorrow, if all we considered were capacities
measurable on a scale, without taking into consideration other
aspects of being "deserving and exceptional," we would be betray
ing the Founders. We would be betraying the Founders if we
disregarded their stated concern about "the tendency to the stratifi
cation of society."
In the early years of Stanford, to gain admission as an under
graduate, you could choose between taking the university's entrance
examination or presenting certificates from your school that showed
that your grades were a set percentage higher than the lowest
passing grade at the school. In short, you had to demonstrate the
ability to do the work of the university.
Under David Starr Jordan's "radical plan" the only specifi
cally prescribed subject was English, and Stanford, ahead of its
time, considerably liberalized the other admission prerequisites.
This allowed a wider group of students to qualify for admission to
Stanford than under more orthodox systems in which universities
overdetermined the required preparatory subjects and thus limited
the pool of students to the graduates of certain secondary schools.
Most students entered Stanford by certification rather than examina
tion and. in 191 1. the university abolished its own examinations,
relying on the College Entrance Examination Board instead.
Under the influence of Lewis Terman. in 1920 Stanford
additionally began to require an aptitude test. The Stanford test
eventually was supplanted by the SAT. The Committee on Admis
sions used a ten-point system in which school record and aptitude
test received three points each, while four points were reserved for
the Committee's judgment regarding "the student's personal quali
ties, general promise and so on." Since 1950, the university has
been looking for ev idence of a strong academic record in high
school, the results of standardized tests, and three recommendation
letters to confirm qualities of intellectual v itality, character, citizen
ship. and initiative.
These generally applicable considerations were supplemented
by the Faculty Senate in 1986 with a more detailed set of "Criteria
for Undergraduate Admissions." According to the principles laid
down in 19X6, "The primary criterion for admission is academic
excellence" as demonstrated by scholastic performance, scores on
standardized national tests, documented perseverance and attain
ment in activities outside the classroom, the personal statement, and
high school recommendations.
There are no restrictive quotas of any kind and admissions are
decided without regard to an applicant's economic resources.
Stanford seeks undergraduates of varied ethnic, social, cultural,
and economic backgrounds whose talents, achievements, and
characters suit them for leadership. In the case of every person
admitted, there has been a judgment that the applicant is "deserving
and exceptional."
A few categories of applicants certain ethnic minorities,
legacies and athletes receive special consideration provided they
meet these requirements. Children of Stanford alumni receive
preference among applicants of approximately equal qualifications,
as do children of eligible faculty and staff. Furthermore. Stanford is
committed to a substantial presence of African Americans, Mexican
Americans, and Native Americans in the undergraduate student
body. Finally, the Department of Athletics may designate outstand
ing athletes for special attention. The Dean of Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid has final authority over all admissions.
All applicants receive careful consideration and the admis
sions rev iew takes individual circumstances of the applicant into
consideration. These efforts aim at a class characterized by diver
sity in terms of academic interests, artistic and athletic accomplish
ments. leadership qualities, and ethnic and social backgrounds.
Why should we look for such diversity? The main goals are two.
First, we want a rich educational environment to challenge our
students. Students learn much from one another. Second, we want
to be faithful to our task to educate leaders for a diverse and com
plex society a society that will, we hope, overcome the undue

The means that Jane and Leland Stanford chose to implement
their lofty goal "to promote the public welfare" was to found,
endow, and have maintained "a University of high degree." The
quality of the university was the sine qua non for the pursuit of the
more general ends. Nowadays, we would go beyond seeking a
university merely of high degree and instead refer to achieving and
keeping a university of the highest degree.
This ev ocation of our institutional purposes is helpful in
reminding us that it would be exceedingly narrow -minded to assume
that the pursuit of the univ ersity as envisioned in the founding
documents calls for a one-dimensional approach in choosing those
to whom we give the opportunity to study at Stanford. As we look
for the leaders of tomorrow, if all we considered were capacities
measurable on a scale, without taking into consideration other
aspects of being "deserving and exceptional," we would be betray
ing the Founders. We would be betraying the Founders if we
disregarded their stated concern about "the tendency to the stratifi
cation of society."
In the early years of Stanford, to gain admission as an under
graduate, you could choose between taking the university's entrance
examination or presenting certificates from your school that showed
that your grades were a set percentage higher than the lowest
passing grade at the school. In short, you had to demonstrate the
ability to do the work of the university.
Under David Starr Jordan's "radical plan" the only specifi
cally prescribed subject was English, and Stanford, ahead of its
time, considerably liberalized the other admission prerequisites.
This allowed a wider group of students to qualify for admission to
Stanford than under more orthodox systems in which universities
overdetermined the required preparatory subjects and thus limited
the pool of students to the graduates of certain secondary schools.
Most students entered Stanford by certification rather than examina
tion and. in 191 1. the university abolished its own examinations,
relying on the College Entrance Examination Board instead.
Under the influence of Lewis Terman. in 1920 Stanford
additionally began to require an aptitude test. The Stanford test
eventually was supplanted by the SAT. The Committee on Admis
sions used a ten-point system in which school record and aptitude
test received three points each, while four points were reserved for
the Committee's judgment regarding "the student's personal quali
ties, general promise and so on." Since 1950, the university has
been looking for ev idence of a strong academic record in high
school, the results of standardized tests, and three recommendation
letters to confirm qualities of intellectual v itality, character, citizen
ship. and initiative.
These generally applicable considerations were supplemented
by the Faculty Senate in 1986 with a more detailed set of "Criteria
for Undergraduate Admissions." According to the principles laid
down in 19X6, "The primary criterion for admission is academic
excellence" as demonstrated by scholastic performance, scores on
standardized national tests, documented perseverance and attain
ment in activities outside the classroom, the personal statement, and
high school recommendations.
There are no restrictive quotas of any kind and admissions are
decided without regard to an applicant's economic resources.
Stanford seeks undergraduates of varied ethnic, social, cultural,
and economic backgrounds whose talents, achievements, and
characters suit them for leadership. In the case of every person
admitted, there has been a judgment that the applicant is "deserving
and exceptional."
A few categories of applicants certain ethnic minorities,
legacies and athletes receive special consideration provided they
meet these requirements. Children of Stanford alumni receive
preference among applicants of approximately equal qualifications,
as do children of eligible faculty and staff. Furthermore. Stanford is
committed to a substantial presence of African Americans, Mexican
Americans, and Native Americans in the undergraduate student
body. Finally, the Department of Athletics may designate outstand
ing athletes for special attention. The Dean of Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid has final authority over all admissions.
All applicants receive careful consideration and the admis
sions rev iew takes individual circumstances of the applicant into
consideration. These efforts aim at a class characterized by diver
sity in terms of academic interests, artistic and athletic accomplish
ments. leadership qualities, and ethnic and social backgrounds.
Why should we look for such diversity? The main goals are two.
First, we want a rich educational environment to challenge our
students. Students learn much from one another. Second, we want
to be faithful to our task to educate leaders for a diverse and com
plex society a society that will, we hope, overcome the undue
tendencies toward stratification. This cannot be done unless the
country's demographic diversity finds a presence on campus.
We do not admit minorities to do them a favor. We want
students from a variety of backgrounds to help fulfill our educa
tional responsibilities, not. to my mind, to address the effects of
historic discrimination, although that might be a result. University
admissions offices are not set up to sit in judgment on what injus-

tices society should compensate for and who should pay the price.
Furthermore, who possesses the wisdom and insight for the task .'
Admissions decisions, on the basis of an applicant's demonstrated
achievements, should he forward-looking. We must not admit some
and thereby exclude others because we arrogate to ourselves the
power to sort out who owes what to whom.
How an individual applicant has dealt with disadvantage
obviously is relevant to assessments of capability and resilience.
However. I am extremely wary of any admissions process in which
economic and social disadvantage (including dysfunctional home
environments) become categorical criteria to be formally weighed
in decisions about whom to admit as a student. In order to survive
as a sane society, we should not create incentives for ever more
people to think in terms of victimhood or to play the role of victims,
or to suggest that one must be disadvantaged to be given serious
consideration in the college admission process.
Should race and ethnic background be a factor in our decision
making'.' If the invisible hand could be rel ed upon to produce
admissions pools or employment pools that reflect the ideal of equal
opportunity at all levels of society, including in the leadership
positions for which Stanford prepares, special outreach would not
be necessary. If the members of society mostly ignored race and
ethnicity, we could forgo taking them into consideration. We hope
that one day we will be able to do so.
Alas, I think it would be naive to assume that racial and
gender stereotypes do not work against many who would otherwise
be capable of taking advantage of opportunities at all stages of life.
In Fires in the Mirror, the dramatization of the Crown Heights riots
of I 1 ) 1 ) Iby our Stanford colleague Anna Deavere Smith, George
Wolfe talks about venturing outside the African American neighbor
hood in which he had grown up. I quote:
And then I would go beyond a certain point
I was treated like I was insignificant.
Nobody was
hosing me down or calling me nigger.
It was just that I was insignificant.
I strongly believe it remains necessary to level the field, to
recognize that there are vast differences between primary and
secondary schools and how they develop ability, and to make
conscious efforts to increase the presence of underrepresented
minorities at all levels of society. This may even work to the
advantage of a minority applicant who himself does not come from
a disadvantaged economic or cultural background. It is the respon
sibility of educational institutions such as Stanford to find and
educate those who can become the leaders of the future in a
multiethnic and multiracial society. Alas, our society is quite color
conscious. and we therefore cannot yet afford to be colorblind.
I am, of course, fully aware of the fact that my view of the
matter leads me to take into consideration criteria that are very
problematic. There is, first of all, the utter arbitrariness of racial
and ethnic labeling. Boxes to be checked may look neat on paper
but there is little underlying or inherent sense. What is race? What
is a race? What is ethnicity? How do we deal with racial or ethnic
mixing? Why is the child of a black parent and a white parent
classified as black? Why does one-fourth American Indian ancestry
qualify a person as Indian, while slightly less does not? Are the
classifieatory laws of apartheid South Africa what we end up
emulating? Is our way out, self-classification, something to be
fairly relied on? When government and courts dictate race relations,
we quickly get caught in contradictions and absurdities.
These reservations, however, do not diminish my belief that
institutions such as Stanford, if indeed they want to be universities
of the highest degree, need the discretion to do as best they can in
their efforts to find and educate the leaders of tomorrow. As we
pursue our goals, there is no room for categorical preferences, there
is no room for quotas, there is no room for preferring the unquali
fied over the qualified. However, there is also no room with respect
to any applicant for making quantitative, scaleable admissions
criteria the sole touchstones of intellectual vitality, talent, character,
and promise. That has never been the case at Stanford, and I hope it
never will be. It is Stanford's very characteristic that it has never
been one-dimensional and yet it has been able, especially over the
last four decades, to become one of the world's most selective
institutions. Our capacity to pursue many excellences will remain
undiminished as long as we continue to get the balance right and do
not waver in our commitment to quality.
I said at the outset that many who worry about the consider
ation of race and ethnic background in admissions and employment
decisions worry about enhancing the balkanization of American
society. They worry, not without justification, about institutions
falling victim to highly politicized ethnically or racially oriented
groups that pursue their own narrow agendas without care for, or in
direct opposition to. the overall welfare of the institution or society.
Indeed we must at all times guard against enhancing and freezing,
rather than ameliorating, cleavages. We must call attention to the
citizenship held in common.
The university is an institution dedicated to the search to know
the search to know of each member in her or his individual
capacity. A university needs to be integrated in order to pursue its
tasks. Even with affirmative action, students are evaluated and
admitted to Stanford as individuals, not in groups. No university
can thrive unless each member is accepted without regards to labels
and stereotypes. This is the case with students, faculty, and staff.
In a university, the first question in response to an argument must
never be "Does he or she belong to the right group?" Instead the
only criterion must be "Is the argument valid?" An argument must
never be dismissed or accepted ignored or respected because the
speaker is male or female, black or white, American or foreign.
As concerns affirmative action policies - which raise issues
that are among the most difficult that a society can confront - I
think it is of the greatest importance that all those who participate
in the debate refrain from demonizing their opponents.
Maintaining and furthering Stanford University is an incred
ibly delicate task. It is a joint intellectual and moral effort of
faculty, students, trustees, alumni, and local, national, and world
wide friends. I cannot be sure about the answers to my own ques
tions. All of us, on all sides of the issue, are and w ill be open to
criticism. The request I have to make of those who would be critical
is that they also make the effort to understand.
Statement by Gerhard Casper, President
on Affirmative Action at Stanford University
October 4, 1995

With increasing frequency, students, faculty, trustees, alumni
and others have asked where Stanford should be on affirmative
action. I determined several months ago to express my own views
on the subject to the Stanford community at the first Faculty Senate
meeting of the fall. Affirmative action involves some of the most
difficult and complex issues in our society Reasonable people
differ on what it means, has meant or ought to mean. In the hope
that it will facilitate further examination and discussion, I offer my
full statement here to the senators, and all of Stanford, in advance
of the Oct. 12 Senate meeting.
â– 
Government-mandated affirmative action began with
President Lyndon Johnsons Executive Order 1 1246 of 1965.
Affirmative action requirements applicable to the employment
decisions of federal contractors, including universities, were
substantially reinforced and extended under President Nixon.
Most regulations originate with the executive branch rather than
Congress, and require outreach, plans, goals, and timetables State
regulations also come into play. Some affirmative action for
instance, in college admissions is voluntary in the sense of not
being mandated by government.
Affirmative action docs not require, and does not mean,
quotas or preferment of unqualified over qualified individuals.
Indeed, such preferment may violate anti-discrimination laws.
Affirmative action is based on the judgment that a policy of true
equal opportunity needs to create opportunities for members of
historically underrepresented groups to be drawn into various walks
of life from which they might otherwise be shut out. Barriers
continue to exist in society, and therefore affirmative action asks
us to cast our net more widely to broaden the competition and to
engage in more active efforts for locating and recruiting applicants.
Of course, the very act of broadening the competition means
that more candidates will seek, and be considered for, the same
finite number of admissions places or employment openings and
the competition for them will therefore be more intense. It would
be hypocritical to suggest that affirmative action, even without
quotas, does not diminish the opportunities for some who, in the
past, might have benefited from a narrower casting of nets or
narrower definitions of merit.
The terms "merit" and "qualified" occasionally are used as if
they were self-defining. Merit, however, ordinarily depends on
many qualities of an individual and on judgments about how their
combination might further the tasks of a university, government
agency, or any other organization. Still. I repeat: Affirmative action
does not justify admitting, hiring, or promoting those who are not
well-qualified for the work ahead of them.
For about 30 years, debate about affirmative action has been
constant, though only occasionally very heated. In 1995. the
discussion has become more intense and much louder. It is not
sufficient to explain this phenomenon in terms of electoral politics.
The politicians are responding to views and opinions whose forceful
expression has triggered, and been triggered by, plans for a referen
dum in California. The "California Civil Rights Initiative," as
presently worded would prohibit using "race, sex, color, ethnicity
or national origin as a criterion tor either discriminating against or
granting preferential treatment" to anyone in public schools,
employment, or contracting. The initiative is not at least not
directly aimed at private institutions such as Stanford University.
It is often unclear why a given public controversy erupts at a
particular moment. I am not an expert on social movements, and
my hunches may or may not have some basis in fact. To me it
seems that a confluence of various trends has led to the present
crescendo concerning affirmative action.
(1) The traditions of our country emphasize the individual
person and individual autonomy rather than group membership.
The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution was
primarily aimed at the unequal treatment of individuals on account
of race. Affirmative action makes group membership a salient
characteristic of an individual. This defining element has left many
Americans uneasy, including some supporters of affirmative action.
(2) Because affirmative action has conferred legal status on
group membership, many are worried about a balkanization of our
society. They are especially concerned about the possibility that
some separatist forms of multiculturalism are incompatible with the
desire of maintaining a more open and more stable country. While
American law mostly forgoes quotas, there is a suspicion that plans,
goals, and timetables represent a "quota mentality."
(3) Claims for the benefits of affirmative action have been
proliferating. They have thus undercut the original rationale for
affirmative action that flowed not exclusively, but primarily, from
the historical grievances of African Americans. Groups that have
been the victims of a multiplicity of social, cultural, religious, and
economic traditions and institutions advance claims that raise
complex questions about the responsibilities and competencies of
government.
(4) Our country, for the last 30 years, has been going through
vast demographic, economic, and social transformations that seem
to bring into question many, if not all, values that once dominated.
Also, economic uncertainties a few decades ago did not seem to
have the comprehensive reach that, for instance, characterizes
present-day "downsizing." As only too many Americans know,
downsizing may leave the unskilled, skilled and highly skilled of
all age groups alike suddenly without jobs. In this setting, educa
tion becomes even more crucial than it has always been. Thus,
getting into a good school that has only a limited number of places
is an urgent desire of many students and their families. They worry
about whether they will receive fair consideration in competitions in
which, at Stanford for example, less than 20 percent of the already
self-selected applicants to the freshmen class are offered admission.
I should like to address further the specific subject of college
admissions at Stanford. To the extent to which I deal with questions
concerning underlying principles, much of what I should like to
say also applies to, or at least has implications for, employment at
Stanford. 1 am making these comments against the background of
the national debate about affirmative action. However, I am re
stricting myself to what Stanford is doing and what, in my view, it
should be doing. I have emphasized in the past, and I repeat now,
that Stanford University is a private institution that has, and should
have, considerable freedom in the pursuit of its educational goals
and ideals.

Let me begin by speaking about what Stanford has stood for
since its founding. When I.eland Stanford and his wife, Jane, lost
their 15-year-old only child, Leland Jr., in 18X4. they decided to use
their wealth to do something for "other people V sons and daugh
ters. This sentiment led to the founding of our university.
In a 1 1 >()2 address, which formally amended the Founding
Grant, Jane Stanford stressed that the moving spirit of the founders
was "love of humanity and a desire to render the greatest possible
service to mankind." I quote: "The University was accordingly
designed for the betterment of mankind morally, spiritually, intellec
tually. physically, and materially. The public at large, and not alone
the comparatively feu students who can attend the University, are
the chief and ultimate beneficiaries of the foundation." The
university's "chief object" was to be "the instruction of students
with a view to producing leaders and educators in every field of
science and industry."
The university's initial policy of not charging tuition was
adopted I again quote Jane Stanford, to "resist the tendency to the
stratification of society, bv keeping open an avenue whereby the
deserving and exceptional may rise through their own efforts from
the lowest to the highest station in life. A spirit of equality must
accordingly be maintained within the University." I point out that
Stanford admitted women when many of its peers would not even
have considered the possibility.
The means that Jane and Leland Stanford chose to implement
their lofty goal "to promote the public welfare" was to found,
endow, and have maintained "a University of high degree." The
quality of the university was the sine qua non for the pursuit of the
more general ends. Nowadays, we would go beyond seeking a
university merely of high degree and instead refer to achieving and
keeping a university of the highest degree.
This ev ocation of our institutional purposes is helpful in
reminding us that it would be exceedingly narrow -minded to assume
that the pursuit of the univ ersity as envisioned in the founding
documents calls for a one-dimensional approach in choosing those
to whom we give the opportunity to study at Stanford. As we look
for the leaders of tomorrow, if all we considered were capacities
measurable on a scale, without taking into consideration other
aspects of being "deserving and exceptional," we would be betray
ing the Founders. We would be betraying the Founders if we
disregarded their stated concern about "the tendency to the stratifi
cation of society."
In the early years of Stanford, to gain admission as an under
