## 'Studmuffins of Science' Med Ph.D. poses 
### Evren Dogan 
A new and different calendar will appear on the stands in 1996,
sitting besides swimsuit calendars and Cindy Crawford posters. It
is called " 1 he Studmuffins of Science," and will feature Ph.D. stu
dents and professors — all male — from around the country, pho
tographed swimming or biking, as well as working hard in their
labs.
Just like in many other fields, Stanford beats the competition
— this time by having a Stanford Ph. D. student, Brian Scottoline
from the Medical School, not only grace the month of January
with his picture, but also appear on the cover of the calendar.
1 he producer of the calendar, Karen Hopkin — a Ph.D. in bio
chemistry and a science writer — found a few pictures of Scotto
line through a friend, and became interested in having him pose
for the new calendar. After being contacted through a surprising
e-mail message from Hopkin, Scottoline, "thought about it for a
few days, talked to some of my friends about it and decided it
would be fun."
Besides Scottoline, professors from schools around the country
from Columbia to Colorado State — have posed for the calen
dar. Due to the publicity surrounding the calendar, Scottoline has
been interviewed bv The Wall Street Journal and Newsweek.
The reactions from Scottoline's lab colleagues and co-workers
range from supportive to teasing. One of his lab partners has
placed the Newsweek article up on his door, attaching a little note,
saying, "Do we know this guy?"
"This is what 1 mean when 1 say some of my lab partners are
giving me a hard time," Scottoline said. Despite the continual
teasing, Scottoline said that he has yet to receive any negative
reactions concerning his posing for the calendar.
When asked about the common belief in society that scientists
are geeks and nerds, Scottoline simply said, "There are so many
people at Stanford who are good at academics and sports and have
good looks." He says that some of his lab partners are only
involved in their research at the lab. However, far from belittling
this approach, Scottoline feels that there is no other way to finish
a Ph.D. within a single lifetime than to devote most of one's time
to the degree.
Scottoline, originally from Orange County, Calif ~ has been pur
suing a Ph.D. in biochemistry for the past six years. His thesis
concerns one of the steps in the life cycle of retroviruses, including
HIV — a topic chosen due to his fascination with the DNA recom
bination process in retroviruses.
Unlike some of his lab partners, Scottoline does not spend his
entire time in the lab, but swims with Stanford's master team. He
has been involved with the sport since the age of seven. Scottoline
said he believes that swimming — far from taking away from time
that could be spent in the lab — has taught him discipline. He
emphasizes the fact that most of his early teammates have been
very successful in their lives, and Scottoline thinks swimming has
had a major effect on their success.
While Scottoline continues to work hard in his lab and in the
pool, women around the country will be putting up his picture on
their walls. The calendar could bring him many new admirers
and maybe patients — just curious to see him in the flesh. After
all, who wouldn't like to get treated by a successful doctor who
looks great?
