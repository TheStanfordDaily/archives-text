# Stereograms: what you've missed

112 I * this stupid pattern for

see yfnytfling in 3-D. Is this
some kind ofcrueljoke? What's
going on ?
Alt's actually a hidden
• message designed by
• aliens in an attempt to
gain world domination. When you
focus your eyes correctly, you not
only see a fascinating three-dimen
sional picture, but are unknowing
ly subjected to a subliminal mes
sage which will slowly erode your
brain cells and render you inca
pable of coherent thought. (My
sources tell me that CIV and fresh
man writing tire also involved in
this plot.) You are the last bastion
of hope for saving the entire
human race from invasion by these
nefarious, bug-eyed creatures.

Wait a minute, I'm bug-eyed!
Oh, well, forget everything I just
said. Stereograms are good for you.
They're not harmful — in fact,
t hey work like thus:
Human perception of depth
relies on many different visual
cues. These cues can be catego
rized as either monocular or binoc
ular cues and texture gradients.
These cues can all be seen with
only one eye and are what allow
you to sense depth in photographs

and paintings.
The other type of depth cues are
binocular depth cues. These cues
require both eyes and depend on
the different images which each
eye perceives.
To get an idea of how binocular
cues work, try this. Get a pencil
and hold it at arm's length. Don't
try to hold it out tmy farther than
that. Trust me, it doesn't work.
Now close your right eye and line
the pencil up with a distinct object
in the background, for example,
Hoover Tower. Next, open your
right eye and close your left one.
The pencil should no longer be
lined up the same way it was
before, but should appear further
to the left. When you open both
eyes, your brain interprets these
two differing images to tell you
t hat, in fact, you are not looking at
a gigantic pencil while holding a
small phallic symbol in front of
you, but that things are the other
way around.
These binocular cues are veiy
powerful, and they alone can pro
duce the sensation of depth. This
idea was proposed bv Bela Julesz at
Bell in 1960. To study binoc
ular depth perception he invented
the Random Dot Stereogram
(KDS) which evolved into the Sin
gle-Image Random Dots Stere
ogram (SIRDS) we know today.
If you've ever looked closely at a
SIRDS, you will see that it is com
posed of a repeating pattern, which
is not perfectly repeated and this
irregularity is what creates the illu
sion of depth. When you look at a
SIRDS correctly, your two eyes are
not actually looking at the same
place on the picture, but at two
horizontally adjacent sets of the
patterns. When you focus your
eyes just behind the stereogram,
your left eyes sees the pattern on
the left and your right eye stx?s the
pattern on the right.
However, both eyes think they
are looking at the same pattern,

slightly behind the plane of the
paper, where their respective lines
of sight meet. Now suppose the left
pattern is slightly different when
compared to the right pattern.
Your brain thinks that each eye is
looking at the same pattern and so
it interprets the difference as a
three-dimensional image.
In a stereogram, however, the
pattern continues towards the left
and the right. Why? The left eye
not only sees the pattern on the
left, but also the pattern on the
right. So, if we take the pattern on
the right, deform it slightly and
place it furt her to the right, we get
another set of two patterns which
our brain am interpret in three
dimensions.
Since the brain only interprets

relative differences between the
images your two eyes perceive, you
can continue deforming the pat
tern as you work your way to the
side, to produce a three dimension
al effect. This also applies going in
the other direction, so theoretical
ly, you could produce some very
wide stereograms. Perhaps even
wide enough to span the gap in
between.
So now that you have an idea of
how stereograms work, go back
and give it another shot. Maybe if
you stare long and hard enough,
you'll eventually be able to find the
hidden 3-D image.
My only hope is that if you stare
long and hard enough at this arti
cle. something funny might
appear.
