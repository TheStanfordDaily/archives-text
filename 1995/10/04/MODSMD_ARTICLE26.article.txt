# Mice that can't walk help scientists

Identification of a key gene in mutant mice
has provided new direction for research in neu
ronal development, which could begin to unrav
el some of the mechanisms behind Parkinson's
disease, according to an article in the October
issue of Nature Genetics.
However, this gene should not be heralded
prematurely as the solution to the Parkinson's
mystery, cautioned Nila Patil, lead author of the
article. Patil is a post-doctoral fellow with
Genetics Prof. David Cox.
"We know it's a gene involved in nervous
system development," Patil said. "Whether it
will tell us anything about Parkinson's disease
is speculation, just based upon observations."
Genetic studies have enabled Patil and col
leagues to draw a correlation between the iden
tified mutant gene and certain traits of
"weaver" mice, called so because of their inabil
ity to walk straight. In addition to the weaving
pattern that characterizes their walk, these
mice suffer sporadic seizures, male infertility
and most dramatically, considerable loss of cells
in the cerebellum.
So whore's the tie in with Parkinson's dis
ease?
"Here's the only connection between Parkin
son's and this mutant gene," Patil explained.
"It's these dopamine-producing nerve cells in a
certain region of the brain. They're the same
ones that die during Parkinson's."
Dopamine is one of many neurotransmitters,
or chemical messengers, which enable nerve
cells to communicate with one another.
Patil stressed that although the loss of
dopaminergic neurons in weaver mice is intrigu
ing because this cell population is also lost in

Parkinson's disease, much remains to be stud
ied before observations from the mouse system
can be applied to a human disease.
Parkinson's disease typically strikes during
middle or late life, occurring in one to two per
cent of families. Behavioral manifestations of
the disorder include stooped posture, stiffness
and slowness of movements, rigidity of facial
expression, and rhythmic tremor of the limbs.
"The main difference is that in the mouse
I the loss of dopamine-producing cells] happens
during development, whereas in humans,
Parkinson's symptoms appear in old age," Patil
explained. "Also, there are many other regions
of the brain that are affected in the mice."
The identification of the weaver gene may
open doors to increased understanding of the
mechanisms behind the dopaminergic cell loss,
which could enhance our knowledge of what
causes Parkinson's disease.
When Patil began her quest to identify the
weaver gene three years ago, she expected to
find a gene encoding a protein that played a role
in cell signaling, since it had been suggested that
the cell death observed in the cerebellum may be
due to the inability of differentiating neurons to
respond to essential chemical cues during devel
opment.
Instead, Patil discovered that the weaver
mutation was a single base-pair substitution in
a previously identified gene, Girk2 (G-coupled
inwardly rectifying potassium channel), which
encodes a protein regulating the outward flow of
potassium ions from cells.
The identification of the weaver gene as a
mutation in Girk2 came as somewhat of a sur
prise because the only known function of Girk
genes prior to Patil's work was in regulation of
the heartbeat.

This system provides one of the first pieces of
evidence that the protein (!IRK2 may be
involved in nervous system development, said
Cox, who supported Patil's research.
Cox pointed out another unusual aspect of
the weaver gene identification process. "The
irony of it is that we used human genome infor
mation to discover what's going on in the
mouse," he explained.
Patil's research took advantage of the ex is
tence of homologous regions of DNA shared by
many mammalian species.
When she began her search for the weaver
mutation, it was already known that the gene
was located in a region of DNA in mouse chro
mosome 16 that is homologous to a stretch of
DNA comprising a portion of chromosome 21 in
humans.
Using DNA sequence analysis and modern
genetics database systems, Patil was able to use
this segment of chromosome 21 to identify
homologous regions in mouse chromosome 16
that would be candidates for the weaver gene.
Presently, Patil is trying to study the mutant
weaver gene in order to understand how the sin
gle base-pair substitution affects the protein's
function. Eventually, Patil hopes to understand
how the weaver mutation kills cerebellar cells
and dopaminergic cells. "I'm trying to focus on
how the gene affects the brain during develop
ment," Patil explained.
Despite the excitement surrounding the
weaver gene's potential connection to Parkin
son's disease, "it is difficult to study because we
have no direct access to patients with Parkin
son's here at Stanford," said Patil. Collabora
tion with other labs will be necessary to examine
whether the weaver gene indeed relates to the
mechanisms behind Parkinson's disease.

mutation, it was already known that the gene
was located in a region of DNA in mouse chro
mosome 16 that is homologous to a stretch of
DNA comprising a portion of chromosome 21 in
humans.
Using DNA sequence analysis and modern
genetics database systems, Patil was able to use
this segment of chromosome 21 to identify
homologous regions in mouse chromosome 16
that would be candidates for the weaver gene.
Presently, Patil is trying to study the mutant
weaver gene in order to understand how the sin
gle base-pair substitution affects the protein's
function. Eventually, Patil hopes to understand
how the weaver mutation kills cerebellar cells
and dopaminergic cells. "I'm trying to focus on
how the gene affects the brain during develop
ment," Patil explained.
Despite the excitement surrounding the
weaver gene's potential connection to Parkin
son's disease, "it is difficult to study because we
have no direct access to patients with Parkin
son's here at Stanford," said Patil. Collabora
tion with other labs will be necessary to examine
whether the weaver gene indeed relates to the
mechanisms behind Parkinson's disease.
