# Just trying to learn some common sense

\in-'tel-e-jen(t)s\ n. the ability to
learn or understand or to deal with
new or trying situations.
All of us can remember some of
the first things we've learned
from tying our shoes to reciting our
multiplication tables. While we
don't yet have self-tying shoes, we
certainly do have calculators and
computers to handle most of our
mundane multiplication tfisks.
But how many of us can remem
ber when we first learned all of the
"rules of thumb" which govern our
daily lives? Who taught us common
sense? That is the very problem that
computer scientists like Dr. Douglas
Lenat are trying to figure out and
"teach" computers.
Dr. Lenat currently straddles his
responsibilities between running a
company called Cycorp in Austin,
Texas and serving as a consulting
professor of computer science here
at Stanford. Lenat spends about one
week a month in the Bay Area,
remaining in close contact with

other Stanford research scientists.
He also teaches a course at Stanford
every other ye<u\
Lenat earned his Ph.D. from
Stanford almost two decades ago
and for the last ten years has been
working on a huge knowledge-base
— similar to a database — project in
Texas called Cyc. This massive
effort involves the codification of
common sense, or Jirtificial intelli
gence.
Just what is Cyc? "I It's] a collec
tion of about a million everyday
rules of thumb of how the world
works in formal logical language,"
Lenat described. Information
encoded includes things like facts
about people, the world, time, space
and reasoning — to name but a few,
Lenat said.
What Cyc is not trying to do is
understand how the brain works.
Instead, it is attempting to create a
useful interface for existing comput
er programs. The goal is to aid in
software applications like document
preparation and database or spread
sheet analyses.

"Cyc is not a scientific aim — it's
an engineering aim," Ixmat empha
sized. "What we're trying to build is
a mental prosthesis," he said. Just
like advances in medicine have pro
longed our life span, Cyc
researchers want to extend and
amplify our existing mental capacity
as mortals who tend to forget things
more easily than machines.
According to Lenat, potential
applications would be programs
akin to our everyday "Spellcheck"
— but much more sophisticated.
For example, he said, such a pro
gram could identify incorrect
entries in a spreadsheet program
such as Lotus 123 that resulted in
calculating an annual income of
$19.43 — clearly an improbable
value. In contrast, current pro
grams can identify more obvious
errors but are not able to "reason"
that people normally earn more
than $20 per year.
Programs similar to Cyc have
been around for some time. In the
mid-19705, a program called Mycin
was designed and developed to help

physicians diagnose illnesses like
meningitis. It did this by drawing
from years of clinical experience
gathered from hundreds — even
thousands — of physicians.
The problem with programs like
Mycin, however, is their narrow
range of "knowledge." For example,
ask Mycin about a rusty old car and
it might diagnose measles, Lenat
said.
So, how do you go about teaching
a computer to learn and remember
facts and concepts which allow it to
"make decisions" and "give advice"
across a broad range of disciplines?
It's taken Lenat and co-workers
nearly a decade to get to the point
where they are now — at a level
where the Cyc database can grow on
its own, with the help of continuous
input of information from people all
over the world.
The reason that it has taken ten
years to get to this stage is that all of
the pieces of information fed into
the database had to first be translat
ed into computer-speak, Lenat
explained. He said that there needs

to be a critical mass of information
— around one million pieces —
before it is able to do the transla
tions itself. S(x>n Cyc will be able to
accept information in everyday
English, or in whatever languages it
knows.
In a few years time, Cyc will be

able to be accessed in a user-friendly
way over the Internet, said.
From that time on, Cyc's education
will occur at a very rapid pace, creat
ing a virtual continuum of informa
tion to make the database more and
more up-to-date — increasingly
more "intelligent."

The reason that it has taken ten
years to get to this stage is that all of
the pieces of information fed into
the database had to first be translat
ed into computer-speak, Lenat
explained. He said that there needs

to be a critical mass of information
— around one million pieces —
before it is able to do the transla
tions itself. S(x>n Cyc will be able to
accept information in everyday
English, or in whatever languages it
knows.
In a few years time, Cyc will be

able to be accessed in a user-friendly
way over the Internet, said.
From that time on, Cyc's education
will occur at a very rapid pace, creat
ing a virtual continuum of informa
tion to make the database more and
more up-to-date — increasingly
more "intelligent."
