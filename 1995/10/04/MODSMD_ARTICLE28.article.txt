## Start of academics does not faze football players 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Today marks the beginning of the
second week of classes. Students across
campus are making the sometimes diffi
cult transition from the days of summer
to a life of study.
For members of the Stanford football
team, currently No. 19 in the AP poll
and No. 20 in the USA Today / CNN
rankings, this change may be slightly
different than the one experienced by
most students on the Farm. Since the
first drills of summer practice, the play
ers have concentrated solely on football.
Their single-minded focus has proved
solid enough to carry an undefeated
record through the first five weeks of
the season.
Now, the Cardinal must hit the
books as well as the field. Will this dis
rupt the team's momentum?
"A lot of guys, especially the younger
guys, can get preoccupied with classes,"
said junior defensive Brian Werner.
"And you could make the argument
that athletes here care a lot more about
their grades than athletes at some state
schools. But that stuff shouldn't make a
difference."
Cardinal head coach Tyrone Willing
ham is confident that his squad can
work through the adjustment period.
Still, he's interested in seeing just how
quickly his team makes that adjust
ment.
"You're concerned about how that
initial week back in class affects your
team," he said. "Once you've done a full
week and gotten into a routine, I think
everything begins to fit into place. But
I'll be concerned just initially with how
that impacts on whether our guys can
maintain the kind of focus necessary to
be successful."
Defensive coordinator Bill Harris is

also curious to see whether his players
will be able to execute in the same man
ner they have been. He has a few sug
gestions on how they can maintain their
energy and intensity and avoid getting
worn down by either their football
schedule or class schedule.
"What the good teams do is see that
they have two parts of their lives," Har
ris said. "They have academics and they
have football. Girls, partying — all
those other things have to be put to the
side. |The players) have to concentrate
on getting good grades and playing good
football."
Most of the players, especially the
veterans, aren't too worried about bal
ancing the two responsibilities.
"It's just time consuming," said
junior right guard Brad Badger. "But
it's not going to make that much of a
difference. Just like anything else, we
have to minimize distractions and keep
doing what's important."
However, there are always athletes
who need time to find the proper equi
librium. Sophomore defensive end Carl
Hansen understands how the switch
can take a younger player by surprise.
"All freshmen (athletes) have to take
two classes during the preseason — a
writing class and an introductory com
puter class — and that kind of gets you
prepared, but not totally," he said
"(Starting classesl was kind of a shock,
but at the same time it was what I was
expecting and had been getting ready
for."
Older and wiser, Hansen expects no
trouble as his sophomore campaign
enters the academic year.
"1 definitely know more about how to
prepare — about how to structure your
schedule and how to make sure you get
enough sleep," he said.

Cardinal tacklers now must hit the books as hard as they hit this Spartan in the season opener, which Stanford captured 47-
33 for its first winning start in nine years.
The Cardinal's schedule also
helps the team deal with its first
week of school. Stanford's bye fell
this past weekend, allowing play
ers to take care of those begin
ning-of-the-year errands and get
used to their classes without also
having to prepare for an oppo
nent.
"It was nice to have time to get
through all that administrative
stuff — moving in, registering for
classes, hooking up your phone —
without having to worry about a
game," Hansen said.
Now settled in, the team mem
bers must survive the rigors of
the classroom just as any other
Stanford student does. In addi
tion, they must withstand 20
hours of practice per week and
the physical trial of a Pacific 10
Conference opponent every week
end. ()nly time will tell if they can
keep both their GPAs and their
team's record looking good.
