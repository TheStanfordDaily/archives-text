Pacific

Crushing Pacific for the second time
this year, the Stanford field hockey team
proved yesterday that it could consistent
ly perform on the field.
After beating Pacific 3-0 in their last
matchup on Sept. 23, it may have been
natural for the Cardinal to expect an easy
game this time around, hut the Stanford
players prepared themselves to play their
best.
"Pacific always comes out strong the
second time around," said junior Amy
Marfil.
But this time, that theory failed.
Stanford beat the Tigers 5-0 at home
yesterday, leaving Pacific scoreless
against the Cardinal this season.
Stanford dominated the game with its
aggressive offense and a strong defense,
which left goalie Kelly Naylor well rested
during the game. The Cardinal attempted
a total of 43 shots, whereas Pacific tried
only two.
From the outset, Stanford controlled
the ball, scoring two goals in the first half.
The first, with '29 minutes, 45 seconds left
to play in the half, came off an assist from
freshman forward Monique Leroux to

freshman forward Sarah Medeiros from
10 yards away. Medeiros hit the ball in
perfectly between the goalie's legs.
The first score was just the beginning.
Four minutes later, freshman Carey
Cloyd knocked another one in, again with
Leroux on the assist.
"Monique was dribbling then she
dished it to me, and I pushed it in," Cloyd
said. "We needed to win this game to have
a chance [to go to the NCAA Champi
onships.! "
The Tigers battled back in the second
half, bringing the ball down the field a few
times, but Stanford's defense prevented
them from scoring. "They never really got
the ball within the 25 [-yard marker] with
any real threat," said tri-captain Elise
Morgan.
Morgan scored in the second half on a
penalty corner with 30:10 remaining. A
shot by Marfil was rejected bv the defend
er, but Morgan recovered the ball and
fired it into the goal.
Stanford consistently beat its opponent
to the ball and maintained control of the
pace of the game. "I think we did a really
good job of stepping up to the ball and
hustling," Morgan said. "In the past
Pacific has out-hustled us, but today we
really out-bustled them."
Another quick goal by junior forward
Kory Taylor with 22:35 left in the game
brought the toll to 4-0. Taylor reverse
stick-flicked a ball that was crossed in
front of the goal.
Ten minutes later, junior for
ward Melissa Mueller scored Stan
ford's final goal of the game.
Mueller was standing at the top of
the circle and slapped the ball run

ning parallel to the goal box. The
ball rolled between the defender's
stick and foot directly into the net.
Taylor assisted on the goal.
Coach Sheryl Johnson was
pleased by her team's perfor
mance. "It was a good team
effort," she said. "1 really like that
the goals were spread out. A lot of
different people scored."

Stanford did not let up at all
against its opponent. "We did a
good job stepping up in the pass
ing, touching the ball in the circle
and taking more shots in the 25,"
Marfil said. "Defensively, we real
ly came up to the ball. We moved
up the field together and dropped
back together. I think we just
played really well."
