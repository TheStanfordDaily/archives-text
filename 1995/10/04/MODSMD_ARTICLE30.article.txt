# Golf unleashes young tigers
## Men's clubbers turn toward Woods, freshmen 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
A year ago, the Stanford men's
golf team, with a once-in-a-life
time collection of talent, stood
poised to begin a season of utter
dominance. A year later, the out
look is considerably less opti
mistic.
Losing four All-Americans can
certainly turn matters around.
"Comparisons are odious,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin,
"but to be truthful, we'll never
again be like we were last year."
Goodwin faces the daunting
task of resurrecting a juggernaut
that saw All-Americans Notah
Begay, William Yanagisawa,
Casey Martin and Steve Burdick
walk away from collegiate golf
after the Cardinal's second-place
finish to Oklahoma State in last
year's NCAA Championships.
"There's a huge hole to fill and
it won't be filled easily," he said.
Rival coaches aren't crying
tears of sympathy for Goodwin
however. Goodwin still has
sophomore AU-American Tiger
Woods returns, who sported the
lowest stroke average in the
nation last year and finished tied
for fifth individually at the NCAA

Championships last year. Good
win's biggest gun showed no signs
of slowing down in the offseason,
successfully defending his United
States Amateur crown. Woods is
an early favorite to take the indi
vidual title this year.
"Tiger's play will be integral
for this team, as it was last year,"
Goodwin said. "He's older and a
little more experienced this year.
His experience will be key on a
team this young."
Goodwin will also have to
depend on senior captain Jerry
Chang for veteran leadership.
Chang's experience as a starter
has been limited, hut he has
shown nothing but poise under
pressure.
After spending most of last
season on the second team, Chang
maximized his few chances to
prove himself by performing well
late in the season at the Duck
Invitational and the Pacific 10
Conference Championships. By
the time the NCAA Regional
Championships came around, he
had knocked a slumping Burdick
out of his spot on the starting
squad and went on to make ;i solid
contribution to the team's efforts
at regionals and nationals.
"Jerry will definitely he called
on to step up," Goodwin said,
"but he showed last year that he's
definitely up to the task at hand
In filling the remaining three
spots on the starting team, Good
win will definitely look to a small
but talented group of incoming

freshmen. Heading the class is
Joel Kribel, last year's top junior
golfer Kribel has drawn favorable
comparisons to other dominant
juniors of recent years, including
teammate Woods. Given his abili
ties, Goodwin expects Kribel to
play somewhere in the top three
spots.
"Kribel helps a lot to fill the
void," Goodwin said. "With him,
our top three this year should be
one of the best. We may be as
tough through our top three las
last year |, if not tougher."
Fellow freshman Scott Wang
could join Kribel as a starter.
With the top three spots fairly set,
Wang, recruited out of golf power
house Robert Louis Stevenson
High near Pebble Beach, has
come on strong in the team's
qualifiers for the remaining two
places.
Wang is engaged in a fierce
battle with junior Conrad Ray
and seniors David Garcia and
Pete Ligotti to claim the No. 4 or
No. 5 starting spot. Through
Monday's play, three strokes sep
arated the lour golfers, with Ray
posting a 299, Wang two shots
behind at .'{ol and Garcia and
Ligotti knotted at 302. With the
first meet almost a week away
however, several lead changes are
possible.
"This qualifier is pretty big
because we want to be tough at
four and five," Goodwin said.
"Golf tournaments are won and
lost at those two spots. If we can
find a couple of guys who can
shoot 711, 74, 7f> on a consistent
basis to fill those two spots, we
could he a really dangerous
team."

The logjam created by Kay,
Wang, Garcia and Ligotti indi
cates a depth that may prove cru
cial to tHe Cardinal's hopes for
success. While they could have
started for most teams last year,
the three upperclassmen waited
patiently on the second squad,
with little to no hope of cracking
the stacked top five, as Goodwin
had little need to test the depth
chart.
"Most of the scores have been
in a very close range during the
past few days," Goodwin said.
"It'll definitely be more of a
necessity this year to look at all
the guys.
"This whole first part of the
year will be pretty much dedicat
ed to seeing how we play together
and what our strengths and
weaknesses are."
Clearly, the current squad is
not expected to match up with
last year's. Yet, the team has no
less of a desire to succeed.
"This year will be a real fight
to make the NCAAs," Goodwin
said. "It's going to take a huge
effort from all of us. We have to
perform at or higher than our
usual level of play every tourna
ment in order to win."
With traditional rivals Okla
homa State, Arizona State and
UNLV fielding strong teams and
programs like USC rising quickly,
the transition from last year's
mindset will be all the more press
ing.
"We spent all of last season
yoing into matches expecting to
win," Goodwin said. " This year,
we can only hope to win.
"We have to really want to
