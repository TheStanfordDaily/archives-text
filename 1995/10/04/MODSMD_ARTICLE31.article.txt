# Evidence shows Dallas, SF falling
## 
### 
On the eve in which justice, proof
and evidence may have lost all
validity, I have chosen to ques
tion the ultimate certainty in NFL foot
hall. Despite popular belief , the first five
weeks of the NFL season has provided
me with the "evidence" to question the
preeminence of both the defending
champion San Francisco 49ers and the
Dallas Cowboys.

Yes, they are both 4-1 and at least
tied for the lead in their respective divi
sions. Yes, there may exist a heightened
expectation regarding the level at which
the two NFC powerhouses should per
form. Yes, winning football games
remains more important than the
smaller things within the game itself.
But at this point in (he season, I am
confident in saying that a collective fall
from grace by the two teams which
dominated this decade of the gridiron is
imminent. The Niners and the Hoys
just may not be as good as everyone pro
fesses. Join me, if vou will, on an inves

tigation on their first five weeks of foot
hall.
The 49ers opened up with quite an
impressive debut (enter sarcasm), a 24-
22 victory on the road against the now
0-5 New Orleans Saints. The pigskin
community let that one slide after a vic
tory over the Falcons (4-1). But both
the Patriots (1-3) and the Giants (1-4)
held the Niners in check the first half,
both times at San Francisco. And of
course, most significantly, the Lions,
who hadn't shown much of anything
previous to their meeting with the Nin
ers, put the clamps on San Francisco for
the entire game, dropping them at the
Silverdome 27-24.
Meanwhile, the Cowboy fireworks
this season have all come off the field.
Outside of Jerry Jones's pragmatism,
the Cowboys have been far from spec
tacular between the sidelines. Three
wins against Arizona (1-4), the Giants
and Denver (2-3) add up to very little in
terms of talent assessment, while the
Vikings extended them into overtime
before Dallas could pull it out. The only
thing worse than losing to the Lions on
a field goal off the post could be missing
a tackle to lose 27-23 to the Redskins (2-
3).
The Niners, unlike last season, have
shown some weaknesses that other
teams have pinpointed and are begin
ning to exploit. Their running game can
he counted on for nothing more than a
personal foul per game from William

Floyd. We have all seen firsthand what
can transpire if the Niner offense fails
and is forced to punt or attempt a field
goal. Need I mention the secondary?
They have had trouble at home (regard
less of what they call the place), and
looked brutal in their only road game.
The Cowboys may be put into some
vulnerable situations in the future as
well. Quarterback Troy Aikman, start
ing or not, will be banged up physically.
The loss of Alvin Harper cannot be a
positive, and may make life difficult for
Michael Irvin if opponents feel they can
double him without leaving Harper
open on t he other side of the field.
The most glaring factor here, howev
er, remains the fact that teams have at
times contended with both squads for
large portions of the game. With that in
mind, and the fact that many of these
teams are fiat-out not that talented, I
am led to believe that the future may
not be as bright as commonly supposed
for the Cowboys and Niners.
The more teams are able to stay in
games with them, especially early in the
season, the more video teams like Oak
land (4-1), Kansas City (4-1) and Miami
(4-0) — who have been much more
impressive — will have to watch and
analyze in their search for answers on
how to contain the NFC. Coaching can
provide answers, and it seems as if
schemes and strategies have already

been devised to stop (lie once
invincible Dallas and Niner
attacks Whereas Dan Reeves
may not have the personnel, the
teams of Don Simla or Dave
Wannstedt possess the talent t(
execute those strategies.

The truth must be told, howev
er. San Francisco and Dallas will
both win their divisions with rela
tive ease and will still be the
teams to beat in the NFL. 1'he
widely publicized addition of
Deion Sanders will probably fill
many of the Cowboys' holes, and
Doug Brien, Cal contamination
and all, may shake off the jitters
and string together a few kicks.
The 49ers and the Cowboys may

very correct all of these inconsis
tencies and duel for a Super Howl
berth once again. However,
despite the division leads and the
stacked rosters as evidence
against, I have not been con
vinced, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that they are deadlocks for
the NFC Championship game.
And as we have recently seen,
that in and of itself is enough to
dismiss them.
