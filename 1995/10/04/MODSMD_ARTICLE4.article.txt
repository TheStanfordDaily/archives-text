# Casper on affirmative action
## President releases speech in support of policy one week in advance 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Responding to recent political debates
over affirmative action, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper announced today
that he will formally support the contin
uation of Stanford's affirmative-action
policy.
The issue will be discussed at the Fac
ulty Senate's first meeting on Oct. 12.
In the statement, Casper asserted that
a more equal, unstratified society could
see t he curtailment of affirmative action.
However, affirmative action is still neces
sary today, he said.
"If the members of society mostly ig
nored race and ethnicity, we could forgo
taking them into consideration," Casper
said. "We hope that one day we will be
able to do so."
The text of Casper's speech is printed
in today's Stanford Report, as well as in
advertisement form in today's Stanford
Daily. The text was provided to The Daily
on condition that it not be released until
today. Casper said in a separate written
statement that he released the speech
over a week early "to give people time to
examine and discuss the statement."
'It remains necessary'
Despite 30 years of affirmative action

in the United States, some ethnicities are
still facing socially imposed disadvan
tages, Casper said.
"I strongly believe it remains neces
sary to level the field, to recognize that
there are vast differences between pri
mary and secondary schools and how
they develop ability, and to make con
scious efforts to increase the presence of
under represented minorities at all levels
of society," Casper said.
In addition, he said, race and ethnicity
have taken a larger role in today's society
than in previous decades, necessitating
affirmative action policies.
"Alas, our society is quite color-con
scious, and we therefore cannot yet af
ford to be colorblind," he said.
The speech will be made in response to
rising tension over U.S. affirmative-ac
tion policies â€” created in 1965 by Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson. Many Republican
presidential candidates fort he 1996 elec
tion have taken issue with affirmative ac
tion, claiming that the policy discrimi
nates against Caucasians.
Anti-affirmative-action sentiment is
especially prevalent in California, where
voters will decide in November 1996
whether to adopt the California Civil
Rights Initiative. This measure would
prohibit the use of race, gender, ethnicity
or national origin as criteria for preferen

tial treatment and discrimination. Casper
emphasized, however, that the initiative
does not apply to private institutions.
In addition, the University of Califor
nia Hoard of Regents voted in July to
abandon its affirmative-action policies in
college admissions and hiring. The vote
has prompted a reexamination of affir-
