# Casper on affirmative action
## President releases speech in support of policy one week in advance 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Responding to recent political debates
over affirmative action, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper announced today
that he will formally support the contin
uation of Stanford's affirmative-action
policy.
The issue will be discussed at the Fac
ulty Senate's first meeting on Oct. 12.
In the statement, Casper asserted that
a more equal, unstratified society could
see t he curtailment of affirmative action.
However, affirmative action is still neces
sary today, he said.
"If the members of society mostly ig
nored race and ethnicity, we could forgo
taking them into consideration," Casper
said. "We hope that one day we will be
able to do so."
The text of Casper's speech is printed
in today's Stanford Report, as well as in
advertisement form in today's Stanford
Daily. The text was provided to The Daily
on condition that it not be released until
today. Casper said in a separate written
statement that he released the speech
over a week early "to give people time to
examine and discuss the statement."
'It remains necessary'
Despite 30 years of affirmative action

in the United States, some ethnicities are
still facing socially imposed disadvan
tages, Casper said.
"I strongly believe it remains neces
sary to level the field, to recognize that
there are vast differences between pri
mary and secondary schools and how
they develop ability, and to make con
scious efforts to increase the presence of
under represented minorities at all levels
of society," Casper said.
In addition, he said, race and ethnicity
have taken a larger role in today's society
than in previous decades, necessitating
affirmative action policies.
"Alas, our society is quite color-con
scious, and we therefore cannot yet af
ford to be colorblind," he said.
The speech will be made in response to
rising tension over U.S. affirmative-ac
tion policies — created in 1965 by Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson. Many Republican
presidential candidates fort he 1996 elec
tion have taken issue with affirmative ac
tion, claiming that the policy discrimi
nates against Caucasians.
Anti-affirmative-action sentiment is
especially prevalent in California, where
voters will decide in November 1996
whether to adopt the California Civil
Rights Initiative. This measure would
prohibit the use of race, gender, ethnicity
or national origin as criteria for preferen

tial treatment and discrimination. Casper
emphasized, however, that the initiative
does not apply to private institutions.
In addition, the University of Califor
nia Hoard of Regents voted in July to
abandon its affirmative-action policies in
college admissions and hiring. The vote
has prompted a reexamination of affir-


Casper
niative action from other univer
sities and businesses.
Stanford's mission
Quoting Jane Stanford, Casper
said that when the University was
created, its mission was to resist
stratification. Casper emphasized
that choosing students from a
specific rubric would be against
the Stanford tradition.
"As we look for the leaders of
tomorrow, if all we considered
were capacities measurable on a
scale, without taking into consid
eration other aspects of being
'deserving and exceptional,' we
would be betraying the
Founders," he said.
Because the future United
States and world will be multieth
nic and interdependent, Casper

said the use of affirmative action
in admissions decisions should
not be made retrospectively, but
should focus on creating an atmo
sphere necessary to prepare stu
dents for life after college.
Casper discussed the groups
which receive "special considera
tion": children of alumni and fac
ulty, athletes and undergraduate
applicants of African-American,
Mexican-American and Native
American backgrounds. Accord
ing to the Office of Admissions,
the University has never classi
fied Asian Americans as an under
represented minority.
Casper admitted that Universi
ty policy can also aid non-disad
vantaged minority students but
cautioned the Office of Admis
sions against using the extent of
being disadvantaged as a classifi
cation for admission.
"How an individual applicant has
dealt with disadvantage obviously is
relevant to assessments of capabili

ty and resilience," Casper said.
"However, I am extremely wary of
any admissions process in which
economic and social disadvantage
... become categorical criteria to be
formally weighed in decisions alxmt
whom to admit as a student."
Addressing concerns of affir
mative-action opponents, Casper
emphasized that University poli
cy is to consider race for candi
dates of equal merit, not to put
unqualified candidates above
qualified.
"There is no room for categori
cal preferences, there is no room
for quotas, there is no room for
preferring the unqualified over
the qualified," he said. "However,
there is also no room with respect
to any applicant for making quan
titative, scalable admissions crite
ria the sole touchstones of intel
lectual vitality, talent character
and promise. That has never been
the case at Stanford, and 1 hope it
never will be."

tion have taken issue with affirmative ac
tion, claiming that the policy discrimi
nates against Caucasians.
Anti-affirmative-action sentiment is
especially prevalent in California, where
voters will decide in November 1996
whether to adopt the California Civil
Rights Initiative. This measure would
prohibit the use of race, gender, ethnicity
or national origin as criteria for preferen

tial treatment and discrimination. Casper
emphasized, however, that the initiative
does not apply to private institutions.
In addition, the University of Califor
nia Hoard of Regents voted in July to
abandon its affirmative-action policies in
college admissions and hiring. The vote
has prompted a reexamination of affir-

niative action from other univer
sities and businesses.
Stanford's mission
Quoting Jane Stanford, Casper
said that when the University was
created, its mission was to resist
stratification. Casper emphasized
that choosing students from a
specific rubric would be against
the Stanford tradition.
"As we look for the leaders of
tomorrow, if all we considered
were capacities measurable on a
scale, without taking into consid
eration other aspects of being
'deserving and exceptional,' we
would be betraying the
Founders," he said.
Because the future United
States and world will be multieth
nic and interdependent, Casper

said the use of affirmative action
in admissions decisions should
not be made retrospectively, but
should focus on creating an atmo
sphere necessary to prepare stu
dents for life after college.
Casper discussed the groups
which receive "special considera
tion": children of alumni and fac
ulty, athletes and undergraduate
applicants of African-American,
Mexican-American and Native
American backgrounds. Accord
ing to the Office of Admissions,
the University has never classi
fied Asian Americans as an under
represented minority.
Casper admitted that Universi
ty policy can also aid non-disad
vantaged minority students but
cautioned the Office of Admis
sions against using the extent of
being disadvantaged as a classifi
cation for admission.
"How an individual applicant has
dealt with disadvantage obviously is
relevant to assessments of capabili

ty and resilience," Casper said.
"However, I am extremely wary of
any admissions process in which
economic and social disadvantage
... become categorical criteria to be
formally weighed in decisions alxmt
whom to admit as a student."
Addressing concerns of affir
mative-action opponents, Casper
emphasized that University poli
cy is to consider race for candi
dates of equal merit, not to put
unqualified candidates above
qualified.
"There is no room for categori
cal preferences, there is no room
for quotas, there is no room for
preferring the unqualified over
the qualified," he said. "However,
there is also no room with respect
to any applicant for making quan
titative, scalable admissions crite
ria the sole touchstones of intel
lectual vitality, talent character
and promise. That has never been
the case at Stanford, and 1 hope it
never will be."
