## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
The serial rapist blamed for five recent sexual as
saults and two failed attempts is likely a single man
with a history of crime who may seem polite but is in
fact dangerous and unpredictable.
These are just some of the traits noted in a psycho
logical profile of the attacker prepared through the
FBI. Police released details of the profile Monday,
along with a more detailed composite sketch of the
rapist.
More than a dozen law enforcement agencies con
tinue to search for the suspect, now described as a
black male in his late 20s to early 30s, approximately
6-foot, 160 to 180 pounds, with a medium to muscular
build The last local assault attributed to him oc
curred Sept. Kin Sunnyvale. Since then, police note,
he may have changed his appearance to avoid capture.
Police released details of the profile hoping that
someone will recognize the suspect and call the inves
tigators, said Palo Alto Police Officer Lori Kratzer.
"We believe people know him," she said.
Anyone with tips on the case should call the 24-
hour tip line at 329-2307. There is a $25,000 reward
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
the rapist.
The new profile adds psychological depth to the
physical description of the rapist. The suspect may
live alone, but more likely he lives with a "significant
other" who supports him financially, according to a
statement on the profile issued by
the task force hunting the rapist.
Furthermore, it seems the suspect
can travel during the day, but after
11 p.m. may be "accountable to
someone for his time."
The statement paints the attack
er as a wolf in sheep's clothing who
might act "polite" but who "contin
ues to pose a danger, not only to
potential victims, but to friends mid
family members as well."
The rapist is thought to be very
familiar with the Palo Alto / Menlo
Park vicinity and live in, work in or
frequently visit the area. Because
of all the publicity surrounding the
rapes, he may have left the area. If
so, he is expected to return because
he has local connections.
The suspect may also have
stnrpd nhnndnnod or disabled the

van used in several of the attacks: a
white or light-colored vehicle of
American make, 1970s or 1980s
model, with a sliding passenger

side door. The police statement
said the van might be stored in a
friend's or relative's house or
garage. Acquaintances of the
attacker will notice he has stopped
driving the van.
According to the statement, the
suspect may have discussed the
assaults with others and expressed
admiration that the perpetrator
has escaped apprehension. He is
unlikely to have confessed to any
one. The rapist may well have a his
tory of "street crimes," including
assault and robbery.
The profile was drawn by
experts from the California
Department of Justice and the
FBl's National Center for the
Analysis of Violent Crime in Quan
tico, Va.
The new physicid sketch of the
suspect was created by Oregon
artist Jeanne Boylan, who has
drawn sketches in the Polly Klaas,
Susan Smith, Oklahoma City
bombing and Unabomber cases.
