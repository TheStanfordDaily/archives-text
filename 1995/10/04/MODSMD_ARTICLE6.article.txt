# A 						division that works
## One year after Stanford Health Services' divorce 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
A year after its formation, Stanford Health Ser
vices has gone a long way toward its goals of improv
ing community outreach programs, organization and
developing cost-effective management for Stanford
Medical Center, SHS leaders said.
SHS was formed in September 1994 with the pur
pose of bringing the management of all adult patient
care in the Medical Center under one umbrella orga
nization. SHS would bring the practices of Stanford-

area physicians and Stanford Hospi
tal into a single operating unit. The
intention was to simplify payment
plans, decrease management costs
and make it easier for patients to get
the various forms of health care they
needed in one place.
So far, said SHS President Peter
Van Etten, the venture has been a
success.
"I think we've gone very far to-
) t: i„ » u". mi;

ward meeting our goals, he said. 'We have more ef
fectively integrated physician and clinical activities,
and we have developed innovative approaches for cost
reduction without compromising patient care."
Van Etten said he thinks a measure of the pro
gram's success is in Stanford Hospital's financial sta
tus. Most hospitals in the area lost $10 million to $30
million in 1994, he said, hut Stanford Hospital turned
a $1.5 million profit.

"Another measure of our success is that while
Stanford was the first university to consolidate, other
universities are now copying our system," Van Etten
said, referring to the University of Michigan, Johns
Hopkins University and New York University, which
are now in the process of revamping their medical cen
ters in the same way.
"We have created an organization in which em
ployees play a big role in cost reduction because they
have more freedom to make decisions about their de
partments," Van Etten said.
Patients are also noticing improved care at the
Hospital and surrounding clinics, said Sharon Flynn-
Hollander, the associate hospital director for Patient
Care Services.
"We realize the necessity to offer one-stop shop
ping for patients as well as health-care payment
providers," she said.
In the past, she said, it was difficult for patients to
go from a clinic to Stanford Hospital and have their
records straight, but now they deal with a single enti
ty, making it much simpler to get different kinds of
treatment. Similarly, health-care payment providers
such as Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield now only deal
with SHS to arrange payment.
Flynn-Hollander said SHS is also evaluating the ef
fectiveness of current community outreach programs.
New outreach programs are also being developed,
such as the Stanford Mommy Van, which provides on
site prenatal care at clinics in the Stanford area.


Van Etten
Director of Community and
Patient Relations Jeanne
Kennedy agreed, saying that while
most people in the community
don't realize that these changes
have been made, they notice the

difference.
"Patient satisfaction with the
treatment and care that they
received in the Stanford Hospital
has definitely increased," she said,
referring to patient surveys.
"It's a different attitude,"
Kennedy said. "People have the
perception that Stanford is large
and technologically advanced but
that it's not very caring toward

individuals. People are beginning
to realize that it is a caring place.
We've taken great steps in looking
at things from the patient's per
spective."
But Van Etten and Kennedy
said there is always room for
improvement.
"We have a lot more to do, but
we've come a long way," Kennedy
said.

Van Etten agreed. "Ultimately,
our primary objective is to make
the changes that we need to cope
with the extraordinary changes
that health care is undergoing in
America,"he said.
"Our challenge is to support the
research and educational activities
in the Medical Center while dealing
with changes in the clinical envi
ronment," he said.
