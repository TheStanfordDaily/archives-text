## O.J. Simpson acquitted on all counts Jury decides verdict after only four hours 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - O.J.
Simpson headed home yester
day, picking up a life of freedom
instead of starting life in prison.
Acquitted of murdering his ex
wife and her friend, lie pledged
to track down the real killers
who are "out there somewhere."
In a courtroom on the verge
of exploding with emotion, a
hush fell as .Judge Lance Ito's
clerk, Dierdre Robertson, read
the two words: "Not guilty."
Simpson mouthed the words,
"Thank you," at the jury, then
clasped his hands together and
was embraced by his attorneys.
Tears of anguish and shouts
of joy burst from the three fam
ilies whose lives were torn apart
by the bloody June 1-. 1994,
slayings of Nicole Brown Simp
son and Ronald Goldman.
"Oh my God!" exclaimed
Simpson's grown daughter,
Arnelle, embracing her brother
Jason.
"We did it!" a family member
exulted to lead defense attorney
Johnnie Cochran Jr.
Eerily, the Simpson saga
ended much as it had begun,
with the fallen football super
star being transported in a
white van to his estate while
news helicopters tracked him
overhead. Yesterday's televised
verdicts were the most-watched
event since June 17, 1994, when
Simpson, in a white Bronco
with his friend A 1 "A.C." Cowl

ings driving, led police on a sur
real slow-speed chase viewed by
millions.
Cowlings was at the door to
embrace Simpson when he came
home. Later, family members
gathered for a champagne party
on the lawn of Simpson's lush
estate.
"Last June 13, '94, was the
worst nightmare of my life. This
is the second," Goldman's
father, Fred, said at a prosecu
tion news conference. "This
prosecution team didn't lose
today. I deeply believe this
country lost today. Justice was
not served."
At a defense team news con
ference, Cochran insisted the
issue of race, which he played
heavily in the trial, did not over
come the facts.
"This verdict speaks justice,"
Cochran said. "This was a case
based upon the evidence."
He denied playing "the race
card," saying instead that credi
bility had won out.
"Race plays a part in every
thing in America,"he said. "But
this stuff about playing a race
card is preposterous."
He said he hoped the Los
Angeles Police Department
would alter shoddy investiga
tive practices exposed in the
trial.
As the words setting Simpson
free were spoken in court, his
elderly mother, Eunice, seated

in a wheelchair, wiped her eyes,
held up her hands prayerfully
and murmured words of thanks.
"I was always in prayer. I
knew my son was innocent," she
said at the defense meeting with
reporters.
Across the room, Goldman
mouthed the word "murderer"
as the verdict was announced.
Kim Goldman, who spent most
of a year in court honoring her
dead brother's memory, dou
bled over and sobbed along wit h
a younger brother and sister.
At the courthouse, Simpson's
older son, Jason, read a state
ment from his father:
"My first obligation is to my
young children, who will be
raised the way that Nicole and 1
had always planned. . . . Hut
when things have settled a bit, I
will pursue as my primary goal
in life the killer or killers who
slaughtered Nicole and Mr.
Goldman. They are out there
somewhere. Whatever it takes
to identify them and bring them
in, I will provide somehow."
Simpson also noted that
many will surmise he is guilty,
acquittal or no acquittal.
"I can only hope that some
day, despite every prejudicial
thing that has been said about
me publicly, both in and out of
the courtroom, people will come
to understand and believe that I
would not, could not and did not
kill anyone," his statement said.
