# Pope visits his American flock
## Pontiff to address United Nations General Assembly 
### 
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - (laz
ing up at the cathedral on a hill
above his drug-plagued neigh
borhood, Carlos Zhaghay of
Ecuador thought about the last
time he saw the pope, in 1985,
just before he headed north in
pursuit of his American dream.
"Something very beautiful
entered into me then that I
haven't felt here at all," Zhaghay
said.
John Paul II left Rome late
yesterday morning, heading for
Newark, the start of a five-day
U.S. visit that will include ser
vices at Giants Stadium in East
Rutherford, Central Park and
the Aqueduct Racetrack in New
York, and at Camden Yards in
Baltimore. He is to address the
United Nations today.
After an address at the air
port, the pope will travel to
Newark's Sacred Heart church, a
magnificent Gothic cathedral
that stands taller than Notre
Dame in Paris and is larger than
St Patrick's in New York. The

cathedral's refurbishment over
the past two years has been a
symbol of the city's efforts at
rebirth.
The Newark Archdiocese,
with 1.3 million Catholics, is
among the most diverse in the
country, with Mass celebrated in
14 languages at parishes both
wealthy and indigent. Filipinos,
Poles, Indians, Colombians, Chi
nese and Haitians are among
recent immigrants who have
moved into the city.
Newark, the state's largest
city with 275,000 residents, has
many of the worst symptoms of
moral decay that the pope has
addressed in his 17 years as lead
er of the Roman Catholic church.
Among the problems: extreme
poverty, drug abuse, high crime
rates and political corruption.
Officials are on a mission to
remake Newark's image into
that of a "Renaissance City,"
with plans for a $150 million per
forming arts center, a multimil
lion-dollar science park, a $500

million mass transit link with
Newark International Airport
and a $3.2 million roller rink.
The city also reduced auto (heft
by 35 percent in the first six
months of last year.
But severe problems remain.
The state is moving to take over
the city's school district because
an investigation determined it
was politically corrupt, rundown
and failing to educate its 48,000
students. And a scandal involv
ing overbilling and kickbacks in
the city's sanitation division
resulted in 12 guilty pleas from
city officials and mobsters.
The pope has been criticized
by many U.S. Catholics who say
his strict doctrinal readings have
driven away many members of
the faith and caused clergy to
shrivel to the point that some
churches no longer have pastors.
A majority of U.S. Catholics
disagree with the church's posi
tion on abortion, birth control
and the ordination of married
priests.
