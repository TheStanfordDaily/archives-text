## Insufficient evidence cited as reason for acquittal 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — One cop lied,
another was a racist, the glove didn't fit on
O.J. Simpson's hands and was planted on
the grounds of his estate — so Simpson
had to be acquitted, a juror said yesterday.
Brenda Moran, a black computer tech
nician from South Central Los Angeles,
said a glove found behind Simpson's man
sion was key to Tuesday's acquittal of
Simpson on charges he killed ex-wife
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend
Ronald Goldman.
"Somebody planted it," Moran said, sig
naling she agreed with the defense con
tention that Simpson was framed by rogue
cops.
Judge Lance Ito, swamped with more
than 100 interview requests, issued a news
release saying he couldn't talk because Cal
ifornia law bars a judge from discussing a
matter with litigation pending. Three
wrongful death lawsuits have been filed
against Simpson by relatives of the victims.
But the fallout from the verdicts in Ito's
court continued.
At the news conference, Moran, 45, who
repairs computers and printers for the
county courts, said jurors spent less than
four hours deliberating because the prose
cution case was so thin and the evidence
was so untrustworthy.
"Mr. Simpson was not guilty. It was not
proven. 1 didn't have enough evidence to
convince me he was guilty," Moran said.
She said she believed Detective Philip

— j
Vannatter lied and Fuhrman was a racist.
Neither, she said, could l>e trusted as wit
nesses, especially Fuhrman, whose testi
mony she totally disregarded. It was.
Fuhrman who said he found the bloody
glove.
Moran also said the glove demonstra
tion, in which Simpson struggled to put on
the glove from his estate and its mate
found next to the bodies, was crucial.
"In plain English, the gloves didn't fit,"
she said. The statement was reminiscent of
Cochran's closing theme: "If it doesn't fit,
you must acquit."
One other juror was heavily influenced
by the defense contention that Fuhrman's
testimony was not to be trusted because of
his racist views, according to reports.
The daughter of juror Anise Aschen
bach, a 61-year-old retiree, told ABC-TV
her mother told her she thought Simpson
was probably guilty but voted to acquit
"because of Mark Fuhrman" and a lack of
evidence.
Another juror, Lionel "Lon" Cryer, told
the Los Angeles Times he and other jurors
kept finding holes in the prosecution case
and concluded there were many opportuni
ties for contamination of evidence.
"It was garbage in, garbage out," he
said. "There was a problem with what was
being presented to prosecutors for testing
from LAPD."
Simpson's new life, meantime, was the
subject of much speculation.
