# Chernomyrdin won't run
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) Prime Minister Vik
tor Chernomyrdin, considered a top con
tender for the Russian presidency, said
yesterday that he will not run in 1996.
"I did not plan and do not plan to offer
myself as a candidate for the presidential
elections next year," he told reporters
before flying to Canada, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
Chernomyrdin, leader of the new party
Our Home is Russia, is one of Russia's
most popular politicians and has lately
emerged as a potential rival to President
Boris Yeltsin.
His unexpected declaration may have
been prompted by a recent spate of
rumors that Yeltsin was going to fire him.

Relations between the two have wors
ened since the creation this spring of the
centrist political party, which has provid
ed a political base for the prime minister
that could serve as a springboard for a
presidential campaign.
While the prime minister has been
careful to stress his loyalty to Yeltsin,
polls suggest that Chernomyrdin could
pose a formidable threat in presidential
elections — a prospect that may still prove
too tantalizing for the prime minister to
refuse.
Yeltsin, who has had health problems,
has not said whether he will run for a sec
ond term but most observers expect him
to.
