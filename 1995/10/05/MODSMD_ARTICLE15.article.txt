## Grade policy fails 
### 
1994 Faculty Senate
should have listened
to students' concerns

Registration isnt even
due until Sunday, hut the
new grade policy already
seems to he affecting how students
view academics here at Stanford.
A storm of hype and rhetoric
surrounded the policy when it
passed in June of 1994, hut the
facts are now clear. The stricter
requirements are taking their toll
on one of Stanford's more inviting
facets: the ability to explore differ
ent — and often difficult — aca
demic areas without fear.
The loss of experimentation is
not due to the much-heralded
return of a failing grade. For the
majority of students and profes
sors here, an "F" — "or NP" as it
is euphemistically called — will
remain a rare occurrence, as the
"NC" grade has always been. The
thought of having such a grade
appear on their transcripts is not
too threatening to most students.
Instead, what makes the differ
ence is the change in add / drop
deadlines and the new rules for
course retakes.
Under the old requirements,
students could drop courses up
until just before the final exam
without any notation appearing on
their -transcripts.
While the shortening of the
grace period to four weeks after the
start of classes brings Stanford
closer to the academic restrictions
of its Ivy League competitors, the
question remains as to why the
University bothers to change a pol
icy which has not proved detrimen
tal to Stanford's academic reputa
tion.
In 1994, Gail Mahood, the cur
rent chair of the Faculty Senate and
a major architect of the policy
changes, said one reason the shift
was made was to correct the
inequities and misconceptions of the
Stanford transcript. She claimed

that students might find themselves
at a disadvantage when graduate
admissions officers or job recruiters
can't differentiate between an
accomplished Stanford student and
one who had repeated classes to
improve his or her transcript.
Another problem Mahood cited
was manipulation of the system by
students. She claimed that some
students had written to her saying
that they had come to Stanford
because of the lax academic rules.
Apparently, then, the goal of the
Faculty Senate was to force stu
dents to be more careful in select
ing classes. By restricting choice,
students would not, as Mahood
phrased it, get into the situation of
"112 needing! lots of outs [to make up
for] a lack of planning."
And it looks as if the Faculty
Senate has certainly achieved its
goal of making students more cau
tious by restricting choice. But
does this policy make Stanford a
better place academically in the
long run?
Even if charges of grade infla
tion had merit to them, the effects
of this "grade bloat" would have
made itself painfully apparent in
the workplace and in graduate
institutions. But rather than
floundering, Stanford students
continue to excel during school and
after graduation.
Having the luxury of non
restrictive rules on auditing and
retaking classes does not necessar
ily mean that students abuse such
advantages. Rather, we believe t he
privileges allow students to broad
en their academic horizons.
We disagree with the assertion
that the system in the past has
been manipulated by a significant
portion of the students. Conse
quently, we feel that the shift to a
more stringent grading policy is
unjustified.
Students have protested this
restriction of choice ever since it
was first proposed. The members
of the faculty senate should consid
er the objections of the students
they say they are trying to help
more closely in the future.
