ZAP house manager was misrepresented

lAM WHITING in response to Scott
Van Winkle's recent article on possi
ble changes in the alcohol policy here
at Stanford in an attempt to clear up a
&w misreported issues. To begin with,
the first sentence of the article states that
a ZAP resident assistant was arrested on
uidecent exposure charges. This is wrong.
The house manager, not the RA, was
arrested (the article does get this right
later in the article).
Secondly, I feel 1 was misrepresented
in a way that distorted the meaning of my
tjemarks and gave them a sensationalist
twist. I w;is quoted as saying, "They (Uni
versity officials) have interpreted I the pol
ityl so that if someone is drinking to
excess, we are to approach them and . ..

more or less stop them." Yes, we are now
strongly encouraged to approach someone
drinking excessively, but we have not
been told and I did not say that we need
to "more or less stop them."
Rather, we must ask them if they are
doing 0.K., if they have had too much to
drink, etc. We are not being asked to take
beer from anyone's hands and dump it in
the trash or stop the keg from (lowing —
which my quote was twisted to imply. We
are not being asked to take on the role of
"enforcer" of the alcohol policy, for this
was not in our contract when we accepted
our jobs in the spring.
However, we are deeply concerned by
the general tone being sent to us from the
Residential Education central office.

Many of us feel that it is unfair and
unrealistic to expect us to either
approach everyone in every dorm / house
sponsored event who is drinking liberally
and who "according to good judgment
might cause damage to themselves or
others" because of their drinking, or face
the possibility of losing our jobs. We have
also been encouraged specifically to moni
tor binge drinking among minors.
Most troublesome to some of us are
the long-term implications of the new
tone adopted by high level Res Ed admin
istrators. There is a very real possibility
that Res Ed will consider changes in the
RA job description for next year's RAs,
and we are disturbed by the idea that the
RA role might become much more of an

"enforcer" position. Such a move by Res
Ed might dangerously undermine its very
mission of building community in the res
idences.
Finally, the ZAP incident only rekin
dled administration fears which began on
a serious scale with the Roble incident
last year and the ensuing lawsuit against
the University. It seems quite clear that
dollar signs don't lie very far under the
surface of this debate. If you have any
concerns or input on this topic, please
contact your RA or Jane Camarillo, the
new head of Res Ed. She needs to hear
the voices of students on this issue to do
her job effectively.
