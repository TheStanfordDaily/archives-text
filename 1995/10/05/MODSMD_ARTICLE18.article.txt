## Craig Zajac That chopping sound you hear...

CAN YOU believe
that you've only
been here two
weeks? In that time,
you have probably real
ized that there is more
to Stanford than just
CIV and MCATs.
You've spent long hours

memorizing the long list of Stan
fordisms: CoHo, Tres Ex, Mem Avid, Hoo
Tow, etc. You've learned exactly when to
jump during "All Right Now. You've
been to your first Flicks and found a real
ly good use for all those fliers that were
under your door. Your RA may have even
taken you on a midnight excursion to
play Frisbee golf.
Unfortunately, the initial excitement
of being here has worn off and you are
just as puzzled as everyone else as to why
your dorm is pink. And if you've really
been paying attention, you have a firm
grasp on that Cardinal-Cardinals-Treo
thing that all of your back home
are going to ask about.
There are two more Stanford tradi
tions that may not have been explained
to you, however. They both deal with Big
Game, but they have also been known to
show up as extra credit on physics exams.
You see, the students from the school
across the Bay spend the entire year try

ing to come up with witty chants and
taunts to frustrate and enrage the Stan
ford student body. In all the excitement
of trying to prove exactly how clever they
are, they always forget one important
fact which we are always gracious
enough to remind them — we got in. This
response will succeed in frustrating the
Weenies at just about any event, so feel
free to use it at volleyball, basketball or
anywhere else.
The second tradition is the stuff leg
ends are made of. The Stanford Axe is
famous enough that the great German
physicist Werner Heisenberg, when
asked if he had ever heard of Stanford,
replied, "I believe it is somewhere on the
West Coast of America. There is also
another school nearby, and they steal
each others' axes."
It all began back in 1899, at a Cal-
Stanford baseball game in San Francisco.
One of the Stanford yell leaders, in an
attempt to excite the crowd, brought a
large stuffed bear and chopped it into
pieces with a 15-inch ax. Unfortunately,
Cal won the contest, and the yell leaders
were about to discard the Axe when a
group of Cal students snatched it and,
through a series of hand-offs, were able
to bring the blade back to Berkeley. The
Stanford Axe remained there in a bank
vault for 31 years, coming out only dur-

ing Cal's annual rally.
In 1930, a group now referred to as
the Immortal 21 vowed to recover Stan
ford's stolen property. Posing as photog
raphers, they uttered those magic words,
"We'd like to take a picture for the
paper." When the flash powder went off,
they grabbed the Axe and delivered it to
its rightful home.
In 1933, the two schools agreed that
the Stanford Axe would be the trophy of
Big Game. Since then, the Axe has been
stolen by Berkeley twice and reclaimed
by Stanford three times, most recently in
1973 by a group of Stanford students
armed with a plan so original and clever
that the poor Cal folks didn't stand a
chance. Dressed as photographers, the
Cardinal faithfuls uttered those famous
words, "We'd like to take a picture for the
paper."

more about our majestic blade, or just

against the Weenies, visit the Axe Com
