# Stanford attracts top students
##

Changes made last year in the Presi
dent's Scholars Program appear to have
achieved their purpose of making Stan
ford more attractive to the most excep
tional of its applicants, according to the
accounts of both the new crop of fresh
men scholars and figures from the Un
dergraduate Admissions Office
Last year, the program was expanded
in some key and controversial ways. Each
of the 200 prospective freshmen selected
from the applicant pool was offered a
$1,500 research grant and was invited to
visit Stanford at the University's ex
pense.
The intention of these additions, as
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid James Montoya said when
he announced them in February, was to
"recruit top scholars in much the same
way as top athletes."
The President's Scholars program
does not require an additional applica-

tion. Rather, selection is based on the
general application that all prospective
freshmen submit.
According to Keith Todd, coordinator
of the program, before the changes, 58
out of last year's 200 recipients attended
Stanford. Of this year's 2(H) recipients, 79
have come or are coming to Stanford, a 36
percent increase.
In quoting these figures, Todd ob
served that these are acceptance figures
for students who were accepted by a great
range of top schools in addition to Stan
ford. He also said University President
Gerhard Casper has been responsible for
increasing funding and has in general
taken an avid interest in the program.
Looking back on the changes, Todd's
feeling was that "the increase was what
we had hoped for"and that it was "a very
successful program."
This assessment of the changes is
echoed by many of the scholars them
selves. They acknowledged that receiving
the award was the decisive factor in their

selection of Stanford out of the very im
pressive lists of opt ions that are common
to these students. Often, it was just a
question of feeling honored.
"1 was gratified at the recognition"
said Siddhartha Mitra, who has already
done work on organic chemistry at UC-
Berkeley. "That's probably the most im
portant part of the program."
However, the most frequently praised
aspect of the program was the expenses
paid visit. Many students felt that they
would not have come to Stanford if not
for their experiences on a visit, and that
they would not have visited at their own
expense. This was particularly true of
students from the East Coast, such as
Meera Shah of Fairfield, Conn., who felt
that her visit was "what convinced me to
come here."
Some students did find the financial
aspect of the program decisive, but it was
not the most frequently cited reason.
