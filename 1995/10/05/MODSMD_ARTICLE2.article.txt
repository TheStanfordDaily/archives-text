# Stanford attracts top students
##

Changes made last year in the Presi
dent's Scholars Program appear to have
achieved their purpose of making Stan
ford more attractive to the most excep
tional of its applicants, according to the
accounts of both the new crop of fresh
men scholars and figures from the Un
dergraduate Admissions Office
Last year, the program was expanded
in some key and controversial ways. Each
of the 200 prospective freshmen selected
from the applicant pool was offered a
$1,500 research grant and was invited to
visit Stanford at the University's ex
pense.
The intention of these additions, as
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid James Montoya said when
he announced them in February, was to
"recruit top scholars in much the same
way as top athletes."
The President's Scholars program
does not require an additional applica-

tion. Rather, selection is based on the
general application that all prospective
freshmen submit.
According to Keith Todd, coordinator
of the program, before the changes, 58
out of last year's 200 recipients attended
Stanford. Of this year's 2(H) recipients, 79
have come or are coming to Stanford, a 36
percent increase.
In quoting these figures, Todd ob
served that these are acceptance figures
for students who were accepted by a great
range of top schools in addition to Stan
ford. He also said University President
Gerhard Casper has been responsible for
increasing funding and has in general
taken an avid interest in the program.
Looking back on the changes, Todd's
feeling was that "the increase was what
we had hoped for"and that it was "a very
successful program."
This assessment of the changes is
echoed by many of the scholars them
selves. They acknowledged that receiving
the award was the decisive factor in their

selection of Stanford out of the very im
pressive lists of opt ions that are common
to these students. Often, it was just a
question of feeling honored.
"1 was gratified at the recognition"
said Siddhartha Mitra, who has already
done work on organic chemistry at UC-
Berkeley. "That's probably the most im
portant part of the program."
However, the most frequently praised
aspect of the program was the expenses
paid visit. Many students felt that they
would not have come to Stanford if not
for their experiences on a visit, and that
they would not have visited at their own
expense. This was particularly true of
students from the East Coast, such as
Meera Shah of Fairfield, Conn., who felt
that her visit was "what convinced me to
come here."
Some students did find the financial
aspect of the program decisive, but it was
not the most frequently cited reason.
Many students did not care for
the implication that the pro
gram constituted a "bribe."
Allyson Bloom, a prospective
pre-med major from Houston,
noted t hat t he amount of money
involved is seldom enough to be
decisive in deciding to come to a
school like Stanford. "It's not
like $1,500 out of $30,000 is
going to change my mind," she
said.
While it appears that the
changes were significant in
their primary goal of convincing
these students to come to Stan
ford, in the short time that they
have been here, none of the
scholars have felt any effects of
their award in the area of set
ting them apart from the rest of
the class. All agreed that their
professors and advisers had not
been told about the award, and
that the program had a low pro
file. This fact was often cited
positively
"I'm kind of glad that the
program isn't demanding too
much right now," said Khary
Burke of Peoria, 111.
There were somewhat differ
ent perceptions as to how much
impact the program would have
on the students' ongoing career
at Stanford. Many felt that
there was a great opportunity to

create a "network" of award
winners. But there were those
who had the feeling, as one
expressed it, of being "con
cerned with excessive competi
tion" as a result of creating a
distinction based on very high
merit.
One thing that surprised
many of the scholars, irrespec
tive of their expectat ions of the
program, was the charge of
elitism that has been leveled at
the program. "It's not like I
walk around wearing a halo,"
said Stephen C'hien of Fremont,
Calif., observing that very few
people knew or had asked about
his status.
There was also a common
feeling that too much had been
made of the idea of a research
grant. According to Todd, the
grant is in the form of a $1,500
account at the Undergraduate
Research Office (URO), for
which the scholars will have to
apply in the same manner as
anyone else. The money will
only be guaranteed until the
end of the sophomore year.
While some scholars felt that
this last requirement would
stimulate them to do research
earlier in their careers than oth
erwise, Todd indicated that
"sufficiently motivated" under
classmen have access to URO
grants regardless of whether or
not they are President's Schol
ars.
