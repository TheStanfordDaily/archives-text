# Marguerite to expand shuttle service
## 
### Paul Bodnar 
Citing a need to curb the expansion of park
ing structures on campus, Stanford Trans
portation Programs has announced expanded
service for the Marguerite, the University's
free commuter shuttle. The launch of the
expanded program is the first phase of a long
term plan to improve traffic circulation and
transportation efficiency on campus.
Following a test run in September of sever
al new shuttle routes and services, the new
policy's official inauguration is scheduled for
this coming Monday. Changes to the existing
shuttle system include the addition of a new
line, more comprehensive hours for the three
existing routes and direct transfers to and
from commuter trains.
Though the shuttle is free and open to the
public, such vast alterations are not inexpen
sive. The program's budget, the bulk of which
is provided by Stanford, has nearly doubled to
$700,000 in the past year, according to Mar
guerite Operations Manager Diego Terneus.
"Wo cannot afford to continue building
parking structures," Terneus said. "In order

to give faculty and staff an alternative to driv
ing vehicles to campus, we need to give them
better service and also meet their demands
not only while commuting but also for trans
portation within the University."
Terneus added that he expects more people
to ride the Marguerite as new routes are
implemented. Currently, the Marguerite car
ries about 350 riders daily During a test pro
gram last week, Terneus said, drivers noticed
many more passengers.
The revised service is not simply an end in
itself. Rather, it is the first step in a long-term,
sweeping plan developed by Stanford Trans
portation Programs to ameliorate the traffic
situation on campus. The goals of this pro
gram, termed the Stanford Transit Plan,
include the curbing of further parking lot
expansion as well as the reduction of automo
bile circulation on campus.
The plan, which was unveiled in a press
release two days ago, aims to integrate and
connect different iransportation methods —
trains, buses, cars and bicycles — and to cre
ate a safer network of campus pathways and
roads that would prevent hapless pedestrians

from being run over by speeding bicyclist*
during peak circulation hours.
Phase One, however, deals exclusively with
the shuttle. According to the Transportatior
Office, the two main lines ("A" and "B") wil
connect major campus hubs such as Tresiddei
and the Main Quad to both the Palo Alto anc
California Avenue train stations, the Stanforc
Shopping Center, Town and Country Villagt
and three "park and ride" lots on University
lands. These buses will run every 12 to 15 min
utes from H a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday to Friday.
A third shuttle, nicknamed the "Downtowr
Express," will operate between Lytton Plazt
in downtown Palo Alto and the Main Quae
during lunch-time hours, from 11 a.m. to 2:3(
p.m.
Finally, the line connecting central campui
to the Stanford Linear Accelerator ('enter wil
continue to run between the west side of cam
pus and SLAC.
Stanford is not alone in trying to quell th<
ever-growing presence of motorized vehicles
in suburban areas. Similar shuttle system;
are being established throughout the Unitec
States.
