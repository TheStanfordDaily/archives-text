## Wallin coming into his own for Stanford water polo Junior two-meter man seeking NCAA three-peat, threatening to smash Cardinal season scoring record 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
By midseason, it can be expected
that an athlete making a transition to a
new role or position be comfortable and
play well. Stanford water polo coach
Dante Dettamanti has gotten more
than that out of junior Brian Wallin. In
his first season of playing the two
meter position full time, Wallin has not
only been comfortable, he has been
crafty, consistent and, at times, domi
nant.
As the Cardinal reaches the mid
point of its season, Wallin leads the
team with 41 points, a pace that could
put the 6-foot-4, 195-pound junior
among the greatest scorers in Stanford
water polo history. Olympians Craig
Klassand Erich Fischer jointly hold the
school record of 82 goals. Last year,
Wallin tallied 48 points, fourth best on
the Cardinal squad.
Right now, individual honors are far
from Wallin's mind, as the two-time
defending national champion Cardinal
finds itself in the midst of a heated bat
tle for two available bids to the 1995
NCAA Tournament. A new format this
year allows only two invitations for
teams from the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation, which features the
top seven teams in the country.

[Wallin] has really been
our go-to guy.... Brian's
put away some amazing
shots,which is opening
up our front court
offense.'

The Cardinal measured itself up to
this competition last weekend during
the Nor Cal Tournament. Behind
Wallin's 10 goals in just two days of
tournament play, Stanford finished
second after a 14-13 double overtime

loss to USC in the finals.
Wallin's solid play and scoring touch
have helped Stanford adjust to the loss
of Ail-Americans Wolf Wigo and Frank
Schneider, who led the Cardinal to
back-to-back NCAA titles.
"We definitely lost a lot of offense
(with the graduation of Wigo and
Schneider)," Wallin said. "It was
putting more pressure on others to
score. I didn't come into the season
thinking I had to score more, but it just
kind of happened. Last weekend (at the
Nor Cal event), lots of people stepped
up and started scoring."
Throughout the early stages of the
season, it was Wallin who stepped up,
particularly in the absence of All-Amer
ican senior Jeremy Laster, who was
with the United States National Team
until mid-September.
"Brian has carried this team," Det
tamanti said. "We've had trouble scor
ing, especially without Jeremy. Now
Jeremy is opening people up, but Wally
is still getting three or four goals a
game consistently."
Teammate Dan Hancock agreed
with Dettamanti. "[Wallin] has really
been our go-to guy," Hancock said.
"Because he has been a force in the
hole, teams have had to worry about
him and it loosens the press on the out
side. Brian's put away some amazing
shots, which is opening up our front
court offense."
Wallin is enjoying such success
despite learning a new position and
adjusting to a new role in the pool.
Wallin replaces Schneider as the two
meter player, or holeman, situated
directly in front of the goal. Wallin,
who described himself as a utility play
er in past seasons, is now the central
focus of the Cardinal offense.
"Before, I did whatever needed to be
done," he said. "Sometimes it was giv
ing Frank a break, other times it was
just picking up someone specific on
defense. This year, it's more one cer
tain thing that I do every time down. In
some ways, I like last year's role bet
ter. "
Wallin was able to play the utility
role this summer, competing for the
United States at the World University

Games in Japan. The team was coached
by UC-Irvine head coach Ted Newland.
"Newland is a big believer in huge,
strong two-meter men, so for most of
the time, I wasn't setting," Wallin said.
"Toward the end of the tournament, I
did set a bit."
Dettamanti is pleased with how
quickly Wallin has responded to his
new duties.

'There are lots of little
things he can improve
on and learn, but Wally
has great moves and
he's doing very well.'
— Dante Dettamanti

"Last year, Wally played more of a
backup role and scored a few outside
shots," Dettamanti said. "This year, he
has developed into an outstanding hole
man. He is just starting to arrive as a
two-meter man, and he's still learning
the position. There are lots of littie
things he can improve on and learn, but
Wally has great moves and he's doing
very well."
The moves which have defenders
confused come partly from watching a
lot of water polo. Wallin is the youngest
of three brothers and the third to play
water polo at Stanford. Brother Mark
C 92) was a right-handed driver, while
Chris (*94) was a left-handed
driver / holeman. Brian is a combina
tion of both. He possesses the speed of
a driver, and despite being naturally
right-handed, can shoot and handle the
ball with either hand.
"I've never had anyone who could
shoot with either hand like that," Det
tamanti said.
His ambidexterity is a skill that
Wallin began working on as a ninth
grader at Sanger High School in
Sanger, Calif. "It's something I used
for inside water moves at first," Wallin

Junior Brian Wallin, once a utility man, is putting up enormous offensive numbers for
the Cardinal.
sajd. "It became very useful, so I
kept working at it. Eventually, I
was able to do more and more with
my left,"
Wallin uses his unique talent to
play a quick style at two-meters,
which is traditionally thought of as
a power position. "I have to use my
quickness because I'm not as big or
as strong as other holemen," Wallin
said. "It's definitely a different
game in there. I end up wrestling
with the defender a lot more than I
would like. It makes me much more
tired than last year. The physical
aspect is the biggest difference."
Dettamanti and Wallin know
that what could make a big differ
ence in the Cardinal's fortunes is a
more balanced offensive attack.
"It's hard to beat good teams if they
can shut down one or two guys,"
Wallin said "More balance will help
us a lot. We got off to a slow start
this year, but we've gotten used to
playing together and filling the void
left by Wolf and Frank."
Whether he reaches the scoring
record or not, Wallin's main con
cern will be his team's drive to win
a third consecutive NCAA champi
onship. As the Cardinal hits its
stride in midseason and the offense
Ls revitalized, Wallin feels Stanford
is on its way. "We want to rebound
here and get a few wins," he said.
"Other people are stepping up —
that's definitely what we need to
do."
