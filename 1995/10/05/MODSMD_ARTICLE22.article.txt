# Cardinal tennis tunes up with teams from Far East
## 
### Edward Guzman 
They have proven they can be
successful anywhere in the coun
trv, yet both the Stanford men's

and women's tennis squads will
be tested this afternoon as the
Asia University of Japan rolls into
the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Coming off of their 13th NCAA

title last season, the Stanford
men's tennis team boasts a No. 1
preseason ranking and certainly
does not need to better itself by
beginning its season early against
Asia University. But head coach
Dick Gould believes the early
start will prove worthwhile.
"Normally, we would not play,
but 1 feel it gets [the team] going
and it will get their attention,"
Gould said. "We'll see how the
guys are progressing. Hopefully
we'll get off to a good start and
avoid injury."
The Cardinal returns seven
experienced players, including
five starters from last year's
national championship squad,
Stanford's only loss was Scott
Humphries, who decided to turn
professional after his freshman
year. Humphries was ranked sev
enth nationally in singles compe
tition and teamed up with current
sophomore Paul Goldstein to
place in the top five nationally as
a doubles tandem last year.
"We'll miss Scott a great deal,"
Gould said.
Ready to fill in for Humphries,
however, is freshman Ryan
Wolters. Gould has high hopes for
the young freshman from Leland
High School in San Jose. "I'm
anxious to see [him] play," Gould
said. "I would certainly expect
Ryan to step in as a starter and
have an impact on Stanford ten
nis and collegiate tennis overall."
Gould also feels that the con
tinued improvement of sopho
mores Misha Palecek and Charles
Hoeveler are critical to the team's
depth. "Depth is very important,"
Gould said. "Last year we had an
incredibly healthy year. That's
not going to happen twice. [Pale
cek and Hoeveler] did not play
much last year. This year, they
could challenge for a starting
spot. I expect them to."
For today's match, the team
will compete without its top play
er, senior Jeff Salzenstein, who
has stopped out this quarter to
play as an amateur in pro tourna
ments. Senior Jim Thomas is only
probable due to a prior tourna
ment commitment.
This leaves Goldstein to play at
the team's top spot, followed by
Wolters and sophomore Grant
Elliot in the No. 3 position. The
latter three spots will be filled by
senior Ricky Becker, Palecek and
Hoeveler, respectively. Exhibition
matches will begin at 1:00 p.m.

Gould is optimistic about get
ting tlu* season started. "1 do feel
we have one of the best teams in
the country," he said. "How good
it is depends on bow much we
improved."
While the men lose only one
player, the Cardinal women, who
lost in the semifinals of the NCAA
Tournament to eventual champi
on Texas, return every single
member of last year's squad,
including First Team All Pacific
10 Conference members Katie
Schlukebir and Ania Bleszynski.
All 12 members of the 1995-96
roster will see singles action
against Asia University.
Head coach Frank Brennan
looks to the exhibition contest as
a chance to return to the swing of
things against some high quality
competition. "Japan has some
very good tennis players, particu
larly women," Brennan said. "To
generalize, they are very consis
tent and they run like crazy.
They're like playing against a
backboard."'
However, considering that
Stanford has just started practice
this week and that the foreign
team may be underrated, today's
friendly gathering could be a bat
tle.
"This university has come over
a couple of times and you would
think that they wouldn't be much
since there's not much of a uni

versity system over lin Japan),"
Brennan said. "But then I see
that they knock off USC and they
play Cal real close. We're going to
have our hands full. That's the
bad news.
"The other bad news is that
we've been practicing for two
days. The good news though is
that [yesterday] we were really
sharp. I mean there's a difference
between hitting well and playing
well of course, but the girls are
hitting real well right now "
The players are also looking
forward to the match as they con
tinue to get back into collegiate
tennis after a summer of training
and traveling. "It'll be a good
opportunity to play against some
opponents we've never played or
even heard of," said Bleszynski,
who recently traveled to Japan for
a couple of matches.
The competition will be inter
esting for internal reasons as
well. The Cardinal roster is
stuffed top to bottom with tal
ent. Bleszynski, Schlukebir and
redshirt senior Kim Shasby have
all garnered All-American hon
ors in their careers. Junior San
dra De Silva is a former Pac-10
champion. Sophomore Julie
Scott and redshirt senior Amy
Chiminello proved the most suc
cessful of all Stanford competi
tors last season at the No. 5 and
No. (i spots, and senior standout
Beth Berris has recovered from
wrist surgery.
Given such talent, a lineup will
be difficult to produce. However,
Stanford can afford to resolve the
lineup issue later in the year, as
for both the men and the women,
it's iust October.
