# Cardinal tennis tunes up with teams from Far East
## 
### Edward Guzman 
They have proven they can be
successful anywhere in the coun
trv, yet both the Stanford men's

and women's tennis squads will
be tested this afternoon as the
Asia University of Japan rolls into
the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Coming off of their 13th NCAA

title last season, the Stanford
men's tennis team boasts a No. 1
preseason ranking and certainly
does not need to better itself by
beginning its season early against
Asia University. But head coach
Dick Gould believes the early
start will prove worthwhile.
"Normally, we would not play,
but 1 feel it gets [the team] going
and it will get their attention,"
Gould said. "We'll see how the
guys are progressing. Hopefully
we'll get off to a good start and
avoid injury."
The Cardinal returns seven
experienced players, including
five starters from last year's
national championship squad,
Stanford's only loss was Scott
Humphries, who decided to turn
professional after his freshman
year. Humphries was ranked sev
enth nationally in singles compe
tition and teamed up with current
sophomore Paul Goldstein to
place in the top five nationally as
a doubles tandem last year.
"We'll miss Scott a great deal,"
Gould said.
Ready to fill in for Humphries,
however, is freshman Ryan
Wolters. Gould has high hopes for
the young freshman from Leland
High School in San Jose. "I'm
anxious to see [him] play," Gould
said. "I would certainly expect
Ryan to step in as a starter and
have an impact on Stanford ten
nis and collegiate tennis overall."
Gould also feels that the con
tinued improvement of sopho
mores Misha Palecek and Charles
Hoeveler are critical to the team's
depth. "Depth is very important,"
Gould said. "Last year we had an
incredibly healthy year. That's
not going to happen twice. [Pale
cek and Hoeveler] did not play
much last year. This year, they
could challenge for a starting
spot. I expect them to."
For today's match, the team
will compete without its top play
er, senior Jeff Salzenstein, who
has stopped out this quarter to
play as an amateur in pro tourna
ments. Senior Jim Thomas is only
probable due to a prior tourna
ment commitment.
This leaves Goldstein to play at
the team's top spot, followed by
Wolters and sophomore Grant
Elliot in the No. 3 position. The
latter three spots will be filled by
senior Ricky Becker, Palecek and
Hoeveler, respectively. Exhibition
matches will begin at 1:00 p.m.
