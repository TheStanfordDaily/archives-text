After last week's 1-0 loss to
California, Stanford's field hock
ey team will have an opportunity
to even the score with the Golden
Bears at home this Saturday.
To the Cardinal (4-4-0, 2-1-0
Northern Pacific Conference),
this is a key game for its season.
California is the team to beat, and
the Cardinal believes it has the
skill and talent to do so. In last
Saturday's contest at California,
Stanford played hard and gave
California the most competition it
has faced all year. This weekend,
however, Stanford no longer
wants to prove it can compete.
It wants to win.
California defeated Stanford
last season in the conference play
off and went on to the NCAA
Championships, but this time
Stanford has its eyes set on
advancing.
With Pacific out of the run
ning for the conference crown
because of two shutouts by Stan
ford and a 2-1 loss to California,
Stanford needs to win this week
end's confrontation to take the
lead in the division standings.

One major advantage that the
Cardinal will have over the Gold
en Bears is the home field advan
tage. This does not refer neces
sarily to hoards of cheering fans
but rather to the actual field.
California's Kleeberger Stadium

has artificial turf, meaning that
California is less accustomed to
playing with the holes and
clumps of grass on natural ter
rain.

Stanford field hockey dropped a close one to Cal last week, but
vows not to let it happen again this Saturday at home.
Coach Sheryl Johnson said
after last week's encounter that
she looks forward to playing Cali
fornia on Stanford's own turf.
Last week, Stanford almost beat
California on the artificial truff, so
without that advantage, the Bears
will have a tough battle ahead of
them.
One weak point of the Cardi
nal's offense has been a tendency
to take fewer shots in the circle
than its opponents, but the Cardi
nal answered those troubles dur
ing Tuesday's Pacific game. Shot
attempts were definitely not a
problem, as Stanford racked up 43
in the contest.
The Cardinal has focused on
beating California all year, and
last week's loss will serve as moti
vation for Saturday's meeting.
Even before Tuesday's 5-0
blowout of Pacific, Stanford was
looking towards California.
Despite the fact that Stanford is
young - thi' Cardinal feature five
starting freshmen — senior mem
bers of the squad have tried to
emphasize to younger players the
rivalry between Stanford and Cal,
and the importance of beating the
Bears.
But more importantly, Stan
ford wants to win, and it is confi
dent that it will do so this Satur
day.
"We don't anticipate a loss,"
said junior midfielder Amy Marfil.

With 41 goals in less than half of the year, Wallin could break the single season Cardinal scoring record of 82 goals.
