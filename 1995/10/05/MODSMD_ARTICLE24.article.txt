# Stanford ice hockey plugging toward third straight state title

Roasting two consecutive state
championships, Stanford's ice
hockey team will begin its 1995-
96 season this weekend against
two California rivals. One of Stan
ford's better-kept athletic secrets,
the hockey-plaving incarnation of
the Cardinal has represented the
state of California at the Ameri
can Collegiate Hockey Associa
tion's national tournament in the
two preceding seasons, finishing
in the top five both times.
In the dressing room this year,
there is talk of a three-peat.
But Stanford head coach Ernie
F'errari has chosen not to look too
far into the future. "This is one of
the youngest teams we've iced in
a long time," Ferrari said. "We've
lost some veterans, and there are
a lot of new faces this year. Right
now, we're taking it one game at a
time."
A look at the team's roster con

firms that Ferrari isn't just being
modest. Gone are former co-cap
tain and leading scorer Luke Win
ter as well as veteran goaltender
Bill Sutherland. When asked
about Sutherland's departure,
teammate Jon Cooper lamented
the loss of experience and charac
ter, but quickly turned the con
versation to last year's other goal
tender, Sami-Jo Small.
"She's become quite a legend
in college hockey, especially in the
West," Cooper said. "When we
beat Arizona State last year, they
couldn't believe we had a woman
goaltender. I think a picture of
her slashing one of their forwards
made the ASU paper."
The team will also miss veteran
tough-guys Sean Morrison and
Shawn Sarbacker. "They weren't
goons, but they knew how to rough
the other team up a bit," said
returning senior GeofT Garrison,
who has become infamous for his
physical play and unforgiving hip
check up and down the West Coast.

Stanford will host UCLA for its
season-opener this Friday at the
Ice Oasis in Redwood City at 7:00
p.m. Saturday evening at 7:40
p.m., the Cardinal will take on
USC, again at home.
"They should be two close
matched games, so I hope we'll
get some fans out," said winger
Mintak Joo. "Hockey is a fast
paced, exciting sport, and its pop
ularity is growing exponentially
in the Bay Area. Hopefully we can
capitalize on that by drawing both
members of the Stanford commu
nity and Bay Area residents to our
games this year."
In fact, Stanford has a greatly
intensified schedule this season, a
situation assistant coach Eric
Isreal attributes to the team's
past performance. "We're the
champions. Everyone wants to
play us," he said. "We want to use
the intensive schedule to build a
high-caliber, competitive team,
have fun and entertain the fans
while we're doing it."
