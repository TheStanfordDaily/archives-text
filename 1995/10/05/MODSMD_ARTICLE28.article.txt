# On the Cusp of Oblivion
## "The Late Paintings"- a worthy tribute to a master painter? 
### Kristie Lu Stout 
It's an arresting image. And it hangs outside
the exhibit halls.
Before setting foot into the display rooms,
visitors at the SFMOMA's latest show are as
saulted by a peculiar vision ... a hyper-en
larged black-and-white photo of an aged
Willem de Kooning in his Hast Hampton stu
dio. His hair — a shock of Warhol white. His
minuscule eyes, obscured by meaty black
frames, deliver an ambiguous stare. His
mouth, lazily left open, displays the vulnerabil
ity of a man caught off guard by a trespassing
photographer.
Or, perhaps, it displays the vulnerability of
a man confused, uncertain and unable.
In 1989, Willem de Kooning was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease.
Ethereal inventions
"Willem de Kooning: The Late Paintings,
The 1980s," now on display at the San I-'rancis
co Museum of Modern Art, is the first exhibi
tion of the artist's last decade ot work. During
this decade, the decade immediately prior to
his diagnosis, de Kooning abandoned the den
sity and complexity that had established him
as one of the pioneers of Abstract Expression
ism.
During the 1980s, de Kooning rejected the
layered complexity that was characteristic ot
his previous work for an increasingly bare
palette and a playfully light lyricism reminis
cent of that of the late I lenri Matisse. His dense
and edgy strokes, and rich spectrum ol color
that marked his works from the mid-'7os, was
soon replaced by an artistic repertoire of spare
color application and ethereal forms.
Sauntering through the chronologically
organized exhibit halls, museum visitors can
witness this gradual unfolding (or, perhaps, a

disease-induced degeneration) ot de Koon
ing's artistic vision.
The first room, showcasing a cluster of
paintings created in 1981, reveals the late de
Kooning as an artist who relishes coats of paste
and hard-edged implements. However,
glimpses into the other rooms reveal a de
Kooning who has rejected sparkling paste in
favor of delicate brushtrokes. As exhibited by
the 1984-1985 collection of paintings, de
Kooning's works have gradually transformed
into simple inventions that seem delicately
massaged into being. In the final chamber, the
"I have to change to
stay the same/'
-Willem de Kooning
1986-1987 collection, the initial hard-edged
and heavily impastoed quality of his work has
been totally reduced to a sort of fluid minimal
ism.
si MOM A < hief (Curator CiaryGarrels pur
posefully engineered the chronologically in
fluenced classification of de Kooning's works
to emphasize the distinct style and sensibility
of each hall of paintings.
"This show is just the tip of the iceberg,"
said Ciarrels. "There are only 35 paintings.
What I wanted to do is to make an ensemble of
paintings — groupings ot paintings that com
municate with each other and display the di
versity of his work."
The result of his year-by-year analysis of
de Kooning's late works is, as Ciarrels puts it,
"a tribute celebrating the creative human
spirit and brings understanding of de Koon
ing not only as a pioneer of abstract expres

sionism but also as one of the great painters
of the 2()tli century."
Generative or degenerate?
Besides punctuating the end of a great
painter's 60-year career, the exhibition also
strikes a chime of controversy. It spurs one to
question the merit of the 35 works presented.
Is it a collection that commemorates the cu
mulative genius of a master painter? Or, rather,
does it chronicle an incapacitated man's empty
musings? 1 Respite the predictable decline of an
artist who has lived as long as de Kooning and
despite his diagnosis, the SFMOMA maintains
that The Late Paintings are not the result of
mental oblivion.
Ironically affixed next to the black and
white photo of an ostensibly confused de
Kooning is a message that attempts to eclipse
the possible impact of Alzheimer's upon the
artist's genius:
"The issues of Alzheimer's disease and the
creative process arc complex and not well un
derstood, and the aim of this exhibition is not
to attempt a diagnostic analysis of the effects of
this illness as manifested in this paintings. The
larger issues of style in the late work of an artist
who has continued working into a very ad
vanced age, from Titian to Matisse to Picasso,
are equally as relevant and complex."
While the curator makes a benign compar
ison between de Kooning and other ripened
masters in order to dodge the issue of de Koon
ing's possiblyailingcreative mind, museum di
rector John Lane goes so far as to declare that
the exhibition depicts "an artist who is in full
command of his creative faculties."
Art historian Karen Wilkinu disagrees, as

evidenced by her comment in the San Jose
Mercury News:
"The paintings of the 1980s, when he was so
ill and by all reports debilitated, are like the
ghosts of what he was capable of when he was
as good as anybody," she said. "It is clear there
was a lessening of intensity, of impact, of in
ventiveness long before the '80s."
It is difficult to assess if de Koonings mean
dering curves are the confident strokes ot a
master painter or the loopy ga-ga streaks ot an
expired has-been. Like a Rorschach test, "The
Late Paintings" is a compelling sensory trigger
that will elicit varying reactions.
It's a tribute. It's a farewell party. It may even
be a psychological freak show.

master painter or the loopy ga-ga streaks ot an

Late Paintings" is a compelling sensory trigger
that will elicit varying reactions.
It's a tribute. It's a farewell party. It may even
be a psychological freak show.

It's an arresting image. And it hangs outside
the exhibit halls.
Before setting foot into the display rooms,
visitors at the SFMOMA's latest show are as
saulted by a peculiar vision ... a hyper-en
larged black-and-white photo of an aged
Willem de Kooning in his Hast Hampton stu
dio. His hair — a shock of Warhol white. His
minuscule eyes, obscured by meaty black
frames, deliver an ambiguous stare. His
mouth, lazily left open, displays the vulnerabil
ity of a man caught off guard by a trespassing
photographer.
Or, perhaps, it displays the vulnerability of
a man confused, uncertain and unable.
In 1989, Willem de Kooning was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease.
Ethereal inventions
"Willem de Kooning: The Late Paintings,
The 1980s," now on display at the San I-'rancis
co Museum of Modern Art, is the first exhibi
tion of the artist's last decade ot work. During
this decade, the decade immediately prior to
his diagnosis, de Kooning abandoned the den
sity and complexity that had established him
as one of the pioneers of Abstract Expression
ism.
During the 1980s, de Kooning rejected the
layered complexity that was characteristic ot
his previous work for an increasingly bare
palette and a playfully light lyricism reminis
cent of that of the late I lenri Matisse. His dense
and edgy strokes, and rich spectrum ol color
that marked his works from the mid-'7os, was
soon replaced by an artistic repertoire of spare
color application and ethereal forms.
Sauntering through the chronologically
organized exhibit halls, museum visitors can
witness this gradual unfolding (or, perhaps, a

disease-induced degeneration) ot de Koon
ing's artistic vision.
The first room, showcasing a cluster of
paintings created in 1981, reveals the late de
Kooning as an artist who relishes coats of paste
and hard-edged implements. However,
glimpses into the other rooms reveal a de
Kooning who has rejected sparkling paste in
favor of delicate brushtrokes. As exhibited by
the 1984-1985 collection of paintings, de
Kooning's works have gradually transformed
into simple inventions that seem delicately
massaged into being. In the final chamber, the
"I have to change to
stay the same/'
-Willem de Kooning
1986-1987 collection, the initial hard-edged
and heavily impastoed quality of his work has
been totally reduced to a sort of fluid minimal
ism.
si MOM A < hief (Curator CiaryGarrels pur
posefully engineered the chronologically in
fluenced classification of de Kooning's works
to emphasize the distinct style and sensibility
of each hall of paintings.
"This show is just the tip of the iceberg,"
said Ciarrels. "There are only 35 paintings.
What I wanted to do is to make an ensemble of
paintings — groupings ot paintings that com
municate with each other and display the di
versity of his work."
The result of his year-by-year analysis of
de Kooning's late works is, as Ciarrels puts it,
"a tribute celebrating the creative human
spirit and brings understanding of de Koon
ing not only as a pioneer of abstract expres

sionism but also as one of the great painters
of the 2()tli century."
Generative or degenerate?
Besides punctuating the end of a great
painter's 60-year career, the exhibition also
strikes a chime of controversy. It spurs one to
question the merit of the 35 works presented.
Is it a collection that commemorates the cu
mulative genius of a master painter? Or, rather,
does it chronicle an incapacitated man's empty
musings? 1 Respite the predictable decline of an
artist who has lived as long as de Kooning and
despite his diagnosis, the SFMOMA maintains
that The Late Paintings are not the result of
mental oblivion.
Ironically affixed next to the black and
white photo of an ostensibly confused de
Kooning is a message that attempts to eclipse
the possible impact of Alzheimer's upon the
artist's genius:
"The issues of Alzheimer's disease and the
creative process arc complex and not well un
derstood, and the aim of this exhibition is not
to attempt a diagnostic analysis of the effects of
this illness as manifested in this paintings. The
larger issues of style in the late work of an artist
who has continued working into a very ad
vanced age, from Titian to Matisse to Picasso,
are equally as relevant and complex."
While the curator makes a benign compar
ison between de Kooning and other ripened
masters in order to dodge the issue of de Koon
ing's possiblyailingcreative mind, museum di
rector John Lane goes so far as to declare that
the exhibition depicts "an artist who is in full
command of his creative faculties."
Art historian Karen Wilkinu disagrees, as

evidenced by her comment in the San Jose
Mercury News:
"The paintings of the 1980s, when he was so
ill and by all reports debilitated, are like the
ghosts of what he was capable of when he was
as good as anybody," she said. "It is clear there
was a lessening of intensity, of impact, of in
ventiveness long before the '80s."
