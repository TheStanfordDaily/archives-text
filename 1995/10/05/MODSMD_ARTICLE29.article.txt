# A 						Mystically Delicious Dining Experience
## Health and taste mix well at the new Mystic Cafe Focus on: Mystic Café 
### Alice Feng Katie Beman 
Touting the slogan "Healthy Food for
Body and Spirit," the Mystic Cafe has created
an alternative approach to the dining experi
ence. The new dining establishment replaced
Theo's Seafood Restaurant this summer.
Having firmly established the basics of a
good restaurant — excellent food, attentive
service and a soothing atmosphere — its un
usual perspective only enhances the estab
lishment, adding flavor and creativity to the
dishes as well as to the surroundings.
Upon entering the restaurant, one is
struck by the spaciousness of the dining
room. The tables are placed far apart from
each other and form a half-circle around an
attractive mirrored bar. Large picture win
dows line the front of the room, creating even

more of a sense of openness. The room is
filled with earthy tones: wood paneling along
the walls, plants in several different areas,
wicker chairs and stools and even green and
yellow napkins to complement the theme.
Walls are decorated with various ethnic and
colorful artworks, including sculptures, ta
pestries and masks. Similar paintings are lac
quered onto the tables, adding to the am
biance. Most enchanting is the ceiling, made
of the same paneled wood as the walls, yet in
triguingly three-dimensional — it is wavy in
stead of flat. The dining area is well-lit by soft
lamps in addition to candles on the tables.
Although the menu has a distinct Asian
influence, it is extremely diverse, offering a
variety of ingredients and ethnic flavorings.
Amazingly, all the dishes are oil-free with no
compromise on taste. Immediately upon
seating, a plate of hot, crusty sourdough
bread arrives, with .1 creamy garlic spread on
the side. Appetizers range from $5 to $8, and
include tropical mango and beet salad,
steamed clams and Don't Call Me Caesar
Salad, which, we were warned, is not a typical
Caesar salad, but even without classic ingre
dients such as eggs, oil or anchovies, the salad
was still packed with flavor. Fresh, crispy let
tuce and crunchv croutons were dressed with

a slightly tart, slightly sweet combination of
lemon juice and spices with peanut-ginger
topping.
The down-to-earth dressed waitress offers
us a menu with main dishes that include
seafood, chicken and vegetarian entrees.
Seafood items are mostly priced around $15
and include gingered Chilean sea bass,
shrimp and smoked salmon pasta and
brandy-flamed prawns, which arrive in an
Italian tomato-cream sauce reminiscent of
cioppino. The prawns come with a spectacu
lar brown rice pilaf, which combined the
unique texture and nutty flavor of brown rice
with red and yellow peppers and green
onions. Also included is a side of rather bland
steamed vegetables. Vegetarian dishes arc less
costly, generally priced at $9, but are equally
appealing: char-broiled polenta with toma
toes and mushrooms and North African veg
etable couscous. Delicious tofu gingeraki
comes with brown rice pilaf and contains
tofu and a colorful medley of fresh squash,
zucchini, carrots, tomatoes, green beans,
broccoli, mushrooms and red onions with a
thick, mildly spicy ginger sauce.
Desserts, all low in fat and priced at $3 to
$4, include raspberry layer cake, sorbet and
chocolate layer cake. Unfortunately, the an

gelic cake with strawberry mousse sounded
better than it tasted. Although the angel food
cake is tender and sweet, the strawberry
mousse has the distinct flavor of a strawberry
banana smoothie and is more of a sauce than
a true mousse. Of course, no dinner would be
complete without a cafe mocha to top it off.
The coffee arrives at a perfect temperature
and contains well-roasted coffee and just the
right amount of chocolate.
The Mystic Cafe is a unique dining experi
ence which holds true to its slogan: healthy,
delicious food which delights both body and
soul.
