# Support for Casper
## President's statement well received 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Despite the controversial nature of af
firmative action, many faculty and stu
dents said they strongly support Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper's firm en
dorsement of the policy.
In a speech released yesterday, Casper
reaffirmed Stanford's commitment to di
versity in undergraduate admissions. He
called the policy a continuation of Jane
Stanford's commitment to resisting social
stratification. In an unequal world, Casper
said, measures must be taken to redress
discrimination.
Gordon Chang, professor of history,
said he was pleased with Casper's stance
on such a difficult issue.
"I thought it was a very positive state
ment," Chang said. "I understand it was
not an easy statement to make given the
questioning and the hostility toward affir
mative action in society."
History Prof. Albert Camarillo also
praised Casper's speech.
"The speech was a well-reasoned, his
torically situated assessment of the impor-

tance of the policy of affir
mative action," he said.
"He cast affirmative ac
tion in the broader con
text of the creed of equal
opportunity in American
society and tied that to
what the founders of the
University had in mind
for Stanford in the fu
ture.

"I think he brings historical signifi
cance to bear on the continuing need for
programs of opportunity," Camarillo
added.
Casper's speech reaffirmed the current
undergraduate admissions policy, said
James Montoya, dean of admissions and fi
nancial aid.
"It is consistent with current practices
related to how we select the students," he
said. "1 was particularly pleased that his
statement pointed out that there are no re
strictive quotas of any kind."
Student political leaders had mixed re
actions to Casper's speech.


Montoya
"We arc disappointed," said
Stanford Review Editor in Chief
Boh Schmidt. "This is a renewal
of Stanford's commitment to
treating students according to the
color of their skin. My real dispute
with the statement is based on
feeling that Stanford prefers poli
cies justified by intent rather than
by consequences."
Julie Johnson, president of t he
Stanford College Republicans,
agreed, adding that affirmative
action policies are counter pro
ductive in recruiting talented stu
dents.
"I don't believe that race is a
legitimate factor when choosing
between two qualified people,"
Johnson said. "Skin color is not a
talent. The gene for darker skin
does not enhance your contribu
tion to Stanford. There are posi
tive things that have to do with
cultural background, but they
should appear in the rest of the
application."
The best way to fight racism,
Johnson added, is by rejecting the
"race-conscious" attitude of affir

mative action.
"Stanford is unique in its
power to influence society," -John
son said. "This is a wonderful uni
versity and we should put [its
prestige) to good use. The best
way to do justice to the Founders
is by taking a stand against divi
sive affirmative action policies."
However, other leaders said
they were pleased by Casper's
speech.
"It was a wise decision," said
sophomore Bill Shen, chair of
the Stanford Democrats. "The
Stanford tradition of excellence
through diversity will contin
ue."
"We had expected that Presi
dent Casper would support cur
rent I Iniversity affirmative-action
policies in contrast to the Univer
sity of California's collapse on
their admissions policy," he
added. "This is due to the admin
istration's independence from
political pandering and presiden
tial aspirations."
In addition, members of the
Council of Presidents said they
supported Casper's stance.
"We wholeheartedly support
President Casper's commitment
to Stanford's affirmative action
policy," said COP member

Michael Choo. "We believe
strongly about issues of accessibil
ity and equity in higher educa
tion."
Some disagreed with Casper on
his affirmation of only targeting
African Americans,
Chicanos / Latinos and Native
Americans — but not Asian
Americans — in affirmative
action policies.
"1 would caution anyone from
believing the Asian-American
model-minority myth," Shen said.
"I am proud as an Asian American
that as a community, we 'succeed'
in higher education, but there is
still a lot of ground to be made up,
especially in terms of the work
place, in terms of pay equity, in
terms of promotion and in terms
of the percentage of management
posit ions held."
Chang, however, disagreed.
"I have no problem with the
policy as the University practices
it now," lie said. "There are times
when the term Asian American is
used too loosely and used to the
disadvantage of certain people
who fall under that rubric . . . but
I think it is a problem that we
need to work out within the
boundaries of what we now call
affirmative action."

versity and we should put [its
prestige) to good use. The best
way to do justice to the Founders
is by taking a stand against divi
sive affirmative action policies."
However, other leaders said
they were pleased by Casper's
speech.
"It was a wise decision," said
sophomore Bill Shen, chair of
the Stanford Democrats. "The
Stanford tradition of excellence
through diversity will contin
ue."
"We had expected that Presi
dent Casper would support cur
rent I Iniversity affirmative-action
policies in contrast to the Univer
sity of California's collapse on
their admissions policy," he
added. "This is due to the admin
istration's independence from
political pandering and presiden
tial aspirations."
In addition, members of the
Council of Presidents said they
supported Casper's stance.
"We wholeheartedly support
President Casper's commitment
to Stanford's affirmative action
policy," said COP member

Michael Choo. "We believe
strongly about issues of accessibil
ity and equity in higher educa
tion."
Some disagreed with Casper on
his affirmation of only targeting
African Americans,
Chicanos / Latinos and Native
Americans — but not Asian
Americans — in affirmative
action policies.
"1 would caution anyone from
believing the Asian-American
model-minority myth," Shen said.
"I am proud as an Asian American
that as a community, we 'succeed'
in higher education, but there is
still a lot of ground to be made up,
especially in terms of the work
place, in terms of pay equity, in
terms of promotion and in terms
of the percentage of management
posit ions held."
Chang, however, disagreed.
"I have no problem with the
policy as the University practices
it now," lie said. "There are times
when the term Asian American is
used too loosely and used to the
disadvantage of certain people
who fall under that rubric . . . but
I think it is a problem that we
need to work out within the
boundaries of what we now call
affirmative action."
