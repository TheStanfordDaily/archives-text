# Support for Casper
## President's statement well received 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Despite the controversial nature of af
firmative action, many faculty and stu
dents said they strongly support Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper's firm en
dorsement of the policy.
In a speech released yesterday, Casper
reaffirmed Stanford's commitment to di
versity in undergraduate admissions. He
called the policy a continuation of Jane
Stanford's commitment to resisting social
stratification. In an unequal world, Casper
said, measures must be taken to redress
discrimination.
Gordon Chang, professor of history,
said he was pleased with Casper's stance
on such a difficult issue.
"I thought it was a very positive state
ment," Chang said. "I understand it was
not an easy statement to make given the
questioning and the hostility toward affir
mative action in society."
History Prof. Albert Camarillo also
praised Casper's speech.
"The speech was a well-reasoned, his
torically situated assessment of the impor-

tance of the policy of affir
mative action," he said.
"He cast affirmative ac
tion in the broader con
text of the creed of equal
opportunity in American
society and tied that to
what the founders of the
University had in mind
for Stanford in the fu
ture.

"I think he brings historical signifi
cance to bear on the continuing need for
programs of opportunity," Camarillo
added.
Casper's speech reaffirmed the current
undergraduate admissions policy, said
James Montoya, dean of admissions and fi
nancial aid.
"It is consistent with current practices
related to how we select the students," he
said. "1 was particularly pleased that his
statement pointed out that there are no re
strictive quotas of any kind."
Student political leaders had mixed re
actions to Casper's speech.
