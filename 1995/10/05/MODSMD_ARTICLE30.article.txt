# SF SEALS
## EMERGING FROM SLEEPING SHADOWS 
### STORY BY ARNOLD PAN PHOTO BY SASHA MITELMAN 
Inside the K/Sl' studio beneath Memori
al Auditorium, the SI Seals look like
they're throwing a party in a basement.
Seen from the control room in, the friendly
band seems comfortable in the wood paneled
den, playing for the small gathering there and
the larger one listening to another broadcast
of C N). I's long-running Wednesday Night Live
series.
I he Seals charge into the program with a
palpable energy, one that's clearly heard on
the airwaves even if it isn't viewed. But seeing
is reaffirming and watching singer / band
linchpin Barbara Manning occasionally bop
and bounce to her bass rhythms during the
studio session only underscores the exuber
ant melancholy of the music, 112 lanking Man
ning are guitarist Brently Pusser, who, with
his stubbly bald scalp, resembles the Thing
from the Fantastic Four happily and intently
strumming away, and sleepy, Pete Sampras
looking drummer Ron Burns, tucked away in
a corner between the two. The threesome
runs through a nearly hour-long set of songs
culled from the Seals' two-album catalog and
from Manning's solo projects, combining to
form a collection of zippy yet downcast pop
tunes which cling together despite disparate
themes, sounds and moods.
Although the SF Seals have been a
complete entity for more than two
years now, the K/.SU show is but the
second live performance for the team that now
plays under the name. To date, the group's
only other gig as a trio was in front of a con
siderably larger, con-

siderably tougher
crowd at the Mata
dor Records
showcase for the
CM J alt-rock cir
cus / meat mar
ket last month in
NYC. Until

then, the
live band
was a

quartet, consisting of rotating lineups held to
gether by founding member Manning.
"We pulled it oft," Manning says of the (Ml
show in an interview with the Seals at the cozy
French I fouse dining room after a post-perfor
mance snack. "1 don't think people realized we
were only two weeks practiced to do that.
"I personally would prefer that we adjust to
the song. 'Clause I think that the song rules
and that we are the soldiers to bring forth the
cup that runneth over for the ruler."
The songs which she refers to are the ones
from the Seals' recently released album,
"Truth Walks in Sleepy Shadows," an effort
Manning describes as "complete and full and
perfect the way it is. Indeed, the new FP is an
understated, elegant work, I 1 tracks of folk
tinged pop which work together so well.
Fierce ditties like "Ipecac" and "Pulp" leap
out, anxious cuts about soured relationships
which are punctuated by dispirited lines like
"I can not stomach you /1 drink poison" and
"When you walked out on me / Part of me
wanted to / Walk out on me with you," re
spectively. Slow, smooth numbers like "Bold
Fetters" and the cover of John dale's "Flash
back Caruso" brace the blow of the more en
ergetic pieces; even more calming are the pair
of seafaring anthems, the reverb-drenched
"ladies of the Sea" and the precious "Kid's Pi
rate Ship." Here, the band creates an engross
ing vibe, a soothing wash of Manning's pretty
vocals and Pusser's shimmering waves of gui
tar melody.
"We were familiar with how we wanted it
to sound, and we had all kind of worked out
our own little parts (so

that) everybody was putting in their own lit
tie identity,' Pusser explains. " The drums, the
kiss, the guitar work was all thought out."
While the trio format remains a
difficult challenge for the
hand's members to adjust to,
this version of the Seals may be the most
stable one yet. After bouncing between
playing in a band and going solo, Manning
decided to start her own outfit called the
Tablespoons. Vet when that group started
being billed as Barbara Manning and the
Tablespoons, she changed the band's name
to a team's name, the SI Seals, a moniker
borrowed from the minor league baseball
team with which |oe Dimaggio spent time.
Still, the lineup continued to change, until
Pusser, who balances another full-time
band with Three 1 >ay Stubble, came aboard
as a regular contributor about a year and a
half ago. (Burns, who was a member of
Smog and currently plays in Star Pimp,
joined recently, filling out the current tour
ing band.)
Pusser's involvement in the Seals essential
ly began when Manning asked him to record
the group's first full-length "Nowhere," a
frantic, jittery gem that was released in the
spring of 1994. According to Manning, that
album was made for herself, "a soundtrack for
how I felt, right then and there." Thus, the
lukewarm reviews from critics didn't bother
her, though the "beautiful reactions from
human beings" heartened Manning.
"I felt like I was going through a really
rough time," Manning says of the period be
tween "Nowhere" and"Truth Walks in Sleepy
Shadows." "But I kinda got through to the
other side and felt grateful to be still alive and
have appreciation for the world and have
friends around me. I think th.it sort of wise
ness made me calmer. And I think some of the
songwriting and the way I wanted to produce
(' Truth Walks') shows that. Rather than want
ing to be edgy and manic."

For now, the three are gearing up
for a tour that will keep them on
the road until Thanksgiving. It
seems likely that the Seals will he

more of a team than ever, if only because
learning to be a trio seems a more rigorous,
more dependent effort.

BANDS:
US Saucer
Brently Pusser: They've got Margaret
Murray, who played bass in the Seals, and
Brian Hageman, who plays guitar with
the Thinking Fellers. David Tolleson
sings and plays bass and he's been in
other bands before. And he makes pup
pets and does puppet shows too.
Pulsating Anus Hole
Barbara Manning: They are out. They're
really out. Like Brently was saying,
they're really raw and that's a good way of
putting it. But that's just because they rub
people the wrong way sometimes. I like
them, personally.
RECORD STORES (besides Amoeba
in Berkeley):
Reckless Records
BM: That's where I work. 1 have to say
that.
PLACES:
North Beach
BM: There's lots of neat shops and cheap
places to eat. There's a great coffee shop
called Portofino which is run by the
Mafia. And it's exciting to go in there.
And they have the best cappuccinos.
There are only men in there. They're only
old men and they always look at me
weird when I walk in there. But they
smile at me and I feel okay.... I just sit
there at one of the little tables and they
have a jukebox with all old Italian songs.
Filbert Steps
BM: And while you're there (in North
Beach), 1 suggest you go to Coit Tower.
And then on one edge, you can walk
down these neat old stairs that are com
pletely surrounded by old gardens.
They're called the Filbert Steps. And
that's a really fun place to take a date,
cause you can sit on the steps and make
out.
BP: Yeah, it's really great. That's one of
the coolest places in San Francisco.

Inside the K/Sl' studio beneath Memori
al Auditorium, the SI Seals look like
they're throwing a party in a basement.
Seen from the control room in, the friendly
band seems comfortable in the wood paneled
den, playing for the small gathering there and
the larger one listening to another broadcast
of C N). I's long-running Wednesday Night Live
series.
I he Seals charge into the program with a
palpable energy, one that's clearly heard on
the airwaves even if it isn't viewed. But seeing
is reaffirming and watching singer / band
linchpin Barbara Manning occasionally bop
and bounce to her bass rhythms during the
studio session only underscores the exuber
ant melancholy of the music, 112 lanking Man
ning are guitarist Brently Pusser, who, with
his stubbly bald scalp, resembles the Thing
from the Fantastic Four happily and intently
strumming away, and sleepy, Pete Sampras
looking drummer Ron Burns, tucked away in
a corner between the two. The threesome
runs through a nearly hour-long set of songs
culled from the Seals' two-album catalog and
from Manning's solo projects, combining to
form a collection of zippy yet downcast pop
tunes which cling together despite disparate
themes, sounds and moods.
Although the SF Seals have been a
complete entity for more than two
years now, the K/.SU show is but the
second live performance for the team that now
plays under the name. To date, the group's
only other gig as a trio was in front of a con
siderably larger, con-

siderably tougher
crowd at the Mata
dor Records
showcase for the
CM J alt-rock cir
cus / meat mar
ket last month in
NYC. Until

then, the
live band
was a

quartet, consisting of rotating lineups held to
gether by founding member Manning.
"We pulled it oft," Manning says of the (Ml
show in an interview with the Seals at the cozy
French I fouse dining room after a post-perfor
mance snack. "1 don't think people realized we
were only two weeks practiced to do that.
"I personally would prefer that we adjust to
the song. 'Clause I think that the song rules
and that we are the soldiers to bring forth the
cup that runneth over for the ruler."
The songs which she refers to are the ones
from the Seals' recently released album,
"Truth Walks in Sleepy Shadows," an effort
Manning describes as "complete and full and
perfect the way it is. Indeed, the new FP is an
understated, elegant work, I 1 tracks of folk
tinged pop which work together so well.
Fierce ditties like "Ipecac" and "Pulp" leap
out, anxious cuts about soured relationships
which are punctuated by dispirited lines like
"I can not stomach you /1 drink poison" and
"When you walked out on me / Part of me
wanted to / Walk out on me with you," re
spectively. Slow, smooth numbers like "Bold
Fetters" and the cover of John dale's "Flash
back Caruso" brace the blow of the more en
ergetic pieces; even more calming are the pair
of seafaring anthems, the reverb-drenched
"ladies of the Sea" and the precious "Kid's Pi
rate Ship." Here, the band creates an engross
ing vibe, a soothing wash of Manning's pretty
vocals and Pusser's shimmering waves of gui
tar melody.
"We were familiar with how we wanted it
to sound, and we had all kind of worked out
our own little parts (so

that) everybody was putting in their own lit
tie identity,' Pusser explains. " The drums, the
kiss, the guitar work was all thought out."
While the trio format remains a
difficult challenge for the
hand's members to adjust to,
this version of the Seals may be the most
stable one yet. After bouncing between
playing in a band and going solo, Manning
decided to start her own outfit called the
Tablespoons. Vet when that group started
being billed as Barbara Manning and the
Tablespoons, she changed the band's name
to a team's name, the SI Seals, a moniker
borrowed from the minor league baseball
team with which |oe Dimaggio spent time.
Still, the lineup continued to change, until
Pusser, who balances another full-time
band with Three 1 >ay Stubble, came aboard
as a regular contributor about a year and a
half ago. (Burns, who was a member of
Smog and currently plays in Star Pimp,
joined recently, filling out the current tour
ing band.)
Pusser's involvement in the Seals essential
ly began when Manning asked him to record
the group's first full-length "Nowhere," a
frantic, jittery gem that was released in the
spring of 1994. According to Manning, that
album was made for herself, "a soundtrack for
how I felt, right then and there." Thus, the
lukewarm reviews from critics didn't bother
her, though the "beautiful reactions from
human beings" heartened Manning.
"I felt like I was going through a really
rough time," Manning says of the period be
tween "Nowhere" and"Truth Walks in Sleepy
Shadows." "But I kinda got through to the
other side and felt grateful to be still alive and
have appreciation for the world and have
friends around me. I think th.it sort of wise
ness made me calmer. And I think some of the
songwriting and the way I wanted to produce
(' Truth Walks') shows that. Rather than want
ing to be edgy and manic."

For now, the three are gearing up
for a tour that will keep them on
the road until Thanksgiving. It
seems likely that the Seals will he

BANDS:
US Saucer
Brently Pusser: They've got Margaret
Murray, who played bass in the Seals, and
Brian Hageman, who plays guitar with
the Thinking Fellers. David Tolleson
sings and plays bass and he's been in
other bands before. And he makes pup
pets and does puppet shows too.
Pulsating Anus Hole
Barbara Manning: They are out. They're
really out. Like Brently was saying,
they're really raw and that's a good way of
putting it. But that's just because they rub
people the wrong way sometimes. I like
them, personally.
RECORD STORES (besides Amoeba
in Berkeley):
Reckless Records
BM: That's where I work. 1 have to say
that.
PLACES:
North Beach
BM: There's lots of neat shops and cheap
places to eat. There's a great coffee shop
called Portofino which is run by the
Mafia. And it's exciting to go in there.
And they have the best cappuccinos.
There are only men in there. They're only
old men and they always look at me
weird when I walk in there. But they
smile at me and I feel okay.... I just sit
there at one of the little tables and they
have a jukebox with all old Italian songs.
Filbert Steps
BM: And while you're there (in North
Beach), 1 suggest you go to Coit Tower.
And then on one edge, you can walk
down these neat old stairs that are com
pletely surrounded by old gardens.
They're called the Filbert Steps. And
that's a really fun place to take a date,
