# An Exploration of Native American Art
## 
### Elizabeth Murtagh 
In tlie beginning

Past, present and future are linked in
an infinite cycle of continuity, ac
cording to the spiritual beliefs of
various Native American tribes. The
Stanford Art Gallery is now hosting an ex
hibit that illustrates this philosophy,
which runs like an endless thread through
lineages. It teaches the young about the
ways of the old in the hope that they will
continue the discourse between the histo
ry of their ancestors and the customs of
everyday life.
"Our Art, Our Voices: Native American

Cultural Perspectives," on display from
now until the end of autumn quarter, joins
early 19th-century works from Stanford's
permanent collection with more recent
samples on loan from the families of Na
tivc American Stanford alumni and stu
dents from different tribes. The combina
tion is an exquisite variety of objects illus
trating the role art plays in the process of
remembering and maintaining bonds
with tradition.
Accompanying the pieces on display are
interpretations by Native American Stan
ford alumni and students belonging to vari
ous tribes spanning both coasts and borders
of the United States. The exhibit is therefore
its own expert tour guide, an extremely rare
opportunity to learn about Native American
cultures from those who live it.

Ten different cultures. One tiny gallery.
Nice idea. How will you do it?
She's heard it all a thousand times and
has said, "Just wait and sec," almost as
often. The skeptical advice against dis
playing a dazzling array of colors and
styles in a gallery as small as Stanford's all
sounds quite familiar to Denni Woodward
Assistant Director of the American In
dian Program at Stanford and Guest Cu
rator of the exhibit.
Envisioning a co-mingling of art from
tribes spanning every region of the coun
try is one thing. Materializing it is anoth-

er. Yet like the masters whose works ap
pear to have been created with effortless
grace, Woodward and fellow curator Ruth
Franklin have made Stanford's gallery it
self a work of art.
The project began in Woodward's
youth when her maternal grandmother, a
Mescalero Apache originally from New
Mexico, took her on visits to Bay Area art
museums. Among the most memorable of
their museum experiences together were
trips to exhibitions of Native American
artwork. While impressed by the beauty
and strange familiarity of the works them
selves, Woodward was most surprised at
how often her grandmother pointed out
that the labels describing them were
wrong, l eeling a sudden, uncomfortable
lapse in her taith of "history's" accuracy,
Woodward resolved to pursue the day

when "Indians work in museums, so that
the art of their people may be presented
more accurately and respectfully."
"I lere we are now," she says with a smile
that spills a visible abundance of confident
enthusiasm. "It's finally happening."
Everything is a story
Once in the gallery, brilliant colors in
vite your eyes for a dance, and you ask
yourself, "Where do I start?" It doesn't
matter. Whatever your pattern of wander
ing, each arrangement of regional artwork
introduces you to a people who welcome
your acquaintance.
One of the first objects

that will draw your attention
is a large ceramic jar decorat
ed with a geometrical pattern
and figures of wildlife. Ben
jamin Atencio ('77), the in
terpreter representing the
Santo Domingo Pueblo tribe
of the Southwest, explains
that "the designs are a written
language of the people," por
traying the history and rituals
of Pueblo life.
Even though the jar is
nearly 200 years old, Santo
Domingo Pueblos today
make such jars using the same
process of rolling clay into
coils as their ancestors used
generations ago, rather than
the less difficult method of
using a clay wheel. The jars
are dyed with pigments from
various minerals and vegeta
bles, again showing a con
stant will to preserve the ways
of the past.
Among the exhibit's
most memorable pieces of
jewelry is a necklace of
turquoise beads with three

pendants: a turtle, a hand and a double
barred cross representing the influence of
the Catholic Church.
The presence of European-American
influences is often as strong as the visibili
ty of the indigenous peoples' craft. In the
Southern Mississippi Choctaw tribe, the
traditional cotton dress a woman wears
borrows European styles (cuffs, ruffles
and a long apron) while maintaining de
signs unique to certain communities
within the Choctaw nation.
Stanford senior Powtawche Williams,
for example, has one of her dresses on dis
play, the embroidery of which depicts the
importance of stickball to her family by
including small representations of the
game's objects. A game once played in
order to settle disputes without shedding

blood, stickball is now a sport Choctaws
play at tournaments.
Other garments resemble the tailored
suit-coats and vests common to many Eu
ropean colonists, but like the Choctaw
dresses, the influence of the native cul
ture's craft is just as present to the behold
ing eye.
While it might seem difficult to imag
ine that tobacco lids could be bent to look
like slender bells, this exhibit shows the
delicacy that Native American art can take
on. Looking at the Eastern Woodlands
Chippewa "jingle dress," which, as inter
prcter Margo Kerrigan ('75) describes, is
decorated with rows of 800 cut and curled
Copenhagen snuff cans.
The glance through creative varieties of
native clothing continues with a buck
skin dress dangling with 270 elk teeth
worn at tribal celebrations by Crow
women of the Northern Plains. As the
owner of the dress Lesley Jackson ('B9),
explains, the garment indicates the
revered status her grandfather holds as a
hunter of keen ability. Even more so than
the jingle dress, the elk tooth garment
shows the lasting dedication Native Amer
icans have to respecting everything they
are given, refusing to allow any of what
they have go to waste.
Yet another impressive garment on dis
play is an elaborately adorned puberty rite
regalia once worn by Nicole Stern ('92).
The garment tells the story of a fascinating
tradition practiced by the Mescalero
Apache. As Stern explains, young women,
in the week following their first menses,
undergo several days' worth of strenuous
ceremonies which test their physical en
durance and provide opportunities for the
young women to exhibit their newfound
strength and fertility. As the maturing
woman dances around a ceremonial fire to
the songs ofa medicine man singing about
all the stages in her journey toward worn
anhood, the entire tribe converges in her
honor.
A photo of Stern taken during her own
ceremonies rests adjacent to the garment
she wore, reminding onlookers of the last
ing importance of the tradition to the
Apache people. In fact, the exhibit men
tions that Stern recently helped revive that
same tradition long lost to a tribe of
Apache forcibly removed from their
homelands in the 1800s.
The Navajos, represented in the exhibit
by Anthony Kahn ('B6), arc also a people
who have at times struggled to keep cul
tural creativity from dying in times of ad
versity. When the Navajos were impris
oned by the U. S. government, the sheep
on which they depended for their liveli
hood were slaughtered. The Navajos con
tinued their traditions of weaving in the

only possible way, using yarns and dyes
given to them in prison. The result was a
bold, new style of geometric patterns using
bright colors that stand in rich contrast to
the more subdued hues of their earlier
weaving.
"It's in hard times," Woodward com
mented, "that people do the most noble
things to survive and carry on their culture
.... There is no such thing as the vanishing
Indian. There could be nothing further
from the truth."
Sweat and toil
However content Woodward and
Franklin arc with the final product and the
wide eyes of its first week's visitors, both cu
rators take deep, long-awaited sighs of re
lief when asked about the stages of the ex
hibit's creation.
The process of designing the exhibit
began about three years ago when, aware of
the rich collection of indigenous art ac
quired by Jane Stanford and others in the
University's past, Woodward approached
Thomas Seligman, director of the Stanford
Museum of Art, with the idea of hosting an
art exhibit in conjunction with the 1995
celebration of the Stanford American Indi
an Organization's 25th anniversary.

Seligman agreed with Wood
ward's feeling that "there has not
been a lot of understanding
about how art can be involved in
people's lives," especially in those
of Native Americans.
Franklin, the curator who
procured the grant from the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts
that provided most of the funds
for the realization of Wood
ward's vision, concurred. The
grant's funds, which covered ex
penses related to increasing the
use of specimens in Stanford's
under-utilized permanent col
lection, allowed Franklin and
Woodward to search for works in
other areas of the country that
would complement the strengths
of the works already here.
"Our goal was to make the
collection more accessible,"

Franklin says, "while taking ad
vantage of shared interests anywhere we
might find them. We want to work with
students and members of the Native Amer
ican community here who are interested in
invigorating their past."
Their search for collaboration eventual
ly led them to the 10 Stanford alumni and

students whose insightful commentary and
contribution of specimens add rare au
thenticity to the broad, yet intricately de
tailed portrait of the wide array of lifestyles
Native American members of Stanford's
past and present continue to lead.
In anticipation of the eventual reopen
ing of the Stanford Museum of Art, closed

for earthquake
repair since the
I.oma I J ric t a
quake of 1989,
Franklin is al
ready planning
for the future.
This exhibit,
she says "will
very much
shape the way
the permanent
collection will
be installed"
when the mu
seum reopens
to the public.
I-sli i r t s
anil tennis
sliocs
The entire ex
hibit success
fully shows the
importance of
art in the lives
of Native
Americans.
What are ex
quisite works
of art for out
siders are also

instruments of daily living for the peoples
whose cultures they reflect.
Williams remarks that seeing her dress,
moccasins, purse and harvesting baskets in
display cases for the first time was a bizarre
experience. "To me," she says,"it looks like
my t-shirt and tennis shoes are on display.
That's our living culture."
Seeing the looks in the eyes of visitors
making their first acquaintance with her
people's way of life has given Williams a
fresh perspective on her culture. "Looking
at people's reactions, I can really appreciate
the beauty of our way of life," she says.
In addition to learning more about her
own community, Williams has broadened
her knowledge of cultures she has rarely
had the opportunity to interact with until
coming to Stanford. She says she thinks of
"Our Art, Our Voices" as an exciting edu
cational opportunity that marks the begin
ning of what she and other Native Ameri
can peers hope will become an ongoing
"symposium ot Indian cultures."
Woodward agreed that the exhibit of
fers a welcome revision of sadly ignored
annals.
"We're up against a lot ot negative infor
mation," she says. "Not only is there often
nothing in school books, there are John
Wayne movies and other things that are
often wrong and disrespectful."
While much of the past ot Native Amer
icans has been little more than a whisper,
this exhibit sings of their cultures with
deep vibrato. Their art invites you into the
living rooms of people lull of eagerness to
follow the advice given by Stanford artist
Nathan Oliveira: "We must enter the 21st
century on the wings of our intelligence
and our concern for civilization."
