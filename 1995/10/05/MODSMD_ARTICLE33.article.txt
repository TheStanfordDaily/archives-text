# SONIC YOUTH
## Washing Machine 
### 
After spending most of the "90s in a hit of
.1 sonic slump. Sonic Youth have returned to
prime form with "Washing Machine." Their
most impressive work since "Daydream Na
tion," their I Ith album shows a slower, more
thoughtful Youth, straying from the more
straightforward rock sounds of "Goo" and
"Dirty" and unleashing a smoother hut still
explosive energy.
"Becuz" starts the album like a tranquil
ized and forlorn version of Sheena 1 aston's
"Strut," and in this case, that's a good thing
Kim ( Gordon rasps slowly but tensely over de
liberate guitar grooves and subtle experi
mentation. It's uncharacteristically mellow
tor Sonic Youth, but Gordon's vocals an
occasional trouble spot, particularly on
"Dirty" — are better than ever, and she pulls
it off with a strained grace.
"Unwind" and "Saucer like" are two more
ballad like excursions, with the band spicing
up its slow grooves with guitar effects, noise
and improvisation.
The title track picks up the pace with lay
ered, angular ritfage and (iordon's sharp
grunt shouts of "All right now!" Ihe song
unfolds into a nine minute rock epic, full of
tight guitar dynamics and (iordon's semi
mystical poetry.
"I.ittle Trouble (iirl" is by far the silliest
song on the album, complete with over
enunciated nursery rhyme like verses cour
tesy of guest vocalist Kim Deal. Hummableas
it is, the song lacks the edge of the rest of the
album, but the next two songs more than
pick up the slack; "No Queen Blues" and
"Panty I ies"are two of the finer rock songs of
the last year. The Thurston Moore-led "No
Queen Blues" sets a richly textured groove
that's interrupted by a momentary jolt of a
chorus before plunging freely and deeply
back into the original groove. Next, "Panty
Lies" recalls the shower scene from "Psycho,"
with Gordon (again) grunting with more
feeling and repetition than you or 1 could
ever understand. Thanks to some weird tun
ings and inventive musicianship, the song

comes off surprisingly well, building mo
mentum, intensity and intrigue with each
successive heave.
Ultimately, the album winds down to its
brilliant, self-indulgent closer "The Dia
mond Sea." II it were just l(i minutes shorter,
this could be the group's most accessible
radio song ever, but .is it stands, it's a great,
shimmering pop journey that piles on layers
of symbolism, a touch of cliche and occa
sional ( hewbacca-like noise bursts. Alto
gether, it's a fascinating conclusion to a fasci
nating record, a clear indication that Sonic
Youth are still at the top of their game after all
these years.
