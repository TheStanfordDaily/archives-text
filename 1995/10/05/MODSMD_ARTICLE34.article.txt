# G. LOVE AND SPECIAL SAUCE
## Coast to Coast Motel 
### 
faltering and deceptively unsure, the
sophomore effort from hip-hop hucksters (1.
I ove and Special Sauce slips by like slight of
hand. Nearly invisible to the naked eye, nearly
imperceptible to the lulled ear, is the music's
severe restraint, its near-savage commitment
towards technique. These songs seem inno
cent, bumbling, imperfect displays of down
home funky frivolity. What is so easy to miss,
amid simple-minded lyricism and 10-fi hyste
ria, is how incredibly fit they are. Not an ounce
of fatty self indulgence to be sheared. "Coast

to Coast Motel," like their eponymous debut
album, relies on bare necessities, a groove
laden mumble of bass laid under lazy, twang
ing guitar, and a gentle, unobtrusive drum
wandering somewhere behind.
What gives the musk its si/e, its robust
sense of play, is (i. Love's persona, his un
apologetic pouty croon, that voice that
sounds crowded by marbles .1 man to
whom "I like Soda Pop / I like cough
drop / like chicken lo mem on the main dish
is a sentiment worth) for public perusal. The
cover art says it all: G. Love as a latter-day
1 lvis, bursting from the sides ot the painting,
a larger than life icon in yellow and pea green.
Last year's debut had the savvy to link mu
sical styles, the old with the new, and in the
ecstatic thrill ot songs like "('old Beverage
and "Garbage Man," (i. I ove and Co. found
their payoff, but "(oast to Coast" is a more
delicate album. Nearly abandoning the con
temporary heft of hip hop, these songs gear
up by imperceptible increments and then
they roll over and die a sweet, backwards
looking death. The st rains ot jug band blues,
Dylanesque folk and backyard rockabilly
prove that Ci. Love is an element from anoth
er bygone era, sometime beyond retro.
I he album's not without a sense ot experi
mentation. The risky shoebox acoustic plink
plink of "doming Home" and "Everybody"
pay off in lull, but the kitschy funk core ot
"Small I ish" comes off antiseptic. He's work
ing too hard at it, and you can hear the strain.
Mostly, though, the songs work. "Some
times" and especially "Chains #3" shuttle
along with that brilliance that comes with G.
Love's disarming sincerity. The deception lies
m the music's tendency to fall in the back
ground. It is atmosphere ot the best kind
hat trick groove that's got nothing to hide yet
you hardly see working.
