# THE
						BOO RADLEYS
## Wake Up! 
### 
With their latest album "Wake Up!" Brit
popsters the 800 Radleys make a hold state
ment, though they might he decrying the
wrong one. On the heels of the dandy 1993
LP "Giant Steps," "Wake Up!" stands among
the most disappointing albums of 1995, a
work th.it sounds like the band decided to
live its collective dreams of rock stardom by
proving it was a group great enough to he a
mediocre one. So where the Boos' canny mix
of eclectic innovation and la-la craft on
"Giant Steps" spoke volumes ol the quartet's
potential brilliance, the formula falls apart
on the new effort — a collection of sheen,
lean hits that lacks both the creativity and
charm of the preceding disc.
While the new equation has brought the
band chart-topping success at home, the
Boos' Beatlesy pop schlock seems out of
place, especially beside the recycled '70s
punk and '70s boogie rock which pop-pol
lute American alternative rock radio. On
rollercoasting "Joel," the usually smooth
voiced singer Sice admits as much, screech
ing, "All 1 want is harmony / l ike some out
moded sixties throwback." Indeed, "out
moded sixties throwback" gets to the point
most succinctly, as the band rarelv balances

its own voice with the echoes from the past
convincingly.
"Charles Bukowski Is Dead is a lame
rave-up of "Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da" that degen
erates into canned self-help with a refrain of
"You'll never touch the magic it you don't
reach out tar enough. Which is as close to a
recurring theme as there is on "Wake Up!,"
the coupling of familiar rifting and cheese
hall preaching. F.ven the album's best tunes
— the energetic "It's I.ulu" and the in
escapably sing-songy "Find ihe Answer
Within" — get bogged down, with hack
neyed choruses of "I I S I I I U, she's dancing
close to the flame / You better remember her
name" and "Do you wanna join the race, can
you keep the pace / Or stay and take your
chances" respectively. That's where the Boos
trip up, forgetting that catchy doesn't have to
be kitschy and that inspiration is as often
found between the lyrics as it is within them.
