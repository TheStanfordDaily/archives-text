## Clouds Taste Metallic 
### 
Inside the CD insert to the Flaming Lips'
newest release "Clouds Taste Metallic,"
amidst the pictures of trench tries and
ketchup, dead beetles and hand photos, are
orange words scrawled nearly invisibly, say
ing on one page "Thanks to everyone for
likin' us... Anil everyone who helps us..
and on the back cover, "These clouds are
real."
That just about sums it up for the 112 lam
ing I.ips. On the one hand, they are an unas
suming, friendly and very real band from
Oklahoma City. On the other, they are
somewhat amorphous entities floating
freely in the sky; somehow they are tied to
this earth, but 1 swear to God they are not a
part of it.
"Clouds Taste Metallic" starts off with
the sound of a movie projector whirling in
the background making us ask if this will be
real or make-believe. But when Wayne
Coyne's high-pitched, everyman croon
starts, there is no doubt this is real â€” full of
passion, spacious and real. The whole
album progresses wildly, alternating be
tween sweet melodies and swirling, distant,
distorted guitars.
