## PALACE Mountain PALACE MUSIC Viva Last Blues 
### 
I irst it was the Palace Brothers, then
came an EP by Palace Songs. Now we have
an I P by Palace and a new full-length from
Palace Music — and the Palace Band is
going on tour. Whatever the name, the
Palace thing has always revolved around
Will Oldham and his acoustic guitar, and
he's still making beautiful music.

The "Mountain" HP, by Palace, features
four of Oldham's finest songs to date. It be
gins with his personal declaration, "If I
could fuck a mountain / Lord, I would fuck
a mountain." Whether expressing sexual
ambition, love of nature or maybe just a
need for something stable, these words are
strangely heartfelt, and the honesty with
which they're delivered overcomes any de
sire you might have to snicker.
"Gulf Shores" is a typical Palace folky
number, but the song is so well written that
it avoids any feel of cliche. The highlight of
this HP, though, is "West Palm Beach," in
which Oldham chronicles all the little
bummers that got him down while in Flori
da. I lis woes start with "I can't get the sand
out of my shoes' and drift to the touching
"Breakfast again / delayed, postponed / I
won't be fed." The song sounds as fresh as
Oldham sounds tattered, and the overall
effect is just about perfect.
A month and a name change later comes
"Viva l ast Blues" from Palace Music. The
album was recorded in Alabama by Shellac
leader and big-name noisy producer Steve
Albini, and it features Sebadoh's Jason
I oewenstein on drums. Albini's presence is
most apparent on "C at's Blues," a rare
Palace rocker with surges of electric guitar
noise over Oldham's quick folky rambling.
But never does W ill get as riled up as he
does on "Work Hard / Play Hard." Here,
his voice strains and cracks with an un
characteristic aggression as he alternates
his sweet warbled patches with explosive
choruses.
The rest of the album pretty much sticks
to the reliable Palace formula, delivering
loads of quality folk, generally backed with
acoustic guitar and drums with an occa
sional organ or slide guitar chiming in.
"Viva I ast Blues" doesn't quite match the
magic of the "Mountain" EP, but it does
further establish Oldham as one of the
finer songwriters of the last decade.
