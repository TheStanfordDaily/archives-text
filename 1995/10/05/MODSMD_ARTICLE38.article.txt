# SHANE MACGOWAN AND THE POPES
## The 						Snake 
### 
Ex-Pogue Shane MacGowan is back, ine
briated and lovable as ever. MacGowan is the
ultimate drunk philosopher, homely and
charming, obscene and insightful. Along
with his new band, the Popes (coincidence?),
Mac( iowan offers "The Snake" as his first re

lease since he and the Pogues, uh, went their
separate ways.
"The Snake" is not on par with such
Pogues classics as "Rum, Sodomy and the
Lash" and "If I Should Fall from Grace with
God," but it is almost impossible to ignore
the nearly infectious effects of MacGowan's
incoherence. With this release it becomes ob
vious that Mac(lowan was the unstable, artis
tic entity that drove the Pogues.
1 lis flat singing is full of raw, human emo
tion and liis lyrics are somehow able to ex
plore the seedy and tender at the same time,
though the\ usually tend towards the seedy.
In the catchy jig, "Donegal Express," Mac-
Gowan sings just a little too convincingly,
"Kahaya! You fuck! / ( ome hell or high water
/1 might have fucked your Mrs. / But I never
fucked your daughter." You have to respect
the honesty. Thinking about some skinny,
toothless, cirrhosis-ridden man defending
himseli against such allegations is more than
enough to make you smile and shake your
head.
While MacGowan is still Irish through
and through, the Popes do not offer the C leltic
authenticity that the Pogues (.lid. The music
tends to a harder driving rock sound, tinted
as always with traditional Irish arrange
ments. If it weren't for MacGowan's grated
and slurred voice, songs like "That Woman's
Got Me Drinking'' or "Victoria" (with the
chorus "Victoria, left me in opium euphoria /
with a fat monk singing 'Gloria' / My girl
with green eyes") would be straightforward
rock songs. And when they attempt the tradi
tional arrangements — on "Nancy Whiskey"
and "Roddy McGorley" — the Popes lack the
animation and vitality of the Pogues.
Nonetheless, MacGowan manages to
make "The Snake" an excellent start to his
(essentially) solo career. Where the Pogues,
who persist without MacGowan, have tight
arrangements and technical superiority,
MacGowan has charisma, allure and vision.
What else could he ask for? Well, maybe some
teeth....
