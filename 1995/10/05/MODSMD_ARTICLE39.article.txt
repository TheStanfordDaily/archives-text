## Devil in a Blue Dress 
### 
Cirl Franklin's new film, "Devil in a Blue Dress," is a smooth, hard
boiled, private-dick flick that pulls you in like a con-man fast talks a sucker.
I )enzel Washington plays the quick thinking I asy Rawlins as lie struggles
heroically in a high stakes game of cat and mouse (yup, its a Hollywood
movie).
It's 1948 in Compton, a quiet, tree-lined I.os Angeles neighborhood for
African Americans moving west after World War 11. Rawlins, a straight
laced working man, becomes the unwitting centerpiece in a political elec
tion replete with thousand-dollar letters, well-polished gangsterism and a
disappearing fiancee (Jennifer Beales of "Hashdance"). The direction is
smooth, dark and charismatic, a noticeable improvement from Franklin's
earlier film, "One False Move."
The film looks big, but Franklin isn't big enough himself to necessarily
get the production money he needs. But as < NN s "Showbiz" page on the
Web reported, Franklin was able to cast Washington even though the star
usually fetches $10 million a film.
"I don't live my life as an A-list," Washington told Fntertainment.
"How does an A-list person walk around? Sorry I can't talk to you, I'm on
the A-list now.'"
Washington's skill as an accomplished actor who chooses his scripts well
shines in the role of Fasv Rawlins, an unemployed machinist who gets
sucked into a dangerous game but then masters it.
Rawlins is picked up by a gun packing I )ewitt Allbright whose business
"is to do favors for friends." Allbright selects Rawlins because he needs a
black man to find a white woman who 112 requents illegal blues clubs. The slick
'4()s style and wonderful blues .soundtrack complements the on-running
racial commentary of the film; Fasy has to deal with brutal police interroga
tions, white male paranoia, segregated hotels and the fear of (!od when he
sees other black men killing each other over "white man's politics."
I his is the kind offil m you can see with your parents, your friends or your
date. (1 )on't believe the hype — Stanford is as romantic as you make it.) It's
a thrilling film. Seven bucks for happiness seems like a good deal to me.
