# Custred out for change
## Cal State professor against affirmative action 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Prof. Glynn Custred, co-author of a
statewide initiative to end affirmative ac
tion programs at state-funded colleges and
government offices, came to campus last
night to enlist support among students.
Speaking in front of about 75 students
at an event sponsored by the Stanford Col
lege Republicans, the long-time professor
of anthropology at Cal State-Hayward lec
tured for about an hour on the history and
aims of his proposal.
"1 Ethnic) preferences are unfair, social
ly divisive and cast a stigma on the people
that receive them," Custred said. "If we
don't want little Bosnias and Northern Ire
lands in this country ... we need to orga
nize."
Custred's proposal, the California Civil
Rights Initiative, requires the signatures
of 1.1 million voters in order to be placed on
the November election ballot. The measure
would prevent state agencies from giving
"preferential treatment" based on ethnici
ty in public contracting or employment de
cisions, as well as outlawing such policies
throughout the state's education system.
Custred stressed the universality of his
effort, saying the initiative would not "dis

mantle" affirmative action programs that
do not engage in preferential policies.
Reaching out to targeted minority groups,
he said, would still be legal if his proposal
passes.
"All we're doing is reaffirming the core
values of the country and, we think, reaf
firming t he original goals of affirmative ac
tion," he said.
Custred's speech comes just one day
after University President Gerhard Casper
officially upheld the University's commit
ment to affirmative action in a printed
speech that he will deliver at the first Fac
ulty Senate meeting Oct. 12.
Casper wrote, "It is the responsibility of
educational institutions such as Stanford
to find and educate those who can become
the leaders of the future in a multiethnic
and multiracial society. Alas, our society is
quite color-conscious, and we therefore
cannot yet afford to be colorblind."
Custred, on the other hand, said, "We'll
probably never have a colorblind society
. . . but we have to have a colorblind legal
system."
Arguing that political correctness, be
hind-the-scenes action by state courts and
the bureaucracy have stifled debate on the
issue, ('ustred cited the language
of his proposal, which is similar
to that of tin* landmark 1904
Civil Rights Act, as proof that
his measure is "mainstream."
Custred also said he had no
objection to Stanford's admissions
policies, since it is a private insti
tution He did, however, say that
on principle, elite institutions
should not take race into account.
Racial preference can lead to a
situation in which admitted stu
dents have lower SAT scores than
others, Custred said, meaning
they are "mismatched with the
institution" they attend.
