# Steal Big, Steal Little
## 
### 
Slapstick eases of mistaken identity between twin broth
ers, bright costumes, queens and wealthy folk — it sure
sounds like Shakespeare. But "Steal big, Steal Little" is where
the Bard and the bad diverge.
Andy Garcia stars as twin brothers Ruben and Robby
Martinez, rescued from an immigration raid by wealthy bal
lerina Mona Rowland. Raised in the lap of luxury in the Santa
Barbara hills, Ruben shirks worldly possessions to live com
munally with the Mexican workers on the ranch, while
Robby ruthlessly wants to turn the ranch into a posh resort.
When Mona wills the ranch to Ruben (or Ruben-hood as he
mockingly calls himself), Robby will stop at nothing to get
his hands on the money.
Mixed up in this fray are Ruben's estranged wife and

daughter, as well as Robin's ex
wife, who is a very close friend of
Ruben's — and just how close is a
question asked throughout the
movie. Alan Arkin and Joe Panto
liano flesh out the cast. Arkin por
trays the realistic Chicago pal
being sought by the mob, while
Pantoliano is a pathetic, whiny,
bad-wigged lawyer.
The movie works best when it
tackles larger issues. The docu
mentary being made on the land
battle elicits the most real and best
acted scenes in the film. So, too, the
immigration raid on the lemon
fields is the most riveting, passion
ate scene.
The film's problems, then, stem
from its ambition as a romantic

screwball comedy. (iarcia has no timing, and the rest of the cast
is sophomoric and cliched. Director Andrew Davis led us to
expect more after the success of "The Fugitive," but his tricks
with mirrors (where Robhy talks to Ruben while both stand in
front of 18 mirrors) are distracting rather than impressive.
The plot is thin; its twists and turns don't disguise the
holes in its complexity. (Why would someone testify to their
own infidelity at a divorce hearing?) The ending, too, is a la
"Pretty Woman." In a movie that takes on issues as large as il
legal labor and a corrupt justice system, fairy tale endings
should be left on the cutting room floor.
The one thing in the film's favor, however, is the scenery.
The beautifully lush hills of Santa Barbara and the color of
the solstice parade come across the big screen exquisitely,
and this movie does for Santa Barbara what " The Fugitive"
did for Chicago. Perhaps Davis should work for National
Geographic and leave movie-making to someone else.
