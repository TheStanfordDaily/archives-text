# How to Make an American Quilt
## 
### 
Spending the summer with grandma and
great aunt (ilady in a sleepy, Northern (California
town doesn't sound like a dream vacation. Vet in
"How to Make an American Quilt," this escape
not only supplies I inn (Winona Ryder) with a
wealth of maternal wisdom collected over
decades, it also provides the answers to her own
soul search.
After changing her Ph.D. thesis topic three
times, Finn decides to spend the summer in
Grasse, California to write in peace and also to
ponder her commitment to Sam, her fiancee.
During her stay, Finn's grandmother (Ellen
Burstvn), great aunt (Anne Bancroft) and their
five friends — all members of the Grasse Quilt
ing Bee — impart stories of romance, love and
heartbreak as they craft Finn's wedding quilt.
The movie flashes back as each woman recol
lects where love has resided in her life. In the
process, a diverse, heart-warming collection of ro
mantic, painful and humorous stories is revealed.
Not all of the women share depressing tales.
One tells of finding her true soul mate in a Paris
cafe while Finn's grandmother and great aunt
chronicle their life-long friendship which sur
vived one's sleeping with the other's husband.
In between stories, Finn contemplates her own
romantic situation and does a bit of fooling
around herself with a dark, usually-wet Fabio type
she meets at the pool. Providing some of the most
humorous moments of the film, he woos her with
seductive red strawberries as they roll around in
the fields. Although Ryder makes a believably
frustrated grad student, the intrigue which sur

rounded her darker "1 leathers' and "Beetlejuice"
characters is lust with I inn's goodness.
Despite the variation and charm of the ro
mantic stories, the movie becomes sickly senti
mental alter a while. I'he women exchange a few
too many loving looks and I inn s own explo
ration similarly grows old as there doesn't seem
to be a good reason why she's dissatisfied with
Sam in the first place.
The movie's climax, an unlikely windstorm
which scatters Finn's thesis for miles and some
how leads her out of her fog, is also a bit hard to
swallow.
Clearly a story better suited for paper than the
screen, "How to Make an American Quilt" at
times requires a tolerance for sap and an active
imagination. Keeping these shortcomings in
mind, the complex stories of these women's lives
can nevertheless make the film worthwhile.
