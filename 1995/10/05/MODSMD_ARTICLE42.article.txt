# A 						Month by the Lake

### 
Based on a novella by H. E. Bates, "A
Month by the Lake" is an ephemeral ro
mantic comedy set in the summer before
the outbreak of World War 11. Its premise
of vacationing Anglos who get magically
transformed by Italy has been done before
and done better (1992's "Enchanted
April" comes first to mind), but "A
Month's" scenario is full of comic possi
bilities, thanks to its quartet of main char
acters.
Vanessa Redgrave, looking and acting
oddly contemporary, plays the free-spirit
ed Miss Bentley. Although she has had her
share of past relationships, Miss Bentley
appears to be trying to make up for a life
time of spinsterhood in one month with
the only eligible Englishman in her age
bracket around, Major Wilshaw (Edward
Fox). It is, however, difficult to under
stand why someone as independent and
artistic as Miss Bentley should fall for the
stodgy Wilshaw, especially given her ini
tial attraction for his (singularly unre
markable) ears.
The Major himself gives an entirely
new meaning to the crusty upper-class
British twit. Miss Beaumont (Uma Thur
man), an American schoolgirl turned
nanny, aptly dubs him "candlestick." Not
only is the Major stiff and upright and
waxen-faced, he is easily melted by Miss
Beaumont's manipulation of his affec
tions. If you've only seen Uma Thurman
in "Pulp Fiction," you're in for a surprise;
she plavs Miss Beaumont with such exag

gerated giddiness that she enlivens every
scene she's in. Unfortunately, the plot only
calls for her character to be the catalyst for
Miss Bentley and the Major.
The affection of a handsome young
Italian (Alessandro Gassman) for Miss
Bentley complements the Major's attrac
tion to Miss Beaumont. This love quad
rangle paves the way for a farce that un
fortunately only provides unfulfilled
comic potential. While there are hilarious
moments between the mismatched lovers
in the first half of the movie, the slow rec
onciliation of Miss Bentley and the Major
is anticlimactic. Even the beautiful
scenery of Lake Como isn't enough to save
this movie from an overly sentimental
take on middle-aged romance.
