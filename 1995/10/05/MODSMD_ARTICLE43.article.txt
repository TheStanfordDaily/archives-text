## Zachary Thacher Hanif Kureishi's album of sex and literature 
### 
Sex makes for great literature. Authors
like Philip Roth and Henry Miller have
written entire novels revolving around
the pursuit and fulfillment of their sexual
pleasures. Not that I'm single-minded, but
"Portnoy's Complaint" and "Tropic of Capri
corn" are good reads with something to say.
I'hey are of the school of literature that goes
for the jugular in the first chapter and never
stops. Now, there's a new (albeit small) star to
add to this list of lasciviousness.
I lanif Kureishi wears white, opcn-collared
shirts and sports modish, three-button blaz
ers, at least when he's dressed to impress at
Printer's Inc. He penned the screenplay tor
"My Beautiful Laundrette," a London-based
movie about two men, their laundromat and
their sex life. He also wrote "Sammy and
Rosie Ciet Laid," a lighter film about two cou
pies and, well, you can go from there.
His first novel, "Buddha in Suburbia,"
chronicles the life of an Indian -English
teenager in the sexual and artistic chaos ol
London in the wake of the (>()s. The book is an
erotic roller coaster punctuated with insights
into the life of a non-white adolescent si rug
uline with art and adulthood.

Mr. Kureishi has written a new book, " The
Black Album." 1 le says at the signing that he
titled his book thus because "it's all been
downhill after the Beatles' 'White Album.' "
The name is also a reference to Prince in all of
his non-black, non-white, shallow and mysti
cal androgyny, and his similarly titled record.
The novel details the story of an Asian-Eng
lish college student's misadventures with sex
ual attractions, his brother's multiple drug
addictions and the draw of Muslim funda
mentalism.
To be a fashionable artist necessitates, it
seems, a scene to travel in. Hanif Kureishi has
emerged from London's alternative brat
pack, a group of ethnic filmmakers working
for Tngland's Channel l our television. The
TV channel features programming that deals
with issues facing black, Asian and gay artists
and also exhibits avant-garde film. Peter
Creenway, who made "The Cook, The Thief,
I lis Wife and I ler Lover," worked for Channel
Tour, and so did Steven Trears and Neal lor
dan, who made "The Crying Game."
Kureishi wrote screenplays for this con
temporary and decidedly "multicultural"
television station in the 'KOs and seems to

have been marked by his experience there ever
since. In England, Channel Four is hip, con
troversial and representative of typically un
derrepresented groups. (One of its shows,
called "Black on Black," is an intelligent talk
show that would never be produced in the
United States.) As an American reader or
viewer, the people who come out of Channel
Four's make-the-rules-as-you-go milieu
should be noticed and listened to.
But you don't have to be British or bisexu
al or Asian to understand the literary and cin
ematic scene in London. Kureishi writes for
every ethnic group and for every nationality.
When I asked him if Americans can access his
stories, he said, "When you are reading good
writing, you enter the writer's mind."
"And share his human experience?" I
asked.
"Exactly."
1 think of his films and books as contem
porary explorations into ethnic identity (or
the lack thereof), sexual allure and adoles
cence. I le tackles the issues and lifestyles for a
general ion of college students, from 1989 into
the early '90s, in his new book. The results arc
surprising, both for the reader and for

Kureishi.
I le says that he was familiar with socialism
when he was in college and that he half ex
pected to see similar leftist activism in today's
undergraduates when he researched "The
Black Album." Instead, he dug up a world of
Muslim fundamentalism that encourages
censorship of "heretical" literature, especially
that of Salman Rushdie. Of course, the stu
dents Kureishi was busy researching didn't
know that he was a close friend of Rushdie's
and abhorred the fatwa issued against the
popular writer.
These are perhaps issues more specific to
the British Isles, but the broader context of
fundamentalist religious belief, book censor
ship and the need to have a cause among
young people will certainly ring true among
American college students.
i recently bought and started to read " The
Black Album." 1 anticipate that it will be as
original and lush as "Buddha in Suburbia."
There is a little of J. 1). Salinger in Kureishi, as
well as enough 1 lenry Miller to keep you glued
to the pages, and it shows that I lanif Kureishi
is an accomplished writer with a lot of
promise.
