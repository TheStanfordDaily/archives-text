### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
It's no secret that the current
topic of choice for conversations
the nation over can be neatly ab
breviated with two very big let
ters. Keeping pace with the trend,
the Law School yesterday hosted a
noontime panel discussion to ad
dress issues surrounding the ac
quittal of O.J. Simpson.
About 200 people attended the
discussion, where the panel in
cluded three professors and two
associate professors of the Law
School. Many of the panelists at
tempted to explain the reasons be
hind the verdict, and some also
tried to predict and warn against
the verdict's consequences, both
social and legal.
Speaking first, Prof. Miguel
Mendez cited the prosecution's
use of I)NA evidence as "openling]
the door to a very efficient attack"
bv the defense.
The best defense is one that dis

Mendez said.
He noted that the prosecution

"I think there's a way to look at
this verdict to [suggest] that it was
based on reason," she said.
Taylor-Thompson said in the
exchanges of legalese between the
prosecution and the defense, "it
often felt like a conversation be
tween two scientists."
She pointed out that this might
have posed a problem for the pros
ecution because, unless it ade
quately explained its key evidence
to the jurors, it "would have | had!
a difficult time persuading" them
that Simpson was guilty.
Addressing what she cited as
another public misconception,
Taylor-Thompson said, "People
say that when you have a largely
African-American jury that they
will not convict an African-Ameri
can defendant."
Drawing on her experience in
criminal trials in Washington,
D.C., Taylor-Thompson said pre
