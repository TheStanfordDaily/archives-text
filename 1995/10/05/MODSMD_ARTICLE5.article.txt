# Law School profs discuss O.J. verdict
## 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
It's no secret that the current
topic of choice for conversations
the nation over can be neatly ab
breviated with two very big let
ters. Keeping pace with the trend,
the Law School yesterday hosted a
noontime panel discussion to ad
dress issues surrounding the ac
quittal of O.J. Simpson.
About 200 people attended the
discussion, where the panel in
cluded three professors and two
associate professors of the Law
School. Many of the panelists at
tempted to explain the reasons be
hind the verdict, and some also
tried to predict and warn against
the verdict's consequences, both
social and legal.
Speaking first, Prof. Miguel
Mendez cited the prosecution's
use of I)NA evidence as "openling]
the door to a very efficient attack"
bv the defense.
The best defense is one that dis
credits its opponents' arguments,
Mendez said.
He noted that the prosecution
would have been making "a real
blunder" at the time it decided to
use the DNA evidence if it had
foreseen Mark Fuhrman's role in
the defense's racial conspiracy
theory.
Mendez attributed what seems
to be a major rift between those
who celebrated and those who
lamented a verdict of not guilty to

the defense's strategy of proving
reasonable doubt rather than in
nocence.
"It's not surprising that we get
the division that we do," Mendez
said, when "reasonable people
looking at this evidence" would
conclude that the defendant was
guilty.
Assoc. Prof. Kim Taylor-
Thompson said that while the ver
dict has been called based on emo
tion or stupid, "I would not de
scribe it that way.
"I think there's a way to look at
this verdict to [suggest] that it was
based on reason," she said.
Taylor-Thompson said in the
exchanges of legalese between the
prosecution and the defense, "it
often felt like a conversation be
tween two scientists."
She pointed out that this might
have posed a problem for the pros
ecution because, unless it ade
quately explained its key evidence
to the jurors, it "would have | had!
a difficult time persuading" them
that Simpson was guilty.
Addressing what she cited as
another public misconception,
Taylor-Thompson said, "People
say that when you have a largely
African-American jury that they
will not convict an African-Ameri
can defendant."
Drawing on her experience in
criminal trials in Washington,
D.C., Taylor-Thompson said pre
dominantly African-American
juries "did not always acquit."
Prof. Robert VVeisberg, calling
the Simpson case "the most
important criminal trial of the
'90s — maybe the most important
criminal trial of the last 20 years,"
said he could not offer much in the
way of reasoning to explain the
verdict.
"I don't understand how the
human mind works. That's my
basic problem," he said.
He added that his best guess

was that "the truth in this case
probably lay in between" a verdict
based on reasonable doubt and an
attitude of "we'll be damned if
we're going to give the LAPD a
conviction."
VVeisberg expressed concern
over "whether we should discern
vast conclusions from this case."
In particular, he was skeptical
about the validity of statements
that the criminal justice system is
suffering from a corrupt and
crumbling foundation.
Taylor-Thompson voiced a sim
ilar sentiment when she warned
against "wholesale changes to the
jury system" based on what she

termed "a unique case, an aberra
tional case."
Mendez addressed the issue
many feminists have raised — that
a verdict of not in a murder
trial in which the defendant was
an alleged wife-beater sends the
wrong kind of message. He said the
alleged abuse factor may explain a
large part of the distress some peo
ple feel over the verdict.
In addition, Mendez said he was
concerned that some might take
advantage of this verdict to try to
limit defendants' rights, some
thing he said is a fundamental and
necessary part of this country's
constitution.
Overall, the professors cau
tioned against joining too readily
in a call to arms to reform the jury
system with such provisions as
fixed juries and jury question
naires tailored to a specific case.
Prof. Barbara Babcock, in read
ing part of an op-ed piece she is
writing for the Los Angeles Times,
said there are two problems with
wanting to reform the jury system:
one, that the jury system is not
broken; and two, that such
changes can have unpredictable
results.
Saying that she disagrees with
the Simpson verdict, Babcock nev
ertheless asserted that "we have
always been willing to sustain the
risk that a jury may be wrong," a
fact that should not be changed by
the Simpson case, where misman
agement of the jury "may (have
been] at the heart of the acquittal.
"Right or wrong, the jury is still
one of our greatest and most cher
ished American institutions," Bab
cock said.
