the Row to afternoon classes yes

truck chute.
Six passengers were on board

1 p.m.
The cement truck was parked

Martin Fuentes, driver of the
cement truck, said he was parked
on the right curb of Campus
Drive East when the collision oc
curred.

"I was stopped here on the side
of the road with my lights flash
ing," he said. "We were getting
ready to pour some cement here,
and the chute was directly behind
my truck. I was looking back in my
side view mirror when [the shut
tle driver) turned the corner."
The construction workers

were preparing to cement a
south sidewalk of Campus Drive
East when the accident occurred.
Fuentes said he saw the Mar
guerite shuttle turn from May
field to Campus Drive and drive
toward his truck.
