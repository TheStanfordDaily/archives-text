An unusual turn of events sur
prised students traveling from
the Row to afternoon classes yes
terday when a Marguerite shut
tle was impaled on a cement
truck chute.
Six passengers were on board
the shuttle at the time of the ac
cident. An unidentified woman
who was seated near the front
of the bus was taken to the
Stanford Medical Center for in
juries to the head and upper
body.
The accident involving one of
Stanford's public shuttles and a
cement truck, contracted by the
RMC Lonestar company, oc
curred at the corner of Mayfield
and Campus Drive East just after
1 p.m.
The cement truck was parked
about 50 feet from the intersec
tion on the right curb of Campus
Drive East when the Marguerite
turned and collided with a chute
that had been extended from the
rear ofthe truck.
The chute entered the right
window of the shuttle bus and

penetrated completely through
the vehicle, shattering five win
dows and virtually destroying the
entire right side.
Martin Fuentes, driver of the
cement truck, said he was parked
on the right curb of Campus
Drive East when the collision oc
curred.

"I was stopped here on the side
of the road with my lights flash
ing," he said. "We were getting
ready to pour some cement here,
and the chute was directly behind
my truck. I was looking back in my
side view mirror when [the shut
tle driver) turned the corner."
The construction workers

were preparing to cement a
south sidewalk of Campus Drive
East when the accident occurred.
Fuentes said he saw the Mar
guerite shuttle turn from May
field to Campus Drive and drive
toward his truck.

Officials and bystanders observe yesterday's accident between a Marguerite shuttle and a cement
truck.
"At first, I thought she was
going to rear-end me," he said
"Then I thought she was going to
stop."
While Fuentes claimed the
cement chute was extended
directly behind the truck, passen
gers were unsure about the posi
tion of the chute prior to the
impact.
Marlene Quintanilla, the driv
er of the Marguerite shuttle,
appeared visibly shaken and
would not comment about the
accident.

Marguerite supervisor Santos
Orellana said he was unaware of
the specifics of the accident. How
ever. he said this i.-> Lhc first acci
dent that has happened during
his two years supervising the
shuttle services.
Lisa Navratil, a first-year med
ical student and one of the pas
sengers in the Marguerite, was
seated in the third row on the left
side of the shuttle. She was read
ing a magazine when the accident
occurred, a coincidence which she
claimed spared her from injury
because her head was down.
"1 was shocked and scared,"
she said shortly after the incident.
"How do you react after a cement

truck goes through a bus?"
She said she tried to help the
injured woman while waiting for
help to arrive.
"I'm just a first-year med stu
dent, and I felt I should do some
thing," she said. "But 1 didn't
know what to do, so I just held her
hand."
Navratil added that she didn't
think the shuttle driver was at
fault.
"She was just doing her job,"
she said.
Rick Cook, plant manager at
KMC Lonestar, said he did not
have any liability concerns.
"I'm just glad no one was hurt
seriously," he said.
