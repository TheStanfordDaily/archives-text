## Japanese cult leader confesses guilt 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — The dooms
day cult guru charged with mur
der in the nerve gas attack on
Tokyo's subways has confessed to
the crime and other killings,
Japan's public television network
NI IK said yesterday.
"In each case 1 gave the order
and group leaders carried it out,"
NHK quoted Shoko Asahara as
telling investigators.
Police and the cult refused to
comment.
Asahara had previously denied
involvement in the subway
attack, as well as a nerve gas
attack in central Japan last ye.ir
that killed seven people and the
1989 murder of a lawyer and his
family.
Japanese prosecutors, who
tend to rely heavily on confessions
in building criminal cases, had
reportedly l>een 112 rustrated bv Asa
hara's refusal to answer ques
tions.
Asahara and other leaders of
the Aum Shinri Kyo cult are
accused of plotting to spread sarin
nerve gas on several subway lines
in central Tokyo on March 20.

Twelve people were killed and
more than 5,500 were sickened.
The 40-year-old guru has pre
dicted an apocalypse that only cult
members will survive.
While most of the cult's leaders
are in jail, seven fugitive members
are being sought on suspicion of
involvement in the subway attack
and other crimes.
Cult spokesman Fumihiro
Joyu said that prior to the NHK
report Asahara had asked the
fugitives to turn themselves in to
police.
Yesterday, police were reported
to be examining sodium cyanide
found at an abandoned mountain
campsite of one of the fugitives,
Satoru Mi rata, to determine if it
matches that used in an attempt
ed gas attack May 6 in one of
Tokyo's busiest train stat ions.
A burning bag of the chemical
was doused before its fumes could
combine with an adjacent bag of
chemicals and release enough
cyanide gas to kill thousands.
Some fear that the fugitives
may attempt similar attacks when
Asahara's trial begins Oct. 2(i.
