## Marines reflect on rape 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — Stung by rape charges
against three of their own, U.S. forces on Oki
nawa carried out orders to begin an "official
reflection" yesterday with talks on discipline,
behavior and how to be better neighbors.
The troops are undergoing two days of self
examination following the rape of a 12-year-old
girl, allegedly by U.S. servicemen.
Two Marines and a sailor are awaiting trial in
the rape, which outraged Japan and renewed
debate over whether the nation should seek the
removal or drastic reduction of the U.S. military
presence on Okinawa.
Charged in the rap«» are Marine Pfc. Rodrico
Harp, 21, of Griffin, CJa.; Pfc. Kendrick I xxlet, 20,
ofWaycross, Ga.; and Navy Seaman Marcus Gill,
20, of Woodville, Texas. The men face life in
prison if convicted.
In Tokyo yesterday, demonstrators waved
fists and placards in front of the U.S. Embassy
and Japan's Foreign Ministry. Later, 5,000
protesters rallied in a downtown park.
"We must never forgive the Americans for
this incident," said Yoneko Arakaki, an Oki
nawan community leader. The audience cheered
wildly when she called for the permanent
removal of U.S. bases from Japan.
Okinawan teachers planned a march today,
and a demonstration later this month backed by
Okinawa's major political parties is expected to
draw tens of thousands.
Under a mutual security treaty, the United
States has 45,000 troops stationed in Japan, with
nearly 30,000 of them based in Okinawa. Anoth
er 12,000 sailors are assigned to the U.S. 7th
Fleet, which luis its home port in Yokosuka, just
south of Tokyo.
Tokyo and Washington have stressed that nei
ther wants to review the overall security
arrangement, but maintaining the status quo is a
heavy burden on Okinawa.
Roughly 75 percent of all the land reserved for
exclusive U.S. military use in Japan is concen
trated on Okinawa, a small, crowded island locat
ed between Japan's main islands and Taiwan.
Plans for streamlining the U.S. military on
Okinawa have been on the table for years, but
the current storm appears to have given officials
the impetus to try to actually implement them.
