Although ethnic leaders may bo
dismayed hy the recent nation
wide backlash against affirmative
action, on the Stanford campus,
feelings are positive after Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper re
cently made a statement on the
issue.
In his speech, released Wednes
day, Casper talked about represen
tations of African Americans, Chi
cano / Latinos and Native Ameri
cans — who, according to Casper,
"Stanford is committed to a sub
stantial presence of. . . in the un
dergraduate student body."
"I applaud Dr. Casper for his
position and reaffirmation of
Stanford's policies," said Morris
Craves, director of the Black (Com
munity Services Center.
"1 was happy to see that the
University, through the president,
has reaffirmed its commitment to
affirmative action. I was also glad
that Casper kept the issue of affir
mative action in context of the
University and did not try to take
on affirmative action in context of
the nation. I also liked how lie said
that the role of the University was
to train and prepare our students
to effect social change," he said.
The director of El Centro Chi
cano, Frances Morales, agreed. "I
am glad that 1 Casper | came out on
the issue of affirmative action. It
seems that everyone was wonder
ing what Stanford's position was
on this issue," she said. "It ia good
that the whole' Stanford communi
ty can see this.
"I am impressed with the text;
it was very thorough," Morales
said. "It not only looks into the fu
ture, but it looks back to the foun-
dations of t he policies of this Uni
versity."
Benny Shendo, the director <»f
the American Indian Program
Office, also reacted positively. "I
am happy that Casper came for
ward to support affirmative
action, but I was not totally
shocked because he has been very
supportive of our programs in the
past," lie said.
"At a place like Stanford we are
in the forefront in many areas,
and we can act as a leader for
ot her institutions to make a stand
on what we believe is ritrht. It

really feels good to be associated
with a university that can take a
stand on and support affirmative
action," he added
link Yuen, director of the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, chose not to comment until
he hears Casper's speech delivered
Oct. \2 to the Faculty Senate.
In the statement, Casper
wrote: "Why should we look for
such diversity? . . First, we want
a rich educational environment to
challenge our students . . Sec
ond, we want to be faithful to our
task to educate leaders for a
diverse and complex society. . . .
This cannot be done unless the
country's demographic diversity
finds a presence on campus."
"One of the pitfalls in our soci

ety is that it revolves around
Eurocentric education. Many peo
ple in this country have a false
belief that our view, the Eurocen
tric view, is the only view. Differ
ent cultures bring different views,
and being exposed to these many
views is the key to understand
ing," said Graves.
This wider understanding
increases the chances of finding
solutions to this country's prob
lems, lie added.
(liven the debate over the anti
affirmative action California Civil
Rights Initiative, and the coun
try's recent backlash against
affirmative action and the princi
ples for which it stands, many of
t he directors said they are pleased
with the stand Casper has taken.

"Even if the CCKI reflects the
sentiments of this country, at
le.ist we know that here at Stan
ford we are keeping our commit
ment to a diverse student body,"
Morales said.
In Casper's statement he
speaks of the past policies of Stan
ford, and how they reflect the fact
that Stanford has always been
ahead of its time in admissions
policies.
Looking at a picture of Stan
ford's first graduating class,
Graves noted the presence of
many women, an African-Ameri
can student and several Asian-
American students.
"The beauty of diversity is one
of the great things that Stanford
offers," he said.
