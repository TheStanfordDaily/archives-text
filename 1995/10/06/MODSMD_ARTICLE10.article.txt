ZAGREB, Croatia (AP)
Bosnia's combatants agreed yes
terday to a 60-day cease-fire and
new talks on ending their 3 1/2
years of carnage, taking one big
step closer to a peace settlement
that U.S. troops would help police.
The accord on the cease-fire
was reached during the United
States' strongest press yet for
peace in Bosnia. In announcing
the agreement, President Clinton
in Washington acknowledged that
unresolved problems remained
before it takes effect Tuesday.
"We need to be clear-eyed
about this," he said. "It matters
what the parties do, not just what
t hey say."
NATO planners said they
would hasten work on a military

force to help enforce an eventual
peace arrangement. The United
States would commit roughly
20,000 troops to such a force, hut
is saying they would not enter
Bosnia until a final peace deal is
signed.
Citing progress toward peace,
the United Nations announced it
could cut its troops in Bosnia by
9,000 troops, or one-third of its
force in Bosnia. It was not known
how long the withdrawals would
take.
Warring forces in Bosnia con
tinued to battle for strategic terri
tory. But in contrast to countless
failed truces, they seemed to want
this cease-fire.
The U.S. official who negotiat
ed it, Asst Secretary of State

Richard Holbrooke, shed his nor
mally cautious demeanor yester
day after shuttling around the
Balkans.
"Today marks another impor
tant step forward, undeniably a
big step forward," Holbrooke told
reporters in Zagreb, the Croatian
capital. "We're pleased with
where we are."
In the northern Serb
stronghold Banja Luka, Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
said he saw no reason to take back
by force territory Serbs recently
have lost. "We want peace, and we
have to be practical," he said.
Croatia, which has emerged
this year as a military counter
weight to the Serbs in the Balk
ans, is not a party to tin l cease-lire.
