## Delaying renovations 
### 
Adding two years to
Capital Improvement
Program is wise idea

After renovating
Wilbur, Florence Moore and
Stern, as well as a number
of Row houses, the University is
finally ready to slow down and
take a break. While this may not
seem ideal to students itching to
draw into remodeled houses, it is
better for students and the Uni
versity as a whole.
The break comes as a change in
the Capital Improvement Pro
gram, which switched from a 10-
year program to a 12-year pro
gram early last week. To students,
this means that the renovation of
Toyon will be delayed for two
years and Lagunita will be fin
ished in the summer of 1997.
While the push back may seem
extreme to some, it is practical
and can only benefit the Universi
ty. The past three projects have all
experienced problems because of
the fast pace at which they were
executed.
Stern, for instance, is still not
complete, and Flo Mo, which was
renovated the year before, was
barely finished in time for fresh
man arrivals. In Flo Mo's case,
although the building was fin
ished, desks were not available for
students by the time freshmen
arrived.
Similar problems were found in
Wilbur, where new students mov
ing in found the paint on the
walls still wet. In addition, stu
dents complained about not being
able to prop open fire doors,
though this problem was later
remedied.
Having a recess in the GIF
should allow the University to
step back and restructure its own
program.
During the past three years,
Housing and Dining Services has
worked at a remarkably high
intensity in order to renovate

three large dorms over three sum
mers. The respite should allow the
University to relax and carefully
plan and implement the next
three projects — Lagunita, Toyon
and Branner.
If the University takes advan
tage of the break in such a man
ner, it could save significant sums
of money. In the past, due to the
tight work schedule to finish the
dorms, the University has exceed
ed its construction budget. By tak
ing a break, the University can
make sure it has planned for its
projects financially, taking into
account last-minute expenses
when it develops a summer bud
get.
The University should also
view this recess as an opportunity
to learn from the renovation pro
cess itself
At this point, the University
should welcome constructive criti
cisms and feedback from students
living in renovated dorms. Not
only would this bring a number of
ideas to the table, but it would
also make sure the University is
not missing anything in its reno
vation process.
Admittedly, Toyon does not
need to undergo major architec
tural revision like Stern and
Wilbur. Yet, although Toyon
seems like a straight-forward pro
ject — and a relatively smaller
project compared to the other
three dorms that have been
remodeled — it might still prove
challenging. Like previous dorms,
Toyon still has to undergo a num
ber of changes that includes
replacing furniture, adding sprin
klers and making it handicap
accessible.
However, it is a good idea on the
University's part to continue
work on the Row houses. Since
the Row houses are smaller pro
jects, it is not hard for Housing
and Dining to remodel them.
All in all, adding an extra two
years to the GIF can only benefit
the campus. Rushing into an
intensive project is never a wise
idea.
