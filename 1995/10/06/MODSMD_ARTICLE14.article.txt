Voting associates violate democratic principles

THIS LETTER IS concerning a hill
which is about to come before the
ASSU Senate during the next
meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 10. The bill,
authored by senators Bill Shen and
Armen Panossian, would give senate
associates the right to vote in senate
committees.
Senate associates are appointed by
the Senate Nominations Committee.
They are not elected by students.
Because they are not directly elected by
the student body at large, I am com
pletely against allowing them to vote in

senate committees.
Because we are in an era where the
senate is replete with political parties,
we must be especially wary of giving
voting privilege to those who are not
elected by students. The bill would
allow the nominations committee — and
any partisan interests that control the
committee — to significantly alter the
composition of all senate committees to
further specific political interests.
The right to vote in the senate is a
privilege that I take very seriously. We
must not forget that this right is

derived from the student voters them
selves, and not any committee. If this
bill passes, any majority faction in the
senate will be able to construct a super
majority. This would upset the balance
of power that you, the students, created
when you voted.
If we want to give students more of a
say on ASSU issues, the creation of a
solid dorm representative program is
the answer. Allowing the senate to
appoint new voting committee members
to itself is not the answer. I urge you all
to contact the senators and ask them to

vote against this bill.
1 do not question the intentions of
senators Shen and Panossian. On the
contrary, I too believe that the Senate
Associate Program is a vital and inte
gral part of the senate. But I also
believe that there is a way to recognize
its importance without running con
trary to the democratic principles that
this country, and this senate, are found
ed upon.
