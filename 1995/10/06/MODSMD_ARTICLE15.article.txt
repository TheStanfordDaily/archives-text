# Stanford needs safe bicycle laws
## 
### 
I am not a psychic, but I can easily
predict a future Daily headline — "Stan
ford University Pays Millions of Dollars
to Settle Biking Accident Lawsuit."
How am I so clairvoyant? Easy. Yes
terday, within half an hour, I saw three
biking accidents while walking from the
Bookstore to Tresidder and then to the
Business School. Fortunately, there
were no serious injuries — only a couple
of scraped knees and a bloody elbow. Of
course, the bicyclists weren't injured as
they wore helmets and knee pads, hut
the "naked" pedestrians fell victim to
the speeding, well-protected cyclists.
I also noticed that a speeding bicyclist
was ignoring the sidewalk as he stared
at a female student behind him. After
almost hitting two girls, he didn't even
apologize as he screamed back, "Watch
out!"
Over the past few years at Stanford, 1
have witnessed many bicycle accidents
and near accidents. However, the Uni
versity always turns a blind eye. I hope
this letter is a wake-up call. 1 am writing
with the hope of preventing future
injuries and a major lawsuit against the
University. The University has a duty to

monitor our campus. With this let ter,
the University is informally placed on
notice regarding the problem.
There are no clearly marked biking
paths in the middle of campus and there
is no one policing the "dangerous" areas.
Other campuses force bicyclists to walk
their bikes in areas with a high pedestri
an concentration. These areas are heavi
ly policed and citations are given to vio
lators. Other campuses only allow hikes
on "blue" pathways which run through
out the campus. Stanford, however, has
only ignored the problem.
I sincerely hope that Stanford will act
immediately to restore safety and order
to its pathways on campus. If not, I look
forward to being an "expert" witness in
the unfortunate trial.
