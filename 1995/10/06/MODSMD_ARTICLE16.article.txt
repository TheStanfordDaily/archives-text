# Change in studentathlete registration affects advisers
## 
### 
Along with many other freshman
advisors and members of the Undergrad
uate Advising Center (UAC) staff. I was
awakened two nights ago after 11 p.m.
bv a panicked student who had only yes

terday learned that, varsity athletes had
to register hy midnight. I have small
children who must get up quite early to
get ready for school. This phone call dis
rupted their schedules as well as mine.
My understanding is that this early
registration deadline has to do with
NCAA regulations that the Department
of Athletics deemed fit to broadcast to
students and the UAC only Wednesday.
Had the Athletic Department let individ
ual advisors know of this date in
advance (and this is not difficult to do),
we could have reminded our varsity
advisees of the upcoming deadline and
avoided the hysteria and the late night
phone calls.
Had the Athletic Department let the
UAC know of this deadline before
Wednesday, they could have prepared
advisors and students for the sped-up
timeline. Had they let the registrar's
office know, this information could have
been in the Autumn Quarter Timetable,
where it belongs. As it is, however, the
Athletic Department informed no one
before Wednesday and the result was
chaos and anger on all sides.
This last minute scrambling put a
severe strain on the resources of the
advising office, not least of which are the
good graces of its volunteer faculty advi
sors. I have been a freshman advisor for
four years now, but I will think twice

about volunteering for this duty in the
future if I find the Athletics Department
thwarting the system in such a blatant
fashion again. 1 resent the late night
phone call, and I regret the harsh words
it engendered between me and my
advisee. The Athletics Department owes
it to the rest of the University to keep ut
informed of special circumstances sur
rounding its student athletes. At the
very least, student athletes, advisors anc
the UAC staff deserve an apology.
