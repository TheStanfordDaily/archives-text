# Campus viewpoint
## Dan Hoh Greeks are a valuable asset to campus 
### 
Wof the Beta and
KA houses last
spring and (lie pending
I)tÂ»11 house situation,
one must begin to won
der what Stanford's
campus would look like
completely Greek-free.
How would the average

Stanford student's life 1h? different with
out the KA charity mud volleyball tour
nament or the Dolts' annual Cowboy
party? As a member and officer of a
housed fraternity at Stanford, 1 have
often asked myself why I ever bothered to
rush, pledge and be activated into a (J rook
organization. How have I benefited the
last year by living in a house with a bunch
of guys who I call my "brothers?"
Coming to Stanford in '93 straight
out of the gritty streets of Omaha, Neb.,
I wondered where I would fit in at such
a huge campus. Was I going to find the
same "home" academic and social envi
ronment that I had experienced previ
ously at my small Jesuit high school? It
was not until my sophomore year and
my first year in the house that I really
felt like I could call Stanford home. It
became obvious to me that an essential
part of mv healthy college experience

was to feel like I had a secure base that I
could return to each day. 1 realized that
part of "going away" to college is learn
ing how to make your own home in ;i
completely new and foreign place.
College is also a time of intense learn
ing, development and maturing all con
centrated in a jam-packed four years.
Stanford is not just about discovering
Grignard reagents in chemistry, but
about how to become an adult in an
ever-increasingly fast-paced world. In
order to make it through college, one
needs a certain enthusiasm in accepting
the challenge.
People joke about the enthusiasm in
Branner. Well, I lived in Branner my
freshman year and did not see the same
drive or unity that I experience living in
a fraternity. While residing in Stan
ford's provided dormitories, I never saw
the same kind of motivation that is
required for planning a Greek activity
such as a charity event or even throwing
a simple weekend party. The solidarity
of fraternities and sororities gives their
members a boost to attack the college
experience with a certain fervor that is
hard to obtain otherwise.
But the average non-Greek reader is
still probably asking him or herself,
"What does the Greek svstem do for

me?" 1 contend that the whole campus
benefits from fraternities and sororities
in significant ways that are not always
apparent. Many of this campus' bright
est students come from fraternities and
sororities. Stanford Greeks often lead by
example in areas such as academics, phi
lanthropy, sports and other extracurric
ular.';. Fraternities and sororities also
provide a necessary social outlet that is a
cornerstone of the college learning expe
rience. Students don't just learn in isola
tion at Stanford, but actually live here,
which includes every part of being alive,
i.e. iriteracting with one's peers both in
the classroom and in social settings.
I hope that the non-Greek readers of
this article are not offended by my state
ments. I certainly do not presume to
claim that fraternity and sorority mem
bers enjoy a much richer Stanford expe
rience than anyone else. I merely wish
to offer my opinions on how I have per
sonally benefited from being in a frater
nity and why I think that the Greek sys
tem is a valuable element of this cam
pus.
