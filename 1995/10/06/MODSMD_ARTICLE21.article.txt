## Cardinal football attack set to torch Sun Devils 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
One low point for Stanford football in
a 1994 season chock full of disappoint
ments was a 36-35 loss af Arizona State
After trailing 27-15 in the third quarter,
the Cardinal racked up 20 quick points
to take an eight-point lead. But on their
final drive, the Sun Devils converted
three fourth-and-long plays against the
Stanford defense and kicked a 38-yard
field goal with six seconds remaining to
steal the game. The flight home from
Tempe was not a very pleasant one for
the Cardinal.
Now, as No. 19 Stanford (3-0-1 over
all, 1-0 Pacific 10 Conference) travels to
ASU (2-3, 1-2) for a 6 p.m. contest
tomorrow evening, one might think that
last year's fiasco in the desert rides high
m the mind of the Cardinal.
Then again, the first step in getting
over that disheartening loss is ignoring
it altogether.
"None of the staff has dwelt on it,
said sophomore defensive end Carl
Hansen. "None of the players have dwelt
on it that much. [This game) is just
another step on the road to our goal."
And, in truth, the auspicious begin
ning to Stanford's 1995 campaign looks
quite different from last year's. Instead
of squandering leads in the final minutes

of games, the Cardinal preserves or
extends them. Stanford has outscored
its opponents 27-14 in the fourth quar
ter this season.
"When we have to, we make plays,"
Hansen said. "We have a lot more confi
dence this year."
That confidence shows. Sun Devil
head coach Bruce Snyder can certainly
see it.
"IStanford is] playing better than the
talent on the field might indicate," he
said. "They've been cohesive and played
well together. They've won games in lots
of different ways. It's not just a few
guys."
On the other hand, Snyder's Sun
Devils have looked schizophrenic thus
far in 1995, playing very well in some cir
cumstances and struggling miserably in
others After losing 23-20 to Washington
m their season opener, they subsequent
ly knocked off UTEP 45-20, were
crush I'd by Nebraska 77-28, beat Oregon
State 20-11 and, just last week, were
shut out by USC, 31-0.
"We've really been on a roller coast
er," Snyder said. "It's going to be inter
esting to see how the club pulls itself
together and plays out the last six games
of the year."
ASU resembles Stanford squads of
the past two seasons — one capable of
putting a lot of points on the board and

of giving up even more. After an incredi
ble sophomore season in which he threw
for 2,179 yards and 15 touchdowns ta
total exceeded only by Oregon's Danny
O'Neil and Stanford's Steve Stenstrom),
junior Jake Plummer entered the season
as the highest rated quarterback in the
Pac-10.
However, Plummer has stumbled.
Although he has tossed nine touchdown
passes thus far to lead the conference, he
has also thrown six interceptions and
ranks last in passing efficiency.
Still, Plummer is a dangerous threat.
"He's pretty good," said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "[He's)
one of the best in the conference."
Plummer also has two excellent
weapons to throw to in junior wide
receivers Isaiah Mustafa and Keith
Poole. Mustafa, a junior college transfer,
has caught 15 balls for 196 yards and
two touchdowns He adds depth to the
Sun Devil receiving corps, helping to
take the pressure off the talented Poole
Poole caught 31 passes for 669 yards
and six touchdowns in 1994. He was the
only receiver in the conference to aver
age over 20 yards per reception. In 1995,
Plummer's favorite target has 25 catch
es for 479 yards and five touchdowns.
"He and Jake have a certain chem
