## Cardinal football attack set to torch Sun Devils 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
One low point for Stanford football in
a 1994 season chock full of disappoint
ments was a 36-35 loss af Arizona State
After trailing 27-15 in the third quarter,
the Cardinal racked up 20 quick points
to take an eight-point lead. But on their
final drive, the Sun Devils converted
three fourth-and-long plays against the
Stanford defense and kicked a 38-yard
field goal with six seconds remaining to
steal the game. The flight home from
Tempe was not a very pleasant one for
the Cardinal.
Now, as No. 19 Stanford (3-0-1 over
all, 1-0 Pacific 10 Conference) travels to
ASU (2-3, 1-2) for a 6 p.m. contest
tomorrow evening, one might think that
last year's fiasco in the desert rides high
m the mind of the Cardinal.
Then again, the first step in getting
over that disheartening loss is ignoring
it altogether.
"None of the staff has dwelt on it,
said sophomore defensive end Carl
Hansen. "None of the players have dwelt
on it that much. [This game) is just
another step on the road to our goal."
And, in truth, the auspicious begin
ning to Stanford's 1995 campaign looks
quite different from last year's. Instead
of squandering leads in the final minutes

of games, the Cardinal preserves or
extends them. Stanford has outscored
its opponents 27-14 in the fourth quar
ter this season.
"When we have to, we make plays,"
Hansen said. "We have a lot more confi
dence this year."
That confidence shows. Sun Devil
head coach Bruce Snyder can certainly
see it.
"IStanford is] playing better than the
talent on the field might indicate," he
said. "They've been cohesive and played
well together. They've won games in lots
of different ways. It's not just a few
guys."
On the other hand, Snyder's Sun
Devils have looked schizophrenic thus
far in 1995, playing very well in some cir
cumstances and struggling miserably in
others After losing 23-20 to Washington
m their season opener, they subsequent
ly knocked off UTEP 45-20, were
crush I'd by Nebraska 77-28, beat Oregon
State 20-11 and, just last week, were
shut out by USC, 31-0.
"We've really been on a roller coast
er," Snyder said. "It's going to be inter
esting to see how the club pulls itself
together and plays out the last six games
of the year."
ASU resembles Stanford squads of
the past two seasons — one capable of
putting a lot of points on the board and

of giving up even more. After an incredi
ble sophomore season in which he threw
for 2,179 yards and 15 touchdowns ta
total exceeded only by Oregon's Danny
O'Neil and Stanford's Steve Stenstrom),
junior Jake Plummer entered the season
as the highest rated quarterback in the
Pac-10.
However, Plummer has stumbled.
Although he has tossed nine touchdown
passes thus far to lead the conference, he
has also thrown six interceptions and
ranks last in passing efficiency.
Still, Plummer is a dangerous threat.
"He's pretty good," said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "[He's)
one of the best in the conference."
Plummer also has two excellent
weapons to throw to in junior wide
receivers Isaiah Mustafa and Keith
Poole. Mustafa, a junior college transfer,
has caught 15 balls for 196 yards and
two touchdowns He adds depth to the
Sun Devil receiving corps, helping to
take the pressure off the talented Poole
Poole caught 31 passes for 669 yards
and six touchdowns in 1994. He was the
only receiver in the conference to aver
age over 20 yards per reception. In 1995,
Plummer's favorite target has 25 catch
es for 479 yards and five touchdowns.
"He and Jake have a certain chem

istry," Snyder said. "He's our star
receiver."
In addition to a passing game
with high potential, the Sun Devils
also boast four running backs aver
aging at least 4.3 yards per carry.
Chris Hopkins, Terry Battle,
Michael Martin and Brian Single
ton form a committee of backs who
find holes to run through.
However, any production
depends upon the play of the ASU
offensive line. Anchored by left
tackle Juan Roque, the Sun Devil
O-line is a large reason for the suc
cess of the ASU running game.
On the other hand, it has failed
in its pass protection duties, allow
ing 12 sacks and placing Plummer
under a tremendous amount of
pressure. This is something the
Cardinal defense am exploit, espe
cially if it can stop the run and force
ASU into some third-and-long situ
ations.
"We've got to be able to dictate
where they're throwing it to," said
defensive coordinator Bill Harris.

"On third-and-long, how many peo
ple think they're going to run
ning the ball? Not too many. Where
do you think they're going to throw
the ball? Keith Poole. And if we
know they're going to throw the
ball to Keith, we have a better
chance of defending it."
I larris' defense gets a boost this
week from the return of senior line
man Jason White, who had been
sidelined with a knee injury. With
White back and an even healthier
David Carder, the senior nose tack
le who made his season debut at
Oregon, Stanford's defensive line
hopes to improve upon its impres
sive performance against the
Ducks, in which it registered 18
tackles, six tackles-for-losses and
two sacks.
"I think we are as healthy as
we've been in some time," Willing
ham said. "The week's rest was
probably good for us."
On offense, Stanford will once
again do whatever works. This
meant running the ball against San
Jose State and Utah, passing
against Wisconsin and a combina
tion of the two at Oregon. Against
Arizona State, only Willingham and
his staff know the plan, and they're

not telling.
"The design of our offense has
been to exploit whatever weakness
we can locate in a particular
defense," Willingham said.
The Sun Devils have a lot of
weaknesses to exploit. ASH ranks
last or next-to-last in the Pac-10 in
rushing defense, pass efficiency
defense, total defense and scoring
defense, although Willingham
reminds everyone that the teams
ASU has played — No. 15 Washing
ton, No. 2 Nebraska, No. 5 USC
may have something to do with why
the numbers are so poor.
"They're a better team than
some people might recognize," he
said. "If you watch some of the
things they do, you will see a very
solid football team."
Linebackers Scott Van der Ahe,
a transfer from lowa, and Justin
I)rag(K), a sixth-year senior, provide
the bright spots for the Sun Devils'
front seven, while free safety
Mitchell Freedman, a hard-hitting
true freshman, and strong safety
Damien Richardson lead the sec
ondary.
Stanford's junior running back
Mike Mitchell will look to run cir
cles around Van der Ahe, Freedman

and Co. as he returns to the state
where he grew up. Mitchell attend
ed Brophy Prep in Phoenix where
he set state records with 5,670
yards and 76 touchdowns.
"It's a real positive thing," Will
ingham said. "It's nice to go home
to friends and family and play well.
I think Mike's thinking of that."
Tempe may also give junior
flanker Brian Manning a chance to
break out the doldrums. Against
the Sun Devils bust year. Manning
caught seven balls for 126 yards
and a touchdown. The Cardinal's
deep threat has remained relatively
silent thus far in '95.
"Brian has played very well,"
Willingham said. "The nature of
the defenses we've played have kind
of kept Brian out of the game just a
little bit. But .is the game plans
change and the teams we face
change over the course of the sea
son, they will offer Brian more
opportunities."
But whether a Stanford victory
comes via the ground or the air
matters very little to most of the
team.
"As long as we keep winning,"
said junior fullback Greg Cornelia,
"1 don't care what happens."
