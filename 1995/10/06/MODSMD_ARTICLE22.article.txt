# Spikers weekend up North
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
After defeating current No. 1 Nebraska, last
year's national runner-up UCLA and four other
teams ranked in the top 25, it may seem impossi
ble to think that the Stanford women's volleyball
team is about to face its stiffest test of the season.
Yet in terms of the Pacific 10 Conference race
and positioning for the NCAA Championships,
that is precisely the challenge Stanford must face
this weekend.
The Cardinal (10-2 overall, 6-0 Pac-10) travels
to Pullman, Wash, tonight to take on No. 7 Wash
ington State (13-0, 5-0) and will leave for Seattle
tomorrow to tackle Washington (6-6, 2-3). The
undefeated Cougars come into this evening's
action a half game behind Stanford. Despite the
Cardinal's position atop the Pac-10, Stanford
coach Don Shaw is quick to point out that Wash
ington State is the hottest team around.
"They're the best team in the conference right
now," Shaw said. "They're a small, quick team.
They keep the ball in play, and they have an
unorthodox style that makes them hard to pre
pare for."
Defeating Washington State, something that
no other team has been able to do t his year, starts
with stopping senior Sarah Silvernail. Silvernail,
a two-time Pac-10 Player of the Week selection, is

simply having an unbelievable sea
son. She leads the Pac-10 in hitting
percentage (.389) and ranks sixth
in blocks at 1.37 per game.
"She's a legitimate National
Player of the Year candidate,"
Shaw said. "She's an awesome hit
ter from the outside."
As if Silvernail weren't enough,
the Cougars' roster also boasts
senior Keren Oigman. Oigman is
second in the conference behind Sil
vernail in hitting percentage, hit
ting at a .382 clip. So far this sea
son, the combination of Silvernail
on one side and Oigman on the
other has proved lethal.
"Right now, Washington State is

as good as any team in the league
and in the country," Shaw said.
"The match will be a big show
down."
Stanford has its own Player of
the Year candidate to use in its
attempt to stop the Cougars. Senior
setter / outside hitter Cary Wendell
is having an even better season
than she had last year, when she
won the Player of the Year award.
Wendell ranks third in the confer
ence in hitting percentage at .364.
She posted seven of the 19 triple
doubles recorded in the entire
nation by Division 1 players this
year. Only one other player, Wendy
Carter of Hall State, has as many as
two.
Stanford also enjoys a huge
advantage in depth over the
Cougars. Outside of Silvernail and
Oigman, WSU has mediocre talent.

Stanford, bolstered by the return of
sophomore Kristin Folkl, has three
All-Americans — Wendell, Folkl
and senior outside hitter Marnie
Treifenbach — and freshman All-
American setter / outside hitter
Lisa Sharpley. That group of play
ers doesn't even include senior out
side hitter Wendy Hromadka, who
leads the team in kills this season
with 127.
As for the Huskies, although
they are struggling, they were pre
dicted to finish third in the Pac-10
this year and are capable of pulling
off a major upset.
"There are no easy games in the
conference any more," Shaw said.
"All these games are tough. Wash
ington plays a totally different type
of game than the Cougars, so it'll be
hard to face the two teams back to
back."
