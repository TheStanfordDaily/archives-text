After defeating current No. 1 Nebraska, last
year's national runner-up UCLA and four other
teams ranked in the top 25, it may seem impossi
ble to think that the Stanford women's volleyball
team is about to face its stiffest test of the season.
Yet in terms of the Pacific 10 Conference race
and positioning for the NCAA Championships,
that is precisely the challenge Stanford must face
this weekend.
The Cardinal (10-2 overall, 6-0 Pac-10) travels
to Pullman, Wash, tonight to take on No. 7 Wash
ington State (13-0, 5-0) and will leave for Seattle
tomorrow to tackle Washington (6-6, 2-3). The
undefeated Cougars come into this evening's
action a half game behind Stanford. Despite the
Cardinal's position atop the Pac-10, Stanford
coach Don Shaw is quick to point out that Wash
ington State is the hottest team around.
"They're the best team in the conference right
now," Shaw said. "They're a small, quick team.
They keep the ball in play, and they have an
unorthodox style that makes them hard to pre
pare for."
Defeating Washington State, something that
no other team has been able to do t his year, starts
with stopping senior Sarah Silvernail. Silvernail,
