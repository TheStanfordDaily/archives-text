# Top polo teams ready to clash
## 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
There arc few greater pleasures for a sports fan
than witnessing a game between the two best teams
in a given sport. Unfortunately, in most "collegiate
sports, these matchups occur more frequently in
rotisserie leagues than in the athletic arena.
Today at 3:00 p.m., such a dream matchup will
take place however, as the No. 2 Cardinal men's
water polo team (12-3, 2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) faces off against No. 1 USC (10-1,1-1) in
a league match.
The game, which will take place at Stanford's
DeGuerre Pool, will be a rematch of the Northern
California Tournament finals, which the Trojans
won last weekend. The match promises to be a fierce
one, as it has assumed critical importance for both
teams.
"This is by far the most important game of the
year for us so far," said Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "1 told the guys that we have to win this
and the rest of our games."
For those unfamiliar with collegiate water polo,
Dettamanti's statements may seem like a doomsday,
fire-and-brimstone sermon, considering that there
are a minimum of 12 games remaining in the season
for the Cardinal. In collegiate water polo, however,
rankings mean everything. This year, unlike past
seasons, only four teams will receive bids to the
NCAA Championships in early December. And with
one of those teams coming from Division II and
another coming from the East Coast, there is abso

lutely no room lor error.
Neither its status as the defending national
champion nor a top-four ranking will assure the Car
dinal of a berth. The only way for Stanford to make
sure that it has a chance to defend its title is by being
one of the top two teams in the powerhouse MPSF.
While the final positions within the league are deter
mined in a conference tournament, the crucial seed
ings for that tournament are based upon the league
games preceding it. For the Cardinal, the next nine
games, all against conference opponents, will likely
determine v.-hether it will see postseason play.
"With every game, the season could be on the
line," Dettamanti said. "We cannot afford to lose to
any of the teams below us, and we really need to beat
thi> teams ahead of us."
When Stanford and USC last met, the officials at
the scoring table had their work cut out for them, as
the two teams combined for 27 goals. The Trojans
succeeded in mounting a come-from-behind over
time victory when Trojan junior Ilrovje Cizmic
snuck a two-point shot past Cardinal goalie Jack
Bowen with 27 seconds remaining in the second
period of extra time.
Dettamanti was not at all surprised to see where
the winning score came from for USC. Cizmic is one
of four Croat ians forming the core of the USC team.
In fact Cizmic, along with junior Marko Zagar and
sophomores Simun Cimerman and Mateo Juric,
have scored 10.'} of the Trojan's 133 points. Shutting
down USC means containing the Croatians.
"Our game plan is to try and
shut down the Croatians, partic
ularly Cizmic, Juric and Zagar,"
Dettamanti said, citing the three
leading scorers for the Trojans. "I
felt that we executed that game
plan fairly well last time, but we
had a few costly mistakes."
The fact that Dettamanti was
relatively pleased with the Cardi
nal effort is evidence of the
respect he has for USC's big
guns, and highlights the difficul
ty of squelching the Trojans'
powerful offense. Last Sunday,
Juric tied Cardinal Jeremy
Laster for the game high with

five points, and Cizmic contribut
ed four.
Limiting the Trojans and their
four core members becomes a
more difficult task considering
the great size of USC's players.
The tale of the tape gives the
advantage in height and weight
to the Trojans' four Croatians, as
compared to the top four scorers
for the Cardinal. The Stanford
players give up a half-inch and
almost fifteen pounds to their
Trojan counterparts.
In the previous encounter,
USC attempted to create even
greater size mismatches by driv
ing men into the two-meter posi
tion in an effort to force some of
the smaller Cardinal players to
guard the crucial spot.
"The guys guarding the hole

have to play tough, and the rest
of them have to do a better job of
helping out," Dettamanti said.
"We really have to tighten our
two-meter defense."
All in all, Dettamanti is confi
dent in his squad's ability to
dethrone the Trojans, and in so
doing regain the No. 1 position in
the polls.
"Now that we have seen USC,
I think that we will definitely be
better prepared. We tend to do
better against a team the second
time," Dettamanti said, citing
victories the Cardinal secured
against both California and UC-
Irvine after early season losses to
those two teams. "USC makes
mistakes too. We just have to be
ready to take advantage of those
mistakes."

seasons, only four teams will receive bids to the
NCAA Championships in early December. And with
one of those teams coming from Division II and
another coming from the East Coast, there is abso

lutely no room lor error.
Neither its status as the defending national
champion nor a top-four ranking will assure the Car
dinal of a berth. The only way for Stanford to make
sure that it has a chance to defend its title is by being
one of the top two teams in the powerhouse MPSF.
While the final positions within the league are deter
mined in a conference tournament, the crucial seed
ings for that tournament are based upon the league
games preceding it. For the Cardinal, the next nine
games, all against conference opponents, will likely
determine v.-hether it will see postseason play.
"With every game, the season could be on the
line," Dettamanti said. "We cannot afford to lose to
any of the teams below us, and we really need to beat
thi> teams ahead of us."
When Stanford and USC last met, the officials at
the scoring table had their work cut out for them, as
the two teams combined for 27 goals. The Trojans
succeeded in mounting a come-from-behind over
time victory when Trojan junior Ilrovje Cizmic
snuck a two-point shot past Cardinal goalie Jack
Bowen with 27 seconds remaining in the second
period of extra time.
Dettamanti was not at all surprised to see where
the winning score came from for USC. Cizmic is one
of four Croat ians forming the core of the USC team.
In fact Cizmic, along with junior Marko Zagar and
sophomores Simun Cimerman and Mateo Juric,
have scored 10.'} of the Trojan's 133 points. Shutting
down USC means containing the Croatians.
"Our game plan is to try and
shut down the Croatians, partic
ularly Cizmic, Juric and Zagar,"
Dettamanti said, citing the three
leading scorers for the Trojans. "I
felt that we executed that game
plan fairly well last time, but we
had a few costly mistakes."
The fact that Dettamanti was
relatively pleased with the Cardi
nal effort is evidence of the
respect he has for USC's big
guns, and highlights the difficul
ty of squelching the Trojans'
powerful offense. Last Sunday,
Juric tied Cardinal Jeremy
Laster for the game high with

five points, and Cizmic contribut
ed four.
Limiting the Trojans and their
four core members becomes a
more difficult task considering
the great size of USC's players.
The tale of the tape gives the
advantage in height and weight
to the Trojans' four Croatians, as
compared to the top four scorers
for the Cardinal. The Stanford
players give up a half-inch and
almost fifteen pounds to their
Trojan counterparts.
In the previous encounter,
USC attempted to create even
greater size mismatches by driv
ing men into the two-meter posi
tion in an effort to force some of
the smaller Cardinal players to
guard the crucial spot.
"The guys guarding the hole

have to play tough, and the rest
of them have to do a better job of
helping out," Dettamanti said.
"We really have to tighten our
two-meter defense."
All in all, Dettamanti is confi
dent in his squad's ability to
dethrone the Trojans, and in so
doing regain the No. 1 position in
the polls.
"Now that we have seen USC,
I think that we will definitely be
better prepared. We tend to do
better against a team the second
time," Dettamanti said, citing
victories the Cardinal secured
against both California and UC-
Irvine after early season losses to
those two teams. "USC makes
mistakes too. We just have to be
ready to take advantage of those
mistakes."
