### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
Ten down, 10 to go.
Having cruised through the
first half of the season, the No. 10
Stanford women's soccer team (7-
3 overall, 1-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) travels to Corvallis, Ore.
this weekend to face the 17th
ranked Beavers of Oregon State
(8-3-0, 2-0) and the Arkansas
Razorbacks (5-5-1) in a three
team tournament.
The Cardinal is coming off a
heart-breaking loss to top-ranked
North Carolina at last weekend's
Stanford Nike Invitational. The
nine-time defending national
champion Tarheels exploded for
three goals in a span of less than
four minutes to bury Stanford's
hopes for an upset. Despite the
loss, the Cardinal still climbed
one notch in the polls.
"Obviously, everybody was dis
appointed with the loss," said
senior defender Jessica Fischer of
the 3-0 shutout. "But we realize
at the same time that other than
scoring, we did the things that we
needed to do. It's an easy thing to
take away with you because you
know that if we'd just finished
our chances, we would've won the
game."
Stanford has certainly posted
some impressive wins this year,
including a 3-0 shutout of ninth

ranked Vanderbilt and a 3-0
blanking of Texas last weekend.
The team has also struggled at
times, however, most blatantly in
a disappointing loss to nearby
rival Santa Clara. But the women
see last weekend's games as a step
in the right direction.
"It was a good turning point
for us for the rest of the season,"
Fischer said. "We possessed the
way that we wanted to possess,
we worked the bail in the back.
We're confident going into the
weekend. This is a big tourna
ment for us as far as the Pac-10."
As always, the Cardinal will
look offensively to senior mid
fielders Carmel Murphy and Denn
Dey, as well as junior forward
Erin Martin and freshman Kelly
Adamson. The four players have
combined for 17 of Stanford's 21
goals (including seven game-win
ners) and 11 of the team's 18
assists. Murphy leads the team
with 16 total points on six goals
and four assists, with Dey close
behind at 14 on five goals and
four assists. Defensively, fresh
man goalie Erin Bryla boasts a
0.88 goals-against average and
has tallied six shutouts.
Oregon State will try to regain
its feet after suffering two losses
in its last three games, including a
2-0 shutout at the hands of third

started the season on fire, chalk

including a 2-1 victory over then-
No. 9 Connecticut, before drop
ping three of their next six con

tests.
Arkansas, meanwhile, will cer
tainly have its work cut out with
two matches versus top 25 teams.
"This is the first time we have
gone into a series of games as the
clear underdog," said Razorbacks
coach Janet Rayfield. "We enter
these two games with no expecta
tions from anyone and that could
go to work in our favor."

The Lady Razorbacks feature
senior Kathy Krupa and juniors
Alexis Hyrup and Andie Hickman.
Hyrup lead the team with 12 total
points, while Krupa ranks ninth
in the nation in assists with six.
