# Male kickers look to snap winless streak

The Stanford men's soccer team (3-5-1) will
journey north along the rugged Pacific Coast
to challenge the Oregon State Beavers (6-3-2)
today and the Washington Huskies (4-2-1) on
Sunday. The Cardinal is coming off of a dra
matic last-minute tie with Massachusetts last
Sunday, but remains winless in its last five
matches.
The Cardinal expects to end that drought
up north this weekend. "I hope that we can
demonstrate competitiveness, especially now
that we are entering league play," said head
coach Colin Lindores. In the last few games,
Stanford has been plagued by inconsistency,

allowing the opposition to score too many
goals. However, the Cardinal has played with
gritty intensity rather than desperation in the
waning moments of close games.
Sophomore Eric Vandevelde leads Stanford
with three goals and three assists, and senior
Ryan Estevez has also added three goals. The
Cardinal also relies on the contributions of
freshman standouts Jon Bruck, Aaron Jones
and A.J. Sauer. Yet, the aspect of the game
most critical to the team's success is defense.
Look for the Cardinal to pad the victory col
umn if the defense, led by team co-captain
Chet Zimmer, comes together to fill defensive
holes.
On the other side of the ball, Oregon State
enters the game having won four of its last five

contests. A bundle of Beavers spearhead Ore
gon State in scoring. Freshmen J.l\ Capodan
no and Fredrik Kummernes and sophomores
Simon Date and Josh Dodson have notched
three goals each. Oregon State's redshirt
freshman goalkeeper Colin McMillen has an
outstanding goals-against average of 1.56 per
game with 31 total saves.
Poor sportsmanship marred last year's
match between Stanford and Oregon State.
After the referees had issued four red cards,
the Beavers walked off the field before the
game had ended. Despite the abbreviated
game, Stanford slapped Oregon State with
four goals while allowing only one, and was
credited with the win.
As for the Huskies, they, liki
the Beavers, are on a roll, having
beaten four of their last five oppo
nents. The Huskies have been pro

pelled by the fabulous play of
sophomores Jason Boyce, Ryan
Edwards and Bill May. Boyce has
scored nine of his 12 points in the
last two weeks of competition,
while Edwards has registered a
goal in four of the past five match
es. May had recorded three consec
utive shutouts prior to last week
end. The goalkeeper currently

boasts a 1.33 goals-against average
while playing 97 percent of the
team's minutes.
The Cardinal will begin league
play on the road against two teams
riding the momentum of multiple
victories. The task would appear
daunting to most teams, but Stan
ford has played its best soccer in
situations even less promising.
