Live from Stanford Uni
versity, where grapes are
only acceptable if they
are an ingredient in the wine
served at a Friday night
MEChA shindig, it's week three
of NCAA college football picks
and pokes.
Yon may know my sidekick
for this week best as the
adorable Kevin Arnold on tele
vision's "The Wonder Years,"
or yon may be most familiar
with him as a member of the
SAE fraternity. Either way, you
are no doubt unfamiliar with
Fred Savage's ability to predict
the outcome of college football
contests. Here is his second
shot iti as many years to expand
his horizon of fame and for
tune:
Stanford at Arizona State
The true test of the Cardinal
squad has arrived. Now that
classes at Stanford have begun
and the studying has begun,
can the team compete with ath
letes from ASU, who are as aca
demically oriented during the
season as the aluminum goal
posts in Sun Devil Stadium?
In its first game since the
commencement of the school
year, Stanford shouldn't have
any problems with an Arizona
State sqund that seems to think
defense is the French word for a
wood or chain link partition
separating the lawns of two
homes.
And now that Drill Sergeant
Willingham has whipped his
boys into shape, it will be inter
esting to see if Stanford's
offense can exploit the gargan

tuan cracks in Arizona State's
line and secondary.
"ASU got a drubbing from
SC," Fred said, referring to the
Sun Devils' 31-0 spanking last
weekend by the Trojans. In
that game, ASU gave up over
500 yards of offense, turned the
ball over twice and failed to
complete even 50 percent of its
passes.
Fred predicts Stanford's
momentum will propel it to a
victory. "Our winning streak
will hold and we'll come out
undefeated."
I agree, as long as the squad
hasn't been overly confident
and gotten any smart ideas, like
trying to study and attend
classes this week instead of
preparing for the Sun Devils.
Looks like the Cardinal's
undefeated record will live to
see the light of another day
although the clouds may be
rolling in next weekend.

Now that USC's primary
rusher has been chased off the
squad for NCAA violations, the
Trojans have begun shiftingthe
offensive focus to the passing
game. Last weekend, they
launched an air attack against
Arizona State that made the
payload of the Enola Gay look
like an amateur backyard fire
works display.

of this contest. "I hate both teams
with a passion," he says. "Cal
sucks. Begrudgingly, I'll say the
Trojans will win."
The Bears might be kidding
themselves if they hope to even
score a touchdown in this game,
considering the fact that USC has
allowed a total of only 27 points in
four games. Now that's protec
tion of the goal.

Oregon State at Washington
St ate
Check out the Cougars! Only
got beat at Nebraska by 14 points
last week. That says a lot about
the quality of the Pac-10 — if we
get beat by less than three touch
downs by any ranked squad not
on the West Coast, it's considered
a victory.
"OSU hasn't done much this
year," Fred says. He continues
with the understatement of all
statements. "This isn't going to
be a very exciting game."

I'd sooner watch grass grow
and wine age than stick to the
television for this game.
At this point I'd like to amend
an old maxim my grandfather
taught me: There are only four
things that I have to do in life:
eat, breathe, pay taxes and bet
against the Beavers. The laws of
nature require the first two, the
laws of government call for the
third and the laws of reason com
mand the fourth.

Notre Dame at Washington
While Notre Dame was giving
Ohio State a run for its money
last week, the Huskies were
simultaneously playing what
some would call a "competitive
football game" with Oregon
State. Fred bets that Notre Dame
will "come out with heads hung
low." I bet that the Huskies will
go back to the locker room with
their heads hung in a noose.

score a touchdown in this game,
considering the fact that USC has
allowed a total of only 27 points in
four games. Now that's protec
tion of the goal.
Fred: USC by 13
Me: USC by 24
Oregon State at Washington
St ate
Check out the Cougars! Only
got beat at Nebraska by 14 points
last week. That says a lot about
the quality of the Pac-10 — if we
get beat by less than three touch
downs by any ranked squad not
on the West Coast, it's considered
a victory.
"OSU hasn't done much this
year," Fred says. He continues
with the understatement of all
statements. "This isn't going to
be a very exciting game."

I'd sooner watch grass grow
and wine age than stick to the
television for this game.
At this point I'd like to amend
an old maxim my grandfather
taught me: There are only four
things that I have to do in life:
eat, breathe, pay taxes and bet
against the Beavers. The laws of
nature require the first two, the
laws of government call for the
third and the laws of reason com
mand the fourth.
Fred: Washington State by 11
Me: Washington State by 10
Notre Dame at Washington
While Notre Dame was giving
Ohio State a run for its money
last week, the Huskies were
simultaneously playing what
some would call a "competitive
football game" with Oregon
State. Fred bets that Notre Dame
will "come out with heads hung
low." I bet that the Huskies will
go back to the locker room with
their heads hung in a noose.
Fred: Washington by 1
