You didn't read it here first, folks: O.J.'s free. That's right! If
you've waded through enough media mire to find my column,
you already know that Orenthal James Simpson has been
acquitted of murder. What's more, just like Dr. Richard Kimble of
"The Fugitive", The Juice has vowed to track down his wife's real
killers who are "out there somewhere."
Hut did you also know that yesterday the Pope addressed the Unit
ed Nations, Texas executed its 100 th inmate since HJH2 and alcohol afi
cionados began celebrating the Great American Beer Festival XIV®?
Welcome to the Farm, or welcome hack, as the case may be. If you're
hip to the current events, I beseech you, take a moment or two to fill
in your friends. After all, they, too, deserve to know of the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks.
(Non-frosh: Ido not intend to alienate, hut this is old hat you can
skip ahead one paragraph.) Now, then: My dear, sweet frosh, you're
probably wondering why I'm talking like this, if not wondering what
I'm talking about. Apathy, babe. I'm talking about awareness, or the
lack thereof. You see, here at Stanford, we don't know what happens
Out There (the elusive environment that is everywhere hut Ivory
Tower). Repeat after me, We don't know.
If it doesn't involve tiger salamanders, it's not news.
My now, you've experienced the phenomenon. (lomc clean. Admit il.
Staring at that Middle East article while munching your morning gra
nola, you can't help hut think about the lust-object in your 1:15 class
and ... mmmm, good granola. Orville Reddenbacher dead? Huh?
Sure, the headlines sound familiar, but they don't ring the right bells.
I feel a bit like the Reagan Administration during Iran-Gate. What
can I say to the Senate subcommittee? Current events are out of the
question. "Did you hear about the house manager who doesn't wear
pants? .. . What? .. . War with Bosnia? Wow . . Where's Bosnia?"
Let's face it, I'm a cocktail party leper.
But wait, there's more! My parents are in on the conspiracy too. As
are yours. Think about it . . . How many times has dad "forgotten" to
tell you that a loved one recently passed away / passed a gall stone/
passed the bar / Unabombed? "I didn't want to worry you during mid
terms," Sound familiar? "It's better you find out this way."
Four years later?
Thanksgiving, freshman year, I went home to find my bedroom
gutted and the ceiling removed. (This isn't newspaper column-hyper
bole. When my parents remodel they pull out all the stops. You could
see stars from where my bed had been. I slept on the living room
floor.)
"Mother and 1 didn't want to worrv you . . ." Father began. 1

praised him for his initia
tive but recommended he
wait out the rainy season
next time. (Here I exag
gerate.)
I remain ignorant.
Sure I've met my distri
bution requirements, I've

read my fair share of Nietzsche . . . but I've backlogged four years of
Connie Chung. She's still on NBC, right?
Perhaps we ignore Out There because, In Here, we completely
immerse ourselves in Stanford Stuff. We are made of Stanford Stuff.
Like fro yo.
So, how do I spend my time? Frat parties? Please, the guys won't
give me a second-glance. Too much body hair. Not enough estrogen.
Homework? If you're one of my professors reading this article, you're
deluding yourself. Sex'i Sex-in-the-90s is a great idea, I hope to have
some. If my writing style turns you on, call me.
We'll go out for coffee and I'll ask probing questions such as, "Does
Stanford really live up to your expectations?" Like a good (feneration-
A'er, you'll probably recall those early-'Bos cheeseball daytime TV
technical institute commercials where the screen splits in two:

Preppy college boy
blockaded behind a dozen text
books the size of toaster ovens,
sighs, flips up his pink
collar and whimpers, "While I'm
studying the past — my kid
brother's working on the future."
I le slits his wrists.

Pimply pubescent
clad in t-shirt resembling tuxedo
top, solders together a supercom
puter and, with a sidelong glance
at his sibling, says something
about landing a lucrative, exciting
job right out of hitrh school.

Those commercials always gave me t he creeps. What about the pre
sent? For now, I'm going to roll myself into a fetal position and rock
back and forth until my Weekly Reader subscription comes in.

Jason Wish now is a senior majoring in something that will not land
him a job come June He only started following the O.J. trial Monday
because he needed material for a snappy opening to this article. Mr.
Wishnow eagerly anticipates Mr. Simpson's pursuit of the One-Armed
Man.

My now, you've experienced the phenomenon. (lomc clean. Admit il.
Staring at that Middle East article while munching your morning gra
nola, you can't help hut think about the lust-object in your 1:15 class
and ... mmmm, good granola. Orville Reddenbacher dead? Huh?
Sure, the headlines sound familiar, but they don't ring the right bells.
I feel a bit like the Reagan Administration during Iran-Gate. What
can I say to the Senate subcommittee? Current events are out of the
question. "Did you hear about the house manager who doesn't wear
pants? .. . What? .. . War with Bosnia? Wow . . Where's Bosnia?"
Let's face it, I'm a cocktail party leper.
But wait, there's more! My parents are in on the conspiracy too. As
are yours. Think about it . . . How many times has dad "forgotten" to
tell you that a loved one recently passed away / passed a gall stone/
passed the bar / Unabombed? "I didn't want to worry you during mid
terms," Sound familiar? "It's better you find out this way."
Four years later?
Thanksgiving, freshman year, I went home to find my bedroom
gutted and the ceiling removed. (This isn't newspaper column-hyper
bole. When my parents remodel they pull out all the stops. You could
see stars from where my bed had been. I slept on the living room
floor.)
"Mother and 1 didn't want to worrv you . . ." Father began. 1

praised him for his initia

wait out the rainy season
next time. (Here I exag
gerate.)
I remain ignorant.
Sure I've met my distri
bution requirements, I've

read my fair share of Nietzsche . . . but I've backlogged four years of
Connie Chung. She's still on NBC, right?
Perhaps we ignore Out There because, In Here, we completely
immerse ourselves in Stanford Stuff. We are made of Stanford Stuff.
Like fro yo.
So, how do I spend my time? Frat parties? Please, the guys won't
give me a second-glance. Too much body hair. Not enough estrogen.
Homework? If you're one of my professors reading this article, you're
deluding yourself. Sex'i Sex-in-the-90s is a great idea, I hope to have
some. If my writing style turns you on, call me.
We'll go out for coffee and I'll ask probing questions such as, "Does
Stanford really live up to your expectations?" Like a good (feneration-
A'er, you'll probably recall those early-'Bos cheeseball daytime TV
technical institute commercials where the screen splits in two:

Preppy college boy
blockaded behind a dozen text
books the size of toaster ovens,
sighs, flips up his pink
collar and whimpers, "While I'm
studying the past — my kid
brother's working on the future."
I le slits his wrists.

Pimply pubescent
clad in t-shirt resembling tuxedo
top, solders together a supercom
puter and, with a sidelong glance
at his sibling, says something
about landing a lucrative, exciting
job right out of hitrh school.

Those commercials always gave me t he creeps. What about the pre
sent? For now, I'm going to roll myself into a fetal position and rock
back and forth until my Weekly Reader subscription comes in.

Jason Wish now is a senior majoring in something that will not land
him a job come June He only started following the O.J. trial Monday
because he needed material for a snappy opening to this article. Mr.

Man.
