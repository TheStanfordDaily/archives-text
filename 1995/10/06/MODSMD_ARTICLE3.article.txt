# No promises of confidentiality
## Changing policy would require RAs to report harassment cases 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
If approached with a case of
possible sexual harassment, resi
dent assistants and resident fel
lows can no longer promise confi
dentiality.
The new policy was part of this
year's RAt raining, although it has
not received final approval from
the Faculty Senate, said Sexual
Harassment ('oordinating Adviser
Laraine Zappert.
Revisions to the 1993 sexual ha
rassment policy will continue to be
discussed throughout the year,
Zappert said. Forming a sexual ha
rassment task force this year to re
view and revise the policy was a
proviso of the original policy of
1993.
During the RA training ses
sions, Zappert said, she had to ex
plicitly tell the RAs that they could
not promise blanket confidentiali
ty to their residents.
"The RAs have responsibilities
that go beyond that of a normal
peer," Zappert said. "If they

promise confidentiality to their
residents it could very well be
detrimental to the resident," she
said.
Zappert explained that the same
philosophy that requires RAs to re
port possibly suicidal statements
also applies to reporting cases of
sexual harassment. If the RA has
information about a sexual offend
er, the RA must report this name
to the residence dean.
The training is part of an ongo
ing effort by the University to
train all faculty and staff, Zappert
said. She has trained RAs, RFsand
about three-quarters of the faculty
in their responsibilities under the
evolving policy.
In the course of the training,
Zappert said, she informs faculty
and staff about their obligations if
t hey are witnesses to, victims of or
accused of sexual harassment.
According to Zappert, it is vital
to give proper training to those of
ficials who may have to deal with
sexual harassment cases because
