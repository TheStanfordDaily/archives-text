# No promises of confidentiality
## Changing policy would require RAs to report harassment cases 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
If approached with a case of
possible sexual harassment, resi
dent assistants and resident fel
lows can no longer promise confi
dentiality.
The new policy was part of this
year's RAt raining, although it has
not received final approval from
the Faculty Senate, said Sexual
Harassment ('oordinating Adviser
Laraine Zappert.
Revisions to the 1993 sexual ha
rassment policy will continue to be
discussed throughout the year,
Zappert said. Forming a sexual ha
rassment task force this year to re
view and revise the policy was a
proviso of the original policy of
1993.
During the RA training ses
sions, Zappert said, she had to ex
plicitly tell the RAs that they could
not promise blanket confidentiali
ty to their residents.
"The RAs have responsibilities
that go beyond that of a normal
peer," Zappert said. "If they

promise confidentiality to their
residents it could very well be
detrimental to the resident," she
said.
Zappert explained that the same
philosophy that requires RAs to re
port possibly suicidal statements
also applies to reporting cases of
sexual harassment. If the RA has
information about a sexual offend
er, the RA must report this name
to the residence dean.
The training is part of an ongo
ing effort by the University to
train all faculty and staff, Zappert
said. She has trained RAs, RFsand
about three-quarters of the faculty
in their responsibilities under the
evolving policy.
In the course of the training,
Zappert said, she informs faculty
and staff about their obligations if
t hey are witnesses to, victims of or
accused of sexual harassment.
According to Zappert, it is vital
to give proper training to those of
ficials who may have to deal with
sexual harassment cases because
if such cases are handled incor
rectly, "it is a nightmare," she
said.
RAs had mixed views about
the change in definition of their
duties.
"I am there to listen and be a
friend," said Inger Powell, an RA
in Muwekma-Tah-Ruk. "But
there is only so much I can do. In
the long run, you have to think
about the victims themselves,"
she said, explaining that after a
case of harassment it is often ben
eficial for a victim to receive
counseling or professional help.
Other RAs expressed greater
hesitation.
"In theory it is a good policy,"
said Ryan Kskin, an RAin 557
Mayfield. "In application, the
direction that Residential Educa
tion is taking leads me to be con
cerned," he said. However, he
added that he was appreciative of
the fact that the policy gives him
the resources to make sure that
the safety of his residents is not
compromised.
The responsibility of the sexu
al harassment task force, led by
Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter, is to see that the policy is

working and to make what
changes are necessary to create a
more viable policy, said Zappert.
Another responsibility of the
task force is to make sure com
plaints are handled professionally
and efficiently. "Complaints that
are not handled well can be dev
astating to a victim, extremely
damaging to an institution and
often unfairly punitive to a
harasser," said Political Science
Prof. Terry Karl, who was inte
grally involved in the 1993 effort
to revise Stanford's harassment
policies.
Zappert, whose position was
created as a result of the 1993
policy change, said she is both
pleased with Stanford's progress
and aware that improvements
can always be made to heighten
University awareness about sexu
al harassment and assault.
"I have seen a tremendous
increase in awareness that never
existed before and a real desire on
the part of the community to
make it work," Zappert said.
Before Zappert was hired, the
University did not have a central
ized system for reporting sexual
harassment grievances and cases
were seldom reported. With
improved re[>orting however, Zap
pert said she received 79 allega
tions in the period between Decem
ber 1993 and December 1994.
