# Slow e-mail woes to end with new computers
## 
### Adrian Keatinge-Clay 
Students have been complaining of slow
e-mail for several weeks. But with the ar
rival of new equipment today, the problem
should soon disappear.
The delay can be explained by an un
precedented increase in volume, said Roi
Burback, manager of distributed comput
ing at Stanford. The amount of mail han
dled has seen "more than ;i 600 percent in
crease from a year ago," he said.
"With over a million messages per week
now being sent to Stanford's servers, then
has been a tremendous amount of over
How," Burback said. "This Tuesday alone
Stanford's six e-mail servers had to tackle
over 300,000 messages; it was necessary t<

roll over (send 011 Wednesday) 50,01)0 of
them."
Burback is installing two new computers
t his morning. 'I hc machines, which he calls
"monstrous pieces of iron," should speed up
the University's overworked network
servers.
Stanford's network is currently run on
Sun Microsystems hardware; the four older
servers are Sun 20-sls and the four newer
servers are Sun 20-7ls.
All four Sun 20-71s were just purchased
this year, Burback said. Each is equipped
with 250 megabytes of RAM and contains
t he fastest < "I'll on t he market.
More machines oft hat configuration will
be delivered in three weeks, Burback said.
Homework for one history class was sup-

posed to have been assigned via e-mail, but
students did not get the in format ion in time
due to the backup, Burback said.
The Distributed Computing Group has
fielded many similar complaints, he said.
Burback warned about a new danger,
which he called "mail spams." Spams are of
fensive messages, usually containing sexist
or racist materials, sent to large numbers of
people.
Burback said that while such messages
are usually irritat ing and offensive, it is im
portant not to reply back to them. The
length of the message and the number of re
cipients creates a very high load on the
servers.
By Monday morning, e-mail service
should be back to normal. Burback said that

no messages were lost altogether in the sys
tem, only delayed.
Burback pointed out that Stanford has
one of the most advanced e-mail systems in
the country. From Stanford, messages are
usually sent to their destinations in mil
liseconds, while at some other universities,
outgoing messages leave just once an hour.
"There are 30,000 accounts opened up
here on campus, and only a limited number
of servers, so we must be mindful of the
ways we use e-mail," Burback cautioned.
Cuts in funding make it hard to keep up
with the larger volumes of e-mail, but new
methods of organization are being devel
oped to make the best use of Stanford's fa-
cilitics, Burback said.
Most servers have a life of
three years; they are then dis
tributed to different places where
they will prove useful, he said.
Some of the older servers are
being put to use in Meyer
Library.
When there are slowdowns,
Burback recommends sending e
mail in the morning, when the
network load is lower.
