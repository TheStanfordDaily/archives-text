In a speech to the Stanford His
torical Society yesterday, University
President Gerhard Casper discussed
the history of the University motto
and its continued importance.
In his speech to about 60 people
in the Tresidder's Oak West Room,
Casper discussed his "ongoing re
search" into the history of Stan
ford's motto, "die Luf't (ler Frciheit
weht," or "the winds of freedom
blow."
According to Casper, the motto
has a long history which dates hack
to the University's first president,
David Starr Jordan, whoclosely fol
lowed the scholarship of a Kith cen
t ury German humanist scholar, Ul
rich von Hutten.
Hutten was one of the first, ac
cording to Casper, to realize "that
religion was individual, not collec

tive." In the spirit of t his question
ing, critical age, Hutten coined the
phrase "die Luf't der Frciheit" or
"the winds of freedom."
Casper said the motto was never
formally adopted by t In* faculty, but
instead came into common use
through the urgings of Jordan.
Jordan felt the motto was ap
plicable to Stanford in many sens
es, but he originally brought the
phrase to the University in sup
port of an elect ive system of course
selection. According to Casper,
Jordan said, "Freedom is as essen
tial to college selection as man
hood. The free air of an American
school is the one good thing."
The phrase has not always re
mained in constant use as t he Uni
versity's motto. During World
War I, the motto was criticized by
some who objected to its German
roots.
The phrase fell out of favor
briefly but was revived by some who
recognized th;it the phrase defend
ed important human values,
Casper said.
The motto has continued in its
informal capacity at Stanford and
now appears on the seal of the Uni
versity and the president's sta
tionery.
Casper is anxious to continue
the slogan's revival. He said, "In
days like these where intolerance
and public suspicion are so easily
fanned into flame, the University
must stand behind the danger
ously exposed individual schol
ar. . . . 'Let the winds of freedom
blow' blows away t he slogans t hat
stifle academic freedom and de
bate."
