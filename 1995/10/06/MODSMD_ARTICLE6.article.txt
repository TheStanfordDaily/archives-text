## Hoover fellow McNamara discusses corruption in justice system

I he 10 long months of t ho ().J
Simpson trial uro finally over.
However, allegedly corrupt law
enforcement epitomized by

Mark Fuhrman surfaced dur
ing the case, and calls for its re
formation have only just begun.
This corrupt ion is growing, ac
cording to Joseph McNamara, a
Hoover fellow and a former San
Jose Police chief.

"Police have a monopoly on
unlawful use of force. We both
need and fear them," he said.
"We have allowed police to iso
late themselves from society,"
said McNamara. "Current prob
lems stem from the distinct po

lice culture in conflict with essen
tial goals."
As a result, police corruption
has increased greatly over the
past decade, he said.
"There are so many cases,
from top-rank officers to the bot
tom. And the seriousness of the
misconduct is increasing, such as
incidents of robberies and mur
ders," said McNamara.
Even more disturbing is that
corruption is usually discovered by
groups from outside the agency,
McNamara added. The lack of self
scrutiny within the police depart
ment contributes to problem.
For example, it took an ama
teur video cameraman to call at
tention to the Rodney King beat
ing and a screenwriter to alert
the nation to Fuhrman's racist
remarks. McNamara said he be
lieves that the police themselves
should have brought these issues
to light.
"The average policeman, who
is not racist or corrupt, but does
not report problems, is a co-con
spirator with a 'bad' cop," said
McNamara. "The code of silence
creates criminals in uniform."
This mentality is rooted in fed
eral policy on drugs, McNamara
said.
"By calling it a 'war on drugs,'
police believe they can use de
structive, illegal methods," he
said.
The war on drugs has come at
a terrible price that it's not
worth, McNamara said. "It ere

ates criminal corruption around
the world. For HO years, they've
done more of what has not
worked."
Moreover, public concern over
a corrupt legal system has grown
as well, McNamara said.
"Recent cases reveal a massive
betrayal of trust. In the O.J.
Simpson trial, the disparity in the
polls between African Americans
and whites reflects a lot of dis
trust among minorities," he said.
The lack of faith in the police
has severe consequences for the
justice system, by impeding the
components necessary for a suc
cessful trial, McNamara said.
At the most basic level, "police
are unaware of the crime unless a
citizen reports it," McNamara
said.
Secondly, "people need to give
testimony during the trial."
However, "they won't if they

can't find any difference between
cops and criminals," said McNa
mara.
Furthermore, to accept the
evidence, "the jury needs to
believe that the police are truth
ful," McNamara added, citing the
O.J. Simpson case. "No doubt, all
over the country, the defense will
use scandals about evidence in
their strategy."
Reform of the justice system is
possible. During the Civil Rights
movement of the 19605, the police
underwent a monumental period
of self-scrutiny.
"The national consciousness
was raised," McNamara said.
"For 20 years, there was a steady
period of reform due to the atten
tion focused on the departments."
Similarly, present public pres
sure now calls for police to re
examine themselves, and to find
alternatives to current policy,
McNamara said.
McNamara, former police chief
of San Jose for fifteen years,
began an innovative program of
community partnership there.

"When I first got there, the San
Jose Police department was called
the 'little L.A.P.D.' I had to turn
around that mindset," he said.
The San .Jose Police attempted
to learn how to better address the
problems and concerns of the citi
zens of San Jose, McNamara said.
"San Jose is city of diverse cul
tures, with a majority of minori
ties," McNamara explained. "A
racist or prejudiced cop, who
would look down upon members
of a community, should never
work."
McNamara instituted talks
between officers and community
leaders.
"We listened to citizen groups,
who complained about the land
lords who wouldn't fix a broken
window, about the trash in the
streets, about the automobiles
abandoned in their neighbor
hoods, about the drug dealers
who dealt with impunity," McNa
mara said.
The police worked toward solv
ing those problems by "entering a
partnership with the people to

work against those conditions,
which allowed people to take back
their neighborhood," he said.
In addition, McNamara took
the position that "we should stop
treating drug users as criminals
and locking them up.
"That just worsens the prob
lem by increasing the profit for
drug dealers and crooked cops,"
he said.
McNamara praised both the
community and police in their
efforts. "It takes a lot of commit
ment to combat those feelings of
helplessness."
As a result of the reform, "San
Jose has the lowest crime rate of
any major city. The police have a
genuine respect and admiration
for the community, which is
returned," McNamara said.
McNamara contrasted San
Jose with Los Angeles. "In L.A.,
the military method has caused
crime to continue to spiral," he
said.
"The foundation for police
reform lies within a partnership
with the community," he said.
