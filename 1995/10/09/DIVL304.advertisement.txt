There must be some way
to avoid doing the same thing
for the next forty years.
Life's been pretty good so far. You've kept
moving—taken all the right steps along the
way (for the most part). And now you're
ready for the biggest step.
You'll be getting your degree from a top
school. You're about to find a great job.
The question is: which job? And will it
have the potential to interest you for a
whole career?
You've probably heard the story of the
job applicant who said he was a shoe
salesman with fifteen years experience.
"No," corrected the recruiter interviewing
him, "you've had six months experience
thirty times."
Isn't there some way to keep challenging
yourself in new and different areas?
Andersen Consulting offers you the oppor
tunity to work on a variety of projects—with
clients in a wide range of industries.
We are the leader in helping organiza
tions apply information technology to their
business advantage. Every hour of every
business day, we implement a solution
to help one of our more than 5,000
clients worldwide.
What makes that possible is the quality
of our people. And the quality of our train
ing. We're known for both.
Because business and technology
are ever-changing, we see training as a
continuing process. And our $123-million
Center for Professional Education in St.
Charles, Illinois, is just one measure of our
commitment. We train you for a career —
not just a job.
Does the idea of forty years of knowing
exactly what you'll be doing each week
scare you? Then don't settle for that.
Demand challenge and variety. Come talk
to us. And find out more about a career
with Andersen Consulting.
