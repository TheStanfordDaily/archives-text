# No assignment
## EV parking shift bothers residents 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
The Transportation Office's
decision to end assigned parking
in parts of Escondido Village has
left some residents dissatisfied.
According to Jeffrey Tumlin,
project manager for the Trans
portation Office, the new parking
plan eliminates assigned parking
spaces in all singles and couples
areas.
The change comes in response
to an unusually high number of
complaints about the parking sit
uation in Escondido last year,
Tumlin said.
Most complaints about the old
system addressed residents' con
cerns that other drivers violated
the system of assigned parking
spaces, Tumlin said.
All spaces will now require a
permit that validates the parking.
Under the new plan, visitors are
required to display a scratch-off,
one-day permit that allows them
to park in the area, he said.
Each resident will receive five
complimentary scratch-off visitor
passes, but will be required to pur
chase any additional passes at a $ 1
charge per permit.
Some of the previous violations
occurred when spaces were filled
by commuters who take the Mar
guerite shuttle to work, while
other spaces were occupied by vis
itors to the area, Tumlin said.
"It was a domino effect," he
said. "When one resident's as
signed space was taken by another
vehicle, he would park in a differ
ent assigned space."
According to Tumlin, some res
idents even reported fist fights
and car doors being keyed as re
sult of parking disputes. "A few of

these particularly annoyed resi
dents, working with the Escondi
do staff, organized biweekly meet
ings" aimed at identifying prob
lems and formulating parking so
lutions, Tumlin said.
Attempt at solution
The 30-member group issued a
set of recommendations to the
Transportation Office which out
lined its plan for a new parking
system, Tumlin said. "These rec
ommendations in combination
with graduate resident assistant
input were considered in the final
plan."
Although Tumlin said the
Transportation Office evaluated
the plan according to issues of
fairness, simplicity, enforceability
and cost-effectiveness, some of
the Escondido residents are not
content with the policy and are
taking action to remove the new
system from their area.
In fact, more than 70 percent of
the residents in Hoskins Court
have signed a petition in favor of
reinstating the assigned parking
spaces for both the high-rise and
low-rise parking in the area, said
Brian Holloway, a graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering
who lives in the area.
Holloway and his neighbors,
Lorie and Nolan Glantz, adminis
tered the petition to the Hoskins
residents in response to concerns
about the new plan's effects on
their area.
"There are many issues in
volved here," Holloway said.
Hoskins Court houses one of only
two computer clusters in the Es
condido area, and this system may
encourage other residents to drive
their cars to use the computers
Concerns about solution
Because of the increased num
her of cars in t he area, I loskins res
idents may have to "park in anoth
er court,"he said. "As a safety
issue for women and children, this
| possibility I is not appropriate
Holloway said he is also con
cerned with a more general sense of
community in the area. "In
I loskins, we were respecting the
numbers," he said. "We park near
our neighbors,'" which preserves a
community environment and pro
motes safety considerations, lie said
"I want to know who is parking
around us," said Kathyrn Mar
tine/, who is another concerned
resident in the area

For Holloway, the primary issue
is that the Hoskins residents were
never consulted about the changes
in the area "The committee did
not advise the Transportation
Office to remove the I assigned
spaces] in Hoskins, they gave the
(iRAs authorits to make the deci
sion," and they made a decision
contrary to t lie resident s opinions
here, he said.
"It seems like the most logical
thing to do i to formulate polic\
according to our opinions," Hol
loway said.
"It's ridiculous to change a
great system," said Katherine
Kisenhut, another resident in the
1 loskins area.
Debbie Wood, a new resident in
Hoskins Court, was concerned
about the additional parking
expense "My only problem [with
the plan I is that there are no slots
for visitors. I have a sister who visits
iruÂ» iif'ten :m<l MOW I llilVe to bllV

these extra tickets for her," she said.
Holloway admitted that the
Transportation Office has been
willing to listen to these com
plaints. Me said, however, that
they "did not recognize the peti
tion."
Tumlin said one of the major
difficulties in devising a new plan
was the polarity among the resi
dents involved. "We knew that no
matter what we did, one group of
people would he very upset."
Tumlin said parking problems
associated with the Hoskins com
puter cluster was a point that the
Transportation Office would take
very seriously. "We don't want to
displace Hoskins residents," he
said. "Hut so f;ir, we've seen little
evidence that there's a problem."
Tumlin said that he hopes the
situation can be resolved. "It sad
dens me that people are putting so
much energy into this rather than
their studies," he said.
