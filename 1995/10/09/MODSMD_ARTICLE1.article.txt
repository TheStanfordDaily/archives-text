# No assignment
## EV parking shift bothers residents 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
The Transportation Office's
decision to end assigned parking
in parts of Escondido Village has
left some residents dissatisfied.
According to Jeffrey Tumlin,
project manager for the Trans
portation Office, the new parking
plan eliminates assigned parking
spaces in all singles and couples
areas.
The change comes in response
to an unusually high number of
complaints about the parking sit
uation in Escondido last year,
Tumlin said.
Most complaints about the old
system addressed residents' con
cerns that other drivers violated
the system of assigned parking
spaces, Tumlin said.
All spaces will now require a
permit that validates the parking.
Under the new plan, visitors are
required to display a scratch-off,
one-day permit that allows them
to park in the area, he said.
Each resident will receive five
complimentary scratch-off visitor
passes, but will be required to pur
chase any additional passes at a $ 1
charge per permit.
Some of the previous violations
occurred when spaces were filled
by commuters who take the Mar
guerite shuttle to work, while
other spaces were occupied by vis
itors to the area, Tumlin said.
"It was a domino effect," he
said. "When one resident's as
signed space was taken by another
vehicle, he would park in a differ
ent assigned space."
According to Tumlin, some res
idents even reported fist fights
and car doors being keyed as re
sult of parking disputes. "A few of

these particularly annoyed resi
dents, working with the Escondi
do staff, organized biweekly meet
ings" aimed at identifying prob
lems and formulating parking so
lutions, Tumlin said.
Attempt at solution
The 30-member group issued a
set of recommendations to the
Transportation Office which out
lined its plan for a new parking
system, Tumlin said. "These rec
ommendations in combination
with graduate resident assistant
input were considered in the final
plan."
Although Tumlin said the
Transportation Office evaluated
the plan according to issues of
fairness, simplicity, enforceability
and cost-effectiveness, some of
the Escondido residents are not
content with the policy and are
taking action to remove the new
system from their area.
In fact, more than 70 percent of
the residents in Hoskins Court
have signed a petition in favor of
reinstating the assigned parking
spaces for both the high-rise and
low-rise parking in the area, said
Brian Holloway, a graduate stu
dent in mechanical engineering
who lives in the area.
Holloway and his neighbors,
Lorie and Nolan Glantz, adminis
tered the petition to the Hoskins
residents in response to concerns
about the new plan's effects on
their area.
"There are many issues in
volved here," Holloway said.
Hoskins Court houses one of only
two computer clusters in the Es
condido area, and this system may
encourage other residents to drive
