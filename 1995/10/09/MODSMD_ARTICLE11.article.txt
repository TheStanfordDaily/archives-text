town where soldiers labored to dig enough graws.
The work was slow the day after 100 people died
in a pre-dawn quake on t he island of Sumatra, as the
downpour filled the graves with water and turned
the ground into mire.
Another 700 people were seriously injured in the
inagnitude-7 quake, and 10,000 buildings collapsed
or were seriously damaged. The epicenter was near
this town of 40,000 in a remote south-central valley
Five strong aftershocks yesterday drove survivors
out of their homes and into the open, where they
huddled in the rain and wept.
"Our community was so peaceful and everything
was perfect," sobbed Sunardi, a 49-year-old farmer
m a nearby village. Like many Indonesians, Sunardi
uses only one name.
"1 thought maybe this time it's going to be my
turn," said Yus Joko, 40, a Sungaipenuh

whole family in it

Still, "they were given a decent Muslim burial,"
said a military officer.
Meanwhile, officials said, another quake with a
magnitude of , r >.2 struck about midday yesterday on
Java, the large island adjacent to Sumatra. Its cen

Indonesian capital. There were no immediate
reports of serious damage or casualties.

bodies out, but we don't have enough tools and
equipment to speed up the process," said Lt. Col.
Ibrahim Idris, who is overseeing the search.
Residents spent a third night in tents or in the
open, trying to keep bonfires going to warm them in
the 50-degree nighttime chill.

recovered in Sungaipenuh and surrounding vil
