The fever did not
spring from a lack of ath
letic success, yet some
thing seems to be contagious
around the Farm, and it has
everything to do with Cardinal
football's 4-0-1 start — it's best
since 1951.
With five NCAA champi
onships last year and a slew of
Pacific 10 Conference titles, one
wouldn't think that being ranked
No. 16 in a national poll would
foster such excitement around
campus. After all, not seeing
Stanford's athletic teams
perched somewhere in the top
five in such polls can be consid
ered an aberration.
Yet, not to belittle any other
sport here on the Farm, this is
football, and the Cardinal is play
ing it well.
Dominance in tennis, swim
ming and gymnastics has become
expected. No one is surprised to
see cross country or golf atop
their respective standings. Yet
with the resurgence of gridiron

success, the Tyrone Willingham
era of Cardinal football is turn
ing heads here at Stanford and
all over the country.
The excitement, however
strange it may seem, is justified.
After dismal seasons of 3-7-1 and
■1-7. the Cardinal has thus far
defeated last year's Pac-10 Rose
Bowl representative (Oregon)
and tied a former Rose Bowl
champion (Wisconsin) to remain
tied with a recent national cham
pion (Washington) for second
place in the Pac-10, just behind
No. 5 USC. In the polls, Stanford
sits above blockbuster programs
such as Penn State, Texas A&M
and Wisconsin, and just below
Colorado, Michigan and Alaba
ma.
With the emergence of bowl
potential and a preseason No. 11
ranking for the Cardinal men's
basketball team, Stanford has
officially burst onto the national
scene in these high profile sports,
and students and faculty should
revel in every minute of it.
