# Points of order
## 
### 
Every weekend, a curious
sort of migration takes place.
At around noon, the dining
halls at Wilbur, Stern and Florence
Moore are overrun with hordes of
hungry students from Manzanita,
Roble and Lagunita. It is not
because they come in search of
superior cuisine, but instead, they
are forced to venture out because
their own dining halls are not open.
While operating a skeletal din
ing operation on the weekends
may save University Dining Ser
vices money, it places a burden on
students. Beyond the inconve
nience of having to walk from Kim
ball to Wilbur or Stern, there is the
more serious problem that points
don't mix with the board plan.
For example, if a student on
points wanted to eat at Lagunita,
he would have to pay a set amount
around $7 — to have lunch
there. But even if the student onlv

purchases a bowl of cereal and a
glass of milk, the points deducted
would still equal the set amount —
around $7. The same meal would
probably have ended up costing
around $2 at Manzanita.
It is difficult to say how many
students actually take less than
what the set price expects them to
eat. But it is our contention that
people on points are being charged
in excess of what they would be
charged at a points dining hall.
In light of that, we think that
University Dining Services should
open Manzanita dining hall for
students on points during the
weekend, at least for breakfast or
brunch. An alternative would be to
return Stern to the points plan or
use a combination of points and
board at all locations on campus on
weekends. Points students should
not be forced to subsidize food ser
vice on weekends.
