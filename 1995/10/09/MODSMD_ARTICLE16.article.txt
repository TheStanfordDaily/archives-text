THE SMURFS ARE, m fact, com
munists. Not only is this fact now
obvious, hut the subconscious eon
tent of their cartoon has now surfaced
From its very creation, it has been
aimed to instill communist beliefs into
the subconscious minds of our children.
Unfortunately, this is no joke, (live it a
little consideration and you too will won
der why you did not notice it earlier.
The likeness between the Smurf com
munity and communism is strikingly
easy to identify. Let's start with the
basis of their society. It is a community
where each Smurf is an equal member of
the working class (except for Papa
Smurf, but 1 will get to that later). Each
individual is identified by his trade. For
example, Handy is the handyman of the
village, whose job it is to fix things and
nothing else. (Smurfette's trade is never
mentioned, and from the fact that she is
the only female amongst a tribe of males,
overwhelmingly happy males none the
less, one can only speculate as to her job.)
There is no money in this economy;
every task satisfies a direct need. Sound
familiar? This is exactly the concept of
Marxism (save only the Smurfette part,
but this is only because Marx doesn't go
into much detail in that area)

Second, let's look to the leader of
this group, the almighty and wise Papa
Smurf. And how is he identified? He
wears the color red. It is much more
than a coincidence that the communist
countries of the world tend to associate
themselves with this same color. Chil
dren look up to Papa Smurf, and asso
ciate him with this color red.
Third, look at the identity of Papa
Smurf. Ho is the founder of this society,
much like how Karl Marx created com
munism. Furthermore, he has a little
white beard, exactly like the one Karl
Marx sports in the pictures we have of
him today. Also, Papa Smurf is said to be
very old, hundreds of years old as a mat
ter of fact. Similarly, Marx was born at
he beginning of the 19th century, mak
ing him almost 200 years old. Children
think of this character as the all-know
ing one, and believe what he says.
Fourth, let's look at the physical
appearance of a Smurf. They are tiny
(three apples high, I think) and blue.
Their minuscule stature would certainly
make them non-threatening to even a
small child. Furthermore, their blue
color encourages children to be friendly
towards them. It is a scientific fact (I
saw it on one of those boring science

shows) that the color blue encourages
social behavior among small children.
Therefore, these children watching the
Smurfs subconsciously befriend them
Fifth and finally, the Smurfs only
have one big enemy, an old man with a
cat. This enemy represents the United
States and the cat is his main weapon
against the innocent Smurfs. Notice
how the letters used to spell out "cat"
are contained in the word capitalism.
This was intended. Children watching
this program fear the cat, subcon
sciously associating it with capitalism
and, in turn, learn to fear capitalism.
The Smurfs are not harmless little
cute creatures. They are communist
propaganda. It is unfortunate that this
was not realized sooner, before it had
planted the seeds of communism in the
minds of our generation. When Marx
envisioned a revolution, he must have
realized he needed a catalyst. This is it.
