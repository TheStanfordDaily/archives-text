Sen. Feinstein opposed to cuts in student aid

IN THE NEXT year, enrollment in our
nation's colleges will be the highest in
history, and is expected to increase.
This fact alone tolls me parents and
young people know that in this modern
era, what you learn will determine what
you earn.
The benefits of a college education
today are clear. People with a college
degree earn more money, pay more taxes
and arc better able to support their fam
ilies. In fact, every year of higher educa
tion increases earnings by six to 12 per
cent.
That's why we should be encouraging
our young people to stay in school and
continue their education, and as a
nation we should do everything we can
to make college more accessible. In large
part, that means making financial aid
available to deserving students.
Unfortunately, Republicans on the
Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, which oversees higher edu
cation. seem intent on doing the oppo
site. They recently passed an amend-

ment, soon to be considered by the full
Senate, that would charge colleges a fee
— .85 percent for every student on
campus who receives a federal loan to
help pay for their education.
That's right — a tax on our colleges.
When we should be trying to get more
of our young people into college, the
Republicans want to penalize schools
for admitting students who receive fed
eral financial aid. As Robert Atwell,
president of the American Council on
Education, said recently, the fee-on
loans plan is equivalent to taxing gro
cery stores for the number of food
stamps they accept.
Nationwide, this tax would cost col
leges $1.7 billion. California schools
alone would have to come up with $16.7
million next year. Over seven years, col
leges in California will be hit with nearly
$150 million in taxes just for accepting
needy students.
It's no secret that colleges and uni
versities in California have taken a heat
ing over the last few years. As the state's

budget has continually shrunk, so have
the budgets for the University of Cali
fornia and the California State Universi
ty systems. The UC and CSU systems
were created in great part to make edu
cation in this state more accessible, hut
more recently they have had to raise
tuition to make up budget decreases. As
a result, more and more students have
come to depend on financial assistance if
they are to have a chance at attaining an
advanced degree.
Under the Republican fee-on-loans
plan, colleges cannot turn down any stu
dent that meets the criteria for a federal
loan. Thus, a college or university has
no control whatsoever over how much it
will be charged by the federal govern
ment in any given year, unless it decides
to opt out of the federal loan program
altogether.
Clearly, the real victims under this
bizarre proposal are not the colleges, hut
the students themselves. The money will
come out of financial aid budgets, reduc
ing the numbers of loans and grants

that a school would be able to offer each
year.
Additionally, while taxing colleges on
the backs of students, Republicans also
want to cut the successful direct student
loan program by 20 percent. This stu
dent aid program, which eliminates the
middlemen (lending institutions), lets
the federal government provide money
directly to students, saving time, money
and paperwork.
Currently, 190 institutions of higher
learning in California are participating
in the direct loan program, which has
received positive reviews from schools
and students alike.
Life today is a rocky road without a
college degree. We should try to make
that path smoother and encourage more
of our high school graduates to take it.
Taxing our colleges and making it hard
er for students to pay for higher educa
tion are the roadblocks our young people
don't need.
