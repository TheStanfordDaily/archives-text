Perhaps irony is too subtle a rhetori
cal device these days, but the story quot
ing me as saying, at last Wednesday's
Law School panel, that the Simpson case
is "the most important criminal trial of

the '90s" got what I meant — and what
I very explicitly said — exactly back
wards. I said that America had just
heard the verdict in the most important
criminal trial of the '90s (pause to
briefly tease the audience) — the guilty
verdict in the federal conspiracy trial in
New York of the people associated with

the World Trade Center bombing. My
point was that in terms of any technical
legal issues, the Simpson case was
rather ordinary, and, echoing my col
leagues, that the case should not be the
occasion for any important changes in
the rules of criminal justice. Of course,
the case may prove, as a self-fulfilling

prophecy, of vast significance if the exag
gerated views of it lead to unnecessary
and damaging changes; it is also, of
course, a very important trial as a politi
cal phenomenon. I would have thought
all this rather obvious from my remarks.
