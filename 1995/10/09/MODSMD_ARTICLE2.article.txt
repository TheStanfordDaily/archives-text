# Football survives desert scorcher
## Two-point victory over ASU gives team best start since 1951 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — The Cardiac Cardinal was
at it again last Saturday night, most likely giv
ing head coach Tyrone Willingham and his
staff some near-heart attacks in the process.
The decision of yet another game was up in
the air until the closing minutes, and again the
Stanford defense scraped just enough together
to keep the Cardinal (No. 16 in the AP poll, No.
19 in the USA Today / CNN poll) on top. The
result was a 30-28 victory over Arizona State

(2-4 overall, 1-3 Pacific 10 Conference), pre
serving Stanford's unbeaten 4-0-1 record and
sending the school to its best start since 1951.
Late in the fourth quarter, the Stanford of
fense failed to convert on third-and-three and
was forced to punt, giving the football to ASU
on its own 32-yard line. The Sun Devils had one
minute, 22 seconds to move into position to
kick a game-winning field goal.
The situation was eerily similar to last
year's meeting in Tempe, In that contest, Stan
ford held a 35-33 lead before the Sun Devils'
final drive. ASU converted three fourth-down

plays against a sieve-like Stanford defense en
route to a 38-yard field goal and a 36-35 win.
"It was scary," said junior free safety Josh
Madsen. "It was likedeja vu."
The Cardinal didn't allow history to repeat
itself, however. The Sun Devils marched to
Stanford's 37. There they stalled, just outside
the range of kicker Robert Nycz.
On consecutive plays, ASU quarterback
Jake Plummer appeared to have trouble get
ting the play from the sideline. On third-and
six, the snap came just in time to avoid a delay-

mer threw incomplete to Keith
Poole.
On fourth down, the Cardinal
pass rush flushed Plummer out of
the pocket and eventually brought
him down at the line of scrimmage.
Senior defensive tackles Pete
Swanson and David Carder and
sophomore defensive end Kailee
Wong all converged for the sack.
The Stanford defense had bent, but
it did not break.
"Because every game has come
down to the fourth quarter, we're
prepared for it," Madsen said
"We'd been in that situation and
knew what we had to do."
Thoughts of last year's disheart
ening defeat did not enter into the
minds of the Cardinal.
"It really didn't come up," said
senior linebacker Mike Hall. "We
were thinking of a game like Utah
[in which Stanford intercepted a
game-tying pass at the goal line)
We definitely have confidence."
Statistically, Stanford lost the
battle, just as it did two weeks ago
in Oregon. The Sun Devils regis
tered 388 yards of total offense to
Stanford's 311, converting 23 first
downs to Stanford's 18.
All night long, the Cardinal sput
tered like a air running on fumes.

Senior quarterback Mark Butter
field completed only nine of 18 pass
es for 111 yards. Stanford's offense
broke down at key moments and
plays took a long time to develop,
allowing the Sun Devil defense
ample time to react.
But Stanford benefited from

good field position, due in most part
to Sun Devil errors. An intercep
tion, a blocked punt and a botched
fake punt led to 17 Cardinal points.
"We want to create turnovers,"
said sophomore linebacker Chris
Draft, who led the team with 18
tackles. "That's what the defense is

supposed to do.
On the plus side of the ledger,
Stanford committed no turnovers
of its own. The team has not lost
the ball in 11 quarters of play and
Butterfield has not thrown an
interception in 13.
ASU scored 14 points in the

fourth quarter to bring the game to
its exciting conclusion. After Eric
Abrams kicked a '20-yard field goal
at the end of the third period to put
the Cardinal up 23-14, the Sun
Devils began at their own 11.
After driving to Stanford's 39 by
conventional means, ASU head
coach Bruce Snyder reached into
his bag of tricks. Plummer handed
off to Terry Battle, who was run
ning right. Battle handed off to
Poole, moving left. Poole took the
reverse 39 yards for the score.
On its next possession, ASU
drove to the Cardinal 46. On
fourth-and-seven, the Sun Devils
attempted a fake punt. Pat Till
man, the blocker to whom the ball
was snapped, was not prepiired for
the fake, however. The short snap
bounced off Tillman, and Swanson
scooped it up for Stanford at the 50.
On the second play of the drive,
sophomore running back Anthony
Bookman bounced right for 21
yards. Then, junior running back
Mike Mitchell went around left end
for an 18-yard gain. On the next
play, Mitchell scampered nine
yards, scoring what would prove to
be the decisive points of the game.
Poole, the Devils' star receiver,
made ASU's final points possible,
snagging a 41-yard strike from
Plummer, giving the Sun Devils a
critical first down near the goal line.
That set up Poole's second touch
down of the day. He finished with
six catches for 95 yards.
Although the Cardinal defense
came up big late in the game, it
failed to inspire early on. Arizona
State took a 7-0 lead on the first
drive of the game. This marked the

fifth time in five outings that Stan
ford's opponents scored first.
"We came out a little bit rusty,"
Hall said. "We weren't ourselves."
Stanford came right back, how
ever. Bookman racked up gains of
13 and 21 yards. After two false
starts pushed Stanford back to
third-and-15, Butterfield hit senior
Mark Harris for 22 yards. Eventu
ally, junior fullback Adam Salina
tied the game on a 1 -yard run.
Forty seconds into the second
quarter, Madsen picked oft a Plum
mer pass intended for Poole at the
ASU 42 and returned it to the 15-
yard line. On the second play from
scrimmage, junior flanker Brian
Manning ran 11 yards untouched
into the end zone on an end-around
to put Stanford up 14-7.
On the subsequent possession,
Stanford forced the Sun Devils to
punt. Senior cornerback Kwame
EUis ran in from the left side and
blocked punter Lance Anderson's
kick. Several Staniord athletes pur
sued the loose ball and junior
linebacker Nicodemus Watts fell on
it at the ASU 6.
Faced with first-and-goal, the
offense managed to march 16 yards
backwards, and Stanford settled for
a 39-yard field goal by Eric Abrams.
The senior place kicker would add a
29-yarder shortly thereafter to
make the score 20-7.
.Just when the rout appeared to
be on, Snyder brought in sopho
more tail back Michael Martin to
spell an ineffective Chris Hopkins.
Martin racked up 51 of his 98 yards
on the Sun Devil's final drive of the
half, bringing ASU within six
points on a 1-yard dive.
