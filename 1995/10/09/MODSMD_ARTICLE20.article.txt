The cancellation of a Writing
and Critical Thinking section
forced seven freshmen to register
m alternative classes by yesterday's
regist rati< >n dead 11ne.
Assoc. Director of Writing and
Critical Thinking Claude Reichard
said the department eliminated the
"Contemporary Discourse" fresh
man English section Thursday in
response to low enrollment and
subsequent budget constraints
"Generally, when classes start
getting below half the enrollment
cap, we have to look carefully at
them," said Reichard.
The maximum enrollment for
freshman English sections is '20
students, but the size of English
lecturer dames Livezey's "Contem
porary Discourse" dropped to seven
by the end of last week.
While 18 students were initially
in the class, many postponed
enrollment in the required, two
quarter track until winter quarter
The department moved five of
the students to Livezey's earliei
section. Scheduling conflict s forced
the other two to move into new
classes.
"They were really nice about let
ting us choose different classes,

said freshman Laura Hulas, one of
the two students who changed
course-, "but we were not really
told why [the department! had to
drop t he class
l.dii Koh.ua, the other fresh
man who changed courses, said she
was not adequateh informed alxiut
why the class was canceled.
"We don't pa\ $.'H),0()0 a year for
this to happen, said Kohara.
Student- in tin- "Contemporary
I)iscourse" class completed a thrtv
to five-page paper last week.
Reichard said both Kohara and
Hidas will be able to submit this
paper for their new classes but
would have to plav catch up for the
two weeks that they missed.
The number of classes taught in
each of the three categories of
freshman English depends on stu
dent preferences, Reichard said As
a result, it is difficult to determine
exactly how main sections t«» cre
ate, and the pnrvss includes a lot of
estimation, he added
The Writing and < fitical I [link
ing program runs 149 sections
every year, and cancellations occur
only once every few years.
It's the game of anticipating
when t he demand will he and scram
bling at the last minute to meet
those demands, said Reichard.
