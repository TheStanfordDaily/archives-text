A team never likes to get blown out of the water.
There are few events more demoralizing than being
on the wrong end of a one-sided game.

Rut the feeling of woe accompanying a lopsided
loss often pales in comparison to the heartbreak of
rallying from a big deficit only to lose The Stanford
men's water polo team knows all too well these
inherent emotional pitfalls of competition, as it lost
another close overtime contest last Friday, 8-7, to
top-ranked USC.
To push the game to extra frames, the Cardinal
was forced to rally from a three-p< tnfc. fourth-quar
ter deficit. Stanford, which often lnnknd like it was
just going through the motions against the Trojans,
sparked to life in the final quarter of the match and
played with the intensity that head coach Dante Det
tamanti had been looking for all game.
"We weren't playing with intensity until the
fourth quarter," Dettamanti said. "I was practically
pleading with them all the way back in the first
quarter to step things up. In the fourth quarter, you
could really see the intensity shift, but then when we
tied it up, they went right back to where it was ear
lier in the game."
During the first quarter, the Trojans and the Car
dinal matched up evenly. I SC opened the scoring a
minute and a half into the game, but Stanford
answered with a goal by junior Brian YVallin only 20
seconds later. Wallin then gave Stanford a '2-1
advantage off an assist from senior 1 )aniel Lehoczky.
The Trojans knotted the score once more off a 6-on
-5 situation, and the game remained tied until the
waning seconds of t lie quarter
With just under a minute to play, sophomore
Layne Beaubien was ejected, giving USC another
man-up advantage. -Just as time was expiring on the
ejection, Trojan Simun Cimmeran rifled a two-point
shot paSt senior goalie Jack Bowen, giving USC a 1-
2 lead.
"That two-pointer deflated us," Dettamanti said.
"I could not believe we let that go. It absolutely
killed us. It was a complete defensive breakdown.
The Cardinal was unable to answer the Trojans'
goal, and the game progressed to the second quarter
with USC up by two points. The second period saw
no discernible change in the score, as each team put
in one goal. The Trojans successfully executed on
their third 6-on-5 situation for their only goal of the
quarter, while the Cardinal got a point when senior
Jeremy Laster converted a penalty shot
During the third quarter, the Trojans continued
to take advantage of Cardinal kickouts, tacking on
two more goals. Stanford's offense continued to

sputter, and could only manage
one point on a backhand shot out
of the two-meter position from
Wallin. Going into the fourth
quarter, the Cardinal were facing
a three-goal deficit.
Suddenly, however, after three
quarters of lackluster, disjointed
play, the Cardinal sprang to life
After 1 JS(' turned (he ball over on
the first possession of the quarter,
the previously absent Stanford
counterattack asserted itself
Braubien broke down the left
side of the pool and received an
outlet pass from Bowen. Main
taining his position between his
guard and the goal, the sopho
more took the ball off the water
and skipped it past the Trojan
goalie. The goal seemed to galva
nize the team and brought to life
a crowd that had little to cheer
for.
With the sudden shift in
momentum, the Cardinal could
do no wrong. USC once again
turned the ball over, and Detta
manti's squad beat the Trojans
back on transition. This time,
senior I )an I lancock took t he pass
from Bowen and fed the ball to
Wallin, who was coming down the
middle of the pool Wallin stuffed
the ball into tlie net, pulling Stan
ford to within one, 7-ti
With 4:' JO left to pi a \ in regu
lation, Wallin drew a kickout

except for Wallin, who rocketed a
shot that hit the crossbar. Han

the ball off to senior Josh Leach
man. Leaehman spun his defend
er around and drew an ejection as
he worked for the shot. I.aster
took the penalty shot, firing it
past Trojan goalie Brendan
Grubbs to tie the score at seven
apiece.
Despite the fact that the tide of
the game had changed, the Cardi
nal was unable to put the Trojans
away in the final (our minutes of
regulation. Dettamanti's players
were t lie beneficiaries of t wo more
USC ejections, but both times
they were turned away. Laster
made a last-ditch effort to finish
t he game, firing a shot wit h under
15 seconds to play, but it was
blocked by Grubhs. The Trojans
final offensive set likewise proved
112 utile, forcing two periods of over
time.
The Cardinal suffered a sot
hack in the final quarter of regu
lation, as Beaubien received his
third ejection of the game, forcing
him to sit out for the remainder of
the match.
"Losing Lay 11 e really hurt us,"
Dettamant i said. "I le is one of our
main two meter defenders and a
real go-to guv 011 the 6-on-5."
In the first period of extra
time, neither team was able to
establish much in the way of an
offense. In tin 1 end, the three min
utes expired without any scoring.
in the second period, tension
mounted, as it looked as though
the first team to score would like
lv win the irame. With 2:.'M) left in

overtime, Trojan Hrovje Cizmic
fired a backhand from six meters
out. Bowen was right in position
and got both arms on the ball, but
the shot had just enough on it to
squeeze through and trickle past
the goal line.
The Cardinal had one more
prime offensive opportunity, as
Wallin drew a ninth ejection
against the Trojans. Once again
though, Stanford was unable to
execute with a man advantage.
The Trojans recovered the ball
and were able to run the clock
down, securing the 8-7 victory.
"We didn't play well at all,"
Dettamant i said. "I'm really frus
trated because we set up every
thing but couldn't execute. You
can only have so much strategy.
There has to be some execution.
Our (j-on-5s were absolutely hor
rible."
The difference in the game was
the ability, or lack thereof, of the
two teams to score when given a
man-up advantage. The Cardinal
were unable to score on any of its
nine (> on-ss, while the Trojans
converted five of their six oppor
tunities into points.
"We definitely played our best
in the fourth quarter/' Dettaman
ti said "Hancock really helped to
spark the team. But once we got
the tie, everyone went right back
to waiting for Jeremy or Brian to
do the scoring. It was really a
shame to waste such a good come
back."
But Dettamanti is already
looking forward to next week's
match against California. "Now
we just have to beat everybody
else," he said.
