A team never likes to get blown out of the water.
There are few events more demoralizing than being
on the wrong end of a one-sided game.

Rut the feeling of woe accompanying a lopsided
loss often pales in comparison to the heartbreak of
rallying from a big deficit only to lose The Stanford
men's water polo team knows all too well these
inherent emotional pitfalls of competition, as it lost
another close overtime contest last Friday, 8-7, to
top-ranked USC.
To push the game to extra frames, the Cardinal
was forced to rally from a three-p< tnfc. fourth-quar
ter deficit. Stanford, which often lnnknd like it was
just going through the motions against the Trojans,
sparked to life in the final quarter of the match and
played with the intensity that head coach Dante Det
tamanti had been looking for all game.
"We weren't playing with intensity until the
fourth quarter," Dettamanti said. "I was practically
pleading with them all the way back in the first
quarter to step things up. In the fourth quarter, you
could really see the intensity shift, but then when we
tied it up, they went right back to where it was ear
lier in the game."
During the first quarter, the Trojans and the Car
dinal matched up evenly. I SC opened the scoring a
minute and a half into the game, but Stanford
answered with a goal by junior Brian YVallin only 20
seconds later. Wallin then gave Stanford a '2-1
advantage off an assist from senior 1 )aniel Lehoczky.
The Trojans knotted the score once more off a 6-on
-5 situation, and the game remained tied until the
waning seconds of t lie quarter
With just under a minute to play, sophomore
Layne Beaubien was ejected, giving USC another
man-up advantage. -Just as time was expiring on the
ejection, Trojan Simun Cimmeran rifled a two-point
shot paSt senior goalie Jack Bowen, giving USC a 1-
2 lead.
"That two-pointer deflated us," Dettamanti said.
"I could not believe we let that go. It absolutely
killed us. It was a complete defensive breakdown.
The Cardinal was unable to answer the Trojans'
goal, and the game progressed to the second quarter
with USC up by two points. The second period saw
no discernible change in the score, as each team put
in one goal. The Trojans successfully executed on
their third 6-on-5 situation for their only goal of the
quarter, while the Cardinal got a point when senior
Jeremy Laster converted a penalty shot
During the third quarter, the Trojans continued
to take advantage of Cardinal kickouts, tacking on
two more goals. Stanford's offense continued to
