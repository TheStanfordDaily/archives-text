Having finished most of its
non-conference schedule, the
Stanford women's soccer team (8-
3 overall, 2-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) plunged into Pac-10 play
this weekend and, in characteris
tic fashion, emerged unscathed.
The lOth-ranked Cardinal used
two second-half goals to edge No.
18 Oregon State (8-4, 2-1) by a
score of 2-1 on Friday, then
romped 6-0 over unranked
Arkansas (5-6-1) Saturday after
noon.

Friday's win over the Beavers,
who were previously unbeaten in
the Pac-10, gave Stanford its sec
ond conference victory in as many
tries. The women hope to use the
victory as a springboard for the
remainder of their season, which
includes five Pac-10 contests and
only two non-conference matches.
"Pac-10 games are always
important," said senior midfielder
Dena Dey, "especially games in
our region. And it's always good
to get a win over a ranked team.
Stanford succeeded in control

day's contest, dominating the
Beavers on hoth sides of the ball.
But thanks to an outstanding
effort by Oregon State goalkeeper
Michelle Mitchell, the Cardinal
had nothing to show for it at the
break, despite holding an 8-1
first-half advantage in shots on
goal.
Senior midfielder Carmel Mur
phy finally broke through for the
Cardinal 18 minutes, 36 seconds
into the second half, when she ran

down a pass from trcshman L har
maine Le√ülanc and drove it into
the net from the top of the OSU
penalty box. Exactly six minutes
later, sophomore midfielder Rita
Hermiz took a crossing pass from
Dey and put it away to give the
Cardinal a 2-0 advantage.
Yet Stanford could only delay
the inevitable for so long. At the
70-minute mark, OSU's Val
Williams stole a back pass intend
ed for Cardinal goalie Erin Brvla
and took it in alone for the score.
Williams, who leads the Beavers
in scoring with 23 points (10
goals, three assists), has averaged
a goal per game over her college
career. As a freshman last season,
the star forward set single-season
school records for goals (19),
assists (9) and points (47).
The goal was in vain, however,
as the Stanford defense shut
down the Beavers over the final
20 minutes to preserve the victo
