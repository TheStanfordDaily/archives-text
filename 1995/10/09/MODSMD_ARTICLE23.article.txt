Stanford 2

Having finished most of its
non-conference schedule, the
Stanford women's soccer team (8-
3 overall, 2-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) plunged into Pac-10 play
this weekend and, in characteris
tic fashion, emerged unscathed.
The lOth-ranked Cardinal used
two second-half goals to edge No.
18 Oregon State (8-4, 2-1) by a
score of 2-1 on Friday, then
romped 6-0 over unranked
Arkansas (5-6-1) Saturday after
noon.

Friday's win over the Beavers,
who were previously unbeaten in
the Pac-10, gave Stanford its sec
ond conference victory in as many
tries. The women hope to use the
victory as a springboard for the
remainder of their season, which
includes five Pac-10 contests and
only two non-conference matches.
"Pac-10 games are always
important," said senior midfielder
Dena Dey, "especially games in
our region. And it's always good
to get a win over a ranked team.
Stanford succeeded in control
ling the tempo throughout Fri
day's contest, dominating the
Beavers on hoth sides of the ball.
But thanks to an outstanding
effort by Oregon State goalkeeper
Michelle Mitchell, the Cardinal
had nothing to show for it at the
break, despite holding an 8-1
first-half advantage in shots on
goal.
Senior midfielder Carmel Mur
phy finally broke through for the
Cardinal 18 minutes, 36 seconds
into the second half, when she ran

down a pass from trcshman L har
maine Leßlanc and drove it into
the net from the top of the OSU
penalty box. Exactly six minutes
later, sophomore midfielder Rita
Hermiz took a crossing pass from
Dey and put it away to give the
Cardinal a 2-0 advantage.
Yet Stanford could only delay
the inevitable for so long. At the
70-minute mark, OSU's Val
Williams stole a back pass intend
ed for Cardinal goalie Erin Brvla
and took it in alone for the score.
Williams, who leads the Beavers
in scoring with 23 points (10
goals, three assists), has averaged
a goal per game over her college
career. As a freshman last season,
the star forward set single-season
school records for goals (19),
assists (9) and points (47).
The goal was in vain, however,
as the Stanford defense shut
down the Beavers over the final
20 minutes to preserve the victo
ry. It marked the first time in 10
games OSU has lost when
Williams registers a goal.
Saturday's matchup, mean
while, was low on drama and high
un scoring, as the Cardinal scored
early and often in a (5-0 hlowoutt
of the Razorhaeks. Five minutes

into tin* first half, senior defender
Jessica Fischer took a corner kick
from Heriniz and headed it past
Arkansas goalie Molly Smith.
Seven minutes later, junior for
ward Erin Martin scored on a
pass from Carmel Murphy, and
the rout was on.
Fischer, Martin and Murphy
scored two goals apiece in the lop
sided win. Stanford outshot the
Razorbacks by an astounding

margin of 30-1.
This weekend's success indi
cates a marked improvement in
the women's all-around play. "1
think we've gotten past some of
the things we were having prob
lems with," said sophomore mid
fielder Elie Foster. "This weekend
we got our finishing down, and we
moved possession around, which
was something we hadn't been
doing with a lot of confidence."
