# Mitchell plays back home
## Junior running back tallies late touchdown 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. - In 1994,
Mike Mitchell sustained an
ankle injury in the team's third
game It forced him to sit out the
rest of the season. As a result,
the running back didn't accom
pany the team when it traveled
to Tempe to face the Sun Devils
and missed the first chance of
his college career to return home
and play close to his old stomp
ing grounds.
Mitchell was a consensus
high school Ail-American at Bro
phy Prep in Phoenix, where he
set state records by rushing for
5,670 yards and 76 touchdowns
over the course of his high
school career. He snagged Ari
zona Player of the Year honors
in both 1991 and 1992.
Although he was recruited heav
ily by nearby Arizona State, he
elected to attend Stanford.
He had something to prove
Saturday night, playing in front
of the people he left behind and
against some old opponents. By
his own high standards, Mitchell
didn't have a spectacular game,
finishing with 63 yards on 15

carries, but what he did accom
plish was significant.
Nearly half of Mitchell's
yards came on Stanford's last
scoring drive. With the Cardinal
clinging to a 23-21 lead arid the

ball at ASU's 27-yard line, he
took the hand-off from Mark
Butterfield and, with the help of
a block by Greg Cornelia, ran left

for 18 yards. On the very next
play, he sped nine yards into the
end zone for the score. These six
points proved to be the difference
in the game.
"I can't begin to say how I
felt," Mitchell said. "1 had the
winning touchdown. I wasn't feel
ing like I was playing all that well.
1 think 1 made up for it at the

end.
Mitchell's celebration (which
was constrained due to NCAA
regulations) gave the crowd some
idea of the emotion he was feel
ing.
"I couldn't stop running," he
said. "I ran through the end zone
— all the way over to the sidelines
and back. It's just an unbelievable
feeling."
In addition to scoring a touch
down with his friends and family
on hand, Mitchell also had the
chance to greet some old buddies
on the field. Sun Devil free safety

Mitchell Freedman starred at
Maryvale High School in Phoenix
and was eager to lay a hit on his
one-time rival.
"[Freedman] always says
that," Mitchell said. "I played
against him for years, in Pop
Warner and high school. He's a
good player, a good hitter, a real
competitor. He's always doing
stuff like that."
The two had a chance to meet in
the first quarter, though the meet
ing probably didn't turn out quite
like Freedman had planned. On
second-and-goal at Arizona State's
3-yard line, head coach Tyrone
Willingham called Mitchell's num
ber. Mitchell took the ball over left
tackle where he was stopped short
of the end zone by ASU's Scott
Van der Ahe and Freedman.
Though Mitchell didn't get the
touchdown, he did get Freedman.
The Sun Devil walked off the field
woozy and disoriented after the
collision.
"I wanted to take it to him,"
Mitchell said. "I think I hit him
pretty good."
Thus far in 1995, the Stanford
defense, despite struggling at
times, has saved the day, creating
turnovers that lead to points and
making big plays in the final min
utes.
"It was such a clutch play by
the defense," Mitchell said of the
way the defense performed on the
last Sun Devil drive. "Things
have changed (from last year).
People aren't going to be down on
the defense anymore."
Despite the team's victory Sat
urday night and the 4-0-1 record.
Mitchell realizes that there's still
a long way to go. If Stanford
hopes for an appearance in a bow!
game, he and the offense are
going to have to keep up their enc
of the bargain.
"The offense has to step it up,'
Mitchell said. "We're up to the
challenge."
