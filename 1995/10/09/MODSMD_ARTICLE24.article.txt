TEMPE, Ariz. - In 1994,
Mike Mitchell sustained an
ankle injury in the team's third
game It forced him to sit out the
rest of the season. As a result,
the running back didn't accom
pany the team when it traveled
to Tempe to face the Sun Devils
and missed the first chance of
his college career to return home
and play close to his old stomp
ing grounds.
Mitchell was a consensus
high school Ail-American at Bro
phy Prep in Phoenix, where he
set state records by rushing for
5,670 yards and 76 touchdowns
over the course of his high
school career. He snagged Ari
zona Player of the Year honors
in both 1991 and 1992.
Although he was recruited heav
ily by nearby Arizona State, he
elected to attend Stanford.
He had something to prove
Saturday night, playing in front
of the people he left behind and
against some old opponents. By
his own high standards, Mitchell
didn't have a spectacular game,
finishing with 63 yards on 15

carries, but what he did accom
plish was significant.
Nearly half of Mitchell's
yards came on Stanford's last
scoring drive. With the Cardinal
clinging to a 23-21 lead arid the

ball at ASU's 27-yard line, he
took the hand-off from Mark
Butterfield and, with the help of
a block by Greg Cornelia, ran left
