There is no greater challenge in sports than to
defeat a strong opponent on its home turf in front of
;\ hostile crowd. Faced with that daunting task for
the third time this season, the Stanford women's
volleyball team used its talent and experience to
overcome the undefeated Washington State Cougars
13-1 overall, 5-1 Pacific 10 Conference) on Friday in
in exhausting five-game match. Following that
draining victory, the Cardinal (12-2, 8-0) had
enough left to turn back the Washington Huskies (6-
8, 2-5) in four games in Seattle.
Against Washington on Saturday night, Stanford
played as though it still felt the effects of the previ
ous night's marathon. After struggling to take a
two-games-to-one lead, the Cardinal endured a see
saw battle in game four. As both teams grew increas
ingly tired, however, Stanford's depth prevailed.
Cardinal coarh Don Shaw's ability to substitute
fresh players clearly made an impact, as the Huskies
were forced to stay with its six starters for most of
game four. By the end of the deciding game, Stan
ford had taken control, and the Cardinal took the
game 15-13.
In particular, Stanford was sparked by the
entrance of sophomore Debbie Lambert in game
three After not playing at all against Washington
State, Lambert had an immediate impact against
Washington, netting four kills in only six attempts
while totaling six digs. Her plav proved significant

considering the struggles of senior Marnie Triefen
bach, who registered only four kills and nine errors
in 23 hitting attempts.
Equally important was the contribution of sopho
more Paula McNammee, who spelled a struggling
Kristin Folkl (five kills and four errors in 18
attempts) and hit .'267 with six kills and two blocks.
After dropping a tightly played game one 15-17,
Stanford played its best game of the match in game
two, winning 15-7. In that game, the Cardinal used
its superior passing skills to create scoring opportu
nities. Stanford's 6-2 offense, with sophomore Lisa
Sharplev and senior Gary Wendell as setters, totaled
64 assists for the match. Sharpley led Stanford with
36 assists.
Wendell, the National Player of the Year, per
formed well despite failing to notch a triple-double
for the first time in six games. She hit an impressive
.462 for the match, with 15 kills and 26 assists.
Game three proved to be another tight battle, as
the Huskies extended Stanford past the normal 15-
point limit. Using its balanced offensive attack,
Stanford managed to hold off Washington and take
the game 16-14. Senior outside hitter Wendy Hro
madka played consistently, hitting .333 for the
match while totaling 11 kills and nine digs.
Senior Dragana Djordjevic accounted for over 60
percent of the Washington offense. The Huskies'
outside hitter posted an amazing 35 kills in an even
more amazing 71 attempts.
Meanwhile, Friday's match against the Cougars
turned out to be every bit the showdown that was
expected between the top two teams in the Pac-10.
After splitting the first four games, the teams bat
tled through a rally-scored game five. Despite having
dropped three of its previous four game fives, the
Cardinal played outstandingly in the clutch, domi
nating the game 15-7 and firmly establishing itself
as the favorite to win the Pac-10.
Yet, prior to winning the decisive fifth game,
Stanford exhibited streaky play. Fired up by its first-
ever sellout crowd, Washington
State jumped all over Stanford in
game one, taking it by a score of
15-8. The crowd of 4,039 was the
largest ever to see a women's vol
leyball game in Pullman.
Just as quickly as it lost game
one, however, Stanford cruised to
an identical 15-8 victory in game
two. Nonetheless, the Cardinal
was unable to capitalize on its
momentum and quiet the Bohler
(iym crowd. The resilient
Cougars came right back and won
a hard-fought game three by a
score of 15-12.
At that juncture in the match,
as has been the case all season,
Stanford's depth started to wear
down the Cougars. Inserting
junior Eileen Murfee into the
starting lineup allowed Shaw to
use Marnie Triefenbach off the
bench, and the rotation kept the
Stanford lineup fresh. The
Cougars, meanwhile, were forced
to use their top six players almost
exclusively. Accordingly, Stanford
thoroughly outplayed WSU in
game four, winning it 15-4. This
time, Stanford managed to keep
the pressure on throughout the
final game and close out the
match.
Stanford received consistent, if
not outstanding, performances
from its top players. Folkl led the
team in kills with 17, and she hit
.306 for the match and led Stan
ford with 16 digs. Wendell record
ed her fifth straight triple-double,
collecting 16 kills (while hitting
.353), 43 assists and 16 digs.
Sharpley nearly amassed a triple
double of her own with nine kills,
32 assists and 14 digs. Murfee
was impressive as a starter, hit
ting .308 with 13 kills and 11 digs.
Off the bench, Triefenbach con
tinued he'r excellent defensive
play this season with nine digs.

She also added 10 kills and two
service aces.
The key for Stanford, though,
was its ability to contain Cougar
superstar Sarah Silvernail. Sil
vernail, a senior from Seattle who
leads the Pac-10 in hitting per
centage and is a legitimate Player
of the Year candidate, posted 21
kills for the Cougars but only hit
.245. Washington State senior
Keren Oigman, who ranks right
behind Silvernail in the league
hitting race, fared even worse,
finishing with only 15 kills and a
.214 hitting percentage. Stan

ford's defense was strong
throughout the match, as the
usually potent Cougars only hit
.155 as a team. The victory over
the Cougars marked Shaw's
300 th career victory.
After defeating UCI„A, USC,
WSU and Washington on the road
in less than a month, Stanford
will control its own destiny for the
rest of the season in the Pac-10.
All of the leading contenders for
the conference title must over
come Stanford at Maples Pavil
ion, where the Cardinal hasn't
lost in 19 matches.
