# Out of the loop, two alumni fear liberal agenda

Former University President Donald
Kennedy was fond of saying that the Uni
versity was engaged in a "great experi
ment."
Now, in a new book titled "The Diversity
Myth," Stanford graduates David Sacks and
Peter Thiel question whether the experi
ment has worked at all.
"We wanted to present our side of the de
bate in a systematic manner," Thiel said in
an interview last week. "Multiculturalism is
expressed in so many institutional ways on
this campus. It has been given importance

in such a way that it has taken over the way
this University operates."
The book, which Thiel and Sacks began
writing in early 1993, will be available in
late October or early November. It covers a
seven- to eight-year time span and illus
trates how multiculturalism has been im
plemented in various contexts and what its
effects have been.
Thiel, who graduated in 1989 and was
the founding editor of The Stanford Review,
said the Western Culture debate which
began in the mid-1980s "set the stage" for
multiculturalism at Stanford.
The debate questioned whether or not
the required Western Culture course was

adequately broad in its scope, or whether it
was overly Eurocentric.
The debate resulted in the current form
of the course, now known as Cultures, Ideas
and Values.
Thiel argues that CIV is only one exam
ple of how multiculturalism is systematical
ly imposed on Stanford students. "The sub
ject matter we are taught at Stanford is
clearly skewed in favor of multicultural
ism," said Thiel. "But it is evident in all con
texts, even at 'home' in the dorms. There is
a big educational component to | Residential
Education), and its ideologies are quite bi
ased."
Thiel related that as a freshman in Bran

ner, every speaker lie heard as part of dorm
programs was a liberal. "I found I was ask
ing myself when we were going to hear a
conservative speaker or two," said Thiel.
When he brought the matter to the resi
dent fellow's attention, Thiel said, the RF
answered him by mentioning that he knew
no conservatives to invite.
"All I'm saying is that the institutional
push is all in one direction," Thiel said. "It
seems we're losing scope instead of gaining
it because the emphasis on multicultural
ism is excessive."
Besides its presence in the dorms, Thiel
