# Cluster troubles
## Construction delays computers for Row 
### Stewart Maclennan Contributing writer 
Could you imagine life at Stan
ford without access to e-mail or
the Internet?
For most students that ques
tion will thankfully remain a fan
ciful one, but for this year's Row
house residents who returned to
the Farm only to find empty com
puter clusters, it was all too real.
Residential Computing Direc
tor Jeff Morriman explained that
the two-week delay in installing
Row computer clusters was
linked to the late completion of
Stem renovations.
"Because of our late entry into
Stern, all of our resources were
used up trying to get the clusters
running on time for freshmen
taking computerized language
placement tests," said Merriman.
Since the Row houses are des
ignated as high-risk security
areas, Residential Computing re
moves computers from (heir clus
ters each summer. This year, they
were reluctant to reinstall the
computers before the school year
began.
Having students living in the
dorm "provides the computers
with security, so our initial plan
was to wait and install them dur
ing the early-arrival week," Mer
riman said. "Unfortunately, we
didn't foresee the delays at
Stern."
Merriman also explained that
since the Stern renovations con
tinued into the first week of
school, many of the students em
ployed by Residential Computing
were busy with their classes, lim-
iting the resources he could allo
cate to getting the Row house
clusters finished.
"Because of the timing, a one
week delay at Stern grew into a
two-week setback for us," said
Merrinian. "We should have had
more staff," he added.
With the exception of a few
remaining Power Macintoshes to
be installed and some minor net
work problems, Residential Com
puting asserts that all the clus
ters will be operating by the end
of today.
Merriman predicted that next
year, Residential Computing will
have a much easier time opening
computer clusters on the Row
since Toyon Hall's renovations
have been pushed back two years
