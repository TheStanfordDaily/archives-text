# Breaking barriers, Wais takes on new job
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Three weeks after arriving on campus, Marc
Lee Wais still hasn't had time to come up for air.
The new dean of students had been on the
Farm for only eight days when he was faced
with evicting the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
from its house.
"When I came in, |I was) presented with a
portfolio of facts and information about a fra
ternity that had had concerns about its opera
tion over a number of years," Wais said. "That
made for a very compelling case.
"I think that the [eviction 1 was very appro
priate and warranted and justified," he said. "I
think that any reasonable person would have
looked at the facts and come to the conclusion
that something had to be done."
Wais said the extreme action needed to be
taken to maintain integrity in the University's
policies.
"Sometimes you've got to back up what
you're going to say," he said, noting that the
Delts had received written notices of t he steps
they needed to take to retain t heir house.
A Maryland native, Wais comes to Stanford
from the University of Maryland at Baltimore
— a graduate school campus — where he was
assistant vice president for student affairs.
"It was clear after two years [at Maryland|
that I wasn't going to be completely satisfied
and happy working with that type of popula
tion in that type of environment," he said.
"Stanford has a very exciting mix of under

graduate and graduate students."
Despite the Delt eviction, Wais said he plans
to take a pro-Greek stance in his time at Stan
ford. "I met with the Creek leadership group
. . . and made it very clear to them that I'm very
supportive of Greek life," he said.
"Although I helped take this particular ac-

Tm hoping to be very visible,
I'm hoping to be very active, I'm
hoping that people get the mes
sage that I'm available to work
with them and to help them.'

tion for this one particular group ... I think
that [Greek organizations| provide greater di
versity for the Stanford student |and| they do
some very wonderful things: community ser
vice, philanthropic activities," he added.
On the whole, Wais said, he believes in treat
ing students as adults. "As adults ... we hold
people accountable for what they do," he said.
In addition, Wais said he sees himself as a li
aison between the students and the adminis
tration.
"I really want people to get the message that
the dean of students is someone who is here for
them — someone here who can advocate for
them, someone here who is available to work

through problems with them, someone who is
here to enhance their overall experience here at
Stanford, someone who is here to help them
with their academic goals and objectives here at
Stanford," he said.
Wais added that he wanted to break down
the apparent barrier between students and the
administration. "A lot of students refer to 'the
administration' and 'us,' " he said. "1 would
like to do everything in my power to break
down that sense of barrier between the admin
istration and students. Everyone who works
here at Stanford ... is here with the intent of
making it the best possible educational experi
ence for students here."
"I 'd like to see students hold that viewpoint
much more than the us-versus-them," he
added.
To achieve that objective, which Wais called
"one of [his] major goals," he plans to be as vis
ible and involved as possible. In addition to
meeting with the Greek leadership council and
the ASSU, Wais said he plans to meet with
leaders from other student organizations such
as the various community centers.
"I'm hoping to be very visible, I'm hoping to
be very active, I'm hoping that people get tin
message that I'm available to work with them
and to help them," Wais said.
Prior to working at Maryland, Wais was the
dean of students at Fairleigh Dickinson Uni
versity in New Jersey, where he did his under
graduate work. He holds a doctorate from Har
vard, an MBA from Miami and a master's de
gree from George Washington University.
