They see the next generation of ultrasound technology. As a worldwide leader
in the development, manufacture, distribution and service of diagnostic medical
ultrasound systems, ATL is dedicated to the innovation and development of ultra
sound technology that broadens its clinical applications while reducing the cost
and trauma of diagnosis and treatment. Our people also see the most advanced
design and manufacturing tools available and a level of personal satisfaction that
is hard to find. Entry level opportunities now exist in the following areas for new
grads.
SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT
• System Architecture
• Digital Signal Processing
• User Interface/Clinical Applications
• Design Analysis & Validation
• Tools and Integration
Entry-level positions require a BSCS/EE or MSCS/EE and software development
knowledge in C/C++ in a UNIX/ embedded systems environment. Knowledge of Make,
Shell scripts, x-window tool kits, and UNIX utilities (Awk, Yacc, Sed, etc) is a definite
plus.
ATL is located in Washington State, just 30 minutes northeast of downtown
Seattle. Considered by many to be one of the most desirable places to live in
America, the Puget Sound region boasts some of the most spectacular scenery in
the world.
Please visit us at the Stanford Career Fair on Friday, October
13th, to find out more about these opportunities.
ATL offers a team-oriented environment with competitive, comprehensive
benefits including a 401 (k) and tuition reimbursement. If you are unable to
attend please send resume to: Advanced Technology Laboratories, PO Box 3003,
22100 Bothell-Everett Highway, Bothell, WA 98041-3003. ATTN: SD. ATL main
