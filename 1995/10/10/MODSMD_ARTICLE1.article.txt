# Larger sections draw fire from faculty

Although effects of the most recent sec
tion size increase are still unclear, some fac
ulty are unhappy about the seven-year cost
cutting trend which many claim is adverse
ly affecting undergraduate education.
In April, John Shoven, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, announced
that section sizes would increase by 10 per
cent, meaning larger sections and fewer
graduate teaching assistant positions.
"The general picture is it's going to
mean a loss of jobs for some TAs in some
departments," said Assoc. Dean of Gradu
ate Policy George Dekker. "The impact is

going to vary a lot."
April's decision, however, came as no
surprise to Humanities and Sciences de
partments. In 1988, budget cuts forced a re
evaluation and subsequent cutbacks
throughout the school.
The next year, an ASSU survey of 193
teaching assistants found that most felt the
increase was hindering undergraduate edu
cat ion.
"The larger the sect ions get, the easier it
is not to participate and to shrug off learn
ing to the last second," said Rich Stolz, a
senior American Studies major and mem
ber of the Council of Presidents. Most of
his sections have had 20 or more students
including one English section which had

26, he added.
The undergraduate voice — virtually
silent in recent years on this topic — is the
true test of the policy's impact, faculty
members say.
"The real index is if students feel they're
getting cheated," said Prof. Jay Fliegelman,
chair of the English Depart merit. "If they do
feel that way, I hope they say something
about it. It's not the only place [the admin
istration) can cut."
Freshmen greatly affected

Writing and Critical Thinking — lauded
in last year's report by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education — has risen to
an average of 18 students per class in the ad
vanced four-unit courses, said Claude Re
ichard, associate director of Writing and
Critical Thinking. The mandatory cap now
stands at 20.
Last week, administrators canceled one
of the freshman English classes because en
rollment was less than half of that cap.
