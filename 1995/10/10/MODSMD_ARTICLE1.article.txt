# Larger sections draw fire from faculty
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Although effects of the most recent sec
tion size increase are still unclear, some fac
ulty are unhappy about the seven-year cost
cutting trend which many claim is adverse
ly affecting undergraduate education.
In April, John Shoven, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, announced
that section sizes would increase by 10 per
cent, meaning larger sections and fewer
graduate teaching assistant positions.
"The general picture is it's going to
mean a loss of jobs for some TAs in some
departments," said Assoc. Dean of Gradu
ate Policy George Dekker. "The impact is

going to vary a lot."
April's decision, however, came as no
surprise to Humanities and Sciences de
partments. In 1988, budget cuts forced a re
evaluation and subsequent cutbacks
throughout the school.
The next year, an ASSU survey of 193
teaching assistants found that most felt the
increase was hindering undergraduate edu
cat ion.
"The larger the sect ions get, the easier it
is not to participate and to shrug off learn
ing to the last second," said Rich Stolz, a
senior American Studies major and mem
ber of the Council of Presidents. Most of
his sections have had 20 or more students
including one English section which had

26, he added.
The undergraduate voice — virtually
silent in recent years on this topic — is the
true test of the policy's impact, faculty
members say.
"The real index is if students feel they're
getting cheated," said Prof. Jay Fliegelman,
chair of the English Depart merit. "If they do
feel that way, I hope they say something
about it. It's not the only place [the admin
istration) can cut."
Freshmen greatly affected

freshman programs have been hit the hard
est.
Writing and Critical Thinking — lauded
in last year's report by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education — has risen to
an average of 18 students per class in the ad
vanced four-unit courses, said Claude Re
ichard, associate director of Writing and
Critical Thinking. The mandatory cap now
stands at 20.
Last week, administrators canceled one
of the freshman English classes because en
rollment was less than half of that cap.
"If writing and critical thinking are as
important to undergraduate education as


John Shoven
administrators say they are, then
why aren't they increasing the
budget and decreasing the section
size? That's my question," said
Knglish Lecturer Rich Holeton,
who is in his ninth year as a Writ
ing and Critical Thinking instruc
tor.
CIV section increase
The other required freshman
track Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues has already felt the effects of
April's budget decrease. The CIV
budget approved last spring pre
dicted 1,580 freshmen, said CIV
Director and History Prof. Paul
Seaver. When over 1,600 freshmen
enrolled, Seaver was forced to
search elsewhere to fund two new
sections.
"We had to put money together
from other bits and pieces," he
said.
CIV section size has increased
from less than 17 students four
years ago to more than 18, he
said, adding that the figure is an
average and some sections have
more than 20 students. The
increase is part of a 22 percent
overall reduction in the CIV bud
get which began last year.
"At some point, it becomes
impossible for the section leader to
draw out everybody," Seaver said.
"Some people feel increasingly shy
speaking."
Attempting to make CIV cheap
er to run, administrators have con
sidered using graduate students as
lecturers instead of the post-doc
toral fellows now used in some
tracks, all to the dismay of CIV
professors.
"Those of us teaching CIV are
not enthusiastic about that idea,
said Spanish Prof. Mary Pratt,
track coordinator for Europe and
the Americas.

Seaver said hiring teaching
assistants over lecturers could cost
more because graduate students
work only half-time. What CIV
needs is a University mandate
which requires that section sizes
be kept at a constant, low number,
Seaver said. "It requires flexibility
of funding that we don't have at
the moment," he said.
Shoven said he does not antici
pate further cuts but emphasized
it could Ih* an option if the school's
budget is decreased. "It wouldn't
be something I'd like to do, but
[one must! consider anything," he
said.
Faculty upset
Angered most by the cuts are
lecturers who teach the sections
and the professors who supervise
them.
"It's certainly not ideal to
increase the size of the sections,"
Fliegelman said. "It mitigates
against a creation of an interactive
community." He encouraged stu
dents to enroll in as many semi
nars as possible for closer contact
with faculty members.
Holeton has seen his classes
increase from 15 to 20 students
during his tenure and called the
hike "a shame and a scandal."
Not only do class increases
affect students' ability to learn and
participate, he said, but the lectur
er is unable to spend enough qual
ity time with each student.
"We have an intensive, individ
ualized, conference-based pro
gram." said Holeton, also a resi
dent fellow in Rinconada. "It's
really hard to give students the
best writing help that we can when
the section sizes increase to this
extent."
Like Fliegelman, Holeton
encouraged students to voice their
opinions. "If I were a Stanford
student, undergraduate, I'd be
really asking questions about this,
asking the administration and the
deans what's the deal," he said.

Knglish Lecturer Rich Holeton,
who is in his ninth year as a Writ

CIV section increase
The other required freshman
track Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues has already felt the effects of
April's budget decrease. The CIV
budget approved last spring pre
dicted 1,580 freshmen, said CIV
Director and History Prof. Paul
Seaver. When over 1,600 freshmen
enrolled, Seaver was forced to
search elsewhere to fund two new
sections.
"We had to put money together
from other bits and pieces," he
said.
CIV section size has increased
from less than 17 students four
years ago to more than 18, he
said, adding that the figure is an
average and some sections have
more than 20 students. The
increase is part of a 22 percent
overall reduction in the CIV bud
get which began last year.
"At some point, it becomes
impossible for the section leader to
draw out everybody," Seaver said.
"Some people feel increasingly shy
speaking."
Attempting to make CIV cheap
er to run, administrators have con
sidered using graduate students as
lecturers instead of the post-doc
toral fellows now used in some
tracks, all to the dismay of CIV
professors.
"Those of us teaching CIV are
not enthusiastic about that idea,
said Spanish Prof. Mary Pratt,
track coordinator for Europe and
the Americas.

Seaver said hiring teaching
assistants over lecturers could cost
more because graduate students
work only half-time. What CIV
needs is a University mandate
which requires that section sizes
be kept at a constant, low number,
Seaver said. "It requires flexibility
of funding that we don't have at
the moment," he said.
Shoven said he does not antici
pate further cuts but emphasized
it could Ih* an option if the school's
budget is decreased. "It wouldn't
be something I'd like to do, but
[one must! consider anything," he
said.
Faculty upset
Angered most by the cuts are
lecturers who teach the sections
and the professors who supervise
them.
"It's certainly not ideal to
increase the size of the sections,"
Fliegelman said. "It mitigates
against a creation of an interactive
community." He encouraged stu
dents to enroll in as many semi
nars as possible for closer contact
with faculty members.
Holeton has seen his classes
increase from 15 to 20 students
during his tenure and called the
hike "a shame and a scandal."
Not only do class increases
affect students' ability to learn and
participate, he said, but the lectur
er is unable to spend enough qual
ity time with each student.
"We have an intensive, individ
ualized, conference-based pro
gram." said Holeton, also a resi
dent fellow in Rinconada. "It's
really hard to give students the
best writing help that we can when
the section sizes increase to this
extent."
Like Fliegelman, Holeton
encouraged students to voice their
opinions. "If I were a Stanford
student, undergraduate, I'd be
really asking questions about this,
asking the administration and the
deans what's the deal," he said.
Although effects of the most recent sec
tion size increase are still unclear, some fac
ulty are unhappy about the seven-year cost
cutting trend which many claim is adverse
ly affecting undergraduate education.
In April, John Shoven, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, announced
that section sizes would increase by 10 per
cent, meaning larger sections and fewer
graduate teaching assistant positions.
"The general picture is it's going to
mean a loss of jobs for some TAs in some
departments," said Assoc. Dean of Gradu
ate Policy George Dekker. "The impact is

going to vary a lot."
April's decision, however, came as no
surprise to Humanities and Sciences de
partments. In 1988, budget cuts forced a re
evaluation and subsequent cutbacks
throughout the school.
The next year, an ASSU survey of 193
teaching assistants found that most felt the
increase was hindering undergraduate edu
cat ion.
"The larger the sect ions get, the easier it
is not to participate and to shrug off learn
ing to the last second," said Rich Stolz, a
senior American Studies major and mem
ber of the Council of Presidents. Most of
his sections have had 20 or more students
including one English section which had

26, he added.
The undergraduate voice — virtually
silent in recent years on this topic — is the
true test of the policy's impact, faculty
members say.
"The real index is if students feel they're
getting cheated," said Prof. Jay Fliegelman,
chair of the English Depart merit. "If they do
feel that way, I hope they say something
about it. It's not the only place [the admin
istration) can cut."
Freshmen greatly affected

creased section sizes, however,cannot make

freshman programs have been hit the hard

Writing and Critical Thinking — lauded
in last year's report by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education — has risen to
an average of 18 students per class in the ad
vanced four-unit courses, said Claude Re
ichard, associate director of Writing and
Critical Thinking. The mandatory cap now
stands at 20.
Last week, administrators canceled one
of the freshman English classes because en
rollment was less than half of that cap.
"If writing and critical thinking are as
