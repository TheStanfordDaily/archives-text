Amtrak derailed in Arizona
I TV DER, Ariz. (AP) — Saboteurs calling themselves "Sons
of Gestapo" pulled 29 spikes from a stretch of railroad track,
sending an Amtrak train hurtling over a bridge into a dry
stream Ix-d yesterday, authorities said. One person was killed
and about 100 were injured.
A note found outside the train in a remote expanse of
desert referred to the federal sieges at Waco, Texas, and Ruby
Ridge, Idaho — both rallying cries for right-wing, anti-gov
ernment extremists.
" That's what leads me to believe this is a terrorist attack,"
said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Asked who might
be responsible, he said, "It leans toward the domestic side."
Amtrak's Sunset Limited, bound from Miami to Los Ange
les with 248 passengers and 20 crew members, derailed while
crossing a 30-foot-high bridge 50 to 60 miles southwest of
Phoenix sometime after 1 a.m.
Four airs plunged from the bridge at 50 mph, with three
coming to rest on their sides on the sandy bottom of the

desert wash. Passengers, jolted awake, made their way
through jumbled belongings and crawled out the windows.
One person was killed, 12 were seriously hurt and about
100 others suffered less serious injuries, said Sgt. Tim ('amp
bell, a sheriff's spokesman. The dead man was identified as
Mitchell Bates, 41, a sleeping-car attendant based in IjOs
Angeles.
