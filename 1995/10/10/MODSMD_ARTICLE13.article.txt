MEXICO CITY (AP) - A
powerful earthquake shook
Mexico's Pacific coast yes
terday morning, toppling a
seven-story hotel in a south
ern resort, cracking homes
and bridges and killing at
least 29 people, authorities
said.
More than 90 people
were hurt bv the 7.6 magni
tude quake, which was felt
as far north as Dallas and
Oklahoma City, according
to seismologists. It was the
second powerful tremor to
hit Mexico in a month.
The quake struck at 9:37
a.m. and was centered three
miles oil the Pacific Coast
between Colima and Jalisco
states. The tremor lasted
about two minutes and was

followed by two small after
shocks.
Rescuers with bulldozers
and cranes pulled 12 bodies
and 10 injured people from
the Costa Real hotel in the
port and resort area of Man
zanillo, the official news
agency Notimex quoted civil
protection officials as say
ing. Authorities feared the
toll would rise.
A state of emergency was
declared in the state of Jalis
co, where homes and build
ings crumbled. President
Ernesto Zedillo sent five
cabinet members to assess
the damage and coordinate
an emergency plan by the
military.
The U.S. Geological Sur
vey said the quake had a 7.6

magnitude and was cen
tered 15 miles east-south
east of Manzanillo.
Most Mexican quakes
occur along a long swath of
coast from the Guatemalan
border to a point near Puer
to Vallarta, where the Cocos
Plate of the earth's crust is
thrusting under the North
American Plate.
Mexico City is vulnerable
even to distant quakes
because much of it sits atop
the unsteady muddy sedi
ments of drained lake beds.
In Dallas, police received
reports of window blinds
shaking, floors moving and
people losing balance in two
downtown office buildings.
No damage or injuries were
reported.
