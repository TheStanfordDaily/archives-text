AS THE ASSU senate pre
pares to vote on the senate
associates bill tonight, it
must keep in mind that passing
such a hill will not benefit the
student body. In fact, the bill will
only lessen the voice of the stu
dent body, and senators should
strike it down.
The bill, written by Hill Shen,
gives senate associates the right
to vote alongside senators in sen
ate committees. By allowing the
associates to vote in committee,
the bill increases the political
power of senate associates.
Associates are chosen through
an application process at the
beginning of every year. Although
they work closely with senators,
they are not chosen by the student
body. Since they are not directly
elected by students, their influ
ence should be kept to a minimum.
The senate associates bill is
not entirely ill-conceived. It

would allow freshmen to have a
greater say in the senate as sen
ate associates since freshmen
have not had the time to build
seniority or networks, which are
so vital in the political process.
However, the bill does nothing to
guarantee that freshmen will
become senate associates.
The bill could also easily be
misused as a way for members of
the majority party to further
control the senate.
Despite all the good the bill
tries to do, there is simply too
much danger in allowing mem
bers of the senate, and members
of a controlling party, to decide
the vote in committee.
Senate associates must simply
remain as associates in the sen
ate, and not as defacto voting
members of the committee, if the
ASSU is to preserve the demo
cratic principles it claims to
uphold.
