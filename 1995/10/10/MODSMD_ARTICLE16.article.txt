# What's Channel 51?
## 
### 
The words "public
access cable" bring to mind
visions of cheezy, cheap and
usually bland forms of media enter
tainment. Perhaps some of you
even think of Wayne and Garth
bouncing around in the basement.
But now, the University may be
poised to make Channel 51, Stan
ford's public access channel,
something a lot more interesting
and informative.
Eight years ago, Stanford was
given a public access channel bv
the Palo Alto Cable Co-op in
hopes that the University would
help defray the cost of operating
such a venture. Due to planning
difficulties and administrative
delays, the channel languished
mostly as display for brightly col
ored strips.
Now, after pressure from the
Cable Co-op and the public to use
the station, Stanford residents,
along with the citizens of Palo
Alto and Menlo Park, can see lec
tures by Donald Kennedy and

interviews with leading professors
of the University.
Producers of Channel 51 say
they will try to select program
ming that is "most appealing,"
widen the mind and broaden hori
zons. Executive Producer Randy
Bean said that he wants to share
the talent and resources of Stan
ford with a wide audience.
Interest in the public access
network is expected to be keen, as
it has been in most other parts of
the country where this service is
offered. While the station can only
do taped shows now, it is hoped
that they will be able to do live
shows and maybe even cover
events on campus.
We believe Channel 51 is step
ping out, after long delays, in the
right direction and welcome our
own TV network to campus. We
hope they will one day be con
tenders, along with the print
media, in informing and enter
taining people on campus and in
the community.
