## Beyond the default four 
### 
TO THE FROSH who are shopping
for their first classes with wide
eyes and great expectations:
To the sophomores who are feeling the
pressure to settle down on a single area of
study:
And to the juniors who will soon be
getting hate mail from the registrar for
not declaring a major:
When choosing a major, I urge you to
look beyond the "default four." What are
the default four? The term refers to the
four gargantuan Stanford majors where
you can find about 98 percent of the stu
dent body — economics, psychology, com
puter science and human biology.
I'm not saying that these areas
shouldn't be looked at, because they
should. The error comes when students
limit their search to majors they would
have recognized back in the ninth grade.
This is Stanford, for God's sake. You
came here to broaden your horizons, and
if you wanted to major in something
everyone already knows about, you could
have just as easily gone to Yale.
At this point, those of you who have
humored me enough to read this far may
be thinking, "0.K., then I'll look at
majors outside the default four. Let's see,
there's industrial engineering, there's
sociology and, oh, chemistry looks excit
ing!" But when I say look beyond, I don't

mean for you to flip through the Stanford
Bulletin until you find something famil
iar. What I'm asking is that you look at
majors you didn't even know existed.
Here are some great and eccentric
majors worth looking into, along with
their locations in your Bulletin:
science, technology and society (STS) —
page 261
• earth systems — page 62
• international relations — page 531
• symbolic systems — page 716
• urban studies — page 721
• geophysics — page 86
Many students shy away from these
majors because they fear that the world
won't recognize them when they gradu
ate. A money-driven student looks for a
money-fueled major, so that he or she can
waltz right into the First National Bank
and say, "Hi. My name is Ivanamake
Money. 1 graduated from Stanford and I
majored in economics. Now give me my
job." Since your job interviewer will love
Stanford and economics, he'll have no
choice but to give you the job, right? Not
necessarily . . .
Remember that the same year you
graduate, there will be 100 other Stan
ford econ majors looking for the same
jobs you are. And don't forget the hun
dreds of econ majors from Harvard, Yale
and Princeton. Your competitive edge is

now an overflowing valley.
Now imagine you're in a job interview
armed with a B.A. in earth systems. The
interviewer probably never heard of
earth systems and so she inquires about
it. At this point, you not only give a great
description of the major, you articulate
how the study applies to the job, and how
what you've learned applies to the con
cerns of the international community. If
the interviewer laughs you out of the
office, you probably wouldn't be happy
with that job anyway. More likely,
though, you'll intrigue the interviewer,
and out of the 200 applications for the job
with the same schools and experience,
you'll stick out the most in her mind.
So get out your Bulletin and take
another look. This time, don't pass by
those sections with odd-sounding and
eccentric names while you turn from eco
nomics to psychology. Look between and
beyond the default four, and be some
thing more than just one out of a thou
sand majors in another mammoth
department.
