'Die Luft der Freiheit WehV is inannronriute

Loyal stanfordites howled
with rage when the University
administration banned the tradi
tional football symbol of the University,
the Indian, as being inappropriate in
the now civic environment. But he
went. Now my proposal that the Stan
ford motto, "The wind of freedom
blows," deserves the same fate will sim
ply raise administrative eyebrows.
When I came to the United States in
1937, University of Chicago president
Robert Maynard Hutchins was the
great educational spokesman. He would
understand the vow I made when I
came to Stanford in 1941 to never enter
Stanford Stadium. I have broken that
vow only once, on Oct. 2, 1992, to wel
come University President Gerhard
Casper, and to wish god speed to my
grandson Peter who was graduating in
history. President Casper devoted his
inauguration speech largely to the
Latin original of Ulrich von Hutten
(1488-1523), "Videtia illam spirare lib
ertatis auram." Former University
President David Starr Jordan chose the
German translation because of the
prestige German had in his day as the
language of science. I do not know how
good his Latin was.
While I strongly support humanistic
research, I disagree with Jordan's enco
mia of Hutten. They are very fishy,
coming from an ichthyologist. I admit
that Jordan was a rare exemplar of the
two cultures, the scientific and human
ist, of which C.P. Snow wrote.
Although I suspect that Jordan used
the 1874 English translation of G.
Sturge, he is credited with reading in
German the two or three volume biog
raphy of Hutten by David Friedrich

Strauss, which had a great success. It
was the favorite of the scientists in
Germany's kulturkampf.
Strauss had a career somewhat like
that of Hutten, hence the admiration.
Originally a theologian, ho became a
Hegelian, maintaining that the history
of Christian doctrines is their disintegra
tion. He raised a storm of criticism
because his life of Jesus reduced Christ
to a mere historical figure. He became
infatuated with Voltaire and announced
that he had abandoned spiritual philoso
phy for the materialism of modern sci
ence. Scientists just loved it. Hence the
fame of Hutten at the turn of this centu
ry. However, history books which devote
great space to Erasmus, Thomas Moore
and Luther now usually fail to mention
Hutten. To compare him with them is a
distortion of history. He was a flash in
the pan of German cultural history.
As a neo-Hegelian, like the German
historian Nolte, I believe that anthesis
leads to over-reaction. The reaction of
medieval morality as represented by
Dante was the unbridled hedonism of
Hutten's contemporary Francois
Rabelais (1493-1553), a Franciscan
whose slogan was "Fay deque voudras"
do whatever you can. This is what
Hutten really meant by freedom —
freedom from the restraints of divine or
human injunctions. It was in reply to
men like Hutten that the Book of Com
mon Prayer retorted that the service of
God was perfect freedom.
As a human, Hutten was a mess —
politically mixed-up, vain, a sponger
and ill-tempered. He was generally
despised as a man. He broke with
friends, including Erasmus, not
because he was too radical but because

of his lifestyle, which led to his death
from morbus gallicus at the age of 35.
Stanford's Lane Library has a copy of
the 1535 edition of his work on that
disease, for which the French were
blamed. He was the soulmate of Allen
Ginsberg, for whose memorabilia,
including pubic hair, Stanford has
allegedly paid $1 million at the instiga
tion of some members of the English
Department. Now they are demanding
more funding to remedy the low rating
of that department. When angry alum
ni, dunned by the University for contri
butions, wrote letters of protest, they
received no reply.
The hedonistic tradition found its
American expression in the cult of "life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
Not a word about duty or responsibility,
the hallmark of the maligned Puritans
who really promoted freedom. It was
their heirs who lead the fight to free the
slaves; Newt Gingrich has praised their
contribution. Not a word about the
Protestant work ethic which made this
country great. The slogan, an over-reac
tion to the old order, embodies the
demand for rights without the corre
" sponding recognition of responsibilities.
Like Hutten, American society is a
mess, and for the same reasons. Lead
r ers of the most political persuasions
recognize this. In his Book of Virtues,
William Bennett promotes a decalogue
r of self-discipline, compassion, responsi
bility, friendship, work, courage, perse
verance, honesty, loyalty and faith.
This is what the Christian Coalition
demands. The admirable Jewish writer
Gertrude Himmelfarb has called for a
return to Victorian ethics.
In a speech marking the birthday of

Mahatma Gandhi, Hillary Clinton quot
ed as especially timely for a violent
America his Seven Root Causes of Vio
lence, which are wealth without work,
pleasure without conscience, knowledge
without character, commerce without
morality, science without humanity,
worship without sacrifice and politics
without principles. The stress is on
responsibility; there is not a word about
freedom. "Knowledge without charac
ter" hits directly at Hutten.
President Casper implicitly, but not
explicitly, made the same call in his
Sept. 22 speech welcoming freshmen.
He praised the perseverance and deter
mination of Leland and Jane Stanford.
He said that Stanford offered the
opportunity for public service. Howev
er, I had to search for those words. In
the spirit of Ginsberg's Howl, Stanford
banished to vile storage the statuary
representing the Stanford family, that
symbol of the Victorian family. Calls for
its restoration to a place on campus
have been met with silence.
Hutten is the symbol of the disease
which affects our society, and his slo
gan is an expression of it. It should be
replaced. My suggestion, Libra nos a
malo, albeit in harmony with Stanford
architecture, would be rejected as polit
ically incorrect. So as to preserve an
expression of our respect of the Ger
man tradition, what about something
from Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), one
of the greatest men in Western tradi
tion. Surely an appropriate quotation
could be found in "Metaphysics of
Ethics," which our scholarly President
Casper must know well.
