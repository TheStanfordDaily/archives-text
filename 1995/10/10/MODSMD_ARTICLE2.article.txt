# Delts given second chance on eviction
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
University administrators will
re-examine their decision to evict
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
Dean of Students Marc Lee Wais
said yesterday.
After a meeting with Delt
members and alumni Sept. 28,
Wais and Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo al
lowed the fraternity to respond to
disputed allegations of debts and
house mismanagement, Wais
said.
"By the time the meeting con
cluded there was some debate as
to the facts that we made our deci
sion on," Wais said. "I thought it
was fair to the fraternity . . . that
they should be given the opportu
nity to provide the complete and
accurate information."
Wais and Camarillo announced
the Delts must leave their house,
located at 353 Campus Drive, at
the end of fall quarter due to a
debt of more than $40,000, behav
ioral problems and poor house su

pervision. The house is scheduled
to be available to students on the
winter quarter housing waiting
list.
On Thursday, the Delts sub
mitted a 10-page document out
lining their reasons for maintain
ing control of the house. In the let
ter, fraternity members respond
ed to the debt issues and proposed
a plan "which would ensure
sound, effective management of
the house," Wais said.
The letter, however, does not
guarantee that the Office of Stu
dent Activities will back down on
its decision. Administrators will
meet today to plan a timeline for
reviewing the document and ren
dering a decision, Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Heather Dunn said.
It is unknown when the decision
will be made, she said.
"We want to be as fair as we can
to the group," Wais said. "We
hope to make a very timely re
sponse. There are a number of
people (who) will be reviewing the
letter closely to see if it meets the
conditions and expectations."
Delt President Mark Lippert
said that although he is thank
ful for the opportunity, he is
unsure whether it will affect the
current decision. "It seems
there was information that
IWais] did not know about,"
Lippert said. "He was willing to
at least listen to our appeal, but
one has to think that it may be
too late."

Meanwhile, both the Delts and
the Office of Student Activities
have received numerous calls
from Delt alumni asking to
donate money.
Unfortunately, Lippert said,
no donations have been accepted
because of possible NCAA rules
violations. Under the regula
tions, athletes are not allowed to
accept any compensation for
their participation in a sport,
except for scholarships. A major
ity of Delt members play on the
varsity football and baseball
teams.
"It's really touchy ground,"
1 iippert said.
