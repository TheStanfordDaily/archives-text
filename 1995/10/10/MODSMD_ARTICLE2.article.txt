University administrators will
re-examine their decision to evict
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
Dean of Students Marc Lee Wais
said yesterday.
After a meeting with Delt
members and alumni Sept. 28,
Wais and Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo al

disputed allegations of debts and
house mismanagement, Wais

was fair to the fraternity . . . that

located at 353 Campus Drive, at

to be available to students on the
winter quarter housing waiting

lining their reasons for maintain

meet today to plan a timeline for
reviewing the document and ren
dering a decision, Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Heather Dunn said.
It is unknown when the decision
will be made, she said.
"We want to be as fair as we can
to the group," Wais said. "We
hope to make a very timely re

people (who) will be reviewing the
