# Simpson trial
## Race was only tip of iceberg 
### 
YOUR HONOR, WE have
reached a verdict: it
doesn't matter at all."
Years from now, when the
Juice renews his endorsements
and the "real" killer remains
uncaught, social scientists will
ignore the outcome of this
decade's case and focus instead
on what it has meant symboli
cally to the American popula
tion.
Behind the question of guilt
or innocence, but containing it,
lies a broader query: what in
the case and what in the audi
ence motivated this grand
spectacle?
At its heart, the O.J. Simp
son trial represented the nation
in small, a mixture of all the
conflicts the United States must
reconcile in the contemporary
era. Our country collided head
on with the question of power:
how racism, gender inequality,
popularity and class separatism
distribute it differentially across
the land of the free.
Additionally, the case tapped
popular mistrust of the govern
ment and law enforcement offi
cials. And of course, the media
negotiated the whole thing, giv
ing millions of people the com
mon ground for understanding
what occurred in Lance Ito's
court room.
The end results must sicken
the idealists who hold notions
of living in a nation of plenty
where equality is the norm.
When the trial ended, these

facts remained: the defendant
was a wife-beater; the L.A.P.I).
is corrupt and prejudiced; two
people were killed; and the legal
process is a joke. A jury that
believe*! the defendant commit
ted murder could not condemn
him beyond a reasonable doubt
and people cheered the wife
beater's acquittal while others
wept at the injustice.
During this case, people had
to decide where to place their
highest allegiance, where to
see the symbolic "right thing to
do." Since the media escalated
the event to mountainous pro
portions, the (rial automatical
ly assumed symbolic meaning
in which everyone had a stake.
In this manner, people did not
watch because they had noth
ing better to do, but because
this was the best thing to do.
Yes, the defendant may have
decapitated his wife and stabbed
another man to death, but, as
callous as it sounds, that d<x;s
not matter. People kill people
every day. Something more,
dilemmas that Americans have
historically withheld from popu
lar discourse drove public inter
est in this case. The O.J. Simp
son trial was a public unveiling,
a collective production demon
strating that, underneath a pro
gressive and unified mask, the
United States hides a hideously
scarred, patch-work face.
