## Simpson's innocence becomes irrelevant

"The problem of the twentieth cen
tury will be the problem of the
color line."

ONE TRIAL ENDS and
another begins. . ..
"That motherf—er is guilty as
sin," said one observer. "He got off
because he's black."
"It doesn't matter if he's
guilty or not, a black man cannot
get a fair trial in this country,"

another observ
er said. "It was
like every black
man in America
was on trial.
Damn straight.
I cheered when
he was acquit
ted — guilty or
not."
Twelve faceless

jurors, a year spent in anticipation,
endless interviews, übiquitous TV
coverage, polls, opinions, 0.J.-
junkies, a slanderous detective, a
football star, some gloves that
didn't fit and two dead bodies — all
of this has been so overwhelming,
so disturbing, so unavoidable.
Yet, for once I'm on the fence.
For once, I'm not engaged in
debate, not diligently arguing my

point of view, not even arbitrat
ing. I'm just on the fence listening.
And with all this information from
talk shows and neighbors, from
uncles and check stand publica
tions with their opinions and arti
cles discussing I)NA, matching
hairs, barking dogs and slow
speed chases, 1 can't help but
come to one simple conclusion:
America has missed the point.
A trial has been going on, but
it's not about O.J. It's not about
evidence or experts or money or
even whether or not Orcnthal did,
in fact, slay his wife of many years.
Allow me simply to point out
one statistic from a New York
Times poll that, for some reason,
has gone unnoticed for the most
part: 80 percent of white Ameri
cans thought O.J. was guilty,
while 75 percent of black Ameri
cans thought he was innocent.
"Sure, Mark Fuhrman is an
assh—e, but just because the guy
used racial slurs, that does not
mean O.J. is innocent."
"Mark Fuhrman is a typical cop
and a typical example of the racist
and cruel mindset of the big city
police. The problem is, he's not an
exception. Come back to my neigh
borhood some time and I'll intro
duce you to 10 cops just like him."
America is on trial. We have
before us a huge amount of evi

dence against progress. We began
over 200 years ago with the inten
tion of creating a country where
people could be free to pursue
their own interests, as long as
those interests did not interfere
with the interests of our fellow
countrymen. Yet, even in those
early days with their lofty talk of
freedom and safety from injustice,
white, slave-owning lawyers dis
cussed the legality of the slave
trade.
America was founded on con
tradiction.
And what, two centuries later,
in the wake of an over-publicized
trial resulting in an indisputably
large racial division of opinion,
have we come to? We are still sub
ject to different treatment. We are
still, as the phrase goes, living in
two different Americas.
Go to any urban black neigh
borhood in America and ask ques
tions about police treatment.
What you will hear is story after
story of brothers being chased,
uncles being questioned for no
reason, grandmothers and grand
fathers being harassed. You will
hear about beatings, beratings,
false assumptions and false evi
dence. And should one be blessed
with a fair and impartial trial,
keep in mind that according to
1992 legal statistics on homicide, a

black man is over 10 times as like
ly to be sentenced to death than a
white man by a fair and impartial
jury of his peers.
The point is that we didn't see
the same trial. White America
watched a murder trial unfold in
which a seemingly overwhelming
amount of evidence was presented
against O.J. Simpson by a legal
system acting out of "society's"
best interest. The guy was guilty.
Black America watched yet
another black man prosecuted by
a legal institution which has
proven itself throughout history
to be biased, racist, pernicious,
oppressive and acting out of any
thing but the best interest of the
black community. Of course Mark
Fuhrman could have planted evi
dence. It wouldn't be the first
time.
So in the wake of all this, we
are still discussing the facts and
not the issues. We are still talking
about the evidence from O.J.'s
trial to explain why it is that we
disagree and not talking about the
evidence from our differing lives
(hat truly explains why we dis
agree. The trial has only begun.
Mr. Simpson was innocent.
What about us?

has gone unnoticed for the most
part: 80 percent of white Ameri
cans thought O.J. was guilty,
while 75 percent of black Ameri
cans thought he was innocent.
"Sure, Mark Fuhrman is an
assh—e, but just because the guy
used racial slurs, that does not
mean O.J. is innocent."
"Mark Fuhrman is a typical cop
and a typical example of the racist
and cruel mindset of the big city
police. The problem is, he's not an
exception. Come back to my neigh
borhood some time and I'll intro
duce you to 10 cops just like him."
America is on trial. We have
before us a huge amount of evi

dence against progress. We began
over 200 years ago with the inten
tion of creating a country where
people could be free to pursue
their own interests, as long as
those interests did not interfere
with the interests of our fellow
countrymen. Yet, even in those
early days with their lofty talk of
freedom and safety from injustice,
white, slave-owning lawyers dis
cussed the legality of the slave
trade.
America was founded on con
tradiction.
And what, two centuries later,
in the wake of an over-publicized
trial resulting in an indisputably
large racial division of opinion,
have we come to? We are still sub
ject to different treatment. We are
still, as the phrase goes, living in
two different Americas.
Go to any urban black neigh
borhood in America and ask ques
tions about police treatment.
What you will hear is story after
story of brothers being chased,
uncles being questioned for no
reason, grandmothers and grand
fathers being harassed. You will
hear about beatings, beratings,
false assumptions and false evi
dence. And should one be blessed
with a fair and impartial trial,
keep in mind that according to
1992 legal statistics on homicide, a

black man is over 10 times as like
ly to be sentenced to death than a
white man by a fair and impartial
jury of his peers.
The point is that we didn't see
the same trial. White America
watched a murder trial unfold in
which a seemingly overwhelming
amount of evidence was presented
against O.J. Simpson by a legal
system acting out of "society's"
best interest. The guy was guilty.
Black America watched yet
another black man prosecuted by
a legal institution which has
proven itself throughout history
to be biased, racist, pernicious,
oppressive and acting out of any
thing but the best interest of the
black community. Of course Mark
Fuhrman could have planted evi
dence. It wouldn't be the first
time.
So in the wake of all this, we
are still discussing the facts and
not the issues. We are still talking
about the evidence from O.J.'s
trial to explain why it is that we
disagree and not talking about the
evidence from our differing lives
(hat truly explains why we dis
agree. The trial has only begun.
Mr. Simpson was innocent.
What about us?

"The problem of the twentieth cen
tury will be the problem of the
color line."
W.E.B. Dußois, circa 1900
ONE TRIAL ENDS and
another begins. . ..
"That motherf—er is guilty as
sin," said one observer. "He got off
because he's black."
"It doesn't matter if he's
guilty or not, a black man cannot
get a fair trial in this country,"

another observ
er said. "It was
like every black
man in America
was on trial.
Damn straight.
I cheered when
he was acquit
ted — guilty or
not."
Twelve faceless

jurors, a year spent in anticipation,
endless interviews, übiquitous TV
coverage, polls, opinions, 0.J.-
junkies, a slanderous detective, a
football star, some gloves that
didn't fit and two dead bodies — all
of this has been so overwhelming,
so disturbing, so unavoidable.
Yet, for once I'm on the fence.
For once, I'm not engaged in
debate, not diligently arguing my

point of view, not even arbitrat
ing. I'm just on the fence listening.
And with all this information from
talk shows and neighbors, from
uncles and check stand publica
tions with their opinions and arti
cles discussing I)NA, matching
hairs, barking dogs and slow
speed chases, 1 can't help but
come to one simple conclusion:
America has missed the point.
A trial has been going on, but
it's not about O.J. It's not about
evidence or experts or money or
even whether or not Orcnthal did,
in fact, slay his wife of many years.
Allow me simply to point out
one statistic from a New York
Times poll that, for some reason,
has gone unnoticed for the most
part: 80 percent of white Ameri
cans thought O.J. was guilty,
while 75 percent of black Ameri
cans thought he was innocent.
"Sure, Mark Fuhrman is an
