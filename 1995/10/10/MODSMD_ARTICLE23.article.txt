## Sweet vengeance Field hockey shuts out Cal in rematch 
### Alda Leu Contributing writer 
I Stanford 2

Stanford field hockey (4-4
overall, 3-1 Northern Pacific
Conference) got its sweet
revenge last Saturday at home
with a 2-0 shutout against
California (3-4, 3-1). Now, the
Cardinal sits atop the NorPac
standings, although the Bears
boast the same conference
record.
California came to Stan
ford for a rematch after
defeating the Cardinal by a
margin of 1-0 the previous
Saturday. The Cardinal, with
confidence and determina
tion, thoroughly controlled
the game.
Coach Sheryl Johnson
quoted tennis great Bjorn
Borg in her inspirational e
mail messages to her players

last Friday evening when she
wrote, "If you're a good, expe
rienced player, you know
what to do. If you're in trou
ble, you know how to change.
One hundred percent of my
game is instinct. I never stop
and think I'm going to hit a
ball crosscourt or down the
line. I just do it!"
But ironically, Johnson put

'I thought we had
a great game. We
played really
hard.'
— Sheryl Johnson

her faith in the less experi
enced players to come
through with a win. Starting
five freshmen takes a lot of
faith, but come through they
did.
Freshmen scored all of
Stanford's points in the con

test. Forward Carey Cloyd pound
ed in the first shot of the game
with nine minutes, 45 seconds left
in the first period. Cloyd rebound
ed a rejected penalty corner shot
and put the ball in the goal from
the right side. Cloy has been, by
far, the most effective scorer on
the team this season. She has
scored in three of four Stanford
wins for a total of five goals this
year.
Sophomore goaltender Kelly
Naylor defended a succession of
shots on her, allowing Stanford to
take a 2-0 lead with just 2:10
remaining in the first half. Naylor
deflected 12 shots in the game.
The Cardinal's second score
came from freshman midfield
er / defender Sarah Medeiros, who
scored inside the left of the circle
unassisted. The period closed with
cheers of "Go Big Red!" from the
large crowd flowing over the
bleachers.
Stanford had adjusted itself to
combat the California offense,
utilizing the midfielders defen

sively.
"We had more of a defensive
assignment, and we stopped Cal's
transition attack in the midfield,"
Johnson said.
The second half was marked by
close calls, but Stanford managed
to hold off California and take the
win. Overall, the Cardinal had 12
shot attempts in the first period
and nine in the second, compared
to California's six in the first and
five in the second.
Another contributing factor to
Stanford's win was Cal's difficul
ty with real grass. As predicted,
the Bears, who play at home on
artificial turf, were unaccustomed
to the natural terrain.
"They were struggling with
the grass, which is fair because we
had to deal with the same thing
the week before," Johnson said in
reference to the adjustments
Stanford had to make on artificial
turf.
Hut, of course, grass did not
win the game for Stanford. The
women passed well, took advan
tage of shot opportunities and
fought for the ball
"1 thought we had a great
game," Johnson said. "We played
really hard."
