# Ice hockey starts hot
## Cardinal blazes out to two wins in first weekend 
### Howie Meeker 
Stanford's ice hockey team
relied on a combination of grind
ing veterans and promising new
talent this past weekend to
embarrass UCLA 7-2 and edge
USC 4-3. The result for Cardi
nal fans was two intensely
entertaining games, and for the
hockey team, the satisfaction of
getting the season started off on
the right foot.
In the season opener last Fri
day night, the Cardinal encoun
tered few problems. Team cap
tain Fric Haug registered a hat
trick. Other veteran scorers
included David Richardson and
new team captain Stefan Teitge.
On Saturday evening, Stan
ford hosted the more competi
tive and vicious USC Trojans.
"They were pretty cheap," said
defenseman Matt. Blythe. "They
hit with their elbows up, and
they have no qualms about run
ning a guy from behind."
After going up bv a score of 2-
1 after two periods, Stanford
surrendered two quick goals at
the beginning of the third
frame.

"At that point, Stanford was
having a mental lapse," said
Cardinal assistant coach Fric
Israel. "For a team whose game
plan revolves around intelligent
and systematic play, a loss of
concentration like that can be
catastrophic."
Perhaps shocked by the quick
reversal of fortune, the Cardinal
regained its mental and physical
toughness and retaliated with
two goals, one by the dexterous
winger Teitge.
"The puck seems to stick to
his stick," said center iceman
Christian Leone. "He can skate
into a crowd of defenders, get
checked off the puck, literally
twirl his stick around his back
and still manage to put the puck
in the net. It's amazing."
Perhaps the most important
outcome of the weekend series,
however, was the realization
that Stanford's six new for
wards would be able to assume
major roles in this season's
effort. Their high level of ability
will be the key ingredient in
Stanford's success this year.
"I can't tell you how happy I
am to be coaching a team with
this much potential," said head
coach Ernie Ferrari. "Now we
have to put ourselves to work
[and] try to realize that poten

tial. Our basic strategy, histori
cally, has been to out-smart and
out-finesse our opponents, so
now we have to teach our sys
tems to the new players. That,
with some hard conditioning, is
going to make our team the
force to be reckoned with in the
[Pacific Conference 81 this
year."
