# Torrid spikers set to roast Weenies
## Women's volleyball out to extend winning streak against Cal tonight 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
After sweeping its most
important road trip of the season
so far, the No. 4 Stanford
women's volleyball team travels
across the bay tonight to take on
arch-rival California.
The Cardinal (12-2 overall, 8-
0 Pacific 10 Conference), which
has played its previous six games
against ranked opponents, must
avoid a letdown against a Golden
Bears team that is severely out
classed in terms of talent.
"There are no easy games in
this conference," said Stanford
coach Don Shaw. "The lesser
teams, the Oregons, the Cals, are
much improved over last year.
You can't just look at the sched
ule at the beginning of the year
and say which games are going to
be easy wins."
The rivalry with Stanford
seems to bring out the best in
Cal, as evidenced by the match
between the teams at Maples
Pavilion last year. Stanford may
have overlooked the Bears then.
The Bears won only five matches
last year and just two of those
wins came in Pac-10 play.
Nevertheless, Cal fought hard
in the first three games of the
match against Stanford. After
winning the first game 15-11,
Stanford was forced to score 16
points to win game two, taking it
16-14. Stanford's troubles wors
ened in game three, as the gutsy
Bears came back from the break
to score a 15-10 victory. It was
only in game four that Stanford
was able to dominate Cal, win
ning the decisive game 15-5.
This season, Cal again comes
into the match with nothing to
lose. As always, Harmon Gym
will be filled with a hostile audi
ence that would like nothing
more than to see their Bears pull
off a stunning upset.
"Most teams don't expect that
they can beat us," Shaw said.
"They play knowing that they
have nothing to lose, and they
play loose. Everyone likes to give
it their best shot against us."
For Stanford, the objective
will be to maintain consistent
play as much as it will be to
squash the Bears. The Cardinal
is currently playing its best vol
leyball of the season. Stanford
has won nine consecutive match
es and is coming off a road sweep
of the Washington schools, in
which it handed No. 7 Washing
ton State its first loss of the sea-

the same tonight at Harmon Gym against the Bears.
