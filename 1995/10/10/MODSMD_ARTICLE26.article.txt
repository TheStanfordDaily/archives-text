The Stanford men's soccer
team (3-7-1) had the day off yes
terday to recuperate and think
about the direction its season
has taken after suffering
through a rough weekend in the
Pacific Northwest. The Cardinal

dropped its games against Wash
ington (7-3-1) and Oregon State
(8-3-2), both Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation rivals.
The losses, 3-1 to the Huskies
and 5-0 to the Beavers, could not
have come at a worse time con
sidering the Cardinal wanted to
use the two matches to vault into
the conference win column.
Sophomore midfielder Shan
Caw acknowledged the setbacks.
"Being conference games, it hurt
us a lot to lose both," he said. "We
were trying to use these games to
get on the winning track."
"I don't think anyone knows
what's going on," said junior
goalkeeper Ryan Craig. "1 don't
know what's going to happen.
However, some changes will have
to be made."
One of the few bright spots for
the Cardinal was the lone goal
scored by senior midfielder Steve
Kirschhaum Sunday against the
Huskies.
In the Friday match, Oregon
State clobbered the Cardinal,
administering a clinic and humil
iating Stanford with the team's
worst loss in over a year. The 5-0
bloodletting had the Cardinal
longing for the comforts of the
Farm long before the last whis
tle.
"The Oregon State game was
on television, and one of the
announcers doing the play-by
play commented that looking at
the player biographies in the
Stanford media guide, the Cardi
nal should have one of the top
teams in the country," Craig
said. The Cardinal didn't on that
day, however.
The dreary weekend com
pounded with a seven-game win
less streak might have caused
some to hope for the season
finale. Yet, the Cardinal must
heal rapidly and maintain its
focus, as a third of the season
still remains.
