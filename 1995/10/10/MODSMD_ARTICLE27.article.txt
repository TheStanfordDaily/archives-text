# New Year's Day Bowl blues
## 
### 
Here we go again. Every year the same
nightmarish cycle of dread happens. Pic
ture this, if you will:
There you are, sitting on your couch in the
waning twilight hours of Jan. 2. You've toasted
your eyes and fried your brains by watching over
48 consecutive hours of college bowl games on
television, starting with the Sugar Bowl on Dec.
31, finishing with the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2 and
interspersed with reruns of Sports Center
throughout. You've gone into a post-bowl T.V.
coma, the third day of the new year is just around
the corner, and there still isn't a college football
national champion. Yeargh!

Sound familiar? That's been the tune I've her
alded in my New Year with for the past five-out
of-six years. I'm sure that's the same tune you've
heard as well. And frankly, this whole inept bowl
system is really starting to rankle me.
Living in a world where there are no absolutes
(at least that's what they taught me in CIV), I've
learned to cherish and revel in the type of black
and-white definitiveness that sports grants me.
No excuses, no waffling, no politics, no debate.
You either win or lose. You're either the champi
on or not. End of story.
Sure, there are times when you talk about an
underdog's heart and other good stuff like that.
But it still boils down to one thing: the score
board.
Unfortunately, however, the game of college
football does not grant us that luxury. Here, you
don't turn to the scoreboard. You turn to the polls,
and even there you find answers that are often
times more unfulfilling than not. take a
quick highstep down memory lane.
The '89 Miami Hurricanes entered bowl day as
the No. 2 team in the nation with one loss. But by
defeating seventh-ranked Alabama and having
top-ranked Colorado fall to No. 4 Notre Dame, the
Canes vaulted into the so-called No. 1 spot. What

we have here now is a brain-numbing exercise in
logic that I don't even want to touch. . . but I will
anyhow. With the Irish toppling the top-ranked
Buffs and having just one loss like Miami, doesn't
that entitle them to a stake of the crown? Then
again, the Canes shouldn't have to give the
Domers anything. So what's the right answer?
We'll get to that, but first, let's continue.
The 1990 season started a sickening string of
handing out gift-wrapped back-to-back co-champi
onships. First there were the Buffaloes, again in
the national championship hunt, splitting a piece
of their pie with Georgia Tech. The Buffaloes had
one loss, but the Yellow Jackets had a crummy
schedule. There's that twisted logic again. Then in
1991, the undefeated Canes shared the title with
the also undefeated Washington Huskies.
Nice and pretty, right? Both teams are awfully
good, so let's just give them both national champi
onships. Nice happy smiley face. That might hold
in Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, but we're talking
sports here. There's no sharing in sports. Athletes
compete and battle to reach the top. No team
wants to claw, scratch and fight its way to the very
top only to realize that there's another team there
with them. I like sharing as much as the next guy,
but honestly, sharing in football? I have an
answer, hut hold on. Let's do a few more of these.
After a nice 1992 season that provided fans
with a definitive champion in the form of the
Crimson Tide, the '93 and '94 seasons once again
propelled us into a sea of confusion, frustration
and overall dismay.
With Florida State named as national champi
ons in '93, Domers were in an uproar citing a 31-
24 victory earlier in the year versus the Seminoles.
Then again, however, Notre Dame had suffered an
embarrassing loss to Boston College, so the Irish's
credentials were in doubt as well. There were
grumblings that pollsters had been sympathetic to
'Nole coach Bobby Bowden's championship
drought and had given him a mercy ring.
The following '94 season provided even more
bitterness as two teams, Nebraska and Penn
State, went undefeated, yet unlike the Barney
times of years past, there was no sharing. The
Huskers were named as the champions even
though the Nittany Lions displayed one of the best
offenses in the history of college football. Joe Pa
went as far as to have rings made for his team
because there was no reason to believe Penn State


Daniel
Kao
would have lost to Nebraska, or
vice-versa. Once again, there
were rumors of favoritism, in
this case with Husker coach
Tom Osborne, who like Bowden
the year before, had never cap
tured a championship.
That brings us to this glori
ous season where frighteningly,
yet expectedly, it appears that
there will be another addition to
this seemingly endless list of
nonsense. The traumatic flash
backs are closing in already.
As we approach the halfway
point of the season, Florida
State, Nebraska, Florida, Ohio
State, Southern Cal, Kansas
State, Kansas and lowa remain
unbeaten and untied. Amongst
those teams, Florida State,
Nebraska, Florida, Ohio State

and Southern Cal are the legiti
mate contenders to win the
capricious hearts of the poll
sters.
Kansas and Kansas State will
likely fall somewhere along the
line in the brutal Big Eight. In
fact, it's probably safe to remove
a Lawrence Phillips-less Husker
team from that list of contenders
because of a tough schedule that
still features games at home
against Kansas State and Okla
homa and road games versus the
Buffaloes and Jayhawks. And I
don't even want to start thinking
about lowa.
For tin l sake of sanity, our
working list of championship
hopefuls includes FSU, Florida,
Ohio State and USC. The 'Noles
and Gators will duke it out in a
regular season finale, so one of
those teams will be eliminated.
Even if the Gators win, they'll
still have to play in the ultra
menacing SEC Championship

game. Still, if one of the Florida
schools keeps on winning, we are
faced with possibly the same
dilemma as last season: an unde
feated team from the Big 10 or
Pac-10.
Of course, the Buckeyes and
the Trojans won't both finish
the season undefeated because
they'll meet in the Rose Bowl.
Something to keep in mind, how
ever, is that Northwestern and
Ohio State don't play each other,
so keep an eye out for that far
fetched possibility that both
teams will go undefeated in the
Big 10, and the Wildcats could
gain a Rose Bowl berth due to
the tie breaker. Not likely, but
possible.
So taking a step back, and
looking at the big picture, we see
the likely scenario that either
Ohio State or USC will finish
with a spotless record, as will
either FSU or Florida. Feel
those migraines coming on yet?

Even in the case that there is
only one undefeated team, say
Ohio State, there is no guaran
tee that they are indeed the best
team in the nation and worthy
of the national championship.
Just because a team finishes
undefeated doesn't translate to
its being the best. Remember
the whole difficulty-of-schedule
thing. Florida, playing in the
SEC, definitely has a difficult
schedule. So even if the Gators
or Seminoles lose, there's no
way of telling whether or not
they could beat Ohio State or
Southern Cal head-to-head. . .
head-to-head.
Doesn't that sound great? Say
it again. Head-to-head. No ques
tions. No confusion. No split
champions. No doubts about
schedule difficulty. No speculat
ing about pollster favoritism. No
imaginary Sports Illustrated
"head-to-head" articles. Just
answers. We're talking the real

thing.
With college basketball's
March Madness being one of the
nation's hottest and premier
sporting events, t here's no telling
what a college football playoff
could create. If you haven't fig
ured out by now, the whole Bowl
Alliance configuration isn't going
to work as long as the Grand
Daddy of Them All, the Rose
Bowl, remains the black sheep of
the family. With perennial pow
erhouses in both the Pac-10 and
Big 10, there will always be
championship question marks.
The only answer is a playoff
tree that forces teams to go
mano-a-mano. The regular sea
son will still have meaning,
much like in college basketball,
for seeding purposes. And no,
we're not going to have 64
teams. But eight teams is defi
nitely not out of the question.
Look at this season, with eight
teams, we could have one heck of

a playoff.
It makes sense to me, and it
makes sense to you right? So why
isn't it happening? It's time the
championships are decided on the
field, not on paper. There's no
reason why, after a three-month
plus season, there isn't just one
outright, clear, distinct national
champion. People don't "vote" on
whether a touchdown is scored or
a game is won, so why are they
voting on whether a champi
onship title is attained?
I like my shades of gray as
much as the next guy, but I
think we're all tired of wasting
our time. We're tired of wasting
our brain cells. Most of all, we're
tired of playing Nebraska versus
Penn State on our Genesis just
to figure out who's the national
champion. After months of foot
ball and days in front of the tele
vision, we all want a national
champion. We all deserve a
national champion. A real one.

the No. 2 team in the nation with one loss. But by
defeating seventh-ranked Alabama and having
top-ranked Colorado fall to No. 4 Notre Dame, the
Canes vaulted into the so-called No. 1 spot. What

we have here now is a brain-numbing exercise in
logic that I don't even want to touch. . . but I will
anyhow. With the Irish toppling the top-ranked
Buffs and having just one loss like Miami, doesn't
that entitle them to a stake of the crown? Then
again, the Canes shouldn't have to give the
Domers anything. So what's the right answer?
We'll get to that, but first, let's continue.
The 1990 season started a sickening string of
handing out gift-wrapped back-to-back co-champi
onships. First there were the Buffaloes, again in
the national championship hunt, splitting a piece
of their pie with Georgia Tech. The Buffaloes had
one loss, but the Yellow Jackets had a crummy
schedule. There's that twisted logic again. Then in
1991, the undefeated Canes shared the title with
the also undefeated Washington Huskies.
Nice and pretty, right? Both teams are awfully
good, so let's just give them both national champi
onships. Nice happy smiley face. That might hold
in Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, but we're talking
sports here. There's no sharing in sports. Athletes
compete and battle to reach the top. No team
wants to claw, scratch and fight its way to the very
top only to realize that there's another team there
with them. I like sharing as much as the next guy,
but honestly, sharing in football? I have an
answer, hut hold on. Let's do a few more of these.
After a nice 1992 season that provided fans
with a definitive champion in the form of the
Crimson Tide, the '93 and '94 seasons once again
propelled us into a sea of confusion, frustration
and overall dismay.
With Florida State named as national champi
ons in '93, Domers were in an uproar citing a 31-
24 victory earlier in the year versus the Seminoles.
Then again, however, Notre Dame had suffered an
embarrassing loss to Boston College, so the Irish's
credentials were in doubt as well. There were
grumblings that pollsters had been sympathetic to
'Nole coach Bobby Bowden's championship
drought and had given him a mercy ring.
The following '94 season provided even more
bitterness as two teams, Nebraska and Penn
State, went undefeated, yet unlike the Barney
times of years past, there was no sharing. The
Huskers were named as the champions even
though the Nittany Lions displayed one of the best
offenses in the history of college football. Joe Pa
went as far as to have rings made for his team
because there was no reason to believe Penn State


Daniel
Kao
would have lost to Nebraska, or
vice-versa. Once again, there
were rumors of favoritism, in
this case with Husker coach
Tom Osborne, who like Bowden
the year before, had never cap
tured a championship.
That brings us to this glori
ous season where frighteningly,
yet expectedly, it appears that
there will be another addition to
this seemingly endless list of
nonsense. The traumatic flash
backs are closing in already.
As we approach the halfway
point of the season, Florida
State, Nebraska, Florida, Ohio
State, Southern Cal, Kansas
State, Kansas and lowa remain
unbeaten and untied. Amongst
those teams, Florida State,
Nebraska, Florida, Ohio State

and Southern Cal are the legiti
mate contenders to win the
capricious hearts of the poll
sters.
Kansas and Kansas State will
likely fall somewhere along the
line in the brutal Big Eight. In
fact, it's probably safe to remove
a Lawrence Phillips-less Husker
team from that list of contenders
because of a tough schedule that
still features games at home
against Kansas State and Okla
homa and road games versus the
Buffaloes and Jayhawks. And I
don't even want to start thinking
about lowa.
For tin l sake of sanity, our
working list of championship
hopefuls includes FSU, Florida,
Ohio State and USC. The 'Noles
and Gators will duke it out in a
regular season finale, so one of
those teams will be eliminated.
Even if the Gators win, they'll
still have to play in the ultra
menacing SEC Championship

game. Still, if one of the Florida
schools keeps on winning, we are
faced with possibly the same
dilemma as last season: an unde
feated team from the Big 10 or
Pac-10.
Of course, the Buckeyes and
the Trojans won't both finish
the season undefeated because
they'll meet in the Rose Bowl.
Something to keep in mind, how
ever, is that Northwestern and
Ohio State don't play each other,
so keep an eye out for that far
fetched possibility that both
teams will go undefeated in the
Big 10, and the Wildcats could
gain a Rose Bowl berth due to
the tie breaker. Not likely, but
possible.
So taking a step back, and
looking at the big picture, we see
the likely scenario that either
Ohio State or USC will finish
with a spotless record, as will
either FSU or Florida. Feel
those migraines coming on yet?

Even in the case that there is
only one undefeated team, say
Ohio State, there is no guaran
tee that they are indeed the best
team in the nation and worthy
of the national championship.
Just because a team finishes
undefeated doesn't translate to
its being the best. Remember
the whole difficulty-of-schedule
thing. Florida, playing in the
SEC, definitely has a difficult
schedule. So even if the Gators
or Seminoles lose, there's no
way of telling whether or not
they could beat Ohio State or
Southern Cal head-to-head. . .
head-to-head.
Doesn't that sound great? Say
it again. Head-to-head. No ques
tions. No confusion. No split
champions. No doubts about
schedule difficulty. No speculat
ing about pollster favoritism. No
imaginary Sports Illustrated
"head-to-head" articles. Just
answers. We're talking the real

thing.
With college basketball's
March Madness being one of the
nation's hottest and premier
sporting events, t here's no telling
what a college football playoff
could create. If you haven't fig
ured out by now, the whole Bowl
Alliance configuration isn't going
to work as long as the Grand
Daddy of Them All, the Rose
Bowl, remains the black sheep of
the family. With perennial pow
erhouses in both the Pac-10 and
Big 10, there will always be
championship question marks.
The only answer is a playoff
tree that forces teams to go
mano-a-mano. The regular sea
son will still have meaning,
much like in college basketball,
for seeding purposes. And no,
we're not going to have 64
teams. But eight teams is defi
nitely not out of the question.
Look at this season, with eight
teams, we could have one heck of

a playoff.
It makes sense to me, and it
makes sense to you right? So why
isn't it happening? It's time the
championships are decided on the
field, not on paper. There's no
reason why, after a three-month
plus season, there isn't just one
outright, clear, distinct national
champion. People don't "vote" on
whether a touchdown is scored or
a game is won, so why are they
voting on whether a champi
onship title is attained?
I like my shades of gray as
much as the next guy, but I
think we're all tired of wasting
our time. We're tired of wasting
our brain cells. Most of all, we're
tired of playing Nebraska versus
Penn State on our Genesis just
to figure out who's the national
champion. After months of foot
ball and days in front of the tele
vision, we all want a national
champion. We all deserve a
national champion. A real one.
Here we go again. Every year the same
nightmarish cycle of dread happens. Pic
ture this, if you will:
There you are, sitting on your couch in the
waning twilight hours of Jan. 2. You've toasted
your eyes and fried your brains by watching over
48 consecutive hours of college bowl games on
television, starting with the Sugar Bowl on Dec.
31, finishing with the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2 and
interspersed with reruns of Sports Center
throughout. You've gone into a post-bowl T.V.
coma, the third day of the new year is just around
the corner, and there still isn't a college football
national champion. Yeargh!

Sound familiar? That's been the tune I've her
alded in my New Year with for the past five-out
of-six years. I'm sure that's the same tune you've
heard as well. And frankly, this whole inept bowl
system is really starting to rankle me.
Living in a world where there are no absolutes
(at least that's what they taught me in CIV), I've
learned to cherish and revel in the type of black
and-white definitiveness that sports grants me.
No excuses, no waffling, no politics, no debate.
You either win or lose. You're either the champi
on or not. End of story.
Sure, there are times when you talk about an
underdog's heart and other good stuff like that.
But it still boils down to one thing: the score
board.
Unfortunately, however, the game of college
football does not grant us that luxury. Here, you
don't turn to the scoreboard. You turn to the polls,
and even there you find answers that are often
times more unfulfilling than not. take a
quick highstep down memory lane.

with a definitive champion in the form of the
Crimson Tide, the '93 and '94 seasons once again
propelled us into a sea of confusion, frustration
and overall dismay.
With Florida State named as national champi
ons in '93, Domers were in an uproar citing a 31-
24 victory earlier in the year versus the Seminoles.
Then again, however, Notre Dame had suffered an
embarrassing loss to Boston College, so the Irish's
credentials were in doubt as well. There were
grumblings that pollsters had been sympathetic to
'Nole coach Bobby Bowden's championship
drought and had given him a mercy ring.
The following '94 season provided even more
bitterness as two teams, Nebraska and Penn
State, went undefeated, yet unlike the Barney
times of years past, there was no sharing. The
Huskers were named as the champions even
though the Nittany Lions displayed one of the best
offenses in the history of college football. Joe Pa
went as far as to have rings made for his team
because there was no reason to believe Penn State


Daniel
Kao
would have lost to Nebraska, or
vice-versa. Once again, there
were rumors of favoritism, in
this case with Husker coach
Tom Osborne, who like Bowden
the year before, had never cap
tured a championship.
That brings us to this glori
ous season where frighteningly,
yet expectedly, it appears that
there will be another addition to
this seemingly endless list of
nonsense. The traumatic flash
backs are closing in already.
As we approach the halfway
point of the season, Florida
State, Nebraska, Florida, Ohio
State, Southern Cal, Kansas
State, Kansas and lowa remain
unbeaten and untied. Amongst
those teams, Florida State,
Nebraska, Florida, Ohio State

and Southern Cal are the legiti
mate contenders to win the
capricious hearts of the poll
sters.
Kansas and Kansas State will
likely fall somewhere along the
line in the brutal Big Eight. In
fact, it's probably safe to remove
a Lawrence Phillips-less Husker
team from that list of contenders
because of a tough schedule that
still features games at home
against Kansas State and Okla
homa and road games versus the
Buffaloes and Jayhawks. And I
don't even want to start thinking
about lowa.
For tin l sake of sanity, our
working list of championship
hopefuls includes FSU, Florida,
Ohio State and USC. The 'Noles
and Gators will duke it out in a
regular season finale, so one of
those teams will be eliminated.
Even if the Gators win, they'll
still have to play in the ultra
menacing SEC Championship

game. Still, if one of the Florida
schools keeps on winning, we are
faced with possibly the same
dilemma as last season: an unde
feated team from the Big 10 or
Pac-10.
Of course, the Buckeyes and
the Trojans won't both finish
the season undefeated because
they'll meet in the Rose Bowl.
Something to keep in mind, how
ever, is that Northwestern and
Ohio State don't play each other,
so keep an eye out for that far
fetched possibility that both
teams will go undefeated in the
Big 10, and the Wildcats could
gain a Rose Bowl berth due to
the tie breaker. Not likely, but
possible.
So taking a step back, and
looking at the big picture, we see
the likely scenario that either
Ohio State or USC will finish
with a spotless record, as will
either FSU or Florida. Feel
those migraines coming on yet?

Even in the case that there is
only one undefeated team, say
Ohio State, there is no guaran
tee that they are indeed the best
team in the nation and worthy
of the national championship.
Just because a team finishes
undefeated doesn't translate to
its being the best. Remember
the whole difficulty-of-schedule
thing. Florida, playing in the
SEC, definitely has a difficult
schedule. So even if the Gators
or Seminoles lose, there's no
way of telling whether or not
they could beat Ohio State or
Southern Cal head-to-head. . .
head-to-head.
Doesn't that sound great? Say
it again. Head-to-head. No ques
tions. No confusion. No split
champions. No doubts about
schedule difficulty. No speculat
ing about pollster favoritism. No
imaginary Sports Illustrated
"head-to-head" articles. Just
answers. We're talking the real

thing.
With college basketball's
March Madness being one of the
nation's hottest and premier
sporting events, t here's no telling
what a college football playoff
could create. If you haven't fig
ured out by now, the whole Bowl
Alliance configuration isn't going
to work as long as the Grand
Daddy of Them All, the Rose
Bowl, remains the black sheep of
the family. With perennial pow
erhouses in both the Pac-10 and
Big 10, there will always be
championship question marks.
The only answer is a playoff
tree that forces teams to go
mano-a-mano. The regular sea
son will still have meaning,
much like in college basketball,
for seeding purposes. And no,
we're not going to have 64
teams. But eight teams is defi
nitely not out of the question.
Look at this season, with eight
teams, we could have one heck of

a playoff.
It makes sense to me, and it
makes sense to you right? So why
isn't it happening? It's time the
championships are decided on the
field, not on paper. There's no
reason why, after a three-month
plus season, there isn't just one
outright, clear, distinct national
champion. People don't "vote" on
whether a touchdown is scored or
a game is won, so why are they
voting on whether a champi
onship title is attained?
I like my shades of gray as
much as the next guy, but I
think we're all tired of wasting
our time. We're tired of wasting
our brain cells. Most of all, we're
tired of playing Nebraska versus
Penn State on our Genesis just
to figure out who's the national
champion. After months of foot
ball and days in front of the tele
vision, we all want a national
champion. We all deserve a
national champion. A real one.
Here we go again. Every year the same
nightmarish cycle of dread happens. Pic
ture this, if you will:
There you are, sitting on your couch in the
waning twilight hours of Jan. 2. You've toasted
your eyes and fried your brains by watching over
48 consecutive hours of college bowl games on
television, starting with the Sugar Bowl on Dec.
31, finishing with the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2 and
interspersed with reruns of Sports Center
throughout. You've gone into a post-bowl T.V.
coma, the third day of the new year is just around
the corner, and there still isn't a college football
national champion. Yeargh!

Sound familiar? That's been the tune I've her
alded in my New Year with for the past five-out
of-six years. I'm sure that's the same tune you've
heard as well. And frankly, this whole inept bowl
system is really starting to rankle me.
Living in a world where there are no absolutes
(at least that's what they taught me in CIV), I've
learned to cherish and revel in the type of black
and-white definitiveness that sports grants me.
No excuses, no waffling, no politics, no debate.
You either win or lose. You're either the champi
on or not. End of story.
Sure, there are times when you talk about an
underdog's heart and other good stuff like that.
But it still boils down to one thing: the score
board.
Unfortunately, however, the game of college
football does not grant us that luxury. Here, you
don't turn to the scoreboard. You turn to the polls,
and even there you find answers that are often
times more unfulfilling than not. take a
quick highstep down memory lane.
The '89 Miami Hurricanes entered bowl day as
the No. 2 team in the nation with one loss. But by
defeating seventh-ranked Alabama and having
top-ranked Colorado fall to No. 4 Notre Dame, the
Canes vaulted into the so-called No. 1 spot. What

we have here now is a brain-numbing exercise in
logic that I don't even want to touch. . . but I will
anyhow. With the Irish toppling the top-ranked
Buffs and having just one loss like Miami, doesn't
that entitle them to a stake of the crown? Then
again, the Canes shouldn't have to give the
Domers anything. So what's the right answer?
We'll get to that, but first, let's continue.
The 1990 season started a sickening string of
handing out gift-wrapped back-to-back co-champi
onships. First there were the Buffaloes, again in
the national championship hunt, splitting a piece
of their pie with Georgia Tech. The Buffaloes had
one loss, but the Yellow Jackets had a crummy
schedule. There's that twisted logic again. Then in
1991, the undefeated Canes shared the title with
the also undefeated Washington Huskies.
Nice and pretty, right? Both teams are awfully
good, so let's just give them both national champi
onships. Nice happy smiley face. That might hold
in Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, but we're talking
sports here. There's no sharing in sports. Athletes
compete and battle to reach the top. No team
wants to claw, scratch and fight its way to the very
top only to realize that there's another team there
with them. I like sharing as much as the next guy,
but honestly, sharing in football? I have an
answer, hut hold on. Let's do a few more of these.
