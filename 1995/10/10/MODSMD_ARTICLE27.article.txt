# New Year's Day Bowl blues
## 
### 
Here we go again. Every year the same
nightmarish cycle of dread happens. Pic
ture this, if you will:
There you are, sitting on your couch in the
waning twilight hours of Jan. 2. You've toasted
your eyes and fried your brains by watching over
48 consecutive hours of college bowl games on
television, starting with the Sugar Bowl on Dec.
31, finishing with the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2 and
interspersed with reruns of Sports Center
throughout. You've gone into a post-bowl T.V.
coma, the third day of the new year is just around
the corner, and there still isn't a college football
national champion. Yeargh!

Sound familiar? That's been the tune I've her
alded in my New Year with for the past five-out
of-six years. I'm sure that's the same tune you've
heard as well. And frankly, this whole inept bowl
system is really starting to rankle me.
Living in a world where there are no absolutes
(at least that's what they taught me in CIV), I've
learned to cherish and revel in the type of black
and-white definitiveness that sports grants me.
No excuses, no waffling, no politics, no debate.
You either win or lose. You're either the champi
on or not. End of story.
Sure, there are times when you talk about an
underdog's heart and other good stuff like that.
But it still boils down to one thing: the score
board.
Unfortunately, however, the game of college
football does not grant us that luxury. Here, you
don't turn to the scoreboard. You turn to the polls,
and even there you find answers that are often
times more unfulfilling than not. take a
quick highstep down memory lane.
The '89 Miami Hurricanes entered bowl day as
the No. 2 team in the nation with one loss. But by
defeating seventh-ranked Alabama and having
top-ranked Colorado fall to No. 4 Notre Dame, the
Canes vaulted into the so-called No. 1 spot. What

we have here now is a brain-numbing exercise in
logic that I don't even want to touch. . . but I will
anyhow. With the Irish toppling the top-ranked
Buffs and having just one loss like Miami, doesn't
that entitle them to a stake of the crown? Then
again, the Canes shouldn't have to give the
Domers anything. So what's the right answer?
We'll get to that, but first, let's continue.
The 1990 season started a sickening string of
handing out gift-wrapped back-to-back co-champi
onships. First there were the Buffaloes, again in
the national championship hunt, splitting a piece
of their pie with Georgia Tech. The Buffaloes had
one loss, but the Yellow Jackets had a crummy
schedule. There's that twisted logic again. Then in
1991, the undefeated Canes shared the title with
the also undefeated Washington Huskies.
Nice and pretty, right? Both teams are awfully
good, so let's just give them both national champi
onships. Nice happy smiley face. That might hold
in Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, but we're talking
sports here. There's no sharing in sports. Athletes
compete and battle to reach the top. No team
wants to claw, scratch and fight its way to the very
top only to realize that there's another team there
with them. I like sharing as much as the next guy,
but honestly, sharing in football? I have an
answer, hut hold on. Let's do a few more of these.
After a nice 1992 season that provided fans
with a definitive champion in the form of the
Crimson Tide, the '93 and '94 seasons once again
propelled us into a sea of confusion, frustration
and overall dismay.
With Florida State named as national champi
ons in '93, Domers were in an uproar citing a 31-
24 victory earlier in the year versus the Seminoles.
Then again, however, Notre Dame had suffered an
embarrassing loss to Boston College, so the Irish's
credentials were in doubt as well. There were
grumblings that pollsters had been sympathetic to
'Nole coach Bobby Bowden's championship
drought and had given him a mercy ring.
The following '94 season provided even more
bitterness as two teams, Nebraska and Penn
State, went undefeated, yet unlike the Barney
times of years past, there was no sharing. The
Huskers were named as the champions even
though the Nittany Lions displayed one of the best
offenses in the history of college football. Joe Pa
went as far as to have rings made for his team
because there was no reason to believe Penn State
