# Tresidder, Meyer clusters get new safety net

### Perry Chen 
Several weeks ago, Stanford began testing a
new Macintosh program called MacLeland to
improve access and security for SUNet services
such as e-mail.
The University is currently testing the pro
gram in selected campus clusters â€” including
Meyer Library and Tresidder Union. If all goes
well, the program will be available to the entire
Stanford community by winter quarter.
Tony Navarrete, manager of Stanford's Net
work Integration Services, called Maclx?land
"just a piece of a larger effort to make net
worked-based services more available to the
Stanford community."
Among its features, MacLeland will provide
security for users' e-mail passwords and person
al data. Many students use programs like Axess
and Netscape through SUNet. The problem,
Navarrete explained, i.s that the information can
be tapped into and read by other people.
If installed, MacLeland will both encrypt this

data and require user authentication in order to
access it. "This feature helps to address the
major security issue that the Internet propos
es," Navarrete said.
Another service MacLeland will offer is
increased access to the Leland file system. Right
now, when using SUNet services, people must
type in commands through the Unix operating
system in order to find specific documents or
programs. This method often becomes cumber
some and confusing for those without comput
er experience.
Navarrete said MacLeland "adds a graphical
user interface on top of the Unix environment."
This feature means that users can access and
share files by merely "clicking and dragging"
icons.
MacLeland's third major function will be to
restrict access to Stanford's public clusters to
members of the Stanford community. Navar
rete said this will he done by combining the cur
rent diverse administration tools that make up
SUNet.

Currently, users are required to give a login
name and password for some services, like e
mail and Axess, but not for others, like
Netscape. MacLeland would integrate these
services together so that the user would only
have to login once to be able to use all the dif
ferent services. Those with accounts would not
have to log in multiple times while those with
out an account could not access SUNet.
For PC users, development of a Windows ver
sion of Maclx'land is also underway. Navarrete
hopes to begin testing it by January 1996, with a
112 ull release ready by September 19%. Both these
versions, he asserts, will be "a big first step
toward making the distributive computing envi
ronment a lot easier for the average person."
MacLeland i.s based on software initially
develoj>ed by the Digital Equipment Corpora
tion, said Navarrete.
In April, work began to alter MacLeland for
the University and improve its features. During
the summer, a group of faculty, staff and stu
dents tested early versions of MacLeland.
