# Job seekers stressed out by CPPC's new Web site

The Career Planning and Placement
Center's new page on the World Wide Web
designed to make looking for employ
ment easier â€” has proven frustrating for
some students as deadlines approach this
week.
While the Weh page allows students
without access to a Macintosh computer to
connect with the CPPC's registration sys
tem for the first time, it also has raised is
sues of security.
Assistant Director Lance Choy said after
some initial problems, he thinks the new
system is working as well as can be expected.
"We would have liked to have had every
thing up and working a week earlier than we
did," ('hoy said. "The Web page is a work in
progress. We need to tidy things up. "

The deadline to register for on-campus
interviews in the Employer Pre-select Pro
gram was yesterday, and on-line registra
tion allowing students to bid for interviews
takes place tomorrow. Each student s regis
tration is downloaded from the Weh page to
the CPPC's main computer system, allow
ing students to schedule interviews by
phone. Despite the impending deadlines,
many of the pages on t he CP PC Web site are
still under construction.
Some students also question whether the
new system is secure enough. A student can
access his or her file simply by entering his or
her name, Stanford ID and Social Security
number.
"I think the Web is better than the old
system because not everyone owns a Mac,
and you needed one to register with the old
system," said graduate student Andy Dick

inson. "It's nice to have everything on-line.
It saves a trip."
Still, he said, "It's somewhat of a concern
that someone could put in my Social Securi
ty number and overwrite my stuff. Someone
would have to be pretty ambitious to go
around looking up people's social security
numbers, but it's still something that
should probably be taken care of."
Because each student has a separate file
and those files are then downloaded to the
main system, Choy said, information gets
filtered and the CPPC can check question
able files, minimizing the security risk.
"Our major concern is that students will
use different II) numbers in hopes of being
able to schedule more interviews," Choy
said. "Thev will eventually get caught, and
as far as I'm concerned that's a violation of
the Honor Code which I'll pursue. It's easy

to catch."
Choy added that even the old CPPC file
server system was not immune to security
problems.
"Three students tried i( last year and lost
out big time. 1 sent a letter to all the places
they applied saying these people were
bound to do dumb things," he said.
"People who useother II) numbersareso
anxious to get more interview appoint
ments. but I guarantee if they do, doors will
close," he added.
The new system, ('hoy hopes, will cut
down on traffic at the CPPC', take less time
and make registration easier for more stu
dents.

Apple file server and people who had IBMs
