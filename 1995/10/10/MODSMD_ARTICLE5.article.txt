## Author debates 'myths' 
### James Wheaton 
Though it has lasted nearly a
decade, the multiculturalisrn de
hate at Stanford still rages with
intensity. The latest incarnation
of the argument took place last
night at a debate entitled "Multi
culturalisrn: Successor Failure?"
Stanford alumnus and co-au
thor of the new hook "The Diver
sity Myth" Peter Thiol took on
Assoc. Director of Admissions
Jon Reider in a civil argument in
front of a full crowd at Tresid
der's Oak Room West.
The debate, moderated by
ASSU senator Steve Russell,
began with the question of
whether multiculturalisrn at
Stanford has succeeded or failed.
Arguing that it has been a fail
ure, Thiel — who graduated with
a bachelor's degree in philosophy
in 1989 and a law degree in 1992
declared that multiculturalisrn
at Stanford has been neither a
pursuit of intellectual diversity
nor the study of non-Western cul
tures. He cited the shrinking for
eign language departments and
declining student enrollment in
those areas as an example.
"The Office of Multicultural
Development is not recruiting Re
publican professors . . . and stu
dent activists are not trying for
harder foreign language require
ments," said Thiel, the founding
editor of the Stanford Review.
"What multiculturalisrn is can be
told from its context.
"Multiculturalisrn is four
things: the rejections of culturally
transcendent standards, a left
wing critique of Western culture,
political correctness and affirma
tive action," Thiel said.
He proceeded to lambaste a
number of specific Stanford cours
es and problems, including the
controversial "black hair course"
and the overall approach of Cul

tures, Ideas and Values, which he
sees as emphasizing cultural con
text to the exclusion of individuals.
Flourishing his copy of the
Stanford Bulletin for effect, Reider
— who is also an instructor in
Structured Liberal Education
said that while much of Thiel's
argument is reasonable, it is large
ly exaggerated.
"What [Thiel 1 has done is given
me many fast balls to hit out of the
park," he said. "I have nothing to
say about a 'black hair course.' But

Peter, is it in the book? . . . No,
because it was taught for one year,
and stopped in part due to the
furor arising over it."
Reider said multiculturalism
has made Stanford "a more inter
esting place" adding that, "Peter is
among a minority of students who
disagree and are entitled to do so."
When the debate was opened up
to the audience, Bob Beyers, for
mer director of Stanford News
Service, read a lengthy passage
from Thiel's book detailing the

famous " 'Western Culture's got to
go' debate of the 1980s," out of
which CIV was born.
Beyers said his own report of
the Western Culture debate, writ
ten at that time, was substantially
different from Thiel's description,
a discrepancy which Reider later
termed as "troubling, when the
proper account was so readily
available."
Reider also criticized Thiel for
writing that homophobia is not a
problem at Stanford, which Reider

noted is "hard to say in view of the
desecration of the |Gay Libera
tion] statue" in May 1994.
While Thiel did not respond to
these specific allegations, ho did
declare that the Stanford faculty
has largely forgotten the value of
Western culture.
"The consistent intellectual
mistake of the multiculturalists is
that they forget their anti-Western
rhetoric is the rhetoric of the
West," Thiel said. "They are for
getting their perspective, and that

is where we are wrong. That is
where we draw the line."
Responding to students' ques
tions about a "liberal bias" among
Stanford professors, Reider said,
"Stanford students cannot be buf
faloed by some new leftist profes
sor who's a Svengali. In SLE we
have one of the few admitted
socialists on campus, Mark Man
call, and we've had a [Stanford)
Review editor and fundamentalist
Christians. Few would say we're
destroying young minds here."

from Thiel's book detailing the

famous " 'Western Culture's got to
go' debate of the 1980s," out of
which CIV was born.
Beyers said his own report of
the Western Culture debate, writ
ten at that time, was substantially
different from Thiel's description,
a discrepancy which Reider later
termed as "troubling, when the
proper account was so readily
available."
Reider also criticized Thiel for
writing that homophobia is not a
problem at Stanford, which Reider

noted is "hard to say in view of the
desecration of the |Gay Libera
tion] statue" in May 1994.
While Thiel did not respond to
these specific allegations, ho did
declare that the Stanford faculty
has largely forgotten the value of
Western culture.
"The consistent intellectual
mistake of the multiculturalists is
that they forget their anti-Western
rhetoric is the rhetoric of the
West," Thiel said. "They are for
getting their perspective, and that

is where we are wrong. That is
where we draw the line."
Responding to students' ques
tions about a "liberal bias" among
Stanford professors, Reider said,
"Stanford students cannot be buf
faloed by some new leftist profes
sor who's a Svengali. In SLE we
have one of the few admitted
socialists on campus, Mark Man
call, and we've had a [Stanford)
Review editor and fundamentalist
Christians. Few would say we're
destroying young minds here."
