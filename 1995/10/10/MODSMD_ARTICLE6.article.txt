Haywood & Sullivan, a graphic
design firm from Quincy, Mass.,
has been selected to redesign the
University's site on the World
Wide Web, University Communi
cation Services confirmed yester
day.
According to Michael Sullivan,
who will head up the project for
Haywood & Sullivan, the firm
will both design a new "first tier"
of basic pages for Stanford and
produce a number of "style
guides" â€” suggestions for indi
vidual departments, professors
and organizations designing their
own pages.
Sullivan said that he expected
his end of the work to be com
pleted in six weeks, at which
point Communication Services
will be able to "run with it." Sul
livan added that he expected
Stanford to get the first few
pages on-line as soon as they
were available.
The World Wide Web is a fast

growing mechanism whereby in
formation on the Internet is made
more easily accessible and com
bined with graphical and sound
features.
The concept envisioned by
Communication Services is one of
making the Website both more ef
ficient and easier to use, involving
less scrolling and simpler links
than the present system.
Both Director of University
Communications Terry Shepard
and Sullivan also expect the
amount of information at the site
to increase dramatically in the
near future.
"The site will probably double
(in sizel in the next two years," es
timated Sullivan.
Beyond these general guide
lines he has been given, Sullivan
said that hi' as yet had "nothing
concrete" planned for the site and
was "learning as much about
Stanford . . . and its history as
possible."
