# Iranian American detained on way to Farm

Rezaian was five days late to
school.
At the airport terminal to
catch his flight out of Iran, Reza
ian was stopped by a government
official and told he was not al
lowed to leave the country.
The official told him that his
exit visa had expired, and that
because of his dual citizenship,
he needed to stay in Iran to per
form the two years of military
service required of young men.
Rezaian had been visiting
family for a month in Tehran
and Mashad. Although he knew
that there was a chance the gov
ernment would try to make him
stay, Rezaian said that he hadn't
seen his extended family — his
grandparents, aunts and uncles
for over nine years and really
wanted to make the trip.
Because Iran has no embassy
in the United States and the
chances of getting a visa from the
American government are slim,

Rezaian got a visa to travel to
Iran through the Pakistani em
bassy. "Pakistan and Iran use
the Arabic calendar, and they
said it was a three-month visa,
but the dates are different," so
how it corresponds to the West
ern calendar was unclear, Reza
ian said.
"When I got to the gate, they
told me my visa had expired — it
was true, it had expired ten days
before."
Rezaian said that his first re
action was to try to get into the
terminal again, though another
line, after he had disguised him
self by changing clothes and
putting on a hat and sunglasses.
"The official who had been
checking people in my line
seemed really picky. I thought I
could get through, but my mom
freaked out," Rezaian said.
"I didn't know the gravity of
the situation — at first I still
rushed, hoping I could make my
flight, but once I figured out I
couldn't go, I just tried to stay

calm and he mellow."
First kezaian went to the Min
istry of Foreign Studies, hoping
that because he knew people
there, they could expedite his pro
cess. "The people there wrote a
letter stating that all my papers
were in order, but it didn't really
help me." he said.
"My passport says that 1 am a
student, which exempts me from
the military service they wanted
me to stay for," Kezaian said.
"But at the Ministry of (Jeneral
Studies, they refused to acknowl

edge the letter, and they insisted
on seeing copies of my high school
diploma, my transcript and proof
of my enrollment at Stanford."
Rezaian spent four days in the
Ministry of General Studies wait
ing in lines and getting signa
tures. "There were so many peo
ple in there, and it got so hectic,"
Rezaian said. "You had to fight
for your own papers or nothing
would get done."
Rezaian said he sat near the
desk of the soldier whose job it
was to go in and get signatures.
"Everyone hung around there,
pushing for their case. You had to
slide your papers onto the top of
the piles on his desk so he would
pick it up before the others,"

Rezaian said. "If you didn't >
your eye on the situation, things
would get lost and nothing hap
pens. It is really bureaucratic."
Rezaian spent the next couple
of days convincing 1 lie Ministry of
Military Service to let him come
hack and ended up paying the
government $1,300, the equiva
lent of two years salary in Iran, a
trade for the two years of service
he was trying to get out of. "It's
just bureaucratic stupidity, and
very frustrating," Rezaian said
Looking at his Iranian pass
port later, Rezaian noticed that
although it said he had been born
in Chicago, it also said he was an
Iranian resident, which Rezaian
thought was a "convenient typo"

for the Iranian government.
"I wonder if the guy in the Pak
istani embassy (where the Iranian
passport was renewed) did it on
purpose," Rezaian said. "They
wanted the money and knew I
would pay them to get out," he said.
In spite of his trouble there, Reza
ian intends to go back some day.
"I am exempt from the service
until the end of my studies, and I
will be exempt again if I have chil
dren or other dependents," he
said. Rezaian said going back
didn't scare him.
"It will always entail some risk,
but the bottom line is that every
thing there can be solved with
money — that's the way things
are, that's the reality."
