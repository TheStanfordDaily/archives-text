# Iranian American detained on way to Farm

Rezaian was five days late to
school.
At the airport terminal to
catch his flight out of Iran, Reza
ian was stopped by a government
official and told he was not al
lowed to leave the country.
The official told him that his
exit visa had expired, and that
because of his dual citizenship,
he needed to stay in Iran to per
form the two years of military
service required of young men.
Rezaian had been visiting
family for a month in Tehran
and Mashad. Although he knew
that there was a chance the gov
ernment would try to make him
stay, Rezaian said that he hadn't
seen his extended family — his
grandparents, aunts and uncles
for over nine years and really
wanted to make the trip.
Because Iran has no embassy
in the United States and the
chances of getting a visa from the
American government are slim,

Rezaian got a visa to travel to
Iran through the Pakistani em
bassy. "Pakistan and Iran use
the Arabic calendar, and they
said it was a three-month visa,
but the dates are different," so
how it corresponds to the West
ern calendar was unclear, Reza
ian said.
"When I got to the gate, they
told me my visa had expired — it
was true, it had expired ten days
before."
Rezaian said that his first re
action was to try to get into the
terminal again, though another
line, after he had disguised him
self by changing clothes and
putting on a hat and sunglasses.
"The official who had been
checking people in my line
seemed really picky. I thought I
could get through, but my mom
freaked out," Rezaian said.
"I didn't know the gravity of
the situation — at first I still
rushed, hoping I could make my
flight, but once I figured out I
couldn't go, I just tried to stay
