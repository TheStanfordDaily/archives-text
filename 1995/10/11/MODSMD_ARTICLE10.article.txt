# Mall says no spare change

In response to years of customer complaints
about panhandling at Stanford Shopping Center,
management officials have erected a sign encourag
ing mall patrons to donate to homeless organiza
tions, though they have yet to completely discourage
panhandlers.
The sign, which reads "Please discourage pan
handling by donating to organizations that provide
assistance to those in need," is but one step the shop
ping center is taking against panhandling, said Betsy
Bartlett, shopping center spokesperson.
The management is also responsible for the
founding of a direct homeless aid program called
Another Way, a program which she said the man
agement hopes will benefit from customers who read
the sign at the El Camino Real exit of the mall.
"The shopping center already donates canned
food and money we collect from our fountains to
Another Way," Bartlett said. "The sign at least lets
customers know we are doing something about the
problem of homelessness and that we care."
According to Bartlett, customers have been call
ing and writing letters to the management for a few
years, claiming the panhandlers at the mall exit
make them feel unsafe and uncomfortable.
But shopping center security has never had to
physically remove any panhandlers from the site, as
most are careful to stay on public property owned by
CalTrans and off the shopping center's private prop
erty, Bartlett said.
"I've never noticed more than one or two people
asking for money around that area," said sophomore
and Palo Alto native Alexandra Davis. "And I really
haven't noticed an increase or decrease in panhan

dlers since the sign went up."
Burtlett agreed that the sign, which went up in
late May, hasn't exactly been a success in curbing
the panhandling problem, though she stressed that
the management takes each complaint to heart and
encourages customers to donate to the Another Way
program or others like it.
"Beyond that, there's really not much else we can
do," she said.
