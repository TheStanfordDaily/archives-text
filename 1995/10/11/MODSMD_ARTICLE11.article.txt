Chicago prof wins econ prize
CHICAGO (AP) — A University of
Chicago professor won the Nobel Prize in
economics yesterday for demonstrating
how people's fears and expectations can
frustrate policymakers' efforts to shape
the economy.
Robert E. Lucas* work is now part of
the "standard toolbox" of all economists,
said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sci
ences in Stockholm.
Lucas, 58, found that government
attempts to regulate unemployment and
investment by regulating the national
money supply often are undermined by
the way people adjust their spending
decisions and other behavior.
"Models that we thought were guiding
the fine-tuning of the economy through
monetary and fiscal polity are more or less
useless," Lucas said after winning the
prize. "Those models presumed a lot of stu
pidity on the part of the ordinary citizen."
Pyramid to undergo repairs
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — Neither wars
nor earthquakes nor Mother Nature
dampened the allure of Chephren, one of
the three famed pyramids of Giza. But
the breath of millions of tourists did.
Egyptian antiquities officials put a
fist-sized padlock on its yellow, iron door

yesterday, closing it for three months so
vacuums can suck out humid air sapping
its structural strength and restorers can
preserve its flaking, limestone walls.
"We art' really giving the pyramid a
rest for the first time," said Zalii
Hawass, chief inspector of the Giza
Plateau.
Vapor from the breathing of 2 million
tourists a year has taken its toll on the
4,600-year-old pyramid outside Cairo,
drawing salts from its huge limestone
blocks and weakening them.
Brothers falls from dogsled
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Psy
chologist Dr. .Joyce Brothers wanted an
authentic Alaska experience and she got
one suffering a broken nose, chipped
teeth and a concussion in a fall during a
dogsled ride.
The 66-year-old columnist and TV host
was treated at a hospital and left town
Sunday, canceling a lecture yesterday at
the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts.
"It was a freak accident," Brothers
said in a telephone interview from New
Jersey, where a dentist bonded her teeth
and a plastic surgeon told her she won't
need surgery on her nose
"It was swollen, but it w;is not pushed
out of shape,' she said. "I look fine
except for my lip, thank goodness."
