SARA.IEVC), Bosnia -Herzegovina
(AP) — Natural gas and electricity
(lowed into Sarajevo yesterday, but
government officials indicated a U.S.-
brokered cease-fire would probably be
delayed once ag;un.
The Bosnian government and rebel
Serbs met for hours with 11. N. officials
in an effort to overcome obstacles to a
cease-fire that was to begin today at
one minute after midnight (4:01 p.m
PDT, Tuesday).
U.N. officials said the government
was dissatisfied with the amount of
electricity the city was receiving.
A senior government official, speak

ing on condition of anonymity, said the
cease-fire "won't happen tonight." A
U.N. official, also on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that.
Some U.N. officials speculated the
real reason might be to allow govern
ment and allied Croat forces to capture
more Serb territory before the cease
fire freezes front lines in northwest
Bosnia and south of Sarajevo.
After three days of intense shelling,
Croats and Muslims reportedly cap
tured the Serb-held town of Mrkonjic
Grad in northwestern Bosnia, about 75
miles northwest of Sarajevo.
Croatian TV said the town had been

captured late yesterday and showed
pictures of Croat soldiers driving
through in tanks.
Earlier, in Sarajevo, music drifted
through streets in the shell-battered
suburb of Dobrinja as residents
plugged in stereos, radios and televi
sions for the first time in months.
"This is so good — running water,
hot shower, TV on. It made me forget
the war for a little while," said Boris
Saric, a 30-year-old policeman.
Late in the day, about half the
besieged Bosnian capital had electricity
and water service, and at least one
third had natural gas.
