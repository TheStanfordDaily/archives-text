# Court hears arguments on gay-rights bill

### 
WASHINGTON (AF) - Several
Supreme Court justices expressed doubts
yesterday about a 1992 Colorado constitu
tional amendment that bans all state and
local laws giving homosexuals "special
protection" against discrimination in such
matters as housing and employment .
The amendment was thrown out by
Colorado's highest court, which said it
denied homosexuals an equal voice in gov
ernment.
"I've never seen a statute like this,"
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told Col
orado Solicitor General Timothy M.
Tvmkovich, who argued for reinstating

t he amendment.
"I lere the class (of homosexuals) seems
to be adopted for its own sake," Kennedy
said.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor won
dered whether the amendment would
allow public libraries to refuse to lend
books to gays.
And Justice John Paul Stevens asked,
"What is the rational basis for the people
outside of Aspen telling the people in
Aspen they cannot have this nondiscrimi
nation provision?"
Justice Antonin Scalia appeared more
sympathetic to Tymkovich's argument

that ordinances protecting gays against
bias in housing, employment and public
accommodations constitute "special pro
tection."
"They are laws that provide special
protection to that particular category of
person," Sealia said. People are not enti
tled to such protection if they are rejected
for a job "because you don't like the way
they comb their hair," lie added.
The justices' ruling, expected by July, may
indicate their views on the continuing
validity of the high court's 1986 ruling
that let states outlaw consensual homo
sexual conduct.
