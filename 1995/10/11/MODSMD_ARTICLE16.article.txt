## Editorial Sexual harassment 
### 
Forcing RAs to report
cases that come before
them would be an error

YOUR RESIDENT assistant
was the person who knew
everyone's name on the first
day of freshman Orientation,
organized that big game of cap
ture the flag, made you come have
fun with the rest of the dorm
when you were down and who
never minded staying up late to
talk to you about all sorts of
things.
In short, your RA was a trusted
friend, adviser and surrogate par
ent or older sibling in those first
few overwhelming months away
from home.
Now, a new Residential Educa
tion policy would, if passed, put
that trust in jeopardy. As a revi
sion to the 1993 University sexual
harassment policy, RAs have been
told that they cannot promise con
fidentiality to residents who come
to them to discuss cases of sexual
harassment. Instead, RAs would
be required to report these inci
dents to the residence dean.
University officials have said
this requirement puts the inter
ests of the victim first, ensuring
that he or she gets the proper
help needed to deal with the inci
dent and that the offender is
made fully accountable. Despite
these noble reasons, the new poli
cy may actually backfire, decreas
ing the number of residents who
would be willing to ask for help at
all.
There are other resources on
campus that deal with cases of
harassment, places where stu
dents are guaranteed confiden
tiality. The Bridge and Cowell
Student Health Center's Counsel
ing and Psychological Services are
staffed by professionals who are
not required to report the people
who come to them for help. But
there is a difference between talk
ing to a stranger and talking to

someone you already know and
respect. Many students will opt
for the latter or choose nothing at
all.
In particular, the new sexual
harassment policy will be detri
mental to freshmen. Older stu
dents often have friends and
other trusted advisers to whom
they can turn for help if needed,
but first-year students tend to
put great stock in their RAs as
caretakers and may not know
where else to go. If they are
afraid of reporting an incident to
the RA, they may not get any
help at all — something the sexu
al harassment task force cannot
possibly want.
Some help, even if unreported,
is better than none. RAs should
not be turned into policemen —
autonomous witnesses who are
required to report everything they
hear. Instead, Res Ed should
instruct RAs to encourage resi
dents who come to them with
harassment complaints to report
the incident.
Giving victims the reasons to
report harassment and leaving it
as their choice may in fact be more
effective in allowing victims to put
the incident behind them, as it
lets them feel that they have truly
made the decision to move on.
Otherwise, a victim may end up
feeling as violated by a trusted RA
as he or she was by the perpetra
tor of the harassment.
Stanford is famous for having
one of the best residential educa
tion programs in the world. Stu
dents from other schools are often
surprised by and jealous of how
close Stanford residents get to
their in-house peer advisers. But
driving students away from the
people they are supposed to trust
most will be a detriment to Res
Ed's currently excellent reputa
tion.
Though RAs have been trained
under this new policy, it has a
number of levels to pass before it
is implemented. The policy is not
yet law, and it should be reconsid
ered before it Liets that far
