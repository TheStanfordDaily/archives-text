Multiculturalism is
n eit her tech n ocra tic
nor ideological idea
The Oct. 9 Daily attributes to Peter
Thiel the statement that my commit
ment as president to multiculturalism
was "ideological;" he goes on to say that
President Casper is a more "technocrat
ic" administrator who "defends it with
out understanding it ."
He is wrong on both counts.
I said often that the term "multieultur
alism" has simply been asked to carry too
much political and emotional freight; it
has become a term to which people with
all sorts of beliefs attach their own mean
ings. What I was ideologically committed
to — and I still am — is equal opportuni
ty, by which I mean the accessibility of
Stanford to persons of all races, circum
stances, etc.; and diversity, by which 1
mean the gathering of a student body
whose members share and learn from a
broad range of different life experiences.
I believe that President Casper also
subscribes to these values. His state
ment, which was directed at affirmative
action as a vehicle for achieving them,
was eloquent, timely and exactly right
for Stanford.

Insulting the Deadheads
was not a nice thing to do
I just read your "spoof on classi
fieds in the Oct. 6 Daily. I noticed that
only one of your fake ads had a name
associated with it. Why do you need to
have an offensive name to represent
Deadheads (Moonbeam Buttrot)? The
ad was cute and funny without the
name. Adding the name only made it

offensive.
For all my years as a follower of the
Dead (2(i plus) I have had to put up with
media bashing of Deadheads (watch Jay
Leno any night). Things seemed to get
better after Jerry Garcia died when I
actually read some kind words about
Deadheads. Instead of acknowledging
the passing of a major cultural figure,
The Daily chose to join the hashers. I
guess I should have expected as much
from an immature bunch of college stu
dents pretending to put out a newspa
per.

Earth Sciences degree is
useful in ang tgpe of job
I would like to make a correction to
Tony Small's column of Oct. 10. Earth
systems graduates receive a bachelor of
science, not a 8.A., as he stated in his
colli mn.
A graduate in earth systems certain
ly understands "the concerns of the
international community" and definite
ly understands the relationships
between people and their environment.
For relevance to a job interview, I think
it would be much better to emphasize
how earth systems is an interdisci
plinary major in which one learns not
only to characterize complex problems,
but how to solve them as well. This
skill makes a B.S. in earth systems use
ful for any type of job.
Earth systems majors currently hold
positions in many fields, both public and
private. Graduates have positions in
environmental consulting, environmen
tal engineering, management consulting,
research at NASA / Ames, legal work,
non-profit advocacy work, venture capi
talism and at the U.S. Forest Service,
among others. Several are currently in
Ph.D. programs as well.

I appreciate Tony's recognition of the
earth systems program and invite him to
stop by anytime, as his off ice is quite
close to the earth systems office. I
strongly suggest that anyone interested
in earth systems stop hy the office in
building 360-360 A to learn more about
the program from either the five student
advisors or other students.

*The Diversity Myth' has
errors in attack on course
No doubt a useful critique of Stan
ford's multicultural initiatives over the
past decade could be written. "The
Diversity Myth" by David Sacks and
Peter Thiel, filled with misrepresenta
tions, distortions and factual errors, is
not such a critique. For example, let me
set the record straight and correct the
numerous errors and false
statements in their attack on my Stan
ford course, "History of Rights in the
United States."
First, a quick look at the syllabus,
which I will happily make available to
anyone interested, makes it clear that far
from ignoring the Declaration of Inde
pendence and the Constitution, the
course was fully grounded in those basic
documents and was a constitutional his
tory with a social and intellectual history
approach. I taught both the Declaration
and the Constitution as enduring, living
documents without which an American
rights tradition would be inconceivable
It is false that the entire course
"extolled rights movements originating
in the 19605." The course concentrated
heavily on 19th century rights move
ments, such as abolitionism and
women's suffrage. It is also false that
the course did not consider opposing
views. For instance, students read most
of "Rights Talk" by Marv Ann (ilendon,
a conservative Harvard Law professor

opposed to reproductive rights who
recently served as the Vatican's chief
delegate to the U.N. Women's Confer
ence in Beijing.
It is also not true that students did
not challenge my particular views, to the
extent that I expressed them in class, or
that I discouraged opposing views. 1
would not be a college professor if I did
not consider it vitally important to
encourage disagreement, dissent and
alternative perspectives.

Extra points that Smart's

I would like to thank Brendan
McCullough for his provocative editori
al, "Our little blue friends." Yes, com
munist undertones are all too apparent
m the seemingly innocuous "Smurfs." I
would just like to point out two addi
tional facts that were perhaps over
looked. First, recall that the Smurfs'
mortal enemies, Gargamel and his "fat
cat" were always trying to catch
Smurfs — to turn them into gold! The
allusion to the evils of capitalism are
quite obvious. While Gargamel is try
ing to make money by exploiting the
"working class" Smurfs, the Smurfs
have built for themselves a collective
society where everyone produces for
the community. Second, one of the
tenets of communism is that even the
weak are able to contribute to the good
of society. Note how there was always
that one stupid Smurf (I forget his
name — maybe it was "Stupid") always
ended up inadvertently saving all the
other Smurfs from trouble. These are
just two more examples in support of
Mr. McCullough's thesis. Smurf the
smurfin' Smurfs.

Extra points that Smart's

I would like to thank Brendan
McCullough for his provocative editori
al, "Our little blue friends." Yes, com
munist undertones are all too apparent
m the seemingly innocuous "Smurfs." I
would just like to point out two addi
tional facts that were perhaps over
looked. First, recall that the Smurfs'
mortal enemies, Gargamel and his "fat
cat" were always trying to catch
Smurfs — to turn them into gold! The
allusion to the evils of capitalism are
quite obvious. While Gargamel is try
ing to make money by exploiting the
"working class" Smurfs, the Smurfs
have built for themselves a collective
society where everyone produces for
the community. Second, one of the
tenets of communism is that even the
weak are able to contribute to the good
of society. Note how there was always
that one stupid Smurf (I forget his
name — maybe it was "Stupid") always
ended up inadvertently saving all the
other Smurfs from trouble. These are
just two more examples in support of
Mr. McCullough's thesis. Smurf the
smurfin' Smurfs.

Multiculturalism is
n eit her tech n ocra tic
nor ideological idea
The Oct. 9 Daily attributes to Peter
Thiel the statement that my commit
ment as president to multiculturalism
was "ideological;" he goes on to say that
President Casper is a more "technocrat
ic" administrator who "defends it with
out understanding it ."
He is wrong on both counts.
I said often that the term "multieultur
alism" has simply been asked to carry too
much political and emotional freight; it
has become a term to which people with
all sorts of beliefs attach their own mean
ings. What I was ideologically committed
to — and I still am — is equal opportuni
ty, by which I mean the accessibility of
Stanford to persons of all races, circum
stances, etc.; and diversity, by which 1
mean the gathering of a student body
whose members share and learn from a
broad range of different life experiences.
I believe that President Casper also
subscribes to these values. His state
ment, which was directed at affirmative
action as a vehicle for achieving them,
was eloquent, timely and exactly right
for Stanford.

Insulting the Deadheads
was not a nice thing to do
I just read your "spoof on classi
fieds in the Oct. 6 Daily. I noticed that
only one of your fake ads had a name
associated with it. Why do you need to
have an offensive name to represent
Deadheads (Moonbeam Buttrot)? The
ad was cute and funny without the
name. Adding the name only made it

offensive.
For all my years as a follower of the
Dead (2(i plus) I have had to put up with
media bashing of Deadheads (watch Jay
Leno any night). Things seemed to get
better after Jerry Garcia died when I
actually read some kind words about
Deadheads. Instead of acknowledging
the passing of a major cultural figure,
The Daily chose to join the hashers. I
guess I should have expected as much
from an immature bunch of college stu
dents pretending to put out a newspa
per.

Earth Sciences degree is
useful in ang tgpe of job
I would like to make a correction to
Tony Small's column of Oct. 10. Earth
systems graduates receive a bachelor of
science, not a 8.A., as he stated in his
colli mn.
A graduate in earth systems certain
ly understands "the concerns of the
international community" and definite
ly understands the relationships
between people and their environment.
For relevance to a job interview, I think
it would be much better to emphasize
how earth systems is an interdisci
plinary major in which one learns not
only to characterize complex problems,
but how to solve them as well. This
skill makes a B.S. in earth systems use
ful for any type of job.
Earth systems majors currently hold
positions in many fields, both public and
private. Graduates have positions in
environmental consulting, environmen
tal engineering, management consulting,
research at NASA / Ames, legal work,
non-profit advocacy work, venture capi
talism and at the U.S. Forest Service,
among others. Several are currently in
Ph.D. programs as well.

I appreciate Tony's recognition of the
earth systems program and invite him to
stop by anytime, as his off ice is quite
close to the earth systems office. I
strongly suggest that anyone interested
in earth systems stop hy the office in
building 360-360 A to learn more about
the program from either the five student
advisors or other students.

*The Diversity Myth' has
errors in attack on course
No doubt a useful critique of Stan
ford's multicultural initiatives over the
past decade could be written. "The
Diversity Myth" by David Sacks and
Peter Thiel, filled with misrepresenta
tions, distortions and factual errors, is
not such a critique. For example, let me
set the record straight and correct the
numerous errors and false
statements in their attack on my Stan
ford course, "History of Rights in the
United States."
First, a quick look at the syllabus,
which I will happily make available to
anyone interested, makes it clear that far
from ignoring the Declaration of Inde
pendence and the Constitution, the
course was fully grounded in those basic
documents and was a constitutional his
tory with a social and intellectual history
approach. I taught both the Declaration
and the Constitution as enduring, living
documents without which an American
rights tradition would be inconceivable
It is false that the entire course
"extolled rights movements originating
in the 19605." The course concentrated
heavily on 19th century rights move
ments, such as abolitionism and
women's suffrage. It is also false that
the course did not consider opposing
views. For instance, students read most
of "Rights Talk" by Marv Ann (ilendon,
a conservative Harvard Law professor

opposed to reproductive rights who
recently served as the Vatican's chief
delegate to the U.N. Women's Confer
ence in Beijing.
It is also not true that students did
not challenge my particular views, to the
extent that I expressed them in class, or
that I discouraged opposing views. 1
would not be a college professor if I did
not consider it vitally important to
encourage disagreement, dissent and
alternative perspectives.
