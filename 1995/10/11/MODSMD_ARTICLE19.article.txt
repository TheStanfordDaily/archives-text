## Some advice for Casper 
### 
GEKI IAUI), a FEW days ago, while I
was wandering around in the
Foothills, I began to think about
things that could improve Stanford. And
then I stopped. 1 thought it would be more
appropriate for you to ponder that issue. I
did not see you during my rambling, so I
assumed you were using a different setting
as inspiration for this issue (perhaps drink
ing Mai Tais on the patio of the Hoover
House.) 1 started thinking about improve
ments again - and here are some I came
up with.
• Give out free combs in White Plaza
plain black combs. You don't need to be
there personally. A simple dispenser will be
fine. But be sure to include instructions on
how to play n comb and a pamphlet about
the dangers of lice.
• Establish a hippie studies program. Stan
ford is located in a historically significant
area. The Bay Area was the axis of the 60s.
Ken Kesey used to live on Perry Lane
before he moved to I«i Honda with his
Pranksters, and Neil Young now lives
there. The Vets Hospital was used by the
government as a laboratory for testing
LSD on humans. The Grateful Dead
scrooped around campus and played
around Paly.
Universities should have a strong con
nection with their environments Just a.s
midwestern schools should have strong
agronomy programs, Stanford should have
hippie studies.
Granted, although our wealth of tech

nological scholarship well matches Silicon
Valley, hippie studies would help recreate
the attitude Stanford once had. Instead of
being the heartbeat of neo-conservatism
and narrow-minded money mongering,
Stanford was once viewed as the liberal
academic hot spot. Now, I don't advocate
one-dimensionalism, but it would be neat if
Stanford could regain some of its old aura
So attract some students who will dance
around Hoover Tower with (ires burning
and beads jangling.
• Speaking of Hoover Tower, hire someone
to play the carillon bells at least weekly.
I'm sure the cost will be worth it. Wouldn't
it Ih> nice to hear the clanging and pealing?
You could even lead an accompanying
parade through the Quad and dress in a
spunky outfit. For example, you could be a
court jester, dressed only in clothes of felt
and the funky shoes that curl up at the
tips. It would be like the Pied Piper leading
students out of (TV class.
• Establish a campus in San Francisco. It
doesn't have to be anything official. It
could be a series of tents in Golden Gate
Park or some VW Microbuses parked on
the street in the Lower Haight (and maybe
even an LGBCG outpost parked in the
('astro). ()r buy a part of the Presidio. This
could be especially attractive to hippie
studiers, who can have quarter-long he
ins.
The overseas campuses may be nice and
all, but Stanford students do not take
enough advantage of the city. It's so close,

but the specter of a pre-med class, or Cal-
Train for the wheel-less, seriously stifles
sojourns.
• Zone this campus by eating habits. It
would be kind of like the Toyon eating
clubs, but far more reaching. Reserve Flo
Mo for (lie ovo-lactos, The Row for omni
vores, Stern for people who eat Fro Yo,
Governor's Corner for those who like
Jing-Jings, the Suites for serious alco
holics, etc. The strung out can live in Mir
rielees.
• Drop the 20-unit limit and all the silly
bureaucratic rules that smother the indi
vidual academic drive out of students.
• Scrap the idea of financial solvency.
Invoke the reason that as an academic
institution, Stanford cannot he bothered
with things like a balanced budget. We
must have higher ideals than those linked
to currency We should follow the ideals of
the spirit and of the human desire to learn
to grow and to check out new stuff. (If
there are any serious problems, refer to
and blame them on the GSB.)
()nce this is done, you'll be able to set up
stations across campus to continuously
provide free beer.
