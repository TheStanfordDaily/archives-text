# Unprecedented sweep at tournament
## Debate Society wins laurels at Harvard 
### Paul Bodnar 
The Stanford Debate Society
stunned the collegiate debate
community this weekend by
sweeping every category of the
199f> Harvard National Debate
Tournament, the largest parlia
mentary debate competition of
the year.
Stanford won the "Top School"
award, as its three highest-placing
teams obtained the highest aggre
gate placing of all the colleges rep
resented. Stanford's performance
was particularly impressive be
cause it brought only four teams
to the tournament while some
schools sent more than 10 teams.
In addition, the Stanford A
team of senior Matthew Meskell
and junior Brendan Maher won
the Harvard Cup itself. The two
finished first and second respec
tively out 0f260 debaters in the in
dividual speaker competition.
"They did unbelievably well,"
said John Bronsteen, the presi
dent of the Harvard Debate Soci
ety and one of the organizers of
the event. "1 haven't seen that
kind of dominance in any tourna
ment in the years that I've been
debating. It's unheard of and vir
tually impossible to achieve. It has
never happened before and I don't
think we're going to see it happen
again for a long time."
More than 130 teams from 40
schools attended the Harvard
tournament, widely considered
the crown jewel of the debate year
next to the year-end nat ionals. Ac
cording to Bronsteen, never be
fore in the history of the tourna
ment had the two members of the
winning team also swept the
speakers' competition.
Meskell said he was over
whelmed by the result.
"It still hasn't hit me complete
ly," he said. "Everyone gave us a
standing ovation at the conclusion
of the finals, and it was simply
amazing."
Maher was also thrilled, say

ing, "I've never been so excited
about debating in my life. It's a
huge commitment, but when you
get an award such as this it is all
worth it."
But other than expressing their
personal jubilation, both debaters
also stressed the positive implica
tions of the victory for the Stan
ford team as a whole.
"Winning at Harvard is impor
tant because it establishes Stan
ford as a threat to the
Meskell explained. "That's going
to help the school in the future,
because the Harvard tournament
is regarded as the best in Ameri
ca."
Junior Patrick Shields, a B
team member who was ranked
15th speaker, concurred.
"This gives us a good reputa
tion and helps us in terms of mo
mentum," Shields said. "It's suc
cess that Stanford has worked
very hard for throughout the past
few years."
The Harvard tournament falls
at the beginning of the debating
year, and success there can help
energize a team to excel for the re
mainder of the season, which
stretches from early September
until March.
Each of the 130 teams at the
tournament competed in five pre
liminary rounds, after which the
eight teams with the best records
advanced to the quarterfinals.
Although the Stanford I) team
of rookie sophomores Mark Peter
son and Bimal Shah did not ad
vance beyond the initial rounds,
the C team, seniors Matthew Ra
binowitz and Edward Prince,
nearly did, losing only in the final
fifth round. Rabinowitz nonethe
less netted a seventh-place speak
er award.
The B team of Shields and
sophomore Jennifer Derr lost in
the quarterfinals to Fordham Uni
versity's A team. Meskell and
Maher, however, defeated Yale
University's A team to take the top
prize.
Parliamentary debate consists
of 40-minute contests between
teams of two arguing a resolution
which they receive 10 minutes
before the start of each round.
Thus, a quick wit and rhetorical

proficiency constitute the most
important skills of a debater, said
Meskell.
Maher added that Stanford is at
a distinct disadvantage compared
to most other debate schools
because it does not attend each of
the weekly tournaments, which
are held mostly on the East Coast.
"It's very difficult for Stanford
to win things for that reason,"
Maher commented. "For us to

overcome that obstacle is unbe
lievable."
The Harvard Cup, which is lent
each year to the winning team, is
currently en route from Yale. The
Debate Society hopes to display it
publicly at a special alumni debate
Sunday. That event, which will give
Stanford alumni a chance to debate
the current team members, will be
held in Memorial Auditorium as
part of Homecoming act ivities.
