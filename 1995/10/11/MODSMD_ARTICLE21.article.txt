## How to use "The every-other-day plan"®

"Michael, why you crying?"
"I just told Gabi I liked her and she
kicked me."
"So kick her back. "
— conversation between myself
and An Newberger, second grade
I LEARNED something rather inter
esting this summer — girls still care
who calls whom when and how often
I learned this, of course, the hard way,
thinking it just didn't matter if 1 called
that nice, short Julie girl from Yale back
before she returned my first message.
After all, she'd offered me her number
unprovoked and she even told my good
friend Ari, who introduced us at that
barbecue, that she thought 1 was "cute.'
But lo', she looked upon that second
message blinking on her answering
machine as an irritating sign of weaknet
in this would-be muffin de machismo
and gave me, as my good friend Ari, wh<
introduced us at that barbecue, said,
"the Heisman."
Hut rather than getting all goober
melancholic about all this, I thought it

best to sit and ponder and try, maybe, to
figure out what exactly had happened
here. . . to see if there was something to
be learned from this unexplored nook.
Here's what 1 came up with:
There are, unfortunately, a set of
rules to the romantic pursuit. They are
intricate, elaborate, individualized and
generally unknown to males.
1 am speaking, of course, of the chess
game; of the subtleties and feints and
mild manipulations that are, again
unfortunately, still the decreed norm in
our purportedly enlightened age; of the
multifarious rules and customs and mat
ing rituals, most of which revolve around
a) the telephone, and b) making someone
like you all the more bv acting as if you
really don't give a hooey.
Its true Very little has changed since
tlu> sandlot games of name calling and
hair pulling and generally being nasty
with the one you'd rather be extra nice
to because it still works, because it
still applies.
And if you (you guys, that is) have any
intention of showering with someone else

while not wearing your flip-flops, you've
got to abide. Because, in the eyes of the
ovaried other, every move of the pawn
across the checkerboard is imbued with
meaning. Call too often and you're
pushy; wait too long and you're not
showing enough interest. Tell her twice
that you like her and you're too attached;
tell her just once and you're too aloof.
No matter what anyone says, it is still
women in the modern dating world who
decide who does what, when, with whom
and whether your roommate will be
allowed to watch.
And one of the greatest problems here
is that for each woman, the rules are dif
ferent. No two are alike: this one feels all
gushy inside that you called her twice in
two days, that one thinks you a goofus.
So just when you think you've got it
down that you're the studliest player
ever to set foot on the Boggle board,
some new potential pookie throws a
whole new set of dice your way.
But wait guys! Good news. There is
something of a solution to all this; there
is a "best bet" way to go.

After two weeks of brooding and an
informal survey of about a dozen female
friends, I devised a mode of operation
that is by no means fail-safe, but offers
at least a fair chance. I call it"The every
other-day plan."®
You meet, you flirt, you wait a full
day, you call her. You wait another day,
she calls you back. She gets your
machine, you wait a third day, you call
her back. (Do your best to be sure she is
home at this time — two simultaneous
rounds of tag exhausts much of the
momentum, and unless you had an
exceptional hair day when you first met,
you 'll probably lose your footing here.)
Hopefully you catch her, and if you do,
and if she hasn't fallen in love some
where else in the interim — which hap
pens mind you — a date is made for the
next available and convenient evening.
The date is had, you wait a day, you
call, the cycle continues.
This process, by playing the averages,
is designed to account for some of the
variability in female preference (p > .05),
But the major plus of the"The every-

other-day plan"® is that, as the name
implies, every other day is free. Accord
ingly, someone frugal with their time can
use this windfall waiting period to pur
sue a second flirtation on the off days.
(For example, on Monday one calls A, on
Tuesday, B. Wednesday, one handles the
return call from A, Thursday, B, and so
on — you'll have to forgive me if the
writing here has become dry and techni
cal, but we are, after all, speaking of
emotion.)
But something is definitely lost here. I
was looking for something of a sweet,
open-ended (perhaps even naked) rejoin
der with that nice, short Julie girl from
Yale and I was left with a dichotomy —
an "us versus them" view of the other
wise fun-for-all chase.
So why don't we give it a shot? Forgo
just once this counterproductive ritual
and judge one another on more substan
tial things — like good hair and
wardrobe.
And if not, well. . . 1 guess I'll talk to
you Friday.
