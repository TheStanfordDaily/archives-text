## Music grooves: the Bug on CDs 
### Anand Ramachandran Contributing writer 
QHow exactly do those
• spinning, shiny CD
• things work?

A When was the Inst time
•you popped a CD of
• into your stereo or
looked something up in the CD
ROM dictionary of organic com
pounds or perhaps watched a
laser-disc movie? Chances are,
you did one of these things with
in the last few days. You may
already know most of the impor
tant things about CDs (like
where to get them, how much
they cost and when the next
Smashing Pumpkins release will
be). But do you know how CDs
work? If you don't, relax and the
bug will explain all.
CDs (compact discs) and CD
ROMs (CD-Read Only Memory)
are basically one and the same
thing. Both are optical disks. In
English, they are little discs of
plastic and metal that can hold
lots and lots of information. Pic
tures, text, sound and video can
all be stored on a CD or CD-ROM
in a tiny space that would nor
mally take hundreds of pages of
print. Unlike a regular LP record
that can get scratched up easily
by your cat, CD information is
stored digitally, as long
sequences of numbers. The plas
tic coating on a CD protects the
metal disc inside which contains
the numbers.
So you want to know how
CDs actually work, eh? Well, it's
really quite simple. You simply
put the CD into the CD player

and push the button. Okay!
Okay! Here's the news: CDs are
made from semiconductors
which respond to certain stim
uli. After the raw CD is made,
information is encoded onto the
surface of the CD by a laser.
This information could be any
thing, from music to text. The
laser heats the semiconductor
material in certain precise loca
tions, burning tiny pits on the
surface of the CD. These pits are
later decoded in binary, the
common language of all com
puters, as ones. The non-pits or
peaks are equivalent to zeros.
The groove itself, on which the
pits are made, is thinner than a
human hair and spirals around
the CD for a length of nearly a
mile.
When a CD player or comput
er reads a CD, it uses a photo
detector to capture the low ener
gy laser light that is bounced off
the CD surface. The relative
intensities of the light pulses
received depends on the
sequence of pits and peaks. This
information is then digitized and
readied for processing, either as
sound through your stereo
speakers or as text and images
on your computer.
As far as the cost of the tech
nology and the future of the CD
media, there have been many
recent advances. Current com
mercial CDs are read-only. That
is, the people who make them
don't want you to ... accidental
ly erase your R.E.M. CD —
wouldn't that be a major bum
mer, dude. New WORM (Write
Once Read Many) CD-ROM
drives have been developed that
allow the user to write once onto
an optical disk and use the writ
ten disk as a regular CD-ROM.
Even more newfangled CD tech
nology includes the erasable CD
disc drive developed by the Max
tor Corporation.
Finally, what does all this
incredible CD stuff cost? Well, to
you and me, an average music
CD runs for about $15, but to the
CD makers, the cost of produc
ing one CD is about 3 cents!
Think about that the next time
you're in the market for a new
compact disc or CD-ROM ... and
hey! - tell them the bug sent you.
