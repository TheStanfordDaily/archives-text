# Baby sleep worth thinking about
## Slumber key to brain development 
### Esther Wong 
Although it occupies nearly
one third of each day, most of us
will never think twice about
what really happens between the
time we curl up under the covers
at night and the moment we
awaken to the ringing of our
alarm clocks the next morning.
However, new research at the
Medical Center suggests that
sleep is worth thinking about.
Recent research conducted by
Marcos Frank, a fifth-year grad
uate student in Stanford's neu
rosciences program, in collabora
tion with Pediatrics Prof. Ron
Ariagno, suggests that a REM
like infant sleep state may have
important implications in brain
development.
"A common misconception
about sleep is that it's what you
do when you're not doing any
thing else," said Frank. Frank,
whose findings were published in
the August issue of Sleep
Research, works under Craig
Heller, a biological sciences pro
fessor whose chief research
interests include sleep and circa
dian rhythms.
The physiological function of
sleep has been investigated for
quite some time. Since the dis
covery of REM sleep in the mid
-19505, scientists have been par
ticularly intrigued by the signifi
cant amount of time infants
spend in what appeared to be a
REM-like sleep state.
"It's possible that infants
spend a lot of time asleep because
it's important to the develop
ment of the brain," said Frank,
whose work has helped dispel the
myth that sleep is a sedentary
state merely serving a restora
tive role. "We know that sleep is
homeostatically regulated in
young animals, and tight regula
tion usually implies a function,"
he said.
Frank used a baby rat model
to examine changes in brain
activity as the animals develop
various sleep states. Neonatal
mammals are believed to spend
most of their time in a REM-like
state called active sleep, regarded
as a neonatal analog to adult

REM sleep, which is character
ized by rapid eye movements,
waking-like patterns of brain
activity and paralysis of most
muscular activity. Scientists
have traditionally assumed that
infants alternate between active
(REM-like) sleep and quiet (non
REM-like) sleep.
However, Frank's recent find
ings suggest that both conditions
may arise from a single, undiffer
entiated pre-sleep state in which
the animal has no discrete pat
terns of brain activity. "In every
mammal studied, this (pre-sleep)
state exists but hasn't been
acknowledged," explained
Frank. Thus far, sleep studies
using rats, cats, sheep, rabbits
and humans have produced rela
tively consistent results.
The three primary vigilant
states — REM, non-REMand
wakefulness are identified by
specific patterns of brain, cardio
vascular and respiratory activity.
These states are analyzed by
observing the animal's behavior,
monitoring changes in brain
activity using electrical record
ing techniques such as tho EEG
(electroencephalogram), as well
as using pharmacological
approaches to examine whether
drugs known to cause certain
changes in adult sleep states will
mediate the same effects in
infants.
In addition to providing
insight into neonatal brain devel
opment, sleep research could
also have significant clinical
impact, especially for disorders
such as Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome (SIDS). Afflicting
about one in 1,000 babies, SIDS
is the greatest cause of infant
death within the first year.
Because developmental dis
turbances are believed to be par
tially responsible for the
increased risk of death in
infants, human studies have
been initiated to complement the
animal models used in basic sci
ence research.
"What we propose to do in this
work is to develop an animal
model to understand SIDS," said
Ariagno. "We hope these studies
will enable us to understand the

ontogeny of sleep, thermoregula
tion and circadian rhythms, and
how they interact to control reg
ulatory function."
The collaboration between the
Heller and Ariagno labs repre
sents one of the first efforts to
correlate animal models of sleep
with human neonatology. "It's
important to understand how
these sleep states develop in the
first place before we begin to
address how they go wrong in
SIDS," said Frank.
Ariagno stressed the impor
tance of data obtained from ani
mal models in guiding clinical
studies on sleep. Animal studies
often yield more exacting results
because the analytical methods
are much more invasive than
those used in studies of human
infants.
In basic research, electrodes
can be inserted directly into the
animal's brain, while electrical
recordings of human infants
must be made externally. All

infants used in Ariagno's
research were born pre-terminal
ly, and parental consent must be
obtained before the babies are
studied in the lab.
Infant sleep patterns are ana
lyzed using three primary meth
ods: polysomnograms, which use
surface electrodes to make multi
channel electrical recordings of
the baby's brain; videosomno
grams, which are time-lapse
cameras used to observe a baby's
behavior during extended peri
ods of sleep; and motion-sensi
tive mattresses, which detect any
motion made while the baby is
asleep.
Despite the notable progress
made in defining sleep stages in
infants, scientists are far from
answering the most fundamental
questions. "The next level is to
go right to the bruin — back to
tht> original problems of why
infants sleep so much and why
they spend time in these states of
sleep," explained Frank.

tion and circadian rhythms, and
how they interact to control reg
ulatory function."
The collaboration between the
Heller and Ariagno labs repre
sents one of the first efforts to
correlate animal models of sleep
with human neonatology. "It's
important to understand how
these sleep states develop in the
first place before we begin to
address how they go wrong in
SIDS," said Frank.
Ariagno stressed the impor
tance of data obtained from ani
mal models in guiding clinical
studies on sleep. Animal studies
often yield more exacting results
because the analytical methods
are much more invasive than
those used in studies of human
infants.
In basic research, electrodes
can be inserted directly into the
animal's brain, while electrical
recordings of human infants
must be made externally. All

infants used in Ariagno's
research were born pre-terminal
ly, and parental consent must be
obtained before the babies are
studied in the lab.
Infant sleep patterns are ana
lyzed using three primary meth
ods: polysomnograms, which use
surface electrodes to make multi
channel electrical recordings of
the baby's brain; videosomno
grams, which are time-lapse
cameras used to observe a baby's
behavior during extended peri
ods of sleep; and motion-sensi
tive mattresses, which detect any
motion made while the baby is
asleep.
Despite the notable progress
made in defining sleep stages in
infants, scientists are far from
answering the most fundamental
questions. "The next level is to
go right to the bruin — back to
tht> original problems of why
infants sleep so much and why
they spend time in these states of
sleep," explained Frank.

Basic human sleep states — including REM, non-REMand infant
pre-sleep.
Although it occupies nearly
one third of each day, most of us
will never think twice about
what really happens between the
time we curl up under the covers
at night and the moment we
awaken to the ringing of our
alarm clocks the next morning.
However, new research at the
Medical Center suggests that
sleep is worth thinking about.
Recent research conducted by
Marcos Frank, a fifth-year grad
uate student in Stanford's neu
rosciences program, in collabora
tion with Pediatrics Prof. Ron
Ariagno, suggests that a REM
like infant sleep state may have
important implications in brain
development.
"A common misconception
about sleep is that it's what you
do when you're not doing any
thing else," said Frank. Frank,
whose findings were published in
the August issue of Sleep
Research, works under Craig
Heller, a biological sciences pro
fessor whose chief research
interests include sleep and circa
dian rhythms.
The physiological function of
sleep has been investigated for
quite some time. Since the dis
covery of REM sleep in the mid
-19505, scientists have been par
ticularly intrigued by the signifi
cant amount of time infants
spend in what appeared to be a
REM-like sleep state.
"It's possible that infants
spend a lot of time asleep because
it's important to the develop
ment of the brain," said Frank,
whose work has helped dispel the
myth that sleep is a sedentary
state merely serving a restora
tive role. "We know that sleep is
homeostatically regulated in
young animals, and tight regula
tion usually implies a function,"
he said.
Frank used a baby rat model
to examine changes in brain
activity as the animals develop
various sleep states. Neonatal
mammals are believed to spend
most of their time in a REM-like
state called active sleep, regarded
as a neonatal analog to adult

REM sleep, which is character
ized by rapid eye movements,
waking-like patterns of brain
activity and paralysis of most
muscular activity. Scientists
have traditionally assumed that
infants alternate between active
(REM-like) sleep and quiet (non
REM-like) sleep.
However, Frank's recent find
ings suggest that both conditions
may arise from a single, undiffer
entiated pre-sleep state in which
the animal has no discrete pat
terns of brain activity. "In every
mammal studied, this (pre-sleep)
state exists but hasn't been
acknowledged," explained
Frank. Thus far, sleep studies
using rats, cats, sheep, rabbits
and humans have produced rela
tively consistent results.
The three primary vigilant
states — REM, non-REMand
wakefulness are identified by
specific patterns of brain, cardio
vascular and respiratory activity.
These states are analyzed by
observing the animal's behavior,
monitoring changes in brain
activity using electrical record
ing techniques such as tho EEG
(electroencephalogram), as well
as using pharmacological
approaches to examine whether
drugs known to cause certain
changes in adult sleep states will
mediate the same effects in
infants.
In addition to providing
insight into neonatal brain devel
opment, sleep research could
also have significant clinical
impact, especially for disorders
such as Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome (SIDS). Afflicting
about one in 1,000 babies, SIDS
is the greatest cause of infant
death within the first year.
Because developmental dis
turbances are believed to be par
tially responsible for the
increased risk of death in
infants, human studies have
been initiated to complement the
animal models used in basic sci
ence research.
"What we propose to do in this
work is to develop an animal
model to understand SIDS," said
Ariagno. "We hope these studies
will enable us to understand the

ontogeny of sleep, thermoregula
tion and circadian rhythms, and
how they interact to control reg
ulatory function."
