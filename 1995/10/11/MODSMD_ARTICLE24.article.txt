# Caught up a creek ...
## Fish ladders aid in upstream mobility 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
"Fish should be allowed to swim upstream,"
said Stanford civil engineer Bob Hockey. And so
it was.
This remarkably simple vision was the driv
ing force for the decision to build a fish ladder
to help spawning steelhead trout swim up Los
Trancos Creek, located north of Stanford. The
project was a cooperative effort between Stan
ford, the California Department of Fish and
Game, California Trout and Santa Clara Coun
ty"
Can fish climb? And why would they want
to? And most importantly, why would they
need a ladder to swim up a creek?
The steelhead use the fresh water of Los
Trancos Creek to spawn, or deposit eggs for the
purpose of breeding. Species like the steelhead
trout and salmon spend most of their time in
salty sea water, but travel upstream to fresh
water to spawn. For thousands of years the
steelhead have made this trek from the ocean to
Los Trancos Creek.
This changed in 1929 when Stanford built a
dam in Los Trancos Creek to divert water to
nearby Felt Lake. Since both are located on
Stanford-owned land, the University has water
rights to the property. The diverted water is
used for both fire protection and irrigation pur
poses on the Stanford campus.
The "uphill" journey to fresh water is per
ilous to begin with, but a man-made barrier like
a dam is often too much for the fish to tackle.
As a result, fewer fish survive — and less fish
are born, leading to a dwindling of the species.

The Ix)s 'Francos and San Francisquito creeks
are two of a small handful of fresh water regions
still supporting native steelhead populations.
The trout are considered a "species of special
concern" according to the California Fish and
Game Department and are a good candidate for
federal protection hy an endangered species act.
The Los 'francos fish ladder, designed hy the
California Fish and Game Department, gives
the steelhead a helping hand by allowing them
free passage — while the Stanford dam still
functions to divert water. Thus, the needs of
both fish and man are fulfilled.
What launched the fight for the ladder was a
snapshot of two large dead steelhead trout,
taken in 1988 by Jim Johnson, a stream and
river advocate from Redwood City. He found
the dead fish near the dam, one of them badly
battered from trying to swim up the dam.
Up until that time, it was suspected that the
drought-stricken 1980s might have been the
principle cause of the demise of the steelhead's
habitat. But the photos suggested that the dam
might be an equally dangerous foe.
The discovery that the steelhead population
in IjOs 'Francos Creek might have been dealt a
blow by the dam "started the troops circling the
Stanford University fort," Hockey said.
Besides Jim Johnson, the "troops" consisted
of Joel Scheinberg of the local activist group
California Trout, and Keith Anderson and
Patricia Anderson from California Fish and
Game. California Trout had just received a
$97,000 grant for restoration of the Los Tran
cos/San Francisquito Creek watershed, includ
ing Los Trancos Creek, but this made up less
than a third of the $350,000 bill for construe

tion of the ladder.
They approached Stanford's then-Utilities
Manager Michael McKnight, summoning Stan
ford's cooperation to build the fish ladder.
McKnight convinced Stanford officials of the
importance of the ladder, stemming from the
fact that the University has responsibilities to
the creek, Bob Hockey explained.
I lockey took over for McKnight when he left
Stanford in 1994. Construction of the ladder
was completed this August — on schedule. The
real test of how well it works, however, awaits
the beginning of the winter rainy season, said
Hockey.
Hockey explained that the whole effort rep
resents a testament to Stanford's concern for
the community. Negotiations between the uni
versity and environmental groups like Califor
nia Trout and CRMP, the Coordinated
Resource Management and Planning group,
have set the stage for ridding the "town and
gown friction" — all too common of University
community relations, Hockey emphasized.
"There should never be a problem anymore
knocking on Stanford's door," he said.
In fact, relations have progressed to the
point where CRMP has submitted a "wish list"
to Stanford for the next 50 years. Probably
their biggest request would be to get rid of all
dams affecting the watershed, according to
Ilockey.
Towards achieving that goal, plans are cur
rently underway to test a dam alternative called
an "infiltration gallery," according to Hockey.
Such a device pumps water from areas where
creeks converge. If such technology is effective,
CRMP's wishes might soon become reality.

Ilockey.
Towards achieving that goal, plans are cur
rently underway to test a dam alternative called
an "infiltration gallery," according to Hockey.
Such a device pumps water from areas where
creeks converge. If such technology is effective,
CRMP's wishes might soon become reality.
"Fish should be allowed to swim upstream,"
said Stanford civil engineer Bob Hockey. And so
it was.
This remarkably simple vision was the driv
ing force for the decision to build a fish ladder
to help spawning steelhead trout swim up Los
Trancos Creek, located north of Stanford. The
project was a cooperative effort between Stan
ford, the California Department of Fish and
Game, California Trout and Santa Clara Coun
ty"
Can fish climb? And why would they want
to? And most importantly, why would they
need a ladder to swim up a creek?
The steelhead use the fresh water of Los
Trancos Creek to spawn, or deposit eggs for the
purpose of breeding. Species like the steelhead
trout and salmon spend most of their time in
salty sea water, but travel upstream to fresh
water to spawn. For thousands of years the
steelhead have made this trek from the ocean to
Los Trancos Creek.
This changed in 1929 when Stanford built a
dam in Los Trancos Creek to divert water to
nearby Felt Lake. Since both are located on
Stanford-owned land, the University has water
rights to the property. The diverted water is
used for both fire protection and irrigation pur
poses on the Stanford campus.
The "uphill" journey to fresh water is per
ilous to begin with, but a man-made barrier like
a dam is often too much for the fish to tackle.
As a result, fewer fish survive — and less fish
are born, leading to a dwindling of the species.

The Ix)s 'Francos and San Francisquito creeks
are two of a small handful of fresh water regions
still supporting native steelhead populations.
The trout are considered a "species of special
concern" according to the California Fish and
Game Department and are a good candidate for
federal protection hy an endangered species act.
The Los 'francos fish ladder, designed hy the
California Fish and Game Department, gives
the steelhead a helping hand by allowing them
free passage — while the Stanford dam still
functions to divert water. Thus, the needs of
both fish and man are fulfilled.
What launched the fight for the ladder was a
snapshot of two large dead steelhead trout,
taken in 1988 by Jim Johnson, a stream and
river advocate from Redwood City. He found
the dead fish near the dam, one of them badly
battered from trying to swim up the dam.
Up until that time, it was suspected that the
drought-stricken 1980s might have been the
principle cause of the demise of the steelhead's
habitat. But the photos suggested that the dam
might be an equally dangerous foe.
The discovery that the steelhead population
in IjOs 'Francos Creek might have been dealt a
blow by the dam "started the troops circling the
Stanford University fort," Hockey said.
Besides Jim Johnson, the "troops" consisted
of Joel Scheinberg of the local activist group
California Trout, and Keith Anderson and
Patricia Anderson from California Fish and
Game. California Trout had just received a
$97,000 grant for restoration of the Los Tran
cos/San Francisquito Creek watershed, includ
ing Los Trancos Creek, but this made up less
than a third of the $350,000 bill for construe

tion of the ladder.
They approached Stanford's then-Utilities
Manager Michael McKnight, summoning Stan
ford's cooperation to build the fish ladder.
McKnight convinced Stanford officials of the
importance of the ladder, stemming from the
fact that the University has responsibilities to
the creek, Bob Hockey explained.
I lockey took over for McKnight when he left
Stanford in 1994. Construction of the ladder
was completed this August — on schedule. The
real test of how well it works, however, awaits
the beginning of the winter rainy season, said
Hockey.
Hockey explained that the whole effort rep
resents a testament to Stanford's concern for
the community. Negotiations between the uni
versity and environmental groups like Califor
nia Trout and CRMP, the Coordinated
Resource Management and Planning group,
have set the stage for ridding the "town and
gown friction" — all too common of University
community relations, Hockey emphasized.
"There should never be a problem anymore
knocking on Stanford's door," he said.
In fact, relations have progressed to the
point where CRMP has submitted a "wish list"
to Stanford for the next 50 years. Probably
their biggest request would be to get rid of all
dams affecting the watershed, according to
Ilockey.
Towards achieving that goal, plans are cur
rently underway to test a dam alternative called
an "infiltration gallery," according to Hockey.
Such a device pumps water from areas where
creeks converge. If such technology is effective,
CRMP's wishes might soon become reality.
