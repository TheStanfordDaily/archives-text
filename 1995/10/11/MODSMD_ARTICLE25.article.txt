# Fund to increase research opportunities for junior physicians
## 
### Sara Bhargava Contributing writer 
At a time when funding for science research is
decreasing rapidly, Stanford is still making for
ward strides. A new Children's Health Research
Center, called CHRC, will be established by the
end of the year at the Medical Center.
The CHRC is sponsored by the National Insti
tute of Child Health and Human Development, a
branch of the National Institute of Health (NIH).
The Institute has issued a series of grants intend
ed to create centers of excellence for pediatric
research. Stanford's grant of $1.4 million over the
next five years will insure that research in this
crucial field will continue.
The specific focus of this series of research cen
ters is to help young physicians trained in pedi
atrics and interested in an academic career. "We
are creating an environment where we can help
people make that transition from clinical to aca

demic [medicine]. The early stages of a career [in
research| are hard," said Dr. Ann Arvin, a profes
sor at the Medical School.
In addition to helping new doctors begin their
careers in academic medicine, CHRC will be
important in continuing the tradition of research
excellence at Stanford. A supportive environment,
as well as the necessary funding, will foster the
development of new medical technology, which
will improve the health of patients in the future.
Three main areas of research will be conducted
in the new core laboratory. Research in genetics
and cancer biology will he directed by Dr Uta
Francke, while the division of developmental biol
ogy will be headed by Dr. David Stevenson. Final
ly, work in immunology and transplant biology
will be directed by Dr. Alan Krensky.
Arvin will be the program director of the new
center. According to Arvin, the role of the direc
tors will be to help the junior physicians with
their research. "It is important to emphasize the

role of senior faculty as mentors," she said.
The development of the CHRC and other
research centers like it comes at a time when
research money is becoming more and more scarce
as the government increasingly cuts funding. "It
used to be that young physicians were able to get
NIH money on their own, but now even senior fac
ulty have a difficult time," said Arvin. "We hope to
encourage people who are motivated to make the
choice to enter academic medicine," she added.
This decrease in research funding has led to a
similar decline in the number of physicians pursu
ing research careers. "The number of M.D.'s who
have chosen academic careers has dropped off
tremendously. The reason is clear â€” people have
seen the problems with that kind of career," Arvin
said. Many new medical school graduates have
seen their professors struggle with issues of fund
ing and the increasing emphasis on clinical care
over work in labs.
Funding for research and equipment will begin

Dec.l. At this point the process of giving awards
to junior faculty will commence. The young physi
cians will write proposals which will then be
reviewed by an advisory committee for approval.
This NIH grant provides resources for attain
ing necessary equipment for research as well as
providing support for the investigators them
selves. "This is a kind of infrastructure grant,"
said Arvin.
Although funding is specifically for physicians,
medical students and undergraduates interested
in pediatric research will also have the opportuni
ty lo get involved in the increase in labs devoted to
the field. The research center and availability of
funding will also serve to attract motivated new
faculty to practice and conduct research at Stan
ford.
Although CHRC's major impact will be on the
Department of Pediatrics, the resulting research
could have important implications for the Univer
sity as a whole, as well as the medical Held.
