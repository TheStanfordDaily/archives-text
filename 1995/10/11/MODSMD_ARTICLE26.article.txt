Like any good Stanford squad, the women's volley
ball team understands the importance of beating the
Weenies. After winning nine straight games, the last
six against ranked opponents, the Cardinal (13-2 over
all, 9-0 Pacific 10 Conference) avoided a letdown, fail
ing to give unranked California a chance to pull out a
win. Stanford maintained its hold on first place in the
Pac-10 with a 15-6, 15-6, 15-4 thrashing of the Golden
Bears.
Unlike in other matches of late, where the Cardinal
has excelled in certain aspects of the game but rarely
put it all together in one performance, last night, Stan
ford dictated the Bears throughout, repeatedly capi
talizing on the slightest opportunity to score. The deci
sive third game witnessed Stanford's most complete
domination, as Cal managed only four points despite
having a 15-minute break between games two and
three to try to figure out a way to slow down the Car
dinal machine.
By the time it was all over, nearly everyone on the
Stanford roster had gotten into the act. Coach Don
Shaw attempted to show some mercy on the defense
less Weenies, using 11 players during the course of the
match. Try as he might, however, Stanford's deep
bench outclassed the Bears' starting six, and the rout
ended only an hour and 15 minutes after it began.
Games one and two were nearly mirror images of
each other, as the Bears totaled six points in each
game. Though an occasional mistake cost Stanford
occasional points, the outcome of each game was never
in douht.
The one redeeming aspect of Berkeley's effort was
its defense. Although even their digs were nothing
close to spectacular, the Bears did manage to thwart
Stanford from completely shutting them out by com
ing up with 40 digs. Sophomore Jessica Dinaberg led
the Weenies with 10 digs, while junior Brooke Weaver

posted eight.
Stanford, meanwhile, fin;illy excelled in every part
of the game. In particular, though, Stanford crushed
the Bears with its potent hitting attack and stellar
blocking. As a team, the Cardinal hit an outstanding
.326 for the night, nearly matching the hitting per
centage of senior Jenrty Swart, Cal's top individual hit
ter on the night at .346.
Outside of Swart's good hitting night, senior
Michelle Wickman enjoyed the best night of the
evening fort he Bears with a dreadful .053 percentage.
As a team, Cal hit a woeful .049. Stanford, by contrast,
had six of the nine players who attempted a kill hit over
.250 and got five performances better than .300.
National Freshman of the Year Kristin Folkl led the
Cardinal with nine kills and an amazing .421 hitting
percentage. The 6-foot-2 sophomore from St. Louis
also had four blocks and six digs in only three games.
As a team, Stanford's blocking was astounding.
The Cardinal totaled 14 blocks in three games. Con
sidering that the Bears only had 103 hitting attempts
and a .10 blocking percentage is considered good, it is
easy to understand that Stanford was in Cal's face all
night. The Bears, meanwhile, managed just three
blocks.
Stanford's dominance is even more impressive in
light of the fact that the Cardinal didn't receive a top
performance from National Player of the Year Cary
Wendell. The 6-foot junior hit only .231 and recorded
just six kills. On the upside, however, she posted 17
assists and led the team with 10 digs.
Continuing to impress as the other setter/outside
hitter in Stanford's 6-2 offense was sophomore Lisa
Sharpley. Sharpley registered six kills in just 15
attempts (for a .400 hitting percentage) and didn't
commit a single hitting error. She also led Stanford
with 20 set assists and had five digs.
Stanford also received an outstanding performance
from sophomore Barbara Ifejika, who amassed eight
kills, hit .350 and had four digs.
In addition to its hitting and blocking prowess, the
Cardinal showed dramatic improvement in limiting its
errors. Alter being plagued by mistakes that cost them
games throughout t he beginning of the season, Stan
ford spikers made only nine hitting errors in 95

Cardinal Lisa Sharpley pounds the ball and Cal in last night's straight set victory. Not much remained of
the Bears after the dust settled

attempts last night. The Bears,
on the other hand, made 25
errors, feeling the brunt of the
Stanford attack.
With the loss, Cal falls to 7-8

overall and 3-6 in the Pac-10.
The Bears have lost four match
es in a row
Up next for the Cardinal is a
two-game break from Pac-10
play, as Stanford comes home to
entertain the University of
Houston on Friday and Notre
Dame on Monday at Maples

posted eight.
Stanford, meanwhile, fin;illy excelled in every part
of the game. In particular, though, Stanford crushed
the Bears with its potent hitting attack and stellar
blocking. As a team, the Cardinal hit an outstanding
.326 for the night, nearly matching the hitting per
centage of senior Jenrty Swart, Cal's top individual hit
ter on the night at .346.
Outside of Swart's good hitting night, senior
Michelle Wickman enjoyed the best night of the
evening fort he Bears with a dreadful .053 percentage.
As a team, Cal hit a woeful .049. Stanford, by contrast,
had six of the nine players who attempted a kill hit over
.250 and got five performances better than .300.
National Freshman of the Year Kristin Folkl led the
Cardinal with nine kills and an amazing .421 hitting
percentage. The 6-foot-2 sophomore from St. Louis
also had four blocks and six digs in only three games.
As a team, Stanford's blocking was astounding.
The Cardinal totaled 14 blocks in three games. Con
sidering that the Bears only had 103 hitting attempts
and a .10 blocking percentage is considered good, it is
easy to understand that Stanford was in Cal's face all
night. The Bears, meanwhile, managed just three
blocks.
Stanford's dominance is even more impressive in
light of the fact that the Cardinal didn't receive a top
performance from National Player of the Year Cary
Wendell. The 6-foot junior hit only .231 and recorded
just six kills. On the upside, however, she posted 17
assists and led the team with 10 digs.
Continuing to impress as the other setter/outside
hitter in Stanford's 6-2 offense was sophomore Lisa
Sharpley. Sharpley registered six kills in just 15
attempts (for a .400 hitting percentage) and didn't
commit a single hitting error. She also led Stanford
with 20 set assists and had five digs.
Stanford also received an outstanding performance
from sophomore Barbara Ifejika, who amassed eight
kills, hit .350 and had four digs.
In addition to its hitting and blocking prowess, the
Cardinal showed dramatic improvement in limiting its
errors. Alter being plagued by mistakes that cost them
games throughout t he beginning of the season, Stan
ford spikers made only nine hitting errors in 95

California 6 6 4

Like any good Stanford squad, the women's volley
ball team understands the importance of beating the
Weenies. After winning nine straight games, the last
six against ranked opponents, the Cardinal (13-2 over
all, 9-0 Pacific 10 Conference) avoided a letdown, fail
ing to give unranked California a chance to pull out a
win. Stanford maintained its hold on first place in the
Pac-10 with a 15-6, 15-6, 15-4 thrashing of the Golden
Bears.
Unlike in other matches of late, where the Cardinal
has excelled in certain aspects of the game but rarely
put it all together in one performance, last night, Stan
ford dictated the Bears throughout, repeatedly capi
talizing on the slightest opportunity to score. The deci
sive third game witnessed Stanford's most complete
domination, as Cal managed only four points despite
having a 15-minute break between games two and
three to try to figure out a way to slow down the Car
dinal machine.
By the time it was all over, nearly everyone on the
Stanford roster had gotten into the act. Coach Don
Shaw attempted to show some mercy on the defense
less Weenies, using 11 players during the course of the
match. Try as he might, however, Stanford's deep
bench outclassed the Bears' starting six, and the rout
ended only an hour and 15 minutes after it began.
Games one and two were nearly mirror images of
each other, as the Bears totaled six points in each
game. Though an occasional mistake cost Stanford
occasional points, the outcome of each game was never
in douht.
The one redeeming aspect of Berkeley's effort was
its defense. Although even their digs were nothing
close to spectacular, the Bears did manage to thwart
Stanford from completely shutting them out by com
ing up with 40 digs. Sophomore Jessica Dinaberg led
the Weenies with 10 digs, while junior Brooke Weaver

posted eight.
