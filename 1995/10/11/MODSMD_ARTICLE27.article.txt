# Men's basketball tickets worth every single penny
## 
### 
With the introduction of ticket sales
on campus this year for basketball
and volleyball, I have heard enough
whining and bickering around here to lill a
children's nursery. Buckle up people.
Nobody likes a whiner. These are big-time
collegiate programs, and now that the Ath
letics Department has made men's basket
ball and other widely popular sports a prior
ity, it's time Cor students to step down from
their spoiled pedestal and show some real
support for the Cardinal.

Sure, it was easy enough to head out to
Maples Pavilion to catch Thursday night's
men's basketball game versus Arizona
State. I mean, it was pretty much the big
social event for the evening anyway, right?
And besides, it was free. Can't really go
wrong with that, right? At least go see who
else shows up at the game, socialize and find
out what's going on after the game.
Not anymore.
No longer will one find two oblivious "fans"
in front of them, facing each other rather than
the court, trading information about the most
recent sale at Nordstrom or discussing their
latest Econ 51 lecture. Judging from the
amount of complaining, these people will sit at
home, forced to find something else to enter
tain their supposedly intellectual minds.
To be quite honest, I don't mind not see
ing those few at the game. It's time for the
true faithful to bear the cardinal and white.

Maples Pavilion may actually pose some
what of a home-court advantage with a full
student section completely on its feet and
demonstrating a vested interest in the game.
Of course, I have been subject to the argu
ment that at the price of our education, we
should not have to add money to see our
peers compete. The statement, in an ideal
world, works extremely well, but we know
all too well that this world is far from ideal.
First of all, no one would have complained if
upon first coming to the Farm, tickets need
ed to be purchased instead of given. It has
become an expectation on the part of Stan
ford students — one that holds water at very
few schools around the country, especially
among those of our athletic caliber. Besides,
it's 20 bucks folks. Cut back on a few of
those California Bowls at the Collo if you
have to. Those who possess the madness
known as college basketball fever will surely
make the sacrifice.
Secondly, the fact remains that NCAA
athletics is a business, and we students are
its market. I feel fortunate that I watched
competitive college basketball without pay
ing last year, but I realized it was merely a
matter of time before the wallet would come
out of the pocket. Stanford's men's basket
ball program continues to improve year by
year, and the only way to maintain a level of
competition with perennial powerhouses
such as Arizona and UCLA is to have the
money to do so — money for scholarships,
coaching staffs, facilities, equipment, medi
cal training, off-season training, etc.
We are still fortunate with regard to
men's basketball tickets, a fact which many
of our stellar students have failed to grasp.
Take a look around at the best collegiate
basketball programs in the nation. At Ari
zona, die-hard Wildcat hoops fans perch
themselves in front of their television sets

every Thursday and Saturday
night because they did not "win"
the privilege of attending home
basketball games in a random lot
tery. The Cameron Crazys, fol
lowers of the Duke Blue Devils,
sleep out numerous days in
advance to get tickets for home
games. Outside of a select few,

most go home not only tired, but
empty-handed.
For Stanford to continue to
compete with such programs year
in and year out, it remains just a
matter of time before it becomes
this difficult to go watch Mike
Montgomery's squad in action.
So for now, enough of the
tears. There's no crying in base
ball, or in basketball, football or
volleyball for that matter. So no
more socializing this winter. This
time, it's all business baby.
