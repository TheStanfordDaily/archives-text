# Stars shine for men's golf
## Woods and Kribel lead Cardinal charge 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team opened the
first event of the 1995-96 season with a
strong first round at the Northwestern Uni
versity / Windon Memorial Classic on Mon
day in Long Grove, 111. The Cardinal trails
only Florida in the 14-team field and finds
itself with a 10-stroke lead over local rival
California.
Stanford's effort was anchored by the
play of sophomore All-American Tiger
Woods and freshman Joel Kribel. Woods fin
ished the round tied for second with Florida
freshman Steve Scott at 147. After posting
an even par for his first 18, Woods cooled
down, firing a three-over-par 75 for the sec
ond half of the round while Scott performed
steadily both rounds.
The two are not altogether unfamiliar
adversaries. Woods and Scott last saw action
against each other during the U.S. Amateur
Championships, in which Woods successful
ly defended his title while Scott made a
strong run to the semifinals.

Scott finds company in Kribel as preco
cious freshmen among the early leaders.
Kribel, the top player in the nation as a
junior last year, has shown early indications
of living up to his lofty billing, overcoming a
rough first half of the round to come back
and finish even for his second 18.
Stanford junior Conrad Ray finds himself
in a tie for 19th, four strokes behind Kribel.
Senior team captain Jerry Chang lies anoth
er four strokes back, tied for 33rd. Senior
Pete Ligotti rounds out the Cardinal attack
tied fors6th ;it 166.
While the meet is only the first for the
Cardinal, the team's play will be an impor
tant indicator for competition later in the
season. With the exception of Woods, coach
Wally Goodwin is starting a completely dif
ferent lineup this year after losing four All-
Americans to graduation.
In addition, the tournament provides
Stanford with a good opportunity to look at
some of the best teams in the nation. Should
the Cardinal make a run for the title, it will
likely have to go through the Gators, who
are an earlv favorite to win it all.
