# Team focus this year for Football
## No-name Stanford gridiron squad makes big-time plays 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Any moment, a great moment.
The New York Yankees adopted
that phrase as their season motto a few
years hack. They were a young team,
but a promising one, just breaking free
of the chain of dismal records they had
put together in the '80s. Few people
recognized the names on the Yankee
roster, and fans never knew when or
where the next big hit or defensive
play was going to come from.
Hence, any moment, a great
moment.
The same phrase might apply to the
No. 16 Stanford football team in 1995.
The squad has shown tremendous
potent ial in its first five games and
though it may still be early — is in the
bunt for the Pacific 10 Conference
title. It has accomplished this without
a superstar. While I SC has Keyshawn
Johnson and UCLA has Karim Abdul-
Jabbar, Stanford has, well, no one.
"We're a team," said sophomore
running back Anthony Bookman.
"The concept of a team isn't about a

megastar.
In truth, it is unfair to say the Car
dinal has no one. Stanford may lack an
athlete whom the media, the coaching
staff and the players expect to take the
squad to the promised land, but what
it does have — a number of players
who rise to the occasion — has been
enough to log a 4-0-1 record.
"The way we've distributed things
gives a lot of people a chance to con
tribute," said head coach Tyrone YVill
ingham. "Collectively, we've played
from well to good, and, individually,
players have made big plays that allow
us to win."
The absence of a true attention-get
ter has allowed the Cardinal to gel as a
total unit. "It just focuses more atten
tion on the team," said senior left
tackle Jeff Buckey. "That's a big
theme this year. We'll win because
we're a team."
The whole squad can bask in its
newfound glory. No one man or one
group of players has been responsible
for Stanford's success.
This wasn't always the case in the
past. Stars such as Glyn Milburn,

Justin Armour and prolific passers
Steve Stenstrom and John IClway
attracted a great deal of attention
from the media and often received
most of the credit for Cardinal victo
ries.
"I'm not saying that's bad," Book
man said. "Those guys were hard
workers and didn't let it go to their
heads. Hut this year, [having no starl
lets everyone on the team know that
they have a big role. For morale, that's
a good thing."
Buckey agrees that with no one
person carrying all the weight on his
shoulders, each athlete will attempt to
shoulder more of the load.
"Obviously, we'll have individuals
step up," be said. "This year, we don't
have a big star like Steve or Justin. I
think that's better in a way."
With every player ready and fight
ing for a chance to make headlines,
opposing teams will have a difficult
time. They can't concentrate on one
Cardinal warrior and hope to stop the
team.
