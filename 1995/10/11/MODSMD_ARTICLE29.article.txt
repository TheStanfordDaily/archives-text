# Team focus this year for Football
## No-name Stanford gridiron squad makes big-time plays 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Any moment, a great moment.
The New York Yankees adopted
that phrase as their season motto a few
years hack. They were a young team,
but a promising one, just breaking free
of the chain of dismal records they had
put together in the '80s. Few people
recognized the names on the Yankee
roster, and fans never knew when or
where the next big hit or defensive
play was going to come from.
Hence, any moment, a great
moment.
The same phrase might apply to the
No. 16 Stanford football team in 1995.
The squad has shown tremendous
potent ial in its first five games and
though it may still be early — is in the
bunt for the Pacific 10 Conference
title. It has accomplished this without
a superstar. While I SC has Keyshawn
Johnson and UCLA has Karim Abdul-
Jabbar, Stanford has, well, no one.
"We're a team," said sophomore
running back Anthony Bookman.
"The concept of a team isn't about a

megastar.
In truth, it is unfair to say the Car
dinal has no one. Stanford may lack an
athlete whom the media, the coaching
staff and the players expect to take the
squad to the promised land, but what
it does have — a number of players
who rise to the occasion — has been
enough to log a 4-0-1 record.
"The way we've distributed things
gives a lot of people a chance to con
tribute," said head coach Tyrone YVill
ingham. "Collectively, we've played
from well to good, and, individually,
players have made big plays that allow
us to win."
The absence of a true attention-get
ter has allowed the Cardinal to gel as a
total unit. "It just focuses more atten
tion on the team," said senior left
tackle Jeff Buckey. "That's a big
theme this year. We'll win because
we're a team."
The whole squad can bask in its
newfound glory. No one man or one
group of players has been responsible
for Stanford's success.
This wasn't always the case in the
past. Stars such as Glyn Milburn,

Justin Armour and prolific passers
Steve Stenstrom and John IClway
attracted a great deal of attention
from the media and often received
most of the credit for Cardinal victo
ries.
"I'm not saying that's bad," Book
man said. "Those guys were hard
workers and didn't let it go to their
heads. Hut this year, [having no starl
lets everyone on the team know that
they have a big role. For morale, that's
a good thing."
Buckey agrees that with no one
person carrying all the weight on his
shoulders, each athlete will attempt to
shoulder more of the load.
"Obviously, we'll have individuals
step up," be said. "This year, we don't
have a big star like Steve or Justin. I
think that's better in a way."
With every player ready and fight
ing for a chance to make headlines,
opposing teams will have a difficult
time. They can't concentrate on one
Cardinal warrior and hope to stop the
team.
"It makes it easier for a (Stan
ford) coach," said senior receiver
Mark Harris. "Several different
players can step up and make
plays. That's definitely an advan
tage for us."
Such balance has been more
than evident in Stanford's season
thus far.
At San Jose State, junior run
ning back Mike Mitchell went
down in the first half with an
elbow injury. Bookman stepped up
to rush for 133 yards, and sopho
more Damon Dunn returned a
kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown.
At Utah, sophomore Alistair
White batted away a pass and
intercepted another during a
game-ending, goal-line stand for
the Stanford defense.
Against Wisconsin, with the
running game effectively shut
down, senior quarterback Mark
Butterfield threw for 335 yards
and three touchdowns, while
Harris caught 10 balls for 142
yards.
At Oregon, the pass rush
forced Duck quarterback Tony
Graziani to throw three intercep
tions. After a game-tying drive by
Oregon, senior Marlon Evans
returned the kickoff 96 yards to
sap the Ducks' momentum. On
the other side of the ball, the
undermanned and exhausted
defense stopped Oregon's last
Hri vp

Finally at Arizona State, junior
Josh Madsen picked off pass to
set up a touchdown, senior
Kwame Ellis blocked a punt and
senior Eric Abrams, among the
league leaders in scoring, kicked
three field goals. Sophomore
linebacker Chris Draft recorded
18 tackles, and the defense again
stopped the opponents' last drive.
With so many different players
putting their two cents into the
Cardinal's attempt at a million
dollar season, it's hard for any
one of the Cardinal to feel that if
he doesn't play well individually,
the team will fail.
"It really takes the pressure off
individual players," Buckey said.
While the squad may not cur
rently boast any superstars, that
doesn't mean that there aren't
any ready to brighten up the Car
dinal constellation in the near
future.
Draft, currently ranked second
in the conference in tackles, is
quickly becoming one of the
league's top linebackers. Sopho
more Carl Hansen, leading the
team in sacks, may develop into a
defensive phenom. The offensive
line, led by Buckey, Brad Badger
and T.J. Guvnor, has surrendered
a conference-low six sacks and,
statistically anyway, stands as
one of the best pass-protection
units in the nation.
"You're seeing some players
emerge," Willingham said. "We
have some people who are work
ing towards [stardom | "
In the mean time, anv
moment, a great moment.
