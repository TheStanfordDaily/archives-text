## Trustees approve $180 million for buildings, renovation 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
At its first meeting of the year, the
Board of Trustees yesterday approved
about $180 million in construction pro
jects, including the creation of the new
science and engineering quad, the build
ing of a new Graduate School of Business
residential center and the renovation of
Encina Hall East.
The board authorized about $120 mil
lion for the construction of four buildings
and the remodeling of two others in the
proposed science and engineering quad,
said trustee Rebecca Morgan, a member
of the Committee on Land and Buildings.
The quad is being designed by the New
York firm of Pei Cobb Freed and Part
ners. Construction is scheduled to begin
in May 1990 and be completed by Sep
tember 1997.

Of that amount,
about $30 million will be
allocated for a new elec
trical engineering build
ing, about $24 million
for a new materials re
search building, about
$8 million for a new sta
tistics building and
about $10 million for a
regional teaching facili-

ty to replace the Physics Tank, said Vice
Provost for Institutional Planning Geof
frey Cox.
In addition, two buildings — Varian
and McCullough — will be remodeled at a
cost of about $12 million and $4 million
respectively, Cox added.
The plan also calls for a new quad
with trees, arcades and pavilions. In
cluded in the total cost are expendi
tures for utilities, the creation of a new

service road, demolition and relocation
of departments during the construc
tion.
The cost of the project will be paid in
large part by last year's $77.4 million do
nation by Stanford alumni William
I lewlett and David Packard, Cox said. Ad
ditional costs will be paid by long-term
debt and University funds.
The cost of the project has incraised
nearly 10 percent from its original esti
mate, Morgan said.
"The original estimate had not in
cluded utility infrastructure work," Cox
said. "Going hack and doing the work
that normally takes place in architectur
al designs, we got a much better estimate
of what the needs will be."
Also authorized by the board was the
construction of a new Graduate School of


Cox
Business Residential Learning
Center, Morgan said. The Legorre
ta Arquitectos firm of Mexico City
and the Steinberg Group of San
.Jose will design the building,
scheduled to be completed in the
summer of 1997
The project, costing approxi
mately $28 million, will have 140
units housing a total of 280 gradu
ate students and Executive Educa
tion Program participants The

cost will Im* borne by donations and
long-term debt, Cox said.
The board also granted concept
approval to the remodeling of Enci
na Hall East, Cox said. The build
ing was damaged by a 1972 fire and
the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.
After $11 million to $13 million
in renovations, the building will
house the Institute for Internation
al Studies, which is currently locat
ed at different sites across campus.
The project is expected to be fin
ished in December 1997.
Seismic strengthening projects
were approved for Buildings 90,
100 and 110. Funds from the

Earthquake Facilities Reserve, the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the School of I lumani
ties and Sciences, in addition to
deferred maintenance funds, will
pay the project's $1 1 million cost.
The project will be finished by fall
quarter 1996.
Stanford Stadium will also !>«■
remodeled, Morgan said. The cost
of more than million will be paid
for by gifts to the Athletic Depart
ment. The renovation is exj>ected to
be completed by September 1996.
The board also authorized

hospital entryway.
