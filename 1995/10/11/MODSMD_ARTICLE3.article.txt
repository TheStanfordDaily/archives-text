### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
At its first meeting of the year, the
Board of Trustees yesterday approved
about $180 million in construction pro
jects, including the creation of the new
science and engineering quad, the build
ing of a new Graduate School of Business
residential center and the renovation of
Encina Hall East.
The board authorized about $120 mil
lion for the construction of four buildings
and the remodeling of two others in the
proposed science and engineering quad,
said trustee Rebecca Morgan, a member
of the Committee on Land and Buildings.
The quad is being designed by the New
York firm of Pei Cobb Freed and Part
ners. Construction is scheduled to begin
in May 1990 and be completed by Sep
tember 1997.

Of that amount,
about $30 million will be
allocated for a new elec
trical engineering build
ing, about $24 million
for a new materials re
search building, about
$8 million for a new sta
tistics building and
about $10 million for a
regional teaching facili-

ty to replace the Physics Tank, said Vice
Provost for Institutional Planning Geof
frey Cox.
In addition, two buildings — Varian
and McCullough — will be remodeled at a
cost of about $12 million and $4 million
respectively, Cox added.
The plan also calls for a new quad
with trees, arcades and pavilions. In
cluded in the total cost are expendi
tures for utilities, the creation of a new

service road, demolition and relocation
of departments during the construc
tion.
The cost of the project will be paid in
large part by last year's $77.4 million do
nation by Stanford alumni William
I lewlett and David Packard, Cox said. Ad
ditional costs will be paid by long-term
debt and University funds.
The cost of the project has incraised
nearly 10 percent from its original esti
mate, Morgan said.
"The original estimate had not in
cluded utility infrastructure work," Cox
said. "Going hack and doing the work
that normally takes place in architectur
al designs, we got a much better estimate
of what the needs will be."
Also authorized by the board was the
construction of a new Graduate School of
