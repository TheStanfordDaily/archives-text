# Wais discusses alcohol policy
## New dean also talks to ASSU about relations with Greeks 
### Carolyn Sleeth Contributing writer 
Confronting two hot issues concern
ing students lately, Dean of Students
Marc Wais addressed both Stanford
Greek life and the alcohol policy at last
night's ASSU Senate meeting.
When asked about his personal view
of Greek life, Wais said he felt the Greek
system offers a positive lifestyle and a
way for students to be involved in the
University. He emphasized, however,
that he acts decisively in relation to
Greek life, as demonstrated by the evic
tion of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
two weeks ago.
"We need to hold all students ac
countable, in the classroom and out,"

Wais said. He said he has met with
Greek leaders concerning the housing
situation and added that Vice Provost
and Dean for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds is creating a task force "to look at
the issues of Greek life, specifically
housing."
Wais also spoke about Stanford's al
cohol policy, but said he did not want to
address whether resident assistants
should act to police drinking because
that issue does not fall directly under his
authority.
"In terms of underage drinking, it is
against the law, and it is expected that
you shouldn't break the law on cam
pus," Wais said.
Undergraduate senator Oliver Miao,
a junior, asked Wais how students could

get involved in developing a "popular"
alcohol policy and help enforce it. After
questioning Miao on what he meant by
"popular," Wais said a task force con
cerning the alcohol policy will be created
under Edmonds.
"Stanford wants to educate students
about alcohol so that they can make in
formed decisions," Wais said. "I can't
say whether [the task force! will change
the policy or work with the present one."
Students will work with administra
tors on these task forces, and Wais said
he plans to work closely with the com
mittees. The ASSU Nominations Com
mittee will assign students to the com
mittees.
