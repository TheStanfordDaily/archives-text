# ZAP kitchen manager forced to leave
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
In executing a disciplinary move, Residential
Education has once again indicated that it is tak
ing Stanford's alcohol policy seriously this year.
Because he bought alcohol for recently arrest
ed ZAP House Manager Michael Eubanks, ZAP
Kitchen Manager Brian Lui was asked to leave
housing by Residence Dean Patricia Polhemus.
Lui, a senior, subsequently resigned as

kitchen manager and has been replaced by senior
Adam Clark.
Eubanks, a junior who is not yet 21 years old,
was arrested Sept. 22 for indecent exposure
when he allegedly entered the room of two female
ZAP residents naked at 4 a.m. Eubanks admitted
to drinking that night, and neither he nor the two
women still reside at ZAP. Junior David Dyer has
replaced Eubanks as house manager.
In addition, the others present while the alco
hol was IxMng consumed — Financial Manager

Chris Pippin, Resident Assistant Bobby Yeh and
Social Manager Anne Hsu — have been issued
warnings regarding the alcohol policy, Pippin said.
Lui said he felt regret about leaving ZAP.
"I am sad because ZAP has become my home,"
he said. "I was looking forward to living here and
fostering the same kind of community we had
here last year."
Res Ed denied that this action indicated a new
stance on the enforcement of the alcohol policy.
"I'm just enforcing the current
policy," Polhemus said. "I think
that my sense of enforcement has
been consistent. My enforcement
and those of residential teams have
been consistent. I think that if peo
ple breach University policy and
the law, we would address that
especially when it has profound
negative effects on the communi
ty."
Polhemus declined to comment
on the specifics of Lui's case.
ZAP residents had mixed opin
ions about whether their behavior
concerning the use of alcohol would
change after the recent incidents.

"I think for a while everyone
will he treading softly," Clark said.
"Most people are more angry than
intimidated by what tin* University
and lies Kd are doing. ... I don't
see any real active enforcement of
age happening."
Clark said he thought that in
the future, alcohol distribution at
ZAP would happen as it now does
at most campus parties, where
proof of identification is asked for
at the door, but inside free distri
bution of alcohol usually occurs
ZAP resident Chris Macomber,
a junior, said he thought that the
incidents may prompt students to
be more wary of purchasing alcohol
for minors.
"1 just turned '21 last week and
that day, I bought alcohol for
minors," Macomber said. "I was

caught by surprise that he was
kicked out. We are being more cau
tious. We had things planned that
have been put on the back burner."
The loss of both Eubanks and
Lui will be felt strongly in ZAP, res
idents said.
"I know Res Ed is trying to
crack down on alcohol policy, but
people were all left in the cold,"
Pippin said. "We had to pay people
to do jobs. Residents wore left with
out a house manager and without
guidance on cleaning for a week.
Also, the cook had a good working
relationship with the former
kitchen manager and had to adjust
to the new kitchen manager
overnight."
"ZAP lost two of its most dedi
cated and well-liked managers,"
Dyer said.
