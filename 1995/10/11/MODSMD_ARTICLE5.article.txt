In executing a disciplinary move, Residential
Education has once again indicated that it is tak
ing Stanford's alcohol policy seriously this year.
Because he bought alcohol for recently arrest
ed ZAP House Manager Michael Eubanks, ZAP
Kitchen Manager Brian Lui was asked to leave
housing by Residence Dean Patricia Polhemus.
Lui, a senior, subsequently resigned as

kitchen manager and has been replaced by senior
Adam Clark.
Eubanks, a junior who is not yet 21 years old,
was arrested Sept. 22 for indecent exposure
when he allegedly entered the room of two female
ZAP residents naked at 4 a.m. Eubanks admitted
to drinking that night, and neither he nor the two
women still reside at ZAP. Junior David Dyer has
replaced Eubanks as house manager.
In addition, the others present while the alco
hol was IxMng consumed — Financial Manager

Chris Pippin, Resident Assistant Bobby Yeh and
Social Manager Anne Hsu — have been issued
warnings regarding the alcohol policy, Pippin said.
Lui said he felt regret about leaving ZAP.
"I am sad because ZAP has become my home,"
he said. "I was looking forward to living here and
fostering the same kind of community we had
here last year."
Res Ed denied that this action indicated a new
stance on the enforcement of the alcohol policy.
