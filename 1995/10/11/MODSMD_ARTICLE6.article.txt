# Zapata mural spurs dialogue on race issues
## 
### Tracy Jan Contributing writer 
When Tony and Cecilia Burci
aga first became resident fellows
in 1985 at Casa Zapata, the Chi
cano theme dorm, they were
warned that a mural done by the
famous Mexican artist Zarco
Guerrero would cause them an
incredible number of problems.
The most popular as well as
the most controversial mural is
the one which depicts three fe
male faces. On the left side of the
mural is a young, attractive Chi
cana and on the right is an older
Chicana. The controversy, how
ever, lies in the middle. A faceless
blond woman has sparked many
heated discussions in the Stern
dining hall.
Tony Burciaga, one of the RFs
in Zapata until 1994, spent nine
years educating people by giving
tours of the murals at the begin
ning of each year. When he left
Stanford, the tours were no
longer given.
When asked to return to Stan
ford this year to give another
tour, Burciaga declined. "Stan
ford has to learn how to handle
the controversies without me, be
cause they will continue," he
said.
Burciaga said the tours were
needed in order to dispel the
wrong types of racism that people
may perceive when viewing the
murals without reading the ex
planations placed next to them.
In actuality, this mural is a
protest against the subtle vio
lence in the racism of Mexican

television.
"There is a phenomenon of
how Mexican TV negates our in
digenous roots and instead,
puts on a false wig, giving us a
Eurocentric perspective," Cecil
ia Burciaga said. "The stars on
the telenovellas are not portray
ing the entire realitv of Mexican

diversity."
According to the explanation
written by Tony Burciaga, nine
out of 10 Mexican television per
sonalities are blond and have
light complexions, even though
Mexico is a Mestizo nation.
Guerrero received a commis
sion as artist in residence at the

newly formed theme dorm in
1972. Upon his arrival on the
Farm, Guerrero said he observed
the racism in this institution and
was inspired to make a statement
about racism in both this country
and in Mexico.

Casa Zapata's mural of a faceless blonde, located in Stern dining hall, continues to spark heated dis
cussion.
"When Chicano students first
arrive at Stanford, they experi
ence a drastic separation from
their communities," Guerrero
said. "A lot of them readily accept
the assimilation process and let
go of traditional values."
"I painted that particular
mural as a response to the fact
that Hispanics, Native Americans
and African Americans have been
for so long ignored by the media
or depicted in a stereotypical
way," Guerrero said. "The media
creates a kind of self-hatred
among people of color.

"Also, women of all races and
classes feel their lives disrupted
by the Sharon Stone type of
image," he said.
According to the artist, the
stark colors were used to express
rage against racism. The blood
like color dripping down the top
into the green of the Mexican flag,
and the blue of the U.S. flag sym
bolize the inherent violence in all
racism.
The faceless blonde at the cen
ter of the mural represents a
myth in Mexico, a figure conjured
up by Mexican television. Guer
rero said that he did not want the
middle image to be misconstrued
as ugliness when in fact it repre
sents an emptiness, a false
promise full of self-denial.

"I know some young Anglo
women have felt shunned and
criticized and really hurt by the
mural — hut it is not directed
towards them," Guerrero said.
The young woman on the left
and the old woman on the right
represent the reality of Mexico,
the Indian side of Mexicans and
Chicanos without pretense or
regrets, he said.
"However, the young woman,
with her big smile and beautiful
features is on the verge of perpet
uating the media's image," Guer
rero said.
About five years ago, a student
drew eyes and other facial fea
tures on separate sheets of paper
and taped them to the blank face,
said Burciaga. Beneath (he blond

face, the person had put up a sign
that read, "Not all white people
are oppressors."
Burciaga allowed the vandal
ism to remain and attached a
large sheet of paper beneath the
mural to encourage students to
express their opinions about the
protest.
"The murals are very valuable
both aesthetically and historically
and we can all learn from the con
troversies," Burciaga said. "We
can turn the murals into educa
tional tools."
"1 wanted to create controver
sy in order to generate a conver
sation and discussion about race,"
Guerrero said. "1 hope the contro
versy continues because it stimu
lates a constructive, positive

exchange of ideas among people."
One sixth-year senior, who
asked not to be named, said he got
the impression that the faceless
blond represents "whites without
culture."
"Although I am not personally
offended, it is obnoxious," he said.
"It's a tough call because it's
art, and you don't want to say
'No, that's wrong.' The mural is a
part of Zapata. Although it's not
my culture, it is other people's
culture. And a campus without
culture is pretty boring," he said.
Angie Parker, a sophomore
and Zapata resident, said she sees
both sides of the argument. "The
mural is jarring but the message
is interesting," she said. "The
Chicana in her vouth seems natu

ral and innocent. As she gets
older she tries to conform to
white beauty standards. She is no
longer an individual but is turn
ing into a type. By the time she is
an old woman, she has gained
back her character again.
"For Zapata, part of being a
theme dorm is addressing issues
for that culture. The mural is as
valid a viewpoint as any other
work of art. If it makes you think,
which it does, I think it has served
its purpose," Parker said.
The mural's artist has
expressed interest in changing the
mural to adapt to more current
issues. "I'd be more than happy to
bring the mural up-to-date,"
Guerrero said. "I'd love to go back
and re-address other issues."
