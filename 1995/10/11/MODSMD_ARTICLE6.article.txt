# Zapata mural spurs dialogue on race issues
## 
### Tracy Jan Contributing writer 
When Tony and Cecilia Burci
aga first became resident fellows
in 1985 at Casa Zapata, the Chi
cano theme dorm, they were
warned that a mural done by the
famous Mexican artist Zarco
Guerrero would cause them an
incredible number of problems.
The most popular as well as
the most controversial mural is
the one which depicts three fe
male faces. On the left side of the
mural is a young, attractive Chi
cana and on the right is an older
Chicana. The controversy, how
ever, lies in the middle. A faceless
blond woman has sparked many
heated discussions in the Stern
dining hall.
Tony Burciaga, one of the RFs
in Zapata until 1994, spent nine
years educating people by giving
tours of the murals at the begin
ning of each year. When he left
Stanford, the tours were no
longer given.
When asked to return to Stan
ford this year to give another
tour, Burciaga declined. "Stan
ford has to learn how to handle
the controversies without me, be
cause they will continue," he
said.
Burciaga said the tours were
needed in order to dispel the
wrong types of racism that people
may perceive when viewing the
murals without reading the ex
planations placed next to them.
In actuality, this mural is a
protest against the subtle vio
lence in the racism of Mexican

television.
"There is a phenomenon of
how Mexican TV negates our in
digenous roots and instead,
puts on a false wig, giving us a
Eurocentric perspective," Cecil
ia Burciaga said. "The stars on
the telenovellas are not portray
ing the entire realitv of Mexican

diversity."
According to the explanation
written by Tony Burciaga, nine
out of 10 Mexican television per
sonalities are blond and have
light complexions, even though
Mexico is a Mestizo nation.
Guerrero received a commis
sion as artist in residence at the

newly formed theme dorm in
1972. Upon his arrival on the
Farm, Guerrero said he observed
the racism in this institution and
was inspired to make a statement
about racism in both this country
and in Mexico.
