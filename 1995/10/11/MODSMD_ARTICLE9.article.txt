# Researcher decries 'heterosexism'
## 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
At 23, Zoy Kazan was trying to Ik* straight. She
was married and had a son. Yesterday, on the eve of
National Coming Out Day, Kazan spoke to an inti
mate group of supporters about a system of hetero
sexual dominance that forced her into a marriage
with a man she did not love.
"Trying to define heterosexual dominance is like
trying to define the air," Kazan said and let her eyes
scan the faces of those who had come to hear her lec
ture titled, "Pressures on Nonheterosexual Kami
lies."
"It is difficult because it is all around us," she
said. "We take it in and breathe it out and we are all
trained in the ways of such dominance."
Kazan, a family therapist from Australia, is cur
rently conducting research on gender and sexuality.
She came to do her work at Stanford because she felt
that people in Australia would be too timid to speak
candidly about sexuality.
"This is really different than most places in the
world," Kazan said.
"San Francisco is an oasis," she said, explaining
that in London, it is not safe to travel on tlie subway
if you look like you are gay, lesbian or bisexual.
The exclusion, objectification and scapegoat ing of
gays, lesbians and bisexuals, Kazan said, is an issue
even in her oasis.
"I believe that the level of heterosexism here is
just the same as anywhere else," she said.

According to Kazan, 10 percent of the population
is gay, lesbian or bisexual. Yet manifestations of het
erosexism can be found in the court system, the
health system and even in the Internal Revenue Ser
vice.
"Homosexuality is actually forbidden on
entrance into the U.5.A.," Kazan said.
"If anyone had asked me, they would have had
grounds to have stop|>ed my trip," she added, paus
ing amid the rustles of a fidgeting audience. "There
are people who still believe that homosexuality is a
crime against nature."
Kazan went on to explain that homosexuality
was actually defined as a mental disorder by the
psychiatric community until 1970. She also said the
suicide rate was two to three times greater among
homosexual adolescents than among heterosexual
adolescents. Kazan said the stigmatization of
homosexuality was largely responsible for these
statistics.
"Heterosexual people must offer to challenge the
hierarchy in conjunction with the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community," Kazan said, pointing out that
heterosexual couples could very well have homosex
ual children. "Everyone must challenge heterosexist
comments when they hear them."
I'lh' lecture at Tresidder was part of a noon-time
weekly series sponsored by the Stanford I lelp ('enter.
