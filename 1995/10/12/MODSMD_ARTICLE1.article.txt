# Policy shift
## Gifts to help cover costs 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Beginning in 1996, a portion of all directed private do
nations will be diverted to the University's general fund
to reimburse overhead costs, a move that will save an es
timated $3.5 million. Provost Condoleezza Rice will an
nounce the new policy at today's Faculty Senate meeting.
Until now, the University has tappet! its general fund

to cover all infrastructure costs associ
ated with projects financed by restrict
ed funds, which are private donations
earmarked for a specific use. Restricted
funds comprise 25 percent of the Uni
versity's consolidated budget.
However, beginning Jan. 1, 6 per
cent of virtually all new and previous
earmarked donations will be trans
ferred to the University's general fund
to pay for maintenance and custodial

services. The Board of Trustees approved the policy in its
June meeting.
"I think it's very important and it was the right deci
sion by the Board of Trustees," Rice said.
Director of University Budgets Tim Warner said the
shift "will definitely have an impact on the budget. The
question at this point is how much.''
The only exceptions to the new policy will be dona
tions restricted to undergraduate and graduate financial
aid, undergraduate research and tenured faculty
salaries. Athletic budgets, which fall under financial aid,
will not be affected, Warner said.
The restricted funds transfer will have the greatest
impact at the Medical School, where much of the budget
depends on private donations and grants.
While previous donors can negotiate with the ()fficeof
Development on the extent to which their gifts will sup
port the infrastructure costs, donations after Jan. 1 will
not be accepted unless the donor agrees to the new poli
cy, said Vice President of Development John Ford.
"The size of the gift should not influence whether we
accept or don't accept," Ford said.
The Office of Development is currently informing
prospective donors of the policy change. Most alumni
agree with the change, Ford said.
"I would suspect that it's not going to influence in any
significant way the dollars flowing to Stanford," he said.
The Faculty Senate is likely to support the measure,
siiid Geology Prof Gail Mahood, the senate chair. Th<
senate, however, will not vote on the policy change.
