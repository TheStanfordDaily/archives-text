## In the affirmative 
### 
Casper's statment on
minority preferences
appropriate for times.

After releasing his
speech one week in advance,
University President Ger
hard Casper will formally
announce his support today for
the current University policy on
affirmative action.
We officially support Casper's
decision.
Casper's speech comes at a time
when many U.S. affirmative action
policies are in danger, with a num
ber of Republican candidates
claiming that such policies dis
criminate against Caucasians.
However, Casper's speech limits
itself to Stanford's affirmative
action policy. Likewise, we are only
making a statement in regard to
affirmative action at Stanford. We
believe that Casper's stance on
affirmative action is appropriate
and can only benefit the University.
The University should continue
to make conscious efforts to
increase the presence of underrep
resented minorities at Stanford.
For example, such measures as
sending out information to
minorities and actively recruiting
well-qualified minorities are well
within Stanford's affirmative
action policy and should be contin
ued.
Stanford should, however, be
careful to understand that the
principle of affirmative action here
is to provide opportunities to stu
dents who come from disadvan
taged backgrounds.
We encourage the Office of
Admissions to target students not
only for their ethnic backgrounds,
but also for socio-economic ones as
well. Because there are Caucasian
students who come from poor fam
ilies and do not have the opportu
nities that some more economical
ly advantaged minorities may
have, the University should keep
all factors in mind when it makes

its decisions.
This may mean that affirmative
action will not necessarily be
decided on a racial basis only. For
example, although Asian Ameri
cans are traditionally over-repre
sented at many universities, there
are Asian students who come from
unfortunate backgrounds. The
Office of Admissions should take
such circumstances into consider
ation.
All in all, the University should
remember to consider everything
about a student, and then careful
ly weigh how the student's circum
stances may have affected his ot
her life.
We also caution that Stanford
should always seek the most qual
ified student. Even though socio
economic and ethnic backgrounds
are important, candidates for
admission must meet Stanford's
academic qualifications.
Critics of the University policy
should keep in mind that affirma
tive action not only helps those
admitted, but the community at
large as well. A diverse community
on campus provides everyone with
the opportunity to learn from dif
ferent cultures and adversity of
people.
Exposing students to diversity
should therefore remain a priority
for the University. As Casper
points out in his speech, the Unit
ed States and the world will be
multiethnic, and a diverse campus
will effectively prepare students
for life after college.
Critics of the current policy
have raised concerns about the
possibility of losing funding from
either the state or the federal gov
ernment if the University contin
ues with its affirmative action pol
icy. Although the University
should keep such worries in mind,
financial matters should not influ
ence the University's stance on
affirmative action.
Supporting affirmative action
at Stanford is simply the right
thing to do. The University should
not back away from its current
policy.
