Serious romance is not an achieveable goal

Bemoaning the shortage of
romance at Stanford is a well
established tradition. But
shouldn't we be trying to understand the
source of the problem, so that we might
overcome it, instead of just lamenting it,
week in and week out?
Allow me to kick off the public con
versation with the following stab at an
explanation. Treat it as merely a specu
lative hypothesis. If you think you might
have a more insightful story to tell,
please share it.
The basic problem is that not enough
people at Stanford actually want
romance, whatever they may say about
the matter. Many men here seek sex, not
love (or some other strong, serious emo
tional bond). Many seek sex and love.
Most women here also seek sex and not
love. This claim may seem odd, given the
stereotype of greater female sensitivity
and inclination toward emotional
involvement. But that stereotype is
based upon society as a whole and

arguably does not accurately represent
young women at leading universities.
Such women, in contrast to their
counterparts from 20 or maybe even 10
years ago, are true legacies of feminism
and are not as self-concernedly ambi
tious as the men. But unlike men,
women have adopted an explicit, princi
pled ethic. It expresses an insistence on
not compromising one's desires or self
development, whether in the career or
personal realm, for the sake of men or in
response to pressures from them or from
the institutions they have controlled.
Now, add in the long-standing ten
dency for women to have more sophisti
cated and broader perspectives than men
on the relationships in their lives — and
thus to be more apt to conceive of their
heterosexual relationships in terms of
learning and self-growth — and the
result is that women at a place like
Stanford treat relationships with men as
sources of pleasure or personal enrich
ment to be gained "on the side" while

pursuing their own individual develop
ment. Whether they are aware of it or
not (and many of them in fact seem to
be), they actually do not take relation
ships or the men in them seriously.
Stanford men are not irrelevant or
blameless in this story. Were they to
pursue depth of emotional connection in
their relationships — as did the young
women of an earlier time — they might
well manage to draw the opposite sex
into serious romance, as did those
women. But these men, sadly, are doing
nothing of the sort. If anything, men
may be even less likely than before to
adopt serious romance as their goal.
Before, when faced with women
searching for love, men's sexual long
ings were largely unsatisfied and conse
quently often mutated (in the mysteri
ous way that these things happen) into
romantic ones. Today, those sexual
longings are more readily satisfied by
women who themselves aim for little
beyond sex, and as a result, the magical

transmutation never takes place. Men
and women, both pursuing narrow and
superficial social aims, jointly produce a
situation in which neither side lifts up
the other and educates it in matters of
the heart. On the contrary, both are left
with shallow wants, shallow relation
ships and to some extent, shallow
selves.
There is obviously some irony in this,
as people absorbed in self-development
and avidly exploring their possibilities —
including sexual ones — are in effect
denying themselves some of the human
experiences that are not only most valu
able in themselves, but also are among
those most essential to the enlargement
and education of their souls. I hope they
find that they can catch up on this pre
cious experience once they leave Stan
ford. But given how unappreciative they
now are about its precious value, I worry
that most never will.
