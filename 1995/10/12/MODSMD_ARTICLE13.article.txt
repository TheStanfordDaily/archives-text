# Simpson trial was a travesty of justice
## 
### 
In his appraisal of the O.J. Simpson
trial, Mikel Jollett joins an expanding
pool of alleged deep thinkers who wish
to imbue the trial with some allegorical
higher meaning. These people will
cheerfully tell you, "This trial was not
about 0.J., it was a trial about
filling the blank with "race relations,"
"the L.A.P.D.," "the media," "civil
rights history," "the judicial system,"
"the state of law-enforcement," "Ameri
ca," etc.
No, the trial was about O.J. Simpson
Though it may have helped illuminate
some unfortunate truths about Ameri
ca, the trial was not about those truths;

it was about O.J. Simpson â€” 0.J., the
guy who grew up in a San Francisco
slum; 0.J., the guy who played tailback
at I JSC; 0.J., the guy who tried to act in
bad movies and lame commercials; 0.J.,
the guy who beat the crap out of his
wife and finally killed her.
Yes, the trial was about O.J. Simp
son. It was not about Mark Fuhrman,
the L.A.P.D., Adolf Hitler, Rodney King
or those hordes of blacks who get mis
treated by the police on a daily basis
that we keep hearing about.
The apologists' defense of the verdict
is that we privileged white folk cannot
possibly comprehend the incessant bar
rage of social injustice which plagues
poor blacks. Thus, Jollett instructs us,
"Go to any urban black neighborhood
la.k.a. slum] in America and ask ques-

Read The Daily

tions about police treatment".
While on this magical ghetto tour,
perhaps we should stop off at the local
policc precincts and inquire as to how
the cops are treated by the community.
We could ask about the esteem to which
the locals hold the police. If we make it
to certain taxi-free areas of New York,
we can ask about the rocks, bottles and
Molotov cocktails (when the natives are
in a particularly festive mood) that are
periodically thrown at passing fire
trucks and police cars.
Now, we may ask, which came first,
the slums' hatred of the cops, or the
cops' hatred of the slums. The answer?
It does not matter. At least it does not
matter with regard to this trial. O.J.
Simpson butchered two people. That is
what matters.

It's bad enough that the verbal
pyrotechnics of a black lawyer in a
gaudy suit can convince 12 inner city
dullards (and make no mistake, that's
exactly what they are) that the trial was
not about O.J. Simpson but rather
decades of injustice and racism. But
let's not let the jurors convince the rest
of us. Let's forget about judging every
social issue which we can conceivably
connect to the trial. Let's judge O.J.
Simpson.
Jollett concludes his piece with this
disturbing bit of insight: "Mr. Simpson
was innocent. What about us?" So O.J.
is innocent and America is not.
I guess it must be one of those affir
mative action things.
