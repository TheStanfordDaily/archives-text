## 'Cause you ain't got 'poo 
### 
ALTHOUGH FRESHMAN Orienta
tion is over, I imagine that there are
still a few unanswered questions for
the new faces on campus. This is where I
come in. I am a columnist. This means that
I, besides being the constant lobbyist for
truth and freedom, get to be on the prover
bial Perotian bully-pulpit once a week toot
ing my horn. In a way, I am kind of like
Hillary, except a little taller, or Rush, but a
bit more slender. But I digress.
Perhaps it is best to start with situations
that we all must face daily. Far beyond the
ever annoying dilemma of what to do with
the cheezy stuff that builds up between
one's toes, way far beyond whether or not
to follow the old adage that you should not
put anything larger than your elbow in
your ear, way, way far beyond all these per
ils, there lurk other less obvious, but equal
ly perilous perils.
We'll get warmed up with some easy
stuff.
You're in a shower. You're wet. As a
matter of fact, you are much more than
wet. You're in a shower, so you are soaked.
But you must have expected that. That's
not the problem. The deal is, you ain't got
'poo. What do you do? Duh, no moral dilem
ma here — of course you grab the nearest
bottle of Pert. lather up, my wet friend,

lather up.
Onward to more trials you will face.
Your roomie's special hon comes all the
way from the East Coast for a 10-day stint
in your room. You soon learn you are not
invited for most of the stint. Barred from
your own room! Sure, it's cool when that
special somehon has kind of promised to set
you up with some cutie in the nebulous
Niagara Falls area. Sure, you like that. But,
you're a little sketched out on the prospect
of knock-knock-knock, "How long you guys
gonna be in there?"
Given the proverbial "sorry state of
affairs" you're in, do thoughts of a preemp
tive strike enter your little devilish Calvin
head? Of course they do. Damn it, man,
these are your college years. You're young.
You're an American. You're an adventurer.
Before the hometown hon comes, perhaps
the thought flirts with your dark naughty
side to plant a pair of sassy undergarments
under your roommate's bed in hopes that
the "room-grabbin' hometown hon" will
find them, and this will ensue in a horrific
break up with your roommate, which
leaves him heartbroken mid really very sad.
Do you do it? Oh yeah, of course you do it.
1 low much fun would that be?
O.K. final scenario.
You have house meeting. You will have

no pa»*t of it. Hut you are not particularly
opposed to the ice cream at the end of the
meeting. In fact, you harbor the thought of
skipping the meeting and slinking down at,
say, 10:40 p.m. to get your fill. You can't
wait to ride the high of Cherry Garcia (God
bless). And hey, your money paid for it. But
the ice cream is meant for those who attend
the meeting. Do you chow anyway? No
question about it, of course you do. Not
only do you get your cake by missing the
meeting, but you get the frosting, too!
Whoa, it looks like we're all a pretty
immoral bunch, aren't we? Look, as much
;us you would probably like to think that
you'd never take the immoral, cheap way
out of these situations, somehow, you
know you will So here we are, with all our
Mr. Smarty-pants, book-learnin' , high
school-GPA-totin' , humus-eatin', Juice-
Club-goin', foreign-film-watchin', Hegel
readin' arrogant selves. But when you
come down to it, if you stay with these
high-falutin' morals at Stanford, you ain't
got'poo.

cutie in the bio department and a strong
advocate of "the default four." Keep up the
good work, man.

affairs" you're in, do thoughts of a preemp
tive strike enter your little devilish Calvin
head? Of course they do. Damn it, man,
these are your college years. You're young.
You're an American. You're an adventurer.
Before the hometown hon comes, perhaps
the thought flirts with your dark naughty
side to plant a pair of sassy undergarments
under your roommate's bed in hopes that
the "room-grabbin' hometown hon" will
find them, and this will ensue in a horrific
break up with your roommate, which
leaves him heartbroken mid really very sad.
Do you do it? Oh yeah, of course you do it.
1 low much fun would that be?
O.K. final scenario.
You have house meeting. You will have

no pa»*t of it. Hut you are not particularly
opposed to the ice cream at the end of the
meeting. In fact, you harbor the thought of
skipping the meeting and slinking down at,
say, 10:40 p.m. to get your fill. You can't
wait to ride the high of Cherry Garcia (God
bless). And hey, your money paid for it. But
the ice cream is meant for those who attend
the meeting. Do you chow anyway? No
question about it, of course you do. Not
only do you get your cake by missing the
meeting, but you get the frosting, too!
Whoa, it looks like we're all a pretty
immoral bunch, aren't we? Look, as much
;us you would probably like to think that
you'd never take the immoral, cheap way
out of these situations, somehow, you
know you will So here we are, with all our
Mr. Smarty-pants, book-learnin' , high
school-GPA-totin' , humus-eatin', Juice-
Club-goin', foreign-film-watchin', Hegel
readin' arrogant selves. But when you
come down to it, if you stay with these
high-falutin' morals at Stanford, you ain't
got'poo.

"eland lilanz" is dreaming of Paul, a hot
cutie in the bio department and a strong
advocate of "the default four." Keep up the
good work, man.
