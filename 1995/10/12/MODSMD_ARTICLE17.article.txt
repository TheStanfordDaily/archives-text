# ASSU supports Casper
## Equity and accessibility a priority

THE COUNCIL OF Presi
dents of the Associated
Students of Stanford
University believes strongly in
the importance of equal access
to higher education.
As a community of learning,
Stanford benefits from the
diversity of backgrounds,
ideas, opinions and learning
styles that affirmative action
policies bring to our campus.
Today, there is a movement
to eliminate programs that
ensure that higher education,
among other quality of life
issues, be accessible to all stu
dents regardless of their race
or sex. Historically, Stanford
students have played an active
role in expanding access to
higher education. Because
income disparities, glass ceil
ings and racial insensitivity
persist, channels for equal
access must be maintained for
equity to be achieved. Only

interaction between individu
als of different ethnicities, on
an equal footing, can overcome
prejudice and promote general
understanding.
We applaud the stance
taken by University President
Gerhard Casper and his com-

raitment to
continuing
affirmative
action policies
at Stanford.
We all benefit
from equal
access to high
er education
and the com
munity it
engenders. It
is misleading

action is about a face-off
between a white and a minori
ty candidate. From a pool of
