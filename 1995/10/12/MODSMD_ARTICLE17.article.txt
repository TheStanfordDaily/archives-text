# ASSU supports Casper
## Equity and accessibility a priority 
### 
THE COUNCIL OF Presi
dents of the Associated
Students of Stanford
University believes strongly in
the importance of equal access
to higher education.
As a community of learning,
Stanford benefits from the
diversity of backgrounds,
ideas, opinions and learning
styles that affirmative action
policies bring to our campus.
Today, there is a movement
to eliminate programs that
ensure that higher education,
among other quality of life
issues, be accessible to all stu
dents regardless of their race
or sex. Historically, Stanford
students have played an active
role in expanding access to
higher education. Because
income disparities, glass ceil
ings and racial insensitivity
persist, channels for equal
access must be maintained for
equity to be achieved. Only

interaction between individu
als of different ethnicities, on
an equal footing, can overcome
prejudice and promote general
understanding.
We applaud the stance
taken by University President
Gerhard Casper and his com-

raitment to
continuing
affirmative
action policies
at Stanford.
We all benefit
from equal
access to high
er education
and the com
munity it
engenders. It
is misleading

action is about a face-off

many qualified candidates, cer
tain candidates will have life his
tories which set them apart from
others. Race and class are two of
many factors which should be
considered.
For these reasons, we com
mend the University for its affir
mative action policies, which set
it apart as a model of equity and
accessibility in this nation. Keep
ing higher education accessible
to all is not only a function of
affirmative action, it is also a
matter of student aid. The diver

sity that currently exists at
Stanford, the quality of life we
share as students and the
strength of Stanford's academics
and life-learning experiences are
also dependent on the Universi
ty's commitment to need-blind
admissions.
In tandem and inseparable,
integral to the mission and suc
cess of Stanford, affirmative
action and need-blind admissions
will carry the University into the
next century.
To this end, we are committed.

Stolz and Nicole Vazquez.
