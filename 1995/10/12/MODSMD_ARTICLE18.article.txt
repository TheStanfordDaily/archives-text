## Explaining special-fee refund changes 
### 
THE ASSU HAS one of the
most democratic, student
oriented fee systems of any
student association in the coun
try, allowing a broad funding sys-

tern of student
activities while
protecting the
rights of stu
dents who object
to any particular
fee.
A student's
right to a fee
refund is guar
anteed in the
ASSU Constitu
tion, and part of

my job is to ensure that students
understand their rights and the
fee system itself.
Every dollar of the ASSU fee
that appears on the University
billwas approved by the student
body in the Spring General Elec
tion and pays for programs and
activities run bv student organi

sations.
Examples of groups receiving
fees this year include Club
Sports, Stanford-In-Government,
the Stanford Concert Network
and the Asian American Stu
dents' Association.
To charge its activities to stu
dents on the University bill, a
group must make its budget for
the following year available to the
public by publishing it in the
ASSU Elections Handbook,
which is distributed campus-wide
the week of the election.
Students have a chance to
evaluate whether a group's bud
get is something they would like
to fund, and can vote on each
group's fee request separately in
the election.
If a student group receives a
majority of votes in the election,
and the number of "yes" votes is
higher than 15 percent of regis
tered students, the group's fee
request is added to the ASSU fee

on the University bill.
None of the ASSU fees that
appear on the University bill pay
for the operations or program
ming of the ASSU itself. Projects
like Sunday Elicks, Lecture
Notes, Tele Flicks, Group Dis
counts and the Stanford Virtual
Directory are entirely self-fund
ing. In fact, these business pro
jects pay for the operations of the
ASSU and its banking service for
student organizations, as well as
the operations of the ASSU Sen
ate, Council of Presidents and
the ASSU Nominations Commis
sion.
What is a fee refund?
Before the third Friday of each
quarter, you are eligible to
request a refund from any or all
of the organizations funded
through the ASSU fee. By
requesting a refund, you are stat
ing that you object to an organi

zation's fee and do not intend to
participate in activities funded by
the fee.
Some groups, like ASSU Legal
Counseling and ASSU Speakers
Bureau, will deny students who
have taken a refund their services
or charge them at the time of use.
Groups are provided with a list of
ID numbers for students who
requested a refund so that they
can check to see if an individual is
eligible for their services. Names
of students are not made avail
able on these lists.
The deadline for requesting a
fee refund this quarter is tomor
row at 5 p.m. To request one, type
"telnet assu-serve 1234" from
your leland account, or run the
program from the ASSU's web
page. The URL is "http://www
leland.stanford.edu/group/assu/."
Requests are carried over each
quarter until the end of the '95-
