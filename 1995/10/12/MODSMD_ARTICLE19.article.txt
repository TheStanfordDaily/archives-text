# Fond send-off for Thompkins
## 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
In u reception brimming with warmth, laughter
and more than a few good-humored insults, the
members of the Memorial Church community yes
terday hid farewell to the Rev Floyd Thompkins Jr.
Thompkins, who served as the church's dean for
graduate students, will leave Stanford on Oct. 31 to
become the pastor of the Antioch Baptist Church in
San Jose. He will continue to work out of the
Provost's Office as a part-time consultant to advising
programs and graduate students for the remainder of
the school year.
Thompkins* departure leaves the church without
any acting deans for students. Diana Akiyaina, for
mer dean for undergraduate students, left last
March
The church has placed ads in the Chronicle of
Higher Education and religious journals of all faiths
in an effort to find replacements.
"People keep coming up to me and saying, 'How
could you let this man go?,' " Dean of the Chapel
Robert (iregg said at yesterday's gathering.
Several students from the Black Church at Stan
lord Committee, a group that Thompkins started,
attended the reception. They expressed a shared sad
ness at Thompkins' leaving, and praised his work at
Stanford.
"He made a major contribution to this campus
far beyond what any staff or administrator has, easi
ly," said junior Michael Turner.

In addition to founding the Black Church Com
mittee, Thompkins was the key facilitator in initiat
ing Partners for Academic Excellence, a program
implemented last year to pair African-American
freshmen with mentors from the Stanford commu
nity. He also started "What Matters to Me and
Why," a program for graduate students that brings
weekly faculty speakers to Memorial Church.
Renee Blake, a graduate student who spoke at the
reception, tried to emphasize the importance of
Thompkins' presence on campus with an anecdote
about conversations she has been having with friends
and family in the last few weeks.
Recently, when asked the question, "What do you
think?" Blake said she assumed her answer should
address the O.J. Simpson trial.
But when junior Kesha Weekes approached Blake
outside the Bookstore and asked, "Have you heard?"
the question concerned Thompkins' imminent depar
ture from Stanford.
"Floyd is outdoing 0.J.," Blake said.
After receiving many such accolades, accompanied
by embraces, Thompkins himself was finally given a
chance to speak, confessing that "I try to avoid these
occasions like you would not believe."
Thompkins admitted that California had not been
his first choice of job location when he came to Stan
ford six years ago, hut that he had grown to'like it.
"That may be how God works with a great sense of
humor," he said.
"It was such a jov and a privilege to lx? on this cam
pus, working and praying with you," he said.
