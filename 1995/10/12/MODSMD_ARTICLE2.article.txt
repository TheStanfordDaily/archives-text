# SLAC physicist wins Nobel Prize
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Martin Perl, a physicist at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, was
awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
yesterday, becoming the third SIJ\C
recipient of the physics prize in the last
19 years.
Perl, who won the prize for his dis
covery of the particle tau lepton, will
share his $1 million award with Fred
erick Reines, a physicist at UC-Irvine.
Reinesdiscovered the neutrino.
The previous SI,AC recipients are
Director Burton Richter, who received
the prize in 1976, and physicist Richard
Taylor, who won the prize in 1990.
Perl'saward makes him the 12th Nobel
Laureate to be affiliated with Stanford.
The news of the award came as a
shock to Perl. "I am really surprised,"
he said. "I did not expect it this year."
At a reception yesterday, University
President Gerhard Casper praised
Perl's innovation. "Surely when we are
at SIjAC or at any of the universities,
people believe everything is team
work," he said. "There are still also in
dividual contributions. Martin is exem
plary of that
In particle physics theory, elemen
tary particles are subdivided into three
families, each of which consist of two
leptons and two quarks. Perl's detec
tion in the mid-1970s of the tau lepton
led to the discovery of the third family
of elementary particles, which includes
the bottom and top quarks and the tau
neutrino. The bottom quark was dis
covered in 1976, while the top quark
was found only last year The tau neu
trino is yet to be seen.
The tau lepton, while related to the
electron, is .'l,OOO times heavier and its
duration is less than a trillionth of a
second. It can only be created in an ac
celerator.
"This discovery is important in try
ingto understand what the universe
made of," Perl said. "We have found
that it is made of three leptons and siN
quarks."
Yet, while physicists understand I Ik
components which make up the uni
verse. thev do not understand whv the

universe is constituted the way it is,
Perl said.
His recent research is directed to
that end. Perl said he is trying to find
free quarks part ides which were cre
ated at the beginning of the universe
and which are not yet bound up in mat
ter.
Richter said he hoped the award
would help SLA(' receive more re
search funding from the federal gov
ernment.
"This is one of those testimonials

that says the work wo do is great sci
ence," Richter said. "Everyone knows
that the budget is under pressure. This
Nobel Prize in fundamental research is
something that Congress and the Clin
ton Administration will regard as posi
tive. The taxpayers have supported us
and (Ins will make them think it is all
wort h while."
(-asper agreed, and said he will work
"with resumed vigor" to prevent bud
get cuts in basic research.
Such increased government outlays

are critical to scientific future,
Perl said. Currently, while the funds
given to SLAC are not being cut out
right, t hey are not being adjusted for in
flation, which results in less money
each year.
"Hopefully, we will get some more
money for permanent jobs for younger
scientists and for trying odder kinds of
research," Perl said. "With less money,
we have to focus on what is important
