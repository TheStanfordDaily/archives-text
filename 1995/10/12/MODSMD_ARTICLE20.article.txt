### Jimmy Boegle 
Friends and family remembered and celebrated
the life of Channing Werner Stowell IV at a service
held in Memorial Church last night.
"Chan was always happy and he always had a
smile on his face," said Catherine Adams-Sim
mons, a senior in industrial engineering, in an
interview before the service. "He did his own
thing. He could get along with anybody and was a
very loyal friend."
Stowell, a 21-year-old senior in symbolic sys
tems, suffered from manic depression. After a
lengthy battle with the 1 disease, he committed sui
cide Aug. 4 in his hometown of Harrington, 111.
Approximately 90 people showed up for the
hour-long service, including several members of
his family, who traveled from Illinois to attend the
service.
A member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraterni
ty, Stowell also participated in the Stanford pro
gram in Florence during fall quarter 1994 He was
a member of the ski team, active in a number of
public service projects and had been accepted to
the Honors College for his senior year
Stowell's father, Channing Stowell 111, spoke at
the service about how manic depression took his
son's life. "Chan suffered from a fatal disease of
the brain, a disease as real as cancer, as real as dia
betes. Sometimes people recover; sometimes peo

pie do not."
Stowell's father also spoke of his son's
strength. "1 am really proud of how hard he
worked to fight this disease. He was a real fighter,
a battler. When he took his life, he was nowhere
close to the Chan you and I loved. The disease ate
his mind."
Many of his friends reflected on Stowell's dis
tinctive smile and his sense of adventure. "I feel
blessed that I was given a chance to know Chan,"
said Adams-Simmons at the service. "If it is not
Chan's smile that you remember, it is the smile
you had while watching him do all sorts of crazy
things. He was always up for an adventure.
"Chan was an adventurer," said Heather
Cairns, a student service specialist in the Comput
er Science Department. "He accepted nothing at
face value and I grew to love him as a result. 1 am
pleased that I had the chance to know him. It was
too brief."
"I will always remember Chan's smile," Craig
Garrett, a senior in art and English, said at the
service. "It came from the deepest part of him. It
looked like a child's smile.
"I will always remember his silliness, his way of
doing things that was so Chan. For the rest of my
life, Chan will always be smiling," he added.
Donations in Stowell's memory am be sent to the
National Depressive and Manic Depressive Associa
tion, 730 N. Franklin St., Chicago, 111. 60610.
