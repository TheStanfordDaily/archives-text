A record-breaking 6,000 alumni are

several days of events for the 1995 Stanford
Reunion Homecoming Weekend.
While there is no featured homecoming
speaker this year, Stanford alumnus and

the Courts: Real or Imagined?," said D.J.
Dull, program director for homecoming.

of 1950, as well as Law School Dean Paul
Brest, University President Gerhard Casper

Codes and the First Amendment," featuring
the two central actors in last spring's debate
on the Stanford speech code — Law Prof.

Thomas Grey and Law School alumnus
Robert Corry. University Trustee Charles
Ogletree Jr. will moderate the panel.
This year's Homecoming Weekend marks
the beginning of the Law School's $50 mil
lion comprehensive fundraising campaign.
Already $21 million strong, the funds from
the campaign will be used to attract and
retain faculty members, help law students
finance the cost of legal education and main
tain the law library's traditional collections
of books, according to a University news
release.
The popular Great Student-Alumni Debate
begins at 11:30 a.m. Sunday, allowing current
students and t heir predecessors to face off on
a range of current issues, Dull said.
One alumnus, Alonso Smith, is returning
for his 45th reunion with a new book, "Real
or Surreal: Social Satirical Statements in
Art." He will present a slide show tomorrow
at the Stanford Bookstore. An exhibition of
Smith's work goes on display today at Bechtel
International Center.
Other notable attendees include San Fran-

Quizzes," which introduce alumni to Stan
lord faculty, are held tomorrow afternoon. In
addition, this year's festivities feature nine
"Sunday Seminars" led by Stanford profes
sors and coaches. Dull said the seminars are
expected to be particularly successful because
they are formatted for small groups dis

transition to birdwatching.
