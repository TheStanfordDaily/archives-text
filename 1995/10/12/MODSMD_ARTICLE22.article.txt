## No slowing down Women's cross country takes show on road 
### Matt Miller Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's cross
country team will send its run
ners halfway across the coun
try this weekend to set? where
they stand halfway through the
season.
One thing not measured in
fractions will be the Cardinal
runners' effort level, sure to be
100 percent as the women race
against some of the nation's
best at the lowa State Cross
Country Classic in Ames, lowa
on Saturday. Stanford will also
send a group of runners to the
Cal-Poly Mustang Invitational
at San Luis Obispo.
Aptly called the Pre-Nation
als, the race in Ames will provide
runners with an opportunity to
preview the exact same 5,000
meter course they will navigate
in the NCAA Championships in
November, which is one strong
argument for traveling to lowa
in the middle of the season.
Sophomore Kortney Dun
scombe does not mind traveling
to the cornfields of the Mid

west. 'Its good experience to
run elsewhere," she said. "Also,
it is a good opportunity to scout
the course and work on some
strategy for the National
Championships."
Another argument for the
lengthy road trip is the level of
competition. Four of the
nation's top 10 teams will be
running, including No. 1 Vil
lanova and No. 2 Colorado. Vil
la nuva is the defending nation
al champion and is picked by
many to repeat.
"This is our first chance to
run against really fast competi
tion," said freshman star Mary
Cobb. The competition has not
been fast enough for Cobb so
far this season. She has raced
to the individual title in each of
her first two collegiate meets,
most recently at the Stanford
Invitational two weekends ago.
The Cardinal is anything but
a one woman show, though. As
anyone on the team will tell
attest to, it is through teamwork
and chemistry that the Cardinal
has climbed so hitrh in the rank
ingß. "We work really well as a
team and don't compete amongst
each other," junior Monal Chokshi
said. "We really thrive on the team
concept."
That team concept has made
Stanford one of the nation's elite
cross country programs. After its
complete domination over a
strong field at the Stanford Invi
tational, including then-No. 5
Arkansas, the Cardinal has
moved up to No. 4 in the nation.
While a top-five ranking is cer
tainly impressive, the team has
more to prove. "We're not looking
for rankings right now," Chokshi
said. "We're still progressing.
We're not fulfilling expectations
— we're making them. It's excit
ing to be considered ope of the
best in the country, but the only
poll that matters is the poll the
day after the NCAAs."
Despite the temptation to take
a "showdown" attitude towards
Saturday's race with other high
ly ranked teams, Stanford run
ners remain focused on the
upcoming "championship por
tion" of their season, which
includes the Pacific 10 Champi
onships Oct. 28 at Stanford, the
District 8 Regional Champi
onships Nov. 11 in Portland, Ore.
and the NCAA Championships
Nov. 20 back in Ames.
"This will be a good test for us,
but this race is not the big, tell
tale story." said head coach Vin
Lananna. "The Pac-lOs and the
District 8s are the two we're real
ly aiming for. Those will really
tell the tale for how we do at the
end of the season."
