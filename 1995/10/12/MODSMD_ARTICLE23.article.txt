# Men's cross country hits the road
## No. 3 runners split up to compete in two away meets this weekend 
### Matt Miller Contributing writer 
What are the alternatives for a
cross country coach when there
are two meets scheduled for the
same day nearly 3,000 miles apart
from each other? For Stanford
men's cross country coach Vin
Lananna, the solution is simple.
Send two teams.
This weekend, Lananna will
dispatch nine of his top runners
to the lowa State Cross Country
Classic in Ames, lowa while
sending eight more to compete in
theCal-Poly Mustang Invitation
al at San Luis Obispo, Calif. The
primary emphasis this weekend
will be in Ames at the meet also
known as Pre-Nationals.
Technically, the runners
heading for the Midwest com
prise Stanford's A Group, but
the Cardinal is so deep it believes
there is no B Group. It is a popu
lar team opinion that everyone
has a shot at being one of the top
seven who will compete in the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, the District 8 Champi

unships and the NCAA Champi
onships at the end of the season.
It is this strength from top to
bottom which makes Stanford
one of the finest cross country
programs in the country. With a
workman-like effort, the Cardi
nal edged out a powerful North
ern Arizona team two weekends
ago at the Stanford Invitational
to steal the nation's No. 3 rank
ing from the Lumberjacks.
The lineup at lowa will resem
ble the one which proved suc
cessful at the Invitational.
.Junior captain Creg .Jimmerson
will spearhead sophomores Matt
Farley and Nathan Nutter,
senior Mark Fadil, juniors James
Long, J.J. White and Bryan Zmi
jewski and freshman twins Brent
and Brad Mauser.
Stanford will run against
Northern Arizona, now ranked
fourth, as well as an entire field
of national powers. Seven of the
nation's top 25 teams will com

pete, including No. 10 Ten
nessee, No. 13 Notre Dame and
hometown lowa State, the
defending national champions.
The eighth-ranked Cyclones are
not as highly respected by poll
sters this year, but Lananna does
not concern himself with rank
ings. "Those [polls! don't mean a
tiling," he said. "As a matter of
fact, sometimes they really dis
tort things."
The Pre-Nationals will give
teams a taste of the course on
which they will run for the
NCAA Championships in
November, but in a shorter ver
sion. The race on Saturday will
be of the 8,000 meter variety,
while the NCAA competition will
cover 10,000 meters.
Because it marks the halfway
point of the season and the
biggest meets are yet to come,
the Pre-Nationals will also pro
vide coaches with a good
progress report. "This will be a
good test for us to see how far
along we have progressed,"
Lananna said. "I'm pretty confi
dent that we have progressed
iust how far. we'll have to find

out."
The Stanford runners are also
at an important part of the sea
son in terms of conditioning.
"We're at a junction right now
where we've leveled off our vol
ume and we're beginning to
intensify our workouts," Lanan
na said. "Now what we need to
do is to lessen our volume — not
worry so much about how many
miles we're doing but the quality
of what we're doing. That's
always a tricky time."
To help combat the effects of
traveling, which Lananna does
not see causing a problem any
way, the team will travel to Ames
on Thursday and plans to run
the course on Friday.
White, a veteran compared to
the many underclassmen on the
team, does not let the hype of
Pre-Nationals deter his focus.
"Despite the name 'Pre-Nation
als,' this is not a huge meet for
us," he said. "We have certain
goals for this meet, but [we| also
put them in perspective as to
how Itheyl will fit in for achiev
ing what we want by the end of
the season."

Stanford men's cross country prepares for the start of the Stanford Invitational earlier this season.
unships and the NCAA Champi
onships at the end of the season.
It is this strength from top to
bottom which makes Stanford
one of the finest cross country
programs in the country. With a
workman-like effort, the Cardi
nal edged out a powerful North
ern Arizona team two weekends
ago at the Stanford Invitational
to steal the nation's No. 3 rank
ing from the Lumberjacks.
The lineup at lowa will resem
ble the one which proved suc
cessful at the Invitational.
.Junior captain Creg .Jimmerson
will spearhead sophomores Matt
Farley and Nathan Nutter,
senior Mark Fadil, juniors James
Long, J.J. White and Bryan Zmi
jewski and freshman twins Brent
and Brad Mauser.
Stanford will run against
Northern Arizona, now ranked
fourth, as well as an entire field
of national powers. Seven of the
nation's top 25 teams will com

pete, including No. 10 Ten
nessee, No. 13 Notre Dame and
hometown lowa State, the
defending national champions.
The eighth-ranked Cyclones are
not as highly respected by poll
sters this year, but Lananna does
not concern himself with rank
ings. "Those [polls! don't mean a
tiling," he said. "As a matter of
fact, sometimes they really dis
tort things."
The Pre-Nationals will give
teams a taste of the course on
which they will run for the
NCAA Championships in
November, but in a shorter ver
sion. The race on Saturday will
be of the 8,000 meter variety,
while the NCAA competition will
cover 10,000 meters.
Because it marks the halfway
point of the season and the
biggest meets are yet to come,
the Pre-Nationals will also pro
vide coaches with a good
progress report. "This will be a
good test for us to see how far
along we have progressed,"
Lananna said. "I'm pretty confi
dent that we have progressed
iust how far. we'll have to find

out."
The Stanford runners are also
at an important part of the sea
son in terms of conditioning.
"We're at a junction right now
where we've leveled off our vol
ume and we're beginning to
intensify our workouts," Lanan
na said. "Now what we need to
do is to lessen our volume — not
worry so much about how many
miles we're doing but the quality
of what we're doing. That's
always a tricky time."
To help combat the effects of
traveling, which Lananna does
not see causing a problem any
way, the team will travel to Ames
on Thursday and plans to run
the course on Friday.
White, a veteran compared to
the many underclassmen on the
team, does not let the hype of
Pre-Nationals deter his focus.
"Despite the name 'Pre-Nation
als,' this is not a huge meet for
us," he said. "We have certain
goals for this meet, but [we| also
put them in perspective as to
how Itheyl will fit in for achiev
ing what we want by the end of
the season."
