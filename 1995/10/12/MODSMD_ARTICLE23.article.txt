# Men's cross country hits the road
## No. 3 runners split up to compete in two away meets this weekend 
### Matt Miller Contributing writer 
What are the alternatives for a
cross country coach when there
are two meets scheduled for the
same day nearly 3,000 miles apart
from each other? For Stanford
men's cross country coach Vin
Lananna, the solution is simple.
Send two teams.
This weekend, Lananna will
dispatch nine of his top runners
to the lowa State Cross Country
Classic in Ames, lowa while
sending eight more to compete in
theCal-Poly Mustang Invitation
al at San Luis Obispo, Calif. The
primary emphasis this weekend
will be in Ames at the meet also
known as Pre-Nationals.
Technically, the runners
heading for the Midwest com
prise Stanford's A Group, but
the Cardinal is so deep it believes
there is no B Group. It is a popu
lar team opinion that everyone
has a shot at being one of the top
seven who will compete in the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, the District 8 Champi
