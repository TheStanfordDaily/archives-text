1 his year, we have the ingredi
ents of experience and the fire of
upcoming rowers."
These optimistic words of Stan
ford men's crew coach Wieslaw
Kujda are coupled with an intensi
ty and determination that Kujda
hopes his team will also adopt. Fol
lowing a successful season last year
in which the team placed fourth in
the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, expectations are high as
the team begins its 1995-96 cam
paign
Although the Cardinal returns
numerous veterans to compliment
its freshman talent, there are no
stars this year for Stanford.
Despite this, Kujda pointed out
that a few years ago, the team

lacked stars, but managed to row an
extremely successful season and
place in nationals. This year's squad
possesses the size and speed neces
sary to win. Now everything
depends on the rowers' willingness.
For now, Kujda reports that "desire
and intensity in practices. . . are
very high."
While the squad might not fea
ture any stars, its coach definitely
holds his own when it comes to
coaching ability. In his six years as
a Stanford crew coach, Kujda has
posted successful seasons, includ
ing placement in the 1993 nation
als. In addition, he earned Pac-10
Coach of the Year honors in 1994.
Kujda and his team will begin
the season on Saturday in the Cal
Head Race. In all, the fall season
consists of six races including the

Head of Charles, the prominent
East Coast race in which Stanford
will face Ivy League powerhouses
Harvard, Princeton and Yale.
Kujda will use the fall season to try
different lineups and "break into
hard work" in preparation for the
upcoming spring season.
While Kujda hesitated in voicing
his expectations, some general
goals of the squad are clear. One
goal, set by members hist year for
the upcoming season, is to win the
Pac-1() this spring. The other is to
place in the top 10 nationally.
However, while these two goals
serve as a general direction for the
team, they are not meant to serve
as a limit. "I'm extremely excited,"
Kujda said, "but I'm putting more
pressure on [the team] and myself
to go farther."
