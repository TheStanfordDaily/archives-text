It's still early, but from the
looks of its season opener, this
year's Stanford men's golf squad
may be a bit better than expected.
The Cardinal recovered from
early problems to finish a strong
second at the Northwestern Uni
versity / Windon Memorial Clas
sic. The team shot a 54-hole total
of 895, onlv four strokes behind

Florida and ahead of 10 other
teams.
"We had a great time up
there," said head coach Wally
Goodwin, "It was really different
going up there with basically a
new bunch of guys, but things
went very well."
After the first round, Stanford
found itself in second place, down
by 14 strokes to the Gators. Diffi
cult pin placements, afternoon
winds and offseason rust com

bined to five the squad fits.
"We were playing for the first
time this season on what was per
haps the hardest course we'll see
this whole year," Goodwin said.
"It was only natural to have a few
problems."
However, things came together
in a big way for the Cardinal on
the final 18 holes at Kemper
Lakes Golf Club. The squad gob
bled up the deficit, firing the low
round for the day at 292. At one
point, the team actually caught up
to Florida, but the Gators finished
strongly to end four strokes ahead
and preserve the victory.
"It was a pretty good come
back," said junior Conrad Ray,
"but we were just at too much of a
disadvantage starting the round
to pull off the win."
Sophomore Ail-American Tiger
Woods led the Stanford effort
with a second-place finish individ
ually. Woods made a strong run at
the title by firing a five-under-par
67 in the second round, but Flori
da sophomore Josh McCumber
held his ground, countering with
a two-under 70. For the tourna
ment, the pair were the only play
ers to finish under par.
Freshman Joel Kribel showed
flashes of Tiger-like potential,
kicking off his collegiate career in
impressive fashion. After jumping
out to a tie for fourth place on the
first day, Kribel cooled down a bit
to finish eighth overall in his first
appearance for the Cardinal.
"You don't like to put that kind
of pressure on one of your players,
but the comparisons [with Tiger]
are going to be inevitable," Good
win said. "Joel has a great all
around game. He's has a tremen
dous future ahead of him."
Senior captain Jerry Chang
charged back to finish in 12th
place after an abysmal first two
rounds, posting the fourth best
score of the day with a one-under
71. Ray found himself in the exact
opposite position, struggling in
the final round with an 82 and
falling to 20th. Senior Pete Ligot
ti never seemed to find his
rhythm, shooting over 80 on two
of the three rounds and rounding
out the team's effort in 56th
place.
For the three upperclassmen,
the experience of playing in the
starting five was largely a new
