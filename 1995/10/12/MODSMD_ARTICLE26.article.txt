# Women rowers optimistic

### Laura Drum 
As t he time approaches once again for Stanford
sports teams to strut their stuff, and training
begins in earnest, one often overlooked team is also
working hard in anticipation of the upcoming year.
The women's crew team prepares for a promis
ing season. After placing seventh overall in the
country last year and second on the West Coast,
the Cardinal plans to build on that record this
year. Having lost only one rower to graduation,
hopes are high for a very successful season.
"I would like to be in the top three in the coun
try," said coach Aimee Baker.
Eyes will turn to Baker as she head coaches
varsity crew at Stanford for the first time. Despite
limited experience with the Cardinal, Baker did
serve as assistant coach last year, and before that,
she coached at UC-Santa Barbara for three years.
And if Baker's recruiting ability reflects her
ability to coach, there is no need to worry. This
year's freshman recruitment proved extremely
successful, with four freshman recruits training
now for varsity competition.
Led by junior co-captain Julie Lewczyk (the

"soul" of the team), senior co-captain Kara John
son and top rower Maria Klemperer-Johnson, the
Cardinal is poised for an impressive year. Accord
ing to Baker, the squad definitely possesses the
necessary physical skills. Now the rowers must
show they know how to use them.
"They need to prove themselves," Baker said,
"but I'm very optimistic."
The team will receive its first chance to prove
its skills at the Cal Head Race this Saturday. Fol
lowing the Cal regatta, the team will compete in
five other races this fall, including races at Wash
ington and San Mateo, and the Head of Charles,
in which Stanford will face infamous eastern
teams such as Harvard and Yale. After placing
14th last year out of 45 in the Head of the
Charles, the Cardinal hopes to achieve at least
top-10 status this year.
The three-mile long fall races will provide
insight into (he team's potential for the more crit
ical spring season. All the races this year will
build up to the Nationals in June.
Only time will determine the results of these
races, but the current outlook is optimistic. "I
really think it lies in [ourl hands," Baker said.
