# Sailors look to maintain success
## Sailing comes home this weekend after road regattas 
### Elisabeth Krebs 
Already immersed in his fourth
season as head sailing coach,
Steve Bourdow has not yet posted
a disappointing season. Consecu
tively finishing in the top 10 in
the past three years, the 1995-
1996 campaign should prove no
worse, if not better. With only
four regattas behind it, the Stan
ford sailing team has revealed its
depth, dedication, endurance and
potential to land itself a top-five
seeding, provided the winds are
good and the sailors strong.
Last weekend proved to be a
busy weekend for Bourdow and
his team. While three members
shoved off for a regatta hosted by
the Naval Academy, Stanford also
traveled closer to home, compet
ing in an intersectional regatta
hosted by Berkeley. In both regat
tas, Stanford sailors never once
lost their composure, regardless
of the outcome. Skill and stamina
were never replaced with any
thing short of goal-oriented aspi
rations, whether the sailors
placed first or seventh.
Up at Berkeley, Stanford
claimed first with 52 points, out
sailing favored Cal, which placed a
surprising third with 80 points.
Hawaii captured second place
with 79 points.
Stanford's surge came from a
determined team consisting of
two forceful sailors, sophomores
John Meade and Heather Rogers.
Competing in the A Division,
Meade and Rogers swept through
each race, refusing to compromise
their goal to outsail Cal. Their
hard efforts were rewarded with a
first-place finish in Division A.
Two teams represented Stan
ford in Division B. The combina
tion of Betsy Carmichael and
Danny Zimbaldi started out for
the Cardinal. The sophomores
sailed in the first four races
before Bourdow decided to sub
stitute in his alternate team,
comprised of sophomore Mara
Holian and senior captain Adam
Lowry.
"Carmichael and Zimbaldi had

some trouble with boat speed, but
regardless of their performance, I
wanted to get a good look at both
teams," Bourdow said. Lowry and
Holian finished the remaining
races, consistently placing first
and second. In the end, however,
they lost to Hawaii in a tight tie
breaker.
Cal, meanwhile, suffered two
major disqualifications which
hurt its score tremendously. It is
unknown whether the disqualifi
cations came as a result of blatant
disregard for rules or illegal tam
pering with boats.
"Cal rarely pulls it together,
which is a shame because we
know they've got the talent,"

Bourdow said. Without the dis
qualifications, the race could have
gone either way.
"Rogers and Lowry did a num
ber on two of Cal's most competi
tive seniors, who placed second in
last year's Nationals," Bourdow
said, setting aside the issue of the
disqualifications. "It was impor
tant for the two of them to rival
Cal, be equally competitive oppo
nents and show Cal they really
aren't as great as they assume.
Although Cal's two senior sailors
are great sailors, Rogers and
Lowry sailed just as fast and just
as smart. Once they got going,

they couldn't be stopped.'
Carmichael agreed "Lowry and
Rogers pushed Cal really hard,
proving that Stanford sails with
more determination and focus
than Cal," he said.
The Cardinal displayed the same
potential at Annapolis, although
Stanford didn't place in the top live.
Sophomore Susan Bradford and
freshman Taylor Robinson sailed in
Division A, while Alice Manard
competed in Divison C. Overall,

Stanford walked away with sixth
place, which wasn't ;is successful ;us
Bourdow expected.
Horrible weather conditions
throughout Saturday, the first day
of the regatta, made it tough for
Stanford to prove anything at all.
"Sunday, however, made it all
worth it," Bradford said.
With shifting winds improving
the conditions, Bradford and
Robinson, who had only sailed
toget her once before during prac
tice. posted a good time sailing in
their 11 races. Their efforts
focused more upon sailing smooth
ly as a team than on their success.
Overall t.hnv nlnced sixth

Manard finished fifth, which
Bourdow considered to be below
her potential. "Shifting winds are
not her forte," he said. '"Regard
less of her placement, she is still
one of the most well-respected
sailors in our division, if not
nationally, and is one of the rea
sons why Stanford is still ranked
third."
Upcoming for Stanford is the
Oct. 14 Stanford Invite. Schools
from all over will send their best.
Stanford will sail against No. 1
Navy, No. 2 Cal and other solid
fleets such as UC-Irvine, Tufts,
Old Dominion, St. Mary's and
Charleston.
