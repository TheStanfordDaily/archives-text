# Is new grading policy dishonorable? Faculty fear thesis decline
## 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
The institution of the new grading pol
icy has some departments worried about
its potential effects on students interested
in pursuing honors work.
In the past, students in some depart
ments have conducted their honors re
search throughout an entire academic

year. Under this arrangement, they
would sign up for several units of honors
work each quarter. Students received an
"N" grade for those units until they sub
mitted the final thesis, when Ihey re
ceived graded credit for all of their re
search units.
Students who decided not to complete
their theses usually dropped the research
units retroactively, received no credit and

avoided any mention of incomplete work
on their transcripts. But under the new
policy, students who don't manage to fin
ish their theses could receive a "no pass"
or a "withdraw" for their research units.
Economics Undergraduate Assistant
Nicole Reed said the risk of receiving such
marks will discourage students from
doing honors research.
"A lot of people may decide not to do an

honors project because they don't want
that ugly 'W' or 'NP' on their transcript,"
she said. "I do think it will affect the num
ber of students considering honors."
The policy's ramifications
Although the new grading policy will
not affect students who successfully com
plete their honors work, it may present
some harsh consequences for those who

do not finish their projects.
"Some students start an honors project
and later decide not to finish for some rea
son," said History Asst. Prof. Laura
Smoller, director of the history honors
program. "Under the old grading policy,
the student would go back and change all
the research units to directed reading or
drop them retrospectively.
"The problem is that, with (he
new grading policy, you can't go
back and drop things retroactively
or change them," she added. "If
there was a student who started an
honors project this year and decid
ed not to finish, it's very conceiv
able that the only choice would be
to give no credit for all those
units."
Smoller said the risk of receiv
ing a "NP" would be a "real worry
that would keep students from

starting honors."
Biology Prof Robert Simoni, a
member of the Faculty Senate that
approved the grading policy
change, said he was unaware of
any problems with regard to hon
ors work. lie added that the senate
did not consider the possible rami
fications on honors students when
debating the policy change.
He said he did not have any con
cerns about how the new grading
policy might affect students who do
not complete their honors
research.
"I can't imagine that it's actual
ly a problem," he said. "We submit
grades for our honors students
everv quarter, so it certainly is not

a problem in our department."
The outlook
History Prof Jack Rakove,
director of undergraduate studies
in history, said his department has
considered several different
options to remedy the situation.
"Our original inclination was to
have students do the early seg
ments of honors work satisfactory /
no credit," he said. "We didn't
want to use a full letter grade
option because we wouldn't have
enough of a basis to assign honors
letter grades.
"None of the honors students
were happy with this option. If
they successfully complete their

project, they want full letter grade
credit for their work," he said
Rakove said he and his col
leagues are now considering keep
ing the original practice of assign
ing "N" grades for research units
until the thesis is submitted.
"We assume most students will
complete their honors work and
hope the new grading policy will
serve as an incentive for those who
are uncerfciin," he said. He added
that he and other history faculty
would be meeting with honors stu
dents tomorrow to discuss their
opinions on the situation.
The potential grade risks have
also raised concerns about whet her
students miirht be discouraged

from pursuing honors research in
the future.
Laura Selznick, director of
Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities, said she hasn't seen any evi
dence of a decline in students'
interest in doing research for hon
ors work.
"Nothing in my work indicates a
change in student behavior about
the honors thesis," she said. "In
the last ten years, the number of
students applying for funding has
gone up."
Hut she added that it was "too
early to tell" whether the new
grading policy would affect the
number of students considering
writing a thesis.

Rakove said he doesn't think
students will turn down the oppor
tunity to do honors work just
because of the new grading policy.
"I don't think it will affect the
number of honors students, and I
hope it won't," he said. "I think the
key to having a good honors thesis
is making sure the students have a
good project formulated for the
fall. As long as |the department]
performs well, it should alleviate
most of the problems."
However, he said that "the
new grading policy might bear
some reconsideration in light of
its impact on students' interest
and willingness to undertake
honors."

she said. "I do think it will affect the num
ber of students considering honors."
The policy's ramifications
Although the new grading policy will
not affect students who successfully com
plete their honors work, it may present
some harsh consequences for those who

do not finish their projects.
"Some students start an honors project
and later decide not to finish for some rea
son," said History Asst. Prof. Laura
Smoller, director of the history honors
program. "Under the old grading policy,
the student would go back and change all
the research units to directed reading or
drop them retrospectively.
"The problem is that, with (he
new grading policy, you can't go
back and drop things retroactively
or change them," she added. "If
there was a student who started an
honors project this year and decid
ed not to finish, it's very conceiv
able that the only choice would be
to give no credit for all those
units."
Smoller said the risk of receiv
ing a "NP" would be a "real worry
that would keep students from

starting honors."
Biology Prof Robert Simoni, a
member of the Faculty Senate that
approved the grading policy
change, said he was unaware of
any problems with regard to hon
ors work. lie added that the senate
did not consider the possible rami
fications on honors students when
debating the policy change.
He said he did not have any con
cerns about how the new grading
policy might affect students who do
not complete their honors
research.
"I can't imagine that it's actual
ly a problem," he said. "We submit
grades for our honors students
everv quarter, so it certainly is not

a problem in our department."
The outlook
History Prof Jack Rakove,
director of undergraduate studies
in history, said his department has
considered several different
options to remedy the situation.
"Our original inclination was to
have students do the early seg
ments of honors work satisfactory /
no credit," he said. "We didn't
want to use a full letter grade
option because we wouldn't have
enough of a basis to assign honors
letter grades.
"None of the honors students
were happy with this option. If
they successfully complete their

project, they want full letter grade
credit for their work," he said
Rakove said he and his col
leagues are now considering keep
ing the original practice of assign
ing "N" grades for research units
until the thesis is submitted.
"We assume most students will
complete their honors work and
hope the new grading policy will
serve as an incentive for those who
are uncerfciin," he said. He added
that he and other history faculty
would be meeting with honors stu
dents tomorrow to discuss their
opinions on the situation.
The potential grade risks have
also raised concerns about whet her
students miirht be discouraged

from pursuing honors research in
the future.
Laura Selznick, director of
Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities, said she hasn't seen any evi
dence of a decline in students'
interest in doing research for hon
ors work.
"Nothing in my work indicates a
change in student behavior about
the honors thesis," she said. "In
the last ten years, the number of
students applying for funding has
gone up."
Hut she added that it was "too
early to tell" whether the new
grading policy would affect the
number of students considering
writing a thesis.

Rakove said he doesn't think
students will turn down the oppor
tunity to do honors work just
because of the new grading policy.
"I don't think it will affect the
number of honors students, and I
hope it won't," he said. "I think the
key to having a good honors thesis
is making sure the students have a
good project formulated for the
fall. As long as |the department]
performs well, it should alleviate
most of the problems."
However, he said that "the
new grading policy might bear
some reconsideration in light of
its impact on students' interest
and willingness to undertake
honors."
The institution of the new grading pol
icy has some departments worried about
its potential effects on students interested
in pursuing honors work.
In the past, students in some depart
ments have conducted their honors re
search throughout an entire academic

year. Under this arrangement, they
would sign up for several units of honors
work each quarter. Students received an
"N" grade for those units until they sub
mitted the final thesis, when Ihey re
ceived graded credit for all of their re
search units.
Students who decided not to complete
their theses usually dropped the research
units retroactively, received no credit and

avoided any mention of incomplete work
on their transcripts. But under the new
policy, students who don't manage to fin
ish their theses could receive a "no pass"
or a "withdraw" for their research units.
Economics Undergraduate Assistant
Nicole Reed said the risk of receiving such
marks will discourage students from
doing honors research.
"A lot of people may decide not to do an

honors project because they don't want
that ugly 'W' or 'NP' on their transcript,"
she said. "I do think it will affect the num
ber of students considering honors."
