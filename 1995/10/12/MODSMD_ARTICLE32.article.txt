# Spike and Mike brine art to life
## animation festival comes to campus

Spike met Mike in the early '70s at River
side City College, in Riverside Califor
nia, when Spike was in a rock band called
Stcrno and the Hames. Having always been
drawn to "entrepreneurial, entertainment
based type of endeavors," Spike solicited the
help of Mike, and they began their partner
ship by promoting the band. Soon after that,
they began showing "midnight rock-n-roll
films," their first step in what would eventu
ally become the now legendary Spike and
Mike's Festival of Animation.
Occasionally, they opened these early
showings with short cartoons like "Betty
Hoop" or "Superman." Based on the audi
ence's positive reaction to these shorts, Spike
and Mike put on their first Festival of Anima
tion in 1977 in Riverside. Since that time, the
festival has grown in size and scope, experi
encing its biggest growth in the mid '80s. The
festival now traverses both the United States
and Canada, playing on and near college
campuses.
Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation is
one of the only platforms available for aspir
ing animators to disseminate their work. This
is unfortunate considering how much time
and effort animators put into making and
producing their films. Spike considers ani
mation to be much more of an art form than
it probably gets credit for.
"These people are just immensely talent
ed," says Spike of the animators showcased in
his festivals. "We just want people out there to
recognize what goes into some of these short
films; not just the subject matter but tech

nique and time and patience, the skill and the
gift they have."
Animators make films using various
styles. In addition to drawing and painting,
other methods employ such painstaking
media as computers, puppets, clay, paper and
cut-outs. It is not uncommon for an anima
tor to spend several years to make an animat
ed film that is under 15 minutes long. For ex
ample, in this year's "Best of the Festival of
Animation," there is an 11 -minute puppet
animation titled "Screenplay," by Barry
Purves of the United Kingdom. It took near
ly three years to make and was nominated for
an Academy Award in 1992.
"The film is just meticulously done," raves
Spike. "It is an incredible work of art. There is
painstaking perfection of animation and the
narration and lighting and sets and back
grounds and ... the puppets that are used.
It's just amazing."
In addition to technique, Spike also ad
mires some of the films — such as "The Big
Snit," animated by Richard Condie of Cana
da — for humorous content.
"This couple is playing Scrabble.... It's a
husband and wife," says Spike of the film.
"She's a fanatic about cleaning. She even vac
uums the bathtub. He's a fanatic about play
ing Scrabble. And they're playing a Scrabble
game oblivious to this nuclear war that's
going on outside their house. The whole
premise is pretty darn funny."
A big name in "Best of the Festival of An
imation" is Tim Burton, who went on
to direct "Batman" and "Beetlejuice."
One of his early animations, "Vincent," nar

rated by Vincent Price, is showcased. Like the
other films, the work going into the produc
tion of "Vincent" was immense. "Everything
had to be done frame by frame," Spike says.
"Then the lighting and all the backgrounds
had to be changed. It's just such a meticulous
process."
In addition to Tim Burton, other people
have gone on to experience

success after participating
in Spike and Mike's show.
Some of them now do ad
vertisements for Nike and
Levis. The festival's evil
twin, Spike and Mike's Sick
and Twisted Festival of Ani
mation — which plays at
midnight on selected nights
following the original show
— once featured an anima
tor named Mike Judge. In
the early 19905, Judge
now (in)famous for creat
ing Beavis and Butthead
premiered MTV's moronic
pair in the shorts "Frog
Baseball" and "Monster
Truck," which were both
originally showcased by
Spike and Mike.
While Spike wishes he
could have shown more of
Judge's work in the Sick and
Twisted shows (where the
shorts would not be subject
to as much scrutiny and
censorship as on TV), he
feels that other films such as
"Lloyd's Lunch Box" and
"Lupo the Butcher" will
more than fill any void in

outrageousness that Beavisand Butthead left
behind.
While the original festival is concerned
with the animated works as art forms and
cultural endeavors, the Sick and Twisted l es
tival is more of a fun side project. It started in
the early 19905.
"We had a lot of films coming in — 'Lupo
the Butcher' and things like that — which \u
thought were very funny, but didn't fit in with
the original show," Spike explains. "So, I
came up with the idea of Sick and Twisted to
... give it a title and a label in which to put the
films.... The Sick and Twisted is more of .1
midnight party-type event."
But the most important thing is Mill the
original Festival of Animation. With
the recent loss of Mike to pancreatic
cancer, Spike is nearly overwhelmed with tin
amount of work he must put in to sustain it.
However, he is still planning to diversity I le
wants to get more videos into the rental mat
ket, is planning on taking the Festival toother
countries and is even trying to get involved in
the high-tech market with plans of CD roms,
screen savers and satellite transmissions of
the films he features.
Spike and Mike's Festival is bringing ani
mation into the 21st century. But first,
they're bringing it to Stanford's Cubberh
Auditorium.
