## Kundera Betrayed: A 						book review in only one part 
### 
By Lynn Patyk
Arevi e we r
(after all, a
mere mor
tal amongst as
piring immor
tals) embarking
upon a review of
Milan Kundera's
"Testaments Be
trayed: An Kssay
in Nine Parts" is
beset first of all by
angst: What if the

reviewer, despite
the admonitions Kundera eloquently piles
on the heads of translators, literary critics,
the reading public in general and reviewers,
by some slip makes it clear that she has failed
to understand Kundera, or what's worse,
misrepresents or misinterprets him? What if,
despite all precautions and the best of inten
tions, the reviewer betrays Kundera and finds
herself indicted by the very book she is re
viewing?
Given these qualms, and the current para
digms of literary theory, it would be certain
folly to make any statement about authorial
intention; thus, "Testaments" can be read as
an effort, on Kundera's part, to instill rever
ence for the works that Kundera reveres, to re
dress wrongs that have been perpetrated
against them and their authors and to cham
pion the cause of the Author, who has been in

formed by literary theorists that he is dead,
but (if Kundera is any indication) refuses to lie
mute and quiescent at least not until im
mortality overtakes him. And, at this point,
prompted by his irrefutable mortality, it is
precisely immortality that concerns Kundera.
As, through anecdote, interpretation and
meditation, Kundera catalogs the ways in
which Kafka, Stravinski, Janacek et. al. have
been betrayed — not only by adversaries, but
by passionate adherents — Kundera reveals
his own experience with publication and
publicity and betrays anxiety over the fate of
his work. In "A Sentence," Kundera painstak
ingly illustrates how Kafka's essential aesthet
ic is distorted in the course of his mistransla
tion into French.
Reappearing throughout "Testaments",
Max Brod, who delivered both Kafka and
Janacek from obscurity, is deemed guilty (de
spite his best intentions) of misunderstanding
and mythologizing Kafka, and of relegating
Janacek to the ghetto of national composers.
The final essay, entitled "You're not in
your own house here, my dear fellow," re
counts how Stravinsky's own dear friend, the
conductor Ernest Ansermet, had the audaci
ty to suggest making certain cuts in the per
formance of "leu de cartes."
l ew authors have waged as vociferous a
campaign to elucidate their art and to fore
stall possible misunderstanding as Kundera.
An emigre Czech author consciously writing
for an international audience, he has issued
authorized translations of his works, relent

lcssly situated himself and his writings with
in the European context ("the European his
tory of the novel") and in his essays on the art
of the novel, stopped just short of proffering
authorized interpretations of his works.
Coincidentally, it is precisely misunder
standing and misrepresentation which impel
the plots of his stories and novels (recall Lud
wik's hasty postcard in"The Joke," Tomasz's
fateful Oedipus article and the "Dictionary
of Words Misunderstood" in"The Unbear
able Lightness of Being").
Whereas his fictional works derive their
delicious irony from the existential condition
of "misunderstanding," Kundera, while ac
knowledging this irony in "Testaments," does
not savor it and rails against it in an unchar
acteristically naive manner. "How is it possi
ble to love someone and at the same time
misunderstand him so completely?" Run
dera exclaims — a deceptively simple ques
tion which opens a complex can of philo
sophical worms only an unregenerate novel
ist would use as bait. Do we love the person,
or our understanding (representation) of
that person? How will we ever distinguish be
tween the two? How can we speak of love,
much less understanding, (or vice versa, the
relationship between the two remaining
open to contention) when, according to
Kundera, one of the greatest mysteries
known to man is: "over what period of time
can we consider a man identical to himself?"
If the essays which comprise "Testaments"
are read as cautionary tales — and they are

certainly not only that, but finely wrought
ruminations on the art of musical and novel
istic composition, as well as cultural com
mentary through which Kundera revisits his
customary themes — they remind us "that
we are not in our own house" when inter
preting the words, works, actions of others.
And specifically, when reading "Testa
ments," we are not in our own house, but
perhaps. . .our grandfather's. Those who
consider themselves Kundera devotees may
be disappointed to discover that the Kundera
of "Testaments" is not identical to the Kun
dera of "The Unbearable Lightness of Being";
that the novelist who moves between the
poignantly ironic and the profoundly lyrical,
slapstick hilarity and witty erudition is bare
ly discernible in this somewhat stodgy, self
righteous guardian of tradition, who in
veighs against rock music, disdains America,
doggedly resists the inclusion of women
writers in his pantheon (in "Testaments,"
they appear only as sexual objects) and de
cries the culture of uniform egocentricity "in
which every single person has a finger in
some orifice of his face" (p. 236).
Thus the reviewer, sufficiently discour
aged that she will ever understand this pro
tean Kundera, secretly longing for glimpses
of the unregenerate novelist (the self-pro
claimed partisan of ambiguity and the non
serious, the intrepid explorer of existence) in
the pedantic essayist, fears that with far
graver sin of betrayal imminent, she will be
reproached for slouching as well.
