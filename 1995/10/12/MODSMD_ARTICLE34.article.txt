# The 						Sea and Cake AND EAT IT TOO

' M m not sure what people mean when
■ they talk about "lounge music," but
■ the Sea and Cake aren't it. Or at least
that's the word from singer / guitarist
Sam Prekop, who's been batting down
one confused classification after another
since his band debuted on the U.S. indie
scene last year.
The Sea and Cake are an inventive
group of Chicago musicians who've been
saddled with the tag "lounge"' simply be
cause their feathery pop style defies just
I about every other known musical catego
rization. The group's three albums of
sweeping, fluttering soundscapes have
earned them a healthy bit of media atten
tion, though writers are usually stuck try
ing to pin down what makes this band so
unique.
One writer from Tuba Frenzy fanzine
■ tried honorably: "The Sea and Cake cre
ate a wonderfully smooth and catchy
blend of jazz, pop, Caribbean-flavored
dance music and that unique brand of
. 'loungefunk' that Shrimp Boat (Prekop's
former band) began to make famous." It
was an ambitious and insightful attempt,
but all Prekop had to say in response was,
"Wow, that's fuckin' weird, man," in a sort
of deep, lazy amazement. Prekop was
most confused by the ( aribbean part.
"Some of it might sound exotic, I guess,
hut it's certainly not something we're set
ting out to do, like, take care of this
I (Caribbean itch we've got.
' "Right now, there's a lot of sort of not
-1 normally-rock oriented stuff going on,
you know, like Ciastr del Sol and Tor
toise," Prekop explains. "There's some
thing going on that's more experimental
based than your average rock kind of
thing, but its not lounge either."
From this class of experimental indie
bands, the Sea and Cake are the most ac
cessible of the bunch. While groups like
(iastr del Sol work to redefine the way
people think of sound and music alto-

geth-

er, the Sea and Cake just
work on new ways to deliver sweet hooks
and pleasant moods, constructing near
perfect pop songs in ways that they aren't
usually constructed.
"We're sort of experimental in not a
real die-hard way," he says."I mean, it's
not like a credo."
The Sea and Cake story begins with
the demise of Chicago cult fa
vorites Shrimp Boat. "It had been
heading in sort of a bizarre direction for a
while, and it came to a point where we de
cided to do other stuff," Prekop recalls,
adding, "1 mean bizarre as in not good.
We had peaked out or something."
Not long after Shrimp Boat fell apart,
Prekop wrote some more Shrimp Boat
ish songs and recorded them with a new
bunch of musicians, including guitarist
Archer Prewitt of the Coctails, drummer
John McKntire of Tortoise, Ciastr del Sol
and Bastro and bassist Eric Claridge, also
formerly of Shrimp Boat. The group de
cided to take its name from a (iastr del Sol
song titled "The C in Cake."
The Sea and Cake's self-titled debut
was a rushed project, but it still offered
lazy anthems like "Polio" and "Bring My
Car I Feel to Smash It" as well as friendly
pop gems like "lacking the Ball" and
"Showboat Angel." It was easy listening in
the truest sense, with an effortless flow
and atmospheric vibe providing the satis
fying cohesion that Prekop's former
group lacked.
While the Sea and Cake's first album
was warmly received, few could expect that
the band could follow it up with some
thing as dazzling as "Nassau." Released
earlier this year, "Nassau" offers a more
ambitious style, from the Stereolab-y
organ rush of "Nature Boy" to the remark

able

pop slosh of "The World

Is Against You." Altogether, "Nassau" was a
breakthrough album from a band who
many believed had already broken
through.
Now, just months later, the group re
leases their third album, "The Biz." Prob
ably the band's most straightforward
work to date, "The Biz" offers 38 minutes
of wonderfully hazy pop, stripped down
to little more than its intermingling gui
tars and rich melody. You may get some
insight into the album's sound based on
what Prekop has been listening to lately:
Stereolab, Pram, some Bjork, some '70s
Brazilian fusion and lots of jazz. Combine
some of those elements with Prekop's
own unique vision and his band's exper
tise, and it's a weird mix, but it's a mix so
pretty that it sounds perfectly natural.
Despite his band's easygoing
Rounds, Prekop himself is hard to
please when it comes to his work.
"I almost never like the albums right after
I finish them," he says plainly. "They
never quite live up to my expectations. I ll
probably always be kind of a pain in the
ass that way."
Prekop might be a pain in the ass, but
his unrealistic ambitions have produced
three great albums in less than two years,
and as long as he doesn't become satis
fied, he shows no sign of slowing down. "I
have to be doing stuff all the time, other
wise I go crazy," says Prekop, who bal
ances a painting hobby with his always
busy music career.
"The more and more I do this, it gets
harder, so I have to work harder to get to
a point where I feel like its actually getting
better," he says. "That's why I'll probably
be making albums for a long time. I feel
like only now am I getting a little better."
Prekop is quick to pick out the flaws
with each album, but he's usually happy

with the overall product. About the Sea
and Cake's first album, he says, "There'll
always be stuff that bugs me about it, but
I 'm amazed that we were able to pull it off
under the circumstances. It came togeth
er so quickly and we weren't really a band.
Considering that, I think it's pretty good."
While the mere mention of "Show
boat Angel" makes Prekop groan, he does
enjoy "Jacking the Hall" — largely be
cause the repeated chorus of "we are jack
ing the ball" cracks him up in an inside
joke sort of way. "It's kind of like a fake
slogan to me — like a call to riot," he says,
pausing for an unexpectedly hearty
laugh, "in a very lackadaisical kind of way.
... That's maybe our only political tune."
Prekop's lyrics are vague and often un
intelligible to outsiders, but he maintains
that they mean something to him person
ally. "All of it is, for one reason or anoth
er, either really slight or possibly really
grand at the time," he says."I don't really
take the lyrics super lightly. They may not
mean something on face value, but I def
initely work on them.... I think the sub
ject matter comes to (the songs) after the
fact. It's not like I come up with a subject
and then write about it."
This year, all the Sea and Cake's hard
work may pay off, as "The Biz"
promises to bring them closer than
ever to the mainstream scene. In fact,
they're scheduled to appear in a Rolling
Stone feature on "bands to watch."
"I can't say I'm a really big Rolling
Stone fan," Prekop says frankly, "and I'm
slightly concerned about the other bands
they feature. I hope it's not Hootie and
the Blowflsh or something fucked up like
that... .We want to keep good company."
Of course, Prekop also hopes that
Rolling Stone doesn't resort to calling his
band a lounge band. Asked for an alter
native, Prekop thinks and says,"I don't
know. Sav we're a cafeteria band."

' M m not sure what people mean when
■ they talk about "lounge music," but
■ the Sea and Cake aren't it. Or at least
that's the word from singer / guitarist
Sam Prekop, who's been batting down
one confused classification after another
since his band debuted on the U.S. indie
scene last year.
The Sea and Cake are an inventive
group of Chicago musicians who've been
saddled with the tag "lounge"' simply be
cause their feathery pop style defies just
I about every other known musical catego
rization. The group's three albums of
sweeping, fluttering soundscapes have
earned them a healthy bit of media atten
tion, though writers are usually stuck try
ing to pin down what makes this band so
unique.
One writer from Tuba Frenzy fanzine
■ tried honorably: "The Sea and Cake cre
ate a wonderfully smooth and catchy
blend of jazz, pop, Caribbean-flavored
dance music and that unique brand of
. 'loungefunk' that Shrimp Boat (Prekop's
former band) began to make famous." It
was an ambitious and insightful attempt,
but all Prekop had to say in response was,
"Wow, that's fuckin' weird, man," in a sort
of deep, lazy amazement. Prekop was
most confused by the ( aribbean part.
"Some of it might sound exotic, I guess,
hut it's certainly not something we're set
ting out to do, like, take care of this
I (Caribbean itch we've got.
' "Right now, there's a lot of sort of not
-1 normally-rock oriented stuff going on,
you know, like Ciastr del Sol and Tor
toise," Prekop explains. "There's some
thing going on that's more experimental
based than your average rock kind of
thing, but its not lounge either."
From this class of experimental indie
bands, the Sea and Cake are the most ac
cessible of the bunch. While groups like
(iastr del Sol work to redefine the way
people think of sound and music alto-

geth-

er, the Sea and Cake just
work on new ways to deliver sweet hooks
and pleasant moods, constructing near
perfect pop songs in ways that they aren't
usually constructed.
"We're sort of experimental in not a
real die-hard way," he says."I mean, it's
not like a credo."
The Sea and Cake story begins with
the demise of Chicago cult fa
vorites Shrimp Boat. "It had been
heading in sort of a bizarre direction for a
while, and it came to a point where we de
cided to do other stuff," Prekop recalls,
adding, "1 mean bizarre as in not good.
We had peaked out or something."
Not long after Shrimp Boat fell apart,
Prekop wrote some more Shrimp Boat
ish songs and recorded them with a new
bunch of musicians, including guitarist
Archer Prewitt of the Coctails, drummer
John McKntire of Tortoise, Ciastr del Sol
and Bastro and bassist Eric Claridge, also
formerly of Shrimp Boat. The group de
cided to take its name from a (iastr del Sol
song titled "The C in Cake."
The Sea and Cake's self-titled debut
was a rushed project, but it still offered
lazy anthems like "Polio" and "Bring My
Car I Feel to Smash It" as well as friendly
pop gems like "lacking the Ball" and
"Showboat Angel." It was easy listening in
the truest sense, with an effortless flow
and atmospheric vibe providing the satis
fying cohesion that Prekop's former
group lacked.
While the Sea and Cake's first album
was warmly received, few could expect that
the band could follow it up with some
thing as dazzling as "Nassau." Released
earlier this year, "Nassau" offers a more
ambitious style, from the Stereolab-y
organ rush of "Nature Boy" to the remark

able

pop slosh of "The World

Is Against You." Altogether, "Nassau" was a
breakthrough album from a band who
many believed had already broken
through.
Now, just months later, the group re
leases their third album, "The Biz." Prob
ably the band's most straightforward
work to date, "The Biz" offers 38 minutes
of wonderfully hazy pop, stripped down
to little more than its intermingling gui
tars and rich melody. You may get some
insight into the album's sound based on
what Prekop has been listening to lately:
Stereolab, Pram, some Bjork, some '70s
Brazilian fusion and lots of jazz. Combine
some of those elements with Prekop's
own unique vision and his band's exper
tise, and it's a weird mix, but it's a mix so
pretty that it sounds perfectly natural.
Despite his band's easygoing
Rounds, Prekop himself is hard to
please when it comes to his work.
"I almost never like the albums right after
I finish them," he says plainly. "They
never quite live up to my expectations. I ll
probably always be kind of a pain in the
ass that way."
Prekop might be a pain in the ass, but
his unrealistic ambitions have produced
three great albums in less than two years,
and as long as he doesn't become satis
fied, he shows no sign of slowing down. "I
have to be doing stuff all the time, other
wise I go crazy," says Prekop, who bal
ances a painting hobby with his always
busy music career.
"The more and more I do this, it gets
harder, so I have to work harder to get to
a point where I feel like its actually getting
better," he says. "That's why I'll probably
be making albums for a long time. I feel
like only now am I getting a little better."
Prekop is quick to pick out the flaws
with each album, but he's usually happy

with the overall product. About the Sea
and Cake's first album, he says, "There'll
always be stuff that bugs me about it, but
I 'm amazed that we were able to pull it off
under the circumstances. It came togeth
er so quickly and we weren't really a band.
Considering that, I think it's pretty good."
While the mere mention of "Show
boat Angel" makes Prekop groan, he does
enjoy "Jacking the Hall" — largely be
cause the repeated chorus of "we are jack
ing the ball" cracks him up in an inside
joke sort of way. "It's kind of like a fake
slogan to me — like a call to riot," he says,
pausing for an unexpectedly hearty
laugh, "in a very lackadaisical kind of way.
... That's maybe our only political tune."
Prekop's lyrics are vague and often un
intelligible to outsiders, but he maintains
that they mean something to him person
ally. "All of it is, for one reason or anoth
er, either really slight or possibly really
grand at the time," he says."I don't really
take the lyrics super lightly. They may not
mean something on face value, but I def
initely work on them.... I think the sub
ject matter comes to (the songs) after the
fact. It's not like I come up with a subject
and then write about it."
This year, all the Sea and Cake's hard
work may pay off, as "The Biz"
promises to bring them closer than
ever to the mainstream scene. In fact,
they're scheduled to appear in a Rolling
Stone feature on "bands to watch."
"I can't say I'm a really big Rolling
Stone fan," Prekop says frankly, "and I'm
slightly concerned about the other bands
they feature. I hope it's not Hootie and
the Blowflsh or something fucked up like
that... .We want to keep good company."
Of course, Prekop also hopes that
Rolling Stone doesn't resort to calling his
band a lounge band. Asked for an alter

Stone fan," Prekop says frankly, "and I'm
slightly concerned about the other bands
they feature. I hope it's not Hootie and
the Blowflsh or something fucked up like
that... .We want to keep good company."
Of course, Prekop also hopes that
Rolling Stone doesn't resort to calling his
band a lounge band. Asked for an alter
native, Prekop thinks and says,"I don't
know. Sav we're a cafeteria band."
