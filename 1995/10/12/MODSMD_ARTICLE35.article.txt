The publicity packet calls him gutsy,
funny and reasonably sexy. He is all
that and less. This anti-article plans
to spotlight the best (and only) anti-talk
show host in the business: Dick Diet
rick. ...
Fire and Ice (Caffe with Dick)
A little too early in the morning for
Stanford reporters, Tim Stack is fin
ishing off a healthy California break
fast at San Francisco's Caffe de la Presse. In
town to promote his new show, Stack's blue
eyes are lively, showing a certain intelli
gence he expertly masks when playing Dick
Dietrick. He engages us in conversation, at
least feigning interest in two college re
porters.
The anti-host of "Night Stand with Dick
Dietrick," Timothy Stack also writes for the
show he hosts. And particularly because
Stack is not just a vapid actor who memo
rizes his lines and recites them on screen, he
succeeds fabulously.
"People want comedy on Saturday
nights — they're used to it," Stack says.

"And they want it because they haven't been
getting it."
"Night Stand" is a new syndicated late
night comedy show that is running up
against "Saturday Night Live" in a lot of
markets. A self-declared anti-talk show talk
show, it pokes fun at how seriously talk
show hosts, guest and viewers in America
approach these gab fests.
Simply because talk shows have prolifer
ated in quantity while constantly decreas
ing in quality, the idea of a spoof talk show
seems immediately appealing. But in the
town of glitz and glamour, selling a good
show can be harder than getting Pamela
Anderson to cover her chest.
Keeping It Up
Stack is affable as he tells the tale of the
show, with Co-Executive Producer
Larry Strawther dropping in neces
sary details.
"We pitched this thing all over town,"
Stack recalls. "Nobody bought it until a
friend of mine and I decided to act out a
scene — and they loved it."

"They" is Larry Lyttle, president of Big
Ticket Television, who committed for 26
episodes after watching the pitch. This
means the show should be running all sea
son.
Stack's explanation for selling the show
is surprisingly simple. "I think we just made
[Lyttle] laugh," he says.
"In fact, the question has been how to
keep [the comedy] up," Strawther adds. We
assume no pun is intended.
Fortunately, the comedy is the best part
of the show, which is as it should be. Stack
has some signature gestures, like snapping
his fingers and saying "People, noo, noo,
People" when guests laugh at a double en
tendre that poor Dick is too stupid to un
derstand. He also makes subtle tongue-in
cheek jokes which serve as cutting ridicules
of talk show hosts.
In one segment, for example, a female
guest is coming on and says,"I love your
show, Dick. In fact, I love you, Dick."
And Dick responds in his typically lost
talk show host manner, "You know, people
always tell me that and I don't know
whether to believe them or not."
"But I really mean it,"the guest insists,
eyes wide open in empty adoration.
Obviously Stack has watched his fair
share of these "sophisticated daytime fo
rums for discussion," and he's not shy about
expressing his opinion of them.
"I think they're insane," he says, rolling
his eyes with an exaggerated mocking ex
pression on his face. "It's obvious that
they've become white trash America's
chance to have their 15 minutes."
Anti-Politically Correct: Sex,
More Sex and Voice Boxes
With a name like Dick, you figure
the show would go to any
lengths to entertain its viewers.
Well, it comes really close.
"I know our show is un-PC(politicallv
correct)," Stack says. "Our take on it is that
if its self-inflicted, its fair game. ... No one
escapes our wrath."
Some future shows feature deliberately
insulting titles like "Radical Muslim Stand-
Up Comics" or "FATSOS: Meet Them,
Know Them, Chew the Fat with Them."
Nevertheless, Stack just shrugs off the PC
thing.
"My sister called me up and gave me a list
of all the things her friends had found of
fending on the show," he relates, almost
proudly. "That's O.K.
"On our spoof dating show, one of the
bachelors had a voice box but kept wanting
to smoke," he says. "We got a lot of flak for
that one. Well, if you have a voice box,
DON'T SMOKE — you were told not to."
Many of the shows signature lines con-

tain infinite sex
ual innuendoes.
Strawther jokes
that the line that
sold the show
was, "If you
don't have
'Night Stand,'
you don't have
Dick."
Stack argues,
convincingly
enough, that
"Night Stand" 's
focus on sex
comes naturally
because of the
nature of the
show — it imi
tates its victims.
Just to tease you,
the following are
some segment
titles the show
dares to explore:
"Sexaholics: The
Problem, The
Cure and Where
to Meet Them,"
and "A Look at
Lesbians: Their
Politics, Their
History, but

Mostly How They Do It."
"We're just trying to parallel the tall
shows, because no matter what subjec
they're doing, they somehow get to sex,
Stack says. "That's what people want, and i
you think about it, it's the same in real life.
Night Stands and Other Bedroorr
Furniture
The name of the show, "Night Stand,
was more of a reference to somethin
that is next to a bed than anvthin
else," Strawther says."It was also a referenc
to taking a stand on something."
Other talk show hosts don't just stain
there, Dick is after you. And in the world o
talk show fame, Dick has not yet met th
queen of the genre, Oprah. But Jerr
Springer is going to be on the show soon
Stack is visibly excited about the god of tall
shows' future appearance.
"You know, Dick is the only man ii
America who aspires to be Jerry Springer,
Stack says, laughing wryly. "Jerry and I ar
going to do a show exploring whether tali
shows have gotten out of control." Even
self-referential spoof. Classic.
But being a spoof of bad television show
doesn't mean creating the show is easy.
"We have to be clever," Strawther says.
"Talk shows just bring people on am
they scream and yell at each other and that'

jit," Stack says,
gesticulating
wildly in the
manner of bad
talk show guests.
Stack isn't even
sure whether the
guests on normal
talk shows are
real people.
"Night Stand"
uses a cast of ac
tors as the guests
to the show, and
has them play re
markably insipid
characters.
"On real talk
shows, there are
these solicita
tions for guests
and some people
just go on the
show to get the
free limo ride,"
Stack says.
"And the
chance to sleep
in a Sheraton,"
Strawther quips.
"Kato Kaelin
i wanted to be on
our show, but we
.J L I "

passed on him,
Stack remembers. "We require an ability to
act."
Well, O.J. invariably had to come up. In
celebration (or mourning) of the O.J.
Simpson trial, the show ran a mock trial of
a gay man, complete with him trying on the
condom in the courtroom to see if it would
fit.
"The condom didn't fit," Stack says.
"And everyone had published books with
titles like 'I Flate Juror No. 2' by Juror No.
□ickheads and Webheads
Apparently the spoof talk show idea is
a popular one, because just in its first
two months, "Night Stand" has
come close to "Saturday Night Live' 's rat
ings in competing markets. But according
to Strawther, it's not a competition. Inter
estingly enough, "Night Stand" 's numbers
actually go up in markets where "SNL" is on
at the same time.
"It's because once people are watching
television, they change channels a lot, find
us and keep watching," Strawther explains.
Certain markets are more successful
than others. "We do really well in Houston,
so I've thought about coming on in a 10-
gallon yarmulke," Stack jokes.
A significant number of "Night Stand" 's
audience are men and women between the

ages of 18 and 34, a group which includes
many college students. "College students
are the real core of our viewers, Stack says.
"And slowly, this group is developing into
devout 'Night Stand' fans, and they are, for
tunately or unfortunately, Dickheads."
Despite all the crude jokes, Stack and
Strawther consider the excellent writing
the main draw for viewers of the show.
"We have so much fun writing this
thing. I think that comes across," Stack says.
"It's not just shock humor. We try to be
clever. The writing room is a frat room with
the worst kids you knew in junior high."
Stack's credits as a writer include the
ABC series "On Our Own," and he has also
written for "Saturday Night Live" and sev
eral MTV specials. He has appeared in the
movies "Back to School" and "Blind Date,'
as well as the television shows "Reggie,"
"Our Time" and "Parker Lewis Can't Lose."
"I've found that the fun part, especially
about this show, is writing," Stack says.
"For years, I wanted to be an actor, and only
when I walked away from it did I realize
how rewarding the writing is."

Writing in cyberspace is also a part of the
show. The late night comedy show is trying
to increase its appeal by offering a web
page. The home page gloats, "The first web
page with its own talk show!"
"Yeah, I guess we're like the first spoof of
a web site," Stack says. "People who are
webheads like our show because they...
can go to the web and be entertained."
The "Manly Man's" page and the "Soci
ety for the Proliferation of Blinking Text"
are highly recommended. You can even buy
a pillow case which encourages you to
"Spend the night with Dick."
The Anti-Actor
Stack's approachability and affable
manner almost make him an anti
actor, though saying that could be
ironic — maybe he's just very good at play
ing the anti-actor....
But don't let that bother you. The show
keeps you laughing, and Stack is comfort
able and benignly sarcastic in his role. Nev
ertheless, being the host of his own TV
show has certainly changed his home lite.

"Well, my wife likes the fact that I'm
working," he jokes. "And my kids like to
brag about their dad having a TV show.
"Unfortunately, my 5 year old also walks
around saying, 'My dad's DICK,"' Stack
says, giving a perfect impression of an in
nocent little boy too proud of his father.
"But then again, my son also can't wait to
cut a fart, and my daughter just goes 'Oh,
please.' " He rolls his eyes, imitating his lit
tle girl, and everyone at the table giggles.
Stack says that "if somebody is having a
difficult time, comedy can be used to make
people feel better." The comedy shows that
bring Stack up when he's down include
"Mystery Science Theater 3000," "Frasier"
and "Seinfeld."
"1 would love to develop the kind of loyal
following that 'Seinfeld' has," Stack admits.
"But you're not dating teenage women,"
Strawther jokes.
"No, but we're setting that up right
now," quips his publicist.
Don't everyone grab for your phone
now. The reasonably sexy Stack is married.
With children.
