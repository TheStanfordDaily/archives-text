## HOLE Ask For It 
### 
Hotrodding her way through a traffic jam
of rock-star pathos, chipping paint, leaking
credibility like Pennzoil, Courtney Love's got
to keep leaning on her horn for anyone to pay
any attention to her. She's had her wreck, her
system's fucked and any minute she's going to
seize up, grind to a halt and just die. As sym
pathy from the crowd dwindles, as her ra\
aged features come clear into the light,
synapses must be firing, schemes must be
formulating, lessons of history echoing in
her skull. Reinvent yourself. Take a minute,
wait for the lights to dim and go off and take
five or 10.
Main stage glamour at Lollapalooza in
flated Love's already overblown sense of self,
and her 10-minute intersong narratives
numbed the muddy assembly into edgy an
tagonism. Her profane whinings, her bad
girl hysterics won her scorn. "Flay the song
bitch," sang the hecklers.
Unfortunately, the Lollapalooza show of
fered nothing new. "Live Through This" de
livered with ecstatic anxiety 12 of the best
songs of 1994, each loaded with adrenaline,
each elegantly prescient of coming catastro
phe. And while they still resonate, outrun
ning the current mainstream by a mile or so,
they are almost two years old. Gossipy sound
bites promise a new full length sometime this
year, but the prospects seem dim.
"Ask For it" s 18 minutes of back-cata
logue detritus not only reaffirms Hole's in
ability to write new songs, but it also man
ages to cast a sheen of mediocrity across last
year's work. The Feel Sessioned "Doll Parts"
and "Violet" offer bland revisionism, and if
there's a difference between this "Drown
Soda" and the one on the "Tank Girl" sound
track, I haven't found it. What kills me is that

these songs were recorded in 1991. Four years
later, Hole is still spinning around the
shrieks, howls and growls of yesteryear.
An oppressively turgid version of "Pale
Flue Fves" lends an aura of absurdity to the
whole project. And then there's the cover art
— razor-bladed wrists side by side across
bathroom tiling. The palms cup upwards in
supplication while the half-healed slits puck
er like creased lips. Emblazoned across the
back, small but nonetheless obtrusive, are the
words: "Cover concept by Courtney Love."
It's as if she knows what she's going through
- she's holding out her wounds for display
and she wants us all to see what she's not
making out of her distress. It's defiance in in
action. It's a demolition derby in broad day
light, wreckage in high relief.
