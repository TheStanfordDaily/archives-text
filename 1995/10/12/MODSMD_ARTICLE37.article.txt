# BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE
## F-Punk 
### 
Mick Jones' Big Audio Dynamite, formed
after his split with the Clash, has spent years
proving that old punks don't die, they just
fade away.
While the Clash created perhaps the most
brilliant and eclectic music from the punk
movement of the late-'7os, Jones' post-Clash
work has been spotty. The formation of Big
Audio Dynamite, Jones' attempt to inter
mingle electronic dance music and guitar
driven rock and roll, was an extremely ambi
tious move, but as a member of the Clash,
Jones was used to such a risk.
What made the Clash so remarkable was
that the band was somehow able to achieve
its immense musical reach, trying everything
from rockabilly to reggae. Big Audio Dyna
mite comes across like a beautifully prepared
but half-cooked meal, enticing because one is
aware of what could have been accom
plished.

Big Audio Dynamite's latest album, "F-
Punk," continues the group's painful trend.
The album wants to become a classic; the
cover simultaneously refers to Elvis, George
Clinton and the Clash's seminal work, "Lon
don Calling." Indeed, like "London Calling,"
"F-Punk" includes an unlisted track, David
Bowie's "Suffragette City." However, the
album lacks the guiding focus it would need
to meet its pretensions.
In general, the tracks are far too long, av
eraging over five minutes each, and too many
spiral off into confusion. Even Jones' vocals
are a problem because, although his music
no longer could be called "punk," his singing
has barely changed from the Clash's debut.
While the style worked perfectly in 1977 for
"White Riot," it is far too casual and blurred
for tracks like "What About Love?" from "F-
Punk."
Nevertheless, just as Big Audio Dynamite
disappoints, it also enthralls, as a number of
tracks match Jones' vision perfectly. "Push
Those Blues Away" splices a perfect rock
groove onto tasty electronic effects, creating
the album's strongest track. "Vitamin C"
can't help but please with its far-too-catchy
chorus. The rhythms of "It's a Jungle Out
There" push its backbeat to levels of com
plexity rarely before reached.
Thus, the album has some truly impres
sive moments. Perhaps Mick Jones' worst
problem is that his work will forever be com
pared with the redoubtable Clash, which
reached levels no one should ever be expect
ed to achieve.
