## Full Size Boy 
### 
Most British entertainers are grim and
proper, flashing their pretentious "Hugh
Grant innocence" to the audience. Fortu
nately, Bivouac drop the aristocratic facade
and become true to their humble Derby ori
gins by spewing forth with gutsy, genuine
rock on their latest full-leneth album, "Full

Size Boy."
In most songs, vocalist Paul Yeardon con
veys a sense of the alternative-rock scene
popularized by legends Nirvana and Smash
ing Pumpkins. Although his vocals usually
come crashing down as one raucous wail,
Yeardon portrays his vocal flexibility with
deft, soft passages. This talent is particularly
useful for the band, leaving the listener on the
edge of their scat, never knowing what might
happen next. On "Not Going Back There
Again," Bivouac revels with utmost gaiety.
Meanwhile, on "Trepanning," Yeardon's
brooding vocals, in conjunction with the
band's riveting guitar and drums, pour out
pure apocalyptic dread.
Although Yeardon's vocals are notewor
thy, it is his abrasive but intuitive guitars
which speak louder than the words them
selves. The unrelenting riffs and dynamics
give an aural high. Taking a cue from Metal
lica and Guns 'N Roses, Bivouac pepper their
songs with captivating instrumental solos,
pouring out tranquilizing dirges which are
often nonexistent in more popular alterna
tive rock songs.
Selections like "Thinking," Bivouac's first
single, guarantee a strong following. "Taking
it all / you learn as you crawl / get the fuck
away / check it all / you learn as you
fall / learn as you hurt /1 learn as I pain"
characterizes the familiar motif of teenage
angst usually ascribed to Generation Xers.
"Full Size Boy" definitely sets a new
benchmark for British rock with its new
compelling sound. Bivouac's ability to lull
the audience with soulful lyrics and grinding
guitars will make them a hit in the alternative
rock crowd.
