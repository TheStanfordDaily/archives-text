## Superball + 
### 
When asked to describe what her music
sounds like, Helium singer / guitarist /
everything Mary Timony says it's intended to
be folk music done up with distorted instru-

ments — though she's sure that's not what
she or anyone else hears in it. Which might
the best way to characterize Timony's grip
ping songs — that they aren't just one thing
or another, but so much more.
On the "Superball • " IP, 1 lelium expands
on the themes ol disillusion and despair the
band so thrilling!) explored and conquered
on its debut album "The Dirt of Luck."
( tilled from the glorious full-length, the title
track sets a tone to be enlarged: It is a har
rowing two-minute ditty that cuts through
the anxieties ol feeling inconsequential with a
cheeky circus-like guitar refrain and mouth
fuls of I imony's sharp words. When Timony
exhorts in the chorus, "I'm small / like a su
perball / throw me at the wall, she comes
back fiercer, "mad as hell" and not so "frag
ile" as she croons.
More than throwawav outtakes, the new
cuts on the record play off then run with the
engrossing vibe established in "Superball,"
making the short offering a surprisingly co
hesive effort. "Lucky (iharm" is the aural an
tidote to "Superball," the former smooth and
delicate as opposed to the bounding and
pounding of the latter. Still, the two come to
gether as "Lucky (lharm" tails away in a post
script that crosses a snippet of "Superball " \
carnival music with its own classical over
tones and electronic flavorings. The obsessive
"What Institution Are Vou I rom'r" combines
a zippy, danceable groove with Timony's
strained singing and he; >ff-kr!ter guitar
musings. Voice samples masked with static
add depth to the soundscape, which gets big
ger and more insidious when the bass and
guitar rumblings grow as the piece runs out.
With the closer "I Am a Witch," Timony
strips down the arrangements, going it alone
with her guitar and thin voice. The private
moment becomes a statement that trans
gresses itself: "And I'll never leave you
alone / Until you admit how big I've
grown / Did I tell you I'm not your bitch 011
loan / I'm a witch, an ugly hag / A crone," so
Timony sings before digging into an omi
nous riff. In its lyrics and its presentation, the
song, like the band, subverts am expecta
tions, connected but never limited.
