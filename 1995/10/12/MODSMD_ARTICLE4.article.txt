# Coping with California's shiny, happy people
## 
### Zachary Thacher 
For more than a thousand stu
dents, attending Stanford can be a
geographical odyssey landing
them in a new, and sometimes
heavily idiosyncratic, environ
ment.
The West Coast, as many ac
knowledge, is a special place. Cali
fornia is the homeland to hippies,
yippies, hard line Orange County
Republicans and tree hugging
Humboldt county leftists. It pro
duces more films and television
shows than New York ever made
and leads the country in its break
neck race for cultural trends and
high technology — never mind ul
timate frisbee.
This can be a lot to handle for
students from the East Coast, a re
gion associated with thick winter
coats, sweltering summers and
the deep resonances of tradition.
Some areas are characterized by a
certain sense of reserve. Or rude
ness.
Keiko Morris, a first-year grad
uate student from Brooklyn, de
scribed her attempts to get direc
tions for a store when in New
York: "I walk into a shop and
they're like 'you're in the wrong
store lady.' " In California it's a
different story, she said.
"Here people are so happy to

give you information. They talk
to you on the street and ask you
questions about yourself. It's
like they have extra teeth," she
said and broke into a big grin.
But the differences can be isolat

ing as well.
"It's different, it really is," said
Chitra Deshpande of her three
years in California. She is a senior
Russian history major from
South Orange, N-J, who can only

afford to fly home twice a year
California, she said, is an "isolat
ed, unreal world full of happy peo
pie."

Keiko Morris and Athima Chansanchaia. both first year graduate students, discuss their transition
from the East to West Coast.
The transition from the "grit"
of the New York region, as she
described it, can take some getting
used to.
"I really rniss the seasons," she
said. While leaves are turning to
radiant, funereal colors in New
England, tanning season is in full

effect in Northern California.
The disparities within t in state
can also be an eye-opener for stu
dents new to this school and cli
mate. Athima Chansanchaia, a
first year graduate student from
Florida, said she found some major
differences between the glitz down
south and Northern California.
"I/.A. might as well be a differ
ent count ry compared to San Fran
cisco," she said When Chansan
chaia was looking at graduate pro

grams in Los Angeles last Novem
lx>r, she had a startling cultural
insight when visiting one of the
city's more prestigious schools:
"USC is like 90210," she said.
There is no fair way to general
ize clothing styles for the entire
state of California: there are too
many genres at play in this cultur
ally fecund region. Hut some stu
dents from the East Coast
observed that Stanford has, to a
limited extent, its own stvle.

It's more casual in Northern
California, noted Chansanchaia.
Deshpande concurred. She said
that she only wears her "drawers
clothing" at Stanford rather than
dressing up in her nicer "hanging
clothing" that she once sported
when in Oxford for a year abroad.
They wear less, the women said
of Stanford students, and they
work out more. Everybody is super
health-oriented, Chansanchaia
said. Both she and Morris smoke

and the latter said she's hoping
that California's health conscious
ness will rub off on her. "I'd like to
stop smoking," said Morris.
At the same time, smoking,
talking and madly gesticulating
with a cigarette between your fin
gers is a definite give-away of an
East Coast student. And it's ques
tionable just how much the West
('oast will affect Morris.
"I consider myself pretty East
Coast," Chansanchaia said. "I feel

like I have a certain edge coming
from there."
Deshpande agreed that Califor
nians are less edgy or high-strung
than people back East. She said
that when she arrived to Stanford
three years ago as a freshman she
asked herself, "Are you people for
real?"
"I was rather distrustful of
these happy people," she said.
"People in New York are more
stressed, more rushed."

The West Coast, as many ac
knowledge, is a special place. Cali
fornia is the homeland to hippies,
yippies, hard line Orange County
Republicans and tree hugging
Humboldt county leftists. It pro
duces more films and television
shows than New York ever made
and leads the country in its break
neck race for cultural trends and
high technology — never mind ul
timate frisbee.
This can be a lot to handle for
students from the East Coast, a re
gion associated with thick winter
coats, sweltering summers and
the deep resonances of tradition.
Some areas are characterized by a
certain sense of reserve. Or rude
ness.
Keiko Morris, a first-year grad
uate student from Brooklyn, de
scribed her attempts to get direc
tions for a store when in New
York: "I walk into a shop and
they're like 'you're in the wrong
store lady.' " In California it's a
different story, she said.
"Here people are so happy to

give you information. They talk
to you on the street and ask you
questions about yourself. It's
like they have extra teeth," she
said and broke into a big grin.
But the differences can be isolat

ing as well.
"It's different, it really is," said
Chitra Deshpande of her three
years in California. She is a senior
Russian history major from
South Orange, N-J, who can only

afford to fly home twice a year
California, she said, is an "isolat
ed, unreal world full of happy peo
pie."

Keiko Morris and Athima Chansanchaia. both first year graduate students, discuss their transition
from the East to West Coast.
The transition from the "grit"
of the New York region, as she
described it, can take some getting
used to.
"I really rniss the seasons," she
said. While leaves are turning to
radiant, funereal colors in New
England, tanning season is in full

effect in Northern California.
The disparities within t in state
can also be an eye-opener for stu
dents new to this school and cli
mate. Athima Chansanchaia, a
first year graduate student from
Florida, said she found some major
differences between the glitz down
south and Northern California.
"I/.A. might as well be a differ
ent count ry compared to San Fran
cisco," she said When Chansan
chaia was looking at graduate pro

grams in Los Angeles last Novem
lx>r, she had a startling cultural
insight when visiting one of the
city's more prestigious schools:
"USC is like 90210," she said.
There is no fair way to general
ize clothing styles for the entire
state of California: there are too
many genres at play in this cultur
ally fecund region. Hut some stu
dents from the East Coast
observed that Stanford has, to a
limited extent, its own stvle.

It's more casual in Northern
California, noted Chansanchaia.
Deshpande concurred. She said
that she only wears her "drawers
clothing" at Stanford rather than
dressing up in her nicer "hanging
clothing" that she once sported
when in Oxford for a year abroad.
They wear less, the women said
of Stanford students, and they
work out more. Everybody is super
health-oriented, Chansanchaia
said. Both she and Morris smoke

and the latter said she's hoping
that California's health conscious
ness will rub off on her. "I'd like to
stop smoking," said Morris.
At the same time, smoking,
talking and madly gesticulating
with a cigarette between your fin
gers is a definite give-away of an
East Coast student. And it's ques
tionable just how much the West
('oast will affect Morris.
"I consider myself pretty East
Coast," Chansanchaia said. "I feel

like I have a certain edge coming
from there."
Deshpande agreed that Califor
nians are less edgy or high-strung
than people back East. She said
that when she arrived to Stanford
three years ago as a freshman she
asked herself, "Are you people for
real?"
"I was rather distrustful of
these happy people," she said.
"People in New York are more
stressed, more rushed."
