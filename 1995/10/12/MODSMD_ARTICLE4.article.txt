# Coping with California's shiny, happy people
## 
### Zachary Thacher 
For more than a thousand stu
dents, attending Stanford can be a
geographical odyssey landing
them in a new, and sometimes
heavily idiosyncratic, environ
ment.
The West Coast, as many ac
knowledge, is a special place. Cali
fornia is the homeland to hippies,
yippies, hard line Orange County
Republicans and tree hugging
Humboldt county leftists. It pro
duces more films and television
shows than New York ever made
and leads the country in its break
neck race for cultural trends and
high technology â€” never mind ul
timate frisbee.
This can be a lot to handle for
students from the East Coast, a re
gion associated with thick winter
coats, sweltering summers and
the deep resonances of tradition.
Some areas are characterized by a
certain sense of reserve. Or rude
ness.
Keiko Morris, a first-year grad
uate student from Brooklyn, de
scribed her attempts to get direc
tions for a store when in New
York: "I walk into a shop and
they're like 'you're in the wrong
store lady.' " In California it's a
different story, she said.
"Here people are so happy to

give you information. They talk
to you on the street and ask you
questions about yourself. It's
like they have extra teeth," she
said and broke into a big grin.
But the differences can be isolat

ing as well.
"It's different, it really is," said
Chitra Deshpande of her three
years in California. She is a senior
Russian history major from
South Orange, N-J, who can only

afford to fly home twice a year
California, she said, is an "isolat
ed, unreal world full of happy peo
pie."
