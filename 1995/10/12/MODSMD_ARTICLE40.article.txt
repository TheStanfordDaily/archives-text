# PET SHOP BOYS
## Alternative 
### 
The release ol "Alternative" marks Neil
lennant and ( hris Lowe's l()th anniversary
.is the Pet Shop Boys. "Alternative* is a re
markable compilation of FSB's b-sides,
chronicling then progression over the past
decade as the premiere svnth-pop group
from England. The duo has certainly come a
long way since the days ol "West I nd Oirls."
Fen years and eight albums later, the music of
the Pet Shop Boys remains refreshingly
unique.
I his double-disc set reveals a more honest
and personal side of PSB. Neil writes much
more autobiographically, at the same time
combining his knowledge of socialist history
with intelligent lyricism. The stor\ lines span
a wide range ol topics, moving from World
War II Xazotis in the song "In the Night
(previously released 011 "Disco") to youth au
thority figures in "Hey, Headmaster" (b-side
to "(lan Vou Forgive Her"). 1 he latter follows
in the footsteps ol "It's a Sin" in satirizing
Neil s formal upbringing in a (iatholic board
ing school: "Disintegration of the football
team / No one seems to want to play for real /
In the classroom, club or pool / Hey, Head
master, what are you going to do?"
Many of the songs seem almost experi
mental. Chris, the all-too-often silent half of
the Pet Shop Boys, even expresses himself vo
cally on a few of the tracks. I ie ironically takes
this step forward in the song "We All Feel Bet
ter in the Dark." In "One of the Crowd," he
sings, "Don't want anyone to know my
name / Don't want to get a fax / Don't want
10 meet the Royal family/Just cause I've
paid my tax." PSB's keyboard work is also a
bit 112 reer on their b sides. Many of the songs
011 "Alternative," like "The Sound of the
Atom Splitting," show an explorative and, in
some ways, more creative side of the group.
Vou definitely won't find the polished se
quences offered on other PSB albums. "Alter
native" is in no way meant to be another
"Discography. Rather, it is a comprehensive
look at an often unseen, but perhaps more

natural and genuine side of the Pet Shop
Boys.
