## GRATEFUL DEAD Hundred Year Hall 
### 
April 26, 1975. Nixon is still President.
Germany is divided. The Dead are playing a
show in Irankfurt, Germany. The venue:
I hundred Year I lall. The lineup includes (iar
cia, kreut/mann, I.esh, Weir, organist Ron
Mckernan (drinking through the last year of
his life) and the Godchauxs, the couple
whose name I can never remember when I
think of the Dead.
A two-record set of this show has just been
released, and there are two main reasons why
"Hundred Year Hall" is worth hearing. I irst,
it is a good indication of how a show sound
ed back in the early 70s. Second, it contains a
phenomenal jam on the second album.
The first record begins with a decent ren
dition of their unrenowned original
"Bertha." 1 hey then play a tew covers, includ
ing their favorites "I know You Rider" and
"Me and My I ncle.' The songs are good but
unremarkable. It is interesting, however, that
they play these songs with more confidence
than their own. Considering that "Aoxo
moxoa was only three years old and "Work
ingman's Dead" and "American beauty" only
two, it's not surprising that songs they had
been playing as the Warlocks and Mother
McGree's Uptown |ug< hamps and through
out th isical history would be more solid
and together than those they had iust written.
The other originals on the first album,
"Jack Straw, "One More Saturdav Night,'
"( hina ( at' and particularly "Playing in the
Band,' reveal how this fairly young (for the
Dead) group matured into master improvis
ers. Two blues songs in the mix gi\e the set a
representation of the emotional side of the

Dead not always obvious at a show.
The second album contains the real gem.
"Truckin " rolls on over missed cues and ob
vious blunders to give a glorious 18-minute
sonic sense of an unhurried, yet tense stroll
through a dark and demanding west German
forest. The Dead then totally get it together
and show no limitations. "The Other One" is
begun and abandoned for a 37-minute jam,
"Encryptical Envelopment." This master
piece of expression should not be missed by
any fan, however casual, ol the 1 )ead. "(Monies
a Time" and "Sugar Magnolia" are both rock
ing, but they should be heard more as a re
lease or cool down after the previous creative
outburst.
I )ead on compact disi. is seen as anathema
by many 'Heads. If you believe this, and do
not have a copy of this show, then at least lis
ten to a copy owned by a faux-l lead. It is like
ly that it will be easy to find someone who has
bought it.
