## To Die For 
### 
Jacques
t Cousteau
once said

that in the sea, the most beautiful creatures
can often he the most dangerous.
In the sea ot television media, Suzanne
Stone ranks as the jjreat white shark bent on
landing her face on the screens of every I V
in America. Indeed, her passion for fame
on the tube is "To Die For."
Stone, played by Nicole Kidman, is a
study in paradox. 1 iving in the idyllic town
ship of Little Hope, New Hampshire, she
presents herself as a saccharine sweet, bub
ble-headed bimbo that looks and sounds
like she just stepped out of the stereotypical
sorority house.
But under that placid lake of perkinesso'
plenty lies a woman obsessed with becom
ing a media personality. She will let noth
ing, not even her naive but lovable hus
band, Larry Maretto (Mall Dillon), stand
in the way of her achieving the pinnacle of
American success — being on TV.
The movie is loosely based on the true
story of Pamela Smart, a schoolteacher who
plotted to have her husband killed because
she'd lose everything in a divorce — includ
ing the dog.
Like Smart, Stone realizes that by knock
ing off her hubby, she gets to keep the car,
thecondo, the insurance — and"the damn
furball coughed up by a demon straight
from the heart of hell." To do this, she men
tallv seduces a Ik-avis and butthcad trio

played by
loaq u i n
Phoe n ix
(brother of
the Ia t e
River),
Casey Af
fleck and
Alison Hol
land.
Sex
starved
Phoe n ix
plays the
role of wit
less loser to
the hilt. IJe
beco m e s
the unwit
ting pawn,

but very
willing sexual prisoner, to Stone. Hey, what
teenager wouldn't enjoy having, urn, inti
mate counseling sessions with Nicole Kid
man?
Kidman shows incredible depth as an ac
tress. She is able to change, convincingly,
from delightfully charming to a four letter
word starting with (for cold) in six sec
onds flat. I ler ruthlessness is completely be
lievable to the point where you wonder it
she is not acting from experience.
Director Clus Van Sant ("My Own l'ri
vate Idaho," "Drugstore Cowboy") made
"To Die l or" a black comedy showing the
ridiculous way the media creates sensa

tions. The entire movie revolves around a
set of flashbacks showing Stone ruthlessly
pushing toward her goal that culminates in
her achieving, literally craving, the spot
light that plagues O.J. Simpson.
Perhaps the most telling line in the
movie is Stone's, "You aren't really anyone
in America if you're not on TV. 'Cause
what's the point of doing anything worth
while if nobody is watching?"
Point is, Kidman is svelte and her acting
intense. We say get a bunch of friends and
see it. Make sure you get someone to go
with you — after all, you wouldn't want to
be seen going ALONF would you?
