# The 						Run of the Country
## 
### 
1 he latest in .1 string of Irish movies playing
in arts\ American theaters including "( irele
ol Friends" and"In the Name of the Father,"
"The Run of the (Country" provides plenty of
Irish charm hut overdoses 011 the melodrama.
A heart attack, a gory machinery accident, a
dramatic miscarriage and a tar and feather
ing are all packed into a two hour span not
meant to accommodate so much drama.
The film chronicles 18-year-old Danny's
(Matt keeslar) return to his native rural Ire
land after high school abroad. While comfort
ed bv his loving mother, 1 )anny feels pressured

by his overbearing police-chief father (Albert
I inney) to attend college 111 America and
"make something of himself." Although
Danny's insecurities hold him back from
making a college decision, he ironically expe
riences the major rites of adulthood during
this period.
Once the basic story is set up, the film zips
from incident to incident. ( arousing with his
old friend Prunty (Anthony Brophy), Danny
takes his first drink and promptly finds him
self 111 the middle of a bar brawl. He is then
propositioned for sex, exchanges blows with
his father, witnesses the death of his mother,
goes bungee jumping and then falls in love all
before the movie's midpoint.
In between dramatic episodes, the film
provides .1 large dose of wit, mostly from
Prunty, an uninhibited, fun (and woman )
loving working man. Things turn serious,

however, when Danny and his girlfriend An
nagh (Victora Smurfit) learn she's pregnant
and must face their families' disapproval and
bitterness. The movie's resolution under
scores the importance of blood ties, especial
ly among the Irish. Unfortunately, it takes an
enormous amount of loss for Danny to grow
to the point where he's able to decide about
his future.
"The Run of the Country" captures a slice
of life in rural Ireland and aptly illustrates
both the joy and frustrations of the villagers.
Due to Keeslar's at times flat performance,
however, it becomes difficult to empathize
with Danny's situation despite all the trau
ma. Fewer life-altering events and more
character development would have bolstered
a film perfect for those in the mood for Irish
drama.
