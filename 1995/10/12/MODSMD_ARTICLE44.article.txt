# Moonlight and Valentino
## 
### 
Director David Anspaugh crcatcs the per
fect blend of friendship, sisterhood, humor
and tragedy in his new film "Moonlight and
Valentino." Though at first glance it seems to
he a "chick flick" blend of "Steel Magnolias"
and "Hoys on the Side," Ellen Simon's screen
play offers many original takes on the bond of
female friendship.
Widowed within the first five minutes of
the movie, Elizabeth Perkins' Rebecca grieves
with the help of her best friend Sylvie

(Whoopi Goldberg), her sister Lucy
(Ciwyneth Pa I trow) and her father's ex-wife
Alberta (Kathleen Turner). Intertwined with
Rebecca's grieving process are numerous
subplots: Sylvie's failing marriage, Lucy's
budding romance and Alberta's troubles with
Lucy. I lowever, frank displays and meaning
ful discussions of emotions drive "Moonlight
and Valentino" more than the plot.
Perkins is a disturbingly real widow. From
the first time that she hears her husband's
voice on the answering machine to her note
to God that she plants with a bulb in her gar
den, her performance reveals the guilt and
grief of Rebecca. Paltrow is also superb as the
stubborn and rebellious Lucy. The scenes be
tween the sisters are touching as they discuss
everything openly from tattoos and sex to

their childhood and mother's death.
Amidst the pain of Rebecca's situation, the
movie leaves the audience chuckling in parts.
The source of many laughs and the biggest
surprise of the movie is Jon Bon Jovi's magi
cal cameo as a house painter. His blue eyes
mirror his character's soul while his gentle
ness and knowing glances draw Rebecca out
of seclusion, without their relationship seem
ing like a betrayal. Hon |ovi is not DeNiro, but
he may have found a second career.
This is a perfect movie to see with a sis
ter, mother or a group of friends, and its
charm comes from the excellence of the per
formances. If you're in the mood for a good
cry, bring a handkerchief to "Moonlight and
Valentino."
