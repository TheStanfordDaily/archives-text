# Assassins
## 
### 
Even Antonio Banderas could not make
"Assassins" a worthwhile trip to the movies.
No, the sexy Antonio Banderas, hot after
flicks like "Interview With the Vampire" and
"Desperado" does not kiss a single person in
this movie. Instead he plays the obsessed,
somewhat psychotic Miguel Bain, an assassin
competing with Sylvester Stallone's charac
ter, Robert Rath, the No. 1 assassin around.
Both are unknowingly working for the same
boss who gives them assignments by com
puter to kill certain wealthy or well-informed
people.
Needless to say, a woman complicates the
competition. Julianne Moore plays Electra, a
surveillance expert with a valuable disk of in
formation and a fondness for cats. Both as
sassins are assigned to kill her but Stallone
gets to her first and decides to keep her alive.
Stallone and Moore fall in love and then there
is the final showdown between the two assas
sins to see who's No. 1.
Along with the predictable plot is a group
of predictable characters. Stallone plays the
sullen-faced assassin haunted by one of the
killings he committed, but he supposedly has
a heart because he won't kill anyone who is
innocent.
Stallone could have given his character a
little more personality if he had moved his fa
cial features every now and then instead of
hulking around with a Terminator-1 ike ex
pression on his face.
Banderas must have thought that he could
pass off characterization by keeping his hair
in his eyes and talking and swearing to him
self. He plays off his character in a tradition
al, bad-guy fashion.
Moore accomplishes the most convincing
acting as thecatwomanish lady who also hap
pens to be a genius. Even though she has
some clever moments, Electra is still the
weakling female caught playing in a man's
world.
Unoriginal dialogue does nothing to help
the actors. Whenever Stallone and Banderas
have a scene together there is no sense of any
kind of dynamic between the two. Their con
versations are boring and resemble chit-chat
something Banderas' character actually
points out. Stallone and Moore do not do any
better.
This film does have smooth camera work
and nicely toned colors. However, with the
exception of one highly implausible stunt,
the action is unimpressive.
Actually, the most visually striking thing
about this movie is that it feels like a com
mercial for Apple Powerbooks because in
every other scene, one of the characters is
using one.
Richard Donner directed this picture at a
very uneven pace, not giving you a chance to
get excited or feel relieved about anything —
perhaps an effort to resemble the chess game
Stallone plays physically against his comput
er and figuratively against Banderas.
In between scenes of unimpressive action
are long periods of the camera focused on
Stallone's stony face and grainy, black-and
white flashback sequences. Watching a chess
game is not very exciting — the same goes for
watching this movie.
