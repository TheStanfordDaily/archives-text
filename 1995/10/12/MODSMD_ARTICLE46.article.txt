## Dead Presidents 
### 
"Dead Presidents" has a
little of everything: a lit-

tle action, a little romance, very little acting,
very litte directing and virtually no plot. The
Hughes brothers ("Menace II Society") bring
us this trite story about the coming-of-age of a
young black man named Anthony played by
LarenzTate ("Menace").
The first act of the movie is about Anthony
losing his virginity, graduating from high
school and then deciding he wants to join the
Marines instead of going to college because he
desires to "do something different."
The second act is Anthony serving in the
Vietnam War, where he experiences every single
rehashed, cliched War 1 lero Scene: he watches
friends die, mourns the lack of letters from his
girlfriend and questions the point of it all.
For the third act, Anthony goes back home
to the Bronx and realizes he must support his
girlfriend as well as the child he spawned be
fore he left for the war. Desperate for money,
he and his buddies plot to rob an armored car
that carries out-of-circulation currency.
The acting in this film is negligible, with
the exception ot N'bushe Wright ("Panther"),
who plays Anthony's girlfriend's shy sister in
the first act. She grows up to be a member of
the Panther Party in the third act and gets
killed during their heist.
Skip, Anthony's best buddy and the most an

noying character in the film, says almost noth
ing but "this motherfuckin' shit and that moth
erfuckin' shit." And every time (Ihris Tucker de
livers one of these lines they sound exactly like
the way George Jefferson used to throw .1 fit.
Tate plays every emotion that isn't happy or
angry as desperately pensive. 1 le always looks
like he has something really deep on his mind,
but he never gives a hint of what it is. It's as if
he's contemplating a test pattern.
The violence in certain scenes of this film is
inexcusable. While in Vietnam, Anthonys
sergeant head-butts a Vietnamese man until
every orifice in his head bleeds profusely. Also,

a fellow black soldier takes the head of a dead
Vietnamese soldier, saying, "I'm collecting me
a souvenir." Violence in depicting the Vietnam
War is completely justified in a film about the
Vietnam War — this film, though, is not about
the Vietnam War.
This film is really about dressing up in peri
od clothing and playing music from the '60s
and '70s. And although it looks like the'6os, the
film had its share of minor inconsistencies. I
wasn't there, but I'm fairly sure brothers
weren't calling each other "Homey" in the'6os.
Basically, "Dead Presidents" wants to be like
"Forrest C lump" by taking us through the life of

a young mail who experiences a lot of signifi
cant events in American history. But it also
wants to be like "Menace II Society" and depict
a tough, ruthless world filled with desperate
African Americans. Unfortunately it only suc
ceeds in providing desperate actors. If you ex
perienced multiple orgasms while watching
"Menace 11 Society", you may be able to endure
"Dead Presidents". Ofcourse, it could be worse
Elizabeth Berkley could be in it.
