# Ad Lib
## Travis Vigil One man's 'Graduate' fantasy gone awry 
### 
And here's to you Mrs. Rohmson
■Jesus loves you more than you will
know. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, (lod
hless you please, Mrs. liobinson. Heaeen
holds a plaee for those who pray. Iley. Iley.
Hey.
"Are you Mrs. Robinson?" the personal
advertisement read. "Witty, handsome, sin
gle male, 20 years old, in search of mature
female, age 30 to 40, for friendship and
maybe more."
Now what the hell was I thinking' It \\as
just a childish Hollywood fantasy I guess I
was hoping for Anne Bancroft with leg
propped enticingly on the hotel bed and me,
with an incredulous look on my face, saying
naively, "Are you trying to seduce me, Mrs
Robinson?" Oh, but what I got was some

thing fit only for 3 a.m. cable — if that.
It started innocently enough: no dates in
a while, a couple viewings of "The Gradu
ate" and a lingering ()edipal Complex. Alto
gether, this was enough to push meoverthe
newspaper-dating cliff into the pathetic
depth of lonely, desperate people and dys
functional relationships. "What the hell," I
thought as I placed t he ad. "It might make a
funny column."
Much to my surprise, someone respond
ed to my halt It sounded like a good start
with the message she left: "Hi, my name is
Sheila (name changed to protect the inno
cent 1 You sound really interesting. Give me
a call
()h and it just kept getting better. I gave her
a call, we talked a bit and shedescrihed herself
as pretty, 33 and still "able to turn a head."

So I went with it. We decided to meet at
Chili's, so I could tack on some points to my
frequent dining card and indulge in their
endless selection of tasty treats. I arrived at
the restaurant and waited outside. An older
women emerged from the shadows, intro
duced herself and in a blinding flash I real
ized that Freud was full of shit.
But I figured that I was there and might
as well eat dinner considering the delicious
Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich was only steps
away. Conversation was light and superfi
cial, hut the sandwich was .ill that and a bag
of chips.
Somehow, we ended up in her car. 1 don't
know how. But 1 went with it It's only a
kiss, right?
Wrong. After about 20 minutes of getting
to know each other, she proceeded to tell me

something I really did not need to know —
something strikingly similar to the first line
of Liz Phair's "Flower" except even gnarlier
and nastier than that.
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?
Jolt in '>Joe has left and gone away. Hey, hey,
hey.
And on that note, .Joe left, never to speak
with her again.
So, what do 1 have to say for myself? I
guess the moral of the story is that Holly
wood film fantasies should stay in tinsel
town and out of the personal section of the
newspaper. But most of all, 1 think Paul
Simon said it best and I listened a little too
late.
Laugh about it, shout about it when
you 'ue got to ehoose. Every way you look at it
von lose.
And here's to you Mrs. Rohmson
