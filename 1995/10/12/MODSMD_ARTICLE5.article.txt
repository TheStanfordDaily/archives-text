# Chen recovering from successful transplant
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Contributing writer 
Stanford junior Evan Chen,
whose bout with leukemia
prompted a massive campus blood
drive last May, received a bone
marrow transplant yesterday.
Chen said he had stomach
cramps and some nausea while re
ceiving the marrow. "I'm all right
now," he said.
Though he is recovering well
from the operation, Chen said he
thought the transplant would be
easier than it actually was."I was
under the impression that there
would be fewer side effects," he
said.
The operation only lasted
about 10 minutes while the mar
row was fed into his body intra
venously. "It isn't a surgical pro
cedure at all," explained Yul
Kwon, Chen's close friend.
"There is another bag hooked up
to the IV. It just looks like anoth
er bag full of blood."
As the day continued, Chen
began to feel better. Kwon said
that the doctors expect this com
ing weekend will be the hardest
time for Chen, because the effects
of chemotherapy will be strongest
then.
"I may not feel so good in a cou

pie days, but I feel okay now."
Chen said.
Chen began chemotherapy im
mediately after his diagnosis, but
the cancer did not go into remis
sion and doctors decided he would
need a transplant.
Stanford students supported
Chen in his search for a donor by

holding a cam
pus-wide blood
drive last spring
that targeted
Stanford's
Asian-American
population. More
than 1,000 people
were typed, and al
though a donor
was not found on

campus, Chen said he appreciated
the support everyone gave him.
Two Taiwanese donors were
found in July, and they were test
ed to see which was the closer
match. The marrow was harvest
ed and sent to the United States,
and Chen went into the hospital
Oct. 2 to prepare for the opera
tion.
If everything goes well, Chen
hopes to move out of the hospital in
about a month. He will stay in a con
dominium in the Medical ('enter to
recuperate for the three months
after he gets out of the hospital.
