PLO and Hamas move closer
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Held 105 days in a
Palestinian jail, a leader of the Islamic militant group
Hamas recalls beatings with electric wire that fractured
bones in his elbow, hand and feet.
Despite the brutal treatment he and other militants say
they endured at the hands of fellow Palestinians, Mah
moud Zahhar says reconciliation with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority has never been closer.
"The imprisonment, beatings, that is all behind us,"
said Zahhar, who was released Sunday, and who looked
healthy despite having lost 25 pounds in jail.
"Now we are looking forward to a new relationship
between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority," he said.
The Palestinians and Hamas have been talking on and
off for months, and officials in Arafat's government also
confirmed a draft agreement has been reached.
Key to any PLO-Hamas reconciliation is a pledge by
Hamas to stop launching suicide attacks against Israel

from Palestinian-controlled areas and to halt attacks
against Israelis inside autonomy zones.
Bosnian cease-fire to begin today
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — What the world
hopes will become a permanent cease-fire for Bosnia final
ly took effect early today despite frantic last-minute bat
tles for territory.
The truce went in force today at one minute after mid
night (4:01 p.m. PDT yesterday), U.N. officials said.
They said it probably would take hours for orders to
reach field commanders, making it likely that fighting
would taper off overnight rather than end suddenly.
Sarajevans greeted the cease-fire with volleys of gunfire
soldiers and civilians firing into the air in celebration.
The 60-day truce, part of a U.S.-led effort to bring peace
to the Balkans, was delayed for 48 hours while engineers
tried to restore utilities to Sarajevo and armies battled for
the final bits of territory.
