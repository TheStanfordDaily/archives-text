# O.J. pulls out of interview

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — O.J. Simpson
backed out of his live interview with NBC
just hours before air time last night, com
plaining that the network was out to
"retry me." He had agreed, he insisted,
only to "a conversation, not a confronta
tion."
Days earlier, NBC said the former foot
ball star had consented to a no-holds
barred format for his first extensive inter
view since he was acquitted last week.
Tens of millions of viewers had been
expected to tune in to the hour-long, com
mercial-free "Dateline NBC" interview
that would have been conducted by Tom
Brokaw and Katie Couric.
Simpson maintained that there had
been conditions attached to his interview.
"Because of pending litigation, there
would be some questions that 1 could not
obviously address at this time," he said in
a statement read by his lawyer Johnnie
Cochran Jr.

"It has become clear that NBC has, per
haps in an attempt to appease diverse pub
lic viewpoints, concluded that this would
be a time and an opportunity to retry me."
Brokaw announced Simpson's pullout
in a special live afternoon broadcast.
"NBC News had a clear understanding
as of yesterday (Tuesday) morning with
Mr. Simpson and his lawyers that there
would be no conditions attached to this
interview," Brokaw said.
"But Mr. Simpson's lawyers overnight
prevailed upon him not to participate,
they said, because of the civil suit that he
faces."
In an interview on CBS radio station
WBBM in Chicago, Brokaw was asked if he
and Couric would have been barred from
asking about the murders.
"It came down to that," Brokaw said
wit h a laugh. "They did say, 'Well, are you
going to get into timelines?' And we said,
'That's how we're going to begin.'
