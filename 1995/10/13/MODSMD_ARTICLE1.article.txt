# 'Egregious errors'
## Casper, Rice take on Journal piece 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
When University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice read this
Monday's Wall Street Journal,
t hey were not amused.
The newspaper ran an op-ed
piece written by Stanford grad
uates David Sacks and Peter
Thiel. The two condemned
Stanford's core curriculum,
saying its emphasis on multicul
turalism "really means antipa
thy for the West."
Sacks and Thiel recently
wrote a book, "The Diversity
Myth," which attacks the perva
siveness of multiculturalism at
Stanford, and discusses its neg
ative effects.
Casper and Rice jointly wrote
a letter to the editor of The Wall
Street Journal in response to
the piece, which they considered
"a cartoon, not a description of
[Stanford's| freshman curricu
lum." In the letter, they correct

what they claim are Sacks and
Thiel's "most egregious errors
and misrepresentations."
Sacks and Thiel critiqued
some of Stanford's required
courses, including Cultures,
Ideas and Values, Writing and
Critical Thinking and the gender
requirement. Their article said
all are skewed in such a way that
students receive one-sided expo
sure to what is "multicultural,"
a phrase they interpret to imply
an inherent anti-Western bias.
In their letter, written this
Tuesday, Casper and Rice ad
dressed those topics which
Sacks and Thiel criticized.
Casper and Rice emphasized
that although CIV reading en
tails non-Western, non-tradi
tional texts, it also "is a course
composed of nine tracks that all
include the reading of biblical
texts, Aristotle, Plato and Re
naissance drama."
