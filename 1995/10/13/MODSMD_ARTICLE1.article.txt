# 'Egregious errors'
## Casper, Rice take on Journal piece 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
When University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice read this
Monday's Wall Street Journal,
t hey were not amused.
The newspaper ran an op-ed
piece written by Stanford grad
uates David Sacks and Peter
Thiel. The two condemned
Stanford's core curriculum,
saying its emphasis on multicul
turalism "really means antipa
thy for the West."
Sacks and Thiel recently
wrote a book, "The Diversity
Myth," which attacks the perva
siveness of multiculturalism at
Stanford, and discusses its neg
ative effects.
Casper and Rice jointly wrote
a letter to the editor of The Wall
Street Journal in response to
the piece, which they considered
"a cartoon, not a description of
[Stanford's| freshman curricu
lum." In the letter, they correct

what they claim are Sacks and
Thiel's "most egregious errors
and misrepresentations."
Sacks and Thiel critiqued
some of Stanford's required
courses, including Cultures,
Ideas and Values, Writing and
Critical Thinking and the gender
requirement. Their article said
all are skewed in such a way that
students receive one-sided expo
sure to what is "multicultural,"
a phrase they interpret to imply
an inherent anti-Western bias.
In their letter, written this
Tuesday, Casper and Rice ad
dressed those topics which
Sacks and Thiel criticized.
Casper and Rice emphasized
that although CIV reading en
tails non-Western, non-tradi
tional texts, it also "is a course
composed of nine tracks that all
include the reading of biblical
texts, Aristotle, Plato and Re
naissance drama."
In an interview yesterday,
Rice said that "taking some of the
readings out of their context" was
highly misleading as well.
The letter also stated that
although students must take a
course that "addresses issues of
race and ethnicity or gender," stu
dents have a range of choices in
doing so. Casper and Rice further

clarified their argument by writ
ing that there is no specific
requirement that students must
take courses in "feminist studies"
or "race theory."
In response to Sacks and
Thiel's statement that Stanford
has weakened its foreign lan
guage department, Casper and
Rice mentioned that 25 percent of
Stanford students study abroad.
Such a participation rate is
"hardly a situation that signals
an institutional retreat from

Europe and other cultures," they
wrote.
Casper said that what was
most misleading about the origi
nal op-ed piece was what it didn't
include, or its "non-content."
"Stanford is one of the most
challenging universities in the
country," Casper said in an inter
view. "For (Sacks and Thiol I to
omit all of that which makes it
such is so incredibly demagogic
and appalling, that (Rice and I|
felt it had to be addressed."
