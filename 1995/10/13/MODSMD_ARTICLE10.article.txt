SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) —
Bosnia's most hopeful cease-fire to date quieted
almost all battlefields yesterday, but the govern
ment insisted Serbs must do more to lift the siege of
Sarajevo before peace talks can start.
After weeks of heavy fighting, U.N. officials
called yesterday's cease-fire violations insignificant.
The government and rebel Serbs accused each other

of new attacks in the hittnrlv contested northwest,
but sat down to discuss how to firm up the U.S.-bro
kered truce, scheduled to last 60 days.
With Washington leading the peace drive, this
cease-fire Ls given more chance than previous truces
in the 3 1/2-year war.
"There are good reasons to believe that we are
approaching peace in Bosnia," so long as the world

remains firm with the Serbs, Prime Minister Haris
Silajdzic said in Brussels.
"The cease-fire has more chance than previous
ones, because the readiness is greater than before,"
said Momcilo Krajisnik, a Serb leader.
Hut the Bosnian government warned it would
boycott peace talks, due to begin Oct. 31 in the Unit
ed States, unless further conditions are met. The
talks may lead to an international peace conference
in Paris.
Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey said the
Serbs must open a road to the eastern enclave of
Gorazde and another road out of besieged Sarajevo.
A U.N. aid convoy tried to reach Gorazde from
Sarajevo yesterday on the main road through Serb
held territory. The convoy had to turn back because
of mines.
Serb soldiers at a checkpoint on the road indicat
ed they would not clear the road — a condition of the
cease-fire agreement.
A Serb soldier, Miroslav Cvoko, said Serbs would
inspect any U.N. convoys to make sure the govern
ment wasn't using them to smuggle weapons to
Gorazde.
Restoration of gas and electricity to Sarajevo was
a key condition of the truce, which took effect just
after midnight. While access to Gorazde was part of
the truce agreement, an open road out of Sarajevo
west to Kiseljak was not.
The truce has not ended the siege of Sarajevo,
and its residents cannot travel freely in and out of
the city because the roads, which cross through
Serb-held territory, can be dangerous or barricaded.
Sacirbey said it was vital for Sarajevans, after 3
112 years of Serb siege, to "feel freedom and safety
again."
In recent weeks, the government has had to drop
similar demands under pressure from Washington
to keep peace talks alive.
The United Nations said it registered 15 cease
fire violations across Bosnia yesterday — two deto
nations in a Sarajevo suburb and 12 in northeastern
Bosnia.
The United Nations has no presence in north
western Bosnia, where the government and its
Croat allies reported capturing two Serb-held
towns, Sanski Most and Mrkonjic Grad, this week.
U.N. officials suggested skirmishes would not
necessarily jeopardize the peace efforts.
"We cannot militarily expect people who are
within 200 meters of each other fighting suddenly to
put their rifle in the air and say, 'Thanks very much,
I'm walking backwards,' " said U.N. military
spokesman Lt. Col. Chris Vernon. "It doesn't hap
pen like that."

Sarajevans pass by the eternal flame and a working traffic light in the center of the city. A Bosnia
wide ceasefire came into effect yesterday at 4:01 p.m. PDT.
