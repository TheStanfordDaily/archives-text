# Farrakhan to lead 1 million in march on Washington
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Eddie Staton
is coming from Omaha, Neb., to Monday's
rally of black men because he believes in
the goal, not the organizer, Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
"I'm going a Christian, I'm going to
come back a Christian," Staton says.
In Evansville, Ind., Justin Hunter said
that despite Farrakhan's role, he will be
on the National Mali in Washington "if 1
have to fly, ride, walk or crawl."
Farrakhan said the antipathy toward
him expressed by some "clouds the beauty
of the message," but that it had been that
way through history. "Moses, Jesus,
Mohammed . . . the message wasn't
liked," he said in an interview on CNN.
Around the nation, preparations to
attend the march ranged from non-exis
tent — many people said they are unaware
of it — to massive. Lionel Graham, han
dling march logistics in New York, said
250,000 men would come from his area
alone.
Just how many are coming is anybody's
guess, but Washington is preparing for
traffic-jamming crowds, many from the
local area, for what the organizers are call

ing a "Million Mati March."
The school board in suburban Arling
ton, Va., canceled afternoon bus service
because nearly half its drivers plan to
attend the event.
The school board in Camden, N.J., 150
miles to the north, declared a school holi
day because more than 250 of its 4,000
employees asked for the day off, with the
numbers climbing. The district has 20,000
students.
"The potential exists for us not to have
enough substitutes," said Superintendent
Roy Dawson.
People who work in the nation's capital
were advised to leave their cars at home
and ride the subway. Washington is no
stranger to big demonstrations, but they
usually are scheduled on weekends. Offi
cials are preparing for 11,000 to 12,000
buses.
Farrakhan conceived the event as "a
holy day of atonement and reconciliation."
He said without elaboration that ho did
not want women at the event "because of
the potential danger of the situation."
"We are not an army. We don't come
with weapons. We've asked everybody not

to come with so much as a penknife on
their person," he said in the CNN inter
view. "This is a peaceful march, a peaceful
demonstration.
"Our aim is not to shut the city down,
hut we did want to come on a Monday
when government was in session so that
the statement and the day of absence as
well as the march would be felt around tin?
country."
Farrakhan asked those who could not
be there to observe "a day of absence" and
called on black women (o refrain from
shopping and to spend the day with their
children teaching them the value of home,
self-esteem, family and unity.
"One day of not shopping will not hurt
us," said Elizabeth Rand of Columbus,
Ohio. "Our dollars are felt, and the
absence of our dollars will be felt. "
Like Staton, many who expressed their
intention to travel to Washington said
they would do it despite Farrakhan, who
has called Judaism "a gutter religion" and
denounced whites, homosexuals and other
groups.
"Clearly the issue of the march is some
thing we support," said Dick Lobenthal,

director of the Michigan Anti-Defamation
League. "We regret that it has to be led by
a bigot."
John Humes said he is making the trip
with 20 friends because "I feel the need to
show the unity because we are a hurting
race."
While the Rev. Jesse Jackson has
endorsed the march, other ministers have
appeared on radio talk shows to distance
themselves.
Hunter, a 20-year-old student at the
University of Southern Indiana, called the
event a symbol of needed change in the
self-image of black men, a demonstration
that black men "are not all killing one
another, are not all drug dealers and
users, but that we are educated men who
take care of business."
Odell Smith of Muskogee, Okla., char
tered a 40-seat bus. "We are, as a commu
nity so lethargic about agreeing on any
thing. I don't agree with everything Far
rakhan has to say," hut "I don't believe
everything my dad has to say (either) but
we can come together on a common cause.
I look at it as an opportunity for unity.
Any excuse is a good excuse if you want to

stay divided."
Said the Rev. Wendell Anthony, presi
dent of the NAACP chapter in Detroit:
"It's not just Minister Farrakhan's march,
it's God's march."
Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer is among
those who says he is coming. "Part of the
reason I'm going is to encourage African-
American males to get away from crime,
get a good education and be responsible for
the children they bring into this world."
"On Oct. 16, there will be bright black
sunshine in Washington, D.C. — I million
black men marching on Washington," said
the Rev. Benjamin Chavis, the recently
deposed leader of the NAACP and the
national director of the event.
While some prospective attendees are
taking a vacation day from work, some
employers are making it easy. Jakwan
Rivert will be closing his video store in
Brooklyn because "I want to mobilize as
many men as I am."
Barbara Smith-Boyd, who owns The
Family Store, a boutique in Brooklyn, is
supplying T-shirts for some of the men to
wear to Washington bearing this message:
"Women are beautiful. Stop the abuse."
