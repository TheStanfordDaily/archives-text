## Real EANABs for all 
### 
The university eanab
policy is one of the most
abused and violated policies
on campus. Although it simply
states that there must be equally
attractive non-alcoholic beverages
at parties and other functions that
serve alcohol, most students and
residence staff seem to completely
ignore the policy
The problem is not that there are
no attractive non-alcoholic bever
ages served at parties. At most of
these functions, there are cans of
Coke and Sprite to equal the num
ber of alcoholic beverages. The
problem is that these non-alcoholic
beverages are not "equally attrac
tive."
Many people are confused about
the words "equally attractive."
Most students assume that these
beverages are for those who do not
drink alcohol. By making this
assumption, they can essentially
serve any non-alcoholic beverage
and consider it equally attractive.
After all a student who refuses to
drink will drink anything non-alco

holic, even water.
That is a mistake. Equally attrac
tive means that non-alcoholic bev
erages should be equally attractive
to all students — including those
who would consume alcohol. A real
equally attractive beverage should
simply appeal to all students and
make students seriously consider
whether they want an EANAB or
an alcoholic drink.
At a party that serves beer, that
would mean that a proper EANAB
would be something like cappuccino
or Juice Club. These are the types of
EANABs that make a student who
wants to drink alcohol think twice
and choose an EANAB instead.
That is because the EANAB would
be equally attractive.
Some would argue that truly
equally attractive beverages would
significantly increase the price of
organizing parties. But if students
want to serve alcohol, that is the
price they have to pay.
Erom now on, there should be no
confusion as to what an EANAB
means.
