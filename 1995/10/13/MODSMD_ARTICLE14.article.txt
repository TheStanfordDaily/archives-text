# Contradictions galore
## 
### 
TWO WEEKS AGO, the Uni
versity took a stance on the
Palo Alto Growth Initia
tive. It decided to donate almost
$19,000 worth of services to con
duct a survey that could defeat
the initiative.
By taking a direct role, the
University is actively trying to
beat the bill known as Measure R,
which would limit the expansion
of a number of Stanford projects,
including the Stanford Shopping
Center, a new development in the
Stanford Research Park and a
hotel-conference center on Page
Mill Road.
Considered on its own, the
University's decision is not neces
sarily a bad idea. The Palo Alto
Growth Initiative will obviously
curtail Stanford expansion plans.
However, by taking a stance on
this issue, the University is con
tradicting earlier statements in

which it said it wouldn t take a
stance on a political issue For
example, the grape policy says
that the University does not take
political stances, although stu
dents and residences can.
We would just like to remind
the University that it cannot go
both ways. If it is willing to take a
political stance on an issue that
concerns it directly, it should also
be willing to take a stance on
other political issues.
By being inconsistent, the Uni
versity is only hurting itself. If it
wants to defeat the Palo Alto
Growth inititiave, which it
should, it should make sure that
it changes its overall view on tak
ing political stances. That would
mean, in the future, it should
take political stances on every
issue.
Otherwise, it should just do
nothing at all.
