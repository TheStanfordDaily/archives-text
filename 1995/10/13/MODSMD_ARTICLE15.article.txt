Race relations and the O.J. Simpson trial — a response to Kavenoki

IN RESPONSE TO Gene Kavenoki's
letter printed yesterday, I must say that
I can understand his frustration with
the O.J. trial and specifically with the hero
status awarded to the defendant by many
people in the media and communities
throughout the country.
O.J. Simpson is no hero.
Whether or not he killed Nicole Brown
Simpson, he most definitely terrorized her.
There is proof of that — pictures, 911 calls
and friends who said that she was scared
for her life, and that he had threatened to
slit her throat.
I find it quite alarming that a man of
this character is idolized by so many. Are
we, as Americans, so obsessed with the
issue of race that we let it completely over
shadow such a monumentally important
topic as domestic violence?
1 can understand why a community
faced with the pain caused by the incredi
ble number of men (especially young men)
in jail, combined with the day-to-day (if not
centurv-to-century) hardship of living in an
oppressive society would respond so jxisi-

tively to O.J.'s acquittal. Fine — celebrate
the victory of O.J. the trial. Do not cele
brate O.J. the man. He beal down Ins wife.
That is deplorable.
Having said that, 1 must say, however,
that I take issue with a number of the
other points made in Mr. Kavenoki's letter.
First, the letter argued that the trial
had nothing to do with race or the L.A.P.D.
or the judicial system more generally. 1
would respond by arguing that it lk impos
sible to separate the social issues of the
greater society from the microcosm of the
courtroom. Every single person that partic
ipated in the trial was aware of the climate
of race relations in America and specifically
how this climate has been influenced by
the last hugely popular case dealing with
racial issues: the Rodney King trial There
is no way this could not influence the deci
sion. I don't know if this is right or wrong.
I would simply argue that it happened.
Second, yesterday's letter seemed to
imply that the violence and breaches of jus
tice carried out by police against blacks in
urban settings (Mr. Kavenoki refers to

these as "slums") is the result of provoca
tion by the urban residents themselves.
This is an interesting point. 1 do remember
being appalled that during the L.A. riots,
many people actually shot at the cops try
ing to put down the rioting.
1 would in no way defend such point
loss violence and I think that these people
should bo prosecuted. However, in looking
for a reason why, I refuse to attribute it to
the disposition of the residents them
selves. There must bo something going on
in the social situation that these residents
would be so angry at the system that they
would actually open fire at policemen.
Clearly, it must have been preceded by
violence against the community by law
enforcement officials.
It is human nature to want to blame the
victim. W«> want to feel safe. We want to
feel we live in a just world; if we simply live
our lives correctly, then we will not be con
fronted with hardship. Thus, we defensive
ly and compulsively blame the victim for
their mistreatment. It gives us an illusion
of control. This is true for rape victims

("she asked for it"'), enemies of war and it
seems to be the guiding principle of Mr.
Kavenoki's analysis.
Finally, Mr. Kavenoki's letter refers to
the jurors in the trial as "12 inner-city
dullards" that were convinced by the "ver
bal pyrotechnics of a black lawyer in a
gaudy suit" and by the idea that "the trial
was not about O.J. Simpson, but rather
about decades of injustice and racism."
Rather than milking judgments about
the intelligence of the jurors, I think it is
more profound to think about why they,
and so many others, saw him as innocent.
Simply disagreeing with those who thought
he was guilty does not make them
"dullards." That type of logic can Ix- used
to argue against anything (which, by the
way, is a pretty good measure for bad
logic). Seventy-five percent of black Ameri
cans also disagreed with Mr. Kavenoki's
analysis.
I'm quite sure he doesn't think these
people are all dullards as well

There is proof of that — pictures, 911 calls
and friends who said that she was scared
for her life, and that he had threatened to
slit her throat.
I find it quite alarming that a man of
this character is idolized by so many. Are
we, as Americans, so obsessed with the
issue of race that we let it completely over
shadow such a monumentally important
topic as domestic violence?
1 can understand why a community
faced with the pain caused by the incredi
ble number of men (especially young men)
in jail, combined with the day-to-day (if not
centurv-to-century) hardship of living in an
oppressive society would respond so jxisi-

tively to O.J.'s acquittal. Fine — celebrate
the victory of O.J. the trial. Do not cele
brate O.J. the man. He beal down Ins wife.
That is deplorable.
Having said that, 1 must say, however,
that I take issue with a number of the
other points made in Mr. Kavenoki's letter.
First, the letter argued that the trial
had nothing to do with race or the L.A.P.D.
or the judicial system more generally. 1
would respond by arguing that it lk impos
sible to separate the social issues of the
greater society from the microcosm of the
courtroom. Every single person that partic
ipated in the trial was aware of the climate
of race relations in America and specifically
how this climate has been influenced by
the last hugely popular case dealing with
racial issues: the Rodney King trial There
is no way this could not influence the deci
sion. I don't know if this is right or wrong.
I would simply argue that it happened.
Second, yesterday's letter seemed to
imply that the violence and breaches of jus
tice carried out by police against blacks in
urban settings (Mr. Kavenoki refers to

these as "slums") is the result of provoca
tion by the urban residents themselves.
This is an interesting point. 1 do remember
being appalled that during the L.A. riots,
many people actually shot at the cops try
ing to put down the rioting.
1 would in no way defend such point
loss violence and I think that these people
should bo prosecuted. However, in looking
for a reason why, I refuse to attribute it to
the disposition of the residents them
selves. There must bo something going on
in the social situation that these residents
would be so angry at the system that they
would actually open fire at policemen.
Clearly, it must have been preceded by
violence against the community by law
enforcement officials.
It is human nature to want to blame the
victim. W«> want to feel safe. We want to
feel we live in a just world; if we simply live
our lives correctly, then we will not be con
fronted with hardship. Thus, we defensive
ly and compulsively blame the victim for
their mistreatment. It gives us an illusion
of control. This is true for rape victims

("she asked for it"'), enemies of war and it
seems to be the guiding principle of Mr.
Kavenoki's analysis.
Finally, Mr. Kavenoki's letter refers to
the jurors in the trial as "12 inner-city
dullards" that were convinced by the "ver
bal pyrotechnics of a black lawyer in a
gaudy suit" and by the idea that "the trial
was not about O.J. Simpson, but rather
about decades of injustice and racism."
Rather than milking judgments about
the intelligence of the jurors, I think it is
more profound to think about why they,
and so many others, saw him as innocent.
Simply disagreeing with those who thought
he was guilty does not make them
"dullards." That type of logic can Ix- used
to argue against anything (which, by the
way, is a pretty good measure for bad
logic). Seventy-five percent of black Ameri
cans also disagreed with Mr. Kavenoki's
analysis.
I'm quite sure he doesn't think these
people are all dullards as well
