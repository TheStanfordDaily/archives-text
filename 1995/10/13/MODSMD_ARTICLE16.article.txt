# Riding a bike on campus is not as safe as flying the sky
## 
### 
I'd like to second the motion "Stan
ford needs safe bicycle laws" with the
following short memoir:
I used to hike around the campus a
lot as the best and fastest means of
getting around. I gave up biking two
years ago because there are too many
daredevils around the campus. After
two collisions and several near-colli
sions, I decided, as an aging cyclist, to
give up hiking
I would have you know that it's not
an act of cowardice or survival at
whatever cost. After all, I still pilot
Cessnas without much concern
because, in the air, we live by traffic
regulations even when there is no
tower to advise you In other words, I

find it safer to fly an airplane in the
wild blue yonder than to bicycle from
Hoover Tower to Tresidder.
