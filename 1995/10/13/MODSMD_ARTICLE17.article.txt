In her letter to the editor in The
Daily on Oct. 6, Acting Asst. History
Prof. Laura Smoller expressed concern
that the Department of Athletics hadn't
handled the communication of a recent
NCAA regulation deadline very well. In
fact, the last minute notification of ath
letes, coaches and the academic advisers
resulted in panic and confusion for all.
Smoller's concerns are valid and we
wish to offer our sincere apologies to
those students, faculty and staff incon
venienced hv our failure to communicate

the requirements in a timely and thor
ough manner.
The new NCAA rule required a deadline
of Oct. 4 for all student-athletes to have
achieved full-time enrollment status at
Stanford University. Unfortunately, the
Stanford registration deadline was four
days later on Oct. 8, which necessitated the
hurried response on the part of the stu
dent-athletes to ensure that the NCAA
deadline was met.
We now realize that the NCAA dead
line had not heen clearly communicated
in a timely manner to the athletes and
their advisers. The student-athletes
have heen educated hv the Athletic
Department to follow NCAA rules "to
the letter," and in their efforts to com
ply, clearly inconvenienced and aggra
vated many faculty and Undergraduate
Advising Center staff. We apologize for
this inconvenience.
We are currently working on a plan to

correct this situation, allow for ample
notice and m;ike sure student-athletes are
given sufficient time to meet with their
advisers prior to this newly-approved
deadline. The Athletic Department con
ducts its athletic programs with strict
adherence to the rules and regulations
mandated by the NCAA and the Pacific 10
Conference; however, this does not mean
that we should inconvenience the advisers
and faculty to meet these rules.
We have received some very produc
tive and helpful suggestions to remedy
this situation and intend to implement
them. We would like to, once again, offer
our sincere apologies for the inconve
nience, both professionally and personal
ly, that the Athletics Department has
caused members of the faculty, UAC
staff and the varsity athletes.
