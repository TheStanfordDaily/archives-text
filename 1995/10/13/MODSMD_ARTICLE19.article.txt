# Josh Gohlke
## Are those freshmen you smell? 
### 
EVERY FALL, I feel it — a certain
malaise, a lack of luster that can't
be attributed to the changing
weather. And though I'm no fanatic when
it comes to 18th century literature, the
English Department's autumn schedule is
not to blame either.
The source of my sorrow is much more
tangible: it's freshmen.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not too
fond of the sophomores either; 1 knew
them when they were freshmen and 1998
will not be America's proudest year. The
juniors are no cause to celebre, and you
wouldn't find me at senior pub night even
if the drinks were free.
But it's the freshmen that peak my
nausea and dread almost to the point of
finally turning in that transfer applica
tion.
The sight of them, the way they proud
ly display their Bookstore-bought Stan
ford apparel, as if someone's going to run
into them in the middle of White Plaza
and say, "Hey, you go to Stanford? Jesus
Christ, so do I!"
The sound of them: to be a freshman is
to elevate small talk to a lifestyle: "Where
are you from? What's your CIV? Do you
have a soul? Neither do I!"
In earnest, they bare their hearts to
people they feel like they've known for
weeks. In panic, they create a fictional

character who accompanied them to their
high school proms.
In short, the unique odiousness of
freshmen lies in the dimension of enthusi
asm they add to the typically vapid Stan
ford mind. They are empty and proud of it.
Some will doubt my credentials. But
three years ago, I lived in Branner,
Dante's favorite dorm. I lived with people
whose prior lives had been so inconse
quential that they considered Orientation
their finest hour.
Alas, it throws me into unwanted remi
niscence, recurring nightmares of fresh
men living in University housing, encour
aged in their disease by ardent RAs, the
encapsulation effect and a near-universal
lack of self-esteem.
The trysts: intra-dormitory relation
ships that linger like the smell of fish, fes
tering freshman fornication.
"Yes, I kissed a girl in high school.
Girls. I kissed girls in high school. I had
sex with girls in high school. Every week,
a new girl I was having sex with. All the
time."
The fact that these young people have
found their destined mates is proven by —
if nothing else — their exactly matching
lack of appeal to others — perhaps even to
each other. But necessity will prevail.
And so will love, the most special-est
love of all, at least until sophomore year.

"Governor's Corner? That's a lot far
ther than up the stairs, you know."
The personas: the sovereignty of the
gimmick, a single definable trait that will
make one immediately reducible, know
able, maybe even popular "I'm Kathy. I
play the xylophone. I'm the girl with the
xylophone."
The cliques: unloved white guys from
unremarkable locales, unite! You have
nothing to lose but your painful awkward
ness! Together they make incompetence a
virtue, stupidity an asset. The slave men
tality of people who save their beer cans,
who have never had friends before, never
will again.
Always smile and say "Hi" to the people
you like. Buy the Bob Marley greatest hits
CD. Remember you can never use the
word "sweet' too often. Don't be different
unless you're just kidding. See you at the
next Flo Mo party.
With a beginning like this, it's not sur
prising the way the world ends.
Your freshman year; the best year you
ever had. And it wasn't even that good.
