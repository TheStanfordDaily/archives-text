# Off the hook
## Last charge in museum case dropped 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
The only criminal charge re
maining in connection with last
spring's Stanford Art Museum
break-in case was dismissed yes
terday.
Senior Jacob Kuramoto faced a
misdemeanor charge for posses
sion of burglary tools for carrying
a knapsack containing an assort
ment of screwdrivers, wrenches,
saws and other tools at (he time of
his arrest.
Three students and two alumni
originally were arrested for the
March 25 incident.
In early June, insufficient evi
dence led Municipal Court Judge
Gilbert Brown to drop all felony
burglary charges against the five
suspects — Kuramoto, alumni
Matthew Bengard and Jose
Farias, and juniors Timothy
Kut/.key and Alejandro Quezada.
The misdemeanor charge was
formally dismissed yesterday after
Kuramoto's attorney documented
his client's compliance with an
earlier agreement of community

service and restitution in ex
change for the dismissal.
Kuramoto served more than 20
hours of community service over
the summer in his hometown of
Pittsburgh and paid just over $ 170
— his portion of restitution costs
— to the University for expenses
related to investigation by muse
um staff.
His attorney Ed Mahler said
other factors leading to the dis
missal were "search issues" sur
rounding the legality of the deten
tion and arrest of the five, and the
June dismissal of felony burglary
charges.
"If there's no intent to burglar
ize, the charge doesn't fit," he
said, adding that some of the tools,
a wire cutter and dry wall knife,
"made no sense" as burglary tools.
"It just looked like a collection of
tools just haphazardly put togeth
er," he said.
Mahler said while these issues
would have made for a good case,
"it made a lot of sense" to make
the agreement to save time and
ramoto would have had to pay
restitution regardless.
"[The dismissal] places Jake in
the position he wants ... no crim
inal record," said Mahler.
Ku ramoto also faced a second
misdemeanor charge for bringing
a weapon onto school grounds, but
the charge was dismissed because
the particular knife he was carry
ing was not addressed within the
scope of the law.
