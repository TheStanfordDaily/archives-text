# Harassment policy respects the need for confidentiality
## 
### 
I am concerned that your recent arti
cle on the limits of confidentiality in the
new sexual harassment policy may cause
some misinterpretation. Both the cur
rent policy and the revised policy, cur
rently under review, respect the need for
confidentiality when dealing with issues
of sexual harassment.
It is often the case that individuals
seeking consultations about sexual harass
ment want them to l>e confidential or "off
the record." Except under extraordinary
circumstances, this can be achieved by
individuals discussing their concerns with
out identifying the persons involved,
and/or in certain instances, without iden
tifying themselves. Additionally, confiden
tial consultation about sexual harassment
may be available from counselors at CAPS
or the Help Center, chaplains at Memorial
Church and the University and Medical
Center ombudspersons. In these cases, the
level of confidentiality depends on the
legid privileges held by the person receiv
ing the complaint, and this issue should be
addressed before specific facts are dis
cussed.
In asking resident assistants to con
sult with a residence dean or a resident
fellow on all issues of sexual harassment

that come to their attention, the Univer
sity is trying to insure that all com
plaints brought forward are addressed
and remedied in a timely and effective
manner. Further information about this
issue may be obtained from my office by
sending e-mail to HarassC" leland.
