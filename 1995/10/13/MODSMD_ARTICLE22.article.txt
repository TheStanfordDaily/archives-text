# Stanford students should be concerned about grapes
## 
### 
Since the inception of the '95-'96 aca
demic year, fliers posted around our
campus have attempted to edify stu
dents regarding a joint movement of stu
dents and faculty to boycott the Califor
nia grapes served in our dining facilities
and to seek a reversal of University poli
cy regarding this issue.
Hut on a campus that has become
lulled into a comatose state of political
indifference to anything not related to
the O.iJ. Simpson trial, it's questionable
whether this issue has been seriously
examined and considered by our stu
dent population. When I solicited the
opinion of a member of my dorm, his
lackadaisical retort was, "Isn't it just
about some grapes?"
()n the surface, the University's

grape policy and upcoming grapes pro
grams (to be held Oct. 17> seem trivial.
Hut the grape debate isn't merely about
whether or not we should eat grapes.
The larger issues surround human
rights, minority oppression and stu
dent civil activism.
The impetus of the student faculty
movement lies in the fact that the labor
ers who harvest California grapes con
tinually endure privations in the forms
of low, sub-par wages and a hazardous
work environment. The widespread use
of pesticides and sprays such as
Ma'athion pose a considerable health
risk to these workers. Juxtaposed to the
nature of the work, the members of this
impecunious work force find themselves
being continually exploited.
Those who oppose this proposed boy
cott assert that since the said dispute
involves dissension between the grape
growers and workers' union, it is a mat
ter outside of our jurisdiction. Hut as
consumers, we have a right to know that
what we purchase with student funds
does not indirectly support, in any way,
any violations of basic human rights.
Consider the United States policy of
boycotting products from China suspect
ed of having been manufactured
through the use of slave labor. The
exploitat ion of workers in the United
States is no less wrong than the

exploitation occurring in communist
China. As Americans, we have a duty to
provide a voice so that the concerns of
the farm workers are heard, acknowl
edged and addressed.
Furthermore, it is no coincidence that
the farm workers are comprised largely
of Mexican-Americans. The labor dis
pute between the landowners and labor
ers simply represents another instance
in which minorities have been oppressed
by a stringent establishment. Similar to
the way Mexican farm workers are cur
rently being treated, so too were the
Chinese "coolies" who built the western
railroads and tne Korean workers who
harvested California oranges oppressed
100 years ago. And like so many of the
paramount issues of the society in which
we now live, this grape issue is rooted in
race.
On this diverse campus, the plight
facing Mexican farm workers should
especially strike a chord among the
members of our different ethnic com
munities. The grape debate doesn't
merely surround the treatment of one
race by another. Its greater signifi
cance lies in the history of similar
oppression imposed on the basis of not
being a member of the dominant one.
hi supporting the grape boycott, an
individual can play a part in ensuring
that the lessons of the minority past

have not and will not be forgotten or
overlooked.
Hut most importantly, the grape
debate offers an opportunity to explore
a multi-faceted and pluri-significant
issue on a campus in which it has
become too easy to be neutral, political
ly correct and apathetic. The grape poli
cy is a matter that calls upon our sense
of duty not only as students and young
people, but as a generation that is
poised to assume the reigns of leader
ship of this country. The Republican
Congress has proposed massive cuts in
federal funding for education. What
have we done? Student participation in
the ASSU lags at a diminutive level.
What can we do?
With its many implications and
sheer symbolic significance, the fate of
the University's grape policy ultimate
ly lies in the hands of this student
body. By becoming involved and
informed, the individual tackles the
larger issues of human rights viola
tions, ethnic oppression and student
activism. Let us act and let our actions
speak on behalf of our beliefs. 1 feel no
words speak as cogently of the exigency
of this situation as those of Martin
Luther King â€” "Injustice anywhere is
a threat to justice everywhere."
