# Food and fun, followed by football
## Eating clubs plan tailgate party 
### Braulio Garcia 
The Stanford Eating Clubs arc celebrating their
101st anniversary in style this homecoming weekend.
The eating clubs, located l>ehind Toyon Hall, will host a
tailgate party designed to bring together students and
alumni while rooting for the Cardinal football team
The party will feature barbecue food and entertain
ment in an effort to involve the entire campus in some
pre-game revelry. Though the tailgate party is meant
for everyone to come and enjoy, its main goal is to show
alumni how the clubs have changed and progressed
over the last century, said Nick Peters, manager of the
eating clubs.
The tailgate is part of an effort by the managerial
staff at the eating clubs to allow alumni to revisit days
gone by. The party will feature displays of old pictures,
recipes and stories of Stanford's early years. The mem
orabilia was submitted this summer in response to a
mailer sent by the eating clubs to ,'i,500 alumni.
Alumni will be able to meet with old friends and pro
lessors at the party, which Peters said is an important
event for the eating clubs as they try to foster ;t sense of
unity and belonging for the alumni at homecoming.
Although the tailgate is meant to be a fun event, it
is also part of a larger outreach by the eating clubs to
elicit support from alumni for the clubs' effort to
acquire a new building. Such a move would help
improve both food quality and service.
The eating clubs are trying to fund the purchase of
new space to replace the familiar L-shaped building

l>ehind Toyon, which was built in 1951 and is now
beginning to show signs of wear and tear.
"Each successive year, we pay twice as much as the
year before for repairs," Peters said. "It's time for a
new building."
The Stanford Eating Clubs, a corporation provid
ing an alternate dining option to Food Service, do have
enough funding to begin the project, but Financial
Manager Kibo Kitahama said that they cannot do it
alone.
"We do have the financial resources to seriously
consider funding our own building," said Kitahama
"Hut we need help."
As a result, the eating clubs are trying to show the
alumni their importance to this project by holding
such events as the tailgate party.
Peters said alumni are the best people to help the
eating clubs because they are the ones who have bene
fited most from the clubs.
"Throughout the cent ury of eating club service, we
have provided a looser and more fun place for people to
kick back and meet great j>eople," Peters said.
From 1H94, when the Brookfarm Eating Club was
opened, until now, "the SEC (Stanford Eating Clubs)
alumni have met their spouses and best friends and
had some of the best times of their college years
through the eating clubs," Peters said. "Why not keep
that tradition alive for present and future SEC mem
bers?"
The tailgate party at Toyon is scheduled to start .it
10 a.m. tomorrow.
