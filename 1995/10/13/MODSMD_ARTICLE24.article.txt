# Stern renovations noted at ceremony
## 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
After a summertime attempt to
shed its status as the ugly duckling
of Stanford residences, the reno
vated Stern Hall made its formal
debut at an official opening day cel
ebration yesterday.
Visitors were welcome to stroll
through the dorm in an open-house
period, during which common
areas were dotted with pre-renova
tion pictures on easels to serve as
reminders of a Stern happily gone.
In a gathering afterward, Keith
Guy, director of Housing and Din
ing Services, and other leaders in
thi 1 project doled out praise to those
who worked hard during the year
long planning process and the fast
paced construction time.
Before the renewal project,
Stern "cried out for attention,"
Guy said. "We hope it will |now)
remain high on the list of desirable
places to live on the Stanford cam
pus."
"If 1 hadn't believed in miracles

before, I do now," said Vice Provost
and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds of the rapid transforma
tion.
Reflecting on the work, which is
part of the 12-year Capital
Improvement Program, Director of
Housing Services Rodger Whitney
said, "Stern really was the project
we talked about the most, worried
about the most and had the most
anxiety about.
"It was a daunting task to
undertake," he added, describing
t he complex as a "monolithic struc
ture." He said designers were able
to emerge from t heir "stupor" after
inspiration from University Archi
tect and Director of Planning David
Neuman, who urged them not to
try to remake Stern, but to "bring
it into the '905."
Whitney detailed some notable
improvements, including the cre
ation of a formal entryway, vastly
improved resident fellow apart
ments that were once "horrible"
and "undeveloped," and the con
nection of previously separate

north and south sections with a
vibrant purple connector he
referred to as the "purple people
eater."
He added that renovators want
ed "to make a statement with this
building," referring to the new
style as a "Mediterranean flavor
with lively colors."
While most would agree that
Stern is a nicer place to live, Sen a
resident Chip Kendrick, who also
lived there last year, was a little
more critical. "They tried to get a
little too modern with it,"he said.
Contrasting Stern with Laguni
ta, where she stayed last year dur
ing Admit Weekend, freshman
Patti Mora, a Casa Zapata resident,
said Stern looks "really great."
But her roommate, freshman
Susanne Eklund, responded to t he
new exterior color — which stu
dents allege is officially known as
"pumpkin" — with one word:
"Yuck." Mora, however, said of the
new look, "In case we get confused
with the other dorms, we know
where we live. It's a landmark."
