# Panel explores questions about affirmative action
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron 
In a break from current anti-afhrmative-action
sentiment throughout California, the forum, "Affir
mative Action, the University and Beyond," held yes
terday in a packed Kresge Auditorium, portrayed
affirmative action in the Stanford community and
elsewhere as not only positive, but essential.
According to Anthropology Prof. Renato Rosaldo,
who presided over the forum, the panelists were "not
trying to speak with one voice." Rather, the forum
was an attempt to "explore a complex issue from a
number of different perspectives in order to promote
a kind of broader understanding."

Speaking first to the nearly full ■
auditorium, History Prof. Albert 1
Camarillo, former director of the I
Center for Chicano Research, §
defined affirmative action as being!
about opportunity. This opportuni- I
ty, Camarillo said, represents the |
American Dream "both real and |
imagined." In our changing society, H
Camarillo said that people must
"consider ways to maintain avenues

ot opportunity.
He said the "historic avenues of opportunity are at
great risk." Neither a high school nor a college diplo
ma is a guarantee of success any longer, Camarillo
said, and the middle class is threatened as the gap
between the haves and the have-nots grows.
Currently, according to Camarillo, the top 1 per
cent of the United States owns 40 percent of the
wealth, leading to an "impending crisis as we
approach the next millennium."
Because the "proverbial playing field is uneven for
a growing percentage of Americans," Camarillo said
he believes the policies of affirmative action, origi
nally adopted under President Lyndon Johnson,
should not be abandoned. He added that the nation
cannot tolerate a return to the isolation and alien
ation which certain minority groups felt before the
adoption of affirmative-action policies.
Estelle Freedman, professor of history and chair
of the feminist Studies Program, discussed affirma
tive action's importance to women. In the past,
according to Freedman, women were often "educa
tionally all dressed up with no place to go." Affirma
tive-action policies have opened formerly closed
doors of employment to women.
As an example of this, Freedman related how after
current Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Con
nor graduated from Stanford Law School in 1952,
she could only find employment as a legal secretary.

The number of women in executive and manageri
al jobs has increased from 15 percent in 1956 to 39
percent in 1989 Despite these encouraging signs,
Freedman claimed that "it is not really time, as some
have argued . that we can let down our guard." To
stop affirmative-action policies now, Freedman stat
ed bluntly, "would be stupidity."
Affirmative action's effects on staff hiring were
elaborated upon by Rosa Gonzalez, associate director
of the Office for Multicultural Development. As of
August 1995, Stanford, the peninsula's fourth
largest employer, employed a staff of 66 percent
women and 32 percent minorities.
Development of staff is based upon analysis of
work force availability, not quotas, Gonzalez empha
sized. She said she feels that staff development efforts
to this point have been successful, but that the work
isn't done and Stanford faces challenges in managing,
maintaining and increasing diversity.
Law Prof Robert Weisberg, vice provost for facul
ty recruitment and development, spoke concerning
affirmative-action policies in faculty hiring. Accord
ing to Weisberg, a good affirmative-action plan
"doesn't constitute a single document . . . but rather
a set of understanding."
Weisberg then elaborated upon the existence of
the Faculty Incentive Fund at Stanford, which pro
vides rewards to schools and departments which hire
minorities.
Students had mixed reactions to the forum. Dur
ing a question and response period, sophomore Julie
Johnson, president of the Stanford College Republi
cans, questioned in an emotional manner how a uni
versity could admit one candidate over another just
because of a different piece of DNA.
How could this be fair, she asked, when others
equally qualified had worked many years in hopes of
achieving admission, only to be refused because of a
factor over which they have no control? In response,
Freedman conceded that affirmative action is not
without heartache.
Junior Janice Strong, a political science major,
was satisfied with the content of the forum. She said
she felt that there could be no alternative to support
ing affirmative action if Stanford is to keep with its
original mission of providing opportunity for all as
well as a diverse environment.
The forum was sponsored by the programs in
Feminist Studies, Jewish Studies, Modern Thought
and Literature and African Studies. Other sponsors
included the Committee on Culture and Cultures,
the Office of Multicultural Education, the Center for
Teaching and Learning and the Office of Multicul
tural Development.

In a break from current anti-afhrmative-action
sentiment throughout California, the forum, "Affir
mative Action, the University and Beyond," held yes
terday in a packed Kresge Auditorium, portrayed
affirmative action in the Stanford community and
elsewhere as not only positive, but essential.
According to Anthropology Prof. Renato Rosaldo,
who presided over the forum, the panelists were "not
trying to speak with one voice." Rather, the forum
was an attempt to "explore a complex issue from a
number of different perspectives in order to promote
a kind of broader understanding."

Speaking first to the nearly full ■
auditorium, History Prof. Albert 1
Camarillo, former director of the I
Center for Chicano Research, §
defined affirmative action as being!
about opportunity. This opportuni- I
ty, Camarillo said, represents the |
American Dream "both real and |
imagined." In our changing society, H
Camarillo said that people must
"consider ways to maintain avenues

ot opportunity.
He said the "historic avenues of opportunity are at
great risk." Neither a high school nor a college diplo
ma is a guarantee of success any longer, Camarillo
said, and the middle class is threatened as the gap
between the haves and the have-nots grows.
Currently, according to Camarillo, the top 1 per
cent of the United States owns 40 percent of the
wealth, leading to an "impending crisis as we
approach the next millennium."
Because the "proverbial playing field is uneven for
a growing percentage of Americans," Camarillo said
he believes the policies of affirmative action, origi
nally adopted under President Lyndon Johnson,
should not be abandoned. He added that the nation
cannot tolerate a return to the isolation and alien
ation which certain minority groups felt before the
adoption of affirmative-action policies.
Estelle Freedman, professor of history and chair
of the feminist Studies Program, discussed affirma
tive action's importance to women. In the past,
according to Freedman, women were often "educa
tionally all dressed up with no place to go." Affirma
tive-action policies have opened formerly closed
doors of employment to women.
As an example of this, Freedman related how after
current Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Con
nor graduated from Stanford Law School in 1952,
she could only find employment as a legal secretary.

The number of women in executive and manageri
al jobs has increased from 15 percent in 1956 to 39
percent in 1989 Despite these encouraging signs,
Freedman claimed that "it is not really time, as some
have argued . that we can let down our guard." To
stop affirmative-action policies now, Freedman stat
ed bluntly, "would be stupidity."
Affirmative action's effects on staff hiring were
elaborated upon by Rosa Gonzalez, associate director
of the Office for Multicultural Development. As of
August 1995, Stanford, the peninsula's fourth
largest employer, employed a staff of 66 percent
women and 32 percent minorities.
Development of staff is based upon analysis of
work force availability, not quotas, Gonzalez empha
sized. She said she feels that staff development efforts
to this point have been successful, but that the work
isn't done and Stanford faces challenges in managing,
maintaining and increasing diversity.
Law Prof Robert Weisberg, vice provost for facul
ty recruitment and development, spoke concerning
affirmative-action policies in faculty hiring. Accord
ing to Weisberg, a good affirmative-action plan
"doesn't constitute a single document . . . but rather
a set of understanding."
Weisberg then elaborated upon the existence of
the Faculty Incentive Fund at Stanford, which pro
vides rewards to schools and departments which hire
minorities.
Students had mixed reactions to the forum. Dur
ing a question and response period, sophomore Julie
Johnson, president of the Stanford College Republi
cans, questioned in an emotional manner how a uni
versity could admit one candidate over another just
because of a different piece of DNA.
How could this be fair, she asked, when others
equally qualified had worked many years in hopes of
achieving admission, only to be refused because of a
factor over which they have no control? In response,
Freedman conceded that affirmative action is not
without heartache.
