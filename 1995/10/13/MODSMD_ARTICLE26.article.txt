## Cardinal, Huskies to fight for Pac-10 positioning

Can they pull another white rabbit
out of their helmets?
Tomorrow at 2 p.m. at Stanford Sta
dium, No. 16 Stanford (4-0-1 overall, 2-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) faces off
against No. 24 Washington (3-2, 2-0).
With the game expected to be a close
one — Stanford is a one-point favorite
— the Cardinal may have to wave the
wand and bring up some more final
minute magic to take down the
Huskies.
"We've been a timely team," said
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "We've made big plays in the
fourth quarter to win.
"It would be better for everyone's
heart [if we didn't need toj. It is a con
cern — if you have a chance to put away
an opponent, you have to grab it."
Although the Cardinal hasn't been
blowing its opponents away, as far the
standings are concerned, it doesn't
matter. The best teams are good and
lucky.
"We're both," said senior wide
receiver Mark Harris. "We'd like to win
one easily, and we thought we might be
able to do that against ASU, but at least
we've won."
According to some, the close victo
ries may actually help Stanford's drive
to win. Not having posted a completely
convincing win, the team still searches
for such a triumph.
"At the start of the season, we were
hungry because we didn't get respect,"
said sophomore running back Anthony
Bookman. "That shouldn't change. 1
still don't feel like we've played our best
football."

Despite the team's belief that its best
days still lie ahead, the media has
ttlicuJy talking about bowl
games, conference championships and
matchups against USC. The Cardinal,
however, still has its eyes set on the
here and now.
"All we're talking about is Washing
ton," said senior left tackle Jeff Buckey.
"Some of the media is talking about
I bowl games), but we've got six games
left."
Willingham, for his part, is willing to
put up with the talk of bowl games as
long as it doesn't get in the way of actu
ally getting to one. "As long as it
doesn't become a distraction, it's fine,"
he said. "That's how you want your
team to be thought of — as a bowl
team."
Saturday's game marks the begin
ning of a three-game home stand for
the Cardinal. Four of Stanford's first
five games took place on the road. The
lone contest at Stanford Stadium was
the tie with Wisconsin before school
began, so the squad is looking forward
to finally playing in front of a friendly
crowd.
"It means a lot for our guys," Will
ingham said. "Hopefully, we'll have the
ability to draw upon the whole Bay
Area and show them that Stanford has
a good team, an exciting team and that
Stanford Stadium is a great place to
watch college football on a Saturday
afternoon."
Stanford's resilience on the road and
its undefeated record have certainly
impressed Washington head coach Jim
Lambright.
"What you're seeing is a credit to
how |the coaches] worked them in the
spring and the expectations they sent

them home over the summer with," he
said.
Lambright also believes that the way
in which Stanford has won games is a
positive one. "There's nothing like the
confidence of winning in the fourth
quarter," he said. "You'd like to do it
earlier, but as far as building character
goes, nothing does it faster."
The respect Lambright has devel
oped for Willingham's program is
mutual.
"(Washington| has an outstanding
program," Willingham said. "They've
been national champions in just the
past few years. They have good coach
ing and excellent players."
The Huskies were on NCAA proba
tion for the 1993 and 1994 seasons,
ineligible for the conference champi
onship and postseason competition. As
a result, they're hungry for the glory
they haven't been able to compete for.
Despite restrictions which have ham
pered its recruiting and the loss of all
time leading rusher Napoleon Kaufman
to the NFL's Oakland Raiders, Wash
ington is considered a contender for the
Pac-10 title in 1995.
Tomorrow's game will greatly influ
ence league standings. With both the
Huskies and the Cardinal 2-0 in the
conference, the winner will become the
front-running contender against USC
for the Pac-10 crown, while the loser
must play catch-up for the rest of the
season.
Although the all-time series stands
at 33-32-4, Washington has dominated
Stanford of late, winning 14 of the last
1(5 games. The Cardinal did manage to
take last year's meeting 46-28, break-
