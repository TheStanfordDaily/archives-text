# Cardinal kickers to face powerhouse Bulldogs on road
## 
### Alan Eaton Contributing writer 
If the fortunes of Stanford's
men's soccer team (3-7-1 overall,
0-0-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) were a boat, one
would have to say it's been rocked
consistently. Unfortunately for
Stanford, with an away match
against offensive juggernaut
Fresno State (8-3-0, 3-0-0), the
storm front may not clear up this
weekend.
Fresno State has been on the
ball as of late. The Bulldogs carry
a six-game win streak into today's
contest against Stanford. The
team last lost on Sept. 14 to t hen-
No. 10 Santa Clara.
Fresno State junior goalkeeper
J.J. Wozniak recorded two
shutouts last week, bringing his

season total to six. Wozniak
sports a gaudy 0.88 goals-against
average and has notched a
shutout in all three of the Bull
dogs' league games.
Senior forward Eric Farfan
and sophomore forward Bryan
Taylor lead Fresno State offen
sively. Farfan has scored six goals
and passed for two assists this
season, while Taylor has con
tributed three goals and four
assists. However, Farfan and
Taylor receive much help from a
team that has unleashed twice as
many shots and scored more than
twice the number of goals as its
opponents.
Fresno State leads the overall
series with the Cardinal 10-4-3,
although Stanford has won the
past two contests. Last year, the
Bulldogs were ranked in the top 10
when they came to the Farm, but
Stanford pulled off a tremendous
upset, winning 1-0.
"Fresno State is always a good
team," said sophomore midfielder
Kric Vandevelde "Because we beat
them hist year, they will probably
want revenge."
On the other side of the story,
Stanford has lost six of its past
seven games. The Cardinal is also
trying to recover from perhaps the
poorest weekend of soccer it has
played in the past few years. Head
coach Colin Lindores' hopes of
remaining competitive in league
play are still unrealized after Ore
gon State and Washington
swamped Stanford in conference
matches.
"During the games, we didn't
have enough intensity," Vande
velde said. "We weren't fighting for
the ball. We have to work on hold
ing off the other teams in the first
10 minutes of the game so we can
score first."
This past week, the Cardinal
went back to basics, according to
senior forward Ryan Estevez. "On
Tuesday we had the toughest prac -
tice of the year," he said. "It pro
moted physical play in hopes that
we step up the competitiveness.
"It's not going to be pretty soc
cer [against the Bulldogs]. The
most physical team will win."
