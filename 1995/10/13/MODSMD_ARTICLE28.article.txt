# Water polo looks for shocker at Cal
## Cardinal needs victory over Bears for playoff seeding, national ranking 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
It is not the Big Game. Yet in
a season where every match is
crucial to its quest for a third
consecutive national title, the
Stanford men's water polo team
will play a big game of its own as
it squares off tonight against
California.
The No. 3 Cardinal (12-4
overall, 2-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) is coming off
a heartbreaking overtime defeat
last Friday at the hands of then-
No. 1 USC. In that game, the
Cardinal wasted numerous
opportunities to win the game in
regulation, including nine man
up advantages, before the Tro
jans finally wrapped up the vic
tory. In addition to losing the
contest, Stanford blew an oppor
tunity to move into the top spot
in the national coaches poll.

Cal (13-2, 4-0), on the other
hand, is moving in the opposite
direction. The Bears were
ranked third in the nation last
week before they ambushed the
Trojans at the Spieker Aquatics
Complex in Berkeley last Satur
day. Cal thrashed the unsuspect
ing Trojans 12-7 to assume the
No. 1 position in the polls for the
second time this year.
The Cardinal cannot afford to
suffer the same fate as USC —
not now, and not for the rest of
the season.
"We just have to win every
game now," said head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "This is a
really critical game for us. We
are fairly solidly entrenched in
third place right now 1 in the
coaches poll]. Our backs are to
the wall."
Dettamanti again noted the
new format for the NCAA
Championship Tournament, in

which only four teams advance
to the championship round, as
opposed to eight in previous
years. Should the Cardinal
remain No. 3, it is almost certain

that the only way it could gain a
postseason berth is to win the

No. 3 water polo can stay afloat in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation with a win at Cal this weekend.
tion Conference Tournament at the
end of the season. Thus, the Cardi
nal needs to beat Cal in order to
either move up in the polls, or to at
least safeguard a decent seeding in
the league tourney.
"The conference championship
is going to be tough," Dettamanti
said. "Seeding i- s always so impor
tant in those tournaments. The
iK'tter seed you get, the less of the
high-caliber teams you have to
play."
Stanford and Cal have met twice
before this season and have split
the decisions. The Bears beat a
seemingly lifeless Cardinal early in
the season at the Southern Califor
nia Tournament, but Dettamanti's
squad returned the favor in impres
sive fashion at the Northern Cali
fornia Tournament two weeks ago.
"I expect a much tougher game
this time around," Dettamanti said.
"Cil is a formidable team, and they
will be ready for us. It is a lot differ

ent playing a team in a tourna
ment. You can't really prepare for a
particular team because you don't
know whom you are going to play.
This time, they have had all week to
practice."
In order to best the Bears, the
Cardinal will have to find a way to
stop a well-balanced Cal attack,
which boasts eight players with sea
sonal scoring totals in double digits.
The Bears are led offensively by
6-foot-6, 250-pound sophomore
Brent Albright. Albright is Cal's
primary two-meter man, and has
scored .'5l points, tops on the squad.
Last season, he also led the Bears
with 62 points. When the Cardinal
hist faced Albright, he notched four
goals in a losing effort.
"I would say Albright is one of
the top center-forwards in the
country," Dettamanti said "1 think
that 1 would put him right behind
[Stanford junior Brian] Wallin."
Wall in leads t he Cardinal in scoring
with 44 points in the team's Hi
games.
Cal also features junior Baran
Dilaver, who hails from Istanbul,
Turkey. 1 le rejoined (he Bears after

finally settling difficulties with his
foreign student registration.
Dilaver played in the Bears' last
contest against USC and was a
dominant force, scoring five goals.
According to Dettamanti, Cal
hits good depth off the bench, and
Bears head coach Steve Heaston
engages in heavy substitution dur
ing matches to keep his players rel
atively fresh. Heaston also has the
luxury of a fine corps of left-handed
players, which provide him with a
variety of offensive options ;uid a
great deal of flexibility.
The Cardinal, meanwhile, has
relied to a large extent on Wallin
and senior Jeremy Laster for all the
fireworks. Against the Trojans,
Wallin and Laster accounted for six
of the team's seven goals. Most
teams focus their defense on
Laster, who is a member of the U.S.
Nat ional Team. Such tactics should
create opportunities for other play
ers on Dettamanti's squad.
"We have to have guys score
other than Brian and Jeremy," Det
Uunanti said. "We need balance."
But the bottom line for the Car
dinal is execution. In its game

against USC, Stanford was able to
shutdown the Trojans' main
weapons, but was unable to take
advantage of numerous offensive
opportunities. Perhaps most disap
pointing was its 0-9 mark in 6-on-5
situations.
"We're going to try some new
things on 6-on-5s this game," Det
tamanti said. "We are going to try
to get Jeremy open on the perime
ter because he has such a good out
side shot. But the guvs are also
going to have to be careful on
defense because C'al likes to mix
things up a lot."
The game today could truly Ix- a
turning point for the Cardinal. A
loss would more than likely drop
Stanford down to No. 4 or No. 5,
while a victory could move Detta
manti's squad up to No. 2 and give
Stanford an edge over C'al in any
tie-breaking situations between the
two schools.
"We have been having good
practices this week," Dettamanti
said. "I think that the guys are
ready to go. I think that they under
stand now how important each
game is."
