# Water polo looks for shocker at Cal
## Cardinal needs victory over Bears for playoff seeding, national ranking 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
It is not the Big Game. Yet in
a season where every match is
crucial to its quest for a third
consecutive national title, the
Stanford men's water polo team
will play a big game of its own as
it squares off tonight against
California.
The No. 3 Cardinal (12-4
overall, 2-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) is coming off
a heartbreaking overtime defeat
last Friday at the hands of then-
No. 1 USC. In that game, the
Cardinal wasted numerous
opportunities to win the game in
regulation, including nine man
up advantages, before the Tro
jans finally wrapped up the vic
tory. In addition to losing the
contest, Stanford blew an oppor
tunity to move into the top spot
in the national coaches poll.

Cal (13-2, 4-0), on the other
hand, is moving in the opposite
direction. The Bears were
ranked third in the nation last
week before they ambushed the
Trojans at the Spieker Aquatics
Complex in Berkeley last Satur
day. Cal thrashed the unsuspect
ing Trojans 12-7 to assume the
No. 1 position in the polls for the
second time this year.
The Cardinal cannot afford to
suffer the same fate as USC —
not now, and not for the rest of
the season.
"We just have to win every
game now," said head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "This is a
really critical game for us. We
are fairly solidly entrenched in
third place right now 1 in the
coaches poll]. Our backs are to
the wall."
Dettamanti again noted the
new format for the NCAA
Championship Tournament, in

which only four teams advance
to the championship round, as
opposed to eight in previous
years. Should the Cardinal
remain No. 3, it is almost certain

that the only way it could gain a
postseason berth is to win the
