# Stanford women's volleyball on a tear
## Cardinal gets Pac-10 Conference hiatus as Houston rolls into Maples Pavilion 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
For most Stanford students,
following a schedule like that of
the Stanford women's volleyball
team the past three weeks would
resemble taking four classes that
each require weekly midterms.
With this kind of pace, any kind of
break would be welcomed with
open arms. After reeling off 10
consecutive victories, including
seven against ranked teams, to
firmly establish itself as the lead
er of the Pacific 10 Conference,
the Cardinal (13-2 overall, 9-0
Pac-10) finally gets a break as it
leaves the pressure of Pac-10
competition to play a non-confer

ence match tonight against Hous
ton ut Maples Pavilion.
"It's a pretty good time to play
non-conference games," said
Stanford coach Don Shaw. "We're
still trying to play well from start
to finish lin a match], and this
I weekend's contest I should help a
lot."
Despite Shaw's never-ending
desire for improvement, Stanford
is playing its best volleyball of the
season. After starting the season
by losing two of its first five
matches, the Cardinal has not lost
since. Stanford is coming off its
most impressive match in recent
memory, a 15-6, 15-6, 15-4
thrashing of California on the
road

"We've played well when we
had to this year, but we're still
working on playing well consis
tently, without letting down in
the middle of a match," Shaw
said. "(Tuesday 1, we did that
against Cal."
Against the Bears, the Cardi
nal showed that when it manages
to execute from start to finish,
most teams don't stand a chance.
Stanford hit an astonishing .326
as a team while holding Cal to a
dismal .049. The Cardinal also
totaled 14 blocks out of only 103
hitting attempts from the Bears
to dominate play defensively as
well.
Thus, while the game against
Houston may not mean much in

terms of overall standings, Shaw
will use the game to fine-tune
Stanford's game and to gain expe
rience facing an unknown oppo
nent.
"We know very little (about
Houston]," Shaw said. "From
their statistics, we know that they
only use a few players, but we
haven't been able to get that
much information about them."
In spite of such uncertainty,
Shnw feels that his team's play
will not suffer.
"It's not a big deal that we
don't know much about them,"
Shaw said. "We're pretty good at
making adjustments, and we
