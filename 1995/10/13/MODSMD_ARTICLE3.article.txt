# Affirmative action also includes jobs, grad students, Casper says
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper discussed his position on af
firmative action at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting, saying explic
itly that he supports affirmative ac
tion not only in undergraduate ad
missions, but in graduate admis
sions and employment as well.
Last week, Casper released a
speech detailing his support for af
firmative action. In it, he upheld
Stanford's undergraduate admis
sions policy, which targets specific
groups including African Ameri
cans, Chicanos / and Na
t ive Americans.
The current policy is a modern
restatement of the Founders' vi-

sion to make
Stanford a place
which tries to
eradicate social
stratification by
helping deserv
ing students
from all socioeco
nomic classes
learn how to be
come leaders in

all fields of society, Casper said.
Although there are problems
with the policy — such as the rigid
ity which is necessary for determin
ing racial categories — the advan
tages outweigh the disadvantages,
he added.
Casper said he directed his


Casper
speech to undergraduate admis
sions specifically since affirmative
action is the issue of greatest con
troversy as a result of the Univer
sity of California Regents' decision
to end the use of race and ethnicity
as factors in admissions decisions.
"The employment area is gov
erned mostly by federal law. We
are following federal law |in
upholding affirmative action),"
Casper said.
"Undergraduate admissions is
something we are doing voluntari
ly. It is also something in which we
can have complete uniformity
since the University as a whole
makes undergraduate admissions
decisions, while graduate admis
sions decisions are made by depart
ments and the requirements are
more specific," he said.
Casper said he thought his
statement would have little impact

on California politics, such as
upcoming measures like the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative. The
CCRI, which will be voted on in the
199(J statewide election, would
eliminate all affirmative-action
programs in the state govern
ment's hiring practices.
"My position on affirmative
action has been noted," Casper
said. "I hope that ;is many people
as possible will read it . . . but I do
not expect it to have a tremendous
amount of influence."
In other senate business, Edu
cation Prof. lah' Shulman present
ed the rejKirt of the Subcommittee
on Evaluation and Improvement
of Teaching, which he chaired. The
report advocates that more
resources be invested in teaching
and that teaching skills bo weight
ed more heavily in hiring and pro
motion decisions.
"There is a sense that we in the
University are doing teaching on
the side," Shulman said. "This
committee was charged to examine

the ways which teaching is . . .
evaluated and to improve the qual
ity of an evaluation system that
recognizes and rewards teaching."
Shulman's committee came up
with three recommendations:
changing the formal documenta
tion used in hiring and promotion
decisions to give more weight to
teaching; improving the services
encouraging and supporting teach
ing; and fostering a culture of
teaching.
Statistics Prof Bradley Efron
criticized the recommendations of
the committee, saying a greater
emphasis on teaching is inappro
priate.
"Teaching counts for one-third
as much as research [in appoint
ments and promotions]," Efron
said. "In a school that wants Nobel
Prizes and top-ranked depart
ments, teaching is never going to
count for more than that. Faculty
complain about evaluations like
students complain about finals,
but we do not eliminate finals."
