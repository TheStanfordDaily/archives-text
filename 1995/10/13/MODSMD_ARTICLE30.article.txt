# Smelling NorPac blood
## Field hockey looks to dominate Pacific once again 
### Alda Leu Contributing writer 
The Pacific Tigers have not scored a sin
gle goal against the Cardinal field hockey
team this year and has yet to prove itself
the most formidable of opponents. With a
record of 1-6 overall and a Northern Pacif
ic Conference showing of 0-4, they are
effectively out of the running for the con
ference championship.
But tomorrow at 11 a.m., Stanford field
hockey will meet up with Pacific at home
for the third time in conference play. Stan
ford (4-4, 3-1 NorPac) is tied with Califor
nia for the top spot in the three-team
league.
The two teams' previous confrontations
have been blowouts in favor of Stanford,
which won 3-0 on Sept. 23 and 5-0 on Oct.
3. Pacific has not been able to contend with
Stanford's awesome passing game and ver
satile players.

"We beat them by a significant margin
last time," said head coach Sheryl John
son. "We're not overlooking them, but
we're focusing more on our own game —
dominating our transition in midfield."
Injuries have plagued the Tigers this
season. In the last Stanford-Pacific game,
Pacific could muster only three substi
tutes. Yet, with a healthy team, it is diffi
cult to predict what the Tigers can accom
plish.
As for the Cardinal, its offense has
steadily improved this year. Stanford out
shot Pacific 43-2 last week Overall, in a
total of nine matches, including a scrim
mage, Stanford has consistently outshot
its opponents by a margin of almost 2-1.
The Cardinal averages 2.23 shots per game
and holds its opponents to .89.
As mentioned, however, despite such
glaring advantages, Stanford will not take
it easy this week. "We've been working just

as hard because we've been
building on our entire season,"
Johnson said.

Nonetheless, the Cardinal has
its eyes set on victory. "We expect
to dominate UOP," Johnson said.
Pacific will have to watch out
for freshman forward Carey
Cloyd, who has scored in both
contests against Pacific. Also,
Pacific must devise a way to

penetrate the Stanford defense
and get one past sophomore
goalkeeper Kelly Naylor.
Both of these tasks will be
difficult to accomplish, but the
Tigers are desperate for a win,
and they are running out of
chances to get one.

In what may prove to be a
more interesting matchup, the
Stanford will also compete
against returning alumni on
Sunday. In honor of Homecom
ing, former Stanford field hock
ey players will show their stuff
in an exhibition game at 2 p.m.
