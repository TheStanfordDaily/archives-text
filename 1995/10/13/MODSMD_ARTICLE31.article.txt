Live from Stanford Uni
versity, where a "mail
man" would most appro
priately be titled a "person per
son," it's another rendition of
the NCAA football picks of the
weekend, as forecasted this
week by Steve Stenstrom, for
mer Cardinal QB and current
$3-million, third-string play
maker with the Chicago Bears.
While these games have yet
to be decided, they are about to
be over-analyzed, ridiculed and
crudely anticipated by me and
my millionaire sidekick. Read
on for all the gory details.
Washington at Stanford
They'll be sticking pins in
my doll in the Cardinal locker
room, but I really think the
unbeaten streak will cease to
exist after tomorrow. There's
more than just a big bark and
bad breath to those Huskies â€”
there's a bite.
The Washington rushing
contingency could probably
pull an Iditerod sled 800 miles
across the Alaskan tundra bet
ter than a pack of the squad's
mascot canines. And with the
notable exception of the final
few minutes of the game, the
Huskies outpaced and out
played Notre Dame last week

end.
Steve gives his alma mater
the edge. "I'm impressed with
Stanford's ability to control the
football," he says."And the
defense has looked great."
No doubt this year's squad
is playing a different game
than Steve's teams did in the
past few years. And this game
is winnable by the Cardinal.
But it will take a better effort
than the by-the-skin-of-your
teeth win over ASU last week
end.
The Cardinal offense seems
to stall at the wrong times. And
while Steve's psychic talents
are at work here today, his
football talents are often sorely
missed on the Stanford grid
iron.
Nevertheless, Steve wishes
his former squad the very best
of luck in this weekend's con
test. "I'm very happy for what
they have accomplished," he
says.
I feel for the team, too. That
goose egg in the loss column
was nice while it lasted, but
undefeated streaks are rarely
as continuous as the number
zero.
