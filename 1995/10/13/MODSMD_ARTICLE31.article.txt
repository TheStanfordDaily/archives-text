Live from Stanford Uni
versity, where a "mail
man" would most appro
priately be titled a "person per
son," it's another rendition of
the NCAA football picks of the
weekend, as forecasted this
week by Steve Stenstrom, for
mer Cardinal QB and current
$3-million, third-string play
maker with the Chicago Bears.
While these games have yet
to be decided, they are about to
be over-analyzed, ridiculed and
crudely anticipated by me and
my millionaire sidekick. Read
on for all the gory details.
Washington at Stanford
They'll be sticking pins in
my doll in the Cardinal locker
room, but I really think the
unbeaten streak will cease to
exist after tomorrow. There's
more than just a big bark and
bad breath to those Huskies —
there's a bite.
The Washington rushing
contingency could probably
pull an Iditerod sled 800 miles
across the Alaskan tundra bet
ter than a pack of the squad's
mascot canines. And with the
notable exception of the final
few minutes of the game, the
Huskies outpaced and out
played Notre Dame last week

end.
Steve gives his alma mater
the edge. "I'm impressed with
Stanford's ability to control the
football," he says."And the
defense has looked great."
No doubt this year's squad
is playing a different game
than Steve's teams did in the
past few years. And this game
is winnable by the Cardinal.
But it will take a better effort
than the by-the-skin-of-your
teeth win over ASU last week
end.
The Cardinal offense seems
to stall at the wrong times. And
while Steve's psychic talents
are at work here today, his
football talents are often sorely
missed on the Stanford grid
iron.
Nevertheless, Steve wishes
his former squad the very best
of luck in this weekend's con
test. "I'm very happy for what
they have accomplished," he
says.
I feel for the team, too. That
goose egg in the loss column
was nice while it lasted, but
undefeated streaks are rarely
as continuous as the number
zero.

Washington State at USC
A deep-rooted dislike for the
Trojans is beginning to become a
regularity with my guest prognosti
cators, and Steve Stenstrom is no
exception to that rule of thumb.
Hut, like most rational haters of
SC, Steve realizes that the Trojan
game is on the mark.
"I have never been an SC fan,"
he says. "But as much as I hate to
say it, they're playing well. They
might even make a run at the
national championship."
First the squad will make a run
over the Cougars in Los Angeles
this weekend, where USC should
extend its perfect season and give
WSU the first pimple on its previ
ously unmarred complexion.
The Cougars will try to assassi
nate the Trojan secondary with its
passing game, which racked up 420
yards last weekend. But WSU's
best rushers couldn't outrun a ball
and-chained sloth, so if USC can
clog the midfield and control the
airspace, the fat lady will sing
before the opening kick.

Oregon at Cal
Steve says that "Cal hasn't
shown the ability to win late in a
game." I say the Golden (or per
haps yellowish) Bears haven't
shown ability, period.
Cal averaged less than two yards
per rush against USC last week
end, and QB Pat Barnes found his
target on only 48 percent of his
passes while finding USC targets
twice. The Bears limited Keyshawn
Johnson to only 57 yards on five
receptions, so the Trojans found
another way — they brought out
seven other guys who caught at
least one pass for 10 yards or more.
Fortunately for the Ducks, USC
does not show up on their schedule
this season. All that means is that
Oregon might fly through the year
without another conference loss
and quack like crazy at the end of
the season because they won't get a
chance to prove themselves against
the Pac-10 champion Trojans.
After mutilating Pacific last
weekend in a game that annually
turns out to be the best cure
around for insomnia, the Ducks are

flying south to keep alive their
repeat Rose Bowl hopes. Too bad
they are as dead as King Tut.
A bit of advice for Gang Green:
tourniquet the wound of the loss to
Stanford and hope the Rose Bowl
appendage won't be amputated
entirely in the next two weeks.

Arizona at UCIJ\
The once-ferocious Bruins are
now lamely searching for their first
conference victory of the year
against the Wildcats in Westwood.
At 3-2, both teams desperately
need a win in order to keep bowl
ball in their future.
Steve knows that Bruin QB
Brad Otton won't be facing the
same smothering attack on the ball
that Stenstrom played against
while at Stanford. "It just isn't the
same defense," he says.
That may be true, but UCLA
has allowed 62 points in its two
conferences losses, two-thirds of
their five-game total of 100, and
Arizona is second in the Pac-10 in
fewest points allowed all year.
The Bruins are out of gas, flat
tened by their earlv-season rise to
the top and the accompanying fall
from grace. I've seen an engine-less
1960 VW Bug with more drive than
the Bruins have now.

Oklahoma vs. Texas
The annual Cotton Bowl melee
takes place this weekend in Dallas.
As a native Oklahoman, I'd be bet
ting against my future and liveli
hood by dooming the Sooners. But
you just can't deny gut feelings.
Although Texas gave up 428
yards of offense to the Rice Owls,
Oklahoma is still dejected from the
Colorado loss and knows a loss to
Nebraska is coming.
Steve isn't a Longhorn fanatic,
and he thinks OU coach Howard
Schnellenberger "has got them
going in the right direction."
As the child of two Oklahoma
graduates, my parents would dis
own me for publicly degrading
their alma mater. Looks like I
won't be sending a copy of my arti
cle home this week.
