Iget galvanic on one thing and one thing
only and it ain't in this month's Interna
tional Male catalogue. It ain't beefcake. It
ain't moussed chest hair. And it sure as hell-o
kitty ain't testosterone-pumped 'nads of steel.
What gets my womanhood all in a lather
(sistahs, you know what I'm dishin' about) is
something rad, bitchin' and totally-fallopian
tubular-to-the-max: Lunettes Eyeglasses.
Spectacles.
Sssssssspws (phonic pun intended|.
Those optometrist-prescribed windshields
get me at witter harder than Bjork on 14
ounces of ginseng. Those thin wire frames
and nose-straddling metal bridges elicit a
voltage so potent it's NC-17, so seething it
stars a lap-dancing Elizabeth Berkley in a
mohair G-string, and so erotic it could make
Annie Sprinkle blush in Victorian shame.
Now, this eyewear fetishist is NOT spew
ing forth to laud the virility of the latest eye
wear fad to leap out of GQ — those dreadful
"wraparound" sunglasses.
Wraparounds, so blatant in its attempt to
harness the same cyher-than-thou attitude
that flopped with "Hackers," resembles
nothing hut a black streamlined Infiniti,
suggesting that beneath those darkened
lenses is nothing but a flat naugahyde dash
board.
Nor is this eyewear fetishist praising the
one-way mirrored lenses of those aviator Ray
Bans. The desire to wear such ludicrous
facegear must be some sort of andro-regres
sion, a retreat to silly boychild fantasy, a

desire to be Kelly McGillis' Top Gun or,
worse, a phatter-than-Estrada CHiP. Oak
leys, so obvious in its man - machine, hard
edged male = RoboStud connotations, can
also join this list of detestable eyewear.
But, I digress. The reason why I'm defam
ing valuable Daily copy space is so I can rant
about something totally different.
Restraint is sexy.
Keeping one's distance is in itself a very
flirtatious act. And thin wire spectacles (the
veil of antiglamour scholasticism for that
Eastern European Intelligentsia K> type who
sits behind you in psych section, you know
the one) exhibits this distanced restraint.
Quite unlike the wraparounds which
strive so desperately to be mysterious, those
who brandish a pair of' wire frames have a
sort of ambiguity ... a sort of je tw sais quoi,
a sort of je ne sais pas, a sort of je suis un
pizza. Their specs reveal just enough to
tempt yet, at the same time, conceal just
enough to taunt the wandering eyes of any
curious femme vitale.
Whereas wraparounds intimidate, these
nose-straddling babies entice. They croon in a
barely audible whisper: "Come h-h-hither . . .
if you're into Glenn Gould, Sartre and getting
Nutella smeared all over your naked bum."
Being intrinsically laden with symbolism,
eyeglasses cannot help but exist as a madden
ing entity. They connote boyish whimsy,
revealing how the wearer can't let go of this
cumbersome boyhood relic and probably
won't graduate to forms of higher optometry

(i.e. contact lenses). Spectacles also connote
an understated approachability. This
approachability (which Oakley wearers will
never get) increases the wearer's chances of
attracting women thus increasing his chances
of getting a date thus increasing his chances
to woo thus increasing his chances to display
his winning charm thus increasing his
chances of gettin' some nookie (which Oakley
wearers will never get).
To others, spectacles represent a wind
shield of restraint. This lenscrafted shield is
necessary to hold back the seething manhood
of its wearer who is soooooo sexy he has to
wear them as a buffer.
Stripped of its latent associations, 1 must
admit that spectacles are nothing more than
mere training wheels for the peepers. But
even that contains a certain charm. As the
popularity of the disgustingly-cute clumsy
antics of Hugh Grant can attest to, women
adore ineptitude in men. The gawkier the
gent, the more ga-ga we get. Fumble over
your glasses and we'll tumble 4 va.
But I have failed to mention the sexiest
thing about spectacles.
You can take them off.

Wraparounds, so blatant in its attempt to
harness the same cyher-than-thou attitude
that flopped with "Hackers," resembles
nothing hut a black streamlined Infiniti,
suggesting that beneath those darkened
lenses is nothing but a flat naugahyde dash
board.
Nor is this eyewear fetishist praising the
one-way mirrored lenses of those aviator Ray
Bans. The desire to wear such ludicrous
facegear must be some sort of andro-regres
sion, a retreat to silly boychild fantasy, a

desire to be Kelly McGillis' Top Gun or,
worse, a phatter-than-Estrada CHiP. Oak
leys, so obvious in its man - machine, hard
edged male = RoboStud connotations, can
also join this list of detestable eyewear.
But, I digress. The reason why I'm defam
ing valuable Daily copy space is so I can rant
about something totally different.
Restraint is sexy.
Keeping one's distance is in itself a very
flirtatious act. And thin wire spectacles (the
veil of antiglamour scholasticism for that
Eastern European Intelligentsia K> type who
sits behind you in psych section, you know
the one) exhibits this distanced restraint.
Quite unlike the wraparounds which
strive so desperately to be mysterious, those
who brandish a pair of' wire frames have a
sort of ambiguity ... a sort of je tw sais quoi,
a sort of je ne sais pas, a sort of je suis un
pizza. Their specs reveal just enough to
tempt yet, at the same time, conceal just
enough to taunt the wandering eyes of any
curious femme vitale.
Whereas wraparounds intimidate, these
nose-straddling babies entice. They croon in a
barely audible whisper: "Come h-h-hither . . .
if you're into Glenn Gould, Sartre and getting
Nutella smeared all over your naked bum."
Being intrinsically laden with symbolism,
eyeglasses cannot help but exist as a madden
ing entity. They connote boyish whimsy,
revealing how the wearer can't let go of this
cumbersome boyhood relic and probably
won't graduate to forms of higher optometry

(i.e. contact lenses). Spectacles also connote
an understated approachability. This
approachability (which Oakley wearers will
never get) increases the wearer's chances of
attracting women thus increasing his chances
of getting a date thus increasing his chances
to woo thus increasing his chances to display
his winning charm thus increasing his
chances of gettin' some nookie (which Oakley
wearers will never get).
To others, spectacles represent a wind
shield of restraint. This lenscrafted shield is
necessary to hold back the seething manhood
of its wearer who is soooooo sexy he has to
wear them as a buffer.
Stripped of its latent associations, 1 must
admit that spectacles are nothing more than
mere training wheels for the peepers. But
even that contains a certain charm. As the
popularity of the disgustingly-cute clumsy
antics of Hugh Grant can attest to, women
adore ineptitude in men. The gawkier the
gent, the more ga-ga we get. Fumble over
your glasses and we'll tumble 4 va.
But I have failed to mention the sexiest
thing about spectacles.
You can take them off.
