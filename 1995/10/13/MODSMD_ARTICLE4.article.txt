# Few Fac Sen concerns over change in donations policy
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
In an efTort to delay cuts to
academic programs, University
budget officials announced yes
terday that a port ion of virtually
all restricted donations will be di
verted to the University's gener
al fund.
The new policy will allow the
University to partially recoup the

infrastructure costs associated
with the projects funded by such
gifts and will help offset decreas
es in indirect-cost revenues.
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Dean of Research Charles
Kruger clarified the implementa
tion of the policy and the history
behind it at the first Faculty Sen
ate meeting of the academic year.
"The net effect of this action will
mean the budgets in the schools will
be stronger in fiscal 1997 than in
other times," Kruger said.
Beginning next year, 6 percent of
private donations will be trans
ferred to the University's general
fund to reimburse maintenance and
custodial costs resulting from ear
marked donations. The only direct
ed donations exempt from the policy
are for financial aid, faculty salaries,
building costs and undergraduate
research.
A second new policy, to begin in
1997, will transfer the interest
e«irned by donations not immediate

ly spent to the general fund. The
Board of Trustees approved the
policies in its June meeting.
"Donors make expendable gifts
with the expectation that generally,
the entire amount will be spent rel
atively soon," Rice said. "That is
generally the cast 1 ." When it is not,
however, the resulting interest will
cover the University's general oper
ating costs.
Although the amount which the
University receives from the feder
al government has not decreased,
the indirect-cost rate has dropped,
resulting in the loss of millions of
dollars, Kruger said. In addition,
the federal government has placed
more restrictions on the use of its
grants, while Congress is consider
ing decreasing federal funding of
student financial aid in next year's

budget.
"The total funds coming in for
research are not changed in real dol
lars," Kruger said. "It's where the
money can l)e spent."
While past decreases have obvi
ously impacted University
resources, Rice said administrators
are more concerned with the out
come of the federal budget, which,
in addition to affecting financial aid,
could also reduce government fund
ing for University research. Follow
ing t he meeting, Rice flew to Wash
ington where she will meet with Ivy
League provosts and lobby to pre
vent educational cuts.
The policy's only negative ramifi
cation is that the University will
appear wealthier than it is, Univer
sity President Gerhard Casfx-r said.
Because a portion of the restricted

funds will bo transferred to the gen
eral budget, the University will
seem to have more money.
"It's a tremendously distorting
factor," Casper said. "We don't
want that. 1 don't like that change."
While the faculty — who will lx i
most afi'ected by the change through
research funding ruts — had specif
ic questions on the {xilicy, senate
members expressed few strong opin
ions. Philosophy Prof. John Perry
lauded the policy, explaining that
the (> percent figure was enough to
make a difference to the University
but not enough to seriously affect
research.
Responding to a concern over the
necessity of the decision, Casper
said that because the administrative
budget am no longer be decreased,
academics would suffer without the

new donations policy.
"As federal support is shrinking
and as wo have made very substan
tial cuts from the center, the fact of
the matter is that if we are forced to
make further cuts, academic pro
grams will be affected. There's no
illusion about that," Casper said.
Concerns have prompted admin
istrators to cut more than $50 mil
lion over the last four years. In addi
tion, $12 million will Ih* cut next
year. Currently, the University
bears the infrastructure costs of pri
vate grants from its general fund.
How donors will respond to this
policy change, Rice said, is contin
gent upon how the faculty portrays
it. "When a faculty member
explains that this is a legitimate
support by the University ... I
believe the donor is going to under-
