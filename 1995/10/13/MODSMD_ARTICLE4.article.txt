In an efTort to delay cuts to
academic programs, University
budget officials announced yes
terday that a port ion of virtually
all restricted donations will be di
verted to the University's gener
al fund.
The new policy will allow the
University to partially recoup the

infrastructure costs associated
with the projects funded by such
gifts and will help offset decreas
es in indirect-cost revenues.
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Dean of Research Charles
Kruger clarified the implementa
tion of the policy and the history
behind it at the first Faculty Sen
ate meeting of the academic year.
