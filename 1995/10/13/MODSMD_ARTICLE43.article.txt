# Off and running: using the CPPC
## 
### Elise Wolfgram 
So you want a positive cash flow,
health benefits and company par
ties and picnics. You want to leave
the cozy world of academics and become
one of those suits who eats frozen TV
dinners because you're too tired to cook.
And you're really hoping that the
$100,000 your parents forked over will
pay off.
Well, your plan just may work out
with a little effort on your part. In fact,
finding a job is more time consuming
than it is difficult. And knowing where
to start is a hig part of the answer.
The best place at Stanford to get
started is the Career Planning and
Placement Center, which is located next
to the Clock Tower near White Plaza.
The Cl'P(' is not just a haven for invest
ment banker wannabes, but has loads
on information on everything from pub
lic service careers to alumni contacts.
The easiest way to become familiar
with the CPPC is to attend a "Getting
Started at the CPPC" workshop. The
half-hour session includes a slide show
and a tour of the CPP(' (there is no tour
for introductions held outside of the
CPPC). Upcoming workshops at the
CPPC will be held on Oct. 16 and Oct.
20.
Once you're familiar with the
CPPC's resources and layout, it's best
just to dive in and start figuring out
what you want to do, what kind of com
pany you would like to work for, and
where you want to be. There are numer
ous resources within the CPPC to help
you with this.
One option is to sign up for a work
shop on the Strong Interest Inventory
This may help you better define careers
that are well-suited for you. The next
inventory workshop is on Oct. 18. You
can also learn to understand your per
sonal style as it relates to work environ
ment and career decision-making issues
by signing up for an introductory work
shop to the Myers-Briggs Type
Indicator, held Nov. 8.
The CPPC also offers counseling for
job hunters. These sessions come in two
forms: 45-minute sessions with a CPPC
counselor and same-day, 15 minute
appointments for quick questions. The
longer session is intended to help stu
dents assess their interests, skills and
values; identify goals and objectives;
translate that information into a mean
ingful career or first job; and help the
student understand the nuts and bolts
of obtaining such a job. Appointments

for either type of counseling can be
made by calling 725-1789. Same-day
appointments fill up early, so it's best to
call right when the CPPC opens at 8:30
a.m.
Another great resource the CPPC has
to offer is the Career Resource Library.
The library has two main parts, both of
which are very useful to job hunters.
The Career Exploration area contains
background information on hundreds of
careers and is aimed at helping you fig
ure out what you want to do.
Once you know what careers you are
interested in, it's probably time to move
on to the job search area of the library.
Also included in the Career Exploration
area are handouts on careers by major,
and information on alumni to contact.
Several fields are covered, including
Arts / Media / Communication; Business;
Education, Engineering Computer Science;
Environment; Ilealth / Sciences / Biotech;
Law; and Public Service.

It's best just to dive in
and start figuring out
what you want to do,
where you want to he.

In the job search area, there are
hinders of currently available jobs, both
full-time and part-time. In addition,
there are several "how-to" bonks on
writing resumes and cover letters and
finding employment in specific geo
graphical areas.
Other resources in the library include
a media room with audiotapes of several
important CI'PC events, the Rainbow
File (which includes information on
over 500 selected nonprofit and public
organizations), and Multicultural
Resources, which is aimed at helping
students in minority communities.
After searching through piles of
binders, many students decide to take
part in on-campus recruiting. Over 400
companies and organizations — in fields
ranging from management consulting to
engineering — come to Stanford each
year with the hopes of hiring a few soon
to-be graduates.
In order to participate in on campus
recruiting, students must attend a 90-
minute introduction or watch a video
tape of the introduction to take part in
the program. Introductory sessions con-

eluded last week, hut a videotape will be
shown on Oct. 16 at noon.
Students who take part in on-campus
recruiting should begin doing their
research now. Interviews begin on Oct.
23 and will continue until the end of the
year. There are two ways to get an inter
view at the CPPC: through Employer
Pre-select, where the company chooses
to interview you, and through a bid
process, under which you gamble points
in order to get an interview. More infor
mation on this process is available at the
CPPC.
Recruiting, contrary to popular
belief, is not the foremost way students
find jobs. As far as careers in public ser
vice go, the CPPC will hold a public ser
vice career and internship faire during
the winter. There will also be a work
shop on "Breaking in to a Public Service
Career" on Oct. 17.
The CPPC also hosts World
Opportunities Week from Nov. 7-10.
The week includes numerous work
shops on topics such as international
law, international public service and
opportunities abroad for recent gradu
ates.
In addition to the CPPC, a similar
organization, the Career Action Center
in Palo Alto, can assist you in your
search for the wonder-job. The center
has an extensive library, company
descriptions and job listings.
The center also maintains network
ing groups and offers workshops on
such topics as creativity, the biotech
industry, international marketing and
career mastery for African Americans.
The Career Action Center is located
at 445 Sherman Ave. in Palo Alto and is
open Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday and
Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and
Saturday, for members only, from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. Fees are charged to use the
center: one-year memberships cost $65,
and one-day user fees are $10. There is a
30-minute orientation every day at 10
a.m. Students should call 324-1710 for
more information.
Regardless of the route students plan
to take to find a job after graduation, the
most important tiling is to start early. A
typical job search lasts several months
and can take up to a year or more.
Finally, keep in mind that your first
job after Stanford probably won't be
your last. In fact, the typical Stanford
grad stays at his or her first job for only
two years. And every experience counts.

File (which includes information on
over 500 selected nonprofit and public
organizations), and Multicultural
Resources, which is aimed at helping
students in minority communities.
After searching through piles of
binders, many students decide to take
part in on-campus recruiting. Over 400
companies and organizations — in fields
ranging from management consulting to
engineering — come to Stanford each
year with the hopes of hiring a few soon
to-be graduates.
In order to participate in on campus
recruiting, students must attend a 90-
minute introduction or watch a video
tape of the introduction to take part in
the program. Introductory sessions con-

eluded last week, hut a videotape will be
shown on Oct. 16 at noon.
Students who take part in on-campus
recruiting should begin doing their
research now. Interviews begin on Oct.
23 and will continue until the end of the
year. There are two ways to get an inter
view at the CPPC: through Employer
Pre-select, where the company chooses
to interview you, and through a bid
process, under which you gamble points
in order to get an interview. More infor
mation on this process is available at the
CPPC.
Recruiting, contrary to popular
belief, is not the foremost way students
find jobs. As far as careers in public ser
vice go, the CPPC will hold a public ser
vice career and internship faire during
the winter. There will also be a work
shop on "Breaking in to a Public Service
Career" on Oct. 17.
The CPPC also hosts World
Opportunities Week from Nov. 7-10.
The week includes numerous work
shops on topics such as international
law, international public service and
opportunities abroad for recent gradu
ates.
In addition to the CPPC, a similar
organization, the Career Action Center
in Palo Alto, can assist you in your
search for the wonder-job. The center
has an extensive library, company
descriptions and job listings.
The center also maintains network
ing groups and offers workshops on
such topics as creativity, the biotech
industry, international marketing and
career mastery for African Americans.
The Career Action Center is located
at 445 Sherman Ave. in Palo Alto and is
open Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday and
Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and
Saturday, for members only, from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. Fees are charged to use the
center: one-year memberships cost $65,
and one-day user fees are $10. There is a
30-minute orientation every day at 10
a.m. Students should call 324-1710 for
more information.
Regardless of the route students plan
to take to find a job after graduation, the
most important tiling is to start early. A
typical job search lasts several months
and can take up to a year or more.
Finally, keep in mind that your first
job after Stanford probably won't be
your last. In fact, the typical Stanford
grad stays at his or her first job for only
two years. And every experience counts.
So you want a positive cash flow,
health benefits and company par
ties and picnics. You want to leave
the cozy world of academics and become
one of those suits who eats frozen TV
dinners because you're too tired to cook.
And you're really hoping that the
$100,000 your parents forked over will
pay off.
Well, your plan just may work out
with a little effort on your part. In fact,
finding a job is more time consuming
than it is difficult. And knowing where
to start is a hig part of the answer.
The best place at Stanford to get
started is the Career Planning and
Placement Center, which is located next
to the Clock Tower near White Plaza.
The Cl'P(' is not just a haven for invest
ment banker wannabes, but has loads
on information on everything from pub
lic service careers to alumni contacts.
The easiest way to become familiar
with the CPPC is to attend a "Getting
Started at the CPPC" workshop. The
half-hour session includes a slide show
and a tour of the CPP(' (there is no tour
for introductions held outside of the
CPPC). Upcoming workshops at the
CPPC will be held on Oct. 16 and Oct.
20.
Once you're familiar with the
CPPC's resources and layout, it's best
just to dive in and start figuring out
what you want to do, what kind of com
pany you would like to work for, and
where you want to be. There are numer
ous resources within the CPPC to help
you with this.
One option is to sign up for a work
shop on the Strong Interest Inventory
This may help you better define careers
that are well-suited for you. The next
inventory workshop is on Oct. 18. You
can also learn to understand your per
sonal style as it relates to work environ
ment and career decision-making issues
by signing up for an introductory work
shop to the Myers-Briggs Type
Indicator, held Nov. 8.
The CPPC also offers counseling for
job hunters. These sessions come in two
forms: 45-minute sessions with a CPPC
counselor and same-day, 15 minute
appointments for quick questions. The
longer session is intended to help stu
dents assess their interests, skills and
values; identify goals and objectives;
translate that information into a mean
ingful career or first job; and help the
student understand the nuts and bolts
of obtaining such a job. Appointments

for either type of counseling can be
made by calling 725-1789. Same-day
appointments fill up early, so it's best to
call right when the CPPC opens at 8:30
a.m.
Another great resource the CPPC has
to offer is the Career Resource Library.
The library has two main parts, both of
which are very useful to job hunters.
The Career Exploration area contains
background information on hundreds of
careers and is aimed at helping you fig
ure out what you want to do.
Once you know what careers you are
interested in, it's probably time to move
on to the job search area of the library.
Also included in the Career Exploration
area are handouts on careers by major,
and information on alumni to contact.
Several fields are covered, including
Arts / Media / Communication; Business;
Education, Engineering Computer Science;
Environment; Ilealth / Sciences / Biotech;
Law; and Public Service.

It's best just to dive in
and start figuring out
what you want to do,
where you want to he.

In the job search area, there are
hinders of currently available jobs, both
full-time and part-time. In addition,
there are several "how-to" bonks on
writing resumes and cover letters and
finding employment in specific geo
graphical areas.
Other resources in the library include
