# 2001: A JOB-HUNTER'S ODYSSEY
## 
### ANDY DWORKIN 
Yeah, 1 had it made. Good
resume — fellowship,
scholarship, good work,
solid recs, Stanford degree. 1
was all set to storm the corpo
rate world. I figured 1 could
[lick my job, name my hours,
even dress casual.
1 was wrong.
As it turns out, all those
things mean nothing these
days. In a plot that ranks right
up there with One World
Government, sleek black heli
copters and the Red Army con
ducting house-to-house
searches in Louisiana, the
powers-t hat-be have redefined
"well-qualified." Forget your
sheepskin and Phi Beta Kappa
pin. Computers and pop psy
chology now rule the world of
corporate hiring. The
Unabomber's direst predic
tions have come true.
Two recent articles detail
this trend.
First, Time magazine
informed America (at least
those of us with seventh
grade reading levels) that
what separates the men from
the bovs in corporate America
is something called "EQ" —
shorthand for emotional
intelligence. With the same
discernment shown in the
"Cyberporn" issue, the week
ly asserted that big businesses
like Met Life now see sensi
tive optimists as the best
employees. Pliant and polite,
they know how to succeed in
business (without really try
ing). Shari Lewis, apparently,
is the Platonic form of life
insurance salesman.
Then, the San Jose
Mercury News reported that
some companies are saving
man-hours by having a com
puter read resumes. At a
breakneck pace, the scanner
searches for key words:
responsible, million, Versace,
submissive. Impassive, the
machine weaves, measures
and cuts the threads of '200
applicants every second. Stop
worrying about the inter
view, start guessing a
ScanTron's vocabulary.
These facts worried me. I
sprang into action. I turned

to the comics page. I read
Dilbert.
I decided to change my
resume. 1 rushed to my com
puter.
Just below my name I had
written, "Objective: To make
enough money to pay the rent,
eat, maybe have a little left
over for Saturday night This
I deleted.
In its place, I typed tin' fol
lowing: "Key Word Summary:
Sensitive, touching, feelings,
Pollyanna, expert in diversity,
team building, cost avoidance."
I mailed out a new batch of
resumes, and waited
The phone rang. I started
out of a fitful slumber, sending
a little cord of saliva flying
across the room. "Hello"'"

It was a computer.
"Sarah Connor?"
"Who?" I yawned.
"Is this Dworkin, Andrew
James, SSN 862-26-6237?"
"Yes." I croaked. "Look, if
this is some kind of poll . .
The thing interrupted. "My
name is Herald. I represent
Kaiser Permanente. We have
found you eager and caring,
positive and malleable. You
should do nicely. We would like
bring you in . for an inter
view "
I reached to turn on the
light, knocking my talking
clock off the bed. "Bing. It is
1 15," my clock said.
"1:15 would be fine, said the
machine. "How's Thursday?
Wait, hold on, I've got another
call .. Hello? Thursday after

noon, then. Bo prompt."
As it hung up on me, I
heard the computer say some
thing to the other caller. It
sounded like, "Tell me what
you're wearing."
There exists another new
trend in the corporate world
the interview as
Inquisition. No longer content
to discuss your past, inter
viewers feel the need to
"throw you a few curveballs,"
the corporate equivalent of fir
ing a few rounds at your feet
and sneering, "Dance."
I arrived at the skyscraper.
The front door slid open auto
matically, as did the elevator
door. "What floor?" asked the
elevator.
"Thirteen," I said.
Upstairs, I was led into a
room with a long table, dark,
so you couldn't see the cor
ners. I sat in the lone wooden
chair. Someone turned on a
bright light, which shined
down into my eyes. I had to
squint hard.
"Good afternoon, Mr.
Dworkin." It was a man's
voice, from the far end of the
table. "My name is Mr.
Stepford. I have some ques
tions I'd like to ask you."
"Well, I tried it once in col
lege, but I didn't inhale."
lie did not sound amused.
"Answer these questions as
best you can. I'lease tell me
the thought process that led
you to your answer. It makes
for good stories in the lunch
room. Ready? How many bak
ers are there in America?"
My mind worked furiously:
Jim, Anita, Tammy Faye,
maybe a dozen more. Maybe
10,000. Obviously, somebody
was dealing with an idiot. The
quest ion was, which one of us?
I decided to use an old CIV
trick: lying.
"Contrary to appearances,
free will could not exist in a
Cartesian universe," I said. I
heard him flinch. Score one
for a Stanford education.
He fought back.
"You're in a desert, walking
along in the sand, when all of
a sudden you look down and
you see a tortoise. It's crawl
ing toward you. How many
