# From policy making...
## ...to the Peace Corps 
### Tish Williams 
Public service is not a four-letter
word.
When you think of public service,
does the image of you and your
Stanford diploma digging latrines for
the Peace Corps in the 120-degree
heat of Bangladesh come to mind? The
face of your crying mother as she
explains to the neighbors between
sobs that you couldn't cut it in corpo
rate America? An exclusively Taco Bell
diet, all from the 59-cent menu?
Snap out of it.
Public service careers, long stigma
tized in the wheeling-dealing deca
dence of the 1980s, are often a useful
wa\ to gain prime management expe
rience in a short amount of time.
Though average workers involved in

public service only make three-quar
ters of a typical business-sector salary,
their service work is a useful tool for
acquiring skills needed for future
employment.
According to Anne Greenblatt, in
charge of public service career counseling
at the CPPC, around one in four stu
dents who comes to the CPPC for help
examines the public-service sector.
Nationwide, she estimates, about 18-'2()
percent of college graduates go into pub
lic service yearly.
"A recent graduate gets a variety of
experience, usually gets more responsibili
ty and a sense that they're doing something
for the planet," Greenblatt said. "But pub
lic service jobs aren 't for everyone. I usual
ly ask students their interests."
A personal interest assessment is a
key step into discovering if such employ
ment would be right for you. If high
salaries and prestigious companies are
more in tune with your employment
goals, public service might not be a good
area to get into. However, if a workable
salary, the chance to help others and an
often-higher degree of authority catch
your eye, it would definitely be advisable
to investigate public-service jobs as you
hit the CPPC in your job quest.
Classified generally under the broad
categories of jobs in non-profit organiza
tions or government work — at the com
munity, state or national level — public
service careers also include a wide variety
of employment options for future gradu
ates.
Non-profit-organization work tends
toward the more traditional view of pub

lie service employment. People in such
groups are usually in direct contact with
the groups they serve, on a more com
munity-based level
Workers in these types of jobs are
involved in providing direct help for oth
ers, as in the frequently cited example of
the Peace Corps teaching English in
foreign countries, working in health edu
cation, etc. or more locally for groups
working in AIDS education or with envi
ronmental issues.
These are only a few examples of a
very wide range of potential employment
opportunities which also include working
with youth populations, health educa
tion, women's issues and reproduction
rights, among other topics. Within all
non-profit organizations there are differ
ent types of jobs as well. A graduate
might be involved in a hands-on task
such as teaching, but might also be
involved in the management, develop
ment or improvement of the type of help
given by the group or the structuring of
the organization itself. All such activities
help the graduate acquire needed work
place experience, and often give him or
her more power than could he found
climbing the first two years' worth of the
corporate ladder.
Government work, an example of the
more theoretical side of public service,
encompasses a broad scope of employ
ment rancinc from work on Capitol Hill

to jobs in think tanks and policy mak
ing.
These jobs are typically considered to
be working at a distance from a given
issue in order to benefit people on a
more basic level by dealing with a sys
tem which influences such groups.
Such work might feature developing a
more effective health care policy or
studying how to revive stripped farm
land, or membership in an advocacy
group intent on getting its views
heard in Washington.
Both these more removed jobs and
close-contact non-profit sector jobs pro
vide the training and skills necessary to
get ahead in the business world, but it
is advisable to take care in choosing
which field would be more in tune with
your interests, in order to take full
advantage of the workplace and the

environment offered to you there.
"I usually asked students interested
in public service is they think they'd be
interested in working with the bigger
picture' like policy, or on a more direct
level," Greenblatt said. "But I think it's
necessary to work on a direct level before
working with policy."
The CPPC features a number of hand
nuts discussing public service careers.
Further, it helps students decide if such a
career might be right for them. The cen
ter has on hand several reference materi
als to aid in your search including books,
a Bay Area public service employment
newsletter and the Rainbow File, which
holds information on 600 public service
organizations who are more likely to be
offering jobs.
Essentially the cardinal place to go in
order to complete your mission, the
( 'PPC also offers alumni-contact binders
enabling you to find and talk to Stanford
graduates who are currently involved in
fields of interest to you — a don't-miss
chance to get pointers on job-hunting
and learn more about what opportunities
lie ahead in the real world.
On October 17, the CPPC will be hold
ing a program for students interested in
"Breaking into a Career in Public Service."
A panel of recent alums will share their
experiences in public service jobs.
So if clawing your way up the corpo
rate ladder doesn 't appeal to you yet — or
never will — maybe it's time to leave
stereotypes behind and look into a career
in public service.
Your mom would be so proud.
