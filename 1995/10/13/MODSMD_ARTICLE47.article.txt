# Selling yourself
## A 						good resume is the first step to the rest of your life 
### Jim Lub 
You have 93.5 square inches that
must simultaneously serve as
an autobiography, a writing
sample and a sales pitch. You have to
adhere to a common format, but you
also have to express vour creativity.

Writing a resume is intimidating. After
all. together with your cover letter, vour
resume will play a large part in answering
the paramount question of your post-
Stanford existence known in business
circles as the McKinsey-McDonald's
tossup.
"Your resume and your cover letter
that is your first contact, your first impres
sion, said Veda Jeffries, a career counselor
at the Career Planning and Placement
Center. "That is what is going to get you
your first interview."
You can still put together an impressive
resume even if you haven't had much formal
work experience, Jeffries said.
"Students have a tendency to leave out
really important things because they feel,
'Oh, this is not really employment,' 'This is
not a really status kind of position,' 'This is
not a professional kind of thing,' " she said.
" I hat is not what employers are looking for.
Employers are looking for the skills that
you've developed."
Before preparing a resume, Jeffries said,
you should make a list of all your employ
ment, academic or extracurricular experi
ences, no matter how irrelevant they may
seem.
Some of these may unexpectedly turn out
to be extremely marketable resume items.
Group projects often show teamwork skills,
and work in extracurricular organizations
can show leadership skills. Overseas experi
ence can show independence.
Perhaps the most important part of writ
ing a resume is maintaining coherent orga
nization and presenting information in a
manner that is both visually appealing and
easy to follow.
For most students just leaving school,
Jeffries said, a chronological format — that
is, listing qualifications in order, with the
most recent first — is better than a func
tional format — grouping qualifications into
different skill areas.
"Usually, a person with a functional
resume has been out of the job market for a
while," she said.
As you list your qualifications, take
advantage of boldface type, capitalization,
bullets and white space to separate and high
light different elements and ideas. Keep the
writing style clear, concise and smooth and
use vivid verbs in the active voice to describe

your experience.
Including some details
about your experience can cer
tainly help, but it is more impor
tant to ensure that your resume
gets your main qualifications

across quickly and effectively.
"Employers usually spend two to three
minutes reading a resume," Jeffries said
" I'hev want to see what your skills are are
your skills relevant to what we're looking for
and to see what you have that's mar
ketable and would make you a good employ
ee."
Your resume should be laser-printed on
high-quality resume paper in an easy-to
read font.
An increasing number of companies are
now scanning resumes electronically,
Jeffries said. She pointed to a recent news
report that said 75 percent of Fortune 500
companies do at least some computer
resume scanning.
As electronic scanning grows more wide
spread, Jeffries said, resume writers should
be more wary of using graphical objects,
unusual symbols, dingbats, horizontal rules
and italicized and underlined text ele
ments like those may snarl scanning equip
ment.
Jeffries recommends that most job-seek
ers keep t heir resumes down to a page or less
for most purposes. However, Ph D gradu
ates' resumes might spill over to a second
page, she said.
Certain things should not be placed on a
resume, Jeffries said. She recommends leav
ing out irrelevant characteristics like age,
sex and religion.
"You don't want to show any kind of
inference that could cause some kind of dis
crimination," she explained.
Placing a statement of your employment
objective near the top of your resume is
optional, Jeffries said.
Jeffries also recommends leaving refer
ences off a resume. The names of specific co
workers or supervisors should be omitted
unless they are nationally recognized fig
ures.
Above all, you should make your resume
an accurate representation of yourself, one
that you're comfortable and familiar with,
because when all is said and done, it's you
who has to go to that job every day. And
your resume — well, it's just a piece of
paper.

not a really status kind of position,' 'This is
not a professional kind of thing,' " she said.
" I hat is not what employers are looking for.
Employers are looking for the skills that
you've developed."
Before preparing a resume, Jeffries said,
you should make a list of all your employ
ment, academic or extracurricular experi
ences, no matter how irrelevant they may
seem.
Some of these may unexpectedly turn out
to be extremely marketable resume items.
Group projects often show teamwork skills,
and work in extracurricular organizations
can show leadership skills. Overseas experi
ence can show independence.
Perhaps the most important part of writ
ing a resume is maintaining coherent orga
nization and presenting information in a
manner that is both visually appealing and
easy to follow.
For most students just leaving school,
Jeffries said, a chronological format — that
is, listing qualifications in order, with the
most recent first — is better than a func
tional format — grouping qualifications into
different skill areas.
"Usually, a person with a functional
resume has been out of the job market for a
while," she said.
As you list your qualifications, take
advantage of boldface type, capitalization,
bullets and white space to separate and high
light different elements and ideas. Keep the
writing style clear, concise and smooth and
use vivid verbs in the active voice to describe

your experience.
Including some details
about your experience can cer
tainly help, but it is more impor
tant to ensure that your resume
gets your main qualifications

across quickly and effectively.
"Employers usually spend two to three
minutes reading a resume," Jeffries said
" I'hev want to see what your skills are are
your skills relevant to what we're looking for
and to see what you have that's mar
ketable and would make you a good employ
ee."
Your resume should be laser-printed on
high-quality resume paper in an easy-to
read font.
An increasing number of companies are
now scanning resumes electronically,
Jeffries said. She pointed to a recent news
report that said 75 percent of Fortune 500
companies do at least some computer
resume scanning.
As electronic scanning grows more wide
spread, Jeffries said, resume writers should
be more wary of using graphical objects,
unusual symbols, dingbats, horizontal rules
and italicized and underlined text ele
ments like those may snarl scanning equip
ment.
Jeffries recommends that most job-seek
ers keep t heir resumes down to a page or less
for most purposes. However, Ph D gradu
ates' resumes might spill over to a second
page, she said.
Certain things should not be placed on a
resume, Jeffries said. She recommends leav
ing out irrelevant characteristics like age,
sex and religion.
"You don't want to show any kind of
inference that could cause some kind of dis
crimination," she explained.
Placing a statement of your employment
objective near the top of your resume is
optional, Jeffries said.
Jeffries also recommends leaving refer
ences off a resume. The names of specific co
workers or supervisors should be omitted
unless they are nationally recognized fig
ures.
Above all, you should make your resume
an accurate representation of yourself, one
that you're comfortable and familiar with,
because when all is said and done, it's you
who has to go to that job every day. And
your resume — well, it's just a piece of
paper.
