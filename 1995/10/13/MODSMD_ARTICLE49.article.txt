# KNOCKING 'EM DEAD
## Surviving that all-important job interview 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran 
Three years of resume packing.
Three weeks of shopping for the
perfect suit.
Three days of agonizing over your
resume: Palatino or Times?
Three hours combing your hair.
And it all comes down to the next 15
minutes.
Sure, going to all those get
acquainted-at-t he-CPPC' workshops
was time consuming, getting the Mac
in your computer cluster to properly
format your resume made you scream
and receiving one of those oh-so-tiny
rejection postcards felt worse than
bombing a final.
But, according to those who have
gone career hunting, the interview is
undoubtedly the most harrowing expe
rience along the path to a $40,000-a

It's also the most important, they
say.
"A resume and a cover letter (arel

interview really decides whether or not
you get the job," said Kathy Campbell
of the Career Planning and Placement
Center. "If you don't come across well
in an interview, you don't get the job. "
To be more than just another name
in a thick stack of resumes, you must
leave a strong — positive - impression
with the interviewer. That sort of "suc
cess" isn't that hard, say career coun
selors. The key, they maintain, is
preparation.
"Before you go into an interview
just like an exam — do your home
work," said Campbell, who teaches an
interviewing-skills workshop at the
CPPC. "An interview is not the time to
learn about an organization."
She advises interviewees to research
three specific areas:
• Themselves. Job hunters should
sit down and think about their skills,
occupations that interest them, what
they do well and what they have to
offer an employer, among other topics.
"When people ask you a question
about yourself, it shouldn't appear like
you've never thought about it," said
Campbell.
• The occupation. "Know about the
field you want to go into, said
Campbell. "What is a typical day like?
What skills are needed?"
She advises interviewees to contact

often tedious and seemingly ureless,
career counselors and those on the
other side of the table — job interview
ers — strongly recommend it.
"Preparation is the biggest thing,"
said Cireg Paquin, a senior employment
consultant with Apple Computer's
research and development group. "You
don't have to read 401-Ks, but you
should know the basic information."
That knowledge, Paquin said, will be
helpful when the interviewer asks that
one, last, fateful question "So do you
have any questions for me?"
Although Paquin said interviewees
don't always have to have them, doing
your homework is the best way to for
mulate insightful questions about a
company.

"Some take the shortcut approach
and interview with lots of companies
without doing the research," Campbell
said. "Those are the folks who paste
their doors with rejection letters."
In addition to knowing about the
company, CPPC advisers say intervie
wees should expect some of the classic
questions, in particular:
• What are your long-range career
plans?
• Why did you choose to go to
Stanford?
• 1 low did you choose your major?
• What does it take to be successful
in this business?
• Why did you apply to this compa
ny?
Don't just give extemporaneous
answers, the counselors say, but
instead, think about each question
carefully both before and during the
interview. Interrogate yourself and
form concrete responses.
And always be ready for that where
do-I-start, please-help-me-out ques
tion: "'fell me a little about yourself."
Paquin says it's natural to feel a
sense of confusion if you're asked a
question like that. He suggests asking
the interviewer to narrow the focus,
asking him. for example, if he wants to
know about your honors thesis.
"You should feel comfortable to ask
questions to set the interviewer's
focus," he said.
When responding to questions,
interviewees should always follow
"yes" or "no" responses with descrip
tive and explanatory remarks.
According to Campbell, a greater
number of employees are currently
emphasizing "behavioral questions,"
which require a little more thought and
care on the part of the interviewee.
"Employers are finding out that the
past is the best predictor of future
behavior," she said. "Often they will
ask questions that will force you to
draw upon experiences from your past.
It's really a good way to work in your
accomplishments and skills."
And if one of those dreaded thick
questions comes up, relax and give a
thoughtful response, cautioned
Campbell. "I've heard someone being
asked if they'd rather be a lemming, an
earthworm or a sloth, and why."
Campbell also warns students not to
forget the basics: Practice before the
