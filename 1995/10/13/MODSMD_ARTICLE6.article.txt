# Mixed Company gathers to celebrate music-making decade
## 
### Mary Megan Peer 
Some Stanford alumni will look a little
different as they come back to school this
weekend. Donned in red, black and white,
and calling each other "mixed compan
ions," they will step on stage with current
students to sing some of the past decade's
most memorable campus tunes.
Tomorrow night Mixed Company, Stan
ford's oldest co-ed a cappella group, will
celebrate their 10th anniversary with a re
union show. Over 60 members, including
alumni and the current group, will be per
forming at 8:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditori
um.
The show will "highlight the best of
Mixed Company over the years. A lot of his
tory . . . and amazing humor," said Aaron
Hallmark, the alumni show coordinator
and current member of Mixed Company,
who graduated last year.
Mixed Company has a history of popu
lar. contemporary tunes. The show will
feature many songs from the group's in
ception in 1985 to the present including
the older pieces out of the current group's
repertoire. The 1995-96 group will be
joined by four ensembles, each represent
ing two or three years of the group's histo
ry.
Old favorites including "Road to
Nowhere," the group's first "hit" and
"Space Oddity" will be performed along
with songs well known to current Stanford
students including "Roam," "Betterman"
and "Closer to Fine."
Mixed Company's history began in 1985
when Bonnie Zaire posted flyers around

campus for "all students interested in
forming a co-ed ensemble." Gina DeLuca,
who graduated in 1988, had just been re
jected at a Fleet Street call back because
she was a woman when she saw the new
group's sign and decided to go to the first
meeting. Thirty people showed up but the
numbers fell to about 16, the size the cur
rent group tries to stick to.
The group remained unnamed for sev
eral weeks until one of the its first mem
bers, Lorie Martinez, came up with Mixed
Company. The name emphasized the fact
that they were co-ed which differentiated
then from the other groups on campus at
that time: the Mendicants, Fleet Street
and Counterpoint. It was accepted, at least
as a temporary solution, and has never
changed.
DeLuca, the group's first business man
ager, said she doesn't have incredibly fond
memories of the first few songs. They had
names that included "Turtledove," "Go for
Broke" and"The Cabbage Patch Song."
Things changed when Fritz Stewart, the
first musical director, arranged "Road to
Nowhere." The audiences responded well
to hearing the very contemporary songs
that no other Stanford a cappella groups
were performing.
Their first real show was at the Coffee
House where they sang their entire six or
seven song repertoire. Kyla Kent, an alum
nus and Mixed Company member, said the
group "had joked about the "Star Spangled
Banner" as an encore if we got one. We left
the stage and were pretty satisfied when
