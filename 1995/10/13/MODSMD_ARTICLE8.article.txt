# Roble garden is set to open

Long plagued by delays, the Papua New Guinea
Sculpture Garden outside Roble Hall will finally
open this November.
The sculpture garden, which will consist of 15
hand-carved sculptures of Kwoma and Itamul ori
gin, had originally been scheduled to open last fall,
but a series of creative issues has pushed the open
ing back.
"The process of building a sculpture garden is not
the same as creating a building. It is a creative pro
cess that by necessity requires improvisation,
changes and rethinking during the execution," said
Jim Mason, the project director.
Originally begun in the spring of 1994, the gar
den has been troubled by delays. A collaboration
between New Guinean artists and a group of Amer
ican and New Guinean architects, the project has
been beset by problems ranging from financial trou
bles to the theft of a 10-foot carved pole from the
garden last fall.
While constructing the garden, Mason and his
team of workers faced a series of artistic challenges.
Mason wanted the garden to interact with the trees
and to incorporate a plant design related to planting
strategies from Papua New Guinea.
Although signs outside the project claim that the
garden needs an additional $20,000 to cover its total
cost of $350,000, Mason said that the most recent
delays were not due to a lack of funds.
"The process of situating artworks and develop
ing the land requires a significant time on the
ground," he said.
An opening ceremony, at which artists and con
tributors to the project will meet, will take place in
November.
"The space has been extremely important for

many in the Stanford community and I anticipate it
will continue as such in the future," Mason said.
In order for the project to reach final completion,
Mason said he needed volunteers to plant ground
cover next week. Those interested should contact
Mason at 641-5021.
