## Check please Social Security in for a change 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP> — On today, millions of Amer
icans learn how much their Social Security checks are
going up. But future increases are in doubt — the annu
al inflation adjustment is under attack from powerful
lawmakers.
Those pushing for the change, including Senate
Majority Leader Hoi) Dole, House Speaker Newt Gin
grich and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., have
termed it a technical readjustment to remove an upward
bias in the Consumer Price Index.
Opponents contend that politicians are latching onto
the CP I adjustment as a backdoor way to cut Social
Security and hike taxes, something that both Republi
cans and Democrats have pledged not to do.
Moynihan has called for benefit increases such as
Social Security to be limited to 1 percentage point below
the CPI rate.
If Moynihan's position prevails in this year's budget
debate, it could mean around $7 less per month for the
average Social Security recipient next year. That would
mean the average monthly benefit check of $702 would
rise by $11 instead of around $18.
The lure of Moynihan's proposal is that it holds out
the prospect of huge savings — $281 billion over seven
years. That would be equal to one-third of the $894 bil
lion the Republicans need to achieve their goal of a bal
anced budget by 2002.
The small adjustment can lead to such big numbers
because nearly 30 percent of all federal outlays are tied to
changes in the Consumer Price Index. The biggest sav
ings would come from adjusting payments to the 43 mil
lion Americans receiving Social Security. But the CPI is
also used to adjust federal welfare and pension payments.
In addition, the federal government would reap the
added benefit of higher tax revenue.
To eliminate "bracket creep" caused by inflation
pushing taxpayers into higher income levels, the IRS
adjusts its tax brackets and personal exemption levels in
line with increases in the CPI. A 1 percentage point slice
off the CPI adjustment would mean $19.2 billion more
in tax collections over 10 years.
The White House, so far, has been coy about its views
on the CPI debate although officials indicated over the
weekend the administration might be willing to accept a
modest adjustment.
But lawmakers may still decide to keep hands off,
especially if they remember the last time a change was
tried.
In 1985, the Republican-controlled Senate approved
by a one-vote margin a one-year freeze on the Social
Security adjustment. The proposal died in the House,
and it was widely cited as determining factor in the
OOP's loss of control of the Senate in the next election
