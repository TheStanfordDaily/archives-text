## Football suffers 38-28 defeat to UW Huskies 
### Jeremy Stone Staff Writer 
Tyrone Willingham and the Stanford football team
finally lost.
In a battle of squads with unblemished Pacific 10
Conference marks, Washington rolled up 535 yards
and capitalized on key Cardinal errors to grab a 38-28
victory. A bipartisan crowd of 45,210, the largest at
Stanford Stadium since last Oct. 15, watched as the
Huskies handed the Cardinal its first defeat of 1995.
The Huskies (4-2 overall, 3-0 Pac-10) climbed to No. 20
in the AP poll and No. 23 in the USA Today /CNN
coaches' rankings, while the Cardinal (4-1-1, 2-1)
dropped seven slots to No. 23 in the AP and six spots to
No. 25 in t he coaches' list.
"We're really disappointed in ourselves," said senior
defensive end Jason White. "Washington is a great
team, but I feel — and most of the guys on this team
feel — that we could have beaten them."
Washington never turned the ball over en route to
its highest yardage total in over twoyears. Senior quar
terback Damon Huard enjoyed a career game, com
pleting 20 of 30 passes for 295 yards, the most bv a
Husky quarterback in a regular-season contest since
1989.
"We couldn't be more pleased with four quarters of
offense and defense," said Washington coach Jim 1 <am
bright. "It's the most positive experience we've had
this year."
The Huskies, rankinl ninth in the conference in de
fense coming into the contest, yielded 465 yards to the
Cardinal. However, Stanford squandered several scor
ing opportunities, especially in the first half. Both Car
dinal turnovers, interceptions that should have been
receptions, quickly led to Washington touchdowns.
"It's always a game of turnovers," Willingham said.
"When you don't win the turno er game, you definite
ly have a chance to lose. And I don't think we won the
turnover game."
Stanford's opening drive foreshadowed the frustra
tion Stanford would feel all afternoon, as the Cardinal
moved into scoring territory at will only to be denied in
the end.
After the Washington opening kickoff went out of
bounds, it turned to running back Anthony Bookman.
The sophomore, who cut up the 1 lusky defense for 119
yards in hist year's 40-28 Stanford win, took the first
play for three yards. Butterfield then found him all
alone in the flat for a gain of 26, Bookman's longest ca
reer reception. Bookman followed with a sweep left for
18 more and a first down at the 18.
Back-to-back false starts, however, killed Stan
ford's momentum, and senior kicker Eric Abrams
shanked a kick for the first time this season.
