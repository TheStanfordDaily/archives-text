## Football suffers 38-28 defeat to UW Huskies 
### Jeremy Stone Staff Writer 
Tyrone Willingham and the Stanford football team
finally lost.
In a battle of squads with unblemished Pacific 10
Conference marks, Washington rolled up 535 yards
and capitalized on key Cardinal errors to grab a 38-28
victory. A bipartisan crowd of 45,210, the largest at
Stanford Stadium since last Oct. 15, watched as the
Huskies handed the Cardinal its first defeat of 1995.
The Huskies (4-2 overall, 3-0 Pac-10) climbed to No. 20
in the AP poll and No. 23 in the USA Today /CNN
coaches' rankings, while the Cardinal (4-1-1, 2-1)
dropped seven slots to No. 23 in the AP and six spots to
No. 25 in t he coaches' list.
"We're really disappointed in ourselves," said senior
defensive end Jason White. "Washington is a great
team, but I feel — and most of the guys on this team
feel — that we could have beaten them."
Washington never turned the ball over en route to
its highest yardage total in over twoyears. Senior quar
terback Damon Huard enjoyed a career game, com
pleting 20 of 30 passes for 295 yards, the most bv a
Husky quarterback in a regular-season contest since
1989.
"We couldn't be more pleased with four quarters of
offense and defense," said Washington coach Jim 1 <am
bright. "It's the most positive experience we've had
this year."
The Huskies, rankinl ninth in the conference in de
fense coming into the contest, yielded 465 yards to the
Cardinal. However, Stanford squandered several scor
ing opportunities, especially in the first half. Both Car
dinal turnovers, interceptions that should have been
receptions, quickly led to Washington touchdowns.
"It's always a game of turnovers," Willingham said.
"When you don't win the turno er game, you definite
ly have a chance to lose. And I don't think we won the
turnover game."
Stanford's opening drive foreshadowed the frustra
tion Stanford would feel all afternoon, as the Cardinal
moved into scoring territory at will only to be denied in
the end.
After the Washington opening kickoff went out of
bounds, it turned to running back Anthony Bookman.
The sophomore, who cut up the 1 lusky defense for 119
yards in hist year's 40-28 Stanford win, took the first
play for three yards. Butterfield then found him all
alone in the flat for a gain of 26, Bookman's longest ca
reer reception. Bookman followed with a sweep left for
18 more and a first down at the 18.
Back-to-back false starts, however, killed Stan
ford's momentum, and senior kicker Eric Abrams
shanked a kick for the first time this season.

1 he Stanford defense held, however,
and the Cardinal embarked on a 10-play,
74-yard drive that culminated in a 24-yard
field goal. For the first time all year, Stan
ford had scored first in a game, but the
Cardinal would never lead again.
Washington gave Stanford a dose of its
own medicine by returning the ensuing
kickoff almost to midfield. The Husky
offense mixed four Huard completions
with four runs by sophomore tailback
Rashaan Shehee, including a seven-yard
I'D scamper, to take the lead less than a
minute into the second quarter.
Five minutes later, Washington scored
again. The Huskies gained their lx\st field
position of the day when junior linebacker
Ikaika Malloe intercepted a pass from
senior quarterback Mark Butterfield. But
terfield's pass hit junior flanker Brian
Manning in the numbers, but bounced up
into Malloe's arms. Butterfield had not
thrown an interception in three games and
90 attempts.
"We created those things that a team
has to create to win on the road," Lam
bright said.
The Huskies capitalized when Huard
hit sophomore flanker Fred Coleman with
his career-long reception of 42 yards. After
five straight runs up the middle, the
Huskies faced a third-and-goal from the 2.
Huard faked a hand-off up the middle and
waltzed into a wide open right half of the
end zone. For the first time all season,
Stanford trailed by double digits.
Washington went for the kill with a sur
prise onside kick, hut Stanford recovered
in Husky territory and regained some
momentum. But on fourth down from
inside the 10, Mike Mitchell came up inch
es short. Stanford managed on its next
possession to punch in a short field goal by
Abrams, and Husky kicker John Wales
shanked a 46-yard attempt just before the
end of the half.
"Coach told us at the half that we
hadn't really played our game yet," But
terfield said. "We had to try to get our
selves together."
Stanford wasted little time collecting
itself. After a Washington drive stalled
near midfield. Butterfield took control.

After passing for 96 yards in the first half,
he posted 80 on the first drive of the third
quarter. Stanford moved to the Washing
ton 3, but after a holding penalty moved
Stanford back to the 16, a fifth red-zone
opportunity seemed in jeopardy. However,
Butterfield hit Andre Kirwan on a flanker
screen, and the senior raced untouched to
the end zone. Senior Mark Harris, who
caught nine passes for 161 yards on the
day, caught the two-point conversion to
even the score.
Then Huard took over. On second-and
-12 from his own 38, he patiently waited for
a receiver and then took off to his left,
where he found nothing but grass en route
to a 23-yard pickup. Two plays later, he
found Coleman again on a pass that junior
1/eroy Pruitt, in nearly flawless man-to
man coverage, seemed destined to inter
cept. But Coleman came down with the big
catch, this time for a 36-yard gain that set
up a Shehee touchdown.

'We're really disappointed
in ourselves. Washington
is a great team, but I feel we
could have beaten them.'

"[Huard] played great," said sopho
more inside linebacker Chris Draft, who
posted a game-high 12 tackles. "He threw
a couple of balls that were just right on the
money. He had a hell of a game."
The often-maligned Huard, who threw
a key interception as Washington was
moving in for a potential game-winning
field goal against Notre Dame the week
before, noted that his team was on the
road to recovery from last week's debacle.
"1 was scarred by what happened last
week, but if we go to the Rose Bowl, it'll be
a lot easier to forget," Huard said. "I'll
take a league win any day.
"Today was probably my best day as a
quarterback."
Huard would get the ball back shortly.
After a bizarre illegal block on the kicking
team, Stanford took over after a re-kick on
the 35. Three plays later, Butterfield
found junior running back Mike Mitchell
over the middle, who couldn't hold onto
the pass. Second Team All-Pac-10
linebacker Ink Aleaga was waiting and
returned the pick to the Stanford 46.
"I just lost it," said Mitchell, who led
the Cardinal in rushing with 55 yards on

eight carries. "It was a critical point in the
game, and a mistake like that shouldn't
happen. Any ball that's touched is catch
able."
Wales booted a 36-yard field goal to put
Washington back up by two scores. Com
ing into the game, Washington had only
managed 19 points ofT 11 takeaways, but
the Huskies came up with the 10 decisive
ones on Saturday.
Still, Stanford responded. Butterfield,
who threw for 252 second-half yards and a
career-high 348 for the game, engineered a
quick 64-yard drive with two big plays, a
pass to Harris for 28 and a run for 22 that
set up first-and-goal. After Aleaga drilled
him on the long scramble, Butterfield
countered with a soft toss to junior tight
end Greg Clark for a three-yard score, the
junior college transfer's first points with
the Cardinal.
Another big pass play doomed Stan
ford. Facing second-and-12 from Washing
ton's own 38, Huard, who was sacked
twice and seldom pressured, let one fly to
sophomore split end Jerome Pathon, who
beat Pruitt for a 51-yard gain. Two plays
later, Huard rolled right and found senior
tight end Ernie Conwell in the end zone.
"[The key pass plays] don't work unless
you get good protection, with the push we
got and the time we bought," Lambright
said.
On the other hand, Butterfield faced
pressure often. He was sacked four times
and put on his back many more.
"I definitely feel like I was under more
pressure this week than I have been," But
terfield said.
The Husky pass rush forced Stanford to
a three-and-out on the next possession. On
third-and-eight, Butterfield was forced to
dump the ball over the middle to junior
fullback Greg Cornelia, who was stopped
immediately after a three-yard pickup.
The teams traded punts, and Stanford
regained possession with six minutes, one
second remaining. Butterfield was forced
to throw every down, moving the ball to
the Washington 26 after a pass interfer
ence penalty and 25-yard slant to Harris.
But the Husky pass rush took over, forc
ing Butterfield to hit his offensive lineman
with a pass, fumble a snap and take a 10-
yard sack. With under four minutes to
play, Stanford was forced to punt for the
second time on fourth-and-33.
Sophomore Kevin Miller's 40-yard punt
pinned the Huskies inside the 10. On third
and-six from the 13, junior wideout Dave
Janoski came down with an eight-yard
pass, effectively sealing the Cardinal's fate.
However, Washington wasn't done yet.

After a one-yard loss, Shehee took a run
up the middle, found a hole and took off,
shaking tacklers and racing 80 yards for
the longest Husky score of the year. She
hee, who moved into the starting lineup
just last weekend when senior Leon Neal
was suffering from turf toe, ended with a
career-best 196 yards on 30 carries. Appar
ently, the spot vacated by current Raider
running back and last year's Pac-10 Offen
sive Player of the Year Napoleon Kaufman
rests in good hands.
"Shehee showed that he can run pretty

well in the open field," Lambright said.
Stanford refused to give up, however.
Butterfield led Stanford downfield and
fired his third touchdown pass of the half
to Cornelia with three seconds left. The
score certainly didn't hurt Stanford's for
tunes in the polls, but it was significant for
other reasons.
"It's not a meaningless touchdown,"
Draft said. "We've got to finish the game.
We've got to play 60 minutes all the time."
"We don't give up. We've got to bounce
back next week."
