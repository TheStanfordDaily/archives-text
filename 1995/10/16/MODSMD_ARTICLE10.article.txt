Million Man March drawing 1 many
WASHINGTON (AP) - Black men converging on the nation's
capital for today's Million Man March described it as a unifying,
uplifting event that transcends its controversial originator, Nation
of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
It ; not about a march, a man, words. It's about a movement,"
the Rev. Vernor Clay said after a sermon yesterday urging the men
of Lincoln Congregational Temple in Washington to attend.
l'he event, actually more of a rally and prayer meeting than
inarch, is called "a dav of atonement and reconciliation. " Support
ers describe it as a call for black men to take responsibility for their
own lives and families.
The idea originated with F. rakhan, and he has been its chief
organizer But it ha attracted a wide coalition of support, and
many say it's unfair now to characterize it as Farrakhan's event.
"It was his idea, he dropped the seeds," said Clarence White, a
postal worker who traveled from San Antonio, Texas, for the rally.
"But it's no longer his. It's ours."
Accused priest returns
CHICAGO (AP) - Hundreds of parishioners cheered and
applauded yesterday as a priest who was accused of molesting two
boys nearly 20 years ago signed a new covenant with Holy Angels
Church and returned as its pastor.
"To receive that kind of support, it was overwhelming," the Rev.
John ( alicott said afterward.
Calicott became the first Roman ' atholic priest in Chicago and
one of few in the nation to return after being suspended for allega
tions of sexual abuse. He asked for forgiveness and promised to
continue therapy and be monitored by an adult whenever he is
with children.
After Mass, Calicott said he never admitted being a child
molestei or a pedophile, onl\ that "something occurred that should
not have occurred. "
