# Thursday's truce slows fighting in Bosnia

### 
BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
Fighting ebbed yesterday in northwestern
Bosnia, where up to 50,000 exhausted Serbs
were struggling to survive after fleeing
advances by government and Croat forces.
In a bitter twist in the 3 1/2-year-long war,
many of the refugees are now at Omarska,
t he site of one of the most notorious prison
camps set up when Serb rebels overran much
of Bosnia in 1992.
A field hospital has been treating both
civilians and soldiers wounded in the latest
fighting. Aid workers say some older refugees
are dying, apparently exhausted after being
uprooted by rapid shifts in front lines in
northern Bosnia in the past six weeks.
The U.S.-brokered truce that started
Thursday was largely observed throughout
the country, U.N. officials said yesterday.
The Muslim-led Bosnian government
claimed Saturday that it was halting its
offensive, amid reports Serbia had to threat
en to send in the Yugoslav army.
A mechanized Croatian army unit, includ
ing 22 tanks, was crossing from Bosnia back
into Croatia yesterday, U.N. spokeswoman
Leah Melnick said in Zagreb. In addition,
more than 2,500 crack Croatian troops
moved away from positions along Bosnia's
northern border with Croatia on Saturday,
he said.
Government army commanders met for
five hours in the Bosnian capital late Satur
day and dispatched a senior officer to the bit
terly contested northwest, apparently to
ensure that government troops there

observed the truce, army sources said.
Bosnian Serb military sources cited by the
Belgrade news agency Tanjug, however,
claimed fierce fighting continued in the
northwest yesterday, including government
shelling of Serb-held Prijedor. There was no
independent confirmation.
Muslims and Croats in the northwest have
a powerful motive to keep fighting: revenge
for reported Serb atrocities during the Serb
takeover of the region in spring and summer
1992.
John Sparrow of the international Red
Cross said Saturday that some of the Serb
refugees were living in a mine that served as
a Serb detention center in 1992, but most are
in the open.
Prison camps such as the one at Omarska
provided the world with some of the most
gripping images of alleged Serb atrocities in
the war.
Footage of emaciated Muslim prisoners
and reports of mass killings focused outrage
at the Serbs and helped spur calls for inter
national action to stop the war and punish
war criminals.
Sparrow said he had no exact figures on
how many of the Serb refugees have died.
"Some of them have been uprooted three
or four times as the front lines have come
and gone," Sparrow said. "They have lost
everything, they have lost hope. They are
saying enough is enough, and they are giving
up the ghost."
Aid agencies have very few supplies stock
piled in the nearby Serb stronghold of Banja

Luka. Refugees have flooded the city since
early August, when Croatia retook most
Serb-held land and sent more than 100,000
Serbs fleeing into neighboring Bosnia.
In mid-September, government and Croat
forces started taking large chunks of Serb
held land in Bosnia, triggering a second Serb
exodus. The Red Cross has handled 130,000
more refugees in northern Bosnia since then,
Sparrow said.
The disarray has caused rifts among Serb
leaders over the U.S.-led peace process. The
current truce is supposed to last 60 days,
ushering in peace talks in the United States
on Oct. 31 that Washington hopes will lead to
an international peace conference. President
Clinton is ready to dispatch up to 25,000 U.S.
troops as part of a much larger NATO-led
force to enforce the peace.
The Serbs held the upper hand through
out most of the war, controlling about 70 per
cent of the country until recent government
and Croat offensives tore large chunks of ter
ritory from them.
Karadzic spoke at a meeting of the self
styled Bosnian Serb assembly, where he also
promised to call to account commanders who
had abandoned their positions.
The exact position on the ground now is
unclear, since the government has refused to
allow U.N. monitors into territory taken by
Muslim-led and Croat forces last week. All
three warring parties agreed late Saturday to
hand in maps giving their positions, and
promised to allow the United Nations free
access soon, a U.N. spokesperson said.

Government army commanders met for
five hours in the Bosnian capital late Satur
day and dispatched a senior officer to the bit
terly contested northwest, apparently to
ensure that government troops there

observed the truce, army sources said.
Bosnian Serb military sources cited by the
Belgrade news agency Tanjug, however,
claimed fierce fighting continued in the
northwest yesterday, including government
shelling of Serb-held Prijedor. There was no
independent confirmation.
Muslims and Croats in the northwest have
a powerful motive to keep fighting: revenge
for reported Serb atrocities during the Serb
takeover of the region in spring and summer
1992.
John Sparrow of the international Red
Cross said Saturday that some of the Serb
refugees were living in a mine that served as
a Serb detention center in 1992, but most are
in the open.
Prison camps such as the one at Omarska
provided the world with some of the most
gripping images of alleged Serb atrocities in
the war.
Footage of emaciated Muslim prisoners
and reports of mass killings focused outrage
at the Serbs and helped spur calls for inter
national action to stop the war and punish
war criminals.
Sparrow said he had no exact figures on
how many of the Serb refugees have died.
"Some of them have been uprooted three
or four times as the front lines have come
and gone," Sparrow said. "They have lost
everything, they have lost hope. They are
saying enough is enough, and they are giving
up the ghost."
Aid agencies have very few supplies stock
piled in the nearby Serb stronghold of Banja

Luka. Refugees have flooded the city since
early August, when Croatia retook most
Serb-held land and sent more than 100,000
Serbs fleeing into neighboring Bosnia.
In mid-September, government and Croat
forces started taking large chunks of Serb
held land in Bosnia, triggering a second Serb
exodus. The Red Cross has handled 130,000
more refugees in northern Bosnia since then,
Sparrow said.
The disarray has caused rifts among Serb
leaders over the U.S.-led peace process. The
current truce is supposed to last 60 days,
ushering in peace talks in the United States
on Oct. 31 that Washington hopes will lead to
an international peace conference. President
Clinton is ready to dispatch up to 25,000 U.S.
troops as part of a much larger NATO-led
force to enforce the peace.
The Serbs held the upper hand through
out most of the war, controlling about 70 per
cent of the country until recent government
and Croat offensives tore large chunks of ter
ritory from them.
Karadzic spoke at a meeting of the self
styled Bosnian Serb assembly, where he also
promised to call to account commanders who
had abandoned their positions.
The exact position on the ground now is
unclear, since the government has refused to
allow U.N. monitors into territory taken by
Muslim-led and Croat forces last week. All
three warring parties agreed late Saturday to
hand in maps giving their positions, and
promised to allow the United Nations free
access soon, a U.N. spokesperson said.
