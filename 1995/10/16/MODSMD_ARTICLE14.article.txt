## CPPC online woes 
### 
The CPPC moves
online and raises
issues of security

The career planning
and Placement Center is
housed in one of the most
visible parts of campus. Some
would say that's the only easy
thing to know about the CPPC.
Trying to navigate through the
maze of information, schedules
and bureaucracy at the career cen
ter is often a difficult, if not daunt
ing, task.
Now, the CPPC has gone
beyond fliers and seminars in try
ing to serve students. It has con
structed a new home page on the
Internet to make the process of
using its resources easier. Ulti
mately — if all goes well — long
lines, paperwork delays and lost
documents will be a thing of the
past.
Among the functions that the
new home page will offer is an on
line registration form. With this,
students will not have to wait days
to have their applications for
interview bidding processed man
ually. Additionally, if revisions or
changes need to be made to a stu
dent's file, he or she will not have
to worry whether the information
will get through or simply be lost.
And unlike the old home page,
the new site will be accessible by
all computers and not just Macin
toshs.
The purpose for the CPPC reg
istration is to compile a quick
snapshot of the applicant, giving
interviewers and potential employ
ers a quick break-down of the stu
dent they will be seeing. CPPC
administrators say the old version
was time-consuming because the
resources available only allowed
for a very brief description of the
students being interviewed.
But these new conveniences do
not come without drawbacks. In
today's computer-driven world,
privacy is an increasingly rare
commodity. With a few key

strokes, any stranger can know
the most intimate aspects of your
life. In the case of the CPPC files,
all it takes to access — or change
— a file is a University II) and
Social Security number.
While students may not be
opposed to the idea of letting close
friends see and critique their
resumes, having someone who
may not have the best intentions
scrutinize fairly personal informa
tion is unnerving, to say the least.
Worse, once a saboteur gains
access into a private file, he or she
has the power to add or delete any
thing there. In a worse-case sce
nario, an intruder can change an A
in econometrics to a D- and make a
GPA go from sterling to bottom of
the heap in five minutes flat.
Additionally, the system is open
to possible abuse. The CPPC may
not have the resources to screen
all the applications that come in
online. There have already been
cases reported of students who
forged their identities by using ID
numbers of underclassmen to
increase their chances of getting
an interview.
CPPC administrators say that
the chances of someone tampering
with a personal file are remote,
but admit that the possibility of
installing further security mea
sures should be looked into.
As for students using modern
technology to circumvent the rules
at the career center, CPPC admin
istrators have said that its screen
ing apparatus at the moment is
successful in spotting bogus appli
cations. In the event someone is
caught using forged identity files
to gain an advantage, the CPPC
says it would press charges of vio
lating the Honor Code — charges
which carry the possibility of
expulsion from the University —
and ban the student from ever
using the resources of the CPPC
again.
The CPPC should continue to
take the issues of student privacy
and security seriously. Further
safeguards should be looked into
and improvements in screening
applicants should be continued.
