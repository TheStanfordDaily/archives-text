## Hear the freshman speak 
### 
I AM A freshman, and I realize this
ranks me somewhere on the social
ladder between a sophomore and a
sexually frustrated St. Bernard, but I
would still like to offer some observa
tions of my new home — Stanford.
First, I must say that I am damn
proud to be associated with Hoover
Tower. Now, when my friends think of
me, they immediately think of Stanford
and the largest phallic-shaped object in
northern California. (San Francisco
skyscrapers don't count because the
architects who designed them didn't
have a penis in mind.) By this mere
association, I am the object of lust for
women everywhere — nine out of 10
would agree. It's nice that when people
think of me they think of my beautiful
smile and nice butt, but now there is a
150-foot concrete erection (and that is a
humble estimate) that can come to
mind. I am just overwhelmed with glee.
Even with my newfound Hoover
Tower confidence, I'm having some dif -
ficulty getting used sitting around a dis
cussion table, as opposed to desks, in
class. I just seem to bo having some
problems adjusting to the fact that my
legs are no longer alone.
For example, a week ago, I was sit
ting back, innocently listening to a fas

cinating chemistry lecture with my legs
crossed. I started rubbing the sole of my
sandal with my big toe from the other
foot (so what?!). A moment later, the
girl sitting across from me jumped back
in her chair and 1 noticed that the foot
that 1 had been rubbing was gone. I was
pretty sure I hadn't moved it. A few
moments later, I realized that 1 had
accidentally been giving someone foot
sies. The fact that she avoided looking
at me for the rest of class and avoided
me like the plague afterwards con
firmed this suspicion.
It was an accident. What am I sup
posed to say to her? "Oops, I'm sorry, I
thought I was just rubbing myself?"
This little setback doesn't bother me
that much. I'm sure that I will get the
hang of it someday and get good enough
to give someone else footsies and make
them think it is the guy sitting next to
me.
What really bothers me, though, is
the men's bathroom in my dorm. The
problem is that it is a lovely pink tile. If'
I had a nickel for every time I scrambled
out the door thinking I was in the
women's room, I think I might be able
to afford some soap. I'm serious it is
difficult for a guy to be naked in a pink
room. I feel like I'm at the mercy of

some disturbed psychology professor
who thinks it's funny to screw with the
sexual identity of underclassmen. You
may think that, sounds a little far
fetched, but after seeing the Band run
around in women's clothing, you start
to wonder.
Speaking of the Band, the first night
here I found mysell running through
the streets of campus like a pathetic
lemming chasing a bunch of drunk
Band members in dresses. What does it
say about me when 1 admit I enjoyed it
a lot? It means that next year I will
probably be out there again running in
a sexy, yet not too sleazy dress of my
own. Something to look forward to, 1
guess.
Well, these are the observations 1
deem to be the most important to con
vey to the intellectual community of
Stanford. I'm sure there will be plenty
more in the future because, as Leslie
Nielson said, "Like a blind man at an
orgy, I'm going to have to feel my way
arou nd."
