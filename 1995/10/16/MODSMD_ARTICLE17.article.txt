O.J. Simpson trial should be taken in context

IN THE PAST few days following the
O.J. Simpson trial verdict, 1 have
had much difficulty with the
responses I have seen on television and
read about in magazines and various
newspapers. The thing that has dis
turbed me most is the overwhelming
racial division of opinion as to O.J.'s
innocence.
A predominant amount of blacks
believe in his innocence, whereas an
equivalent majority of whites consider
him guilty — statistics that were preva
lent long before most of the evidence
was even shown. It is so interesting that,
in today's society, while we preach
"understanding" and "togetherness,"
America is racially as divided over this
issue as it would have been 30 years ago.
O.J. could have been my brother,
father or uncle and that's what scares
me. 1 believe in O.J.'s innocence; I find it
difficult to subscribe to the rhetoric that
suggests that O.J.'s superhuman
strength, like Hercules in a rage,
enabled him to subdue two healthy peo

ple and kill them with multiple stab
wounds. But I also feel that 1 owe O.J.
my faith because, once upon a time, the
matter of his innocence wouldn't have
been debated.
I believe that many blacks believe in
O.J.'s innocence for the simple reason
that, 30 years ago, he would have been
on trial not for whatever crime he was
publicly accused of, but for the crime of
being a successful black man who had
married a beautiful white woman. Thir
ty years ago, O.J. would never have gone
free. He might never have made it to
trial.
Perhaps a large number of whites
who believe in O.J.'s guilt also think "It,
could have been my mother/sister/aunt
who was murdered." Perhaps their situ
ation, too, involves certain loyalties that
go back generations. But I don't see any
thing about loyalty in Gene Kavenoki's
Oct. 12 letter to The Daily. I see quotes
such as "The apologists' defense of the
verdict is that we privileged white folk
cannot possibly comprehend the inces

sant barrage of social injustice which
plagues poor blacks." No, you can't!
And, regardless of his sarcasm, Kaveno
ki is right when he says "incessant." The
fact that the events leading up to the
Rodney King trial occurred at all is one
high-profile example of that. It is an
incessant barrage and it stems from 400-
plus years of scripting on both sides.
Whenever we have two people of dif
ferent races in such situations in Ameri
ca, we'll inevitably go back to the ques
tion of racial conflict. It's too much a
part of our history.
Slave labor was the enslavement of
only one race, a race that was taught to
hate itself because there didn't seem to be
anything to love — a race that was taught
from childhood to believe that it was ugly,
stupid, lazy. My mother told me the story
of a children's game they played when
she was a child: "If you're black, step
back. If you're brown, stay around. If
you're light, you're all right." For 500
years, blacks lived under abuse and now
that the burden has been lifted — rather

like an abused child leaving home — we
expect everything to be just fine!
That presupposes that there's a "bai
to normal" we're returning to after
years of abnormality. Discrimination,
however, was the norm in America for
so long that any deviation necessitates ,
totally new set of rules and regulations
the creation of a totally new outlook. It
will take a great deal of time and effort
on the part of people such as Kavenoki.
who choose to oversimplify situations
such as the O.J. trial, taking them at
face value rather than viewing them in
their whole context.
Perhaps, as we move away from our
times of turmoil, if we ever do, we can
have a situation such as the O.J. trial
and not think of it in terms of race. Bui
that time isn't here yet, as we can see

been debated.
I believe that many blacks believe in
O.J.'s innocence for the simple reason
that, 30 years ago, he would have been
on trial not for whatever crime he was
publicly accused of, but for the crime of
being a successful black man who had
married a beautiful white woman. Thir
ty years ago, O.J. would never have gone
free. He might never have made it to
trial.
Perhaps a large number of whites
who believe in O.J.'s guilt also think "It,
could have been my mother/sister/aunt
who was murdered." Perhaps their situ
ation, too, involves certain loyalties that
go back generations. But I don't see any
thing about loyalty in Gene Kavenoki's
Oct. 12 letter to The Daily. I see quotes
such as "The apologists' defense of the
verdict is that we privileged white folk
cannot possibly comprehend the inces

sant barrage of social injustice which
plagues poor blacks." No, you can't!
And, regardless of his sarcasm, Kaveno
ki is right when he says "incessant." The
fact that the events leading up to the
Rodney King trial occurred at all is one
high-profile example of that. It is an
incessant barrage and it stems from 400-
plus years of scripting on both sides.
Whenever we have two people of dif
ferent races in such situations in Ameri
ca, we'll inevitably go back to the ques
tion of racial conflict. It's too much a
part of our history.
Slave labor was the enslavement of
only one race, a race that was taught to
hate itself because there didn't seem to be
anything to love — a race that was taught
from childhood to believe that it was ugly,
stupid, lazy. My mother told me the story
of a children's game they played when
she was a child: "If you're black, step
back. If you're brown, stay around. If
you're light, you're all right." For 500
years, blacks lived under abuse and now
that the burden has been lifted — rather

like an abused child leaving home — we
expect everything to be just fine!
That presupposes that there's a "bai
to normal" we're returning to after
years of abnormality. Discrimination,
however, was the norm in America for
so long that any deviation necessitates ,
totally new set of rules and regulations
the creation of a totally new outlook. It
will take a great deal of time and effort
on the part of people such as Kavenoki.
who choose to oversimplify situations
such as the O.J. trial, taking them at
face value rather than viewing them in
their whole context.
Perhaps, as we move away from our
times of turmoil, if we ever do, we can
have a situation such as the O.J. trial
and not think of it in terms of race. Bui
that time isn't here yet, as we can see
from the opinion statistics — and
Kavenoki's letter. At this point, all I ca
do is pray for the best — and keep on
yelling, "O.J.'s free!"
