# Republican responsibility rap just doesn't ring true
## 
### 
Today, Republicans everywhere are
rappin' the rap — the Responsibility Rap
Not only are wealthy Republicans learn
ing to be better rappers, but a whole new
generat ion of frustrated Americans have
joined the party. They are frustrated by
the conditions surrounding them, and
the Responsibility Rap is an easy rhetoric
to adopt to take pressure off themselves
and, yet again, blame the historic victims
of racism in America.
But the primary reason that the
Republican Rap doesn't ring true is that
femidst ail the responsibility rap, and the
consensus that "irresponsible persons"
must simply learn to accept the conse
quences of their actions, hardly a single
lyncher has ever paid the price for his or

her actions. There has been no massive,
sustained effort to track down the crimi
nals and try them, either contemporarily
or historically. Sure, legislation was
passed in the '60s, but legislation did not
bring many of the most evil and dement
ed of all American criminals to justice.
Justly, the search for Nazi war crimi
nals spanned decades and continents.
But what of the search for the American
exterminators? It never happened. There
are likely many lynchers still alive today.
If sufficient evidence can be found, they
should be tried and convicted like their
Nazi cousins. Republicans want minori
ties today to accept personal responsibili
ty for their actions, but what of those
criminals who are responsible for creat
ing family legacies of terror that will
take generations to heal?
The American Nazis must be brought
to trial, and the trials should be televised
so that we, the American public, can

finally reach a sense of closure on this
horrible epoch in our common history 1
agree that it's time for people to start
taking personal responsibility and accept
the consequences of their actions, start
ing with anyone related with any lynch
ing at any time who might yet be alive
today. To hell with the war on drugs and
the policy of incarcerating people seeking
$10, 10-minute psychological escapes
from hellish socio-economic condit ions.
Let's launch the W;>r on Thugs, the real
demons in America — the lynchers and
their modern descendants.
Finally, if the racist institutions will
not administer true justice, then it
would be wise to create a series of mock
trials which would, at the very least,
bring the absolutely revolting, all too
recent white American history of torture
and terrorism to light.
