In the Oct. 12 letter, "Serious romance
is not an achievable goal," an editing
error caused the fourth paragraph to be
misprinted. It should have read as fol
lows:
Such women (at leading universities!,
in contrast to their counterparts from
20 or maybe even 10 years ago, are true
legatees of feminism and are not only as
sell-concernedly ambitious as the men.
Unlike the men, they have adopted an
explicit, principled ethic in favor of this.
It expresses an insistence on not com
promising one's desires or self-develop
ment, whether in the career or personal
realm, for the sake of men or in
response to pressures from them or
from the institutions they have con
trolled.
