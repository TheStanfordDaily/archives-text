### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Frances Marion Cook Arrilla
ga, who along with her family con
tributed money for the construc
tion of the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center, died Oct. 13.
A philanthropist and volun
teer, Arrillaga fought lung cancer
for 18 months before succumbing
Friday at age 54.
"Fran stood for all that is good
in us, and she spent most of her
time and energy making the path
a little easier for those less fortu
nate than she," close family friend
Frank Lodato said yesterday.
Arrillaga was involved with a

variety of service organizations,
including the YMCA, the Senior
Coordinating Council, the Penin
sula Center for the Blind and the
Age Center Alliance.
In addition, she had acted as
director or trustee for Castilleja
School, Menlo School, the Palo
Alto Medical Foundation, the
Community Foundation of Santa
Clara County, the Children's
Health Council, the Stanford
Alumni Association and the Fam
ily Service.
Arrillaga spent her undergrad
uate years at UCLA but later
earned master's degrees in com
munication and education from
Stanford.

"Although she
was a UCLA
graduate, her
heart was really
at Stanford,"
Lodato said.
"Stanford is very
important in the
life of the Arrilla
gas."
Her death

"will be a big loss for Stanford,
Lodato said.
"The thing about her was that
she loved her volunteer work,"
he added. "She offered her love
generously and unconditionally.
All of us who had the good for
tune to interact with her came

away with our lives enriched by
the purity and sincerity of her
love."
Arrillaga is survived by her
husband, John; two children,
John Jr. and Laura; her parents,
Edward and Marion Cook of
Redondo Beach; her brother, Ned
Cook and wife Patty of' Palos
Verdes; and many other relatives
and friends.
A memorial service open to all
will be held tomorrow at 3 p.m. in
Memorial Church, with a recep
tion to follow at the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center.
In lieu of flowers, memorial
contributions may be made to a
favorite charity.
