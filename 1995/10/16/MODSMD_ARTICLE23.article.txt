# Hum bio program celebrates 25 years

Twenty-five years is a long time for a mar
riage to last.
In modern society, marriages that last for
over 20 years are on the endangered species
list. Yet at Stanford, the partnership of biolo
gy and social sciences to form human biology
has been maintained for 25 years.
To commemorate the Program in Human
Biology's 25th anniversary, faculty, staff, stu
dents and alumni held discussions and events
Friday, followed by a birthday celebration din
ner and dance Saturday evening. Some of the
program's founders were present at the din
ner, including former University President
Donald Kennedy.
The first official human biology courses
began in 1970 with eight faculty members of
different departments as founders. What
made human biology unusual was that the
major was intended to blend together biology
and social sciences into a discipline that would
allow graduates to apply biological skills to the
real world.
Initially, the founders predicted a small set
of courses designed for approximately 50 stu
dents. Instead, the faculty was overwhelmed
by the number of students who expressed

interest in registering for the program.
One of the eight founders, Sociology Prof.
Emeritus Sanford Dornbusch, said at the Sat
urday party, "it was amusing to look upon our
false predictions and realize how wrong we
were. Now [human biology! has grown to be
one of the three most popular majors on cam
pus."
Currently, human biology averages 150
graduating seniors a year, with 61 affiliated
faculty and five endowed chairs. Psychiatry
Prof. Herant Katchadourian attributes
human biology's success to its user-friendly,
undergraduate orientation.
"I think that there is no human biology
teacher who tells himself, 'I hate undergradu
ates. I wish they will go away,' " he said. "The
only reward for a hum bio professor is the
teaching. No one is making the professor go,
so the only professors in the classes are those
who care about the students."
Human biology students have to declare an
area of concentration when they first enter
the program. Some of the more popular areas
of concentration include health care adminis
tration, science education and environmental
public policy, although new and creative con
centrations are also encouraged.
Human Biology Program Director Bill

Durham said that one of the clear principles
behind the program was that students would
have "a place they could call their own and be
able to design."
Some critics of human biology have accused
the program of not properly focusing on biolo
gy itself, saying graduates lack the depth of
knowledge that regular biology or social sci
ence majors possess.
Dornbusch defended the program, saying,
"Hum bio was not intended to be a strictly
biology major program. There are many stu
dents who wish to learn biology but are not
necessarily pre-med, and so they might want
to go into health care administration instead."
Jake Veylupek, human biology student ser
vices guru, said, "as opposed to biology, a biol
ogist will look at 11IV in a tube while a hum bio
major will look at the tube, and then broaden
it to a wider perspective."
Many professors and alumni praised the
program's continually developing courses,
with new classes always being added, such as
"Health Care in America"and "Sports
Medicine."
Concerning the program's longevity, Dorn
busch said, "Almost nothing lasts, so it's real
ly pleasant to be part of something that not
only lasts but is constantly evolving."
