Nobody in their right mind
would willingly face a creature, or
a team, in its own lair. Unfortu

nately for the Stanford men's
water polo team (12-5, 2-3 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation),
the schedule forced the squad to
do just that, as it took on Califor
nia (14-2, 5-0 MPSF) at Berkeley
last Friday. The Cardinal escaped
with little more than its life, suf
fering a 15-10 mauling at the
hands of the Bears.
"We had a breakdown in every
phase of the game," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "Defen
sively, we were just horrible. I
can't remember the last time that
a team scored 15 points on us.
Ten goals should be enough to
win a game."
The first quarter offered no
hint that the game would turn
into a high-scoring duel. Instead,
both offenses were stifled and
were unable to convert on the few
opportunities that presented
themselves. Finally, with one sec
ond remaining in the first quar
ter, Cal snuck a shot past senior
goalie Jack Bowen to give the
Bears a 1-0 lead.
In the second period, the offen
sive pace accelerated consider
ably. Cal picked up where it had
left off the previous quarter, as
senior Nick Kittredge fired in a

two-point goal on a 6-on-5 situa
tion for the Hears.
The Cardinal got on the board
for the first time when senior
Brian Pyle took a pass from
junior Brian Wallin and rifled
the ball past Cal goalkeeper
Toby Dommer to pull Stanford
within two.
But the Bears once again
extended their lead by scoring
two goals off Cardinal ejections.
Sophomore Layne Beaubien was
ejected with five minutes to play
in the quarter as he attempted to
guard the Cal two-meter man.
As time expired on the inan-up
advantage, Cal's I'hinney Gard
ner beat Bowen with a shot. A
minute later, the Bears were
awarded a penalty shot, as
senior Josh Leach man fouled his
man in front of tin* goal. Gard
ner converted on tin- opportuni
ty, giving the Bears a four-point
advantage.
In the final minutes of the
half, the Cardinal offense com
posed itself and pulled back to
within two points on successive
6-on-5 attempts with goals from
Beaubien and Pyle.
The Cardinal came out in the
second half with momentum still
in its favor. Senior Daniel
Lehoczky started things off for
Stanford, stunning the Cal
defense with a backhand shot
that went screaming into the
back off the net On Cal's next
possession, a Bear player was
charged with brutality when he
struck a member of the Cardinal

above the water. The call
removed him from the game and
granted the Cardinal a penalty
shot. Laster fired the ball past
the Cal keeper for Stanford's
fourth consecutive goal, knot
ting the contest at five.
Then disaster struck for the
Cardinal.
After climbing back from a
four-goal deficit, the Stanford
defense started to unravel, and
the offense could not keep pace
with the Bears' attack. After the
Cardinal tied things up a minute
into the third quarter, Cal
outscored Dettamanti's squad f>-
2 for the remainder of the third
quarter to take a 10-7 lead.
"That was a mess in the third
quarter," Dettamanti said. "We
made a nice comeback, and then
suddenly they were back up by
three. I told the guys at halftime
that we had to continue to play
good defense. But obviously, in
the second half, we didn't."
After Cal scored the first two
goals of the fourth quarter to
take a five-point lead, Beaubien
launched a two-point shot past
Dommer, pulling the Cardinal
back to within three with 4:09
left to play, giving Stanford a
glimmer of hope.
The Bears, however, had
other ideas and exploited several
defensive mistakes by the Cardi
nal to extend their lead to six
points.
"When you are playing a
pressing defense, you have to
foul, and you can't drop off your
men to help out," Dettamanti
said. "In the fourth quarter,
guys were crashing back on
defense and leaving their men
wide open."

Cal iced the game on one such
defensive miscue. The Cardinal
defense sloughed off on fresh
man Brad Kittredge, giving the
Bears a two-point opportunity.
Kittredge received the ball in the
two-meter position and floated a
lob shot over the outstretched
arms of Bowen.
The lone bright spot, (roin a
team perspective, was a rather
ironic one. A week after blowing
nine 6-on-5 opportunities in an
8-7 overtime loss to USC, the
Cardinal converted on three of
their seven man-up situations.
Nevertheless, the extra points
were not enough.
Overall, Dettamanti cited
poor shot selection and execu
tion, as well as defensive lapses,
as the primary causes for the
defeat. He was pleased with the
improvements in 6-on-ss, but
noted that a team is going to
have to play well in every aspect
to win the national champi
onship. Right now, however,
Dettamanti is concerned about
just getting to the NCAA Tour
nament.
"Realistically, the only way
we can get into the NCAA tour
ney is by winning th<" conference
tournament at the end of the
year," Dettamanti said. "But to
do that, we are going to need a
good seed, which means we have
to beat the rest of the teams in
our league.
"To tell the truth, the way we
are playing right now, we don't
deserve to go to NCAAs. And if
we don't win the rest of our
games, we could very well be sit
ting in our own stands and
watching the tournament from
the side of t he pool."

tain Pacific Sports Federation),
the schedule forced the squad to
do just that, as it took on Califor
nia (14-2, 5-0 MPSF) at Berkeley
last Friday. The Cardinal escaped
with little more than its life, suf
fering a 15-10 mauling at the
hands of the Bears.
"We had a breakdown in every
phase of the game," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "Defen
sively, we were just horrible. I
can't remember the last time that
a team scored 15 points on us.
Ten goals should be enough to
win a game."
The first quarter offered no
hint that the game would turn
into a high-scoring duel. Instead,
both offenses were stifled and
were unable to convert on the few
opportunities that presented
themselves. Finally, with one sec
ond remaining in the first quar
ter, Cal snuck a shot past senior
goalie Jack Bowen to give the
Bears a 1-0 lead.
In the second period, the offen
sive pace accelerated consider
ably. Cal picked up where it had
left off the previous quarter, as
senior Nick Kittredge fired in a

two-point goal on a 6-on-5 situa
tion for the Hears.
The Cardinal got on the board
for the first time when senior
Brian Pyle took a pass from
junior Brian Wallin and rifled
the ball past Cal goalkeeper
Toby Dommer to pull Stanford
within two.
But the Bears once again
extended their lead by scoring
two goals off Cardinal ejections.
Sophomore Layne Beaubien was
ejected with five minutes to play
in the quarter as he attempted to
guard the Cal two-meter man.
As time expired on the inan-up
advantage, Cal's I'hinney Gard
ner beat Bowen with a shot. A
minute later, the Bears were
awarded a penalty shot, as
senior Josh Leach man fouled his
man in front of tin* goal. Gard
ner converted on tin- opportuni
ty, giving the Bears a four-point
advantage.
In the final minutes of the
half, the Cardinal offense com
posed itself and pulled back to
within two points on successive
6-on-5 attempts with goals from
Beaubien and Pyle.
The Cardinal came out in the
second half with momentum still
in its favor. Senior Daniel
Lehoczky started things off for
Stanford, stunning the Cal
defense with a backhand shot
that went screaming into the
back off the net On Cal's next
possession, a Bear player was
charged with brutality when he
struck a member of the Cardinal

above the water. The call
removed him from the game and
granted the Cardinal a penalty
shot. Laster fired the ball past
the Cal keeper for Stanford's
fourth consecutive goal, knot
ting the contest at five.
Then disaster struck for the
Cardinal.
After climbing back from a
four-goal deficit, the Stanford
defense started to unravel, and
the offense could not keep pace
with the Bears' attack. After the
Cardinal tied things up a minute
into the third quarter, Cal
outscored Dettamanti's squad f>-
2 for the remainder of the third
quarter to take a 10-7 lead.
"That was a mess in the third
quarter," Dettamanti said. "We
made a nice comeback, and then
suddenly they were back up by
three. I told the guys at halftime
that we had to continue to play
good defense. But obviously, in
the second half, we didn't."
After Cal scored the first two
goals of the fourth quarter to
take a five-point lead, Beaubien
launched a two-point shot past
Dommer, pulling the Cardinal
back to within three with 4:09
left to play, giving Stanford a
glimmer of hope.
The Bears, however, had
other ideas and exploited several
defensive mistakes by the Cardi
nal to extend their lead to six
points.
"When you are playing a
pressing defense, you have to
foul, and you can't drop off your
men to help out," Dettamanti
said. "In the fourth quarter,
guys were crashing back on
defense and leaving their men
wide open."

Cal iced the game on one such
defensive miscue. The Cardinal
defense sloughed off on fresh
man Brad Kittredge, giving the
Bears a two-point opportunity.
Kittredge received the ball in the
two-meter position and floated a
lob shot over the outstretched
arms of Bowen.
The lone bright spot, (roin a
team perspective, was a rather
ironic one. A week after blowing
nine 6-on-5 opportunities in an
8-7 overtime loss to USC, the
Cardinal converted on three of
their seven man-up situations.
Nevertheless, the extra points
were not enough.
Overall, Dettamanti cited
poor shot selection and execu
tion, as well as defensive lapses,
as the primary causes for the
defeat. He was pleased with the
improvements in 6-on-ss, but
noted that a team is going to
have to play well in every aspect
to win the national champi
onship. Right now, however,
Dettamanti is concerned about
just getting to the NCAA Tour
nament.
"Realistically, the only way
we can get into the NCAA tour
ney is by winning th<" conference
tournament at the end of the
year," Dettamanti said. "But to
do that, we are going to need a
good seed, which means we have
to beat the rest of the teams in
our league.
"To tell the truth, the way we
are playing right now, we don't
deserve to go to NCAAs. And if
we don't win the rest of our
games, we could very well be sit
ting in our own stands and
watching the tournament from
the side of t he pool."
