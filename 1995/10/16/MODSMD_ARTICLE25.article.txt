# Cardinal runners utilize depth
## Stanford men place first at Iowa State Cross Country Classic 
### Edward Guzman 
Despite being split, up into four squads for two sep
arate meets on Saturday, the Stanford men's and
women's cross country teams displayed depth as they
enter the stretch run of their season. I he Cardinal
men's and women's A team runners captured first and
third respectively in the lowa State Memorial Classic
in Ames, lowa, while the B teams proved to be no
slouch either, as the men placed third and the women
fifth in the San Luis Obispo Cross Country Invitation
al.
The lowa meet provided a good indication of where
both the men and women stand midway through the
season, not only because Stanford took on several
ranked teams, but also because the same cross country
course will be the site of the NCAA Championships on
Nov. 20. Furthermore, the NCAA field will likely be as
large as the 164 male runners and 179 female runners
that took part in Saturday's meet.
The third-ranked Cardinal men took the 8000
meter course by storm, as their first five harriers ran

in a cohesive pack that finished only 10 seconds apart.
Junior co-captain Greg Jimmerson led the pack. He
placed ninth overall with a time of 26 minutes and 47
seconds. Sophomore Nathan Nutter followed right
behind him, crossing the line at 26:49. Freshman Brad
Hauser, junior J.J. White and freshman Brent Hauser
rounded out Stanford's impressive performance with
times of 26:54, 26:54 and 26:57, respectively. By plac
ing ninth, 10th, 13th, 16th and 17th, the Cardinal
accumulated a score of 65, easily out-distancing sec
ond-place finisher lowa State by 18 points.
As for the fourth-ranked women, freshman stand
out Mary Cobb led the way for Stanford. She blazed
t h<> 5000 meter course in 17 minutes and 24 seconds to
place third overall. For the first time in three tries,
Cobb did not capture first place at an event.
The other top Cardinal runners also held up well,
as they took key places and ran impressive times.
Sophomore Sarna Renfro finished eighth with a time
of 17:50, followed by junior Monal Chokshi (18:01),
