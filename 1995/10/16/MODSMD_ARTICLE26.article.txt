# Cardinal failing to execute
## 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Sure, Rashaan Shehee ran through the Cardi
nal defense like Moses parting the Red Sea. True,
Damon Huard threw as accurately as a laser
guided missile system. But don't let the numbers
fool you. These guys didn't beat Stanford. Stan
ford beat itself.
The Cardinal forced the ball past Washing
ton's 20-yard line four times in the first half and
only came away with six points. Like the strand
ed desert traveler who dies just inches from
water, Stanford saw its hopes of victory wither
away within sight of the end zone.
"If you're good at red zone execution, you
come up with 17 or 20 points," said Cardinal
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "That could've
been the difference."
It was the difference. Despite its early offen
sive troubles, the Cardinal went into the locker

room at halftirne down only 14-6 and quickly
erased that deficit a few minutes into the third
quarter. If Stanford made the most of its first
half opportunities, it would have been a whole
different ball game.
The problems began on the first drive of the
game. After cruising to the Huskies' 13 with
ease, two false start, penalties pushed the Cardi
nal back to the 23. Stanford made up nine yards
on a pass play to Mark Harris, but couldn't con
vert a critical third-and-four play. The team had
to settle for a Eric Abrams field goal, but didn't
even get that when the kick sailed just wide of
the goal post.
On the Cardinal's next possession, the squad
faced first-and-goal from the 5 before falling
apart. Mark Butterfield slipped coming out from
underneath center, losing five yards. Anthony
Bookman regained ground on second down, but a
pass to Harris that wont just out of
bounds forced Stanford to kick a
24-yard field goal.
"It wasn't Washington doing a

great job (to stop us)," said junior
flanker Brian Manning. "We wen
doing a great job of stopping our
selves."
Down 14-3 midway through the
second period, Stanford had a first
down at the Husky 15. Three
straight running plays couldn't
move the chains, setting up

fourth-and-three at the 8. Willing
ham decided to go for the first.
"I felt I needed to kick-start
us," he said. "We needed some
thing to get us over the top."
Unfortunately, junior Mike
Mitchell couldn't get over the top
of Washington free safety Lawyer
Milloy. The conference leader in
tackles nailed a sweeping Mitchell
just short of the first down.
A few minutes later, Stanford
had first-and-goal at the 0. On
the Cardinal's first attempt for
the score, linebacker Jerry
Jensen smacked Bookman for a
four-yard loss. Jensen and Ink
Aleaga then teamed up to shove
Mitchell back down Stanford's
throat for no gain on the next
down. Finally, Sekou Wiggs bat
ted down a Butterfield pass with
Mitchell open in the left flat The
result of the drive was a 27-yard
field goal.
u We were going the wrong way
once we got in the red zone," Man
ning said.
Until two weeks ago, Stanford
had taken advantage of its red
zone opportunities, converting 16
trips into 11 touchdowns and four
field goals. At Arizona State-, the
squad faltered a bit â€” three touch
downs and two field goals turn
ing what could have been an easy
win into a nail-biter.
While the lowly Sun Devils
didn't make the most of Stanford's
inability to punch the ball into the
end zone on a regular basis, Wash
ington did not excuse such ineffi
cient behavior. The Cardinal mav
have scored three touchdowns in
the second half, but it wasn't
enough to counter both the power
ful Husky offense and the four
squandered first-half chances.
