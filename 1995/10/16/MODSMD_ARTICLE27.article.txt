In the last five years, the sport of women's volley
ball has progressed greatly, as more and more schools
field competitive teams year in and year out. In the
Pacific 10 Conference, for example, on any given
night, Stanford (14-2 overall, 9-0 Pac-10) could fall to
at least seven of the other nine teams.
Sometimes, however, Stanford faces a clearly over
matched opponent, and Friday's match at Maples
Pavilion against the Houston was one of those cases.
Despite dropping the third game while resting its
entire starting lineup, No. 4 Stanford toyed with the
Cougars all evening, winning the match 15-4, 15-2,
11-15, 15-5.
By the fourth game, Stanford coach Don Shaw had
seen enough of his all-reserve lineup and returned his
starters to the court. As was the case early in the
match, Stanford dominated the Cougars in every
phase of the game. In game four, the Cardinal hit .372
as a team while holding Houston to an awful .122 hit
ting percentage. After watching Stanford's reserves
drop the third game, the 1,469 in attendance at
Maples came to life, and the energy that sparked the
Cardinal to win the match's first two games in 30
minutes quickly returned. Sophomore Kristin Folkl,
