## Spikers to face Fighting Irish 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
Stanford 15 15 11 15
Houston 4 2 11 5

In the last five years, the sport of women's volley
ball has progressed greatly, as more and more schools
field competitive teams year in and year out. In the
Pacific 10 Conference, for example, on any given
night, Stanford (14-2 overall, 9-0 Pac-10) could fall to
at least seven of the other nine teams.
Sometimes, however, Stanford faces a clearly over
matched opponent, and Friday's match at Maples
Pavilion against the Houston was one of those cases.
Despite dropping the third game while resting its
entire starting lineup, No. 4 Stanford toyed with the
Cougars all evening, winning the match 15-4, 15-2,
11-15, 15-5.
By the fourth game, Stanford coach Don Shaw had
seen enough of his all-reserve lineup and returned his
starters to the court. As was the case early in the
match, Stanford dominated the Cougars in every
phase of the game. In game four, the Cardinal hit .372
as a team while holding Houston to an awful .122 hit
ting percentage. After watching Stanford's reserves
drop the third game, the 1,469 in attendance at
Maples came to life, and the energy that sparked the
Cardinal to win the match's first two games in 30
minutes quickly returned. Sophomore Kristin Folkl,

lust year's National Freshman of
the Year, excited the crowd with
several thundering kills that frus
trated the Cougar defense and
pumped up her teammates.
The decisive game also wit
nessed an outstanding blocking
performance by sophomore Bar
bara Ifejika, who established a
career high with eight blocks. Ife
jika's effort early in game four
seemed to inspire her teammates,
as junior Kileen Murfee respond
ed with two solo blocks of her
own. As a team, Stanford regis
tered 15 blocks, stuffing an
impressive 10 percent of Hons
ton's kill attempts.
(iame three was the lone
exception to an otherwise con
vincing performance by the Car
dinal. After completely emptying
his bench, Shaw saw his substi
tutes commit several errors early
in the match and put his team in
an early hole. Houston had scored
five points before Stanford got its
first point and the Cougars
responded with three straight
points to take an 8 1 lead.
"Sometimes these things don't
work out," Shaw said. "We tried
to give some people some extra
playing time and today they
didn't play well. This unit plays
together a lot in practice, and I've
seen them play better, but today
it just didn't happen.
"The other thing that didn't
help is that Houston changed its
lineup drastically before game
three. Our players went with cor
tain expectations, and they had a
little trouble adjusting to the
changes."
Shaw inserted senior Cary
Wendell into his lineup to
restore order. Although she
earned National Player of the
Year honors last season, Wendell
couldn't bring the team back by
herself, and a 6-3 run by the
Cougars left the score at 14-4
when Shaw returned Ifejika to
the court.
Ifejika sparked a ferocious (Car
dinal rally, as Stanford scored
seven straight points and revived
the Maples Pavilion crowd before
Houston finally silenced everyone
with the clinching point off a
block.

"Normally, it violates my rules
I to allow the team to drop a game
while using subs)," Shaw said.
"But m a non-conference match,
it wasn't as crucial to put the
team away and we could afford to
give them a chance."
(lames one and two were
essentially mirror images of each
other, as anyone who arrived late
thinking that the match began at
7:30 p.m. instead of 7 p.m. would
have missed both games. Stan
ford's 6-2 offense was firing on all
cylinders and the Cougars had no
ability to stop it. The Cardinal
attack was frighteningly bal
anced. No Stanford player
reached double figures in kills
despite the fact that no fewer
than seven Cardinal players hit
over.3oo.
"Our kills were evenly spread
out tonight,' Shaw said. " That's
a good deal for us because it
means that all phases of our
offense are working."
All season, Stanford has run
the middle effectively out of its
offensive scheme. Sending sopho
more Lisa Sharpley or Wendell
through the middle has led to
numerous points. Unlike last,
year, when Stanford's national
championship team crushed
teams from the outside, this
year's Cardinal squad has not
proved as effective from the out
side.
On Friday, however, outside
hitters Folkl and senior Wendy
Hromadka had outstanding
games. Folkl hit .538 for the
match and posted nine kills. Hro
madka, who has played consis
tently well all year in the shadow
of Stanford's bigger-name play
ers, also contributed nine kills
and hit .381.
Sharpley may have turned in
the most impressive statistical
performance of any of the Cardi
nal, hitting an amazing .600 with
seven kills, 13 digs and 20 set
assists in three games.
Stanford will get a much stiffer
test tonight when it faces eighth
ranked Notre Dame at Maples
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. The Irish
have dropped just one match this
year to Texas, a team that also
defeated Stanford.
"They're a good team," Shaw
said. "They have some good ath
letes and they've beat some good
teams. It'll take a good effort
from us to win."

(iame three was the lone
exception to an otherwise con
vincing performance by the Car
dinal. After completely emptying
his bench, Shaw saw his substi
tutes commit several errors early
in the match and put his team in
an early hole. Houston had scored
five points before Stanford got its
first point and the Cougars
responded with three straight
points to take an 8 1 lead.
"Sometimes these things don't
work out," Shaw said. "We tried
to give some people some extra
playing time and today they
didn't play well. This unit plays
together a lot in practice, and I've
seen them play better, but today
it just didn't happen.
"The other thing that didn't
help is that Houston changed its
lineup drastically before game
three. Our players went with cor
tain expectations, and they had a
little trouble adjusting to the
changes."
Shaw inserted senior Cary
Wendell into his lineup to
restore order. Although she
earned National Player of the
Year honors last season, Wendell
couldn't bring the team back by
herself, and a 6-3 run by the
Cougars left the score at 14-4
when Shaw returned Ifejika to
the court.
Ifejika sparked a ferocious (Car
dinal rally, as Stanford scored
seven straight points and revived
the Maples Pavilion crowd before
Houston finally silenced everyone
with the clinching point off a
block.

"Normally, it violates my rules
I to allow the team to drop a game
while using subs)," Shaw said.
"But m a non-conference match,
it wasn't as crucial to put the
team away and we could afford to
give them a chance."
(lames one and two were
essentially mirror images of each
other, as anyone who arrived late
thinking that the match began at
7:30 p.m. instead of 7 p.m. would
have missed both games. Stan
ford's 6-2 offense was firing on all
cylinders and the Cougars had no
ability to stop it. The Cardinal
attack was frighteningly bal
anced. No Stanford player
reached double figures in kills
despite the fact that no fewer
than seven Cardinal players hit
over.3oo.
"Our kills were evenly spread
out tonight,' Shaw said. " That's
a good deal for us because it
means that all phases of our
offense are working."
All season, Stanford has run
the middle effectively out of its
offensive scheme. Sending sopho
more Lisa Sharpley or Wendell
through the middle has led to
numerous points. Unlike last,
year, when Stanford's national
championship team crushed
teams from the outside, this
year's Cardinal squad has not
proved as effective from the out
side.
On Friday, however, outside
hitters Folkl and senior Wendy
Hromadka had outstanding
games. Folkl hit .538 for the
match and posted nine kills. Hro
madka, who has played consis
tently well all year in the shadow
of Stanford's bigger-name play
ers, also contributed nine kills
and hit .381.
Sharpley may have turned in
the most impressive statistical
performance of any of the Cardi
nal, hitting an amazing .600 with
seven kills, 13 digs and 20 set
assists in three games.
Stanford will get a much stiffer
test tonight when it faces eighth
ranked Notre Dame at Maples
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. The Irish
have dropped just one match this
year to Texas, a team that also
defeated Stanford.
"They're a good team," Shaw
said. "They have some good ath
letes and they've beat some good
teams. It'll take a good effort
from us to win."

In the last five years, the sport of women's volley
ball has progressed greatly, as more and more schools
field competitive teams year in and year out. In the
Pacific 10 Conference, for example, on any given
night, Stanford (14-2 overall, 9-0 Pac-10) could fall to
at least seven of the other nine teams.
Sometimes, however, Stanford faces a clearly over
matched opponent, and Friday's match at Maples
Pavilion against the Houston was one of those cases.
Despite dropping the third game while resting its
entire starting lineup, No. 4 Stanford toyed with the
Cougars all evening, winning the match 15-4, 15-2,
11-15, 15-5.
By the fourth game, Stanford coach Don Shaw had
seen enough of his all-reserve lineup and returned his
starters to the court. As was the case early in the
match, Stanford dominated the Cougars in every
phase of the game. In game four, the Cardinal hit .372
as a team while holding Houston to an awful .122 hit
ting percentage. After watching Stanford's reserves
drop the third game, the 1,469 in attendance at
Maples came to life, and the energy that sparked the
Cardinal to win the match's first two games in 30
minutes quickly returned. Sophomore Kristin Folkl,

performance by sophomore Bar

career high with eight blocks. Ife
