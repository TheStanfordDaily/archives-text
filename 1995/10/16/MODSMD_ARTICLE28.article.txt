Fresno State : Jj|

The Stanford men's soccer
team (3-8-1 overall, 0-3 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)

picked up its level of play tin.-
weekend, almost at the expense
of a tough Fresno State team (9
3-0, 3-0). However, after a great
first half, Stanford was stung 2
1 by No. 20 Fresno State and an
atrocious hand-hall call by the
referee, extending the team's
win draught to eight consecutive
games.
"We played excellent soccer,
especially in the first half, said
freshman goalkeeper .Jon Brock
"We were fighting for and win
ning loose balls, and no one let up,
so it was a disappointing loss."
Stanford began the game
challenging the Bulldogs I'm
nearly every ball, and for the
first 20 minutes of the game, t be
score remained 0-0 Yet, a ( ardi
nal throw-in in the Fresno State
half of the 112 ield allowed St an for < I
to break the tie. The long throw
from the right side flew to ,i
streaking Carmen D'Onofrio
The senior popped the ball back
out to freshman Dan Travlor,
who was starting in bis first
game.
Traylor managed to settle the
ball while shielding a couple Bull
dog defenders with his back to
the goal. He then uncorked a shot
that struck the net on the near
side and put Stanford ahead 1 0.
The Cardinal carried the lead
into the half and through nearh
20 minutes of play in the second
However, with approximately 20
minutes remaining, Fresno State
scored after a frantic volley ses
sion in front of the Stanford goal
The Bulldogs scored again
with 15 minutes remaining
Whatever the outcome, players
on the Cardinal team felt this
last goal was unearned. The ref
eree missed a hand-ball call on a
Fresno state defender after the

Stanford defense had cleared it.
Then, upon returning the ball to
the Stanford penalty box, the
ball caromed off of a Cardinal
defender's shoulder. The referee
promptly whistled for a penalty
kick, stating that tin- Stanford
defender had touched it with his
hands.
Fresno State successfully put
the penalty offering in the net
and held on to win the match.

No one let up, so it
was a disappointing
loss.'
— Jon Bruck

"I could not believe what 1
had just seen," said Traylor,
who was no more than five yards
away from the disputed call.
1 The referee was a nightmare
Bruck claimed that tin 1 call
was not the only reason Stan
ford lost, however. "In the sec
ond half, we played defensively
and without the right mindset,
so we got in trouble," he said.
Regardless of' what may have
been the case, the Cardinal's
mindset has improved, as made
evident by the players' high-cal
iber play.
"Even though we lost, it was
a big stepping stone for us," said
freshman midfielder A.J. Sauer.
"We dictated play and didn't sit
back on our heels."
Sauer was also excited about
the Cardinal's chances this
weekend against Cal State
Sacramento and Air Force, and
presumes the team's intensity
wills stay up. "The whole team
is really looking forward to this
weekend," he said.
