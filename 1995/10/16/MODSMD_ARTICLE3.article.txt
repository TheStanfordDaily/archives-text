# Security concerns prompt later nights
## SURE Escort extends hours to 2 a.m. 
### David Stein 
Responding to increased concerns about cam
pus security, the SURE Escort Service has ex
tended its operations one hour later on a trial
basis.
This new service for SURE, which provides
free after-dark transportation around campus
for students who do not want to walk alone,
began in the second week of the quarter amid re
ports of a serial rapist in the Palo Alto area. The

escort service, which previously operated from 7
p.m. to 1 a.m., will now continue providing rides
until 2 a.m.
"The new hours were certainly created in re
sponse to the sews of the serial rapist," said se
nior Brad Andrews, director of finance for
SURE. "We wanted to provide an extra security
blanket for those coming home by themselves."
The rapist, described by police as a black male
in his late 2()s to early 30s, has been blamed for
five recent sexual assaults and two failed rape at

tempts. The last local assault attributed to the
rapist occurred Sept. 8.
SURE plans to continue the trial run for the
next week or two, but any extension beyond that
point will depend on the number of people who
use the service, Andrews added.
Currently, only one to two people per night
have taken advantage of t he revised schedule.
"The response hasn't been that great, but we
feel it's because people just don't
know about the changes,"
Andrews said.
While the continuation of the
new hours is in jeopardy unless
more students take advantage of
the change, many on campus feel
the escorts are necessary in main
taining campus security.
"We feel the new hours are
great because there are so many
women on campus who do not feel
safe, who haven't a way of getting
around safely at night," said grad
uate student Marya Howell, coor
dinator of the Women's Center.
"In fact, we hope they'd extend
their hours throughout the night."
Howell also pointed out some
"kinks" in the escort service's effi
ciency. She said a number of com
plaints have l>een lodged against
SURE by women who have "called
and been left standing" for periods

of up to an hour. They have had to
resort to "waking up their room
mates" to pick them up when
SURE didn't respond.
These backlogs, Andrews said,
are not the result of an overdrawn
service, but are due to the fact t hat
two out of the three SURE golf
carts are currently being repaired.
Two new golf carts will replace
the broken ones in the near future,
Andrews said. He was not sure of
the exact date.
Funding for the new carts and
for the extension of the hours has
come from ASSU reserves the
money that has rolled over from
previous years. 1 lowever, the deci
sion to lengthen the operating
hours came from SURE itself, not
the ASSU.
Nevertheless, the ASSU strong
ly supports t he adoption of the new
schedule.
"It's a good idea," said cotermi
nal student Jon Oram, a Council of
Presidents member. "If SURE
could operate all day, that would be
even better."
