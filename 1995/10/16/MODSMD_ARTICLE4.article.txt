# 'Not just a little island'
## Stanford protesters part of Cal walkout 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
More than 30 Stanford stu
dents were among 5,000 students
who walked out of classes last
Thursday at UC-Berkeley. The
walkout was part of a national day
of protest in response to the Uni
versity of California Regents' de
cision to end affirmative action at
UC campuses.
Twenty-one members of Stan
ford's Black Student Union and
eight members of RAGE (Resis
tance Action orGanizing Educa
tion) traveled to Berkeley's
Sproul Plaza Thursday to join in
the march featuring keynote
speaker Jesse Jackson.
During the walkout, many
classes were canceled and others
were boycotted. The bulk of the
rally took place between 11 a.m.
and 4 p.m., after which the pro
testers marched from the campus
to Ashby Avenue in an attempt to

block traffic along Interstate 80.
"There were people from a lot
of different schools there, and
every one of them was very devot
ed to the cause," said sophomore
Monisha Bajaj, a member of
RAGE who participated in the
walkout and march.
Senior Eric Logan, a co-chair of
the BSU, said no distinctions were
made among protesters; the
protest was one large group of
people mobilized in support of one
cause: affirmative action.
"I went to Cal because there
are still brothers and sisters that
still need our support," said
sophomore DeLise Cousins, who
is the president of the Stanford
Black Pre-Med Organization. "Af
firmative action affects us all
the schools are just the beginning.
In the future we don't know to
what extent they will abolish af
firmative action."
