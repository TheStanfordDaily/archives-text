# 'Not just a little island'
## Stanford protesters part of Cal walkout 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
More than 30 Stanford stu
dents were among 5,000 students
who walked out of classes last
Thursday at UC-Berkeley. The
walkout was part of a national day
of protest in response to the Uni
versity of California Regents' de
cision to end affirmative action at
UC campuses.
Twenty-one members of Stan
ford's Black Student Union and
eight members of RAGE (Resis
tance Action orGanizing Educa
tion) traveled to Berkeley's
Sproul Plaza Thursday to join in
the march featuring keynote
speaker Jesse Jackson.
During the walkout, many
classes were canceled and others
were boycotted. The bulk of the
rally took place between 11 a.m.
and 4 p.m., after which the pro
testers marched from the campus
to Ashby Avenue in an attempt to

block traffic along Interstate 80.
"There were people from a lot
of different schools there, and
every one of them was very devot
ed to the cause," said sophomore
Monisha Bajaj, a member of
RAGE who participated in the
walkout and march.
Senior Eric Logan, a co-chair of
the BSU, said no distinctions were
made among protesters; the
protest was one large group of
people mobilized in support of one
cause: affirmative action.
"I went to Cal because there
are still brothers and sisters that
still need our support," said
sophomore DeLise Cousins, who
is the president of the Stanford
Black Pre-Med Organization. "Af
firmative action affects us all
the schools are just the beginning.
In the future we don't know to
what extent they will abolish af
firmative action."
Cousins also added that she is
happy University President Ger
hard Casper chose to uphold Stan
ford's affirmative action policy,
but she said Stanford students
must not become complacent with
the situation. The University may
still uphold affirmative action, but
it is Stanford's duty to provide
support for those who do not, she
said.
"I am very happy that Casper
came out in support of affirmative
action, but I am still very vigilant
towards the cause because of the
trends in the nation and state,"
Bajaj said. "It is mine and every
body else's duty to fight for affir
mative action because we art 1 here
at Stanford. Just because we have
it does not mean that we shouldn't
fight for it."
Logan is also happy that
Casper has taken a positive
stance on affirmative action;
however, he said, there is more to
be done.
"Casper making this statement
is not enough," Logan said. "We

need the mobilization of faculty,
administration and students in
support of affirmative action.
Stanford needs to take a stand as a
school."
"The statement that was made
by Casper is very important; it
has set a precedent," Bajaj said.
"But it won't change the decisions
already made; only student
activism and support will do
that."
Bajaj added that when she
talked to other people they said
they felt good about the Stanford
students' presence at UC-Berke
ley. It showed that Stanford stu
dents care about affirmative
action and it presented a sense of
solidarity, she said.
"It is important to stay in this
fight and show that even though
we do have affirmative action we
are still willing to do sit-ins and
protests," Cousins said. "It's also
important that people continue to
see the Stanford T-shirts out
there helping in all the action."
"Stanford students should not
say, 'We have affirmative action,
so everything is 0.K.,' " Cousins
said. She said students should
continue to be vocal and visual to

let the media see Stanford s sup
port.
"The University should not
only take a stance, but go out and
advocate affirmative action,
Logan said. "There should be an
emphasis on a move to show sup
port for the I (to and also to prove
t hat we as Stanford students, even
though we are not directly
touched by this issue, have taken a
stance on it and will continue to
fight and help defeat the UC poli
cy, the regents decisions and the
[California Civil Rights Initia
tive]."
"It is important for everyone to
know the issues even though we
are not directly involved in them,
because we are not just a little
island over here in Palo Alto. We
are involved in the whole scheme
of things as an institute of higher
education," Bajaj said.
In an effort to organize and
educate students on affirmative
act ion, Bajaj is starting a Stanford
chapter of Diversity in Action, a
group that promotes education on
affirmative action. The group's
first meeting will be tonight at 10
p.m. m ttie Muwekma-Tah-Ruk
lounge.
