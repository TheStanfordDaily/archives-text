# Ethnic studies program plans nearly finished
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Two curriculum committees
are just weeks away from propos
ing requirements for Chicano
Studies and Asian-American
Studies programs, completing a
17-month administrative process
which began after a student
hunger strike.
The programs are two concen
trations in the Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity major,
scheduled to begin next year.
The committees, formed last
year by John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, will make their final pro
posals at the end of the month.
Proposals for Chicano Studies
and Asian-American Studies ma
jors will be presented to the Facul
ty Senate at the same time as pro
posals for an African and Afro-
American Studies curriculum and
other concentrations within
('SRE, Shoven said.
A committee to look at African
and Afro-American Studies has
not yet been formed, Shoven said,

but should be
within the next
two weeks. Even
though the pro
gram is already
established at
Stanford, African
and Afro-Ameri
can Studies is
being reviewed
before it is placed

under the CSRE umbrella.
Shoven said he expects the
proposals to come before the
senate at the end of fall quarter
or the beginning of winter quar
ter, and that students can de
clare the CSRK major "basically
as soon as it gets senate ap
proval."
In both Chicano Studies and
Asian-American Studies, stu
dents must take two general
courses, one introductory course
and one advanced course.
For Asian-American Studies,
students must complete five or six
courses in Asian-American stud
ies, one course specializing in a


Shoven
particular area within Asia, inter
disciplinary work in ethnic studies
and a required senior thesis, said
Comparative Literature Prof.
David Palumbo-I,iu, a member of
t he committee.
"The specifics within those are
still being hammered out," he
said.
The mandatory thesis will not
fulfill honors requirements,
Palumbo-Liu said. To complete
honors work, students will have to
participate in field study and
research in a project which Palum
bo-Liu said must "go above and
beyond the normal requirements."
He said the seven-member
committee, chaired by History
Prof. Cordon Chang, is still decid
ing whether to establish language
and overseas requirements.
Chicano Studies will require
two introductory courses if the
committee ratifies its current pro
posal Committee member Luis
Fraira. a nolitical science Drofes

sor, said he is interested in teach
ing one of the courses but that his
administrative responsibilities as
director of the Center for Chicano
Research could interfere.
In addition, Fraga said, the
committee is identifying relevant
courses already offered by the
University which deal with Chi
cano issues.
The committee will also deter
mine the focus of senior seminars
and requirements for completing
an honors thesis, he said. The
entire major would require 60
units, he said.
The Chicano Studies commit
tee is currently revising its pro
posal, said member Cecilia Balli, a
sophomore. While the focus of the
major is not changing, terminolo
gy is being altered, Balli said.
The committee, she said, is
"being really careful about word
ing because those are the things
the people will be looking at."
Once the committees finalize
their proposals, Shoven and Assoc.
Dean for Undergraduate Studies
Ramon Saldivar must approve the
plan. The Faculty Senate will have
the final authority.

Funding for the new majors is
coming from the School of
Humanities and Sciences general
fund and from the President's
Fund, said Shoven, who declined
to name specific numbers.
The committees were created
after a student protest and hunger
strike in 1994, composed mainly
of Chicano and Latino students
who demanded the prohibition of
grapes from University dining
halls, the establishment of a Chi
cano Studies major, the reinstate
ment of former high-ranking Chi
cana administrator and Casa Zap
ata Resident Fellow Cecilia Burci
aga and the creation of a commu
nity center in East Palo Alto.
Although Burciaga was not
rehired, committees were created
to recommend a policy on grapes
and to design the CSRE majors.
The East Palo Alto center is still
in its planning stage.
The University will have to fill
administrative positions within
the new majors. Palumbo-Liu said
the staff will likely come from
within the social sciences depart
ments. "We definitely want to (ill
a position this year," he said.

a position this year," he said.
Two curriculum committees
are just weeks away from propos
ing requirements for Chicano
Studies and Asian-American
Studies programs, completing a
17-month administrative process
which began after a student
hunger strike.
The programs are two concen
trations in the Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity major,
scheduled to begin next year.
The committees, formed last
year by John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, will make their final pro
posals at the end of the month.
Proposals for Chicano Studies
and Asian-American Studies ma
jors will be presented to the Facul
ty Senate at the same time as pro
posals for an African and Afro-
American Studies curriculum and
other concentrations within
('SRE, Shoven said.
A committee to look at African
and Afro-American Studies has
not yet been formed, Shoven said,

but should be
within the next
two weeks. Even
though the pro
gram is already
established at
Stanford, African
and Afro-Ameri
can Studies is
being reviewed
before it is placed

under the CSRE umbrella.
Shoven said he expects the
proposals to come before the
senate at the end of fall quarter
or the beginning of winter quar
ter, and that students can de
clare the CSRK major "basically
as soon as it gets senate ap
proval."
In both Chicano Studies and
Asian-American Studies, stu
dents must take two general
courses, one introductory course
and one advanced course.
For Asian-American Studies,
students must complete five or six
courses in Asian-American stud
ies, one course specializing in a


Shoven
particular area within Asia, inter
disciplinary work in ethnic studies
and a required senior thesis, said
Comparative Literature Prof.
David Palumbo-I,iu, a member of
t he committee.
"The specifics within those are
still being hammered out," he
said.
The mandatory thesis will not
fulfill honors requirements,
Palumbo-Liu said. To complete
honors work, students will have to
participate in field study and
research in a project which Palum
bo-Liu said must "go above and
beyond the normal requirements."
He said the seven-member
committee, chaired by History
Prof. Cordon Chang, is still decid
ing whether to establish language
and overseas requirements.
Chicano Studies will require
two introductory courses if the
committee ratifies its current pro
posal Committee member Luis
Fraira. a nolitical science Drofes

sor, said he is interested in teach
ing one of the courses but that his
administrative responsibilities as
director of the Center for Chicano
Research could interfere.
In addition, Fraga said, the
committee is identifying relevant
courses already offered by the
University which deal with Chi
cano issues.
The committee will also deter
mine the focus of senior seminars
and requirements for completing
an honors thesis, he said. The
entire major would require 60
units, he said.
The Chicano Studies commit
tee is currently revising its pro
posal, said member Cecilia Balli, a
sophomore. While the focus of the
major is not changing, terminolo
gy is being altered, Balli said.
The committee, she said, is
"being really careful about word
ing because those are the things
the people will be looking at."
Once the committees finalize
their proposals, Shoven and Assoc.
Dean for Undergraduate Studies
Ramon Saldivar must approve the
plan. The Faculty Senate will have
the final authority.

Funding for the new majors is
coming from the School of
Humanities and Sciences general
fund and from the President's
Fund, said Shoven, who declined
to name specific numbers.
The committees were created
after a student protest and hunger
strike in 1994, composed mainly
of Chicano and Latino students
who demanded the prohibition of
grapes from University dining
halls, the establishment of a Chi
cano Studies major, the reinstate
ment of former high-ranking Chi
cana administrator and Casa Zap
ata Resident Fellow Cecilia Burci
aga and the creation of a commu
nity center in East Palo Alto.
Although Burciaga was not
rehired, committees were created
to recommend a policy on grapes
and to design the CSRE majors.
The East Palo Alto center is still
in its planning stage.
The University will have to fill
administrative positions within
the new majors. Palumbo-Liu said
the staff will likely come from
within the social sciences depart
ments. "We definitely want to (ill
a position this year," he said.
