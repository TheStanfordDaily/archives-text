Stanford once again experienced
a record-setting fund-raising year
in terms of both donors and dona
tions, Vice President for Develop
ment John Ford announced last
week to the University Board of
Trustees.
With a 6.5 percent increase in
the total amount of donations for
the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, the
University received $240.8 million,

rose 4 percent to 45,839.
Donations to The Stanford
Fund, to which undergraduate

said that it is hard not to be pleased

by back-to-back record-setting
years, but there is always room for
improvement.
In coming years, the University
hopes to see an increase in dona

Peeps said. This past year, the
overall undergraduate alumni giv

cent. Next year, Stanford is aiming
for an alumni giving rate of 35 per
cent.
Peeps hopes that "the renewed
effort and quality put into the re
union program" will help the Uni
versity achieve the target 3.7 per
cent giving rate increase for 1996.
While alumni are not actually
solicited for donations when they
are here, the reunions do serve as a
stimulation for them to give back to
the University. According to Peeps,
improvements made to reunion
weekend activities seem to have
"worked wonderfully." Alumni

graduated in years ending with a
