# Donations reach record-high level

### Amy Tovar 
Stanford once again experienced
a record-setting fund-raising year
in terms of both donors and dona
tions, Vice President for Develop
ment John Ford announced last
week to the University Board of
Trustees.
With a 6.5 percent increase in
the total amount of donations for
the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, the
University received $240.8 million,
as opposed to last year's $226.1 mil
lion. Gifts granted to the Universi
ty were up 5 percent to 80,171 do
nations; the total number of donors
rose 4 percent to 45,839.
Donations to The Stanford
Fund, to which undergraduate
alumni are encouraged to con
tribute, came to $3.8 million; the
President's Fund received nearly
$2 million.
Assoc. Vice President for Devel
opment Stephen Peeps said the
University is "pleased, but not sat
isfied" with this year's results. Ho
said that it is hard not to be pleased

by back-to-back record-setting
years, but there is always room for
improvement.
In coming years, the University
hopes to see an increase in dona
tions from undergraduate alumni,
Peeps said. This past year, the
overall undergraduate alumni giv
ing rate rose 1 percent to 31.3 per
cent. Next year, Stanford is aiming
for an alumni giving rate of 35 per
cent.
Peeps hopes that "the renewed
effort and quality put into the re
union program" will help the Uni
versity achieve the target 3.7 per
cent giving rate increase for 1996.
While alumni are not actually
solicited for donations when they
are here, the reunions do serve as a
stimulation for them to give back to
the University. According to Peeps,
improvements made to reunion
weekend activities seem to have
"worked wonderfully." Alumni
with reunions in 1994 — those who
graduated in years ending with a
four or a nine — gave at a signifi
cantly higher overall rate of 35 per
cent.
Peeps says that another way
the University hopes to achieve its

goals for the future is by empha
sizing the importance of overall
participation.
Peeps said that in the past,
Stanford has been "so successful
in overall fund raising that the
importance of small gifts was
until remphasized "
When there are enormous
endowments by a small number of

contributors, such as alumni
William Hewlett and David
Packard, "it is easy to lose sight of
the importance of small gifts and
participation," Peeps said.
When University President
Gerhard Casper came to Stanford
three years ago, he questioned the
lack of alumni contributions.
Now, Stanford is trying to send a

message to alumni and future
alumni about the importance of
giving back to the University,
Peeps said.
Stanford hopes its alumni giv
ing rate will eventually approach
those enjoyed by schools of compa
rable prestige, such as Harvard
University.
"This will be a slow and steady

process," Peeps said, "because
Stanford is pushing against an
absence of tradition."
Peeps said he hopes one day
Stanford's tradition of relying on
large gifts from a few generous
contributors will turn into a tradi
tion of relying on overall giving,
from both large and small donors
alike.
