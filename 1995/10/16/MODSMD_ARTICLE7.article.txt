# Casper, Gunther join justices on panel

### Karthik Ran 
Supreme Court justices and
Stanford alumni Sandra Day
O'Connor and Stephen Breyer
headlined a panel discussion with
University President Gerhard
Casper and Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther Saturday on the status
and influence of the American ju
diciary system.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan
moderated the 1995 Homecom
ing Reunion Weekend event,
which was sponsored by the Law
School.
"There are, I think, two Amer
ican contributions to the rule of
law that stand out above any
thing else," said Casper, "the no
tion of the Constitution as higher
law .. . and the notion of judicial
review."
Both ideals spread through
Europe in four waves following
World War I, World War 11, the
Treaty of Rome in 1958 and the
collapse of the Soviet Union,
Casper said. However, Casper
noted, most European countries
have "specialized constitutional

courts with the power of judicial
review," and thereby become
"more political institutions than
the Supreme Court."
O'Connor further testified to

the differences between the Eu
ropean and American judicial
systems.
"Any of our courts, any of our
judges, can accept and decide

something to a federal constitu
tional law if it conies up as being
relevant in a proper case before

that court," O'Connor said. "Now,
if such a situation happens in a
European country with a constitu
tional court, the trial court will
stop the proceeding and refer the
constitutional issue to the constitu
tional court."
Breyersaid he found it interest
ing that justices and judges from
constitutional courts m Europe
saw protecting basic human liber
ties as part of their jobs.
"I don't think you could have
made that statement 30 years ago,"
he said.
All four panelists agreed that
the Supreme Court's power to
decide which cases it takes and the
power that is given to lower courts
are l>eneficial aspects of the U.S.
legal system.
"Our [judicial system], unlike
the European structure, is not a
constitutional court," Cunt her
said. "It's an ordinary court which
also happens to decide constitu
tional cases''
"Our court is foremost alone in
having the flexibility and discret ion

that we have in selecting cases that
we will hear," O'Connor said.
"Most [European] courts are
required to take all these cases, and
it just lends itself to a lot of prob
lems."
The number of cases that the
Supreme Court decides each year
has declined since the early 1980s.
Responding to accusations by the
press that the court looks only for
"hot-button issues," Breyer said
that "then- is no conscious effort to
take fewer cases."
O'Connor added that she was
"absolutely certain that the mem
bers of the court are applying the
same standards today in deciding
which cases to accept that were
applied when I arrived there in
1981."
The Supreme Court is much
busier than the Court of Appeals
where he previously served, Breyer
said, even though the Court of
Appeals has more cases.
"Every issue is something of dif
ficulty and something that 1 myself
individually and other members
individually have to get to the bot
tom of and figure out where they
stand on the issue," Breyer said.
"That's very difficult and time-con
siimintr "

When considering the Constitu
tion, Breyer said, one should create
a basic framework of decisions that
allows individuals to function in an
ordinary way.
"The Constitution itself is not
something you approach ideologi
cally," he said. "You don't
approach it in terms of what's g<x>d
and what's bad. You approach it as
a document that somehow has
enabled x million people to lead
their lives in society in a way that
makes a degree of sense."
To close the discussion, O'Con
nor reflected on the life of her for
mer colleague Thurgood Marshall,
calling him "the only genuine
American hero I have personally
known."
"When 1 look back on his life,
it's quite breathtaking," O'Connor
said. "At the end of his day on the
court,... he was not at all satisfied
with what he had accomplished.
Indeed he felt that he had not
accomplished all that much. He
saw a pretty sorry state of affairs
from his perspective, and that
made me sad.
"It seemed to me that of all the
people I have known, he more than
any could say tridy, 'I made a dif
ference.' "

same standards today in deciding
which cases to accept that were
applied when I arrived there in
1981."
The Supreme Court is much
busier than the Court of Appeals
where he previously served, Breyer
said, even though the Court of
Appeals has more cases.
"Every issue is something of dif
ficulty and something that 1 myself
individually and other members
individually have to get to the bot
tom of and figure out where they
stand on the issue," Breyer said.
"That's very difficult and time-con
siimintr "

When considering the Constitu
tion, Breyer said, one should create
a basic framework of decisions that
allows individuals to function in an
ordinary way.
"The Constitution itself is not
something you approach ideologi
cally," he said. "You don't
approach it in terms of what's g<x>d
and what's bad. You approach it as
a document that somehow has
enabled x million people to lead
their lives in society in a way that
makes a degree of sense."
To close the discussion, O'Con

mer colleague Thurgood Marshall,
calling him "the only genuine
American hero I have personally
known."
"When 1 look back on his life,
it's quite breathtaking," O'Connor
said. "At the end of his day on the
court,... he was not at all satisfied
with what he had accomplished.
Indeed he felt that he had not
accomplished all that much. He
saw a pretty sorry state of affairs
from his perspective, and that
made me sad.
"It seemed to me that of all the
people I have known, he more than
any could say tridy, 'I made a dif
ference.' "
Supreme Court justices and
Stanford alumni Sandra Day
O'Connor and Stephen Breyer
headlined a panel discussion with
University President Gerhard
Casper and Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther Saturday on the status
and influence of the American ju
diciary system.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan
moderated the 1995 Homecom
ing Reunion Weekend event,
which was sponsored by the Law
School.
"There are, I think, two Amer
ican contributions to the rule of
law that stand out above any
thing else," said Casper, "the no
tion of the Constitution as higher
law .. . and the notion of judicial
review."
Both ideals spread through
Europe in four waves following
World War I, World War 11, the
Treaty of Rome in 1958 and the
collapse of the Soviet Union,
Casper said. However, Casper
noted, most European countries
have "specialized constitutional

courts with the power of judicial
review," and thereby become
"more political institutions than
the Supreme Court."
O'Connor further testified to

the differences between the Eu
ropean and American judicial
systems.
"Any of our courts, any of our
judges, can accept and decide

something to a federal constitu
tional law if it conies up as being
relevant in a proper case before

that court," O'Connor said. "Now,
if such a situation happens in a
European country with a constitu
tional court, the trial court will
stop the proceeding and refer the
constitutional issue to the constitu
tional court."
Breyersaid he found it interest
ing that justices and judges from
constitutional courts m Europe
saw protecting basic human liber
ties as part of their jobs.
"I don't think you could have
made that statement 30 years ago,"
he said.
All four panelists agreed that
the Supreme Court's power to
decide which cases it takes and the
power that is given to lower courts
are l>eneficial aspects of the U.S.
legal system.
"Our [judicial system], unlike
the European structure, is not a
constitutional court," Cunt her
said. "It's an ordinary court which
also happens to decide constitu
tional cases''
"Our court is foremost alone in
having the flexibility and discret ion

that we have in selecting cases that
we will hear," O'Connor said.
"Most [European] courts are
required to take all these cases, and
it just lends itself to a lot of prob
lems."
The number of cases that the
Supreme Court decides each year
has declined since the early 1980s.
Responding to accusations by the
press that the court looks only for
"hot-button issues," Breyer said
that "then- is no conscious effort to
take fewer cases."
O'Connor added that she was
"absolutely certain that the mem
bers of the court are applying the
same standards today in deciding
which cases to accept that were
applied when I arrived there in
1981."
The Supreme Court is much
busier than the Court of Appeals
where he previously served, Breyer
