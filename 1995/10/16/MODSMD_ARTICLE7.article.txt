### Karthik Ran 
Supreme Court justices and
Stanford alumni Sandra Day
O'Connor and Stephen Breyer
headlined a panel discussion with
University President Gerhard
Casper and Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther Saturday on the status
and influence of the American ju
diciary system.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan
moderated the 1995 Homecom
ing Reunion Weekend event,
which was sponsored by the Law
School.
"There are, I think, two Amer
ican contributions to the rule of
law that stand out above any
thing else," said Casper, "the no
tion of the Constitution as higher
law .. . and the notion of judicial
review."
Both ideals spread through
Europe in four waves following
World War I, World War 11, the
Treaty of Rome in 1958 and the
collapse of the Soviet Union,
Casper said. However, Casper
noted, most European countries
have "specialized constitutional

courts with the power of judicial
review," and thereby become
"more political institutions than
the Supreme Court."
O'Connor further testified to

the differences between the Eu
ropean and American judicial
systems.
"Any of our courts, any of our
judges, can accept and decide

something to a federal constitu
tional law if it conies up as being
relevant in a proper case before
