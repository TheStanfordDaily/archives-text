WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, JOE DIMA6CIO?
Come learn the answer to this question and more from
Mr. Robinson — Mr. Eugene Robinson, that is, the
Washington Post's foreign editor. He'll be here tomor
row at noon to talk about his life as a journalist and
answer any questions you have about the Post or its
internship program ... or maybe former baseball play
ers. You could ieven be seduced into a job there -— it's
been known to happen.
All staffers are invited. So be at the Daily office tomor
row at noon. Shmooze, talk and even eat a little. Lunch
will be provided this time.
For more information about getting interviews with
Mr. Robinson, see Sarah this week.
WE ATTHE DAILY HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THE POST TO BE
THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF OUR PARENTS' NEWSPAPERS.
