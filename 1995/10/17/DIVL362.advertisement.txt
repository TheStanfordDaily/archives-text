For years. I have been saying that the U.S. Budget cannot be balanced
over ;in extended period of time in the absence of a trade surplus.
Nov. I .im making the following challenge to all economists and
proponents of a balanced budget $200,000 to the first person who
explains why the article "Analyzing the Economy with f'okcr" is
incorrect in a broad sense. This article, which is available without
charge by calling 800-666-3903 or writing to Box 7634, Beverly
Hills. C'A 90212, explains that u) there are essentially three types of
wealth real assets, stocks, and net non-stock financial assets.
Focusing on net non-stock financial assets, b) above-average income
Americans must increase net non-stock financial assets each year in
order to have a substantial incentive to produce and innovate, c) this
"\\ in" must come at the expense of either the U.S. Government, the
below-average income class, or foreigners, d) since we are running
a current account deficit (losing to foreigners) the only entity that
can "keep losing" to fund the gains of the above-average income
class is the Government In other words, balance the budget for a
prolonged period in the absence of a current account surplus and
Americans will not increase net non-stock financial assets after taxes
.iiul will have little incentive to produce and innovate. With little
incentive to produce and innovate, production of real assets would
also decline, as would in all probability, stock prices. So the best
way to attack budget deficit growth is to try to improve the trade
deficit It is no accident that most world governments have been
running deficits for many years. If world governments as a group
ran a balanced budget, the world-private sector could not increase
net-non stock financial assets and would have much less incentive
to produce and innovate.
