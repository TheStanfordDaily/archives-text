# Campus event meshes with DC march
## 'Day of atonement' 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
Nearly 100 members of the
Stanford community gathered yes
terday in Memorial Church to hold
a "day of atonement" coinciding
with the"Million Man March" on
Washington, D.C.
Though the march in Washing
ton excluded women and was sur
rounded by controversy because of
its leader, Ix>uis Farrakhan, a con
siderable number of black fem.Ues
were among the group at the Stan
ford ceremony.
The hour began with opening re
marks about the day's meaning, de
livered by Quintus Jett, a graduate
student in industrial engineering

and the event's organizer.
"We are here to reclaim the
image of the black man, and it is
about time. I have decided that I
don't want to be too humble any
more and I don't think that I am
alone in this feeling," Jett said. "I
don't want to spend my life adapt
ing to the world. I want the world to
adapt to me."
Political Science Prof. Lucius
Barker spoke of the O.J. Simpson
trial and Farrakhan's march on
Washington as wake-up calls to
America about the state of affairs in
this country in relation to African
Americans.
"It's the message and not the
messenger that many people find
disturbing," said Barker. "We have
not been able to forge sufficient
support to deal effectively with the
cancer of racism that severely ef
fects our social systems. We can
each begin to work diligently and
efficiently to make an impact."
Morris Graves, head of the Black
Community Services Center, spoke
next about the importance of the
day's event and of the atonement
aspect of the day.
"As director of the BCSC ... it is
important for me to be a role model
and an advocate of the students and
to make an environment conducive
to their learning," Graves said.
Graves acknowledged the con
troversy surrounding Farrakhan's
refusal to allow women to partici
pate in the Washington march.
"It is about time for us to start
looking at our sisters as leaders in
our struggle," he said. "I encourage
the brothers to look beyond the sex
ist mentality. It is important for
you to move past that and start
looking at the female gender in
terms of what they offer to the
struggle and in society," he said

to be a black man in America, say
