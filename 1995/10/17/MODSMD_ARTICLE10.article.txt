# Bookstore rebates 6 percent

Bookstore shoppers noticed the first major refund
rate decrease in recent years, as the Stanford Book
store began distributing rebate checks yesterday.
Ken Shark, director of operations for the Book
store, said that though the rebate has "been higher in
recent years," customers should keep in mind that
there is "no guarantee that there will be a rebate at
all."
This year, students should expect to receive a 6 per
cent rebate on all book purchases they made last year.
The refund rate has been much greater — about 15
percent — for the past three years, even though rev
enue was higher last year due to the World Cup and
other campus events.
The rebate decrease has not gone unnoticed by
returning students and faculty, who have asked Shark
about the decline. "We'd like it to be higher, too,"
Shark said.
This year's rebate totals $300,000, a 47 percent
decline from last year, when the Bookstore returned
$570,000. Shark attributed the steep decline to the
unpredictability of sales and costs that the Bookstore
faces every year.
According to Peggy Mendelson, president and chief
executive officer of the Bookstore, this year's rebate is
lower because the Bookstore had more one-time

expenses this year, such as interest on tax payments
and inventory updates.
Because more students are sending in more rebate
checks than in previous years, the money must be
divided among more people, making each person's
rebate smaller.
Last year, a record number of people requested
rebates from the Bookstore. More than 9,427 people
submitted receipts, 92 percent of whom were stu
dents. Mendelson explained this fact by stating that
"students recognize the value" of the rebate pro
gram.
Because the Bookstore serves the Stanford commu
nity as a non-profit business, it must divide the excess
portion of all profits with students, faculty and staff
who submit receipts by the June 30 deadline. The
amount of surplus available for rebate is determined
by the Bookstore's Board of Directors.
Rebates are given for all textbook and trade book
purchases, but not for magazines, souvenirs, or com
puter-related products.
"Our mission is to keep prices as low as possible,"
Mendelson said.
Students may pick up their rebate checks through
Thursday in front of the Stanford Bookstore from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Recipients should present their Stanford
ID card or any other form of valid identification. Any
checks not picked up at the Bookstore will be mailed.
