' Argentina upset over Evita portrayal
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — As if an
unflattering Broadway play wasn't enough: Now
Hollywood's plan to cast Madonna as Evita Peron
has Argentina crying for its legendary first lady.
The president is outraged. The archbishop calls
• it blasphemy. A local filmmaker has launched his
own production, with official support, to set the
record straight.
"Evita was a pioneering feminist, not the pros
titute others would have you believe," said movie
producer Victor 80.
Bo's film, to be called "Evita: The True Story,"
is backed by President Carlos Menem, who is a
Peronist, and will feature a squeaky-voiced
• Argentine soap opera star, Andrea del Boca. Pro
duction is to begin in March.
The Hollywood version of "Evita," directed by
Alan Parker, is set to go into production in Jan

uary and will be filmed mostly in Budapest, Hun
gary, a decision that producers said was based on
budgetary and not political concerns.
Saddam national support
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam Hussein's
unprecedented demand for his people's approval
has fueled speculation that he will follow up with
other gestures to shore up his sagging power at
home — and ease his bruising confrontation with
the United Nations.
Saddam, who has not tolerated dissent since he
took power in 1979, called a national referendum
Sunday to seek endorsement for seven more
years. Yesterday, the government said he won
99.96 percent of the vote in a ballot that produced
a 99.5 percent turnout.
Hundreds of people raced from their homes and
apartments in the city and fired handguns and AK
-47 rifles into the air to celebrate Saddam's victory.
