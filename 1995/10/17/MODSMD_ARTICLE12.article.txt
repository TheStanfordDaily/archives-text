# 'Million Man March' hits DC
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP> - In an
unprecedented gathering amid the
nation's monuments, hundreds of
thousands of black men shouted
promises to forswear violence and
improve their lives in a revival
style chant led yesterday by Nation
of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
Farrakhan's "Million Man
March" called together black men
for a peaceful day of praying,
singing and reveling in racial unity.
The throng, estimated by the U.S.
Park Police at 400,000, stretched
for 12 blocks down the grassy
expanse, from the foot of the Capi
tol to the Washington Monument.
March organizers asserted the
crowd numbered 2 million.
As the rally's dramatic finale,
Farrakhan spoke for 2 1/2 hours,
often addressing white America.
"White supremacy," he said, is the

root of America's suffering.
Farrakhan urged the men to go
home and join black organizations
— even those that refused to
endorse his rally — to take hold of
political power, unite against
racism and cleanse black commu
nities of crime, drugs and violence.
He brushed aside critics who
have condemned his inflammatory
statements about Jews, Catholics,
gays and Asians, saying he had
divine guidance in bringing to
Washington the largest assem
blage of black Americans since the
1963 March on Washington.
Civil rights veterans Jesse Jack
son. Rosa Parks and Dick Gregory
were among dozens of back-to
back speakers who spoke from
behind bulletproof glass. Stevie
Wonder sang briefly and Maya
Angelou read a poem urging the

crowd to do right by itself and
"save your race."
Several women spoke on stage,
but few were scattered through the
crowd. Farrakhan had asked them
to stay home to pray, fast and
teach the children. He also asked
all black Americans to stay home
from work or school and avoid
spending money.
At a speech in Austin, Texas,
President Clinton praised the rally
as an event for "black men taking
renewed responsibility for them
selves, their families and their
communities."
But he expressed disapproval of
Farrakhan. Without mentioning
the Nation of Islam minister by
name, the president clearly criti
cized Farrakhan's explosive
rhetoric that has brought charges of
anti-Semitism, sexism and bigotry.
