PHYSICS PROF. MARTIN
Perl's recent Nobel Prize adds
yet another accolade to the
list of great accomplishments
achieved by Stanford faculty. It also
brings greater attention to the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
which is often overlooked bv stu
dents at the University.
Most students who are knowl
edgeable about the achievements of
SI.AC research are physicists and
engineers who conduct experiments
there. Because of its isolated loca
tion away from campus, many indi
viduals remain unaware of the
tremendously important basic
research carried out at SLAC.
As budgets shrink, Congressional
leaders may criticize projects like
SI .AC as not having any relevance to
society. Money and energy spent on
basic research could be diverted to
lessen unemployment and provide
loans for financially needy college
students, they say.
However, budget cutters must

realize that basic research is the
bedrock of innovations that will
someday benefit society as a whole.
For instance, research innovations
have led to improvements in the
technology used in computers and
phones and have influenced our
lives considerably. In addition, even
remote discoveries concerning such
elementary particles can contribute
to society immediately by creating
more jobs, as people are employed to
answer questions in the realm of
quantum physics.
We would be foolish to overlook
the importance of basic research and
its potential impact on society.
Approaching matters from such a
perspective, we must prevent fur
ther federal cutbacks in the funding
of research programs conducted at
institutions like SI AC. It is our hope
that Perl's Nobel Prize will invigo
rate the efforts of University admin
istrators to fight continued cutbacks
in basic research currently taking
place in Washington.
