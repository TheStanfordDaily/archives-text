# The 						Delts' encore

CREDIBILITY DEPENDS on
adhering to a coherent and
fair policy when dealing with
particular issues.
In the past two months, Dean of
Students Marc VVais and Director
of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo have made two contra
dictory decisions concerning the
housing of Delta Tau Delta frater
nity, casting doubts on the resolve
and credibility of the Office of Stu
dent Affairs.
By re-examining the eviction of
the Delts, University administra
tors are setting a precedent. Any
fraternity that has been or is going
to be evicted can argue that it
should get additional chances to
appeal.
Wais said he was surprised the
Delts were allowed to keep the
house for as long as they have, as
the fraternity is deep in debt and
also faces charges of house mis
management. In an abrupt deci
sion, Wais announced he was evict
ing the Delts from their residence

by the end of fall quarter.
But in a surprise turn-around,
Wais said last week that he and
Camarillo would re-examine the
issue after the Delts submitted a
10-page letter outlining their rea
sons for maintaining control of the
house. By reopening the case, the
fraternity has gained an opportu
nity to avoid losing its house.
While we have not seen the con
tents of the Delt letter, we still
question Wais' decision to reopen
the case. If indeed the Delts are
allowed to keep their house, what
implication does that carry for fra
ternities like the Betas and Kappa
Alpha, who lost their houses in the
same swift manner but were not
accorded the same privilege of
appeal?
If the Office of Student Affairs is
going to reexamine the case of the
Delts, then it should have to recon
sider the eviction of the Betas and
Kappa Alphas to dispel the specter
of special privilege and double
standards.
