Parking oversight inadequate around campus

I JUST PURCHASED my $290 "A"
sticker on Friday. I waited until the
last day — the idea of paying so
much to park at work is appalling, so I
procrastinated until the last possible
moment.
I read over the pamphlet that
accompanied the license and I was
struck hy the complete falsehood con
tained in the section "Allocation"
which states, "We try to keep 'A' areas
big enough so there are vacancies at all
times of day. That's why they cost four
times as much as a 'C,' " etc. Who do
they think they are kidding?
I have worked at Stanford since
1989 and have purchased an "A" stick
er for most of that period. During that
entire time, I have worked in the Ter
man Engineering Center on Morris
Way and Santa Teresa and I have
NEVER found parking vacancies readi
ly available in any of the "A" lots adja
cent to this building except in the very

early morning hours.
During the winter months when it
rains heavily, it is even worse. The lots
are completely overwhelmed by people
parking illegally, seeking to avoid a
long walk in the rain. Contributing to
the problem are bikers who abandon
their hikes and illegally park in "A"
lots (a ticket for parking in an "A" lot
is the same as for violating a "C" lot.).
1 do not believe the University provides
enough oversight to keep non-license
holders out of the lots that others are
paying dearly for. Those who make the
sacrifice to buy a $290 license are com
peting everyday with people who flaunt
the rules and park in these prime lots.
I have heard many people say that
the number of tickets they receive
never exceeds the price of the initial
cost of the "A" sticker, so why buy it.
From my point of view, lack of ade
quate oversight is a serious omission
because the University is not protect-

ing the "package of rights" that are
implicit in the purchase of the license.
I believe inadequate oversight puts
Stanford on shaky ground when you
consider the business principle of
"good faith." Far too often, 1 find
myself thinking the price of the "A" is
nothing more than extortion on the
part of the University. 1 would like to
know the number sold each year in
relation to the number of increasing
spaces.
If the University has no cap on the
number it sells, and it increases the
number sold and not the overall num
ber of spaces available, that would
seem a rather dishonest business prac
tice. We are paying more and more for
the privilege of parking and receiving
less and less "product," if you will, and
at the same time, we are being paid
less and less to do more and more
work! Our increases, such as they
were, did not meet the regional con-

sumer price index, so they were not
increases in the real sense, but rather,
adjustments. I am more than disgrun
tled. I am disgusted with the Universi
ty's insensitivity to the working-class
people on this campus.
I do realize that demanding incr
eased oversight of the parking lots may
offend those employees who are unable
to afford an "A" license, or any license
for that matter, but I am only reacting
to the "system" that is being forced on
us, and make no mistake, it is a cut
throat, self-interested system that does
not consider need or any other egalitar
ian principle.
Spare me the air argument. When I
see the leaders of our country make
corporations get serious about it, I will
consider the efforts of employers to get
us out of our cars more seriously.
