# Kavenoki's letter about Simpson was insensitive
## 
### 
In attempting to express his convic
tion that O.J. Simpson is guilty, Gene
Kavenoki managed to write what
amounts to one of the worst cases of
insensitivitv and perhaps racism that I
have seen at Stanford in my four-plus
years here. If Kavenoki set out simply
to establish that he believes that
Simpson killed his ex-wife and Ronald
Goldman, I applaud him on coming to
the same conclusion that many have
— it is not a novel one.
Yet, there are other issues sur
rounding the trial, and Kavenoki's dis
missal and trivialization of them mere
ly expose how large these problems
actually are. He speaks sarcastically of
the "incessant barrage of social injus
tice which plagues poor blacks" which

"we privileged white folks cannot pos
sibly understand." He then proceeds to
speak of a "magical ghetto tour" in
which we would supposedly encounter
the "12 inner-city dullards" on the
Simpson jury.
This language is downright igno
rant and insulting. Many racial prob
lems in this country were revealed
during the case, and while they should
not have swayed the jury to acquit a
man whom the evidence strongly sug
gests is a double-killer, they do
deserve to be considered as actual
problems which need solving. Kaveno
ki deems it fit merely to ignore them.
He speaks like a spoiled prep boy
who considers the plight of minorities
in this country a burden which rests
heavily on him merely because he has
to listen to the complaints of people in
lower socioeconomic classes than him
self, let alone coexist with them. Right
at the point where he seems ready to

enter with some thought-provoking
commentary that inner city attitudes
towards police might cause police
hatred of minorities, he backs off, sim
ply saying, "It does not matter."
Well, it does matter — no, not nec
essarily in the direct context of the
Simpson trial. Obviously, these racial
issues were wrongly used by Simp
son's lawyers to acquit him and should
not have entered into the dialogue of
the trial. But they exist in the dia
logue of America, and this Kavenoki
refuses to see. As a white student on
this campus, I feel partly shocked and
partly ashamed by Kavenoki's incredi
bly insensitive treatment of real prob
lems which minorities face in this
country. Taking his language as an
example, I have little hope that they
do not exist just as acutely on this
campus as well.
