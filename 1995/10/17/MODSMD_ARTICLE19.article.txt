## The 						grapes of wrath 
### 
HERE ARE a few things to consider
before you vote on the grape boy
cott:
The grapes your dining hall buys won't
save any jobs.
The grapes your dining hall doesn't buy
won't save any lives.
At most, a single vote will affect the
grape-buying status of only a single dining
hall. Remember that the grape vote is not
run like an electoral college, where the
decision of each individual dorm might
effect the grape-buying status of the entire
Stanford campus.
So if this is true, what does the grape
vote mean? What does your vote mean?
The grape vote is about the message we
want to send. And coming from one of the
most prestigious universities in the world,
our messages carries a lot of weight.
As I see it, the message behind a boy
cott vote is this: the grape growers of Cali
fornia have to clean up their act. If they
continue to treat their field workers like
disposable napkins, they must be prepared
to face both economic and political reper
cussions.
The pro-boycott vote is also a show of
support for the Stanford Chicano commu
nity. For many years, the Chicano com
munity has worked diligently to put this
issue into the light of our otherwise apolit
ical lives. Through a fight which culminat-

Ed in the 1994 hunger strike, the pro-boy
cott supporters have successfully con
veyed their concern for the welfare of Cal
ifornia grape pickers.
On the other side, the message behind a
pro-grape vote is that we should respect
the right of field workers to make a living.
We should respect their right to support
their families, and we am trust the gov
ernment to assure their basic safety needs.
Although a vote for the boycott may be
a sign of support for the Chicano commu
nity, a vote against the boycott is not nec
essarily a vote against the Chicano com
munity. You can still have Chicano friends
if you vote against the boycott, and you
can still be "politically correct" if you vote
against the boycott. It is a mistake to
think of the Chicano or any ethnic popula
tion as a homogenous group where all
members think and act the same way. It
diminishes them as individuals, robbing
them of their right to disagree and form
opinions of their own.
The vote is about messages. Your
choice should not be based on what others
think is the right message to send. Your
choice should be based on what you feel is
the right message to send.
And however strongly you feel, one way
or the other, you must respect the right of
others to disagree. In contrast to what
many people would have you believe, this is

not a one-sided issue, where the pro-boy
cott supporters are the good guys and the
anti-boycott supporters are the bad guys.
There are valid arguments on both sides.
If your choice doesn't reflect you, your
vote is meaningless. For this reason, all
votes must be conducted through a hidden
ballot, which is the only way to both pro
mote free choice and negate the effects of
peer pressure. I recently heard of an inci
dent on the Row where the residence
assistant of a house gave a 10-minute lec
ture on why the residents must vote for
the grape boycott. Then, after refusing
requests for a secret ballot, the RA took a
public show of hands. The vote resulted in
nothing more than a kangaroo court. The
vote was the RA's vote multiplied by the
number of residents in the house.
It was a vote that robbed the message of
its meaning.
Take your decision seriously. The vote
is the result of years of protest. This isn't
about our ability to go to dining service
and get grapes as part of our lunch. This is
about the larger message we want to send.
