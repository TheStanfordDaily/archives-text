# Stanford reacts
## 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
While there has been little
debate that the idea behind
Louis Farrakhan's ''Million
Man March" on Washington
is positive, controversy sur
rounds the leader himself.
Farrakhan is known for
anti-Semitic, racist and vio
lent statements, and some
Stanford students say his
presence — and the absence of
women he insisted on at the
march — detract from the
benefits of the gathering of
African-American men.
Harriett Jernigan, a gradu
ate student, said: "The march
on Washington in the '60s was
not just blacks. It was every
one. As an African American I
don't appreciate other African
Americans who have racist
views towards other people.
You don't do to other people
what's been done to you for 400
years.
"They say separate the message
from the messenger, but he is the
person who takes credit for this
march. I'd rather see someone who
is for peaceful integration taking
action. Farrakhan doesn't stand for
integration, but exclusion. I don't
know how he can represent only
half of a people and still include
everyone," she added.

"Yes, the black man has been
held back a lot," she said, "but it
doesn't help to divide genders. As a
black woman I can't support him."
History Prof. Clay Carson spoke
of the march in his "Introduction to
African American Histoiy" class
today. "I find it very difficult to give
support to Louis Farrakhan when
he is calling for unity on his own
terms. "
Sophomore Adam Susman said,
"the exclusion of black women in
this march is a perfect example of
Farrakhan singling out what group
he thinks is being screwed."
"I think that what this march

has become is good, but the fact
that it is being run by Louis Far
rakhan and that the members of
the Nation of Islam are saying that
people who support this are sup
porting Farrakhan is not good. I
think that his ideas are very dan
gerous," said senior Kyle Stein
man.
John Lyo, also a senior, said,
"this march doesn't attack the real
problems of the black community,
like homelessness and poverty,
which are the root causes of vio
lence and tensions. If they want to
attack racism, this isn't the way to
do it."
