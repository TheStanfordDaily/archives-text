debate that the idea behind
Louis Farrakhan's ''Million
Man March" on Washington

rounds the leader himself.

anti-Semitic, racist and vio

Stanford students say his
presence — and the absence of
women he insisted on at the
march — detract from the
benefits of the gathering of
African-American men.

Americans who have racist
views towards other people.
