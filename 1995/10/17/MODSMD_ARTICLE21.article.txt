## The 						benefits of the CPPC 
### 
THE CAREER PLANNING and Placement
Center is a student service organization
under the Vice Provost of Student
Affairs. Its mission is to help students with
career-related issues throughout their Stanford
experience, as well as with the transition to
"the next step" when they leave the Farm
whether that next step leads them to graduate
studies, employment or "something else" of
their choosing.
The services offered are varied. They
include:
• a reference file service for students applying
to graduate school, or who need letters of rec
ommendation to support an application for
employment. (It is most appropriate for stu
dents seeking academic positions in higher edu
cation or those seeking teaching or administra
tive positions within public or private elemen
tary / secondary schools.)
• a counseling service which offers individual
and group counseling on career-related issues,
as well as workshops and special programs
throughout the year. The latter includes a fall
quarter World Opportunities Week for students
with international interests. During winter
quarter, the center sponsors a Public Service
Career and Internship Fair, a Summer Job
Week and a People and Professions Series of
panels of alumni representing different career
interests.
The counseling staff also offers a testing pro
gram to help students identify their skills and
interests. An alumni contact service which is
generated through the Alumni Association is
also available. It puts students in contact with
alumni who are willing to share their perspec
tives on their own chosen fields of work. While
the counseling staff works with all students in

their employment related-concerns, they are
particularly helpful to the students for whom
the on-campus recruiting program is appropri
ate.
• an on-campus recruiting program which
schedules approximately 8,000 interviews
between graduating students (B.A. / 8.5.,
M.A./M.S., Ph.D.) and representatives from
approximately 450 different recruiting organi
zations. The recruiting staff also coordinates
the annual Career Fair. The event, held last
Friday in White Plaza, hosted 192 employing
organizations. In May, the center coordinates a
Job Connection Day. Last year, 85 employing
organizations were represented. (Potential
employers were instructed not to come unless
they had jobs in hand.)
• a job listing service with information which
can be accessed in three ways — on the Internet
through JOBTRAK, through a telephone Job
Hotline and through a series of binders located
within the CPPC. The CPPC is also a major
contributor to Odyssey, the internship database
which can be accessed through Folio.
• a career resource library which is filled with
books, publications, periodicals, video tapes,
etc.
The CPPC now has a home page listing on
Stanford's home page. Check the quarterly cal
endar of events for further information.
The CPPC is filled with warm, fuzzy helpful
people who are very student oriented and whose
high for the day consists of hearing from a
happy student who has attained an immediate
goal, whether it be a part-time job, admission to
a favorite graduate school or securing an inter
view he or she really wanted.
