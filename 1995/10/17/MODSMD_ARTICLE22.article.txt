# Beyond the service of the CPPC
## A 						disgruntled student speaks 
### 
LAST WEEK, 22 years of
intense confidence building,
nurturing and feeding was
destroyed in two minutes.
It was two minutes at the
Career Planning and Placement
Center Recruiting Orientation
meeting that did it. All the hard
hours I put into convincing
myself that personality was all
that counts, all the strength I
mustered in the grocery store line
to read a Vogue and not cry and
my entire effort to pass my class
es became worthless. My entire
existence was soon to be judged
on my agility and skill with the
phone keypad.
With just a social security
number and touch-tone phone,
you can confirm within seconds
that you are completely unhire
able, undesirable and unlikeable.
That is, if you are organized
enough to call before 5 p.m. This
Thursday, if you happen to get to
a phone and check to see if you
were pre-selected — i.e. if you
looked beautiful on paper — you
may still lose your position to the
person who can snatch it away
from you the quickest. It's just
another aspect of the CPPC, or
the FCFS. It's the First Come
First Serve CPPC BBQ.
Your life is determined on your

ability to be the lucky 10th caller,
the first in line at Space Moun
tain, the brass ring holder.
My favorite part of the whole cir
cus, however, is the bidding.
Because when all else fails, at
least I'll have a better sense of the
odds when I head up to Reno to
try to pay off my student loans.
Not only do I have to to look deep
within myself, to reflect on my
past and project my future goals,
but I also have to second guess
everybody else's plan in order to
beat them and get that elusive
Solomon Brothers interview. Can
you ask for better corporate train
ing?
I have a big folder on my screen
entitled "Sell Out." Inside it
lurks my resume in several differ
ent fonts because I never know
when Times Roman will cut it. I
also have a number of cover let
ters which range in mood from
the"I won't accept less than 40 to
start," to "Plllllllleeeeeease."
Then there's the line that
supossed to separate me from
everybody else. The line that
states what I enjoy doing. Do they
really want to know about my
passion for boys with no hair?
Should I sound "out-doorsy" and
"down-to-earth" and say I like
kayaking, or should I go for a hip

per feel and expand on the bene
fits of swing dancing? Why
doesn't anyone give me this infor
mation?
1 scored big points at the career
fair last week. After awkwardkly
chit-chatting — in that inevitable
high voice — with the kind of
familiar faces that I was never
friendly with before, I managed to
accumulate five pens, three cups,
a water bottle, a t-shirt and a reg
ulation frisbee along with tons of
intense literature for the Coffee
House table.
So far, the best news I have
heard out of the CPPC is that
only '20 percent of Stanford stu
dents get jobs through their orga
nization. Yet, I am compelled to
use them. This Thursday, I go to
the phone to try my luck with the
keypad lotto. At the tone, I will
first admit that I am not a com
puter science major, then enter in
my social security number,
desired automobile, number of
kids I plan to raise, ideal zip code
and my latest religious affiliation.
"Thank you for playing, Ms. Van
Nostrand, would you like cinna
mon on that?"
