Stanford field hockey (6-4
overall, 4-1 Northern Pacific
Conference) completed the hat
trick against Pacific this past
Saturday. In the third and last
meeting this season between
the two teams, the Cardinal
once again shut out the Tigers
7-0 last weekend.
The Cardinal dominated
struggling Pacific in all aspects
of the game. The Tigers had
only two breakaways to its end
of the field and only one shot
attempt for the entire game,
which came in the second peri
od. In contrast, the Cardinal
fired 54 shots.
The already limping Tigers
lost even more players to
injury this week and played
without substitutes. "It was a
very lop-sided game," said Car
dinal head coach Sheryl John
son. "They had three more
injuries, so they played with

out substitutes. A couple of
their key players got injured
early on in the season and
aren't even playing any confer
ence games."
Bad luck has plagued Pacific
this season, and it detracted
from the Tigers' output this
year. "They are usually in con
tention for the NorPac title
just like us," Johnson said.
Pacific is in such bad shape
that it played its backup goalie
on the field to fill the positions.
But despite the fact that
Stanford defeated Pacific 3-0
and 5-0 earlier this season, the
Cardinal did not let up on the
Tigers one bit.
Four minutes and 15 seconds
into the game, freshman right
fielder Jordyn Kramer executed
a perfect penalty corner with an
assist from freshman midfielder
Justina Williams and freshman
center-forward Monique Ler
oux. Williams hit the ball into
the circle to Leroux, Leroux
stopped it and Kramer knocked
it in.
Five minutes later, sopho
more left fielder Paige Mader
took an assist from Leroux
around the goal keeper and put
it in the net. That concluded

the scoring for the first half,
Stanford came out fast in the
ond half and added five more to*
its tally.
"The halftime score was only
2-0," Johnson said. "We stiil
wanted to score more than two.
We didn't put in any stall tactics.
Their defense just wasn't mark
ing close enough in the circle for
us not to shoot."
