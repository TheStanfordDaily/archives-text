# Beware the Bills
## 
### 
There's a cold blustery wind
blowing from the North
east these days, but if you
think those chilly gales are simply
a sign of winter, you are sorely
mistaken. Those nippy breezes
are actually emanating from
another source, a source that has
blown often and blown strongly
in four of the last five winters.
The mere mention of this place
sends shivers of terror and fear to
men and women everywhere. The
very utterance of its name is
enough to make burly men cringe
in horror and even burlier men
cry like babies. Where is this
place, and who are these beings
causing widespread torment and
torture?
Two words: Buffalo Bills.

Believe it or not, after a one
year hiatus, it appears that those
Bills of Super Bowl snafu star
dom are once again stampeding
for another berth in the biggest
game on earth. While it's still
probably too early to tell, the Bills
are 5-1 nearing the halfway point
of the season, tied with Kansas
City for the best record in the
AFC. And while the Bills have
done this in an uncustomarily

inconspicuous manner, one needs
to wonder if a Super Bowl is in
the horizon. Probably not, but
football fans should still be aware
of the Bills as a clear and present
danger.
No doubt, the team's talent
does not come close to Buffalo's
Super Bowl teams of yesteryear,
but this year's squad still has
formidable personnel as well as
the intangibles.
While the offense, the line in
particular, has been pecked away
by free agency and age, the nucle
us of the team is still intact.
Gutsy quarterback Jim Kelly is
still throwing and chucking the
ball like a young buck despite the
myriad bumps, bruises and nicks
on his not-so-young body. Star
crossed running back Thurman
Thomas appears to have lost a
step or two, but like they say on
T.V., it's a step most running
backs don't have to begin with.
The Thurmanator is still a solid
all-around back that gets the job
done. The third member of the
offensive triumvirate, Andre
Reed, was knocked out of action
against the Jets, but will return
in six to eight weeks to provide
some great hands and some great
RAC (the new, trendy industry
word meaning run after the
catch) yardage.
Defense is where the Bills look
really strong. The free agency
acquisitions of linebacker Bryce
Paup and defensive end Jim Jeff
coat have vaulted Buffalo to the
top of the AFC defensive rank

Kao
ings. A front seven that includes
Paup and Jeffcoat along with Buf
falo mainstays Bruce Smith and
Cornelius Bennett is the stuff
with which nightmares are made.
The Bills started off the season
wretchedly, losing to Denver 22-
7, hut have since bounced back to
winning form, registering five
straight victories along with an
impressive and dramatic 22-19
triumph over fellow AFC Super
Bowl hopeful Cleveland in the
Dawg Pound.
Of course, the Hills aren't even
halfway there yet. They still must
face off against division rival
Miami twice. The Dolphins
appeared primed for Super Bowl
supremacy in the APT' hut have
floundered in the past two weeks,
losing to Indianapolis and laugh
able New Orleans. Of course, hav
ing Hall of Fame quarterback
Dan Marino on the sidelines
because of knee surgery doesn't
help Miami's cause.
The thing to remember, how
ever, is that with Miami's slide, if
the Bills were to enter the post
season with home-field advan
tage, look out. The single largest
intangible Buffalo had in its
Super Bowl years was Rich Stadi
um. The subzero, arctic hell-on
earth known as upstate New York
put the clamps on any teams
thinking about beating the Bills.
If late December or early January
rolls around and warm weather
teams like the Dolphins or
Raiders wander into Buffalo with
visions of Phoenix on their minds,
put your money on Buffalo.
Fans around the country must
ask themselves if they are ready
for another Bill appearance in the
Super Bowl. While it is a hypo
thetical situation at best, it's
always better to be safe than
sorry. Brace yourselves, because
it could happen.
Personally, it wouldn't be that
terrible to see the Bills again
would it? You've got to admire
that deep-down human quality of
persistence. The pathetic yet
heartwarming trait of striving for
a goal that can never be reached.

The fact that as long as there is a
microscopic chance there is uni
versal hope. If there ever was any
thing in sports that epitomized
life, it is the Buffalo Bills.
Then again, life is also scary
and nauseating sometimes, and
so are the Bills. After being throt
tled and thrashed in four straight
Super Bowls, the Bills have
already redefined the term
undead. Like zombies and vam
pires, these Bills cannot be killed
by conventional means, but we
fans can. We fans can readily be
victims of death by repetitive
boredom.
There is one type of boredom
characterized by watching Big
Skv football and Arena football.
But there is also a second, more
venomous type characterized by
watching bowling and growing
grass. Seeing the Bills in another
Super Bowl definitely falls in the
latter category.
We can no longer physiologi
cally bear to see Kelly bruised,
battered and beaten to within an
inch of existence. . . again. We
can no longer physiologically bear
to see Thurman embarrassed
time in and time out for either
forgetting a helmet (what an
idiot!) or fumbling a carry. . .
again. The last Super Bowl with
the Bills pushed us to the very
edge of existence. The next will
push us over.
And while no other AFC can
even match the Cowboys (Niners
who?) in the Super Bowl, at least
they would provide more interest
ing story lines. Miami could bring
their trillion-and-one ex-first
round draft picks to the table, and
t he Raiders could bring their tril
lion-and-one ex-convicts. But
don't overlook Buffalo. Despite
how much we want to forget them
and ignore them, out of sheer
fright and terror to see them in
yet another Super Bowl, they are
there.
Just remember that the wind
you feel rattling your blinds and
shivering your spine is more than
winds of autumn and winter.
While the Buffalo Bills remain
quiet and unnoticed now, they
could very well be lying in wait
until the Super Bowl Days of Jan
uary to rear their ugly heads.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

The Cardinal field hockey team's offensive charge trampled all over Pacific last weekend. The 7-0
shutout was Stanford's third victory this season against the Tigers.
