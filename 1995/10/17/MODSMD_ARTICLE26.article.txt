# Beware the Bills
## 
### 
There's a cold blustery wind
blowing from the North
east these days, but if you
think those chilly gales are simply
a sign of winter, you are sorely
mistaken. Those nippy breezes
are actually emanating from
another source, a source that has
blown often and blown strongly
in four of the last five winters.
The mere mention of this place
sends shivers of terror and fear to
men and women everywhere. The
very utterance of its name is
enough to make burly men cringe
in horror and even burlier men
cry like babies. Where is this
place, and who are these beings
causing widespread torment and
torture?
Two words: Buffalo Bills.

Believe it or not, after a one
year hiatus, it appears that those
Bills of Super Bowl snafu star
dom are once again stampeding
for another berth in the biggest
game on earth. While it's still
probably too early to tell, the Bills
are 5-1 nearing the halfway point
of the season, tied with Kansas
City for the best record in the
AFC. And while the Bills have
done this in an uncustomarily

inconspicuous manner, one needs
to wonder if a Super Bowl is in
the horizon. Probably not, but
football fans should still be aware
of the Bills as a clear and present
danger.
No doubt, the team's talent
does not come close to Buffalo's
Super Bowl teams of yesteryear,
but this year's squad still has
formidable personnel as well as
the intangibles.
While the offense, the line in
particular, has been pecked away
by free agency and age, the nucle
us of the team is still intact.
Gutsy quarterback Jim Kelly is
still throwing and chucking the
ball like a young buck despite the
myriad bumps, bruises and nicks
on his not-so-young body. Star
crossed running back Thurman
Thomas appears to have lost a
step or two, but like they say on
T.V., it's a step most running
backs don't have to begin with.
The Thurmanator is still a solid
all-around back that gets the job
done. The third member of the
offensive triumvirate, Andre
Reed, was knocked out of action
against the Jets, but will return
in six to eight weeks to provide
some great hands and some great
RAC (the new, trendy industry
word meaning run after the
catch) yardage.
Defense is where the Bills look
really strong. The free agency
acquisitions of linebacker Bryce
Paup and defensive end Jim Jeff
coat have vaulted Buffalo to the
top of the AFC defensive rank
