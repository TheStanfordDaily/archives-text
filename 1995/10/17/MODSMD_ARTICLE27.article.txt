## Cardinal volleyball unstoppable, rolling over Notre Dame in four sets

In a match that was supposed
to showcase the talents of two of
the top 10 women's volleyball
teams in the nation, the No. 4
Stanford Cardinal (15-2 overall,
9-0 Pacific 10 Conference), after
a rocky first game, stole all of
the thunder from No. 8 Notre
Dame and emerged with an
impressive 11-15, 15-4, 15-7, 15-
5 victory.
"We kept it simple tonight,"
said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"We struggled some with our
passing so we couldn't do as
much as we'd like with our
offense. We may not have excelled
in any particular aspect of the
game [tonight], but we're just
trying to win games."
Since the fifth match of the
season, when Stanford lost for
the second time, coach Shaw's
squad has followed his prescrip
tion to perfection. The Cardinal
has won 12 consecutive matches
and, in light of t he quality of their
opponents, can make a legitimate
claim to be the hottest team in
the country.
The decisive fourth game fea
tured a determined and fresh
group of Stanford starters and
reserves dominating the Irish's
exhausted starters. Throughout
the season, Stanford's ability to
run fresh players into its 6-2
offense has devastated opponents
later in matches.
Tonight, it was sophomore
Debbie Lambert who replaced
struggling sophomore Kristin
Folkl and responded with eight
digs to shore up a shaky Cardinal
defense. After getting consistent
play from senior outside hitter
Wendy Hromadka, Shaw changed
the pace of the match by inserting
senior Marnie Triefenbach into
the lineup.

"We brought her in to turn up
the heat in game four and show
them something they hadn't seen
before with Hromadka," Shaw said.
Triefenbach came through
with an impressive, if brief, out
ing, totaling three kills in just
four attempts for a .750 hitting
percentage.
Sophomore middle blocker
Barbara Ifejika complemented
Triefenbach's outside hitting.
Ifejika and Hromadka led Stan
ford with 10 kills apiece, while
Ifejika made only one hitting
error on her way to a .360 hitting
percentage. She also registered

five digs and seven blocks.
As a team, Stanford fired on
all cylinders in game four, hitting
.550 while holding the Irish to a
.103 percentage.
In game one, however, Stanford
did not look like it would run away
with the match. After the Cardinal
built leads of 6-0 and 9-4, a series
of errors allowed Notre Dame back
into the contest. Eventually, the
Irish capitalized on Stanford's
errors and took the game 15-11.
"We always seem to have one
rotation where we give up a lot of
points," Shaw said. "The prob
lem is that it's a different one
each match. Tonight, it was one
rotation in game one where they
scored a bunch of points. "
Notre Dame's early effective
ness stemmed mostly from out

standing defense, ror the match,
the Irish finished with 72 digs
compared with only 65 for Stan
ford, even though Notre Dame
offered the Cardinal 13 more dig
opportunities.
"They dug everything tonight,"
Shaw said. "It took us a while to
adjust to that and realize that we
couldn't constantly go for kills. If
they were going to dig everything,
we just needed to keep the ball in
play when our hitters weren't set
up properly and let our blocking
and defense win the rallies."
By game two, Stanford had the
Irish figured out and the Cardinal's
blocking attack took over. The
Irish seemed demoralized near the
end of game two, as kills were con
tinually returned to their side of
the court. Notre Dame never got

anything going, and Stanford went
to the break confidently on the
basis of a 15-4 victory.
After the break, Stanford kept
the pressure on. After opening a
10-4 lead, several hitting errors
allowed the Irish to climb to 10-
7. From there, however, Stan
ford's blocking attack was too
much for Notre Dame, and the
Cardinal scored five straight
points to take a two-games-to
one lead.
"After game one, we closed off
their down-the-line kills," Shaw
said. "We forced them to beat us
going crosscourt and they
couldn't do it."
Often criticized for not being a
great defensive team, Stanford
managed to hold an Irish team
that entered the match hitting

.'2BO as a team to a dismal 130
hitting percentage.
"People say we're not great
defensively, but Notre Dame hits
.130, Washington State (the Pac
-10 leader in hitting) hits .160
land) Nebraska hits .150. We
may not be great at blocking or
digging individually, but collec
tively we do the things that need
to be done on defense."
In particular, Stanford effec
tively neutralized Notre Dame's
freshman spark plug Lindsay
Treadwell. Treadwell, who nor
mally hits .400 off the bench for
the Irish, hit .000 against the
Cardinal last night. Equally
impressive was Stanford's ability
to limit Notre Dame's 6-foot-5
junior Jennifer House to a .000
hitting percentage.

"A lot of our opponents are hit
ting under 100 points below us,"
Shaw said "When that happens,
you're usually going to win."
National Player of the Year
Cary Wendell continued her stel
lar season, hitting a whopping
.381. She recorded eight kills, 26
set assists and 13 digs on the
night. In addition to her num
bers, Wendell's outside blocking
in game two helped force the
Irish hitters into uncomfortable
crosscourt attempts and turned
the tide in the Cardinal's favor.
Up next for the Cardinal is a
weekend showdown at Maples
Pavilion against UCLA and USC.
After sweeping both schools in
Los Angeles earlier this month,
Stanford will look to maintain its
one-game lead in the Pac-10.

.381. She recorded eight kills, 26
set assists and 13 digs on the
night. In addition to her num

in game two helped force the
Irish hitters into uncomfortable
crosscourt attempts and turned
the tide in the Cardinal's favor.
Up next for the Cardinal is a

Stanford 3 sets
HUotre Dame 1 set
I 4 -

In a match that was supposed
to showcase the talents of two of
the top 10 women's volleyball
teams in the nation, the No. 4
Stanford Cardinal (15-2 overall,
9-0 Pacific 10 Conference), after
a rocky first game, stole all of
the thunder from No. 8 Notre
Dame and emerged with an
impressive 11-15, 15-4, 15-7, 15-
5 victory.
"We kept it simple tonight,"
said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"We struggled some with our
passing so we couldn't do as
much as we'd like with our
offense. We may not have excelled
in any particular aspect of the
game [tonight], but we're just
trying to win games."
Since the fifth match of the
season, when Stanford lost for
the second time, coach Shaw's
squad has followed his prescrip
tion to perfection. The Cardinal
has won 12 consecutive matches
and, in light of t he quality of their
opponents, can make a legitimate
claim to be the hottest team in
the country.
The decisive fourth game fea
tured a determined and fresh
group of Stanford starters and
reserves dominating the Irish's
exhausted starters. Throughout
the season, Stanford's ability to
run fresh players into its 6-2
offense has devastated opponents
later in matches.
Tonight, it was sophomore
Debbie Lambert who replaced
struggling sophomore Kristin
Folkl and responded with eight
digs to shore up a shaky Cardinal
defense. After getting consistent
play from senior outside hitter
Wendy Hromadka, Shaw changed
the pace of the match by inserting
senior Marnie Triefenbach into
the lineup.

"We brought her in to turn up
the heat in game four and show
them something they hadn't seen
before with Hromadka," Shaw said.
Triefenbach came through
with an impressive, if brief, out
ing, totaling three kills in just
four attempts for a .750 hitting
percentage.
Sophomore middle blocker
Barbara Ifejika complemented
Triefenbach's outside hitting.
Ifejika and Hromadka led Stan
ford with 10 kills apiece, while
Ifejika made only one hitting
error on her way to a .360 hitting
percentage. She also registered

five digs and seven blocks.
As a team, Stanford fired on
all cylinders in game four, hitting
.550 while holding the Irish to a
.103 percentage.
In game one, however, Stanford
did not look like it would run away
with the match. After the Cardinal
built leads of 6-0 and 9-4, a series
of errors allowed Notre Dame back
into the contest. Eventually, the
Irish capitalized on Stanford's
errors and took the game 15-11.
"We always seem to have one
rotation where we give up a lot of
points," Shaw said. "The prob
lem is that it's a different one
each match. Tonight, it was one
rotation in game one where they
scored a bunch of points. "
Notre Dame's early effective
ness stemmed mostly from out

standing defense, ror the match,
the Irish finished with 72 digs
compared with only 65 for Stan
ford, even though Notre Dame
offered the Cardinal 13 more dig
opportunities.
"They dug everything tonight,"
Shaw said. "It took us a while to
adjust to that and realize that we
couldn't constantly go for kills. If
they were going to dig everything,
we just needed to keep the ball in
play when our hitters weren't set
up properly and let our blocking
and defense win the rallies."
By game two, Stanford had the
Irish figured out and the Cardinal's
blocking attack took over. The
Irish seemed demoralized near the
end of game two, as kills were con
tinually returned to their side of
the court. Notre Dame never got

anything going, and Stanford went
to the break confidently on the
basis of a 15-4 victory.
After the break, Stanford kept
the pressure on. After opening a
10-4 lead, several hitting errors
allowed the Irish to climb to 10-
7. From there, however, Stan
ford's blocking attack was too
much for Notre Dame, and the
Cardinal scored five straight
points to take a two-games-to
one lead.
"After game one, we closed off
their down-the-line kills," Shaw
said. "We forced them to beat us
going crosscourt and they
couldn't do it."
Often criticized for not being a
great defensive team, Stanford
managed to hold an Irish team
that entered the match hitting

.'2BO as a team to a dismal 130
hitting percentage.
"People say we're not great
defensively, but Notre Dame hits
.130, Washington State (the Pac
-10 leader in hitting) hits .160
land) Nebraska hits .150. We
may not be great at blocking or
digging individually, but collec
tively we do the things that need
to be done on defense."
In particular, Stanford effec
tively neutralized Notre Dame's
freshman spark plug Lindsay
Treadwell. Treadwell, who nor
mally hits .400 off the bench for
the Irish, hit .000 against the
Cardinal last night. Equally
impressive was Stanford's ability
to limit Notre Dame's 6-foot-5
junior Jennifer House to a .000
hitting percentage.

"A lot of our opponents are hit
ting under 100 points below us,"
Shaw said "When that happens,
you're usually going to win."
