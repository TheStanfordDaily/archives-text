In a match that was supposed
to showcase the talents of two of
the top 10 women's volleyball
teams in the nation, the No. 4
Stanford Cardinal (15-2 overall,
9-0 Pacific 10 Conference), after
a rocky first game, stole all of
the thunder from No. 8 Notre
Dame and emerged with an
impressive 11-15, 15-4, 15-7, 15-
5 victory.
"We kept it simple tonight,"
said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"We struggled some with our
passing so we couldn't do as
much as we'd like with our
offense. We may not have excelled
in any particular aspect of the
game [tonight], but we're just
trying to win games."
Since the fifth match of the
season, when Stanford lost for
the second time, coach Shaw's
squad has followed his prescrip
tion to perfection. The Cardinal
has won 12 consecutive matches
and, in light of t he quality of their
opponents, can make a legitimate
claim to be the hottest team in
the country.
The decisive fourth game fea
tured a determined and fresh
group of Stanford starters and
reserves dominating the Irish's
exhausted starters. Throughout
the season, Stanford's ability to
run fresh players into its 6-2
offense has devastated opponents
later in matches.
Tonight, it was sophomore
Debbie Lambert who replaced
struggling sophomore Kristin
Folkl and responded with eight
digs to shore up a shaky Cardinal
defense. After getting consistent
play from senior outside hitter
Wendy Hromadka, Shaw changed
the pace of the match by inserting
senior Marnie Triefenbach into
the lineup.
