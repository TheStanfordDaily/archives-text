The Stanford men's crew
team proved it is a force to be
reckoned with in the Cal Head
r;tce last Saturday. In the four
boat competition, Stanford per
formed beyond expectation,
bruising the egos of its confident
California opponents. The Cardi
nal's performance was exception-

'There's a different
energy level on the
team this year than
last year.'

al not only because Cal's team
had been on the water over a
month longer than Stanford's,
but also because of Cal's high
ranking.
"We showed, in all the pieces
(races), very good speed," said
head coach Wieslaw Kujda. "We
didn't expect to do so well since
Cal is considered top in the
nation."
In a competitive first piece,
the team's A boat managed to

beat Cal's A boat by a close mar
gin. Stanford narrowly lost the
second piece, however, placing
second and fourth. The Cardinal
came out strong in the third
piece, which turned out to be the
highlight of the race, as Stanford
defeated the Bears decisively.
"We won the third piece in a
dominating manner," Kujda said.
The Cardinal also performed
well in the fourth and final piece,
with the first boat losing to Cal
by only four seats. Although he
took last year off, junior Tor
Lundgren demonstrated a great
developing talent to lead the boat
and motivate his teammates.
"(Lundgrenl stimulated the
intensity among the team,"
Kujda said. "The coach can only
dream about I that kind of a per
formance]."
The Cal event, used in part as
a way of determining the best
lineup for the Head of Charles
this Saturday, brought together
the energy and emotion of the
team. "You could really feel the
power out there," said senior
rower Robert Bigler.
Junior Mike Schneider con
curred. "There's a different
energy level on the team this
year than last year," he said.
"We're fired up."
