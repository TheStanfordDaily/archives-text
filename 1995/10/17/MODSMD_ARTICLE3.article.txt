# Downsize of languages nears end
## Two-year process heads toward new grouping of smaller departments 
### Carolyn Sleeth Contributing writer 
For two years, language department faculty
members at Stanford have operated with the
threat of consolidation and cutbacks hanging
over their heads.
Now, the School of Humanities and Sciences
administration and the executive committee for
the new Division of Literature, Culture and Lan
guage — which oversees Stanford's six language
departments — will reach a decision t his week on
changes to the division's structure.
"We are coming to a close in the definition of
a plan," said John Etchemendy, senior associate

dean for the School of Human
ities and Sciences.
But some faculty members
— already worried that the
centralization of language and
foreign literature studies is not
beneficial to students — are
concerned about the further
changes that may result from
current discussions, including
the possible consolidation of

positions such jus financial consultant or com
puter consultant.
According to Spanish Prof. Mary Pratt, chair
of the executive committee for the language divi

sion, the committee has been meeting every
other week und has been looking at several is
sues, including the language departments' con
cerns about restructuring.
Pratt added she felt consolidation was need
ed. "Some departments could handle the tasks
they were responsible for, but small depart
ments have a hard time functioning," she said.
Other faculty see the changes as a continua
tion of recent patterns which may have dimin
ished the effectiveness of the language depart
ments.
"The staff restructuring is going to happen


Shoven
and it is under the prerogative of
the dean's office," said Gregory
Freidin, chair of the Slavic Lan
guages Department. "Not every
body is going to be happy."
Freidin said he feels there is still
no consensus between the execu
tive committee and the H&S
administration. "It's radical recon
struction," Freidin said. "We are
centralizing staff functions, and
some will be good and some bad."
Last year, the departments were
centralized under the new Division
of Literature, Culture and Lan
guage. Although they have retained
some autonomy, the reorganiza
tion has already resulted in many
changes for the departments.
While the language departments
used to report individually to the
dean's office, as is common with

most other dep;irtments, they now
report first to a committee oversee
ing both the division and the
departments, and then to the
dean's office.
Dick Schupbach, professor of
Slavic studies, said that he thought
students' interests would be better
served by individual, autonomous
departments. "These independent
city-state departments are just
bureaucracies," he said. "The only
authority that the departments
will have is over their administra
tive assistants."
Pratt contends that disagree
ment among members of the com
mittee is just "business as usual."
Elizabeth Bernhardt, director of
the new Language Center, said
that she felt the changes were only
positive.
"Any kind of change will be diffi
cult," said Bernhardt. "I perceive all
of these changes to be worth it, and
that things will be better in the end."
Other department faculty have

mixed feelings about the restruc
turing.
"The administration has been
active in [its] support for lan
guages, as shown by the creation of
the Division of Culture and lan
guages," said Ralph Hester, chair
of the French Department. "But
foreign literature is a fragile field,
and few people go into it. The Uni
versity doesn't take that lightly."
To have language scholars
teaching classes of eight people is
expensive and according to Hester,
"it is not in the University's atti
tude to recognize such extremely
specialized departments."
Although cuts in thp number of
professors don't seem likely, Hester
said he feels that the University only
measures by numbers, and it will
not be willing to pay for expertise in
a particular foreign literature.
Schupbach shares his sense of
befuddlement. "I don't know
whether [the H&S administration)
doesn't hear us, or what," he said.
