# Downsize of languages nears end
## Two-year process heads toward new grouping of smaller departments 
### Carolyn Sleeth Contributing writer 
For two years, language department faculty
members at Stanford have operated with the
threat of consolidation and cutbacks hanging
over their heads.
Now, the School of Humanities and Sciences
administration and the executive committee for
the new Division of Literature, Culture and Lan
guage — which oversees Stanford's six language
departments — will reach a decision t his week on
changes to the division's structure.
"We are coming to a close in the definition of
a plan," said John Etchemendy, senior associate

dean for the School of Human
ities and Sciences.
But some faculty members
— already worried that the
centralization of language and
foreign literature studies is not
beneficial to students — are
concerned about the further
changes that may result from
current discussions, including
the possible consolidation of

positions such jus financial consultant or com
puter consultant.
According to Spanish Prof. Mary Pratt, chair
of the executive committee for the language divi

sion, the committee has been meeting every
other week und has been looking at several is
sues, including the language departments' con
cerns about restructuring.
Pratt added she felt consolidation was need
ed. "Some departments could handle the tasks
they were responsible for, but small depart
ments have a hard time functioning," she said.
Other faculty see the changes as a continua
tion of recent patterns which may have dimin
ished the effectiveness of the language depart
ments.
"The staff restructuring is going to happen
