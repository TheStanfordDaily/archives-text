# Two new student groups join in affirmative action debate
## 
### Joe El Rady 
In the wake of Bay Area protests and on
campus discussions over affirmative action,
student leaders said yesterday they have de
cided to form two new groups to take part in
the debate.
While the protests will not affect the
University's affirmative action policy,
Stanford students have begun to mobilize
their troops and their rhetoric for the up
coming political battle.

Monisha Bajaj, a member of RAGE (Re
sistance Action Grassroots organizing Edu
cation), a group which recently participated
in the demonstration over affirmative ac
tion at UC-Berkeley, has started a Stanford
chapter of the student group Diversity in
Action. The group will be dedicated to pro
moting affirmative action and opposing the
initiative, which Bajaj said is "racist and
discriminatory."
"Affirmative action would not be neces
sary in an ideal world, but there needs to be

an equaling factor," Bajaj said.
Brian Burke, the founder of the new
group Students Against Racism, takes
issue with Bajaj's stance. Burke's non
partisan organization will be committed
to collecting signatures to place the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative on the No
vember 1996 ballot. The initiative, which
seeks to eliminate all preferences based on
race, sex and ethnicity in state and local
governments and public education, has
spawned much of the controversy sur

rounding affirmative action.
Both the Stanford Democrats and the
Stanford College Republicans have also po
sitioned themselves on the battlefield. Bill
Shen, co-chair of the Stanford Democrats,
said, "we think the battle will be won by the
vigor of youth and community activism."
In an attempt to foster these ideals, the
campus Democrats have invited the Rev.
Jesse Jackson to speak on Nov. 14. The
event, Shen said, would serve as a launch
ing pad for a network of community and

student organizations throughout the Bay
Area which will mobilize to support affir
mative action.
"We are confident that we will not only
kill this initiative, but also remind people of
an ugly practice in our society called
racism," he said.
"We refuse to allow the proponents of
(the initiative) to raise a smoke screen and
obscure the issue; affirmative action exists
to promote the fundamental
tenets of American democracy,
namely opportunity and equality,"
Shen said.
Julie Johnson, president of the
Stanford College Republicans, and
a supporter of the California Civil
Rights Initiative, commented that,
"the proponents of the initiative
derive their support on the basis of
fairness and the principles of the
civil rights movement which was
about ending discrimination and
creating a society based on individ
ual merits.
"This ideal is betrayed by affir
mative action which is patronizing
and insulting. I'm speaking as a
woman who would be insulted by
someone telling me I'd be better fit
for a job because of my gender,"
she said.
Johnson also responded to
Shen's view of an unleveled play
ing field and a racist society, say
ing, "affirmative action seeks to
lower the playing field to the low
est common level so that everyone
can play on it. Quotas and lower
standards won't solve the prob
lem."
