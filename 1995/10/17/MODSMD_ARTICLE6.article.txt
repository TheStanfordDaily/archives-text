# Out of the shower, onto the stage
## Opera-singing students show it's not just for the fat lady anymore

Some days Matthew Cavicke is a jealous lover; some days
lx)ri Jones is a scheming seductress. Some days Matthew Cav
icke is a drunken tyrant; some days Lori Jones is a lowly peas
ant. Most days, however, both are simply Stanford students
who love to sing opera.
Although they may at times take on stereotypical roles, Cav
icke, a baritone in his junior year at Stanford, and Jones, a lyric
soprano beginning her senior year, are quick to dispute the
common misconceptions surrounding opera and opera singers.
"Everybody assumes that the opera singer is going to be this
fat, enormous, braided, horned, Madonna breast-plated
woman who can barely stand on her own two feet and belts out
extremely loud notes," Jones said. "That may have been the
opera singer of the past, I don't know. ... But nowadays, more
opera singers could be models just as well."
Cavicke agreed, noting that opera often takes on a lighter,
more comedic role than it is often given credit for. "It's not all
whining and wailing," he remarked.
Both musicians discovered the injustice of such stereotypes
at early ages. Influenced by family records and CDs, the two
began cultivating their youthful passion for opera by singing in
the shower.
"I've always been interested in opera, but I didn't know how
much I could sing," Cavicke said. "I sort of kidded with myself,
like in the shower pretend to be Samuel Ramey."
The two started taking private voice lessons from Claire Gio
vannetti during their sophomore years at Stanford. Jones, who
played the lead in the Music Guild's production of "Hansel and
Ciretel" last February, also attended the Aspen Music Festival
during the summer. It was at Aspen — a nine-week program
taught by some of the top musicians in the country — that Jones
began considering the serious pursuit of opera as a career.

Although currently in the process of applying to several
graduate schools of music, Jones does profess a certain level of
uncertainty about the role of opera in her future.
"I'm a Christian, so I totally put my life in God's hands, and
wherever He leads me I'll go. And it may be opera, it may be

Senior Lori Jones and junior Matthew Cavicke both sing

something else, but we'll just see,"
Jones said.
In the meantime, however,
both singers commit much of their
time toward opera, oflen spending
long hours rehearsing. Jones
trains about nine hours per week
while Cavicke tries to practice
every day.
As musicians, both must also
take special care of their instru
ments. For Jones and Cavicke,
that means avoiding certain foods
and drinks which might have
adverse affects on their voices.
As Jones remarked, "The thing
about singing that doesn't really
apply to a lot of other instruments,
is that you carry your instrument
with you all the time, and what
you do, even the slightest thing,
may or may not affect it."
The idea of the voice as an
instrument extends to the field of
opera criticism, where the focus of
discussion rests on the voice rather
than the singer.
"Teachers try to avoid attack
ing a person directly, or criticizing
any particular aspect of the per
son," Cavicke explained.

For Jones, the need for dramat
ic as well as vocal talent provides
opera with much of its attraction
and uniqueness. "Not every actress
has to be able to sing," she said. "A
popular singer does not necessarily
have to be able to act. But an opera
singer has to do both."
The stories these characters tell
through song can often surprise
the unsuspecting audience mem
ber. "A lot of people think opera's
got to be the most boring thing in
the world," Jones said. "But if you
go to a few operas, you realize a lot
of opera has to do with sex, mur
der, love, jealousy — a lot of the
things that you'll find in motion
pictures, in novels."
As Cavicke pointed out, opera
was once a major form of enter
tainment. "It was their sit-com at
the time," he said.
According to Jones, many of the
themes addressed in opera are still
relevant today.
"A lot of operas may take place
100, 200, 300 years ago, but the
stories are still the same," she said.
And in the case of Lori Jones
and Matthew Cavicke, people are
still singing opera at Stanford —
some days transcending the
stereotypes of the present, some
days sustaining the standards of
the past.
