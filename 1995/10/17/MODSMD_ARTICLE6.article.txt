# Out of the shower, onto the stage
## Opera-singing students show it's not just for the fat lady anymore

Some days Matthew Cavicke is a jealous lover; some days
lx)ri Jones is a scheming seductress. Some days Matthew Cav
icke is a drunken tyrant; some days Lori Jones is a lowly peas
ant. Most days, however, both are simply Stanford students
who love to sing opera.
Although they may at times take on stereotypical roles, Cav
icke, a baritone in his junior year at Stanford, and Jones, a lyric
soprano beginning her senior year, are quick to dispute the
common misconceptions surrounding opera and opera singers.
"Everybody assumes that the opera singer is going to be this
fat, enormous, braided, horned, Madonna breast-plated
woman who can barely stand on her own two feet and belts out
extremely loud notes," Jones said. "That may have been the
opera singer of the past, I don't know. ... But nowadays, more
opera singers could be models just as well."
Cavicke agreed, noting that opera often takes on a lighter,
more comedic role than it is often given credit for. "It's not all
whining and wailing," he remarked.
Both musicians discovered the injustice of such stereotypes
at early ages. Influenced by family records and CDs, the two
began cultivating their youthful passion for opera by singing in
the shower.
"I've always been interested in opera, but I didn't know how
much I could sing," Cavicke said. "I sort of kidded with myself,
like in the shower pretend to be Samuel Ramey."
The two started taking private voice lessons from Claire Gio
vannetti during their sophomore years at Stanford. Jones, who
played the lead in the Music Guild's production of "Hansel and
Ciretel" last February, also attended the Aspen Music Festival
during the summer. It was at Aspen — a nine-week program
taught by some of the top musicians in the country — that Jones
began considering the serious pursuit of opera as a career.

Although currently in the process of applying to several
graduate schools of music, Jones does profess a certain level of
uncertainty about the role of opera in her future.
"I'm a Christian, so I totally put my life in God's hands, and
wherever He leads me I'll go. And it may be opera, it may be
