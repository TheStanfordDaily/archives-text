# Region has highest percentage of bachelor's degrees
## Stanford called most educated

Move over, U.S. News and World Report:
a new survey in this month's American De
mographics magazine declares Stanford,
Calif., "the most educated place in the na
tion."
The article, which classified communi
ties based on the percentage of adult resi
dents with bachelor's degrees, ranked Stan
ford at the top of its "101 Smartest Places"
list. Moreover, four of Stanford's neighbor
ing towns and cities were also ranked in the
top 101, reinforcing the south Peninsula's
position as one of the pre-eminent intellec
tual centers of the United States.
Basing its studies on 1990 census data,
American Demographics examined the edu
cation statistics of every town, city, bor
ough, township, village and "census-desig
nated place" in the United States with a
population over 2,500. Rankings were then
computed based on the percentage of resi
dents aged 25 and over holding bachelor's
degrees.
Stanford is classified as a "census-desig
nated place" â€” an area with a zip code that
does not fit into any standard categories.
Of Stanford's 6,090 residents 25 or over,
90.9 percent had at least a bachelor's de
gree. Chevy Chase, Md., ranked second with
only 80.2 percent university graduates.
Although the case can be made that the
statistics are misleading because Stanford's
adult residential community consists al
most exclusively of graduate students, pro
fessors and their spouses, there were other
residential, incorporated college campuses

that were not as highly ranked. For in
stance, only 74 percent of the adult resi
dents in Princeton, N.J., hold bachelor's de
grees.
Several communities in Stanford's near
vicinity were also highly ranked, including
Portola Valley (fifth), Los Altos Hills (27th),
Atherton (34th) and Palo Alto (71st).
Andrew Coe, the University's director of
community relations, said that Stanford's
close relationship to surrounding commu
nities may help to explain the strength of
the area in general.
"We have a lot to offer them in terms of
institutional resources, and they in turn
offer us good local resources," Coe said. "All
of these communities have advantages that
complement each other, and [the survey]
speaks highly for the mid-Peninsula region
in general."
He also commented that the location of
Stanford and the other ranked towns at the
periphery of Silicon Valley helps to explain
the high percentage of college-educated peo
ple living there.
The 101 places in the survey encompass
800,000 total residents aged 25 or over, a
full two-thirds of whom hold bachelor's de
grees.
In comparison, the figure is only 20 per
cent for adults nationwide.
Stanford also placed second on the Amer
ican Demographics list of places with a high
foreign-born population; 23.4 percent of
Stanford residents are not natives of the
United States. Los Altos Hills and Palo Alto
ranked ninth and 13th respectively in this
category.
