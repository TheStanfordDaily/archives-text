We're looking for someone to manage The Daily's online activities, including our
World Wide Web page and future projects. If you have some experience with pro
gramming and computers, this could be the job for you. Work with a staff of eager
programmers to update and improve our cranky Web page â€” and to expand our
online capabilities even further. It's a great experience, and it even pays.
Call Sarah Katz (723-2555 x.501) or Sarah Nixon (723-2555 x.301) for more info.
