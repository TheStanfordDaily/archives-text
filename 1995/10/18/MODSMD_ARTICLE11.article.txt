# Bomb explodes in Paris subway
## 29 wounded in rush-hour attack; Algerian group believed responsible 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Mocking the efforts of des
perate police, the bombers terrorizing Franee
blew up another crowded subway car yester
day, turning it into a mass of mangled steel
and thrashing injured.
The bomb wounded 29 people, blowing off
the legs and feet of some riders. Authorities
described it as a steel canister filled with
explosives and hex nuts — the trademark
device of Algerian insurgents who have waged
a terror campaign in the French capital since
midsummer.
Rush hour was nearingfull swing when the
blast shredded the second car of the RER
regional subway train at 7:05 a.m., just as it
passed the Orsay Museum in the heart of
Paris.
Silver-helmeted firefighters carried
writhing victims on stretchers out of the
Orsay Museum station, where commuters
described a darkened tunnel filled with smoke
and cries for help from injured passengers.
Red-and-white police tape ringed the
entrance to the station next to the art muse
um, and fire, police and rescue vehicles filled
the street. Helicopters airlifted out the most
seriously hurt.
The site of the attack seemed to mock
authorities' efforts to halt the terror cam
paign by Algerian extremists, who have
claimed responsibility for seven other deadly
bombings or attempts. Islamic militants
object to France's financial support of the mil
itary-installed government in Algeria, a for
mer colony.
The explosion occurred between the St.

Michel and the Orsay Museum stations along
the Seine River in central Paris and across
from the Louvre Museum. The subway line is
a main artery used by commuters living in
middle-class suburbs south and west of the
French capital.
"We're all a little bit traumatized right
now. It's happened too many times," said
Anne Guescoux, who fearfully took the same
subway line to her suburban home late yester
day.
"There's a psychosis now among the popu
lation," she said. "No one knows what to do."
Officials issued an alert for a dark blue
BMW with three people aboard that had been
spotted in the area, but no arrests were made.
The bomb was a commercially available
steel gas canister, a slightly smaller version of
the propane containers used on many barbe
cue gas grills. Police say the terrorists
unscrewed the valve, packed the canister with
hex nuts and explosive powder and replaced
the valve, attaching a detonator activated by a
timer.
Shrapnel from the bomb severed the feet of
several passengers, according to Olivier Lam
our, a doctor on the scene.
President Jacques Chirac, cutting short a
trip to central France, expressed his "indigna
tion" at the latest attack and he said he was
determined "to do everything to prevent and
repress this fanatic violence."
Premier Alain Juppe told a hushed Nation
al Assembly that France "will not let itself be
intimidated" and "will not capitulate in the
face of barbarism.

"France has been targeted, France has
been directly threatened, France has been
heinously challenged by blind and cowardly
terrorism," the prime minister said.
France's wave of bombings began July 25
at the St. Michel station, when a similar device
killed seven people and wounded 84. Yester
day's bombing raised the injury toll since then
to at least 155.
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said
police — already omnipresent with 14,500
extra soldiers and officers on the streets —
would step up patrols further and that more
identity checks would be conducted. The gov
ernment has already made 1.8 million checks
since the first bombing.
Reflecting the country's frustration, Jean
Bergougnoux, head of the French national
railroad, announced even tighter security and
vigilance on all subways and commuter trains.
But he noted the difficulty of policing a net
work of "385 stations and 5,000 trains that
transport 2 million travelers every day."
By the evening rush hour, the daily grind
had resumed even near the blast site, where
youngsters ran around and skated. Both com
muters and travelers took comfort in the
notion that terrorists would not strike twice
in the same spot — at least not on the same
day.
"They've already hit this station so it's
pretty safe to be here," said Janette Alexan
der, a tourist from Charleston, S.C.
The extremist Armed Islamic Group based
in Algeria has claimed responsibility for most
of the other bombings.
