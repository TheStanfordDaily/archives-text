# Gingrich determined to pass spending bill despite veto threat
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Determined
to ensure passage of their huge budget
balancing bill, House Republican leaders
agreed yesterday to boost Medicare
reimbursements for rural America and
considered other late changes in Medi
caid and environmental provisions.
Speaker Newt Gingrich and other
GOP leaders are meeting daily with
rank-and-file lawmakers nervous over
numerous pieces of the seven-year pack
age of spending reductions and tax cuts.
The House plans to vote tomorrow on
extracting $270 billion in savings from
Medicare, the biggest »nt the
deficit cutting bill It will vote next
Tuesday on the entnv $M 94 billion mea
sure, just as. the Senate debates a similar
bill.

No one doubts that majority Republi
cans will force both measures through
the House, ignoring President Clinton's
veto threats. But Gingrich and his
deputies may change provisions on
health, labor protection, oil drilling and
other items to ensure against significant
defections.
"If it changes, it's not because we're
experiencing failure," House Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-
Ohio, said of the deficit-cutting mea
sure. "It's because we're being reflec
tive "
Alsi bt mg worked into final form by
the leaders will be reductions in farm
payments and civil servants pensions,
which House committees could not com
olete due to bitter disputes among

Republicans.
The days before a big, close vote are
always the best time for legislators to
issue demands.
"If 15 to 18 of us defect, the bill fails,"
said Rep. Douglas Bereuter, R-Neb.,
among the farm-state lawmakers seek
ing Medicare changes. "This is the time
we have to exert leverage."
Republicans defend the last-minute
alterations as standard procedure when
leaders need to nail down votes, a tactic
used often by Democrats when they con
trolled Congress. The GOP has a 233-
199 edge over Democrats, with one inde
pendent and two vacancies — a narrow
margin when 218 votes are needed to
guarantee passage.
Democrats are using the occasion to

accuse Gingrich, R-Ga., of cutting back
room deals with special interests. Last
week, the American Medical Association
won concessions on fees doctors would
receive for treating Medicare patients
after a private late-night meeting with
the speaker.
"It's another midnight bill nobody's
ever seen," House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said of the
changes Republicans are mapping.
"Something this important should not
be done by one person or one group of
people in the dead of night."
The changes will be formally sanc
tioned by the leadership-controlled
House Rules Committee tomorrow, and
added to the budget-balancing bill dur
ing next Tuesday's debate. Meanwhile,

Gingrich and other leaders are enter
taining a steady stream of requests for
changes from GOP moderates and oth
ers protecting home-state interests.
During a closed-door session Tuesday
morning with farm-state lawmakers,
Gingrich and other House leaders
agreed to raise the minimum amounts
rural health providers would receive for
treating Medicare patients, said
Bereuter and other participants.
In response to complaints from other
groups, GOP leaders are all but certain
to delete a provision repealing the 64-
year-old Davis-Bacon Act, which lets the
government require union-level wages
for employees of federal contractors.
The move is designed to satisfy North
ern, union-state lawmakers.
