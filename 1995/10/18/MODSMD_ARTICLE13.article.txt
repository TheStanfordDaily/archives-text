Iraqi leader inaugurated
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam Hussein was
sworn in as president of Iraq for another seven
years yesterday and thanked the nation for
endorsing his leadership in a landslide referendum.
In a nationally televised speech, Saddam said
Sunday's vote had allowed Iraqis "to declare to
the entire world that after a war and an embargo
designed to exterminate them . . . they are still. . .
a faithful and capable people."
Earlier yesterday, Saddam's deputy prime min
ister announced political reforms that include
parliamentary elections next year.
The parliamentary vote is part of Iraq's effort
to make the transition from "revolutionary legiti
macy to constitutional legitimacy," Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters.
Saddam, who shunted his cousin Gen. Ahmed
Hassan al-Bakr aside as president July 16, 1979, was
sworn in after a sweeping election victory in which
he, the only candidate, won 99.96 percent of the vote.
There has been growing speculation that Sad
dam, who has ruled Iraq with absolute power
since taking power, would seek to improve hi.s
regime's tarnished image after triumphing in
Sunday's one-candidate referendum
Hut earlier reforms Saddam has promised pre
viously have never materialized and Iraq's 250
member parliament remains a rubber-stamp body
called on to endorse Saddam's decisions.
Recyclables trading market opens
CHICAGO (AP) — Forget junk bonds. Now
they're tradingjunk.
A national marketplace for buying and selling
recyclable trash opened yesterday at the Chicago
Hoard of Trade. The first transaction: Weyer
haeuser Co. bought 100 tons of old newspapers
from Oswego County, N Y
The venture promises to boost recycling by set
ting quality standards and publicizing prices for
used paper, glass and plastics. It can help small
towns with curbside collection programs find big
buyers of reusable materials.
"This is the biggest shot in the arm for recy
cling in this country since municipal recycling
efforts began in the 19705," said Mark Liechten
stein, Oswego County's trash manager and presi
dent of the National Recycling Coalition, which
includes both buyers and sellers of recyclables.
Eventually, the Hoard of Trade may launch
futures and options contracts for recyclables,
turning old beer bottles and milk jugs into invest
ment vehicles.
Halloween party ban rescinded
LOS ALTOS Calif (AP) It was a scary sight
for thi Los Altos school bouid hundreds of peo
pie, some in cost unit howling about a ban on Hal
loween celebrations at six elementary schools.
Perhaps spooked Monday night by the overflow
turnout at the hearing, the board voted 4-0, with
one abstention, to allow holiday activities in the

classroom.
"I think they were persuaded that Halloween is
not a religious holiday, just a holiday that is viewed
as religious by some people and there is a differ
ence," Superintendent Margaret Gratiot said.
The board voted two weeks ago to reschedule
costume parades or Halloween parties for after
school hours because some parents felt the holi
day has satanic connotations.
The ruling set off such a chorus of b<x>s that the
board voted to return to its former policy. Schools
will l>e allowed to schedule their own celebrations,
either during school time, after class or on weekends.
Students whose parents object will be allowed
to go home.
Kvetchers decry use of 'Oi'
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — A garage-band grunt
was enough to earn three teen-agers a trip to
police headquarters and suspension from school.
The lesson is, don't yell "Oi!" in a crowded hall.
Someone may think you're anti Semitic.
The three Hasbrouck Heights juniors per
formed at a high school talent show Thursday
night, where a $100 prize was offered for the
group that got the loudest applause.
Since the music they play is sometimes called
"Oi" — "Oi! Oi! Oi!" is a typical chorus — the
three 16-year-olds of Utter Confusion started
yelling, "Oi!" to warm up the crowd.
The crowd yelled "Oi!" back.
Then two people in the audience went to school
official.-* complaining "Oi!" is an anti-Semitic slur.
("Oi!" sounds like "Oy!" — a Yiddish expression of
dismay.) The 16-year-olds, Len Longo, J.M. Burr
and Albert Min, were kicked out of school for a
week and called to police headquarters.
No charges were filed.
Barbara Hush named a Tree Spirit'
ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — Sporting her trade
mark faux pearls and no-nonsense grit, former
first lady Barbara Hush said yesterday she doesn't
miss much about Washington — and she's not
about to recommend the White House to friends.
"I don't really miss it, no. I always thought peo
ple who missed things were either stupid or
dumb. If you don't like what you're doing, change
it," Bush said at an awards luncheon honoring
her work on literacy.
After describing life outside the White House
as a whirlwind of ceremonies, dedications and
international travel, Mrs. Bush had this to say of
life with a one-term president: "He may not be
able to keep a job, but he's never boring."
Boring, no. But maybe a little inhibited.
Barbara Bush, 70, said her husband was "a tad
amused" that she had been chosen for the Free
dom Forum's 'Free Spirit" award.
Then, handed the silver award and told it gives
her license to exercise her free spirit, the former
first lady grinned.
"I think that should go in the bedroom," she
said.
