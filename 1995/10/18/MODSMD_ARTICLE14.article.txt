# Serbs warned to restore water

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze
govina (AP) — A government
minister warned of trouble yes
terday if Serbs don't restore
water to Sarajevo, a threat
apparently designed to move the
Bosnian capital's fate to center
stage in upcoming peace talks.
In Washington, top foreign
affairs and defense officials said
U.S. ground troops who would
police a future peace settlement
will use force or do "whatever is
necessary" to operate freely in
Bosnia.
Serbs want part of Sarajevo in
any peace settlement, and have
not fully lifted their siege of the
capital. The Muslim-led govern
ment says the city cannot he
divided, and so far Western pow
ers have backed that position.
President Alija Izetbegovic
met with city officials yesterday
to "confirm our commitment for
a unified . . . city" in advance of
Oct. 31 peace talks in the United
States.
Meanwhile, a U.N. aid convoy
rolled into the isolated govern
ment enclave of Gorazde without
— for the first time in two years
— the usual Serb harassment.
An open route to Gorazde was
one of the Bosnian government's
main conditions in agreeing to a
countrywide cease-fire.
Residents lined the streets of
the shell-battered eastern city to
greet the convoy, many express
ing disbelief at the ari ;al of out
siders.
"You really came from Saraje
vo?" cried one old woman.
"I haven't been to Sarajevo for
nearly four years," said 23-year
old Armin Hoso. "The people
here hope the road will open."
The road to Gorazde is still
not secure for all non-military
and U.N. traffic, but yesterday's
convoy was the first to reach the
government-held pocket south
east of Sarajevo without prior
Serb inspection.
Another key condition of the
U S.-brokered truce was the
restoration of utilities to the cap
ital. Natural gas and electricity
have returned to most of the city,
but water service — not specifi
cally mentioned in the accord —
remained spotty.
"We promised people to lift
the siege of Sarajevo . . . either
by diplomatic means or by force,"
said Hasan Muratovic, the gov
ernment minister for relations

with the United Nations. "So if
water is not supplied, we consid
er that the Serbs are not comply
ing with the cease-fire agree
ment."
Muratovic contends that
Serbs are not letting water reach
the city from a main pumping
station in the western suburb of
Bacevo. Less than half the city's
needs can be supplied bv other
wells.
In an unusual joint appear
ance before a congressional com
mittee in Washington, Secretary
of State Warren Christopher,
Defense Secretary William
Perry, and Gen. John Sha
likashvili, chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff, defended adminis
tration plans to send ground
troops to Bosnia as part of a
NATO peacekeeping force.
Perry and Shalikashvili said
the estimated 20,000 U.S. troops
would not be in Bosnia for more

than a year and that other coun
tries would have to pay the
upkeep of any peacekeepers they
contributed.
Sporadic fighting persisted in
northwestern Bosnia, but U.N.
officials said it had little military
significance.
The reduced fighting was good
news for U.S. mediator Richard
Holbrooke and other envoys
meeting in Moscow to discuss
peace plans and Russia's role.
Holbrooke said mediators
made only limited progress in
talks Tuesday, but would have
fared worse without Russia's
help.
"There is much too much
assumption (hat we've got peace
around the corner," the assistant
secretary of state said. "It isn't
around the corner. All the major
issues between the Bosnians and
Serbs and Croatians are still in
dispute."

tration plans to send ground
troops to Bosnia as part of a
NATO peacekeeping force.
Perry and Shalikashvili said
the estimated 20,000 U.S. troops
would not be in Bosnia for more

than a year and that other coun
tries would have to pay the
upkeep of any peacekeepers they
contributed.
Sporadic fighting persisted in
northwestern Bosnia, but U.N.
officials said it had little military
significance.
The reduced fighting was good
news for U.S. mediator Richard
Holbrooke and other envoys
meeting in Moscow to discuss
peace plans and Russia's role.
Holbrooke said mediators
made only limited progress in
talks Tuesday, but would have
fared worse without Russia's
help.
"There is much too much
assumption (hat we've got peace
around the corner," the assistant
secretary of state said. "It isn't
around the corner. All the major
issues between the Bosnians and
Serbs and Croatians are still in
dispute."

French U.N. peacekeepers distribute food in Gorazde. A supply
convoy reached the beleaguered government-held city in eastern
Bosnia yesterday, as the Serbs blocking the road began observing
the cease-fire.
