Stanford should not
transform resident
assistants into cops

IT'S NOT EASY to describe the
job of a resident assistant.
Words like "friend," "adviser,"
"organizer" and "leader" come to
mind, but it's impossible to accu
rately define what is arguably one
of the toughest jobs on any college
campus.
Perhaps it's easier to say what
the position should not be: An RA
is not and should never be a police
officer.
Yet, recent actions by the Univer
sity and Residential Education have
created a perception — whether it is
true or not — that Stanford is mov
ing to enforce its alcohol policy
more aggressively, with residence
staff on its front lines.
Last week, ZAP Kitchen Man
ager Brian Lui was asked to relin
quish his position and vacate
housing after buying alcohol for
House Manager Michael Eubanks,
who had allegedly entered the
room of two female residents
naked in the middle of the night.
Res Ed issued warnings to three
other residence staff members
who were present while the alco
hol was consumed, including the
house's RA.
Res Ed representatives deny
that these actions represent any
sort of official escalation of alcohol
policy enforcement. Still, starting
off the year by kicking out one res
idence staffer and warning several
others has sent a clear signal,
whether intentional or not, to the
rest of the campus that they are
watching.
This is unfortunate. In the past,
Stanford has promoted a cautious
yet effective unofficial policy on
the issue: Underage drinking is
against the law, but RAs did not
need to stop anyone from doing it
or do anything to encourage the

practice. The advantage of this
stance is clear. It creates a trusting
atmosphere in the dorm by not
compelling RAs to take on an
arguably futile task — stopping
underage drinking.
If Res Ed is rethinking its alco
hol policy enforcement, its policy
makers should remember that the
RA role defines the atmosphere of
a particular residence, and that
any substantial change in that role
will have significant repercussions
on Stanford residential living.
It is somewhat disturbing that a
staff member was punished for
doing little more than drinking
with friends in the dorm, even
though one of them was underage.
However, this incident was just a
single situation with a unique
response.
If anything, the incident does
serve to raise a bigger question —
should the University be allowed
to hold staff members responsible
for the actions of their residents?
This is a difficult question and is
worthy of discussion. Still, it would
be hard to create a rule applicable
to all situations — there are just
too many gray areas.
A few things are clear. RAs must
act to promote a safe and conge
nial house atmosphere. RAs
should also maintain the trust of
all residents. They should be avail
able to anyone who has a problem
or needs advice.
In the near future, Res Ed
should publicly clarify just what
its alcohol enforcement policy is —
and if there are any changes in the
works — to both RAs and the rest
of the University.
At last week's ASSU Senate
meeting, new Dean of Students
Marc Wais announced that a task
force will be created to study the
policy under Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds. If such a task force does
move forward, it will be extremely
important to solicit student input
on the role of residence staff.
We doubt that many students
would ask for more dorm police
officers.
