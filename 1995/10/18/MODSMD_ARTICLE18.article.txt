## Football and the CIA 
### 
SO lIOW WAS Homecoming Weekend
for you? I liked seeing our
antecedents revisiting their old home.
Some of them seemed so lovably avuncular
that I could barely restrain myself from
hugging them and following them back to
the Stanford Park Hotel. It was also fun to
see them wander around in autos and on
foot around a campus that has (for our old
est brothers and sisters) changed remark
ably. I felt so wise to know before them
that, unless they immediately put on the
brakes, their Cutlass Ciera would have a
high-level meeting with some bollards.
And of course, I appreciated the unat
tended bottles of wine at each little reunion
tent.
But what about the football game? Why
can't we win at home? Too many empty
seats? Anyway, I had an interesting little
encounter during halftime. Bored with
watching the Band play a meager and una
musing game of Ultimate, I shook myself
out of a sun-induced, post-tailgate lethargy
to go to the pee-spot. After making my way
past a couple of overzealous alums who
had pjissed out on the soiled ground, I
turned on the faucet in an attempt to fill
the aluminum trough. The guy next to me
asked a few questions.
"Hey, you a current student?"
"Yahoo, my last year."
"looking for a job?"
"Not really yet."
"What's your major?"
"Earth systems."
"Is that like symbolic systems? Oh good,

you're perfect."
The way he said it gave me a funny little
quiver in my diaphragm, but I didn't really
feel it until later. I also thought he looked
familiar.
"Follow me directly out this door and I
will tell you about some very privileged
opportunities for such, well, 'systems' ori
ented people. Chances to work within and
live and love the best System in the world."
He was Franco Harris, and he eventu
ally told me of all the wonders I could do
for the CIA as he tried to recruit me to
work as a Deep Agent. It was quite odd
because I knew the standard rumor that
the CIA recruited from Stanford symbol
ic systems majors, but never had any
proof. I had known several people who
wrote to the CIA for jobs but had been
rejected — albeit mostly 40-year-old For
est Service botanists.
We got in his Ijexus and drove to Penin
sula Creamery. Franco did {ill the talking. I
thought it was quite odd riding around in a
swank car with an athlete who had been a
star running back in the AFL / AFC in the
19705. He bought me a cold, sweet stack to
reward my willingness to follow a stranger.
We took our cones — both strawberry
— to the air when he revealed, "Just as I
was recruited by Deep Throat, now I shall
recruit you."
"The Big Watergate Guy, you know. I
came to his attention after my Immaculate
Reception. And the agility with which you
hopped over those class of '65s and their

discharge was so stellar, it caught my
attention."
He talked on as we got back in the air,
saying how those guys in Central America
got a bad rap, but he thought I wouldn't.
"Just have a few hobbies and characteris
tics that give off the quirky air of genuine
ness. Play 'footbag' — badly. Follow the
Trailblazers. Have a weakness for alcohol.
Criticize Martin Amis. And clip your toe
nails in public."
"But should I be inconspicuous?" I
asked.
"Covert characters are conspicuous."
I was amazed, but not too stunned to
stop me from throwing my cone out the
window onto Alpine Drive. "I'll litter —■
that'll be my trait."
The sleep I had that night was quite
sound.
I woke up early Sunday afternoon.
Franco called around 4 p.m. to rescind his
offer, claiming he was mistaken by my
major. I couldn't tell him I knew any male
symbolic systems majors — just one
female. He apologized and promised to
pass my name on to a recruiter for the
Rainforest Action Network. "Your major
may be better suited to fill spots in that
organization."

Karl entertains all sorts of mysterious fan
tasies. He looks forward to talking to Oliv
er Stone about his theories soon.

opportunities for such, well, 'systems' ori
ented people. Chances to work within and
live and love the best System in the world."
He was Franco Harris, and he eventu
ally told me of all the wonders I could do
for the CIA as he tried to recruit me to
work as a Deep Agent. It was quite odd
because I knew the standard rumor that
the CIA recruited from Stanford symbol
ic systems majors, but never had any
proof. I had known several people who
wrote to the CIA for jobs but had been
rejected — albeit mostly 40-year-old For
est Service botanists.
We got in his Ijexus and drove to Penin
sula Creamery. Franco did {ill the talking. I
thought it was quite odd riding around in a
swank car with an athlete who had been a
star running back in the AFL / AFC in the
19705. He bought me a cold, sweet stack to
reward my willingness to follow a stranger.
We took our cones — both strawberry
— to the air when he revealed, "Just as I
was recruited by Deep Throat, now I shall
recruit you."
"The Big Watergate Guy, you know. I
came to his attention after my Immaculate
Reception. And the agility with which you
hopped over those class of '65s and their

discharge was so stellar, it caught my
attention."
He talked on as we got back in the air,
saying how those guys in Central America
got a bad rap, but he thought I wouldn't.
"Just have a few hobbies and characteris
tics that give off the quirky air of genuine
ness. Play 'footbag' — badly. Follow the
Trailblazers. Have a weakness for alcohol.
Criticize Martin Amis. And clip your toe
nails in public."
"But should I be inconspicuous?" I
asked.
"Covert characters are conspicuous."
I was amazed, but not too stunned to
stop me from throwing my cone out the
window onto Alpine Drive. "I'll litter —■
that'll be my trait."
The sleep I had that night was quite
sound.
I woke up early Sunday afternoon.
Franco called around 4 p.m. to rescind his
offer, claiming he was mistaken by my
major. I couldn't tell him I knew any male
symbolic systems majors — just one
female. He apologized and promised to
pass my name on to a recruiter for the
Rainforest Action Network. "Your major
may be better suited to fill spots in that
organization."

Karl entertains all sorts of mysterious fan
tasies. He looks forward to talking to Oliv
er Stone about his theories soon.
