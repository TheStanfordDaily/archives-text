Farrakhan leads by causing racial division

AS LOUIS FARRAKHAN ascend
ed the podium to speak before
the assembled multitude who
answered his call to attend the Million
Man March, he also ascended to the
forefront of black leadership in Ameri
ca.
It is my adamant belief that Ameri
ca, as a human institution, will suffer
greatly because of this ascension in
power and prestige on the part of the
(dis)honorable Farrakhan, for he is
nothing more than a cunning and cal
culating hate monger — quick to
exploit the failure of black leadership
to address the social, economic and
political concerns of the average black
man, woman and child over the course
of the last 30 years.
Furthermore, I fear that his valida
tion and recognition as "the spokes
man" for African-Americans will ulti
mately cause great and lasting damage
to the state of race relations in Ameri

ca for years to come.
While many well-intentioned
marchers and participants in this
movement have tried to distance them
selves from the divisive rhetoric of
Farrakhan, the fact remains that he
first made the call for one million
black men to descend upon our
nation's capital in a showing of racial
solidarity. Their participation, at best,
can only be construed to indicate
latent approval and support for Far
rakhan.
Try as one may, one cannot sepa
rate the message from the messenger.
Such support panders to the basic ele
ment of the human spirit, the element
that is racist and bent upon asserting
a notion of racial supremacy rather
than human equality.
The Nation of Islam, as outlined by
its founders, Wallace D. Fard and Eli
jah Muhammad, is a perversion of
Orthodox Muslim faith that preaches a

doctrine of black divinity and white
damnation. White people are seen as a
devil race, the evil result of an experi
ment by the mad scientist Yacub, and
the followers of the Nation of Islam
believe that God will ultimately eradi
cate the white man from the earth,
leaving it for the black man to inherit.
These are the doctrines that Far
rakhan embraces. Anything that he
states counter to these beliefs is in dia
metric opposition to the religion which
he claims to represent. Farrakhan can
not advocate equality, for the basis of
his religious and moral foundation
centers around a conception of racial
supremacy. This is the man behind the
relatively civil face that was presented
to a global audience on Oct. 16. This is
the man that now stands at the helm
of black America.
While the Nation of Islam also
preaches the doctrines of self-empow
erment and self-reliance, the question

begs to be asked — at what cost? Will
blacks truly become emancipated if
they succumb, under his leadership, to
the racist tenets of Farrakhan? The
answer is obviously not. America is a
nation that has prevailed because of its
racial diversity and its condition of rel
ative equality. We, as a nation, should
be working to narrow, not widen the
chasm between the theory and the
reality of the American democratic
dream, especially as we near the 21st
century.
I would like to issue a call for all
people who are concerned for the social
welfare of America, to heighten their
involvement in keeping alive the grand
and vibrant social mantle of Frederick
Douglas, W.E.B. Dußois, Malcolm X
and Martin Luther King, Jr. The
future of our nation shall ultimately
depend upon it.
