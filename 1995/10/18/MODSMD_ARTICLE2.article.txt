# Cultural Excursions
## New program attempts to bridge ethnic and racial divisions 
### Paul Bodnar 
Amidst the raging debate over muiticulturalLsm
both at Stanford and nationwide, Tommy Lee Woon,
Stanford's multicultural educator, has established
"Cross Cultural Excursions," a program for freshmen
that attempts to teach racial and ethnic harmony.
In a community facing the issues raised by affirma
tive action, the"Million Man March" and the O.J.
Simpson trial, Woon's vision is not simply one of inter
cultural peace. Instead, his program was founded to

encourage the creation of bonds between people from
the diverse group of cultures on campus.
According to Woon, the goal is to eliminate fear of
"foreign" communities on campus through the estab
lishment of personal connections between people of
different backgrounds. "(Excursions) creates a sup
port network for new students, giving them a chance to
explore diversity with friends," he said.
Following an informal pilot program last year in


Woon
which 18 students tested the
premise for such a program, this
year's program currently involves
20 freshmen.
According to Woon, the ethni
cally diverse group is made up of
students from many different
dorms. Because he hopes to have
at least one representative from
each house containing freshmen,
Woon has extended the enroll
ment period.
Each quarter, the group's activi
ties are centered on a theme.
This quarter, the members of
the program will work on getting to
know one another as well as the
vision of the program. By creating
".lilies," in Woon's words, in other
cultural communities, students will
feel more comfortable to explore the
multiculturalism of Stanford.
During winter quarter, the
group will travel to several regional

cultural centers, including on-cam
pus theme houses and Glide Memo
rial Church in San Francisco, a
multi-ethnic church where stu
dents will feed the homeless.
In the spring, the program will
focus on creating projects on multi
culturalism to be presented in
dorms and houses.
Woon was motivated to create
the program because he said he
believes there is a kick of support
for individuals who are exploring
Stanford's rich variety of ethnic
resources. The current tendency to
subdivide society into racial and
ethnic groups draws societal bound
aries that people are reluctant to
cross, he said.
"We need support if we're going
to get all the benefits of a multicul
tural community," Woon said. "We
need to know that someone is
standing by us while we explore
these differences and commonal
ties."
The program's goal is to curb
our tendencies to hide in our safe,
homogenous cultural shells, Woon

explained. "We retreat into the
place where we are most comfort
able and we stay there; Excursions
tries to break this dynamic. Our
aim is to stop stratification based on
comfortability."
Woon believes that Cross Cul
tural Excursions is unique because
it does not encourage students to
simply throw themselves into new
and diverse communities.
The program recognizes that
such a jump can lead to a feeling of
alienation in a strange group and
instead endeavors to establish per
sonal connections between mem
bers of different cultures, he
explained.
Following a retreat at Holbrook
Palmer Park earlier this month,
group members will be learning
about multicultural history in the
various ethnic theme houses. The
next meeting entitled "Crossing
Historical Boundaries" will take
place Oct. 30 in Casa Zapata. The
discussion will focus on the
murals in Zapata and is open to
the puhlic.
