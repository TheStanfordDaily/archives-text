### Paul Bodnar 
Amidst the raging debate over muiticulturalLsm
both at Stanford and nationwide, Tommy Lee Woon,
Stanford's multicultural educator, has established
"Cross Cultural Excursions," a program for freshmen
that attempts to teach racial and ethnic harmony.
In a community facing the issues raised by affirma
tive action, the"Million Man March" and the O.J.
Simpson trial, Woon's vision is not simply one of inter
cultural peace. Instead, his program was founded to

encourage the creation of bonds between people from
the diverse group of cultures on campus.
According to Woon, the goal is to eliminate fear of
"foreign" communities on campus through the estab
lishment of personal connections between people of
different backgrounds. "(Excursions) creates a sup
port network for new students, giving them a chance to
explore diversity with friends," he said.
