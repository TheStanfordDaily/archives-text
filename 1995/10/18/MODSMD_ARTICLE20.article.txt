# Johnson misguided on the topic of affirmative action
## 
### 
Alarming, astonishing, disturbing —
the attitude and beliefs of some very
intelligent and noble students are just
plain scary. Perhaps it's more of that
Stanford phenomenon — isolation from
the outside world and reality breeding
the naivete which formed Julie John
son's comments on affirmative action.
As president of the College Republi
cans, Johnson assumes the leadership
role of a reasonably bright group of stu
dents. So when this particular student
and others disseminate distortions and
flat out lies about an issue which most
voters are still trying to interpret logical
ly, I feel compelled to respond.
We can all applaud the genuine, if
misguided, efforts of Students Against
Racism. Both the founder, Brian Burke,
and Johnson are no doubt sickened by

discrimination on any level. But do these
"defenders of justice" really believe that
society has reached our common goal of
being "based on individual merits?"
The latest conservative trend of using
the Civil Rights Movement to defend
decisively anti-civil rights programs are
probably immoral. A product of that very
Civil Rights Movement works to ensure
that discrimination has no role in college
admissions or the workplace. The same
product doesn't draw attention away
from individual merits, but earnestly
attempts to focus attention on the merits
of those traditionally underrepresented.
And let's make one thing clear right
now: affirmative action is not solely a
race issue.
Proponents of racially divisive legisla
tion, such as the California Civil Rights
Initiative, will try to spin it as such, but
ignorance will not change the fact that
affirmative action opens doors for racial
minorities, women, the handicapped and

veterans.
Opening doors, leveling the playing
field — what is all this rhetoric about?
What it isn't about is "screwing over"
white males. Minority women make half
of what comparably educated white
males earn, who incidentally hold 94 per
cent of middle and higher management
positions. Don't be fooled by those who
will tell you the socio-economic gap is
closing. Women may hold twice as many
management jobs today as they did 15
years ago, but simple math tells us that
twice of a little amounts to not much.
Affirmative action is not, as Johnson
insultingly puts it, about making under
represented status a qualification. This
was not and is not the purpose of the
Civil Rights Movement. The purpose was
to return solid American values to the
American people — equality and oppor
tunity for all.
I myself do not like to make accusa
tions without backing them up. Did

Johnson attempt to cloud the issue of
affirmative action practices? Apparently
so. She seems to believe that "quotas
and lower standards won't solve the
problem." Supporters of affirmative
action agree. Quotas were made illegal in
the late-'7os by the Supreme Court deci
sion of Bakke v. UC Regents. And who
said anything about lower standards?
Minorities simply want to be able to
compete under the same standards, to
have equal access.
We need to educate ourselves on the
issues. Too often, the children of this
nation, the prosperity of our economy
and even American democracy are at
stake. For those who have recently quali
fied to vote, I urge you to make your
voice heard, regardless of where you may
stand on the issue of affirmative action.
There will inevitably be support for
anti-affirmative action proposals such as
CCRI, and I admit I am also
opposed to affirmative action. It
pains me to have to recognize the
need for such programs. But if we
don't remind the deans of admis
sions and the job recruiters that
everyone deserves a fair shot,
who will? The coming months
will be filled with debate, at times
intellectual, but most likely emo
tional. The most we can do is to
make an informed decision by
exercising our right to vote. The
greatest tragedy out of all of this
would be allowing someone else
to decide for you.
