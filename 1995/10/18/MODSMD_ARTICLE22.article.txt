## Arguing for apathy — all in favor say "feh!" 
### 
I'M VERY PARTICULAR about how 1
like my indifference. I figure it's okay to
be blase about things, so long as you do
it in style.
No, we're not talking about depression
or breakdowns or self-absorbed lethargy
here — just a little flamboyant lack of
interest is all I'm asking.
That's right, to properly make your non
point, you must be invested in your avoid
ance of action. You must speak your mind
about your mindlessness.
Don't simply don't care when asked to;
don't just sit on your pooper and say noth
ing. Go ahead and make it a point to point
out how pointless everyone's points are.
Yes, I am arguing for a better apathy. I
— a columnist who gets paid to make up,
polish and present my opinions — am argu
ing against any lackadaisical disengage
ment and calling for a self-respecting, self
aware and highly vocal disdain for involve
ment.
And if you hear anyone accuse me of
hypocrisy, well tell them that I just don't
give a fart. Besides there's nothing wrong
with self-contradiction. It's an acceptable

lifestyle choice just like being gay or being
religious or being short.
We'll accept no more of this passive tor
pidity that people here like to pass off as the
genuine article of apathy. No, you have to
put effort into not caring. You have to whol
ly and fervently internalize the belief that
nothing affects anything. An apathy of
antipathy, that's what we need.
For example:
It's a rainy day and you're already tee
tering along a moody, dysthymic edge. A
rally is going on in Kresge and it's big
enough that your RA has posted a flier
alxwe the first floor urinal. You think
maybe you should go, but, somehow, your
bi'd seems a bi-tter offer.
What to do? That's right — don't go.
But don't go back to bed either.
Rather, go and tell your RA or whoever's
in charge just how stupid you think it all is
and how resentful you are that your urine
flow was even exposed to such nonsense.
That's right: "Just say feh."
And say it out loud.
Bust out of that misguided Coupland's
Gen-X presupposition of no-initiative and

show the expectant THEY just how much
you do care about not caring, because it's
okay not to have an opinion, so long as you
make that fact well known.
"Uvas, huh?"
You see, in the supermarket of solip
sism, there are two brands of apathy from
which one can choose: 1) don't know, and 2)
don 7 care. And to have the greatest impact,
we must embody the latter vehemently, for
ignorance is not the way to salvation and
time management, which is why I ask you
to join me in preaching the gospel of not
preaching.
"Go tell it on the mountain. Jesus Christ
is bored."
"Yeah, whatever," you say. "I already
don't give a hooter 'bout nothin'
But stop a moment — question that.
Is that so? Is that right? Can you really
say you care little about less when you've
had six meetings this week; when you're on
the phone lists of three clubs and read two
newspapers each day; when you camp out
for Alice Walker tickets and when you
check your e-mail newsgroups with blaring
regularity?

Such is the frustration of my crusade.
While it seems our campus earns its repu
tation for nonchalance towards "the
issues," this is not at all the case. Rather,
the problem at today's Stanford is that peo
ple are too involved.
Here is where the paradox lies. For with
all this interest and initiative and involve
ment, everyone here relentlessly claims
there is no constituency, only people who
think they're leaders. Everyone is so busy
putting up fliers for their own concert or
performance or project or protest that no
one is left to sit back and let all these best
laid plans happen to them.
In fact, it seems the only people left who
actually have the time to be affected by the
labors of others are frosh — who are just
getting started mid whose opinions count
so little anyway — and the socially malad
justed, grade-grubbing, classes-only, pass
ing-out-resumes-at-Career-Faire
technoschmucks whose best friend is their
PowerPC and who'll be the perfect, if not
only, RA applicants once lies Ed starts
enforcing the alcohol policy (inside of five
years is my guess).

So give it a try. Kick back and join the
phlegmatic ranks of the constituency. Get
uninvolved. Bail that meeting. Find some
one you like and who likes you and have sex
with them instead.
You might even like it.
And if you find you can't pull yourself
out, that the driver in you won't take that
much needed nap, don't despair. Try taper
ing yourself down instead. That's what I've
been doing, and now I'm down to only one
project per week. (This week, I've dedicated
myself to telling everyone to get their
schoolbooks individually gift-wrapped
when they buy them at the Bookstore —
they do it for free, with a little ribbon and
everything!)
So if you believe that — no matter what,
no matter where — things will always get
done and that if not, you care not, then say
so.
Otherwise I'll expect to see you in
motion, making some kind of a dif—
... Sorry, I just didn't care enough to
finish that sentence.
