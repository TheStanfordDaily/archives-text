# 'Buddy' program faces financial troubles
## Mentoring program for Oakland elementary students is in jeopardy 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
At the start of its fifth year of operation, the
Jefferson-Stanford Buddies Project, run by the
Stanford Volunteer Network, is struggling to
maintain its existence after Jefferson Year-
Round Elementary School in Oakland said it
would no longer fund the bus trips that are inte
gral to the program.
The goaJ of the JefTerson-Stanford Buddies
Project is "to make the college experience look
like a reachable goal," and at the same time fos
ter mutually beneficial relationships between
Stanford and Jefferson students, said senior
Makambo Tshionyi, co-director of the program.
According to Tshionyi, he and co-director
John Stassen, a senior, were informed during
the first week of fall quarter that Jefferson was
not planning to provide funding for the three
trips its students usually make to visit their
buddies on the Stanford campus.
"Subsequently, we've just been trying to
work around [the lack of funding] and see how
salvageable [the program] is for this quarter,
and also for subsequent quarters," Tshionyi
said.
Tshionyi underscored the fact that it will be
challenging for him and Stassen, both new to

directing the program, "to try and save it."
The project, which was expanded last year to
include both third and fourth graders, tradition
ally has Stanford students send letters every few
weeks to their Jefferson "buddies" and hast
them for a day at Stanford once a quarter. In
addition, participating Stanford students have
had the opportunity to visit Jefferson Elemen
tary once a year.
"The kids are just overjoyed when a bundle of
letters comes from their Stanford buddies," said
David Plaut, a fourth-grade teacher at Jefferson
who participated in the program last year.
Plaut explained that in a budgetary review last
year, Jefferson Elementary decided not to contin
ue funding the bus trips for the project because
the expense had been too great to allow adequate
funding for other field trips during the year.
He estimated that the cost of one bus trip
from Oakland to Stanford, which accommo
dates a single class, is about $(>OO. On a typical
trip, five classes travel to Stanford.
"I would be happy to help and get the pro
gram organized," Plaut said, adding that last
year's coordinator of the project at Jefferson has
since left. He said many teachers do not want to
assume the extra responsibility because they are
in a contract dispute with the Oakland Unified
School District, which Plaut described as "an

under-resourced urban school district."
One possible solution, Plaut said, is to limit
the number of trips Jefferson students make to
Stanford, "if Stanford could drum up the
money." He emphasized that even if the pro
gram were to consist only of letter-writing, it
would be worthwhile.
Stassen said a message he left at -Jefferson
two weeks ago has not been answered. Accord
ing to Tshionyi, a solution must be found with
in the next week in order to operate the program
this quarter "in its historical fashion."
Although Stassen and Tshionyi have consid
ered the possibility of obtaining funds from
dorms, they do not want to pursue that option
until they have communicated with Jefferson.
Another solution is to change the structure of
the program, whether by reducing the number
of trips or eliminating them altog ther.
"We're kind of looking tor an achievable solu
tion that will keep the integrity" of the program,
Tshionyi said, although he stressed that "kids
are much more impressed by a tangible experi
ence," such as visiting the Stanford campus,
which represents "a stark difference from where
they come from."
"We're fairly confident that the program will
be carried out this quarter in some format," he
said.
