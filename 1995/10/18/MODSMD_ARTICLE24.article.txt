## Circle of friends Coping with cancer 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
If you stood outside the room and listened,
you would think you were hearing a group of
doctors deep in conversation.
"Did they do a fine needle aspiration on the
growth?"
"I did tomoxiphan concurrently with radia
tion."
"I'm thinking of trying shark cartilage, does
anyone have information on it?"
But the women inside the room are breast
cancer patients comparing treatments and expe
riences at a Thursday night open house at the
Community Breast Health Project.
"It was awful to watch people coming into my
office struggling with the disease and having no
way of communicating with women who had
already been through the process of dealing with
breast cancer," said Ellen Mahoney, a Stanford
surgeon who started the project two years ago
with Jill Friedenreich, a cancer patient.
Before the project, each newly diagnosed
breast cancer patient was faced with doing a
daunting amount of research to determine wbat
treatment to pursue, how to deal with bills and
insurance and where to find emotional support
for themselves and their families. "It was kind
of like reinventing the wheel," Mahoney said.
"The person is already under so much stress,
they shouldn't have to do all that work by them
selves," she said. "That was our major idea
when starting [the project]. It lets women pass
on wisdom gathered the hard way to the next
generation of breast cancer patients."
The project is a grass-roots, patient-run orga
nization that provides information and referrals
for breast cancer patients. Its resources include
a World Wide Web page, a library and the
Thursday night sessions which provide access to
a doctor, a therapist, a decisions analyst and, of
course, other patients, who are often the most
valuable resource.
"It's all still under construction," said
Lauren Langford, the project's information
specialist. Langford works on the Web page

and the library, and
is an expert at gath
ering information
the patients request.
"Often what patients
need most is to talk
to each other to fig
ure out what they
need to do." she said.
"It helps to fight
that helpless, hope
less feeling that you
get."
Mahoney agreed.
"It's important to
remember that the
medical aspect of can
cer is just one compo
nent." She glances at
the motto of the pro
ject: "Cancer is treat
ed as if it occurs in
test tubes and on lab

slides. In cells and tissues, bones and bodies.
In fact cancer occurs in people."
In the circle, the patients listen to each
other and ask questions, talking about every
thing from alternative treatments such as
shark cartilage and herbal medicine to the
best place to buy organic broccoli. After the
initial hour when the group sits together, the
doctor, therapist and decision analyst are
available to talk in small groups or one-to-one.
The rest of the group breaks up into smaller
groups and talks, argues and laughs.
The women come for different reasons â€”
one new woman had recently received the
news that the growth in her breast was malig
nant and that she would need to begin treat
ment soon. "I need to find out what to do," she
said, holding the results of the biopsy in her
hand.
Another woman who had been to meetings
before was going to receive a bone marrow
transplant in the next few days and dropped in
with her mother to talk about it. They are all
willing to share their stories and offer help.

"I knew about this place because a woman
at the health club 1 go to had cancer and left
out some pamphlets. I took one because I fig
ured a friend might need it one day," said
Linda Johnson, a breast cancer patient. "Kind
of ironic, I guess."
"I came in I to the projectl trying to decide
between a mastectomy and a lumpectomy, and
I wanted to research the recurrence rate for a
cancer type like mine to figure out which
treatment would be better," she said. Lang
ford and Johnson sat down, and within a half
hour had found 131 articles and abstracts on
the subject. Johnson narrowed that pool down
to about 30 articles. The next day she took
four of the articles with her to her doctor's
office and discussed them. She decided to have
the lumpectomy, a less radical surgery which
removes only the tumor rather than the whole
breast.
"There are so many decisions to be made. It's
great to have a center of information like this.


The Community Breast Health Project's Web page offers advice and
support for those suffering from breast cancer.
There is also so much progress
being made, and this place keeps
track of it all, and the patients
spread it out to each other," she
says.
In the background, a debate
about a fairly new cancer drug
called taxol is in full swing. Taxol
is not highly available at this
point, but one woman in the room
had been treated with it. Nausea
and fatigue caused her to stop
treatment altogether. "I eat ail
good things and I want to try
shark cartilage," she says. Some
women support this idea while
others are skeptical.
As the meeting winds down,

one group of women is still chat
ting. One woman was misdiag
nosed as non-malignant while she
was pregnant. The day after the
birth, a biopsy showed that she
had a large malignant tumor in
her breast.
Since the diagnosis was late,
she was forced to have a mastec
tomy and have 13 out of 20 lymph
nodes removed because the can
cer had spread. She was about to
undergo a bone marrow trans
plant in a final effort to remove
the last of the cancer.
She had lost her hair during
treatment, but she wore a bright
ly colored hat and was always
smiling and encouraging people
to talk. As she got up to leave she
turned to the group and grinned.
"The next time you see me, I'll be
doing a lot better." she said.
