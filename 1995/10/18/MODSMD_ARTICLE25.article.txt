• decent foot stools, but
other than that, I really can't
think of anything else. Oh,
unless you have $43,502.49, in
which case you can get it to
make 30 copies of your butt —
like Beavis and Butthead did
on that one show — and still
have enough money to buy
some Silly Putty and a Mer

cedes E320. Trust me, the Silly
Putty is irresistible. People
will cling to you like socks
fresh out of the dryer.
It just so happens that those
clinging socks work on some of
the same principles that photo
copiers do. As it turns out,
static electricity can actually
be useful. Static electricity is
not just some excuse for
physics teachers to try to elec
trocute their students, but a
force that can be used for the
collective good of humanity. Of
course, it also allows your pro
fessors to make copies of unan
nounced homework sets at
whim. It just goes to show you
what can happen when power
falls into the wrong hands.
In order to see how photo
copiers work, first we need to
know what static electricity is
and why it's different from the
electricity which comes out of
the wall and powers your
stereo. Don't worry, the differ
ence is a lot easier to figure out
than the one between "far
ther" and "further."
The electricity that comes
out of your wall involves mov
ing charged particles. In this
case, these particles are elec
trons, which carry a negative
charge. These electrons can
move around easily in certain
substances, typically metals,
which we call conductors.

Other substances, like plastic,
through which electrons can't
move as easily, are called insu
lators.
When a charge is created on
an insulator, it can't move as
well as it could if it were in a
conductor, so the charge stays
stuck in one place. We call this
static electricity. Picture it this
way — if electrons were people,
then conductors would be like
ice skating rinks. On the other
hand, insulators would also be
like ice skating rinks, only cov
ered in knee-deep tar.
Photocopiers work because
there are some substances
which are insulators in the
dark but turn into conductors
when exposed to light. In most
copiers, this substance is sele
nium, which is coated onto an
aluminum drum. Before the
copying starts, the surface of
the roller is given a positive
charge.
Since the selenium is an
insulator in the dark, the roller
remains uniformly positively
charged. What a copier does
then is to focus light reflected
off of the image you want copied
onto the roller. That's why
copiers use that really bright,
annoying light which your mom
always told you not to stare at
because it would blind you —
but you did anyway.
The places where the

reflected light shines on the
selenium become conductive
and the positive charge flows
to the aluminum underneath.
The dark areas remain unaf
fected and continue to hold
their positive charge. Negative
ly charged toner particles are
then sprayed onto the drum
and stick only to the places on
the plate which still have the
positive charge. The drum
revolves and brings the toner
close to a sheet of paper lying
over a positively charged plate.
The positive charge on the
plate pulls the negative toner
particles onto the paper where
they are fused there with heat.
That's why fresh copies are
warm — much like socks out of
the dryer, just not quite as
comfortable.
The same principles which
allow copiers to work are also
at work inside laser printers.
The only difference is in the
source of light. In the copier,
the light is reflected off of the
original and on to the drum to
create an image. In a laser
printer, laser light is focused
on the drum and produces the
image directly on its surface.
Then, the same processes of
adding toner and fusing it to
the paper produces your
thoughtfully crafted, well
phrased masterpiece of literary
exposition.

The electricity that comes
out of your wall involves mov
ing charged particles. In this
case, these particles are elec
trons, which carry a negative
charge. These electrons can
move around easily in certain
substances, typically metals,
which we call conductors.

Other substances, like plastic,
through which electrons can't
move as easily, are called insu
lators.
When a charge is created on
an insulator, it can't move as
well as it could if it were in a
conductor, so the charge stays
stuck in one place. We call this
static electricity. Picture it this
way — if electrons were people,
then conductors would be like
ice skating rinks. On the other
hand, insulators would also be
like ice skating rinks, only cov
ered in knee-deep tar.
Photocopiers work because
there are some substances
which are insulators in the
dark but turn into conductors
when exposed to light. In most
copiers, this substance is sele
nium, which is coated onto an
aluminum drum. Before the
copying starts, the surface of
the roller is given a positive
charge.
Since the selenium is an
insulator in the dark, the roller
remains uniformly positively
charged. What a copier does
then is to focus light reflected
off of the image you want copied
onto the roller. That's why
copiers use that really bright,
annoying light which your mom
always told you not to stare at
because it would blind you —
but you did anyway.
The places where the

reflected light shines on the
selenium become conductive
and the positive charge flows
to the aluminum underneath.
The dark areas remain unaf
fected and continue to hold
their positive charge. Negative
ly charged toner particles are
then sprayed onto the drum
and stick only to the places on
the plate which still have the
positive charge. The drum
revolves and brings the toner
close to a sheet of paper lying
over a positively charged plate.
The positive charge on the
plate pulls the negative toner
particles onto the paper where
they are fused there with heat.
That's why fresh copies are
warm — much like socks out of
the dryer, just not quite as
comfortable.
The same principles which
allow copiers to work are also
at work inside laser printers.
The only difference is in the
source of light. In the copier,
the light is reflected off of the
original and on to the drum to
create an image. In a laser
printer, laser light is focused
on the drum and produces the
image directly on its surface.
Then, the same processes of
adding toner and fusing it to
the paper produces your
thoughtfully crafted, well
phrased masterpiece of literary
exposition.
