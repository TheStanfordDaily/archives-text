# Talking ethics...
## Bioethics forum 
### Esther Wong Contributing writer 
Despite the popular belief that
medical research will never catch
up with our nation's ever-increas
ing clinical demands, some areas
of study — especially in the field
of genetics — have taken off at an
overwhelming rate, leaving a host
of unanswered ethical, legal and
social questions in their wake.
Last Tuesday in a public policy
symposium jointly sponsored by
Affvmetrix and Stanford's Beck
man Center for Molecular and
Genetic Medicine, a panel of
national experts from industry
and academia gathered to address
these issues, including questions
such as when genetic testing
should occur and who should have
access to genetic information.
The symposium, entitled
"Genetic Testing: Expectations,
Implications, and Options," was
divided into two sessions, both
free and open to the public. The
first session, an afternoon collo
quium consisting of speeches on
disease diagnosis and implica
tions, took place in Fairchild
Auditorium. The evening session,
held in Annenberg Auditorium,
featured a panel discussion by a
group of 11 national experts who
addressed various ethical dilem
mas surrounding genetic testing
and later fielded questions from
the audience.
Among the panelists were Law
School Prof. Henry Greely, and
Medical School Prof. David Cox,
as well as two members of the
Center for Biomedical Ethics —
Barbara Koenig and Ernie Young.
The panel also featured experts
representing research institu
tions and companies across the
nation. Paul Berg, Nobel laureate
and current director of the Beck
man Center, organized the event.
Donald Kennedy, Bing Profes
sor of Environmental Science and
president emeritus of Stanford,
served as the moderator for the
evening panel discussion, which
was attended by approximately
250 people.
Molecular biology "is a field
that is advancing at breakneck
speed," said Kennedy, member of
the National Academy of Sciences
and former head of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration under
President Carter. "Yet our under
standing of the human genome is
very much in its infancy," he con
tinued. "Things that seem certain
today won't be so certain in the
future."
To facilitate the panel discus
sion, Kennedy introduced three
medical case scenarios, each fol
lowed by a panel discussion on
various ethical, legal and social
issues surrounding the hypotheti
cal situations.
The first scenario Kennedy
introduced dealt with the discov
ery of a new genetic test for
Alzheimer's disease, a late-life
onset mental disorder. Panelists
addressed questions about who
should own the results of such
genetic tests, as well as complexi
ties that could arise if the test
were used to diagnose unborn
fetuses — in particular, whether
parents should have the right to
abort a child who is predicted to
suffer Alzheimer's later in life.
"If the technology is out there,
to simply make the decision that
parents should not be allowed to
use it is paternalistic," said Pedi
atrics Prof. Neil Holtzman of
Johns Hopkins University.

Young stressed the importance
of accuracy in genetic screenings
such as the Alzheimer's test
introduced by Kennedy. "One
must weigh 60 years of produc
tive and fairly happy life against
no life at all," said Young.
"Genetic tests are turning
every pregnant woman into a
moral philosopher," said Koenig.
Columbia University Neuropsy-

chology Prof.
Nancy Wexler
suggested that
having such
genetic fore
knowledge is
"like being in a
preview of a
movie, but once
you're in the
preview, you're
in the movie."

The issues were further intensi
fied when the panelists were asked
whether older children should be
informed of a prenatal diagnosis
indicating they would suffer a par
ticular disease later in life.
The second case scenario
addressed by the panelists dealt
with a young couple having diffi
culties conceiving a child. Both
parents are carriers of the gene
that causes "Kennedy's Disease,"
a hypothetical mental disorder.
Genetics and Pediatrics Prof.
David Cox commented that
genetic testing could potentially
be devised to test each fertilized
egg for a clearly identifiable
"Kennedy" mutation.
This possibility stimulated dis
cussion on the ethical implications
of having access to the results of
such a test. "What about these
embryos?" Kennedy asked. "Can
you just cherry pick? The ones you
like, you use, and the ones you
don't like, you throw away?"
Kennedy then modified the sce
nario and asked the panelists
whether their views would change
if the gene did not predict disease
potential, but instead provided
information on other variables —
such as sexual orientation or gen
der.
This stimulated a discussion of
the increasingly fine line that dis
tinguishes disease from healthy
genetic differences between indi
viduals. "What constitutes a dis
ease?" asked Young. "What is a
disorder? What is a malady? We
are genetic variants in one way or
another. Most of the variation in
the human genome is coding for
things that distinguish us from
one another."
The final scenario put before
the panel was not a case sce
nario, but a real one. Panelist
Dave Frohnmayer, president of
the University of Oregon,
recently suffered the loss of his
daughter, Kate, who died at age
12 of Fanconi anemia, an
immune disease that can only be
treated by performing a bone
marrow transplant. His other
daughter, Kirsten, who graduat
ed from Stanford in 1995, was
diagnosed with the disease as
well.
Since siblings are the most
likely candidates for a bone mar
row match, parents sometimes
opt to have more children in
hopes of finding this match. How
ever, they also risk having addi
tional children who suffer the dis
ease.
After wrestling with a situa
tion so close to home, the panel
fielded a number of questions
from members of the audience to
conclude the evening.

The first scenario Kennedy
introduced dealt with the discov
ery of a new genetic test for
Alzheimer's disease, a late-life
onset mental disorder. Panelists
addressed questions about who
should own the results of such
genetic tests, as well as complexi
ties that could arise if the test
were used to diagnose unborn
fetuses — in particular, whether
parents should have the right to
abort a child who is predicted to
suffer Alzheimer's later in life.
"If the technology is out there,
to simply make the decision that
parents should not be allowed to
use it is paternalistic," said Pedi
atrics Prof. Neil Holtzman of
Johns Hopkins University.

Young stressed the importance
of accuracy in genetic screenings
such as the Alzheimer's test
introduced by Kennedy. "One
must weigh 60 years of produc
tive and fairly happy life against
no life at all," said Young.
"Genetic tests are turning
every pregnant woman into a
moral philosopher," said Koenig.
Columbia University Neuropsy-

chology Prof.
Nancy Wexler
suggested that
having such
genetic fore
knowledge is
"like being in a
preview of a
movie, but once
you're in the
preview, you're
in the movie."

The issues were further intensi
fied when the panelists were asked
whether older children should be
informed of a prenatal diagnosis
indicating they would suffer a par
ticular disease later in life.
The second case scenario
addressed by the panelists dealt
with a young couple having diffi
culties conceiving a child. Both
parents are carriers of the gene
that causes "Kennedy's Disease,"
a hypothetical mental disorder.
Genetics and Pediatrics Prof.
David Cox commented that
genetic testing could potentially
be devised to test each fertilized
egg for a clearly identifiable
"Kennedy" mutation.
This possibility stimulated dis
cussion on the ethical implications
of having access to the results of
such a test. "What about these
embryos?" Kennedy asked. "Can
you just cherry pick? The ones you
like, you use, and the ones you
don't like, you throw away?"
Kennedy then modified the sce
nario and asked the panelists
whether their views would change
if the gene did not predict disease
potential, but instead provided
information on other variables —
such as sexual orientation or gen
der.
This stimulated a discussion of
the increasingly fine line that dis
tinguishes disease from healthy
genetic differences between indi
viduals. "What constitutes a dis
ease?" asked Young. "What is a
disorder? What is a malady? We
are genetic variants in one way or
another. Most of the variation in
the human genome is coding for
things that distinguish us from
one another."
The final scenario put before
the panel was not a case sce
nario, but a real one. Panelist
Dave Frohnmayer, president of
the University of Oregon,
recently suffered the loss of his
daughter, Kate, who died at age
12 of Fanconi anemia, an
immune disease that can only be
treated by performing a bone
marrow transplant. His other
daughter, Kirsten, who graduat
ed from Stanford in 1995, was
diagnosed with the disease as
well.
Since siblings are the most
likely candidates for a bone mar
row match, parents sometimes
opt to have more children in
hopes of finding this match. How
ever, they also risk having addi
tional children who suffer the dis
ease.
After wrestling with a situa
tion so close to home, the panel
fielded a number of questions
from members of the audience to
conclude the evening.

Despite the popular belief that
medical research will never catch
up with our nation's ever-increas
ing clinical demands, some areas
of study — especially in the field
of genetics — have taken off at an
overwhelming rate, leaving a host
of unanswered ethical, legal and
social questions in their wake.
Last Tuesday in a public policy
symposium jointly sponsored by
Affvmetrix and Stanford's Beck
man Center for Molecular and
Genetic Medicine, a panel of
national experts from industry
and academia gathered to address
these issues, including questions
such as when genetic testing
should occur and who should have
access to genetic information.
The symposium, entitled
"Genetic Testing: Expectations,
Implications, and Options," was
divided into two sessions, both
free and open to the public. The
first session, an afternoon collo
quium consisting of speeches on
disease diagnosis and implica
tions, took place in Fairchild
Auditorium. The evening session,
held in Annenberg Auditorium,
featured a panel discussion by a
group of 11 national experts who
addressed various ethical dilem
mas surrounding genetic testing
and later fielded questions from
the audience.
Among the panelists were Law
School Prof. Henry Greely, and
Medical School Prof. David Cox,
as well as two members of the
Center for Biomedical Ethics —
Barbara Koenig and Ernie Young.
The panel also featured experts
representing research institu
tions and companies across the
nation. Paul Berg, Nobel laureate
and current director of the Beck
man Center, organized the event.
Donald Kennedy, Bing Profes
sor of Environmental Science and
president emeritus of Stanford,
served as the moderator for the
evening panel discussion, which
was attended by approximately
250 people.
Molecular biology "is a field
that is advancing at breakneck
speed," said Kennedy, member of
the National Academy of Sciences
and former head of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration under
President Carter. "Yet our under
standing of the human genome is
very much in its infancy," he con
tinued. "Things that seem certain
today won't be so certain in the
future."
To facilitate the panel discus
sion, Kennedy introduced three
medical case scenarios, each fol
lowed by a panel discussion on
various ethical, legal and social
issues surrounding the hypotheti
cal situations.
The first scenario Kennedy
introduced dealt with the discov
ery of a new genetic test for
Alzheimer's disease, a late-life
