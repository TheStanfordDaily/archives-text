# Matchmaker, make me a match: possible treatment discovered
## Scientists use molecule to switch genes on and off 
### Nancy Farghalli Contributing writer 
The episodic journey of scientific dis
coveries has come to an important
impasse. Researchers at the Stanford
Medical Center will soon be able to switch
genes on and off.
A team of Stanford scientists — led by
postdoctoral fellows David Spencer and
Leslie Holsinger — have developed a
technique which will allow scientists to
understand protein interactions. The
researchers published their results in this
month's issue of Proceedings of the
National Academy of Science.
Shining light on the "matchmaker
technique," the paper describes experi
ments done on genetically engineered
mammalian cells. The experiments, three
years in the running, focused on activat
ing the ras protein, inherent in fighting
off infection.
Spencer and Holsinger's technique
activates proteins, which under natural
conditions become activated by receiving
a signal for gene expression from the cell
surface. This activation allows scientists
to study isolated protein interactions in

seemingly complex signal cascades, which
"is a useful approach for basic science to
study all kinds of events in cell signaling
and cell activation," said Holsinger.
The matchmaker integral to this tech
nique was created by Chemistry Asst.
Prof. Thomas Wandless. It serves to clar
ify the sometimes indistinguishable steps
in signal cascades. Cells use a variety of
mechanisms to instigate signaling cas
cades, such as cross-linking cells and
interactions with growth receptors. The
new technique gives researchers the free
dom to "step between events during pro
tein interaction. This allows you to take
events that happen in-between and con
trol each particular event," commented
Holsinger.
The matchmaker molecule is a two
pronged molecule that can facilitate a cas
cade of protein activity which turns a gene
switch on and off. Ideally, the matchmak
er molecule has the power to usurp the
control mechanisms of a cell. It can enable
researchers to modify proteins to cause
different types of interactions.
The matchmaker molecule enables
researchers to manipulate a series of inter
actions that culminate with the activation

of a protein. Essen
tially, it coordinates a
linkage between two
proteins, which then
launches the single
transduction path
way.
Both Spencer and
Holsinger app-lied the
matchmaker molecule
to the example of the
T cell pathway.
Using the match
maker molecule, they
focused on manipulat
ing different parts of T

cell signaling. The researchers examined the
ras protein which initiates T cells to ward oft
infections. The activation signal for the ras
protein involves a multitude of protein inter
actions that begins from a cell surface recep
tor. This cascade eventually diffuses into the
residence of the ras protein within the inner
membrane.
"We manipulated different pathways
of T cell signaling. We also demonstrated
that we could activate T cell receptors at
the surface which initiates a whole scries
of cascades. Our next goal is more

refined— to activate one subset of the sig
nal pathway that emanate from T cell
receptors," remarked Spencer.
For humans, the technique can serve
as a developmental tool for gene therapy.
Essentially, gene therapy treatments that
require some type of control mechanism
could benefit from this technique.
"In 10 years, the matchmaker
molecule, substituted as a drug or small
pill, will be the method of choice for
manipulating proteins," Spencer said.
The use of this technique for humans

is still a long way off. Spencer and
Holsinger applauded efforts by other
researchers to augment their own
research work in this field. "The aspect
of copycat versions of molecules that
might work better is feasible " Spencer
added."
In the coming years, the possibility of
turning production of a specific protein
on and off without hurting other pro
teins could become a footnote to a tech
nique that enhanced the face of medical
treatment.
