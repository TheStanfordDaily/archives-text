## Dean of students schedules time for comments, concerns 
### Sarah Cameron 
In an effort to provide a forum for student con
cerns, Dean of Students Marc Wais will begin hold
ing weekly office hours.
Beginning next week, Wais will be available in his
office in Old Union 323 from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.
each Monday.
The idea to hold office hours originated with the
suggestion of a student, but Wais believes that this
"open-door policy" will help bridge the gap between
students and administrators.
"My main objectives are to be accessible,
approachable and visible. I want to break down bar
riers between students and the administration and
to get to know students on a one-to-one level," said
Wais, who hopes that his office hours will enable
him to meet students on a personal level.
Wais said he encourages students to approach
him during this time with concerns of any nature,
whether it is a criticism or a compliment. New to

Stanford this year, Wais also hopes to use the for
mat to better understand the community.
"I'm hoping people will come just to get to know
me," he said.
Wais also noted the difficulty in finding a time
that does not conflict with students' already busy
schedules. "I'm not hoping to fill a complete
ombudsperson role, but I'm hoping to make myself
convenient and accessible to [students'l academic
schedules," he said.
Although the front entrance of Old Union closes
at 5 p.m., Wais said that he will prop open a wooden
door to the left of the main entrance to allow stu
dents to reach his office.
The new hours will continue through the first
quarter, and may be continued based upon the level
of student interest, Wais said.
Wais added that he hopes to ease students' fears
about coming to see him. "It is part of my responsi
bility to be accessible and available, and this [policy!
is another way to better serve students," he said.
