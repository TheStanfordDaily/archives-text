# Students unmoved by Prop. 187 battle
## Campus apathetic about legal challenge 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
With a federal judge preparing to decide
the constitutionality of Proposition 187,
confusion and a lack of interest are limiting
campus organizations' response, in stark
contrast to last year's widespread protest of
the measure.
While some opponents of the proposi
tion, which is designed to deny social ser
vices to illegal immigrants, remain active in
organizing a response, others have simply
lost faith in the value of protest.
"There has been some mobilization,"
said first-year law student Emma Luevano,
"but we're still trying to grasp what we
want to focus on."
Luevano is hoping to organize a group of

law students around national immigration
issues and to work in a coalition with Resis
tance Action Grassroots organizing Educa
tion (RAGE), a student group devoted to
"social justice" that grew out of last year's
anti-187 protest.
The uncertainty is understandable. In
stead of rallying around a ballot-box issue —
the proposition was approved last Novem
ber by a majority of California voters — or
ganizers this year would have to address a
complicated legal battle over enforcement.
The measure currently rests with U.S.
District Court Judge Mariana Pfaelzer, who
could name the proposal unconstitutional.
The state attorney general, apparently fear
ing that the judge may summarily make
such a ruling, has filed a brief
arguing that specific enforcement
measures in the legislation should
be considered separately.
Pfaelzer will hold hearings on
this motion Oct. 23, creating the
first federal-level showdown on
the issue
Political Science Assoc. Prof.
Luis Fraga interpreted the court
date as "setting the agenda" for a
debate that could go all the way to
the U S. Supreme Court.
Though the case still has sever
al steps to go before reaching the
high court, Fraga said the courts
in general are now "key players"
in the debate.
RAGE member Jessica Gomez,
a junior, agreed, saying, "if it ever
got a judge that was sympathetic
to the proposition, it would be a
moral setback."
Other student leaders take a
softer stance on the importance of
the issue. ASSU senator Andre
Vanier, a junior who last year
argued that the ASSU should
debate Proposition 187 as a philo
sophical issue, said he has learned
not to place too much faith in such
politically motivated action.
"The only role the [ASSUJ Sen

ate can play in this is increasing
awareness," he said, "but in gener
al, Sacramento and Washington,
D.C., don't pay much attention to
what goes on in the ASSU."
year, an ASSU resolution
encouraging students to vote
against the proposition was passed
by a 14-4 vote. Other forms of
protest included a march by Chi
cano students and a candlelight
vigil drawing students from vari
ous groups, which helped to focus
attention on the issue.
This year, even students such
as senior Aaron Ijehman, who par
ticipated in the candlelight vigil,
said they haven't been following
the issue.
The immigration debate has
shifted largely to a national level,
though it continues to make news
in California. Luevano pointed to
various enforcement measures
currently making their way
through Congress as cause for
concern.
The San Francisco Examiner
also recently reported on efforts
by Proposition 187 backer Ron
Prince to gather signatures for
"Save Our State 2," a state refer
endum which would recommend
the repeal of those parts of the
14th Amendment which grant cit
izenship to anyone born in the
country, and would make it impos
sible to hold dual citizenship.
