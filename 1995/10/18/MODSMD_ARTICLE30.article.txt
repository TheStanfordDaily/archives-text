## Painful ache of ties 
### 
Picture, if you will, the fol
lowing scenario: The
University of Wisconsin,
along with a tremendous fol
lowing of Badger faithful, have
journeyed across the country
for a Big Ten-Pac-10 clash
against the Stanford Cardinal.
The contest seesaws back and
forth for the entire game with
each team behaving respon
sively, answering offensive
score with offensive score. Car-

dinal senior quarterback Mark
Butterfield throws for over 300
yards, connecting on 20 of 23
attempts during one stretch of
the game. Meanwhile, running
back Carl MeCu Hough hoists
the Wisconsin offense on his
back and carries the Badgers
for over 200 yards.
Spectacular stunts, but all
for not. Knotted at 24, the Car
dinal offense finally stalls on
the last drive of the game
before reaching field goal range
and the game ends in a tie.
Reaction Ã¼biquitous disap
pointment throughout the Sta
dium. After Butterfield's last
ditch-Doug Flutie attempt falls
outside the wing span of senior
Mark Harris, the crowd stands
in silence. The clock had
stopped running, and both
squads look around before
slowly heading toward their
respective locker rooms.
I had just witnessed one of
the most exciting college foot
ball games in my spectator
career. A game which took me
to the highs of Mt. Fuji and the
lows of Death Valley dropped

me off back at sea level. Dare I
say blue balls?
The only thing to show for
the game was an awkward
third wheel hanging from each
teams' record. The Wisconsin
squad had traveled over 2,000
miles to compete in a game in
which the scoreboard would
reveal nothing more than it did
before the game started. Stan
ford and Wisconsin alumni and
fans traveled across the coun
try for bragging rights but left
empty-handed, forced to wait
until next year's game in Madi
son.
If serious injuries had
occurred during the game,
these teams would have actu
ally benefited from not playing
the game. Obviously, it is
always good to get action
against another squad, to see
how your offense responds to
live pressure and how your
defense reacts to another sys
tem. Yet, do these stalemates
have to be a part of college
football? The answer in a
moment, but first, we take
another look.
Ohio State, currently No. 4
in all major collegiate polls,
navigates its way through
arguably the toughest schedule
in the nation without a loss but
ends up with a tie on the road
in Ann Arbor against the 10th
ranked Michigan Wolverines.
Week in and week out, oppo
nents seek to dethrone the
Buckeyes from their lofty
national throne, but they con
tinue to rise to the occasion
every week. One week, howev
er, the game in Ann Arbor ends
in a tie, marring their record
and reputation when they
haven't even been beaten.
No. 1 Florida State, on the
other hand, ends up with an
unscarred record: no losses and
no ties. Despite the fact that
they play maybe one or two
opponents of Michigan's cal

iber all season long, the Semlnoles
will most likely wear the national
crown because of that fateful
Buckeye tie. So OSU beats Penn
State and Wisconsin on the road,
Washington and Notre Dame at
home and the Trojans in the Rose
Bowl. The Seminoles will have
beaten a number of good teams:
Florida or Nebraska in the Orange
Bowl. Yet, it's one thing to see a
national powerhouse looming in
the upcoming month and prepare

for that blockbuster matchup and
another to have to prepare for a
solid football team eveiy week.
On the other hand, Florida
State shouldn't lose the national
championship, obviously, and the
last thing I am suggesting is a tie
for the title. That could be the
only thing more ludicrous than a
tie in an individual game.
So the bottom line is that I want
overtime. I>et the teams play out
the tie. If OSU loses, then at least
there is justification for taking
away the championship from the
Buckeyes. Thriving under pressure
is characteristic of a solid, champi
onship team. If the Buckeyes had

pulled out the victory over Michi
gan in OT, they would have proven
themselves once again.
The NCAA allows for overtime
in bowl games, symbolically
admitting that ties are unaccept
able for final ranking purposes.
But in college football, when a
game in October can mean as
much as that game in January,
why not implement the same rule?
Whoever said that a tie was like
kissing your sister could not have
painted a more accurate represen
tation. Inevitably then, I must ask
the following question: How long
will it take the NCAA to realize that
kissing your sister is not that cool?
