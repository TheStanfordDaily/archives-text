## Painful ache of ties 
### 
Picture, if you will, the fol
lowing scenario: The
University of Wisconsin,
along with a tremendous fol
lowing of Badger faithful, have
journeyed across the country
for a Big Ten-Pac-10 clash
against the Stanford Cardinal.
The contest seesaws back and
forth for the entire game with
each team behaving respon
sively, answering offensive
score with offensive score. Car-

dinal senior quarterback Mark
Butterfield throws for over 300
yards, connecting on 20 of 23
attempts during one stretch of
the game. Meanwhile, running
back Carl MeCu Hough hoists
the Wisconsin offense on his
back and carries the Badgers
for over 200 yards.
Spectacular stunts, but all
for not. Knotted at 24, the Car
dinal offense finally stalls on
the last drive of the game
before reaching field goal range
and the game ends in a tie.
Reaction Ã¼biquitous disap
pointment throughout the Sta
dium. After Butterfield's last
ditch-Doug Flutie attempt falls
outside the wing span of senior
Mark Harris, the crowd stands
in silence. The clock had
stopped running, and both
squads look around before
slowly heading toward their
respective locker rooms.
I had just witnessed one of
the most exciting college foot
ball games in my spectator
career. A game which took me
to the highs of Mt. Fuji and the
lows of Death Valley dropped

me off back at sea level. Dare I
say blue balls?
The only thing to show for
the game was an awkward
third wheel hanging from each
teams' record. The Wisconsin
squad had traveled over 2,000
miles to compete in a game in
which the scoreboard would
reveal nothing more than it did
before the game started. Stan
ford and Wisconsin alumni and
fans traveled across the coun
try for bragging rights but left
empty-handed, forced to wait
until next year's game in Madi
son.
If serious injuries had
occurred during the game,
these teams would have actu
ally benefited from not playing
the game. Obviously, it is
always good to get action
against another squad, to see
how your offense responds to
live pressure and how your
defense reacts to another sys
tem. Yet, do these stalemates
have to be a part of college
football? The answer in a
moment, but first, we take
another look.
Ohio State, currently No. 4
in all major collegiate polls,
navigates its way through
arguably the toughest schedule
in the nation without a loss but
ends up with a tie on the road
in Ann Arbor against the 10th
ranked Michigan Wolverines.
Week in and week out, oppo
nents seek to dethrone the
Buckeyes from their lofty
national throne, but they con
tinue to rise to the occasion
every week. One week, howev
er, the game in Ann Arbor ends
in a tie, marring their record
and reputation when they
haven't even been beaten.
No. 1 Florida State, on the
other hand, ends up with an
unscarred record: no losses and
no ties. Despite the fact that
they play maybe one or two
opponents of Michigan's cal
