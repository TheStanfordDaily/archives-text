## Eighth-ranked Cardinal women's team looks to keep winning ball rolling 
### Bobby Cuzu Contributing writer 
After enjoying a week-and-a
half layoff, the eighth-ranked
women's soccer team (9-3 overall,
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) takes
to the road again today to face St.
Mary's (5-7-1) in Moraga, Calif.
Stanford moved up two notch
es in the national rankings last
weekend despite the break in its
schedule. Its only assignment
was an exhibition match last Sun
day against a team composed of
alumni.
The women have improved
steadily since they fell 3-2 to sev
enth-ranked Santa Clara back on
Sept. 23. The Cardinal's only
defeat in the ensuing three-and
a-half weeks came at the hands
of top-ranked and nine-time
defending national champion
North Carolina. Two weekends
ago, Stanford posted a 2-1 victo
ry over No. 18 Oregon State and
handed Arkansas a 6-0 drub
bing.
"I'm still concerned about our
finishing," said head coach lan
Sawyers, "but in terms of our
overall play, I've been very
pleased with our improvement.
The players have been working
very hard in practice to try to cor
rect some of those problems
we've been having."
With less than a month to go
before the first round of NCAA
playoffs, the women will be look
ing to turn their game up a notch.
"From here on in, every game is
very, very important," Sawyers
said, "not only because we play a
lot of Pac-10 games, but also
because now is the time of year
when you need to be winning.
Going into postseason play, you
need to be gaining momentum
and trying to improve your rank
ing."
Today, Stanford will face a St.
Mary's team reeling from four
consecutive defeats, including
shutout losses to three of the top

four teams in the nation — No. 4
Southern Methodist, No. 1 North
Carolina and No. 2 Portland.
After going undefeated for their
first five games, the Gaels have
dropped seven of their last eight
to fall to 5-7-1.
They don't look to fare much
better today. Thanks largely in
part to the efforts of Ail-American
defender Jessica Fischer and
freshman goalkeeper Erin Bryla
(0.83 goals-against average), Stan
ford has recorded seven shutouts
to date, just four short of last
year's mark. Offensively, the Car

dinal continue to rely on the lead
ership of senior midfielder Carmel
Murphy, who leads the team with
22 points (nine goals, four assists).
Junior forward Erin Martin ranks
second with six goals and four
assists for 16 points.
Martin warns against overcon
fidence, however. "We can't look
past any team, whet her it's North
Carolina or St. Mary's," she said.
"The next game is always our
most important game."
The Cardinal took advantage of
the off-weekend to rest some
injured players. With injuries to
Martin, freshman defender
Christy Stoffel and midfielders Elie
Foster and Charmaine Leßlanc,
the team has five starters walking
wounded. "Obviously, the vari

ables | during the remainder of the
season] are going to be injuries,"
Sawyers said. "We've got some kid*
who are banged up It was fortu
nate for us that we had the alumni

our players
Senior midfielder Kim Dono
hue (seven goals, three assists)
and junior forward Monika Lars
son (two goals, two assists) lead
the Gaels offensively. Donohue
and Larsson rank fifth and
eighth, respectively, on St. Mary's
all-time scoring list.
"This game is really important
because it can be a turning point
for us," Martin said. "This is our
time to implement the things
we've been working on, to show
what we am reallv do."
