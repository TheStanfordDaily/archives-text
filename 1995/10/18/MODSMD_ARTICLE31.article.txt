## Eighth-ranked Cardinal women's team looks to keep winning ball rolling 
### Bobby Cuzu Contributing writer 
After enjoying a week-and-a
half layoff, the eighth-ranked
women's soccer team (9-3 overall,
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) takes
to the road again today to face St.
Mary's (5-7-1) in Moraga, Calif.
Stanford moved up two notch
es in the national rankings last
weekend despite the break in its
schedule. Its only assignment
was an exhibition match last Sun
day against a team composed of
alumni.
The women have improved
steadily since they fell 3-2 to sev
enth-ranked Santa Clara back on
Sept. 23. The Cardinal's only
defeat in the ensuing three-and
a-half weeks came at the hands
of top-ranked and nine-time
defending national champion
North Carolina. Two weekends
ago, Stanford posted a 2-1 victo
ry over No. 18 Oregon State and
handed Arkansas a 6-0 drub
bing.
"I'm still concerned about our
finishing," said head coach lan
Sawyers, "but in terms of our
overall play, I've been very
pleased with our improvement.
The players have been working
very hard in practice to try to cor
rect some of those problems
we've been having."
With less than a month to go
before the first round of NCAA
playoffs, the women will be look
ing to turn their game up a notch.
"From here on in, every game is
very, very important," Sawyers
said, "not only because we play a
lot of Pac-10 games, but also
because now is the time of year
when you need to be winning.
Going into postseason play, you
need to be gaining momentum
and trying to improve your rank
ing."
Today, Stanford will face a St.
Mary's team reeling from four
consecutive defeats, including
shutout losses to three of the top
