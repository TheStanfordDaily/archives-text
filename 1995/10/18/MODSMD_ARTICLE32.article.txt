# Swanson hopes to improve
## 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Pete Swanson isn't very happy with
himself these days. The senior, expected
to emerge as one of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's top defensive tackles in 1995, has
failed to meet his own standards.
"I think I've had a pretty bad season,"
he said. "My pass rush has been a lot
worse than last year."
In 1994, Swanson made his first
appearance in the starting lineup in the
team's second game at San Jose State. He
nearly single-handedly destroyed the
Spartans with six tackles, four sacks, five
tackles-for-loss and one caused fumble.
Unfortunately, the following week he
suffered a sprained knee. When he
returned for the final three games, he
picked up where he had left off, tying for
the team lead in sacks and finishing third
in tackles-for-loss despite playing in only
six games.
At the end of the '94 campaign, the
future looked bright for Swanson. What
happened to dim his light in 1995?
"I can't pinpoint it exactly," he said.
"It's mostly mental.
"Last year, I had a really good game
against San Jose State. It boosted my con
fidence. I'm a player who gets a lot off
confidence. Even though I hurt my knee
and missed some games, I had that confi
dence when I came back. I don't think
I've had it this year."
Things reached a boiling point last Sat
urday against Washington. The big
Husky offensive front repeatedly blew the
Stanford defensive front off the line of
scrimmage, allowing Washington running
back Rashaan Shehee to rack up yardage
and providing quarterback Damon Huard
with time to throw the ball. Swanson, in
particular, felt ineffective.
"They did some things offensively that
got me thinking instead of reacting," he
said. "That's no excuse, though. You still
need to play tough."
Some speculate that a foot injury suf
fered back in spring may be the culprit
behind Swanson's slow start.
"Pete's play has been very timely,"
said Stanford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "He's still coming off that foot
injury, so he hasn't been complete. We
need all our guys, including Pete, to pick
it up and get better execution."
Swanson refuses to allow the problems
with his foot to exonerate what he consid
ers sub-par performance.
"Maybe for the first three or four
games it was a factor, he said. But after
the bye week, it felt great. Even for those
early games, it wasn't much of a factor. It
didn't hurt that much."
While Swanson argues that the injury
has not directly affected his play on the
field this season, it may have done so indi
rectly. By keeping him out of spring prac
tice and limiting his ability to participate
in summer drills, the foot injury kept him

rusty while others, opponents and team
mates alike, were working on their
respective skills.
"I've missed a lot of practice," Swan
son said. "My technique has been pretty
rough."
The Cardinal needed Swanson more
than ever in its first six games. As one of
a tiny handful of defensive linemen who
have not missed games this year due to
injury, Swanson has had to pick up the
slack when teammates went down.
Could the extra pressure be wearing him
down?
"I'd like to think that, but that's not
it,"he said. "Last year, we had the same
number of guys, the same kinds of rota
tions. I probably even played more
downs."
So what does Swanson have to do to
turn his year around in Stanford's five
remaining games?
"I'd have to get a sack in every game,"
he said. "I'd have to get consistent pres
sure on the quarterback. I'd like to make
more plays that I'm not directly involved
in, that are outside my assignment."
Swanson will have an opportunity to
accomplish these objectives this Saturday
against UCLA, and the opportunity will
come against some old acquaintances.
True freshman Cade McNown is tenta
tively slated to start for the Bruins at
quarterback this weekend. He and Swan
son attended the same high school â€” San
Benito High in Hollister, Calif. Although
Swanson is three years older than
McNown, the Cardinal lineman is famil
iar with the young Bruin.
"I know Cade really well," Swanson
said. "I played football with his brother
(Jeff), and I grew up attending the same
church as his family."
The Cardinal game plan may call for
rattling the inexperienced Bruin. Despite
completing 52.3 percent of his passes
thus far, McNown connected on only
three of 18 attempts last week against
Arizona and is still adjusting to the col
lege ranks.
"I think we'll put a lot more emphasis
on him because he's young," Swanson
said, "maybe more than in some other
games, but you always want to get to the
quarterback."
The Cardinal may not scare McNown
too much, however. Playing with the big
ger boys is something that he's done
throughout his life, ever since he was
rough-housing with his older brother and
Swanson. He has also seen considerable
action in 1995.
"He's started three games, so he's got
most of his baby jitters out of him,"
Swanson said. "And he's got a great
offensive front to protect him."
A large part of that offensive front is
senior left tackle Jonathan Ogden.
Almost a lock for All-American honors at
the position. Ogden has dominated the
