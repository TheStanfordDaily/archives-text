## Cardinal has lackluster performance at Naval Academy regatta 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
The Stanford sailing team's
depth was put to the test this week
end when six of its members trav
eled east to compete in an important
intersectional regatta hosted by the
Naval Academy. The Cardinal
placed eighth overall out of 20
teams.
Head coach Steve Bourdow had
higher expectations for his team.
He thought his team had already
gained the necessary experience to
succeed as the Cardinal heads deep
er into its season. "It was a definite
setback, especially after we had

been doing so well," he said. "I was
counting on a top-five finish We
finished at least four places below
what I had expected. Placing eighth
shows just how much harder we
have to work in order to gain back

lost ground."
The Division A team, comprised
of seniors Danny Zimbaldi and
Betsy Carmichael, captured 12th
place while Bourdow had hoped for a
top-seven finish. Juniors Kevin Pid
duck and Barry Kang placed 14th in
Division B, but unlike the more
experienced Division A team, Pid
duck and Kang were a brand new
team and not as familiar with sail
ing together. "Conditions were
rough," Bourdow said. "They sailed
well while racing in familiar Flying
Junior [boatsl, but once they
switched over to a 420 [boat], things
started looking down. It's
understandable."
Senior John Meade placed
surprisingly low in Division C
with a seventh-place perfor
mance, whereas Bourdow had
expected a top-five finish. The
only division Stanford came
close to dominating was Divi
sion D, in which senior Adam
Lowry came in third.
Tufts won the regatta, with
the Naval Academy taking sec
ond. "Most of the schools that
placed high above us should
have," Bourdow said. "But some
of the other teams which fin
ished ahead of us make me won
der just how much effort Stan
ford put into the regatta. We
really didn't show our potential.
Take Connecticut College, for
example, coming from no
where. Even they placed above
us with merely mediocre
scores."
As a result of such a low plac
ing, Stanford's ranking will
drop. The Cardinal will likely
fall out of the top 10 for the first
time in Bourdow's history at
Stanford. Previously ranked
ninth, the team will rest at
either No. 11 or No. 12 until it
can reassert itself.
"That chance can be this week
end," Carmichael said. "With the
Stanford Invite starting on Sat
urday, every member of the team
will have the opportunity to prove
his or her own ability and hope
fully move our team back up to
where we belong."
