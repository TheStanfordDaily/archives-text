Greg Jimmcrson
Cardinal Greg Jimmerson is flat-out the men's cross
country team's money man. The junior co-captain led the
third-ranked men's team to a first-place finish in the
lowa State Cross Country Classic, site of this year's
NCAA Championships. Jimmerson finished ninth overall
individually in a very competitive field.

Stanford center-forward Monique Leroux is rapidly
establishing herself as one of Cardinal field hockey's top
offensive playmakers. The precocious freshman leads the
team with 15 points off four goals and seven assists,
including a one goal and three assist outburst last Satur
day against Pacific.
