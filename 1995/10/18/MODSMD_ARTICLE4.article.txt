## ASSU financial team aims for better returns 
### Richard Engel 
With the help of new student talent, the
ASSU is investing its money more wisely
than ever.
The student-run organization has been
criticized in the past for poorly managing
its money. Specifically, the ASSU came
under fire last year for poorly managing its
short-term, or cash, investments.
Currently, the ASSU allocates more
than $2 million to its short-term portfolio,
or approximately 43 percent of its total $4.7
million holdings. The ASSU receives its
revenue from business projects such as
Sunday Flicks, ASSU Lecture Notes and
the Cardinal Collection.
"There was a general agreement that we
could do much better with our cash," said
ASSU Financial Manager John Hall. "We
have made some simple changes that have
been successful."
Last year, the ASSU's cash investments
earned a meager 3.65 percent in an operat
ing account with the University. Today, the
account receives between 5.5 percent and
5.7 percent in returns from a Money Mar
ket Account through Merrill Lynch. The
switch earned the ASSU a risk-free increase
of 2 percent on their cash holdings.

The financial maneuver was the brain
child of the ASSU's current Investment
Manager Joshua Lau, a junior majoring in
economics. Before working part time for
the ASSU, Lau spent two summers work
ing in Japan, evaluating portfolios, recom
mending stocks and pricing options.
"We have done a lot to improve the sys
tem, but there is still a lot to do," said Lau.
The ASSU is currently enjoying finan
cial independence from the University,
having lost its funds in the 1994 round of
budget cuts. With the long term in mind,
Lau and Hall have begun to focus their at
tention on the $2.7 million which the
ASSU holds in long-term, or equity, ac
counts.
"We are currently evaluating our long
term holdings," said Hall. "And since the
ASSU no longer receives financial support
from the University, it's time to look to the
future and be more conservative."
The ASSU's equity investments are gen
erally managed by two professionals at
Smith Barney and since 1990 have consis
tently brought the organization a healthy
return of approximately 10 percent annual
ly. Lau, however, said he felt the ASSU
