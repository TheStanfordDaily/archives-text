# Education in the ether
## Four Stanford classes are available on the Internet as part of 'ADEPT'

Stanford University, long
known as a leader in technology, is
maintaining its spot on the cut
ting edge with an experimental
new program which will allow stu
dents around the world to take
classes via the Internet.
Stanford ADEPT — which
stands for Asynchronous Dis
tance Education Project — is a
program in which students use
computers to view lectures and
presentations as well as receive
handouts and assignments from
one of four engineering courses.
The project, funded in part by a
$500,000 grant from the Alfred P.
Sloan foundation, is now entering
its second phase after a limited
pilot run last spring. In this stage,
approximately 100 working pro
fessionals — many from Hewlett
Packard and the Livermore Na
tional Laboratory — are taking
the classes.
The project's designers are also
learning in this phase, trying to
determine what technologies and
educational strategies work best
in this type of instructional set
ting.
The project is now going "re
markably well, for an experimen
tal project," said Andy DiPaolo,
ADEPT co-director and associate
dean in the School of Engineering.
"We're pushing the environment
and this has been useful in help
ing the next generation of long
distance learners."
The students enrolled are able

to download videotapes of class
lectures. Though it takes about 10
minutes to download a low-grade
video, using a high-powered serv
er could reduce the time to about a
minute, said Dale Harris, ADEPT
co-director and executive director
of Stanford's Center for Telecom
munications.
In addition, 50 megabytes of
free disk storage is required for
downloading the movie files, al
though 100 is the recommended
amount.
According to DiPaolo, the stu
dents are generally pleased, al
though their reactions are "mixed
overall."
"The production values are
low. The video is slow frame, but
the sound and graphics are excel
lent. However, the convenience
factor is very high. These classes
are good for skills they can apply
to lives and they can do it on their
own time," he said.
Four courses are being offered
this quarter: Computer Science
145: "Introduction to Databases;"
Computer Science 240 A: "Operat
ing Systems & Systems Program
ming;" Electrical Engineering
250: "Communications Design
Seminar;" and Mechanical Engi
neering 21 OA: "Mechatronic Sys
tems Design and Methodology."
Technologically, the project
has been "very difficult," accord
ing to I larris. "The task is to inte
grate advanced disparate tech
nologies" in fields like audio and
