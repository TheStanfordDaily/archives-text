# Mothers to all, volunteers keep students going

A little sign fixed loosely to the old railings tells
the visitor that he has found the place. It is not
promising: The paint on the railing is peeling; flies
are circling around the two large bins at the bottom
of the stairway; and people are waiting at the top of
the stairs, away from the sour odors of the basement.
Suddenly, a bright voice breaks the hush and
quick steps reverberate in the air. Dallas Manning
has arrived.
Manning produces a key, enters two doors and
flicks a switch. The world is transformed. The dank
basement hall opens onto shelf upon shelf of trea
sures — sheets, blankets, pots, pans and crockery. It
is the Loan Closet for International Students at
Stanford.
Manningis one of hundreds of behind-the-scenes
volunteers at Stanford, hardly known but crucial.
She gives her time to the Stanford liOan Closet for
International Students, the Stanford Mothers' Club
and the Community Committee for International
Students (CCIS). She and others in the local com
munity help make Stanford feel more like home.
Manning's boss is Mid Schubert. Schubert has
been running the Closet for over five years. She
pursed her lips as she considered its history — it
wasn't quite like this in the beginning, she said. It
took a lot of paint, a lot of detergent and a lot of elbow
grease to make the place look like it does today.
Schubert now receives calls from as far away as
Italy — foreign students on their way to Stanford
call to ask what they can borrow when they ;irrive.
Indeed an Israeli "client" once told her, "You have no
idea how much information is available in Israel
about the little old ladies at Stanford."
Of particular concern to many volunteers at Stan
ford is the undergraduate community, many of
whom are away from home for the first time. The
Mothers' Club, which was established 70 years ago
by a group of mothers whose children were at Stan
ford, works to soothe homesickness. The group,
which offers membership to parents of undrrgradu-

ates for dues of $20 per year, com
prises over 50 volunteers and has
approximately 900 members.
Given advance warning, they
organize birthday cakes for stu
dents, balloons and flowers for any
occasion and various fund-raisers
for two annual scholarships.
Urmila John, the treasurer,
joined when her son was a student
here. He has since graduated but
she is still a volunteer.
"I liked the idea of giving back,"
she said. She also wanted to make a
point about community help: "You
must not only give money, but you
must give time."
John explained one of the many
ways in which the group fund rais
es. Two years ago, they held a
phantom Tea Party. The invita
tions read, "You are cordially invit
ed not to attend a Tea Party." They
continued, "But please enjoy a cup
of tea from the tea-bag enclosed,"
and then asked for a small dona

tion towards the scholarship fund.
They managed to raise one full
scholarship from this initiative
alone.
John also volunteers in the
English in Action Program, a
group put together hy CCIS, an
organization of over 700 volun
teers. This program matches an
international student with an
American volunteer for one hour
weekly of English conversation.
John has been participating for
four years. She came to America
from India in 1965 and was treated
warmly by Americans.
"1 am paying back the generosi
ty shown to me," she said.
She said she tries to help foreign
students to assimilate to the Amer
ican culture and way of life.
"This is America, so you must
help your wife," she suggested to a
student from Taiwan. He began to
cook and shop.
"Go looking at America with
open eyes," she advised her stu
dent-partner last year. He came
from Japan and was being
groomed for political office, liaised
by strict parents, he finally told her

that inside he felt more liberal.
"Hut that creates a conflict and 1
don't like it,"he told her. John was
pleased: "I wanted him to see it,"
she said.
Other programs organized by
CCIS include home-stays, when
newly arrived international stu
dents are housed by an American
family; community advisers during
Orientation week; English classes;
and hospiUdity events, where vol
unteers invite internationals to
their homes to celebrate holidays
like Thanksgiving and the Fourth
of July.
"I have learned from interna
tionals to be more adventurous, to
take calculated risks," said Mary
Schuelke, president of business
affairs at CCIS. "We are very privi
leged as a university to have such a
large international community."
off in 1980, after 17 years
as a financial consultant — she
graduated from the Stanford Busi
ness School in 19(53 — Schuelke
felt she needed something new.
First she traveled to Africa. She
experienced "warmth, gracious
ness and hospitality that was very

new to me," she said and decided
she could offer exactly that to
internationals visiting her own
country. She has been a profession
al volunteer, supported by her
church, ever since.
Her greatest frustration is per
haps that she cannot speak all lan
guages. She described a child who
turned to her, spoke in rapid
Japanese and then looked up at hei
expectantly. She could not answer.
Instead she met his regard with a
smile — "heart communication" is
her alternative language
"Internationals here are my
family," said Ms Schuelke. "I want
to continue my relationships as
long as it is possible."
The other support network for
volunteers — one that is surely
crucial given the time and energy
required for their jobs — is the
sense of community generated
among the women.
"This is a great effort and 1 am
just one in this whole picture,"
John explained. "That's how this
club functions: Each brings their
own specialty and helps make the
whole picture."
