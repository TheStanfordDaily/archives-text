That's our domain, after all. Some
23,000 miles above the earth. As
a premier, global designer of
satellites for communications and
weather monitoring purposes, we
offer a great variety of projects
for you to develop. Besides design
ing satellites, we also launch them.
We have launch sites in such exotic
places as South America, China,
Kazakhstan and even Florida. In
fact, we presently have a backlog
of 75 satellites! Because we have
over 35 years of satellite communi
cations experience, it's safe to say
we'll be around for the long haul.
Our satellites enable people to
make instantaneous connections
with others. From wireless hand
held telephone service and video
conferencing, to digital services
involving voice, video, and data
transmissions. In addition, we do
extensive R&D with propul
sion systems, rechargeable
nickel-hydrogen batteries
and power electronics,
solar arrays, advanced
composites, attitude
control systems
and all-weather/ / /
testing of S X/
antenna subsystems.
We will be on campus
interviewing for the
following positions:
• Mechanical Engineers
•Electrical Engineers
•Finance
