# Despite rumors, Res Ed says RAs not alcohol police
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Over the last few weeks, there has
been a growing impression among stu
dents that Residential Education is ex
pecting resident assistants to crack
down on underage drinking.
But Jane Camarillo, the new direc
tor of Res Ed, said that the rumors are
false, and that there has been no change

in either Stanford's alcohol policy or in
the role RAs should play in enforce
ment.
"The alcohol policy has not
changed," she said. "Are RAs expected
to enforce the law? No. Have they been
expected to enforce the law? No. Will
they be expected to enforce the law?
No."
However, "being an RA means you
are a University employee and all Uni

versity employees should obey the law,"
Camarillo said. "We have other [en
forcementl structures in place that do
not include RAs."
Still, if students are not quite sure
how RAs will enforce alcohol-consump
tion regulations, it is with good reason:
Student affairs administrators seem to
have conflicting ideas of RA responsibil
ity, and many RAs are uncertain about
what Res Ed expects from them.

In a recent interview, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais — also new to Stan
ford this year — put forward a view
about what is expected of residence
staff members that directly contradicts
Camarillo's statement.
"I understand the culture of Stan
ford in the past has been not to enforce
[the drinking agel as vigorously as at

'I understand the cul
ture of Stanford in the
past has been not to
enforce [the drinking
age] as vigorously as
at other schools.'
