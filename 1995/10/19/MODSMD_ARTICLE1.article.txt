# Despite rumors, Res Ed says RAs not alcohol police
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Over the last few weeks, there has
been a growing impression among stu
dents that Residential Education is ex
pecting resident assistants to crack
down on underage drinking.
But Jane Camarillo, the new direc
tor of Res Ed, said that the rumors are
false, and that there has been no change

in either Stanford's alcohol policy or in
the role RAs should play in enforce
ment.
"The alcohol policy has not
changed," she said. "Are RAs expected
to enforce the law? No. Have they been
expected to enforce the law? No. Will
they be expected to enforce the law?
No."
However, "being an RA means you
are a University employee and all Uni

versity employees should obey the law,"
Camarillo said. "We have other [en
forcementl structures in place that do
not include RAs."
Still, if students are not quite sure
how RAs will enforce alcohol-consump
tion regulations, it is with good reason:
Student affairs administrators seem to
have conflicting ideas of RA responsibil
ity, and many RAs are uncertain about
what Res Ed expects from them.

In a recent interview, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais — also new to Stan
ford this year — put forward a view
about what is expected of residence
staff members that directly contradicts
Camarillo's statement.
"I understand the culture of Stan
ford in the past has been not to enforce

'I understand the cul
ture of Stanford in the
past has been not to
enforce [the drinking
age] as vigorously as
at other schools.'

other schools. But I think there's
a clear understanding at the Uni
versity that Stanford is going to
have to enforce it more rigorous
ly," said Wais.
"In Stanford publications, it
says quite clearly that Stanford is
not going to stand as a sanctuary
concerning alcohol violations. If
we print that in a publication, I
think there's a burden on us to
enforce that to keep integrity," he
added.
Wais noted that though he is
not in a position to supervise or
instruct RAs, he sees a significant
role for them in enforcing the
drinking age.
"If I'm an RA and I'm walking
down the hallway, and I see an
underage student carrying a six
pack and drinking a bottle of beer
. . . I would have to confront that
situation. Otherwise it just sends
out the very clear message that
anything goes," he said.
But Camarillo, the person who
does supervise RAs, did not agree.
"An RA Jiould not say 'you
should not drink because you're
underage,' " she said.
What does differ from past pro
cedures is that RAs are being told
to intervene with students who
may be drinking excessively. "I
don't think RAs have been given
(those] instructions in the past,"
Camarillo said.
"If an underage student is

clearly intoxicated and continuing
to drink, [an RAJ should stop it,"
she added, noting that RAs should
maintain roles as peers, not
enforcers.
Residence staff members, by
and large, confirm Camarillo's
assertion that no policy changes
have been made but acknowledge
that there is some sense that RAs
should be taking a more active
role.
"I think people are looking for
a change because there's been a
change in leadership," said Lin
guistics Prof. John Rickford, resi
dent fellow in Kimball, who said
he hasn't seen any change hap
pen.
Res Ed expects RAs "to stop
students from drinking when the
student is in imminent danger to
himself or others — and that
applies to all ages," said Roger
Yang, a junior and an RAin Bur
bank.
"I think it is reasonable for Res
Ed to expect us to be on more of a
lookout, but not to the extent of
policing," he said.
Though there is no codified dif
ference from previous years' poli
cies, some liAs note an implicit
change in Res Ed's expectations.
"As far as policy, they haven't
asked us to do anything differ
ent," said David Herrera, a junior
and RAin Roble.
However, "they really want us
to promote . . . the idea that
drinking is not okay," he said. "It
seems that Res Ed is stoppingjust
short of turning us into police."
Herrera noted that in RA

training, "they were very emphat
ic about stressing the liability
risk."
"I think that they were trying
to use scare tactics to make sure
that RAs are not as liberal as they
have been in recent years," he
said.
"During RA training this year,
[Res Ed was] taking a more active
role to alcohol abuse than in the
past," said Katie Friedman, a
senior and RAin Cedro. "We had
a whole presentation on alco
hol. ... In the presentation, they
said, 'This is the law and we're
trying to act in accordance with
that law.' "
In student-led discussions,
however, RAs were told that "it's
up to the individual's discretion,"
she said. "They emphasized being
attuned to situational issues"
such as a pattern of abuse and
potentially dangerous situations,
she added.
That was the message that
other RAs took away from train
ing. Assoc. Director of Res Ed Ann
Porteus "kept saying 'just use
your best judgment,' " said Kins
ley Earl, a senior who was an RA
in Branner last year and is now an
RAin Burbank.
RAs do seem to be very con
cerned about issues of liability,
she said.
"I don't feel that I'm under any
pressure from lies Ed to act as
more of a policeman," Earl said. "I
don't see a difference in how the
policy is handled from the admin
istrative side, but I do see a differ
ence in how RAs have reacted."

false, and that there has been no change

in either Stanford's alcohol policy or in
the role RAs should play in enforce
ment.
"The alcohol policy has not
changed," she said. "Are RAs expected
to enforce the law? No. Have they been
expected to enforce the law? No. Will
they be expected to enforce the law?
No."
However, "being an RA means you
are a University employee and all Uni

versity employees should obey the law,"
Camarillo said. "We have other [en
forcementl structures in place that do
not include RAs."
Still, if students are not quite sure
how RAs will enforce alcohol-consump
tion regulations, it is with good reason:
Student affairs administrators seem to
have conflicting ideas of RA responsibil
ity, and many RAs are uncertain about
what Res Ed expects from them.

In a recent interview, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais — also new to Stan
ford this year — put forward a view
about what is expected of residence
staff members that directly contradicts
Camarillo's statement.
"I understand the culture of Stan
ford in the past has been not to enforce
[the drinking agel as vigorously as at

age] as vigorously as

other schools. But I think there's
a clear understanding at the Uni
versity that Stanford is going to
have to enforce it more rigorous
ly," said Wais.
"In Stanford publications, it
says quite clearly that Stanford is
not going to stand as a sanctuary
concerning alcohol violations. If
we print that in a publication, I
think there's a burden on us to
enforce that to keep integrity," he
added.
Wais noted that though he is
not in a position to supervise or
instruct RAs, he sees a significant
role for them in enforcing the
drinking age.
"If I'm an RA and I'm walking
down the hallway, and I see an
underage student carrying a six
pack and drinking a bottle of beer
. . . I would have to confront that
situation. Otherwise it just sends
out the very clear message that
anything goes," he said.
But Camarillo, the person who
does supervise RAs, did not agree.
"An RA Jiould not say 'you
should not drink because you're
underage,' " she said.
What does differ from past pro
cedures is that RAs are being told
to intervene with students who
may be drinking excessively. "I
don't think RAs have been given
(those] instructions in the past,"
Camarillo said.
"If an underage student is

clearly intoxicated and continuing
to drink, [an RAJ should stop it,"
she added, noting that RAs should
maintain roles as peers, not
enforcers.
Residence staff members, by
and large, confirm Camarillo's
assertion that no policy changes
have been made but acknowledge
that there is some sense that RAs
should be taking a more active
role.
"I think people are looking for
a change because there's been a
change in leadership," said Lin
guistics Prof. John Rickford, resi
dent fellow in Kimball, who said
he hasn't seen any change hap
pen.
Res Ed expects RAs "to stop
students from drinking when the
student is in imminent danger to
himself or others — and that
applies to all ages," said Roger
Yang, a junior and an RAin Bur
bank.
"I think it is reasonable for Res
Ed to expect us to be on more of a
lookout, but not to the extent of
policing," he said.
Though there is no codified dif
ference from previous years' poli
cies, some liAs note an implicit
change in Res Ed's expectations.
"As far as policy, they haven't
asked us to do anything differ
ent," said David Herrera, a junior
and RAin Roble.
However, "they really want us
to promote . . . the idea that
drinking is not okay," he said. "It
seems that Res Ed is stoppingjust
short of turning us into police."
Herrera noted that in RA

training, "they were very emphat
ic about stressing the liability
risk."
"I think that they were trying
to use scare tactics to make sure
that RAs are not as liberal as they
have been in recent years," he
said.
"During RA training this year,
[Res Ed was] taking a more active
role to alcohol abuse than in the
past," said Katie Friedman, a
senior and RAin Cedro. "We had
a whole presentation on alco
hol. ... In the presentation, they
said, 'This is the law and we're
trying to act in accordance with
that law.' "
In student-led discussions,
however, RAs were told that "it's
up to the individual's discretion,"
she said. "They emphasized being
attuned to situational issues"
such as a pattern of abuse and
potentially dangerous situations,
she added.
That was the message that
other RAs took away from train
ing. Assoc. Director of Res Ed Ann
Porteus "kept saying 'just use
your best judgment,' " said Kins
ley Earl, a senior who was an RA
in Branner last year and is now an
RAin Burbank.
RAs do seem to be very con
cerned about issues of liability,
she said.
"I don't feel that I'm under any
pressure from lies Ed to act as
more of a policeman," Earl said. "I
don't see a difference in how the
policy is handled from the admin
istrative side, but I do see a differ
ence in how RAs have reacted."
Over the last few weeks, there has
been a growing impression among stu
dents that Residential Education is ex
pecting resident assistants to crack
down on underage drinking.
But Jane Camarillo, the new direc
tor of Res Ed, said that the rumors are
false, and that there has been no change

in either Stanford's alcohol policy or in
