# Canadian sculpture unveiled

In the redwood shade across
from the History Corner stands
"Booqwilla." Hailing from the
Western Red Cedar forests of
British Columbia is Stanford's
newest outdoor art sculpture —
a spectacular four-figured, 21-
foot totem pole.
Carved by Nuu-Chah-Nulth
Native American Art Thompson,
Booqwilla looms overhead with
both artistic and philosophical
weight. Painted in rich, earth
tones, Thompson invoked Native
American folklore in every figure
that comprises Booqwilla.
The focus of the pole is a
human being, the keeper of
knowledge, the guardian of the
earth and the true definition of
Booqwilla. At the base of the
pole lies an intriguing killer
whale / wolf hybrid animal, a
reference to a tale about the
power of the shaman. Above
that perches the supernatural
raven, responsible for the bur
den of human beings. Towering
above all three figures is a
full-spread eagle, providing
Booqwilla with different per
spectives from the sky.
The symbolic meaning with
in this majestic log is as hidden
as the artist behind its creation.
Art Thompson will soon return
to British Columbia and his
native village of Difidaht, after
just a brief stay in the Bay Area.
Booqwilla was carved in British
Columbia and painted here.
Thompson's father and grand
father "were canoe builders . . .
the last among his people," he
said. Self-taught in the difficult
skill of totem pole building,
Thompson has created art for
the last 31 years. Most of his
other work is displayed in
British Columbia.
Booqwilla is the second out
door art project to expand Stan
ford's collection. The first is the
Papua New Guinea Sculpture

Garden near Roble. Both art
projects are efforts to "diversify
[Stanford's art collection] from
just Western art," said Thomas

Seligman, director of the Stan
ford Art Museum. Seligman also
noted that a Japanese rock gar
den may be installed the future.
