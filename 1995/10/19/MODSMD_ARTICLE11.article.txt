## Lawmakers protest deployment Clinton team defends decision to send 20,000 to Bosnia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Con-
Juring images of body bags and
bereaved families, lawmakers chal
lenged the Clinton administration
yesterday to justify sending Ameri
cans' sons mid daughters to Bosnia
to enforce a fragile peace.
President Clinton's top defense
and foreign policy officials argued
that the proposed 20,000-member
peacekeeping mission is essential to
prevent the 3 1/2-year-old war from
spreading.
But many lawmakers remained
skeptical.
Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif.,
the committee's senior Democrat,
said there is "no consensus" among
Democrats for going into Bosnia in
the event of a peace settlement.
In a second day of congressional
hearings, Perry, Christopher and
Gen. John Shaiikashvili, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, por
trayed the proposed troop deploy
ment as the only way of staving off
a wider war.
To avoid such a catastrophe, the
officials said, the United States
must take part in a NATO peace

keeping force that would come in
with heavy arms and establish a
buffer zone between the warring
parties after they have reached a
peace agreement.
Christopher announced yester
day that Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, will
be the site of a new round of Bosnia
peace talks between top officials of
Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
Facing general skepticism about
the mission, the administration
officials argued that doing nothing
would guarantee that the Bosnian
conflict continues. That would
increase the risk that it would
spread to threaten U.S. fillies such
as Greece and Turkey.
At that point, Christopher said,
"we would have to put in not
20,000 troops, but maybe 10 times
as many."
Perry added that the choice for
the United States is not between
going in or doing nothing but
between helping establish peace or
going in later at much greater risk.
"We do not have the choice
between taking the risk and no risk

but between two different qualities
of risk," Perry said.
The administration is using
Haiti as its model, noting the light
casualties — one killed in action
during the U.S. occupation that
restored President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide to power.
But Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla.,
called that comparison "absurd,"
saying that Bosnia, with its heavily
armed factions, more closely resem
bles Beirut, Lebanon, where the
United States lost 241 Marines in
1983.
Under the administration plan,
the 20,000 U.S. troops, including
2,000 to 3,000 reservists, would
move into Bosnia as part of a
60,000-person NATO force. Sha
iikashvili said some troops could
begin to pull out within months,
assuming things go smoothly, and
the entire force would be with
drawn after 12 months.
The deployment would cost $1
billion to $1.5 billion, with the
administration seeking $250 mil
lion to $500 million in aid to
Bosnia.
