Republicans deny possibility of debt crisis
WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Newt Gingrich backed
away yesterday from an offer to temporarily extend the government's
borrowing authority, saying Clinton administration warnings of a
crisis by Halloween could not be trusted.
In the latest exchange in a war of nerves, the Georgia Republican
said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's projections that the federal
debt limit would be reached Oct. 31 could be "a Halloween trick to try
to scare people." Before agreeing to raise the debt ceiling for even a
short time, Republicans would insist that Rubin provide details on
the government's borrowing needs, Gingrich said.
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, expressing administration
chagrin, said the standoff over federal borrowing "is now apparently
going to be a crisis because Congress won't act to extend the debt ceiling."
By law, the government's total debt cannot exceed $4.9 trillion.
The Treasury Department had said that limit would be reached Oct.

31, though the limited borrowing plans it announced Tuesday pushed
that back a few days.
Helms relents on Cuba bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Jesse Helms, bowing to Democratic
pressure, scaled back legislat ion yesterday tightening economic sanc
tions against Cuba. The Clinton administration later approved a visa
for Cuban President Fidel Castro permitting him to address the Unit
ed Nations.
Castro was expected to arrive Saturday.
After narrowly losing two procedural votes, Helms, R-N.C., agreed
to abandon his effort to limit foreign investment in Cuba through
legal means. The Senate then voted 98-0 to invoke cloture, paving the
way for final passage, expected today.
Cuba has been actively courting investment from Spain and other
countries to reverse the nation's economic decline, and Helms argued

that Castro's days would be numbered if his bill forced would-be
investors to take their money elsewhere.
The provision would have allowed Cuban exiles who are now nat
uralized U.S. citizens to sue in U.S. courts foreigners in Cuba who
"traffic" in the tens of billions of dollars worth of property seized by
the Cuban revolution without compensation. It would also bar such
troffickers and their close relatives from visiting the United States.
Peace talks begin in Mexico
SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) — Rebel leaders
came down from their mountain hideouts, government officials left
their city offices, and the two sides opened their first substantive peace
talks yesterday since t he months after a January 1994 Indian uprising.
Talks are expected to last for several days. Then in a few weeks, 15
negotiators from each side will begin a second round, wrapping up
wh.it hundreds of representatives are discussing this week.
