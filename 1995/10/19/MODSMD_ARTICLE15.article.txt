						gifts overhead 
### 
Always searching for
new ways to cover costs with
an ever-shrinking budget, the
University has recently announced
that, as of Jan. 1, six percent of all
restricted donations will be taken to
reimburse overhead costs.
The move is an intelligent way to
save Stanford some money — an
estimated $3.5 million will be trans
ferred into the University's general
fund in 1995-96 alone. And the Uni
versity is wise to spare donations to
financial aid and research, both cur
rently under intense pressure, and
to exempt past restricted donors
who won't go along with the change.
But the key is whether new
donors will go along with the policy.
Citing the need to be firm, officials
have said that Stanford will not
accept gifts from any future donors
who do not agree to the change.
While a hard-line stance is
admirable, it is a dangerous prece
dent to set at a time when the Uni

versity has obviously and actively
made fund raising one of its highest
priorities.
It's unlikely that many donors
will decide not to give money to
Stanford just because of this policy
— after all, six percent isn't asking
much. But administrators and fac
ulty members should do their best
to work with and educate those
who aren't pleased with the change.
In a few cases, officials might want
to reconsider the tough stance for
those who won't agree to the policy
at all. Though size shouldn't theo
retically matter, it would be a
shame to lose a large donation just
because of an infrastructure
charge.
The new policy could easily be
misinterpreted as University misap
propriation of funds by donors who
know exactly where they want their
money to go. Portraying the change
in a positive light will be crucial to
its success.
