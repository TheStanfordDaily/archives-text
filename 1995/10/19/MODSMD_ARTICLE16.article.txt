# Size indeed matters
## 
### 
IT SEEMS WITH each passing
year at Stanford, the size of
sections grow while the bud
gets for departments shrink.
Budget cutbacks are a neces
sary part of trimming the overall
spending deficit, but we question
the wisdom of cutting back on
sections while increasing their
size.
Section is where much of a stu
dent's in-depth learning occurs
and questions outside of class and
office hours are answered.
According to psychological stud
ies at least, studying and dis
cussing ideas in a group enhances
the learning curve.
While Stanford is nowhere
near having students perch on
window sills to hear a teaching
assistant speak, large sections
hamper the effectiveness of sec
tions. Students could miss oppor
tunities to share viewpoints or
pose critical questions.
Especially hard hit are fresh

man programs. Classes in CIV,
Writing and Critical Thinking
and the languages have sections
that are near or at the limits of
enrollment. The result could be a
weakening of the core courses
that freshmen need not only dur
ing their collegiate career, but
also beyond Stanford.
Administrators constantly
point out that the cost of a Stan
ford education is far in excess of
what the University charges, that
students are getting more than
what they pay for. While in prin
cipal this may be true, it does not
negate the fact that Stanford is
an expensive place to spend four
years. We would hope that
$30,000 goes farther than buying
a brand-name diploma.
And besides, didn't the glossy
admissions packet that so enticed
us to attend Stanford promise an
intimate learning environment?
We hope that fact continues to
match the advertising.
