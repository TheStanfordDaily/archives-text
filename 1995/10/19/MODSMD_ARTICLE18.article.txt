## Who's the fairest of all?

LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL people on
campus. No dating at Stanford.
The link between the two may
not be immediately apparent, but that's
why we have the guys at the social psych'
department to help us out.
You see, according to Social Psycholo
gy Today [11:120-122], beautiful people
tend to have more transient, short-term
relationships. 2 People of lesser beauty
tend to have longer-lasting, committed
relationships. 3 Stated more concisely, if
you are in a relationship, you are U-G-L-
Y. 4 (You know what I mean. Not only did
you hit every single branch falling down
the ugly tree, but you climbed right back
up to crash right back down again. Feed
the tree. 5 ) Conversely, if you have chosen
to live life large as a swingin' sassy sin
gle, you are beautiful. A real cutie, like
Paul. 6
Reflect upon this for a moment, if you
will. Think of your parents. Long term
commitment means ugly. The longer,
the uglier. It's not for naught that so
few Stanford folks engage in relation
ships. They are trying to conserve their
beauty. So despair no longer, ye of lone
ly nights and battery-powered friends,
for you are the beautiful, the chosen
ones.
Perhaps you do not realize the power
ful consequences such a premise will
have once it reaches the world at large.
The self-esteems of the "I'm not quite

ready for a relationship" the world over
will rise dramatically. Productivity will
increase. The global recession will end.
Attendance at "Showgirls"" will drop.
Psychiatrists everywhere will have to do
something more useful." More important
ly, the endless debates about Ric Ocasek
and Pauleena whatever will be ended.
They're in a relationship. They're both
ugly. Case closed.
As Spiderman has taught us, with great
power comes great responsibility. Gains
such as these do not come without a price. If
this research were to slip out, people every
where would be fleeing relationships in the
attempt to become more beautiful. Yes, even
gcKxl ol' Aunt Phyllis 10 and Uncle Gilbert
might get a divorce if they thought they had
any chance at good nookie elsewhere, and
then where would you be? I'll tell you where
- you'd no longer be gettin' individually
wrapped brownies for your birthday" cuz
Aunt Phyllis would be living it up with some
young stallion 12 in Palm Beach.
What we're talking about here are
good, old-fashioned family values. 13 It's
not without design that I use the phrase
"good ol' " far too often, for it is symbolic
of the entire moral fabric of our society
which is put at risk. What we have here is
just another searing example of research
gone awry. First the sensory deprivation
chamber 14 and now this. Where will it
end? If this is the world we live in, then
I, for one, will have no part in it.

Rand and Jon have been busy giving
high-fives, flashing peace signs, playing
piano, flicking cigarettes and sticking
one hand in their pockets. God, we hate
that song. We really hate that song.
