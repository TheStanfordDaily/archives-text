The Daily's responsibilty extends to ads

WE, THE UNDERSIGNED med
ical students, strongly object
to The Daily's decision to print
a 12-page anti-abortion "advertising
supplement" from Human Life Alliance
of Minnesota, Inc. in the Oct. 17 edi
tion of The Daily. We feel that by
accepting advertising like this supple
ment, The Daily is proselytizing misin
formation to our community.
First, legal, physician-provided abor
tion is among the safest surgical proce
dures, safer even than childbirth. The
list of risks from abortion in the sup
plement neglects to mention the fact
that less than one percent of abortions
result in important medical complica
tions. In fact, the risk of maternal
death from childbirth is about 11 times
as high as that from abortion (Alan
Guttmacher Institute, 1993). In addi-

tion, the supplement claims that
women who have abortions will have
difficulty conceiving or bearing chil
dren in the future. This is false (Cen
ters for Disease Control, 1985).
Second, illegal abortion was one of
the primary killers of young women
before the Roe v. Wade era and contin
ues to affect women today. Although
we will never know how many women
died due to botched "back-alley" abor
tions, many older physicians can attest
to the vast numbers of patients who
died from improperly performed abor
tions.
Abortive techniques used by non
physicians have included bloodletting,
violent purgatives, electricity and
douching with various toxins. Keeping
abortion legal is a public health issue.
From 1973 to 1985, the risk of mortali

ty from abortion dropped fivefold, from
3.4 per 100,000 to four per million.
Third, the human developmental
process (embryology) is seriously mis
represented by the Human Life
Alliance of Minnesota, Inc. Many of the
photos appear to be mislabeled â€” for
example, the "six-week embryo" inap
propriately has separate fingers and
toes and is missing its tail. The 21-day
embryo does not have a beating heart,
but rather has a single tube of cells
from which the heart will later develop.
The claim that "By 12 weeks, all organ
systems of [the fetal] body are func
tioning" is blatantly false. For exam
ple, the entire gut, from mouth to
anus, has not even been recanalized,
i.e., it is a solid cylinder of cells.
Fourth, the behavioral problems
described as "Post-Abortion Syn-

drome" are misleading at best. The list
of behavioral problems associated with
post-abortion described by this publica
tion fails to state that these psychologi
cal issues do not solely surround abor
tion. The claim that high percentages
of women who undergo abortion are
sexually inhibited, experience inability
to communicate and experience fre
quent crying could also apply to women
who undergo childbirth (post-partum
depression) or adoption.
In conclusion, we ask that The Daily
investigate the verity of claims made
by its advertisers in order to avoid
devoting such a large amount of adver
tising space to misleading and poten
tially damaging propaganda.
