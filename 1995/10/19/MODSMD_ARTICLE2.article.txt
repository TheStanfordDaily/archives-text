# Suspect's avowal coerced?
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
An allegedly coerced confes
sion from one of the men accused
of killing Stanford graduate stu
dent David Liu last fall has com
plicated the homicide investiga
tion.
Liu was shot in the back and
killed during an armed robbery
in East Palo Alto on Nov. 13,
1994. The investigation has been
ongoing ever since.
Two weeks ago, a confession
by 22-year-old Eddy Jay Pereles,
one of the men accused, led to the
arrest of his alleged accomplice,
Larry "Moon" Paul. But the San
Jose Mercury News reported last
week that Pereles had been co
erced into confessing after Palo
Alto Police Detective Michael
Yore threatened to handcuff the
suspect to a billboard and let
"Pereles' enemies" use him for
target practice.
When asked by The Daily if
the confession was tainted, how
ever, Yore said only, "that's just
the Mercury News being unin
formed."
Public Defender Craig
Kennedy wants the confession
thrown out as evidence that a
judge or jury would hear in court.
A case against Pereles and Paul
would be weakened without the
confession.
Kennedy could not be reached
for comment.

Liu, a 24-year-old graduate stu
dent in product design, was killed
as he walked toward an apartment
complex in East Palo Alto to visit
some friends. Although he had a
black belt in tae kwon do, Liu was
unable to fend off his attackers.
He died half an hour later at Stan
ford Medical Center.
According to the Mercury
News, Kennedy said that Yore, in

a later police report "admitted he
discussed billboards." Pereles was
questioned by Yore and fellow
officers for almost seven hours,
Kennedy said.
According to his client,
Kennt'dy told the Mercury News,
Pereles at first denied involve
ment with Liu's death, but after
the tape recorder was turned off,
Yore began another conversation
with Pereles. The tape recorder
was turned back on to record the
confession, according to Kennedy
in the Mercury News.
Kennedy asked Santa Clara

County Municipal Court Judge
Douglas Southard to review
Yore's file for any reports or com
plaints in his personnel file about
other incidents of forceful coer
cion. Southard said there was
nothing "even close" to suggest
previous complaints about
threats, according to the Mercury
News.
Pereles and Paul have their
next court hearing on Nov. 9.
Yore said that the two suspects
have also been charged with four
other armed robberies, which will
be heard in court soon.
