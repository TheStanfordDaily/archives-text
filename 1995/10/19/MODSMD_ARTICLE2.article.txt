# Suspect's avowal coerced?
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
An allegedly coerced confes
sion from one of the men accused
of killing Stanford graduate stu
dent David Liu last fall has com
plicated the homicide investiga
tion.
Liu was shot in the back and
killed during an armed robbery
in East Palo Alto on Nov. 13,
1994. The investigation has been
ongoing ever since.
Two weeks ago, a confession
by 22-year-old Eddy Jay Pereles,
one of the men accused, led to the
arrest of his alleged accomplice,
Larry "Moon" Paul. But the San
Jose Mercury News reported last
week that Pereles had been co
erced into confessing after Palo
Alto Police Detective Michael
Yore threatened to handcuff the
suspect to a billboard and let
"Pereles' enemies" use him for
target practice.
When asked by The Daily if
the confession was tainted, how
ever, Yore said only, "that's just
the Mercury News being unin
formed."
Public Defender Craig
Kennedy wants the confession
thrown out as evidence that a
judge or jury would hear in court.
A case against Pereles and Paul
would be weakened without the
confession.
Kennedy could not be reached
for comment.
