# Don't infuse Simpson verdict with irrelevant symbolism
## 
### 
In the few spare moments I had this
week between recruiting Hitler Youth and
tattooing pentagrams on my stomach, I
read three letters in The Daily responding
to t he letter I wrote last week regarding
the trial of former USC star running back
and current victimhood poster-boy, O.J.
Simpson.
In the first of these letters, Mikel Jollett
continues to miss the same point he missed
in his original article — the trial was al)out
Simpson. As I said before, the social issues
relating to the trial are important, but they
are peripheral. The trial was not about
them. Kive-hundred years of history can be
put on trial in the grape-hating, quota-fill
ing halls of Stanford University and simi
lar bastions of voguish, intellectual fanta
sy, but they cannot be put on trial in the
real world. (If you think Stanford is a
reflection of reality, consider, for example,
what percentage of the Stanford communi
ty supported Proposition 187 versus what

percentage of California supported it. If
you like, consider the number of Marxists
employed by the University versus the
number of Marxists employed by Solomon
Brothers.) Out there, in that world beyond
the 94309 zip code, where every other per
son you pass does not sing a cappella, only
Simpson — and not the weight of history
— was put to trial.
In the second letter, Marcella White —
aside from showcasing the reason why the
University has a freshman writing require
ment — states that I oversimplified the
trial by not placing it in its proper context,
i.e. 400 or 500 years of black oppression (in
her confusion, she uses different numbers
in different paragraphs). She also explains
that I ignored "the events leading up to the
Kodney King trial" (she probably means
the trial of the four officers accused of
beating King) in my assessment. She then
speaks of slave labor provided by a "race
taught to hate itself" and conveys some
supposedly meaningful personal anecdote
about a game her mother played as a child.
Unfortunately, all this has nothing to do
with Simpson getting a knife and butcher

ing two innocent people. This was a trial
about Simpson, not a Spike I>ee movie.
In today's society, especially within
academia, hopping the victim hood band
wagon brings with it a great many perks —
big-screen televisions in your campus eth
nic center, for example. Ms. White seems to
be acutely aware of Simpson's chum to vic
timhood and makes this the focus of her
letter. At some point however, even victims
as lowly and oppressed as Simpson have to
drop the victimhood crutch and accept
responsibility for themselves.
In the fmal letter, Greg Siegel states
that he is "partly shocked and partly
ashamed" bv my "incredibly insensitive
treatment" of minorities' problems. He
takes issue with my referring to "urban
black neighborhoods" as "slums" and
"ghettos" and calling Simpon's jury of
Rodney King's peers "12 inner-city
dullards." As to the shock and shame, I
suppose it is what happens when a shiny,
happy Stanford type hears an alternative
point of view. Lighten up, Mr. Siegel, there
are Republicans at Stanford.
With respect to the "downright igno-

rant and insulting" language I used, I
point to the days before mass hyphenation,
before the gilded prattle of hypersensitive
euphemism flooded into universities, when
what we know today as an "urban black
neighborhood" was actually called a "ghet
to.'' In places that are far from Stanford, it
Ls still called a "ghetto" even today. We can
sugarcoat the language ad nauseam, but
that will not change the unique character
of an "urban black neighborhood."
And sis for the jurors, you can be the
judge. You know what evidence they saw
and what conclusion they reached. You
know how Johnnie Cochran tailored his
closing statement. ("If the glove does not
fit, then you must acquit" was not aimed
at Ph.D. candidates.) And in case you don't
know, there are not many high school
diplomas floating around between the 12
of them.
Simpson killed two people last year and
is now playing golf in Florida because his
jury opted to judge "the system" rather
than judge him.
