St. Mary's 1

It wasn't pretty, but the Stan
ford women's soccer team (10-3
overall, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
got the job done yesterday after
noon in a 2-1 victory over St.
Mary's (5-8-1) at Moraga, Calif.
The eighth-ranked Cardinal
took advantage of first-half scores
from junior defender Suzie Boots
and senior midfielder Carmel
Murphy to overpower the Gaels,
despite surrendering the first goal
scored by St. Mary's in five games.
"I think we lost concentration
a little bit," said senior defender
Jessica Fischer. "We scored two in
the first half, but we needed to
keep putting it away. A two-goal
lead really isn't enough. They
score once, and all of a sudden,
you're fighting for your life."
Stanford drew first blood 15
minutes, 35 seconds into the match
when Boots took a corner kick
from senior midfielder Dena Dey
and headed it into the St. Mary's

net. Murphy added to the lead at
27:02 with an unassisted shot past
Gael goalkeeper Sylvia Keller.
St. Mary's finally enjoyed an
end to its four-game scoring
drought 14 minutes into the sec
ond half when Leslie Smith took a
lead pass from senior midfielder
Kim Donohue and deposited it in
the Cardinal net, just out of the
reach of Cardinal goalie Erin
Bryla. The goal was the Gaels'
first score since a 4-0 victory over
Pepperdine on Oct. 1.
In the end, though, Smith's
goal was for naught, as the Cardi
nal defense held on for the final
30 minutes of the match to secure
the 2-1 victory. The rest of St.
Mary's second-half shots sailed
just high or wide.
As Fischer noted, despite out
shooting the Gaels 16-7, Stanford
was plagued by an inability to put
the game out of reach, a problem
which has haunted the women all
season.
"We're satisfied with a win,"
said freshman midfielder Char
maine Leßlanc, "but we really
should have put away more of our
chances. You could tell that our
legs were tired out there. I think
fatigue has really been a factor.
We've been practicing hard, and
with school and midterms, it's

been hard trying to achieve some
type of balance."
With St. Mary's behind them,
the Cardinal women can now
begin to concentrate almost exclu
sively on their Pac-10 schedule.
Five of their remaining six games
come against conference oppo
nents, including this weekend's
home matches versus downstate
rivals USC and UCLA.
St. Mary's, meanwhile, contin
ues to find itself in a dizzying tail
spin. Yesterday's loss marked the
team's fifth consecutive defeat,
four of which have come at the
hands of top-10 teams. In the past
two weeks {done, the Gaels have
fallen prey to top-ranked North
Carolina, No. 2 Portland, No. 4
Southern Methodist and now
Stanford. After starting the sea
son 4-0-1, St. Mary's has now lost
eight of its last nine matches to
drop to 5-8-1. The Gaels will face
No. 7 Santa Clara next.
Stanford, on the other hand,
takes a three-game winning
streak into this weekend's Pac-10
contests. The Cardinal faces off
against the Trojans and Bruins on
Friday and Sunday, respectively.
"Everybody seemed a little
fatigued today," Bryla said, "but
we'll definitely be geared up for
this weekend."
