# Sailors search for balanced attack at the Stanford Invite
## 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
The sailing center on the hay will host one of
Stanford's largest home regattas this weekend, as
Pacific teams from as near as San Jose and as far
as San Diego converge on Redwood City for the
Stanford Invite. Beginning on Saturday at 11:00
a.m., both varsity and junior varsity teams will set
sail in hopes of a top-two finish.
The two most important teams sailing for the
Cardinal are those which will race in Division A
and Division B. "Most likely, |senior| John Meade
and [sophomore] Heather Rogers will be sailing
Division A," said head coach Steve Bourdow 'But
I might do some switching around. I think I might
mix in [sophomore] Betsy Carmichael with John
as well. We'll see how it goes."
Senior captain Adam Lowry and junior Mara
Holian will compete in Division B. Regardloss of
the distinction between the two divisions, perfor
mances in one will affect the other. Stanford's
final placing will be determined by combining the
results of each division.
"We need to have two strong teams," Bourdow
said. "If we are weak in one, regardless of how high
the other placed, our final finish will suffer
because of it."
Each remaining team member is likely to sail in
the junior varsity portion of the regatta. Bourdow
looks forward to seeing how sophomores l'liil Bar
row and Dave Thomas will fare after missing out
on the opportunity to head east to the Naval

It is now even more important
for us to be in the top two, at
the least, in our varsity division
and top-five in JV. '

Academy last weekend.
"I also think Steve Kleha and Adrienne Stoltz
have a good shot at placing well in -IV," Bourdow
said. "They are by far two of our most promising
freshmen
Junior Alice Manard will not sail in the Invite.
Instead, she will head up to the University of Ore
gon to compete in the Women's Singlehanded
Nationals.
The Cardinal feels it must place well this week
end, especially after its finish last weekend at the
Naval Academy. "It is now even more important
for us to be in the top two, at the least, in our var
sity division and top-five in JV," Bourdow said.
"With the home advantage, I am confident we can
achieve this."
Fourth-ranked California and 12t,h-ranked
USC will present Stanford with stiff competition.
However, with the right conditions and home
advantage, Stanford's sailors may still emerge vic
torious.
