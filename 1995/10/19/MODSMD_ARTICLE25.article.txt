Stanford women's crew coach Aimee Baker
did not exaggerate when she commented on
her team's upcoming race in Cambridge,
Mass. On Sunday, the Cardinal will l>egin its
season on a large scale by racing in the Head of
Charles, one of the most well-known races in
the country. With only three weeks of train
ing, and no prior regattas, the Cardinal will be
a month behind its primary competitors, Ivy
Leaguers Harvard, Yale and Brown.

The team will use the event as a way to look
at possible recruits and as a preview of the
upcoming season. VVbile Stanford's perfor
mance in future races will prove more critical,
the Hoad of Charles could sot the tone for the
entire season. "It'll give us a good showing of
wbere we stand from a national perspective,"
said senior captain Julie Lewczyk.
Eight rowers and a coxswain will travel to
Massachusetts for tbe competition. The deter
mined lineup, which has been training togeth
er since last Saturday, includes Lewczyk, co
term Kara Johnson, senior Cara Rice, juniors
Jennifer Brown and Maria Klemp^rer-John

son and Andra Pligavko, sophomores Kather
ine Greig and Anona Dutton as well as sopho
more coxswain Katherine Bostick. The boat
has some maturity to it this year, with all but
three of the rowers attending the race for at
least the second time in their rowing careers.
This time around, the Cardinal hopes to
place in the top 10. With the competition nt
the Head of Charles, an appearance in the top
10 would indicate that Stanford boasts a very
strong team.
"I think we have a lot more potential as a
boat this year," Brown said. "It should go real
ly well."
"It's a big first step."
