### Laura Drum Contributing writer 
With its first race already in
the record books, Stanford men's
crew now prepares for the Head of
Charles, one of the nation's most
prominent and competitive regat
tas. In this approximately 20-
minute long race, which will take
place on Sunday at Harvard, the
Cardinal will face off against some
of the strongest teams nationally
and internationally, including
Harvard, Yale, Cornell and some
European national teams. Col
leges across the country send
their best to this race, which takes
place on the Charles River sepa
rating Boston from Cambridge,
Mass.
"This is the biggest regatta in
the world in terms of participa
tion and competition," said head
coach Wieslaw Kujda.

guishes the Head of Charles from
other regattas. Unlike most crew
competitions, fans will crowd the
sides of the Charles River to cheer
the boats on as they row. Their
presence, something the Cardinal
rarely experiences, could height
en the team's motivation.
"[The fans) keep you pumped
up when you're rowing out
there," said senior rower Barrett
Adams. Adams will participate in
the race for the third time in his
career.
The determining factors of the
Cardinal's performance in the

Head of Charles will be its enthu
siasm and teamwork. The team
already proved its capabilities last
week in an excellent outing
against California. Now the eight
man team, comprised of seniors
Barrett Adams, Jason Hool,
Grant Dawson and Rob Bigler,
juniors Tor Lundgren and Matt
Miller and sophomores Jason
MacQuarrie and Matt Jolly, as
well as senior coxswain Eva Kim,
will have a chance to demonstrate
its talent in the national arena.
Having completed only three
weeks of practice, the Cardinal
faces the challenge of coming
together for the Boston race.
"The number one factor that
makes the boat go is teamwork,"
Kujda said. "It's very hard to

blend individuality and team
work."
Barrett Adams expressed con
fidence in his team, however.
"We're building team spirit," he
said. "It comes with races."
This year will not be Stan
ford's first appearance in the
Head of Charles. In the past, the
Cardinal has fared well in the
competition, although there is
always room for improvement.
The team hopes to fare better
than last year and hopefully
break its best performance of sev
enth collegiately and 11th overall,
which occurred three years ago.
"There's a different attitude
this year than last year," Kim
said. "[This year,] there's a real
belief in the boat."
