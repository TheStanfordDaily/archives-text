# Field hockey to take no prisoners against budding club teams

### Alda Leu Staff writer 
After crushing Pacific last
week, Stanford field hockey
(6-4 overall, 4-1 Northern
Pacific Conference) should
encounter few problems this
weekend at the Cal Invita
tional.
The Cardinal will play
Santa Clara and UC-Davis,
which are club teams. Consid
ering that field hockey has
been a sport at Stanford since
1919, the Broncos and the
Aggies have a lot to learn
from Stanford in terms of
both skill and tradition. The
two teams are still in the pro
cess of developing their pro
grams and have not yet
attained varsity status.
The Cal Invitational is not
a tournament, in the strict
sense of the word. No awards
will be given out, and the best
two teams will not play for a
prize. Rather, the event pro
vides an opportunity to play
more field hockey with local
teams. The Invitational will
also include California and
HOP, although Stanford will
not face them.
The Cardinal will face
Santa Clara on Saturday
afternoon in Kleeberger Sta
dium in Berkeley. The match
will take place at 2:30 p.m.

Sunday. Stanford will chal
lenge the Aggies at 11:00
a.m., also at Berkeley.
The three-team NorPac
Conference, consisting of Cal,
Pacific and Stanford, eagerly
awaits the arrival of Davis
and Santa Clara, and one
more pending team — Santa
Barbara — to fill out the divi
sion. "[The clubs] nre having

more trouble organizing,"
Cardinal coach Sheryl John
son said.
According to senior tri-cap
tain Jennifer Glueck, finan
cial considerations contribute
to the delay. "The clubs don't
have enough money to be fully
funded varsity sports," she
said.
