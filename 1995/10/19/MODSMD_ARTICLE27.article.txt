# Field hockey to take no prisoners against budding club teams
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
After crushing Pacific last
week, Stanford field hockey
(6-4 overall, 4-1 Northern
Pacific Conference) should
encounter few problems this
weekend at the Cal Invita
tional.
The Cardinal will play
Santa Clara and UC-Davis,
which are club teams. Consid
ering that field hockey has
been a sport at Stanford since
1919, the Broncos and the
Aggies have a lot to learn
from Stanford in terms of
both skill and tradition. The
two teams are still in the pro
cess of developing their pro
grams and have not yet
attained varsity status.
The Cal Invitational is not
a tournament, in the strict
sense of the word. No awards
will be given out, and the best
two teams will not play for a
prize. Rather, the event pro
vides an opportunity to play
more field hockey with local
teams. The Invitational will
also include California and
HOP, although Stanford will
not face them.
The Cardinal will face
Santa Clara on Saturday
afternoon in Kleeberger Sta
dium in Berkeley. The match
will take place at 2:30 p.m.

Sunday. Stanford will chal
lenge the Aggies at 11:00
a.m., also at Berkeley.
The three-team NorPac
Conference, consisting of Cal,
Pacific and Stanford, eagerly
awaits the arrival of Davis
and Santa Clara, and one
more pending team — Santa
Barbara — to fill out the divi
sion. "[The clubs] nre having

'Even though they
have potential,
they are not up to
the standards of
UOPor Cal.'
— Jennifer Glueck

more trouble organizing,"
Cardinal coach Sheryl John
son said.
According to senior tri-cap
tain Jennifer Glueck, finan
cial considerations contribute
to the delay. "The clubs don't
have enough money to be fully
funded varsity sports," she
said.
Stanford has vet to face
Davis or Santa Clara this year,
but expects the matchup to be
less than challenging.
Last year, Stanford handed
the Aggies 5-1 and 3-0 defeats.
Stanford also shut out the Bron
cos twice in 1994, posting scores
of 11-0 each time.
"Even though they have
potential, they are not up to the
standard of UOP or Cal,"
Glueck said in reference to
Davis and Santa Clara. "They
don't have their programs built
up yet."
The Cardinal isn't quite com
plete for this weekend's con
tests. Senior midfielder Elise
Morgan may return this week
end, but junior Boachi Nguyen
is still injured.
However, despite injuries to
key players, the depth of this
year's Cardinal sqaud leaves lit
tle worry.
"The freshmen have really
been able to step right on the
team, and although there is core
leadership, they are a core to the
team," Glueck said.
Stanford will likely dominate
both games, using them to per
fect its skills and prepare for the
confrontation with California
next week.
"We're focusing on gearing
up for (next) Tuesday's game,"
Glueck said. She called the Cal
Invitational "a really good confi
dence booster" for the team.
