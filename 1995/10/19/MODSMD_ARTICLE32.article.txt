# grub Focus on: Evvia Estiatorio
## 
### David Smolen 
Don't expect to get a table weekend nights
at Ewia before 10:30 p.m. if you haven't
made reservations well in advance. Once
you've been inside and enjoyed the dining ex
perience at this cozy, upscale Greek taverna,
you'll understand why.
From the moment you walk in, Ewia's
homey surroundings exude a comfortable
feeling and invite the diner to enjoy. The
front of the restaurant is one large folding
paneled wall, which, when opened, lends the
locale an immediate Mediterranean feel. The
open spaces afford the front tables a view of
the evening's parade of revelers strolling
along Emerson Street between University
and Lytton. And if the open-air feel doesn't
win you over, then the fresh cut flowers
arranged in beautiful bouquets throughout

the restaurant most certainly will.
A large working brick fireplace lies in wait
for the chilly evenings of fall and winter to
spark it into action. The small bar tucked into
the corner contributes to the tavema feel of
Ewia with its neatly stacked bottles of Greek
and California wines in the overhead wine
racks and its 10 varieties of ouzo (Greek
liqueur flavored with anise) in ordered rows.
Rustic copper cookwarc, brightly painted ce
ramic and weathered wine barrels are dis
played on shelves ringing the restaurant. A
wall has been carved out to expose the busy
kitchen's mesquite grill and rotisserie spit.
The row of intimate tables-for-two in the
back is framed by a back-lit wall of variously
colored, bottled olive oils containing herbs
and spices such as rosemary and garlic. This
traditional method of seasoning olive oil,
done in very non-traditional bold and con
trasting colors, achieves a lava-lamp look
while at the same time quite improbably
adding to the restaurant's timeless feel.
The campy retro bottles of seasoned olive
oil might well serve as a metaphor for Ewia
— traditional Greek with a noticeably con
temporary California accent. The name is
taken from the Greek isle on which two of the
restaurant's four owners, George and Judy
Marcus, were born. Executive Chef Peter
Casartelli is enthusiastic about the fusion of
ancient Greece and modern California: "The
heart of the menu is from Ewia, but it has a
creative (California twist to it."
F.wia is one restaurant where you won't
want to pass up the appetizers, even if it
means splitting an entree later in your din

ner. This menu boasts eleven tantalizing ap
petizers, not including soups or salads. Some
of the appetizers, like the kalamarakia (crispy
calamari served with garlic sauce and fresh
lemon, $5.95) and the feta and olives (sprin
kled with herbs and extra-virgin olive oil,
$3.95), can be found in any number of
restaurants. You may want, instead, to sam
ple from the delicious stuffed filo offerings
— spanakopitu (spinach, feta and herbs,
$4.95) or tiropita (Greek cheese and ricotta).
1 wouldn't pass up the dolmathes, grape
leaves stuffed with rice and herbs, served
with homemade pita and fresh purees —
hummus, eggplant, and cucumber ($6.95).
What Greek menu would be complete
without the classic Greek salad? This was the
only item in the soup and salad section that
caught our eye, and it was easily large enough
for two of us to split (vine-ripened tomatoes,
cucumbers, radishes, red onion, seasoned
with herbs and topped with feta, $7.50). The
entree selection is varied and enticing. Every
night Casartelli prepares a different fresh fish
grilled whole over mesquite charcoal
($14.25). The moussaka Ls a delicately sea
soned, yet hearty baked casserole dish with
thin strips of eggplant, a generous helping of
lamb ragout and a light bechamel with a hint
of nutmeg ($12.50). The most interesting
looking dish on the menu, octapodi pilafi
(octopus risotto with tomato, rosemary and
shallots, $ 10.95), turned out to be a mild dis
appointment due to an overpowering toma
to sauce that rendered the rice and octopus as
nothing more than interesting texture.
On both visits to Ewia, the wait staff was

extremely helpful in selecting items from tht
menu. Attentive and good-natured, they take
the time necessary to help you navigate the
menu and put together an excellent dinner
Ewia even encourages dinner parties to share
entrees family style.
If certain items on the menu look like they
belong at II Fornaio (makaroni anginares —
capellini with artichokes, tomatoes, fresh
basil and olive oil, $9.50; kota souvlas — hall
free-range roasted chicken with lemon
oregano potatoes, $11.95), you'll have to go
back in time for the answer. Co-owner Dr.
Ken Frangadakis says, "We've been harvest
ing from the same back yard and fishing from
the same sea as the Italians for centuries."
A great place for all kinds of outings, few
places make you feel more comfortable while
enjoying a first-rate dinner. Ironically
enough, this charm might very well be
Ewia's downfall. The wait staff may soon
have to learn how to politely ask dinner
guests to leave after their third hour of con
versation, while the party with reservations
for a table waits impatiently at the door.

leaves stuffed with rice and herbs, served
with homemade pita and fresh purees —
hummus, eggplant, and cucumber ($6.95).
What Greek menu would be complete
without the classic Greek salad? This was the
only item in the soup and salad section that
caught our eye, and it was easily large enough
for two of us to split (vine-ripened tomatoes,
cucumbers, radishes, red onion, seasoned
with herbs and topped with feta, $7.50). The
entree selection is varied and enticing. Every
night Casartelli prepares a different fresh fish
grilled whole over mesquite charcoal
($14.25). The moussaka Ls a delicately sea
soned, yet hearty baked casserole dish with
thin strips of eggplant, a generous helping of
lamb ragout and a light bechamel with a hint
of nutmeg ($12.50). The most interesting
looking dish on the menu, octapodi pilafi
(octopus risotto with tomato, rosemary and
shallots, $ 10.95), turned out to be a mild dis
appointment due to an overpowering toma
to sauce that rendered the rice and octopus as
nothing more than interesting texture.
On both visits to Ewia, the wait staff was

extremely helpful in selecting items from tht
menu. Attentive and good-natured, they take
the time necessary to help you navigate the
menu and put together an excellent dinner
Ewia even encourages dinner parties to share
entrees family style.
If certain items on the menu look like they
belong at II Fornaio (makaroni anginares —
capellini with artichokes, tomatoes, fresh
basil and olive oil, $9.50; kota souvlas — hall

oregano potatoes, $11.95), you'll have to go

the same sea as the Italians for centuries."
A great place for all kinds of outings, few
places make you feel more comfortable while
enjoying a first-rate dinner. Ironically
enough, this charm might very well be
Ewia's downfall. The wait staff may soon

guests to leave after their third hour of con
versation, while the party with reservations
for a table waits impatiently at the door.

Don't expect to get a table weekend nights
at Ewia before 10:30 p.m. if you haven't
made reservations well in advance. Once
you've been inside and enjoyed the dining ex
perience at this cozy, upscale Greek taverna,
you'll understand why.
From the moment you walk in, Ewia's
homey surroundings exude a comfortable
feeling and invite the diner to enjoy. The
front of the restaurant is one large folding
paneled wall, which, when opened, lends the
locale an immediate Mediterranean feel. The
open spaces afford the front tables a view of
the evening's parade of revelers strolling
along Emerson Street between University
and Lytton. And if the open-air feel doesn't
win you over, then the fresh cut flowers
arranged in beautiful bouquets throughout

the restaurant most certainly will.
A large working brick fireplace lies in wait
for the chilly evenings of fall and winter to
spark it into action. The small bar tucked into
the corner contributes to the tavema feel of
Ewia with its neatly stacked bottles of Greek
and California wines in the overhead wine
racks and its 10 varieties of ouzo (Greek
liqueur flavored with anise) in ordered rows.
Rustic copper cookwarc, brightly painted ce
ramic and weathered wine barrels are dis
played on shelves ringing the restaurant. A
wall has been carved out to expose the busy
kitchen's mesquite grill and rotisserie spit.
The row of intimate tables-for-two in the
back is framed by a back-lit wall of variously
colored, bottled olive oils containing herbs
and spices such as rosemary and garlic. This
traditional method of seasoning olive oil,
done in very non-traditional bold and con
trasting colors, achieves a lava-lamp look
while at the same time quite improbably
adding to the restaurant's timeless feel.
The campy retro bottles of seasoned olive
oil might well serve as a metaphor for Ewia
— traditional Greek with a noticeably con
temporary California accent. The name is
taken from the Greek isle on which two of the
restaurant's four owners, George and Judy
Marcus, were born. Executive Chef Peter
Casartelli is enthusiastic about the fusion of
ancient Greece and modern California: "The
heart of the menu is from Ewia, but it has a
creative (California twist to it."
F.wia is one restaurant where you won't
want to pass up the appetizers, even if it
means splitting an entree later in your din

ner. This menu boasts eleven tantalizing ap
petizers, not including soups or salads. Some
of the appetizers, like the kalamarakia (crispy
calamari served with garlic sauce and fresh
lemon, $5.95) and the feta and olives (sprin
kled with herbs and extra-virgin olive oil,
$3.95), can be found in any number of
restaurants. You may want, instead, to sam
ple from the delicious stuffed filo offerings
— spanakopitu (spinach, feta and herbs,
$4.95) or tiropita (Greek cheese and ricotta).
