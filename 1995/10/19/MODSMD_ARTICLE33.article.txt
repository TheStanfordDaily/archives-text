I did it.
It was my first time, and since it didn't real
ly click, 1 didn't really hit the mark, so it looks
like I'll be doing it again soon.
I took the GREs.
A ilJth century students rite of passage is
somehow suddenly inexorably linked to an
acronym whereby he or she is locked in a room,
questioned for eight hours and denied food,
drink or bathroom. Based on the answers to this
inquisition, the future of that student is decided.
It sounds like a bad Franz Kafka novel, but
it's not.
So there I was, having been assigned to an
abandoned high school in San Francisco in the
third stages of decomposition, blurry-eyed
and fuzzy-mouthed, armed with only my No.

2 pencils (which, in the ineffable Stanford
Bookstore logic, cost a full $2 more per dozen
than No. 2.5 pencils).
It was not an unbiased estimate of my intel
ligence, nor was it a measure of my accom
plishment in college. If Joe fills the ditch in five
minutes and Bob does it in 10, how long will it
take both of them to dig the ditch? Fley, what if
I hypothctically spent last summer digging
ditches in Uruguay and know that it takes at
least an hour to fill a ditch?
"If A, then B, if not B, then not A" is not the
Golden Rule. What I've learned in college, on
the contrary, is directly in conflict with the fal
lacious logical presumptions. Yes, sometimes
A is A and not A at the same time, and the
open-mindedness to accept incongruity,

anomaly, paradox and deviation is one of my
mind's greatest attributes.
Not to mention the fact that the reading
comprehension section completely discounts
modern phenomcnological reader-response
criticism, which absolutely privileges the read
er. The reading can be colored by my culture,
my gender, even my current mood. Therefore,
I can interpret the reading any damn way I
please, thank you, and it is valid and vibrant
and viable. So don't tell me it's A if I think it's B.
So I left the test a wizened, weakened ver
sion of my former self. The sun swung over the
sky (the arc of which would be equal to the
angle of which I make the focal point) and I
lost a day. A day I could have spent at the foot
ball game, cavorting in San Francisco, reading

on the beach. In short, I could be a better per
son today because I made the effort yesterday.
Instead, I am a bitter person, and recorded on
my transcript are arbitrary numbers that can
not describe me the way my professors would,
my parents would or my friends would.
This all functions as a very convenient ex
cuse, mind you, for when my scores come back
deficient (which they probably won't). This is a
convenient excuse for not getting into gradu
ate school (which I probably will, somewhere),
this is a convenient excuse for consoling my
friends (some will need consolation, I'm sure)
and this is a convenient excuse for my abuse of
alcohol after the test.
Yeah, I took the GREs, and I have the hang
over to prove it.
I did it.
