# Through the Looking Glass: Chihuly's Glass Dreamscape
## 
### Kristie Lu Stout 
Surveying the exhibit halls two days before
his opening, Dale Chihuly takes a closer
look at an acrylic work on display, a paint
ed blueprint ot one of his glass sculptures.
Brushing his long corkscrew ringlets away from
his pudgy face, ('.hihuly unifocally scrutinizes
the painting with the one eye spared from a 1976
auto accident.
1 le squints. 1 le takes a meditative moment to
ponder. I le smiles. 1 le proceeds to rip the paint
ing off the museum wall.
"See? Velcro!" says a delighted C '.hihuly to an
astounded assortment of journalists and muse
um guards. "They Velcro it on the wall!"
(".hihuly, an internationally acclaimed glass
artist, is a man in love with details. Not only
does he pause to acknowledge the Velcro that
affixes his acrylic blueprints to the museum
wall, he takes time to recognize the tiny orna
mental glass knickknacks that hide in the folds
of his gigantic glass parasols, to redesign the ex
hibit's lighting again and again to ensure maxi
mum exposure for his works and even to apply
sinuous streams of Day-Glow paint to his once
nondescript pair of black comfort
_ shoes.

Heart of glass
After receiving a Master of Fine Arts from
the Rhode Island School of Design, ( hihuly was
honored with a Fulbright Fellowship to study at
the Venin Factory on the island of Murano in
Venice, Italy — the first American ever invited
to study glass blowing there. I pon his return to
the United States, he founded the international
ly known Pilchuck (ilass School near Seattle.
(".hihuly's critically acclaimed glass work has
been exhibited all over the world, including
such spaces as the Musee des Arts I)ecoratifs in
the Palais du Louvre, the Metropolitan Muse
um of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New
York and now in the San Jose Museum of Art,
where his "Installations: 1%4 1995" will run
until Jan. 21.
hasn't blown a piece of glass since his
car accident. Since glass blowing commands the
presence of full binocular vision, he can't execute
the three-dimensional demands of his craft on
his own. Although he relies on his

team of gaffers to do the blowing,
Chihuly remains a hands-on artist. It
may be another who blows the

glass into shape, but it is Chi
huly's artistic vision that
molds the molten
glass.

the glass work. \ie hovers i
over each piece as it is
being developed to direct
how the creation will blossom
forth.

Chihuly, passionate not only about
his glass creations but about how his
works will eventually be presented,
makes it a point to visit each museum
space firsthand. These visits are neces
sary for him to design the installation of
the exhibition for the particular muse
ums where it will be presented.
Upon visiting the recently expanded
San Jose Museum of Art, Chihuly was
delighted to encounter its tall barrel-

vaulted skylit central gallery. He has
used this museum space to showcase his

"Macchia Forest" collection, a splat
ter-painted forest of sky-reaching
glass tulips. I )ue to the height of the
y room, Chihuly was able to stretch
the height of the "Macchia" a few

extra feet. The resulting size
augmentation adds to the oth
erworldliness of his glassworks.
The huge glass tulips (some are
as large as four feet in diameter)
are not only monstrous in their
size but also in their towering
prominence.
A candied wonderland
Sauntering through a room
of towering glass flowers, visi
tors to the "Macchia" will expe
rience an altered reality where
glass loses its rigidity and in
stead adopts an organic fluidity
... where sand is transformed
into sinuous viber sized beings
who hover above your curiosi
ty-glazed eyes or feign stillness at
jr feet.
to the "Macchia" is Chihuly's
"Nijima Floats," a gargantuan
nest of lavishly encrusted glass
bubbles. Chihuly created this
ge installation pieceasa tribute to
ie Japanese fishing floats used by
fishermen to buoy their nets.
Quite unlike the objects they
refer to, the huge glass spheres of
"Nijima Floats" have an uncan
ny resemblance to hyper-inflat
ed balloons on the brink of a
collective burst. The shards of
glass that tickle the bottom of
each float seem to flirt with this
notion of impending explosion.
In one of the adjacent rooms
floats an overhead installation
ailed "IVrgola. Suspended a
little over six leet above the
floor, "Pergola is an eclectic as
semblage of random knick

died trinkets waiting to he discovered and be
held by the eyes of an accidental admirer, like
waiting conch shells freshly washed in from the
sea. Only a skin of clear glass separates this col
lection of bowls and cups and pretty playthings
from crashing onto the ceiling-fixed eyes of the
curious.
In another adjacent room dwells "Persian
Sea Forms," an ostensibly random assortment
of oozing glass plates with intricately detailed
tiny treasures tucked in their many folds. In its
entirety, "Persian Sea Forms" resembles a mag
nified sea shell — an object whose sinuous form
seems too perfect to be organic and yet too al
luring in its complexity to be man-made.
When asked to reveal the rationale behind
this arrangement's name, Chihuly failed to cel
ebrate the exotic and oceanic connotations of
the piece. He simply responded: "I don't know
why I use 'Persian.' I like the word."
One can't help but doubt whether or not
Dale Chihuly is fully aware of the impact his
works have upon the audience. During his
guided walk- through, the craftsman pontificat
ed on the process of glass blowing and the im
mediate visual sensations of his installation but
tailed to explain the resonance of the works.
Unlike television or other forms of immedi
ate visual sensation, "Chihuly's Installations"
does more than tickle the optic nerves and elic
it comparisons to recent acid trips. It imposes a
surreality on a material we take tor granted each
time we bring it to our lips to drink. In ( hihu
ly's world, glass is not only manipulated into
varying shapes, it is mutated into quivering bal
loons, monstrous petals and sea forms moist
with sensuality.
