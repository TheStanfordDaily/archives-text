THE SPINANES

About a year and a half has
passed since the Spinanes
opened for Liz Phair at the
Warfield, so the details seen and
heard from the band's perfor
mance that spring night aren't
sharply recollected. Camped in

the left-field corner of the sprawl
ing stage, singer / guitarist Re
becca Clates stood up front,
decked in the same greenish
dress familiar from publicity

shots, and behind her was
drummer Scott lMout, who may
or may not have donned the
shades he's often pictured wear
ing. There was definitely some
chatter about Kleenex between
the songs, which, of course, were

vaguely remarkable because the
Spinanes' music is in every case.
Though the sights and
sounds have faded away, something

of the Spinanes presence still lingers.
I ike, say, Nirvana, experiencing the
Spinanes live leaves one more dumb

founded and delighted than before
how do thex make so much noise, and
noise so wonderful .uul so powerful .it th.ii?

~ - — ~ r
What the heats and rifls actually sounded like
may be long forgotten, but the energy of
I'loufs rhythms and the frenzy with which
Ciates took on what seemed to be at least two
guitar parts are too lively to be dusty memo
ries.
I think there's a power that comes across
playing live that — and this is true of many
bands — that is just really hard to capture in
the studio," explains Ciates, numerous
months and gigs removed from the Warfield
show. "My theory, like I said, is that they're
two different experiences."
Speaking two weeks before this Saturday's
bill with Superchunk at the I illmore, Ciates
says she is busy preparing for a short tour as
an opener and is between recording and mix
ing the long-awaited follow-up to "Manos,"
the group's glorious 1993 debut LP. As is the
case with her music, she speaks succinctly
and frankly, her clear voice cutting to the
chase whether in song or interview. When
Ciates is addressed with an eager question
about a new album slated for release in Feb
ruary, her earnest, simple response tells noth

ing more or less than she knows; "It's hard to
talk about it 'cause it's not done yet," she
notes.
"1 think people have been like, 'Why the
hell has it taken you so long to get your next
record out?' " Gates points out. "Well, basi
cally, after our record came out, we were on
tour for 10 months straight, practically.
We're like anybody: If you work really hard
for a really long time, you don't want to do it
for a while. And we were in a position where
we could just take some time off and have a
life. As tar as I'm concerned, if I don't have a
life, 1 don't have anything to write about."
So perhaps Gates' unfiltered honesty ex
plains the indefinable attractiveness of the
Portland, OR / Olympia, WA, duo, more
stark in person and on stage hut just as grip
niny on recording. ("ertainlv it permeates the

Relying only on a sincere/re-

heartening response to it. From out of
nowhere, the Spinanes climbed to the top ot
the College Media Journal radio charts for
five weeks in early 1994, becoming the first
band on Sub Pop Records — the original
home to Nirvana and Soundgarden, and the
current imprint of faves like Sebadoh and Ve
locity Girl — to achieve a distinction usually
reserved for major-label commercial alterna
tive acts. An unexpected achievement for any
indie outfit, being No. 1 seemed all the more

"You know, the first record was a total sur

what we're gonna do. But that still doesn't

THE SPINANES

About a year and a half has
passed since the Spinanes
opened for Liz Phair at the
Warfield, so the details seen and
heard from the band's perfor
mance that spring night aren't
sharply recollected. Camped in

the left-field corner of the sprawl
ing stage, singer / guitarist Re
becca Clates stood up front,
decked in the same greenish
dress familiar from publicity

shots, and behind her was
drummer Scott lMout, who may
or may not have donned the
shades he's often pictured wear
ing. There was definitely some
chatter about Kleenex between
the songs, which, of course, were

vaguely remarkable because the
Spinanes' music is in every case.
Though the sights and
sounds have faded away, something

of the Spinanes presence still lingers.
I ike, say, Nirvana, experiencing the
Spinanes live leaves one more dumb

founded and delighted than before
how do thex make so much noise, and
noise so wonderful .uul so powerful .it th.ii?

~ - — ~ r
What the heats and rifls actually sounded like
may be long forgotten, but the energy of
I'loufs rhythms and the frenzy with which
Ciates took on what seemed to be at least two
guitar parts are too lively to be dusty memo
ries.
I think there's a power that comes across
playing live that — and this is true of many
bands — that is just really hard to capture in
the studio," explains Ciates, numerous
months and gigs removed from the Warfield
show. "My theory, like I said, is that they're
two different experiences."
Speaking two weeks before this Saturday's
bill with Superchunk at the I illmore, Ciates
says she is busy preparing for a short tour as
an opener and is between recording and mix
ing the long-awaited follow-up to "Manos,"
the group's glorious 1993 debut LP. As is the
case with her music, she speaks succinctly
and frankly, her clear voice cutting to the
chase whether in song or interview. When
Ciates is addressed with an eager question
about a new album slated for release in Feb
ruary, her earnest, simple response tells noth

ing more or less than she knows; "It's hard to
talk about it 'cause it's not done yet," she
notes.
"1 think people have been like, 'Why the
hell has it taken you so long to get your next
record out?' " Gates points out. "Well, basi
cally, after our record came out, we were on
tour for 10 months straight, practically.
We're like anybody: If you work really hard
for a really long time, you don't want to do it
for a while. And we were in a position where
we could just take some time off and have a
life. As tar as I'm concerned, if I don't have a
life, 1 don't have anything to write about."
So perhaps Gates' unfiltered honesty ex
plains the indefinable attractiveness of the
Portland, OR / Olympia, WA, duo, more
stark in person and on stage hut just as grip
niny on recording. ("ertainlv it permeates the

Relying only on a sincere/re-
