# YO LA TENGO
## 
### 
Having been stirred from his slumber by the sound of con
struction, Yo I,a Ten go singer / guitarist Ira Kaplan may not
be at his most alert. He calls from Cleveland the morning
after the first night of the band's second U.S. tour in the past six
months, tardy and apologizing for it in a patient, deep-toned voice.
Still, Kaplan is aware enough to realize he's being asked the same
question, just in different ways. No, not the incessantly oft-posed
queries about his former occupation as a rock critic or his marriage
to the group's singer/ drummer Georgia Hubley or the hackneyed
comparisons to the Velvet Underground. Though those topics are
touched on, its the talk of the conscious and unconscious in the
Hoboken, N.J., trios music that recurs — how ever subconsciously.
Kaplan brings it to the attention of his inquisitor, noting, "That's one
of your question styles, to say 'conscious effort.'
I was about to say most of what we do isn't a conscious effort," lie
says.
With or without an "un- modifying "conscious," any of the
common meanings ascribed to the words provides a window into
Yo La lengo. In one sense, Yo La Ten go songs straddle the line be
tween states of consciousness, both a blaring false alarm and a
sleepy whisper; the pieces arc substantial yet ethereal, fixed in con
crete reality while they drift in droning beauty. Which brings to
mind the other definition of conscious, the one that has to do with
knowing and recognition and intention as in, how much of the
bands absorbing, intricate music is spontaneous and how much
planned out?
I hat s the stumper which makes the band s latest album "I lectr-o-
Pura such a fascinating work, one ot seemingly complicated struc
tures yet full ol little ticks which accentuate the grand whole. The
album breaks through the dichotomy of thought and feeling, each
leeding off the other to create songs which are as heady as they are af
fecting. filled out by bassist lames McN'ew and his beguiling bass
lines, the threesome give form to hazy emot ion through the diversity
ot experience in and between the songs on I lectr-o-Pura," ranging
from loud, jittery rockers to calm, cascading melodies to warm ex
perimentation. Yet the vibe remains constant throughout, poignant
yet avoiding sentimentality, clever without smugness.
"Well, on this record particularly, most of them started with im
provisations at practice," Kaplan says of the band's first truly collab
orative full length effort. "And we were able to, hopefully, keep that
spirit fulh while we were recording, because we had a much longer
amount of time to record this record than we were used to having.
"We ended up learning so many songs that we — at a certain point,
we kind of subconsciously didn't learn them all the way through
when we recorded them. In quite a lew cases, we literally had to re
mind ourselves how they went. ... So I think the songs were still kind
of being hatted around to a great extent while we were recording.

Which ma) have provided that flavor.
Kaplan sa\ s that the album "gets described in ways that

are contradictory,' some hearing only the distortion
and others the quiet. If anything, those views only a

stress the variet\ ol the record as a whole, because
there is distortion and quiet and often at the same
time. "I-lecti o Pura" proves the most satisfying A

listen ol Yo I a Pengo's seven album, 10-year,
multiple bassist existence, a step further along
in the process ol molding disparate sound
into enchanting song than "Painful," the
group's excellent opus of 1993.
"false Alarm," with its impulsive bursts ol
siren-like guitar and organ punctuating the
scowl of Kaplan's abrasive vocals, reins in

nrisiiing noise io ueaie a complete package,
made all the more so when bracketed by the
dusky ditty "Paul Is Dead" before and the pon
derous "The Ballad of Red Buckets" after. Also

the conscious decision to highlight Georgia I lub-
ley's gorgeously unadorned singingadds texture and

contrast, her downcast monotone a smooth comple-
ment to Kaplan's mutable, more outgoing lead vox. The

voices fit together from the start, with the wispy "wo-o-o"
Huhley croons on the ruggedly melancholic opener "Decora"

giving way to the dry-throated ramhlings of Kaplan on "Flying Les
son," a cut with an ominous tone that simmers with a hint of Sonic

Youth.
Indeed, tracks flow from one
stream of (unconsciousness

musing to the next, hole
ing their own lyrical

without obscuring a
more general im
pact. When Hubley I
gently utters to
herself, "I haven't

you / any more" on

"Don't Say a Word,"
she's expressing herself

when she really isn't, a per
sonal moment all her own that

her audience can relate to at the same time. The bubbly pop tune
lom Courtcnay docs the same, its movie star namesake and the
school boyish first line — " Julie Christie / the rumors are true," Ka
plan chimes — in the opening as points of references that set the
mood without giving away the intimate details. Not only is it a mar
velous pop song, but a pop song about pop culture that's emotive and
not evasive.
I hat s a big part ot mv lile, all that stuff," explains Kaplan. "I
think, you know, it you can t use all these records and movies as ways
to illustrate personal feeling, then I've frittered away a lot of my life
on movies and records."
Reshaping its own songs also typifies Yo l a Tengo's open perspec
tive. 1 he recent release of the"Camp Vo I.a Tengo" HP features a fresh
take on lorn C.ourtenay,' stripped down to acoustic guitar and Nub
ley on vocals, and a leaner "Blue I ine Swinger." where Kaplan says the
band found the three minute song in the heart of the nine-minute
epic that rounded out I lectr-o-Pura. Ihe reprises both stand on
their own while they enhance the originals, the former possessing clar
ity that sharpens the latter. I ike everything else with Vo l a 'I'engo, it
shows a sense of freedom that allows lor expansion and constant
growth.
I hat unhindered approach carries over to the listener's percep
tions of the songs. I or instance, although descriptions of Tlectr-o-
I'ura .ts a narrative ot Hubley's and Kaplan's marriage seem intru
sive, Kaplan says, that if there's anything to the songs, they're open
to a number of interpretations, that being one of them.
I'(.l hate to answer (that interpretation) and sort of stop people
from really listening to it,"he continues. "One thing I hope is true
about our records is that you can listen to them over and over again
and rethink them. And I think there's wavs of getting too much in
formation that would stop that process or make that process
tougher."

For the time being, the band is touring for
the next month, constantly reinventing

music km penormance in a wav
that teels right rather than repro
ducing albums live, which Ka-

plan compares to proofread
k ing." What the road beyond

that holds, Kaplan doesn't

care to know. One could
describe Yo La Tengo's
ever-continuous devel
opment as an uncon
scious thing, if only be
cause Kaplan isn't read
ing scripts or fortunes.
They'll get there, wher
ever there is.

"I think it'scasici
lor someone else lo speak

" about thechangesovera 10-
year period, because we're

r living those changes," he says.
"We're so close to it that it's hard

to read it. And also, I don't think
we're interested in reading it. I think

the more of a feeling we have of the path
we're on, the easier it would be to predict what's

coming next. I think we're happier not to know what's coming next."
