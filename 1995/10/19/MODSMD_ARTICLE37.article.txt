## CANDLEBOX Lucy 
### 
Nimbly sidestepping knee jerk sympathy,
b ittered post-grunge jokes ( andlebox man
a; e to repel where you'd like to pity, disap
point where you might want to cautiously
p .use. Their dreadful sophomore effort,
Lucy. ' is grandiose in its pretension and hu
miliating in its lack ot subtlety. ()ther major
I ihel i ircus acts like Stone Temple Pilots and
Stlverchair illicit grins and groans at once
with the stirring, guilty pleasure ot bold
mediocrity. No such luck here; just bloated
melodrama and, for those who at least ex
pected something to chuckle over, the hu
morless sum ot all fears.
Most unforgivable is the brooding sell ab
sorption of the otherwise tuneful tracks. On
"Simple Pleasures," frontman Kevin Martin
cioons so balefully you can hear his pout:
He's had days where shades of brilliance
never granted him space." And just as you
were reminding yourself that everyone has
lyrical slip-ups, Martin comes through again
on "Become (To Tell)" with the painfully
pseudo-sensitive "Can you feel this constant
resurrection of needs?" It's the kind of trans
parent introspection better relegated to dog
eared journal -keeping.
Other tracks, like "l.ucy" and "Crooked
Iialo," .it least know how to build sputtering
verses against circular looping choruses, mo
notonies upon monotonies. It would hold
together, predictable, numbing, even pleas
ing, if it weren't for that babbling lead in the
background. Cuitarist Peter Klett follows
resolutely behind the paint-by-numbers
melodies like that annoying kid in high
school 110 one could get to shut up.
Kevin Martin deserves much of the criti
c ism he gets for shamefully imitating grunge
vocalists of old. Hut while Tavne Staley's an

guished and T.ddie Vedder's headstrong
growls resonate and linger 111 your mind,
Martin's whiny pleat just gets stuck in your
teeth like .1 piece ot food. Hut it's half assed
mimesis without the strength ot its convic
tions, often swamped by guitar dreck. (It
might have been a wise decision, however, es
pecially in light of sueh tidbits of lyrical pro
fundity like "You lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie,
yeah." I)uch.)
Its bra/en sell dramatization of the worst
kind. Martins "I'm empty and inspired,
alone' is simple-mindedness raised to epic
heights. Its a too-loud laugh; a joke gone
wrong; an awkward moment at your fifth
grade lunch table. Something to move 011
from; something to forget.
