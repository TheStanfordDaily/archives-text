## In From the Storm: the Music of Jimi Hendrix 
### 
What would happen it a talented collec
tion of known (Corey Glover of Living
Colour, Carlos Santana and Sting) and un
known (Noel Redding of the Jimi Hcndrix
Experience) musicians pondered the ques
tion, "What would the Experience sound like
today il the innovative bluesist-turned-rock
er turned jazzman hadn't died 25 years
ago?"
At best, the product of their musings
might be as musically intense as a debate in
the Lincoln-Douglas tradition. At worst it
might be tripped up by the foolish consisten
cies of habit. "In from the Storm: the Music
of Jimi Hendrix" is happily and sadly some
where in between. Teeming with the visions
of a host of middle-aged rock, blues and jazz

men, "Storm" is a self-absorbed eulogy,
sometimes too elaborate for its own good.
Did I say sometimes? Make that most
times.
Musicians like Bootsy Collins and Queen
guitarist Brian May make the mistake of ap
proaching the classic work the way Hendrix
might himself. And what's worse, all 13 offer
ings with the exception of Stings "The Wind
Cries Mary," are arranged around a rhythm
section courtesy of the London Metropolitan
Orchestra.
In many cases, the typically heavy-handed
approaches of the disc's guest stars — in con
junction with the airy arrangements of the
London Met. — produce sort of a chic, slip
pery sound, more appropriate on an HOs
greatest hits album than on a tribute to a mu
sician of Hendrix's stature. But when the
record's arrangements do work, it's like being
in the center of a purple haze.
In "1 lave you ever been (To Electric Ladv
land)," Baud of Gypsies alumnus Buddy
Miles, with the help of Steve Lukather and
Stanley Clarke, reminds us why Hendrix's
best work challenges our ear drums as well as
our imaginations.
But "Little Wing," a duet between Toots
Thiclmans (on harmonica) and the London
Met., is the album shocker. Make no mistake
about it, there is an energy in their dialogue
that is so private, so personal that listening
feels more like eavesdropping. As Thielmans'
harmonica runs dip over, under and between
his accompaniment, it is unclear who's under
the influence of whom.
Despite its flaws, this latest reworking of
the Hendrix legacy will no doubt carve a
place for itself among the year's better al
bums, partially because of the popularity of
the man it honors and partially because it's
difficult tor great musicians to make realh
bad music.
