# VARIOUS ARTISTS
## Red Hot + Bothered 
### 
From movie oundtracks to label sam
piers to charity tiling to god awful tribute
alburns, alt rock compilations usually start
with a mediocre idea anil then go downhill
from there. 'Angus,' lonnage," "Kncoini
um, Horn to i hoo.se. most ot them are
just disjointed batches of half baked perf'oi

mances, either sorry covers or stu
dio rejects, compiled to promote a
record label, to salute some classic
rocker or to fight AIDS. But it
takes more than a good cause to
make a good album, and this time
around, the Red I lot ()rganization
keeps that in mind, delivering one
of the finer compilations in recent
years.
Billed as "a pro-sex, pro so
cial album for these underheated
times," 'Red Hot 112 Bothered: the
indie rock guide to dating" still
comes across like a jumbled collec
tion of singles, but there's enough
talent in this lineup to make the
trip more than worthwhile.
Freedom Cruise — which
is basically Guided by Voices with
Kim and Kelly Deal of the Breeders
— starts the album with a charge

ofGßV's familiar, grubby vibe, only to be cut
off after two minutes for some happy, regal
pop from Built to Spill. From there, it
launches into another 16 songs from fairly
well-known indie musicians, for a trip that's
consistently decent and occasionally bril
liant.
If there's a single highlight to this album,
it's the Grifters' "Empty Yard." The heaviest,
most moving piece on this otherwise breezy
album, the song oozes with a slinky empti
ness and a thoughtful weight reminiscent of
their "Eureka E.P."
I leavenly and Lisa Germano also help out,
delivering a pair of perfectly fluffy pop songs,
while the Sea and Cake and Future Bible He
roes (a Stephin Merritt project) whip up
smooth, moody pieces that clearly break any
monotony that an indie-rock collection
might risk.
Liquorice, Noise Addict, the Cradle Rob
bers (featuring Rebecca Gates of the
Spinanes and Lois Maffeo) and the Flying
Nuns also come through admirably, while
Gastr del Sol ends the album with a long in
strumental closer which may or may not be
utterly pointless.
Altogether, "Red Mot ■+ Bothered" works,
steering clear of the usual compilation pit
falls, avoiding homogeneity and predictabil
ity and delivering a well-rounded and thor
oughly high-quality effort.
