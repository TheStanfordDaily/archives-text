# ASSU plans creation of a guide to courses
## Book to contain students' opinions 
### Marni Leff 
Choosing courses — even after
two weeks of shopping — can be
among the most challenging expe
riences of a Stanford career.
Now, the ASSU hopes to make
life a little easier for students by
releasing a course guide full of ad
vice on professors and classes.
The ASSU plans hire a project
manager by the end of next week
to coordinate the new course
guide. The guide — which may get
published online — won't be avail
able until winter or spring of the
1996-97 school year.
Until 1988, the ASSU provided
such a course guide, though it was
discontinued because putting it to
gether was so expensive. In 1992,
the ASSU revived the guide for a
year, but many students felt it.
didn't include information about
enough classes to prove helpful.
The ASSU's Committee on
Academics Research Evaluation
(CARP]) will be doing the bulk of
the work for the new course guide.
"Right now, we're still pretty
much in the planning stages," said
senior Julian Castro, chair of the
committee. "We're trying to fig
ure out what committee in the
ASSU is going to work on what."
The group is currently re
searching course guides at other
universities — such as Harvard
and UCLA — and at Stanford Law
School, said senior Rich Stolz, a

Council of Presidents member.
The process of putting the course
guide together will be lengthy, he
said.
"One of the problems with the
old course guide was that the work
that was put into it was excellent,
but the scope was not wide
enough," Stolz said. "That's part
of the reason we are reaching so
far for institutional support in
planning this course guide. With
the right institutional support, we
can provide a guide that will last,
and 1 think if things keep going
the way they are, we could put to
gether one of the best course
guides in the country."
A new course guide would also
help improve education at Stan
ford, Stolz said.
"I'm really excited about this,"
Stolz said. "There is a real push
here to improve teaching and eval
uation of teaching at Stanford.
With positive efforts like this and
cooperation with the administra
tors, the course guide could be re
ally useful and effective."
Right now, Stolz said, there is
still speculation as to how the
guide will be funded.
"It depends on the medium we
use," Stolz said. "If we do it as a
page on the Web, we may look for
an outside sponsor."

said. "People spend a lot of time

figure out what to take."
With the descriptions in the
Stanford Bulletin vague and
short, many students said they
would welcome information from
others who have already taken
the courses.
