## BOSS HOG 
### 
"Stand back watch me suck your belly
dry / Cover girl used to having things her
way" are the first words we hear Christina
Martinez shout on Boss Hog's eponymous
Ceffen debut. Her gritty voice comes through
loud and clear with the beautiful self-confi
dence that one would expect from someone
who once served ice cream alongside Henry
Rollins. Her opening remarks are a good in
dication of the power and the essence of this
band. There is little doubt that she means
what she sings and that this album will in
deed be a force to be reckoned with.
A cross between driving blues and punk,
Boss Hog is the product of guitar virtuoso
Jonathan Spencer — of Pussy Galore and lon
Spencer Blues Explosion fame — and his
girlfriend and vocalist Christina Martinez.
The quartet is rounded off with Jens |ur
gensen on bass and Mollis Queens playing
drums. Together they form a heavy, tight
band which combines noise, blues riffs, sexu
al overtones and obligatory deep distortion
lor a hard yet cohesive sound.
One of the highlights of the album comes
on the groovy duet, "I 1 )ig You," sung by both
Jon and Christina. The song is filled with
strange pops and boings over a funky bass
line. lon sings in a guttural blues-like tone,
grunting urban mating calls such as "Late in
the evening / I fall down drunk / you got me
feeling / not drunk but drowned" and "1 ate
scum off the streets / I eat raw
macaroni / messed up in a minute / come on
now girl you got to show me," followed by
both Christina and Jon singing the one-line
chorus, "Baby, I dig you."
Other songs tend towards the instrumen
tal with Jon showcasing his amazing guitar
playing. Songs like "What the Fuck" and
"White Sand" alternate gracefully between
straight punk and hard blues with the sparse
vocals distorted to the point of being nearly
incomprehensible.
The musicianship of the driving songs
dominates this album. The lyrics center
around sex and aggression. They tend to
wards the kinky but not the perverse. The en
ergy of the band sparks out angrily from the

speakers. This album is restrained chaos —
just like all good rock and roll.
