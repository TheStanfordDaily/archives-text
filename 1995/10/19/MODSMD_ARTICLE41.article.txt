# W.C. AND THE MAAD CIRCLE Curb Servin'
## 
### 
In Los Angeles, New York, everywhere,
underground rap is still thriving, inspiring
nods to big beats and track snackin'. When
you listen carefully, beyond the I-got-the
phattest-glock bullshit, you'll hear funk re
vivals, revolutionary politics and news from
the street that never makes your TV set.
"Curb Servin'," the latest album from W.C.
and the Maad Circle, adds another voice to
this underground scene.
The group sounds like a West Coast mem
ory of LPMI): hardcore, east-side paced rap
pin' but in the L.A. funk scene of Parliament
samples and the G-dub sound. "Curb
Servin'" is executive produced by Ice Cube,
W.C. and Crazy Toones. This three-way
arrangement works out just fine because we
get the Ice Cube funk and ghetto representa
tion without his usual repertoire of racism,
anti-semitism and misogyny. Admittedly, the
Ice is a lyrical nuisance, but his influence on
W.C". leads to a slow, creeping and profes
sional-sounding album.
"Curb Servin' " is juiced, smooth, new
school hip-hop with electronic felicity and
enough bazooka-shakin' bass to pull your car
apart. The songs are varied and reflect an
ability to rap easy or rough-neck by W.C. and
crew. "Homesick" (produced by Ice Cube) is
smooth as butta' while "In a Twist" makes
you want to buy dropped, chromed-out '(>4
Impalas with tinted windows and enough
bass tubes to start a riot.
The crew can rap. They hit the beats and
flip the scripts as if they were one multi
voiced unit. You don't get any of that Digable
dissonance that grates the ears. But the old
school revival attempt on the title track
"Curb Servin' " (produced by Crazy Toones
and Ice Cube) becomes muddled. There arc
too many Parliament and '80s Africa Bam
baata-esque samples layered over simple bass

beats to make for slick
hip-hop.
As far as content,
lyrics like "Increase the
peace / fuck that / in
crease the heat" must
make John Singleton
cringe. However, beyond
the testosterone over
dose, there is some politi
cal substance to the
album. In "Wet Dream,"
one of the rappers
dreams of seeing 30,000
gang-bangers descend on
Washington D.C to kid
nap the president and
take him to South Cen
tral. Of course, the rapper
gets killed when in L.A.
(W.C must kick it with
Oliver Stone), but you get
the point: the hoods
aren't getting any better.
This is not the
smartest hip-hop album,
but it's funky enough to

i c
yet the booties shakin', and that's sometimes
all you ever really need.
