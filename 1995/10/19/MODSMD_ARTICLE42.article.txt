# P.M. DAWN Jesus Wept
## 
### 
P.M. Dawn's latest album is titled "Jesus
Wept," after the shortest verse in the Bible. As
hard as the album tries to offer all the reli
gious and spiritual secrets as the title would
suggest, P.M. Dawn fails to do so — both

spiritually and musically.
Although the name "Jesus Wept" implies a
staunchly religious album, the songs simph
represent the ambiguous musings of P.M.
Dawn. No central themes or ideas are ex
pressed here, just a bunch of open-ended
questions. In "My Own Personal Gravity,
Prince Be asks, "Why am I always misintei
preting my guilt? Why does everybody wan'
me here but no one here can give me reasons
why?" (. )n a whole, He seems to be begging r c
spiritual revelation.
1 Respite his spiritual shortcomings, in "I'i
Be Waiting for You," Be serenades the listenei
with a heavenly ballad reminiscent of their f«i
mous single "I'd Die Without You." Mean
while, the album's first single, "Downtow: l
Venus," is likely to be a popular hit on lop 4 r >
lists with its explosive, catchy tune. Aside
from these two palatable selections, the res"
of the songs are dull and static.
P.M. 1 )awn have kept their trademark sam
pling bv covering a trio of songs — Prince s
"1999," the lalking Heads' "Once in a Life
time" and Harry Nilsson's "Coconuts" — in
"fantasia's Confidential Ghetto." Unlike P.M.
Dawn's great cover of limi Hendrix's "You
Got Me Floatin' " on "Stone Free: A Tribute to
limi Hendrix," where they fused early rock
with their special blend of harmonious
melodies, their rendition of these classics does
nothing but desecrate legendary hits.
P.M. Dawn tried to promote a theme ot
love and spiritual righteousness on their new
album. But the group's effort hardly make;
up for their perplexing lyrics, colorless vocals
and listless instrumental. All and all, this
album is not worth 15 of your hard-earned
dollars. If you get suckered into buying this
album, you'll find yourself weeping on the
corner of your local CD store.
