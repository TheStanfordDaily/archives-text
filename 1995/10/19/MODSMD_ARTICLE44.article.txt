# STRANGE DAYS
## 
### 
I've seen the end ol
the world and its not a
pretty sight. Strange
I >a\ s masquerades as
a thriller, but is really
an apocalyptic party
set in the year IW-),
terrify ing in its reality.
December 30of the
end of the century finds
our hero, 1 ennv Nero
(Ralph I iennes) mak
ing last-minute black
market deals in
SQUID, advanced
cvber virtual-technol
ogy — basically porno
and snull portable vir-

tual rcalitv headgt .ir.
lis not .1 good vca i for I ennv. I lis girlfriend
Faith (Juliette Lewis) left him tor a big-shot
record producer, ami straight-laced best-friend
Mace ( \ngela bassett) disapproves of his pro
fession. I'luv hooker Iris (Brigitte H.iko), who
does some wire work" for Lenny (taping her
experiences for him to sell), is in danger and
claims that the\ II tlm .iten I aith next, i)h yeah,
and someone shot big-time rapper cum
prophet leriko One.
In keeping with other cvnical, "Termina
tor" movies, director kathryn < ameron's in
lemo takes place in L.A. Crawling with
crooked cops, barricades, gang violence, dete
riorated race relations and drugs, her\isionot
the next live wars is m> plausible it's scary.
And here is where the movie s successful.
We've all seen Sega, we know the technology
exists. We all followed the O.J. trial, we know
about the skewed L.A.IU). I Jere's one take on
the turn of the century that will make you stay
home at the end of the millennium.
I he acting, too, is commendable. I iennes is

convirk ingas a naive con-man, and adorable in
light leather pants (Happy New Year, ladies).
But the accent is not quite right, and when he
geh nostalgic remembering Faith as a S-0
whore, the audience has to wonder.. .Bassett is
doing her best 1 inda 1 lamilton impersonation,
and is twice the woman I iennes will ever he
she's heen hitting the gym). Lewis, however, is
her usual simpering self, naked throughout
most of the movie and shouting lines like, "It' <
over. I don't love you an\ more, leave me alone!"
I his is where the movie lags. II you slow
down the whirlwind to actually think about
the plot, it falls apart like used Kleenex. Ihe
dialogue, too, is insipid and contrived. The
hackneyed subplot of unrequited love has no
place in post-Judgment-Pay L.A.
Ihe ending is predictable and cheesy (I
called ii halfway through) and the Aulde-
I ang Syne optimism of the New Year doesn't
lly here, but il you sit back and relax and enjoy
the trip, "Strange 1 )ays" assails you with expe
rience. As for I .A., get out while you can.
