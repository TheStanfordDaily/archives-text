# PERSUASION
## 
### 
Many think of
lane Austen's
works as those
dull, stuffv British

novels in which high-society types spend all
of their time sitting around gossiping about
inconsequential affairs.
While the characters in "Persuasion" in fact
spend a good amount of time doing just that,
the heart of the story centers around the issues
of devotion and heartbreak, the influence of
class ami money and the power of persuasion.
The devotion and heartbreak is that of
Anne Elliot (Amanda Root), a woman who
fell in love at age 19 with Frederick Went
worth (Ciaran Hinds), then a poor sailor.
Nine years later, when the film takes place,
the Elliot family finds itself saddled by debt,
thanks to Anne's spendthrift, social-climber
of a father (Corin Redgrave). The Elliots are
forced to lease their estate to a war hero, Ad
miral Croft, who also happens to be Went
worth's brother-in-law.
Mix this basic plot line with one bitchy sis

ter, one hypochondria*, sister, two women
trying to win the handsome Wentworth's
hand, a class-minded family advisor (who
originally persuaded Anne to not marry
Wentworth) and .1 suitor of questionable
motives. Add long walks, trips to Nice and
Bath and one stupid accident. Stir for anoth
er hour-and-a-half and you get the movie's
happy, yet abrupt ending.
While the story hinges on the complexity of
the plot, lack of a clear explanation makes it
difficult to understand the characters' relation
ships if you're not familiar with the novel. Until
the end, one could think (as this reviewer did)
that Anne had actually been engaged to Went
worth's brother instead of Wentworth based
on the complete lack of interaction between
the two and a conversation in which she reacts
to news of this brother s recent marriage.
Despite the confusion, Anne's lingering
pain and the thought that she turned away
her only chance at love come across clearly in
Root's appropriately subtle performance.
Using more facial expressions than words,
her portrayal of Anne as a woman of uncom-

mon strength, shrewdness and tenderness
captures and holds the audience's interest.
I lie rest of the cast adds humor and variety
despite a script which relies on words rather
than action.
Don't see "Persuasion" expecting fast
paced intrigue or a steamy saga of betrayal.
Be prepared instead for the story of an intel
ligent, compassionate woman hoping for a

second chance .it love and what happens
when it presents itself — just as lane Austen
would have it. ...
