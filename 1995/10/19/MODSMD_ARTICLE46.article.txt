## THE 						SCARLET LETTER 
### 
This movie's opening credits say, "Freely
adapted from the novel." Bastardized is more like
it. All this terribly obvious film needed was Fabio

and it would have been a Harlequin Romance Novel.
They should have called it "Hester" instead of "The Scarlet
Letter," because the actual letter shows up one hour and 26
minutes into the film. The first part of the film spotlights
Demi Moore ("Ghost") and Clary Oldman as Reverend
Dimmesdale ("Dracula," "Immortal Beloved") falling in love.
Demi (you never really think of her as Hester) initially sees
the Reverend swimming in a lake. Director Roland Joffe sub
jects the audience to a sappy montage of Clary Oldman's nude
body moving through the water that's right out of "Days of
Our Lives" and contains a few too many shots of Oldman's
butt.
Demi gets her turn to moon us in a scene where she looks
in the water and admires her nakedness. Moore's Hester is the
first feminist — she holds women's meetings and is also a sex
ually liberated vixen.
So, the same night that Demi learns that her husband's
been killed, she and Oldman sneak off to the barn to fornicate
in the most pathetically grotesque depiction of two people
having sex to ever grace the big screen:
Laying in a pile of rice and grain, their bodies shift every
thing around, so that it appears as though they're laying in a
pile of maggots. Demi also moans as Joffe shows us the fa
vorite part of his leading man, Oldman's ass.
Then Moore's husband (Robert Duvall) returns with a
vengeance on the same day she receives her "A" for adulteress.
The movie rapidly becomes "Sleeping With The Enemy 2," as
Duvall searches for the father of Moore's baby. In one scene,
he teaches Moore a harsh lesson by violently washing her face.
Finally, after two hours and 15 minutes of Demi Moore's
signature single tear running from her right eye ("Ghost"),
the film ends with everyone but Moore, Oldman and Pearl
having been killed by Indians. So Moore kisses Oldman and
drives the carriage into the sunset. Meanwhile, Nathaniel
I lawthorne is turning in his grave.
Moore sports a vague accent that comes and goes with
each costume change. And, like Oldman, her character isn't
much more than her accent. So when she loses her accent, her

character is her costume.
Lisa Jollif-Andoh, who plays the mute slave Mituba, gives
the most inspired performance in the film, loan Plowright
("The Age oflnnocence") was quite good, as she always is. Hut
Fabio and Barney would have made a better couple than
Moore and Oldman. Unfortunately for this company, big
controversy, big names and big butts do not a good movie
make.
