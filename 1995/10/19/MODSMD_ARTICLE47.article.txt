"Where's the hitch?"
If you expect to see Linda Fiorentino res
urrect the film-noir heroine of the 1990s ir

"Jade," don't look here.
Contrary to their trailer slogan, "Some fantasies go too
far," "Jade," starring David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino and
Chazz Palminteri, fails to push any new buttons.
This movie begins with the brutal murder of a prominent
San Francisco millionaire, who happens to have a side ca
reer: blackmailing even more prominent men having sex in
his ocean-side den of sin. Add to this a haphazard love trian
gle involving Assistant District Attorney David Corellli
(Caruso) and his two college friends, Trina and Matt Gavin
(Fiorentino and Palminteri). The result? An ill-constructed
tale of corruption, jealousy and sexual deviance gone awry.
The film is seen primarily through the eyes of Caruso's char
acter, as he is pulled from one implausible situation to the next,
in substitute for any real connections between story and char
acter. The shifts from one world to another —the recreation of
San Francisco's ultra-sophisticated Black-and-White Hall to
old men playing mah-jong in Chinatown — are abrupt de
scents into tired stereotypes. Innocent bystanders and whole
cultures are barreled through without any discrimination.
As Caruso careens up and down the streets of San Fran
cisco, the audience may begin to feel the same way he does —
where are we going, and why is the ride so bumpy?
It is as though William Friedkin, acclaimed director of
"The French Connection" and"The Fxorcist," has been de
monically possessed by Hollywood's highest paid screen
writer, Joe Fszterhas ("Basic Instinct," "Showgirls").
The screen heats up whenever the three main characters
interact. There's a power struggle going on that is not ex
plored and left as a surface device.
The film aspires to be over-the-top and I litchockian (res
orption of "Spellbound") in its ambiguity, but unlike the
maestro, it falls short. There is no coherence and the ending
adds more insult to injury in its weak wrap-up ol gratuitous
violence and predictability.
Like a few characters in "Jade," I wish I had "hysterical
blindness" to this film's weaknesses, but I don't.
