# Women concerned about night safety
## Few safe routes in early morning 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
It started with a simple ques
tion posed to the newsgroup for
the Graduate Women's Network:
How does a woman get home safe
ly after working into the early
morning?
A flood of responses to the
question indicated that many
women have the same question
and would like to feel safer and
more comfortable on campus, said
doctoral student Lisa Petrides.
Many women graduate stu
dents work late hours doing re
search. And at 4 a.m. — well after
SURE Escort has stopped running
— the options for a safe route
home are few.
The issue is pressing at i: i
ford, said Petrides, who ac d
that safety is essential to have n
environment conducive to lean
ing.
"There has to be a greater
awareness of the danger that
women face when they work late
at night," Petrides said. She ex
plained that there are two conflict
ing forces at play: the need for
safety and the need for perfor
mance.
"Some (students) need to be on
campus to do the work that is re
quired of them," Petrides said.
"But it is not safe to stay on cam
pus when you have to find a way
home at late hours."
The University designates
"safe routes" on campus which all
students are encouraged to use —
although they may not be the

straightest line between two desti
nations.
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe said that some areas
on campus are deliberately not
well-lit because the University has
determined that they are not the
safest routes to take in the dark.
Instead, the University has made
a concerted effort to light the
areas that are well-traveled and
easily accessible in order to en
courage their use.
Graduate student Guoying
Ding said she nervous when
she has to v on campus in the
middle of the night.
"I have to work around the
clock," Ding said. "I would like the
University to do something to cre
ate a better environment for Uni
versity women."
Currently, SURE escort service
offers women a safe ride home
until 2 a.m. — hours which were
extended from the usual 1 a.m.
closing time because of concern
over an accused serial rapist still
at large in the Palo Alto and Menlo
Park area.
After that, the service stops and
anyone leaving work later must
get home on their own or call the
police department for an escort.
According to SURE Director
Daniel Montes, the group does not
have the funds to extend their ser
vices past 2 a.m. In fact, if service
between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. does not
attract more people, the hours
may soon be cut back again.
The fact that there are not
