# 'The strength of our unity lies in our confident promotion of diversity'
## Irish president calls for understanding 
### Alison Gordon 
Irish President Mary Robin
son addressed the Law School
yesterday, speaking of the need
for international communities to
mutually understand, appreciate
and learn from one another.
The president, in her role as a
visiting professor, delivered the
annual Herman Phleger Lecture,
entitled "Contrasting Constitu
tional Shifts — Europe and the
U. 5.," to a packed Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Her lecture focused
on some of the similarities and
differences between the United
States of America and the emerg
ing United States of Europe.
"We have every reason to look
to and learn from each other,"
she said.
Robinson, trained in law at
Trinity College in Dublin and at
Harvard University, began by
stressing the shared constitu
tional traditions enjoyed by the
United States and Ireland. She
then illustrated the wider paral
lels to be drawn between America
and the larger context of the Eu
ropean Union.
"The parallels between the
United States and Europe — not
any particular state within Eu
rope, but the European Commu
nity or Union itself — are re
markable," Robinson said.
The president described the
similar origins of the United
States and the European commu

nity: Both were initially estab
lished to facilitate a common
market, free from tariffs or trade
obstacles; and both were spurred
on and made real by the actions of
thejudiciary.
In terms of the present day,
Robinson said she still perceives
a strong resemblance between
the United States and Europe.
The two regions share many
areas of common concern — such
as unemployment, welfare of
growing elderly populations and
the environment.
Understanding the common
ality of these issues "can both en
rich further our understanding
of each other and perhaps guide
our future actions for the bet
ter," she said.
Looking to the future, Robin
son described the importance of
recognizing the "subtle but sig
nificant shifts" that are occur
ring in both the United States
and Europe. The key change is a
movement away from the cen
tralized, federal system of legisla
tion toward more localized deci
sion making — "a shift away
from the center," she said.
In the United States this
movement can be seen in the
greater powers and responsibili
ties that Congress is according to
the states, Robinson said. In Eu
rope the change is evident in the
"strong localizing impulse"
voiced by several European mem
ber states against the Maastricht

Treaty of 1991, she said. The
Maastricht process involved
drawing up a series of initiatives
to help define and recognize the
powers of the European Union.
The message of Maastricht

was that some believed "the Eu
ropean ideal threatens local in
terests, local culture, local her
itage and local values," she said.
