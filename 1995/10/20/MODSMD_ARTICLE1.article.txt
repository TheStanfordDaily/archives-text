# 'The interaction between women... was incredible'
## Panel discusses highlights, disappointments of Beijing 
### Jimmy Boegle 
Showing both enthusiasm and disappointment,
a panel of three delegates from the recent Beijing
women's conference discussed their views on the
worldwide women's movement at a program in
Jordan Hall last night.
The program was cosponsored by the World Af
fairs Council of Northern California and the Stan
ford Center for East Asian studies.
The panel consisted of Anne Murray, the presi
dent of the Global Fund for Women; Neera Sohoni,
an affiliated scholar from the Stanford Institute of
Research on Women and Gender; and Helen
Young, a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center
for East Asian Studies.
Held from Sept. 4 to 15 in Beijing, China, the
United Nations Fourth World Conference on
Women attracted more than 5,000 delegates from

189 countries. The conference was entitled "Ac
tion for Equality, Development and Peace."
The participating delegates approved a 149-
page "Declaration for Platform and Action," which
addressed issues such as women's rights, educa
tion, societal equality, poverty and health.
The panel discussed the great feeling of hope
that came from the conference, which consisted of
two sessions: the United Nations governmental
session and a U.N.-sponsored session for non-gov
ernmental organizations.
"There were thousands of women coming to
gether from their very diverse communities," said
Murray, who attended t he non-governmental ses
sion. "When you see that kind of power, you think
that maybe something can really get done."
"The interaction between women around the

world was incredible," said
Young, who also attended the
non-governmental session. "The
conference was epitomized for ine
when I overheard two women
talking and one of them said, 'You
have that problem, too?' "
Apart from the interaction
between women, however, the
panel expressed disappointment,
especially with the United
Nations bureaucracy. Sohoni,
who did not attend the conference
but has worked closely with the

United Nations for a number of
years, questioned the U.N.'s abili
ty to carry out and assist in carry
ing out the various mandates
adopted by delegates at the con
ference.
She also criticized the overall
vision of the United Nations when
it comes to women's issues. "Is
the U.N. vision at best an eye
wash, or at worst a lie?" she ques
tioned, pointing out that less than
4 percent of the United Nation's
leaders are women.
The group also expressed dis
appointment in the controversial
declaration adopted at the govern
mental conference. "We think the
Platform for Action is very good,"

said Murray, speaking of the
issues confronted and the lan
guage used in the document.
"However, it has no teeth. It has
no budget behind it, and it has no
U.N. agency behind it to push it
through."
The panel agreed that the real
strength of the worldwide
women's movement lies in local,
grassroots organizations and not
in large conferences.
"Beijing was great and excit
ing and powerful for some, hut
now we are back home," said
Murray.
"We do not need another con
ference," said Sohoni. "Let us get
on with the implementation."
