Video villain
A video camcorder thief is on the loose in
Escondido Village, and the unknown villain has
already hit two Escondido apartments.
The first theft occurred Oct. 6 when an unknown
suspect forcibly entered the apartment of graduate
student Huey-Kang Sytwu and took a JVC Super 8
video camcorder. Police said the suspect used a tool to
defeat the lock on a sliding door in the apartment and
then left with no valuables other than the camcorder.
The second theft occurred between Oct. 6 and
Oct. 8 when an unknown suspect forcibly entered
the residence of James Doohan. Police said the sus
pect broke the front door frame and later left with a
Sony Handicam. Police believe the two crimes are
most likely related and have no clues leading to the
identity of the thief.
Forbidden fruit
Beware of picking the fruit from University trees
and grounds: You may be charged with theft.
On Oct. 8 between 11 and 11:20 a.m., four people
were seen picking olives from the trees in Memorial
Court. A University official reported the theft of
olives to the Stanford Police and officers responded
to the call.
('apt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford Police
said picking fruit from University vegetation is
technically a crime, but charges are filed only if the
University decides to prosecute. The University
will not prosecute the suspects in the Oct. 8 inci
dent, but Niemeyer warned that the University will

most likely prosecute for more grievous offenses,
such as cutting palm fronds.

Forsythe Hall and the Stanford Press Building
have been the scenes for two more burglaries this
year.
On Oct. 11, Anne Crowley, administration ser
vices manager for Networking and Communication
Services, discovered that a Macintosh Powerbook
laptop computer was missing from her office in
Forsythe Hall. Crowley said the computer which was
stolen between Oct. 6 and Oct. 10, and was taken
from the leather carrying case where it was stored.
Crowley said the office was locked during the time
of the burglary and police discovered no signs of
forced entry.
"A number of reported thefts have occurred in
Forsythe Hall over the List few years," Crowley said.
"When a theft occurred in this particular office one
and-a-half to two years ago, we increased security.
We may now look into card key locks, but they would
be the final measure for security in this office."
Between Oct. 8 and Oct. 9, an unknown suspect
entered the Stanford Press Building and took keys,
loose change and a portable CD player from different
cubicles.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said there
were no signs of forced entry and that the burglar
most likely had access to the building.
"We have no fingerprints, no suspects, no clue,"
Niemeyer said.
