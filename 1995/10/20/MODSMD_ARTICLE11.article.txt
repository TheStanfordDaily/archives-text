## Powell's plans mystify GOP Dole, Buchanan wait for Powell 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — To Pat Buchanan it
would be a "godsend," to Bob Dole another headache.
As they wait for Colin Powell to decide whether he
will run for president, the declared Republican candi
dates can't wait to reassess their strategies.
On virtually a daily basis, Powell now factors into
the GOP campaign debate: The candidates and their
allies look to blunt his chances and more neutral
observers assess how a Powell candidacy would
change the race.
Just yesterday, Buchanan said it would be
unthinkable for the Republican Party to turn to Pow
ell, given his support of abortion rights, gun control,
affirmative action and "New Deal and Great Society
programs."
" There really is no argument for the nomination of
General Powell other than the fact he is running high
in the polls," Buchanan said in an interview.
At the other Republican campaigns, public reac
tion to Powell has been more muted. Candidates dis
cuss him only when asked.
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, for example, says Pow
ell's views seem to make him a better fit in the Demo
cratic Party. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexan
der labels Powell "too liberal to be nominated" by the
GOP.
Dole, the GOP front-runner, predicts Powell
would find his popularity hard to maintain if he
became a candidate and was forced to spell out his
views in more detail.
Privately, Dole aides suggest a Powell candidacy
would force some activists now aligned with Bucha
nan and Gramm to decide whether to stay put, which
could help Powell by splintering the conservative
vote, or strike an alliance with Dole.
Buchanan predicted his supporters would not
waver.
"I think conservatives will respond to someone
who does not modify or dilute his positions — like a
Powell or Dole — but someone who stakes them out
clearly and boldly," Buchanan said. "I think the
entrance of Colin Powell into the race would be a god
send."
Powell, whose book tour ends today, promises to
make a decision by Thanksgiving.
At a book-signing yesterday in Duluth, Ga., he told
reporters that when the tour is over, "I then go into
seclusion for a couple of weeks with my family and
advisers and then will come to a conclusion and
announce it indue course, some time in November."
Earlier in the week, Powell said he would have to
be "brain dead" not to be moved by the support he has
received during his book tour. But he also said he
realizes "your enemies don't come out to buy a book
and have you sign it."
Powell added that his "popularity rating does not
really compare to the political ratings" of President
Clinton, Dole and others engaged in daily debate. "I
don't confuse the two," he said, adding that some of
those urging him to run might miss the distinction.
GOP insider and close Powell friend Kenneth
Duberstein also has had conversations with Republi
can operatives who are not already involved in the
presidential race, although most of these have been
initiated by strategists eager to work for any Powell
campaign.
Duberstein also met last week with GOP pollster
Ed Goeas and reviewed recent surveys assessing Pow
ell's prospects. Goeas, who initiated the meeting, said
Thursday he had no concrete evidence but guessed
Powell would run.
