# House passes Republican Medicare plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ignoring a
veto threat, the House passed a
Republican plan yesterday for over
hauling Medicare by raising premiums
for the elderly and disabled and saving
billions from hospital and doctor fees.
The vote was 231-201. Six Republi
cans voted against their party's pro
posal to save $270 billion from Medi
care over seven years. Four Democrats
sided with the GOP.
The vote culminated a long, bitter
day of debate about the future of the
health plan for America's 33 million
elderly and 4 million disabled workers.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich
called it "a great, great victory . . . for
fact over fiction" and"for believing
you can tell the truth to the American
people." He said Republicans were sav
ing Medicare for today's retirees while

sparing America's children from being
"crushed with taxes."
Gingrich accused Democrats of
"dishonest demagoguerv" in charging
that the savings were really aimed at
freeing up money for the Republicans'
$245 billion tax cut.
House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt charged that the Medicare
bill and a separate GOP plan to take
$182 billion from Medicaid for the
poor were "the beginning steps of dis
mantling these programs as we have
known them."
Even before the votes were cast,
President Clinton warned that the
Republican plan to save $270 billion
from Medicare over seven years "will
eviscerate the health care system for
our older Americans."
Clinton sent this message to the

Republicans: "I will not let you destroy
Medicare, and I will veto this bill."
A key Republican, Rep. Thomas J.
Bliley Jr. of Virginia, suggested a
compromise might be possible before
the final bill is sent to the White
House. "I'd be willing to consider any
reasonable proposal," said the chair
man of the House Commerce Com
mittee.
The House first rejected by a lopsid
ed margin, 283-149, a Democratic
alternative that would have saved $90
billion from Medicare over seven years
— a third of the medicine prescribed
by the Republicans.
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, boasted
that the GOP's "lifesaving legislative
surgery" would save Medicare for
today's retirees and the next genera
tion. The Ways and Means chairman

allied it "a great and historic occasion."
But Democratic Rep. Sam Gibbons of
Florida called it "another day of infamy"
that will result in America's elderly
being "herded into managed care."
Republican leaders made last
minute changes, including concessions
to rural hospitals and steps to make
health care fraud a criminal offense, to
minimize defections from their Medi
care Preservation Act, the central
plank of their plan to balance the fed
eral budget by 2002.
GOP leaders said their belt-tighten
ing measures would buy nine years of
life for the Medicare hospital fund,
now in danger of drying up by 2002.
They acknowledged that more will
need to be done to keep Medicare going
beyond 2011 when the baby boomers
retire.
