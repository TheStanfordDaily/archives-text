# Girls undergoing gene therapy thrive

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Two
girls who were the first patients in
history to undergo gene therapy
are now thriving and living near
normal lives, despite being born
with a usually lethal immune dis
order.
Doctors from the National Insti
tutes of Health said that since the
therapy started in 1990, both girls
have developed strong immune
systems, including copies of the
genes that were transferred into
their bodies to replace genes they
were born without.
The doctors' report is being pub
lished today in the journal Science.

The two patients were born
with a condition called severe com
bined immunodeficiency disease,
SCID. Houston's famed "bubble
boy" had a form of the disease.
Patients with this disorder
lack the immune system cells
required to protect against infec
tion. Such patients often become
sick from germs that are con
trolled routinely in people with
normal immune systems. Most
die at an early age.
Doctors determined that the
girls' disorder resulted from flawed
genes that failed to produce adeno
sine deaminase, or ADA, an

enzyme essential for the proper
number of disease-fighting white
blood cells.
The girls, then aged 4 and 9,
were brought to the NIH where
researchers received permission to
use them as subjects in a pioneer
ing gene therapy program.
Gene therapy started in
September 1990 for one patient
and in January 1991 for the other.
Doctors took white cells, or T
cells, from the blood of the young
patients and cultured the cells until
they multiplied to many thou
sands. The researchers then mixed
the cells with a virus t hat had been

altered to include the normal ADA
gene, but was rendered harmless.
When the virus infected the T-cells,
it also transferred the ADA gene
into the blood cells.
Researchers then injected the
altered T-cells into their young
patients.
In the study in Science, the
researchers report that hoth
patients have evidence that the
ADA gene has been incorporated
into their immune systems.
Hoth patients continue to
receive doses of artificial ADA
enzyme, a conventional therapy for
the disease.
