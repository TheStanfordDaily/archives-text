# Disturbed meeting
## UC students protest Regents' decision 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Angry students demanding the
return of affirmative action to
the University of California dis
rupted the regents' meeting yes
terday, the fourth such con
frontation this year.
A 15-year-old girl was booked
on charges of disturbing a public
meeting.
A few students upped the ante
by declaring they will not eat
until the UC Board of Regents
takes back its controversial July
20 vote dropping race and gender
as factors in admissions, hiring
and contracting.
"If you can live with your
selves with five hunger strikers
dying, so be it," said Cesar Cruz,
a UC-Irvine student who said he
had not eaten since Monday
night. "I myself am willing to go
all the way."
The admissions policy change
passed by only four votes (14-10)
and some regents have suggested
reconsidering the issue.
But despite the protests,
regents have no immediate plans
to revisit the vote.
Regent Ward Connerly, the
man who proposed the July 20
vote, said he was sympathetic to
the hunger strikers' dedication,
"but it's not going to make me
back off."
He said a majority on the
board still supports the changes.
Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a regent
who voted against the affirma
tive-action changes, also said he
was sympathetic but hoped the
strikers would find "a way of
expressing their outrage in a way
that's less injurious to them
selves."
Students also voiced strong
opposition to another item on
the regents' agenda, a proposal
to hike fees by about 7 percent,
but no vote was taken on that
issue.
The increases, which would
bring undergraduate fees to
$4,409 a year, prompted Davis to
suggest a possible ballot initia
tive next year to impose a mora
torium on further increases.
Fees have increased by more
than 150 percent since 1990.
Regents will not vote on the
proposed $8 billion UC budget
until November, and fees would
not be firmed up until the state
budget is approved next summer.
Last year, a 10 percent

increase was averted when the
state agreed to give more money
to the school.
The affirmative-action
protests were the latest in a
series of outbursts following the
regents' vote.
The noisy protests had
prompted regents' Chairman
Clair Burgener to suggest chang
ing the way the public is allowed
to speak at the board's meetings.
However, after yet another
boisterous protest which halted
yesterday's meeting for about 15
minutes, Burgener moved to kill
the motion.
"Our proposal to hear from
the public and still get our work
done didn't fly," he said later.
In the afternoon, students
again disrupted the meeting, a
protest which ended with the
arrest of the 15-year-old. UC
officials said the girl refused to
give her name and was being
taken to San Francisco Juvenile
Hall.
Earlier this week, the Aca
demic Senate at UC-Berkeley
voted 124-2 to ask the regents to
rescind their vote.
The resolution alleges that
"on July 20, 1995, a narrow
majority of the regents defaulted
upon their solemn responsibility
to protect the university from
the realm of partisan politics."
Last week, students through
out the nine-campus system ral
lied in favor of affirmative
action, staging a number of
demonstrations including a
3,000-plus rally at Berkeley fea
turing civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson.
So far, more than 1,500 facul
ty members have signed an
Internet petition against the vote
and a new group, Berkeley Facul
ty for Affirmative Action, has
sprung up on the flagship cam
pus.
The hunger strike going on at
UC-Irvine is scheduled to run
from Oct. 17 through Oct. 27. It
is being held under the auspices
of school officials as a fast under
a doctor's supervision.
However, Cruz, said he will
not eat until the July 20 vote is
repealed.
He believes the prospect of
students falling ill or dying will
persuade regents to act.
"Is the nation going to allow
this?" he said.
