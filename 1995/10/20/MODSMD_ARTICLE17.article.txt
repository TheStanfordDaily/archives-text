# Lincoln seduced by Mary Todd

### 
SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) - Abraham
Lincoln and Mary Todd announced abrupt
ly one morning that they would be married
that same night. And their firstborn
arrived nine months to the day after the
ceremony.
Now a Lincoln scholar suggests that
Todd, fearing a life of spinsterhood, may
have seduced the marriage-shy Lincoln
and gotten pregnant to catch herself a hus
band.
"This cannot be proved of course. It's
speculation. But if there's a little bit of
smoke, there may be a little bit of fire,"
said Wayne C. Temple, author of the new
Abraham Lincoln From Skeptic to
Prophet."
The seduction theory is a small part of
the 446-page work by Temple, a Lincoln
scholar since 1949 who is chief deputy
director of the Illinois State Archives.
The wedding had been preceded by a
courtship with secret trysts in the home of
Lincoln's close political ally, newspaper
publisher Simeon Francis. Francis and his
wife, Eliza, had no children, and their
home had plenty of room.
On Nov. 4, 1842, the couple announced
they would be married that day, and noth
ing could deter them. When he asked
James Harvey Matheny to be his best man,
Lincoln said: "I shall have to marry that
girl."
Lincoln, Matheny reported, "looked and

acted as if he were going to the slaughter,"
according to the book. While dressing for
the nuptials, the son of his landlord asked
where he was going: "To hell, I suppose,"
Lincoln responded.
Lincoln later described his firstborn
son, Robert Todd Lincoln, as "the off
spring of much animal spirits."
Temple cites one account stating that
Mary Todd was the aggressor in the
courtship. At a time when most young
ladies married by 17 or 18, she at 24 —
Lincoln was well into his 30s — was draw
ing closer to spinsterhood. Men may have
been frightened off because she wasn't
very likable.
"The Todd temper wouldn't have
helped too much. She was a little bit
plump. She had no money," Temple said.
Harold Holzer, chief communications
officer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York and the author of nine books
about Lincoln, said there has been wide
ranging speculation on Lincoln's passion
for women.
"Either that he found women irre
sistible and had to control himself all the
time or that he was totally inexperienced
when he married Mary," Holzer said.
Still, he said, Mary did give birth nine
months after the wedding.
"I think the assumption one makes is
that they had a wonderful wedding night,"
Holzer said.
