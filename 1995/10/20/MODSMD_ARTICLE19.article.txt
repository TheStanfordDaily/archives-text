## Dishonorable policy 
### 
Substantial penalty for
early withdrawal punishes
students writing theses

Everyone knew that
the implementation of the
new grading policy was
bound to cause some confusion.
The University even took out
Daily advertisements to remind
students about the new drop dead
lines. But, last year, neither the
protesting students nor the proac
tive faculty could fully predict the
effects of these new rules.
A few weeks into the quarter,
both seniors writing honors theses
and their faculty advisers discovered
a small problem - the new grading
policy is not compatible with the
current honors system.
Students pursuing honors have
always been allowed to take up to
15 units of academic credit for
their work. In the past, students
could register for five units of
credit each quarter and their final
thesis grade would count for all of
these units. Students received an
"N" grade each quarter which was
retroactively changed once their
theses were completed.
The new grading policy, howev
er, has eliminated retroactive
grading. Now the only way for stu
dents to follow this old model is to
take incompletes instead of "N's."
But under the new grading poli
cy, all students have a single year
to satisfy incompletes before these
grades are changed to "NE" There
fore, students who now start hon
ors theses but fail to complete
them literally fail. Many faculty
and students are rightly concerned
that the risk added by such a sub
stantial penalty for early with
drawal will cause many students
to avoid even considering writing
honors theses.
Already, it is too late for those stu
dents who registered for thesis units
this past spring while unaware of

the effects of the grading policy to
escape this change.
To its credit, the University has
admitted not only that a problem
exists, but also that the problem
was unforeseen and needs to be
addressed. In an attempt to fix the
problem, the University has con
tacted all academic departments,
encouraging advisers to discuss the
matter with their students and to
create new internal policies to
work around the situation. Unfor
tunately, the University's response
misses the mark.
The University only addresses
the first part of the problem -
how to deal with the grading poli
cy here and now. The University
has yet to take any measures to
ascertain what effects, if any, the
new policy will have on students
currently considering honors the
ses.
Overlooking an issue, acknowl
edging possible problems and then
telling students to "work around
them" is simply irresponsible. The
Faculty Senate must address this
issue, not sweep it under the car
pet. Even if the policy remains
unchanged, students who are cur
rently pursuing honors should be
granted an exemption for this
year.
Writing an honors thesis allows
each student to focus on and learn
about a self-selected issue or area
of study over the course of an
entire year - it represents the cul
mination of a student's undergrad
uate education. In the Stanford
Bulletin, departments use phrases
such as. ','supplement their major,"
"enrich their education" and
"undertake a more intensive and
extensive program of study" to
describe the rewards of writing a
thesis. The system must be recon
structed so it does not discourage
students from pursuing honors.
While it has yet to be deter
mined whether or not prospective
honors students will be dissuaded
by the new policy, it would be trag
ic if an overlooked, unaddressed
issue causes students to forgo this
most valuable experience.
