# University secures looser financial aid regulations
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Long-running efforts to loosen financial aid regula
tions will soon make it easier for students to obtain
their government-sponsored loans.
Because of a new enforcement agreement between
the University and the Department of Education,
first-time borrowers will no longer have to wait until
30 days after enrollment in order to receive their loan
checks.
The change will help make the "reasonably trau
matic" process of taking out a loan less confusing,
working around a sweeping regulation aimed at less
reliable for-profit schools, said Assoc. Financial Aids
Director Ellen Williams.
"The better you manage yourself, the better shep
herd of financial awards you probably are, and they're
trying to reward |the University] for that," she said.
"The regulations are there to take care of the ones that
aren't managing their own programs."
The new rules come in response to the Department

of Education's call for change, Williams said. The de
partment last April asked universities to submit pro
posals for streamlining their relations with the gov
ernment. A certain number of the proposals were then
approved for a five-year "experimental" period.
In exchange for less proscriptive regulation, the
University this year agreed to step up its own moni
toring efforts with annual reports to the government
over the next five years.
Williams said it was a "step in the right direction"
which could lead to more behind-the-scenes changes in
the future.
Among the possibilities she named were less fre
quent government auditing or less paperwork for loan
applications.
The government, announcing the regulatory relief
this month, seemed to support this idea by emphasiz
ing the variety of approved programs, as well as the
possibility that more approvals were upcoming.
Williams said the University has so far requested
relief only with respect to the 30-
day waiting period, in part because
of reorganization within the
Financial Aids Office. Efforts to
trim the University's budget over
the last few years have resulted in
"a little bit of chaos" in the office,
she said, causing administrators to

miss deadlines on other proposals.
The University recently placed the
office under the dean of admis
sions, eliminating some staff posi
tions.
In addition, some of the altered
regulations would actually have
required increased bureaucracy,
she said.
"You can't get out of [regula
tion!," she said. "It's just that it's
working a little differently."
Government Relations Direc

tor Larry Horton, on the other
hand, offered more general praise
for the measure. "In the overall
government sense, we're facing
increased regulatory burdens,
which sometimes do not lead to a
better outcome. Anything that
reduces regulatory burden is
most welcome."
The University currently par
ticipates in a "quality assurance"
program, which includes 65 other
colleges and universities that veri
fy financial aid data independently
from the government.
Susan Brandt, financial aid
director at the University of Notre
Dame â€” which also participates in
the quality assurance program
said she originally intended to go
much further in making changes,
but was sure that this phase would
be successful.
The program will allow admin
istrators to become "better stew
ards of federal funds," she said.
Education Secretary Richard
Riley hailed the changes in a press
release as "relieving administra
tive burdens while maintaining
program accountability."
The secretary, who will attend
an education summit in San Jose
tomorrow, is fighting against U.S.
Senate efforts to trim the depart
ment's budget by $2 billion.
