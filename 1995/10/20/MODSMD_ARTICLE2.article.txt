# University secures looser financial aid regulations

Long-running efforts to loosen financial aid regula
tions will soon make it easier for students to obtain
their government-sponsored loans.
Because of a new enforcement agreement between
the University and the Department of Education,
first-time borrowers will no longer have to wait until
30 days after enrollment in order to receive their loan
checks.
The change will help make the "reasonably trau

working around a sweeping regulation aimed at less
reliable for-profit schools, said Assoc. Financial Aids
Director Ellen Williams.
"The better you manage yourself, the better shep
herd of financial awards you probably are, and they're
trying to reward |the University] for that," she said.
"The regulations are there to take care of the ones that
aren't managing their own programs."
The new rules come in response to the Department

of Education's call for change, Williams said. The de
partment last April asked universities to submit pro
posals for streamlining their relations with the gov
ernment. A certain number of the proposals were then
approved for a five-year "experimental" period.
In exchange for less proscriptive regulation, the
University this year agreed to step up its own moni
toring efforts with annual reports to the government
over the next five years.
Williams said it was a "step in the right direction"
which could lead to more behind-the-scenes changes in
the future.
Among the possibilities she named were less fre

applications.
The government, announcing the regulatory relief
this month, seemed to support this idea by emphasiz

possibility that more approvals were upcoming.
