## Interview with the fingerman 
### 
ANEW ADDITION to the small
but conspicuous pantheon of
Stanford vagrants has lately been
the subject of much speculation.
Marked by his somber wardrobe, affini
ty for literature and an ever-erect mid
dle finger, this poet without a patron
has united the community of Stanford
students in a state of constant attention
and occasional indignation.
All over campus, they're talking
about "the guy who flips everyone off."
Stanford students need answers, so I
set out last week to find the man behind
the finger. In a not-so-revealing inter
view outside the Stanford Bookstore,
the generalissimo of gesticulation
refused to answer any of my questions.
Undaunted, I did what respected
journalists from The New, Yorker to
USA Today nave done — I made up the
whole damn thing.
Josh Gohlke: (vato accent) Oh, you're
the Finger Man. I heard about you.
Finger Man: (laughs) It's funny you
should mention that. "Stand and Deliv
er" was one of my major inspirations in
embarking on this semiotic sojourn.
Rut, frustratingly, no one here calls me
"Finger Man." They just call me "the
guy who flips everyone off."
JG: Well, Stanford students have never
been very skilled with names. The book
store is called "the Bookstore," the cof
fee house is called "the Coffee House."
Naturally, the guy who flips everyone
off is no exception. But, "Finger Man" is

indeed the title you prefer?
FM: Yes. Or "Johnny." I've always liked
the name Johnny.
JG: How about "Johnny Finger"?
JF: No.
JG : F air enough. You haven't surfaced
around Stanford until recently. Could
you tell us a little about the history of
the Finger Man?
FM: Well, back in the '80s, I hung out
at UCLA.
JG: And was it demonstration by digits
back then as well?
FM: No, no. I had a whole different gig
back then. I would arbitrarily spit on
people and say, "Hey, kid, it's punk
rock."
JG: So what prompted the change of
venue and venom?
FM: (absentmindedly picks his nose)
For one thing, punk rock just isn't
where it's at any more. The Ramones
are breaking up. Jawbreaker's with a
major. Basically, I've got one hand in
my pocket and the other one flipping off
ROME.
JG: Fascinating. Now, I hate to ask the
predictable, but all my readers are won
dering: What do you have over the type
writer guy?
FM: (snorts) 1 think it's a matter of
coherence. The typewriter guy just
doesn't have a definable persona. He's
got the newspapers. He had the type
writer and now he doesn't have it any
more. He smells bad but he dresses nice.
People just don't know what his deal is.

With me, it's a single message and
there's very little ambiguity about it.
JG: I suppose, but how does the poetry
fit in with the more obvious single mes
sage?
FM: Well, being a poet and saying "F—
k you" are inseparable. It's not only
"F—k you, I don't need to get a real
job," it's "F—k you, I refuse to even
write a whole story. A few sentences are
all I'm willing to produce."
JG: As long as we're talking about
defining characteristics, what's with
the dark threads?
FAI: I' m glad you asked. My clothes are
an expression of my soul. In short, I
wear black on the outside because black
is how I feel on the inside.
JG: I know you're unlovable.
FM: You don't have to tell me.
JG: (becomes serious) Finger Man or
Johnny, poetry or punk rock, sign or
signifier. I've really enjoyed this oppor
tunity to speak with a man who exem
plifies modern duality. Is there any
thing else you'd like to say to Stanford
students?
FM: Well, it's very hard to express with
words.

Josh Gohlke will graduate in June with
a degree in communication and english,
hence his interest in the over-educated
homeless.
