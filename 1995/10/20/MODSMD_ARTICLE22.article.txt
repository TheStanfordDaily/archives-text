'Diversity' authors'open letter to Pres. Casper

HOW CAN WE increase diversity
on campus? This is a pressing
question for all those who wish to
maintain a cosmopolitan sensibility and,
more importantly, a robust marketplace
of ideas. After all, a university is not
diverse if people merely look different but
think alike.
In"The Diversity Myth," based upon
years of careful research and our first
hand experience as Stanford students for
a combined total of 11 years, we detail
precisely how many of Stanford's multi
cultural policies have undermined diver
sity, squelched dissent and narrowed
intellectual life. Here are but a few exam
ples:
• By slashing its foreign language
departments, Stanford has limited the
study of other cultures. Over the last
decade, the departments of French and
Italian, German, Spanish and Por
tuguese and Slavic Languages have lost a
combined eight billets (tenure tracks) for
faculty — a cut of about 20 percent.
• A perverse result of affirmative action
hiring policies seems to be a lack of intel
lectual diversity among humanities facul
ty. To take but one indicator, more than
80 percent of the humanities faculty are
Democrats. Departments like feminist
studies and African-American studies
have no Republicans at all.
• The primary effect of racial theme
dorms has been to remove a large num
ber of minority students from the rest of
the University and thereby limit diversi
ty of interaction. This has balkanized the
campus into distrustful ethnic factions.
The problem has been exacerbated by
separate Orientation activities, separate
graduation ceremonies and separate Uni
versity-sponsored events.
The high cost of multiculturalism has
precipitated large tuition increases and,
as a result, has limited socioeconomic

diversity. Stanford is now far less accessi
ble to students of middle-class back
grounds. Not everyone would agree with
all of these claims, but as the leader of a
campus that prides itself on its open
mindedness, we thought that you would
have at least sought to promote a con
structive debate.
Instead, you engage in pettiness and
name-calling. In a recent letter to The
Wall Street Journal, you charged us with
"demagoguery," "concoct!ing] a cartoon"
and making "egregious errors and mis
representations." Even a cursory reading
of "The Diversity Myth," however, puts
the lie to your reflexive denunciations:
You claim that Stanford "did not slash
its foreign language departments." As we
have already detailed, this is false. Accord
ing to Assoc. Dean John Etchemendy, "the
cuts were not across the board. They were
targeted. In the case of humanities, they
were focused on the languages."
Our source is none other than the
front page of the May 24, 1994 issue of
The Daily: "Concern mounting over loss
of billets." See also "The Diversity
Myth," p. 46.
You claim that "no freshman students
fill out grant requests for their profes
sors' favorite community service agen
cies." Again, this is demonstrably false.
In her fall 1991 freshman English class,
to take but one example, Professor Susan
Wyle handed out a list of preferred
groups for which students could do "com
munity service writing," including grant
requests. The list included the Hunger
and Homeless Action Coalition of San
Mateo County, a self-described "advoca
cy" group; the Homeless Agency Project
of the Bar Association of San Francisco;
Ellipse Peninsula AIDS Service; Bay
Area Action, which "works locally to
achieve the Earth Day 'Agenda for the
Green Decade, "' Mid-Peninsula Citi7,ens

for Fair Housing, and The Environmen
tal Protection Division of the City of Palo
Alto. See "The Diversity Myth," pp. 86-
87. And if you still do not believe us, we
can provide you with the handouts.
You preposterously claim that "there
is neither a requirement in feminist stud
ies nor race theory." Every student
knows that this is demonstrably false. We
refer you to the 1995-96 Stanford Bul
letin, which requires at least one class
"certified as concentrating on gender
studies" and one course on "American
Cultures," defined as the study of "sys
tematically discriminated" ethnic groups.
See also "The Diversity Myth," p. 68.
We could list many other "egregious
errors and misrepresentions" tbat you
have made in characterizing our position.
But your somewhat hysterical reaction
does lend credence to one of our central
concerns — namely, that it has become
very difficult to have a rational conversa
tion about multiculturalism on campus.
Those who question the fundamental
assumptions of what former University
President Donald Kennedy described as
Stanford's "great multicultural experi
ment" are called names and tend to be
dismissed out of hand.
You claim to be "fully committed to the
open exchange of ideas." So are we. To
date neither you nor Provost Condoleezza
Rice have responded to our invitation for
a public and open debate anytime and
anywhere — on any and all facets of Stan
ford's multicultural experiment.
Finally, you note that Stanford has
"raised standards and requirements." We
acknowledge that there has been some
progress since the disastrous Kennedy
years, and it has not escaped our atten
tion that some grading policies have been
toughened (see "The Diversity Myth," p.
222.) But much more needs to be done.
For starters, we would support the elimi

nation of "orchid subjects," which look
nice but serve no purpose; make deep
cuts in the University's services and
simultaneous cuts in tuition; make avail
able the option of a three-year degree;
and prohibit professors and administra
tors, including the president, from taking
political stands.
These are all useful reforms that you
suggested at the beginning of your
tenure, but have since backed away from.
Sadly, it appears that you too, have been
co-opted by the politics of intolerance on
campus. Or perhaps, it is simply that you
have not had time to push these matters.
We understand that your job requires
you to travel around the country and
raise money from concerned alumni. And
we acknowledge that our frank and open
discussion of multiculturalism may only
further complicate matters for you. Nev
ertheless, if this is the case, we would
suggest that your priorities have been
misplaced.
Over the long term, it would be more
constructive for you to devote your ener
gies towards solving Stanford's problems,
rather than towards denying that these
problems exist. Instead of attacking the
messengers, the University might do
well, just for once, to heed their message.
