## No. 23 Cardinal looks to bounce back against Bruins Stanford defense to key on Pac-10 rushing leader Abdul-Jabbar, inexperienced rookie quarterback 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Stanford football received its
first setback of the season last
Saturday against Washington.
Head coach Tyrone Willingham
was not pleased.
"When I look at it, I think all
aspects of our team failed," he said.

"Were there some good things in
those aspects? Yes. But as a sum
total, everybody did not perform
the way we need to perform to win.
Every player has to say he could
have made one better play. Coach
es have to say — I have to say —
maybe we could've made one bet
ter call."
Luckily, one game does not a

season make. The 23rd-ranked
Cardinal (4-1-1 overall, 2-1 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) looks to
rebound tomorrow against UCLA
(4-2, 1-2) at Stanford Stadium.
The Bruins come to Stanford for a
12:30 p.m. start and offer Willing
ham's warriors a chance to get
back on the bowl game track.
"Good teams lose, too," said

senior defensive end Jason White.
"We lost. Now we put it behind us
and move on to UCLA."
For the Bruins, the contest
looms like a storm cloud on the
horizon. With two conference loss
es already and a season finale
against undefeated USC, a defeat
this weekend would very nearly
sound the doom l>ell on UCLA's
postseason aspirations.
"I don't think there's any ques
tion that for us, this is a critical
game," said UCLA head coach
Terry Donahue. "Our goal now is
To prove that we can compete in
the conference."
Stanford, on the other hand,
might be able to withstand anoth
er blemish on its record. But with
back-to-back road trips to USC
and Washington State in Novem
ber, a loss to the Bruins would dig
a hole that could be difficult to
climb out of.
Cardinal players downplay the
possible significance of the battle,
however. "There might be some
doubt in people's minds (about
us), so they are blowing it up in
their minds as this huge game for
Stanford — a must-win," said
senior defensive tackle Pete
Swanson. "I just think that every
game is a big game. Each one
affects your win-loss column the
same."
Right now, Stanford is more
concerned with returning to the
form it displayed in its first five
games. The Cardinal defense

allowed Washington 535 yards of
total offense last weekend, a per
formance which White found
completely unacceptable.
"I don't think we were really
ready to go," he said. "Washing
ton's a good team, but we just
didn't get the job done."
Swanson agreed that some
thing was missing. "When we'd
get into the huddle, there wasn't
the same enthusiasm there had
been,"he said. "We didn't feel the
same electricity."
The fog extended to the offense
as well. Despite racking up 465
yards, its finest showing of the
season, the Cardinal failed to exe
cute on key downs in the red zone.
The missed opportunities cost
Stanford the game.
"There were some mental
things that you can't have hap
pen," Willingham said. "And
there were some physical break
downs — we didn't make the cor
rect block to get a guy down. It
was a combination.
"In the first half, we were
unsuccessful in some of our red
zone attempts. In the second half,
we were successful in some of our
red-zone attempts. So the key is
just to be consistent."
In addition to correcting some
of the problems that surfaced in
the loss to the Huskies, the team
hopes to continue eradicating
sour memories of 1994. In last
year's meeting with the Bruins,
the squad lost a 30-20 fourth

quarter lead to trail 31-30 in the
final minute. The Cardinal drove
to the UCLA 15-yard line, but
Eric Abrams' 32-yard field goal
attempt sailed wide left as time
expired.
"There's a lot of bitterness,"
said senior flanker Andre Kirwan.
"We're looking to correct our
image."
To do so, Stanford must find
some way to stop, or at least slow
down, the Pac-10's leading rush
er, Karim Abdul-Jabbar. Averag
ing 122.3 yards per game, the ver
satile junior is a very dangerous
weapon, one that concerns Will
ingham in light of his team's less
(han-stellar performance against
Wisconsin's Carl McCullough and
Washington's Rashaan Shehee.
"Good backs are going to make
people miss and create some prob
lems for you," Willingham said.
"We just hope it's not to the
degree that those two guys
(McCullough and Shehee) have
created problems for us."
The Bruins' talented and expe
rienced offensive line has helped
Abdul-Jabbar put up the big num
bers. Led by preseason All-Ameri
can left tackle Jonathan Ogden,
the UCLA line has been blowing
opponents off the line of scrim
mage. Although it has been
dinged up in recent games, the
offensive front believes it can con
tinue its success against Stanford.
