# Put up or shut up time for water polo
## 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
After suffering an ignomin
ious defeat at the hands of No. 1
California last week, the No. 3
Stanford men's water polo team
(12-5, 1-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) is looking to
snap out of its three-game los
ing streak and get hack on the
path to the NCAA Champi
onship Tournament. The Cardi
nal is hoping to take its first
step down the comeback trail
right through No. 5 UCLA (9-4.
5-0) when the two teams face
off tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. at
deGuerre Pool.
"Every game is important,"
said head coach Dante Detta
rnanti. "We just have to win the
rest of our games."
Since the beginning of the
season, Dettamanti has been
emphasizing the new format of
the NCAA Tournament, noting
that only four teams instead of
eight will receive bids to the
championships this year. With
the Cardinal's current ranking,

the only way that Dettamanti's
squad is going to have a chance
to defend its back-to-back
national titles is by winning the
Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation Tourney at the end of the
regular season.
In the meantime, however,
the Cardinal must concentrate
on winning the rest of its MPSF
games. Stanford currently
ranks fifth in the league, based
on league records. If the stand
ings remain unchanged, the
Cardinal would be forced to play
a tough schedule in the confer
ence tourney, which is no trivial
matter.
"Seeding is just so impor
tant," Dettamanti said. "It can
really influence your team's
chances at success in a tourna
ment."
But Dettamanti also notes
that some of the MPSF team
records are deceiving. UCLA,
for example, has only lost four
games this year, but the Bruins
have played No. 2 USC just
once and escaped with an upset.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal has five
losses, but it has faced the Bears
and Trojans five times to date and
has come up with only one victory
at the expense of Cal.
"We really need to beat UCLA,"
Dettamanti said. "We have to
improve our league record and give
the Bruins some league losses. It's
all going to become important at
the end of the season."

Tomorrow, the Cardinal and the
Bruins will meet for the first time
this year. Last season, Stanford
dominated UCLA, taking all five
contests from the Bruins. While
previous records amount to noth
ing in the pool, Dettamanti is confi
dent that his team is prepared.
"Some of the guys were sick
early in the week, but no one has
missed more than one workout,"
Dettamanti said. "We have had
good practices this week. I think
that the guys realize the signifi
cance of this game and the rest of
the games this season."
Senior All-American Jeremy

Laster echoes his coach's senti
ments. "I think that the guys are
pretty confident about this game,"
he said. "UCLA is a very beatable
team. It will be nice to have a break
from Cal and USC." The Cardinal
has battled the Bears and Trojans
in its last four matches.
The confidence of the players
stems in part from a general
improvement in team morale.
"We had a players-only meeting
Monday before practice," Laster
said. "We just sat and talked about
everything that had gone on. If any
one had something to say, then
they had the opportunity to do so.

We just had to figure out were
everyone was at and where they
were coming from."
As for UCLA, Bruins coach Guy
Baker pointed out that his team
has experienced something of a
Jekyll and Hyde season. While the
Bruins boast a home victory
against then-No. 1 USC, they have
also fallen to unheralded UC-Santa
Barbara.
Nevertheless, the Bruins boast a
deep, well-balanced lineup with a
host of players scoring. No Bruin
has more than 20 goals, but six
have notched season scoring totals
in double digits. By contrast,
seniors Brian Wallin, Daniel
Lehoczky and Laster have all regis
tered over 20 points. Wallin leads
the Cardinal with 46.
"UCLA has a lot of good play
ers," Dettamanti said. "They don't
have any real dominant players like
those at Cal or USC, but there are
no real weak links. The guys are
going to have to be aware that a shot
could be coming from anyone."
In light of the Bruins' balanced
attack and in hopes of returning to
last year's dominance, Dettamanti
has opted to return to a pressing
defense, which the Cardinal ran
with great success in 1994. Many
teams run a dropping defense
instead, where a guard from the
perimeter sloughs off his man in
order to assist the defender at the
two-meter position.
Dettamanti has likewise tin
kered with his offense to generate
more scoring from a wider variety
of players.
"We are going to switch to a
more driver-oriented offense," he
said. "We just have to score more
goals and we need a more b;danced
attack. We can't just be relying on
Jeremy and Brian for our goals."
Despite sporting something of a
new look, the bottom line remains
the same for the Cardinal. Stanford
must win and keep winning if it
wants to have a shot at playing for
a third consecutive national title.
