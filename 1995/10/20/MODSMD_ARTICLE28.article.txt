Live from Stanford Universi

laws applied to college educa

would be taught in the "Rubbish

NCAA college football prognosti

UCLA at Stanford
Now that we've got that ridicu
lous little matter of the zero loss
es out of the way, let's talk ratio
nal football.
The differences between this
year's Cardinal squad and last
year's team make Newt (Jingrich
and Jesse Jackson look like ideo

logically equivalent fraternal
twins. But Stanford still needs an
offense that won't slip into a
coma every time it moves the ball
inside an opponent's 20-yard line,
not to mention the fact that QB
Mark Butterfield would have had
better protection in the pocket
last Saturday against Washington
with Miss Daisy and Gomer Pyle
warding off linemen on the
periphery.
Nevertheless, I think the bits
and pieces of quality football we
have seen in the past month, how
ever minuscule, will come togeth
er this weekend for the Cardinal.
If Stanford manages 460 yards of
total offense again on Saturday
and gives up less than 300 yards
on the ground, the Cardinal
should condemn the once-con
tending Bruins to a bowl season
of hibernation.
Scott sizes up the tenuous situ
ation differently.
"I like UCLA's defense," he
says. "They should shut down
Stanford's offense."
That is, unless the Cardinal
decides to bring its offensive pro
duction to a screeching halt with
