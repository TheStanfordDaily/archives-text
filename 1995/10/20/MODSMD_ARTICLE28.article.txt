Live from Stanford Universi
ty, where if truth-in-labeling
laws applied to college educa
tion, the majority of courses
would be taught in the "Rubbish
Studies" department, it's anoth
er fun-filled 29 column inches of
NCAA college football prognosti
cating.
Delivering his pipin'-hot pre
dictions this week is Domino's
Pizza delivery man Scott Stewart,
attempting to make the difficult
mentality transition from pizza
pies to psychic vibes.
Keep your eyes oscillating from
left to right down the page for a
free sample of Domino's exciting
new offer. No coupon necessary
â€” Scott is about to cook up his
own picks for this weekend's grid
iron games and carry it by hand to
your door (in 30 minutes or less,
of course).
UCLA at Stanford
Now that we've got that ridicu
lous little matter of the zero loss
es out of the way, let's talk ratio
nal football.
The differences between this
year's Cardinal squad and last
year's team make Newt (Jingrich
and Jesse Jackson look like ideo

logically equivalent fraternal
twins. But Stanford still needs an
offense that won't slip into a
coma every time it moves the ball
inside an opponent's 20-yard line,
not to mention the fact that QB
Mark Butterfield would have had
better protection in the pocket
last Saturday against Washington
with Miss Daisy and Gomer Pyle
warding off linemen on the
periphery.
Nevertheless, I think the bits
and pieces of quality football we
have seen in the past month, how
ever minuscule, will come togeth
er this weekend for the Cardinal.
If Stanford manages 460 yards of
total offense again on Saturday
and gives up less than 300 yards
on the ground, the Cardinal
should condemn the once-con
tending Bruins to a bowl season
of hibernation.
Scott sizes up the tenuous situ
ation differently.
"I like UCLA's defense," he
says. "They should shut down
Stanford's offense."
That is, unless the Cardinal
decides to bring its offensive pro
duction to a screeching halt with

out tlu i aid of a "tough" Bruin
defense. Based on Stanford's
offensive performance last Satur
day, as long as I'('LA can keep the
Cardinal INSIDE the Bruins' 20-
vard line, Stanford shouldn't be a
scoring threat.
Let me strongly encourage you
pizza eaters out there not to
translate your disappointment at
Scott's pick against the Cardinal
into a habit of piddly tipping. The
next time you see Scott at your
door with that medium pepperoni
(only $7.99 with the coupon!),
keep in mind that Stanford could
easily emerge from this week
end's contest with two losses and
pizza pie all over its face.

('al at ()regon State
Uggh. It's newspaper space
like this that you would just as
soon fill with a huge public service
message describing how much
healthier and happier you would
be if you didn't smoke or a rev
enue-enhancing ad delineating
the pros and cons of penile
enlargement.
Instead, I actually have to pre
dict that the Oregon State
Beavers will beat somebody in the
game of football this weekend.
Scott agrees. "ICal] has a lame
duck coach in Keith Gilbertson,"
he says of the soon-to-be-history
Bears boss. "But if they were play
ing at Cal, I'd pick Cal."
I don't care if the contest was
held on a street corner in the war
torn former Yugoslavia. This Gold
en Bears club looks horrible. If
Stanford doesn't win the Axe back
this season, there will be some

heads on the chopping block come
tryout time next year.

Washington State at Oregon
Before I predict the Ducks'
next victory, I must intercede
with some news recently brought
to my attention by Provost Con
doleezza Rice this week. Appar
ently, her perfect pick of Stanford
over Oregon by seven points that
appeared in this column several
weeks ago went unnoticed and
unappreciated.
From one fan to another, I say
congrats. From one prophet to
another, I say I'll get you next
time.
As for this week's contest, look
for the Cougars to continue their
slump following last weekend's
loss to the Trojans. WSU is play
ing .500 ball and Oregon is com
ing off its 52-30 dismemberment
of Cal last week.
As for Scott, he respects the
Ducks as defending Pac-10
champs. "They are just as good
this year as they were last year,"
he says.
I agree. But the talent level in
the conference has shifted this
year and, for once, the best squad
in the Pac-10 is actually eligible to
go to a bowl game. Imagine that.

Washington at Arizona
What's with that running back
factory up in Seattle known as the
LTniversity of Washington? No
sooner do the Huskies lose their
starting tailback to injury two
weeks ago, sophomore Rashaan
Shehee quietly stepped off the
bench and began making noise.
Stanford heard it last weekend
when Shehee racked up almost

200 yards on 30 carries. The
Husky fellow ran twice as far as
the Cardinal's top two rushers
combined. That's impressive run
ning on the Forrest Gump scale.
Scott forsees an Arizona victo
ry in the valley of the sun.
"They'll win the game outright."
The Huskies have shown signs
that substantiate Scott's prophe
cy. It's too bad Washington's
defense is ranked next to last in
the conference. Hut even a stat
that ominous shouldn't be cause
for alarm as the Huskies travel to
meet the Wildcats this weekend.
Arizona is a club of "has-been''
and "wanna-be," coupled with
very little "is-now" or "will-be."
All I can say is that Arizona's sea
son "has-been" lousy and the
Wildcats probably "wanna-be"
playing golf on Saturday after
noons. Other than that, the team
"is-now" 3-3 and "will-be" 3-4.

USC at Notre Dame
The Fighting Irish might well
have found a four-leaf clover on
the field in South Bend several
weeks ago, pulling off back-to
back victories by the hair on a
Leprechaun's chinny-chin-chin.
Probability would be in favor
of Gerhard Casper joining in on
the nude hazing exercises of sev
eral campus fraternities before
the numbers would pick the Irish
to knock off Rose Bowl-bound
USC. And due to my bred dislike
for Notre Dame, there is only one
of the above events that I would
ever pay to see.
