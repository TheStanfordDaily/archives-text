# Rivalry to thrive on Maples hardwood
## Cardinal looks to extend Pac-10 lead 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
Collegiate sports are often
characterized by passionate,
mtunse rivalries. In football, it's
Stanford versus the Weenies,
Nebraska versus Oklahoma and
Michigan versus Ohio State. In
basketball, it's North Carolina
versus Duke and Kent ucky versus
Louisville.
In women's volleyball, the
rivalry that has coine to define
the sport is Stanford versus
UCLA. Tonight, that rivalry con
tinues as the No. 4 Cardinal (15-
2 overall, 9-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) entertains the No. 10 Bru
ins (10-5, 5-4) at 7 p.m. this
evening in Maples Pavilion. Stan
ford will also host USC Sunday at
1 p.m.
Stanford enters tonight's match
on a roll. The Cardinal easily
defeated No. 8 Notre Dame on
Monday to run its streak of consec
utive victories to 12. What makes
Stanford's streak even more
impressive is the quality of compe
tition. The Cardinal boasts one of
the toughest schedules in the

nation, having already played 11
teams ranked in the top 25. So far
this season, Stanford has beaten
No. 1 Nebraska, No. 5 Washington
State and UCLA. Beginning with
this weekend's matches against the
Bruins and No. 17 USC, Stanford
will battle eight more ranked
teams before the end of the season.
"The idea is that [the competi
tion] helps us build to December,"
said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"By the 1 Women's) NCAA I Vol
leyball Championships), we
should be ready for anybody."
The Bruins come to Maples
with one of their weakest squads
in recent seasons. After finishing
first or second in every Pac-10
race since the league was found
ed, UCLA sits in a tie for fourth
halfway through the season with
a mediocre 5-4 conference mark.
Most recently, No. 14 Arizona
State sneaked into Pauley Pavil
ion and beat the Bruins in five
games.
Meanwhile, Stanford sits
atop the Pac-10 standings at 9-
0. The Cardinal holds a one
game lead over the Washington
State Cougars, whose only coin

ference loss was to Stanford in a
memorable five-game thriller in
Pullman.
Earlier this season, the Cardi
nal traveled to Los Angeles and
completed its first road sweep of
UCLA and USC in four years,
beating the Bruins at home 11-15,
15-7, 15-5, 19-17 for the first time
since 1991.
After getting off to a slow start

accompanied by a series of pass
ing errors, Stanford dropped the
opening game to the Bruins. Just
as quickly, though, the Cardinal
turned up the heat and thorough
ly dominated UCLA, taking
games two and three easily.
