# Rivalry to thrive on Maples hardwood
## Cardinal looks to extend Pac-10 lead 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
Collegiate sports are often
characterized by passionate,
mtunse rivalries. In football, it's
Stanford versus the Weenies,
Nebraska versus Oklahoma and
Michigan versus Ohio State. In
basketball, it's North Carolina
versus Duke and Kent ucky versus
Louisville.
In women's volleyball, the
rivalry that has coine to define
the sport is Stanford versus
UCLA. Tonight, that rivalry con
tinues as the No. 4 Cardinal (15-
2 overall, 9-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) entertains the No. 10 Bru
ins (10-5, 5-4) at 7 p.m. this
evening in Maples Pavilion. Stan
ford will also host USC Sunday at
1 p.m.
Stanford enters tonight's match
on a roll. The Cardinal easily
defeated No. 8 Notre Dame on
Monday to run its streak of consec
utive victories to 12. What makes
Stanford's streak even more
impressive is the quality of compe
tition. The Cardinal boasts one of
the toughest schedules in the

nation, having already played 11
teams ranked in the top 25. So far
this season, Stanford has beaten
No. 1 Nebraska, No. 5 Washington
State and UCLA. Beginning with
this weekend's matches against the
Bruins and No. 17 USC, Stanford
will battle eight more ranked
teams before the end of the season.
"The idea is that [the competi
tion] helps us build to December,"
said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"By the 1 Women's) NCAA I Vol
leyball Championships), we
should be ready for anybody."
The Bruins come to Maples
with one of their weakest squads
in recent seasons. After finishing
first or second in every Pac-10
race since the league was found
ed, UCLA sits in a tie for fourth
halfway through the season with
a mediocre 5-4 conference mark.
Most recently, No. 14 Arizona
State sneaked into Pauley Pavil
ion and beat the Bruins in five
games.
Meanwhile, Stanford sits
atop the Pac-10 standings at 9-
0. The Cardinal holds a one
game lead over the Washington
State Cougars, whose only coin

ference loss was to Stanford in a
memorable five-game thriller in
Pullman.
Earlier this season, the Cardi
nal traveled to Los Angeles and
completed its first road sweep of
UCLA and USC in four years,
beating the Bruins at home 11-15,
15-7, 15-5, 19-17 for the first time
since 1991.
After getting off to a slow start

accompanied by a series of pass
ing errors, Stanford dropped the
opening game to the Bruins. Just
as quickly, though, the Cardinal
turned up the heat and thorough
ly dominated UCLA, taking
games two and three easily.

tinuation of the previous two

games, with Stanford building a
12-3 lead. However, as the
Pauley Pavilion crowd tried to
cheer its team back into the
match, the Bruins clawed back.
Using a stiff blocking attack and
a strong side-out game, UCLA
evened the match and even took
the lead at 15-14 and 16-15
before the Cardinal righted itself
and won the game.
"We dominated them for two
and a half games and then one
rotation cost us a lot of points,"
Shaw said. "We have to do a bet
ter job of avoiding that one real
ly bad rotation that seems to
creep up each match."
Stanford comes into tonight's
match a much deeper team than
the one that beat the Bruins in
Los Angeles. Sophomore Kristin
Folkl, last year's National Fresh
man of the Year, had not
returned to the team from her
summer stint with the U.S.
national team when the Cardinal
traveled to Southern California.
After struggling to reacclimate
herself to the college game for
the first couple of weeks, Folkl
has returned to form and has
added considerable firepower to
Stanford's outside hitting attack.
In addition, the inspired play
off the bench of senior outside
hitter Marnie Triefenbach, who
was suffering from injuries earli
er in the season, has allowed the

Cardinal to constantly add fresh
players to its lineup.
Another advantage for Stan
ford is that playing UCLA tends
to bring out the best in Cardinal
players. A case in point is sopho
more Debbie Lambert. Lambert
set career highs in kills and digs
in Los Angeles with 17 and 19,
respectively. For the match, she
hit .382. Senior outside hitter
Wendy Hromadka also turned
her game up a notch, with a per
sonal-best 22 kills and 14 digs
while hitting .339 against the
Bruins at Pauley Pavilion.
On Sunday afternoon at 1:00,
Stanford will host No. 17 USC
(8-5, 5-4). Earlier this season,
the Cardinal swept the Trojans
in three games, and Stanford
will hope to avoid a letdown
after Friday's match against the
Bruins. If its recent five-game
victory over UCLA is any indica
tion, however, USC will bring a
greatly improved squad to
Maples.
To defeat the Trojans, Stan
ford will have to stop a potent
outside attack led by outside hit
ter Kelly Kuebler. Kuebler, a 6-
foot senior from Los Alamitos,
Calif., leads the team in kills and
ranks in the top 10 in the confer
ence in average kills per game.
Indicative of the magnitude of
the Stanford / UCLA rivalry,
tonight's match against UCLA
will be televised nationally on
the Prime Network. AVP pro
beach volleyball commentator
Chris Marlowe will provide the
play-by-play.

in recent seasons. After finishing
first or second in every Pac-10
race since the league was found
ed, UCLA sits in a tie for fourth
halfway through the season with
a mediocre 5-4 conference mark.
Most recently, No. 14 Arizona
State sneaked into Pauley Pavil
ion and beat the Bruins in five
games.
Meanwhile, Stanford sits
atop the Pac-10 standings at 9-
0. The Cardinal holds a one
game lead over the Washington
State Cougars, whose only coin

ference loss was to Stanford in a
memorable five-game thriller in
Pullman.
Earlier this season, the Cardi
nal traveled to Los Angeles and
completed its first road sweep of
UCLA and USC in four years,
beating the Bruins at home 11-15,
15-7, 15-5, 19-17 for the first time
since 1991.
After getting off to a slow start

accompanied by a series of pass
ing errors, Stanford dropped the
opening game to the Bruins. Just
as quickly, though, the Cardinal
turned up the heat and thorough
ly dominated UCLA, taking
games two and three easily.

games, with Stanford building a
12-3 lead. However, as the
Pauley Pavilion crowd tried to
cheer its team back into the
match, the Bruins clawed back.
Using a stiff blocking attack and
a strong side-out game, UCLA
evened the match and even took
the lead at 15-14 and 16-15
before the Cardinal righted itself
and won the game.
"We dominated them for two
and a half games and then one
rotation cost us a lot of points,"
Shaw said. "We have to do a bet
ter job of avoiding that one real
ly bad rotation that seems to
creep up each match."
Stanford comes into tonight's
match a much deeper team than
the one that beat the Bruins in
Los Angeles. Sophomore Kristin
Folkl, last year's National Fresh
man of the Year, had not
returned to the team from her
summer stint with the U.S.
national team when the Cardinal
traveled to Southern California.
After struggling to reacclimate
herself to the college game for
the first couple of weeks, Folkl
has returned to form and has
added considerable firepower to
Stanford's outside hitting attack.
In addition, the inspired play
off the bench of senior outside
hitter Marnie Triefenbach, who
was suffering from injuries earli
er in the season, has allowed the

Cardinal to constantly add fresh
players to its lineup.
Another advantage for Stan
ford is that playing UCLA tends
to bring out the best in Cardinal
players. A case in point is sopho
more Debbie Lambert. Lambert
set career highs in kills and digs
in Los Angeles with 17 and 19,
respectively. For the match, she
hit .382. Senior outside hitter
Wendy Hromadka also turned
her game up a notch, with a per
sonal-best 22 kills and 14 digs
while hitting .339 against the
Bruins at Pauley Pavilion.
On Sunday afternoon at 1:00,
Stanford will host No. 17 USC
(8-5, 5-4). Earlier this season,
the Cardinal swept the Trojans
in three games, and Stanford
will hope to avoid a letdown
after Friday's match against the
Bruins. If its recent five-game
victory over UCLA is any indica
tion, however, USC will bring a
greatly improved squad to
Maples.
To defeat the Trojans, Stan
ford will have to stop a potent
outside attack led by outside hit
ter Kelly Kuebler. Kuebler, a 6-
foot senior from Los Alamitos,
Calif., leads the team in kills and
ranks in the top 10 in the confer
ence in average kills per game.
Indicative of the magnitude of
the Stanford / UCLA rivalry,
tonight's match against UCLA
will be televised nationally on
the Prime Network. AVP pro
beach volleyball commentator
Chris Marlowe will provide the
play-by-play.
Collegiate sports are often
characterized by passionate,
mtunse rivalries. In football, it's
Stanford versus the Weenies,
Nebraska versus Oklahoma and
Michigan versus Ohio State. In
basketball, it's North Carolina
versus Duke and Kent ucky versus
Louisville.
In women's volleyball, the
rivalry that has coine to define
the sport is Stanford versus
UCLA. Tonight, that rivalry con
tinues as the No. 4 Cardinal (15-
2 overall, 9-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) entertains the No. 10 Bru
ins (10-5, 5-4) at 7 p.m. this
evening in Maples Pavilion. Stan
ford will also host USC Sunday at
1 p.m.
Stanford enters tonight's match
on a roll. The Cardinal easily
defeated No. 8 Notre Dame on
Monday to run its streak of consec
utive victories to 12. What makes
Stanford's streak even more
impressive is the quality of compe
tition. The Cardinal boasts one of
the toughest schedules in the

nation, having already played 11
teams ranked in the top 25. So far
this season, Stanford has beaten
No. 1 Nebraska, No. 5 Washington
State and UCLA. Beginning with
this weekend's matches against the
Bruins and No. 17 USC, Stanford
will battle eight more ranked
teams before the end of the season.
"The idea is that [the competi
tion] helps us build to December,"
said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"By the 1 Women's) NCAA I Vol
leyball Championships), we
should be ready for anybody."
