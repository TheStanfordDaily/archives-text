# Delt house dealt death blow
## It's official: Frat to lose its house at end of fall quarter 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
University officials yesterday
rejected an appeal by the Delta
Tan Delta fraternity, upholding
the decision to evict the Delts from
their house following this quarter.
In a three-page letter released
yesterday, Dean of Students Marc
Wais and Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo said the
appeal produced no new informa
tion, claiming that the fraternity
achieved only four of 10 goals
mandated in March for the Delts
to maintain their residence.
The appeal "did not persuade
us to change our mind," Wais said
in an interview, calling the frater
nity's $41,000 debt — which Delt
members argued was the only rea
son for the eviction — "a signifi
cant factor."
"These facts clearly demon
strate the University's concerted
efforts to keep the fraternity

aware of its fi
nancial obliga
tion," Wais and
Camarillo wrote
in the letter.
"These facts
clearly refute
Delta Tau Delta's
assertion that we
acted upon inac
curate informa
tion."

Delt members contended in
their appeal that former treasurer
Erik Herrling failed to inform
other members about the accruing
debt. When Wais and Camarillo
originally decided Sept. 26 to evict
the fraternity, most members
thought all accounts with the Uni
versity were balanced, Delt Presi
dent iMark Lippert said.
"The treasurer miscominuni
cated to the officers," Lippert said.
"There was miscommunication
about the size of the debt."
Delt member Roger Liu con

curred: "Apparently he knew
about the debt and didn't tell any
one."
Herrling, however, said he
never knew of the debt until late
August. When the University
charged the Delts for last year's
damages, the bills were never allo
cated to the perpetrators and re
mained unpaid, he said.
"We had huge amounts of dam
ages that I couldn't allocate," Her
rling said. "Nobody came forward
to pay their damages."
Nevertheless, Wais said be
cause of the collective responsibil
ity expected from all fraternity
members, the eviction was proper.
He added that there was substan
tial information that more than
one (member | was made aware" of
the debt.
"Collective responsibility has
to take precedence," Wais said.
"The fraternity . . . appeared to


Wais
blame everything on one individ
ual."
The house, located at 353
Campus Drive, will be available
as a coed, self-operational resi
dence to students on the winter
quarter Draw waiting list. Delt
members will be placed random
ly in the Draw, but are prohibit
ed from living in their former
house.
The decision, Lippert said, all

but ensures the breakup of the
fraternity, realistically if not tech
nically. While most members will
enter the Draw, they concurrently
plan to search for off-campus resi
dences if they receive an undesir
able residence. Because members
surrendered their preferred years
to live in the fraternity house,
most will draw unpreferred, and
some older members will draw
unguaranteed.
"Effectively, we're going to be
hurting," Lippert said. "This is a
house-oriented fraternity. Even
thing around the Delts surrounds
the Delt house. This is not a

group of guys that will get togeth
er and practice Greek ceremonies
on their own."
Although Lippert praised
Wais for his fairness, he and
other Delt members were upset
with the rationale of the deci
sion.
"These new people in the
administration see the black and
white that the Delts owe
$41,000," said Liu, referring to
Wais and Camarillo, in their first
year at Stanford. "They didn't
know [all] the stuff that was going
on. They had the impression that
we knew about the debt."
