# Delt house dealt death blow
## It's official: Frat to lose its house at end of fall quarter 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
University officials yesterday
rejected an appeal by the Delta
Tan Delta fraternity, upholding
the decision to evict the Delts from
their house following this quarter.
In a three-page letter released
yesterday, Dean of Students Marc
Wais and Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo said the
appeal produced no new informa
tion, claiming that the fraternity
achieved only four of 10 goals
mandated in March for the Delts
to maintain their residence.
The appeal "did not persuade
us to change our mind," Wais said
in an interview, calling the frater
nity's $41,000 debt — which Delt
members argued was the only rea
son for the eviction — "a signifi
cant factor."
"These facts clearly demon
strate the University's concerted
efforts to keep the fraternity

aware of its fi
nancial obliga
tion," Wais and
Camarillo wrote
in the letter.
"These facts
clearly refute
Delta Tau Delta's
assertion that we
acted upon inac
curate informa
tion."

Delt members contended in
their appeal that former treasurer
Erik Herrling failed to inform
other members about the accruing
debt. When Wais and Camarillo
originally decided Sept. 26 to evict
the fraternity, most members
thought all accounts with the Uni
versity were balanced, Delt Presi
dent iMark Lippert said.
"The treasurer miscominuni
cated to the officers," Lippert said.
"There was miscommunication
about the size of the debt."
Delt member Roger Liu con

curred: "Apparently he knew
about the debt and didn't tell any
one."
Herrling, however, said he
never knew of the debt until late
August. When the University
charged the Delts for last year's
damages, the bills were never allo
cated to the perpetrators and re
mained unpaid, he said.
"We had huge amounts of dam
ages that I couldn't allocate," Her
rling said. "Nobody came forward
to pay their damages."
Nevertheless, Wais said be
cause of the collective responsibil
ity expected from all fraternity
members, the eviction was proper.
He added that there was substan
tial information that more than
one (member | was made aware" of
the debt.
"Collective responsibility has
to take precedence," Wais said.
"The fraternity . . . appeared to
