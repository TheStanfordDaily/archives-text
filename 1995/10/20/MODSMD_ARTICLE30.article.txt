# Women's soccer to renew Maloney magic
## 
### Hobby Cuza Contributing writer 
Pacific 10 Conference supremacy will be on
the line this weekend when USC (7-5-1 over
all, 2-2 Pac-10) and No. 21 UCLA (11-1-2, 5-0)
roll into town to face the ninth-ranked Stan
ford women's soccer team (10-3, 2-0).
The Cardinal hopes to bounce back quickly
from its 2-1 win over St. Mary's last Wednes
day, in which the women showed obvious
signs of fatigue.
"It was a weird game," said Stanford head
coach lan Sawyers. "We played very well in
the first half hour of the game and then our
legs went. I think it was just a general fatigue

'It'd be nice to get another
Pac-10 trophy, but in realist
ic terms, it's not as import
ant that we win the Pac-10.'
— lan Sawyers

— maybe a midseason situation. In games like
that, if you can come out with a win, that's a
very important thing for our team psychologi
cally."
The women will find little time to rest this

weekend. Stanford faces the Trojans this
morning at 11 a.m. in its first contest on the
Farm since top-ranked North Carolina
snapped the Cardinal's 21-game home win
ning streak three weeks ago. The Cardinal
then battles UCLA on Sunday, also at 11 a.m.
"Rest is going to be a key factor," Sawyers
said. "In between those [two matchesl, we're
just going to have to loosen up and stretch and
make sure the kids are healthy."
Because the Pac-10 champion does not
receive an automatic qualifying bid for the
NCAA playoffs this year, this weekend's
games hold little meaning in terms of postsea-
son play. Nonetheless, the winner
(if Sunday's game will have the
inside track on the conference title
and Pac-10 bragging rights.
"It'd be nice to get another Pac
-10 trophy, hut in realistic terms,
it's not as important that wc> win
the Pac-10," Sawyers said. "It's
more important we win the games
and get some good momentum
going into the last part of the sea
son."
Stanford continues to rely on
talented senior midfielder Carmel
Murphy to provide scoring punch.
Her first-half goal in Wednesday's
match gave her a team-leading
total of 24 points (10 goals, four
assists).
Defense also continues to be a
strong suit for the Cardinal. Thir
teen matches into the season,
Stanford has allowed only 83
shots, an average of 6.4 per game.
Fresh man goalkeeper Erin Bryla
boasts a 0.84 goals-against average
and has recorded seven shutouts.
UCLA played one of its best
games of the year last season in a
1-1 tie against Stanford, rank<xl
third in the nation at the time.
I \SC, on the other hand, suffered a
10-0 humiliation at the hands of
the Cardinal in their last meeting
two years ago.
Tara Koleski leads the Trojans
offensively with 27 points (nine
goals, nine assists). UClj\, mean
while, relies on sophomore Trad
Arkenberg, who leads the team
with 32 points (13 goals, six
assists). She has registered a goal
or an assist in 12 of UCLA's 14
matches.
"I'd love for us to be finishing
better," said Sawyers of the team's
recent difficulties in putting games
away. "But we're winning, and as
long as we keep winning and the
kids keep being successful at what
we're trying to achieve, that's
great."
