# Cardinal men out to kick unsuccessful streak
## 
### Alan Eaton Contributing writer 
It's time for the Stanford
men's soccer team to put up a
good fight, score some goals and,
most importantly, win. The Car
dinal (3-8-1 overall, 0-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) hasn't
won a game since Sept. 10, a
st retch of eight games.
Yet, if it can win its two league
games at home this weekend
against Sacramento State and Air
Force, it still has a chance to make
the league tournament. Stan
ford's last game against Fresno
State proved extremely competi
tive, and the Cardinal had a
chance to win but couldn't pull
out the victory
"I felt it was one of our better
games," said Stanford coach Colin
Lindorcs. "Our players showed

their frustration after the loss,
something they hadn't done in a
while." The frustration translat
ed into a week of focused practice
for the Cardinal, which needs to
win.
Today the Cardinal opens a
weekend homestand against divi
sion rival Sac State (4-8-1, 0-4-1)
at 4 p.m. at Maloney Field. Sun
day at 3:00, the Stanford team
will continue defending its home
turf against the Falcons of Air
Force (7-5-1, 2-3).
I'he Sacramento State team
has a winless streak of its own.
Although it only stretches four
games back, it has come against
some of the same teams that have
encouraged Stanford's anemic
streak.
The Hornets are led by senior


Sasha Mitelman — Daily file
Sophomore Jeff Szekeres avoids an outstretched Gael, although the
Cardinal could not circumvent a 3-1 defeat at the hands of St. Mary's.
"We've been looking at the
schemes and the plays they run,"
Ogden said. "It's pretty much the
same deal as always. Hopefully,
they won't switch things up
much."
In addition to opening up holes
for Abdul-Jabbar, the line must
also protect the tentatively sched
uled starter at quarterback, true
freshman Cade McNown. The
Cardinal game plan may call for
rattling the young McNown early.
"I'd like to get a sack on the
first play, or at least hit him,"
White said. "It's important. If
he's thinking about getting hit, it
will affect his performance. The
younger someone is, the easier it
is to break his confidence."
Junior Ryan Fien should also
see some time at the helm tomor
row. Fien, the team's starter at
the beginning of the year, has
proved ineffective, forcing Don
ahue to call upon the inexperi
enced McNown. The two have
been splitting time thus far in
1995. Neither has dazzled oppo
nents, and the Bruins rank ninth
in the conference in passing
offense.

Senior flanker Kevin Jordan
has caught most of the passes the
quarterbacks have completed. He
currently ranks fourth in the Pac
-10 in receptions with 32 and sixth
in receiving yardage at 71.3 yards
per game. No other Bruin receiv
er has caught more than 12 balls.
Defensively, the squad has
been playing without its premier
player and leading tackier in
1994, senior outside linebacker
Donnie Edwards. The preseason
All-American missed most of the
past four games, the first three
with three cracked vertebrae and
the last due to a NCAA suspen
sion. Donahue still believes the
back injury will limit Edwards'
play tomorrow.
"I do not anticipate that he will
see extensive action this week,"
Donahue said. "He's our best
defensive player and it's impor
tant to get him back out there.
I'm just not convinced right now
that he's healthy."
In Edwards' absence, junior
Abdul McCullough stepped up his
play, leading the team with 49
tackles. Seniors George Kase and
Grady Stretz anchor the defen
sive line. Kase managed 11 tack
les against Arizona and leads the
team with four sacks. Sophomore
free safety Shaun Williams head
lines the secondary.

forward Brandon Cavitt, who
has scored six goals and shared
the ball for six assists. Senior
midfielder Curtis Holmes and
junior forward Jamel Mitchell
have added four goals each.
CSUS' defensive leader is
senior goalkeeper Gary Davis.
Although his goal-against aver
age is a common 2.4, he has
saved 50 balls and more impor
tantly earned three shutouts.
Air Force's high scoring
offense will try to overwhelm

and exploit Stanford's defense
on Sunday. Youth has taken the
reins of the Falcon team. Fresh
man Ryan Schaeffer has explod
ed onto the collegiate level, tied
for the team lead in goals
(seven) with junior midfielder
Matt Anderson. Sophomore for
ward Drew Dougherty has con
tributed six goals and four
assists. To put this bounty of
goals into proportion, Schaeffer
and Anderson's combined 14
goals adds up to one more than
the entire Stanford team's sea
son total.
Senior goalkeeper Matt Men
nell has saved 81 percent of the
shots taken on him this year. He

has two shutouts to his credit
and carries an impressive 1.40
goals-against average.
The Cardinal has a definite
opportunity to pick up a couple
wins this weekend because nei
ther of its opponents has won a
road game yet this season. In
order to win, the Stanford
offense will have to take its
game to a higher level. The Car
dinal has had only two multiple
goal outings for the year. The
admirable play of goalkeepers
Ryan Craig, a junior, and fresh
man Jon Bruck, who carry a
combined goals-against average
of 2.08, has gone unrequited
because Stanford simply has

failed to put the ball in the net.
"Every game we play is a
challenge, and the difficulties
come when we are playing our
selves," said Lindores. "We just
don't have confidence in our
play." The lack of confidence is
understandable considering the
team's inconsistent play, but a
win or two could go a long way
towards restoring the team's
confidence and improving spirit.
The Cardinal has worked
hard during the past two weeks,
playing more aggressively, in
hopes that a rekindled fire of
intensity will carry them down
the season's home stretch as
winners.

come when we are playing our
selves," said Lindores. "We just
don't have confidence in our
play." The lack of confidence is
understandable considering the
team's inconsistent play, but a
win or two could go a long way
towards restoring the team's
confidence and improving spirit.
The Cardinal has worked
hard during the past two weeks,
playing more aggressively, in
hopes that a rekindled fire of
intensity will carry them down
the season's home stretch as
winners.
It's time for the Stanford
men's soccer team to put up a
good fight, score some goals and,
most importantly, win. The Car
dinal (3-8-1 overall, 0-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) hasn't
won a game since Sept. 10, a
st retch of eight games.
Yet, if it can win its two league
games at home this weekend
against Sacramento State and Air
Force, it still has a chance to make
the league tournament. Stan
ford's last game against Fresno
State proved extremely competi
tive, and the Cardinal had a
chance to win but couldn't pull
out the victory
"I felt it was one of our better
games," said Stanford coach Colin
Lindorcs. "Our players showed

their frustration after the loss,
something they hadn't done in a
while." The frustration translat
ed into a week of focused practice
for the Cardinal, which needs to
win.
Today the Cardinal opens a
weekend homestand against divi
sion rival Sac State (4-8-1, 0-4-1)
at 4 p.m. at Maloney Field. Sun
day at 3:00, the Stanford team
will continue defending its home
turf against the Falcons of Air
Force (7-5-1, 2-3).
I'he Sacramento State team
has a winless streak of its own.
Although it only stretches four
games back, it has come against
some of the same teams that have
encouraged Stanford's anemic
streak.
The Hornets are led by senior


Sasha Mitelman — Daily file
Sophomore Jeff Szekeres avoids an outstretched Gael, although the
Cardinal could not circumvent a 3-1 defeat at the hands of St. Mary's.
"We've been looking at the
schemes and the plays they run,"
Ogden said. "It's pretty much the
same deal as always. Hopefully,
they won't switch things up
much."
In addition to opening up holes
for Abdul-Jabbar, the line must
also protect the tentatively sched
uled starter at quarterback, true
freshman Cade McNown. The
Cardinal game plan may call for
rattling the young McNown early.
"I'd like to get a sack on the
first play, or at least hit him,"
White said. "It's important. If
he's thinking about getting hit, it
will affect his performance. The
younger someone is, the easier it
is to break his confidence."
Junior Ryan Fien should also
see some time at the helm tomor
row. Fien, the team's starter at
the beginning of the year, has
proved ineffective, forcing Don
ahue to call upon the inexperi
enced McNown. The two have
been splitting time thus far in
1995. Neither has dazzled oppo
nents, and the Bruins rank ninth
in the conference in passing
offense.

Senior flanker Kevin Jordan
has caught most of the passes the
quarterbacks have completed. He
currently ranks fourth in the Pac
-10 in receptions with 32 and sixth
in receiving yardage at 71.3 yards
per game. No other Bruin receiv
er has caught more than 12 balls.
Defensively, the squad has
been playing without its premier
player and leading tackier in
1994, senior outside linebacker
Donnie Edwards. The preseason
All-American missed most of the
past four games, the first three
with three cracked vertebrae and
the last due to a NCAA suspen
sion. Donahue still believes the
back injury will limit Edwards'
play tomorrow.
"I do not anticipate that he will
see extensive action this week,"
Donahue said. "He's our best
defensive player and it's impor
tant to get him back out there.
I'm just not convinced right now
that he's healthy."
In Edwards' absence, junior
Abdul McCullough stepped up his
play, leading the team with 49
tackles. Seniors George Kase and
Grady Stretz anchor the defen
sive line. Kase managed 11 tack
les against Arizona and leads the
team with four sacks. Sophomore
free safety Shaun Williams head
lines the secondary.

forward Brandon Cavitt, who
has scored six goals and shared
the ball for six assists. Senior
midfielder Curtis Holmes and
junior forward Jamel Mitchell
have added four goals each.
CSUS' defensive leader is
senior goalkeeper Gary Davis.
Although his goal-against aver
age is a common 2.4, he has
saved 50 balls and more impor
tantly earned three shutouts.
Air Force's high scoring
offense will try to overwhelm

and exploit Stanford's defense
on Sunday. Youth has taken the
reins of the Falcon team. Fresh
man Ryan Schaeffer has explod
ed onto the collegiate level, tied
for the team lead in goals
(seven) with junior midfielder
Matt Anderson. Sophomore for
ward Drew Dougherty has con
tributed six goals and four
assists. To put this bounty of
goals into proportion, Schaeffer
and Anderson's combined 14
goals adds up to one more than
the entire Stanford team's sea
son total.
Senior goalkeeper Matt Men
nell has saved 81 percent of the
shots taken on him this year. He

has two shutouts to his credit
and carries an impressive 1.40
goals-against average.
The Cardinal has a definite
opportunity to pick up a couple
wins this weekend because nei
ther of its opponents has won a
road game yet this season. In
order to win, the Stanford
offense will have to take its
game to a higher level. The Car
dinal has had only two multiple
goal outings for the year. The
admirable play of goalkeepers
Ryan Craig, a junior, and fresh
man Jon Bruck, who carry a
combined goals-against average
of 2.08, has gone unrequited
because Stanford simply has

failed to put the ball in the net.
