# Cardinal men out to kick unsuccessful streak
## 
### Alan Eaton Contributing writer 
It's time for the Stanford
men's soccer team to put up a
good fight, score some goals and,
most importantly, win. The Car
dinal (3-8-1 overall, 0-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) hasn't
won a game since Sept. 10, a
st retch of eight games.
Yet, if it can win its two league
games at home this weekend
against Sacramento State and Air
Force, it still has a chance to make
the league tournament. Stan
ford's last game against Fresno
State proved extremely competi
tive, and the Cardinal had a
chance to win but couldn't pull
out the victory
"I felt it was one of our better
games," said Stanford coach Colin
Lindorcs. "Our players showed

their frustration after the loss,
something they hadn't done in a
while." The frustration translat
ed into a week of focused practice
for the Cardinal, which needs to
win.
Today the Cardinal opens a
weekend homestand against divi
sion rival Sac State (4-8-1, 0-4-1)
at 4 p.m. at Maloney Field. Sun
day at 3:00, the Stanford team
will continue defending its home
turf against the Falcons of Air
Force (7-5-1, 2-3).
I'he Sacramento State team
has a winless streak of its own.
Although it only stretches four
games back, it has come against
some of the same teams that have
encouraged Stanford's anemic
streak.
The Hornets are led by senior

Sophomore Jeff Szekeres avoids an outstretched Gael, although the
Cardinal could not circumvent a 3-1 defeat at the hands of St. Mary's.
