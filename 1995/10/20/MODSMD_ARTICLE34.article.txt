# To be young again

### 
Hey kids! Remember when we were?
No? Well, sometimes it's hard, I'll
admit it. I'd forgotten myself until I
was reminded the other day over breakfast.
Well, actually right before breakfast, but more
on that in a minute. The point is, I recently
paused to reflect. And then 1 started to
remember. And then I began to realize that
despite all the glory and glamour of being a
Stanford student in the '90s, there's a lot to
miss about being a kid back in the — well, just
about being a kid. you know? You know what
I mean?
Man, them's was the days . . . so why have
we changed?
Like, for starters, remember toys? Yes,
indeed, toys were (are?) some of the greatest
things on Earth. They were essential they
weren't merely tools of recreation, but often
status symbols among our friends. Oh, sure,
sure — we still have toys you say. Bigger,
faster, more expensive and appropriately so.
But, come on. More can be less fun — my
Autohots never needed gas. Or insurance. Or
repairs.
And don't forget Legos .
I mean, it used to be that when someone
asked what I might want for a present (you
know, on birthdays, Hanukkah, Armistice
Day, etc.) I could unfurl a list longer than 20
rolls of Bubble Tape (Woohoo! Bubble Tape!).
Now I just shrug.
What happened? The littlest things used to
get us going. Cartoons. Holidays. Summer
vacations. And recess. Ha, remember recess?
If you grew up in public school (and according
to Stanford Today, about 75 percent of us
did), then recess was tantamount to a state

imposed study break. Tell me, why should we
have outgrown this?
But back to breakfast — more specifically,
cereal. Okay, here I don't mean cereal, the
sugar-coated grain, but cereal, tin' emotional
state of being. Just read. . . .
The other day I woke up. hopped out of
bed, slipped on my slippers, and — after pick
ing myself back up — pitter-pattered barefoot
to the kitchen (Gotta love the Flow!). There,
my jaw dropped and my heart giggled as I dis
covered before me a whole big dispenser
thingy fulla Froot Loops! Just arrived.
Untouched. You don't understand I could
have as many as I wantedVM
What was so exciting was that I hadn't
touched Loops for years — not since my days
at summer camp when our cabin always tried
to be first at breakfast, lest we get stuck with
bran flakes. So you see, for me (like for Stan
ford women with regards to men) it was not
the prize but the pursuit that was ever so
exhilarating.
So the point, maybe — and really, I apolo
gize for not making it until now — is that
when we hearken back to the days since past,
we can't help but try to inject some of that
happy energy into the present.
Don't get me wrong — being a kid had its
lows. As a pudgy little nerd for the first, oh. 17
years of my life, I know that children can be
the most evil of people, lacking only the tech
nological and political know-how to implement
their designs of world domination and perse
cution. (I've effectively repressed memories of
the most haunting taunting. 'Course I can
never forget the tragic week "Victor Victoria"
hit theaters, but let's |ust not go there, okav?)

Fortunately, though, we can practice the
power of selective memory. All we need to
remember are the feelings, the emotions, the
sensations that can't help but stir when we re
chronicle those childhood chunks of our mem
ories — and realize that those old impulses
never died, they just faded away.
That's all I'm sayin' here. Vou don't need
to hold onto toys or recess or Froot Loops or
Legos (not that 1 would want any of them
modern Legos — like my friend Elliot says,
they've gotten far toq specialized; the spectac
ular synergism of Lego -creation is shattered
once you can only build a castle by using "cas
tle-pieces"). There's no extra effort involved
and there's nothing wrong with being careful
ly carefree, or reject ing apathy in favor of non
chalance (yes. there's a difference). Take it
easy and it will be.
Whoa, am I offering advice here? Darn, I
I hate offering advice because 1 usually hate
taking it. And. hey, you would be well within
your rights to not listen to the blabbering
blatherings of some guy who still doesn't know
what he wants to be if he grows up.
Even so, just remember this: You never see
little kids with gray hair. I'm not sure I know
what 1 mean by that, but just think about it.
And if you do have a clue about what I 've
been saying, go ahead and give it a try, put it
into practice.
Because it 's never too late to have a happy

And don't forget Legos .
I mean, it used to be that when someone
asked what I might want for a present (you
know, on birthdays, Hanukkah, Armistice
Day, etc.) I could unfurl a list longer than 20
rolls of Bubble Tape (Woohoo! Bubble Tape!).
Now I just shrug.
What happened? The littlest things used to
get us going. Cartoons. Holidays. Summer
vacations. And recess. Ha, remember recess?
If you grew up in public school (and according
to Stanford Today, about 75 percent of us
did), then recess was tantamount to a state

imposed study break. Tell me, why should we
have outgrown this?
But back to breakfast — more specifically,
cereal. Okay, here I don't mean cereal, the
sugar-coated grain, but cereal, tin' emotional
state of being. Just read. . . .
The other day I woke up. hopped out of
bed, slipped on my slippers, and — after pick
ing myself back up — pitter-pattered barefoot
to the kitchen (Gotta love the Flow!). There,
my jaw dropped and my heart giggled as I dis
covered before me a whole big dispenser
thingy fulla Froot Loops! Just arrived.
Untouched. You don't understand I could
have as many as I wantedVM
What was so exciting was that I hadn't
touched Loops for years — not since my days
at summer camp when our cabin always tried
to be first at breakfast, lest we get stuck with
bran flakes. So you see, for me (like for Stan
ford women with regards to men) it was not
the prize but the pursuit that was ever so
exhilarating.
So the point, maybe — and really, I apolo
gize for not making it until now — is that
when we hearken back to the days since past,
we can't help but try to inject some of that
happy energy into the present.
Don't get me wrong — being a kid had its
lows. As a pudgy little nerd for the first, oh. 17
years of my life, I know that children can be
the most evil of people, lacking only the tech
nological and political know-how to implement
their designs of world domination and perse
cution. (I've effectively repressed memories of
the most haunting taunting. 'Course I can
never forget the tragic week "Victor Victoria"
hit theaters, but let's |ust not go there, okav?)

Fortunately, though, we can practice the
power of selective memory. All we need to
remember are the feelings, the emotions, the
sensations that can't help but stir when we re
chronicle those childhood chunks of our mem
ories — and realize that those old impulses
never died, they just faded away.
That's all I'm sayin' here. Vou don't need
to hold onto toys or recess or Froot Loops or
Legos (not that 1 would want any of them
modern Legos — like my friend Elliot says,
they've gotten far toq specialized; the spectac
ular synergism of Lego -creation is shattered
once you can only build a castle by using "cas
tle-pieces"). There's no extra effort involved
and there's nothing wrong with being careful
ly carefree, or reject ing apathy in favor of non
chalance (yes. there's a difference). Take it
easy and it will be.
Whoa, am I offering advice here? Darn, I
I hate offering advice because 1 usually hate
taking it. And. hey, you would be well within
your rights to not listen to the blabbering
blatherings of some guy who still doesn't know
what he wants to be if he grows up.
Even so, just remember this: You never see
little kids with gray hair. I'm not sure I know
what 1 mean by that, but just think about it.
And if you do have a clue about what I 've
been saying, go ahead and give it a try, put it
into practice.
Because it 's never too late to have a happy
