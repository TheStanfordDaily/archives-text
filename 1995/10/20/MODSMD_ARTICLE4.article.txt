# Architects present Sand Hill plans
## 
### Sonia M. Giordani Staff writer 
The saga of Sand Hill Road contin
ued yesterday, as Palo Alto's Architec
tural Review Board (ARB) and about 30
interested community members scruti
nized the Sand Hill Corridor Projects
and questioned the architects and de
signers.
The projects, proposed by the Stan
ford Management Company, include
the expansion and development of the
Stanford Shopping Center and the con
struction of two residential complexes
off Sand Hill Road — Stanford West
Apartments, a 630-unit complex, and
Stanford West Senior Housing, a senior
housing complex with approximately
500 units.

I he ARB s three-member panel ex
pressed overall consent with the archi
tectural plans presented in this second
preliminary hearing on the issue. But
Palo Alto residents raised concerns re
garding the impact that such major de
velopment projects could have on their
standard of living.
The Sand Hill Corridor Project will
bring "an increase in the volume of peo
ple and business, and will erode the
quality of life," said Shirley Beck, an
employee of the Registrar's ()ffice and a
resident of Oak Creek Apartment s.
The proposed shopping center ex
pansion would add 160,000 square feet
of new retail space to the mall. The pro
ject aims to keep with the shopping cen
ter's "village character," maintain the
mall's open space and landscape, en

hance pedestrian connections within
the shopping center and improve vehic
ular circulation, said architect Donn
Logan of Elbasani & Logan Architects.
Moreover, development includes
pedestrian walkways and other links to
the proposed residential complexes
planned for the north side of Sand Hill
Road.
Another key — and contested — ele
ment of the proposal is the connection
of Sand Hill Road, which currently ter
minates at the edge of the shopping cen
ter, to El Camino Real.
The extension of Sand Hill into a
thoroughfare will keep "poachers" from
driving through the parking lot to get
from the end of Sand Hill to El Camino,
Logan said.
And the plan inay also stream
line traffic on the congested road.
But some residents raise other
concerns. The plan does not take
into consideration "the quality of
life for those in the areas .. . |who
arel denigrated by the pollution
and noise," said Arthur Brown, a
resident of Oak Creek Apartments.
Claudio Martinez, another Palo
Alto resident who attended the
meeting, noted the possibility of an
archaeological site being impacted
by the road and the residential pro
jects.
The road's extension has also
raised environmental concerns.
"We have been historically
opposed to the connection of Sand
Hill Road to El Camino," said

Camus Hubenthal, a legislative
advocate of the Committee for
Green Foothills in Palo Alto.
The organization's major con
cerns are for San Francisquito
Creek and the implications of the
increased traffic expected from the
projects.
"It is the only creek in the coun
ty that runs its natural course from
source to bay," Hubenthal said.
On top of the three development
projects, Hubenthal added, the
Medical Center intends to propose
an expansion of 400,000 square feet.
But the future of the shopping
center largely depends on Measure
R, a local proposition that will
appear on the Nov. 7 ballot. If
passed, the measure would retain a
1989 non-residential growth limit
for the shopping center's expan
sion. Notably, Measure R was
placed on the ballot as a result of a
petition signed by more than 4,000
Palo Alto residents concerned about

the effect that mall expansion
would have on traffic congestion.
Board Member Julie Maser
asked what would happen if Propo
sition R passes in the Nov. 7 vote.
"Then the expansion we are
talking about will be capped," said
William Phillips, managing direc
tor of projects at Stanford Manage
ment Company.
Stanford has donated a $19,000
telephone survey to a group called
"Citizens for Palo Alto's Future"
that is fighting the measure's
approval.
All concerned are awaiting an
environmental impact report on all
of the Sand Hill Corridor projects
— due to be issued in January —
before arriving at an assessment of
the projects and their viability.
The report will be studied by the
ARB in another hearing, when the
projects will be considered for
action before moving on to the
planning commission.
