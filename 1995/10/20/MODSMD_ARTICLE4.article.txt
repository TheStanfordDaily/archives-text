The saga of Sand Hill Road contin
ued yesterday, as Palo Alto's Architec
tural Review Board (ARB) and about 30
interested community members scruti
nized the Sand Hill Corridor Projects
and questioned the architects and de
signers.
The projects, proposed by the Stan
ford Management Company, include
the expansion and development of the
Stanford Shopping Center and the con
struction of two residential complexes
off Sand Hill Road — Stanford West
Apartments, a 630-unit complex, and
Stanford West Senior Housing, a senior
housing complex with approximately
500 units.

I he ARB s three-member panel ex
pressed overall consent with the archi
tectural plans presented in this second
preliminary hearing on the issue. But
Palo Alto residents raised concerns re
garding the impact that such major de
velopment projects could have on their
standard of living.
The Sand Hill Corridor Project will
bring "an increase in the volume of peo
ple and business, and will erode the
quality of life," said Shirley Beck, an
employee of the Registrar's ()ffice and a
resident of Oak Creek Apartment s.
The proposed shopping center ex
pansion would add 160,000 square feet
of new retail space to the mall. The pro
ject aims to keep with the shopping cen
ter's "village character," maintain the
mall's open space and landscape, en

hance pedestrian connections within
the shopping center and improve vehic
ular circulation, said architect Donn
Logan of Elbasani & Logan Architects.
Moreover, development includes
pedestrian walkways and other links to
the proposed residential complexes
planned for the north side of Sand Hill
Road.
Another key — and contested — ele
ment of the proposal is the connection
of Sand Hill Road, which currently ter
minates at the edge of the shopping cen
ter, to El Camino Real.
The extension of Sand Hill into a
thoroughfare will keep "poachers" from
driving through the parking lot to get
from the end of Sand Hill to El Camino,
