# LGBCC to form first advisory board
## Center aims to strengthen relations, plan for its financial future 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
For the first time in its history,
Stanford's Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center is on the verge of
forming an advisory board that will
create a stronger relationship between
students, faculty, staff and alumni
communities.
The board aims "to forge a future
direction for the organization, in
hopes of figuring out how best to serve
student needs," said Troy Gilbert, as
sistant director of student activities
and adviser to the community center.
Due in large part to a steady rise in
alumni contributions to the communi
ty center's development fund, the cre
ation of the advisory board marks an
important turning point in a trend to

ward increased involvement of facul
ty, staff and alumni to the primarily
student-run organization.
After nearly a year of extensive
planning, the board — which will con
sist of five faculty / staff members,
two students and two alumni — will
meet within the next month to initiate
discussion on how best to allocate the
community center's growing pool of
funds.
The increase in alumni donations is
matched by an increasingly vocal pres
ence of proactive gay alumni who
channel their energies into promoting
awareness of issues affecting their
communities on and off campus.
"Alumni have been becoming more
and more active [overl the past four
years," Gilbert said, noting an expan
sion of the community center's mail

ing lists, contributions to programs in
the annual Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Days (BGLAD) and other
outgrowth efforts aimed to broaden
community discourse.
Gilbert said he hopes the advisory
board will seize the opportunity of
fered by the strong support of gay
alumni to "prioritize the needs of the
LGBCC," in turn encouraging in
creased student input in financial,
programming and other organization
al decisions.
Carla Dunn — program coordina
tor of the Disabilities Resource Cen
ter, who will serve as the board's chair
— said she hopes these discussions
will elicit attention to larger issues
pertinent to the community center's
luture, such as creating leader
ship training opportunities,
expanding the programming
agenda and becoming more
involved with a greater variety of
student and faculty organiza
tions on campus.
Increased awareness and
exchange, Dunn added, might
encourage more members of the
Stanford community to serve as

mentors to gay, lesbian and
bisexual students seeking per
sonal and potential career advice
on how best to confront the pres
sures and prejudices of the real
world. Mentors could also prove
to be valuable resources for stu
dents pursuing research projects
on gay issues, Dunn said.
Although Dunn is enthusias
tic about the increase in facul
ty, staff and alumni involve
ment with the community cen
ter, she insisted that the advi
sory board's endeavors will
focus on supporting and cater

ing to the needs expressed by
students.
"Students are the ones who
should lead the programming
and give us direction about
where their interests and goals
are so that we can respond effec
tively to those interests," Dunn
said.
Extolling this year's student
staff, Dunn said that "this fall
feels very exciting. The staff is
very welcoming, energized and is
staying aware of students" and
their feelings about being queer at
Stanford.
