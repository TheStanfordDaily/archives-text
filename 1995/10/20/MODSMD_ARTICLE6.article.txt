# 3 organs are heart of church
## 
### Dee Ann Durbin 
In 1899, during the con
struction of Memorial Church,
Jane Stanford wrote, "While
my whole heart is this Univer
sity, my soul is in that church."
Now, almost a hundred
years later, some would argue
that the soul of that church
lies in its organs.
It is difficult to match the
experience of standing within
Memorial Church's ornate
nave listening to one of its
three organs. They have differ
ent but complementary char
acters: the large and thunder
ous Fisk-Nanney, the lighter,
French-influenced Murray
Harris and the small, Renais
sance-styled Potter-Brinegar.
Together, they are some of
Stanford's finest treasures.
The Fisk-Nanney and the
Potter-Brinegar will be fea
tured tonight when French or
ganist Jean Boyer opens the
1995-96 Memorial Church
organ series. The concert be
gins at 8 p.m.
This morning, however, the
church is dark and hushed.
Beth Harrison, lecturer of
organ at Stanford, describes
each instrument diplomatical
ly, but soon reveals a particu-

lar fondness for the Fisk-Nanney.
It's not hard to see why this
organ is Harrison's favorite. The
glorious instrument, boxed in
poplar, is painted in deep reds and
blues. Its 4,332 pipes, lining the
walls of the loft, are made of glint
ing lead and tin. The organ domi
nates the back of the church, rising
far above the center aisle.
The Fisk-Nanney has a fascinat
ing history. It was designed by a Stan
ford alumnus, Charles Fisk, who
came to Stanford in 1950 to receive a
Ph.D. in nuclear physics. Though
he already had a BAin physics from
Harvard and had worked on the
Manhattan Project during World
War 11, Fisk's career path changed
dramatically at Stanford.
After a visit to Memorial
Church, Fisk became fascinated by
the organ and soon switched his
major to music. Once he had

earned his degree, he worked for a
variety of organ builders. By 1961,
Fisk had opened C.B. Fisk, Inc., an
organ-building company in
Clouoester, Mass.
In 1983, Fisk died of radiation
poisoning from his work on the
bomb. One year later, his organ
was installed in Memorial Church
and named in honor of Fisk and
University Organist Kmeritus Her
bert Nanney.
Fisk was the first American
organ builder to base his designs on
historical models. The result: Stan
ford's Fisk-Nanney organ is one of
two organs in the world that can be
played in two historical tuning sys
tems, meantone and well-tem
pered. Meantone was the tuning
system used primarily during the
17th century, while the well-tem
pered was in vogue during Bach's
lifetime in the 18th century.
While the differences can be
boggling for the organ illiterate,
the well-tempered octave consists
of 12 equally-spaced tones, allow
ing the instrument to play in all

keys. The meantone, however, is
tempered at different intervals, so
that some keys are in tune hut oth
ers are not. Harrison admits that
it's far from a perfect science.
"The well-tempered is not exact,
but it's close," she says. "Bach was
also fiddling with it."
Three of the organ's four manu
als, or keyboards, are fixed to play
in both well-tempered and mean
tone (the fourth plays only in
meantone). The change in tuning
is managed by a special lever which
switches all three manuals. Five
extra pipes per octave, one for each
"black" key, make the transition
possible.
Because the instrument is so his
torically accurate, one of Harrison's
greatest joys is performing Baroque
music on it. Afler spending three
years teaching and studying at the
North German Organ Academy,
Harrison specializes in northern
European Baroque music.
"This is probably the one Amer
ican organ that 1 like," Harrison
admits.

J he organ s design was heavily
influenced by the organs of eastern
and northern Germany. The Ger
man sound is particularly identifi
able by the "speech" of the pipes,
Harrison says. Germany's Luther
an choral traditions required the
pipes to Ik? nicked in such a way
that then* would be a heavy conso
nant sound at the beginning of
each note. This was intended to
help the congregation find its
notes, Harrison says.
Because the Gatholic Ghurch
did not rely on choral singing,
French organs developed a differ
ent sound. The Murray Harris
organ, which shares the organ loft
with the Fisk-Nanney, was built in
the French Romantic tradition.
Memorial Church's original organ,
the Murray Harris was built by the
Murray M. Harris Co. in 1901. The
organ was rebuilt in 1925, expand
ed in 1933 and restored in 1995. It
has 3,702 pipes.
One of the greatest distinctions
between the Murray Harris and
the Fisk-Nanney is the manner in

which the pipes operate. On the
Murray Harris, an electric organ,
electric currents cause magnets to
open the pipes. The Fisk-Nanney,
however, is all mechanical, with its
pipes opened by long strips of wood
called trackers. Trackers reach
from the keys to the pipe valves.
To see the third organ, which
arrived two weeks ago, we walk
downstairs to the small Side
Chapel. This organ, built by Paul
Fritz of Seattle and named in honor
of organ donor Katherine Potter-
Hrinegar, is built in the style of
Renaissance-era organs. Intended
to fit into small spaces, the key
board and 429 pipes are contained
in a cabinet-like structure. The
instrument plays in mean tone and
has a sharp, quick quality.
The diversity of the organs in
the church has been particularly
good for students, Harrison says.
Because Memorial Church's
schedule is crowded, however, stu
dents can not practice in the
church as often as Harrison would
like them to.

Currently, Harrison has 20
organ students at Stanford. Work
ing with students is exciting, she
said, because often they have want
ed to play the organ for a long time
but never had the opportunity.
Also, she loves the reactions she
gets from students who have
played on mediocre instruments
and suddenly discover the fine
organs at Stanford.
Chris Angel, a sophomore, is
one of Harrison's students. A five
year organ veteran. Angel began
playing in his small church at home
on a dare from his priest. Angel
played piano but soon found an
organ teacher instead. He now
takes weekly private lessons with
Harrison and practices three to
four hours a week on organs in the
Braun Music Center.
"It's not every day you have this
huge edifice to practice in," Angel
says, looking around Memorial
Church in awe. With a little more
practice, Angel hopes to play some
preludes for Catholic mass in the
near future.

historical models. The result: Stan
ford's Fisk-Nanney organ is one of
two organs in the world that can be
played in two historical tuning sys
tems, meantone and well-tem
pered. Meantone was the tuning
system used primarily during the
17th century, while the well-tem
pered was in vogue during Bach's
lifetime in the 18th century.
While the differences can be
boggling for the organ illiterate,
the well-tempered octave consists
of 12 equally-spaced tones, allow
ing the instrument to play in all

keys. The meantone, however, is
tempered at different intervals, so
that some keys are in tune hut oth
ers are not. Harrison admits that
it's far from a perfect science.
"The well-tempered is not exact,
but it's close," she says. "Bach was
also fiddling with it."
Three of the organ's four manu
als, or keyboards, are fixed to play
in both well-tempered and mean
tone (the fourth plays only in
meantone). The change in tuning
is managed by a special lever which
switches all three manuals. Five
extra pipes per octave, one for each
"black" key, make the transition
possible.
Because the instrument is so his
torically accurate, one of Harrison's
greatest joys is performing Baroque
music on it. Afler spending three
years teaching and studying at the
North German Organ Academy,
Harrison specializes in northern
European Baroque music.
"This is probably the one Amer
ican organ that 1 like," Harrison
admits.

J he organ s design was heavily
influenced by the organs of eastern
and northern Germany. The Ger
man sound is particularly identifi
able by the "speech" of the pipes,
Harrison says. Germany's Luther
an choral traditions required the
pipes to Ik? nicked in such a way
that then* would be a heavy conso
nant sound at the beginning of
each note. This was intended to
help the congregation find its
notes, Harrison says.
Because the Gatholic Ghurch
did not rely on choral singing,
French organs developed a differ
ent sound. The Murray Harris
organ, which shares the organ loft
with the Fisk-Nanney, was built in
the French Romantic tradition.
Memorial Church's original organ,
the Murray Harris was built by the
Murray M. Harris Co. in 1901. The
organ was rebuilt in 1925, expand
ed in 1933 and restored in 1995. It
has 3,702 pipes.
One of the greatest distinctions
between the Murray Harris and
the Fisk-Nanney is the manner in

which the pipes operate. On the
Murray Harris, an electric organ,
electric currents cause magnets to
open the pipes. The Fisk-Nanney,
however, is all mechanical, with its
pipes opened by long strips of wood
called trackers. Trackers reach
from the keys to the pipe valves.
To see the third organ, which
arrived two weeks ago, we walk
downstairs to the small Side
Chapel. This organ, built by Paul
Fritz of Seattle and named in honor
of organ donor Katherine Potter-
Hrinegar, is built in the style of
Renaissance-era organs. Intended
to fit into small spaces, the key
board and 429 pipes are contained
in a cabinet-like structure. The
instrument plays in mean tone and
has a sharp, quick quality.
The diversity of the organs in
the church has been particularly
good for students, Harrison says.
Because Memorial Church's
schedule is crowded, however, stu
dents can not practice in the
church as often as Harrison would
like them to.

Currently, Harrison has 20
organ students at Stanford. Work
ing with students is exciting, she
said, because often they have want
ed to play the organ for a long time
but never had the opportunity.
Also, she loves the reactions she
gets from students who have
played on mediocre instruments
and suddenly discover the fine
organs at Stanford.
Chris Angel, a sophomore, is
one of Harrison's students. A five
year organ veteran. Angel began
playing in his small church at home
on a dare from his priest. Angel
played piano but soon found an
organ teacher instead. He now
takes weekly private lessons with
Harrison and practices three to
four hours a week on organs in the
Braun Music Center.
"It's not every day you have this
huge edifice to practice in," Angel
says, looking around Memorial
Church in awe. With a little more
practice, Angel hopes to play some
preludes for Catholic mass in the
near future.
In 1899, during the con
struction of Memorial Church,
Jane Stanford wrote, "While
my whole heart is this Univer
sity, my soul is in that church."
Now, almost a hundred
years later, some would argue
that the soul of that church
lies in its organs.
It is difficult to match the
experience of standing within
Memorial Church's ornate
nave listening to one of its
three organs. They have differ
ent but complementary char
acters: the large and thunder
ous Fisk-Nanney, the lighter,
French-influenced Murray
Harris and the small, Renais
sance-styled Potter-Brinegar.
Together, they are some of
Stanford's finest treasures.
The Fisk-Nanney and the
Potter-Brinegar will be fea
tured tonight when French or
ganist Jean Boyer opens the
1995-96 Memorial Church
organ series. The concert be
gins at 8 p.m.
This morning, however, the
church is dark and hushed.

organ at Stanford, describes

lar fondness for the Fisk-Nanney.
It's not hard to see why this
organ is Harrison's favorite. The
glorious instrument, boxed in
poplar, is painted in deep reds and
blues. Its 4,332 pipes, lining the
walls of the loft, are made of glint
ing lead and tin. The organ domi
nates the back of the church, rising
far above the center aisle.
The Fisk-Nanney has a fascinat
ing history. It was designed by a Stan
ford alumnus, Charles Fisk, who
came to Stanford in 1950 to receive a
Ph.D. in nuclear physics. Though
he already had a BAin physics from
Harvard and had worked on the
Manhattan Project during World
War 11, Fisk's career path changed
dramatically at Stanford.
After a visit to Memorial
Church, Fisk became fascinated by
the organ and soon switched his
major to music. Once he had

earned his degree, he worked for a
variety of organ builders. By 1961,
Fisk had opened C.B. Fisk, Inc., an
organ-building company in
Clouoester, Mass.
In 1983, Fisk died of radiation
poisoning from his work on the
bomb. One year later, his organ
was installed in Memorial Church
and named in honor of Fisk and
University Organist Kmeritus Her
bert Nanney.
