Then and Now
Norton Lectures in Science and Society
at the San Francisco Art Institute
The San Francisco Art Institute and W.W. Norton &
Company have initiated a series of public lectures featuring
prominent scientists and science historians beginning
Tuesday, October 24. Focusing on topics ranging from science
to technology to societal concerns, the Norton Lectures in
Science and Society will bring innovative scientific practition
ers from across the country to the Art Institute campus. Each
year two lecturers, selected for their eminence in their field,
will present three to four lectures each, which will augment
courses offered through the Art Institute's Letter and
Sciences Program. W.W. Norton & Company will publish the
contents of these lectures as single-topic books for a general
audience.
The first speaker in the Norton Lecture Series in Science
and Society will be James L. Adams, an internationally rec
ognized professor at the School of Engineering at Stanford
University and former chair of the university's Program in
Values, Technology, Science and Society. Adams will speak
on "Science and Technology — Then and Now,' 1 in a series of
three presentations. On October 24 Adams will speak on
"Technology: How it has evolved, how we can learn from the
past." On November 7 Adams will address "The Human
Aspect of the Scientific Enterprise." Adams' lectures will
The
conclude with a November 21 presentation on
Audience: Lives Shaped by Science and Technology."
Trained as an engineer at the California Institute of
Technology and Stanford University, Adams also studied art
at the University of California, Los Angeles. He has taught
courses ranging from mechanical and product design to orga
nizational creativity and the emotional aspects of technology.
Adams was involved in the design of the first Venus and Mars
spacecraft while working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratories
in Pasadena. The author of numerous articles on engineering
design, engineering education, remote control, and creativity
and problem-solving, Adams has also written several books,
including Conceptual; The Care and Feeding of Ideas; and
Flying Buttresses, Entropy; and O-Rings.
All Norton Lectures in Science and Society will be pre
