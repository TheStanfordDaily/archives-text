# Spring Musical canceled
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron 
Ram's Head, Stanford's oldest
student theatrical group, has
canceled its Spring Musical for
this season.
Currently in its 78th season,
Ram's Head has traditionally
produced three major shows per
year: Big Game Gaieties, Original
Winter One Acts and an annual
Spring Musical.
Other than a five-year period
between 1971 and 1976, when
Ram's Head temporarily shut
down, the spring show has never
before been canceled.
The Ram's Head board of di
rectors decided two weeks ago to
cancel the musical, which was
originally scheduled to be "Merri
ly We Roll Along." According to
senior Laura Wilson, Ram's Head
executive producer, Ram's Head
is "in the process of choosing a
new show," which is scheduled to
be a modern comedy.
Wilson said the musical's can
cellation was "mostly a money
issue, tied to the show not being
well received."
Junior Karen Brecher, a mem
ber of the Ram's Head board of
directors, simply said that "there
wasn't enough response tc make
it worthwhile."
Ram's Head is financed almost
entirely by ticket revenues and
receives no funding from the Uni
versity. Revenues from Gaieties
and Winter One Acts carry
through to the Spring Musical,
which usually loses money.
The cost of putting on the
Spring Musical is immense.
According to Wilson, rights
charges, at $5,000, are "ridicu
lous," while supervision charges
for use of Memorial Auditorium
cost the group another $7,000.
With props, costumes and light
ing added in, costs usually total in
the mid-$30,000 range. Last
year's Spring Musical, "Once On
This Island," cost $33,000.

Brecher, who directed last
year's musical, said costs of pro
duction "go up phenomenally every
year." On average, equipment
costs increase 50 percent per year.
According to Brecher, Ram's
Head "feels strongly about not
raising the price of tickets." Cur
rently, tickets are $8 for students
and senior citizens and $15 for
general admission. Trying to keep
up with inflation while still mak
ing sure students can come has
led to the organization's financial
difficulties.
Many members of Ram's Head
are frustrated with the financial

demands the University places on
the organization because of its
student group status. Wilson said
that "if the University didn't
force Events and Services to
charge a student group who
wants to keep the arts alive at
Stanford, we wouldn't have been
forced to cancel the show."
Lois Wagner, director of Stan
ford Events, said Ram's Head
pays direct costs — such as lights
and other utilities — for use of
Memorial Auditorium. She added
that "they are treated like any
other organization."
Senior Salma Qarnain, a mem

ber of the Ram's Head board of
directors, said she believes "it is a
shame that this tradition that has
been on campus for so long has to
be canceled because of lack of sup
port by the University.'
However, she is "excited about
bringing up a play which will be
less of a financial burden."
The new show will be in a
smaller venue than Memorial
Auditorium — possibly Ricker
Dining and Performance Center
or the Toyon Lounge. A selection
committee will narrow down
choices to a final choice in the
next two weeks.
