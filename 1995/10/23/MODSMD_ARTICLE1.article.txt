# Spring Musical canceled
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron 
Ram's Head, Stanford's oldest
student theatrical group, has
canceled its Spring Musical for
this season.
Currently in its 78th season,
Ram's Head has traditionally
produced three major shows per
year: Big Game Gaieties, Original
Winter One Acts and an annual
Spring Musical.
Other than a five-year period
between 1971 and 1976, when
Ram's Head temporarily shut
down, the spring show has never
before been canceled.
The Ram's Head board of di
rectors decided two weeks ago to
cancel the musical, which was
originally scheduled to be "Merri
ly We Roll Along." According to
senior Laura Wilson, Ram's Head
executive producer, Ram's Head
is "in the process of choosing a
new show," which is scheduled to
be a modern comedy.
Wilson said the musical's can
cellation was "mostly a money
issue, tied to the show not being
well received."
Junior Karen Brecher, a mem
ber of the Ram's Head board of
directors, simply said that "there
wasn't enough response tc make
it worthwhile."
Ram's Head is financed almost
entirely by ticket revenues and
receives no funding from the Uni
versity. Revenues from Gaieties
and Winter One Acts carry
through to the Spring Musical,
which usually loses money.
