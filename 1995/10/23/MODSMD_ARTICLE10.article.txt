# Israel to begin withdrawal
## 
### 
JENIN, West Bank (AP) — Israel's disengage
ment from the lives of West Bank Palestinians will
begin this week in a field of plowed red dirt.
There is little evidenee here yet of the impending
transfer of power to the Palestinians, supposed to
start on Wednesday. The district coordination
office for Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police
hasn't even been built.
And there are few signs of rejoicing in Jenin, the
first city Israeli troops will vacate as part of the
expansion of Palestinian self-rule in the West
Bank.
"People here still have doubts that Israel will
really pull out," said 27-year-old Amjad Asmar as
he strolled through Jenin's crowded marketplace.
Like many Palestinians, Asmar expressed a mix
ture of hope and apprehension about the future
after the Israelis leave.
"There will be a real change here," he said. "I
hope it's for the better."
The Israel-PLO agreement signed last month at
the White House calls for Israel to withdraw from
most Palestinian cities and villages in the West
Bank by the end of the year. If all goes as planned,
about 30 percent of the West Bank, occupied by
Israel since 1967, will be transferred to Palestinian
control, with unspecified withdrawals to take place
later.
The pullout from Jenin, an agricultural town of
38,000 in the northern West Bank, is to start
Wednesday with the arrival of Palestinian police at
the district coordination office. Israeli troops are to
start leaving Nov. 10. Once they're out by Nov. 19,
Israel will have no authority within city limits.
Some preparatory steps have been taken. A road
has been built through the rocky hills surrounding
Jenin so Israelis who live in nearby settlements can
bypass areas under Palestinian control.
Construction of roads around other West Bank

cities is under way. Last week, Israel transferred
inmates from a prison in Nablus, south of Jenin,
into Israel, and 1,000 Palestinian police are wait ing
to deploy in the city. The army dismantled the
prison yesterday.
But months of delay and dashed expectations
have left many Palestinians in no mood to cele
brate.
"The enthusiasm is there, but it is cautious,"
said Khadoura Moussa, head of PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's Jenin office. "It is difficult for people who
have lived for 28 years under oppression and
humiliation to make the transition to a normal
life."
Their caution was underlined when Israel's
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said a detailed
withdrawal schedule presented to the Cabinet yes
terday by the army depends on whether the West
Bank stays calm.
"If not, and it is a reality of terrorism and shel
ters for terrorists . . . the schedule will be
changed," Sarid said.
Many Palestinians worry that economic prob
lems in the West Bank, where the per capita income
is already ten times lower than in Israel, will wors
en under autonomy.
About 70 percent of the West Bank — including
a few Palestinian refugee camps and villages, Jew
ish settlements and Israeli military bases — will
stay in Israeli hands for the time being, and Israel
will keep final security control over most of the
rest.
Some of the thorniest issues, such as the future
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian
refugees, have been put off for negotiations on the
final status of the territories, scheduled to start in
May.
For many Palestinians, the first year of self-rule
in Gaza has not been an encouraging example.
