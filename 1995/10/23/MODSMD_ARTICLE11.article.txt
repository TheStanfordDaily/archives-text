Cuban market open to exchange
MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Cuban govern
ment has allowed the opening of the first free
market currency exchange houses since 1959, the
latest step in its crawl toward a market economy.
Cubans now can buy and sell pesos and dollars
legally for the first time since President Fidel Cas
tro came to power, the Mexican news agency
Excelsior said in a dispatch from Havana.
Unidentified Western diplomats told Excelsior
the move appears to be an effort to compete with
the black market to get badly needed dollars out of
private hands and into the Cuban National Bank.
Civil war escalates in Sri Lanka
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Tamil rebels
attacked three villages in northeastern Sri Lanka
early Saturday, killing at least 50 civilians, the
military said.
The attacks were in the villages of
Kolakanawadiya, Mangalagama and Bowatte, all
about 130 miles east of Colombo, the capital.
The military has found 50 bodies, said Major
Tilak Dunuwille, a military spokesman.
It was the biggest Tamil rebel assault on civil
ians since 1992 when 166 Muslims were massa
cred in Palliyagodella. It came a day after rebels
blew up storage tanks at the country's two main
oil depots in Colombo, panicking the capital; 26
people died in fighting after the explosions.
Details of the pre-dawn attacks are not imme
diately available, but the death toll is likely to go
up. Military reinforcements airlifted to the area
are searching for the rebels in the nearby jungles.
Meanwhile, an offensive by more than 35,000

troops near the guerrilla stronghold of Jaffna city
entered the fifth day Saturday. At least 89 soldiers
and 151 rebels have been killed in the offensive,
the military said.
Since Tuesday, thousands of troops supported
by battle tanks, warplanes and gunboats advanced
from a base in the mostly rebel-held peninsula to
capture guerrilla positions.
Peace talks between the government and Tamil
rebels broke down last April and ended a three
month truce.
Sheep storm Spain
MADRID, Spain (AP) — For Madrid's motorists,
yesterday was a woolly — if not wild — day.
The Spanish capital's chaotic traffic was halted
briefly yesterday to allow thousands of bleating
sheep to pass through town on their way from
northern to southern Spain.
The parade was part of the second annual
demonstration by sheep farmers and ecologists
hoping to save the ancient herding paths, or Royal
Tracks, that criss-cross Spain.
The Royal Tracks were established by King Alfon
so VIII in 1158. In recent decades, however, they
have been severely damaged by construction projects.
In yesterday's march, about 2,500 sheep were
herded down Madrid's central Alcala Street —
which once formed part of one of the routes — as
they continued their 450-mile journey from the
Picos de Europa mountain range in the north to
southwestern Extremadura.
The European Natural Heritage Fund, one of
the organizers of the march, wants the govern
ment to preserve the estimated 95,000 miles of
Royal Tracks in Spain.
