## An ancient Myth 
### 
ANEW BOOK trashing Stan
ford's version of multicultur
alism has been raising a lot of
ire among administrators lately.
Unfortunately, most students don't
seem to care.
In their recently published work,
"The Diversity Myth", authors —
and former Stanford Review editors
— David Sacks and Peter Thiol
unleash a barrage of charges at their
alma mater, presumably under the
premise that if enough mud is
thrown at a wall, some of it may
stick. Administrators from Jon Rei
der in the Office of Admissions all
the way up to University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice have taken issue with
what Sacks and Thiel have to say.
But the book fails at being a rele
vant piece. If one can ignore the
work's less-than-subtle ideological
tilt, "The Diversity Myth" serves as
a passable chronicle of the curricular
and social issues Stanford has

addressed in the past decade.
Stanford is a different place today
than the University that Sacks and
Thiel attended five years ago.
Debates over Western Culture are
more or less a thing of the past. This
is an era when the most tangible
example of multicultural debate —
the 1994 hunger strike — occurred
a year and a half ago and raised little
anger around the campus in general.
The grape policy issue, the only con
troversial holdover from the hunger
strike, is considered by the majority
of students today as something
between a joke and an annoyance.
Hopefully, students and aca
demics will follow upon "The Diver
sity Myth" with other, more bal
anced considerations of multicultur
al ism at the University and beyond.
It's an important subject for the
Stanford of today and tomorrow —
one which has been quiescent of late
but is worthy of renewed attention
and consideration.
