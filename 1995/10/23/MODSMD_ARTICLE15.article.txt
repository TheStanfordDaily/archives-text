THERE'S A BIG, empty space
on campus, and it has noth
ing to do with tiger salaman
ders.
The large vacant building that
once housed Saks Fifth Avenue at
the Stanford Shopping Center now
stands cold and idle, without a ten
ant.
But as the Stanford Management
Company, which operates the Shop
ping Center, looks for a new renter
to fill the space, they and the Uni
versity should not just consider a
bottom-line quick-fix, but the contri
bution a new establishment would
make to the Stanford community.
One intriguing possibility for the
space would be to renovate the
building and make it into a movie
theater. Stanford community mem
bers are currently faced with a
daunting trek along Highway 101 to
Mountain View or Redwood City if
they wish to catch a mainstream
movie.
Transforming the Saks store into

a multiplex would make a positive
contribution to the Palo Alto / Stan
ford community. With the new the
ater, students and staff looking for
an evening's entertainment would
have an engaging option just a short
bike ride or walk away
Of course, movie theaters are
only one suggestion; there are many
other options which would also
serve the Stanford community well.
The ongoing metamorphosis of the
Varsity Theatre into a Borders
Bookstore shows that department
stores are not the only willing and
able renters for such a large space.
In attempting to find a new occu
pant for the space, the Stanford
Management Company should look
for a company promising to pay a
suitable rent. But if the opportunity
presents itself, the management
company should be willing to sacri
fice some income for a new tenant
who offers something more than
what is already sold at the Stanford
Shopping Center.
