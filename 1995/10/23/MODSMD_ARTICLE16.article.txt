Graduate rebuffs authors of' Diversit y' letter

I WOULD LIKE to take this opportu
nity not to respond to the authors,
hut rather to give some information
to Stanford students, especially fresh
men and transfers.
I do not even feel the need to go into
a full response to their letter. I know
the truth.
First, the Stanford community
should realize that there are no "sepa
rate Orientation activities, separate
graduation ceremonies and separate
University-sponsored events" for specif
ic ethnic communities. The Orientation
activities sponsored by such groups as
the Chicano / Latino Orientation Com
mittee and the Hlack Recruitment and
Orientation Committee, the graduation
ceremonies, etc. are all additional activi
ties.
I wanted to correct this misinforma
tion because I think believing such
statements would lead some individuals
to think these events are representa
tions of Stanford's huge plot for "Balka
nization."
In regard to graduation ceremonies,
please note that nearly all graduating
students participate in the traditional

Sunday ceremonies, which include a
large ceremony at Stanford Stadium
and a smaller departmental ceremony
for degree conferral.
The Asian-American, Chicano / Lati
no, African-American, and Native
American communities all have student
sponsored graduation events on the Sat
urday before graduation. As
Chicano / Latino Oraduation '95 logis
tics coordinator and participant, I would
just like to let all Stanford students
know a few things about the Chicano /
Latino graduation, specifically, because
I believe that most students are not
fully aware of the graduation events and
what they mean.
Chicano / Latino graduation provides
the opportunity to take time out and
thank our families, especially our par
ents, for all their support, love and
encouragement. I think most partici
pants would agree that our success is
not merely our own, but that of our par
ents and families, who, we believe, are
key to our achievement. The Chi
cano / Latino Graduation Committee
works for the entire school year devel
oping and planning the ceremony and

banquet, as well as fund-raising inde
pendently for the event. While we
receive some funding from the Guiding
Concilio at El Centro, the bulk of our
money is raised through fund-raising
efforts ranging from t-shirt sales to an
auction, as well as funding rolled over
from the previous year.
With over 600 participants and
guests, the committee puts in countless
hours organizing the student-sponsored,
student-led event. Our events include a
bilingual mass, co-sponsored by the
Stanford Catholic Community, a gradu
ation ceremony and a banquet. The
bilingual ceremony that we have is one
that specifically thanks our parents.
The main portion of the ceremony,
which has keynote and student address
es as well as awards, is the distribution
of the certificates. At this time, each
graduate and his or her parents or loved
one are called on stage. The graduate
and his or her parents receive a certifi
cate while a message from the graduate
thanking his or her parents and family
is read. The student also receives a rose
to give to his or her mother or loved
one. Then the student, wearing a zarape

over the traditional black gown, offers
the zarape to a parent or loved one as a
sign of appreciation. The banquet that
follows includes a mariachi and Ballet
Folklorico de Stanford performance. I
should also add that many freshmen,
sophomores, juniors and graduate stu
dents donate their time to help ensure a
smooth event.
You may ask why such an in-depth
description is being offered. I know that
many people on campus are taken aback
at the thought of what are sometimes
portrayed as "separate" activities. And I
think, unfortunately, many of the con
cerns of people will never be resolved for
the simple fact that they will never enter
a theme dorm, they will never attend a
community-sponsored event and they
will never ask, "Why do you exactly have
that event?" I invite students who are
truly interested in what these events
and dorms are about to ask participants
questions and engage in respectful dia
logue. I believe it is most often not
knowing and not asking that causes feel
ings of "Balkanization" on this campus.
