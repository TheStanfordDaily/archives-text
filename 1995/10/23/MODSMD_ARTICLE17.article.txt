# Associate dean of humanities counters 'data' cited by the authors of 'Diversity Myth'
## 
### 
I have been puzzling over Friday's let
ter from Peter Thiel and David Sacks, in
which they defend themselves against
President Casper's and Provost Rice's
charge of "egregious errors and misrepre
sentations" in their book, "The Diversity
Myth." Thiel and Sacks counter that
their book is "based upon years of careful
research" and go on to repeat some of the
key results of their extensive research.
Of particular interest to me was their
"data" on Stanford's foreign language
departments. I quote in full: "By slashing

its foreign culture language departments,
Stanford has limited the study of foreign
cultures. Over the last decade, the
departments of French and Italian, Ger
man, Spanish and Portuguese and Slavic
Languages have lost a combined eight bil
lets for faculty — a cut of about 20 per
cent."
in the letter, Thiel and Sacks
further substantiate their claim with a
quote from me, taken from an article
that appeared two years ago in that well
known authoritative source, The Stan
ford Daily.
So what are the facts? Has Stanford
slashed the foreign language depart
ments in the past decade, as Thiel, Sacks
and The Daily seem convinced, or not, as
Casper and Rice claim?

Let's look at the numbers. Using the
time frame that Thiel and Sacks quote
from, billeted strength — including
vacant billets — for 1985-86 are as fol
lows: Asian Languages, 8.33; French and
Italian, 12.16; German, eight; Slavic
5.75; and Spanish and Portuguese, nine.
Billets for all departments total 43.24.
Now compare those numbers for 1995-
96. Asian languages, 8.5; French and
Italian, 12.66; German, 7.5; Slavic, five;
Spanish and Portuguese, 7.5; and divi
sion wide, one. Billets for all departments
total 42.16.
Looking at this, you may be puzzled as
I was about where Thiel and Sacks could
claim a 20 percent cut. True, they left out
the Asian Languages Department, and
did not consider billets assigned to the

new Division of Literatures, Cultures and
Languages. But even in the departments
they singled out, the billet count has
decreased only by 2.25 or roughly five
percent. The language departments as a
whole are down by 1.08 billets or roughly
two percent.
My first hypothesis was that Thiel and
Sacks were not counting vacant billets,
but only tenure-track faculty on the
Stanford campus. But this idea is quickly
dashed by the facts. Looking at only
occupied billets, the language department
would show an increase in the past
decade of roughly 5 percent, slightly
more if you count only the departments
singled out by Thiel and Sacks.
My next hypothesis was that
the alleged 20 percent cut resulted
from the fact that comparative lit
erature, which was a program in
1985, became a department in
1987. When this happened, a
number of faculty from the lan
guage departments had propor
tions of their billets shifted to the
new Department of Comparative
Literature. Perhaps Thiel and
Sacks were counting these shifts
as cuts to the language depart
ments, even though none of the
faculty actually left the University
Again, the facts do not boar this
out.
The billeted strength of lan
guages under the previously men
tioned circumstances fell from
43.24 in 1985-86 to 39.19 in 1995-
96. But when the shifts are fac
tored in — the billeted strength of
both languages and composition
literature — the number in 1995-
95 was 44.41, compared to 44.49
in 1985-86.

Even so, the drop in the lan
guage department., ignoring the
transfer in billets, seems to show
only a 9 percent reduction, not the
20 percent as claimed by Thiel
and Sacks. But to view this as a
cut would be nonsense. Remem
ber, that these shifts are just for
bookkeeping. Portions of the bil
lets of the affected faculty were
just moved to the new depart
ment.
The real source of Thiel and
Sacks' figures is a more "egregious
error" than anything suggested
above. I have no doubt that there
have been eight billets out of the
language departments in the past
decade or so. What Thiel and
Sacks failed to count, however,
were the new billets that were
added to those same departments
during that same period.
For example, our French
department recently hired two of
the world's foremost authorities
in Francophone African and
Caribbean studies, and our Ger
man department hired a leading

researcher in second language
acquisition to head Stanford's
new Language Center. These fac
ulty occupy new billets that Thiel
and Sacks conveniently over
looked.
The most puzzling thing, to my
mind, is why during those "years
of careful research," Thiel and
Sacks never came to the dean's
office to ask for the actual billet
counts of the language depart
ments, rather than rely on rumors
and stories that appeared in The
Daily. I would have been glad to
oblige.

I have been puzzling over Friday's let
ter from Peter Thiel and David Sacks, in
which they defend themselves against
President Casper's and Provost Rice's
charge of "egregious errors and misrepre
sentations" in their book, "The Diversity
Myth." Thiel and Sacks counter that
their book is "based upon years of careful
research" and go on to repeat some of the
key results of their extensive research.
Of particular interest to me was their
"data" on Stanford's foreign language
departments. I quote in full: "By slashing

its foreign culture language departments,
Stanford has limited the study of foreign
cultures. Over the last decade, the
departments of French and Italian, Ger
man, Spanish and Portuguese and Slavic
Languages have lost a combined eight bil
lets for faculty — a cut of about 20 per
cent."
in the letter, Thiel and Sacks
further substantiate their claim with a
quote from me, taken from an article
that appeared two years ago in that well
known authoritative source, The Stan
ford Daily.
So what are the facts? Has Stanford
slashed the foreign language depart
ments in the past decade, as Thiel, Sacks
and The Daily seem convinced, or not, as
Casper and Rice claim?

Let's look at the numbers. Using the
time frame that Thiel and Sacks quote
from, billeted strength — including
vacant billets — for 1985-86 are as fol
lows: Asian Languages, 8.33; French and
Italian, 12.16; German, eight; Slavic
5.75; and Spanish and Portuguese, nine.
Billets for all departments total 43.24.
Now compare those numbers for 1995-
96. Asian languages, 8.5; French and
Italian, 12.66; German, 7.5; Slavic, five;
Spanish and Portuguese, 7.5; and divi
sion wide, one. Billets for all departments
total 42.16.
Looking at this, you may be puzzled as
I was about where Thiel and Sacks could
claim a 20 percent cut. True, they left out
the Asian Languages Department, and
did not consider billets assigned to the

new Division of Literatures, Cultures and
Languages. But even in the departments
they singled out, the billet count has
decreased only by 2.25 or roughly five
percent. The language departments as a
whole are down by 1.08 billets or roughly
two percent.
My first hypothesis was that Thiel and
Sacks were not counting vacant billets,
but only tenure-track faculty on the
Stanford campus. But this idea is quickly
dashed by the facts. Looking at only
occupied billets, the language department
would show an increase in the past
decade of roughly 5 percent, slightly
more if you count only the departments
singled out by Thiel and Sacks.
My next hypothesis was that
the alleged 20 percent cut resulted
from the fact that comparative lit
erature, which was a program in
1985, became a department in
1987. When this happened, a
number of faculty from the lan
guage departments had propor
tions of their billets shifted to the
new Department of Comparative
Literature. Perhaps Thiel and
Sacks were counting these shifts
as cuts to the language depart
ments, even though none of the
faculty actually left the University
Again, the facts do not boar this
out.
The billeted strength of lan
guages under the previously men
tioned circumstances fell from
43.24 in 1985-86 to 39.19 in 1995-
96. But when the shifts are fac
tored in — the billeted strength of
both languages and composition
literature — the number in 1995-
95 was 44.41, compared to 44.49
in 1985-86.

Even so, the drop in the lan
guage department., ignoring the
transfer in billets, seems to show
only a 9 percent reduction, not the
20 percent as claimed by Thiel
and Sacks. But to view this as a
cut would be nonsense. Remem
ber, that these shifts are just for
bookkeeping. Portions of the bil
lets of the affected faculty were
just moved to the new depart
ment.
The real source of Thiel and
Sacks' figures is a more "egregious
error" than anything suggested
above. I have no doubt that there
have been eight billets out of the
language departments in the past
decade or so. What Thiel and
Sacks failed to count, however,
were the new billets that were
added to those same departments
during that same period.
For example, our French
department recently hired two of
the world's foremost authorities
in Francophone African and
Caribbean studies, and our Ger
man department hired a leading

researcher in second language
acquisition to head Stanford's
new Language Center. These fac
ulty occupy new billets that Thiel
and Sacks conveniently over
looked.
The most puzzling thing, to my
mind, is why during those "years
of careful research," Thiel and
Sacks never came to the dean's
office to ask for the actual billet
counts of the language depart
ments, rather than rely on rumors
and stories that appeared in The
Daily. I would have been glad to
oblige.
