## Laughter and sex in common 
### 
LAST WEEK, I learned something in
my CIV class. It was about those
zany Greeks. You see, Zeus was a
pretty cool god, as far as gods go. He liked
to go down to the local mortal watering
hole and hit on women like your average
Joe Blow, but he realized that he had an
advantage over the typical singles' bar
stud, him being a god and all. Women go
for this, by the way.
So, to make things a little more fair,
Zeus chose to go in the form of your aver
age water fowl. Women usually don't go
for ducks and such — it has something to
do with the feet — yet Zeus still managed
to put the moves on some unsuspecting
woman and have sex with her. Impressive,
eh? Actually, impressive is not the word
that comes to mind to descrit>e a grown
woman and poultry having sex. The good
news, though, is that this little space filler
involves both laughter and sex, which I
recently realized are directly related.
Ixiughtcr is just like sex. Read the follow
ing list and I dare you to disagree.
• It puts you in a good mood.
• You can never get too much of it.
• People are willing to pay for it.
• You feel bad if you screw up the joke.
• Sometimes it is so good it hurts.
• Some people just look funny.
• Teachers get mad if you laugh during
their lectures.
• Brendan, don't make a joke about milk
shooting out of the nose here.
• Girls like funny guys and vice versa.
• Sometimes you are left gasping for
breath.

• Jokes seem more funny after a few beers.
• People enjoy reading it too.
• You smile — for a while — afterward.
• It is really all you enjoy out of life.
• Roseanne Barr isn't funny at all.
• You can make yourself laugh.
• Some people make funny noises when
they laugh.
• You think about it for a while afterward.
• You always try and relate a joke to your
friends.
• Long jokes aren't necessarily better.
• A lot of people are not funny, but think
they are.
• A good joke eases tension.
• There is something genuinely funny
about Hoover Tower.
• Joke books help you to become funnier.
• Sometimes fruit is incorporated into a
joke.
• Not everybody has the same tastes.
• The same joke over and over again gets
old.
• Everybody wants to marry someone
funny.
• First dates are hardly ever funny.
• No one laughs at a funeral.
• Goats are poor joke material, you sickos.
• I got this column by making the Daily
staff laugh.
• Thursday's columnists don't understand
humor at all.
• Your resistance lowers as it gets later at
night.
• A joke is always ruined if you start laugh
ing before you get to the punch line.
• Who wouldn't like to be more funny?
• The Daily is hardly ever funny.

• I could really use some more joke materi
al.
• Later on, you sometimes regret telling a
joke.
Still not convinced? Well, that probably
says more about you than me.
So what does all this mean, anyway?
The first lesson is that not everything
written above is funny. Actually, not even
half of it is funny. The sad fact is that
maybe only a few one-liners tickled your
funny bone. But, being so experienced
with jokes that have as much humor as a
doorknob, I understand that they can't all
be winners. The good news is that if you
make enough of them, you're bound to let
a funny one slip into the pile. It's like car
pet-bombing. This is just like attractive
people here at Stanford. The idea here is
that if you let enough people in, a few
good-looking ones are sure to slip through
the cracks.
The second thing to note is that my
columns seem to be getting more and
more obscene. I would like to blame it all
on the pink tile in the men's room, but I
think the truth is that it is all my room
mate's fault.

Brendan McCullough enjoys walks on the
beach, mint chocolate-chip ice cream and
"whizzing" out of third-floor windows. He
also prefers the name "Studmuffin" to
"Whiny Smurf' — so get it right.
