# GSB student mulls the differences between the East and West Coast
## 
### 
The Oct. 12, 1995 issue of
The Daily attempted to capture,
through a series of interviews,
the essential differences in

lifestyle between California and
the East Coast. The differences
cited were a difference in atti
tude, a difference in weather
and a difference in culture.
To this I say, no, no, a thou
sand times no.
In truth, there is only one
significant difference between
West Coast and East Coast liv
ing. Stated simply, in California,
"Melrose Place" is on opposite
of Monday Night Football.
That's right, I watch "Mel
rose Place." What of it? Busi
ness students don't spend all
their free time developing insid
er trading strategies. I can't
help it. I enjoy watching "Mel
rose Place." The French call it
"joie de vivre," a joyous celebra
tion of life's unexpected
moments. I call it "Melrose"
night on Fox.
My passion for "Melrose" is
evident by the fact that I can
name more characters on the
show than presidents of the
United States. As a conse

quence, the faculty at the GSB
has placed my folder in the
"permanent probation file."
I asked my funny friend and
fellow MBA student, Jan
Klawans, a frequent organizer
of "Melrose Place" watching
parties, why she thought "Mel
rose" had such a loyal following.
She said, "Joe, the people on the
show are beautiful and stupid.
Frankly, it's a very attractive
combination."
This brings us back to the
original difference I cited at the
beginning — that "Melrose
Place" is on directly opposite of
Monday Night Football. This is
the greatest television dilemma
since "Cheers" was on opposite
of HBO's special presentation of
"The Making of Sports Illustrat
ed's 25th Anniversary Swimsuit
Issue."
Monday Night Football has
never had competition like this.
Indeed, this is the greatest
threat to the program since the
arrival of Dan Dierdorf behind

the microphone.
Before I emigrated to the
West Coast, I had very little use
for the remote control. In fact,
this equation neatly summa
rizes my past: remote control
plus sports on TV equals ex
fiancee in D.C.
Anyway, all that has changed
since I moved to California. So
here is what I do now. If the
football game is boring or a
blowout, I simply switch to
"Melrose Place" at 8 p.m. and
forget about football.
If the game is terrific and the
"Melrose" plot is interesting
(i.e. Oct. 17, 1994 when John
Elway went up against Joe Mon
tana and Kathy Ireland on HBO
— God bless America, this is
what the VCR was invented
for), I surf back and forth
between plays and commercials.
And, of course, if there is a
scene involving Matt, I watch
football.
