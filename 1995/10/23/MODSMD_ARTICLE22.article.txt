## Cardinal crumbles as the Bruins rush to victory Abdul-Jabbar runs wild 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The first time he touched the
ball, PA announcer Gary Williams
called him by his former name,
Sharmon Shah. Forty-two carries
and 261 yards later, everybody in
Stanford Stadium knew Karim
Abdul-Jabbar's name, to the point
that Williams could call him "you
know-who."
Why not? Over half the Bruin
plays on offense were Abdul-Jab
bar runs. The 261 yards didn't
come with the help of 80-yard
open field jaunts either. Abdul-
Jabbar's longest run was an
unspectacular 14 yards. Quarter
back Cade McNown posted
UCLA's longest run from scrim
mage with a 16-yard scamper.
While McNown enjoyed his
best game as a Bruin, Abdul-Jab
bar is the man Stanford defenders
will see in their nightmares. The
Pacific 10 Conference rushing
leader gained more yardage
against Stanford than anybody
in, well, a long time. Nobody has
surpassed Shah's total since
1969, when Stanford started
keeping track. He found every
hole, and the one time he lost
yardage on a run, he fell down.
"He's a war horse," said 20-
year UCLA head coach Terry
Donahue, no stranger to lavishing
praise on his stars. "He's our
most competitive, toughest ath
lete on the football team. He's the
best practice player on the team
and he's the best game player on
the team."
Abdul-Jabbar had run for
297 yards in two previous con
tests against Stanford, and Car
dinal coach Tyrone Willingham

acknowledged the skill of last
year's Second Team All-Pac-10
selection.
"We knew he was a great back,
but we hoped he would not be this
good," Willingham said. "The dif
ference between the two halves
was UCLA's ability to get their
offense going [in the second half],
especially running the football."
Abdul-Jabbar rushed for 81
yards on 15 carries in the first half,
although he slipped several times
on the wet Foster Field. But the
field was drier in the second half,
when Abdul-Jabbar put together a
game's worth of effort — 27 carries,
180 yards and three touchdowns
(to go with one in the first half).
Senior UCLA center Mike Fla
nagan, a First Team All-Pac-10
player in 1994, enjoyed the run
ning game's dominance in the
second half. "When you've got
that many yards on the ground, it
just shows that your whole line's
just kicking ass basically," he
said. "It's a great feeling for an
offensive lineman, and it's even
better to see Karim do so well."
Flanagan and his mates in the
trenches improved as the game
dragged on, dominating the line
of scrimmage. Stanford's defen
sive front, on the field almost two
thirds of the second half, ran out
of steam.
"They didn't have the same
look in their eyes that they did
when they first started the
game," Flanagan said. "They
were scared or worried or whatev
er you want to call it. We were
just running right over them
every time, and that's got to
break your will."


Allison Otto — Dally
Junior running back Mike Mitchell moves the Cardinal down the
field, but the Stanford offense sputtered in the second half.
Bruin strong safety Abdul
McCullough said that Stanford
was not prepared for the UCLA
attack. "It just seemed like Stan
ford, their defense, did a sucky job
realizing how physical a run team
we were gonna be," he said. "I
don't know what their coach told
them. I don't know if he told them
UCLA was a bunch of pussies or
something. It just seemed like
late in the game their team was
bracing for how physical we were
gonna be. They wore down and
helped us to play a lot better."
Willingham conceded that
Stanford did not make the neces
sary plays on defense, but dis
agreed with McCullough and Fla
nagan.
"I don't believe that condition
ing was a factor because it started
early in the third quarter," Will
ingham said.
Abdul-Jabbar said Stanford's
overplaying defense enabled a dif
ferent, more deliberate style than
in last week's duel with Arizona.
"The holes were opening up late,"
he said. "I had to really slow play
and wait for my linemen to get
around. This team overplayed a
lot and everything developed late,
so I had to take my time."
Stanford junior free safety
Josh Madsen, who was juked on
one Abdul-Jabbar touchdown,
credited both UCLA's men up
front and Abdul-Jabbar for the
Bruins' second-half success.
"The offensive line blocked
great," Madsen said. "They ran a
lot of misdirection plays. [Ahdul-

JabbarJ had the ability to pick his
hole, and he's very explosive.
When they have a high percent
age of third-down conversions, it

takes a lot out of the defense."
On six third downs in the first
half, UCLA gained a first down
just once, but on their six oppor

tunities after the break, the Bru
ins moved the chains five times.
Facing a 21-7 deficit, UCLA
moved the ball right down the
field on the opening drive of the
half, establishing a telling prece
dent of the trouble that lay ahead
for Stanford.
"My theme was [in the half
time speech), if you go out and
take the first drive and score with
it, you see what happens," Don
ahue said. "This game will flip
over before you know it. I've seen
it happen 100 times. When we
scored, everything changed."
LTCLA put the game away with
a fitting exclamation point, a 15-
play drive t hat nearly drained the
clock. Abdul-Jabbar ran 11 times
on the march, gaining less than
four yards only once.
"The [98]-yard drive at the end
of the game was impressive,"
Donahue said. "There were a lot
of our guys doing a good job. I saw
[Lombardi Award candidate
Jonathan] Ogden a couple of
times, and it was something I've
never seen. He was the best I've
ever seen doing that, pulling
around and just blowing guys
away. It was awesome."
Still, Abdul-Jabbar's dominance
stood out above all the rest. Don
ahue hopes he will have the junior's
services for another season.
"If you had a team of guys that
would play like that guy plays
every week or practices like that
guy practices every day, you'd
have more than your share of vic
tories," he said. "He's got some
real special qualities that a lot of
players don't have. He's a real
unique player."
Apparently, Abdul-Jabbar is a
great football name, too.

(to go with one in the first half).
Senior UCLA center Mike Fla
nagan, a First Team All-Pac-10
player in 1994, enjoyed the run
ning game's dominance in the
second half. "When you've got
that many yards on the ground, it
just shows that your whole line's
just kicking ass basically," he
said. "It's a great feeling for an
offensive lineman, and it's even
better to see Karim do so well."
Flanagan and his mates in the
trenches improved as the game
dragged on, dominating the line
of scrimmage. Stanford's defen
sive front, on the field almost two
thirds of the second half, ran out
of steam.
"They didn't have the same
look in their eyes that they did
when they first started the
game," Flanagan said. "They
were scared or worried or whatev
er you want to call it. We were
just running right over them
every time, and that's got to
break your will."


Allison Otto — Dally
Junior running back Mike Mitchell moves the Cardinal down the
field, but the Stanford offense sputtered in the second half.
Bruin strong safety Abdul
McCullough said that Stanford
was not prepared for the UCLA
attack. "It just seemed like Stan
ford, their defense, did a sucky job
realizing how physical a run team
we were gonna be," he said. "I
don't know what their coach told
them. I don't know if he told them
UCLA was a bunch of pussies or
something. It just seemed like
late in the game their team was
bracing for how physical we were
gonna be. They wore down and
helped us to play a lot better."
Willingham conceded that
Stanford did not make the neces
sary plays on defense, but dis
agreed with McCullough and Fla
nagan.
"I don't believe that condition
ing was a factor because it started
early in the third quarter," Will
ingham said.
Abdul-Jabbar said Stanford's
overplaying defense enabled a dif
ferent, more deliberate style than
in last week's duel with Arizona.
"The holes were opening up late,"
he said. "I had to really slow play
and wait for my linemen to get
around. This team overplayed a
lot and everything developed late,
so I had to take my time."
Stanford junior free safety
Josh Madsen, who was juked on
one Abdul-Jabbar touchdown,
credited both UCLA's men up
front and Abdul-Jabbar for the
Bruins' second-half success.
"The offensive line blocked
great," Madsen said. "They ran a
lot of misdirection plays. [Ahdul-

JabbarJ had the ability to pick his
hole, and he's very explosive.
When they have a high percent
age of third-down conversions, it

takes a lot out of the defense."
On six third downs in the first
half, UCLA gained a first down
just once, but on their six oppor

tunities after the break, the Bru
ins moved the chains five times.
Facing a 21-7 deficit, UCLA
moved the ball right down the
field on the opening drive of the
half, establishing a telling prece
dent of the trouble that lay ahead
for Stanford.
"My theme was [in the half
time speech), if you go out and
take the first drive and score with
it, you see what happens," Don
ahue said. "This game will flip
over before you know it. I've seen
it happen 100 times. When we
scored, everything changed."
LTCLA put the game away with
a fitting exclamation point, a 15-
play drive t hat nearly drained the
clock. Abdul-Jabbar ran 11 times
on the march, gaining less than
four yards only once.
"The [98]-yard drive at the end
of the game was impressive,"
Donahue said. "There were a lot
of our guys doing a good job. I saw
[Lombardi Award candidate
Jonathan] Ogden a couple of
times, and it was something I've
never seen. He was the best I've
ever seen doing that, pulling
around and just blowing guys
away. It was awesome."
Still, Abdul-Jabbar's dominance
stood out above all the rest. Don
ahue hopes he will have the junior's
services for another season.
"If you had a team of guys that
would play like that guy plays
every week or practices like that
guy practices every day, you'd
have more than your share of vic
tories," he said. "He's got some
real special qualities that a lot of
players don't have. He's a real
unique player."
Apparently, Abdul-Jabbar is a
great football name, too.


Sasha Mitelman — Daily
Junior running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar strides for one of his 261
rushing yards against the Cardinal in the Bruins 42-28 triumph. Jab
bar set a personal career high with the performance.
The first time he touched the
ball, PA announcer Gary Williams
called him by his former name,
Sharmon Shah. Forty-two carries
and 261 yards later, everybody in
Stanford Stadium knew Karim
Abdul-Jabbar's name, to the point
that Williams could call him "you
know-who."
Why not? Over half the Bruin
plays on offense were Abdul-Jab
bar runs. The 261 yards didn't
come with the help of 80-yard
open field jaunts either. Abdul-
Jabbar's longest run was an
unspectacular 14 yards. Quarter
back Cade McNown posted
UCLA's longest run from scrim
mage with a 16-yard scamper.
While McNown enjoyed his
best game as a Bruin, Abdul-Jab
bar is the man Stanford defenders
will see in their nightmares. The
Pacific 10 Conference rushing
leader gained more yardage
against Stanford than anybody
in, well, a long time. Nobody has
surpassed Shah's total since
1969, when Stanford started
keeping track. He found every
hole, and the one time he lost
yardage on a run, he fell down.
"He's a war horse," said 20-
year UCLA head coach Terry
Donahue, no stranger to lavishing
praise on his stars. "He's our
most competitive, toughest ath
lete on the football team. He's the
best practice player on the team
and he's the best game player on
the team."
Abdul-Jabbar had run for
297 yards in two previous con
tests against Stanford, and Car
dinal coach Tyrone Willingham

acknowledged the skill of last
year's Second Team All-Pac-10
selection.
"We knew he was a great back,
but we hoped he would not be this
good," Willingham said. "The dif
ference between the two halves
was UCLA's ability to get their
offense going [in the second half],
especially running the football."
Abdul-Jabbar rushed for 81
yards on 15 carries in the first half,
although he slipped several times
on the wet Foster Field. But the
field was drier in the second half,
when Abdul-Jabbar put together a
game's worth of effort — 27 carries,
180 yards and three touchdowns
(to go with one in the first half).
