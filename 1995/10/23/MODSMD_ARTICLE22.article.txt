## Cardinal crumbles as the Bruins rush to victory Abdul-Jabbar runs wild 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The first time he touched the
ball, PA announcer Gary Williams
called him by his former name,
Sharmon Shah. Forty-two carries
and 261 yards later, everybody in
Stanford Stadium knew Karim
Abdul-Jabbar's name, to the point
that Williams could call him "you
know-who."
Why not? Over half the Bruin
plays on offense were Abdul-Jab
bar runs. The 261 yards didn't
come with the help of 80-yard
open field jaunts either. Abdul-
Jabbar's longest run was an
unspectacular 14 yards. Quarter
back Cade McNown posted
UCLA's longest run from scrim
mage with a 16-yard scamper.
While McNown enjoyed his
best game as a Bruin, Abdul-Jab
bar is the man Stanford defenders
will see in their nightmares. The
Pacific 10 Conference rushing
leader gained more yardage
against Stanford than anybody
in, well, a long time. Nobody has
surpassed Shah's total since
1969, when Stanford started
keeping track. He found every
hole, and the one time he lost
yardage on a run, he fell down.
"He's a war horse," said 20-
year UCLA head coach Terry
Donahue, no stranger to lavishing
praise on his stars. "He's our
most competitive, toughest ath
lete on the football team. He's the
best practice player on the team
and he's the best game player on
the team."
Abdul-Jabbar had run for
297 yards in two previous con
tests against Stanford, and Car
dinal coach Tyrone Willingham

acknowledged the skill of last
year's Second Team All-Pac-10
selection.
"We knew he was a great back,
but we hoped he would not be this
good," Willingham said. "The dif
ference between the two halves
was UCLA's ability to get their
offense going [in the second half],
especially running the football."
Abdul-Jabbar rushed for 81
yards on 15 carries in the first half,
although he slipped several times
on the wet Foster Field. But the
field was drier in the second half,
when Abdul-Jabbar put together a
game's worth of effort — 27 carries,
180 yards and three touchdowns
(to go with one in the first half).
Senior UCLA center Mike Fla
nagan, a First Team All-Pac-10
player in 1994, enjoyed the run
ning game's dominance in the
second half. "When you've got
that many yards on the ground, it
just shows that your whole line's
just kicking ass basically," he
said. "It's a great feeling for an
offensive lineman, and it's even
better to see Karim do so well."
Flanagan and his mates in the
trenches improved as the game
dragged on, dominating the line
of scrimmage. Stanford's defen
sive front, on the field almost two
thirds of the second half, ran out
of steam.
"They didn't have the same
look in their eyes that they did
when they first started the
game," Flanagan said. "They
were scared or worried or whatev
er you want to call it. We were
just running right over them
every time, and that's got to
break your will."

Junior running back Mike Mitchell moves the Cardinal down the
field, but the Stanford offense sputtered in the second half.
