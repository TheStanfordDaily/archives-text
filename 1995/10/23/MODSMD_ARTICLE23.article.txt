That sound you may have
heard coming from Harry Mal
oney Field yesterday afternoon
was a collective sigh of relief.
Undaunted by the ninth
ranked Stanford women's soccer
team (12-3 overall, 4-0 Pacific 10
Conference), No. 21 UCLA (11-2-
2, 5-1) bombarded the Cardinal
with a flurry of second-half shot
attempts, hoping to overcome a
tenuous 2-1 Cardinal lead. But
thanks to the efforts of freshman
goalkeeper Erin Bryla, Stanford,
which buried USC (7-6-1, 2-3) 6-
1 on Friday, turned back the Bru
ins time and time again to sal
vage the victory and complete its
weekend sweep of the two South
ern California schools.
"It was a relief in the fact that
we accomplished what we wanted
to accomplish, which was a win,"
said head coach lan Sawyers,
"but I was disappointed we didn't
handle their tactics better. They

had the wind (in the second half),
so they were banging it to the
three (frontline players), then
trying to chase it, and we didn't
deal with it very well."
Freshman forward Kelly
Adamson's goal at 50 minutes, 22
seconds appeared to give the Car
dinal control of the game, but in
fact, UCLA would dictate the
tempo throughout the remainder
of the second half. The Bruins
were constantly in the right place
at the right time in the second
half, outshooting the Cardinal 9-3
after intermission. But time after
time during the contest's final 40
minutes, Bryla and the Cardinal
defense spoiled the Bruins' gold
en opportunities. Nonetheless,
thi' game's outcome remained in
doubt until the final gun sounded.
"We definitely gave them too
many chances," Bryla said, "but
we defended them fairly well. It
just seemed like we weren't quite
on today, but it's okay because we
still pulled out the win."
Stanford opened the scoring at
the 27:45 mark when junior for
ward Erin Martin took a lead pass
from Adamson and beat Bruin
goalie Gretchen Overgaard one
on-one for the goal. UCLA evened
the score two-and-a-half minutes
later when sophomore forward
Traci Arkenberg converted on an
assist from Sherice Bartling.
The match was still knotted at

1-1 early in the second half when
Adamson picked up Martin's pass
and dribbled it past the UCLA
defense, around a fallen Over
gaard and into the empty Bruin
net to give Stanford the lead for
good.
"I didn't think we did a very
good job of controlling the
tempo," Sawyers said. "We let
them get back in it. I didn't think
we did a good job of cutting off
their supply or winning balls in
the defensive line. We also turned
the ball over a little too much, but
we showed our class, and we
showed our tenacity to win. You
can only keep a good team down
for so long, even with those kind
of tactics."
Friday morning's match ver
sus USC lacked the nail-biting
drama of Sunday's contest. Led
by Martin's three goals, Stanford
staked a 2-0 halftime lead and
cruised to a 6-1 victory over the
visiting Trojans.
Senior midfielder Dena I)ey
added a goal and an assist in the
win. Adamson and junior mid
fielder Wendy Latimer also con
tributed a goal apiece.
The Cardinal can now win the
Pac-10 title outright with victo
ries at Washington and Washing
ton State this Friday and Sunday,
respectively, and a win over An
zona in the regular season finale
on Nov. 5.
"Two wins is great," Sawyers
said of the weekend's sweep.
"Anytime you win two games,
especially in the Pac-10, you're
happy."
