UCLA 8
Stanford ?

After three consecutive losses, the third-ranked
Stanford men's water polo team (12-6,1-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) was looking forward to
last Saturday's home game against fifth-ranked
UCLA as a chance to enjoy once again the sweet
taste of victory. But the Bruins had other plans and
dished out a distinctly unpalatable 8-7 loss at the
expense of the Cardinal.
The contest continued what has become a dis
turbing trend for the Cardinal. The Cardinal started
the game slowly, granted UCLA a sizable lead, ral
lied to tie the game and then lost the match as time
expired. It is a script which the team has adhered to
in each of its last three games.
Perhaps the only departure from the previous
three games was the fact that Cardinal initiated the
scoring. After several opportunities and a number of
near misses, Stanford collected the first goal of the
game when senior Jeremy Laster successfully con
verted a penalty shot just under three minutes into

the game.
Then it was UCLA's turn.
Two minutes after the Cardinal strike, the Bruins
answered with one of their own. Steve Covec rifled a
shot past senior goalie Jack Bowen to put UCLA on the
board. After playing the first five minutes of the game
without scoring, the Bruins took advantage of defen
sive miscues to reel off three additional unanswered
points in the final two minutes of the first quarter.
UCLA continued its scoring dominance to start
the second quarter with Mark Sutter firing the ball
past Bowen during a Bruin 6-on-5 situation. The
goal was the fifth in a row for the Bruins and gave
them a 5-1 lead.
"In the last few games, we have come out kind of
flat and spotted our opponents a considerable lead,"
said senior Josh Leachman. "We just haven't been
putting things together early. It's like we have to be
down before we start playing well."
For the remainder of the quarter, the Cardinal
could muster only one point on a strong play from
junior two-meter man Brian Wallin. Wallin received
a pass with a defender on his back and another
Bruin crashing in from the perimeter. He then pro
ceeded to evade one of the guards, muscle around
the other and complete the scoring opportunity by
flicking the ball past Bruin goalie Matt Swanson.
Stanford went into halftime trailing UCLA 5-2.
"We had some chances in the
first quarter that we really had to
score on," Laster said. "We have
to put away more of our shots.
UCLA is a scrappy team. They
don't have a real go-to guy, but if
you let them stay in the game,
they can be real tough. We have to
bury those types of teams early."
During the third period of play,
the Cardinal began its patented
comeback. Twenty seconds into
the second half, senior Daniel
Lehoczky took a pass from Wallin
and flung the bail past Swanson,
bringing Dettamanti's squad to
within two.
The Bruins then notched
another goal on another 6-on-5
opportunity, but the Cardinal
kept pace when Wallin stuffed the
ball into the net after piecing
together a quick passing combina
tion with Laster.
The most spectacular play of
the match took place as time was
winding down in the third quar
ter. With the clock stopped with
less than 10 seconds to play,
Bowen held the ball, looking for
an outlet. He found Leachman at
the far end of the pool, positioned
in front of the UCLA goal. With

four seconds to go, Bowen hurled
the ball towards Leachman, who
was wrestling with his guard in
an attempt to gain the advantage.
The ball touched down just in
front of Leachman and, after a
split second of further struggle,
he rifled a backhand shot past a
bewildered Bruin goalie, pulling
the Cardinal to within one.
In the fourth quarter, Detta
manti's squad continued to
scratch and bite its way back into
the game. With six minutes, 18
seconds remaining in the game,
Lehoczky blazed down the pool on
the counterattack, eluding his
defender, and skipped the ball
into the net for his second point of
the game. The goal deadlocked
the Cardinal with the Bruins for
the first time since late in the first
quarter, and Stanford was not
done yet.
Looking like it might finally
break its three-game jinx, the
Cardinal continued to surge
offensively while keeping the Bru
ins at bay. With ;J:5O to go in the
final quarter, Stanford was
awarded a 6-on-5 situation. After
moving the ball around the
perimeter, Laster took a pass
from Wallin and sent the ball
screaming into the back of the
net, giving the Cardinal a 7-6
advantage.
But the lead was short-lived.

With 3:02 to play, UCIxA drew a
20-second ejection against Wallin,
giving the Bruins a man-up situa
tion. Jeremy Braxton-Brown
sneaked a shot past Bowen to
knot the score at seven.
The Cardinal received a golden
opportunity to regain the lead
when a Bruin was ejected with
less than a minute to play. Laster
rifled a shot from two-point
range, but it was blocked by
Swanson The Cardinal secured
the rebound but was unable to
put the ball in the goal. Getting
the ball with approximately 20
seconds to play, it was UCLA's
turn to attempt some last-second
heroics.
The Bruins moved the ball
down the pool quickly, looking for
an opening in the Stanford
defense. As time ticked down, a
Bruin freed himself on the right
inside wing. He received the ball
and beat Bowen with a quick shot,
putting UCLA on top with :04
remaining in the contest.
The Cardinal had one last
chance at the win, as Laster took
the re-start pass and hurled a
two-point attempt from behind
mid-pool. Unfortunately for Stan
ford, Swanson got in front of the
shot and the Bruins clinched the
victory.
While the loss essentially
assured that the Cardinal must

win the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Tourney in order to
gain a berth to the NCAA Cham
pionships, Laster noted that the
team has not given up hope.
"There is definitely a lot of dis

appointment and frustration in a
loss like llast Friday's]," Laster
said. "We have lost several tough
games and our record is getting
worse, but we were in basically
every game. It's not like we were

getting blown out. We just need to
execute and put away our shots.
Some people may have started to
count us out, but we still feel as a
team that we can win the MPSF
tournament."

After three consecutive losses, the third-ranked
Stanford men's water polo team (12-6,1-3 Mountain

UCLA as a chance to enjoy once again the sweet

game when senior Jeremy Laster successfully con

Then it was UCLA's turn.
Two minutes after the Cardinal strike, the Bruins
answered with one of their own. Steve Covec rifled a
shot past senior goalie Jack Bowen to put UCLA on the
board. After playing the first five minutes of the game
without scoring, the Bruins took advantage of defen
sive miscues to reel off three additional unanswered
points in the final two minutes of the first quarter.
UCLA continued its scoring dominance to start
the second quarter with Mark Sutter firing the ball

goal was the fifth in a row for the Bruins and gave
them a 5-1 lead.

junior two-meter man Brian Wallin. Wallin received
a pass with a defender on his back and another
Bruin crashing in from the perimeter. He then pro

flicking the ball past Bruin goalie Matt Swanson.
Stanford went into halftime trailing UCLA 5-2.

ins at bay. With ;J:5O to go in the
final quarter, Stanford was
awarded a 6-on-5 situation. After
moving the ball around the
perimeter, Laster took a pass
from Wallin and sent the ball
screaming into the back of the
net, giving the Cardinal a 7-6
advantage.
But the lead was short-lived.

With 3:02 to play, UCIxA drew a
20-second ejection against Wallin,
giving the Bruins a man-up situa
tion. Jeremy Braxton-Brown
sneaked a shot past Bowen to
knot the score at seven.
The Cardinal received a golden
opportunity to regain the lead
when a Bruin was ejected with
less than a minute to play. Laster
rifled a shot from two-point
range, but it was blocked by
Swanson The Cardinal secured
the rebound but was unable to
put the ball in the goal. Getting
the ball with approximately 20
seconds to play, it was UCLA's
turn to attempt some last-second
heroics.
The Bruins moved the ball
down the pool quickly, looking for
an opening in the Stanford
defense. As time ticked down, a
Bruin freed himself on the right
inside wing. He received the ball
and beat Bowen with a quick shot,
putting UCLA on top with :04
remaining in the contest.
The Cardinal had one last
chance at the win, as Laster took
the re-start pass and hurled a
two-point attempt from behind
mid-pool. Unfortunately for Stan
ford, Swanson got in front of the
shot and the Bruins clinched the
victory.
While the loss essentially
assured that the Cardinal must

win the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Tourney in order to
gain a berth to the NCAA Cham
pionships, Laster noted that the
team has not given up hope.
"There is definitely a lot of dis

appointment and frustration in a
loss like llast Friday's]," Laster
said. "We have lost several tough
games and our record is getting
worse, but we were in basically
every game. It's not like we were

getting blown out. We just need to
execute and put away our shots.
Some people may have started to
count us out, but we still feel as a
team that we can win the MPSF
tournament."

UCLA 8
Stanford ?

After three consecutive losses, the third-ranked
Stanford men's water polo team (12-6,1-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) was looking forward to
last Saturday's home game against fifth-ranked
UCLA as a chance to enjoy once again the sweet
taste of victory. But the Bruins had other plans and
dished out a distinctly unpalatable 8-7 loss at the
expense of the Cardinal.
The contest continued what has become a dis
turbing trend for the Cardinal. The Cardinal started
the game slowly, granted UCLA a sizable lead, ral
lied to tie the game and then lost the match as time
expired. It is a script which the team has adhered to
in each of its last three games.
Perhaps the only departure from the previous
three games was the fact that Cardinal initiated the
scoring. After several opportunities and a number of
near misses, Stanford collected the first goal of the
game when senior Jeremy Laster successfully con
verted a penalty shot just under three minutes into

the game.
Then it was UCLA's turn.
Two minutes after the Cardinal strike, the Bruins
answered with one of their own. Steve Covec rifled a
shot past senior goalie Jack Bowen to put UCLA on the
board. After playing the first five minutes of the game
without scoring, the Bruins took advantage of defen
sive miscues to reel off three additional unanswered
points in the final two minutes of the first quarter.
UCLA continued its scoring dominance to start
the second quarter with Mark Sutter firing the ball
past Bowen during a Bruin 6-on-5 situation. The
goal was the fifth in a row for the Bruins and gave
them a 5-1 lead.
"In the last few games, we have come out kind of
flat and spotted our opponents a considerable lead,"
said senior Josh Leachman. "We just haven't been
putting things together early. It's like we have to be
down before we start playing well."
For the remainder of the quarter, the Cardinal
could muster only one point on a strong play from
junior two-meter man Brian Wallin. Wallin received
a pass with a defender on his back and another
Bruin crashing in from the perimeter. He then pro
ceeded to evade one of the guards, muscle around
the other and complete the scoring opportunity by
flicking the ball past Bruin goalie Matt Swanson.
Stanford went into halftime trailing UCLA 5-2.
"We had some chances in the
first quarter that we really had to
score on," Laster said. "We have
to put away more of our shots.
UCLA is a scrappy team. They
don't have a real go-to guy, but if
you let them stay in the game,
they can be real tough. We have to
bury those types of teams early."
During the third period of play,
the Cardinal began its patented
comeback. Twenty seconds into
the second half, senior Daniel
Lehoczky took a pass from Wallin
and flung the bail past Swanson,
bringing Dettamanti's squad to
within two.
The Bruins then notched
another goal on another 6-on-5
opportunity, but the Cardinal
kept pace when Wallin stuffed the
ball into the net after piecing
together a quick passing combina
tion with Laster.
The most spectacular play of
the match took place as time was
winding down in the third quar
ter. With the clock stopped with
less than 10 seconds to play,
Bowen held the ball, looking for
an outlet. He found Leachman at
the far end of the pool, positioned
in front of the UCLA goal. With

four seconds to go, Bowen hurled
the ball towards Leachman, who
was wrestling with his guard in
an attempt to gain the advantage.
The ball touched down just in
front of Leachman and, after a
split second of further struggle,
he rifled a backhand shot past a
bewildered Bruin goalie, pulling
the Cardinal to within one.
In the fourth quarter, Detta
manti's squad continued to
scratch and bite its way back into
the game. With six minutes, 18
seconds remaining in the game,
Lehoczky blazed down the pool on
the counterattack, eluding his
defender, and skipped the ball
into the net for his second point of
the game. The goal deadlocked
the Cardinal with the Bruins for
the first time since late in the first
quarter, and Stanford was not
done yet.
Looking like it might finally
break its three-game jinx, the
Cardinal continued to surge
offensively while keeping the Bru
ins at bay. With ;J:5O to go in the
final quarter, Stanford was
awarded a 6-on-5 situation. After
moving the ball around the
perimeter, Laster took a pass
from Wallin and sent the ball
screaming into the back of the
net, giving the Cardinal a 7-6
advantage.
