UCLA 8
Stanford ?

After three consecutive losses, the third-ranked
Stanford men's water polo team (12-6,1-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) was looking forward to
last Saturday's home game against fifth-ranked
UCLA as a chance to enjoy once again the sweet
taste of victory. But the Bruins had other plans and
dished out a distinctly unpalatable 8-7 loss at the
expense of the Cardinal.
The contest continued what has become a dis
turbing trend for the Cardinal. The Cardinal started
the game slowly, granted UCLA a sizable lead, ral
lied to tie the game and then lost the match as time
expired. It is a script which the team has adhered to
in each of its last three games.
Perhaps the only departure from the previous
three games was the fact that Cardinal initiated the
scoring. After several opportunities and a number of
near misses, Stanford collected the first goal of the
game when senior Jeremy Laster successfully con
verted a penalty shot just under three minutes into

the game.
Then it was UCLA's turn.
Two minutes after the Cardinal strike, the Bruins
answered with one of their own. Steve Covec rifled a
shot past senior goalie Jack Bowen to put UCLA on the
board. After playing the first five minutes of the game
without scoring, the Bruins took advantage of defen
sive miscues to reel off three additional unanswered
points in the final two minutes of the first quarter.
UCLA continued its scoring dominance to start
the second quarter with Mark Sutter firing the ball
past Bowen during a Bruin 6-on-5 situation. The
goal was the fifth in a row for the Bruins and gave
them a 5-1 lead.
"In the last few games, we have come out kind of
flat and spotted our opponents a considerable lead,"
said senior Josh Leachman. "We just haven't been
putting things together early. It's like we have to be
down before we start playing well."
For the remainder of the quarter, the Cardinal
could muster only one point on a strong play from
junior two-meter man Brian Wallin. Wallin received
a pass with a defender on his back and another
Bruin crashing in from the perimeter. He then pro
ceeded to evade one of the guards, muscle around
the other and complete the scoring opportunity by
flicking the ball past Bruin goalie Matt Swanson.
Stanford went into halftime trailing UCLA 5-2.
