# A
						tragic tale of two halves

UCLA 42
Stanford 28

The first half saw Stanford put
together its best 30 minutes of
football this season. The second
half saw the Cardinal put togeth
er its worst. Unfortunately, when
all was said and done last Satur
day, no one was talking about the
first half.
"The second half was like a
nightmare," said Cardinal defen
sive coordinator Bill Harris.
"They manhandled us. It's hard
to take."
En route to a 42-28 victory,
UCLA (5-2 overall, 2-2 Pacific 10
Conference) outscored Stanford
(4-2-1, 2-2) 35-7 after the break.
The game was as ugly as the
score. With running back Karim
Abdul-Jabbar leading the charge,
the Bruins racked up 323 yards of
total offense in the second half,
doubling the numbers they post
ed in the first half and very near
ly doubling the Cardinal's second
half performance.
"Last week [against Washing
ton! was unfortunate. It was our
first loss, and I said it was disap
pointing," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "This
one reaches a little bit beyond
that. This was not the effort we
need to have to retain our status
as a top-25 football team. We did
not put ourselves in a position to
win in the fourth quarter."
The loss knocks Stanford back

into the middle of the Pac-10 and
significantly dims the squad's
prospects of nabbing one of the
conference's four guaranteed
bowl berths. With 4-0 league
records, USC and Washington
appear to be locks for bowl bids.
At 3-1, Oregon also stands in good
shape. That leaves UCLA, Wash
ington State and the Cardinal, all
at 2-2, fighting for the remaining
spot.
Stanford's best bet is to take at
least three of its four remaining
contests — a tough task consider
ing that two take place on the
road at USC and WSU - and
hope that the Bruins drop their
final matches with the Huskies
and the Trojans. The Cougars
have a tough road ahead of them,
needing to win their four remain
ing games in order to accumulate
the six Division I victories neces
sary to qualify for a bowl game.
All of this speculation means
nothing to Willingham, however.
"IThat's] far ahead of where I
need to be right now, which is
[concentrating on] Oregon State,"
he said.
Willingham also has to think
about what went wrong and how
to correct it. After dominating
the Bruins in the first half and
entering the locker room ahead
21-7, the Cardinal defense fell
apart when play resumed. UCLA
marched 80 yards in two minutes
to open the second half and went
78 yards in 3:22 on its next pos
session to tie up the score.
"I think it's pretty obvious
what happened," said a disgusted
Pete Swanson. "We didn't make
plays. We missed tackles."
