# A 						tragic tale of two halves

UCLA 42
Stanford 28

The first half saw Stanford put
together its best 30 minutes of
football this season. The second
half saw the Cardinal put togeth
er its worst. Unfortunately, when
all was said and done last Satur
day, no one was talking about the
first half.
"The second half was like a
nightmare," said Cardinal defen
sive coordinator Bill Harris.
"They manhandled us. It's hard
to take."
En route to a 42-28 victory,
UCLA (5-2 overall, 2-2 Pacific 10
Conference) outscored Stanford
(4-2-1, 2-2) 35-7 after the break.
The game was as ugly as the
score. With running back Karim
Abdul-Jabbar leading the charge,
the Bruins racked up 323 yards of
total offense in the second half,
doubling the numbers they post
ed in the first half and very near
ly doubling the Cardinal's second
half performance.
"Last week [against Washing
ton! was unfortunate. It was our
first loss, and I said it was disap
pointing," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "This
one reaches a little bit beyond
that. This was not the effort we
need to have to retain our status
as a top-25 football team. We did
not put ourselves in a position to
win in the fourth quarter."
The loss knocks Stanford back

into the middle of the Pac-10 and
significantly dims the squad's
prospects of nabbing one of the
conference's four guaranteed
bowl berths. With 4-0 league
records, USC and Washington
appear to be locks for bowl bids.
At 3-1, Oregon also stands in good
shape. That leaves UCLA, Wash
ington State and the Cardinal, all
at 2-2, fighting for the remaining
spot.
Stanford's best bet is to take at
least three of its four remaining
contests — a tough task consider
ing that two take place on the
road at USC and WSU - and
hope that the Bruins drop their
final matches with the Huskies
and the Trojans. The Cougars
have a tough road ahead of them,
needing to win their four remain
ing games in order to accumulate
the six Division I victories neces
sary to qualify for a bowl game.
All of this speculation means
nothing to Willingham, however.
"IThat's] far ahead of where I
need to be right now, which is
[concentrating on] Oregon State,"
he said.
Willingham also has to think
about what went wrong and how
to correct it. After dominating
the Bruins in the first half and
entering the locker room ahead
21-7, the Cardinal defense fell
apart when play resumed. UCLA
marched 80 yards in two minutes
to open the second half and went
78 yards in 3:22 on its next pos
session to tie up the score.
"I think it's pretty obvious
what happened," said a disgusted
Pete Swanson. "We didn't make
plays. We missed tackles."
The overwhelming problem
that Stanford could not solve was
Abdul-Jabbar. The Pac-10's lead
ing rusher nuked Stanford for 261
yards and four touchdowns on 42
carries. Every time Abdul-Jabbar
touched the ball, at least a five
yard gain seemed guaranteed.
Although he never gained more
than 14 yards on a single carry, he
regularly busted through the
defensive line for runs of 10 and 11
yards.
"Any time you have a g<x>d back
— a good, legitimate star back —
he'll make you miss," Willingham
said. "Unfortunately, we didn't live
up to our end of the bargain."
Abdul-Jabbar's performance
drew rave reviews from coaches
and teammates.
"He had one of the greatest indi
vidual performances I've seen in
my career at UCI.A," said Bruin

head coach Terry Donahue. "He
just took over the game and won it
for us.
"Kariin gave it everything he
had. He was exhausted at the end
of the game. We called a time-out
with three minutes to go to give
him some rest."
Abdul-Jabbar's 261-yard total
amounted to a career-high, beating
his previous best of 187 (set against
Stanford in 1993) by a considerable
margin. It was also the third-high
est in Bruin history, behind Theo
tis Brown's 274 (versus Oregon in
1978) and Gaston Green's 266
(versus BYU in the 1986 Freedom
Bowl). In the three games he has
played against the Cardinal, Abdul-
Jabbar has registered 558 yards
and a 5.5-yards-per-attempt aver
age.
He didn't take all the credit for
his performance. The banged-up
Bruin offensive line, headlined by
Ail-American candidate Jonathan
Ogden, crushed the Stanford front
four in the second half.
"With the way our offensive line

was pushing, I can't say those
numbers surprise me," Abdul-Jab
bar said.
The play of Abdul-Jabbar
forced Stanford to concentrate
solely on him, allowing true fresh
man quarterback Cade McNown
time to develop. The young
McNown committed a critical
error in the first quarter to set up
the Cardinal's first score of the
game. Hoping to avoid a safety, he
tossed the ball into the line and
sophomore defensive end Carl
Hansen grablxnl it at the Bruins'
5-yard line.
However, after the rookie mis
take, McNown settled down. His
play became virtually indistin
guishable from that of a gridiron
veteran. He completed 15 of 27
passes for 150 yards and rushed 10
times for 57 yards.
"He played well after the first
series," said Cardinal free safety
Josh Madsen. "You have to give
him credit for running the show
the way he did."
The athleticism of' t he freshman

gave the Bruins the opportunity to
employ option plays, something
the Cardinal will see non-stop next
week versus the Beavers. The tac
tic garnered some considerable
gains.
"Some calls are good against the
option. Some aren't," Willingham
said. "They caught us on some bad
calls."
The Cardinal regained the lead
with 4:14 remaining in the third
period on a 10-yard pass from quar
terback Mark Butterfield to junior
Brian Manning. The touchdown
toss was Butterfield's fourth on the
day, a career-high. When Eric
Abrams added the extra point, the
placekicker became the school's all
time leading scorer with 255 career
points, moving past John Hopkins'
254-point mark.
The celebrations were short
lived, however. A UCLA punt
pinned Stanford near its own goal
line, and when the offense failed to
convert a first down, the Bruins
regained the ball on the Cardinal's
11. On the fourth play of the drive,

McNown hit Tod Mcßride for a 28-
yard touchdown to deadlock the
score once again.
On UCLA's next possession, a
pitch to Abdul-Jabbar for a 10-vard
touchdown gave the Bruins their
first lead of the game with 11:34
remaining in the contest.
Stanford fought back, driving
the length of the field to UCLA's 4-
yard line with just over eight min
utes left. Butterfield attempted to
force the ball into the end zone, but
cornerback Teddy Lawrence
deflected it up into the air away
from Manning, and Bruin
linebacker Abdul McCullough
came down with the ball.
"IManning) was my first read,"
Butterfield said. "It was one-on
one and I thought Manning would
shake him. The defensive back
made a nice play."
"Teddy got his hand on it and
gave me the gift," McCullough
said. "I'll take it."
The interception didn't have to
be the nail in Stanford's coffin if
the Cardinal could just force a punt

and get the ball back. But the bat
tered Cardinal defense couldn't
withstand any more Bruin attacks.
UCLA and Abdul-Jabbar ran out
most of the clock with a seven
minute, 11-second drive culminat
ing in a touchdown.
The disastrous second half over
shadowed Stanford's first half per
formance, in which the team out
gained the Bruins 222 to 139 and
made miry an error.
Butterfield threw for 221 yards
and four touchdowns on the day
but took his share of the blame for
the second-half collapse.
"Personally, I wasn't in sync in
the second half," Butterfield said.
"Things weren't clicking."
Stanford's ability to compete in
the Pac-10 now rests on its ability
to recover from the devastating
loss.
"We're not down and out,"
junior running back Mike Mitchell
said. "We just need to correct the
mistakes we made in the second
half. We showed how good a team
we can be in the first half."
