Completing the most dominant two weeks of
play in recent memory, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team swept No. 17 USC (9-6 overall, 6-5
Pacific 10 Conference) and No. 10 UCLA (10-6, 5-
5) in weekend matches at Maples Pavilion. The

No, 4 Gardinal (17-2, 11-0) ends its homestand
with a comfortable two-game lead in the Pac-10
over second-place Washington State.
Against the Trojans on Sunday, Stanford got
off to a slow start before rolling to a 12-15, 15-7,
15-9, 15-6 victory. By game four, Stanford had
settled down to post one of its best offensive per
formances of the season. Stanford used strong hit
ting from sophomore Kristin Folkl and senior
Cary Wendell to build a 9-2 lead.
A controversial call helped Stanford extend its
lead. A kill from USC freshman Jasmina
Marinkovich was ruled out and the call sparked a
passionate outburst from Trojan coach Lisa Love.
Referee Mickey Matthews, who overruled the line
judge to call the ball out, would have none of
Love's complaints, giving her two consecutive red
cards and awarding the Cardinal
two points. With the Cardinal
ahead 11-2, Stanford junior Eileen
Murfee served up an ace to make it
12-2.
After a time-out, the Trojans
regrouped to take four of the next
five points. However, Stanford used
its strong sideout game to ward off
any chance of a comeback, and a kill
by senior outside hitter Wendy
Hromadka as well as a block from
Stanford's front line provided the
match's final points.
Sophomore middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika, who registered nine
kills, five digs, one solo block and
four block assists, credited Stan
ford's defense for doing the job
against USC. "Our sideout game
was tough," she said. "We got off to
a slow start and we know that with
them blocking well, points wouldn't
come easy, so we really concentrat
ed on getting every sideout."
A look at match statistics con
firms Ifejika's point. After game
one, USC never managed to string
more than three points together at
any one time. This kept the pres
sure off Stanford's offense, provid
ing a comfort zone for Wendell and
sophomore setter Lisa Sharpley to
continue setting Folkl, senior out
side hitter Marnie Triefenbach ;uid
Murfee.
USC, after having won seven of
its last eight matches since Stan
ford beat the Trojans at Pauley
Pavilion on Sept. 22, came out
strong in game one. The unusual
1 p.m. starting time seemed to
bother Stanford more than the
Trojans, who were coming off an
easy victory over Cal on Friday
and an emotional five-game win
against archrival UCLA last
Wednesday.
Using a strong middle-blocking
attack, USC held Stanford to a .214
hitting percentage in game one. On
offense, the Trojans were firing on
all cylinders, finishing the game
with a .323 hitting percentage. Still,
the Cardinal managed to sideout
enough to keep the game competi
tive, planting the seeds for its even
tual domination when USC slowed
down.
Last year's Second Team Ail-
American Kelly Kuebler keyed
USC's offense. Kuebler, a 6-foot
senior from Ix»s Alamitos, Calif.,
recorded 23 kills in the match. She
hit .341 despite getting 44 hitting

attempts.
"We did a pretty good job defen
sively, except for Kuebler," said
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw.
"She had an outstanding game. We
slowed her down a little in game
four, where she made some errors,
but you can't have the person who
took the most hits hitting the high
est percentage."
Came two began as a polar oppo
site of game one, as Stanford
jumped out to a 6-1 advantage and
coasted to an easy 15-7 victory.
Stanford got its own blocking
attack in gear and used its ability to
sideout at will to give itself repeated
chances to score.
After hitting exception .'illy well
in game one, USC couldn't get it
going for the rest of the match. In
game two, the Trojans hit just .128.
They reduced some of those errors
in game three for a .216 clip but fell
back to .188 in the final game. Stan
ford, meanwhile, rolled after game
one, hitting .410, .400 and .347 in
the final three games to finish the
match with a .353 percentage. For
the match, USC hit .202, more
than 150 percentage points less
than the Cardinal.
"It wasn't a great effort, but we
did some good things on offense,"
Shaw said. "[USC's hitting percent
age of] .202 Ls high, but we did a
pretty good job on defense. We just
weren't ready to play at first. They
came out with a completely differ
ent lineup and we weren't prepared
for it."
Folkl echoed Shaw's sentiments
concerning the slow start. "They
have a really complex offense," she
said. "They send people all over the
place and we just had to get used to
that."
Ifejika credited USC's middle
blockers with the Trojans' early
success. "Their middle blockers
were ready today," she said. "They
did a good job of reading our
offense."
Sunday's match featured anoth
er outstanding performance from
Wendell. The 6-foot senior hit .455
and came within one dig of yet
another triple-double. For the
match, Wendell amassed 12 kills
and 32 assists. Folkl led the team
with 18 kills and hit an amazing
.519 while Sharpley posted 11 kills
and hit .526.
Friday's match against UCLA,
played in front of a raucous 4,107 at
Maples, proceeded much like yes
terday's match, as the Cardinal
shook off a slow start to dominate
the Bruins 15-11, 15-1, 15-7.
Initially, the Cardinal suffered

from passing errors, which forced
Sharpley and Wendell to set balls to
the outside more than they would
like. UCLA keyed on that and man
aged to keep t he ball in play, giving
itself chances to score.
"We didn't pass well early,"
Shaw said. "We're much better
when we distribute our kills more
evenly rather than sending every
thing outside."
After UCLA took an 11-8 lead in
game one, Shaw inserted Triefen
bach into the Stanford lineup to
improve the team's passing. Seven
straight points biter, Stanford got a
15-11 victory mid the rout was on.
Game two's 15-1 display was the
Cardinal's best single-game perfor
mance this season. Kills Hew from
everywhere as the usually mighty
Bruins looked helpless.
"Everything was on," Folkl said.
"Our blocking was good, we spread
our kills out and we improved our
passing. We haven't passed as well
as we can this season, but our set
ters are doing a great job with what
we're giving them."
The key to Friday's victory was
the Cardinal's middle attack. The

quick set to Ifejika and Murfee net
ted 18 kills for the Cardinal, with
Ifejika garnering 11 of them on her
way to a .588 hitting percentage.
'Barbara and Eileen did a good
job," Shaw said. "When our middle
attack is on, it opens things up for
us."
When Stanford did have to go
outside, Folkl was ready. Last
year's National Freshman of the
Year recorded 13 kills, hit .364 and
registered nine digs in her best
defensive effort of the year. Folkl
attributes much of her improved
defense to her experience this sum
mer training with the Lnited
States National Team.
"I learned a lot about reading
the other team's offense [while
playing for the national team],"
Folkl said. "It helps me position
myself for more digs."
Stanford's weekend sweep puts
the Cardinal in a good position
before this week's trip to Arizona.
"These were positive matches
for us," Ifejika said. "The last few
matches, we've improved our level
of play, and the team is feeling pret
tv good."

than 150 percentage points less
than the Cardinal.
"It wasn't a great effort, but we
did some good things on offense,"
Shaw said. "[USC's hitting percent
age of] .202 Ls high, but we did a
pretty good job on defense. We just
weren't ready to play at first. They
came out with a completely differ
ent lineup and we weren't prepared
for it."
Folkl echoed Shaw's sentiments
concerning the slow start. "They
have a really complex offense," she
said. "They send people all over the
place and we just had to get used to
that."
Ifejika credited USC's middle
blockers with the Trojans' early
success. "Their middle blockers
were ready today," she said. "They
did a good job of reading our
offense."
Sunday's match featured anoth
er outstanding performance from
Wendell. The 6-foot senior hit .455
and came within one dig of yet
another triple-double. For the
match, Wendell amassed 12 kills
and 32 assists. Folkl led the team
with 18 kills and hit an amazing
.519 while Sharpley posted 11 kills
and hit .526.
Friday's match against UCLA,
played in front of a raucous 4,107 at
Maples, proceeded much like yes
terday's match, as the Cardinal
shook off a slow start to dominate
the Bruins 15-11, 15-1, 15-7.
Initially, the Cardinal suffered

from passing errors, which forced
Sharpley and Wendell to set balls to
the outside more than they would
like. UCLA keyed on that and man
aged to keep t he ball in play, giving
itself chances to score.
"We didn't pass well early,"
Shaw said. "We're much better
when we distribute our kills more
evenly rather than sending every
thing outside."
After UCLA took an 11-8 lead in
game one, Shaw inserted Triefen
bach into the Stanford lineup to
improve the team's passing. Seven
straight points biter, Stanford got a
15-11 victory mid the rout was on.
Game two's 15-1 display was the
Cardinal's best single-game perfor
mance this season. Kills Hew from
everywhere as the usually mighty
Bruins looked helpless.
"Everything was on," Folkl said.
"Our blocking was good, we spread
our kills out and we improved our
passing. We haven't passed as well
as we can this season, but our set
ters are doing a great job with what
we're giving them."
The key to Friday's victory was
the Cardinal's middle attack. The

quick set to Ifejika and Murfee net
ted 18 kills for the Cardinal, with
Ifejika garnering 11 of them on her
way to a .588 hitting percentage.
'Barbara and Eileen did a good
job," Shaw said. "When our middle
attack is on, it opens things up for
us."
When Stanford did have to go
outside, Folkl was ready. Last
year's National Freshman of the
Year recorded 13 kills, hit .364 and
registered nine digs in her best
defensive effort of the year. Folkl
attributes much of her improved
defense to her experience this sum
mer training with the Lnited
States National Team.
"I learned a lot about reading
the other team's offense [while
playing for the national team],"
Folkl said. "It helps me position
myself for more digs."
Stanford's weekend sweep puts
the Cardinal in a good position
before this week's trip to Arizona.
"These were positive matches
for us," Ifejika said. "The last few
matches, we've improved our level
of play, and the team is feeling pret
tv good."

Sophomore Kristin Folkl prepares to pass the ball to a Cardinal set
ter during the Stanford's weekend sweep of USC and UCLA.

Completing the most dominant two weeks of
play in recent memory, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team swept No. 17 USC (9-6 overall, 6-5
Pacific 10 Conference) and No. 10 UCLA (10-6, 5-
5) in weekend matches at Maples Pavilion. The

No, 4 Gardinal (17-2, 11-0) ends its homestand
with a comfortable two-game lead in the Pac-10
over second-place Washington State.
Against the Trojans on Sunday, Stanford got
off to a slow start before rolling to a 12-15, 15-7,
15-9, 15-6 victory. By game four, Stanford had
settled down to post one of its best offensive per
formances of the season. Stanford used strong hit
ting from sophomore Kristin Folkl and senior
Cary Wendell to build a 9-2 lead.
A controversial call helped Stanford extend its
lead. A kill from USC freshman Jasmina
Marinkovich was ruled out and the call sparked a
passionate outburst from Trojan coach Lisa Love.
Referee Mickey Matthews, who overruled the line
judge to call the ball out, would have none of
Love's complaints, giving her two consecutive red
cards and awarding the Cardinal
two points. With the Cardinal
ahead 11-2, Stanford junior Eileen
Murfee served up an ace to make it
12-2.
After a time-out, the Trojans
regrouped to take four of the next
five points. However, Stanford used
its strong sideout game to ward off
any chance of a comeback, and a kill
by senior outside hitter Wendy
Hromadka as well as a block from
Stanford's front line provided the
match's final points.
Sophomore middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika, who registered nine
kills, five digs, one solo block and
four block assists, credited Stan
ford's defense for doing the job
against USC. "Our sideout game
was tough," she said. "We got off to
a slow start and we know that with
them blocking well, points wouldn't
come easy, so we really concentrat
ed on getting every sideout."
A look at match statistics con
firms Ifejika's point. After game
one, USC never managed to string
more than three points together at
any one time. This kept the pres
sure off Stanford's offense, provid
ing a comfort zone for Wendell and
sophomore setter Lisa Sharpley to
continue setting Folkl, senior out
side hitter Marnie Triefenbach ;uid
Murfee.
USC, after having won seven of
its last eight matches since Stan
ford beat the Trojans at Pauley
Pavilion on Sept. 22, came out
strong in game one. The unusual
1 p.m. starting time seemed to
bother Stanford more than the
Trojans, who were coming off an
easy victory over Cal on Friday
and an emotional five-game win
against archrival UCLA last
Wednesday.
Using a strong middle-blocking
attack, USC held Stanford to a .214
hitting percentage in game one. On
offense, the Trojans were firing on
all cylinders, finishing the game
with a .323 hitting percentage. Still,
the Cardinal managed to sideout
enough to keep the game competi
tive, planting the seeds for its even
tual domination when USC slowed
down.
Last year's Second Team Ail-
American Kelly Kuebler keyed
USC's offense. Kuebler, a 6-foot
senior from Ix»s Alamitos, Calif.,
recorded 23 kills in the match. She
hit .341 despite getting 44 hitting

attempts.
"We did a pretty good job defen
sively, except for Kuebler," said
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw.
"She had an outstanding game. We
slowed her down a little in game
four, where she made some errors,
but you can't have the person who
took the most hits hitting the high
est percentage."
Came two began as a polar oppo
site of game one, as Stanford
jumped out to a 6-1 advantage and
coasted to an easy 15-7 victory.
Stanford got its own blocking
attack in gear and used its ability to
sideout at will to give itself repeated
chances to score.
After hitting exception .'illy well
in game one, USC couldn't get it
going for the rest of the match. In
game two, the Trojans hit just .128.
They reduced some of those errors
in game three for a .216 clip but fell
back to .188 in the final game. Stan
ford, meanwhile, rolled after game
one, hitting .410, .400 and .347 in
the final three games to finish the
match with a .353 percentage. For
the match, USC hit .202, more
than 150 percentage points less
than the Cardinal.
"It wasn't a great effort, but we
did some good things on offense,"
Shaw said. "[USC's hitting percent
age of] .202 Ls high, but we did a
pretty good job on defense. We just
weren't ready to play at first. They
