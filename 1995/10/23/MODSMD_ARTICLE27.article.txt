The Cardinal men's soccer
team (4-9-1 overall, 1-4-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
broke a winless streak yesterday
that extended back to Sept. 10
with a 1-0 home victory over Air
Force (7-6-1, 2-4-0). After falling
1-0 to conference rival Sacramen
to State (5-9-1, 1-4-1) at Maloney
Field on Friday, Stanford played
with an aggressiveness inspired
by frustration and pride, and the
team was more relieved than jubi
lant after shelving an awfully fat
shoulder monkey with the win.
"It's nice to win, but we keep
making it difficult for ourselves,"
said head coach Colin Lindores.
"We hope this win helps us turn
the corner."
A bruisingly intense first half
afforded no advantage to either
team. However, the stalemate did
not result from a lack of scoring
opportunities. Both teams rapidly
pushed the ball up and down the
field releasing shots that were
unable to find the area of rejoice
between the goal posts.
In the second half, the Cardi
nal scored the winning goal. After
multiple advances and retreats,


Red Byer â€” Oaily
Freshman Aaron Jones pushes the ball downfield with an Air Force
defender on his tail. The Cardinal pulled out the win 1-0.
