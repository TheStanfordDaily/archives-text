The Cardinal men's soccer
team (4-9-1 overall, 1-4-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
broke a winless streak yesterday
that extended back to Sept. 10
with a 1-0 home victory over Air
Force (7-6-1, 2-4-0). After falling
1-0 to conference rival Sacramen
to State (5-9-1, 1-4-1) at Maloney
Field on Friday, Stanford played
with an aggressiveness inspired
by frustration and pride, and the
team was more relieved than jubi
lant after shelving an awfully fat
shoulder monkey with the win.
"It's nice to win, but we keep
making it difficult for ourselves,"
said head coach Colin Lindores.
"We hope this win helps us turn
the corner."
A bruisingly intense first half
afforded no advantage to either
team. However, the stalemate did
not result from a lack of scoring
opportunities. Both teams rapidly
pushed the ball up and down the
field releasing shots that were
unable to find the area of rejoice
between the goal posts.
In the second half, the Cardi
nal scored the winning goal. After
multiple advances and retreats,


Red Byer â€” Oaily
Freshman Aaron Jones pushes the ball downfield with an Air Force
defender on his tail. The Cardinal pulled out the win 1-0.
Stanford eventually camped out
in front of the Air Force goal box,
determined to score. A nasty bat
tle for possession ended when an
off-balance shot ricocheted off the
top bar and freshman A.J. Sauer
slapped the ball with the top of his
foot, successfully bouncing it over
the Air Force defenders and goal
keeper into the back of the net.
Both goalkeepers performed
exceptionally well. Stanford
freshman Jon Bruck earned the
shutout after posting six saves.
Air Force senior Matt Mennell
recorded five saves.
As for the Sacramento State
match, the Hornets' winning goal
came from Curtis Holmes 12 min
uter into the game. Sacramento
State then managed to prevent
the l Cardinal from scoring in the
remaining 78 minutes. The Hor
nets won their first road game

and first MPSF game of the year
in the defensive struggle.
Team chemistry plays a large
part in the success of a squad, and
with Sunday's win, the Cardinal
may have found the right mix
ture. The struggles the Cardinal
has experienced this season has
allowed Stanford the luxury to
look at many players in many
positions.
"We are looking for that team
chemistry, that magic, but many
of our lineup changes result from
injuries," Lindores said. "We
don't sit in a dark room and look
for any special formula." Lin
dores singled out seniors Ryan
Estevez, Carmen D'Onofrio and
Chet Zimmer for praise-worthy
accomplishments in 1995.
The Cardinal needed the victo
ry against Air Force. Now, with
the modest beginnings of a win
streak under its belt, Stanford
will take each match as it comes,
preserving a little more dignity
and gaining more confidence with
every triumph.
