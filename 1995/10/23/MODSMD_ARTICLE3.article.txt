### Adam Kemezis 
Responding to recent increases in layoffs,
representatives of staff organizations raised
their concerns to University President Ger
hard Casper at a forum held Friday in Kresge
Auditorium.
The event was the first of this year's "Noon-
Time Series" â€” quarterly discussions spon
sored by the Office of Multicultural Develop
ment and by various staff organizations on
campus.
Friday's program, which drew a small but
attentive audience, was titled "A Conversation
With Gerhard Casper."
After giving an opening speech, Casper took
questions from a panel of representatives of
staff organizations. The session concluded
with a brief period of questions from the floor.
In his opening, Casper reflected on the

changes at Stanford in the past
three years. He alluded to the
formulation of "post-Centen
nial priorities" which he said
meant "re-focusing Stanford
on its core academic tasks" in a
climate of "restoration, preser
vation and innovation."
Casper also spoke about the
reorganization of the adminis
tration that has taken place

since he took office, noting that there has been
considerable "downsizing," and that the num
ber of vice presidents has been reduced from 12
to four.
Much of the questioning revolved around
the issue of layoffs. Many of the representa
tives asked what efforts the administration
was making to increase diversity in hiring and
promotions.

Katrina Jaggears of the African-American
Staff Forum wondered if such efforts might
suffer in "an atmosphere of layoffs and major
ity-culture backlash."
Casper said that "there is no room at Stan
ford for any backlash by anybody." He quoted
figures indicating increases in minority hiring
in recent years even as layoffs have increased.
Casper noted that, while the layoffs have in
creased, Stanford "simply has not seen the
kind of layoffs that have become routine in in
dustry."
Hut Casper declined to say that layoffs
would stop. That would lead to "an untenable
position, as the rest of society . . . increases its
productivity," he said.
He also noted that the growing degree of
specialization necessary in the University's
