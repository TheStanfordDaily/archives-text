# Casper takes questions on layoffs
## 
### Adam Kemezis 
Responding to recent increases in layoffs,
representatives of staff organizations raised
their concerns to University President Ger
hard Casper at a forum held Friday in Kresge
Auditorium.
The event was the first of this year's "Noon-
Time Series" â€” quarterly discussions spon
sored by the Office of Multicultural Develop
ment and by various staff organizations on
campus.
Friday's program, which drew a small but
attentive audience, was titled "A Conversation
With Gerhard Casper."
After giving an opening speech, Casper took
questions from a panel of representatives of
staff organizations. The session concluded
with a brief period of questions from the floor.
In his opening, Casper reflected on the

changes at Stanford in the past
three years. He alluded to the
formulation of "post-Centen
nial priorities" which he said
meant "re-focusing Stanford
on its core academic tasks" in a
climate of "restoration, preser
vation and innovation."
Casper also spoke about the
reorganization of the adminis
tration that has taken place

since he took office, noting that there has been
considerable "downsizing," and that the num
ber of vice presidents has been reduced from 12
to four.
Much of the questioning revolved around
the issue of layoffs. Many of the representa
tives asked what efforts the administration
was making to increase diversity in hiring and
promotions.

Katrina Jaggears of the African-American
Staff Forum wondered if such efforts might
suffer in "an atmosphere of layoffs and major
ity-culture backlash."
Casper said that "there is no room at Stan
ford for any backlash by anybody." He quoted
figures indicating increases in minority hiring
in recent years even as layoffs have increased.
Casper noted that, while the layoffs have in
creased, Stanford "simply has not seen the
kind of layoffs that have become routine in in
dustry."
Hut Casper declined to say that layoffs
would stop. That would lead to "an untenable
position, as the rest of society . . . increases its
productivity," he said.
He also noted that the growing degree of
specialization necessary in the University's


Casper
hiring makes "proportional repre
sentation" of ethnic groups impos
sible.
Sunny Toy of Stanford Staffers
asked what the University will do
to maintain tolerance and a "posi
tive workplace" in a time when the
threat of layoffs aggravates the
perception that staff members are

"overworked, unappreciated and
unrewarded."
While admitting that Stanford
is "not an ivory tower," Casper said
that its overall record in the areas
of tolerance and diversity is
"incredibly good." He also noted
that the feeling of being "over
worked, unappreciated and unre
warded" is widespread.
Casper added that the "tension
increases as opportunity decreas
es," and that staff is indeed work
ing harder than it once did.

In response to the same ques
tion, Barbara Butterfield, vice
president of Faculty and Staff
Services, said Casper's figure of
2(). r > layoffs in 1993-94 might
appear "less substantial" when
compared with the norm of 100
and 150 layoffs a year "before
the present financial con
straints."
During the concluding period of
floor questions, both of the two
questioners, Jack Truher, a SLAC
physicist, and Elizabeth Hiyama,

who works in the Office of Residen
tial Education, said greater consul
tation with staff in formulating
University policy might improve
t he atmosphere.
Gasper replied that there is
already a degree of consultation. In
particular, he cited staff input into
the formation of the new sexual
harassment policy.
But he also noted that the same
policy had been "lingering in con
sultation" for three years prior to
his involvement, and that some

way had to be kept open to "close
the process."
While neither Casper nor his
questioners expressed faith in gov
ernment by consensus, Casper did
admit that the "more hectic pace"
of today's workplace does lead to a
lack of consultation.
One questioner, Pam Kwok of
the Asian Staff Forum, raised
the issue of "budgetary or moral
support" for staff who wish to
engage in volunteer activities.
She was seconded on this con

cern by Sally Dickson, director of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment and a former resident
fellow in Ujamaa.
Casper stressed that "volun
teer work is volunteer work" and
that "adults must make choices
as to the way they use their
time."
He also said that "everyone is
being asked ... to do more in less
time" and that the University can
no longer be as "accommodating"
as in the past.
