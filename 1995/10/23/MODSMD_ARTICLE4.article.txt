# Zapatistas celebrate 25 years with film

### Curtis Sittenfeld 
Among students who have
never stepped inside Casa Zapata,
the idea persists that the Chicano
theme house is brimming with
militant residents who, said
freshman Francisco Najera, "talk
about being oppressed and only
speak Spanish." In order to clari
fy such misconceptions and cele
brate Casa Zapata's 25th an
niversary, residents like Najera
will spend the next two years
preparing a documentary that
conveys the true nature of the
house.
According to Lora Ramiro,
Casa Zapata's resident fellow and
assistant professor of English,
members of the Stanford commu
nity established Casa Zapata dur
ing a larger, more national Chi
cano movement. The house at
tempted to respond to the "ab
sence of support structures for
Chicano students and to their
feelings of disenfranchisement,"

said Ramiro.
Today, as the University re
quires, the house is half Chicano
and half non-Chicano. For the
non-Chicano students, Ramiro
said she believes that Casa Zapata
offers "the experience of living
with people different from them
— not a kind of token multicul
turalism but one which will be
genuinely educational."
For Chicano students, Casa
Zapata "provides a way of negoti
ating between their academic
commitments and their commit
ments to public service, and it re
minds them that connection is
important, and it gives them re
sources," she said.
In initiating the production of
the documentary, Ramiro's goals
are twofold: first, to "record the
tradit ions of the house so as to en
sure that they'll continue into the
future," and second, "as a way of
informing the campus communi
ty at large."
The format of the documen

tary will bo a combination of in
terviews, narration, archival
video footage and current
footage. In preparation for film
ing, Ramiro is teaching a weekly
video production course to resi
dents, as well as offering a Chi

cano documentary film and video
series.
Many of the traditions Ramiro
anticipates filming were institut
ed by the previous RFs, Cecilia
and Tony Burciaga.
In 1994, Cecilia's job was ter

minated due to administrative
budget cuts. Five Casa Zapata res
idents went on a hunger strike to
simultaneously protest Cecilia's
termination and Stanford's grape
policy, among other issues.
Ramiro identifies the Burciagas

as "house historians" and ex
plains that the documentary is "in
part a response to the significant
loss of the Burciagas' presence."

dent documentarians hope to catch
on camera is Cinco de Mavo. The
celebration commemorates a late
19th century battle in which a
small Mexican army in Puebla,
Mexico defeated a much larger
French army
Another celebration, which
senior and resident assistant Anto
nio Gomez describes as "one of my
favorites," is the zoot suit party.
"The party celebrates the Chi
canos who went through a lot of

adversity in the [United States] in
the World War II era. There were
riots in LA and throughout the
west. Zoot suiters were seen as
gangsters," Gomez said. For the
festivities, men, not surprisingly,
wear zoot suits; women wear
chunky-heeled shoes, seamed
stockings and forties-style dresses.
The event is "a celebration of sur
vival," said Gomez.
On a more regular basis, Casa
Zapata carries on the tradition of
ma.nan.itas. "At the stroke of mid
night," explained Gomez, "a group
of residents serenade the birthday
person with a traditional Spanish
birthday song, then with the

English birthday song, then the
birthday person ends up in the
shower fully clothed."
Gomez said he is not familiar
with exactly how the showering
element was implemented in
mananitas. He does, however, offer
it as evidence that Casa Zapata is a
house marked by enthusiasm and
closeness When describing their
home, Gomez and other residents
invoke the word familia, which
they say am be loosely translated
as "energy and bonding."
As residents prepare for the doc
umentary, they feel optimistic
about capturing what freshman
Joel Ramirez calls "the true feel

ings of transition the house has
gone through and what the house
symbolizes."
Residents said they hope that
"true feelings" will dispel myths that
Casa Zapata is a hostile or intimidat
ing place to outsiders. "Although it
is a Chicano theme house, people
who aren't of Latin descent feel
just as comfortable here," said
freshman Edelina Burciaga.
"There's something about Zapa
ta that keeps people coming back,"
added Gomez. "We have a saying;
once a Zapatista, always a Zap
atista. Once you've lived here,
you're a part of the culture, the
Zapata legacy."
