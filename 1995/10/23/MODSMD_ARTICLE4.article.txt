# Zapatistas celebrate 25 years with film

Among students who have
never stepped inside Casa Zapata,
the idea persists that the Chicano
theme house is brimming with
militant residents who, said
freshman Francisco Najera, "talk
about being oppressed and only
speak Spanish." In order to clari
fy such misconceptions and cele
brate Casa Zapata's 25th an
niversary, residents like Najera
will spend the next two years
preparing a documentary that
conveys the true nature of the
house.
According to Lora Ramiro,
Casa Zapata's resident fellow and
assistant professor of English,
members of the Stanford commu
nity established Casa Zapata dur
ing a larger, more national Chi
cano movement. The house at
tempted to respond to the "ab
sence of support structures for
Chicano students and to their
feelings of disenfranchisement,"

said Ramiro.
Today, as the University re
quires, the house is half Chicano
and half non-Chicano. For the
non-Chicano students, Ramiro
said she believes that Casa Zapata
offers "the experience of living
with people different from them
— not a kind of token multicul
turalism but one which will be
genuinely educational."
For Chicano students, Casa
Zapata "provides a way of negoti
ating between their academic
commitments and their commit
ments to public service, and it re
minds them that connection is
important, and it gives them re
sources," she said.
In initiating the production of
the documentary, Ramiro's goals
are twofold: first, to "record the
tradit ions of the house so as to en
sure that they'll continue into the
future," and second, "as a way of
informing the campus communi
ty at large."
The format of the documen

tary will bo a combination of in
terviews, narration, archival
video footage and current
footage. In preparation for film
ing, Ramiro is teaching a weekly
video production course to resi
dents, as well as offering a Chi

cano documentary film and video
series.
Many of the traditions Ramiro
anticipates filming were institut
ed by the previous RFs, Cecilia
and Tony Burciaga.
In 1994, Cecilia's job was ter

minated due to administrative
budget cuts. Five Casa Zapata res
idents went on a hunger strike to
simultaneously protest Cecilia's
termination and Stanford's grape
policy, among other issues.
Ramiro identifies the Burciagas

as "house historians" and ex
plains that the documentary is "in
part a response to the significant
loss of the Burciagas' presence."

Casa Zapata residents participate in a film production class led by Resident Fellow Laura Ramiro, assistant professor of English. The
class is currently putting together a documentary commemorating the house's 25th anniversary.
