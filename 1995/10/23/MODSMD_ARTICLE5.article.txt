# Tax on postdocs cuts $1 million from research
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
A tightened Internal Revenue
Service definition of what consti
tutes a student will cost the Uni
versity more than $1 million in
research funds beginning this
year.
Because postdoctoral scholars
are no longer classified as students,
they now have to pay federal social
security and disability taxes
amounting to 8.5 percent of their
income.
Professors who employ postdocs
pay a matching amount out of their
research budgets â€” money which is
paid out through the University's
staff benefits pool.
The policy, which Stanford im
plemented Sept. 1, affects the ap
proximately 500 postdocs who re
ceive money from the University's
payroll, said George Dekker, associ
ate dean of graduate policy. Post
docs who have outside fellowships
and those who work at Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, howev
er, are excluded.

A strain on research budgets

The funds to
pay for the match
ing taxes will
come directly
from individual
professors' re
search budgets,
department heads
said.
Costs will ini
tially be charged

to the staff benefits pool but will
then be passed on to the depart
ments and finally to individual pro
fessors.
"The staff benefits rate is
charged to individual depart
ments," said Benefits Manager
Nancy Walsworth. Departments
then pay money into an account
that funds the staff benefit pool.
"These people (postdocs) are not
paid by the department but instead
by the individual professors' re
search money," said David Pollard,
professor of geological and environ
mental sciences and chair of the de


Dekker
partment. As a result, the depart
ments will pass the additional tax
burden along to professors.
These taxes will significantly
drain research funds and may even
result in the hiring of fewer post
docs.
"The taxes will definitely have a
negative effect," said Geophysics
Prof. Mark Zoback, chair of the
department. "It's not going to
make it any easier to fund post
docs."
Zoback said that while the
change may not reduce the num
ber of postdocs, it will "decrease
. . . the total amount of funding
available for research."
"It's going to make it harder to
employ as many postdocs as
before," added Andrew Hoffman,
associate professor of medicine. "It
could decrease the number of post
docs employed since they will cost
8 or 9 percent more and money is
getting tighter from [the National
Institutes of Health]."
Richard Scheller, an associate
investigator in molecular and cel
lular physiology, agreed, arguing
that this policy will further dimin
ish professors' ability to do
research.
"This a symptom of what is
happening over and over again in
trying to fund scientific research,"
Scheller said. "The bottom line is
much less science per grant dollar,
and those grant dollars are getting
harder to come by."
Even so, some professors are
attempting to mitigate the effects
of the new taxes by continuing to
employ the same number of post
docs. Hoffman, for one, said he
intends to pursue such a policy.
Postdocs also stand to lose
Besides decreasing the funds
available for research, the new tax
has impacted the finances of
already strapped postdocs.
"Since I am going into my
fourth year |as a postdoc], I should
be seeing a 5 percent raise. As a
result of [the taxes], I will receive
$1,000 less than last year's
salary," said Lillian Chiang, a post
doc in neurobiology. "I am very
concerned since I am going to
receive less money this year than I
was living on last year."
"It is always a bit of a shock if
you receive a lower income in year
two than in year one," said

Howard Schulman, professor of
neurobiology. "Any drop in the
salary is emotionally damaging as
well as financially damaging."
Stefan Brocke, who just fin
ished four years of postdoctoral
studies in neurology, agreed, say
ing that the negative effect of the
taxes will be exacerbated by a
trend toward longer postdoctoral
studies.
"The stipends are rather low
even without the taxes, and people
tend to do postdocs of three to four
years or even longer," Brocke said.
"Many postdocs are in their begin
ning or mid-30s and have fami
lies."
To compensate for the new
taxes, the University has raised
the minimum wage for postdocs.
"We raised the minimum
stipend for postdocs. .. (since] this
is basically an 8.5 percent decrease
in net income," said Dekker,
though he did not specify the exact
increase.
However, increasing the mini
mum salary could exacerbate the
toll the taxes take on research bud
gets, Dekker added.
In addition, some postdocs feel
the increase is insufficient, and
others who are already making
more th.in the minimum salary
may see no raise in pay.
Any increase from the current
minimum salary of $21,000 is still
"not sufficient to make ends meet"
in the Stanford area, Brocke said.
Coping with diminished funds
Despite their stmined research
budgets, some professors are look
ing for additional funds to pay
postdocs.
Schulman said he will compen
sate his postdocs for the difference
this year.
"We should have the faculty
make up the increase," Schulman
said. "The overall policy should be
that postdocs live in a rather
expensive area and we should pro
vide them with sufficient funds to
live here and carry out work.
"We have to balance that with
increasing pressure from govern
ment grants as they are smaller
and harder to come by," he added.
Even so, Schulman admitted
that some professors may have
problems making up the salary
this year.
"For some, [increasing salaries)
will be difficult to do without prior
planning," Schulman said. "It all
depends on how large the lab is
since it could make a difference of
potentially $10,000. Depending on

where in the grant year you are, it
may be difficult to adjust."
"I think anything that takes
money away from postdoc salaries
is terrible," Scheller said. "They
are highly trained professionals
who earn very little money com
pared to what they are worth."
However, Scheller added that
making up the difference puts
another strain on his ability to
fund science in his lab.
To cope with the increased
taxes, other professors may push
their postdocs to seek outside fel
lowships to pay for their research,
said Patricia Jones, chair of the
biology department. This would
also allow postdocs to keep their
jobs.
Some professors argue, howev
er, that the new taxes will not have
such a great impact. Some even
believe that the taxes may have a
positive effect.
"Clearly the new taxes have to
be taken into account; the question
is the magnitude," said Physics
Prof. Bias Cabrera. "It certainly is
a component, but it doesn't sound
to me like a major component."
Phyllis Gardner, associate pro
fessor of molecular pharmacolo
gy, said the taxes may allow
research labs to be more efficient
initially. She added, however,
that quality will be sacrificed if
cuts continue.
"There may be excess in the sys
tem," she said. "The first step will
be to pare down to the best people.
The next step will affect quality."
The new classification of post
docs as researchers will also enable
postdocs to receive benefits, Hoff
man said.
"It will be better for them. They
have not gotten benefits in the past
that they deserve," Hoffman said.
"They have been treated as inex
pensive labor.
"Many are doing more than one
postdoc," Hoffman added. "As a
result, they are spending more and
more time in a position where they
cannot contribute to a good pen
sion plan."
In any case, professors agree
that the new taxes will significant
ly decrease the pool of money avail
able for professors' research.
"Not only are you paying the
taxes out of grants, but you are
also being asked to increase the
postdocs' salary," Gardner said.
"You will be employing less people
for the same amount of money.
"The impact is one that cuts
down on resources for research
and education," he added.
