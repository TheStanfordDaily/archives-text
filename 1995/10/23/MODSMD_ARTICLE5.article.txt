# Tax on postdocs cuts $1 million from research
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
A tightened Internal Revenue
Service definition of what consti
tutes a student will cost the Uni
versity more than $1 million in
research funds beginning this
year.
Because postdoctoral scholars
are no longer classified as students,
they now have to pay federal social
security and disability taxes
amounting to 8.5 percent of their
income.
Professors who employ postdocs
pay a matching amount out of their
research budgets â€” money which is
paid out through the University's
staff benefits pool.
The policy, which Stanford im
plemented Sept. 1, affects the ap
proximately 500 postdocs who re
ceive money from the University's
payroll, said George Dekker, associ
ate dean of graduate policy. Post
docs who have outside fellowships
and those who work at Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, howev
er, are excluded.

A strain on research budgets

The funds to
pay for the match
ing taxes will
come directly
from individual
professors' re
search budgets,
department heads
said.
Costs will ini
tially be charged

to the staff benefits pool but will
then be passed on to the depart
ments and finally to individual pro
fessors.
"The staff benefits rate is
charged to individual depart
ments," said Benefits Manager
Nancy Walsworth. Departments
then pay money into an account
that funds the staff benefit pool.
"These people (postdocs) are not
paid by the department but instead
by the individual professors' re
search money," said David Pollard,
professor of geological and environ
mental sciences and chair of the de
