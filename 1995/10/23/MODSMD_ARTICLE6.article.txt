### James G. Wheaton 
Finding a well-paying job is get
tingtougher for those just finishing
college, but don't bother telling that
to graduates of the Business
School.
With a median starting salary of
$73,500, members of the Business
School class of 1995 rank among
the highest paid MBA graduates in
the nation.
Among Stanford, Harvard,
Wharton and the Kellogg Graduate
School of Management at North
western University, Stanford MBA
graduates in 1995 received the sec
ond-highest first-year salaries, ac
cording to statistics released by the
Career Management Center at the
Graduate School of Business.
With their signing and year-end
bonuses, however, Stanford busi
ness graduates received the highest
overall first-year compensation,
with a median of $100,000. Stan

ford had a similar number of offers
per student as Harvard, at three per
graduate, and more firms recruited
at the Farm than anywhere else last
year.
The immediate fiscal success of
Business School graduates serves
to re-afiirm its position as one of the
premier educational institutions in
the world. "The class of 1995 took a
wide variety of jobs, and were very
much in demand," said Sherrie
Taguchi, director of the Career
Management Center
Within three months of receiv
ing their MBAs, 98 percent of the
graduates had received job offers.
Thirty-seven percent of the class
had base salaries of $80,000 or
more.
Thirty-two percent of the gradu
ates took jobs in management con
sulting, 15 percent in investment
banking and 15 percent in high
technology These three choices
have remained popular for the
past decade.
Thirty-nine companies hired
three or more graduates, led by
McKinsey & Company, which
hired "about 20" according to

Taguchi. Other employers hiring
three or more graduates included
The Walt Disney Company, Sili
con (Iraphics, Apple Computer,
AT&T, Goldman Sachs, Proctor
and Gamble, and ITT-Sheraton.
In addition, the class of 1995
differs from previous classes in its
"increased job diversity, charac
terized by both type of job and

location," Taguchi said.
The class took jobs in 41 indus
tries. More than 20 percent of the
cl.lss took jobs outside the United
States, with 9 percent taking jobs
in Asia and 8 percent in Europe
"There were more entrepreneurs
and students taking jobs with start
ips," said Taguchi, as well as more
students entering fields like ven
ture capitalism and entertainment.
According to Taguchi, 77 percent of
the class of 1995 made changes
from their pre-MBA careers. One
percent of the cliiss took jobs with
non-profit organizations.
Career choice is a lengthy process
for Stanford MBA candidates, which
the center divides into five parts,
beginning with a self-assessment of
skills and interests, and ending with
the actual job applications and accep
tance. In between are re.seareh, a
focusing process and the creation of
an individual action plan.
Last year, the center, which
almost exclusively handles MBA
candidates, scheduled more than
9,000 interviews with 232 compa
nies. The center also has more than
920j0b listings from 500 firms.
However, Taguchi said, the cen
ter does not feel that its job is to get
the students a job, but rather, in the
words of Taguchi, "look at career
management as a life long process
of learning and application."
