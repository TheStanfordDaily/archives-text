# Club braves the criticism
## 
### Stewart Maclennan Contributing writer 
With the acquisition of a new sponsor, the Sixth
Man Club enters its third year of existence, but not
without an increased price for its reserved seating.
Members of the club pay an additional $15 on top
of the new $20 season ticket price in order to sit in a
special section set aside by the Athletic Department.
The argument can be made, however, that it's
unfair to purchase student tickets for poorer seats
than those set aside for the Sixth Man Club.
year's policy which allowed club members to bypass
lines and enter games through a specially reserved
gate was also criticized.
Karl Koberlein, administrative assistant in the
Athletics Department, admitted that setting aside a
gate for club members is a poor idea. "I can under
stand that it would cause friction when some stu
dents are out there waiting five hours before the
game," he said. Koberlein added that last year's pol
icy is now being reviewed.
In addition to reserved seating, the club's new
sponsor, Chili's Grill and Bar, will provide members
with T-shirts and a meeting place for pre-game par
ties with special prices for food and drink. Members
will also be able to watch away games on television.
Last Friday, Koberlein accepted some 525 sign
ups for the club, about 200 more than the number of
participants last year. 1 le pointed to this increase as

a good indicator of the club's growing popularity.
Maples Pavilion, home of Cardinal basketball, seats
a total of 7,500 people.
"There's obviously a demand for the Sixth Man
Club. I think people are attracted to the camaraderie
among the members," he said.
Koberlein also stressed that the group is open to
all students and that the membership fee has been
lowered $5 from last year.
In response to students who feel that the club is
small, exclusive and poorly advertised to the general
public, Koberlein insisted that he wants to accom
modate anybody interested in joining the club.
"Last week 1 thought I'd limit sign-ups to 400,
but I decided to take 525 and deal with the ramifica
tions later," he said.
Koberlein also said that the club is not closed yet.
"I will take more sign-ups on Monday and will con
tinue to accept people until the general season tick
ets sell out."
Although the club participants are sometimes
stereotyped as being exclusively fraternity mem
bers, Koberlein wanted students to know that
roughly 15 to 20 percent of its members are female.
Athletics Director Ted Leland is glad to see some
debate over the Sixth Man Club and hopes that it
will increase student interest in attending the bas
ketball games.
"It's refreshing to see students argue about
where they sit," Leland said.
