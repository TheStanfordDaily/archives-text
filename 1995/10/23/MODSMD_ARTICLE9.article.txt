## World leaders meet to celebrate U.N. anniversary 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - In
the largest gathering of world lead
ers in history, kings, presidents
and premiers marked the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations
yesterday by demanding the orga
nization change so it can fulfill the
dreams of its founders.
But differences that long have
divided the world's only global
organization surfaced as 200 top
officials began three days of
speeches.
Outside U.N. headquarters,
thousands demonstrated for a
worldful of issues from the down
fall of Cuba's Marxist regime to
independence for Tibet. Traffic in
busy Manhattan, one of the world's
most densely packed pieces of real
estate, snarled as thousands of
police sealed off thoroughfares.
The U.N. charter ratified 50
years ago tomorrow espoused ide
als of fostering peace and security
throughout the world and econom
ic progress for all peoples.
The anniversary Ls taking place
as the United Nations faces its
greatest financial crisis, brought on
bv demands for peacekeeping oper
ations in the former Yugoslavia,
Somalia, Angola and elsewhere, as
well as the failure of member states
to pay their dues.
President Clinton, the first lead
er to speak, talked of fighting ter
rorism, organized crime, drug
smuggling and the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
Leaders of smaller countries
offered other priorities. Many
blamed the United Nations' prob
lems on the failure of the United
States and others to pay their bills.
Members owe the United Nations
$3 billion. The biggest debtor, the
United States, is $1.3 billion in
arrears.

"Some dozen parliaments hold
this organization hostage by with
holding their membership fees,"
Norwegian Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland said.
Cuban President Fidel Castro
talked of the gap between rich and
poor and domination of the United
Nations by powerful countries.
He said "abuse of authority" by
the United States and the four
other permanent Security Council
members — France, Britain, Rus
sia and China — has created "a new
colonialism within the very United
Nations." The Security Council is
the only U.N. body that can pass
resolutions binding on all members.
Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said the Security Council
should not serve as a sanctuary
where the five permanent mem
bers become "high priests to the
rest of the globe."
Even permanent members were
not entirely pleased. Russian Pres
ident Boris Yeltsin complained the
Security Council and his own coun
try have been bypassed in recent
U.S.-led initiatives to end the war
in Bosnia.
Clinton, who spoke nine min
utes beyond the five-minute limit
allotted each speaker, said he was
determined to meet the United
Suites' financial obligations to the
United Nations.
But he added: "The U.N. must
be able to show that the money
received supports saving and
enriching people's lives, not
bureaucratic overhead."
In welcoming remarks, Secre
tary-General Boutros Boutros-
Ghali said the United Nations had
a vital role to play in such fields as
rights international law, peace
keeping, development and the envi
ronment.

"But the United Nations cannot
play this role if the present trend
continues," he said. "The problems
of globalization and fragmentation
have caused vast responsibilities to
be given to the U.N. But the U.N.
has not been given the resources
required to accomplish the tasks
imposed."
He asked members to consider
calling a special session of the Gen
eral Assembly to deal with the
financial crisis — an idea some
leaders also promoted.
Many speeches ran slightly long,
but all speakers were permitted to
finish and the afternoon session
ended two hours and 20 minutes
later than planned.

As the gathering progresses, the
world leaders will also hold scores
of one-on-one meetings on issues
nmging from the war in Bosnia to
U.S.-China relations and peace in
the Middle East.
Outside the U.N. complex, city
police and federal agents mounted
one of New York's biggest-ever
security operations, wrapping a
thick defensive blanket around the
dignitaries.
Streets were closed, anti-sniper
teams were deployed on rooftops
and police boats with frogmen
patrolled the nearby East River.
Meanwhile, thousands of
protesters rallied on a plaza behind
police barricades. Among them:

Anti-Castro demonstrators march
ing on Cuba's U.N. mission, hun
dreds of Tamils from Canada sup
porting ethnic brethren in their
separatist war with Sri Lanka's
government and supporters of the
Mohajir underclass in Prime Min
ister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan.
Under a plastic tarpaulin, six
Tibetans were in the eighth day of
a "hunger strike until death" to
demand U.N. help in the Tibetan
struggle for independence from
China.
Security concerns may have
prompted one last-minute cancella
tion: Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who escaped assassina
tion four months ago in Ethiopia,

apparently by Islamic militants.
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion chief Yasser Arafat, in his
speech yesterday, called for eco
nomic aid to the Palestinians.
"Our people are yearning for
peace," Arafat said. "The prophecy
of good tidings has taken its first
step. Help us bring it to fruition."
He called Israeli-Palestinian
peace "irreversible" and said peace
in the Middle East must include
Syria, Iraq and Libya.
Castro, meanwhile, has been
flooded with requests from U.S.
businesses anxious to discuss
future deals despite the U.S. eco
nomic embargo against his Com
munist island nation.
