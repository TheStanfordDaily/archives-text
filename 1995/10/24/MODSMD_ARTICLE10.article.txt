HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) — In an unexpected
move towiird agreement, Boris Yeltsin pledged
to President Clinton yesterday that Russian
troops would help enforce peace in Bosnia. But
the two leaders remained deadlocked on the key
question of whether Russian forces would serve
under NATO command.
"We have the responsibility to work together
to make the peace work and we will do that,"
Clinton said after four hours of talks at Franklin
Roosevelt's ancestral home overlooking the
Hudson River.
Yeltsin, in an emotional statement, said the
talks defied negative forecasts and were "the
friendliest meeting, the best meeting, the most
understandable meeting."
Despite the declarations of friendship and
progress, the two leaders refused to budge
from opposite views on how to structure a
Bosnian peacekeeping force in the event of a
war-ending agreement, senior administration
officials said.

Yeltsin insisted that Russians would not serve
under NATO, the Western military alliance ini
tially formed against Moscow. But for Clinton,
having NATO run the operation is essential.
The two leaders directed Defense Secretary
William Perry and Russian Defense Minister
Pavel Grachev to meet this week to find a way to
bridge the dispute. "It's not a political impasse,
it's a military question," said a senior U.S. offi
cial who sat in on the talks.
"Our position is that we're going to have an
operation that works," Clinton said. "We want
Russia to be involved in it."
Yeltsin expressed confidence a solution would
be found. "You are underestimating the presence
of two such great powers," he told reporters.
Clinton and Yeltsin summed up their meeting
at an impromptu news conference on the porch
of Roosevelt's mansion, a site chosen to evoke
the spirit of World War II cooperation that unit
ed Washington and Moscow. The grounds of the
estate — now a national historic site — were

ablaze with autumn color.
Looking for accord, they agreed to work for a
ban next year on all nuclear tests and to improve
security at Russian nuclear sites to guard
against theft of weapons materials.
They also decided to move ahead with a com
promise to amend a 1990 treaty calling for reduc
tions in NATO and former Warsaw Pact tanks,
artillery, aircraft, helicopters and armored vehi
cles by mid-November. Moscow wants the West
to ease military limits on Russia's northern and
southern borders so it can deal more easily with
secessionist movements.
It was the ninth Clinton-Yeltsin meeting and
the two leaders appeared at ease with each other.
Clinton doubled over in laughter and wiped
tears from his eyes when Yeltsin upbraided
reporters for milking bleak predictions about the
meeting's outcome — echoing earlier comments
made anonymously by administration officials.
"You're a disaster," the Russian leader told the
press, through a translator.
