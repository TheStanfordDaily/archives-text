## Editorials ID sticker shock 
### 
AFTER YEARS OF com
plaints and demands for a
better system, new ID
cards finally arrived on the Farm
this quarter and met with general
approval. The high-tech aspects of
the new cards, however, could
lead to some problems.
Designed to last longer than
most students stay on campus,
the new cards seem to answer
every complaint about the old sys
tem — they're sturdy, have the
bearer's photo, double as meal
cards and can even be linked to an
off-campus bank account.
There's a major drawback, how
ever: You can't tell if a student
bearing an ID card is currently
registered — or what year he is —
by glancing at his card as you
could with the old IDs. To get that
information, you need to run the
card through a scanner connected
to the identification system.
The University plans to install
these scanners in every campus
facility restricted to registered
students or faculty and staff, like
the libraries and the gym.
Although expensive, this seems to

make sense; after all, the new
cards are saving Stanford a lot of
money in card printing costs over
time.
The problem is that there are a
lot of situations where students
need to be able to show that they
are registered where scanners
won't be available.
For example, campus parties
often require Stanford ID to get
in and groups such as the Speak
ers Bureau give out tickets to stu
dents with "valid" ID.
But starting next quarter, even
graduated students with the new
cards can benefit from many of
the perks of being a student.
The solution is simple. All the
University has to do is look at
what has succeeded at other
schools — stickers. For every
quarter students are registered,
they get a new sticker verifying
their registration to paste on
their IDs. They're cheap, effective
and best of all, low-tech.
Stanford may be in Silicon Val
ley, but that doesn't mean it has
to be on the cutting edge of ID
cards.
