# Cuts that can help

Government downsizing
has worked out for the ben
efit of the student. New
recipients of Stafford loans will no
longer have to endure the delays
that first-time borrowers experi
enced this past September.
When students went to Tresid
der Student Union to sign over
their loans to the University, first
time borrowers encountered prob
lems they may not have been pre
pared for. All were told that their
Stafford loan was not ready for
pick-up; federal regulations man
dated that they had to wait until
Nov. 1 to receive their aid checks.
This inconvenience forced some
students to take out deferments to
postpone some of their education
costs.
Now, the government, as a

result of budget cutbacks, had
loosened the enforcement rules in
loan distribution. This lessens the
financial burden on students by
giving students quicker access to
aid and cutting down on bureau
cracy.
The current reforms are a
result of recommendations from
college financial aid offices. The
Department of Education is acting
in a logical manner by working
with universities to reform poli
cies and streamlining the financial
aid system.
Stanford should continue its
participation in shaping such
cooperative budget cuts with the
government. Given the fiscally
conservative mood in Washington
of late, it would be a wise policy to
follow.
