English lecturer counters points in 'Diversity'

IN THEIR OCT. 20 letter to The
Stanford Daily, authors Peter Thiel
and David Sacks once again express
concern that the University's multicul
tural policies have "undermined the
diversity, squelched dissent and nar
rowed intellectual life." Since the
authors have complaints about the Com
munity Service Writing Program at
Stanford, and since they have quoted
materials from my 1991 Community
Service Writing freshman English class
in both The Daily and their book, "The
Diversity Myth," I would like to set a
few facts straight about the CSW pro
gram.
In"The Diversity Myth," the authors
claim that "half of freshman English
classes require participation in the
'Community Service Writing Project.' "
In truth, only 11 percent of Writing and
Critical Thinking courses offer the CSW
option. Only 15 or 16 classes out of 140
are involved in community service writ
ing. Students choose to sign up for CSW

classes; last year, over 383 students
requested to participate in these classes,
but only 220 of these requests could be
accommodated.
Sacks and Thiel recently stated in a
letter to The Wall Street Journal that in
community service writing classes, stu
dents are required to fill out grant
requests for "their professors' favorite
community service agencies." In fact,
students are not required to write or to
work for their professor's favorite agen
cies. Instead, students are told at the
orientation session for each CSW class
that the list of agencies assigned to their
class is just a starting point. Students
are free to develop their own place
ments, to work with an agency of their
choosing and — under the supervision of
the teacher and the agency contact per
son — to come up with their own writ
ing assignments. To this end, the Haas
Center for Public Service provides not
only additional agency computer fdes at
the orientation sessions, but also person

alized help from trained staff members.
For students who wish to work with a
pre-arranged agency, the Haas Center
has developed a broad base of agency
contacts, working with each CSW teach
er to offer a broad variety of agencies to
match the theme of the class.
For example, in my 1991 CSW class,
students were offered assignments for a
variety of agencies concerned with a
variety of social issues, including envi
ronmental education, AIDS and the
problems of caring for the homeless and
hungry.
Both Sacks and Thiel claim that these
groups are all "left-liberal" causes ("The
Diversity Myth," p. 86). This statement
is certainly debatable, but the point is
that students were then, as they are
now, encouraged to develop their own
projects.
Additionally, only a very small num
ber of students in the program have ever
written grant proposals. While those few
students who have chosen the challeng

ing task of writing an entire grant pro
posal are to be commended, the vast
majority of students choose to write
smaller assignments such as newsletter
articles, fact sheets, shorter research
assignments or even educational materi
als for high school students. CSW
assignments make up only a part of the
students' writing experience. Students
must also complete a number of class
writing assignments, including research
papers and essays.
Sacks and Thiel bemoan the "narrow
intellectual life" at Stanford. It is hard
to understand how their "years of care
ful research" have lead them to believe
that a program that challenges students
to write for"the real world" and allows
students' work to be edited not only by
their peers and teachers, but by profes
sional writers in the workplace, can do
anything but broaden our students' edu
cational and intellectual experiences.
