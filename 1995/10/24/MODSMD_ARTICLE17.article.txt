## What happened to 15 units ? 
### 
TELL SOMEONE AT Stanford
that you're only taking 13 units
and they'll look at you as if you
just told them your house burned down.
I'm serious. Go ahead and try it with
someone. First they'll pause in an awk
ward moment of silence and then they'll
try to console you with phrases like, "I'm
sorry," or "Thirteen units? That's not
too bad." My personal favorite has been
"You'll make up those units some other
quarter."
We've gotten to the point where the
average Stanford undergraduate takes
18 units while many take upwards of 21
units. Have we forgotten that it only
takes 15 units a quarter to graduate? If
it's normal for someone to take 18 units,
why shouldn't it be alright to take 12?
And for every five people you know
who are taking over 20 units, how many
do you know who are taking under 10?
Probably not many, if any at all.
It's gotten to a point where people
think they're underachieving if they take
15 units, which is precisely the number
of units everyone should be taking.
So what happened? Why isn't anyone
taking 15 units anymore? One cause of
this upward surge in our perception of
what's acceptable is the Stanford stu
dent's history of overachieving. You've
been over-achieving ever since you were
a baby who was potty-trained at the age
of six months. You were learning calcu
lus in the fifth grade. You corrected your

eighth grade english teacher when she
misquoted passages from "Hamlet."
Why should you not over-achieve now?
Why not take that extra four-unit class
and take 19 units?
I'm glad you asked.
I'm sure you're aware of the growing
concern among faculty and students over
growing section sizes. The maximum
section size used to be 16, then 18, and
now it's grown to 48, or whatever. Now
consider this: With about 6,000 Stanford
undergrads, if each one is taking three
units more than what is normal, that
amounts to 18,000 extra units. Now
divide that number by the number of
units a "normal" student should take
and you get 1,200 extra 15-unit students.
That's 1,200 superfluous Stanford stu
dents our classes, professors and TAs are
supporting just because you feel like tak
ing 18 units.
The mindset behind many unit hogs
is that, if you're going to pay zillions of
dollars for tuition, you might as well
reap as much education from it as you
possibly can — as if $8,000 for 15 units
is ridiculous and throwing in an extra
three units makes the whole deal a real
bargain.
Let's face it. You'd have to take 100
units a quarter for your tuition bill to get
maximum utility, so you might as well
not even try. Unit hogs who try to cram
a year's worth of learning into every
quarter only succeed in adding to their

already tightly-wound neuroticism. So
instead of taking 10 classes and complet
ing each one haphazardly, you'll be doing
yourself and your professors a favor by
taking just four classes and devoting a
reasonable amount of time to each one.
The problem is analogous to the
Wilbur or Stern all-you-can-eat meals
system fiasco. Everyone is paying the
same regardless of how much anyone
takes. As a result, everyone takes too
many classes and the faculty — in the
effort to support our artificial demand —
peddles out crappy food to our over
stuffed minds.
The last day for dropping courses is
Sunday. If you think you're winning
some kind of horse race by taking a zil
lion units, stop and think about all the
other things you could be doing instead
of reading for that extra four-unit class.
Play tennis. Hang out with friends.
Go dancing. Read a comic book. Take a
walk to the Dish.
You'll make up those units some other
quarter.

Mr. Small says he is currently taking 17
units. He also works as a writing tutor,
takes a volleyball class and writes this
column each week. Apparently, he is still
trying to weed out the overachiever bug
in him.
