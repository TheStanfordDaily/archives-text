## Competitive grades an educational conflict of interest 
### John Krumboltz 
WE ARE WORRIED about kids
dropping out of school, about
school vandalism and violence,
about drug use and about kids who hate
learning. However, these are all pre
dictable responses to an educational sys
tem that publicly humiliates students
through the use of competitive grading.
By assigning grades that compare stu
dents with one another, we label large
numbers of students as losers. Even
many who get B grades feel they are
losers because they did not receive A's.
Moreover, competitive grading under
mines the primary responsibility of our
educational system — to help all stu
dents learn to the best of their ability. No
matter how effective our instruction may
be, there will always be individual differ-

ences in ability and
knowledge. Competitive
grading glorifies those
few at the top but dis
parages everyone else.
Much of the negative
behavior we witness
among our young peo
ple in schools is a form
of retaliation against a
system that inevitably

designates them as losers.
A seldom examined assumption in our
educational system is that teachers must
assign grades to students. The mandate
usually goes further in requiring a distri
bution of grades. Too many A's and the
teacher is in trouble for being "too easy,"
so varying percentages of each class
must receive A, B, C, D or even F grades.
What is the justification for this compet
itive grading system? To motivate stu
dents? It may motivate some, but it is
profoundly discouraging to most. Half
the students will always be below aver
age by definition.
The justification most often given is
that the next higher educational institu
tion demands grades in order to make its
admission decisions — colleges demand
high school grades, graduate schools
demand college grades. Since prior
behavior is a pretty good predictor of

tion and psychology.

future behavior, past grades tend to pre
dict future grades.
Assigning grades has become so insti
tutionalized that we just assume without
question that we must give grades to
help other educational institutions
decide whom to admit. The policy is also
used to strike fear in the hearts of stu
dents. Do what I tell you or you won't get
a good grade, you won't get into college
and you will never get a good job!
What is overlooked here is that we
have a serious conflict of interest. The
primary responsibility of teachers is to
help every student in their classes learn
as much as possible under conditions
that promote a love of learning. Requir
ing teachers to assume a secondary
responsibility of assigning grades to help
another institution places them in a con
flict of interest. Teachers are required to
serve two masters when they must both
maximize student learning and assign
competitive grades.
The two goals are in conflict. If the
teacher's only goal were to help all stu
dents learn, the teacher would make
sure that all students were engaged in
important learning activities in which
they could eventually be successful. Stu
dents would voluntarily help each other.
Students would feel the teacher was
working as their ally. But when competi-

tive grades are required, students have a
disincentive to cooperate with each other
and help one another learn. Teacher and
student become pitted against each other
as judge and defendant.
Certain students enter a class with
strong prerequisite skills and find it easy
to get A grades without even trying.
They could achieve much more if they
were challenged to do so. Others without
these prerequisites struggle in vain to

avoid the ridicule of poor grades and
become discouraged, apathetic and hos
tile.
Competitive grading sets the stan
dards too low for the top students and
too high for the less prepared students.
Abolishing competitive grading and tai
loring instruction to individual needs
would make it possible for every child to
succeed.
If the teacher's only goal were to
select the best students for the next
institution, the teacher would concen
trate on building and administering tests
of the very skills taught by the next insti
tution. Students who already had the
prerequisite skills and knowledge would
score high on the tests, get high grades
and succeed similarly in the next institu
tion which requires the same type of per
formance.
Students without those prerequisite
skills would become discouraged at the
impossibility of succeeding and either
drop out or become discipline problems.
Under this scenario, the next institu
tions' admissions office would be pleased
with the predictive accuracy of the teach
ers who take their competitive grading
assignment so seriously, but most of the
students would be shortchanged by the
teachers' ignoring their individual needs
and demeaning them in front of their
parents and peers.
Teachers want every student to suc
ceed, but if every student does succeed,
teachers are still required to assign lower
grades to some students than to others.
Teachers can compare and sort students
even if the students learn little or noth
ing. If teachers sort on an "across the
board" basis of student knowledge, they
need not help every student improve. If
we want every child to learn, we need to
set up conditions that make learning
attractive to all, not one that punishes
and belittles students who are already at
a disadvantage.
Without competitive grading, how
then would college admission offices
decide whom to admit? If they can't
admit every applicant, they can use a
variety of alternative admission criteria
— entrance exams, interviews, essays or
even a lottery. Colleges should be chal
lenged to be more creative in solving
their own problems and not ask other
educators to compromise a primary
responsibility.
Solving the college admissions prob

lem is not the task of high school teach
ers. Solving graduate school admission
problems is not the task of college teach
ers. Each institution needs to concen
trate on its primary responsibility —
facilitating the learning of every student

in its charge. Competi
tive grading interferes
with maximizing learn
ing and should be elimi
nated.
Some may argue that
teachers can compromise
and perform both func
tions. Indeed they can —
but at an unacceptable
cost. It has been fre
quently reported that
children in the primary
grades approach school
with eagerness to learn
and confidence in their
own abilities. Primary
schools usually do not
engage in competitive
grading because junior
and senior high schools
do not need grades to
make admission deci
sions. When competitive
grading practices are
introduced, the enthusi
asm for learning begins
to diminish and the stu
dents' feelings of confi
dence and self-esteem
decline.
Does that mean that
teachers have no respon
sibility for evaluating the
learning of their stu
dents? Of course not.
Instructors do have the
responsibility of evaluat
ing performance, but
only for the purpose of
helping students

improve, not to compare students with
one another or to supply rankings for
another institution.
Evaluation of student progress guides
teacher planning. Teachers help stu
dents set individual goals toward which
progress is attainable. Teachers give
feedback on the extent to which each stu
dent is achieving educational goals.
Teachers provide encouragement for
continued effort and for progress. Every
one who is trying to learn deserves a pat
on the back, but everyone need not be

trying to learn the same thing at the
same time. The critical point of educa
tional evaluation is whether all students
are continuing to learn, not whether
they know more or less than other stu
dents.

These ideas are not new. The history
of education is replete with efforts to
individualize educational experiences
and to provide success experiences for
everyone. What seems to be largely
unrecognized, however, is the destruc
tive role played by competitive grading
practices and the unethical conflicts of
interest those practices create for teach
ers. A radical change in educational poli
cy is needed. Achieving this change will
require the thoughtful efforts of educa
tors and citizens alike.
