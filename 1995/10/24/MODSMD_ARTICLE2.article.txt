1995 Apker Award for outstanding
achievement in undergraduate research

"I was so excited to receive the
award," said Mancoff. "It's a great
honor and I'm very pleased."
Mancoff wrote his winning thesis, en

Mancoff was flown to Washington,

regarding his research before a panel of
six or seven judges.
Stanford's record in bringing the
prize home three of the past 10 times
