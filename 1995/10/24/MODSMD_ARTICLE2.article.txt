Alumnus Fred Mancoff became the
third Stanford student in 10 years to re
ceive the American Physical Society'?
1995 Apker Award for outstanding
achievement in undergraduate research
in physics.
Mancoff, who graduated with a bach
elor's in physics last spring, received the
award for research conducted during hi?

junior and senior year.
"I was so excited to receive the
award," said Mancoff. "It's a great
honor and I'm very pleased."
Mancoff wrote his winning thesis, en
titled "Two-Dimensional Electron
Transport, and Magnetoresistance Ef
fects in a Random Magnetic Field,"
under the direction of research adviser
Charles Marcus, a professor of physics.
Mancoff was flown to Washington,
D C., along with the other finalists sev

eral weeks ago where he gave a speech
regarding his research before a panel of
six or seven judges.
Stanford's record in bringing the
prize home three of the past 10 times
speaks highly of Stanford's physics de
partment, Marcus said.
"For such a small department, that's
an amazing proportion," said Marcus.
"Part of the reason we've done so well is


Mancoff
our long tradition of involving
undergraduates in cutting-edge
research. And it doesn't hurt that
Stanford is a research institu
tion."
He added that the department
is "small and friendly" and very

interested in its undergraduates.
After comparing his experi
ences as an undergraduate at
Stanford and a graduate student
at Harvard, Marcus said that
when it comes to research oppor
tunities, "there's no place in the
country better than Stanford."
The Apker Award was estab
lished as a memorial for Dr.
Le√üoy Apker, who had a distin
guished career as a solid state

physicist at General Electric Co.
The other Stanford students to
have won the prestigious award
are Terence Hwa, in 1986, and
Stephen Quake, who shared the
1991 award with a Harvard stu
dent.
Mancoff, who won $3000 with
the Apker Award, was also
awarded the Dean's Award for
Academic Achievement by the
University.
