## Freshman cruises from wildcard to All-American title 
### Courtney Mann Editorial staff 
A few weeks ago, Stanford
men's tennis coach Dick Gould
said that he expected freshman
Ryan Wolters to "have an
impact on Stanford tennis and
collegiate tennis overall."
Score this one as a major
impact.
Wolters defeated Roger Pet
terson of Nevada, Las Vegas 6-
4, 6-2 in the final of the Indoor
Tennis Association All-Ameri
can Championships in Austin,
Texas, surviving the 64-draw,
single-elimination tournament.
According to past records of
this Grand Slam event, Wolters
is not only the first freshman to
win the tourney, hut also the
first to capture the champi
onship via an at-large bid.
"By far this is the biggest
win of my career," Wolters
said. "Playing against these
guys at other schools and win
ning is a big deal to me."
Assistant coach John
Whitlinger was quick to
emphasize the significance
of Wolters' triumph. "This is
one of (he Grand Slam cham
pionships of college tennis,
he said. "For a person who
had to qualify just to get in
the draw, |this 1 is tremen
dous. This is a great accom
plishment for [Wolters]."
The first set in the final

remained a 4-4 deadlock until
Wolters held serve and then
broke Petterson in the next
game to claim the first set.
After jumping to a 2-0 advan
tage in the second set, Petter
son looked as if he would force
a third set, but the freshman
sensation then broke off six
unanswered games to cruise to
his first collegiate title in as
many attempts.
It was an uphill climb for
Wolters. Ranked 75th in the
Rolex preseason poll, Wolters
defeated opponents ranked No.
60, 50, 28, 22, 19, 18 and 13
during the tournament. The
impressive run almost met its
end in the quarterfinals, as
Wolters fought off match point
against Duke's Rob Chess.
Wolters, the 19th-ranked
junior in the world last year,
survived that scare, just as he
did in all nine matches he won
in the span of six days. The
freshman first navigated his
way through (he qualifying
draw ot 32 While Cardinal
sophomore Paul Goldstein and
senior Jim Thomas fell in the
third round, Wolters continued
to roll.
After winning the qualifying
draw, Wolters turned his sights
on the main draw. "1 was just
hoping to qualify for the main
draw at first," he said "And
then I thought it would be great
to win a round or two against
some of these guys. As I kept win
ning, my confidence just grew."
Whitlinger sensed the momen
tum building as well. "I told Ryan
after he qualified, 'You just beat
four good players. Let's not just
be happy now.'
"He was just playing one
match at a time, as the cliche
goes. Physically, I wasn't sure he
could handle all the tennis. But
he was very strong. He just sort
of kept winning matches."
With nine victories under his

belt already, Wolters undoubted
ly has already turned heads in
the collegiate tennis world. With
the loss of Scott Humphries to
the professional ranks, Wolters
will be a key part of the Cardinal
lineup as Stanford defends last
season's national championship.
"He's not an unknown com
modity anymore," Whitlinger
said. "People will be shooting for
him now."
Yet, Wolters is prepared for
the challenge, especially with a
newfound confidence. "Before, I
was just trying to get a feel for
these guys," he said. "[Now| I
have the feeling that I have a
chance to win when I go out
there, rather than just doing well
against them."
