# All-Pac-10 tandem falls in final
## Cardinal singles stars fall in semifinals and quarterfinals 
### Robin Davidson 
Sophomore Ania Bleszynski and junior Katie
Schlukebir made the finals in doubles action and
the semifinals in singles at the Indoor Tennis
Association All-American Championships last
weekend in Los Angeles. The tournament is a
four-day annual event in which returning Ail-
Americans are invited to compete against each
other in what is possibly the greatest accumula
tion of tennis talent at the college level.
Bleszynski, Schlukebir and fellow All-Ameri
can senior Kim Shasby were invited to participate
in the tournament. Sandra De Silva also made the
main draw by surviving three matches in the
qualifying tournament before losing to freshman
Tzipora Obziler of Old Dominion 7-6, 7-5 in the
quarterfinals. Obziler also defeated fourth-seeded
Schlukebir 6-3, 6-4 in the semifinal match.
On the other side of the draw, Shasby fell to
Wake Forest's Terry Ann Zawacki, while seventh
seeded Bleszynski battled through three sets (2-6,
6-0, 6-4) before finally losing to the third-seeded
Jill Craybas of Florida, who eventually won the
tournament.
In doubles action, Stanford's only entry and the
No. 1 seed of Bleszynski and Schlukebir breezed
through most of the tournament before losing in
the finals to California's freshman team of Aman
da Augustus and Renaca Kolbovic 6-2, 7-6.
"They are a good, solid team," Bleszynski said.
"I have to give them credit, but when I look back
at the match, I feel it's more what I didn't do than
what they did."
De Silva noted that the tournament is a great
place to see some of the top competition in the
country before the season. "It was definitely a
good tournament for Stanford," she said. "All the
top players were there and we got to see some of
the new freshmen."
Bleszynski agreed that Stanford's success in
the tournament gives the Cardinal added confi
dence for the season. "Considering the fact that
the best players in the country were there, we did
really well with three players in the quarterfinals
and two in the semifinals," she said. "It gives us
more hope for winning the NCAAs."
