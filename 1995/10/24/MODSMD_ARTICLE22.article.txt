# Sailors play role of ungracious host
## Stanford sailing breezes past Cal for Stanford Invite triumph 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
The Stanford sailing team
spent Saturday and Sunday host
ing every school in its district at

the Stanford Invite. Finishing far
above its toughest competitor,
California, Stanford not only cap
tured first place, but also placed
two other teams in the top-five.
Sophomores John Meade and

Mara Holian won division A Out

to win the Invite. Although
Hossiei and hi.s teammate won
seven of the 13 races, a few sev
enth place performances knocked
th«m out of first, allowing Meade
Hi>dJni"lian to win the division.
iVleade and Holian over
Mossier was huge," said head
coach Steve Bourdow. "It was a
battle Mossier kept prematurely
starting, something which is
uncharacteristic of him. Meade
and Holian used this to their
advantage. As a result of their
great performance, they are
beginning to earn a great deal of
iv.iprct, whether they are aware

In division B, sophomore Betsy
Chai imchaei and senior Adam
Lowry matched Meade's and
Holian's production. With six
first place outings and four sec
aid place finishes, Charmichael
and liOwry built an amazing 42-
point difference between Stanford
and the next closest school.
" T 'xpected Betsy and Adam to
win, but they out-did them
selves " Bourdow said "Their
closest competition came from
one of our own boats, sailed by
I freshmen] Steve Kleha and Adri
ennt Stolz, who placed second.

The Cardinal leads a pack of sailors last season, just as it did throughout the Stanford Invitational last
weekend.
Adam sailed with a lot of
patience and nailed all his starts.
You have to know how to make
things go your way regardless of
the many distractions surround
ing you at the starting line.
Adam proved he knew how."
Other impressive perfor
mances in division A came from
sophomores Phil Barow and
Heather Rogers, who finished
fourth, and freshmen Tyler
Doyle and Jennifer Cromwell,
who placed a solid fifth as a
newly formed freshman tandem.
Freshman Taylor Robinson also
proved her depth and ability to
sail in future division B competi
tion.
Absent from the Sailing Cen
ter in Redwood City last weekend
was junior Alice Mannard. Man

na rd headed up north to compete
in the Women's Singlehanded
Nationals, hosted by the Univer
sity of Portland. After two days
of tough competition, Mannard
placed sixth out of 16. According
to Bourdow, conditions did not
bring out the best in Mannard's
sailing.
"Alice doesn't sail very well
under light conditions," he said.
"She knew she was in for a tough
regatta due to very light and
shifty winds, not to mention the
strong current. Because of these
Ifactors], she had trouble in one
crucial race and as a result
dropped out of the top five,
recovering as well as she could in
her last four races."
Nevertheless, the success of
the Stanford Invite along with
Mannard's performance in Port
land will enable the sailing team
to proceed with confidence as the
Cardinal prepares for still more
intersectional competition.
