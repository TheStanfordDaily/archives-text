# Men's soccer to clash with rejuvenated Dons
## 
### Alan Eaton Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team (4-9-1 overall, 1-4-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) is
back in action today, visiting the
University of San Francisco (6-G
-1, 2-0 West Coast Conference)
after a rough weekend during
which the Cardinal broke a nine
game winless streak with a 1-0
victory over Air Force (7-6-1, 2-4-
0 MPSF).
USF struggled at the begin
ning of the season, losing to both
Creighton and Massachusetts at
the Reebok / Cardinal Classic.
However, the Dons have recov
ered, boasting an unblemished
league record.
Cardinal senior midfielder and
co-captain Carmen D'Onofrio is
wary of the Dons' turnaround.
"Their struggles early in the sea
son can be partly attributed to
their tough schedule," he said.
"Now they are undefeated in their
league matches and hope to con
tinue winning against us."
USF plays soccer with an
attacking mentality. The team
lines up with three forwards who
utilize their speed and agility to
pressure the opposing goalkeeper
throughout the game. Chris
McDonald leads the Dons with six
goals, while Mike Hunter has

added four. Four other USK play
ers have scored three goals.
The Dons have additional
incentive to win today. USK head
coach Stephen Negoesco has
recorded 499 wins. A win tonight
would lift Negoesco to the seldom
matched 500-win mark.
"This is going to he a great
game to watch because of the
Dons' up-and-down-the field style
of play and because the stadium
will be packed in hopes of seeing
Negoesco become the winningest
coach m college history,' D'Onofi io
said.
Stanford will play (he valiant
role of underdog against USF. The
Dons have surrendered almost as
many goals as they have regis
tered. If Stanford can fire up its
temperamental offense, the Cardi
nal could shock the Dons. Look for
Cardinal seniors Chet Zimmer,
D'Onofrio, Steve Kirschbaum and
Ryan Estevez to provide the lead
ership and drive in the upset
attempt.
With its triumph over the Fal
cons, Stanford now remembers
how good it feels to win. The Car
dinal may not have postseason
tickets on the line with tonight's
confrontation against USF, but
Stanford would like to prove its
quality and glean some pride from
the season by playing the role of
spoiler.
