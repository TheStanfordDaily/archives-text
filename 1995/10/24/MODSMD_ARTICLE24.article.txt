# Field hockey downs Santa Clara, Davis
## Fateful match versus Cal up next 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Last weekend, Stanford
field hockey (8-4 overall, 4-1
Northern Pacific Conference)
got a confidence boost and
some extra practice for its
home game today against Cali
fornia 4-7-1, 4-1) with two
wins against Santa Clara and
UC-Davis at the Cal Invita
tional. Stanford had no prob
lem beating both club teams,
crushing the Broncos on Sat
urday 8-0 and shutting out the

Aggies 3-0 on Sunday.
But the focus of last week
end, and indeed of the entire
Cardinal season, has been to
beat Cal. Today's 3 p.m. game
at the Field Hockey Field will
determine which team
advances to postseason play
and which team gets to send
the good luck card. Per presea
son agreements, conference
records will decide the champi
on rather than the champi
onship game itself.
After a disappointing season
last year, Stanford began this year
hoping to take advantage of the
talent of its new recruits and of the
fact that the Cardinal lost only one
senior After an early 1-0 defeat at
the hands of the Bears, the Cardi
nal responded with a 2-0 victory
against Cal on Oct. 7.
Now, after a 7-0 blowout
against Pacific and two easy wins
against Santa Clara and Davis, the
Cardinal must prove that it has
not been spoiled by lack of compe
tition. Only a team comprised of
Stanford alumni has managed to
score against the Cardinal since
the first time Stanford battled Cal,
and the alumni squad's production
is hardly representative of how Cal
can perform.
Stanford must step up its play
and ensure that it remains at the
top of its game. Coach Sheryl
Johnson has not let her players
lose sight of today's game
throughout the lull in the season.
Practices have all geared towards
improving Stanford's play.
"We're really focusing on
[today's] game as a must-win
because we want to go to the play
offs," said senior tri-captain Elise
Morgan.
Both teams are strong this
year, but many factors other than
sheer skill will influence the out
come. Stanford again has the

home-field advantage, which
proved valuable in the Cardinal's
last triumph over the Bears.
In addition, Stanford has the
motivation to win the game, espe
cially after watching Cal compete
in postseason play for the last
three years.
"I think for the seniors, beat
ing Cal carries so much weight
because we've played them for
four years and it's been Cal (going
to the NCAA playoffs] for the last
three years," Morgan said. "It's
defi n itely frustrating."
All aspects of the Cardinal
game must be on target for a vic
tory . The defense must continue
to stop California's transition
game in the midfield.
"They have a couple of players
who like to dribble a lot and our
defense will need to shut them
down," Morgan said. Meanwhile,
the offense must capitalize on
scoring opportunities and take all
available shots inside the circle.
In addition, Cardinal passing will
have to be sharp and smooth.
Smooth passing may prove dif
ficult because the Field Hockey
Field now has a few more holes
which appeared mysteriously after
the last two home football games.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal does
not intend to let anything stop it
en route to the NCAA playoffs.
"I think in the past couple of
games, our passing has been
great," Morgan said. "We moved
the ball up the field really quickly.
That's going to be the key. Every
body has to be on her game."
