# Field hockey downs Santa Clara, Davis
## Fateful match versus Cal up next 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Last weekend, Stanford
field hockey (8-4 overall, 4-1
Northern Pacific Conference)
got a confidence boost and
some extra practice for its
home game today against Cali
fornia 4-7-1, 4-1) with two
wins against Santa Clara and
UC-Davis at the Cal Invita
tional. Stanford had no prob
lem beating both club teams,
crushing the Broncos on Sat
urday 8-0 and shutting out the

Aggies 3-0 on Sunday.
But the focus of last week
end, and indeed of the entire
Cardinal season, has been to
beat Cal. Today's 3 p.m. game
at the Field Hockey Field will
determine which team
advances to postseason play
and which team gets to send
the good luck card. Per presea
son agreements, conference
records will decide the champi
on rather than the champi
onship game itself.
