# The
						inevitable perils in the affairs of love
## 
### 
To think that just one year
ago, during the dog days of
autumn, America was with
out a World Series. For me, I was
without a love. Growing up in
Southern California, being a base
ball fan was as essential a nutrient
in my development as broccoli and
brussel sprouts, except that it was
infinitely more joyous to swallow.
There was no pretending for me
either as a fan. I remember trad
ing, collecting and lusting baseball
cards with the crazed obsession
and fervency of some love-struck
schoolboy. I remember memoriz
ing and spouting statistics like a
freakish rotisserie geek.
But most of all, I remember

the moments. Moments like Kirk
Gibson's dramatic fist-pumping
World Series homerun. Moments
like Bo Jackson's awe-inspiring,
mammoth MVP blast in the All-
Star game. And while, to be hon
est, my loyalties to specific teams
fluctuated with time, there was
one thing that never wavered. No
matter what team I was a fan of, I
would always be a fan of baseball.
Or at least that's what I
thought until last summer.
Amidst the asinine labor dispute
between the hardheaded, idiotic
baseball team owners and the
almost equally intolerable play

ers, fans nationwide were alienat
ed, estranged, peeved and plain
pissed-off by what was supposedly
America's national past time.
While the strife between greedy
owners and players ripped at the
very fiber of baseball, the threads
that held together my love of
baseball were being shredded as
well.
I still remember those bitter
nights and mornings during the
end of August when I would flip
on Sports Center or turn open the
sports page only to find that the
world of sports was now taking
place in closed-door negotiations
and the only highlights were viru
lent epithets flung from owners to
players and vice-versa. Certainly,
the arrival of college and pro foot
ball in September at least partial
ly filled that abysmal void created
by the evil machinations of Major
League Baseball.
Still, when October rolled
around, you knew that something
was missing. You felt that you
were cheated out of something.
And that is when I decided that
never again would I engage
myself in an abusive relationship
such as my love affair with base
ball. It may be better to have
loved baseball and lost baseball
than never to have loved baseball
at all. But at the same time, once
bitten, twice shy. And with base
ball, I was very shy.
In fact, I was revolted by the
time spring training rolled
around for the '95 season. With
the labor situation still unre
solved, there was talk of replace
ment players. There was talk, but
on my end, there was only dis
gusted laughter. At that moment,
