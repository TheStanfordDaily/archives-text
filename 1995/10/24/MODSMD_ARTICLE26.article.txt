# Accident mars men's crew's outing
## Cardinal remains optimistic despite crash at prestigious race 
### Laura Drum Contributing writer 
Stanford men's crew returned from Boston
Sunday night with mixed feelings. The Cardi
nal had just raced in the Head of Charles, one
of the largest crew regattas in the United
States and definitely one of the most well
known. Stanford faced competition from
schools like Harvard and Princeton, well
known for their rowing abilities, as well as a
host of national teams.
The Cardinal performed well, ultimately
finishing 12th collegiately and 45th overall
with a time of 15 minutes, 30 seconds. First
place went to the U.S. National Team, with

return to baseball spineless or
weak. I plead guilty. Perhaps,
but as is the case with any rela
tionship involving love and hate,
you can only come back for
more.
And there's nothing like the
postseason and October if you
love baseball and want more.
Last year's World Series absence
has only whet my appetite even
more for postseason baseball. If
there was ever even a speck of
doubt about my rekindled love
for baseball, there no longer is
after this past weekend.
The Atlanta-Cleveland show
down is the stuff of which a
sports fan's wildest dreams are
made, matching up the two best
teams in baseball. With Atlanta,
you have the game's best pitcher
in Maddux and the best pitching
staff. With Cleveland, you have
the game's most feared corked
bat hitter in Albert Belle and the
most feared offensive lineup.
What you have here is the leg
endary unstoppable force facing
the immovable object, with all
observers wondering which one
will crack first.
While the quality of play
through the first two games
could be categorized as sub-par
with defensive blunders, base
running snafus and unearned
runs galore, there was still some
darned good baseball and even
better drama and suspense. Mad
dux's two-hit clinic Saturday
night to give the Braves a 3-2 win
was nothing short of brilliant.
And Sunday night's matchup
provided an equally dramatic
one-run 4-3 Atlanta victory.
Who knows what else is in
store for baseball. All I know is
that I'll be waiting and asking
for more.

Princeton coming in first collegiately at 14:40.
With only three weeks of practice as
opposed to the months of preparation behind
semester schools, the Cardinal began the race
with determination. However, the Cardinal
trailed California, one of its most formidable
competitors, by less than 10 seconds when
tragedy struck. Another boat ran into Stan
ford, causing a serious impact which sent one
rower into the seat behind him, shaking the
entire team.
Due to the accident, the Cardinal lost close
to 15 seconds. Although the Cardinal started
up again and finished the race well, the dam
age was done.
"Judging on the problem of the accident, I

think we performed to our potential," said
head coach Wieslaw Kujda.
While the accident may have affected the
results of the competition, the team chooses
not to focus on the past, but to determine how
it might perform better in the future. For the
remainder of the season, the team plans to
improve on heightening its aggression and
quickening its decisions.
In any event, the Cardinal demonstrated
that it possesses the potential for a jrreat sea
son, and the Head of Charles may serve as a
motivating factor in future races.
"The team is taking on the challenges and
has a desire to go faster," Kujda said. "We
need to perform 100 percent."
