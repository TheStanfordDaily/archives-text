## 
### Laura Drum Contributing writer 
Last Sunday, the women's
crew team proved itself in its
First race of the year. The race
just happened to be the Head of
Charles, one of the most promi
nent crew competitions in the
United Suites.
The Charles River between
Boston and Cambridge, Mass.
served as the scene for the pres
tigious event. The Cardinal
arrived with only three weeks of
training and no previous compe
tition this season to place 10th
collegiately with a time of 17
minutes, 41 seconds against
prominent New England crew
schools such as Harvard and
Princeton.
First place went to Brown,
while Wisconsin and Princeton
captured second and third,
respectively.
Stanford's performance
demonstrated the potential
the Cardinal has this year.
The team finished only a cou
ple seconds behind Yale, which
normally ranks as one of the

best teams in the country.
The aura of the race con
tributed to its excitement. "I was
psyched just to be there," said
sophomore rower Katherine
Greig. "The leaves were turning
and the banks of the river were
packed."
Sophomore coxswain Kather
ine Bostick conveyed similar sen
timents. "There were so may
people there," she said. "It was
amazing."
Head coach Aimee Baker was
impressed with the entire
team's performance. Noting the
difficulty of the race for
coxswains, she expressed partic
ular pleasure with Bostick, who
coxswained the race for the first
time.
"It was definitely a tough
course," Bostick said.
With only three weeks of
preparation, the team <urived in
Boston not knowing what to
expect. The women now have
high expectations, and if they
continue to perform as well as
they did last Sunday, their sea
son will not be a disappointing
