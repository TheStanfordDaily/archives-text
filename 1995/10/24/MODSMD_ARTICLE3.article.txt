# Hero hunts help for sick child
## 
### Joyce Koo 
When mopping a floor last May, Victor Bacelis could
never have foreseen that the simple chore would lead
him to become both a guardian angel and a local
celebrity.
Bacelis, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant who lives
in Fremont, less than half an hour's drive from the
Stanford campus, found an envelope stuffed with $600
while cleaning a McDonald's bathroom. He turned it
in, and when the police could not identify the money's
owner, Bacelis donated it to a young Menlo Park child
suffering from a rare genet ic disease
This act of generosity brought Bacelis unforeseeable
fame, including an invitation to apply for a Stanford

scholarship and a job offer from the San Francisco
49ers.
Bacelis said he appreciates the offers and invitation,
but will put on hold his dream to study anthropology at
Stanford and get a better job.
"I'm not going to take anything until I get what I
want," he said.
Right now, Bacelis said all he wants to see is two
year-old Adrian Sandoval recover from the disease
which will kill him unless he receives a bone marrow
transplant. A week before he found the money, he read
a news article about Sandoval. Touched, Bacelis said he
knew he had to do something.
According to Bacelis, donating
$600 was not a big deal. He gave
the money away and then forgot
about it, never expecting the
incredible attention he received.
Bacelis said he accepted the pub
licity only to make more people
aware of Sandoval's condition.
Bacelis who came to the United
States in 1989 to study English,
works 70 hours a week at two jobs
to make a living. Bacelis said he
plans to quit one of his jobs to
devote more time to finding a
marrow match for the child.
Bacelis said compassion for the
two-year-old and a sense of injus
tice compels him to make saving

Sandoval his personal crusade. In
his free time, he hands out fliers
in the streets of San Jose, speaks
at churches, translates for His
panics, makes phone calls and vol
unteers at blood drives — all in an
attempt to encourage people to
get their blood tested.
He admitted that Sandoval is
only one of the many children
afflicted with this disease, but
siiid his only goal is for the child to
live.
"He wants to live. The longer it
takes to find the correct match,
the longer he suffers," Bacelis
said. "We can't wait."
Volunteering for good causes
isn't a new experience for him,
but this is by far the hardest one,
he said.
"Before, with a little money,
friendship and company, I could

solve some problems," Bacelis
said. "This time the issues are dif
ferent: It's about finding blood
and there is no immediate solu
tion."
Bacelis said he is encouraged
when people ask him how they
can help. Sadly, he said he discov
ers they are mostly children and
older people; others are too preoc
cupied with other obligations to
take time for other people. Get
ting a blood test has no significant
meaning in their lives, Bacelis
said.
Knowing that Stanford stu
dents are busy studying for the
future, his message to them is
simple: There are ways to help
without having to spend a lot of
time. Do whatever you can
because it feels good to help oth
ers, he said.
