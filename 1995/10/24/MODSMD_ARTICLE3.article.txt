# Hero hunts help for sick child

When mopping a floor last May, Victor Bacelis could
never have foreseen that the simple chore would lead
him to become both a guardian angel and a local
celebrity.
Bacelis, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant who lives
in Fremont, less than half an hour's drive from the
Stanford campus, found an envelope stuffed with $600
while cleaning a McDonald's bathroom. He turned it
in, and when the police could not identify the money's
owner, Bacelis donated it to a young Menlo Park child
suffering from a rare genet ic disease
This act of generosity brought Bacelis unforeseeable
fame, including an invitation to apply for a Stanford

scholarship and a job offer from the San Francisco
49ers.
Bacelis said he appreciates the offers and invitation,
but will put on hold his dream to study anthropology at
Stanford and get a better job.
"I'm not going to take anything until I get what I
want," he said.
Right now, Bacelis said all he wants to see is two
year-old Adrian Sandoval recover from the disease
which will kill him unless he receives a bone marrow
transplant. A week before he found the money, he read
a news article about Sandoval. Touched, Bacelis said he
knew he had to do something.
