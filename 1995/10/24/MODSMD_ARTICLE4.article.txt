Jonathan "Skip" Greenfield, a member of the Board
of Directors of the Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital at Stanford, died of a hrain tumor Oct. 14 at
his home in Woodside. He was 55.
Greenfield graduated from Stanford Law School in
1971, later joining the Gray, Gary, Ware and Freiden
rich law firm, where he was a partner at the time of his
death.
Along with his position on the children's hospital
board, he served as gener.il counsel for the Semicon
ductor Industry Association and other computer-relat
ed organizations.
Greenfield contributed greatly to the Board of Di
rectors, said board member Mary Goerz. I le was on the
board when she arrived 10 years ago, Goerz said, and
helped push through many significant decisions.
"I'm going to remember him as a generous, wise

man who really aired about very basic, important deci
sion making," Goerz said.
Greenfield helped the children's hospital and the
board in many ways, Goerz added.
On one occasion, Greenfield took the initiative to
help the hospital when work needed to be done on the
eroding banks of the San F rancisquito Creek that flows
nearby.
He contacted the Army Preservation Corps to work
on the problem and arranged the details for the work to
be carried out, Goerz said.
"It was a very difficult task that he did with great
ease," she said.
But overall, Greenfield will be remembered as "a
wonderful man," said another friend, Jerry Ruther
ford, former senior vice president for finance and de
velopment for the children's hospital.
"I was privileged to have an opportunity to work
with him," said Rutherford, who
did so for four years. "Me was
demanding but understanding. He
had a no-nonsense style about get
ting things done, balanced with a

wonderful, warm sense of humor."
Chair of the board's Strategic-
Planning Committee, Greenfield
was involved with current chil
dren's hospital issues as well as
issues stretching back to the years
when the hospital moved from its
old location on Sand Hill Road to its
current location on Welch Road at
the Medical Center.

"He's boon with the hospital
through days of spinning tho
dreams," said Goerz, adding that
Greenfield know Lucile Salter
Packard, for whom the children's
hospital is named.
"I think all the members of tho
board had a very high regard for
Skip," Goerz said. "We're going to
miss him a great deal."
