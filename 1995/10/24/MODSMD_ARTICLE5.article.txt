# Comm. Dept. faces recycling woes
## 
### Zachary Thacher Contributing writer 
Students are frustrated that an eight-month ab
sence of large recycling barrels at the Communica
tion Department has left them with few recycling
options.
Although three small barrels have returned since
fire officials pulled the largerbins in March, students
are still finding it difficult to recycle.
Several obstacles stand in the way of heightened
recycling programs. According to Facilities Opera
tions Grounds Manager Herb Fong, miscommunica
tion between the University, fire officials and the
waste vendor, Peninsula Sanitary Services, compli
cates barrel distribution.
According to University Fire Marshal Joseph
Idling, county fire officials began to enforce tighter
fire codes in academic buildings last year, leading to
the pulled barrels and confusion in on-campus recy
cling efforts.
Although Deputy County Fire Marshal Allison
Pena would not comment, Idling confirmed that
Pena "started going into non-residential buildings"
during the last academic year to deal with "code-re
lated issues."
Budgetary constraints also keep current recycling
levels at a standstill.
"We're trying to stabilize the current size or our
operation," said Fong. "It costs us more every time
we take out a new bin."
Recycling efforts at Stanford
Recycling at Stanford remains high, but it seems
to have reached a plateau.
"It's just a pity how much we throw away," said

Communication Department. As
far as recycling in her depart
ment, "It's really gone down,"
she said.
Enough materials are being
recycled to meet a state require
ment that counties reduce their
waste load 25 percent by 1995.
The law also stipulates that by
the year 2000 there must be a
further 50 percent waste reduc
tion.
A radical overhaul of on-cam
pus recycling is needed if the 50
percent goal is to be realized,
Fong said.
But the University is waiting
to see if the waste-reduction leg
islation will change before
investing the necessary funds to
step up recycling efforts.
"We're moving very cautious
ly and conservatively," said
Fong. "I'd hate to invest a lot of
money at this point if things are
going to change down the
stream."
Fire safety concerns
Meanwhile the University, fire
officials and the waste vendor are
trying to become more coordinat
ed in their efforts to maximize
the existent recycling programs.
One of the questions which needs
to be resolved is whether card
board recycling barrels are fire
hazards in and of themselves, or
if their placement is the issue.
Capt. Dan Wallace of the Palo
Alto Fire Department said card

board barrels for paper are haz
ardous because they contain
combustible materials, while
Leung recommends placing bar
rels in building lounges.
Yet in the Political Science
Department and the Law School,
recycling barrels are placed near
fire exits and in the hallways,
suggesting either that miscom
munication exists among the fire
officials responsible for inspec
tions or that inspections are
unbalanced.
Denise Frazier, a department
assistant in the political science
building, said although she had
been asked to remove a few of
the recycling containers by fire
inspectors, as far as she knows
the remaining barrels aren't
considered hazards.
These inspection standards
contrast the stricter restrictions
imposed upon the Communica
tion Department where barrels
in all of the hallways were
pulled.
"Are there exceptions? Yeah,
in life there are exceptions to the
rules," Leung acknowledged.
Replacement of barrels
After the barrel removal in
March, Barbara Katoaka, a
senior administrator in the Com
munication Department, called
Stanford's Facilities Operations
and Peninsula Sanitary Services
to find out how recycling should
continue at the building. Katoa
ka would not comment about the
barrels, saying the issue has got
ten out of control.
A meeting between Katoaka,
Fong and a fire engineer last

week allowed for the return of
three smaller cardboard barrels
tucked away in office areas.
"The paper carts are fine as
long as they are not in major
thoroughfares," said Peninsula
Sanitary Services Operations
Coordinator Julie Muir.
Peninsula Sanitary Services is
in the middle of re-negotiating
its contract with Stanford's
Facilities Operations Depart
ment. The contract is worth
"several millions of dollars,"
Fong said. But more aggressive
recycling isn't on the agenda.
According to Fong, no new
system has been devised to step
up recycling efforts in the build
ing.
"Our concern is the overall
co of these programs," Fong
said, adding that placing new
bins in more academic and office
areas isn't being considered.
"It gets to be a cost factor.
You'll never get it really perfect
no matter where you are," said
Jack Enriquez, the recycling
supervisor at the Stanford Recy
cling Center, which is operated
by Peninsula Sanitary Services.
Students involved in environ
mental initiatives at Stanford
recognize that although there is
much room for improvement in
recycling, the existing agencies
are limited in scope.
"People always wish that
there were more bins on cam
pus," said senior Deron Sedy
from the Environmental Repre
sentative Network.

tion between the University, fire officials and the
waste vendor, Peninsula Sanitary Services, compli
cates barrel distribution.
According to University Fire Marshal Joseph
Idling, county fire officials began to enforce tighter
fire codes in academic buildings last year, leading to
the pulled barrels and confusion in on-campus recy
cling efforts.
Although Deputy County Fire Marshal Allison
Pena would not comment, Idling confirmed that
Pena "started going into non-residential buildings"
during the last academic year to deal with "code-re
lated issues."
Budgetary constraints also keep current recycling
levels at a standstill.
"We're trying to stabilize the current size or our
operation," said Fong. "It costs us more every time
we take out a new bin."
Recycling efforts at Stanford
Recycling at Stanford remains high, but it seems
to have reached a plateau.
"It's just a pity how much we throw away," said
Kay Luo, a media studies graduate student in the


Ingricl Hemela — Daily
A recycling bin sits outside the Communication
Department.
Communication Department. As
far as recycling in her depart
ment, "It's really gone down,"
she said.
Enough materials are being
recycled to meet a state require
ment that counties reduce their
waste load 25 percent by 1995.
The law also stipulates that by
the year 2000 there must be a
further 50 percent waste reduc
tion.
A radical overhaul of on-cam
pus recycling is needed if the 50
percent goal is to be realized,
Fong said.
But the University is waiting
to see if the waste-reduction leg
islation will change before
investing the necessary funds to
step up recycling efforts.
"We're moving very cautious
ly and conservatively," said
Fong. "I'd hate to invest a lot of
money at this point if things are
going to change down the
stream."
Fire safety concerns
Meanwhile the University, fire
officials and the waste vendor are
trying to become more coordinat
ed in their efforts to maximize
the existent recycling programs.
One of the questions which needs
to be resolved is whether card
board recycling barrels are fire
hazards in and of themselves, or
if their placement is the issue.
Capt. Dan Wallace of the Palo
Alto Fire Department said card

board barrels for paper are haz
ardous because they contain
combustible materials, while
Leung recommends placing bar
rels in building lounges.
Yet in the Political Science
Department and the Law School,
recycling barrels are placed near
fire exits and in the hallways,
suggesting either that miscom
munication exists among the fire
officials responsible for inspec
tions or that inspections are
unbalanced.
Denise Frazier, a department
assistant in the political science
building, said although she had
been asked to remove a few of
the recycling containers by fire
inspectors, as far as she knows
the remaining barrels aren't
considered hazards.
These inspection standards
contrast the stricter restrictions
imposed upon the Communica
tion Department where barrels
in all of the hallways were
pulled.
"Are there exceptions? Yeah,
in life there are exceptions to the
rules," Leung acknowledged.
Replacement of barrels
After the barrel removal in
March, Barbara Katoaka, a
senior administrator in the Com
munication Department, called
Stanford's Facilities Operations
and Peninsula Sanitary Services
to find out how recycling should
continue at the building. Katoa
ka would not comment about the
barrels, saying the issue has got
ten out of control.
A meeting between Katoaka,
Fong and a fire engineer last

week allowed for the return of
three smaller cardboard barrels
tucked away in office areas.
"The paper carts are fine as
long as they are not in major
thoroughfares," said Peninsula
Sanitary Services Operations
Coordinator Julie Muir.
Peninsula Sanitary Services is
in the middle of re-negotiating
its contract with Stanford's
Facilities Operations Depart
ment. The contract is worth
"several millions of dollars,"
Fong said. But more aggressive
recycling isn't on the agenda.
According to Fong, no new
system has been devised to step
up recycling efforts in the build
ing.
"Our concern is the overall
co of these programs," Fong
said, adding that placing new
bins in more academic and office
areas isn't being considered.
"It gets to be a cost factor.
You'll never get it really perfect
no matter where you are," said
Jack Enriquez, the recycling
supervisor at the Stanford Recy
cling Center, which is operated
by Peninsula Sanitary Services.
Students involved in environ
mental initiatives at Stanford
recognize that although there is
much room for improvement in
recycling, the existing agencies
are limited in scope.
"People always wish that
there were more bins on cam
pus," said senior Deron Sedy
from the Environmental Repre
sentative Network.
