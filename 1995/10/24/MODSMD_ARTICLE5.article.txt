# Comm. Dept. faces recycling woes

### Zachary Thacher Contributing writer 
Students are frustrated that an eight-month ab
sence of large recycling barrels at the Communica
tion Department has left them with few recycling
options.
Although three small barrels have returned since
fire officials pulled the largerbins in March, students
are still finding it difficult to recycle.
Several obstacles stand in the way of heightened
recycling programs. According to Facilities Opera
tions Grounds Manager Herb Fong, miscommunica
tion between the University, fire officials and the
waste vendor, Peninsula Sanitary Services, compli
cates barrel distribution.
According to University Fire Marshal Joseph
Idling, county fire officials began to enforce tighter
fire codes in academic buildings last year, leading to
the pulled barrels and confusion in on-campus recy
cling efforts.
Although Deputy County Fire Marshal Allison
Pena would not comment, Idling confirmed that
Pena "started going into non-residential buildings"
during the last academic year to deal with "code-re
lated issues."
Budgetary constraints also keep current recycling
levels at a standstill.
"We're trying to stabilize the current size or our
operation," said Fong. "It costs us more every time
we take out a new bin."
Recycling efforts at Stanford
Recycling at Stanford remains high, but it seems
to have reached a plateau.
"It's just a pity how much we throw away," said
