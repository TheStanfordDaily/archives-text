# Grad leave is still risky in new rules
## 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
This fall's graduate handtxx)k re
veals a disheartening fact about a
student's ability to leave Stanford
temporarily and return under the
same circumstances: It's not as easy
as one might think.
The new policy arose from an ef
fort to clarify University policy on
leaves of absence for graduate stu
dents.
The near-final version of the
leave policy was presented last April
to the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Graduate Studios by the Person
al Leave for Graduate Students
Committee. It was finalized and in
serted this fall into the Graduate
Students Handbook, replacing what
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker called a "widely mis
understood" leave policy.
According to Dekker, concern
about the leave policy originated a
few years ago when a graduate stu
dent who was reviewing the new
handbook approached Dekker and
said that he was surprised Stanford
didn't have a specific maternity
leave policy.

"I agreed, and we got together a
group of people to discuss the issue,"
Dekker said. "It was obvious to us
that University policy should recog
nize more than medical justifica
tions for leave."
The excerpt on leave from this
fall's handbook amplifies and clari
fes what is at stake when a graduate
student needs to take a leave of ab
sence, Dekker said. "We haven't
changed basic policy. We've clarified
and communicated it better."
Chris Golde, a graduate student
in English who has been involved
with this and other graduate stu
dent issues, agreed with Dekker's
assessment: "I saw the policy as pre
senting guidelines rather than
rights. But it's better than nothing
and better than what was written
before."
However, Golde said, the new
policy doesn't give students much
protection in terms of financing
their education, specifically women.
"It's outrageous that female stu
dents are not protected when they
withdraw to have a child."
Although the basic "leave of ab


Dekker
sence" policy permits a student to
leave the University iind all Univer
sity services temporarily without
compromising his or her potential
for return at the end of the leave
period, the policy does not provide a
mechanism to deal with the prob
lems associated with reinstating a
student's financial aid package.
The new handbook is intention
ally vague about the University's
financial commitment to the stu
dent once he or she has obtained a
leave of absence and wishes to
return back to school, Dekker said.
The financial implications of tak
ing a leave, which Dekker said were
students' "most critical concern," is
the focus of the handbook. Student
aid "was the area we paid most
attention to in the end," he said.
Golde said the jxilicy brought to
the surface frightening implications
for the financial aid package of a
graduate student taking a leave.
"Specifically, the policy says things
that are meant to provoke you into
not taking leave. It alerts the student
to the consequences of leaving."
A graduate student financial aid
package usually consists of a Uni
versity fellowship in combination
with a teaching or research assis
tantship within that student's
department. "However, because
lx)tb academic programs and finan
cial aid packages are usually careful
ly sequenced over a period of years..
. interruptions of more than a quar
ter could result in partial loss of
future funding and slower time to
degree," t he handbook says.
The handbook cites an example
of a graduate student in the sciences

and engineering who, having taken
a leave of absence, must join a new
research project when he or she
returns to study.
To the fullest extent possible,
departments act on the principle
that a leave of absence "stops the
clock" with regard to eligibility for
Stanford-based financial aid,
according to the handbook. "We
could not say that Stanford will let
you come back the way your status
wzis before, especially for students in
the sciences and engineering,"
Dekker said.
According to Dekker, the political
and economic budget-cutting mood
prevailing in Congress is one of the
primary reasons the University is
unable to make this financial com
mitment to its students.
"With the worst-case scenario in
D.C., we would have difficulty pro
viding financial aid to the students
(who don't t;ike leaves of absence!.
In science and engineering, we're
dependent on federal money," he
said.
Although Dekker said that he
does not feel that the worst-case sce
nario will happen, he explained that
the financial risks of the mid-90s
prevent the University from imple
menting a leave policy that guaran
tees aid to a returning student.
The message of this policy is
twofold, however. According to
Dekker, the University Ls trying to
tell the student "not to count on | the
money]," while at the same time
encouraging the faculty and staff to
make a "bona fide effort" to rein
state the financial aid.
However, Golde said, this policy
hardly affects what action the facul
ty will take. "It has not changed the
fact if a department wants to screw
you out of your funding because you
leave, that's okay," she said.

Regardless of this policy, the
problems associated with leaving
are still paramount for the Stanford
graduate student. From almost
every angle, the student is encour
aged not to tiike a leave of absence.
In fact, just the format of the stu
dent handbook, with sections enti
tled "alternative strategies" and
"cautions," stresses the difficulty of
leaving.
"I think that we went into it
believing that we should make (leav
ing) easier, but ... we decided to
encourage students that leave was
an action not to take lightly,"
Dekker said.
Dekker agrees that the current
policy will not make a student's
leave any less difficult, but will
make the student more aware of the
intricacies of leave. "The message of
our statement" is that the student
am usually avoid the "pitfalls" of a
leave if he or she just "plans ahead,"
Dekker said.
It's difficult to plan ahead for
emergencies, however. And even
though the new policy clarifies sev
eral issues involved with leave,
among all of the suggestions and
guidelines in the handbook, it Ls not
clear on what a student should do in
an emergency situation.
Dekker said that he was confi
dent that there would always be a
way to leave without "compromis
ing [a student's] academic
progress."
He added, however, that with the
current budget crunch in Washing
ton, it is impossible for the Universi
ty to assure a student's financial sta
tus won't be complicated by a leave.
Golde disagrees, however. "If the
University wanted [to protect the
student I enough, they could do it,"
she said.
