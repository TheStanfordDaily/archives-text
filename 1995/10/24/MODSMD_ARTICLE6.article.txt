# Grad leave is still risky in new rules

This fall's graduate handtxx)k re
veals a disheartening fact about a
student's ability to leave Stanford
temporarily and return under the
same circumstances: It's not as easy
as one might think.
The new policy arose from an ef
fort to clarify University policy on
leaves of absence for graduate stu
dents.
The near-final version of the
leave policy was presented last April
to the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Graduate Studios by the Person
al Leave for Graduate Students
Committee. It was finalized and in
serted this fall into the Graduate
Students Handbook, replacing what
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker called a "widely mis
understood" leave policy.
According to Dekker, concern
about the leave policy originated a
few years ago when a graduate stu
dent who was reviewing the new
handbook approached Dekker and
said that he was surprised Stanford
didn't have a specific maternity
leave policy.

"I agreed, and we got together a
group of people to discuss the issue,"
Dekker said. "It was obvious to us
that University policy should recog
nize more than medical justifica
tions for leave."
The excerpt on leave from this
fall's handbook amplifies and clari
fes what is at stake when a graduate
student needs to take a leave of ab
sence, Dekker said. "We haven't
changed basic policy. We've clarified
and communicated it better."
Chris Golde, a graduate student
in English who has been involved
with this and other graduate stu
dent issues, agreed with Dekker's
assessment: "I saw the policy as pre
senting guidelines rather than
rights. But it's better than nothing
and better than what was written
before."
However, Golde said, the new
policy doesn't give students much
protection in terms of financing
their education, specifically women.
"It's outrageous that female stu
dents are not protected when they
withdraw to have a child."
Although the basic "leave of ab
