# ID card debit plan still faces hurdles

Stanford Card Plan holders try
ing to use their new ID cards to buy
school supplies at the Stanford
Bookstore or a bag of chips at
Tresidder Express might be sur
prised to find out that the plan is not
yet as widespread as was originaLly
intended.
Despite being told last year that
the card would be accepted by sever
al on-campus businesses, students
still cannot use the card at the Book
store, Tresidder Express or for
ASSU business projects.
The Stanford Card Plan is an on
campus debit option which allows
students to use ID cards as a means
to purchase food at Bon Appetit
Eood Service or at dining halls, pay
for services at Cowell Student
Health Center and buy tickets for
athletic events.

According to Bursar Jon Erick
son, some students have already put
hundreds of dollars into their ac
count, intending to use it to pur
chase books at the Bookstore.
Although refunds were not origi
nally part of the plan, exceptions
were made for the students who
thought they could use their ac
counts at the Bookstore.
Erickson explained that the Uni
versity plans "to start small and get
some experience. Stanford has no
experience in running a card of this
nature." He acknowledged that
Stanford is one of the last places in
the country to adopt this sort of sys
tem and wants to keep the program
"relatively central and relatively
easy to mange" at first.
The Bookstore, as well as its
Tresidder Express subsidiary,
should be added soon, but Erickson
said contracts must be drawn up
first because they are separate busi
nesses which tire not affiliated with
the University.
Ken Shark, director of operations
at the Bookstore, said the Bookstore
is interested in the plan, but he is
unsure if it would really be beneficial
to the store because of processing
costs. He said the plan would more
likely "really benefit Tres Ex,"
because it would create new cus
tomers.
While the Bursar's Office has
not received a great deal of feed
back concerning satisfaction with
the new ID cards, Erickson said he
is viewing "no news as good news"
and admit ted that there have been

a few students upset as a result of
computer problems.
"Sometimes the |card| readers
don't work," Erickson said. "Like
any computer system, there are
always times when it goes down.
"We are looking for ways to make
customer service a lot smoother," he
added. For instance, in order to help
appease customers, Bon Appetit has
set up a credit voucher so account
holders am be charged on paper
when the system Ls down, rather
than being forced to return the food
they hope to purchase.
Erickson said the expansion of
services accepting the plan will (xx-ur
"once we get experience under the
belt. The sky is the limit on campus."
The University hopes that the
plan will eventually support virtual
ly all financial transactions on aim
pus, Erickson said, adding that the
University hoped to install some
washing machines, dryers and vend

ing machines which accept the aird
as means of payment as soon as win
ter quarter.
Erickson said ATM-like
machines which allow students to
add cash to their Stanford Card
Plan accounts will be installed all
around campus in January, "if
everything goes right." Residen
tial computing laser printing is
another area heing considered for
expansion.
Overall, Erickson said the Uni
versity is satisfied with the plan. He
added that there are about 1,350
participants, with most activity
occurring at Bon Appetit. Despite a
few minor glitches, Erickson called
the plan exciting because it shows
"Stanford is finally coming into the
20th century."
Questions about account status
or iibout the plan in general should
be directed to the Cashier's ()ffice or
498-PIAN.
