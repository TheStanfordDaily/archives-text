Castro talks politics
NEW YORK (AP) — As Cuban leader Fidel Castro moved
about the power centers of New York yesterday, he played
down his treatment as a pariah and noted that his country
could learn a few things about business from the United
States.
Smiling broadly within his phalanx of U.S. Secret Service and
Cuban security agents, Castro gave an interview to CBS anchor
man Dan Rather and met with members of the U.S. business
community at the Council on Foreign Relations, a private think
tank.
He told Rather he was interested in learning how to make
Cuba's economy "more efficient" and give it "good leaders."
Comparing the Cuban economy to a huge U.S. corporation, he
said, "The only difference is that you know how to manage it well
and we don't."
Asked if he believed communism had failed, Castro replied, "I
can tell you quite the opposite. . . . Capitalist governments have
been a failure," citing poverty and illiteracy as examples.
