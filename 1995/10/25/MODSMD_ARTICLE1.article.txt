# 'It is the obligation of the filmmaker to discover the truth'
## Director Stone waxes iconoclastic 
### Stewart Maclennan Contributing writer 
Students at Stanford can find it
very easy to accept professors' well
honed interpretations of history, and
are sometimes too intimidated to chal
lenge those assertions.
Oliver Stone would find that alarm
ing.
Speaking before a vocal audience in
a sold-out Memorial Auditorium last
night, Stone implored his audience to
examine history with a skeptical and
penetrating eye. Quoting Oscar Wilde,
he said, "Our duty as historians is to
rewrite history,"
The first in a series of speeches
sponsored by the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau, Stone's hrief but dynamic talk
drew mixed reactions from the audi
ence. The question-and-answer ses
sion was marked by equal amounts of
aggression and adulation.
A recipient of the Purple Heart for
his service in Vietnam. Stone has been

writing, producing and directing his
own scripts for more than 20 years,
earning him three Academy Awards
and 33 Oscar nominations.
Although Stone wrote his first
novel at the age of 18, it was his tour of
duty in Vietnam that made him realize
the importance of his senses. "If you
don't see, you die," he explained in an
interview after the speech.
On his return to the United States,
Stone was disturbed by what he de
scribed as America's "blanket of indif
ference to its own history."
"The veterans came home to fight a
second war against a public that was
embarrassed to acknowledge Viet
nam," he said, adding that people were
afraid to discover the real reasons for
the U.S. military campaign.
According to Stone, Vietnam was
considered an adventurous border war
in 1969. "In 1975, it was an embar
rassing defeat, and still in 1985, no one
would discuss 'Platoon,' " he said.
"After the movie, there was an out

pouring ol emotion to the veterans,
Stone said.
Stone described this unwillingness
to examine history as one of several
"mass illusions" which prompted him
to focus on producing films which force
people to challenge information sup
plied by broadcast news stations such
as CNN, government statements and
"consensus journalism."
"If you have traveled abroad, you
get another spin, another story than
the one you'll get through the media at
home," he said.
Stone's films, which have included
"Porn on the Fourth of July," "JFK"
and "Natural Porn Killers," typically
present controversial interpretations
of history which provoke strong reac
tions from his audiences.
"My subjects are shrouded in secre
cy," he said, adding that films such as
"JFK" support the "principle that
there should be no secret material kept

Advising students to question fundamental assumptions, director Oliver Stone spoke on his life and his films in Memorial Auditorium
by the government."
Stone stressed that govern
ment deception continues to thii
day, claiming that the Centra
Intelligence Agency has violatec
its charter by using U.S. tax dol
lars to finance undercover assassi

nations in Guatemala and Chile.
Stone also asked the audience
to consider that all history is
biased by those who write it.
"History is written by those
who win," he said. "It is a percep
tion laid out by the intelligentsia
of the time.
"Who will guard the guards
themselves?" he asked, stressing
the need of artists to counter the
dominant mass media interpreta

tions of history.
"I believe it is the obligation of
the filmmaker to discover the
truth," Stone said, but he admit
ted that knowledge is never defi
nite.
"All time is circular in its reve
lations," he said. "We are always
rediscovering knowledge we
already know.
"No one has a lock on the
truth."
