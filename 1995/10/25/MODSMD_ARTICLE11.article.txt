# Budget vote approaches
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With the fate
of budget-balancing drive at stake,
Republican congressional leaders juggled
competing demands yesterday, ranging
from rural House members unhappy with
cuts proposed for farm programs to mod
erate senators demanding more money for
education.
Republican lawmakers in both houses
also vied for larger helpings of the Medi
caid pie for their home states as showdown
votes loom tomorrow in the House and
Friday in the Senate.
"This is the most important vote that
we will have cast in Congress in the 23
years I've been here," said Senate GOP
Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi. The mea
sure is designed to balance the budget in
seven years.
Democrats, not disputing the impor

tance of the vote, attacked the GOP mea
sure as unfair. Their opposition was
expected""Co"be unanimous in"The~Senate
and nearly so in the House.
President Clinton is widely expected to
veto the measure if it reaches his desk,
although a follow-up, year-end stab at
compromise seems likely between the
Democratic chief executive and the GOP
majorities in Congress.
For now, though, the scope of the legis
lation is vast, from hundreds of billions of
dollars squeezed from Medicare, Medicaid
and welfare to a minor, $'21 million item in
the House measure authorizing the Forest
Service to sell 40 ski areas at market value.
Republicans also folded a $245 billion
tax cut into their plan, a provision that
unsettled many moderate GOP lawmak
ers of both houses.
