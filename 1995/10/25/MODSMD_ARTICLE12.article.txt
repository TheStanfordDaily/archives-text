# U.S., China hold positive Meeting

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - In talks
laced with tension, President
Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin tried yesterday to
stabilize relations shaken by
disputes over human rights,
trade and Taiwan. The adminis
tration called it "a significant
step forward" but acknowl
edged problems persist.
Clinton and Jiang talked for
two hours at Lincoln Center
after China demanded that the
meeting be moved from the
New York Public Library. A
human rights exhibit at the
library included scenes from
Beijing's Tiananmen Square,
where hundreds of pro-democ
racy advocates were killed in
1989.
White House press secretary
Mike McCurry quoted Clinton
as saying that it was "a very
positive meeting and certainly
the best of the three meetings
that he has held to date with
President Jiang Zemin."
Despite the upbeat assess
ment, the administration said it
was not a problem-solving
meeting.
"I would put the stress
more . . . . [on] resuming
momentum, resuming dia
logues and exchanges so we
can solve these problems,"
said Winston Lord, assistant
secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs.
Jiang indicated that his over
riding concern was Taiwan,
which China regards as a rene
gade province.
On that point, Clinton reaf
firmed that the United States
has a "one China" policy that
does not advocate independence
for Taiwan. Lord said the issue
was still sensitive but Jiang

agreed it should not dominate
U.S.-Chinese relations.
China was furious when
Clinton allowed Taiwanese
President Lee Teng-hui to make
an unofficial visit to the United
States this year. Clinton told
Jiang he couldn't rule out fur
ther visits but that they would
be unofficial, private and rare,
Lord said.
The two leaders agreed to try
to cooperate on a new range of
issues, such as fighting interna
tional crime and attacking the
flow of narcotics. Clinton also
pressed Jiang to open China's
markets.
Clinton did not gain a firm
pledge from Jiang to agree to
push for an international ban
on all nuclear weapons tests
next year, as Russian President
Boris Yeltsin did on Monday.
France, Britain and the United
States are already on board.
Lord said Jiang gave "a positive
general reaction but without a
specific commitment."
Officials said Clinton also
raised a number of human
rights cases with Jiang, includ
ing dissidents Wei Jingsheng
and Chen Ziming. Jiang demon
strated a "willingness to hold an
exchange on human rights,"
Lord said.
But Chinese Foreign Min
istry spokesman Chen Jian said
the differences between Ameri
ca and China are deep, coming
from a wide social and political
divide.
"I think the Chinese side has
all along accepted the universal
ity of human rights," he said.
"At the same time, we point out
that countries differ in their
specific national conditions.
And they have different priori-
