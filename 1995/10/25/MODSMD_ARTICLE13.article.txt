Asia eclipsed
ANGKOR, Cambodia (AP) — Braving the threat of evil
spirits and Khmer Rouge guerrillas, thousands of Cambodi
ans and foreign tourists marveled today as a rare solar eclipse
cast shadows over the fabled temples of Angkor.
About 30,000 soldiers and policemen stood guard against
possible guerrilla attacks amid the soaring towers of Angkor
Wat, the most famous edifice of the temple complex built
between the ninth and 1 '2th centuries.
But there was no violence as people watched the first total
eclipse seen in Cambodia and neighboring Southeast Asian
countries since 1955 — and the last one until 2070.
Soldiers and spectators alike were warned not to fire
weapons or make loud noises. In many Asian countries, peo
ple make loud noises made with pots, drums or guns to scare
away evil spirits believed to cause the eclipse.

Disney director was sex offender
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The director of "Powder," a new
Walt Disney film about a troubled teenager, is a convicted
child molester who once videotaped himself having oral sex
with a 12-year-old actor.
The film's release this Friday in 1/200 U.S. theaters has
prompted the molestation victim, Nathan Winters, now 20, to
go public with his ordeal to protest Disney's employment of
filmmaker Victor Salva.
On Monday night, Winters and five friends picketed out
side the industry screening of "Powder," handing leaflets
about Salva's conviction to hundreds of grim-faced Hollywood
executives leaving the theater.
Disney and the film's producer argue that Salva has served
his time. Salva, 37, said in a statement yesterday that he
regrets his actions.
