Director of student
Activities Nanci Howe said
last week that some areas of
the Stanford campus are deliber
ately poorly lighted so as to discour
age people from walking through
them at night.
Such logic seems draconian.
There remain poorly lighted parts
of campus which students cannot
avoid traversing at night. This sit
uation is unsafe and should be
remedied.
In order to provide students
with security and a sense of safety,
the Department of Public Safety
has designated specific nighttime
travel routes. While this is an
excellent idea, there are still gaps
which include streets that some
residents have to take to get to
their dorms, as well as areas near
buildings where students exit
before they can get to a designated
travel route.
Furthermore, the lighting along
these specified travel routes is
often times inadequate. For exam

pie, the trees and shrubbery
around the Storke Student Publi
cations Building block out much of
the light that is supposed to shine
onto Santa Teresa. But then, stu
dents who work on publications
late into the night should be glad
that at least one side of the build
ing is lighted at all. In several
areas around Storke, it remains
pitch black throughout the night.
Some more examples of inade
quate lighting include the path
between White Plaza and Meyer
Library, the road leading up to
Roble Hall and the winding paths
running through Escondido Vil
lage. These pockets of darkness
can hide potential assailants.
In a way, Howe's appeal to com
mon sense is understandable.
However, this defense should not
be used to absolve the University
of its obligation to allocate the
resources necessary to insure that
campus lighting is adequate and
that "safe routes" live up to their
name.
