Nowadays, if you think
the information revolution
moves too fast and that
technology needs to be closely mon
itored, people tend to write you off
as another Unabomber.
But here at Stanford, we have a
special responsibility to make sure
that, in the interest of teaching and
human contact, technological inno
vation doesn't become a goal unto
itself.
Recently, the University has
been working on an experimental
new program called ADEPT (Asyn
chronous Distance Education Pro
ject). This program will allow stu
dents to use computers to view lec
tures and receive class materials
from one of four Stanford engineer
ing courses.
Still in the planning stages, the
program has the obvious advantage
of allowing students from around
the world to be exposed to Stan

ford's rich intellectual environ
ment. While there is exciting poten
tial in this new technology, there is
also reason to be frightened. Lec
tures and problem sets are only one
part of learning. Outright exposure
to human contact and the chance to
interact and learn from one's peers
are also important components of
one's education.
ADEPT is only one example of
an increasing focus on learning-by
computer, and a minor one at that.
But the project points to a larger
trend throughout the University —
using the net as a teaching tool.
However, doing so risks insulating
students from one another, destroy
ing a large part of our viable aca
demic climate.
Today, the proverbial informa
tion superhighway moves and
changes as fast as the data it car
ries. As on any highway, we must be
prepared to impose speed limits.
