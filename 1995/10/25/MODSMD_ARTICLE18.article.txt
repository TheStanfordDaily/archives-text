## Call me, telephone blonde 
### 
After reading josh Gohike's
column last Friday, I decided to give
him a call and offer some friendly
advice. I felt it was a columnist's duty to
constructively criticize a colleague's work
and, hopefully, raise the level of quality. I
hope you, as readers, appreciate not only
this, but all the behind-the-scenes work
that I do just to come up with 3,600 high
quality characters every Wednesday (and
now Friday).
The operator gave me Gohike's number
— 7-5867. I dialed and was answered by a
far too cheerful voice bubbling out, "Hi,
you've reached 7-JUMP! This is Josh!"
I was a bit startled, but only a moment's
pause proceeded my introduction. I said
who I was and began to question the value
of the phrase "semiotic sojourn." I asked if
it was not too pretentious of an allitera
tion, but heard only "Jump! Jump!" as an
answer. I started to try to convince him to
descend from his pedestal and better direct
his efforts towards the proletariat (after
all, he does look a little bit like Trotsky
with short hair).
I cut my efforts short when I realized he
wasn't paying attention to me but was
singing along to the Kriss Kross song
"Jump." I asked him if he like the song and
he replied, "Yeah, man, I love it! I have it
on constant repeat so it plays 24 hours a
day! I am so psyched that my number is 7-
JUMP! Yeah, 7-JUMP!!"
I wished him well, and made a mental
note to try and get the Bridge to give him a
house call. His unwarranted celebration of

an alphabetic acronym for his phone num
ber caused me to think of how desperately
Stanford students to make snazzy
words out of their pitiful phone numbers.
Our special ability to drop the first two
numbers of the exchange when making on
campus calls only increases this practice. I
decided to call up a few numbers which had
cool corresponding words to see what I
could.
I only had to get one thing first, from
my high-tech PI friend. He's a little bald,
but was able to quickly provide me with
what I needed: a computerized phone
tracking system that would map where on
campus I was calling.
7-PREZ. This was a strange one. The
first thing I heard was in German, some
thing like, "Bei Casper." I looked on my
computer screen. I followed the yellow
tracking line (kind of like in Tron) as it
went from my position near the Dish (I
was in my car with my laptop and cellular)
down to the roof of Flo Mo. Once I recog
nized Gerhard's voice, I spat out, "Die Luft
der Freiheit kommt zu spaet!" He didn't
really answer, but I was gleeful since I had
found his secret on-campus hideaway,
accessible only from the roof. I'm sure he's
having highly important meetings with
visiting Nobel scientists and cute 1-Ls
there right now.
7-5555. It doesn't make any word, but
it is home to a frighteningly autonomous
answering machine that extols savage
descriptions about how its owner, paranoid
of technology, is incapacitated.

7-CELL. When I looked on the map
after calling this number, all of Stern wai
highlighted.
SLEEP. Dr. Dement's sleep lab, witl
the following message, "I'm either asleep..
or dreaming."
7-AASA. Same thing as CELL.
7-PAIN. The single in Toyon whicl
houses your favorite poetess. You know
the one who walks around campus dresset
in all black, periodically flinging hersel
down on her back to lift up her legs high ii
the air while exclaiming, "I've got th<
weight of the world on my shoulders!"
FINGER. Oops, wrong column.
DIIUNK Not a student's number, but
not surprisingly, a staff member's.
I drove down from the foothills ant
asked someone walking next to Laguniia l
they had a number that could be made int(
a cool name.
"Well," said Mark, a junior m CS,
don't have a real cool name for my phon<
number, but if'you put it into binary num
bers then look at it regularly, it makes l.(
x 1010."
Nauseous, I threw my high-tech phom
tracing system at Mark and dialec
DRUNK to see if Stockdale wanted to split
a keg.

Karl's phone number is the same as his ini
tials — Karl Oliver Hazen Kazaks, 7
KOI IK.
