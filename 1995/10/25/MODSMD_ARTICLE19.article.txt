The Daily misunderstood new grading policy

THE EDITORIAL IN The Daily on
Oct. 20 concerning the Universi
ty's new grading policy as it
relates to students in honors programs
is misleading. The editorial implies that
the grading symbol of "N" may no
longer be used for honors courses during
the quarters the honors thesis is being
written. This implication is not correct.
Nothing in the new grading policy
changes in any way the use of the "N"
symbol as it relates to honors courses.
Students who are doing honors the
ses typically register for units over two
or three quarters. At the end of the
quarters in which they have worked on

the thesis, but have not yet completed
the thesis, faculty may submit a grade
of "N," indicating that work is in
progress but not yet completed. At the
end of the quarter in which the thesis is
submitted, the professor submits a
grade for the honors course. The same
grade also replaces the "N" grades that
were submitted in the previous quar
ters. This is the procedure that has been
in place for many years and nothing in
the new grading policy changes this pro
cedure.
This procedure works satisfactorily
for students who complete their honors
theses and the great majority of stu-

dents who begin work on the theses see
the project through to completion. A
small minority of students who register
for honors work do not complete the
thesis. In those instances, faculty may
assign grades of S or NC based on the
research that was completed in prepara
tion for the thesis.
As an alternative to the use of the
"N" grade, faculty may assign regular
letter grades for each quarter in which
students enroll in honors units. Because
grades are assigned at the end of each
quarter, it is possible in this alternative
that the grades in honors courses would
vary from quarter to quarter.

Both of these alternatives were in
place before the recent changes in the
University's grading policy and remain
in place with the implementation of the
new grading policy. These procedures
are intended to give students sufficient
time and flexibility in their course load
to complete honors work. The new
grading policy does not preclude stu
dents in any way from pursuing honors
work, work which we all recognize can
be a very exciting and fruitful culmina
tion to students' academic careers at
Stanford.
