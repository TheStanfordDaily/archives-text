# Conservative newspaper once again embraces mascot
## 'Chief' resurrected in Review 
### Paul Bodnar Contributing writer 
The Indian, Stanford's one-time
mascot that was replaced by the
color Cardinal, has been revived
again in The Stanford Review. But
the heated protest the picture
sparked last year from members of
Stanford's Native American com
munity has not yet materialized.
The tomahawk-wielding, scowl
ing caricature of a Native American
chief again graces the pages of the
conservative newspaper. The
image, which was actively protest
ed by the Stanford Native Ameri
can Graduate Students, ran in

the paper's
weekly iss
ues through
out last fall
and was re
moved in
February.
Den n i
Woodward,
a Mescalero
Indian and
associate di-

rector of Stanford's American Indi
an Program Office, said the Native
American community is dismayed
at the return of the image.
"Human beings should be able to
choose not to be mascots," she said.

Bob Schmidt, the current editor
in chief of The Review, said the car
icature was not revived to deliber
ately anger Native Americans, but
for aesthetic reasons. "The image is
more visually appealing than the
picture used last year," be said.
The cartoon portrays a figure in
a feathered headdress. Clutching a
tomahawk and grimacing, the fig
ure is positioned at the top of the
"Smoke Signals" column, which of
fers brief commentary on campus
issues.
