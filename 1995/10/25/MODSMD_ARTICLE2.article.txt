# Conservative newspaper once again embraces mascot
## 'Chief' resurrected in Review 
### Paul Bodnar Contributing writer 
The Indian, Stanford's one-time
mascot that was replaced by the
color Cardinal, has been revived
again in The Stanford Review. But
the heated protest the picture
sparked last year from members of
Stanford's Native American com
munity has not yet materialized.
The tomahawk-wielding, scowl
ing caricature of a Native American
chief again graces the pages of the
conservative newspaper. The
image, which was actively protest
ed by the Stanford Native Ameri
can Graduate Students, ran in

the paper's
weekly iss
ues through
out last fall
and was re
moved in
February.
Den n i
Woodward,
a Mescalero
Indian and
associate di-

rector of Stanford's American Indi
an Program Office, said the Native
American community is dismayed
at the return of the image.
"Human beings should be able to
choose not to be mascots," she said.

Bob Schmidt, the current editor
in chief of The Review, said the car
icature was not revived to deliber
ately anger Native Americans, but
for aesthetic reasons. "The image is
more visually appealing than the
picture used last year," be said.
The cartoon portrays a figure in
a feathered headdress. Clutching a
tomahawk and grimacing, the fig
ure is positioned at the top of the
"Smoke Signals" column, which of
fers brief commentary on campus
issues.
Last fall, members of the Native
American community expressed

their displeasure at the imago by
writing a letter to University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper demanding
the removal of the caricature, com
plaining that the image was racist
and that it lumped all the Native
American tribes together under
one stereotype.
After Casper responded that he
did not have the authority to cen
sor the picture, protesters deposit
ed dozens of shredded copies of
The Review m front of Casper's
office.
Near the end of fall quarter last
year, The Review's editorial board
met with representatives of the
Native American community to

discuss the controversy, but no
compromise was reached.
However, in Volume 14 inaugu
rated la.st winter, the caricature
was replaced by a photograph of a
tribal chief, seen in silhouette in
front of a fire.
Schmidt said The Review's edi
torial board removed the photo
graph at the end of last year
because it did not draw enough
attention to the column. When
asked whether he expected remon
stration for the decision, he said,
"My actions cannot be dictated
based on what other groups might
do. In a perfect world, we might
have used a different picture that
would be satisfactory to idl groups,
but we cannot do that."
Schmidt also emphasized that
the decision to use the image was
not made without considering la.st

year's controversy. However, he
said, aesthetic issues outweighed
the protests in the final decision.
Although members of the
Native American community have
not yet discussed a path of possible
action, Woodward said the alumni
present at the 2f)th anniversary
celebration of the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization were
upset to see the return of the mas
cot, which many of them success
fully worked to abolish in 1972.
"They were saddened to see
such a blatant disregard for a race
of human beings," she said. Cou
pled with the high-profile World
Series contest between the Atlanta
Braves and the Cleveland Indians,
the caricature makes this a diffi
cult time for the fight against
Native American stereotypes, she
added.
