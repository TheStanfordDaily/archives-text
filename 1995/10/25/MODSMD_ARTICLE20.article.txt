# Corrections to postdoc research affiliates story
## 
### 
I would like to commend The Daily
for the time and care it obviously took
in preparing its article on the causes
and effects of the University's decision
to begin deducting Social Security
taxes and short-term disability insur
ance from the salaries of post-doctoral
research affiliates.
The Daily is accurate in stating that
the decision to begin making these
deductions was necessitated by
increasingly narrow interpretations by
the IRS as to who is a "student" and
under what conditions. It is also accu
rate in stating that postdocs in the
"affiliate" category and the faculty
principal investigators who pay their
salaries out of grants and contracts are

both adversely affected by these deduc
tions. Needless to say, I decided to
begin them only very reluctantly and
after consulting extensively with tax
experts; there simply was no alterna
tive.
Since the subject is extremely com
plex, the article does contain some
misinformation and I would like to
make two corrections. First, these
deductions and an associated increase
in the minimum salary that postdoc
affiliates must be paid are the only
new developments — there are no
other changes in their conditions of
service. Second, the University's
matching contribution of 7.65 percent
of each postdoc affiliate's salary is paid
out of the Staff Benefits Pool which is
built up out of a "tax" on the salaries
of all University employees, not just
the salaries paid by science and
engineering departments. It is unfor

tunate that we must add this
drain on the benefits pool, but the cost
is spread out across the University.
