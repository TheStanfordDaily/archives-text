# A new perspective on postdoc workers
## 
### 
In its article on post-doctoral
salaries, The Daily explains that the
IRS will no longer permit Stanford to
classify postdocs as students. This
article implies that this is a bit of "bad
news" which has somehow been
imposed on Stanford by the govern
ment and that it may result in the
University employing fewer post-doc
toral workers in the future.
From our perspective as postdoc
toral workers at Stanford, we feel that

the article omitted a number of key
facts relevant to the post-doctoral
experience:
• Stanford is rather unusual in classi
fying its post-doctoral workers as stu
dents. Most other American and Euro
pean universities do not do this.
• Many post-doctoral fellows, who are
well into their 30s, see themselves as
highly educated professionals and con
sequently regard their student status
(and the associated dummy tuition) as
a rather demeaning classification.
• There is currently a nationwide over
supply of post-doctoral workers and a
shortage of faculty positions. Conse
quently, it is not an altogether bad
thing to reduce the number of post
docs. This is especially true from the
perspective of the young scientist
struggling to get a first appointment.
