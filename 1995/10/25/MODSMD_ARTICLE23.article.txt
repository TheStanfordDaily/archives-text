## Jerry knows best—the return of the squirrel 
### 
"I don't think it'd be that bad to be a squir
rel. Sure, you'd smell kinda like chowder
and never get to eat a fresh donut but, hey,
you could climb stucco."
— Ari Newberger
So I'm sitting in front of my Power
book working on an idea for a column
— it was a jaunty piece about how
ironic it is that once you finally find some
one you like and who likes you and you're
actually sated emotionally so that, perhaps
for the first time in a long time, you find
that you just don't want anyone else, that's
when everyone you know starts to want
you, but the only way to actually get to that
point where you have someone special is to
pretend that you don't really think they're
very special in the first place — when I hear
a high and squeaky voice from my window.
"That's so old," it said. It startled me.
I turned around to see that there, hang
ing by a small paw above my window, was
•Jerry the Squirrel. He came back.
Perhaps you don't remember the tra
vails of dear Jerry the Squirrel —- Jerry, the
horndog of a rodent who spent the better
part of last spring perched outside my
third-floor Kimball window sill hootin' and
hollerin' in his throaty, libidinous way,
waiting for True Love to shimmy up the
drain pipe mid into his life; Jerry, the mot
tled fuzzball torn between the pursuit of
"The One" and the quick fix of a spring out
let for that primal turgid pressure building
up in his epididymus; Jerry, the furry
would-be lover who, as a result, was so
pumped full of frustration and lifegoo that
I once actually caught him trying to make it
with my bike seat.
Well the bonkhound came back

climbed the stucco to my single just to read
over my shoulder and say, "That's really
old. Now you gonna eat that cookie?"
Mind you, I'd never heard Jerry speak
before. His communication was always lim
ited to those horrendous nasal wheezes
that apparently turn squirrelgirls to Jell-O.
So who was I to refuse? I handed him a
Nilla Wafer from the box on my desk and
pulled one out for myself.
"Well I think it's a fine subject," I said.
"You know, the self-defeating necessity of
out-thinking the one(s) you want."
"I'm not saying it's a bad subject," he
answered, "I'm just saying it's old. Can I
have another cookie?"
I gave him a small handful. "But it's
unexplored territory — no one ever chal
lenges the silliness of the inverse propor
tion between exhibited affection and even
tual attainment."
"Which is all fine and good and shows off
your vocabulary, but it doesn't change the
fact that you're wrong."
I have to say, I was a little insulted that
he said that. I hadn't seen him in so long
and I'd just given him cookies from my pri
vate stash. "What do you know," I said,
"you don't even have opposable thumbs.
You ain't even masturbate!"
Which is when Jerry gave me the news.
"I don't have to anymore," he gloated.
The implications of his remark were
monumental. "You're kidding Jerry. She
finally showed? You found Her I"
Jerry dropped from my window to my
couch and then leapt fantastically onto my
desk. "Who Her?" he asked casuidly.
"Her her — the one, or rather, 'The
One.' The Her you were waiting for up on
my ledge all last spring. The Her you were

honking for and passing up all those spring
time-scramble quickies with all those squir
rel hotties for. The long-term quick fix for
your heart and your wiener Her\"
"Oh yeah," he said, smiling. "I was
kinda into that then."
Now it's hard to tell when a squirrel is
being ironic; I may have raised my voice.
"What do'mean? You don't believe in all
that true love, destiny, other-shard-of-my
being crap anymore?" He shrugged. "Are
you kidding?! Jerry, you were so intent on
finding the right one that you threatened to
play 'Deliverance' with my nose while I
slept if I didn't help you find Her!" Another
shrrug. "Oh, come on Jerry, you were my
bastion! What happened?"
"Nothing happened per se. It's just I—"
"What? You got religious or something."
"No, it's nothing like that. It's just I got
tired of waiting. I know, I know — I'm sup
posed to be an idealist and idealists are sup
posed, if not obliged, to have infinite
patience. But you know what? Patience up
against orgasm doesn't hold so well."
"So you awed in on the scam, huh?"
He nodded no and sighed and looked up
at me. He began: "Okay, here's what hap
pened. I finished out spring on the ledge
with not a sign of Her. Then all you guys up
and left, so I had little to do but hang out
there through summer and hope she
turned up before my sperm count came
back down. It was hot but I stayed. My feet
burned on the cement but I held my gaze so
as not to miss Her should she hop on past.
My mouth was parched but I kept calling
and calling and I stood my post in the name
of a celestial Love.
"But she never showed. I'd done every
thing possible. I promenaded, I paraded, I

swooned, I wrote poetry. But she never
showed. That hurt. So, one day, desponden
cy finally took hold of my reason and I sup
pose I finally gave up. But the funny thing
was, that was when everything changed."
"Changed?"
"Yeah, because as soon as I gave in, as
soon as I felt the resignation sweep over
me, taking all my plans with it, as soon as I
finished listening to my Peter Gabriel
albums for the last time, closing my eyes
tight and praying for that perfect Meg Ryan
kinda 10ve... that's when I met Maggie."
"Maggie? Who's this Maggie chick?"
His glassy, black-jelly-bean eyes got
glassier. "Oh, she's great. She's got these
awfully big brown eyes and she's smart as
all hell. I don't feel dumb holding her paw
and sometimes, when she smiles, I get this
odd sensation in my stomach — like I'm
about to throw up or fart or something."
"So she's 'The One' then, right?"
"Not especially. At least I don't think so
— she's really moody."
"I don't think I get it Jerry."
"Me neither really. I'd always figured I'd
know the minute I met the Her. But Mag
gie, we just kinda met and became friends
mid one day we just started kissing. And
nothing about it felt wrong or bad or any
thing. Actually, it felt neat. I like her a lot."
"But you don't True Love her."
"I'm not sure if I believe in or know what
True Ixwe is Michael."
"I'm sorry."
"Don't be — I'm not."
Now this was all a good deal to take in.
The one true believer in 'The One,' the sex
ually stoic monogamonger I'd trusted had
turned on me. But there was little in what
he said that I could disagree with.

"How d'ya feel about all this?" I asked.
"Actually, I think a lot more clearly now.
Only I don't have all the answers I used to.
The certainty just ain't the same, you know
what I mean?"
"Not really, I still like to think that the
answers are always attainable."
"Just one in a long list of reasons why
you're an idiot."
"Are ail squirrels this belligerent once
they start gettin' some?"
"You're just jealous."
"I'm not jealous. But I'm not sure that
I'm not disappointed here either."
He shook his head. "You confused me
there with the double negatives. But never
mind. I've gotta get going."
"Well, it was good to see you Jerry. And
I'm glad you've found someone. Even if
she's not perfect."
"Me too."
"Tell Maggie I said hi then."
"I will. She even knows who you are —
we made a nest out of old Dailys and she
pees on your picture regularly."
"Sounds like a sweetheart."
"She is," Jerry said, and jumped from
my desk back to the window frame. "Oh,
one last thing." He was smiling again. "I
could always masturbate just fine. What do
think all that gunk in your underwear
drawer was last year?"
"I thought my shampoo leaked."
"Idiot."
And he left. I watched him climb and
jump and scurry away until his poofbail tail
blended in with the browning leaves of a dis
tant tree. And I wondered if that's just it, if
we're really lucky, one day, we just blend in.
And I hoped out loud that's not the case.
