## 'I wanted to lead one more intellectual life' Father of the Pill talks fiction 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
Oct. 15, 1951: Mexico City. A small
group of chemists at the pharmaceuti
cal company Syntex succeed in synthe
sizing the world's first steroidal oral
contraceptive — known worldwide
today as the Pill.
Leading the team was 28-year-old
Dr. Carl Djerassi, a bright young
organic chemist who had recently been
hired by Syntex as associate director of
chemical research.
Oct. 18, 1995: Stanford. Forty-four
years later, scientist-author Djerassi
recounts his more recent job descrip
tion as a fiction writer — "without a
question, [at this time] the most
important writing in my life," he
mused, as he discussed the roles of sci
ence and writing which characterize
his current dual persona.
First, the scientist: Djerassi's record
of professional achievement is filled with
awards and recognition. He holds a
dozen honorary doctorates and has
earned numerous scholastic awards,
including the National Medal of Science,
the highest scientific honor awarded by
the U.S. government.
His scientific contributions to birth
control research have not been limited
to humans, however. He and others
founded the company Zoecon, dedicat
ed to developing less toxic biological
methods of insect control.
They applied "Pill-like" logic to
develop technically distinct — but the
matically similar — birth control for
our invertebrate cousins. This less
toxic alternative to pesticides earned
him the U.S. National Medal of Tech
nology in 1991.
On to Djerassi's author-ego. One of

Djerassi's true missions is teaching —
though not necessarily through con
ventional means. This is clearly illus
trated through a variety of "pedagogic
experiments" described in one chapter
— Condoms for the Teacher — of his
1992 autobiography entitled "The Pill,
Pygmy Chimps and Degas' Horse".
For the last decade or so, Djerassi
has committed an ever-growing per
centage of his time to writing, in an
effort to educate a largely scientifically
illiterate public.
As a means to that end, Djerassi has
coined his writing style "science in fic
tion." This is in notable contrast, he
said, to science fiction.
Asked what drew him to write fic
tion and poetry — he has also authored
a book of poems titled "The Clock Runs
Backward" — Djerassi said that about
10 years ago, a brief bout with cancer
forced him "to come to terms with [his]
own mortality." He then continued, "I
wanted to lead one more intellectual
life."
Djerassi's view is that scientists
hold an important responsibility to
"bridge the gulf' between themselves
and their less-technical peers. But,
many scientific articles and lectures
usually end up catering to those who
sought the knowledge in the first place.
Instead, Djerassi seeks to reach the
scientifically uninformed through a
much less conventional — and perhaps
more insidious — approach: fiction.
His "science in fiction" tackles both
"hard" and "soft" science, metaphors
he often invokes to describe "hard" sci
entific principles and "soft" sociologi
cal issues relating to the everyday con
duct of science.
In fact, his books have earned the
status of "required reading" in various

classes at college campuses nationwide,
including Stanford. In addition to
Djerassi's autobiography, his literary
works to date include "Cantor's Dilem
ma" and"The Bourbaki Gambit," the
first two books in a tetrology-in
progress.
According to Djerassi, the first two
volumes encroach upon "gray areas" of
science, involving trust, ambition and
notoriety. These are just a few of the
dilemmas inherent in the pursuit of
science by humans, the class of beings
to which all scientists belong.
The next two books of the tetrology,
"Menachem's Seed" and "NO", deal
more directly with Djerassi's persis
tence towards advancing research in
the field of male contraception.
In these two works, Djerassi addresses
issues of male reproductive biology —
male infertility, recent advances in
assisted reproduction research and
impotence. NO stands for nitric oxide,
the neurotransmitter responsible for
penile erection.
A faculty member in chemistry at
Stanford since 1960, Djerassi partic
ipates in teaching courses in the
human biology and feminist studies
programs. So when does he find time to
write?
"I should really be called an English
fiction writer," Djerassi said, referring
to the fact that he does all of his fiction
writing in a London flat that he and his
wife, English Prof. Diane Middlebrook,
occupy three to four months of the
year. Djerassi commented that he rel
ishes this time to be a "faculty hus
band."
It is there that he turns science into
fiction — a true test of alchemy, which
might be the best word to describe all
of Djerassi's many intellectual lives.

to humans, however. He and others
founded the company Zoecon, dedicat
ed to developing less toxic biological
methods of insect control.
They applied "Pill-like" logic to
develop technically distinct — but the
matically similar — birth control for
our invertebrate cousins. This less
toxic alternative to pesticides earned
him the U.S. National Medal of Tech
nology in 1991.
On to Djerassi's author-ego. One of

Djerassi's true missions is teaching —
though not necessarily through con
ventional means. This is clearly illus
trated through a variety of "pedagogic
experiments" described in one chapter
— Condoms for the Teacher — of his
1992 autobiography entitled "The Pill,
Pygmy Chimps and Degas' Horse".
For the last decade or so, Djerassi
has committed an ever-growing per
centage of his time to writing, in an
effort to educate a largely scientifically
illiterate public.
As a means to that end, Djerassi has
coined his writing style "science in fic
tion." This is in notable contrast, he
said, to science fiction.
Asked what drew him to write fic
tion and poetry — he has also authored
a book of poems titled "The Clock Runs
Backward" — Djerassi said that about
10 years ago, a brief bout with cancer
forced him "to come to terms with [his]
own mortality." He then continued, "I
wanted to lead one more intellectual
life."
Djerassi's view is that scientists
hold an important responsibility to
"bridge the gulf' between themselves
and their less-technical peers. But,
many scientific articles and lectures
usually end up catering to those who
sought the knowledge in the first place.
Instead, Djerassi seeks to reach the
scientifically uninformed through a
much less conventional — and perhaps
more insidious — approach: fiction.
His "science in fiction" tackles both
"hard" and "soft" science, metaphors
he often invokes to describe "hard" sci
entific principles and "soft" sociologi
cal issues relating to the everyday con
duct of science.
In fact, his books have earned the
status of "required reading" in various

classes at college campuses nationwide,
including Stanford. In addition to
Djerassi's autobiography, his literary
works to date include "Cantor's Dilem
ma" and"The Bourbaki Gambit," the
first two books in a tetrology-in
progress.
According to Djerassi, the first two
volumes encroach upon "gray areas" of
science, involving trust, ambition and
notoriety. These are just a few of the
dilemmas inherent in the pursuit of
science by humans, the class of beings
to which all scientists belong.
The next two books of the tetrology,
"Menachem's Seed" and "NO", deal
more directly with Djerassi's persis
tence towards advancing research in
the field of male contraception.
In these two works, Djerassi addresses
issues of male reproductive biology —
male infertility, recent advances in
assisted reproduction research and
impotence. NO stands for nitric oxide,
the neurotransmitter responsible for
penile erection.
A faculty member in chemistry at
Stanford since 1960, Djerassi partic
ipates in teaching courses in the
human biology and feminist studies
programs. So when does he find time to
write?
"I should really be called an English
fiction writer," Djerassi said, referring
to the fact that he does all of his fiction
writing in a London flat that he and his
wife, English Prof. Diane Middlebrook,
occupy three to four months of the
year. Djerassi commented that he rel
ishes this time to be a "faculty hus
band."
It is there that he turns science into
fiction — a true test of alchemy, which
might be the best word to describe all
of Djerassi's many intellectual lives.
