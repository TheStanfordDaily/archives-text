Q Exactly how do vend
ming machines know
• that / want a Coke?
A Wonder how those
• vending machines
• work? Well, so do I. I
mean, isn't it really neat how
you put in your money, press a
few buttons, and voila! — out
comes your candy bar,
microwavable popcorn or inedi
ble box of lard-bites.

You are probably betting that
the first vending machine was
invented maybe a hundred years
ago — or less. Wrong you are.
The Biig's investigations have
turned up evidence that the
ancient Greeks had a vending
machine that dispensed holy
water in a temple in Egypt
around 215 B.C.
The modern vending machine
comes in many shapes and sizes
and it is difficult — even for the
Bug — to say exactly who invent
ed what. For example, in the
1850s, an Englishman named
Denham created a vending
machine for postage stamps,
which although not veir useful
for dispensing coffee, did at least
advance vending machine tech
nology.
One thing that most vending
machines share is the basic mech
anism of operation. First, all
vending machines have a lock
that keeps them from working
unless money is inserted. Once
the appropriate amount of money

is put in, the lock is removed.
When the first modern vend
ing machines came on the scene,
they dispensed chewing gum in
New York train stations. The lock
was a small metal bar that was
automatically removed when
your money hit the trigger. This
meant that you had to have exact
change, and furthermore, could
use only one coin. In other words,
the gum couldn't cost $0.18, since
there was no 18-cent coin.
Now of course, we have digital
vending machines that can keep
track of how much each item in a
vending machine costs, accept
paper money and even dispense
correct change. In present day
vending machines, the little
metal bar has been replaced by a
digital code that makes sure you
don't get anything that you don't
pay for.
Once the machine recognizes
that you have put in enough
money to get what you want, it
turns some gears and cranks and
out comes your gum or soda. In
modern food vending machines,
the mechanism is fairly simple —
a spiral screw-like thing that
holds all the chips and stufT, spins
around and spits out the food.
The spiral only turns around
once, preventingyou from getting
more than one hag of chips.
The mechanism for soda
vending machines is a bit more
complicated. If you have ever
seen the inside of a Coke vending
machine when it was being
reloaded, you may have noticed
that the cans are all stacked up
bv flavor in tall columns. Each of
these columns can hold only a set
number of cans. When you press
the button for Mountain Dew for
example, a small latch, on which
the can rests, is released and the
can begins to fall. Since each can
rests individually on a latch, only
one can comes out at a time.
After it has fallen a certain dis
tance, it hits a sort of incline
plane that rolls the can to the lit
tle slot in the middle. So, the clos
er to the middle the drink is
placed, the sooner it comes out.
This is why less popular drinks
take much longer to come out
than favorites.
Now for us Bugs who don't
particularly like vending
machines: Vending machines,
which bring in about $16 billion
a year in business, are here to
stay. However, we can take
some enjoyment out of the fact
that we may never again see
entire vending machine restau
rants — the last of those, on
42nd St.in Manhattan, closed a
couple of years ago, overshad
owed bv the fast food industry.
