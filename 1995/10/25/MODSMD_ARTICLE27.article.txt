# From Kazan, with love for the children
## Team at Med Center delivers hope and technology to Russia 
### Nancy Farghalli Contributing writer 
A young Russian boy, aged 10
months and suffering from con
genital heart disease, lived from
one moment to the next with stark
hope of survival. He, like so many
other children in Russia, faced the
brunt of the lack of medical tech
nology and services available to
them. In a country, scarred by
years of oppression, medical ser
vices still remain limited.
But the boy's chance came in
March, with the arrival of a group
from the Stanford Medical Center.
For two weeks in August, the
Stanford team performed magic in
Kazan, a city 450 miles southeast
of Moscow located on the banks of
the Volga River. With their seven
tons of equipment, they embarked
on a humanitarian mission to
operate on children who suffered
from congenital heart problems.
Nineteen children, ranging from
the ages of five months to 11 years,
all had corrective heart surgery
performed on them.
Dr. Bruce Reitz, chair of cardio
thoracic surgery, led a group of 21
Stanford surgeons, cardiologists,
pump technicians, nurses and ICU
specialists to Russia to perform
cardiac procedures, including
surgery, on children. Joining the
team were five individuals from a
Russian foundation based in Los
Angeles, who covered all trans
portation costs.
"The people who went were
chosen by volunteer and by draft.
There were certain jobs [for which]
we had an excess numbers of vol
unteers. We had to make some
choices based on the people we
thought would be best for this trip.
In other areas, there were only one
or two possibilities and fortunately
they agreed to come. Most people,
when they heard about this trip,
were extremely interested in com
ing," Reitz said.
The trip to Kazan marked the
first time in Stanford history that
a cardiac team has provided care in
another nation. In the past, other
groups from Stanford — in the
fields of plastic suigeiy and ortho
pedics — have traveled to other
regions of the world.
"I had always thought that it
would be impossible [to send a car
diac team overseasl due to the
number of people required, plus all
the equipment. What made it pos
sible here was that the organizer at
Stanford — Jodi Akin — was a car
diologist research nurse, who has
had experience organizing other
trips to Russia with Oakland Chil
dren's Hospital," Reitz said.
Akin organized the trip from
the ground up. Her past two trips
to St. Petersburg also involved car
diac care. In stark comparison to
the first trip five years ago, St.
Petersburg now boasts a full
fledged, highly successful cardiac

surgery program.
The idea for a trip to Kazan
originated with the pleas of a Rus
sian couple, formerly living in
America, whose child suffered
from a heart condition. The cou
ple, through a mutual friend, con
tacted Akin due to her past experi
ences and successes.
"I agreed only if I could take
Stanford. This research center
possesses the highest level stature
for an institution. My vision was
always to take top notch profes
sionals with progressive and inno
vative practices," remarked Akin.
"If you're going to do an
international mission like this one,
you just don't want to bring them
[foreign doctors] 10 years ahead if
they are 30 years behind. You want
to bring them into the future,
together with your medical prac
tices. And that was my theory
behind taking Stanford."
With this belief firmly embed
ded in her mind, Akin accompa
nied Reitz on a scouting expedition
to Kazan last March. The trip,
which lasted a week, involved
screening over 60 children for pos
sible surgery. Many children suf
fered from conditions that were
deemed inoperable. Sadly, if these
children had had corrective
surgery earlier in life, their situa
tion would be drastically different.

The hospital in Kazan where
the operations were performed
suffered from the bleak condition
of having limited technology. "In
that region, there exists only one
hospital which practices cardiac
surgery for five million people. The
cases of surgery were limited and

'We tried to show
them that success
ful surgery is not
dependent on mere
equipment and
technology.'
— Dr. Bruce Reitz

the technology looked 40 years
old," added Reitz.
"The hospital in Kazan is very
behind in medical technology.
They previously had not operated
on children under 40 pounds
which means that three-fourths of
the children died before they had
surgery," he continued.
In the two weeks the Stanford
surgeons were there, 19 operations
took place. Each surgery was open
to Russian doctors, who learned
about the new procedures by

scrubbing in and asking questions.
The use of an interpreter helped
overcome the language barrier
between the Stanford team and
the Kazan medics. Beyond the sur
gical knowledge that the Stanford
team disseminated to their Rus
sian counterparts, they also left
seven tons of medical equipment.
The operation success rate sur
passed the dreams of all involved
in the program. Besides the surg
eries, a cardiologist from Stanford
also held a clinic and screened an
additional 100 children. "We have
identified another 50 children who
should have surgery. We are hop
ing that the Kazan team — with
the equipment that we brought
plus the experience of working
with us for a couple of weeks —
will be able to help those kids,"
Reitz added.
The team from Stanford has
plans to return to Kazan to help
continue building an intensive car
diac treatment center.
Reitz said he hopes that what
he gained from the trip will also
influence doctors in that area. "We
tried to adapt with less expecta
tions and scale down our practices
with a minimalist approach that
would fit in. We tried to show them
that successful surgery is not
dependent on mere equipment and
technology," he said.

thought would be best for this trip.
In other areas, there were only one
or two possibilities and fortunately
they agreed to come. Most people,
when they heard about this trip,
were extremely interested in com
ing," Reitz said.
The trip to Kazan marked the
first time in Stanford history that
a cardiac team has provided care in
another nation. In the past, other
groups from Stanford — in the
fields of plastic suigeiy and ortho
pedics — have traveled to other
regions of the world.
"I had always thought that it
would be impossible [to send a car
diac team overseasl due to the
number of people required, plus all
the equipment. What made it pos
sible here was that the organizer at
Stanford — Jodi Akin — was a car
diologist research nurse, who has
had experience organizing other
trips to Russia with Oakland Chil
dren's Hospital," Reitz said.
Akin organized the trip from
the ground up. Her past two trips
to St. Petersburg also involved car
diac care. In stark comparison to
the first trip five years ago, St.
Petersburg now boasts a full
fledged, highly successful cardiac

surgery program.
The idea for a trip to Kazan
originated with the pleas of a Rus
sian couple, formerly living in
America, whose child suffered
from a heart condition. The cou
ple, through a mutual friend, con
tacted Akin due to her past experi
ences and successes.
"I agreed only if I could take
Stanford. This research center
possesses the highest level stature
for an institution. My vision was
always to take top notch profes
sionals with progressive and inno
vative practices," remarked Akin.
"If you're going to do an
international mission like this one,
you just don't want to bring them
[foreign doctors] 10 years ahead if
they are 30 years behind. You want
to bring them into the future,
together with your medical prac
tices. And that was my theory
behind taking Stanford."
With this belief firmly embed
ded in her mind, Akin accompa
nied Reitz on a scouting expedition
to Kazan last March. The trip,
which lasted a week, involved
screening over 60 children for pos
sible surgery. Many children suf
fered from conditions that were
deemed inoperable. Sadly, if these
children had had corrective
surgery earlier in life, their situa
tion would be drastically different.

The hospital in Kazan where
the operations were performed
suffered from the bleak condition
of having limited technology. "In
that region, there exists only one
hospital which practices cardiac
surgery for five million people. The
cases of surgery were limited and

'We tried to show
them that success
ful surgery is not
dependent on mere
equipment and
technology.'

the technology looked 40 years
old," added Reitz.
"The hospital in Kazan is very
behind in medical technology.
They previously had not operated
on children under 40 pounds
which means that three-fourths of
the children died before they had
surgery," he continued.
In the two weeks the Stanford
surgeons were there, 19 operations
took place. Each surgery was open
to Russian doctors, who learned
about the new procedures by

scrubbing in and asking questions.
The use of an interpreter helped
overcome the language barrier
between the Stanford team and
the Kazan medics. Beyond the sur
gical knowledge that the Stanford
team disseminated to their Rus
sian counterparts, they also left
seven tons of medical equipment.
The operation success rate sur
passed the dreams of all involved
in the program. Besides the surg
eries, a cardiologist from Stanford
also held a clinic and screened an
additional 100 children. "We have
identified another 50 children who
should have surgery. We are hop
ing that the Kazan team — with
the equipment that we brought
plus the experience of working
with us for a couple of weeks —
will be able to help those kids,"
Reitz added.
The team from Stanford has
plans to return to Kazan to help
continue building an intensive car
diac treatment center.
Reitz said he hopes that what
he gained from the trip will also
influence doctors in that area. "We
tried to adapt with less expecta
tions and scale down our practices
with a minimalist approach that
would fit in. We tried to show them
that successful surgery is not
dependent on mere equipment and
technology," he said.

The children of Kazan and their parents await a team from the Medical Center. Stanford professors
brought advanced cardiac technology to Russia this past summer.
A young Russian boy, aged 10
months and suffering from con
genital heart disease, lived from
one moment to the next with stark
hope of survival. He, like so many
other children in Russia, faced the
brunt of the lack of medical tech
nology and services available to
them. In a country, scarred by
years of oppression, medical ser
vices still remain limited.
But the boy's chance came in
March, with the arrival of a group
from the Stanford Medical Center.
For two weeks in August, the
Stanford team performed magic in
Kazan, a city 450 miles southeast
of Moscow located on the banks of
the Volga River. With their seven
tons of equipment, they embarked
on a humanitarian mission to
operate on children who suffered
from congenital heart problems.
Nineteen children, ranging from
the ages of five months to 11 years,
all had corrective heart surgery
performed on them.
Dr. Bruce Reitz, chair of cardio
thoracic surgery, led a group of 21
Stanford surgeons, cardiologists,
pump technicians, nurses and ICU
specialists to Russia to perform
cardiac procedures, including
surgery, on children. Joining the
team were five individuals from a
Russian foundation based in Los
Angeles, who covered all trans
portation costs.
"The people who went were
chosen by volunteer and by draft.
There were certain jobs [for which]
we had an excess numbers of vol
unteers. We had to make some
choices based on the people we
thought would be best for this trip.
In other areas, there were only one
or two possibilities and fortunately
they agreed to come. Most people,
when they heard about this trip,

ing," Reitz said.
