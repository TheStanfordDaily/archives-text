# Students to test wireless network
## GSB and Law School solicit volunteers for new Internet technology 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Student volunteers at the Uw School and the
Graduate School of Business will soon have the
opportunity to test out a new wireless network tech
nology which will allow them to hook up to the Inter
net from anywhere on campus.
In conjunction with Communication Services and
Metricom Inc., the two graduate schools will partici
pate in a trial run to test the viability of the new tech
nology, called Ricochet. With wireless networking, stu
dents will be able to hook modems to their Laptops and
use SUNet resources while lying outside in the sun.
According to Communication Services Director
Jan Thomson, Stanford has been working closely
with the Ixjs Gatos-based Metricom Inc. for the past
two years.
Regarding the time of the widespread launch of
the technology, Thomson said Metricom has
"learned a lot."
"They'll be close to rolling out the technology in a
couple months," she said. "The University is anxious
to get this system working well before letting it open
to the public."
"This is a private start-up company which is very
interested in forming a wireless data community,"
Thomson said, adding that the trial run will come at
no cost to the University.

"[Metricom] has spent a lot of time and money on
this technology," she said. "Stanford poses a
formidable challenge for them because of its size and
landscape."
Metricom approached the two graduate schools
because the small and concentrated student popula
tions posed ideal groups for the test trial.
In addition, the Law School implemented a new
policy this year requiring first-year students to own
a computer. This requirement gave Metricom a
"good, well-defined population" to target for the
trial, said Joan Galle, systems manager at the Law
School. "It's a fairly small population," she added.
Timothy Wei, assistant dean for Information
Resources at the Business School, said between six
and 12 student volunteers are being solicited to test
out the technology.
"We'd be very happy to have a handful of volun
teers involved," he said. "The trial period will last
around 30 days, which should give students enough
time to test it out."
According to Thomson, Metricom is providing the
wireless modems, which have a speed of between 9.6
and 14.4 kilobits per second, to the students. "Even
tually, we will be getting up to 19.6 (kilobits per sec
ond)," she added.
In addition to Stanford, Metricom is in contact
with 12 other schools "at one level or another," said
Thomson.
