# New program in biomedical ethics
## $950,000 grant will fund inquiry into ethical issues in genetic research 
### Adam Kemezis 
The Center for Biomedical Ethics recently re
ceived a $950,000 grant to establish a program to ex
plore issues of ethics in human genetic research.
The grant comes from SmithKline Beecham, a
London-based pharmaceutical corporation, and is in
tended to maintain the project for its first three
years. The new program will be called the Stanford
Program in Genomics, Ethics and Society (PGES).
Although it will be established under the auspices
of the Medical Center, the interdisciplinary program

will be controlled by a steering committee comprised
of faculty from the Schools of Humanities and Sci
ences, Law, Medicine and Business and the Institute
for International Studies. This steering committee's
membership will be identical to that of the existing
Center for Biomedical Ethics.
Barbara Koenig, executive director of the center,
said the committee would be expanded to include sev
eral prominent geneticists.
The program will not be an academic department
