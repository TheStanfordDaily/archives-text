# New program in biomedical ethics
## $950,000 grant will fund inquiry into ethical issues in genetic research 
### Adam Kemezis 
The Center for Biomedical Ethics recently re
ceived a $950,000 grant to establish a program to ex
plore issues of ethics in human genetic research.
The grant comes from SmithKline Beecham, a
London-based pharmaceutical corporation, and is in
tended to maintain the project for its first three
years. The new program will be called the Stanford
Program in Genomics, Ethics and Society (PGES).
Although it will be established under the auspices
of the Medical Center, the interdisciplinary program

will be controlled by a steering committee comprised
of faculty from the Schools of Humanities and Sci
ences, Law, Medicine and Business and the Institute
for International Studies. This steering committee's
membership will be identical to that of the existing
Center for Biomedical Ethics.
Barbara Koenig, executive director of the center,
said the committee would be expanded to include sev
eral prominent geneticists.
The program will not be an academic department
and will not itself offer courses.
Its most immediate function will
be to establish working groups
which will produce reports and
book-length white papers on ethi
cal issues in human genetics. The
money will be used in part to draw
visiting fellows and Stanford fac
ulty to the groups.
The first of these white papers,
Koenig said, will deal with genet
ic screening for susceptibility to
cancer and will be presented at an
international conference next
fall.
Henry Greeley, chair of the
steering committee, said he hopes
the program will stimulate Uni
versity-wide interest in the sub
ject, leading eventually to course
offerings in the area.
"I hope and expect that there
will be [courses] next year," he
said. Greeley already teaches a
course at the Law School entitled

"Advanced Issues in Health Law
and Policy" which deals with the
implications of genetic research.
"This is one of the most impor
tant questions in biomedical ethics
for the next 10 years," said
Thomas Raffin, co-director of the
center, who is looking for the
entire University to focus on these
issues.
Koenig also identified a practi
cal need for such a program in
a place as involved in genetic
research as Stanford. One long
term goal is to allow the Universi
ty to offer counseling to
researchers on the ethical impli
cations of their work.
The funding is scheduled to
last thn ugh the three-year start
up period. Koenig was optimistic
about further prospects for con
tinued funding from SmithKline
if the project continues success
fully. She also noted that the
funding was in the form of an
"unrestricted grant" and that the
program will be able to determine
its own objectives independent of
any donors.

Richard Koenig, communica
tions director at SmithKline,
called the project a "major initia
tive" for his company, which is in
a "leadership position in the tech
nology" of human genetics. He
said SmithKline has a responsibil
ity to ensure that the technology
of genetics does not grow faster
than the ethical understanding of
the science.
Stanford is an ideal place to
establish such a program, he
said, because it "has abundant
and varied resources from varied
disciplines." This includes the
federally funded Stanford
Human Genome Mapping Cen
ter, part of the Human Genome
Project, which aims to create a
chemical picture of the whole
genetic structure of a human
being.
He also echoed the long-term
optimism of Barbara Koenig, say
ing the idea of the grant was "to
get the project up and running. If
it is successful, we and others at
Stanford will consider ... an
extension."
