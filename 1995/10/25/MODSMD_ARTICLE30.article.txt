## Homefield blues hurting football 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
There has never been anoth
er season like this one.
In 1995, the Stanford foot
ball squad has accomplished its
4-2-1 record in unique fashion,
winning all its road games and
coming up winless at Stanford
Stadium. Sure, the 1986, 1951
and 1940 teams all won their
first four road games, but they
also enjoyed significant success
at home. Meanwhile, six Stan
ford squads have gone winless
in their first three home
games, but they won five road
games combined in those sea
sons.
So how has this year's squad
managed to join both select
groups — and go to both
extremes — in the same sea
son?
"I have no idea how to
answer that," said junior tight
end Greg Clark. "That's the
weirdest thing I've ever experi
enced."
While the trend might just
be a downright fluke, several
factors may have influenced
the bizarre developments. The
squad opened the season play
ing with renewed fire under
first-year coach Tyrone Will
ingham. Stanford almost cer
tainly would have taken a
home win if the Cardinal would
have had more than one oppor
tunity in the opening five
games. Ironically, the only
other team in school history to

open with four out of the first
five games on the road did the
opposite of the current squad,
dropping all the road contests
and coming away with wins at
home.
"We're trying to figure out
what it is," said senior kicker
Eric Abrams. "We don't play
with any less energy at home."
However, the crowd often
provides less energy at Stan
ford than elsewhere. While
Stanford drew 45,000-plus fans
for the two most recent con
tests against Washington and
UCIxA, which compares favor
ably with the under 37,000
spectators Stanford has attract
ed on average elsewhere, Stan
ford Stadium remains only half
full. The surrounding track
keeps fans far from Foster
Field, and the thought of play
ing before Cardinal fans
doesn't make opponents lose
sleep.
"It really thrills me seeing
that we're 4-0 on the road,"
said junior outside linebacker
Brian Batson. "But any time
you're 0-2-1 at home, it's a lit
tle humiliating. I can't explain
it. It's an absolute phe
nomenon."
In all, the football squad
hasn't given Stanford fans
much to cheer about the past
few seasons. In its most recent
home matchups with each of
the other nine conference
teams, Stanford has won just
two, and the 40-3 victory over
Washington State came in 1992.
Since the current crop of junior
students arrived in late Septem
ber 1993, the Cardinal has post
ed a 3-10-1 mark at home, its
worst 14-game home stretch
since 1959-1961.
Still, this year's squad poses
the strangest mystery. While Bill
Walsh's final two teams strug

gled on the road as well, Willing
ham and the Cardinal have got
ten over the hump on the road.
In fact, no other squad in Divi
sion I-A has a perfect record in at
least four road games. But only
three other I-A schools remain
winless in their friendly confines
Wake Forest (1-6), which lost
at home to Appalachian State,
Louisville (3-4), which has
played only two home games, and
Vanderbilt (0-6), the only winless
squad in Division I-A.
Stanford has faced a more
brutal schedule than most teams

at home, however. Washington
and UCLA are currently ranked
17th and 24th respectively, and
Wisconsin, the opponent Stan
ford tied on Sept. 16, dropped
out of the polls this week. With
the notable exception of Oregon,
Stanford's road opponents —
San Jose State, Utah and Ari
zona State — are suffering
through difficult seasons.
This weekend, the trend
changes. The Cardinal will face a
struggling squad at Stanford
Stadium. Oregon State (1-6)
started the season with a win in

Corvallis against Division I-AA
Idaho before playing like a team
in the midst of the silver
anniversary of its last winning
season, losing six straight,
including defeats at Pacific and
North Texas. The last time the
Beavers won at Stanford Stadi
um, John Ralston and the Indi
ans responded by not losing
another home game until 1970
— two years later.
This Stanford squad can start
a similar streak Saturday, or at
least begin to put the home-field
disadvantage in the past.

Thus far this season, the homefield crowd has produced results for Cardinal football that have been anything but divine.

sleep.
"It really thrills me seeing
that we're 4-0 on the road,"
said junior outside linebacker
Brian Batson. "But any time
you're 0-2-1 at home, it's a lit
tle humiliating. I can't explain
it. It's an absolute phe
nomenon."
In all, the football squad
hasn't given Stanford fans
much to cheer about the past
few seasons. In its most recent
home matchups with each of
the other nine conference
teams, Stanford has won just
two, and the 40-3 victory over
Washington State came in 1992.
Since the current crop of junior
students arrived in late Septem
ber 1993, the Cardinal has post
ed a 3-10-1 mark at home, its
worst 14-game home stretch
since 1959-1961.
Still, this year's squad poses
the strangest mystery. While Bill
Walsh's final two teams strug

gled on the road as well, Willing
ham and the Cardinal have got
ten over the hump on the road.
In fact, no other squad in Divi
sion I-A has a perfect record in at
least four road games. But only
three other I-A schools remain
winless in their friendly confines
Wake Forest (1-6), which lost
at home to Appalachian State,
Louisville (3-4), which has
played only two home games, and
Vanderbilt (0-6), the only winless
squad in Division I-A.
Stanford has faced a more
brutal schedule than most teams

at home, however. Washington
and UCLA are currently ranked
17th and 24th respectively, and
Wisconsin, the opponent Stan
ford tied on Sept. 16, dropped
out of the polls this week. With
the notable exception of Oregon,
Stanford's road opponents —
San Jose State, Utah and Ari
zona State — are suffering
through difficult seasons.
This weekend, the trend
changes. The Cardinal will face a
struggling squad at Stanford
Stadium. Oregon State (1-6)
started the season with a win in

Corvallis against Division I-AA
Idaho before playing like a team
in the midst of the silver
anniversary of its last winning
season, losing six straight,
including defeats at Pacific and
North Texas. The last time the
Beavers won at Stanford Stadi
um, John Ralston and the Indi
ans responded by not losing
another home game until 1970
— two years later.
This Stanford squad can start
a similar streak Saturday, or at
least begin to put the home-field
disadvantage in the past.

Thus far this season, the homefield crowd has produced results for Cardinal football that have been anything but divine.
