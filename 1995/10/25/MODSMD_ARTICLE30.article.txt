## Homefield blues hurting football 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
There has never been anoth
er season like this one.
In 1995, the Stanford foot
ball squad has accomplished its
4-2-1 record in unique fashion,
winning all its road games and
coming up winless at Stanford
Stadium. Sure, the 1986, 1951
and 1940 teams all won their
first four road games, but they
also enjoyed significant success
at home. Meanwhile, six Stan
ford squads have gone winless
in their first three home
games, but they won five road
games combined in those sea
sons.
So how has this year's squad
managed to join both select
groups — and go to both
extremes — in the same sea
son?
"I have no idea how to
answer that," said junior tight
end Greg Clark. "That's the
weirdest thing I've ever experi
enced."
While the trend might just
be a downright fluke, several
factors may have influenced
the bizarre developments. The
squad opened the season play
ing with renewed fire under
first-year coach Tyrone Will
ingham. Stanford almost cer
tainly would have taken a
home win if the Cardinal would
have had more than one oppor
tunity in the opening five
games. Ironically, the only
other team in school history to

open with four out of the first
five games on the road did the
opposite of the current squad,
dropping all the road contests
and coming away with wins at
home.
"We're trying to figure out
what it is," said senior kicker
Eric Abrams. "We don't play
with any less energy at home."
However, the crowd often
provides less energy at Stan
ford than elsewhere. While
Stanford drew 45,000-plus fans
for the two most recent con
tests against Washington and
UCIxA, which compares favor
ably with the under 37,000
spectators Stanford has attract
ed on average elsewhere, Stan
ford Stadium remains only half
full. The surrounding track
keeps fans far from Foster
Field, and the thought of play
ing before Cardinal fans
doesn't make opponents lose
sleep.
"It really thrills me seeing
that we're 4-0 on the road,"
said junior outside linebacker
Brian Batson. "But any time
you're 0-2-1 at home, it's a lit
tle humiliating. I can't explain
it. It's an absolute phe
nomenon."
In all, the football squad
hasn't given Stanford fans
much to cheer about the past
few seasons. In its most recent
home matchups with each of
the other nine conference
teams, Stanford has won just
