## Hockey wins trip to postseason Cardinal field hockey defeats Cal in tough 1-0 battle to take conference

Stanford field hockey (9-4 overall, 5-1
Northern Pacific Conference) will advance to
the NCAA playoffs along with 11 other teams
after defeating California (4-8, 4-2) 1-0 at
home yesterday in a double overtime nailbiter.
Sophomore goalkeeper Kelly Naylor kept
the ball out of the net just long enough for
senior Elise Morgan to emerge as the day's
heroine with her game-winning goal.
"It is so incredibly exciting to be going to
NCAAs," Morgan said.
The match began under the blazing sun with
enthusiastic crowds cheering for both sides. The
competitive and fierce game did not disappoint.
Although Stanford dominated and con
trolled the ball from the outset, both sides fin
ished the opening half scoreless. Intensity ran
high throughout the game, exemplified by
junior right back Amy Marfil's green card
penalty during a struggle with a defender late
in the first period.
In the second half, the Cardinal fired three
consecutive short corner attempts without
success. The Bears retaliated by driving the
ball down to Stanford's end but never pene
trated the circle for a long enough time to pose
a serious threat.
After the Cal offensive surge, Cardinal
right wing Carey Cloyd broke away for a shot
attempt that was saved by the Cal goalie. The
Bears responded with an attempt of their own
that Naylor scampered out of the box to kick
safely away.

Yesterday's field hockey heroine Elise Morgan works the ball downfield against Cal. Mor
gan's game-winning goal vaulted the Cardinal to a conference crown and playoff berth.
The game drew the largest
Stanford crowd yet, although Cal
brought a contingency of its own.
A Cal timeout with 20 minutes
left in the second period led to a
quick Bear offensive charge. Cal
brought the ball down and
camped on the Stanford half of
the field until a series of Bear
penalties allowed the Cardinal to
bring the ball back down for a
short corner.
Cal called another timeout
later and earned a penalty corner
shortly thereafter. But the Bears
bombed their attempt by whiffing
the ball. Stanford then brought
the ball right back for another
unsuccessful corner.
The Cal bench went wild as the

Bears got another attempt two
minutes later that was hit out of
bounds by Cloyd.
A great save by Naylor ended
the hot and heavy regulation play,
however. Both teams then found
themselves in a 15-minute sud
den death overtime situation
where they could only use seven
players on each side.
Stanford won the coin toss,
with Cloyd, freshman center for
ward Monique Leroux, freshman
left wing / left forward Sarah
Medeiros, center midfielder Mor
gan, senior sweeper Leah Jacobs
and freshman defender Stephanie
Finkelstein checking in for the
Cardinal.
Cal started by keeping the ball
on the Stanford end of the field for
most of overtime play. A close shot
was fouled, granting Cal a penalty
corner. But the steel-nerved Nay
lor successfully defended the

potential game-winner.
"It was definitely a very com
petitive game," Jacobs said. "The
team that [wantedl it harder
[was] going to win."
Jacobs injured her hand in
overtime, and Stanford showed
signs of tiring, chasing the ball
down with less fervor than it did
during regulation play. However,
frequent substitutions helped to
keep the players rested.
With fatigue setting in, Stan
ford mounted an offensive attack,
bringing the ball downfield for a
short corner that was cleared by
the Bears. In the following play,
Naylor kicked the ball into a Cal
player. Her action resulted in a
penalty corner for the Bears, but
the shot was rejected.
Despite the fact that suspen
sion of offsides penalties for over
time play generated more break
aways and goalie-on-player situa

tions, neither team could put the
ball in the net. Nay lor recorded
an impressive save against a Cal
breakaway, scrambling eight feet
away from the net to clear the
ball despite being tripped and
kicked in the head. That play
ended the scoreless overtime,
sending both teams into another
overtime.
With emotions high, Stanford
decided to end the game once and
for all. One minute, 50 seconds
into the second overtime, Stan
ford drew a penalty corner. Mor
gan, who played a stellar game
despite sporting a leg brace, hit
the ball into the circle. Leroux
stopped the ball and hit it off a
defender. Morgan recovered the
deflection and knocked it into the
goal to end the game.
"It was a great game," said
Stanford coach Sheryl Johnson.
"We fought to the very end."

breakaway, scrambling eight feet
away from the net to clear the
ball despite being tripped and
kicked in the head. That play
ended the scoreless overtime,
sending both teams into another
overtime.
With emotions high, Stanford
decided to end the game once and
for all. One minute, 50 seconds
into the second overtime, Stan
ford drew a penalty corner. Mor
gan, who played a stellar game
despite sporting a leg brace, hit
the ball into the circle. Leroux
stopped the ball and hit it off a
defender. Morgan recovered the
deflection and knocked it into the
goal to end the game.
"It was a great game," said
Stanford coach Sheryl Johnson.
"We fought to the very end."
