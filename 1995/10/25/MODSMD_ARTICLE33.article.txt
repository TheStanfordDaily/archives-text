Stanford field hockey (9-4 overall, 5-1
Northern Pacific Conference) will advance to
the NCAA playoffs along with 11 other teams
after defeating California (4-8, 4-2) 1-0 at
home yesterday in a double overtime nailbiter.
Sophomore goalkeeper Kelly Naylor kept
the ball out of the net just long enough for
senior Elise Morgan to emerge as the day's
heroine with her game-winning goal.
"It is so incredibly exciting to be going to
NCAAs," Morgan said.
The match began under the blazing sun with
enthusiastic crowds cheering for both sides. The
competitive and fierce game did not disappoint.
Although Stanford dominated and con
trolled the ball from the outset, both sides fin
ished the opening half scoreless. Intensity ran
high throughout the game, exemplified by
junior right back Amy Marfil's green card
penalty during a struggle with a defender late
in the first period.
In the second half, the Cardinal fired three
consecutive short corner attempts without
success. The Bears retaliated by driving the
ball down to Stanford's end but never pene
trated the circle for a long enough time to pose
a serious threat.
After the Cal offensive surge, Cardinal
right wing Carey Cloyd broke away for a shot
attempt that was saved by the Cal goalie. The
Bears responded with an attempt of their own
that Naylor scampered out of the box to kick
safely away.
