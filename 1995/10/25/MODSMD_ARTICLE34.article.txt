Stanford 1

The Stanford men's soccer team (4-10-1
overall, 1-4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) was not able to prevent the Univer
sity of San Francisco (7-6-1, 2-0 West Coast
Conference) from winning game No. 500 for
its head coach Stephen Negoesco at
Negoesco Stadium. The Dons edged the
Cardinal by a 2-1 score in overtime. The
night game was watched by close to 1,000
fans all cheering for USF and Negoesco.
Negoesco's illustrious record now stands
at 500-117-63 in his 34th season at USF,
the most by any collegiate soccer coach.
After last week's win over previously unde
feated Portland for victory No. 499,
Negoesco capitalized on his first opportuni
ty to reach the half millennium mark in
wins at the expense of Stanford.
The high-powered San Francisco offense
mustered one goal in regulation. The Dons'
Shane Watkins scored the goal on an assist
from Omar Lel-Fakiri. The score came five
minutes before halflime.
Stanford tied the game at the 71:40
mark. Sophomore Eric Vandevelde knocked
in his team leading fourth goal of the season
on an assist from senior co-captain Carmen
D'Onofrio. However The Dons' defense
stalled the Cardinal's momentum and the
game went into overtime.
The lightning quick Don offense could

only be contained, but not stopped. San
Francisco eventually won the game on a cor
ner kick by Watkins. Watkins lofled the ball
out into the box and Chris Bradley put it in
the goal.

Cardinal Mat Foley and his teammates
tried to catch up to the Dons all night
but just could not overtake them.
