# Bulls to get Finals airtime
## 
### 
The time has come. Major League
Baseball has reached the climax of its
season and will soon he over. The
excitement of the gridiron every weekend
has helped me pass the time until now. The
leaves, at least in most parts of the country,
are beginning to fall as a brisk wind begins
to pick up. As November creeps in slowly,
temperatures will dip, in most other parts of
the country, well below freezing. Transla
tion: The NBA season is upon us, and I just
wouldn't be myself if I didn't force my opin
ion onto all of you.
For the past two seasons, basketball fans
have been fortunate to witness the wonders
of Hakeem Olajuwon and the perseverance
of the two-time world champion Houston
Rockets. The good guys from the West
earned their first ring in defeating
guard / bricklayer John Starks and the
thuggish New York Knicks. Rudy Tomjon
avich and Co. doubled their pleasure last
season by sweeping the Orlando Magic,
David Stern's version of the New Kids on
the Block.
Yet something remains a bit perturbing
about the Rockets' rise to glory — some nat
ural event which they seemed to bypass or
circumvent.
In the '80s, the Lakers and Celtics bat
tled for supremacy every season. That rival
ry ended when the Bad Boys from Motown
burst onto the scene and brought the trophy
from L A. home to Detroit for two consecu

tive seasons. The Chicago Bulls ended that
streak emphatically with a sweep of the Pis
tons in the Eastern Conference Finals in
1991, only to begin a streak of their own.
It was then that the Rockets dethroned
His Airness. . . .

Oh, that's right. I almost forgot. That
never actually occurred now did it? A pre
mature retirement / career change left the
Bulls in a state of disarray, though Scottie
Pippen managed to take them to seven
games against the Knicks that season. Yet
most significantly, that Bulls' era of domi
nance ended as a result of the disappearance
of its foundation, not because of the talent
of their opponents.
This season, however, the matchup that
escaped and disrupted the natural patterns
of NBA dynasties will finally come to
fruition. Olajuwon will reign again in the


Courtney
Mann
West, while Michael Jordan, Pip
pen and a newfound "friend" rise
once again in the East.
Olajuwon proved last season
that no one, including an over
grown rap star, will stop him.
Barring unforeseen circum
stances from surgery, that trend
will continue despite the efforts of
Western Conference foes. Robert
Horry, who turned heads left and
right in last year's NBA Finals,
will also continue to blossom into
one of the league's most promis
ing youngsters.
Houston's return to the Finals,
like last year, will be no cakewalk.
Teams who consistently beat the
Rockets in the regular season last
year will be back and focused pri
marily on finding ways to throttle
the Rockets. Phoenix once again
has drafted well despite having
low first-round picks. Wisconsin's
Michael Finley and Arizona
State's Mario Bennett should pro
vide the Suns with two solid role
players off the bench. In an effort
to stop Olajuwon, the Suns also
picked up John "Hot Rod"
Williams in exchange for Dan
Majerle, finally acknowledging
that they would not win a cham
pionship with Joe Kleine at cen
ter. Danny Manning is also back
after recuperating from last sea
son's knee injury.
San Antonio will be eager to
get started with the departure of
their "problem child," and David
Robinson will be hungrier than
ever to prove that he can play
with Olajuwon in the postseason.
They filled the rebounding void
by signing free agent Carl Her
rera from Houston. Yet, the
Spurs still have a weak backcourt.
As for the Eastern Conference,
it will no doubt be a battle. The
Bulls and the Magic unveiled a
budding rivalry last season in the
playoffs, surrounded by the hype
of Jordan's return to the court.
Chicago and Orlando will jaw at
each other all season long this
time, but the Magic, though full
of talent, is still missing the
intangibles that separate champi
ons from contenders.
Clearly, the Bulls hold the
advantage in coaching. Brian Hill
couldn't coach the Clobetrotters
to victory against the Washington

Generals, much less outsmart the
genius of Phil Jackson. Without
Jackson, the Bulls would never
have traded their inflated egos for
three championship rings.
Nothing will be more essential
in the Bulls-Magic matchup than
defense. The Bulls roster boasts
two Defensive Players of the Year
in Jordan and Rodman and a
First Team All Defensive Player
in Pippen. On the other side, Nick
Anderson and Dennis Scott will
struggle to defend their own
shadows, much less the best play
er ever.
Former Bull Horace Grant sin
gle-handedly chewed up his ex
teammates in last season's series,
exploiting Chicago's gaping hole
at power forward. Well, the Bulls
not only went and found a decent
rebounder, they went and picked
up the best one ever. Talk about
execution. So Grant will have his
hands full, just as he did at the
beginning of his career when Rod
man gave young Horace bruises
all night long
The Indiana Pacers will also
put up some good competition in
the Eastern Conference, yet Reg
gie Miller is no longer the best
shooting guard in the league.
Besides, for the Pacers to go to
the Finals for the first time ever,
they would have to beat the Magic
and the Bulls in consecutive
series, a stunt they do not have
the personnel to pull off.
The only thing that may stop the
Bulls from heading to the Finals for
the fourth time in six years may be
themselves. Acquiring Rodman will
not come without its drawbacks
obviously, but if he stays focused,
Chicago could become one of the
most formidable teams in recent
history. Much talk has circulated
concerning the absence of commu
nication with Rodman mid the rest
of the teiim, yet the extent to which
these players are friends is vastly
overrated anyway. Epos as big as
theirs, with salaries as big as theirs,
simply do not coexist, Rodman or
no Rodman.
So the matchup finally comes.
The loss of Carl Herrera and Otis
Thorpe will eventually hurt the
Rockets, especially with Rodman
cleaning the glass. Clyde Drexler,
no longer driven to get the ring
which once eluded him, is getting
no younger and will have his
hands full with a Jordan who is in
the best shape of his life. Transla
tion: a ring for Michael's pinkie.

man gave young Horace bruises
all night long
The Indiana Pacers will also
put up some good competition in
the Eastern Conference, yet Reg
gie Miller is no longer the best
shooting guard in the league.
Besides, for the Pacers to go to
the Finals for the first time ever,
they would have to beat the Magic
and the Bulls in consecutive
series, a stunt they do not have
the personnel to pull off.
The only thing that may stop the
Bulls from heading to the Finals for
the fourth time in six years may be
themselves. Acquiring Rodman will
not come without its drawbacks
obviously, but if he stays focused,
Chicago could become one of the
most formidable teams in recent
history. Much talk has circulated
concerning the absence of commu
nication with Rodman mid the rest
of the teiim, yet the extent to which
these players are friends is vastly
overrated anyway. Epos as big as
theirs, with salaries as big as theirs,
simply do not coexist, Rodman or
no Rodman.
So the matchup finally comes.
The loss of Carl Herrera and Otis
Thorpe will eventually hurt the
Rockets, especially with Rodman
cleaning the glass. Clyde Drexler,
no longer driven to get the ring
which once eluded him, is getting
no younger and will have his
hands full with a Jordan who is in
the best shape of his life. Transla
tion: a ring for Michael's pinkie.
The time has come. Major League
Baseball has reached the climax of its
season and will soon he over. The
excitement of the gridiron every weekend
has helped me pass the time until now. The
leaves, at least in most parts of the country,
are beginning to fall as a brisk wind begins
to pick up. As November creeps in slowly,
temperatures will dip, in most other parts of
the country, well below freezing. Transla
tion: The NBA season is upon us, and I just
wouldn't be myself if I didn't force my opin
ion onto all of you.
For the past two seasons, basketball fans
have been fortunate to witness the wonders
of Hakeem Olajuwon and the perseverance
of the two-time world champion Houston
Rockets. The good guys from the West
earned their first ring in defeating
guard / bricklayer John Starks and the
thuggish New York Knicks. Rudy Tomjon
avich and Co. doubled their pleasure last
season by sweeping the Orlando Magic,
David Stern's version of the New Kids on
the Block.
Yet something remains a bit perturbing
about the Rockets' rise to glory — some nat
ural event which they seemed to bypass or
circumvent.
In the '80s, the Lakers and Celtics bat
tled for supremacy every season. That rival
ry ended when the Bad Boys from Motown
burst onto the scene and brought the trophy
from L A. home to Detroit for two consecu

tive seasons. The Chicago Bulls ended that
streak emphatically with a sweep of the Pis
tons in the Eastern Conference Finals in
1991, only to begin a streak of their own.
It was then that the Rockets dethroned
His Airness. . . .

Oh, that's right. I almost forgot. That
never actually occurred now did it? A pre
mature retirement / career change left the
Bulls in a state of disarray, though Scottie
Pippen managed to take them to seven
games against the Knicks that season. Yet
most significantly, that Bulls' era of domi
nance ended as a result of the disappearance
of its foundation, not because of the talent
of their opponents.
This season, however, the matchup that
escaped and disrupted the natural patterns
of NBA dynasties will finally come to
fruition. Olajuwon will reign again in the


Courtney
Mann
West, while Michael Jordan, Pip
pen and a newfound "friend" rise
once again in the East.
Olajuwon proved last season
that no one, including an over
grown rap star, will stop him.
Barring unforeseen circum
stances from surgery, that trend
will continue despite the efforts of
Western Conference foes. Robert
Horry, who turned heads left and
right in last year's NBA Finals,
will also continue to blossom into
one of the league's most promis
ing youngsters.
Houston's return to the Finals,
like last year, will be no cakewalk.
Teams who consistently beat the
Rockets in the regular season last
year will be back and focused pri
marily on finding ways to throttle
the Rockets. Phoenix once again
has drafted well despite having
low first-round picks. Wisconsin's
Michael Finley and Arizona
State's Mario Bennett should pro
vide the Suns with two solid role
players off the bench. In an effort
to stop Olajuwon, the Suns also
picked up John "Hot Rod"
Williams in exchange for Dan
Majerle, finally acknowledging
that they would not win a cham
pionship with Joe Kleine at cen
ter. Danny Manning is also back
after recuperating from last sea
son's knee injury.
San Antonio will be eager to
get started with the departure of
their "problem child," and David
Robinson will be hungrier than
ever to prove that he can play
with Olajuwon in the postseason.
They filled the rebounding void
by signing free agent Carl Her
rera from Houston. Yet, the
Spurs still have a weak backcourt.
As for the Eastern Conference,
it will no doubt be a battle. The
Bulls and the Magic unveiled a
budding rivalry last season in the
playoffs, surrounded by the hype
of Jordan's return to the court.
Chicago and Orlando will jaw at
each other all season long this
time, but the Magic, though full
of talent, is still missing the
intangibles that separate champi
ons from contenders.
Clearly, the Bulls hold the
advantage in coaching. Brian Hill
couldn't coach the Clobetrotters
to victory against the Washington

Generals, much less outsmart the
genius of Phil Jackson. Without
Jackson, the Bulls would never
have traded their inflated egos for
three championship rings.
Nothing will be more essential
in the Bulls-Magic matchup than
defense. The Bulls roster boasts
two Defensive Players of the Year
in Jordan and Rodman and a
First Team All Defensive Player
in Pippen. On the other side, Nick
Anderson and Dennis Scott will
struggle to defend their own
shadows, much less the best play
er ever.
Former Bull Horace Grant sin
gle-handedly chewed up his ex
teammates in last season's series,
exploiting Chicago's gaping hole
at power forward. Well, the Bulls
not only went and found a decent
rebounder, they went and picked
up the best one ever. Talk about
execution. So Grant will have his
hands full, just as he did at the
beginning of his career when Rod
man gave young Horace bruises
all night long
The Indiana Pacers will also
put up some good competition in
the Eastern Conference, yet Reg
