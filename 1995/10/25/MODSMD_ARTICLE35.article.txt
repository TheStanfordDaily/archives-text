# Bulls to get Finals airtime
## 
### 
The time has come. Major League
Baseball has reached the climax of its
season and will soon he over. The
excitement of the gridiron every weekend
has helped me pass the time until now. The
leaves, at least in most parts of the country,
are beginning to fall as a brisk wind begins
to pick up. As November creeps in slowly,
temperatures will dip, in most other parts of
the country, well below freezing. Transla
tion: The NBA season is upon us, and I just
wouldn't be myself if I didn't force my opin
ion onto all of you.
For the past two seasons, basketball fans
have been fortunate to witness the wonders
of Hakeem Olajuwon and the perseverance
of the two-time world champion Houston
Rockets. The good guys from the West
earned their first ring in defeating
guard / bricklayer John Starks and the
thuggish New York Knicks. Rudy Tomjon
avich and Co. doubled their pleasure last
season by sweeping the Orlando Magic,
David Stern's version of the New Kids on
the Block.
Yet something remains a bit perturbing
about the Rockets' rise to glory â€” some nat
ural event which they seemed to bypass or
circumvent.
In the '80s, the Lakers and Celtics bat
tled for supremacy every season. That rival
ry ended when the Bad Boys from Motown
burst onto the scene and brought the trophy
from L A. home to Detroit for two consecu

tive seasons. The Chicago Bulls ended that
streak emphatically with a sweep of the Pis
tons in the Eastern Conference Finals in
1991, only to begin a streak of their own.
It was then that the Rockets dethroned
His Airness. . . .

Oh, that's right. I almost forgot. That
never actually occurred now did it? A pre
mature retirement / career change left the
Bulls in a state of disarray, though Scottie
Pippen managed to take them to seven
games against the Knicks that season. Yet
most significantly, that Bulls' era of domi
nance ended as a result of the disappearance
of its foundation, not because of the talent
of their opponents.
This season, however, the matchup that
escaped and disrupted the natural patterns
of NBA dynasties will finally come to
fruition. Olajuwon will reign again in the
