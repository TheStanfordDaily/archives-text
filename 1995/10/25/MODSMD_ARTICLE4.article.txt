# Alcohol policy to face review
## Edmonds to put judical system, Greeks under scrutiny as well 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
In her fourth annual State of
Students Affairs address, Vice
Provost and Dean of Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds articulated
her three major goals for this acad
emic year, chief of which is the for
mation of a task force to review the
University's alcohol policy.
"There is a sense that no one un
derstands the policy," Edmonds
said. "The policy is very clear — as
is the criminal code — on alcohol
related conduct. What is not clear is
the set of procedures that allow the
policy to be implemented in a con
sistent manner and the delineation
of the role of those in positions to
make a difference.
"The procedures for specific sit
uations and areas of responsibility
and accountability must be clari
fied," she said.
Recent actions by Residential
Education have caused confusion
over resident assistants' role in im
plementing the alcohol policy.
Edmonds also called for two
other comprehensive reviews to be
conducted during the coming year:
one of the University's judicial sys
tem and the other of the Greek sys
tem.
"It has been many years since a
comprehensive review of the Greek

system has taken
place," she said.
"There are many
issues that should
be addressed."
Edmonds
added that the
dismantling or
elimination of the
Greek system is
not the goal of this
review.

"Repeatedly, 1 hear that the Uni
versity wishes to do away with the
Greek system," Edmonds said.
"This perception is widely heard
most often when it is necessary to
relieve a fraternity of its house for
cause. I have never sensed that per
ception to be the case.
"Greek organizations, when
they work well, bring a special vital
ity to a campus," she said. "It is
time to measure its health and see
how, together, we can make the sys
tem stronger."
In explaining the need for a re
view of the judicial system, Ed
monds noted that "the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968 has
been amended several times, but
there has not been a comprehensive
review in many years. Therefore we
shall begin a review process during
this academic year."


Edmonds
Edmonds spent a portion of her
address reflecting on the issues
surrounding the alcohol policy and
her soon-to-be-formed task force.
"To me, it is about being
healthy in body and mind," she
continued. "It is about airing for
yourself and for your peers. It is
about maintaining a healthy
lifestyle in order to make the most
out of the undergraduate, gradu
ate or professional educational
experience."
Edmonds spoke of three cate
gories of students who must be
most carefully considered when
discussing the alcohol policy: stu
dents who binge; students who
choose not to drink and do not
want to be around those who are;
and freshmen, "who are most vul
nerable to the establishment of
alcohol patterns during the first 12
weeks of their college experience."
Echoing sentiments expressed
by Dean of Students Marc Wais,
Edmonds called for "a reduction or
elimination of the perception held
by students that [administrators]
are against them."
That perception can be largely
eliminated, Edmonds said, "by
inclusion of more students in deci
sion-making and by open commu

nication on both sides.... I have
found that when students under
stand policies and procedures that
explain how decisions are made
and the rationale used in determin
ing the outcomes, they are less like
ly to be suspicious of our motives."
"Don't keep [the students] out
of the loop," she said. "Take time
for explanations."
Edmonds commended divisions
under her supervision that have
excelled in the last year, specifical
ly mentioning the work done by
Registrar Roger Printup and his
staff on the new ID cards and the
efforts of Dean of Admissions
James Montoya and the Financial
Aids staff in automating parts of
the financial aids system. Howev
er, she also cited some areas in
which she thinks the student
affairs departments can improve
their efforts.
She discussed providing services
for graduate and professional stu
dents as well as "building the sturdy
bridges between the academy and
Residential Education."
Edmonds also said her office
must "establish a research agenda
to ascertain the profile of the Stan
ford student today, then build our
programs, activities and support
systems to meet their needs."
The State of Student Affairs
speech was part of a larger event,
titled "Student Affairs Opening
Sessions." Edmonds began the

event by recognizing the work of
the deans and supervisors in her
department, who in turn recog
nized their staffs.
Montoya presented a video that
has been produced to use as a
recruiting tool for prospective
undergraduate students. Entitled
"Experiencing Stanford," the
video features clips of interviews
with students discussing why they
chose Stanford.

ate or professional educational
experience."
Edmonds spoke of three cate
gories of students who must be
most carefully considered when
discussing the alcohol policy: stu
dents who binge; students who
choose not to drink and do not
want to be around those who are;
and freshmen, "who are most vul
nerable to the establishment of
alcohol patterns during the first 12
weeks of their college experience."
Echoing sentiments expressed
by Dean of Students Marc Wais,
Edmonds called for "a reduction or
elimination of the perception held
by students that [administrators]
are against them."
That perception can be largely
eliminated, Edmonds said, "by
inclusion of more students in deci
sion-making and by open commu

nication on both sides.... I have
found that when students under
stand policies and procedures that
explain how decisions are made
and the rationale used in determin
ing the outcomes, they are less like
ly to be suspicious of our motives."
"Don't keep [the students] out
of the loop," she said. "Take time
for explanations."
Edmonds commended divisions
under her supervision that have
excelled in the last year, specifical
ly mentioning the work done by
Registrar Roger Printup and his
staff on the new ID cards and the
efforts of Dean of Admissions
James Montoya and the Financial
Aids staff in automating parts of
the financial aids system. Howev
er, she also cited some areas in
which she thinks the student
affairs departments can improve
their efforts.
She discussed providing services
for graduate and professional stu
dents as well as "building the sturdy
bridges between the academy and
Residential Education."
Edmonds also said her office
must "establish a research agenda
to ascertain the profile of the Stan
ford student today, then build our
programs, activities and support
systems to meet their needs."
The State of Student Affairs
speech was part of a larger event,
titled "Student Affairs Opening
Sessions." Edmonds began the

event by recognizing the work of
the deans and supervisors in her
department, who in turn recog
nized their staffs.
Montoya presented a video that
has been produced to use as a
recruiting tool for prospective
undergraduate students. Entitled
"Experiencing Stanford," the
video features clips of interviews
with students discussing why they
chose Stanford.
