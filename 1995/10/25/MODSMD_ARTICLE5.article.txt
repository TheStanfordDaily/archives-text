# Casper pays visit to ASSU Senate
## 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper answered questions from
ASSU senators last night, address
ing topics ranging from the sexual
harassment policy to the Presi
dent's Scholars Program.
Casper informed the Senate that
he and Provost Condoleezza Rice
have reviewed a revised draft of the
sexual harassment policy, adding
that the draft will be published in
its entirety today in Stanford Re
port. The publication will also in
clude instructions on how to access
the policy via the Internet.

Casper added that there will be a
two-week "comment period" begin
ning after the policy's publication
and encouraged any interested stu
dents to offer "constructive criti
cism" concerning the policy. After
the two weeks, a revised draft will
be submitted to the Faculty Senate
for final consideration.
Later in the meeting, Council of
Presidents member John Oram
posed a question concerning the
President's Scholars Program,
which seeks to attract the nation's
top students. Last year, 200 of the
most exceptional prospective fresh
men were offeree! a $1,500 research
grant and a visitation to campus
courtesy of the University.
()ram questioned Casper's abili
ty to justify such a program, which
()ram said "suggests that there itre
some students who are more valu
able to t he University than others."
Oram asked why the University
would pay to tly such exceptional
students to Stanford "when there
is not enough funding in the bud
get to fly out students with severe
financial need."
In his response, Casper men
tioned only that Stanford loses
some students to Ivy League
schools and that the President's
Scholars Program aims to mini
mize that possibility.
"There is a parallel in athletic
scholarships and visitations for
which I have never been ques
tioned," Casper added. "This is a
pragmatic solution to a very diffi
cult problem."
Other questions for Casper
included some concerning Stan
ford's judicial system and the pres
ident's involvement with the ethnic
centers.

' 1 here are limits to what can be
done," Casper responded. "I'm in
charge of an immensely complex
university, and I can only have so
much personal interaction with
students."
The ASSU conducted other
business after Casper's visit and
passed several bills, one of which is
aimed at supporting the presi
dent's commitment to affirmative
action at Stanford.
The bill endorsed Casper's poli
cy set forth on Oct. 12 and resolved
that the ASSU "initiate a means by
which to spread awareness ... in
regard to affirmative action."
Undergraduate senator Andre
Vanier expressed concern as to
what exactly "spreading aware
ness" means.
"The last time the ASSU
'spread awareness,' 20,000 letters
of a highly partisan nature were
sent to Congress concerning cuts in
financial aid," Vanier said.
Undergraduate senator Bill
Shen said later that "the letters
themselves weren't partisan, but
the statement U.S. Rep. Anna
Eshoo made in the Congressional
Record thanking Stanford students
was. The ASSU had no control over
that."
Vanier made a motion to strike
the part of the bill that would

spread awareness, but the bill ulti
mately passed by a divided vote.
The ASSU also spent a substan
tial amount of the meeting time
approving the fall quarter Program
Board allocations, specifically those
funds that would go towards Stan
ford's Moderate Majority, a new
political student group which is
pro-choice, pro-business and pro
environment.
The debate concerned whether
to allocate $1,000 in speaker fees
for Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
whom the Moderate Majority is
bringing to campus sometime this
year.
COP member Mike Choo stated
that elected officials cannot be paid
for their appearances. Moderate
Majority president Danny Bram
zon responded by stating that the
$1,000 would cover only the sena
tor's travel expenses.
The ASSU ultimately decided to
fund publicity for Specter's appear
ance and the fee for reserving Cub
berley Auditorium, but not the
$1,000 in speaker fees.
Three other bills officially
appointed the new elections com
missioner, nominations commis
sioner and Publications Board direc
tor. Filling the positions are Ryan
Medders, Scott Weintraub and Matt
Garlinghouse, respectively.
