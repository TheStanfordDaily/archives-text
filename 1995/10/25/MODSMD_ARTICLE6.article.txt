# National office dumps Betas
## 
### Braulio Garcia 
In a decision reached by its na
tional administrative office, the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity colony at
Stanford has been closed down.
Representatives for the organi
zation justified their decision,
made late last week, to close the
colony by citing the group's low
membership and inability to
maintain chartering standards
set forth by the national office.

munications for the national Beta

Theta Pi office, summed up the
reasons for their decision in one
word: "Apathy."
spring, the fraternity lost
its house at 557 Mayfield after
failing to meet a University re
quirement that it fill 90 percent of
its house with its members.
Johnson said there was no in
terest in the organization on the
part of the members. He added
that the Betas could not maintain
the chartering standards of the
fraternity, which, among other
things, required members to

maintain at least a 2.5 GPA and
perform one significant commu
nity service project per year, as
well as maintain sound financial
operating conditions.
"The guys obviously weren't
that into the Icolonyl," he said.
"Wedidn't see any interest, and so
we figured this would be for the
best."
Beta member Young-Min
Hong, a senior, said the decision
was obviously a disappointing
one. "I don't think it was the best
decision | the national office] could
have made," he said.
While some might think the
University had something to do
with the decision to close down
the fraternity. Fraternal Affairs
Advisor Heather Dunn was quick
to refute the notion.
"This decision was made by the
national office of Beta Theta Pi,"
she said. "The University had ab
solutely nothing to do with it and
was only informed of the decision
after the fact."
Besides the Lack of interest in the
fraternity by its current members,
Johnson also cited a kick of new
pledges as a reason for the shut
down of the fraternity. Johnson
said the fraternity "just couldn't

attract prospective members any
more."
Since the revocation of their
national charter in 1990, the Betas
at Stanford had been a "provision
al colony" separate from the
national office, with virtually no
self-governing power and not rec
ognized as an actual chapter of the
fraternity.
"If the Betas had been a strong,
on-the-move group and had risen
to our standards in their behavior
and practices, then they'd still be
there," Johnson said.

Another sizable factor in the
national office's decision to close
down the Betas was the trouble
that some members of the fraterni
ty have had in the past with the
law.
Last year over spring break,
four members and an alumnus of
the fraternity were arrested and
charged with suspicion of bur
glary, conspiracy and evading
arrest. The five were accused of
breaking into the Stanford Art
Museum with a knapsack of tools
including screwdrivers, a wood saw
and a hatchet. All charges against
the five have since been dropped.
Though Johnson said this inci
dent was not the sole reason for
the decision to shut down the

Betas, he said it was certainly key
in deciding the future of the frater
nity.
Hong, however, said he believed
the events last spring were "blown
out of proportion," especially by
"the media and The Daily."
"They propagated the situation
beyond salvation," he said.
The decision to close the frater
nity is just one in a long trail of
problems over the years for the
Betas. Besides the embarrassment
caused by the alleged break-in, the
fraternity lost its house after
regaining residency just two years
ago. The Betas had regained their
house in 1993 after having lost it
because of insufficient member
ship.
