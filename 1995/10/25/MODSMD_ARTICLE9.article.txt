## U.N. birthday comes to end 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — World leaders wrapped
up their largest gathering in history yesterday, promis
ing — with few specifics — to revive the United Nations
and restore its financial health.
Many leaders praised the United Nations on its 50th
birthday. But one president who has seen firsthand the
vast gulf between U.N. resolutions mid resolve sounded
a warning.
"Let us listen to what they are saying, but let us ask
them what they are doing," Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic said of his counterparts. "As soon as they
return home, unfortunately, they will continue their
course. It is up to us to stop them."
During three days of speech making, national leaders
took the opportunity to expound on virtually every issue
facing humanity: poverty and hunger, the environment,
population, terrorism, crime, the Bosnian war, Middle
East peace and nuclear arms.
In a joint declaration approved unanimously last
night, they focused on the United Nations itself. More
than 180 kings, princes, presidents and premiers
pledged to revitalize the organization and "create new
opportunities for peace, development, democracy and
cooperation."
The three-day gathering was as colorful, as diverse
and at times as unruly as humanity itself. Traffic in one
of the world's most densely populated areas ground to a
halt as police convoys sped world leaders to and from
meetings around New York. Protesters hounded contro
versial figures such as Cuban President Eidel Castro.
Yesterday, 800 Taiwanese marched through Manhattan
streets denouncing China's human rights record.
The birthday celebration was overshadowed by the
U.N.'s financial crisis and demands from all quarters for
reform. The seven-page declaration, hammered out dur
ing months of consultations, endorsed numerous reform
goals but offered few details on how to achieve them.
For example, it calls for expanding the powerful 15-
seat Security Council, dominated by the five permanent
members: the United States, Britain, France, Russia
and China. Permanent members can veto resolutions.
But the document endorsed none of the various pro
posals offered for reforming and expanding the council
to make it more representative of the membership.
Despite the problems, many world leaders said the
United Nations had much of which to be proud.
"The very fact that this organization survived half a
century of crisis and conflict in the world ... is already
remarkable in itself," Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said.
