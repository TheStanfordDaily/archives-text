PLATOON LEADERS CLASS
(Not the average summer vacation)
Spend part of this summer in an environment that teaches more
than you could ever learn in the college classroom...about your
abilities as a leader...how to handle mental and physical stress
and responsibility that a few of your peers could imagine...about
an incredible career opportunity available to men and women who
measure up to our standards. The Platoon Leaders Class or PLC
is the Marine Corps' primary officer commissioning program
All training takes place during one or two summers while you're
an undergraduate. After completing training and earning your
degree, you're commissioned as a second lieutenant. All
commissions are active duty, and flight school can be
guaranteed. If your goals for this summer are higher than just
soaking up the sun, and you're interested in a future that
provides unmatched leadership development, then contact your
local Marine Corps Officer Selection Officer for details.
