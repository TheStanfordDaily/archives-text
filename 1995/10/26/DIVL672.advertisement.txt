MOVING THE END OF THE SEMESTER?
I'll pay you $250 for your apartment!
I'm having a helluva time finding a 1 br in PA or MP and
will happily pay $250 for info leading to me securing a 1 br
with rent up to $1,000 a month. My ideal is to be near
campus or downtown in an apartment with some charm,
and to move in by 12/31
