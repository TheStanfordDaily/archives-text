## SHS braces for onslaught of Medicare cuts 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
The proposed $270 billion-dollar
Medicare overhaul passed in the House of
Representatives last Thursday will likely
have a severe impact on the Stanford
Medical School and Medical Center.
The current House proposal would cut
Medicare payments to hospitals by about
$75 billion over a seven-year period, and
University administrators said they be
lieve that teaching hospitals — such as
Stanford — would be hardest hit.
Although the bill still has the Senate
and a veto-threatening President Clinton
to pass through, Stanford Heath Services
is bracing for the worst.
Peter Van Etten, president of Stan
ford Health Services, said that while it is
difficult to determine the ultimate re
sults of cuts in Medicare, questions of
how medical education and research will
continue in the face of less and less fund
ing is a serious concern for the Medical
Center.
"Changes in Medicare payments will
substantially affect the ability of teach
ing hospitals to fulfill their traditional
missions," Van Etten said in a testimony
before a House subcommittee in July.

Van Etten argued that the Medicare
cuts would threaten the ability of acade

tients, develop new technology and train
the next generation of doctors.
Jeanne Kennedy, director of commu
nity and patient relations for Stanford
Health Services, agrees that the cuts will
only make a difficult situation worse.
"We'vecut $100 million from our bud
get since 1990," Kennedy said. This year
cuts are expected to continue, "partially
because of the Medicare proposal," she
added. The 1995-96 budget of Stanford
Health Services is about $510 million,
with $ 160 million coming from Medicare.
"We cut deeply to put money into new
programs and what we are doing now is
working, even in these terrible condi
tions," Kennedy said.
Van Etten's concerns about Medicare
reach outside the Stanford community to
the changing state of health care and in
surance in the United States.
"Extraordinary changes will be made
in the health care system which are dri
ven by the self-imposed commitment of
Congress to balance the budget without
cutting social security and still cutting
