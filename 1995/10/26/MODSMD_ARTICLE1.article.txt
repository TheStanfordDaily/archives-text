## SHS braces for onslaught of Medicare cuts 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
The proposed $270 billion-dollar
Medicare overhaul passed in the House of
Representatives last Thursday will likely
have a severe impact on the Stanford
Medical School and Medical Center.
The current House proposal would cut
Medicare payments to hospitals by about
$75 billion over a seven-year period, and
University administrators said they be
lieve that teaching hospitals — such as
Stanford — would be hardest hit.
Although the bill still has the Senate
and a veto-threatening President Clinton
to pass through, Stanford Heath Services
is bracing for the worst.
Peter Van Etten, president of Stan
ford Health Services, said that while it is
difficult to determine the ultimate re
sults of cuts in Medicare, questions of
how medical education and research will
continue in the face of less and less fund
ing is a serious concern for the Medical
Center.
"Changes in Medicare payments will
substantially affect the ability of teach
ing hospitals to fulfill their traditional
missions," Van Etten said in a testimony
before a House subcommittee in July.

Van Etten argued that the Medicare
cuts would threaten the ability of acade
mic medical centers to care for poor pa
tients, develop new technology and train
the next generation of doctors.
Jeanne Kennedy, director of commu
nity and patient relations for Stanford
Health Services, agrees that the cuts will
only make a difficult situation worse.
"We'vecut $100 million from our bud
get since 1990," Kennedy said. This year
cuts are expected to continue, "partially
because of the Medicare proposal," she
added. The 1995-96 budget of Stanford
Health Services is about $510 million,
with $ 160 million coming from Medicare.
"We cut deeply to put money into new
programs and what we are doing now is
working, even in these terrible condi
tions," Kennedy said.
Van Etten's concerns about Medicare
reach outside the Stanford community to
the changing state of health care and in
surance in the United States.
"Extraordinary changes will be made
in the health care system which are dri
ven by the self-imposed commitment of
Congress to balance the budget without
cutting social security and still cutting
cutting social security and still
cutting taxes," Van Etten said in
an interview yesterday.
"The question is to what extent
Congress and the president will
play chicken with the budget
deficit," he said. "We in health
care are the pawns in this battle."
Van Etten believes that the bill
will move a significant proportion
of the population into managed
care plans.
"What we have seen happen in
California is that these for-profit
HMOs have aggressively signed
up relatively healthy Medicare
patients and made a killing on
Medicare managed care," Van
Etten said, noting that the five
largest HMOs have a profit mar
gin of 22 percent. "But we as
teaching hospitals who provide
the most complex care for the
sickest patients are left with the
debt."
This type of system — in which
healthier patients have an incen
tive to look for managed health
care, which will eventually pro
vide more reimbursement than
Medicare — puts an undue bur
den on teaching hospitals. Hospi

tals like Stanford depend on Medi
care for reimbursement since
many of their patients either can
not afford a managed health-care
plan or need treatment that is not
covered under the plan.
Stanford's Office of Govern
ment and Community Relations,
which represents the interests of
the University in governmental
affairs is preparing a statement
detailing the impact that the cuts
will have on the Medical Center.
However, due to the volatile and
controversial nature of the cur
rent bill, they report no reliable
figures as of yet.
But according to Van Etten,
the cuts will probably affect Stan
ford's medical training programs
as well. Marc Vanefsky, the Medi
cal Center's chief resident in neu
rosurgery believes that residents
in all areas of training will be
affected by the Medicare cuts.
"There are probably going to
be cutbacks on residency training
programs in departments that
take more than one or two resi
dents a year," he said.
Vanefsky attributes this to a
lowering of the perceived need for
physicians in the managed aire
system. 1 le gives the example that
under Medicare, there might be a
need for one neurosurgeon for
every 125,000 patients. However

under managed care, that number
changes to one neurosurgeon for
about 250,000 patients.
"(Under managed care], prob
lems that would usually be han
dled by a specialist will now be
handled by a primary-care physi
cian," said Vanefsky.
"The people who will suffer are
the patients. They are being told
by HMOs that they can't see who
they want to see. They can't have
tests that might be medically indi
cated. This is an issue that is real
ly changing training in medicine,"
Vanefsky said, referring to the
decrease of specialist positions
due to the proliferation of man
aged care plans.
As fewer residents are accepted
into specialty training such as
neurosurgery, Vanefsky believes
that those who make it will have
more patients to look after, longer
hours and less time to pursue
research. In the long term, this
will be detrimental to all patients
who find themselves in need of
special care.
"The lives of millions of people
are going to be affected by these
politics, and so far there has been
very little public discussion about
it," Van Etten said. "Contrary to
what Republicans say, this is not
a plan to save Medicare. Medicare
will be gutted."

in all areas of training will be
affected by the Medicare cuts.
"There are probably going to
be cutbacks on residency training
programs in departments that
take more than one or two resi
dents a year," he said.
Vanefsky attributes this to a
lowering of the perceived need for
physicians in the managed aire
system. 1 le gives the example that
under Medicare, there might be a
need for one neurosurgeon for
every 125,000 patients. However

under managed care, that number
changes to one neurosurgeon for
about 250,000 patients.
"(Under managed care], prob
lems that would usually be han
dled by a specialist will now be
handled by a primary-care physi
cian," said Vanefsky.
"The people who will suffer are
the patients. They are being told
by HMOs that they can't see who
they want to see. They can't have
tests that might be medically indi
cated. This is an issue that is real
ly changing training in medicine,"
Vanefsky said, referring to the
decrease of specialist positions
due to the proliferation of man
aged care plans.
As fewer residents are accepted
into specialty training such as
neurosurgery, Vanefsky believes
that those who make it will have
more patients to look after, longer
hours and less time to pursue
research. In the long term, this
will be detrimental to all patients
who find themselves in need of
special care.
"The lives of millions of people
are going to be affected by these
politics, and so far there has been
very little public discussion about
it," Van Etten said. "Contrary to
what Republicans say, this is not
a plan to save Medicare. Medicare
will be gutted."
The proposed $270 billion-dollar
Medicare overhaul passed in the House of
Representatives last Thursday will likely
have a severe impact on the Stanford
Medical School and Medical Center.
The current House proposal would cut
Medicare payments to hospitals by about
$75 billion over a seven-year period, and
University administrators said they be
lieve that teaching hospitals — such as
Stanford — would be hardest hit.
Although the bill still has the Senate
and a veto-threatening President Clinton
to pass through, Stanford Heath Services
is bracing for the worst.
Peter Van Etten, president of Stan
ford Health Services, said that while it is
difficult to determine the ultimate re
sults of cuts in Medicare, questions of
how medical education and research will
continue in the face of less and less fund
ing is a serious concern for the Medical
Center.
"Changes in Medicare payments will
substantially affect the ability of teach
ing hospitals to fulfill their traditional
missions," Van Etten said in a testimony
before a House subcommittee in July.

Van Etten argued that the Medicare
cuts would threaten the ability of acade
mic medical centers to care for poor pa
tients, develop new technology and train
the next generation of doctors.
Jeanne Kennedy, director of commu
nity and patient relations for Stanford
Health Services, agrees that the cuts will
only make a difficult situation worse.
"We'vecut $100 million from our bud
get since 1990," Kennedy said. This year
cuts are expected to continue, "partially
because of the Medicare proposal," she
added. The 1995-96 budget of Stanford
Health Services is about $510 million,
with $ 160 million coming from Medicare.
"We cut deeply to put money into new
programs and what we are doing now is
working, even in these terrible condi
tions," Kennedy said.
Van Etten's concerns about Medicare
reach outside the Stanford community to
the changing state of health care and in
surance in the United States.
"Extraordinary changes will be made
in the health care system which are dri
ven by the self-imposed commitment of
Congress to balance the budget without
cutting social security and still cutting
cutting social security and still
cutting taxes," Van Etten said in
an interview yesterday.
"The question is to what extent
Congress and the president will
play chicken with the budget
deficit," he said. "We in health
care are the pawns in this battle."
Van Etten believes that the bill
will move a significant proportion
of the population into managed
care plans.
"What we have seen happen in
California is that these for-profit
HMOs have aggressively signed
up relatively healthy Medicare
patients and made a killing on
Medicare managed care," Van
Etten said, noting that the five
largest HMOs have a profit mar
gin of 22 percent. "But we as
teaching hospitals who provide
the most complex care for the
sickest patients are left with the
debt."
This type of system — in which
healthier patients have an incen
tive to look for managed health
care, which will eventually pro
vide more reimbursement than
Medicare — puts an undue bur
den on teaching hospitals. Hospi

tals like Stanford depend on Medi
care for reimbursement since
many of their patients either can
not afford a managed health-care
plan or need treatment that is not
covered under the plan.
Stanford's Office of Govern
ment and Community Relations,
which represents the interests of
the University in governmental
affairs is preparing a statement
detailing the impact that the cuts
will have on the Medical Center.
However, due to the volatile and
controversial nature of the cur
rent bill, they report no reliable
figures as of yet.
But according to Van Etten,
the cuts will probably affect Stan
ford's medical training programs
as well. Marc Vanefsky, the Medi
cal Center's chief resident in neu
rosurgery believes that residents
in all areas of training will be
affected by the Medicare cuts.
"There are probably going to
be cutbacks on residency training
programs in departments that
take more than one or two resi
dents a year," he said.
