# Israelis set to leave West Bank town
## All goes smoothly in first withdrawal under accord signed last month 
### 
JENIN, West Bank (AP) — Hundreds of
ecstatic Palestinians waving flags and chanting
"Our revolution is victorious!" mobbed the first
representatives of Yasser Arafat's police who
arrived yesterday.
Jenin is the first of seven cities to be handed
to the Palestinians under the Israel-PLO auton
omy agreement signed last month at the White
House. The arrival of Arafat's police is the first
step toward Palestinian self-rule in most West
Bank towns and villages by the end of the year.
While Israeli soldiers stood back and watched,
celebrating Palestinians took a flag from the
crowd and hoisted it to the top of a pole in front
of the just-opened Israeli-PLO liaison center,
then danced around the once-outlawed banner.
"We have been under occupation for 28 years
and now we are witnessing history," said
Kadoura Mousa, an Arafat aide in Jenin. "The
revolution of the construction of t he Palestinian
state has started."
The relatively smooth start to the Israeli pull
out from Jenin, open to the world's press, con
trasted sharply with last year's withdrawal from
the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers there packet! up
in the middle of the night, accompanied by gun
fire and hails of stones.
Later yesterday evening, dozens of Palestini
ans threw stones at Israeli troops in Jenin,
slightly injuring at least one border policeman,
Israel army radio said. Israel radio said three
firebombs were thrown, but caused no damage
or injuries.
Yesterday was notable as much for what
didn't happen as for what did. No Israeli soldiers
left t he territory they have occupied for 28 years,
and only 10 of the 12,000 Palestinian police to be
deployed in the West Bank actually arrived
and only after agreeing to come with their guns
unloaded.
But the 10 police, including five senior offi
cers in olive drab, were given a hero's welcome at
the Israel-PLO liaison office — six white trailers
on the outskirts of Jenin.
"This is a moment of joy for our entire peo
ple," said Jamal Hasanat, one of hundreds of
young men and boys singing and dancing in the

bare dirt courtyard in the center of the trailers.
Earlier yesterday, Israeli troops moved out of
the Jenin police station, loading chairs, tables
and refrigerators onto trucks as hundreds of
elated Palestinians ringed the station, cheering
and chanting "This is our land."
Jenin was festooned with flags, pictures of
Arafat and banners welcoming the Palestinian
police. A sign at the entrance to the city read,
"Today Jenin, Tomorrow Jerusalem."
The full transfer of authority in Jenin won't
happen until Nov. 13, when Israel will turn over
the army headquarters, police station, and all
other government property in the city to the
Palestinians, and the full contingent of 1,000
Palestinian police will start arriving. Withdraw
al from the rest of the West Bank will also take
place in stages.
Israeli troops are scheduled to be out of six

towns by the end of the year, and to shift posi
tions in the seventh, Hebron, by the end of
March. The pullout sets the stage for Palestini
an elections, tentatively set for Jan. 20.
In general, yesterday's events in Jenin took
place in an atmosphere of good will between
Israelis and Palestinians — perhaps a sign of the
growing comfort that has developed since the
May 1994 start of the autonomy experiment.
The absence of hostility was evident when
hundreds of Palestinians swarmed into the
courtyard of the Israel-PLO liaison office, press
ing into every corner and even climbing onto the
roofs of the trailers for a better view.
A few Israeli soldiers tried to clear a path
through the crowd, but were surrounded by
singing and clapping Palestinians. Smiling, they
gave up, leaving the Palestinians to celebrate on
their own.
