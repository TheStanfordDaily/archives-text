# Five dead in school bus accident
## 30 injured in rush-hour collision at railroad crossing 
### 
FOX RIVER GROVE, 111. (AP)
— A commuter train ripped apart
a school bus stopped on the tracks
yesterday as youngsters in the
back rushed forward in terror at
the sight of 620 tons of steel bear
ing down on them. Five students
were killed and about 30 injured.
Some witnesses said the bus
was trying to cross the tracks
about 7:20 a.m. when it got caught
at a red light behind a car and
couldn't make it all the way across.
Hut others said there was no car
ahead and the driver could have
moved forward.
"You could see the terror in
their eyes," witness Coreen
Bachinskv said. "You could hear
the metal, the glass flying, the
screams. It was very, very scary."
The bus was taking the young
sters to 1,400-student Cary-Grove
High School in Gary. The Ohicago
bound express train was traveling
between 50 and 00 mph and
sheared the body of the bus off the
chassis, spinning it around 180
degrees.
"From then on out, all you
heard was screaming," said
Andrea Arens, 19, who was wait
ing for another train in this bed
room community nearly 40 miles
northwest of Chicago.
Four students were pronounced
dead at the scene and one died at a
hospital. Eleven were hospitalized

last night, six in critical condition.
Taben Johanson, a 15-year-old
who was sitting in his usual third
row seat on the bus, said the gate
came down on the back of the bus
and there was a car in front. Then
he looked up and saw the train
bearing down on them.
"I basically figured it out when
all the kids were running forward,
screaming," he said.
Jim Homola, a carpenter driv
ing his children to school, said he
had been stopped behind the bus
and saw the approaching train.
"We started screaming, 'Go! Go!' "
he said. "It was over in a matter of
seconds."
Homola said bus driver "was in
hysterics" afterward.
The driver, Patricia Gaten
camp, was taken to a hospital for
evaluation.
She was filling in for the regu
lar driver on the route, students
said. The secretary of state's office
said the 54-year-old woman had
been licensed to drive a school bus
since 1987 and had a flawless driv
ing record.
Hours after the accident, the
body of the bus lay about 10 feet
from the wheels and chassis, the
steering wheel jutting in the air.
Red plastic sheets were draped
over some of the wreckage.
A nurse who helped out at the
scene, Helen Getchell, said she

suctioned out the throat of one
injured boy with a turkey baster
obtained from a convenience store
nearby.
"He died in rny arms," she said,
adding that she hoped the boy's
mother would know"he didn't die
by himself."
"There were kids laying on the
ground on the driver's side of the
bus," said another witness, James
Orlandino. "It looked like they had
been thrown out."
School officials could not say
exactly how many people were
aboard the bus.
Mark Davis, a spokesman for
Union-Pacific, which employs the
train crew, said the engineer tried
desperately to stop the train. "He
slowed down. Then he applied the
emergency brake, then he got on
the horn," Davis said.
In the afternoon, cars lined up
out of the parking lot and onto a
nearby highway as people showed
up to donate blood at Good Shep
herd Hospital in nearby Barring
ton, where some victims were
taken.
Jason Kedrok, 16, was wearing
a hospital bracelet and had bruises
on his face and arm when he
showed up at the accident scene in
the afternoon to look at the wreck
he had survived.
"Just looking at it now, I can't
believe I got out of it,"he said.
