ASSU should consider
several factors when
producing course guide

ON PAGE 807 of this year's
Stanford Bulletin, under
"University Publications,"
there is a listing for the ASSU
course guide. But don't run to
Tresidder to pick up your copy just
yet — the guide hasn't been pro
duced since 1992.
Now, however, the ASSU Senate
has embarked on a quest to recreate
this valuable student resource. In
doing so, it is important that the
ASSU not only learn from past mis
takes, but also take advantage of
existing and new resources like the
World Wide Web.
Producing a publication is a long
and arduous task, one filled with
unforeseen pitfalls and large expens
es though in 1984-85, a Tresidder
Union marketing survey found that
75 percent of undergraduates were
using the course guide, in the previ
ous year the project lost over
$10,000. In order to cover costs, the
project requested — but did not
recieve — a $25,000 special fee.
By publishing electronically, the
ASSU would be able to reduce the
likelihood of such pitfalls by evading
sunk printing and production costs.
At the same time, going on-line
would make this resource available
to an even larger audience in a more
permanent form. This would also
avoid the destructive wear and tear
that happens to other valuable
resources, such as freshman face
books.
On-line publishing would remove
size constraints on the guide as well
— it could be as large as necessary.
Stored electronically, the guide
would also serve as a growing, last
ing record, allowing students to
compare class and professor ratings
from year to year.
Not surprisingly, course guides
can and do have a major effect on

campus. With funding and help
from the School of Engineering,
Tau Beta Pi, an engineering honors
society, produces a very popular and
helpful engineering course guide
every year. Also, this year the Stan
ford Economics Journal released its
first economics course guide. Short
ly thereafter, a certain professor
who had the dubious honor of being
rated as both an excellent teacher
and an easy grader found that his
classrooms were overflowing with
students.
Therefore, the ASSU must also
take great care and effort in secur
ing the information the guide will
contain. While the original guide
only provided data on undergradu
ate courses, there is no reason why
the ASSU should not include gradu
ate courses as well. The ASSU must
strive to serve as many students as
possible, not just selected segments.
In trying to obtain course ratings
and comments, the ASSU should
also investigate resources which
already exist. For instance, both the
Law School and the Graduate
School of Business keep evaluation
results on reserve in their respec
tive libraries for public review. The
School of Medicine makes similar
information available to anyone
who is willing, and knows where, to
ask for it.
In addition to the aforemen
tioned examples, the School of
Humanities and Sciences also dis
tributes quarterly surveys to its
professors. However, individual pro
fessors are allowed to decide how
the gathered comments fire dissem
inated. They can bar anyone, even
their department chairs, from see
ing the results at their discretion.
Ten years ago, part of each stu
dent's evaluation went to the pro
ducers of the course guide, while
professors had the option not to
contribute to the project. A similar
system should be recreated.
The ASSU thinks it can unveil its
course guide by winter or spring
quarter next year. Coupling well
defined goals with a little research
and planning, a superior product
can be produced in half the time.
