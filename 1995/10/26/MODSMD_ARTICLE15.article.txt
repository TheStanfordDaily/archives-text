Putting noisy Powerbooks in their place

IT HAPPENED AGAIN yesterday. I
sat down at a carrel on the third
floor of Green Library and prepared
to read a section of "A Theory of Jus
tice" by John Rawls. "The limitation of
liberty is justified only when it is neces
sary for liberty itself, to prevent an
invasion of freedom that would be still
worse," I began. I was then vaguely
aware of a body sidling into the carrel
across from me as I settled in for a long
thoughtful read. Suddenly, my tranquil
world was shattered by the sound most
loathed by book-bearing Green-goers:
the electronic, high-pitched tone,
"Bong," that accompanies the turning
on of a Macintosh Powerbook速.
The tone itself was rather soothing;
the dread of it lay in what it portended.
As soon as the whirring and grinding

had ended (the dull buzz remained), I
heard a few clicks of the mouse and
then nothing. I took a deep breath,
relaxed and began again on Rawls: "It
is clearly difficult for individuals to
coordinate their lives efficiently in
order to insure that mutually beneficial
arrangements are maintained." Then,
like shots in the dark, "Clack-clack
clackity . . . clack-ack-ack . . . clickity
clackity-click-clack-ak-ity," and so on
continuously. Indeed, such a clatter
arose that I could not concentrate on
my reading. All I was thinking about
was the Powerbook problem.
Lap-top computers have become per
vasive on campus, and I'm all in favor of
them. On the other hand, I believe that
libraries such as Green should limit
computer users to certain parts of the

facility. Either sequester all lap-top
users to one section, or set aside a com
puter-free section for those of us not
carrying keyboards. In Crown Library,
floors are clearly marked with stickers
indicating that portable computers are
or are not allowed on particular floors.
Green should take similar measures to
enhance the quality of its studying envi
ronment.
I realize that even without power
books, Green would be no bastion of
silence. Yet, other distractions can be
minimized by a politely assertive person
telling talkers to please whisper, chip
eaters to keep it down and pencil-tappers
to cease. As it stands, there is no recourse
available to students distracted by lap-top
computer noise. After all, the computer
users are evidently hard at work.

I do get suspicious at times when a user
types continuously for minutes on end
without a single break. How do they do
that? Are they simply trying to be annoy
ing? Furthermore, when such a simple
solution is at hand, why not try it out?
By putting powerbooks in their
place, all students will be able to enjoy
the fruits of Rawls with less resent
ment toward those who come to the
library to write works of their own. To
end with Rawls, "The plans of individu
als need to be fitted together so that
their activities are compatible with one
another and they can all be carried
through without anyone's legitimate
expectations being severely disappoint
ed."
