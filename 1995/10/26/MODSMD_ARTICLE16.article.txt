# Daily and columnist should be more sensitive to issues of sex and rape
## 
### 
We would like to open The Daily and
not be nauseated.
We are concerned that the Opinions
page does not recognize the severity of
sexual violence. Two examples come
immediately to mind: Brendan McCul
lough's offensive interpretation of sexual
pursuit and rape in his column of Oct.
23, and an editorial cartoon from the
preceding week concerning the local seri
al rapist and University Food Service.
We understand that the intent of
both pieces was neither to offend the
reader nor legitimize sexual assault.
However, we are disturbed that The
Daily Op-ed pages could allow such flip
pant appropriation of these events.
Utilizing a recent series of rapes in
the area to poke fun at the quality of
Food Service was unnecessary, distaste
ful and unfunny. Equating the severity

of the two necessarily belittles sexual
assault.
As for Mr. McCullough's column, fault
for his woeful reading of the texts must lie
somewhere between complete and utter
ignorance. Shall we quote Mr. McCul
lough? He describes and applauds Zeus'
sexual conquests: Zeus managed to put
the moves on some unsuspecting woman
and have sex with her. Impressive, eh?
Ovid tells us exactly how impressive in his
description of lo's desperate flight from
the rapacious Zeus: "IZeus) stayed her
flight, and took her." (Humphries, Meta
morphoses, Book I, line. 600)
We are not offended by misrepresenta
tions of canonical texts (we could never
tell Scylla from Charvbdis), and we do
not offer an orthodox reading. Yet, we
should not ignore Mr. McCullough's
blindness to the implications of the texts.
Furthermore, the apparent lack of
editorial responsibility concerns us. We
would expect the Opinions staff to recog
nize that contributors should not joke
with the real horror of sexual violence.
We are appalled by their failure to do
this. Mr. McCullough's column and the

editorial cartoon have no place in a jour
nal read by those possessing more than a
brain stem.
