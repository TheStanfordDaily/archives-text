The Stanford Review's "Chief' resem
bles comic book characters Archie and
Jughead from the "Archie" comics of the
'50s. How can a disembodied head and
hand be considered dignified and repre
sentative of Native American character?
This cartoon depicts stereotypical car
icature and obvious disregard for a peo
ple's feelings. Erase the headband and
feathers and draw a 17th century Puri
tan hat and this cartoon would resemble
what it is — a Caucasian caricature.
Maybe the staff at The Review ought to
consider using an obvious Caucasian car
icature from U.S. history, such as the self
righteous Puritan man, for its mascot.
