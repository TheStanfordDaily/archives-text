# Jon Ganz and Rand Blackford
## A 						student guide to first dates 
### 
SO, YOU'VE BEEN eyeing this hotty
across the way in class and perhaps
you've noticed that your blank stare
coupled with drool has not gone unno
ticed. Perhaps your actions have been
reciprocated by her with a clandestine
glance or two in your direction.
As this has been happening on a daily
basis (for about three weeks now), you
must be thinking that it's about time to
make your next move. An intelligent per
son would probably just sit there, continue
to take notes and forget about the whole
damn thing. Yeah, but we're not that
smart, so we're thinking about asking this
Special Someone out for coffee or, hey,
why not a movie?
That's about as exciting as ficus plant
leaves — which, granted, are fairly titillat
ing. But c'mon, we can do better than that,
can't we? Sure we can! And to prove it, we
are going to provide you — free of charge
— with some of our own "Nearly Fail-
Safe, Sure-Fire First Date Ideas," person
ally guaranteed to impress the space aliens
out of the socks of that "Special Some
hun."
• Start ofT with a little "oral humor," pro
vided by our favorite Monday columnist.
• Go to a ballet. Heckle the dancers. Then
get in a fight with the conductor.
• How about a tour of the load operating
state penitentiary?
• Hang out at the butcher's. Mmmin
mmm-mmeat!
• Fake your deaths and then collect the
insurance.
• "SHOWGIRLS!"

• Score some crank and invite your date to
video games and air hockey, on you!
• Go to a hockey game. Get in a fight.
Don't lose.
• Take that Special Somehun to a satanic
meeting / orgy / potluck.
•PERMS!
• Shave each other's back. It's fun and
doesn't take a bite out of your wallet!
• Tattoo / pierce each other with common
household implements.
• Dance-a-thon (better start off
reeaaaallllll slow).
• Build a time machine. Take your date
coal mining in the 1880s.
• Invite that Special Somehun to stalk
your ex-lover.
• Impress your date by beating up some
one small.
• Ice blocking . .. naked.
• Make a rock video where you're the
STAR!
• Take your date to a high school prom.
• Incite a large-scale drug / gang / civil war
in a small country.
• Take a quick tour of a local crack house.
• A candlelight dinner on top of a tower
with your favorite rifles.
• The Second Annual RFB 25-I)rug Cycle
at the Coffee House. (It's next Sunday at
noon. We have shirts. Come prepared.)
• SPELUNKING!
• Spanking.
• Chase demon squirrels. Eat them raw.
Damn Varmints!
• Treat your date to a $10 Ernie's
Liquor / Taco Bell Challenge. (The deal is,
you each have $10. You must spend it all

cither on 59-cent value meal items at Taco
Bell or on $ 1.44 40s at Ernie's. Any combo
of soft tacos and 40s is 0.K., but you must
consume 10 bucks' worth (and no doggie
bags). Experience has taught us that three
Cobras — don't let the smooth taste fool
ya — and nine soft tacos will set you
straight for the evening.
Brilliant as these ideas are, you may
still need some witty banter and playful
discourse to make the evening a success.
Some topics of conversation that have tra
ditionally worked for us include: Why
vinyl underwear tickles our fancies; your
dreams of becoming a management con
sultant; David Sacks and Peter Thiel and
their irrelevant personal diatribes against
multiculturalism and root beer.
Things that haven't worked at all for
us, as much as we've tried, include: The
day your favorite pet died; CIV; how you
were valedictorian in high school but are
not even average at Stanford; and SAT
scores. (Whatever you do, don't ever, ever,
in a million kajillion years show them your
resume.)
These ideas virtu ally guarantee you a
successful first date. Unfortunately, we
haven't gotten as far as the second, so
you're on your own.

Ladies, if you are interested in meeting
Mr. Ganz and Mr. Blackford, stop by The
Daily offices. You can ambush them
around 6 p.m.
