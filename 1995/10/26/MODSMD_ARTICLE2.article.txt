# Students to educate on affirmative action
## 
### Marni Leff 
Tonight at midnight, six UC-Irvine stu
dents will reach the 10th day of a hunger
strike — and arrive at the deadline their
university gave them to end the demon
stration.
A group of Stanford students will com
memorate the strikers' efforts with a series
of events beginning today that aim to edu
cate people here about the issue behind the
fasting: the UC Regents' recent decision to
end affirmative action at UC campuses.
Between 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. today,
students will hand out information at a
table in White Plaza recognizing the strik
ers and discussing the past and future of af
firmative action.
The dedication of the UC-Irvine stu
dents, said sophomore Monisha Bajaj, a
member of Resistance Action Grassroots
organizing Education (RACE), shows how
serious they are about affirmative action.
"I think the hunger strike is a good dis
play that this isn't just a decision made by a

group of rich, old men sitting in a room that
we are going to take lying down," Hajaj
said. "Not eating for 10 days shows how
committed the students are to their cause."
With so many out-of-state Stanford stu
dents, noted another activist, sophomore
Cindy Urquidez, many people might not
understand the significance of the decision
to end affirmative action.
"People here don't realize that affirma
tive action does affect them," Urquidez
said. "Affirmative action affects everyone.
I'd love to say we don't need it, but — with
members of our society who have different
skin colors, different accents and different
places of origin — in order for those people
to succeed we need equal rights.
"Too many people are conditioned to
just go along with the status quo. We need
to challenge that," she said.
Urquidez and other interested Stanford
students along with Californians for Jus
tice — a statewide affirmative-action group
— have planned to visit the
homes of two UC Regents living
in the Stanford area Sunday
night.
"We're going to show them that
we are concerned," Urquidez said,
adding that the group isn't sure

yet what they exactly plan to do.
Following Sunday night's
action, the ASSU, along with the
Students of Colors Coalition
(SOCC) is organizing an open
mike discussion about affirmative
action.
"It's really going to be a space
for any views people have about
affirmative action to come out,"
Bajaj said. "We want for students
to know the facts and then we'll

go from there.
"I'd rather have five people
who really know what's going on
and have them disagree with me
than have 100 who blindly agree
with me," she said.
Several student groups are
working together to bring the
Rev. Jesse Jackson to speak on
campus Nov. 14, and Urquidez
hopes hearing him will spark dis
cussion among Stanford students.

"Having the opportunity to
hear him talk about issues and
politics is really important,"
Urquidez said. "Voices need to be
heard. We're hoping for a big
turnout and that it will generate a
lot of discussion afterwards."
Bajaj said the UC Regents'
decision is part of a greater trend
of discrimination against minori
ty groups, adding that it is
extremely important to fieht

against the decision. Bajaj attend
ed a rally in Oakland and partic
ipated in the recent walkout at
UC-Berkeley to protest the
Regents' decision.
"Affirmative action is really
important because the forces are
really unequal," Bajaj said. "If
you look at any public school in a
city and then compare it to one in
the suburbs, there are vast differ
ences. Until that's changed, there

need to be equalizing factors.
"The ones who are especially
affected are students of color,"
Bajaj said. "We all benefit from a
diverse community. It's the only
way to obtain equality."
As far as what she hopes can
get accomplished at Stanford,
Bajaj said, "right now we want
everyone just to know the facts.
Once more people know what's
going on, we'll go from there."
