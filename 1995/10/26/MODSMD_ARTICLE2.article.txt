# Students to educate on affirmative action
## 
### Marni Leff 
Tonight at midnight, six UC-Irvine stu
dents will reach the 10th day of a hunger
strike — and arrive at the deadline their
university gave them to end the demon
stration.
A group of Stanford students will com
memorate the strikers' efforts with a series
of events beginning today that aim to edu
cate people here about the issue behind the
fasting: the UC Regents' recent decision to
end affirmative action at UC campuses.
Between 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. today,
students will hand out information at a
table in White Plaza recognizing the strik
ers and discussing the past and future of af
firmative action.
The dedication of the UC-Irvine stu
dents, said sophomore Monisha Bajaj, a
member of Resistance Action Grassroots
organizing Education (RACE), shows how
serious they are about affirmative action.
"I think the hunger strike is a good dis
play that this isn't just a decision made by a

group of rich, old men sitting in a room that
we are going to take lying down," Hajaj
said. "Not eating for 10 days shows how
committed the students are to their cause."
With so many out-of-state Stanford stu
dents, noted another activist, sophomore
Cindy Urquidez, many people might not
understand the significance of the decision
to end affirmative action.
"People here don't realize that affirma
tive action does affect them," Urquidez
said. "Affirmative action affects everyone.
I'd love to say we don't need it, but — with
members of our society who have different
skin colors, different accents and different
places of origin — in order for those people
to succeed we need equal rights.
"Too many people are conditioned to
just go along with the status quo. We need
to challenge that," she said.
