# Casper funds graduate research
## 
### Adrian Keatinge-Clay 
As financial resources dwindle, graduate students
find it ever harder to finance research for their disser
tations.
But the picture just got a little brighter for students
in the School of Humanities and Sciences and the
School of Education. This year, University President
Gerhard Casper has allocated $150,000 to fund the
Graduate Research Opportunity program in the two
schools.
The grant was requested by Humanities and Sci
ences Dean John Shoven. It is one of the few such
research grants to have been transferred from the
President's Eund to the two schools — and the largest
yet.
The research fund will primarily target doctoral
candidates in the humanities and social sciences, who
will have a chance to obtain up to $5,000 for their pro
jects.
Funding, given out quarterly, is meant to defray
expenses resulting from doctoral student's travel, pur
chase of datasets and the fabrication of questionnaires
and surveys.
"Most of this quarter's recipients came from the
History Department, partly because history students
were made more aware of the research funds," said
Roni Holeton, assistant dean for graduate studies in
humanities and sciences.
"Selections for the funded activities are made by a

panel of four faculty members from the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the School of Education
three times each year," she said. "Of the 40 autumn
quarter applicants, 17 were chosen to receive funding ,
last week."
Holeton expects that obtaining the research funds
"will be even more competitive in the future."
For this quarter, "students did not have much time
to get their applications together," she said. "Most ,
graduate students did not realize the funds were avail- [
able."
A list of the funded activities include travel to New
Zealand to continue research on the literary effects of |
English colonialism; travel to Mexico City to continue
archival research on the Mexican banking system in
the late 19th century; and the purchase of datasets in .«
order to continue testing a hypothesis on technology
diffusion in the PC software industry.
The donation out of the President's Fund is espe
cially important because students in certain areas
find it harder to get research money, Holeton said.
"Funds from outside sources are not as common in
the School of Humanities and Sciences as it is in the
School of Engineering or the School of Medicine," she
said.
"The School of Humanities and Sciences and the
School of Education are grateful for the president's
support," Holeton added. "Our jobs are made more
fun when we are able to give students the financial
support they need."
