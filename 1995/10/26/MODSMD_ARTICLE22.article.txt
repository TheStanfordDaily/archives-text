# Oversight leads to spread of virus in student dorms
## RCCs disinfect computers 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
During a recent upgrade of system software on
dorm computers, a virus prevention program was
mistakenly omitted from the collection of software
loaded onto residential computer hard drives —
causing at least three separate clusters to be infected
with the computer virus MDEF.
"It was a slight oversight on our part," said Dane
Spearing, assistant director of residential comput
ing. "But it looks as though the virus problem has
been abated," adding that the computers are now
clean.
Within 24 hours of receiving reports of infection
from residential computing coordinators in Serra,
Loro and Cardenal, the Residential Computing office
instructed residential computer coordinators to
install the prevention program where missing.
The MDEF virus is non-malicious, which "means
that it will not trash things or kill data," said Patrick
Weston, RCC for East Florence Moore Hall. "It is
basically annoying and can cause programs not to
run."
But Spearing noted that he is still uncertain
whether MDEF infected other residential clusters,
as it has yet to be determined when the prevention
extension was left out of the upgrade process which
began in July and ended about two weeks ago.

He urged all students who have used their disks in
dorm clusters to disinfect them as well as their per
sonal computors.
During the dorm system upgrade, Disinfectant
INIT — the component of the Disinfectant program
that prevents virus infection — was left out of the
new software package loaded on all residential com
puters. The actual Disinfectant program that detects
viruses, however, was included in the package and
allowed residential computer coordinators to detect
MDEF.
The first reported problem in connection with the
virus occurnd just over a week ago, when a Serra
resident could not open Microsoft Word documents
on her own computer.
"On a whim, I ran the disinfectant program on
her computer and found the virus," said Anoop
Sinha, Serra RCC. But he said he had no reason to
suspect it was connected with the Serra cluster at
the time.
"There was very little sign of the virus," Sinha
said. "It doesn't do anything malicious."
Weston said that all but two of his computers in
East Flo Mo were infected with MDEF, adding that
he found it before it had created problems. Weston
said he scanned his cluster for the virus after an RCC
in West Flo Mo had found one in his cluster.
Spearing issued a warning to all RCCs on Tuesday
after Flo Mo RCCs alerted him of the problem.
