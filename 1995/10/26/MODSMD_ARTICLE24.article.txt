## Murphy all-purpose leader for Stanford soccer 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In the 12-year history of varsity
women's soccer at Stanford, there have
been a handful of superstars in the pro
gram. At the end of this season, head
coach lan Sawyers will add the name
Carmel Murphy to that elite list.
This season, Murphy, a four-year
starter for the Cardinal, is putting up the
finest ofTensive totals of her collegiate
career. With four regular-season match
es remaining, Murphy has already estab
lished career-highs in goals (10), assists
(five) and points (25). All three totals tie
Murphy with junior Erin Martin for the
team lead.
"Carmel is a unique player for a mid
fielder," Sawyers said. "She is able to
penetrate on the pass, her dribbling is
amazing and she has great speed with
the ball at her feet. Once she breaks the
defensive line, she's always a threat to
score."
The midfield position requires a
variety of skills and the endurance to
play both offense and defense. Murphy
blends these qualities into an on-field
presence all her own.
"My job is to connect with the defen
sive line and start the offensive run,"
Murphy said. "I'm not as strong a play
maker as other midfielders. 1 tend to do
more offensively by penetrating."
Sawyers agreed. "Usually, a mid
fielder has good distribution skills and
plays good defense," he said. "Carmel
can also penetrate well on the dribble.
She's the whole package."
The Cardinal coaching staff was
aware of Murphy's host of talents when
she arrived at Stanford in 1992. "She's
developed her skills over her four years
here," Sawyers said. "We recognized
the potential she had back then. It was
just a matter of confidence. She didn't
realize how good she was. Then she

realized, 'Hey, I can play at this level.' "
One of the on-field adjustments
Murphy had to make as a freshman was
taking on a larger role in the defense,
due to the offensive prowess of team
mate and four-time Ail-American Julie
Foudy.
"I was used to being the central scorer
on my teams in high school and club soc
cer," Murphy said. "Playing with Foudy,
I was supporting cast, playing a lot of
defense. It wasn't what I was used to."

'Carmel has blossomed
into a great player,
playmaker and leader.
Working with her day in
and day out is a joy.
She is everything you
want in a captain.'
— lan Sawyers

Murphy tallied seven goals and 15
points in her rookie season and has
been a consistent scorer for the Cardi
nal since then. With 74 career points,
Murphy ranks fifth on Stanford's all
time scoring list.
According to Sawyers, Murphy's
value to the Cardinal goes far beyond
her outstanding statistical accomplish
ments. A co-captain last year and this
year's team captain, Murphv provides
leadership on and off the field.
"Carmel has blossomed into a great
player, playmaker and leader," Sawyers
said. "Working with her day in and day
out is a joy. She is everything you want
in a captain, not just as a player, but
also as a person."
Sawyers cited Murphy's teammates

when describing her outgoing personal
ity. "They have said that she is very
maternal," he said. "She hated that
term, but she really does take care of
the younger players on the team.
Carmel is a very giving person. People
respect her."
When asked about her maternal
role, Murphy laughed. "I get told that
all the time," she said. "It's just my
nature. It helps being the team captain,
but I really enjoy helping the younger
players."
In games, Murphy said she tries to
get the team going using verbid encour
agement. She also recalls the strong
example Foudy set for her teammates
on the field through her play.
"Julie was a great role model, espe
cially in her work ethic," Murphy said.
"1 try to do that, too."
According to Sawyers, Murphy is
successful in providing that type of
example for her team. "Carmel is lead
ing the team this year with her goal
scoring," Sawyers said. "She is not a
yeller or a screamer on the field. She
motivates by giving her teammates
information. Watching her play, the
team gets inspired."
Perhaps the most inspiring perfor
mance of Murphy's Stanford career
came two years ago in the 1993 NCAA
Final Four at North Carolina. Playing
in the national semifinals against
George Mason, the Cardinal battled
through regulation, a half-hour of over
time, then another half-hour of sudden
death. With the score locked at 1-1 after
two-and-a-half hours of action, the
match moved to penalty kicks. Stanford
lost, 3-1.
"In that entire game, never once did
I see Carmel stop running," Sawyers
said. "There is just something in there
— she's not going to let us lose."

Senior midfielder Carmel Murphy does it all for Stanford's women soccer team, leading
the Cardinal both on and off the field.
Always modest, Murphy recalls
that match with pride. "It was
probably one of the best games I've
ever played," she said. "I wanted it
so bad. I was crushed when we
didn't win. We deserved to win. It
made me hungrier than ever to get

back (to the Final Four) now."
No matter the outcome of this
season, Murphy will be satisfied
with her four years at Stanford.
"As far as my soccer career goes,
this is the ultimate," Murphy said.
"I've had opportunities to play for
the national team, but that's not
what I've wanted. This is the far
thest I want to go, winning an
NCAA championship at Stan
ford."

Sawyers is certain that Murphy
will do all she can to help her team
reach that goal in her final run for
an NCAA title. "It has been great to
watch her develop," he said. "She
has been a superstar for a couple of
years — she is the real thing, just a
phenomenal package."
"Superstar" is a title that
Sawyers admits he rarely uses. But
as a player and a person, Murphy
qualifies for such a rare honor.

has been a superstar for a couple of
years — she is the real thing, just a
phenomenal package."
"Superstar" is a title that
Sawyers admits he rarely uses. But
as a player and a person, Murphy
qualifies for such a rare honor.
In the 12-year history of varsity
women's soccer at Stanford, there have
been a handful of superstars in the pro
gram. At the end of this season, head
coach lan Sawyers will add the name
Carmel Murphy to that elite list.
This season, Murphy, a four-year
starter for the Cardinal, is putting up the
finest ofTensive totals of her collegiate
career. With four regular-season match
es remaining, Murphy has already estab
lished career-highs in goals (10), assists
(five) and points (25). All three totals tie
Murphy with junior Erin Martin for the
team lead.
"Carmel is a unique player for a mid
fielder," Sawyers said. "She is able to
penetrate on the pass, her dribbling is
amazing and she has great speed with
the ball at her feet. Once she breaks the
defensive line, she's always a threat to
score."
The midfield position requires a
variety of skills and the endurance to
play both offense and defense. Murphy
blends these qualities into an on-field
presence all her own.
"My job is to connect with the defen
sive line and start the offensive run,"
Murphy said. "I'm not as strong a play
maker as other midfielders. 1 tend to do
more offensively by penetrating."
Sawyers agreed. "Usually, a mid
fielder has good distribution skills and
plays good defense," he said. "Carmel
can also penetrate well on the dribble.
She's the whole package."
The Cardinal coaching staff was
aware of Murphy's host of talents when
she arrived at Stanford in 1992. "She's
developed her skills over her four years
here," Sawyers said. "We recognized
the potential she had back then. It was
just a matter of confidence. She didn't
realize how good she was. Then she

realized, 'Hey, I can play at this level.' "
One of the on-field adjustments
Murphy had to make as a freshman was
taking on a larger role in the defense,
due to the offensive prowess of team
mate and four-time Ail-American Julie
Foudy.
"I was used to being the central scorer
on my teams in high school and club soc
cer," Murphy said. "Playing with Foudy,
I was supporting cast, playing a lot of
defense. It wasn't what I was used to."

'Carmel has blossomed
into a great player,
playmaker and leader.
Working with her day in
and day out is a joy.
She is everything you
want in a captain.'
— lan Sawyers

Murphy tallied seven goals and 15
points in her rookie season and has
been a consistent scorer for the Cardi
nal since then. With 74 career points,
Murphy ranks fifth on Stanford's all
time scoring list.
According to Sawyers, Murphy's
value to the Cardinal goes far beyond
her outstanding statistical accomplish
ments. A co-captain last year and this
year's team captain, Murphv provides
leadership on and off the field.
"Carmel has blossomed into a great
player, playmaker and leader," Sawyers
said. "Working with her day in and day
out is a joy. She is everything you want
in a captain, not just as a player, but
also as a person."
Sawyers cited Murphy's teammates

when describing her outgoing personal
ity. "They have said that she is very
maternal," he said. "She hated that
term, but she really does take care of
the younger players on the team.
Carmel is a very giving person. People
respect her."
When asked about her maternal
role, Murphy laughed. "I get told that
all the time," she said. "It's just my
nature. It helps being the team captain,
but I really enjoy helping the younger
players."
In games, Murphy said she tries to
get the team going using verbid encour
agement. She also recalls the strong
example Foudy set for her teammates
on the field through her play.
"Julie was a great role model, espe
cially in her work ethic," Murphy said.
"1 try to do that, too."
According to Sawyers, Murphy is
successful in providing that type of
example for her team. "Carmel is lead
ing the team this year with her goal
scoring," Sawyers said. "She is not a
yeller or a screamer on the field. She
motivates by giving her teammates
information. Watching her play, the
team gets inspired."
Perhaps the most inspiring perfor
mance of Murphy's Stanford career
came two years ago in the 1993 NCAA
Final Four at North Carolina. Playing
in the national semifinals against
George Mason, the Cardinal battled
through regulation, a half-hour of over
time, then another half-hour of sudden
death. With the score locked at 1-1 after
two-and-a-half hours of action, the
match moved to penalty kicks. Stanford
lost, 3-1.
"In that entire game, never once did
I see Carmel stop running," Sawyers
said. "There is just something in there
— she's not going to let us lose."

Senior midfielder Carmel Murphy does it all for Stanford's women soccer team, leading
the Cardinal both on and off the field.
Always modest, Murphy recalls
that match with pride. "It was
probably one of the best games I've
ever played," she said. "I wanted it
so bad. I was crushed when we
didn't win. We deserved to win. It
made me hungrier than ever to get

back (to the Final Four) now."
No matter the outcome of this
season, Murphy will be satisfied
with her four years at Stanford.
"As far as my soccer career goes,
this is the ultimate," Murphy said.
"I've had opportunities to play for
the national team, but that's not
what I've wanted. This is the far
thest I want to go, winning an
NCAA championship at Stan
ford."

Sawyers is certain that Murphy
will do all she can to help her team
reach that goal in her final run for
an NCAA title. "It has been great to
watch her develop," he said. "She
has been a superstar for a couple of
years — she is the real thing, just a
phenomenal package."
