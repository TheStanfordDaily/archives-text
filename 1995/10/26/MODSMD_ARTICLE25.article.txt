# Cardinal defends championship toppling top-ranked Wolverines
## Stanford women's swimming true No. 1 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
This past weekend, the sec
ond-ranked Stanford women's
swimming team rolled into the
Canham Natatorium at Michigan
and right over the top-ranked
Wolverines. The season-opener
placed Stanford coach Richard
Quick's 51-dual-meet winning
streak on the line against the
team expected to be the biggest
nemesis in the Cardinal's quest
for a fifth straight national cham
pionship.
Unlike last season, when the
Cardinal women sported a No. 1
ranking all year and were expect
ed to win every time they hit the
water, last Saturday, they were
the underdogs.
"It was good that they were
ranked ahead of us," said Stan-

championship crown.
ford captain Jane Skillman.
"Last year, it was always sort of
a lose-lose situation. If we won,
it was what was expected, and if
we lost, we looked bad."
Challenging the top-ranked
Wolverines in their home pool
did not daunt the Cardinal, how
ever. If anything, it gave Stan
ford more incentive to step up
and show that Stanford still
remains a force to be reckoned
with.
"Being the underdog gives us
more of an attacking feeling,"

Skillman said.
For the first meet of the sea
son, the Cardinal women were
both nervous and excited about
the challenge that lay before
them.
"We wanted to go in and
win," said senior Lisa Jacob.
"We expected the worst and
went prepared for a pretty big
fight.
When the fight was over, the
Cardinal emerged with a con
vincing victory. Though it was
close at the beginning, the
defending national champions
gradually pulled away. Stanford
placed first, second and third in
three events — the 200 meter
butterfly, 100 meter freestyle

and the 400 meter freestyle.
Meanwhile, Michigan could not
shut out the Cardinal in a single
race.
Individual winners included
junior Sarah Anderson in the
800 free and 200 fly; Jacob in
the 100 free, 200 free and 400
free; junior Claudia Franco in
the 50 free; junior Britt Mattern
in three meter diving; freshman
Kari Edwards in the 400 indi
vidual medley; freshman Chan
tal Rawn in the 200 IM; and
junior Megan Gardner in 10
meter diving. The Cardinal also
captured the 400 free relay
(Jacob, junior Jessica Tong,
junior Michelle Jesperson and
Franco); and the 800 free relay

(Skillman, Jacob, sophomore
Amy Oberhelm, and Anderson).
Though the impressive victo
ry might have surprised some, it
was what the Cardinal women
expected of themselves.
"It was not a surprise," Jacob
said. "We all knew we could win.
At the same time, we're not
going to let it get to our heads."
One of the most encouraging
aspects of the meet came from
the performance by the Cardinal
freshmen. Combining to place in
13 of the 24 events, the rookies
demonstrated that they can
make an immediate impact in a
big race. Emily Smith, Suzanne
Toledo, Edwards, Elin Austevoll,
Rawn and Jodi Jackson all post-

Ed top-three performances. Tole
do placed in five events, while
Austevoll, who will swim for
Norway in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, placed in three. Rawn
won the 200 IM, and Edwards
won the 100 IM.
"The whole freshman class
really stepped up," Skillman
said. "They had no fear."
Jacob turned in an impressive
performance of her own. After
suffering from sickness during
the NCAA Championships last
year, she started this season
with a bang. Not only did she
win her three individual events,
but she also swam on the victo
rious 400 and 800 free relay
teams.

"That was one of the best
meets I've ever seen a Stanford
team win," Skillman said. "Every
thing really seemed to come
together."
Despite the excitement sur
rounding the early victory, the
Cardinal women know that it is
just the first step towards their
ultimate goal of winning the
national championship. But to
begin on a high note makes it
easier for them to push them
selves as they endure the gruel
ing workouts they need to
repeat as champions.
"It felt really good to win like
that," Skillman said. "If nothing
else, it makes you that much
hungrier to train."

do placed in five events, while
Austevoll, who will swim for
Norway in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, placed in three. Rawn
won the 200 IM, and Edwards
won the 100 IM.
"The whole freshman class
really stepped up," Skillman
said. "They had no fear."
Jacob turned in an impressive
performance of her own. After
suffering from sickness during
the NCAA Championships last
year, she started this season
with a bang. Not only did she
win her three individual events,
but she also swam on the victo
rious 400 and 800 free relay
teams.

"That was one of the best
meets I've ever seen a Stanford
team win," Skillman said. "Every
thing really seemed to come
together."
Despite the excitement sur
rounding the early victory, the
Cardinal women know that it is
just the first step towards their
ultimate goal of winning the
national championship. But to
begin on a high note makes it
easier for them to push them
selves as they endure the gruel
ing workouts they need to
repeat as champions.
"It felt really good to win like
that," Skillman said. "If nothing
else, it makes you that much
hungrier to train."
