### John Fabian Staff writer 
This past weekend, the sec
ond-ranked Stanford women's
swimming team rolled into the
Canham Natatorium at Michigan
and right over the top-ranked
Wolverines. The season-opener
placed Stanford coach Richard
Quick's 51-dual-meet winning
streak on the line against the
team expected to be the biggest
nemesis in the Cardinal's quest
for a fifth straight national cham
pionship.
Unlike last season, when the
Cardinal women sported a No. 1
ranking all year and were expect
ed to win every time they hit the
water, last Saturday, they were
the underdogs.
"It was good that they were
ranked ahead of us," said Stan-

Cardinal women's swimming started the season with a splash, showing no intention of giving up the
championship crown.
