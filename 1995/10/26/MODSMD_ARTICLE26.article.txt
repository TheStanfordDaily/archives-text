# Field hockey visits Midwest for weekend
## NorPac champion Stanford takes show on the road to play in tourney 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
As the Northern Pacific Confer
ence champions, the Cardinal field
hockey team (9-4 overall, 5-1 Nor-
Pac) will try its luck this weekend in
the unfamiliar territory of the Mid
west Field Hockey Tournament.
The Stanford women travel to
St. Ijouis, Mo. this morning for
games on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday against three teams, St.
Louis, Davis and Elkins College in
West Virginia and Southwest Mis
souri.
These teams are of medium cal
iber and should pose no threat to
the Cardinal. "I really believe that
we should win all three games,"
said Stanford head coach Sheryl
Johnson. "Fve seen their records
and who they have played as far as
the rankings go, and we should
come back with three wins."
Since Stanford expects to receive
the lowest seed of the 12 squads
that enter the NCAA playoffs, the
Cardinal will most likely face a
team in the Midwest on the road.
However, according to Johnson,
whom Stanford plays will not be
determined until the week it sets ofT
for the NCAA Regional Champi
onships on Nov. 9.
The Midwest Field Hockey
Tournament will provide an oppor
tunity for the Cardinal to practice
without the protection of sunny
California skies.
This week, St. Ijouis has been
averaging temperatures in the 40s
and 50s whereas Palo AJto has hov
ered in the 60s and 70s — quite a
difference, especially in a skirt.

Stanford field hockey takes its brand of play to Amerca's heartland. Is Midwest field hockey ready foi
Cardinal field hockey?
"(The three teams] will bo
good competition," said senior
tri-captain Elise Morgan, who
plays center midfield. After a con
ference season against only two
teams, California and 0-6 Pacific,
Stanford will benefit from com

peting against teams with which
it is unfamiliar.
Stanford has never faced
Southwest Missouri or St. Louis
before, although the Cardinal did
play Davis and Elkins last year.
All three teams are Division I
teams and therefore their games
will count towards Stanford's
Division I record.
"(The tournament will be)
good preparation for the NCAAs,

since all three games are on turf,"
said assistant coach Tina Syer.
Stanford's first-round game in
the playoffs will likely take place
on artificial turf as well.
No players will remain at
home due to injury. All will fly to
St. Louis for the competition and
will return late Sunday night a
bit more weathered and with a
little more experience under their
belts.
