# Men's golf falters at Olympic Invite
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf
team followed up its season
opening triumph at Northwest
ern with a frustrating sixth
place showing at the Bay Area's
Olympic Invitational this week.
"There is no excuse or expla
nation," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "We simply did not
perform as well as we should
have. We did not belong in sixth
place in this field."
A rough third round knocked
the Cardinal out of contention.
The team occupied third place
going into the final 18 but
struggled at the No. 4 and No. 5
spots to wind up sixth overall.
West Coast rival Pepperdine
put together a strong outing to
take the team title.
"The bottom just fell out for
us that last round," Goodwin
said. "It made it really tough
for us to do anything.
"It was awesome for Pepper
dine to play so well. They are a
great young team with a great
coach. If we had performed
closer to our normal level on
the third round, we might have

been able to contend with them
though."
The Cardinal struggled from
top to bottom throughout the
tournament. Sophomore All-
American Tiger Woods led the
team, tying for sixth place over
all with a 54-hole total of 218.
Woods had just captured a play
off win last weekend at the
Savane Invitational, which fea
tures some of the best collegiate
players in the nation.
"Tiger played well, but he
never really got it going," Good
win said.
Freshman Joel Kribel, play
ing as the Cardinal's No. 2
man, finished in a tie for 24th.
Inexperience as a collegiate
player created minor problems
for Kribel as he struggled in the
second round with double
bogeys on holes 15 and 17.
"He's got a whole new type
of pressure on him," Goodwin
said. "He was the best player in
America as a junior, but playing
in that arena isn't the same as
playing on a team like Stanford.
There's an enormous pressure
not to let your teammates down
and most freshmen are going to
have some problems adjusting to
that."
Team captain Jerry Chang
started slowly but showed his
usual resilience by coming back

strong in the final two rounds
with scores of 80, 73 and 75.
Chang, who competed in the
Savane tournament as well,
wound up in a tie for 30th.
"Jerry's a tough kid," Good
win said. "His play was so typical
of him. Once he gets himself
organized and past the first
round, he's usually one of the
most competitive players out

there."
Junior Conrad Ray and senior
Pete Ligotti rounded out Stan
ford's performance. Both strug
gled to find a rhythm on what may
have been the most difficult course
the Cardinal faces this year.
"A lot of this fall and winter
will be a wild skirmish to estab
lish our No. 4 and No. 5 guys,"
Goodwin said. "The guys are all

really talented though, so hope
fully come March, we'll feel a bit
more comfortable at those
spots."
While the Cardinal's showing
was in no way poor, it definitely
highlighted areas in need of
improvement.
"Our finish was simply a
result of our play," Goodwin said.
"There were no mitigating fac

tors. The weather was beautiful,
the course conditions were tough
but good and the competition was
in no way over our heads. There
is simply a lot of room for
improvement and a lot of work
that needs to be done if we want
to be in the running when
NCAAs come around.
"We'll get it done though.
