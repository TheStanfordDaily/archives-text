# Men's golf falters at Olympic Invite
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf
team followed up its season
opening triumph at Northwest
ern with a frustrating sixth
place showing at the Bay Area's
Olympic Invitational this week.
"There is no excuse or expla
nation," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "We simply did not
perform as well as we should
have. We did not belong in sixth
place in this field."
A rough third round knocked
the Cardinal out of contention.
The team occupied third place
going into the final 18 but
struggled at the No. 4 and No. 5
spots to wind up sixth overall.
West Coast rival Pepperdine
put together a strong outing to
take the team title.
"The bottom just fell out for
us that last round," Goodwin
said. "It made it really tough
for us to do anything.
"It was awesome for Pepper
dine to play so well. They are a
great young team with a great
coach. If we had performed
closer to our normal level on
the third round, we might have

been able to contend with them
though."
The Cardinal struggled from
top to bottom throughout the
tournament. Sophomore All-
American Tiger Woods led the
team, tying for sixth place over
all with a 54-hole total of 218.
Woods had just captured a play
off win last weekend at the
Savane Invitational, which fea
tures some of the best collegiate
players in the nation.
"Tiger played well, but he
never really got it going," Good
win said.
Freshman Joel Kribel, play
ing as the Cardinal's No. 2
man, finished in a tie for 24th.
Inexperience as a collegiate
player created minor problems
for Kribel as he struggled in the
second round with double
bogeys on holes 15 and 17.
"He's got a whole new type
of pressure on him," Goodwin
said. "He was the best player in
America as a junior, but playing
in that arena isn't the same as
playing on a team like Stanford.
There's an enormous pressure
not to let your teammates down
