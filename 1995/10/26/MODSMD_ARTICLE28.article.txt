The Stanford men's crew team
will return to its home front for the
Head of Estuary in Oakland, Calif,
this Sunday after competing in the
Head of Charles in Boston, Mass.
last weekend.
The Cardinal hopes for an
improved performance following its
last race, in which a run-in with
another boat cost both time and the
placement Stanford wanted.
Although disappointed in the
results of the Boston regatta, the
team feels it performed well in gen
eral and expects a strong season.
The Head of Charles even serves as
a motivator for the upcoming race,
where the squad will receive the
opportunity to prove itself.
"[The men| know [they] can pro
duce very good speed," said head
coach Wieslaw Kujda. "They have a
desire to go faster coming off the
Head of Charles."
Senior rower Grant Dawson
affirmed Kujda's words. "We didn't
feel we had our best race [at the
Head of Charles], but we still were
doing really well [before the acci
dent]," he said. "We expect to race
well [on Sundayl."
Even more inspiring is the
desire to beat California, the Cardi
nal's main competitor in the Head
of Estuary. After defeating the
Bears in some of the Cal Head

pieces two weeks ago, Stanford fin
ished a full 30 seconds behind its
arch rival last week.
The Cardinal will again attempt
to match speed with Cal this Sun
day. Other boats participating in
the regatta will come from other
West Coast schools.
While the men's first boat
attends the Head of Estuary, the
second and third boats will row in
the Head of the American injSacra
mento this weekend. The women's
crew team will compete in the
Head of Estua'ry this Sunday,
although its focus will be on small
er boats, consisting of two or four
rowers instead of the typical eight.
The boat wfciich Stanford will
send to Oakland will consist of the
same rowers •that competed in the
Head of Charles. This group,
through racing and practicing
together, has finally clicked and
performs well as a whole.
Although will tell,
Stanford possesses Jhe necessary
confidence and rowing ability for a
successful season. If, as Kujda has
stressed, the team's aggression
remains high and it learns to antic
ipate and make quick decisions,
then the Cardinal can expect to go
far this year.
"I think we're going to have a
great season this year," Dawson
said. "As a total squad, we're really
solid and really deep. I think we'll
do well because of that depth."
