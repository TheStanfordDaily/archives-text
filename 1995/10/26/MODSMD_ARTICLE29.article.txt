# District qualifiers on sailors' horizon
## 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
In hopes of qualifying for the
Coed Singlehanded National
Championships, which will take
place Nov. 17-19, at least six mem
bers of the Stanford sailing team
will head down to Santa Cruz this
weekend to race in their district's
singlehanded championships, host
ed by the Banana Slugs.
Freshmen Tyler Doyle and
Steve Kleha, sophomores Danny
Zimbaldi and John Meade, junior
Alice Manard and senior Adam
Lowry will definitely sail for the
Cardinal. Others may join them
depending on how many boats
Stanford can manage to take down
to Santa Cruz. At the qualifier,
each school races in its own boats.
The more boats a school can bring,
the more sailors it can enter. Head
coach Steve Bourdow is shooting
for nine boats.
Zimbaldi, Meade, Lowry and
Manard are all experienced when it

comes to qualifying regattas. Last
year Zimbaldi, Meade and Lowry
each performed competently, and
this year Bourdow would like to see
all three place higher. Manard has
already competed in a qualifier ear
lier in the season for the Women's
Singlehanded Nationals, which she
participated in last weekend.
Kleha and Doyle are the only
newcomers. Bourdow, however,
has equal amounts of faith in each
sailor's individual potential and
ability to sail.
"More important than the
amount of experience we have
going into the regatta are the con
ditions under which we will sail,"
Bourdow said. "Different sailors
perform well under different condi
tions. For example, Lowry will
dominate if there are heavy winds,
yet these conditions will give a
sailor like Manard a hard time. It
will be interesting to see how each
sailor adjusts to the conditions."
