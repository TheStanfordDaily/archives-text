### David Stein 
Members of the senior class
mingled with University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and other
administrators yesterday at an in
formal gathering organized by the
senior class presidents.
In addition to talking in a re
laxed atmosphere with Casper on
topics ranging from overseas stud
ies to sea kayaking, seniors lis
tened to the president speak
briefly on their future after Stan
ford.
"I have one wish as you gradu
ate and continue on with your
lives: that you are very success
ful," Casper said. "I hope that you
sense that new beginnings begin
all the time."
Because the senior class en
tered Stanford at the same time
Casper became University presi
dent in 1992, he also expressed a
strong t ie to the Class of '96.
"There never will be a class {is
closely linked as this one to me,"
Casper said.
While many took the opportu
nity to speak directly with the
president, other seniors attended
the first-time event just to see old
friends and meet new ones in a
laid-back environment complete
with catered food and live piano
music in the Oak West Room at
Tresidder.
"We wanted to provide the se
niors with the opportunity to open

up and relax," said Senior Class
President Sarah Cranston. "We
wanted students to get to know
students they haven't known be
fore."
In fact, many who attended
commented that they had a "pos
itive impression" of the class'
focus on unity and were excited at
their last year of being under
graduates.
Students also had a chance to
learn more about the Senior Gift, a
part of the Stanford Fund which
provides money for financial aid,
scholarships, ethnic centers and
teaching.
"The goal of the Class of '96 is
to raise $200,000. I.ast year, they
raised 52 percent of that; this year
we're going for 96 percent," said
Ryan Rskin, one of the four chairs
of the '96 Senior (till.
Cranston was pleased with the
turn-out at the event, noting that
it provided a different "academic
type, non-alcoholic" atmosphere
compared to other senior events
such as Pub Night.
