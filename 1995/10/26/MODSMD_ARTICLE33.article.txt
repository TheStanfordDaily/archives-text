## Crichton's new dino-book offers more of the same 
### Seth Goldstein 
With a title
like "The
Lost
World," I'm tempt
ed to write that
Michael Crichton's
latest book should
have remained lost.
It is a sequel to his
best-selling "Juras-

sic Park" and a bla
tant attempt to reap even more rewards from
the dinosaur mania spawned by the original
and its conversion into a feature film. There are
some major plot flaws — Crichton probably
wrote it so quickly that he didn't stop to think
parts through — and some scenes and charac
ters arc obviously designed to be translated
into a movie. In theory, it is a deplorable book.
In practice, however, it works. "The Lost
World," "Jurassic Park" and all of Crichton's
other books aren't intended to be great works
of art. They're supposed to be entertaining.
" The Lost World" achieves that goal. Like all
sequels, it's not as good as the original, but it's
acceptable. If you loved "Jurassic Park," you'll

like "The Lost World." If you liked "Jurassic
Park," you'll probably enjoy "The Lost
World."
Six years after the disaster at Jurassic Park,
mathematician lan Malcolm (played by Jeff
Goldblum in the movie) is slill trying to for
get that it ever happened. However, due to a
large resurgence in the number of unex
plained reptile sightings in Costa Rica and
the constant badgering of an obsessed pale
ontologist named Richard Levine, Malcolm
is forced to admit either that some creatures
managed to survive the destruction of the
park or, worse, that a "lost world" where di
nosaurs still rule has been left over from the
prehistoric age.
When Levine disappears while exploring
in Costa Rica, Malcolm feels compelled to in
vestigate. Along with an engineer, an animal
expert, a mechanic and a couple of stowaway
kids, Malcolm tracks Levine to an island off
the coast.
There they find not only Levine, but also
— surprise, surprise — a secret dinosaur
making facility that no one knew about until
now. Apparently, Jurassic Park's owner, John

Hammond, actually created the beasties on
this island before moving them to the park.
(Incidentally, for those of you who have only
seen the film, Hammond, who survives the
"Jurassic Park" movie, gets eaten in the book
version.)
After finding Levine, the group must fend
off the always-hungry dinosaurs and get to a
rendezvous point where they will be picked
up by a helicopter at a certain time. Their
predicament is made worse by the fact the
Lewis Dodgson, the unscrupulous bio-engi
neer who attempted to buy dinosaur em
bryos in "Jurassic Park," has followed them to
the island and is riling up all the surprisingly
motherly dinosaurs by stealing their eggs.
Their attempt at escape is filled with ac
tion, suspense and vivid descriptions of the
prehistoric monsters. Besides the tyran
nosaurs and velociraptors, Crichton adds an
other frightening predator which was not
present in the first book. It's quite interesting,
actually, and should make a decent part of
the flick when they get around to the in
evitable movie production.
But besides the excitement, there's a

bunch of crap that must be swallowed, too.
First, Crichton never bothers to explain why
the island was abandoned, why it wasn't de
stroyed when it was abandoned or why it
took six years for people to find it again.
That's a fairly big hole in the plot.
Second, the two nerdy tag-along kids are a
gratuitous addition to the expedition. Crich
ton is pandering to the large number of di
nosaur-crazed kiddies he hopes will come to
see the movie version.
Finally, the reader has to put up with all
the technophobic hyperbabble and specula
tive garbage that has come to characterize
virtually all of Crichton's work. Technology
— bad. Progress — bad. Mankind's inherent
curiosity and incessant need to explore —
bad. Read too much and you'll start to believe
that Crichton's the Unaßomber. (I wonder if
the FBI has checked out that lead.)
Despite these problems and its mass-mar
keting approach, "The Lost World" is still an
entertaining book. It's not a world-changer,
but if you have some free time (I realize that's
a stretch for most students), it's a pleasant
way to while away the hours.
