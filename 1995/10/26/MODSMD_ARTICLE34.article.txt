# The 						Best of Times:
## Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia" explores poetry in motion

Thomasina: "When you stir rice pud
ding, Septimus, the spoonful of jam
spread* itself round making red trails
like the picture of a meteor in my astronomical
atlas. Hut if you stir backward, the jam will not
come together again. Indeed, the pudding does
not notice and continues to turn pmk just as be
fore. lh) you think this is odd?"
I iving life in Turn Stoppard's newest plav
"Arcadia' is like stirring jam into rice pud
ding: A wonderful intricate pattern emerges
but it is hard to understand all the twisting
permutations, fry ing to explain the pattern is
impossible and pointless — it won't make the
pudding taste am better and the pudding will
go cold.
And so it is with life, Stoppard would have
us believe. I here is no answer to existence,
only the struggle to find one.
1 ating the pudding is no guarantee that
you will be able to describe how it tastes.

Ihe American Conservatory I heater
opened its 1995 96 season October 1 Sth with
the West t oast premiere of "Arcadia." The
play, directed by the conservatory's artistic di
rector (iarey Perloff, will run for eight weeks
at the Stage 1 >oor Theater in San Francisco.
I ord Byron, the Second Law of Thermo
dynamics and garden landscaping are among
the topics under consideration in Stoppard's
play. It seems an unlikely mix but the author
weaves them skillfully together, never forget
ting the idiosyncrasies and humor of life, and
thus creates truly absorbing theater.
"Arcadia" is played in two time periods
nearly 200 years apart, by two sets of charac
ters in the same stately home in the English
countryside. The first period, set in 1809, ce
nters on the fortunes of Septimus Hodge,
mathematician and literary critic, as he tu
tors, smooth talks and makes love to the vari
ous inhabitants of the ('.rumb household. I lie
second period, set in the present, exposes the
contorted relationship of two academics —
1 lannah Jarvis, biographer of ( aroline 1 amb
(Byron's mistress) and Bernard Nightingale,
her literary reviewer and scholarly rival — as
they attempt to reconstruct the events ot
1809.
The opening scene takes us to 1 NO 1 ) and the
schoolroom of the precocious 13-year-old
Thomasina (loverly (Tina Jones). The stage is
formal but bare: the floor, suggestive of the
play's central theme, is a complete circle of in
terwoven wooden parquet tiles. T he only fur
nishings are a large oval desk, two upright
chairs, a telescope and a podium.
The scale, however, is grandiose — huge
French windows with ivy framing the out
side and two huge doors evoking high ceil
ings and space. Painted in a wash of pale
green, the overall impression is one of un
derstated and timeless elegance — an at
tribute which is crucial as the set remains
unchanged for both past and present
worlds.

\\ it and womlrr
As the lights go up, a beautifully staged
tableau appears. Thomasina sits on the floor,
dwarfed by the huge table behind her. Pen and
paper rest in her lap. Her tutor, Septimus
Hodge (Daniel Cantor), sits on an upright
chair at the table, leisurely perusing a tome.
The characters establish themselves in
minutes — the young Miss Coverly, drawing
figures in the air with her pen, asks in her
most innocent voice: "Septimus, what is car
nal embrace?" Her tutor, amusing himself
with his own sharp-mindedness, responds:
"Carnal embrace is the practice of throwing
one's arms around a side ot beef. The audi
ence begins to laugh.
Throughout the play this witty twosome
are constantly interrupted by the other mem
bers of the household. One that deserves par
ticular note is Lady (Tumb ( Kimberly King).
Ciiven some of the funniest lines in the play,
the actress adds to them a haughty flirtatious
ness and a wonderful sense of timing to draw
out the maximum comic effect.
In one of the later scenes, for instance, she
discusses with Septimus the dress code of a
more "liberated" married guest. "Does she
wear drawers?" asks Lady (>umb. "She does,"
replies Septimus — he knows from experi
ence. Her ladyship considers the response,
wafts her taffeta skirts and with a knowing
look, replies, "Yes, I have heard that drawers
are being worn now. It is unnatural for women
to be got up like jockeys. I cannot approve."
The characters of the 20th century often
appear a little overdrawn in their more mod
ern setting. The rather over-the top acting ot
Bernard Nightingale ((iraham Beckel), for in

stance, succeeds in evoking echoes of the past,
hut lacks variety or an element of finesse.
A more individual personage is created by
Katherine Borowit/ who plays the intelligent,
often acerbic hut very attractive I lannah Jarvis.
She never lets the arrogant Nightingale nor the
impudent Valentine— an Oxford post gradu
ate doing biology, and soon to be lord of the
manor — off the hook. Playing a rather uptight
Hmma Thompson-esque type of character,
Borowit/ brings naivete, whimsy and humor to
her role: "Sex and literature. Literature and sex.
Your conversation, left to itself, doesn't have
many places to go," she tells Bernard, after he
propositions her to a weekend in London.
I'octic rqiialions
A central mechanism of the play is to jux
tapose opposites — the most striking one
being the constant movement from the past
to the present. This is successfully achieved in
the A.( :.T. production by several lovely direc
torial touches which produce very smooth
and artistic transitions — at the close of one
scene, for instance, a character abruptly snaps
shut a book in time with the stage going dark.
The landscaped garden is another location
where apparent opposites converge: It is a
palimpsest of artistic styles, ranging from
Italian formalism to the more modern pic
turesque. The mathematical equations in the
play function on a similar plane. Stoppard
employs the elaborate theories as a metaphor
for the wider themes of the play.
For example, mathematics (equated with
reason) is not divorced from the poetic (a
symbol of the romantic mind): I'homasina
attests, "It there is an equation for a curve like
a bell, there must be an equation for one like

>1 bluebell, and it a bluebell, why not a rose?"
Similarly, the playwright uses the Second
l aw of Thermodynamics (which states that
the universe is growing cold — entropy —
and contradicts the Newtonian universe in
which time does not play any role) to redefine
his own artistic perception of time. Valentine
sums up the result: "everything is mixing the
same way, all the time, irreversibly ... till
there's no time left. That's what time means."
Tin- rifihl notes
Valentine: "You start guessing what the tune
might he. You try to pick it out of the noise. You
try this, you try that. you start to get something
it's half-haked hut you start putting in notes
which are missing or not quite the right notes.''
The last scene, lit in a soft half light, ends
"Arcadia" with an appealing beauty and mag
ical power. For the only occasion in the pro
duction, the two time scales are played out si
multaneously. Several subtle touches by the
director add poignancy. At one instant, for
example, 1 lannah and Septimus read through
a text, delicately turning the pages together.
At another, Septimus occupies the seat she
has only vacated seconds before.
The last moments bring the play to a poet
ic close. Two couples — Septimus and
Thomasina, Hannah and Gus (the mute
brother of Valentine, played by (Christopher
Hickman) — waltz in circles around the
stage. The music builds, language is lost. Our
last vision is of motion — two distinct atoms,
swirling in irregular regularity. Stoppard's
unique "tune" is resonant, yet the audience
needs to listen carefully if they are to pick out
the right notes.
