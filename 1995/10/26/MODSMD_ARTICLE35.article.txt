# Not just another pretty blonde
## Johnette Napolitano explores new terrain with Pretty and Twisted 
### Travis Vigil 
Pretty and Twisted is not (Concrete Blonde
take two. Granted, Pretty and Twisted is
Johnette Napolitanos — former (Con
crete Blonde singer / bassist / songwriter —
new band. And as always, Napolitano s voice
is unmistakably distinct and her songs and
lyrics are similarly dark and mystical. But
Pretty and twisted is a band with Napoli
tano's new vision.
Many people, fans and critics alike, were
shocked that Napolitano chose to leave
and in the process disband — (Concrete
Blonde. So in late l c »4, follow mg the success
and praise of five albums, the band's farewell
tour and subsequent break-up came as a
huge surprise.
"I'd had ideas tor a long time of my own
that I just wanted to exercise," Napolitano
says."I wanted to manifest what I was hear
ing in my head for a long time and it wasn't
what Concrete Blonde was doing. It jlist
wasn't."
After roaming Hurope for a couple of
months following the break-up, Napolitano
decided to get back into recording. Along
with Marc Moreland, ex-Wall of Voodoo
guitarist, and drummer Danny Mont
gomery, Napolitano has taken a more tex
tural approach to music. "The sound that
I'm after is less notes and more atmosphere;
more sonic painting, more surrounding you
with a mood," says Napolitano. In fact,
Moreland dubbed the band "Pretty and
Twisted," alluding to the atmospheric mood
of the music.
Fortunately, the band was able to capture
this feeling on their debut release on
Warner Bros. Records. Napolitano's
beautiful, pained voice still successfully
weaves stories of frustration and tear.
However, Morcland's guitar adds an en
tirely new dimension to these lyrics. In
comparison to Jim Mankey — the guitar
virtuoso of Concrete Blonde — Moreland

successfully creates landscapes of sound as
opposed to concise, technically proficient
rifts.
Napolitano has also begun to approach
the actual recording process as a significant
step to reach the end result of a finished
album. In addition to her usual roles, she ac
tually functioned as the producer on the
Pretty and Twisted release.
"I've got a studio in my house now, so I'm
able to just wander in and experiment and
mess around,' says Napolitano. "It's really
112 reed me up. Its made my life much better. As
far as creativity, you can really run with an
idea when you have it as opposed to having to
remember it or stash it or, you know, go
through the whole rigmarole of booking stu
dio time and getting there and getting your
crap there. And, you know, it interrupts your
flow."
With the easy access to her studio equip
ment, recording has become an evolutionary
process for Napolitano. Instead of one big
chunk of time in the studio, she is able to
record bits and pieces at various times, day
or night. Because of this fact, her albums de
velop over months instead of days in the stu
dio.
"1 like to do things a little at a time all the
time. And then at the end of the year or
whenever I'm supposed to go in for the
record, I'll kind of look and see where it's
at," explains Napolitano. "If there's any
thing I can see as far as a character or a
sound developing or taking shape in the
work that I've done lately... [I'll| see if it
looks like an album is coming out of it. And
it it is, then you just kind of polish up and
work on the loose edges and then maybe fill
it in.
"The very existence of the music gives you
an idea. It almost, like, fuels itself, you know,"
she continues. "It I have six or seven things
done, then I think, 'Okay this all makes
sense.' Then. .. you look at it in the big pic
ture as a whole album and then you decide
what is needed... to round it out."

Wlulc Napolitano
is hesitant to
admit that her
lyrics dwell on the
dark, mystical
scenery that
they seem to
portray, she
does ac
knowledge
her difficul
ty in writing
them. While
in Concrete
Blonde, she
wrote the
Ivrics to "loey
— the hit single
of! ot "Bloodlet
ting" — in a taxi on
the last day of the
recording session. I low
ever, with Pretty and Twist
ed, it has been easier for
Napolitano to write.
"lor some reason, I find the process
getting easier. But I don't do it often. I write
words when I absolutely have to," Napolitano
says, "(ienerally the music will be done first.
I almost always finish music first and then I'll
sit down and listen to it over and over and
over again or just make a work tape with
everything I 'm working on and walk around
the house doing dishes or whatever it is tli.it
one does and then you find yourself singing
along with it and something starts to form."
In fact, while in the past Napolitano has
found lyric writing the most strenuous part
of making music, she has taken a new posi
tive attitude towards writing.
"You have to get an idea across in the next
two lines. So you have to really find out how to
get the idea across in the next two lines using
the best sounding words that you can,*' she
says. "You get into these mathematical type of
things which is the challenge of it to me— lyric
writing, you know. You singa melody 'la, la* la,

fa in your
head, but then
you have to come up
with words, but the Words have to have the
same flow as your babbling.'
Pretty and Twisted finished a tour earlier
this tall. Unfortunately, touring again
took it's toll on Moreland's psyche. In
fact, he's not sure whether or not he will con
tinue with the hand. Napolitano herself is
even unsure ot just how long this new project
will last. After the last Concrete Blonde
album, she wdi> hesitant to even continue in
the music business:. Ill fact,she says that it is
a question she ponders "each and every day
of her life," even now. But she will stay with
Pretty and Twisted for at least the next two
years. After that, she is not sure where she will
end up. She s.iys she'd like to go back to
school or teach. But until that time, we are
lucky enough to have a multi-dimensional
and well-rounded musician producing and
writing great music.

of making music, she has taken a new posi
tive attitude towards writing.
"You have to get an idea across in the next
two lines. So you have to really find out how to
get the idea across in the next two lines using
the best sounding words that you can,*' she
says. "You get into these mathematical type of
things which is the challenge of it to me— lyric
writing, you know. You singa melody 'la, la* la,

fa in your
head, but then
you have to come up
with words, but the Words have to have the
same flow as your babbling.'
Pretty and Twisted finished a tour earlier

took it's toll on Moreland's psyche. In

even unsure ot just how long this new project
will last. After the last Concrete Blonde
album, she wdi> hesitant to even continue in
the music business:. Ill fact,she says that it is
a question she ponders "each and every day
of her life," even now. But she will stay with
Pretty and Twisted for at least the next two
years. After that, she is not sure where she will
end up. She s.iys she'd like to go back to
school or teach. But until that time, we are
lucky enough to have a multi-dimensional
and well-rounded musician producing and
writing great music.

Pretty and Twisted is not (Concrete Blonde
take two. Granted, Pretty and Twisted is
Johnette Napolitanos — former (Con
crete Blonde singer / bassist / songwriter —
new band. And as always, Napolitano s voice
is unmistakably distinct and her songs and
lyrics are similarly dark and mystical. But
Pretty and twisted is a band with Napoli
tano's new vision.
Many people, fans and critics alike, were
shocked that Napolitano chose to leave
and in the process disband — (Concrete
Blonde. So in late l c »4, follow mg the success
and praise of five albums, the band's farewell
tour and subsequent break-up came as a
huge surprise.
"I'd had ideas tor a long time of my own
that I just wanted to exercise," Napolitano
says."I wanted to manifest what I was hear
ing in my head for a long time and it wasn't
what Concrete Blonde was doing. It jlist
wasn't."
After roaming Hurope for a couple of
months following the break-up, Napolitano
decided to get back into recording. Along
with Marc Moreland, ex-Wall of Voodoo
guitarist, and drummer Danny Mont
gomery, Napolitano has taken a more tex
tural approach to music. "The sound that
I'm after is less notes and more atmosphere;
more sonic painting, more surrounding you
with a mood," says Napolitano. In fact,
Moreland dubbed the band "Pretty and
Twisted," alluding to the atmospheric mood
of the music.
Fortunately, the band was able to capture
this feeling on their debut release on
Warner Bros. Records. Napolitano's
beautiful, pained voice still successfully
weaves stories of frustration and tear.
However, Morcland's guitar adds an en
tirely new dimension to these lyrics. In
comparison to Jim Mankey — the guitar
virtuoso of Concrete Blonde — Moreland

successfully creates landscapes of sound as
opposed to concise, technically proficient
rifts.
Napolitano has also begun to approach
the actual recording process as a significant
step to reach the end result of a finished
album. In addition to her usual roles, she ac
tually functioned as the producer on the
Pretty and Twisted release.
"I've got a studio in my house now, so I'm
able to just wander in and experiment and
mess around,' says Napolitano. "It's really
112 reed me up. Its made my life much better. As
far as creativity, you can really run with an
idea when you have it as opposed to having to
remember it or stash it or, you know, go
through the whole rigmarole of booking stu
dio time and getting there and getting your
crap there. And, you know, it interrupts your
flow."
With the easy access to her studio equip
ment, recording has become an evolutionary
process for Napolitano. Instead of one big
chunk of time in the studio, she is able to
record bits and pieces at various times, day
or night. Because of this fact, her albums de
velop over months instead of days in the stu
dio.
"1 like to do things a little at a time all the
time. And then at the end of the year or
whenever I'm supposed to go in for the
record, I'll kind of look and see where it's
at," explains Napolitano. "If there's any
thing I can see as far as a character or a
sound developing or taking shape in the
work that I've done lately... [I'll| see if it
looks like an album is coming out of it. And
it it is, then you just kind of polish up and
work on the loose edges and then maybe fill
it in.
"The very existence of the music gives you
an idea. It almost, like, fuels itself, you know,"
she continues. "It I have six or seven things
done, then I think, 'Okay this all makes
sense.' Then. .. you look at it in the big pic
ture as a whole album and then you decide
what is needed... to round it out."

Wlulc Napolitano
is hesitant to

lyrics dwell on the
dark, mystical
scenery that
they seem to
portray, she
does ac

her difficul
ty in writing
them. While
in Concrete
Blonde, she
wrote the
Ivrics to "loey
— the hit single
of! ot "Bloodlet
ting" — in a taxi on
the last day of the
recording session. I low
ever, with Pretty and Twist
ed, it has been easier for
Napolitano to write.
"lor some reason, I find the process
getting easier. But I don't do it often. I write
words when I absolutely have to," Napolitano
says, "(ienerally the music will be done first.
I almost always finish music first and then I'll
sit down and listen to it over and over and
over again or just make a work tape with
everything I 'm working on and walk around
the house doing dishes or whatever it is tli.it
one does and then you find yourself singing
along with it and something starts to form."
