# Justine Frischmann's connection: a newfound obsession with fame
## Elastica 
### 
I am surprised at first sight of Justine
Frischmann, lead singer and guitarist
for British retro-pop sensation F.lastica.
Arriving early at the Phoenix Motel in San
Francisco for my interview, 1 decide to
head for the bathroom. Kill some time, you
know, make a more suitable entrance on
the dot of 2:30. I am off-guard, a tad star
tled by my surroundings — the under
stuffed black vinyl couches in the lobby, the
shag carpet beneath my feet, the chipping
flamingo-pink paint, the seedy glam of it
all. Even the tiny, shimmering pool in the
concrete and asphalt courtyard, kidney
shaped .uul patterned, shrieks rock star re
sort. The place is all sham, though, affected
and overblown, as if the years spent hous
ing nomadic rock and rollers has cast a
sheen of kitsch along its walls.
On the way to the men's room, through
the dilapidated trendiness of "Miss Pearl's
lam House," I spot Justine sitting at a patio
table giving an interview by the pool. Sur
rounded on three sides by a camera crew
and an interviewer, she seems at ease, even
charmed by the whole mess. But that isn't
what surprises me. I can't help but be star
tled, as I step into the darkness of the aban
doned bar, by how familiar she looks. I he
heavy eyebrows, the raked shag ol her hair,
the angular, severe lines of her jaw. All the
press photos and interview snippets I've
ever seen come to mind. For some reason,
I thought she'd look different in person,
the oddly awkward real life face of a media

bound celebrity.
I haven't expected her to look so.. . well,
real. I expected some sleight-of-hand,
some trickery, something like the lost-era
glamour of the Phoenix Motel, the squalid
comfort of truth somehow hoaxed by
fame.
Checking the typed schedule she holds
in her hands, band manager Kate Hamson
tells me that I will be interviewing Justin.
Ah, the drummer. The unknown face ol
F.lastica, Justin Welch, only commands in
terest as the sole male member in the band.
I thank Hamson as politely as I can, facing
the task of trying to spruce up a otherwise
grade-B interview prospect. I'm sure Justin
is a fine person and would probably make a
Fine interviewee, but anyone who has heard
Justine's coy and intimate tremor of a voice
cannot help but want to hear it directed
solely towards them.
I settle into a pool chair behind a pitted,
white patio table in the shade, pull out my
list ol questions and begin madly to revise.
Only the most insipid and cliched ol
queries spring to mind: "What's it like
being a boy in .1 girl band?" etc.
Across the way, .1 phalanx of leather-clad
roadies drink beer and smoke cigarettes by
the pool. At the next table, an over hipped
forty something from KOMI .brandishing
her high-tech recording equipment like a
(iucci bag sets up. She gels to interview
lead guitarist Donna Matthews. Mean
while, I lamson, band manager, kindly lets

me know that lustin will be out "any
minute."
Matthews emerges from her room,
overslept and groggy, looking cherubic and
impish at once. She's tiny, with oily, slept
-011 blond hair, fly-eyed wrap-arounds and
polity lips, permanently pursed. She mut
ters something in incomprehensible I.on
donese and begins to eat a fried egg sand
wich. KOMI' waves to her from where she
sits and Donna cringes a little.
I 'm liking her already.
At this point, lustine notices me sitting
alone. She walks over, saying to Hamson
over her shoulder, "I can just do this one, if
Justin is still getting ready."
Abruptly broken from cloying self-pity,
I notice Hamson wonderfully raise her
hand and allow it.
"Unless of course you would rather have
lustin," Justine says, speaking to me for the
first time, her voice devoid of sarcasm,
kind and absolutely lovely.
Umm, let me think. "No this will be
fine," I say.
cc ■y really like it here," lustine tells me,
I raising her face to the sun. "I think
JLit's one of the few places in the
States where I could live."
I can only agree. It's one of those perfect
davs, the sky .1 flawless blue, the air warm,
free of San Francisco's habitual fall after
noon chill.
"It's a lot more fun touring here

than it is touring at
home," she goes on.
"It's more exotic."
Justine's got
more than one reason to
be glad to be out of her
own country. Her prob
lems with British
tabloid press began
back in 1993 when
weekly papers NMI and
Melody Maker got wind
of her newly formed
band. Recently severed
from Suede (and from
Suede's lead singer Brett
Anderson), Justine re
cruited Justin Welch,
bassist Annie Holland
and guitarist Donna
Matthews. The notori
ous weeklies thought
they'd hit on press-stop-

ping potential.
Justine puts it this way: "The problem
with those papers is that everything is ei
ther superlatives or people being absolute
ly slaughtered. It's either this band is the
greatest band ever, ever, and they sound
like all the best bands you've ever heard of,
or three weeks later they're absolutely shit.
It's dreadful."
The effect was to intimidate and quiet
the band. "You just know that you're sick ot
the sight of yourself," Justine tells me, "so
everyone else must be sick of the sight ot
you. I think the only way to survive it is to
just put stuff out when you've got some
thing you really want to put out for the fans
or whatever, do a minimum of press and
fuck off again."
I look over at the other interview, won
dering if the U.S. brand of journalism is
much different. I )onna Matthews stuffs the
rest of her sandwich while the KOMI
woman assures her while nodding over at
us, "I just really like you guys a lot."
Satisfied by the middle-aged hipster's
kiss ass tactics and emboldened by my own
reticent credibility, I revel in the mean
spirited moment. Justine, however, grace
fully acknowledges the compliment with a
small and unflaggingly sincere smile.
Elastica's self-titled debut came out
last March, and thousands of copies
later, hit singles "Connection" and
"Stutter" still restlessly boomerang in and

out of buzz bin and radio rotation lists,
lustine appreciates the attention, attribut
ing our obsession with their brand of
trashy backwards-looking pop to national
taste. "I think this country is definitely
sort of built for rock — the idea of electric
guitar being built into the nation as a kind
of staple diet. I find it really touching the
way you can go into a truck stop and
they're playing Aerosmith, do you know
what 1 mean?"
Garth Brooks, more like, I think. 1 can't
argue, though. The way she intersperses
charmingly precise BBC-speak with her
unnervingly evocative "do you know what
1 mean?" absolutely slays me.
"In Britain," she tells me, "On Radio 3 or
something, it's all Barry Manilow and the
equivalent."
The recent loss of a member, bassist
Annie Holland, hasn't kept the band from
touring back and forth across the States re
peatedly in the past few months. Justine
places a carefully positive light on Hol
land's departure. "It's kind of quite good
when things like that happen and you get
forced to look at your band and think,
'where are we going?' " Looking forward to
incorporating dance loops and more key
hoarding into their next album, Justine
adds "We were moving in a little different
direction and Annie wasn't. She definitely
didn't want to do a disco song."
Despite shifting membership, Elastica
competently stood in for Sinead O'Connor
.it Lollapalooza this summer. Abruptly
stumbling upon the chance to justify the
hype, to erase their status as shifty flavor of
the month, Elastica delivered in full.
"I really enjoyed it," she tells me, "be
cause I loved a lot of the bands. Some days
it was just totally sort of breathtaking to see
the audience."
Justine ignores the opening to say some
thing appropriately cynical about the be
hemoth-like summer-long caravan of hype
and just tells me how she much likes Pave
ment and how she enjoyed touring with
( ourtnev love.
"Really?" I ask.
She nods. "I think I was probably the
only person on the tour who did. She w.is
really nice to us and I just got into her
whole kind of badly behaved thing, you
know?"
I ler ease in conversation and her grace
lul sincerity keep tripping me up. Her
lyrics paint the picture of a much different
disposition. 1 )eceptively sweet, some songs

on closer listen reveal a viciously mischie
vous side. On the adrenaline-inducing
"Stutter," Justine complains about a chron
ically impotent boyfriend. "Is there some
thing you lack when I'm flat on my back?"
she sings. "Is there something that I can do
for you?" And on "All-Nighter," complaints
of the helplessly undersexed: "You're a
cloud short of heaven / but I want you to
be mine / Am 1 sitting here waiting? / Yeah,
it's getting frustrating."
She smiles when I repeat some of her
lyrics. "Is there something compelling
about the man who doesn't come
through?" I ask.
"I've just seemed to be cursed with them
all."
Her sudden nastiness is refreshing.
"It's just revenge," she goes on. "In some
ways lyric writing is an absolutely brilliant
way to reduce people to something the si/e
of a small flea publicly. A bit of sarcasm,
you know — get them where it hurts."
The much publicized severance spat
with Suede front man Brett Anderson
comes to mind. She left the band when she
began to feel neglected in early 1992.
I ask about "the fear of being left be
hind."
She acknowledges it emphatically.
"There's definitely that level of competi
tion where you want to be doing what your

boyfriend's doing and you want to be
doing it better, you know what 1 mean? You
want to be competing."
I here's a different glint in Justine's eye
now. Gone is the courteous, demurring
smile. She seems no less generous, no less
kind; it's just that the comforting familiar
ity I'd noticed earlier has ebbed a little. 1 or
the first time that afternoon, Justine
I rischmann seems gleefully edgy, like the
rock star she's always wanted to be.
That night, amid the trendy fashion
plating of the 1 illmore's teeny slack
er crowd, I wait for Elastica to take
the stage. I'm thinking about fame and
about how it is supposed to change people.
The brazen, sloppy Donna Matthews had
somehow confirmed the rumors of dou
ble-faced success. Chilly glamour for the
camera (she looks sultry and ravishing on
the album cover), endearing, bread
crumbed carelessness for blind micro
phones.
But it's harder to pin down Justine
I rischmann. She seemed at all times con
scious of her fame, both basking in her
attention while remaining unassumingly
casual. I keep thinking about something
she said on the subject at the end of our
conversation. "I don't know," she told
me, sipping mineral water, otherwise at

tentive and thoughtful. "I suppose I've
got a fascination with fame. I always
have, I think. Fart of you thinks, 'this is
really great, I'm part of history and 1 re
ally want to be here,' and the other part of
you thinks, 'I don't want to get fucked
over.' "
She thought for a moment, glancing
down. "There's something kind of ugly
and dirty about it, do you know what I
mean?"
The lights in the Fillmore dim and a
shriek of bottled up expectation fills the
room. Pink lasers flash out into the dark,
swinging madly like drunken searchlights.
Smoke machines sputter into action and
the stage is all fuchsia girl-room haze. A '
slicked up version of Phoenix Motel glam,
the overall effect is imagey and self-con
scious. So very rock star, I think.
Then Justine bounds onto the stage,
grabs the microphone and grins sweetly
through her hair. It's that familiar neigh
borly smile, non-intimidating and sin
cere. And as she and the three others leap
into the guitar raunch of their first song,
I realize that she isn't sidestepping the
pitfalls of fame. She's obsessed by them.
Fame tor her is kitschy and convincing,
attitude-laden and demure; it's every
thing at once, and everything she's always
wanted.

they'd hit on press-stop-

ping potential.
Justine puts it this way: "The problem
with those papers is that everything is ei
ther superlatives or people being absolute
ly slaughtered. It's either this band is the
greatest band ever, ever, and they sound
like all the best bands you've ever heard of,
or three weeks later they're absolutely shit.
It's dreadful."
The effect was to intimidate and quiet
the band. "You just know that you're sick ot
the sight of yourself," Justine tells me, "so
everyone else must be sick of the sight ot
you. I think the only way to survive it is to
just put stuff out when you've got some
thing you really want to put out for the fans
or whatever, do a minimum of press and
fuck off again."
I look over at the other interview, won
dering if the U.S. brand of journalism is
much different. I )onna Matthews stuffs the
rest of her sandwich while the KOMI
woman assures her while nodding over at
us, "I just really like you guys a lot."
Satisfied by the middle-aged hipster's
kiss ass tactics and emboldened by my own
reticent credibility, I revel in the mean
spirited moment. Justine, however, grace
fully acknowledges the compliment with a
small and unflaggingly sincere smile.
Elastica's self-titled debut came out

later, hit singles "Connection" and

way you can go into a truck stop and

Garth Brooks, more like, I think. 1 can't
argue, though. The way she intersperses
charmingly precise BBC-speak with her
unnervingly evocative "do you know what
1 mean?" absolutely slays me.
"In Britain," she tells me, "On Radio 3 or
something, it's all Barry Manilow and the
equivalent."
The recent loss of a member, bassist
Annie Holland, hasn't kept the band from
touring back and forth across the States re
peatedly in the past few months. Justine
places a carefully positive light on Hol
land's departure. "It's kind of quite good
when things like that happen and you get
forced to look at your band and think,
'where are we going?' " Looking forward to
incorporating dance loops and more key
hoarding into their next album, Justine
adds "We were moving in a little different
direction and Annie wasn't. She definitely
didn't want to do a disco song."
Despite shifting membership, Elastica

and just tells me how she much likes Pave

( ourtnev love.
"Really?" I ask.
She nods. "I think I was probably the
only person on the tour who did. She w.is
really nice to us and I just got into her
whole kind of badly behaved thing, you
know?"

on closer listen reveal a viciously mischie
vous side. On the adrenaline-inducing
"Stutter," Justine complains about a chron
ically impotent boyfriend. "Is there some
thing you lack when I'm flat on my back?"
she sings. "Is there something that I can do
for you?" And on "All-Nighter," complaints
of the helplessly undersexed: "You're a
cloud short of heaven / but I want you to
be mine / Am 1 sitting here waiting? / Yeah,
it's getting frustrating."
She smiles when I repeat some of her
lyrics. "Is there something compelling
about the man who doesn't come
through?" I ask.
"I've just seemed to be cursed with them
all."
Her sudden nastiness is refreshing.
"It's just revenge," she goes on. "In some
ways lyric writing is an absolutely brilliant
way to reduce people to something the si/e
of a small flea publicly. A bit of sarcasm,
you know — get them where it hurts."
The much publicized severance spat
with Suede front man Brett Anderson
comes to mind. She left the band when she
began to feel neglected in early 1992.
I ask about "the fear of being left be
hind."
She acknowledges it emphatically.
"There's definitely that level of competi
tion where you want to be doing what your

boyfriend's doing and you want to be
doing it better, you know what 1 mean? You
want to be competing."
I here's a different glint in Justine's eye
now. Gone is the courteous, demurring
smile. She seems no less generous, no less
kind; it's just that the comforting familiar
ity I'd noticed earlier has ebbed a little. 1 or
the first time that afternoon, Justine
I rischmann seems gleefully edgy, like the
rock star she's always wanted to be.
That night, amid the trendy fashion
plating of the 1 illmore's teeny slack
er crowd, I wait for Elastica to take
the stage. I'm thinking about fame and
about how it is supposed to change people.
The brazen, sloppy Donna Matthews had
somehow confirmed the rumors of dou
ble-faced success. Chilly glamour for the
camera (she looks sultry and ravishing on
the album cover), endearing, bread
crumbed carelessness for blind micro
phones.
But it's harder to pin down Justine
I rischmann. She seemed at all times con
scious of her fame, both basking in her
attention while remaining unassumingly
casual. I keep thinking about something
she said on the subject at the end of our
conversation. "I don't know," she told
me, sipping mineral water, otherwise at

tentive and thoughtful. "I suppose I've
got a fascination with fame. I always
have, I think. Fart of you thinks, 'this is
really great, I'm part of history and 1 re
ally want to be here,' and the other part of
you thinks, 'I don't want to get fucked
over.' "
She thought for a moment, glancing
down. "There's something kind of ugly
and dirty about it, do you know what I
mean?"
The lights in the Fillmore dim and a
shriek of bottled up expectation fills the
room. Pink lasers flash out into the dark,
swinging madly like drunken searchlights.
Smoke machines sputter into action and
the stage is all fuchsia girl-room haze. A '
slicked up version of Phoenix Motel glam,
the overall effect is imagey and self-con
scious. So very rock star, I think.
Then Justine bounds onto the stage,
grabs the microphone and grins sweetly
through her hair. It's that familiar neigh
borly smile, non-intimidating and sin
cere. And as she and the three others leap
into the guitar raunch of their first song,
I realize that she isn't sidestepping the
pitfalls of fame. She's obsessed by them.
Fame tor her is kitschy and convincing,
attitude-laden and demure; it's every
thing at once, and everything she's always
wanted.


I am surprised at first sight of Justine
Frischmann, lead singer and guitarist
for British retro-pop sensation F.lastica.
Arriving early at the Phoenix Motel in San
Francisco for my interview, 1 decide to
head for the bathroom. Kill some time, you
know, make a more suitable entrance on
the dot of 2:30. I am off-guard, a tad star
tled by my surroundings — the under
stuffed black vinyl couches in the lobby, the
shag carpet beneath my feet, the chipping
flamingo-pink paint, the seedy glam of it
all. Even the tiny, shimmering pool in the
concrete and asphalt courtyard, kidney
shaped .uul patterned, shrieks rock star re
sort. The place is all sham, though, affected
and overblown, as if the years spent hous
ing nomadic rock and rollers has cast a
sheen of kitsch along its walls.
On the way to the men's room, through
the dilapidated trendiness of "Miss Pearl's
lam House," I spot Justine sitting at a patio
table giving an interview by the pool. Sur
rounded on three sides by a camera crew
and an interviewer, she seems at ease, even
charmed by the whole mess. But that isn't
what surprises me. I can't help but be star
tled, as I step into the darkness of the aban
doned bar, by how familiar she looks. I he
heavy eyebrows, the raked shag ol her hair,
the angular, severe lines of her jaw. All the
press photos and interview snippets I've
ever seen come to mind. For some reason,
I thought she'd look different in person,
the oddly awkward real life face of a media

bound celebrity.
I haven't expected her to look so.. . well,
real. I expected some sleight-of-hand,
some trickery, something like the lost-era
glamour of the Phoenix Motel, the squalid
comfort of truth somehow hoaxed by
fame.
Checking the typed schedule she holds
in her hands, band manager Kate Hamson
tells me that I will be interviewing Justin.
Ah, the drummer. The unknown face ol
F.lastica, Justin Welch, only commands in
terest as the sole male member in the band.
I thank Hamson as politely as I can, facing
the task of trying to spruce up a otherwise
grade-B interview prospect. I'm sure Justin
is a fine person and would probably make a
Fine interviewee, but anyone who has heard
Justine's coy and intimate tremor of a voice
cannot help but want to hear it directed
solely towards them.
I settle into a pool chair behind a pitted,
white patio table in the shade, pull out my
list ol questions and begin madly to revise.
Only the most insipid and cliched ol
queries spring to mind: "What's it like
being a boy in .1 girl band?" etc.
Across the way, .1 phalanx of leather-clad
roadies drink beer and smoke cigarettes by
the pool. At the next table, an over hipped
forty something from KOMI .brandishing
her high-tech recording equipment like a
(iucci bag sets up. She gels to interview
lead guitarist Donna Matthews. Mean
while, I lamson, band manager, kindly lets

me know that lustin will be out "any
minute."
Matthews emerges from her room,
overslept and groggy, looking cherubic and
impish at once. She's tiny, with oily, slept
-011 blond hair, fly-eyed wrap-arounds and
polity lips, permanently pursed. She mut
ters something in incomprehensible I.on
donese and begins to eat a fried egg sand
wich. KOMI' waves to her from where she
sits and Donna cringes a little.
I 'm liking her already.
At this point, lustine notices me sitting
alone. She walks over, saying to Hamson
over her shoulder, "I can just do this one, if
Justin is still getting ready."
Abruptly broken from cloying self-pity,
I notice Hamson wonderfully raise her
hand and allow it.
"Unless of course you would rather have
lustin," Justine says, speaking to me for the
first time, her voice devoid of sarcasm,
kind and absolutely lovely.
Umm, let me think. "No this will be
fine," I say.
cc ■y really like it here," lustine tells me,
I raising her face to the sun. "I think
JLit's one of the few places in the
States where I could live."
I can only agree. It's one of those perfect
davs, the sky .1 flawless blue, the air warm,
free of San Francisco's habitual fall after
noon chill.
"It's a lot more fun touring here

than it is touring at
home," she goes on.
"It's more exotic."
Justine's got
more than one reason to
be glad to be out of her
own country. Her prob
lems with British
tabloid press began
back in 1993 when
weekly papers NMI and
Melody Maker got wind
of her newly formed
band. Recently severed
from Suede (and from
Suede's lead singer Brett
Anderson), Justine re
cruited Justin Welch,
bassist Annie Holland
and guitarist Donna
Matthews. The notori
ous weeklies thought
they'd hit on press-stop-

ping potential.
Justine puts it this way: "The problem
with those papers is that everything is ei
ther superlatives or people being absolute
ly slaughtered. It's either this band is the
greatest band ever, ever, and they sound
like all the best bands you've ever heard of,
or three weeks later they're absolutely shit.
It's dreadful."
The effect was to intimidate and quiet
the band. "You just know that you're sick ot

I ask about "the fear of being left be
hind."
She acknowledges it emphatically.
"There's definitely that level of competi
tion where you want to be doing what your

boyfriend's doing and you want to be
doing it better, you know what 1 mean? You
want to be competing."
I here's a different glint in Justine's eye
now. Gone is the courteous, demurring
smile. She seems no less generous, no less
kind; it's just that the comforting familiar
ity I'd noticed earlier has ebbed a little. 1 or
the first time that afternoon, Justine
I rischmann seems gleefully edgy, like the
rock star she's always wanted to be.
That night, amid the trendy fashion
plating of the 1 illmore's teeny slack
er crowd, I wait for Elastica to take
the stage. I'm thinking about fame and
about how it is supposed to change people.
The brazen, sloppy Donna Matthews had
somehow confirmed the rumors of dou
ble-faced success. Chilly glamour for the
camera (she looks sultry and ravishing on
the album cover), endearing, bread
crumbed carelessness for blind micro
phones.
But it's harder to pin down Justine
I rischmann. She seemed at all times con
scious of her fame, both basking in her
attention while remaining unassumingly
casual. I keep thinking about something
she said on the subject at the end of our
conversation. "I don't know," she told
me, sipping mineral water, otherwise at

tentive and thoughtful. "I suppose I've
got a fascination with fame. I always
have, I think. Fart of you thinks, 'this is
really great, I'm part of history and 1 re
ally want to be here,' and the other part of
you thinks, 'I don't want to get fucked
over.' "
She thought for a moment, glancing
down. "There's something kind of ugly
and dirty about it, do you know what I
mean?"
The lights in the Fillmore dim and a
shriek of bottled up expectation fills the
room. Pink lasers flash out into the dark,
swinging madly like drunken searchlights.
Smoke machines sputter into action and
the stage is all fuchsia girl-room haze. A '
slicked up version of Phoenix Motel glam,
the overall effect is imagey and self-con
scious. So very rock star, I think.
Then Justine bounds onto the stage,
grabs the microphone and grins sweetly
through her hair. It's that familiar neigh
borly smile, non-intimidating and sin
cere. And as she and the three others leap
into the guitar raunch of their first song,
I realize that she isn't sidestepping the
pitfalls of fame. She's obsessed by them.
Fame tor her is kitschy and convincing,
attitude-laden and demure; it's every
thing at once, and everything she's always
wanted.


I am surprised at first sight of Justine
Frischmann, lead singer and guitarist
for British retro-pop sensation F.lastica.
Arriving early at the Phoenix Motel in San
Francisco for my interview, 1 decide to
head for the bathroom. Kill some time, you
know, make a more suitable entrance on
the dot of 2:30. I am off-guard, a tad star
tled by my surroundings — the under
stuffed black vinyl couches in the lobby, the
shag carpet beneath my feet, the chipping
flamingo-pink paint, the seedy glam of it
all. Even the tiny, shimmering pool in the
concrete and asphalt courtyard, kidney
shaped .uul patterned, shrieks rock star re
sort. The place is all sham, though, affected
and overblown, as if the years spent hous
ing nomadic rock and rollers has cast a
sheen of kitsch along its walls.
On the way to the men's room, through
the dilapidated trendiness of "Miss Pearl's
lam House," I spot Justine sitting at a patio
table giving an interview by the pool. Sur
rounded on three sides by a camera crew
and an interviewer, she seems at ease, even
charmed by the whole mess. But that isn't
what surprises me. I can't help but be star
tled, as I step into the darkness of the aban
doned bar, by how familiar she looks. I he
heavy eyebrows, the raked shag ol her hair,
the angular, severe lines of her jaw. All the
press photos and interview snippets I've
ever seen come to mind. For some reason,
I thought she'd look different in person,
the oddly awkward real life face of a media

bound celebrity.
I haven't expected her to look so.. . well,
real. I expected some sleight-of-hand,
some trickery, something like the lost-era
glamour of the Phoenix Motel, the squalid
comfort of truth somehow hoaxed by
fame.
Checking the typed schedule she holds
in her hands, band manager Kate Hamson
tells me that I will be interviewing Justin.
Ah, the drummer. The unknown face ol
F.lastica, Justin Welch, only commands in
terest as the sole male member in the band.
I thank Hamson as politely as I can, facing
the task of trying to spruce up a otherwise
grade-B interview prospect. I'm sure Justin
is a fine person and would probably make a
Fine interviewee, but anyone who has heard
Justine's coy and intimate tremor of a voice
cannot help but want to hear it directed
solely towards them.
I settle into a pool chair behind a pitted,
white patio table in the shade, pull out my
list ol questions and begin madly to revise.
Only the most insipid and cliched ol
queries spring to mind: "What's it like
being a boy in .1 girl band?" etc.
Across the way, .1 phalanx of leather-clad
roadies drink beer and smoke cigarettes by
the pool. At the next table, an over hipped
forty something from KOMI .brandishing
her high-tech recording equipment like a
(iucci bag sets up. She gels to interview
lead guitarist Donna Matthews. Mean
while, I lamson, band manager, kindly lets

me know that lustin will be out "any
minute."
Matthews emerges from her room,
overslept and groggy, looking cherubic and
impish at once. She's tiny, with oily, slept
-011 blond hair, fly-eyed wrap-arounds and
polity lips, permanently pursed. She mut
ters something in incomprehensible I.on
donese and begins to eat a fried egg sand
wich. KOMI' waves to her from where she
sits and Donna cringes a little.
I 'm liking her already.
At this point, lustine notices me sitting
alone. She walks over, saying to Hamson
over her shoulder, "I can just do this one, if
Justin is still getting ready."
Abruptly broken from cloying self-pity,
I notice Hamson wonderfully raise her
hand and allow it.
"Unless of course you would rather have
lustin," Justine says, speaking to me for the
first time, her voice devoid of sarcasm,
kind and absolutely lovely.
Umm, let me think. "No this will be
fine," I say.
cc ■y really like it here," lustine tells me,
I raising her face to the sun. "I think
JLit's one of the few places in the
States where I could live."
I can only agree. It's one of those perfect
davs, the sky .1 flawless blue, the air warm,
free of San Francisco's habitual fall after
noon chill.
"It's a lot more fun touring here

than it is touring at
home," she goes on.
"It's more exotic."
Justine's got
more than one reason to
be glad to be out of her
own country. Her prob
lems with British
tabloid press began
back in 1993 when
weekly papers NMI and
Melody Maker got wind
of her newly formed
band. Recently severed
from Suede (and from
Suede's lead singer Brett
Anderson), Justine re
cruited Justin Welch,
bassist Annie Holland
and guitarist Donna
Matthews. The notori
ous weeklies thought
they'd hit on press-stop-

ping potential.
Justine puts it this way: "The problem
with those papers is that everything is ei
ther superlatives or people being absolute
ly slaughtered. It's either this band is the
greatest band ever, ever, and they sound
like all the best bands you've ever heard of,
or three weeks later they're absolutely shit.
It's dreadful."
The effect was to intimidate and quiet
the band. "You just know that you're sick ot
the sight of yourself," Justine tells me, "so
everyone else must be sick of the sight ot
you. I think the only way to survive it is to
just put stuff out when you've got some
thing you really want to put out for the fans
or whatever, do a minimum of press and
fuck off again."
I look over at the other interview, won
dering if the U.S. brand of journalism is
much different. I )onna Matthews stuffs the
rest of her sandwich while the KOMI
woman assures her while nodding over at
us, "I just really like you guys a lot."
Satisfied by the middle-aged hipster's
kiss ass tactics and emboldened by my own
reticent credibility, I revel in the mean
spirited moment. Justine, however, grace
fully acknowledges the compliment with a
small and unflaggingly sincere smile.
Elastica's self-titled debut came out
last March, and thousands of copies
later, hit singles "Connection" and
"Stutter" still restlessly boomerang in and

out of buzz bin and radio rotation lists,
lustine appreciates the attention, attribut
ing our obsession with their brand of
trashy backwards-looking pop to national
taste. "I think this country is definitely
sort of built for rock — the idea of electric
guitar being built into the nation as a kind
of staple diet. I find it really touching the
way you can go into a truck stop and
they're playing Aerosmith, do you know
what 1 mean?"
Garth Brooks, more like, I think. 1 can't
argue, though. The way she intersperses
charmingly precise BBC-speak with her
unnervingly evocative "do you know what
1 mean?" absolutely slays me.
"In Britain," she tells me, "On Radio 3 or
something, it's all Barry Manilow and the
equivalent."
The recent loss of a member, bassist
Annie Holland, hasn't kept the band from
touring back and forth across the States re
peatedly in the past few months. Justine
places a carefully positive light on Hol
land's departure. "It's kind of quite good
when things like that happen and you get
forced to look at your band and think,
'where are we going?' " Looking forward to
incorporating dance loops and more key
hoarding into their next album, Justine
adds "We were moving in a little different
direction and Annie wasn't. She definitely
didn't want to do a disco song."
Despite shifting membership, Elastica
competently stood in for Sinead O'Connor
.it Lollapalooza this summer. Abruptly
stumbling upon the chance to justify the
hype, to erase their status as shifty flavor of
the month, Elastica delivered in full.
"I really enjoyed it," she tells me, "be
cause I loved a lot of the bands. Some days
it was just totally sort of breathtaking to see
the audience."
Justine ignores the opening to say some
thing appropriately cynical about the be
hemoth-like summer-long caravan of hype
and just tells me how she much likes Pave
ment and how she enjoyed touring with
( ourtnev love.
"Really?" I ask.
She nods. "I think I was probably the
only person on the tour who did. She w.is
really nice to us and I just got into her
whole kind of badly behaved thing, you
know?"
I ler ease in conversation and her grace
lul sincerity keep tripping me up. Her
lyrics paint the picture of a much different
disposition. 1 )eceptively sweet, some songs

on closer listen reveal a viciously mischie
vous side. On the adrenaline-inducing
"Stutter," Justine complains about a chron
ically impotent boyfriend. "Is there some
thing you lack when I'm flat on my back?"
she sings. "Is there something that I can do
for you?" And on "All-Nighter," complaints
of the helplessly undersexed: "You're a
cloud short of heaven / but I want you to
be mine / Am 1 sitting here waiting? / Yeah,
it's getting frustrating."
She smiles when I repeat some of her
lyrics. "Is there something compelling
about the man who doesn't come
through?" I ask.
"I've just seemed to be cursed with them
all."
Her sudden nastiness is refreshing.
"It's just revenge," she goes on. "In some
ways lyric writing is an absolutely brilliant
way to reduce people to something the si/e
of a small flea publicly. A bit of sarcasm,
you know — get them where it hurts."
The much publicized severance spat
with Suede front man Brett Anderson
comes to mind. She left the band when she
began to feel neglected in early 1992.
I ask about "the fear of being left be
hind."
She acknowledges it emphatically.
"There's definitely that level of competi
