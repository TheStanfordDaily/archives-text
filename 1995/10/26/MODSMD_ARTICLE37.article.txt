Insomniac

I veil it you could highbrow (ireen Days
seismically successful 1944 major label
debut, "Dookie," out ol existence, you'd he
hard pressed to forget its clinging appeal.
Songs like "When I ( ome Around' and
"Basket ("ase" on first listen infect with retro
viral /eal, rebounding like superballs
through insipidly ponderous modern
rockarama. (ireen Day oiler adolescent self
loathing skirted with a juvenile grace; car
toonish gutter humor that's unaccount.ihh
likable. I hat said, "Insomniac, their eagei
ly awaited follow up, is a near colossal let
down, claiming maturit\ for embarrassing
two cent introspection, artistry lor numbing
formula. It's like your parents "clowning
around on a Saturday night, like stale sugar
cereal you thought vou liked.
In a way, it's nice to see that (ireen Dav
hasn't fallen far from the pop punk tree.
Ãœbiquitous and heated, the rhythms on
songs like "Armatage Shanks and "laded
are breathlessly frothy, serviceably boisterous
the unexciting but nonetheless satisfying
signature ol a (ireen I )av content to just get
by. And I'd opt for "comfortingly familiar
over "uninspired and monotonous" because
at least they seem to know what they can and
can't pull off.
Musically, that is. What's so annoying
about "Insomniac'' is its world-weary matu
rity, its ill-advised pretensions ol profundity.
On the relentlessly uncatchy "Panic Song,"
Hillie loe sings "Bleeding down these
thoughts of / anguish... mass confusion."
What was wrong with school-yard antics,
with "I'm so damn bored I'm going
blind / and I smell like shit?" And on the oth

erwise passable "No Pride," Billie Joe opts for
predictable fame-weary cynicism: "You bet
ter digest your values / because they turn to
shit." Oh, please.
Some tracks recall the best moments from
"I )ookie," dipping lor a moment into charm
ingly obnoxious youth. I specially appealing
is the mischievous sell deprivation of' Stuart
and the Ave. ("I may be dumb / but I'm not
stupid enough to stav with you"). And on
"Brat," easily the best song on the album,
(.ireen Day attacks the young, bored and
privileged: "(lot a plan ot action <4iul cold
blood/and it smells of defiance/I'll just
wait lor Mom and I )ad to die / and get my in
heritance. It's uncultivated and brash, just
the kind of thinly-veiled, indecorous "luck
you we expect from (ireen I )ay. Iwo songs,
however, do not an album make. I our out ol
32 long-awaited minutes just come across as
a smothered reminder ol what used to be
good dumb lun.
