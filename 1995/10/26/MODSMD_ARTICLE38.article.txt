Circus

Almost from the word go, something
about the retro-auteur persona of 1 ennv
Kravit/ has irked music critics the world
over. When they trip on jams reminiscent of
I ed Zeppelin, they call him a plagiarist.
When they catch a Jones off of'grooves as sur
reptitiously soulful as old C.urtis Mayfield
sides, lie's declared a heretic.
Never mind that pop culture seems hell
bent on preserving the "good old days"
Kravit/ is apparently as dangerous to rock
and soul as gangsta rap is to the moral back
bone of young, white America. Sure, and
black Americans invented racism.

Well, critics and fans alike will be
happy to know that "Circus,"
Kravitz's fourth release, sounds dif
ferent, hut not necessarily any bet
ter. Peppered with a generous mix
ture ofangst and spirituality, a pen
sive Kravitz. lavishes us with the
moody energy of a 20-something
who's relapsed into puberty — but
it's .til good.
On rousing grinders like "Rock
and Roll Is Dead and "Tunnel Vi
sion, he reminds us of how raptur
ous a one man band can sound
when the musician is in complete
control of his muses. "Tunnel Vi
sion, .1 bubbling brew of electric
guitar rills and shifty rhythm sec
tion punches, is a chase tune a la
"Starsky and I lutch."
Hut as "Don't Cio and Put a bul
let in Your I lead" or "Thin Ice" re
mind us, Kravitz is just as eager to
give head for the soul shack. Still
some of the albums most com
pelling sounds — the title track and
"Can't Clet You off My Mind" for
instance strike out into ballad
territory.
On "Circus," in particular, we
find him negotiating the canvas of a
musical landscape still under con
struction. Ironically, it serves his
purposes to step out of his tradi
tional role as virtuoso to enlist the
services of a couple of musicians
and writers / composers (Tony

Breit, C raig Ross, Gerry DeVeux
and Terry Britten respectively). Though con
vincing as chief musician and crooner, even
tans agree that lyrical panache isn't his forte.
But a positive review shouldn't dwell on
the negatives. Despite critical disapproval,
Kravitz's music comes from a place deep
down inside, a stomping ground, shuttering
with the pulse, the vitality of a creative ener
gy as original as any of the musicians lie's ever
been accused of copying.
