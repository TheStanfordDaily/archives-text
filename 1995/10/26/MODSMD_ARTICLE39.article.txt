Live!

The Police are the classic example of how
the punk revolution of the '70s kept rock and
roll alive for another decade.
When the Police formed, they were al
ready quite competent musicians. All of
them had done work in technically taxing
groups, ranging from art-rock to ja// fusion,
further, they had a significant respect for
reggae, which eventually became a basis for
much of their work.
Thus, when the Police released their first
album in 1979, they were the perfect proto
type for another progressive rock group
whose pretensions and love ofabsurdh com
plex music would turn them into another
perennial bore. They could have been the
Rush of the '80s.
but instead, they found themselves within
the bnglish punk movement, where talent
was much less important than passion and
originality. Thus, the Police made tight,
catchy songs which were full rhythmic com
plexity but never lost their melodic appeal.

I hoy chose to hide their significant ability
within instantly appealing songs which won
them a loyal following.
Nowhere is this choice more apparent
than on the recently released double-album
"Live!" The album covers two concerts, one
from after their second album, "Regetta de
Blanc," and the other from their final tour
after "Synchronicity."
I or the first time on an officially released
record, the Police are able to fully flex their
instrumental muscle, and the results are truly
impressive. Their lengthy version of "The
Bed's Too Big Without You" from the first
concert reaches levels of rhythmic depth few
bands of their time could match. Neverthe
less, the music never loses its simple, undeni
able appeal.
