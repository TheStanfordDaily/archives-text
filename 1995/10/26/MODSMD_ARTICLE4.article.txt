# Harassment policy revised
## New rules on sex abuse announced; committee seeks reaction 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Two years after its creation, the Uni
versity's sexual harassment policy is up
for review.
Among the changes being proposed
are a clause that requires those found
guilty of harassment to reimburse the
University for legal fees and a clarifica
tion of the limits of confidentiality in re
porting harassment.
Another proposed change would elim
inate a panel of advisers who counseled
the administration on how to deal with
sexiuil harassment cases. Instead, that
duty will be covered by a sexual harass

graduate student, said she expects most
debate to stem from the clause which re
quires those found guilty of sexual ha
rassment to reimburse the University
for a portion of their legal fees.
University General Counsel Michael
Roster, however, said that it is actually
only a minor change.
"The policy is not a whole lot different
from what has happened in the past,"
Roster said. "It is a forewarning to the
schools and department heads that they
might have to bear some of these costs."

The elimination of
the panel of advisers,
said Crider, is a minor
procedural issue com
pared to the more sub
stantial revisions in
confidentiality policy
that appear in the new
draft.
Crider said she sees
the new document as

more honest about the issue of confiden
tiality.
Committee members, Crider said, are
eager to protect both those who come for
ward with a harassment claim and those
who have been accused of harassment.
However, the new document is explicit
about the limits to confidentiality.
"It makes very clear that, especially in
