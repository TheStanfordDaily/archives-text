# Harassment policy revised
## New rules on sex abuse announced; committee seeks reaction 
### Amy Slucter Contributing writer 
Two years after its creation, the Uni
versity's sexual harassment policy is up
for review.
Among the changes being proposed
are a clause that requires those found
guilty of harassment to reimburse the
University for legal fees and a clarifica
tion of the limits of confidentiality in re
porting harassment.
Another proposed change would elim
inate a panel of advisers who counseled
the administration on how to deal with
sexiuil harassment cases. Instead, that
duty will be covered by a sexual harass
ment coordinating adviser responsible
for providing advice to the Stanford com
munity and for keeping a record of sexu
al harassment cases.
Part of the 1993 policy — the first of

its kind at Stanford — mandated a re
view after two years. A committee led by
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter
has been examining the sexual harass
ment policy for five months and will take
public comment on a new draft until
Nov. 15 before a final version is present
ed to the Faculty Senate on Nov. 30.
Committee member Juliet Crider, a
graduate student, said she expects most
debate to stem from the clause which re
quires those found guilty of sexual ha
rassment to reimburse the University
for a portion of their legal fees.
University General Counsel Michael
Roster, however, said that it is actually
only a minor change.
"The policy is not a whole lot different
from what has happened in the past,"
Roster said. "It is a forewarning to the
schools and department heads that they
might have to bear some of these costs."

The elimination of
the panel of advisers,
said Crider, is a minor
procedural issue com
pared to the more sub
stantial revisions in
confidentiality policy
that appear in the new
draft.
Crider said she sees
the new document as

more honest about the issue of confiden
tiality.
Committee members, Crider said, are
eager to protect both those who come for
ward with a harassment claim and those
who have been accused of harassment.
However, the new document is explicit
about the limits to confidentiality.
"It makes very clear that, especially in


Fetter
the legal arena, confidentiality
can't always be maintained," Crid
er said.
In response to the more honest
wording of the new policy, many
resident assistants have expressed
concern about their ability to guar
antee confidentiality to their resi
dents. The new policy states that
blanket confidentiality is not an
option.
However, according to Fetter,
that confidentiality could be main
tained if the complainant did not
identify their harasser.
While Crider said she hopes the
new policy will provide education to
deter sexual harassment and
encouragement for those with com
plaints to come forward, she said
that the draft is not perfect.
Input from any interested par
ties at Stanford, which may be sub
mitted to Fetter's office in Building
10 or e-mailed to hk.jhfCaforsythe,
will be essential in putting the best
possible version of the policy before
the Faculty Senate, said Sexual

I larassment Coordinating Adviser
Laraine Zappert.
"We are soliciting input and that
is a very serious request," she said.
"We will read every one of them
and take them into consideration."
This will be the first time that
students, faculty and staff will be
able to give their input to the sexu
al harassment policy since its origi
nal drafting in 1993. According to
Crider, the policy has been running
for two years during which time
two areas that needed clarification
were identified: confidentiality and
record keeping.
"I think that the policy repre
sents a compromise between the
ideal we would like to achieve and
the legal responsibility of the Uni
versity," Crider said.
According to graduate student
Shira Neuberger, this concern with
legal affairs can ultimately be
destructive. Reaction to sexual
harassment, she said, can include
fear, shame and denial and the vic
tim deserves to have full Universi
ty support.
"Everyone is so concerned with
the political and legal issues that
the social aspect of the problem
seems to fall by the wayside," Neu

berger said.
"I personally had a case with
harassment when I was an under
graduate and there was a dean who
called me to make sure I was okay,"
she said. "That event really stands
out for me and makes me realize
that a definite support framework
should be in place."
Neuberger, who attended
Brown University at the time when
she was harassed, said that a school
has a responsibility to enact poli
cies that serve to prevent harass
ment and to provide support for
those people who are harassed.
Peer support groups and coun
selors are one possibility that she
suggests.
ASSU senator Bill Shen said he
is glad that the University is com
ing up with a clear framework for
dealing with harassment concerns.
However, he said he is concerned
that there was not more student
input from the beginning of the
process.
"I think that there is work to be
done but it must be done with stu
dents," Shen said. "They are fram
ing the issues. I believe it should be
a cooperative effort with students
and faculty side by side."
