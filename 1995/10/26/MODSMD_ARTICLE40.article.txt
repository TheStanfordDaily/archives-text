Indeed, the band seems perfectly suited
tor a concert environment, as a number ot
their weaker album cuts, such as "Next to
You,' "Hole in My Lite" and "Fall Out,"
sound absolutely fabulous live.
Strangely enough, the second concert, fea
turing music from the band's most successful
period, is the weaker ot the two. "King ot
l'ain" is a decidedly odd choice for a crowd
pleasing sing-along. Truthfully, the strength
o! the band's singles trapped them in the sec
ond concert, keeping them from stretching
themselves as they were able to early in their
career.
Nonetheless, when they return to their
original hits, "Roxanne," "(la n't Stand 1 osing
You" and especially "So Lonely, at the end ol
the second concert, the album hits its peak.
The playing is inspired and tight while Sting
proves how lar he lias come .is a vocalist over
the years.
Thus, the Police have released what is per
haps one ol a handful ol essential live albums
from the 80s, a powerful statement to both
their musical ability and melodic intelli
gence.
