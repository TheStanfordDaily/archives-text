# MERCURY REV
## 
### 
See You on the Other
Side

II you think of the Flaming I ips .is a color
ful balloon that drifts through the skv and the
clouds while still bound to earthly rock con
ventions, Mercury Rev is that balloon after
the string broke.
Mercury Rev is fronted by ex-Flaming Lip
lonathan Donahue, and the band's third
album, "See You on the Other Side," is full of
imaginative soundscapes and spacey impro
visation, the whole thing propelled by an up
beat persistence to go where other bands
haven't gone before. The album is just anoth
er step in the group's gradual abandonment
n! traditional rock structures, a trend which
began with their impressive debut "Yersell Is
Steam."
This time around, the trip begins with
"F.mpire State (Son House in Excelsis),"
with its chopstick-v piano part and under
water / outer-space sounds giving way to a
giant horn explosion and general sonic
mish-mash, only to be later taken over by a
cheery flute that brings the song to its
peppy conclusion. It's a lot to swallow, but
the song offers more musical ideas than
most albums do, and the effect is thorough
ly worthwhile.
"Young Man's Stride" comes next, a last,
almost punkish, verse-chorus-verse-type
affair that's more straightforward and less
interesting than the bulk of this album. But
the record s more otherworldly bits pick up
the slack: Tracks like "Sudden Ray of
Hope," "("lose Encounters of the 3rd
(Irade" and "A Kiss from an Old Flame (A
Trip to the Moon)" set a mystical, fluffy at
mosphere, with plenty of horns, rocketship
guitars and zooming and twinkling sound
effects.
lust about the only problem with this
album is that the twirling-through-space
feel can get old kind of quick, and you def
initely need to be in an proper mood for
sci-fi cheese like "Everlasting Arm" and

"Racing the Tide." But even the album's
worst moments have their moments, and
Mercury Rev manages to intrigue with
their happiness much more often than they
annoy.
