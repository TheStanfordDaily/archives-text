# BOY GEORGE
## 
### 
Cheapness and
Beauty

In a world that equates Boy George with
anything Karma Chameleon, creating a fresh
and new cross dressing image can be quite
difficult. Perhaps placing his brand of pop on
the soundtrack to "The Crying Game" was
the best way for this man-diva to separate
himself from his rocky past — a period char
acterized by endless speculations into the
risque and way too much bubble gum. All ol
it is enough to make .1 star retreat into the an
nals of one-hit-wonderism, a land too de
pressing for even the king of transvestite pop
to endure.
Faced with such a pathetic legacy, Boy
(Jeorge had to do more than just deliver mas
cara-caked <S()s glop as his latest solo effort.
Displaying an impressive dash ol originality
and feminine ballsiness, Kngland's cultural
sexpot has created the appropriately titled
"Cheapness and Beauty," an album with
more than just empty sing-alongs and gim
mick-laced imaging. I'oppilv 00/ ing with en
ergetic pulse, the album transcends the iner
ciless vocal syrup and ( asio cheese that made
( ulture ( lub so forgettably hallow. Klements
of metal, country and classical come together
in this tribute to the new Boy George, a guy
whose lifestyle isn't iust a way to sell records
a nymore.
Embracing his new audience of mature
listening tastes and a hip-swaggering savvy,
Boy George has developed songs on "Cheap
ness and Beauty" that won't burn out after
the night's escapades. "Satan's Butterfly Ball,"
a /.esttnl song that opens with George's
protest of intolerant attitudes toward gender
flexibility, will make even the most sulking
personality more manageable. "Same Thing
In Reverse," a song that hangs with the top

country personalities, is
equally satisfying, prov
ing that Boy George can
experiment with more
than just his sexuality.
And tor those who prefer
to engage in the more
emotional and private
George, the album ends
with two tear-jerking
monuments, "Unfinished
Business" and"II Adore."
"( heapness and
Beauty" can he called im
pressive for more than
just its energy. I he album
is surprisingly versatile
and amenable to varying
tastes. Perhaps Boy
George wins more for Ins
dashing personality than
anything else — an image
based less on gender and
more on pure, sexless
sass.
