It's Love

"You can say that I have changed / from
how I was back then," sings Rose Melberg,
and you would be right if describing the sliilt
in sound between Melbergs first indie-pop
claim-to-fame Tiger Trap and her current gig

in the Softies. While Tiger Trap's warm, fuzzy
punk-pop charmed with its sloppy energy,
the Softies — all two of them — win hearts
and break them on "It's love," a stirring disc
of folky-punk that's propped on fragile
acoustic guitars and lush vocal melodies.
Partly because of the jarring contrast be
tween the two acts, the first tracks on "It's
Love" seem the strongest and most affecting.
The leadoff'track, "Hello Rain," sets the pen
sive and downcast mood, Melberg"feelingsad
all on my own." Melberg's and Jen Sbragia's
guitars and voices mix flu idly, where one is the
other but neither with another. The music
comes on like a gentle drizzle as the verses ease
into the chorus, "Goodbye / wish you
well / and hello rain. On the steady, rolling "1
Love You More, Melberg is the sad, jilted con
lidant who "can't love you the way he does,'
who "can only love you more." The theme of
unrequited friendships runs through the I*4
songs, all conceived of so impeccably that the
album feels the way a gray cloud looks.
Vet calm despair, even when convincingly ex
pressed, is a difficult mood to sustain, and so
"It's Love'' gets a bit hogged down in itself in the
middle. Tracks like "Until You Tell" and "An
Awful Mess" are catchy and incisive, but become
lost in the muddle of the all-encompassing
gloom. The title cut and the Talulah (Josh cover
"I ( an't Get No Satisfaction, I hank God" do a
good job til breaking up the overcast sound
scape, the first infusing some optimism as Mel
berg enthuses about a new crush and the second
with wry wit and attitude to temper the sad
vibes. 11 anything, those tunes prove that change
might be the easiest way to get out of a rut.
