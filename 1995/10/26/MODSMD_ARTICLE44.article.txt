(ireal ill

how to do a

stunning variation on an old theme. Wood)'
Allen is a gre.it diret tor.
Aliens latest lllni, "Mighty Aphrodite,"
not only plays upon the (ireek goddess of love
hut also uses a (ireek ehorus throughout to
accentuate the foibles ot human action. The
opening scene focuses on a beautiful (ireek
amphitheater, from whence the chorus sings
and dances its amusing morals. But only
Allen's version ol a (ireek chorus would have
the word "schmuck" in their vocabulary.
The variation on a (ireek theme is, ol
course, also a variation on a married couple
in New York, I enny and Amanda Weinrib
(Woody Allen and Helena Bonham Carter).
()n an absolute whim and despite Lenny's in
vocation that you don't adopt a child "... for
the same reason we don't lease the car, pride
of ownership," the couple somehow decide
to adopt Max. fortunately enought for the
Weinribs, the child (Jimmy McQuaid), turns
out to be everything they always wanted: in
telligent, funny and cute. Vet, when Amanda
decides to open her own art gallery, the mar
riage begins to deteriorate.

Marriage problems give impetus to
Lenny's curiosity (which, the (ireek chorus
emphasizes, leads only to danger) obses
sion gets the best of him and he must find out
what has become ot Max's mother. The
search leads him to a leggy blonde, Linda
Ash, brilliantly played by Mira Sorvino. (The
dumb is just an act â€” Sorvino is a Harvard
University honors graduate.) Unfortunately
for Lenny, Max's mom turns out to be a porn
actress with the screen name Judy Come.
I hus, Lenny embarks on his quest to "trv
and play God" and turn Linda into a re
spectable member ot society. In the mean
time, his wife is considering cheating on him
and Linda takes up on her feeling that she
owes Lenny "a good fuck."
I Respite the cautioning of an ever-CCassan
dra-1 ike Cassandra, Lenny overcomes the
tragic drama set out for him. He makes it to
the film's Greek-ironic ending, complete
with the obligatory ileus c.x tnachina. The
Allen-esque cynicism really makes the film,
as in the scene where the chorus looks to the
heavens to speak with Zeus and gets his an
swering machine: "I'm, this is Zeus, I'm not
home right now ....' In fact, you shouldn't
be home either, but at a theater catching this
delightful film.
