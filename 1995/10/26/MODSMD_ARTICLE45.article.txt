"Now and Then" desperately yearns
* to be "Beaches" meets "Steel Magno-

lias" meets "Stand bv Me. But, it's
Demi Moore meets Melanie Criffith, meets
an abysmal script bv Marlene King, meets
clueless director I esli l.inka Cilatter, meets an
audience demanding their money back.
I his is the story ot tour women (Moore,
Ciriltlth, Rosie O Donnell and Rita Wilsoni
who return to their childhood town, Shelby,
Ind., to reminisce about the summer they
turned 12 and made a friendship pact which
has brought them together.
We watch the women as little girls ((iaby
Hoffman, Thora Birch, Christina Ricci and
\shleigh Aston Moore) try to do Stand-by-
Me with-girK and attempt to solve the mur
der mystery of Dear Johnny. They solve the
mystery with ease and manage to save up
enough money to buy a beautiful pink tree
house. This is .ill in 1970. Miraculously, in
1993 the tree house is still there tor these
women to have a deeply emotionally soul
searching in .is illustrated by Moore's sig
nature single tear rolling down her right eye.
I he movie is one big joke, the story is far
too predictable. The tone is "good golly,
wasn't life fun and simple back in the '70s. All
we had to worry about was discovering boys'
penises and praying for big breasts."
The acting is worse than Traci Lords on
Melrose Place. I he film is filled with after
school-spec ial-carbon copy-emotional-mo

merits, such as young Roberta's loss of her
mother. Searching through library files for
clues on Dear Johnny s death, Roberta hap
pens upon an article about her mothers
mangled body in a car accident. In a fake
tear-filled fit ot passion, Roberta grabs the ar
ticle, copies it and stuffs it in her pocket.
Christina Ricci is a good actress, though
the editor and director tail to make anyone
look good. Ihe many sentimental pauses
make it seem the actresses forgot their lines.
I he cast does an admirable job of trying
to make the older women an exact copy ot
their 12 vear-old counterparts. Ot course,
this begs the question: Didn't these people
develop and grow at all in 2 •> \ ear si 1 No. I 101 l
man, who plays the young Moore, studied
quite well she even does the single tear
thing. Unfortunately, you lose all respect tor
her when she almost drowns in the sewer dur
ing a rain storm but is fortunately rescued by
( ra/\ lVte (1 )ear lohnin s father). Didn't the\
research how sewers work? They're designed
to stop Hoods and not fill up.
"Now and Then" thinks it's deep with the
message Moore repeats throughout, "You can
run from disappointments that you're trying
to forget, but its only when you embrace your
past that you truly move forward." The high
est paid actress in Hollywood, folks.
All in all, this is an average rental for a fam
ily with young girls, but as a Stanford student
who should be older than 12, it's a waste of
your brain cells.
