# Mallrats
## 
### 
Bad acting. Improbable
plotlines. Offensive humor.
Writer / director Kevin

Smith, 24 years old, was able to twist these
Hollywood standbvs into "( lerks,' the
biggest underground hit of last year. Smith
moves slightly up the economic chain with
"Mallrats," his studio debut and the second
part of a planned "New Jersey Trilogy."
Like "Clerks," "Mallrats" is populated by
losers with large vocabularies. It takes place
in one day in the same generic area of subur
ban New Jersey. It features a couple of the
same characters and some of the same jokes.
1 he plot, as much as there is one, revolves
around two guys who spend the day at the
mall trying to get their girlfriends back. Brodie
(Jason I.ee) is an unemployed comic collector
and Nintendo addict. As the film's comic lead,
he has some good lines: "Why buy the cow
when you get the sex tor tree? he tells his
friend at one point, illustrating one of the
tnany reasons his girlfriend Rene iust dumped
him. Rene, played by Shannen Doherty,

thankfully is not on screen that much. She
quickly takes up with Shannon (Ben Affleck),
the malevolent manager of Fashionable Male.
Shannon proceeds to heat up Brodie and tells
him he plans to screw Rene in a very uncom
fortable place (no, not the back of a Volkswa
gen).

T.S. (Jeremy I.ondon) is Brodie's nice guy
pal. He wants to take his girlfriend Brandi
(Claire I orlani) to llorida and propose during
the laws ride at Universal Studios. But his ro
mantic plan is nixed hv Mr. Svenning, her evil
father, who forces her to appear on the game
show he's producing at the mall. Thus the hat

tic lines arc set: The
mall establishment
of Shannon and
Svenning is out to
get poor T.S. and
Brodie because,
among other sins,
they have "no shop
ping agenda."
I'he film is full ot
cheap laughs via
cultural references,
especially to comics
and cartoons. "Is
the Thing's dork
made out of orange
rock like the rest of
him?" Brodie asks

when ho meets his hero, Stan Lee. Some of the
best scenes involve Jay and Silent bob (played
by Smith), reprising their roles from "Clerks,"
in Wylie Coyote-type attempts to sabotage the
game show, which serves as the film's climax.
The mall, too, becomes a character in the
film, as a spiritual vacuum which simultane
ously fulfills the characters but leaves an
emptiness in their lives. In other words, make
sure to read the store names in the first scene.
They're funny.
While "Clerks was a self-conscious com
ment of (ien X life and the service industry
generation, "Mallrats" is essentially just «i teen
party movie, sort of a more sophisticated "Fast
l imes at Ridgemont 1 ligh." The acting is not
bad enough to hide some decent comedy. It's a
good, vacuous, one-time ride. Still, I can't help
but miss the greater pretentiousness and
cheaper look of Smith's previous film. I hope
to see the return of Randall, the video store
clerk whose sociopathic obnoxiousness made
"Clerks" so great, in Smith's next effort. Es
pecially it its set entirely in a ). Crew catalog.
