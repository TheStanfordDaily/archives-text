# Sister, my Sister
## 
### Athima Chansanchai 
In an ordinary French provincial town, at an
ordinary house, behind ordinary doors, an
extraordinary world of fear, isolation and

sexual obsession unfolds. When you realize it's a true story of four
women succumbing to their darkest sides, you'll want to walk right in
and close the door.
Inspired by Jean Genet's play "The Maids" and adapted from screen
writer Wendy Kesselman's play "My Sister In This House", the film is an
impressive debut from American theater director Nancy Mecklcr.
From the beginning, you know tragedy is inevitable, opening as the
film does with blood-splattered walls (the end is not for the squea
mish). Then the film takes us to France, 1932. The walls are immacu
late. Fvcrything, in fact, is precisely where Madame Danzard (Julie Wa
ters) wants it to be. She is the ruler in this house, where she presides over
a trio of women — her daughter, Isabelle (Sophie Thursfield), and the
two maids / sisters Christine (Joely Richardson) and Lea (Johdi May).
Isolation and the desperate need for affectionate recognition leads
the sisters to commit incest. But it is fear that truly connects them and
propels them to commit murder. Tortured glances replace the dialogue
that is fast slipping away. The house becomes both their sanctuary and
their prison, a slice of heaven and a lot of hell.
exhibits spasms of panic at Madame's slightest reprimand. Yet
her sister's cool veneer masks an explosive rage bubbling after years of
repression. Christine is never far from Lea, hovering protectively and
possessively around her, both as a surrogate mother and jealous lover.
Madame is a delight to watch, in all her vindictive meticulousness,
her white-glove, upper-class arrogance and her indomitable faith in her
own righteousness. Isabelle is a silent and astute observer sneaking in
and out of rooms, at once homely and would-be temptress.
In this house, hands are always anxiously polishing, scrubbing,
sewing— belying terrible anger. The sisters' lives are regulated by bells
and rules, like in their girls' convent days (the maids' uniforms emulate
school uniforms). This perfect world disintegrates gradually, then
rapidly, as the sisters sink deeper into their world, rapt in one another's
arms. The final confrontation with Madame is more than a backlash
against abuse; it's second to their greatest fear: losing each other.
On your way out the door, as you tiptoe warily around the blood,
you take one last lingering look at a tornado of wrecked dreams, lost
hopes and love, shudder abruptly, and continue walking, realizing true
horror will never fail to mesmerize you if it is done this well.
