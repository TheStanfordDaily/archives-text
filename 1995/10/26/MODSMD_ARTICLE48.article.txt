After shooting "Smoke," Wayne Wang and screenwriter
Paul Auster co-directed "Blue in the Face" in two weeks
on the same set.
The word caught on in New York that an "instant"
movie was in the making, and local talent like Lou
Reed, Roseanne, Harvey Keitel and Jim Jarmusch
pitched in for the project. The directors held up plac
ards saying "Get to the Point," "Faster" and "Tighten
Up" while the stars waxed poetic about cigarettes, sex
and life in Brooklyn.
I'm not sure what the film is about really; it's a
process that unfolds before the audience in a peripatet
ic journey, as if Aristotle were wandering around
Brooklyn streets.
The film feels like a warm summer afternoon. It is
languid and flavorful and you never want it to end. Vi
gnettes from inside the Brooklyn Cigar Company,
managed by "Smoke's" Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel),
are interspersed with video sequences of people in
Brooklyn talking about roughneck birthdays and the
joys of Belgian waffles.
The film revolves around the smoke shop like a
planet's elliptical rotation around the sun. Sometimes
the action is focused on the tiny store and its inhabi
tants, at other times it drifts off into the nuances of life
in Brooklyn, but it eventually comcs 'round full of
humor and insight.
Wang and Newman assembled stars such as I.ily
Tomlin, RuPaul, Giancarlo Esposito (the heroin dealer
in "Fresh") and Malik Yoba and told them to act with
out scripts, budgets or time.
"It really was, in the best sense of the expression, the
lunatics taking over the asylum," producer Peter New
man says in the film's press release.
What comes out of this experiment is a meandering,
literary film that proves Brooklyn is lyric and people
are beautiful. There is no sex scene, car chase or shoot
out, but a subtle poetry to real life that reminds me of
