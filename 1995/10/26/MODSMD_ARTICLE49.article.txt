watching strangers smile to themselves on public trans
portation. It is cool to be from Brooklyn, Wang seems
to say in his two films, because it is cool to be honest
about real life.
Keitel and Victor Argo (Auggie's boss) give the film
dramatic presence as they assume their roles without
the intrusion of L.A.-styled egos.
Others, like Madonna and Michael J. Fox, try to fly
but their wings melt as soon as they hit the set; they
seem to be too sure of their stardom for the creativity of
improvisation. Roseanne is fantastic while Mel
Gorham, who plays Keitel's girlfriend, steals the movie
and is worth the ticket price alone.
See "Blue in the Face" if you're from New York, if you
like to talk or if you smoke Lucky's. If none of these
apply, then see it for the film's originality. It's a rare
movie that won't be repeated for a long time to come.
