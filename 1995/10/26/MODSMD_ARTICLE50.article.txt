## Tascha Damaskinos One woman's hairy experience 
### 
It was mid-August, and my summer job
was beginning to wear thin. I stood in the
bathroom one fateful Saturday morning,
experimenting with new ways to arrange my
hair in the mirror. God I felt dowdy. I.ike a
housewife and mother of five. I had to look
out the window to make sure 1 didn't own a
station wagon. Whew! It was then that I real
ized what I had to do — my hair.
I called my usual hair salon, but they were
booked for the whole weekend. Could 1 last
another day with hair like this? No matter
that 1 had lived the last six months with the
same hair, this was different. I was dowdy!
And 1 had just gotten paid.
1 leafed through the Stanford Directory,
hoping to find a respectable salon to whom I
could trust my long, flaxen hair. I found a
nice ad for a place called Hair Galleria ( take
heed!). It was on University Avenue, and it
said they were "professionals." 1 figured they
must be pretty good.
That was my first mistake.
When I got there, a very well-dressed Mid
die-Eastern man gave me a wide smile and
led me to a chair. To highlight hair as beauti
ful as mine, he confessed, he could not charge
more than $88. Right. A bit more than I was

used to paying, but 1 thought if they charged
more, they must do a really good job.
That was my second mistake.
1 chatted with my hairdresser for two-and
a-half hours while he played with my hair as
if it were a concert and he were John Phillip
Sousza. When he was done, he told me that 1
should part my hair on the left. 1 thought that
was odd, as it had always looked better part
ed in the middle. But he was the professional,
not I. So without a second thought, I gave
him a big fat $20 tip and gaily walked out.
That was my third mistake.
When I got home, I looked in the mirror
to check out my gorgeous locks. Something
wasn't right. 1 tried parting my hair in the
middle to see what the difference was. That's
when I saw it. A huge silver-dollar-sized
bleach-blond splotch in the middle of my
head. Aaaaaaah! Panic! Panic!
Upon further inspection, 1 saw that in ad
dition to the huge chemical burn spot on the
top of my head, they had missed highlighting
the first inch of my hair, and there were hori
zontal stripes along the side of my head in
stead of vertical highlighting. Aaaaaaah!
Rage! Fury!
By the next day, I had calmed down quite

a bit. 1 went back screaming bloody murder. 1
was placidly informed by the owner that my
hair looked fine. (I'm not making any of this
up!) After some "calm" explanation on my
part, he was forced to admit that it wasn't
quite perfect; however, despite being the
owner, he could not authorize a refund. I re
alized this was not going to be a good day.
After much debate, he finally agreed to
redo my hair, and that if it were not perfectly
done, he would give me a full refund. With
two witnesses to testify to what he had sworn,
I acquiesced and agreed to come back the
next week.
That was mistake number four.
The following Monday, after going through
a week's worth of hats, I went back. The prob
lem was easy to fix, I was told; all he had to do
was to dye the blond spot brown and highlight
it again. Simple. Dubiously, I asked if he was
sure that wouldn't damage the hair. "Of course
not," he said, "I'm a professional."
Mistake number five.
After four hours of dying and re-high
lighting my hair two more times, I had final
ly had enough. I stood up and looked at my
hair in the mirror. I saw that the big spot on
my head, once blond, was now blue. Blue.

BLUE!!!
At this point, it was only my upbringing as
a lady, and the fact that I did not have Freddy
Kreuger's razor fingers, that kept me from
slashing the owner's throat.
He mumbled something about the hair
dye company being at fault, and something
that translated roughly as 1 would get a re
fund when hell froze over. He asked me to
leave, as I was getting too upset for him to
deal with me on a professional level. Damn
straight I was! Not being able to tolerate
standing in Hair Galleria another minute, I
escaped.
1 have been in touch with him more than a
dozen times since then, with no more luck
than the first time. 1 have finally given up any
hope of getting back the $108 I paid him to
color my hair all the wrong colors. But I have
not given up on getting even.
So please, take my advice: If you value ei
ther your money or your hair, avoid Hair
Galleria on University Avenue like the
plague. Don't make the same mistake I did. If
I can save even one head of hair, I will have
served humanity well.
Hell hath no fury like a woman whose hair
has been ruined.

could trust my long, flaxen hair. I found a
nice ad for a place called Hair Galleria ( take
heed!). It was on University Avenue, and it
said they were "professionals." 1 figured they
must be pretty good.
That was my first mistake.
When I got there, a very well-dressed Mid
die-Eastern man gave me a wide smile and
led me to a chair. To highlight hair as beauti
ful as mine, he confessed, he could not charge
more than $88. Right. A bit more than I was

used to paying, but 1 thought if they charged
more, they must do a really good job.
That was my second mistake.
1 chatted with my hairdresser for two-and
a-half hours while he played with my hair as
if it were a concert and he were John Phillip
Sousza. When he was done, he told me that 1
should part my hair on the left. 1 thought that
was odd, as it had always looked better part
ed in the middle. But he was the professional,
not I. So without a second thought, I gave
him a big fat $20 tip and gaily walked out.
That was my third mistake.
When I got home, I looked in the mirror
to check out my gorgeous locks. Something
wasn't right. 1 tried parting my hair in the
middle to see what the difference was. That's
when I saw it. A huge silver-dollar-sized
bleach-blond splotch in the middle of my
head. Aaaaaaah! Panic! Panic!
Upon further inspection, 1 saw that in ad
dition to the huge chemical burn spot on the
top of my head, they had missed highlighting
the first inch of my hair, and there were hori
zontal stripes along the side of my head in
stead of vertical highlighting. Aaaaaaah!
Rage! Fury!
By the next day, I had calmed down quite

a bit. 1 went back screaming bloody murder. 1
was placidly informed by the owner that my
hair looked fine. (I'm not making any of this
up!) After some "calm" explanation on my
part, he was forced to admit that it wasn't
quite perfect; however, despite being the
owner, he could not authorize a refund. I re
alized this was not going to be a good day.
After much debate, he finally agreed to
redo my hair, and that if it were not perfectly
done, he would give me a full refund. With
two witnesses to testify to what he had sworn,
I acquiesced and agreed to come back the
next week.
That was mistake number four.
The following Monday, after going through
a week's worth of hats, I went back. The prob
lem was easy to fix, I was told; all he had to do
was to dye the blond spot brown and highlight
it again. Simple. Dubiously, I asked if he was
sure that wouldn't damage the hair. "Of course
not," he said, "I'm a professional."
Mistake number five.
After four hours of dying and re-high
lighting my hair two more times, I had final
ly had enough. I stood up and looked at my
hair in the mirror. I saw that the big spot on
my head, once blond, was now blue. Blue.

BLUE!!!
At this point, it was only my upbringing as
a lady, and the fact that I did not have Freddy
Kreuger's razor fingers, that kept me from
slashing the owner's throat.
He mumbled something about the hair
dye company being at fault, and something
that translated roughly as 1 would get a re
fund when hell froze over. He asked me to
leave, as I was getting too upset for him to
deal with me on a professional level. Damn
straight I was! Not being able to tolerate
standing in Hair Galleria another minute, I
escaped.
1 have been in touch with him more than a
dozen times since then, with no more luck
than the first time. 1 have finally given up any
hope of getting back the $108 I paid him to
color my hair all the wrong colors. But I have
not given up on getting even.
So please, take my advice: If you value ei
ther your money or your hair, avoid Hair
Galleria on University Avenue like the
plague. Don't make the same mistake I did. If
I can save even one head of hair, I will have
served humanity well.
Hell hath no fury like a woman whose hair
has been ruined.
