# Bonfire axed again
## Tradition on hold until survey done 
### Alex Scherbakovsky 
With Big (lame fast approach
ing, students once again face the
reality of another pre-game bon
fire-less rally.
Axe Committee Chair Craig
Zajac said he approached the Uni
versity's Public Relations Com
mittee about having a bonfire for
Big Game this year only to discov
er that the tiger salamander issue
remains unresolved.
The last time Lake Lagunita
served as a site for the 250 foot
high Big Game Bonfire was in
1992. Concern that the bonfire
endangered tiger salamanders liv
ing in the lake bed was a major
reason the University decided to
do away with the tradition.
Catherine Palter, environmen
tal planner with the Stanford
Planning Office, said the bonfire
will be put on hold until a conser
vation agreement study — con
ducted jointly by Stanford, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the
California Department of Fish
and Game and Santa Clara Coun
ty — determines whether or not
the bonfire is harmful to the en
dangered salamanders.
The results of the study are ex
pected to be announced in the
summer of 1996.
"This is the plan everyone is
waiting for. Once it comes out we

are going to find out if we are
going to have a bonfire in the fu
ture or not," said Zajac.
Although students won't see
the return of the bonfire this year,
the ASSU's Axe Committee —
which is in charge of the campus
wide celebration the week before
the Stanford-UC-Berkeley game
— is doing its part to find other ac
tivities to rally the campus.
Like last year, the Axe Com
mittee plans to hold a rally behind
Arrillaga Sports Center. It will
feature a small bonfire and ap
pearances by the football team
and the Stanford Band, said Axe
Committee Rally Director Leila
Durr, a senior.
Former Band announcer Hal
Mickelson will pass down the oral
history of the trophy Axe. This
year's rally will also feature the
Fleet Street and Mixed Company
a cappella groups, Durr said.
Despite the Axe Committee's
efforts to make up for the loss of
the bonfire, some students refuse
to settle for anything less than the
real thing.
"It's very disappointing that a
university that has as much land
as Stanford cannot find a place to
hold such a traditional event,"
said graduate student Wayne
Martin.
Hut other students like sopho
more NaSun Cho, a member of the
Axe Committee, are "looking for
ward to the rally and the energy it
generates."
Big Game festivities are not

going to be confined to the rally,
with activities planned throughout
the week preceding Big Game. "Big
Thing," a contest between Stan
ford and Berkeley a cappella
groups, will take place the Monday
before Big Game.
This year, the senior class presi
dents took the initiative to supple
ment Axe Committee-planned
activities by planning a food and

activities festival scheduled for
Nov. 17.
Although the details have not yet
been finalized, students can look for
ward to food provided by local restau
rants, as well as fun activities that,
according to sophomore ASSU sena
tor Bill Shen, who is helping plan the
event, will get students "pumped up
about the fact that we're going to
kick some weenie butt."
