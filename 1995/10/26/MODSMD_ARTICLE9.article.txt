Perot party succeeds in ballot effort
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California's top
elections officer said yesterday that Ross Perot's
new Reform Party likely has qualified for the
1996 presidential ballot in the nation's most pop
ulous state.
Secretary of State Rill Jones said early indi
cations were that the Reform Party has gath
ered more than the 89,007 voter registrations
needed to qualify for the March 26 ballot.
"There is every indication that they will quali
fy, although that is not official yet," Jones said at
a news conference.
The 18-day Reform Party drive collected about
10,000 more registrations than the 89,007 required,
said Russ Verney, executive director of Perot's Unit
ed We Stand America political organization.
"By this evening, we're expecting there to be
over 100,000 (voter registrations) that we've seen
and touched and photo-copied, and they don't
include those that were mailed in separately."
Verney said Tuesday.
Reform Party organizer Bob Tonelli of Sacra
mento said yesterday that about 108,000 registra
tions had been submitted.
The deadline for submitting the signatures was
5 p.m. Tuesday. Hours before the deadline, Perot
declared victory.
"He did it in 50 states in 1992, so there's no sur
prise that he could do it here," said Bob Mulholland,
political director of the state Democratic Party.
AFL-CIO elects new leader
NEW YORK (AP) — John J. Sweeney, who led
a dissident campaign to reinvigorate the labor

movement, was elected president of the AFL-CIO
yesterday in the first contested election in the
federation's 40-year history.
Sweeney, president of the Service Employees
International Union, defeated his longtime friend
Thomas Donahue, who had been president since
Lane Kirkland was forced to resign in August.
Taking the gavel and control of the federation,
Sweeney said the next year would bring "massive
efforts in the training of organizers, changing the
face of our leadership and working together with
our activists."
During a four-month campaign that divided
the 13-million-member federation, Sweeney had
promised to involve more women and minorities
in federation business and intensify labor's
recruitment efforts.
Belfast forbids whipping restaurant
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) — Whipped
potatoes, OK. Whipped diners, no way.
The burghers of Belfast have torpedoed plans
for a new restaurant featuring waitresses dressed
as English schoolgirls — albeit wearing short
skirts and black-lace stockings, and toting whips.
Judge John Higgins ruled yesterday that
restaurateur Tommy Alexander's plans to open
School Dinners eatery in downtown Belfast would
violate the lease by providing entertainment.
The entertainment: waitresses whipping
patrons' rears in mock punishment if they don't
clean their plates.
"I'm sure the decent people of Belfast will be
glad. We don't want immoral things in our city,"
said the Rev. Eric Smyth, a Free Presbyterian
minister who is lord mayor of Belfast.
