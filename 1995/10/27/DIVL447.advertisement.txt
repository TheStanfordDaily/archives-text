We Know What's Best for You
"A puppy vi c/.s walking up a hill. It
was a sleep liill. and the puppy was
tired. I'm tired,' said the puppy. The
puppx was tired because he didn't
make good choices about his health.
Then the puppy died."
-- Gurn Blanston
You pulled an all-nighter so you
could finish that take-home midterm.
Then you gulped down a warm
Mountain Dew. hopped on your hike,
and pedaled merrily off to class,
narrowly dodging that fat squirrel by
the Psych Department. How do we
know that, you ask? We watched you.
The Balance Beam is looking
out for you. All of vou. It's obvious
J J
you can't take care of yourselves. You
don't sleep right, you have atrocious
study habits, and your diet is devoid
of nutritional value. What's more,
you're neurotic, manic-depressive,
and incapable of maintaining a stable
relationship with anyone you know.
It looks like your well-being depends
on us.
During your time at Stanford,
you will face many difficult choices
regarding your health. Should you
eat some food? Should you sleep?
Should you drink water? We know
it's tough, but it can be enriching, for
in many ways, it is these choices that
make life seem like a balancing act.
It's almost like you're walking 0n...a
Balance Beam.
(That's why we named it The
Balance Beam.)
What with classes, homework,
and studying, you've got enough to
worry about without having to make
these choices about your health.
Luckily for you. you've got us. Let's
begin with the seven keys to good
health in this busy, crazy, mixed-up
Stanford world:
1. Eat.
2. But don't eat too much, and
don't eat lots of fat, because it's bad
for you. Eat maybe a salad, and some
pita bread.
3. Drink.
4. Water is good to drink. When
it's too cold, you might get one of
those pains in your head, so be careful.
5. Sleep.
6. You must sleep to live. Even
animals do it.
7. Don't bottle up your feelings.
Tell people how you feel. Call The
Bridge and tell us how you feel. Do
you feel good? Or, conversely, bad?
Call us and let us know. Please.
Just concentrate on following
these guidelines and you will soon be
healthy. We'll keep watching to make
sure you're keeping yourself healthy.
Because we know what's best for
you. Don't let us down. Remember,
the university that stays healthy will
sikmi be the absolute ruler of the globe.
