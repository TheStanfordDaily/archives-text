# Grants prompt early-bird research

summer, while the rest of us
watched reruns of "Friends," some Stan
ford students finishing their sophomore
years performed the research of their
dreams.
Breaking the myth that research is
only for seniors doing their honors the
ses, the Chappell-Ixjugee grant — open
only to sophomores — is designed to
encourage research among younger stu
dents.
David Richardson, a junior majoring
in symbolic systems, studied 12th centu
ry Aristotelian manuscripts in Paris.
"I'm interested in the use of Aristotle
in the medieval university," said Richard
son. "During the Renaissance, Aris
totelian science was in conflict with
Christian metaphysics."
Richardson said he was pleased that
he had the opportunity to begin research
as a sophomore. "For most senior honors
theses, you cram your work into six
months, which seems counter-intuitive
to the nature of doing research."
Richardson examined every Aris
totelian manuscript from that era in the
Bibliotheque Nationale, a library which
houses a large collection of rare books.
His research focused on reconstruct
ing a chronology of historical events.
"I looked at textbooks, to see how they
were constructed and illuminated in
order to keep track of the schools of pro
duction," Richardson said. "I questioned
the extent to which production was tied
with curriculum."
In addition, Richardson looked at the
notes that students took in the margins
of the book.

Richardson researched for five hours,
six days a week in August.
"It was a sincere pleasure to go to the
library every day," Richardson said. "The
manuscript room in the Bibliotheque is
beautiful, wooden and ornate. And I was
able to call forward beautiful illuminated
manuscripts over 800 years old."
Richardson's presence at the library
generated a lot of curiosity.
"I'm young, compared to the other
scholars doing research there. One time,
when I requested a book, a curator asked
me 'Why do you want the book — I need
to know why you need it,' " Richardson
said. "She was skeptical that I was doing
something legitimate. She acted as if I
were infringing on her work."
Katie Beman, a double major in
English and feminist studies, is research
ing the poems of Adrienne Rich by focus
ing on the poetry collection entitled
Dream of a Common language.
"My title issue is the theme of sepa
ratism in her work," Beman said. "Could
her coming out as a lesbian speak to men,
to heterosexuals? What does the book
hold for its audience?"
Since winter quarter last year, Beman
h<is been researching Rich's essays and
prose and reading book criticisms.
"I'm trying to contextualize her work
and her life," said Beman who first
became interested in Adrienne Rich's
work while taking the Poetry and Poetics
course hist fall.
"Then Rich had a poetry reading on
campus. I actually got to meet her," she
said. "Everything seemed to be coming
together, so I decided to apply."
The Chappell-Lougee has been a
rewarding introduction to academic
research, said Beman.

"I'm getting the same attention as a
senior doing an honor's thesis — maybe
even more in a way," Beman said.
Renita Thukral, an American studies
major, investigated the socio-economic
factors in public high schools in Chicago.
"I wanted to assess if the racism of the
past is now classicism by looking at the
socio-economic opportunities in educa
tion," Thukral said.
"I chose the Chicago public school sys
tem because it was declared the worst
[during] the Reagan presidency. There
was a reform movement in response,"
Thukral said. "The schools seemed ripe
for studying."
But her research encountered some
unexpected obstacles.
Thukral first contacted some "power
ful. influential" people who had either
created or headed reform agencies, she
said. She then interviewed teachers and
principals.
"Since I want to teach in the inner city
someday, I wanted to get an inside per
spective. I iilso wanted to assess the dif
ferences between inner-city and subur
ban schools," she said.
Chicago public schools, however,
weren't in session until after Labor Day.
"They were on vacation when I first
got there and came back when I was
ready to leave," Thukral said. "I was able
to interview many of them, t hough." She
is also still wait ing for some surveys to be
returned.
Overall, Thukral said she felt the
research experience had been positive.
"I've learned how to deal with the
tremendous bureaucracy," Thukral said.
"Now I have boxes and boxes of data. I
have two more years to mold the data, to
take it to another level."
