## Democrats in Congress displeased with Clinton 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Pat Leahy
is hardly known as a rebel. But after Presi
dent Clinton cut a hack-channel deal with
Republicans on a foreign aid bill the other
night, the Vermont Democrat could not
hide his anger.
"My inclination is to tell the administra
tion to take a flying leap," Leahy said, exas
perated that Clinton was working with
Republicans instead of through fellow
Democrats. His advice for the president:
"Hire grownups."
Another day, another Democrat in open
rebellion against the president — just when
one would think a unified Democratic voice
could help counter Republican leaders bent
on muscling their spending priorities
through Congress.
Just this week, Democratic Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota suggested Clinton
"demonstrate some strength and convic
tion" for a change, and Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon, also a Democrat, said Clinton must
curb his urge to please every audience.
Democrats are still seething over Clin
ton's remark last week that he "raised taxes
too much" in 1993. The president's hasty
retreat hasn't soothed Democratic lawmak
ers who reluctantly voted for the budget
package after Clinton pleaded his presiden
cy was at stake.
"Some people were clearly incensed,"
said Texas Rep. Martin Frost, head of the

Democratic Congressional Campaign Com
mittee. At one leadership meeting, accord
ing to a senior aide, Democratic Rep. David
Obey of Wisconsin told colleagues they were
wasting energy getting mad at Clinton.
Obey, according to the aide, said House
Democrats should just operate on the
assumption that Clinton would abandon
them.
The White House has worked feverishly
in recent days to allay such fears, sending
senior officials to Capitol Hill to assure
Democrats that Clinton would stand with
them in the budget battle.
To show good will, White House aides
relayed to Clinton a request from Nebraska
Sen. Bob Kerrey, head of the Democratic
Senate Campaign Committee, to make sure
Clinton criticizes "the Republican
Congress" — not just Congress.
And the White House yesterday autho
rized the Democratic National Committee
to buy more TV ads criticizing GOP priori
ties, reinforcing Democratic arguments in
the budget debate.
Still, because of deep mutual distrust
and often conflicting goals, neither the
White House nor congressional Democrats
expect permanent peace. Instead, the goal is
timely detente.
"It is inevitable that there are going to be
differences with the president from time to
time," said Frost.
