It's time to get things started...
NEW YORK (AP) — Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and the rest of
the Muppets are headed back to prime time on ABC.
"Muppets Live!" — a comedy-variety half-hour like their syndi
cated hit "Muppet Show" — will be a mid-season replacement under
a five-year production deal announced yesterday.
Though the original "Muppet Show" was set in a theater, "Muppets
Live!" will originate from the chaotic studios of KMUP-TV, with week
ly guest stars and a menagerie of Muppet characters new and old.
"Of course, if this doesn't work out, we'll start visiting people,"
Kermit, flanked by his sidekick Gonzo, told reporters at ABC studios.
"Going door to door!" Gonzo amended.

Castro upset by NYC potholes
NEW YORK (AP) — Fidel Castro, snubbed and denounced by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani during his five-day visit for the United Nations' 50t h
anniversary celebration, retaliated a few hours before leaving the city.
"I would not vote for the mayor," the Cuban president, grin
ning, told The New York Times during an interview Wednesday.
"It's not just because he didn't invite me to dinner, but because on
my way into town from the airport there were such enormous pot
holes."
Giuliani did not respond to the needling at a news conference yes
terday but reiterated his characterization of the Cuban leader as a
torturer and denier of human rights.
