# Yeltsin rushed to Kremlin hospital
## Russian leader suffers a heart attack 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” President
Boris Yeltsin was iushed to a hos
pital by helicopter yesterday with
his second apparent heart attack in
four months, reviving doubts
about whether he i<? healthy
enough to govern Russia.
The 64-yepr-old Yeltsin has
dominated post-Soviet Russia, and
his health is a matter of constant
speculation, particularly with par
liamentary elections scheduled for
December and presidential elec
tions in June.
The illness came two days after
a summit in the United States
where Yeltsin succeeded in boost
ing his and Russia's role in efforts
to settle the war in the former
Yugoslavia.
Aides said last night that Yeltsin
did not appear to require surgery.
"I'd say his state is less serious
than in July,'' sookesman Igor
Ignatiev told reporters at the
Kremlin. "The president is in
charge."
Yeltsin was hospitalized for
almost a month, then took a long
holiday after an attack in July of
acute ischemia, a condition that
restricts blood flow to the heart.
Presidential aides initially tried
to play down that attack, claiming
it was only a minor ailment. Yeltsin
later called it a heart attack.
Top presidential aide Viktor
Ilyushin said yesterday that
Yeltsin was suffering from the
same ailment, and he blamed it on
overwork.
" The president's condition does
not evoke great optimism," he told
a news conference. "It's unlikely
he'll be back at vork in the next
few days."
He said Yeltsin has canceled a
trip to China early next month,
and is making other changes in his
immediate schedule. A decision
was to be made today on whether
Yeltsin would host a planned sum-

Mit Tuesday of the leaders of
Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
Acute ischemia can be caused by
stress, high cholesterol, age or
chronic high blood pressure. Symp
toms include difficulty breathing
and chest pains.
Throughout his presidency,
Yeltsin has had periods of poor
health and has been dogged by
rumors of drinking. He has
appeared fitter recently, however,
and aides have talked about his
making a bid for a second presiden
tial term in June.
Yeltsin has said he is waiting
until after parliamentary elections
to decide. His popularity has been
hurt in recent years by the coun
try's declining economy and other
problems.
Before leaving for France and
the United States last week, he told
reporters he was fit enough to chal
lenge President Jacques Chirac of
France to a tennis game. And he
tried to demonstrate his improving
health in September by playing
tennis with President Alexander
Lukashenko of Belarus.
Aides said yesterday, however,
that the president had shown signs
of exhaustion at the end of his U.S.
trip. Ilyushin said he was working
too hard on the flight home.
"In the future," he said,
"Yeltsin's foreign trips should fore
see a certain time for his normal
adaption to different time zones
and several days of rehabilitation
after the pressure during the
flight."
Yeltsin was brought to the Cen
tral Clinical Hospital, traditionally
used by Kremlin leaders, yesterday
afternoon from his countiy resi
dence.
If Yeltsin were unable to serve,
Prime Minister Viktor Cher
nomyrdin would take over. Elec
tions would have to be held within
three months if the president died.
