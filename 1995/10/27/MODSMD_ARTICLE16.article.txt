WHILE HOMECOMING
weekend is a distant
memory, the legacy of the
alumni who attended lives on — to
the tune of over $11 million in
contributions made during the
event.
Alumni are not directly solicited
for donations while they are back
on the Farm, so it is indeed heart
ening to see our forebearers con
tinuing to support the University.
Support from alumni is critical
for Stanford's continued preemi
nence. Major gifts from wealthy
alumni like the Packards and the
Schwabs are obvious benefits of
keeping in contact and cultivating
relationships with former Stan
ford students.
But whether in the fields of
finance and politics or science and
education, when alumni proudly
pronounce their affiliation with
the University, it always enhances
our reputation. In the words of
Vice President of Development
Stephen Peeps, the support of

many 'small donors should
always be valued.
To that end, the Stanford
Alumni Association should contin
ue expanding the programs of
Homecoming Reunion Weekend to
stimulate support among alumni.
The Reunion is no longer just a
meeting of old classmates over a
tailgate and a few drinks. During
this past year's event, alumni
were treated to lectures by
Supreme Court justices, panel dis
cussions with current students
and classes taught by top-name
professors.
In particular, events that
involve student-graduate interac
tion should be encouraged. These
events give alumni an excellent
opportunity to see how their sup
port affects the students who cur
rently attend their alma mater.
As the Alumni Association con
tinues to improve Reunion Week
end, there can only be mrtre
record-breaking highs for alumni
support in years to come.
