# Apathy abolished
## 
### 
Despite many complaints
about Stanford's political
and cultural apathy, we
have witnessed sufficient activism
and initiative of late to prove that
Stanford students do in fact take
campus and societal issues serious
ly. Recent actions by student orga
nizations and programs have dis
played not only steadfast dedica
tion to ideals, but also a praisewor
thy desire for community dialogue.
For instance, in response to the
affirmative action debate, Stanford's
newly formed chapter of the student
organization Diversity in Action has
devoted itself to supporting the con
tinuation of affirmative action pro
grams. The establishment of the
Diversity in Action group in turn led
to the birth of Students Against
Racism, a group committed to col
lecting signatures to place the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative on the
November 1996 ballot.

Concomitantly, both the Stan
ford Democrats and the Stan fore
College Republicans have enterec
the fray. Believing that partisar
vigor and action will decide the
affirmative action battle, the cam
pus Democrats have invited th(
Rev. Jesse Jackson to speak on Nov
14.
Efforts to enhance mutua
understanding have also increased
Beginning this quarter, memben
of the student program "Cross Cul
tural Excursions" will work tc
increase interaction between the
various ethnic groups at Stanforc
as well as serve as intermediaries
for anyone who wants to explore
diversity on and off campus.
We commend such activism arie
willingness to explore and share
different perspectives and encour
age other students and organi/a
tions te) follow in these importanl
footsteps.
