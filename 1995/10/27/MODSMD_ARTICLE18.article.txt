Wilbur freshman debates campus grape policy

GIVE ME A grape. I am worried
that it wasn't just a little bit of
administrative incompetence
that hoisted this whole grape ban con
troversy on my shoulders. As a fresh
man, I should be spending my time
studying for classes, doing homework
and getting involved in different activi
ties. Instead, I find myself engaged in a
debate about grapes.
The process wouldn't seem nearly as
bad if I felt even vaguely competent to
adjudicate the situation. If President
Casper's grape committee, which met
over a period of one year, couldn't figure
the darn issue out, how am I supposed
to?

And the issue shouldn't be that com
plicated. Either my eat ing grapes
endangers myself or someone beyond
what can be rationally tolerated, or it
doesn't. That fact should be relatively
easy to ascertain. If President Casper's
committee didn't figure that one out,
what was it doing for a year?
Two weeks ago, the chair of the grape
committee came to Wilbur to help us
make an "informed" decision. The equiv
ocation was so careful and contrived that
the handful of students that actually
showed up left more ambivalent than
when they arrived. Apparently, the great
discussion we were supposed to have on
the issue was to wait until after the vote.

This was supposed to be the great
Res Ed experiment â€” an educational
opportunity to remember. Fliers pro
claimed the grape vote as a way to let
the student's voice be heard. The
administration was giving us our shot. I
am sure that I should feel all gushy
inside at such kindness, but I am not
very impressed. Not only did the grape
committee waste all of last year lament
ing over this issue, it has decided to
drag it on through this quarter too. If
the committee wants to waste my time
as well, it could at least make it inter
esting. Instead, it is probably breathing
a collective sigh of relief after getting
out of making yet another potentially

controversial decision.
The actions of the committee should
give us all a clue as to its actual beliefs
on t his issue. The supposed grape evi
dence did not convince the committee
to take a stand either way. Instead, it
has washed its hands of the matter,
giving us all our chance to feel good
about ourselves and the committee. If
grapes aren't a dire enough problem to
cause a committee of activists meeting
for a year to recommend a campus
ban, then maybe it's not worth sad
dling a bunch of frosh with the issue
either.
