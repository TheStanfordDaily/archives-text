# Daily's article on Review caricature tried to create news
## 
### 
"Daily resurrects Chief," or more pre
cisely "Review resurrected by Daily"
would have been a more appropriate
title for The Daily's "reporting" on this
dead issue, one which reached a highly
publicized stalemate last year. When
this issue was really debated, last year,
the Stanford Native American Indian
community repeatedly and publicly
expressed its displeasure with the carica
ture because we found and still find it
hurtful and racist in a way that The
Review has been either unable or unwill
ing to comprehend.
We told them that students from our
community (including the children of
students from our graduate student
community) had been hurt by the carica
ture, that it represented centuries of
ignorance about the "savagery" of
Native Americans and that we would
like The Review to remove this demean

ing caricature from their publication.
They said no.
Now, while I may think that, the peo
ple pushing this issue are incredibly
insensitive and basically ignorant, it's
not my place or any one else's to dictate
to The Review what they can and cannot
print in their newspaper. It's called free
speech and while there may be a fine line
between free speech and hate speech, it
is a line that The Review loves to dance
on.
My biggest problem with The Daily's
article is that it has created news rather
than reported it. We went through this
nonsense last year and have no inten
tion of trying to convince The Review
that common decency and basic respect
for other people behooves them to
replace their caricature with a less
offensive mascot. The Review simply
does not care and we're tired of talking
to deaf ears.
The Stanford mascot is the Tree, not
the Indian. While the Tree may suck,
the Indian is downright racist. .Just try
replacing any other visible minority with
the Indian and you'll quickly see why
(try the Stanford Rednecks, Negroes,

Chicos, Kikes, etc.). However, regardless
of our opinion, The Review has repeat
edly and explicitly stated that it has no
intention of changing its mascot .
OK, so what? I mean hardly anyone on
campus actually reads their paper any
way. But now, thanks to The Daily's on
the-ball reporting (remember, the carica
ture came back three weeks ago), The
Review's blatant repeat of last year's pub
licity stunt has worked. Why? Presum
ably, because The Daily didn't have any
thing better to print on its front page.
