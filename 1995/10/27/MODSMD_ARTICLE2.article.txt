# University to pool retirement funds
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The University's current system of two
retirement plans will be consolidated into
one plan by 1997 with more incentive for
younger employees to invest, University
officials announced yesterday.
Director of Total Compensation James
Franklin and Retirement Manager Lori
Lee unveiled the plan — recently approved
by both the University Cabinet and the
Board of Trustees — to the Faculty Sen
ate.
"Our objective is to deliver a better ben
efits program for less money if possible,"
Franklin told the senate.
Currently, the University offers sepa
rate plans for faculty and stafT, although
certain staff members may receive an ex
emption and enter the faculty plan.

After an almost two-year review, the
board decided to discontinue the second
plan which now guarantees that at age 65,
employees receive 2 percent of career pay
multiplied by the number of years of Stan
ford employment. The plan is now used by

3,400 non-exempt staff members and
those under union contract.
The new program, portions of which
will go into effect Jan. 1, is a slight modifi-
cation to the first plan. Under the
current policy, in use by 5,000
staff with exemptions and faculty,
the University contributes 5 per
cent of an employee's salary to
the retirement fund per year and
then matches employee contribu
tions to the fund up to an addi
tional 5 percent. Upon retire
ment, employees receive the Uni
versity's contribution in annu
ities.
The new policy, applicable to all
employees except those under
union contracts, will increase the
University contribution in 1997
and eliminate the annuity begin
ning next year.
While the maximum Universi
ty contribution will still remain at
10 percent, employees investing 1
percent will receive an additional
1.5 percent from the University
instead of 1 percent. Investing 2
percent will yield a total of 8 per
cent from the University. The
University will contribute 9 per
cent and 10 percent for employ
ees' investments of 3 percent and
4 percent respectively.
"We have been able to design
benefits in a better way at less
total cost, so we can afford to
improve the benefits," said Bar
bara Butterfield, vice president of
Faculty and Staff Services.

The change is meant to encour
age employees between the ages of
25 and 35 to contribute to their
retirement plans, Lee said.
"There is now an incentive to
put in a little," Franklin said. "The
early contributions have a long
time to grow."
Following retirement, employ
ees will receive both their contri
bution and the University contri
bution in one sum, Franklin said.
Two other major changes will
be implemented in January. The
University will lower the number
of banks where retirement funds
are invested from six to three.
Employees will not have to trans
fer money currently invested in
one of the banks scheduled for
elimination, Franklin said.
Second, employees will be
allowed to withdraw money they
contribute to their retirement
funds in the event of a medical
catastrophe.
The retirement plan revisions
began when a task force was
formed in February 1994. The
final report, issued in January,
was approved last month by the
Board of Directors and the Uni
versity Cabinet. It is the first time
this decade the plan has been
revised.
The current plan was ineffi
cient for around 300 employees
who received exemptions midway
through their tenure at Stanford,
and "suffered the worst of both
worlds," Lee said.
