# Critics overreacted to Daily cartoon
## 
### 
Here we go again. A person
expressed an opinion (it is the
Opinions column is it not?) which a
couple of people found "offensive," and
therefore, the person must be edited
out.
Robin Wall and Jennifer Jennings
expressed the opinion that a recent

Daily cartoon which poked fun of the
quality of food at Food Service "belit
tled sexual assault." I can assure them
that, having tasted Food Service food, a
shocking realization came upon me —
that sexual assault can't even be half
as bad. I can see it now. Some reader
"possessing more than a brain stem,"
who actually likes Food Service food
(much more difficult to find), reads the
Opinions column and concludes that
the author of a light-hearted article is
right and that he (the weirdo Food Ser
vice food-liker) may also like rape. He
then starts out as
ford.edu.
(live me a break. We are at Stan
ford, all of us have our values and they
are pretty much set. A small, light
hearted Opinions column is not going
to convert us all into rapists. Having
read your letter, I wonder who's the
one with only a brain stem. Is it The
Daily's cartoonist (who I think is really
good), the writers of the previous letter
or is it myself for taking the time to
write, criticizing an adolescent rant?
