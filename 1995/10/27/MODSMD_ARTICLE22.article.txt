## Liberté! Égalité! Fraternity!

ANYONE WHO HAS ever had a
girlfriend or two knows that most
relationships are based on noth
ing other than cold, unforgiving utility.
With that in mind, I arrived at the con
clusion that many of my female readers
have likely emerged from initial infatu
ation or disgust with the thought, "But
what can Josh Gohlke do for me?"
So, as Jonathan Swift might have
said, "This one's for the ladies." My
specialty being answers, providing the
definitive one to the question foremost
in the minds of Stanford women will be
the most useful service I can provide.
The enigma I refer to, if not already
obvious, has been phrased in various
ways: "Is there anywhere to go but
down after sleeping with an SAE?" Or,
"Is a Theta Delt sweetheart laudable or
laughable?" Or maybe, "Is dating a
Deke a political statement and, if so, is
it the one I want to make?" In short,
though the sorority hierarchy is all too
obvious - a precipitous slope starting
already well below sea level with the Pi
Phis — the order of the fraternity food
chain is far more elusive and complex.
Until now. For efficiency, we won't
count the traditionally or newly unhoused
fraternities, because — let's face it — who
does? America doesn't care about the
homeless, and neither do you, girls.
7. Theta Delta Chi: Theta Who?
Whatta Delt? Hey, guys, if you don't
have an image, nobody can sec you.
(5. Theta Xi: The Taxis scored a net

zero when one sophomore girl charac
terized them as "kinda funny, but
dorky." Nothing came of nothing when
another said, "That gross guy is a Taxi,
but they have really nice wooden
floors."
5: Delta Kappa Epsilon: "Hey, look
at me, I'm paradox personified. I'm
subversion from within. Sure, I'm a
frat guy, but I don't really mean it."
Advice for Dekes: The revolution will
not begin on the Row.
The Dekes are also seriously hurt by
a low score on the all-important physi
cal scale — only a couple actives and
none of the pledges are handsome.
4: Kappa Sigma: Horatio Alger's
favorite Stanford fraternity, these
never-ragged dicks dress up nice every
week and haze each other hard. Though
quite deficient in most areas, the Kappa
Sigs, through sheer hard work, have
pulled themselves up to No. 4 by their
own bootstraps.
With a rigorous workout schedule
and more testing of the boundaries of
heterosexuality, they could almost be
indistinguishable from the Sigma Chis
they've always wanted to be.
3: Sigma Alpha Epsilon: Starting off
the illustrious Top Three, one Arroyo
resident characterized this frat as
"People who think they're really good
looking, but they're not." The lesson is
one in positive thinking; the SAEs are
so convinced they're handsome that
girls believe they are.

2. Sigma Chi: Did you say "Adonises"
or "androgynous?" Well, it's interest
ing that the myth of the former
involves a hoar, because those winsome
white boys are not much fun either.
But they certainly know how to attend
church and dress accordingly.
The comely Chis gain enough points
to beat the nearest competition because
they fully realize the intrinsically
homosexual nature of fraternities. One
need only see the leers being exchanged
during one of those games of shirtless
lawn volleyball to understand the dou
ble entendres implicit in "Party
Tonight!"
1. Phi Delta Theta: Speaking of
which, I'm the farthest thing from gay,
but these guys are HOT! The Phi Delts
also have collective identity down to a
science, such that even the less-than
paragon pledges selected during recent
tough times can be identified as part of
the brotherhood by their delightfully
scruffy-cizm-sexy style.
"They travel in a clump," one upper
classwoman said. "Where you see one
Phi Delt, you always see three more."
No God-fearing white girl dare regret it!

Epsilon two years ago, but he wasn't
