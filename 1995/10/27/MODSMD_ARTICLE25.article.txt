## Big weekend ahead for women's soccer 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
The Pacific 10 Conference
championship and a first
round NCAA Tournament bye
will be at stake this weekend
when the ninth-ranked Stan
ford women's soccer team (12-
3 overall, 4-0 Pac-10) heads
north to battle Washington (8-
6, 2-2) and Washington State
(3-10-1, 1-4) today and Sun
day, respectively.
Stanford can clinch at least a
share of the conference title
with a pair of victories over the
Washington schools. Two Car
dinal wins coupled with an Ore
gon State-UCLA tie today will
outright secure the crown for
the Cardinal. More important
ly, however, a successful week
end will give Stanford the
inside track on a first-round
bye when NCAA playoffs begin
Nov. 11.
"We don't really hear that
much about [the Pac-10 cham
pionship! because one year it's
on, one vear it's off," said senior

defender Jessica Fischer, refer
ring to the rule which grants the
Pac-10 champion an automatic
playoff berth only in alternate
years. "So it's like, 'Hey guys,
we won the Pac-10 this year,
congratulations!' — Oh, there's
a Pac-10?"
With no guarantee of a play
off bid for this year's confer
ence champion, Stanford can't
rely on Pac-10 supremacy to
earn it a trip to postseason
competition. But barring a
total collapse in the season's
final two weeks, the women are
virtually assured a spot in the
24-team field based on their
performance to date.
Nonetheless, the hist thing
the Cardinal can afford is to
rest on its laurels. With only
eight of the 24 playoff teams
receiving coveted first-round
byes, Stanford must finish in
style to earn the favor of the
NCAA tournament committee.
"A first-round bye is impor
tant because, basically, it's just
a win," Fischer said "IWith a
bye], we've won the First fame of
playoffs."
Stanford also sock ; to extend
its five-game winning streak this
weekend. The women have not
lost a match since top ranked
North Carolina snapped the
team's 21-game home winning
streak back on Oct. 1. However,
the Cardinal did struggle defen
sively in a narrow 2-1 victory
over No. 21 UCLA last Sunday.
On the offensive side of the
ball, the Cardinal will look for
another big performance from
junior forward Erin Martin. Mai
tin poured in three goals in a (i I
victory over USC last Friday,
then added a goal and an a. i ( in

Sunday's triumph over the Brti
ins.
Washington, meanwhile, has
quite a hori" to pick with fh" Car -
dinal. Stanford ended the
Huskies' so son last year in a sec
ond round NCAA tournament
match that came down fo n< nal'y
kicks. "As soon as (last Sunday I
game wa over, our players w< >
thinking about Stanford, ?aid
Husky head coach Leslie Oil
limore. 'Revenge isn't always the
best motive, but our player ; i •

Washington State, on the

seven matches and 10 of it' last

the Washington school Tb y'\e
