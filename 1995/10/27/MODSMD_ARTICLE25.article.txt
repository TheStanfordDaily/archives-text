## Big weekend ahead for women's soccer 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
The Pacific 10 Conference
championship and a first
round NCAA Tournament bye
will be at stake this weekend
when the ninth-ranked Stan
ford women's soccer team (12-
3 overall, 4-0 Pac-10) heads
north to battle Washington (8-
6, 2-2) and Washington State
(3-10-1, 1-4) today and Sun

off bid for this year's confer
ence champion, Stanford can't
rely on Pac-10 supremacy to
earn it a trip to postseason
competition. But barring a
total collapse in the season's
final two weeks, the women are
virtually assured a spot in the
24-team field based on their
performance to date.
Nonetheless, the hist thing
the Cardinal can afford is to
rest on its laurels. With only
eight of the 24 playoff teams
receiving coveted first-round
byes, Stanford must finish in
style to earn the favor of the
NCAA tournament committee.
"A first-round bye is impor
