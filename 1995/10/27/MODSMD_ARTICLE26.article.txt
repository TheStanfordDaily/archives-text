Live from Stanford University,
where intellectuals are bred
to become free of all prejudice
by hating everyone equally, it's a
walk on the wild side for this week's
NCAA college football prognosti
cating session. Joining me in my
prophetic endeavors is Lois, the
pride and joy of the Stanford Uni
versity Primate Facility.
Lois, a 13-year-old squirrel
monkey, is ripe with age and expe
rience. While I didn't get a chance
to ask her if she has ever tried her
hand in Vegas, she seemed to have
a post-primitive grasp on the bet
ting and prediction process. And
the SUPF more than adequately
accommodated my attempt to get
Lois' predictions and point spreads
with the techniques it utilizes on a
regular basis.
That said, let's quit monkeying
around and dive into what both
Lois and I say is going to happen
this weekend. You'll find many of
her picks correspond with the
outcomes I had also predicted.
Hey, what can I say â€” monkey
see, monkey do.
Oregon State at Stanford
In a weekend contest that could
almost be considered a bye for the
Cardinal, OSU will pull its head

out from where the sun don t srune
(Oregon, that is) and travel to Palo
Alto, the next stop in the Beavers'
tour of Pac-10 chopping blocks.
But take a look at the Stanford
team OSU will be facing. This is a
Cardinal squad that is just now
beginning to emerge from behind
the facade of its 4-0-1 start and
show some of the familiar symp
toms displayed by last year's ail
ing squad. After holding UCLA to
seven points in the first 30 min
utes, the Stanford defense played
the second half as if they were
wearing steel shoes on a magnetic
field. The Bruins scored on five of
their six second-half possessions.
UCLA consistently outran a Car
dinal defense which displayed the
speed of a lethargic slug.
Lois picked OSU, although I'll
give her some slack seeing how I
didn't let her look over the
Beavers' team statistics. I'm sure
if she had known that OSU's
quarterback is ranked dead last in
the conference in passing efficien
cy and that no one from the
Beavers' squad ranks in the top
24 of either receptions or receiv
ing yards per game, she would
have altered her choice.

Or perhaps she simply likes to
pull for the underdog. Regardless,
anything's possible when the Car
dinal defense is giving up 15 more
yards per game than last year and
riding a two-game losing streak.
So don't discount her prediction
quite so fast. She may be a low
level primate, but she's not stupid.
Lois: OSU by less than 5
Me: Stanford by 6
USC at Washington
Once again, Lois goes out on a
limb. She's obviously got much
less to lose than I do, although
picking the Huskies over a Trojan
squad still shell-shocked from last
week's lambasting in South Bend
is by no means an asinine maneu
ver.
USC's problem at Notre Dame?
They couldn't run the football.
Washington's strong suit on
defense? The rush defense. The
Huskies held Arizona to 28 yards
on 29 carries last week.
Washington's problem? It
defends it's airspace worse than
the Antarctica Air National
Guard. Look for the Trojans to
feed off of that fault.
Surely Lois understands how
greatly it pains me to pick the Tro
jans to win week after week. They
may not play football in the South
American jungles where Lois' rel
atives call home, but I am sure

they have a colony of stuck-up,
snobby monkeys that swing on
gold-plated vines and slice open
banana peels with diamonds that
would parallel what we Homo
Sapiens know as the University of
Southern California.
Lois: Washington by less than 5
Me: USC by 10
Arizona at Washington State
The Cougars will be one of the
two other Pac-10 squads to duke it
out with the Cardinal over that
last bowl bid from the conference.
This contest against the Wildcats
shouldn't be an obstacle in their
continuing quest to play in the
Aloha Bowl.
As for Arizona, there's not
much more to say. Lois summed it
up very well when she scratched
herself and stared blankly at me
while she made the pick.
Lois: WSU bv more than 5
Me: WSU by 7
Cal at UCI.A
They're partying it up across
the Bay now that the Golden Bears
aren't cellar-dwellers in the Pac
-10. (Of course, they'd probably be
partying it up anyway, but we'll
assume the correlation just to keep
my introduction flowing smooth
ly.) But you would have to be a
team desperate for a victory to pop
open that $200 bottle of cham
pagne in ecstasy after barely
squeaking by the Beavers. (Again,
much too classy to be the alcoholic
beverage of choice for the Weenies,

but let's keep the illusion going.)
Lois also chose the Bruins, no
doubt remembering the way
Karim Abdul-Jabbar ran at will
against the Cardinal last weekend.
He ran down the middle. He ran
outside. Heck, he probably could
have run to the bathroom at the
snap and still picked up 10 or 15
yards.
I've been wrong on my UCIiA
picks all season long, and my fail
ures follow me around like a
curse. But I'm confident that this
weekend is my best chance to, par
don my choice of words, get the
monkey off my back.
Lois: UCIxA by less than 5
Me: UCLA by 6
Arizona State at Oregon
As far as I'm concerned, the
monkey population of the world
ought to be going ape over the
fact that no college or profession
al sports squad has chosen the
primate for a mascot. Take a look
at the University of Oregon.
When you've got a Duck for a
mascot, how can you possibly go
wrong by making a switch? The
Oregon Orangutans. I like it.
Lois would, too, although I
doubt that factored into her deci
sion to predict Oregon's victory
over ASU this weekend.
Lois: Oregon bv less than 5
Me: Oregon by 13
