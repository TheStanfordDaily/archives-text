Live from Stanford University,
where intellectuals are bred
to become free of all prejudice
by hating everyone equally, it's a
walk on the wild side for this week's
NCAA college football prognosti
cating session. Joining me in my
prophetic endeavors is Lois, the
pride and joy of the Stanford Uni
versity Primate Facility.
Lois, a 13-year-old squirrel
monkey, is ripe with age and expe
rience. While I didn't get a chance
to ask her if she has ever tried her
hand in Vegas, she seemed to have
a post-primitive grasp on the bet
ting and prediction process. And
the SUPF more than adequately
accommodated my attempt to get
Lois' predictions and point spreads
with the techniques it utilizes on a
regular basis.
That said, let's quit monkeying
around and dive into what both
Lois and I say is going to happen
this weekend. You'll find many of
her picks correspond with the
outcomes I had also predicted.
Hey, what can I say â€” monkey
see, monkey do.
Oregon State at Stanford
In a weekend contest that could
almost be considered a bye for the
Cardinal, OSU will pull its head

out from where the sun don t srune
(Oregon, that is) and travel to Palo
Alto, the next stop in the Beavers'
tour of Pac-10 chopping blocks.
But take a look at the Stanford
team OSU will be facing. This is a
Cardinal squad that is just now
beginning to emerge from behind
the facade of its 4-0-1 start and
show some of the familiar symp
toms displayed by last year's ail
ing squad. After holding UCLA to
seven points in the first 30 min
utes, the Stanford defense played
the second half as if they were
wearing steel shoes on a magnetic
field. The Bruins scored on five of
their six second-half possessions.
UCLA consistently outran a Car
dinal defense which displayed the
speed of a lethargic slug.
Lois picked OSU, although I'll
give her some slack seeing how I
didn't let her look over the
Beavers' team statistics. I'm sure
if she had known that OSU's
quarterback is ranked dead last in
the conference in passing efficien
cy and that no one from the
Beavers' squad ranks in the top
24 of either receptions or receiv
ing yards per game, she would
have altered her choice.
