# Floundering Stanford hopes to reverse fortunes against Beavers
## Football looks to right losing ways 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Oregon State rolls into town tomorrow, and it's
just what the doctor ordered.
After two consecutive disheartening losses, the
sickly Cardinal (4-2-1 overall, 2-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) hopes to get well against a Beaver team
that has failed to impress in 1995.
Oregon State (1-6, 0-4) is in the midst of a six
game losing streak, having just guaranteed itself
the longest streak of consecutive losing seasons in
NCAA history — 25 years — with a 13-12 loss to
California last weekend. Its lone victory this year
came against Idaho, a Division I-AA opponent.
Stanford is a 10-point favorite for tomorrow's
12:30 p.m. collision at Stanford Stadium.
Despite such indicators of an easy victory, Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willingham understands
the significance of Saturday's contest. If the lowly
Beavers can gnaw their way through the Cardinal, it
will be time to sound "timber" on Stanford's season.
"I wouldn't say it's done (if we lose,) but it
makes it awful difficult," Willingham said.
Players agree that the heat is on.
"I feel that there's a little more pressure not to
mess up, not to make mistakes," said senior tight end
Greg Clark. "Our backs are up against the wall a bit."
To push the Cardinal through that wall, Oregon
State must get its running game going at high gear.
The OSU option attack ranks tops in the conference
in rushing and has to compensate for the squad's
deliberately underdeveloped passing game. The
Beavers remain one of only a handful of schools in
Division I to employ such an offense, relying on its
uniqueness to throw opponents off their game.
Willingham, for one, can't remember the last
time he's seen a Beaver-style offense. "I know for
certain that it's not been in the last three years,"
he joked, referring to his tour of duty with the Min
nesota Vikings. The option has long been consid
ered prehistoric in the NFL.

Running back Anthony Bookman and Co. will try to get the Cardinal attack back on
track this weekend.
Outside linebacker Brian Hat
son believes that the option is a
fossil that is best left buried. "I
think a lot of teams have seen
it,"he said. "I just don't think
any football player is a stranger
to the option.
"The reads are easy. It tries to
lull you to sleep after awhile. Its
just a matter of being disciplined
and staying in the game."
Beaver head coach Jerry Petti
bone, a die-hard believer in the
option, brought the offense with
him when he arrived at Oregon
State five years ago. Even though
the squad has failed to improve
noticeably during his tenure, he
still stands by his decision.
"I feel that this is the best

offense to build a program
around," he said. "It oilers a lot
of problems in tei ins of unique
ness."
Redshirt fieshman Tim
Alexander now starts as the
Beavers quarterback, having
taken the job from junior Dan
Shanklin a few weeks ago I'he
athletic Alexander, a huh school
Ail-American, leads the squad in
rushing with fil yards per game.
When Alexander chooses not
to keep the ball, In "options"
are Cameron Reynold • in the 1< ft
halfback slot and Mai k ()lfoid in
the right slot Reynolds ha
gained 2(>() sard en <>2 carries
lor a 1 2 yard average md four
touchdowns. Olford ha: atna-.s»-d

scores.
When I'ettibone calls for tin l
fullback dive, either .1 I) Slew

ball The two have combined for
4b9 yards.
While Willingham may not be
personally familiar with such an
attack, he has a few ideas on how
to stop it.
'The first thing you have to
do when you prepare to take
away the option is identify where
its strength is," he said. "I think
i( - clear that the Beavers'
strength will be, one, their quar
terback He's a heck of a player.
Two, we've got to stop the dive. I
think if we take away those two
things, we give ourselves a
chance to stop their option
attack."
Defensively, Oregon State
ranks fourth in the conference.
1 lowever, when the offense aver
ages only 17 points per game
(only 12 in Pac-JO play), a mod
es! defense can't put a team over
t he top.

Free safety Reggie Tongue
and middle linebacker Kane
Rogers lead the Beavers'
attempt; to stop opposing
offenses. The two are tied for
second in the conference in total
tackles. In addition, Rogers
stands among league leaders in
quarterback sacks with five, tied
with teammate Marc Williams
for fifth.
It's not the OS IJ defense that
should worry the Cardinal, how
ever. With the exception of some
lost red /one opportunities
against Washington, the Stan
ford offense has demonstrated
that it can move the ball. The
team must concern itself with
the back-to back lackluster per
formances by the defense
"The biggest concern about
the defense has to be the overall
execution,' Willingham said.
"We've had some opportunities

where we haven't stopped the
run, some opportunities where
we haven't stopped the pa
We've just got to execute.
"The first line of [executing]
is that, at some point, it ha. 1 to
be a one on-one battle where
you, as a defender, are beating
that guy on offense. Right, now,
we're not winning enough one
on-one battles."
The team's disappointing sec
ond-half collapse last Saturday
had the potential to throw the
always serious Willingham and
his staff into fits of angei. When
the team gathered together for
its Sunday meeting, many
expected the worst.
"It was a little t'mse to see
how the coaches were goinf to
react," Clark said.
But instead of berating his
squad, Willingham chose to
focus on the positive , conjiratu

the defense has to be the overall

"We've had some opportunities

We've just got to execute.

Oregon State rolls into town tomorrow, and it's
just what the doctor ordered.
After two consecutive disheartening losses, the
sickly Cardinal (4-2-1 overall, 2-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) hopes to get well against a Beaver team
that has failed to impress in 1995.
Oregon State (1-6, 0-4) is in the midst of a six
game losing streak, having just guaranteed itself
the longest streak of consecutive losing seasons in
NCAA history — 25 years — with a 13-12 loss to
California last weekend. Its lone victory this year
came against Idaho, a Division I-AA opponent.
Stanford is a 10-point favorite for tomorrow's
12:30 p.m. collision at Stanford Stadium.
Despite such indicators of an easy victory, Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willingham understands
the significance of Saturday's contest. If the lowly
Beavers can gnaw their way through the Cardinal, it
will be time to sound "timber" on Stanford's season.
"I wouldn't say it's done (if we lose,) but it
makes it awful difficult," Willingham said.
Players agree that the heat is on.
"I feel that there's a little more pressure not to
mess up, not to make mistakes," said senior tight end
Greg Clark. "Our backs are up against the wall a bit."
To push the Cardinal through that wall, Oregon
State must get its running game going at high gear.
The OSU option attack ranks tops in the conference
in rushing and has to compensate for the squad's
deliberately underdeveloped passing game. The
Beavers remain one of only a handful of schools in
Division I to employ such an offense, relying on its
uniqueness to throw opponents off their game.
Willingham, for one, can't remember the last
time he's seen a Beaver-style offense. "I know for
certain that it's not been in the last three years,"
he joked, referring to his tour of duty with the Min
nesota Vikings. The option has long been consid
ered prehistoric in the NFL.


Matthew Lawrence— Daily file
Running back Anthony Bookman and Co. will try to get the Cardinal attack back on
track this weekend.
Outside linebacker Brian Hat
son believes that the option is a
fossil that is best left buried. "I
think a lot of teams have seen
it,"he said. "I just don't think
any football player is a stranger
to the option.
"The reads are easy. It tries to
lull you to sleep after awhile. Its
just a matter of being disciplined
and staying in the game."
