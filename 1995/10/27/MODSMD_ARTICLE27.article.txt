# Floundering Stanford hopes to reverse fortunes against Beavers
## Football looks to right losing ways

Oregon State rolls into town tomorrow, and it's
just what the doctor ordered.
After two consecutive disheartening losses, the
sickly Cardinal (4-2-1 overall, 2-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) hopes to get well against a Beaver team
that has failed to impress in 1995.
Oregon State (1-6, 0-4) is in the midst of a six
game losing streak, having just guaranteed itself
the longest streak of consecutive losing seasons in
NCAA history — 25 years — with a 13-12 loss to
California last weekend. Its lone victory this year
came against Idaho, a Division I-AA opponent.
Stanford is a 10-point favorite for tomorrow's
12:30 p.m. collision at Stanford Stadium.
Despite such indicators of an easy victory, Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willingham understands
the significance of Saturday's contest. If the lowly
Beavers can gnaw their way through the Cardinal, it
will be time to sound "timber" on Stanford's season.
"I wouldn't say it's done (if we lose,) but it
makes it awful difficult," Willingham said.
Players agree that the heat is on.
"I feel that there's a little more pressure not to
mess up, not to make mistakes," said senior tight end
Greg Clark. "Our backs are up against the wall a bit."
To push the Cardinal through that wall, Oregon
State must get its running game going at high gear.
The OSU option attack ranks tops in the conference
in rushing and has to compensate for the squad's
deliberately underdeveloped passing game. The
Beavers remain one of only a handful of schools in
Division I to employ such an offense, relying on its
uniqueness to throw opponents off their game.
Willingham, for one, can't remember the last
time he's seen a Beaver-style offense. "I know for
certain that it's not been in the last three years,"
he joked, referring to his tour of duty with the Min
nesota Vikings. The option has long been consid
ered prehistoric in the NFL.
