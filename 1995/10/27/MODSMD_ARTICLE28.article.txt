# Spikers set to keep wins rolling in Arizona

### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
After a lengthy stay in the Bay Area, the
No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team
(17-2 overall, 11-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
takes to the road tonight, traveling to Ari
zona for weekend matches against the Ari
zona Wildcats and the Arizona State Sun
Devils.
Stanford extended its current winning
streak to 14 matches with a straight-set tri
umph over California followed by four
home victories over top-25 teams Houston,
Notre Dame, UCLA and USC. The win
against the Bruins gave the Cardinal its
first season sweep of UCLA since 1991.
Since the start of last season, the Cardinal
has won 48 of its last 51 matches.
Tonight, Stanford faces an Arizona
State team that is coming off an impressive
five-game victory over No. 5 Washington
State in Pullman. The No. 12 Sun Devils,
after beating up on lesser opponents in
non-conference action, have struggled with
the intense competition in the Pac-10.
Their recent upset of the Cougars, howev
er, allowed Stanford to take a two-game
lead over second-place Washington State.
Senior outside hitter Christine Gardner
ranks first in the conference in kills. She
also possesses what many consider to be
the best jump-serve in the Pac-10.
"Stopping [Gardnerl is the key to stop
ping them," said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"If she is able to go off against us, that will
keep them in the game."

Shaw expressed concern regarding his
team's inability to stop USC star Kelly
Kuebler during the Cardinal's most recent
game last Sunday. Kuebler, a Second-Team
All American last year, hit .341 against the
Cardinal and recorded 23 kills.
"We didn't do a good job of stopping
her," Shaw said. "You can't have the per
son who takes the most attempts hit the
highest percentage. We'll have to do better
against [Gardner]."
Though Stanford defeated the Sun Dev
ils in three games at Maples Pavilion on
Sept. 30, Shaw acknowledged that the vic
tory did not come easily. "That wasn't an
easy match," he said. "They're an extreme
ly unpredictable team, so you never know
what to expect from them."
Nonetheless, Shaw expects more from
his squad tonight. "We weren't playing as
well then as we are now," he said.
Specifically, Stanford is passing much bet
ter of late, as evidenced by the even distribu
tion of kills for Stanford players. In the two
matches against the Los Angeles schools, no
Cardinal registered more than 15 kills, and
star senior setter / outside hitter Cary Wen
dell failed to notch a triple-double in either
match because she didn't post enough kills.
Shaw, however, will take the victories.
"When we're passing well, it opens up
our whole attack" Shaw said. "If we can get
our kills distributed evenly, (the other
team doesn't know where the ball is going
and] we're tough to stop."
