After a promising regular season that wit
nessed the Stanford men's and women's cross
country teams climb to No. 3 and No. 4 respec-

tively in national polls, the Cardinal now
heads into the part of the schedule where the
competition heightens and rankings mean
nothing. All that matters is the effort each
dedicated harrier puts forth on race day.

It's championship season.
The Cardinal will once again host the Pacif
ic 10 Cross Country Championships at the
Stanford Golf Course tomorrow. The women's
race will start at 3:30 p.m., and the men will
follow at 4 p.m.
The Stanford Golf Course, known as the
most challenging course in the conference, has
been the site of Pac-lOs for 26 years running,
while every women's championship has taken
place there since the inception of the women's
Pac-10 conference in 1986. Cardinal head
coach Vin Lananna believes there is no real
advantage to having the championship on
Stanford's home course despite its rolling
hills.
"I don't think there's any advantage to hav
ing the meet here," Lananna said. "I think the
advantage is that the women know how to win
the meet. Coach [Bethl Sullivan and I are con
fident that both teams are ready to put their
best foot forward."
The Cardinal women enter the competition
as the two-time defending Pac-10 champions.
Freshman sensation Mary Cobb spearheads
Stanford, having won two of her three races
this season. Other strong contributors include
junior Monal Choksi and sophomore Sarna
Renfro. However, the women will miss the
services of sophomore Kortney Dunscombe,
who is nursing a back problem. She finished
fourth overall at Pac-lOs last year.
With four top-11 women's teams partic
ipating, there is plenty of reason why Lananna
calls tomorrow's meet "the most competitive
race of the season." Oregon, which finished a
close second last year, returns another strong
outfit that comes in ranked sixth in the coun
try. With runners like junior Milena Glusac,
who took second overall in last season's race,
and seniors Jenna Carlson and Melody
Fairchild, the Ducks might force another tight
finish.

Sophomore sensation Sarna Renfro and freshman phenom Mary Cobb lead the Stanford
runners into the Pac-10 Championships tomorrow.
No. 10 Washington also fea
tures tremendous talent in
senior Joelle Brayton and senior
Tara Carlson, who boasts three
first-place finishes this season.
As sisters, Tara and Jenna Carl
son will bring a sibling rivalry
atmosphere to the competition.
Both are serious contenders for
the individual title.
For the men's 8,000 meter
race, Stanford looks to improve
on its fifth-place finish and break
up Arizona's pack. Last year, the
Wildcats placed two runners in
the top five to capture their sixth
title in 12 years. This year, the
Cardinal men may have the tools
to narrow the gap and take their

sixth Pac-10 title. Stanford has a
deep crew with the likes of junior
Greg Jimmerson, freshmen Brad
and Brent Hauser, senior Mark
Fadil and junior J.J. White.
The men's Pac-10 race will
feature four top-20 squads. No.
13 Oregon brings back six of its
seven runners from last season's
third-place squad. Senior Tracy
Hollister, junior Karl Keska and
sophomore Matt Davis pace the
Ducks.
No. 16 Arizona marches in
with a heavy arsenal. The Wild
cats are led by sophomore Bob
Keino, who finished fourth indi
vidually last year. He has placed
first or second in all of his races
in 1995. Juniors Margarito Casil
las and Jon Pillow and senior
Jeff Haynes will follow right
behind.
No. 19 Washington returns

seniors Colin Johnston and Sam
Alexander from last season's sec
ond-place squad. Both posted
top-10 performances at Pac-lOs
in 1994.
Lananna views the race as a
good opportunity to see virtually
the same field for next week's
District-8 Regional Champi
onships, the qualifier for the
NCAA Championships in Ames,
lowa on Nov. 20. However, Stan
ford will not overlook tomor
row's race.
"Each meet has its own signif
icance," Lananna said. "The Pac
-10 is our conference. It's differ
ent than the District-8. Here,
you try to be the best team in
your conference. It's a fun meet.
"1 believe we will run well. We
will go to the starting line very
excited and with the utmost con
fidence to rise to the occasion."

Wildcats placed two runners in
the top five to capture their sixth
title in 12 years. This year, the
Cardinal men may have the tools
to narrow the gap and take their

sixth Pac-10 title. Stanford has a
deep crew with the likes of junior
Greg Jimmerson, freshmen Brad
and Brent Hauser, senior Mark
Fadil and junior J.J. White.
The men's Pac-10 race will
feature four top-20 squads. No.
13 Oregon brings back six of its
seven runners from last season's
third-place squad. Senior Tracy
Hollister, junior Karl Keska and
sophomore Matt Davis pace the
Ducks.
No. 16 Arizona marches in
with a heavy arsenal. The Wild
cats are led by sophomore Bob
Keino, who finished fourth indi
vidually last year. He has placed
first or second in all of his races
in 1995. Juniors Margarito Casil
las and Jon Pillow and senior
Jeff Haynes will follow right
behind.
No. 19 Washington returns

seniors Colin Johnston and Sam
Alexander from last season's sec
ond-place squad. Both posted
top-10 performances at Pac-lOs
in 1994.
Lananna views the race as a
good opportunity to see virtually
the same field for next week's
District-8 Regional Champi
onships, the qualifier for the
NCAA Championships in Ames,
lowa on Nov. 20. However, Stan
ford will not overlook tomor
row's race.
"Each meet has its own signif
icance," Lananna said. "The Pac
-10 is our conference. It's differ
ent than the District-8. Here,
you try to be the best team in
your conference. It's a fun meet.
"1 believe we will run well. We
will go to the starting line very
excited and with the utmost con
fidence to rise to the occasion."
