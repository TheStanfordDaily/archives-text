After a promising regular season that wit
nessed the Stanford men's and women's cross
country teams climb to No. 3 and No. 4 respec-

tively in national polls, the Cardinal now
heads into the part of the schedule where the
competition heightens and rankings mean
nothing. All that matters is the effort each
dedicated harrier puts forth on race day.

It's championship season.
The Cardinal will once again host the Pacif
ic 10 Cross Country Championships at the
Stanford Golf Course tomorrow. The women's
race will start at 3:30 p.m., and the men will
follow at 4 p.m.
The Stanford Golf Course, known as the
most challenging course in the conference, has
been the site of Pac-lOs for 26 years running,
while every women's championship has taken
place there since the inception of the women's
Pac-10 conference in 1986. Cardinal head
coach Vin Lananna believes there is no real
advantage to having the championship on
Stanford's home course despite its rolling
hills.
"I don't think there's any advantage to hav
ing the meet here," Lananna said. "I think the
advantage is that the women know how to win
the meet. Coach [Bethl Sullivan and I are con
fident that both teams are ready to put their
best foot forward."
The Cardinal women enter the competition
as the two-time defending Pac-10 champions.
Freshman sensation Mary Cobb spearheads
Stanford, having won two of her three races
this season. Other strong contributors include
junior Monal Choksi and sophomore Sarna
Renfro. However, the women will miss the
services of sophomore Kortney Dunscombe,
who is nursing a back problem. She finished
fourth overall at Pac-lOs last year.
With four top-11 women's teams partic
ipating, there is plenty of reason why Lananna
calls tomorrow's meet "the most competitive
race of the season." Oregon, which finished a
close second last year, returns another strong
outfit that comes in ranked sixth in the coun
try. With runners like junior Milena Glusac,
who took second overall in last season's race,
and seniors Jenna Carlson and Melody
Fairchild, the Ducks might force another tight
finish.
