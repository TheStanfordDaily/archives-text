The Faculty Senate unanimously
supported University President Ger
hard Casper's recent statement on af
firmative action without discussion

yesterday.
Though Geology Prof. Gail Mahood,
chair of the senate, urged all senators
to voice their opinion — even if they
did not agree with Casper's view — no
senators chose to speak. Mahood said,
"Senate silence could be misinter
preted" and construed as dissent.
In a speech two weeks ago,
Casper said that because many
minorities remain underrepre
sented, the University policy on
affirmative action will continue.
The current practice is to give
special preference to qualified
minority students.
Casper's statement came as a
national debate over the 20-year
old policy continues. This past
summer, the UC Board of
Regents voted to suspend its affir
mative action policies in admis
sions and hiring.
In other business, the senate
postponed a vote on allowing mid
dle and high school students par
ticipating in University advanced
mathematics and physics pro
grams to receive Stanford credit.
The senate's quick and
unequivocal affirmation of
Casper's statement came in sharp
contrast to the lengthy discussion
over academic credit.
Twenty advanced physics and
math students currently receive
Continuing Studies credit in a
program which offers long-dis
tance university-level instruction
using digitized sound and graph
ics as well as on-line exercises,
said Phvsics Prof. Mason Yearian.

This credit cannot be applied to a
Stanford degree.
Yearian said giving these stu
dents credit which could be
applied to a Stanford degree
would encourage them to attend
the University.
According to documents filed
with the senate, such students are
now three times more likely to
attend Harvard than they are
Stanford.
While most professors support
ed the plan, some disagreed with
the justification for giving credit,
saying that students should
receive credit simply because they
deserve it.
"We should not get into the
habit of giving credit for recruit
ment goals," said Michael Brat
man, professor of philosophy.
"The rationale should be that the
students did the work and earned
the credit."
"If the six units is what is
motivating them to come to Stan
ford, I would rather they go to
Harvard," said Stephen Boyd,
associate professor of electrical
engineering.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni
suggested that the program
switch from being administered
through Continuing Studies to
the Registrar's Office. This would
allow the course titles and grades
to appear on a student's regular
University transcript. Currently,
these items only appear on a Con
tinuing Studies transcript.

As a result of the disagreement
about the administration of the
program and reasons for granting
credit, senators voted to table the
issue to allow the problems to be
resolved in committee.
In other proceedings, the sen
ate approved a plan to give stu
dents participating in the Contin
uing Studies program the option
of auditing a class.
"Many students are in [Contin
uing Studies classes) for the
knowledge," said Mason Yearian,
professor of physics. "The units
do not mean a whole lot to them.
Some fear that the prospect of
evaluation would scare them
away."
Provost Condoleezza Rice also
announced that Susan Schofield,
who currently works for the dean
of research, will replace current
Academic Secretary Marlene
Wine, who plans to retire at the
end of the year.
Wine, who has worked at the
University for 25 years, will actu
ally stop working after the Nov.
30 Faculty Senate meeting, when
Schofield will begin.
"She has given fine service as
academic secretary," Rice said.
"It's been a pure joy to have
worked with Marlene."
Wine said she plans to spend
more time with her family and
"explore life outside Stanford."
She explained, "I've tried to
balance career and family for a
number of years."
