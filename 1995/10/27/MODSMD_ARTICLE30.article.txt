# Polo desperate to regain early season form
## Cardinal ready to snap skid against Pepperdine 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
After opening the season
with a 12-2 record, the Stan
ford men's water polo team
(12-6, 1-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) has seen its
fortune ebb considerably. The
Cardinal will look to wash away
the memory of its current four
game losing streak when it
faces off against Pepperdine (9-
7, 2-3) at noon this Sunday at
DeGuerre Pool.
This weekend's game will
mark the second time the two
teams have clashed. During the
Southern California Tourna
ment earlier in the year, the
Cardinal edged Pepperdine,
escaping with a 10-9 victory.
Stanford held a five-goal lead in
the fourth quarter before self
destructing to make things
close. After losing three of its
last four matches by one goal,
the Cardinal would just as soon
take the Waves out of this
weekend's contest as soon as
possible.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, it has recently had difficul
ties coming out and establish
ing itself early. Just last week,
in a 8-7 loss to UCLA, Stanford

only managed one goal in the
first quarter en route to spot
ting the Bruins a 5-1 lead.
According to head coach
Dante Dettamanti, the problem
has been the shooting. "We
have just got to start putting
the ball into the net," he said.
"Our shot selection has been
very poor, and then when the
guys decide to shoot, they
aren't executing. In our last
game [against UCLA,] we had a
number of opportunities in the
first quarter, but we just
couldn't capitalize on them."
For the Cardinal, the
remaining games of the regular
season have assumed a new
importance. After losing its last
four matches, the Cardinal is
looking to post a victory in an
effort to get back on the win
ning track.
"We just have to start win
ning some games," Dettamanti
said. "At this point, it really
isn't a matter of rankings â€” it
is a little late for that. We need
to get our confidence back and
remember what it feels like to
win games. We want to be play
ing at our best going into the
