# Polo desperate to regain early season form
## Cardinal ready to snap skid against Pepperdine 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
After opening the season
with a 12-2 record, the Stan
ford men's water polo team
(12-6, 1-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) has seen its
fortune ebb considerably. The
Cardinal will look to wash away
the memory of its current four
game losing streak when it
faces off against Pepperdine (9-
7, 2-3) at noon this Sunday at
DeGuerre Pool.
This weekend's game will
mark the second time the two
teams have clashed. During the
Southern California Tourna
ment earlier in the year, the
Cardinal edged Pepperdine,
escaping with a 10-9 victory.
Stanford held a five-goal lead in
the fourth quarter before self
destructing to make things
close. After losing three of its
last four matches by one goal,
the Cardinal would just as soon
take the Waves out of this
weekend's contest as soon as
possible.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, it has recently had difficul
ties coming out and establish
ing itself early. Just last week,
in a 8-7 loss to UCLA, Stanford

only managed one goal in the
first quarter en route to spot
ting the Bruins a 5-1 lead.
According to head coach
Dante Dettamanti, the problem
has been the shooting. "We
have just got to start putting
the ball into the net," he said.
"Our shot selection has been
very poor, and then when the
guys decide to shoot, they
aren't executing. In our last
game [against UCLA,] we had a
number of opportunities in the
first quarter, but we just
couldn't capitalize on them."
For the Cardinal, the
remaining games of the regular
season have assumed a new
importance. After losing its last
four matches, the Cardinal is
looking to post a victory in an
effort to get back on the win
ning track.
"We just have to start win
ning some games," Dettamanti
said. "At this point, it really
isn't a matter of rankings â€” it
is a little late for that. We need
to get our confidence back and
remember what it feels like to
win games. We want to be play
ing at our best going into the
(Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Tourney). Going in with a
hunch of losses won't be good for
the team's psyche at all."
In Pepperdine, the Cardinal
faces an opponent that is used to
competing in tough games. The
Waves have played eight one-point
games, winning five. The relentless
Waves have also defeated the likes
of UCIJ\ and UC-Irvine, ranked
No. 3 and Mo. 4, respectively.
Oddly enough, however, Pep
perdine has struggled with unher
alded teams such as UC-Santa
Barbara and UC-San Diego. Nev
ertheless, the Waves are a team
that has stayed in every contest it
has played. Only once has Pepper
dine lost a game by more than
three points.
Junior two-meter man Alan
Herrmann paces the Waves with
35 points. Herrmann is a big,
physical player, and he is the focal
point of the Pepperdine offense.
"Herrmann is a very good cen
ter-forward," Dettamanti said.
"We will probably have to concede
the fact that he will score a couple
of goals, but (senior) Jeremy
(Laster] can handle him. Jeremy
is just going to be swimming him
up and down the pool. The key
with Herrmann is to get him tired
so that by the third and fourth
quarters, he is less effective."
The Waves arsenal also
includes Jack Kocur, who ranks
second on the team with 25
points. More important is the fact
that 12 of those points have come
from behind the two-point line.
"We are going to be playing a
pressing defense," Dettamanti
said. "We don't want to be crash
ing in on Herrmann because that
leaves a guy with a good shot like
Kocur open on the perimeter. And
when guys help in from the
perimeter, it really takes away
from our counterattack."
In Dettamanti's eyes, the
counterattack has been one of the
key missing elements in the Car
dinal's attack this year. In an
attempt to jump-start the transi

tion game, Dettamanti plans to
substitute more frequently, hop
ing that fresh bodies will provide
the bursts of speed needed when
countering.
But the transition game is only
one aspect of an offense. The bot
tom line for the Cardinal is get
ting the ball in the goal. In many
of Stanford's games against com
petitive teams, the squad has had
trouble scoring. In addition, the
points have come from too con
centrated a source.
"We need to get goals from
guys other than (junior Brian]
Wallin, Jeremy and (junior
Daniel] Lehoczky," Dettamanti
said. "(Senior Josh] Leachman
and [senior Dan] Hancock have
been doing a great job creating
opportunities, hut they just aren't
putting them away."
Dettamanti hopes that facing
the Waves will help bring Leach
man back to early-season form.
When the two teams last met, the
senior led all scorers with four
goals.
But Dettamanti is taking no
chances. To get more goals from
him players, he has made a num
ber of changes, including alter
nate six-on-five setups, an
increase in the counterattack and
the mysterious "Romanian play."
"The play is something tbat
the Romanians ran against the
team I was coaching in the World
University Games in the early
'80s," Dettamanti said, unable to
contain a smile. "It is really a
pretty simple play, but if a team
isn't expecting it, it can generate
a goal."
Trick play or no, the Cardinal
finds itself at yet another critical
juncture of the season. Rankings
and seedings aside, the team now
needs a victory for victory's sake.
Another close loss could damage
morale irreparably.
"We have to start putting
things together," Dettamanti
said. "We cannot afford to make
mental mistakes at critical points
in the game. Championship teams
do what has to be done to win the
tough games. We have to start
playing like a championship
team."
