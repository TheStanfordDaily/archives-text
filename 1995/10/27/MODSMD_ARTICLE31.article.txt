## 
### Alan Katon Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team (4-10-1 over
all, 1-4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
looks to rebound from Tuesday night's tough
overtime loss to the University of San Francisco
with a league match against archrival California
(5-9-2, 1-5) on Sunday at Maloney Field.
Cal currently sits in the conference cellar and
is looking to get out. The Cardinal would like
nothing more than to beat the Bears and stuff
them further down the hole.
The Bears split their hist two games against
Air Force and Cal State Sacramento. Hy van
quishing the Falcons, Cal earned its first league
victory of the year. The Bears have found noth
ing but frustration on the road this year,
remaining winless in six attempts.
Senior forward Jeramie Perez spearheads
Cal's offensive charge. Perez ranks second in
the conference with seven goals. Sophomore
Jason Young's four goals place him second on
the team in scoring.
Four goalkeepers have shared duties over the
course of the season for Cal. Brian O'Conner
has logged the most minutes and has main
tained a 1.45 goals-against average in the seven
games that he has played.
"Cal plays similar to how we play," said Stan
ford head coach Colin Lindores. "We are both
possession teams and try to make the games
entertaining."

midfielder Eric Vandevelde, who
has knocked his way through
defenses for four goals. Senior
Ryan Estevez, the second leading
scorer, has contributed three
goals.
Meanwhile, senior co-captain
Chet Zimmer anchors the Cardi
nal defense. The defense has
proved solid this season, helping
goalkeepers Ryan Craig and Jon
Bruck record four shutouts.
The greatest weakness for
Stanford remains its inability to
score multiple goals in the same
game. Three out of four of the
team's victories this season fea
tured 1-0 scores. Recently, how
ever, the Cardinal has played well
on offense and has pressured
opposing goalies for the duration
of each game.
"We played well," Lindores
said in reference to the USF
match. "Our overall play is better
and it is giving us more opportu
nities to score.
"(CalJ like ourselves, is not yet
sophisticated enough to be able to
do what we need to do and carry
the ball all the way to the goal."
Stanford is fatigued and
bruised after playing three
matches in four days, but in any
sport, a Stanford-Cal game is a
big game, so expect the Cardinal
to rise to the challenge.
