# Mr. Stone's wild ride
## 
### 
Oliver Stone told me never to drop
names. It was Tuesday night en route
from Stanford Memorial Auditorium to
San Francisco International Airport. We were
going 115 with the cops on our tail. "Don't
stop! Whatever you do!" Stone barked. I shift
ed into fourth without stalling the car.
Just so you know, Q&A with the man who
told us the truth about JFK is as likely as
simultaneously 1 > winning the state lottery 2)
being struck by lightening and failing one's
driving test four times. This is the story of my
interview with Oliver Stone:
Originally, my girlfriend and I just wanted
to slash Mr. Stone's tires. He was speaking at
Stanford before an audience of. well, a whole
lot of people. You were probably there Bven if
you don't remember it.
We figured Mr. Stone would have a rental
car of some sort, perhaps a Ford Taurus. Hut
we didn't expect the superlly stretch- glossssy
black KIT'T car complete with driver and cus
tomized California "GETAWAY' plates. Its
shields were up.
You'd expect a car like that to drive itself.
But the chauffeur was snoring away in the
front seat with a KZSI college radio simulcast
humming faintly in the background. I had an
idea the tires could wait I kissed my gir l
friend good-night, entered the car. slipped the
driver a c-note, kissed the driver good-night,
awaited my impending tete-a-tete. . .
Next thing I know, this big, balding,
bespectacled fellow, the bastard-child of Mus
solini and Johnny ('ash, is shouting in my ear,
"Why aren't you driving faster? What do you
want from me?"
Safely on the freeway, I told this three-time
Academy Award winner that I wasn't realh
his driver. "You said 'It is the obligation of the
filmmaker to discover the truth, " I told him.
"As a budding filmmaker, I d like to discover
tin* truth about you."
His beadv eyes darted from side to side.
"Who put you up to this?"

me: What validates your work above that of
other media figures or academicians?
him I'm sorry, 1 can't hear you. The win
dow's down.
me: Okay. Who are you to tell me what to
think?
him I am the only Christ you deserve,
me: Any Jesus-movies in the works, Mr
Stone?
him Actually, I wrote a "last temptation"
script in the early '70s, but that commie
Scorsese beat me to the punch,
me. What are your religious beliefs?
Mr. Stone punched me in the face.
I opted for a more innocuous question,
me Mr. Stone, how did you like Stanford?
him The professors feed you lies and you
knock 'em back like cheap liquor. Stan
ford's a cesspool, a breeding-ground for
conservatives. Ever hear of 'Nam?
me: You mean the Vietnam War?
him : Fuck you and your higher education!
You don't know what war is. You've
succumbed to the modern disease,
me: What disease is that?
him: You don't even know! No one knows! No
one's allowed to know except the biolog
ical war hawks. They're building new
amino acids, cloning frogs, breeding
mice with human ears. What are you
doing to stop it? Nothing! You kids with
your I'owerbooks and computer viruses.
. . . Don't come crying to me when the
CIA sends your mother to Siberia,
me: Come again?
him: Can't hear you, kid. Talk louder. Drive
faster. The Civil War wasn't fought
over slavery, y'know.
me l he Civil War was a crescendo, if you
will, of pre-existing economic competi
tion between an industrial North and
agrarian South. The slavery issue was
merely a subtext.
Mr. Stone punched me in the face.
him: You stick to the dominant paradigm
like it's fly-paper. But the truth is about

subjectivity, not facts. Shut up and
drive.
By this point the California Highway Patrol
had picked us up on their radar guns. Mr.
Stone waxed poetic, quoting Flavor-Flave:
#c&!!! the Man." I broke our awkward
silence.
me: Asian fetish?
Mr. Stone punched nit* in the face.
me What exactly is the director's role in
our post-modern society?
him I don't understand your question,
me: As a filmmaker, do you think
him: Ever kill a man?
me: What?
him: Who's asking the questions here? You
or me? You're a pawn, a cog in the
machine, a nothing. I could crush you
under mv little finger. You call this an
interview? Here's a scoop; That lecture
I gave at Stanford, it never happened. It
was all a psych experiment. You were
hypnotized. Zimbardo's the master
mind. He wants to pump you so full of
conspiracy theories you'll never really
question authority.
me: Really?
him: Do you doubt me?
me: No.
About this tinu' I evaded the pigs and found
my way to the Southwest Airlines Terminal.
The famous director and I parted company.
He was Hying back to Hollywood, 1 was ditch
ing the limo for a Supershuttle back to cam
pus. I thanked Mr. Stone for sharing with me
liis time, his candor and his thought-provok
ing take on life He punched me in the face.

Mr. Wish now is ci senior whose hobbie
include resetting his nose.

Oliver Stone told me never to drop
names. It was Tuesday night en route
from Stanford Memorial Auditorium to
San Francisco International Airport. We were
going 115 with the cops on our tail. "Don't
stop! Whatever you do!" Stone barked. I shift
ed into fourth without stalling the car.
Just so you know, Q&A with the man who
told us the truth about JFK is as likely as
simultaneously 1 > winning the state lottery 2)
being struck by lightening and failing one's
driving test four times. This is the story of my
interview with Oliver Stone:
Originally, my girlfriend and I just wanted
to slash Mr. Stone's tires. He was speaking at
Stanford before an audience of. well, a whole
lot of people. You were probably there Bven if
you don't remember it.
We figured Mr. Stone would have a rental
car of some sort, perhaps a Ford Taurus. Hut
we didn't expect the superlly stretch- glossssy
black KIT'T car complete with driver and cus
tomized California "GETAWAY' plates. Its
shields were up.
You'd expect a car like that to drive itself.
But the chauffeur was snoring away in the
front seat with a KZSI college radio simulcast
humming faintly in the background. I had an
idea the tires could wait I kissed my gir l
friend good-night, entered the car. slipped the
driver a c-note, kissed the driver good-night,
awaited my impending tete-a-tete. . .
Next thing I know, this big, balding,
bespectacled fellow, the bastard-child of Mus
solini and Johnny ('ash, is shouting in my ear,
"Why aren't you driving faster? What do you
want from me?"
Safely on the freeway, I told this three-time
Academy Award winner that I wasn't realh
his driver. "You said 'It is the obligation of the
filmmaker to discover the truth, " I told him.
"As a budding filmmaker, I d like to discover
tin* truth about you."
His beadv eyes darted from side to side.
"Who put you up to this?"

me: What validates your work above that of
other media figures or academicians?
him I'm sorry, 1 can't hear you. The win
dow's down.
me: Okay. Who are you to tell me what to
think?
him I am the only Christ you deserve,
me: Any Jesus-movies in the works, Mr
Stone?
him Actually, I wrote a "last temptation"
script in the early '70s, but that commie
Scorsese beat me to the punch,
me. What are your religious beliefs?
Mr. Stone punched me in the face.
I opted for a more innocuous question,
me Mr. Stone, how did you like Stanford?
him The professors feed you lies and you
knock 'em back like cheap liquor. Stan
ford's a cesspool, a breeding-ground for
conservatives. Ever hear of 'Nam?
me: You mean the Vietnam War?
him : Fuck you and your higher education!
You don't know what war is. You've
succumbed to the modern disease,
me: What disease is that?
him: You don't even know! No one knows! No
one's allowed to know except the biolog
ical war hawks. They're building new
amino acids, cloning frogs, breeding
mice with human ears. What are you
doing to stop it? Nothing! You kids with
your I'owerbooks and computer viruses.
. . . Don't come crying to me when the
CIA sends your mother to Siberia,
me: Come again?
him: Can't hear you, kid. Talk louder. Drive
faster. The Civil War wasn't fought
over slavery, y'know.
me l he Civil War was a crescendo, if you
will, of pre-existing economic competi
tion between an industrial North and
agrarian South. The slavery issue was
merely a subtext.
Mr. Stone punched me in the face.
him: You stick to the dominant paradigm
like it's fly-paper. But the truth is about

subjectivity, not facts. Shut up and
