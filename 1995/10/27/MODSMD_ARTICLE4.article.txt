The presidential election may be more than a year
away, but a new student group is hoping to capture
the political mood at Stanford a little earlier.
On Oct. 31, the Moderate Majority — a non-par
tisan organization seeking to enhance political
awareness on campus — will ask students to choose
from among 10 names on a ballot listing all of the
candidates currently running in all 50 states.
President Bill Clinton and Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole will be on the ballot, while former
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and best-sell
ing author Colin Powell and Texas billionaire Ross
Perot will not.
Moderate Majority president Danny Bramzon, a
sophomore, said the problem of low political aware
ness on campus was one which his organization
wanted to address. He noted that group members ex

pected about 400 voters but were printing 1,000 bal
lots.
Bramzon said the mock election would be a "good
introduction" for students who might be first-time
voters.
The original plan for the election was to distribute
ballots in residence halls and to allow on-line voting.
This plan was changed, however, so that ballots will
be distributed only in White Plaza because of con

dent ID will be needed to vote.
The group also wanted to more closely simulate an
actual election, where "the voter has to come to
vote," said Bramzon.
The Moderate Majority will be responsible for pro
ducing and counting the ballots as well as supervis
ing the voting. Bramzon said he is hoping to find co
sponsors to share the cost of advertising for the mock
