# New administrator for bike routes
## 
### Anita Krishnamurthy Contributing writer 
The University's Transporta
tion Office has created a new full
time staff position to make the
campus safer for bike traffic.
As part of his duties, new Bicy
cle Program Coordinator John Ci
ccarelli is in charge of a plan which
aims to change the street designs
across campus and restripe streets
to create wider bike lanes. The
plan should make crossings on
major streets safer without neces
sarily widening the streets.
"The goal is to make a place and
make a space for everyone on the
road," said Transportation Ana
lyst Patrick Siegman. "The roads

are for driving, but they're also for
walking and biking."
Ciccarelli will take suggestions
from members of the Stanford
community for any improvements
to the roads for bikers and pedes
trians.
Stanford's Transportation Of
fice has already put new bike lines
on the section of Campus Drive be
tween Alvaradoand Mayfield in an
attempt to move bikes off side
walks, where they can injure
pedestrians. Since Oct. 1, four
bike collisions have been reported
on campus, according to the Stan
ford Police.
In addition, the office will host
a two-day workshop titled " Walka
ble and Bicvcle-Friendlv Commu

nities" on Monday and Tuesday.
The workshop will focus on ways
to design public spaces such as
road paths and sidewalks in order
to make them safe and friendly for
both pedestrians and bikers.
"The workshop will provide the
nuts and bolts on how to design a
street so that it helps everyone and
so that people aren't afraid to walk
or bike anymore," Siegman said.
Community planners, archi
tects, traffic engineers and mayors
from the community, as well as
people involved in designing Stan
ford's streets, have been invited to
attend the workshop.
"On many streets, including
main arterials, people feel uncom
fortable biking, especially at
intersections connecting Stan
ford to other communities," Sieg
rnan said. "We want to work with
other communities to make these
really great places to walk as well
as drive and bike."
One student said the changes
are necessary.
"I think it's too crowded," said

sophomore Irvin Tyan. "We need
traffic lights or some sort of regu
lation. People should bike on the
right side of the road. Roller
bladers, pedestrians and bikers
just don't mix."
Siegman said new ideas for
designing the streets would even
tually help enforcement efforts.
"Enforcement is important,
but first we need to make the
streets safe," he said.
Ciccarelli is currently on a tour
of the West Coast looking at cities
with the best bicycle planning
and design.
