The University's Transporta
tion Office has created a new full
time staff position to make the
campus safer for bike traffic.
As part of his duties, new Bicy
cle Program Coordinator John Ci
ccarelli is in charge of a plan which
aims to change the street designs
across campus and restripe streets
to create wider bike lanes. The
plan should make crossings on
major streets safer without neces

attempt to move bikes off side
walks, where they can injure
pedestrians. Since Oct. 1, four
bike collisions have been reported
on campus, according to the Stan
ford Police.
In addition, the office will host
a two-day workshop titled " Walka
ble and Bicvcle-Friendlv Commu

nities" on Monday and Tuesday.
The workshop will focus on ways
to design public spaces such as
road paths and sidewalks in order
to make them safe and friendly for
both pedestrians and bikers.
"The workshop will provide the
nuts and bolts on how to design a
street so that it helps everyone and
so that people aren't afraid to walk
or bike anymore," Siegman said.
Community planners, archi

from the community, as well as
people involved in designing Stan

attend the workshop.
"On many streets, including
