# Christian Science grant clears courts
## $18-20 million awarded to University 
### Frank Guinan Molly Stephens Contributing writers 
Years of litigation ended in victory for
the University this month when the Cali
fornia Supreme Court upheld a settlement
agreement which will add about $20 mil
lion to the University's coffers.
The agreement — signed by the Uni
versity, the Christian Science Church in
Boston and the Los Angeles County Mu
seum of Art — divides a $100 million
trust fund between the three parties.
The University and the museum will
each receive 23.5 percent of the fund,
while the Boston church will receive the
rest.
The trust fund was established by Eloise
Mabury Knapp and her sister Bella
Mabury, the latter of whom attended the

University for one year in
1891.
After the settlement
agreement was signed in
1993 , the legal heirs of
the Mabury and Knapp
family challenged the
agreement, forcing the
three parties into two
years' worth of litigation.
"The Mabury trust had

been made as a result of the Mabury will
with a clause giving the heirs a potential in
terest in the trust,"
said Los Angeles attorney Mark Epstein,
who represented Stanford in the case.
Epstein added that Mabury's great
great-grandchildren "did not want to see
the trust disturbed. . . . They opposed the


Ford
settlement at trial, claiming that
it was "improper" to divide up the
bequest.
History of the settlement
When Mabury and Knapp died
in 1964 and 1973, respectively,
the fund was supposed to go
entirely to the Christian Science
Church under the condition that
the church publish and distribute
a book written by Eloise's hus
band, Bliss Knapp, detailing the
life of church founder Mary Baker
Eddy.
In virtually identical wills, the
two sisters demanded that the
book titled "The Destiny of the
Mother Church" become "autho

rized literature" and be promi
nently displayed in "substantially
all Christian Science Reading
Rooms." If the church failed to
meet the condition, the sisters
asked that the fund be equally
split between Stanford and the
museum.
For 40 years, the church
refused to publish the book
because many critics argued that
Bliss committed heresy by liken
ing Eddy to Jesus Christ. But as
the deadline to publish the book
approached in 1991, the church
reversed its decision and pub
lished the book.
The University and the muse
um challenged the church
because they believed the church
failed to meet the conditions out
lined by Mabury and Knapp. They
argued that the church did not
officially authorize the book or

display it substantially in all read
ing rooms.
According to Norm Bleichman,
a member of the Committee on
Publications at the church, criti
cism abounded both from inside
and outside the church after the
book was published. Some said
the church committed heresy by
publishing the book, while others
criticized the church for failing to
meet the trust's conditions.
As a result of all the negative
analysis, the church decided to
pursue a settlement agreement.
Bleichman said, however, that he
believed the church met the terms
of the trust fund.
"The board was aware of all of
the conditions and they had been
met," he said.
Funding the Farm
The Oct. 6 rejection of the

heirs' appeal now clears the way
for the trust fund to come to Stan
ford. The total amount heading
toward the University is estimat
ed to be between $18 million and
$20 million.
The University will have total
freedom in deciding how to spend
the fund.
"What to do with it has yet to
be decided," said Stanford Legal
Counsel Howard Pearson.
"This is a very important gift
to the University," said David
Glen, principal gifts director in
the Office of Development. "The
unrestrictive nature is important
to Stanford. . . . We can put (the
money] in the placcs which need it
most."
John Ford, vice president of
development, said it was up to
neither him nor his office to
determine what to do with the

fund. "The president and provost
get to decide what to do with it."
Glen added that the $18 mil
lion to $20 million figure "ranks
right there as among the top gifts
or pledges the University has ever
received."
"I would say it's in the top
dozen or so," he said.
Although the legal obstacles
are pretty much gone, Glen said
that it will be a "minimum of
some weeks" before the Universi
ty actually sees the money.
In addition, Glen said he
wasn't sure whether the gift will
arrive in a lump sum or if it will
come in several parts.
While acknowledging that he
wasn't aware of the most recent
developments, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper said he had
but a one-word response to news
of the gift: "Splendid!"
