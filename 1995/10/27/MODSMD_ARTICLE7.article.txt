# Alternative medicine study funded by NIH

The National Institutes of Health have
awarded a three-year, $864,000 grant to
the Stanford School of Medicine to help de
termine the effectiveness of alternative
medical practices.
I)r. William Haskell, professor of modi
cine and deputy director of the Center for
Research in Disease Prevention, will head
the Stanford team, which will study the ef
fect of alternative medicine on aging.
Haskell has previously conducted in the
area, most notably on whether exercise can
improve quality of life for the elderly.
Stanford is one of 10 centers to receive
such a grant from the NIH Office of Alter
native Medicine, which is expanding its ef
fort to develop research methods in the
field.
Alternative medicine — or treatment
that "lies outside the scope" of traditional
medical practice — is gaining acceptance in
the medical community, said Medical Cen
ter spokesperson Mike Goodkind.
The Stanford project's first goal will
be to identify methods and strategies
that could be used for the remainder of
the project.

"If you're doing a quality-of-life study,
you neod strong methods to determine
quality of life," said Goodkind.
One problem researchers face, he said, is
that it is often difficult to scientifically de
termine results.
"If people are feeling better after
they've started exercising, is it because
they're exercising or because they're in a
group at 10 in the morning and they have
new friends?" Goodkind asked. "These
are the sort of questions we have to deal
with."
The average funding for the three-year
grants is approximately $850,000, plus an
nual increments. The largest grant was
$1.1 million, awarded to the University of
Virginia School of Nursing. Areas of study
range from HIV / AIDS and cancer to pain,
asthma and women's health.
Acceptance of alternative medicine,
which includes yoga, hypnosis and
acupuncture, is growing, said Office of Al
ternative Medicine spokesperson Anita
Greene.
Greene cited a Dec. 7,1992 article in the
New England Journal of Medicine by liar-
vard Medical School Prof. David
Eisenberg, which stated that
seven out of 10 Americans use
some sort of alternative medicine.
Stanford's program was select
ed on the basis of "an intensive
research proposal," Greene said.
Continued supervision of the pro
gram will be the responsibility of
peer-review boards.
The NIH Office for Alternative
Medicine was founded by a con
gressional act in 1992 in response
to growing national interest in the
field. The office was founded in
order to fund research, train
researchers and disseminate
information about the burgeoning
field of alternative medicine.
While Stanford's grant has
been approved for three years, its
funding is contingent upon con
tinued congressional approval of
the NIH budget. Greene said the
NIH "is looking positively"
toward the prospect of its contin
ued funding.
The program includes provi
sions for further collaborative
research between the NIH and
the 10 grant winners in the
future.
