### David Stein 
Some of the lingering tremors
of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake were quelled yesterday as
restoration of the quake-dam
aged Stanford Art Museum
began.
Groundbreaking ceremonies
for the 120,000-square-foot center
took place in front of about 1,000
art patrons at the Rodin Sculpture
Garden.
The facility, which will be re
named the Iris and B. Gerald Can
tor Genter for the Visual Arts, will
greatly increase Stanford's art re
sources, adding galleries for con
temporary art and special exhibi
tions, new sculpture gardens and
a 120-seat lecture and perfor
mance hall.
"The museum will be a place
where all the arts at Stanford can
flourish," said Stanford Art Muse
um Director Thomas Seligman.
He stressed that the museum will
"broaden the University," since
many more academic depart
ments would make use of the new
facilities.
University President Gerhard
Casper echoed Seligman's re
marks.
"We need the bark and bite of
art," Gasper said. "We need art to
