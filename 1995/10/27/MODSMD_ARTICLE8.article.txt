# Musuem's rebirth
## Rebuilding ready to go 
### David Stein 
Some of the lingering tremors
of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake were quelled yesterday as
restoration of the quake-dam
aged Stanford Art Museum
began.
Groundbreaking ceremonies
for the 120,000-square-foot center
took place in front of about 1,000
art patrons at the Rodin Sculpture
Garden.
The facility, which will be re
named the Iris and B. Gerald Can
tor Genter for the Visual Arts, will
greatly increase Stanford's art re
sources, adding galleries for con
temporary art and special exhibi
tions, new sculpture gardens and
a 120-seat lecture and perfor
mance hall.
"The museum will be a place
where all the arts at Stanford can
flourish," said Stanford Art Muse
um Director Thomas Seligman.
He stressed that the museum will
"broaden the University," since
many more academic depart
ments would make use of the new
facilities.
University President Gerhard
Casper echoed Seligman's re
marks.
"We need the bark and bite of
art," Gasper said. "We need art to

stimulate the search for secrets of
the day and to understand the feel
ings find fundamental ideas about
h u man existence."
In a symbolic gesture, a crane
carried away an e<irthquake-dam
aged staircase, clearing the way for
construction.
The museum was described by
architect James Stewart Polshek as
a "fusing of a historical and extreme

ly modern building." The existing
building will be restored alongside a
new building.
He added that it will be more
"physically accessible" to students,
and the new building will contain a
cafe and a bookstore to attract more
museum-goers. An advanced light
ing system and special climate con
trol are also part of the renovation.
Originally slated to open in 1997,
the arts center will now open its
doors in early 1998. liecause the $.31
million fund-raising campaign had
already been completed, the delay
was attributed to artistic rather

than economic factors.
"We did not want to rush into any
artificial schedule because we were
dealing with a very complex project,"
said Seligman. "We wen' concerned
with getting it done right."
Seligman also noted "the extraor
dinary support of the community for
thus institution." He added, howev
er, that the construction was merely
"a sign marker in a long, historic
path" that will extend into the
future.
Before construction began, the
museum's entire collection was
packed up and storid in Encina 1 lall.

Witnessing the groundbreaking
were donors to the museum, mem
bers of the art community and Uni
versity administrators including
Provost Condoleezza Rice and Assis
tant to the President Jean Fetter.
A festive atmosphere was provid
ed by the Stanford Taiko Drummers
and Stanford Chorale.
The museum was originally found
ed in 1891 by Leland and Jane Skin
fold as a second memorial to their son,
Iceland Jr. Containing more than
20,(XX) pieces of art, it specializes in
Asian and Native American art as well
as American and European paintings.
