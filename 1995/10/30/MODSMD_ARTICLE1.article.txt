# Protesters condemn UC regent
## 
### Marni Leff 
Chanting for justice and af
firmative action, 20 Stanford
students marched with 50
other protesters from the Bay
Area to a University of Califor
nia Regent's home yesterday.
The activists, representing
Youth for Justice and other
groups, protested in front of UC
Regent and former Hoover In
stitution Director Glenn Camp
bell's home in Los Altos Hills to
call attention to affirmative ac
tion's continued importance.
Carrying masks with a cut
out of Campbell's face, the
demonstrators planned to voice
their opinions, talk to Campbell
in front of his home and then
present him with a contract and
demand he sign it.
Campbell was not home but
he said later he drove by during
the protest.
"I thought it was outrageous
that [the protesters] went onto
private property," Campbell
said. "They should learn some
manners."
As far as a response to the
protest, Campbell said, "I've
been consulting my lawyer."
The protest came in the
wake of the UC Regents vote
last summer to end affirmative
action in admissions, hiring and
contracts at all UC schools.
Youth for Justice, a Bay Area
group, planned the demonstra
tion, and students from Stan
ford, UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa
