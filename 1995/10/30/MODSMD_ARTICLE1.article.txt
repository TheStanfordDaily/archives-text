# Protesters condemn UC regent
## 
### Marni Leff 
Chanting for justice and af
firmative action, 20 Stanford
students marched with 50
other protesters from the Bay
Area to a University of Califor
nia Regent's home yesterday.
The activists, representing
Youth for Justice and other
groups, protested in front of UC
Regent and former Hoover In
stitution Director Glenn Camp
bell's home in Los Altos Hills to
call attention to affirmative ac
tion's continued importance.
Carrying masks with a cut
out of Campbell's face, the
demonstrators planned to voice
their opinions, talk to Campbell
in front of his home and then
present him with a contract and
demand he sign it.
Campbell was not home but
he said later he drove by during
the protest.
"I thought it was outrageous
that [the protesters] went onto
private property," Campbell
said. "They should learn some
manners."
As far as a response to the
protest, Campbell said, "I've
been consulting my lawyer."
The protest came in the
wake of the UC Regents vote
last summer to end affirmative
action in admissions, hiring and
contracts at all UC schools.
Youth for Justice, a Bay Area
group, planned the demonstra
tion, and students from Stan
ford, UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa

Cut-out masks of Glen Campbell's face were left yesterday at the UC regent's home as a message of
protesters' support of affirmative action.
Cruz and other organizations
joined in.
While Stanford has a clear
affirmative action policy, many
students said they feel it's all the
more important to protest the UC
Regents' decision and work to
reverse it.
"It's really important as Stan
ford students to assist in the larg
er struggles," said senior Kris
Hayashi. "Affirmative action
affects everyone. It's about access
to education and a trend in other
areas. It doesn't create a healthy
society when people are denied
access to education because of
race or gender."
Because Campbell served as
director of the Hoover Institution
for 30 years, some Stanford
protesters felt visiting his home

and showing that they disagreed
with his decision was especially
important.
"We came to send a message,"
said sophomore Monisha Bajaj.
"Basically, it's important for us to
link into other organizations in
the Bay Area.
"This is close to home because
Glenn Campbell is affiliated with
Stanford. Me has been on the
campus and worked here for so
many years," Bajaj said. "We need
to show him that just because we
go to Stanford, we don't approve
of what he's doing to our lives and
the lives of our sisters and broth
ers."
The protesters assembled at
Stanford and then drove together
to Campbell's home. Waving fluo
rescent green signs and shouting,
"Glenn, come out," the protesters
filled Campbell's driveway, form
ing a mass outside his house.
Though Campbell wasn't
home, Oakland Technical High

School senior Sandra Ramirez
who helped organize the protest,
voiced the group's demands, and
other high schoolers read from a
contract Youth for Justice had
prepared for Campbell to sign.
The contract, which the
protesters propped against Camp
bell's front door next to a life-size
dummy of Campbell, pledges sup
port for affirmative action.
After leaving the masks, signs,
the dummy and the contract,
protesters returned to Stanford
to debrief.
"I came today because 10 years
from now, Glenn Campbell's
going to be dead," Ramirez said.
"I'm going to be stuck with deci
sions he made about my race and
other races. I'm not going to sit
down and take his decision and
end up at a community college."
Ramirez added that she thinks
Campbell found out about the
demonstration, and that was why
he wasn't home.

Bajaj said the rally was an
important opportunity for mem
bers of many different organiza
tions and students from different
high schools and colleges to come
together and establish connec
tions while at the same time deliv
ering a message.
"I hope (Campbell] sees it as a
powerful message. We aren't
going to sit down and listen to
him," she said. "We are going to
confront him, not violently, but to
let him know we won't let him
abuse his power."
With so many high school stu
dents involved in the protest,
Bajaj added, "it's really wonderful
to see them organizing and taking
ownership of this issue because
they are the ones who are going to
be most affected by it."
Debate over affirmative action
continues on campus this week
with an open forum, sponsored in
part by the ASSU, Wednesday at
7 p.m. in Cubherley Auditorium.
