## S. Africa to hold first all-race local votes 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — In one race, a
black housekeeper is running
against her white boss. In oth
ers, black candidates for the
party that created apartheid
seek votes where they once
might have found death.
On Wednesday, South .Africa
faces its first all-race elections
since new black voters handed
Nelson Mandela control of the
country last year, sending the
white-led National Party pack
ing after 46 years of apartheid.
Dozens of parties represent
ing all races and ideologies will
compete for spots on roughly 700
local councils. Most of the elec
tions are expected to create
black-led councils in areas previ
ously run exclusively by whites.
But however dramatic the
political changes, the nation is still
struggling to overcome decades of
sharp racial divisions. It is, afler
all, just 1 1/2 years since Man
dela's African National Congress

won the first all-race poll.
Officials have suspended the
vote in Cape Town and KwaZulu-
Natal province because of politi
cal disputes, so millions can't
choose their local leaders until
next year. Even President Man
dela, who registered to vote in the
Cape Town area, won't be voting.
The government also post
poned voting in rural areas near
Johannesburg until Nov. 29
because of confusion over dis
tricts and voter registration.
Some white farmers have
kicked black laborers off their
land, hoping to reduce the num
ber of black voters and increase
chances of white colleagues
retaining control of local councils.
But while scattered violence is
possible, the widespread clashes
and bombings that preceded the
April 1994 vote are considered
unlikely; there is growing toler
ance in a nation where political
rivals used to kill and burn each
other routinely.
A key issue nationwide has
been the performance of Man
dela's government. Opponents
accuse it of failing to deliver its
promised "better life for all" and
allowing crime to run rampant.
"Where are the houses and
jobs? Don't be fooled again,"
exhorts a prominent National
Party campaign poster — even
though party leader F.W. de
Klerk is a deputy president
under Mandela.
The ANC contends the gov
ernment cannot begin providing
power, clean water and houses for
millions of poor blacks until local
officials fire in place to administer
the process — and that newly
enfranchised voters should
nonetheless come out to the polls.
"I appeal to all of you who
have the right to vote: Go to the
polling station and cast your vote
whatever organization or
individual you support," Man
dela said yesterday.
