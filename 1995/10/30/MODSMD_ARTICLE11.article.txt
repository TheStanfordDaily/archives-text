# 'Tomorrow night, a people will be born'
## Quebeckers to vote on secession 
### 
MONTREAL (AP) - The two
sides in Quebec's bloodless but bit
ter war of secession made emotion
al final appeals yesterday to the
undeclared voters who will cast the
crucial ballots in the vote on split
ting from Canada.
"We know we have a chance to
win — let's grasp it," separatist
leader Lucien Bouchard told one of
the last rallies before today's refer
endum. "Tomorrow night, a people
will be born."
The latest poll, by the Montreal
company Leger-Ijeger, gave the
separatists an edge among decided
voters but concluded, after appor
tioning the undecideds, that the
referendum was a dead heat.
"It's impossible to predict the
winning camp," said Jean-Marc
1 iCger, the company's president.
In the city of Hull, at his last
rally as head of the federalist cause,
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said
separation would be a deep loss for
all Canadians, including his fellow
Quebeckers.
"Canada without Quebec is no
longer Canada," Chretien said.
"Quebec without Canada is no
longer Quebec."
The flag-waving crowd sang the
national anthem, "() Canada" —
the French version and English
version resounding simultaneously
through a museum auditorium.
About 5 million people in the
mostly French-speaking province
are eligible to vote, including
roughly 10 percent who said they
hadn't made up their minds as of
ktst week. Election officials predict
an exceptionally high turnout.
The separatists and federalists
each said they were mobilizing
more than 80,000 volunteers to
help maximize the turnout of sym
pathetic voters.
"It's urgent," Bouchard told
supporters. "Everyone must use
the hours that are left to convince
one or two undecided voters."
Police also were mobilizing, par
ticularly in bilingual Montreal and
in Hull, in western Quebec across
the Ottawa River from Ontario.
1 "In this case, to be honest, we

are a bit more touchy because it's
more emotional than an election,"
said Hull policeman Yves Martel.
Montreal riot police were on
standby: Following a 1980 indepen
dence referendum, defeated sepa
ratists marched through the
wealthy anglophone enclave of
Westmount, a bastion of federalists.
About 82 percent of Quebeckers
are French-speaking, and a majori
ty are likely to support indepen
dence, according to polls. But an
overwhelming majority of English
speaking and immigrant Quebeck
ers are expected to vote to stay in
Canada.
Polling stations open at 10 a.m.
EST and close at 8 p.m. EST. The
outcome is expected to be known
within an hour or two unless it is a
virtual tie.
The federal government has

refused to say how it would
respond to a "Yes' vote. It could
accept Quebec's independence,
launch a legal challenge, or try to
force a Canada-wide referendum or
a second one in Quebec.
The separatists, if they won,
would not declare independence
immediately. They have offered to
negotiate for up to a year on a new
economic and political partnership
between Canada and an indepen
dent Quebec, but with the option of
unilaterally declaring indepen
dence at any point.
Some Quebeckers say they will
vote "yes" simply to end the
decades of wrangling over possible
constitutional reforms intended to
keep the province in Canada while
satisfying French nationalist
demands.
"How much longer will we

remain torn between a Yes and a
No?" asked Quebec poet Claude
Peloquin in a Montreal Gazette col
umn Sunday. "What are we wait
ing for?... It's time to be masters of
our destiny."
Federalist leaders expressed
confidence that they had regained
the momentum thanks to nation
wide unity rallies, including a huge
pro-Canada demonstration in
Montreal on Friday that drew
thousands of people from across
the country.
But Bouchard said Quebeckers
should not be swayed by the rallies.
"They want to make us feel
guilty by saying 'Why do you want
to do that? We love you,"' he said.
"But the reality is that in the past,
even though they love us, they
have never wanted to recognize us
as a people."


Reuter:
Young "Yes" supporters, spelling out the French word "oui," demonstrate for their cause yesterday.
