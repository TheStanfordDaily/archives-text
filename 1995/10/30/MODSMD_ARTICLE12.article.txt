# Emergency procedures at local airports found to be outdated

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Plans
designed to ensure air safety following a
disaster at three primary West Coast air
traffic control centers include wrong tele
phone numbers and a list of emergency
duties assigned to non-existent facilities,
the Alameda Newspaper Group reported
yesterday.
If Federal Aviation Administration per
sonnel were to rely on the plans during a
major radar or radio outage at the centers
in Oakland, Los Angeles or Seattle, they
would have a 57 percent chance of dialing
an incorrect telephone number, the news
papers reported, citing documents
obtained through the Freedom of Informa
tion Act.
Instead of connecting controllers to
other major control centers or air towers,
the erroneous numbers dial up businesses,

social service agencies and private homes.
Some numbers are disconnected, the news
papers reported.
Emergency plans also instruct con
trollers to use two internal telephone sys
tems that no longer exist, and, in some
cases, divert air traffic to facilities that are
closed, according to the documents.
The apparent gaps in the safety mecha
nism for three of the FAA's 21 primary air
traffic control centers surprised represen
tatives of commercial airlines and pilots
associations.
"No, no, no, we're not aware of it," said
Ward Baker of the Airline Pilots Associa
tion International, which represents
44,000 pilots. "Frankly, our members
don't like to be silting up there with 400
passengers on board and having wrong
numbers down below."

Ed Lewis, a San Francisco-based air
traffic systems manager for United Air
lines, said he believes the FAA is trying to
improve safety plans and has the best air
traffic control system in the world.
But, he added: "That surprises me that
the phone numbers are that much outdat
ed.... I think they've got a lot of work to
do."
Scattered throughout the plans are
instructions to use the federal telephone
system and defense switch network, two
internal communications systems that the
FAA has disabled.
Roger Wall, FAA program director for
air traffic system management, said the
agency is in the process of examining emer
gency plans nationwide. The review was
prompted by an Aug. 9 radar and radio
blackout at the Oakland control center.

Wall also said that while inaccurate tele
phone numbers aren't desirable, they do
not render a contingency plan useless.
That's because controllers can use "land
lines" — internal, automatic telephone
connections between some centers, he said.
In addition, some centers have cellular
telephones, he said.
"I think it's a situation that we'd like to
correct, hut I don't think it renders people
unable to use the contingency plan," Wall
said.
National Transportation Safety Board
officials said they would not comment on
the status of emergency plans.
But Rep. Bill Baker, R-Danville, said the
issue is being referred to the House Sub
committee on Aviation.
"I can't blame the current (FAA) man
agement because it's been going on for

years," said Baker, who recently expressed
his concern about the quality of'FAA emer
gency planning at the Oakland center in a
letter to agency administrator Donald Hin
son.
"We have to put pressure on them
before it results in a loss of life," Baker
said. "We are going to be watching them
carefully to make sure that they do
respond."
The wrong numbers listed in FAA
emergency plans include the following;
• The number listed for the Salinas Flight
Service Station instead ad Is the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in
Monterey, Calif.
• The number listed for the San Francisco
Coast Guard Rescue Center instead calls
the U.S. Department of Education Finan
cial Assistance Program in San Francisco.
