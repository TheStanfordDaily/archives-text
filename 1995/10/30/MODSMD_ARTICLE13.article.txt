Hoax was a royal pain
LONDON (AP) — Britons seldom hear
their queen's voice and when they do, she's
usually making a set speech.
Yesterday, though, Queen Elizabeth ll's
subjects were in for a surprise. A Canadian
disc jockey tricked the Queen into an on-air
phone call about Quebec's independence.
All agreed she came out of it very well.
Listeners to the 17-minute call, excerpts
of which were played on many British televi
sion and radio broadcasts, heard the 69-year
old monarch asking the disc jockey — who
she thought was Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien — to "Hangon a minute," and
switching between French and English.
"Her Majesty comes over as a cross
between a busy housewife and multilin
gual, clued-up businesswoman," comment
ed the tabloid Sunday Mirror.
Buckingham Palace officials say the call
got through to the queen — who is also the
monarch of Canada — because when they
checked with Chretien's office, a member
of his staff said he probably wanted to
speak to her.
It's still Wayne's world
NEW YORK (AP) — So he's been dead
16 years. But the Duke can still take the
likes of Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson.
John Wayne came out on top in the latest
Harris Poll survey that asked 1,005 Ameri
cans to name their favorite movie star.
Eastwood topped the list in 1993 and
1994 hut slipped to second place this year,
followed by Gibson, Denzel Washington,
Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks. Washing
ton was No. 1 with young adults and
blacks; Gibson was the top choice of
women.
