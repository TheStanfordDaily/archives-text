# Republican leaders divided on idea of Powell candidacy

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Retired Gen. Colin
Powell will throw the Republican Party into a
war for control if he seeks the GOP nomina
tion for president, Pat Buchanan and other
prominent conservatives warned yesterday.
In a sign the battle already has begun,
conservative William J. Bennett and several
moderate Republicans said they hope Powell
runs, and believe he can both gain support
from conservatives and widen the party's
appeal.
"Individual conservative Republicans like
this man, and they like him for good reason,"
said Bennett, a former education secretary
who has fought recently with fellow conser
vatives over Powell. Bennett spoke on CBS's
"Face the Nation."
But Buchanan, appearing on ABC's "This
Week with David Brinkley," warned of a full
scale revolt by Christian conservatives if Pow
ell wins the nomination and tilts the party
toward a pro-choice position on abortion.
"You'd have Christian Coalition folks
breaking loose, you'd have people walking
out of the convention, if Colin Powell tries to
impose his agenda," said Buchanan, who is
seeking the GOP nomination for the second
time.
If the party ends its pro-life, anti-gun con
trol and anti-affirmative action positions, "I
will not support that platform," Buchanan
insisted, but he stopped short of saying he
would bolt the GOP.
Powell, the retired Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman is expected to announce by
Thanksgiving whether he plans to join the
Republican race.
The GOP front-runner, Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, said conservatives would
unite behind him as a single alternative if
Powell seeks the GOP nomination.
"My view is that would be helpful to me,"

Dole said at a campaign stop in lowa yester
day.
Both moderates and Bennett said they
were eager for Powell to more fully explain
his positions on abortion, the OOP's "Con
tract With America," gun control and affir
mative action.
"Because this is worth having a debate,"
New York Oity Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
on the Brinkley program, adding "Colin
Powell has a historic opportunity to broaden
the base of the Republican Party in many,
many ways, and I'd like to see that opportu
nity taken."
Former President Bush allegedly was
touting Powell at a party in Houston last
week, although he insisted he would not pub
licly endorse anyone, Newsweek magazine
reported in editions appearing on news
stands today.
But David Keene, head of the American
Conservative Union, said Powell has already
made clear his wide divide from conserva
tives.
"He's described himself as a Rockefeller
Republican. He's said that if he gets into it,
part of his goal would be to revitalize this
portion of the party," Keene said on "Face
the Nation." "That is the next thing to a dec
laration of war on the conservative wing of
the party."
Keene pledged to fight Powell in the pri
maries if he runs, but said he won't support
a third-party conservative bid if Powell were
to win the GOP nomination.
A national poll released Saturday was
clearly on many Republicans' and
Democrats' minds.
The CBS News-New York Times poll
found that if Powell enters, he would cut
deeply into Dole's support and could become
the immediate front-runner.
