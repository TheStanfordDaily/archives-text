## Editorial Revise fee system 
### 
ASSU Senate should
act early and reform
general fee system

THE ASSU PROGRAM,
Community Service and
Publications Boards are ser
vice projects which collect and dis
tribute money gathered through
student fees. Few students know
what these groups are, yet they
provide a vital service to the Stan
ford community, supplying funds
and support for activities ranging
from cultural events to next
week's issue of The Thinker.
Unfortunately, student groups
usually request far more money
than each of these boards has
available. Tough choices must be
made — groups rarely get all of
what they ask for. In some cases,
there is little difference between a
drastically reduced allocation and
no allocation at all.
The flawed nature of the gener
al fee system which supports these
projects prevents students from
reaping the fullest possible bene
fits. Voted on each spring, the fees
allocated to these boards have
essentially remained unchanged
for years while the number of
groups and activities that each
must support has been growing.
Perhaps the most pressing
example is the Publications Board.
In addition to allocating funding
to a diverse group of student pub
lications, the Pub Board has the
added responsibility of maintain
ing office space and computer
equipment in the Storke Student
Publications Building, the only
working environment available to
many publications. Because the
Pub Board budget allocates only
$500 for equipment maintenance,
it has historically been forced to
draw on its dwindling reserves.
Under the current general fee
system, in the spring ASSU elec
tions. students vote on whether to

increase or decrease each board's
fee. Voters are given several choic
es: maintain the same level of
funding, or increase or decrease
the level by increments ranging
from five to 50 percent. The
results, however, are always the
same — no change.
The structure of the voting sys
tem makes the status quo result
inevitable for two reasons. First,
the winning adjustment is the one
that receives the most number of
votes. Second, the default choice
(that is, what people's votes count
toward if they choose to abstain) is
no adjustment.
The combination of these two
factors statistically ensures that
the funding level for each board
will never go up (or down), no mat
ter how many students want to
increase funding.
I'he only other way to increase
the allocations within the confines
of the current voting system is to
change a board's base fee, the
starting number which students
increment or decrement. In the
1994 general election, voters were
asked to approve a 200 percent
increase of the Pub Board general
fee. However, the large size of the
jump, coupled with the two-thirds
super-majority required for this
change, doomed the proposal from
the start.
The current general-fee voting
system needs to be reformed so that
board funding better reflects stu
dent interests. If there is no statis
tical wav for voters to change these
fees, then they really aren't voting.
This problem can't be solved
overnight. The ASSU Senate and
Council of Presidents need to look
into this issue now, while it's
fresh. All too often, problems like
these are brought up shortly
before elections and forgotten
soon after they're over, only for
the cycle to repeat again the next
year. By acting now and showing
the foresight appropriate to good
student government, the senate
could make a change which would
greatly benefit scores of student
groups and publications.
