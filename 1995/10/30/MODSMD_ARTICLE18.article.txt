McCullough's roommate excuses himself

I would like to respond to scurrilous
allegations that 1 am responsible for
Daily columnist Brendan McCul
lough's warped state of being. Yes, I am
his roommate, the one so slanderously
mentioned in a recent Daily column. I
went through a deep depression, several
therapists and bushels of Prozac before
I was finally able to get over my denial
of this unfortunate rooming situation.
It is amazing how fast living with some
one like Brendan can make one strong
ly desire to slash one's own wrists with
an angry house cat. Anyhoo, I know
that I am innocent of his accusations —
he was pretty screwed up before I got
here.

The real reason Brendan is inferior to
myself is not too complicated, really. If I
have learned anything from sleazy talk
shows, it is that his parents are at fault.
His unhappy childhood has caused
him to (Warning! Unsolicited psycho
analysis!) take out his aggressions with
his car. It's a sporty little black Honda,
and he decided to get all the options on
it, although I think that he spends so
much time on the sidewalk that maybe
he shoidd install airbags on the outside
of his car.
The good thing about his fast little
car is that it helps him with the women
folk. (Of course, he doesn't have my nat
ural babe-magnet abilities.) Just look at

that picture of him above his column!
The guy doesn't even have a lower body!
Brendan has managed to snag at least
one woman and I had the extreme plea
sure of meeting her a few weekends ago.
I was coming back to ♦he room and I saw
a girl actually holding hands with Bren
dan! She had beautiful blond hair that
looked like amber. This had to be
Rosanne, his girlfriend. Knowing that
there is nothing like a good first impres
sion, I purposefully strode up to her,
kissed her hand and said, "I'm better
than Brendan. Dump him." "You must
be Erin," she replied. Then she maced
me. Soon after my vision cleared, I tear
fully waved good bye (It was pepper

spray, all right?) as they drove off for a
romantic evening.
Later that evening, I ate popcorn and
watched as they furiously oscularized,
exchanging more fluids than horny water
fountains. They were acting pretty
inconsiderately if you ask me, throwing
the occasional heavy object at me and
yelling things like, "Why won't you go
away?" They are just too darn precious!
So that is what is like to live with
Brendan. Pity may be addressed to Erin
Clowes, Paloma 318. Hate mail and let
ter bombs may be addressed to Brendan
McCullough, Paloma 318.
