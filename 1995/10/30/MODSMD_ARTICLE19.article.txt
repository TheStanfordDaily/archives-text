# A 						new definition of afirmative action
## 
### 
I ve got a suggestion for those stu
dents who have voiced their strong sup
port for affirmative action: White Stan
ford students — and for that matter,
those white UC students — who strong
ly support affirmative action in the
admissions office should simply drop out
of school. They should also write a letter
to the admissions office asking that their
spot be fillet! by a minority student. This
is the most effective way to guarantee
that minority students are given a "fair"
representation at their respective
schools.
I also urge President Casper and any
other white faculty and staff members
who support affirmative action to quit
their jobs and see that they are replaced
by qualified minority applicants. Of
course, I don't actually expect anyone to
drop out or quit their job in favor of
affirmative action.
The purpose of my letter is to illus
trate that most people who support affir

mative action are willing to make small
sacrifices (and yes, a hunger strike is a
minimal sacrifice compared to dropping
out of school or quitting one's job), but
when asked to make a significantly large
sacrifice for their cause, they don't seem
to support it anymore, essentially say
ing, "It's okay to discriminate against
my race as a whole as long as you don't
discriminate against me."
