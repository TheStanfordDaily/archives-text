# Few women among ASSU ranks
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Though the gender balance of Stanford's
student population is more or less even, you
wouldn't know it from looking at the composi
tion of the ASSU Senate.
Despite the fact that the senate chair, grad
uate student Alane Murdock, is a woman, only
four of the 20 undergraduate senators and five

of the 16 graduate senators (including Mur
dock) are women. The four-person Council ol
Presidents has only one woman.
The low numbers are not a new problem:
The average number of female undergraduate
senators over the last 10 years is six per year,
while the number of graduate women is often
even smaller.
No one has a definitive explanation for this
trend, but the general consensus amongsena

tors and Stanford professors is that women
and men have different styles of interacting,
and that the senate is dominated by formal,
male-oriented traditions which dissuade
women from participating. Rather than wast
ing time on discussions of minute details,
women prefer to work in organizations where
they can see the immediate product of their
efforts.
Disillusioned, some female sen
ators say they often have to work
harder to make their voices heard
— and to ensure that women's
issues are not overlooked.
Aware of this problem, the sen
ate is working to make women
more comfortable, senators said.
The lack of role models, however,
may be creating a self-perpetuating
cycle that is difficult to break.
Different styles
Although most people believe
that men and women at Stanford
are treated equally, the female sen
ators and professors noted that, by
nature, women have a different
way of getting things done.
Senior Nicole Vazquez, the
only woman on the Council of
Presidents, said she feels intimi-

dated to speak up in certain situa
tions. "When I am the only
woman, it is hard, and the issue of
gender is there," she said. "My
way of doing things is different,
and I've been challenged to be
more aggressive."
"People do categorize certain
positions as a 'man's thing' or a
'woman's thing,' " siiid Psychology
Prof. Felicia Pratto. "Many soci
eties consider men the official and
legal leaders."
"I think women may want to
serve in organizations that matter

more to them. Women don't partic
ularly value controlling other peo
ple," Pratto said.
Sophomore Maria Bleavins,
ASSU secretary, said she has
noticed that women often take a
back seat. "Participation by female

senators during meetings appears
to be significantly lower than that
of their male counterparts. I really
don't know why this is, especially
considering the fact that a woman
is chair," said Bleavins.
Political Science Prof. Susan
Okin said that around campus, the
women she sees are articulate and
strong minded. "Perhaps women
don't see student government as
worth their energy," she said.
Undergraduate senator Christy
Ramon, a sophomore, said that she
doubted women at Stanford worry
about being at a disadvantage
because of gender when they run
for office.
"It starts more with who's
attracted to the senate in the first
place," Ramon said. "Maybe
women are interested, but they
don't want to run because they
would rather focus on projects
where you can see the product of
your work faster, and you feel like
you are doing something positive."
Murdock, the senate chair, said
that although she does feel the sen
ate respects her, the gender bal
ance is bothersome.
Echoing Pratto's views, some of
the female senators said they feel
the character of the senate is dom
inated by a "male way of doing
business."
"I often feel intimidated in the
meetings," said undergraduate
senator Angela Parker, a sopho
more. "The controlling attitude
that a lot of the men have deters
me from speaking up."

correct form of parliamentary pro
cedure and the terminology of bills
and amendments. The senate at
Stanford is more formal than those
at other schools, according to Mur
dock, and often this makes the pro
cess of getting things done more
bureaucratic.
"A lot of women take leadership
positions in other student organi
zations because then l they see a
live output. In a tutoring program,
you can see the effect you make.
The senate wavers a lot and tends
to get caught up in details,"
Vazquez said.
COP member Rich Stolz, a
senior, said he understands Park
er's frustration. "I am not sur
prised that women feel like people
don't respect them. There aren't
that many women in the senate,
and if you tabulate how many
times women speak, it would cer
tainly be a lot fewer than the times
men do," Stolz said.
'Someone isn't getting heard'
"I don't know what would
change in the senate if the male to
female balance were even, but it is
true that things would work differ
ently," Stolz said. "Different issues
would get different amounts of
attention."
The small number of women
creates an added exigency to make
their voices heard, the female sena
tors said.
"I think sometimes women
question the validity of their opin
ions, and don't speak up as much in
an intimidating group," Vazquez

said, in the senate, we as women
are forced to speak more loudly just
to be heard equally to men. 1 feel a
lot of pressure to speak up more
than I normally would because our
numbers are so few."
The current style of the male
dominated senate has disenchant
ed Parker, who said she feels so
frustrated with the unproductive
ness of the organization that she
does not want to run next year.
"I don't feel that if I said some
thing in this setting, they would
take me seriously enough," said
Parker, referring to some outspo
ken male senators. She clarified,
however, that it is the style of the
senate which bothers her, not the
people themselves.
"It's not something that I can

pin down as male; it is just that
the people who work best within
this system are male," Parker
said. "Women just interact differ
ently."
This is evident in the distribu
tion of women among senate posi
tions, Stolz said. Interestingly, all
of the internally selected posi
tions, such as the chairs of com
mittees, are dominated by men.
There are no women on the Bank
ing and Finances Committee or on
the Administration and Rules
Committee. There are several
women, however, on he Student
Affairs Committee and on the
Committee on Academics
Research Evaluation — commit
tees which have a direct effect on
students.
"I think the senate culture is
affected by the fact that men domi
nate in these areas," Stolz said. "It
is important to represent as many
people as we can. We are lucky to
have strong women, but when you
see how few there are, you wonder
whose voices aren't being repre
sented."

Stolz's statements reflect Park
er's concern. "The senate is not
representative of the student body,
and the lack of women negatively
affects the senate," Parker said. "I
don't want to say that the men
can't represent the women on aim
pus, but I do think it indicates
someone isn't getting heard."
Pragmatic changes
Parker's concern has led to the
formation of a Women's Caucus to
give the female senators support
and address women's issues. The
women hope that the support sys
tem they are creating will make the
senate environment less intimidat
ing.
"Just by the formation of the
caucus, we will I>e addressing the
problem of female membership.
We'll Im> taking a more visible role,"
said sophomore Kimberly Bayer,
an undergraduate senator.
The caucus may also help
address the cyclical lack of role
models for women interested in
becoming a part of the senate.
"There just aren't that many
role models. It's been a man's game
for so long," said graduate senator
Jessica Koran, adding that the
"budding politicians" in the senate
tend to be male.
Bayer said that seeing Vazquez
as a senator last year encouraged
her. "Nicole was very visible in the
dorm, in her community involve
ment and academically; she was
bringing up issues and reaching
out to a lot of people," Bayer said.
Though the caucus is not a par
tisan organization, political parties
in the senate also play a role.

Parker said she noticed that her
party, the People's Platform, sup
ported her during the campaign
last spring. "I think the party
helped us a lot. It really helps us
bond and get to know a lot of peo
ple," she said.
Ok in confirmed that political
parties often assist female candi
dates. "In the Scandinavian coun
tries in Europe, they have quotas
requiring that every party have a
certain number of women as can
didates," Okin said, adding that
this results in a government that
is almost 40 percent women.
"Maybe the Stanford parties
should make a pledge to have a
certain number of women to run
on slates — this would definitely
affect the rate of female participa
tion," Okin said.
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen,
a sophomore, said that the sen
ate's Executive Committee has
discussed the need to improve
attention to women's issues and
attract more women to run.
As more women get involved in
the senate, Vazquez said she
hopes the tendency toward visible
results and productivity will

change the character of the orga
nization.
Murdock agreed, but stressed
that one can't be idealistic. "I
think it is important for our own
success not to think of ourselves
as victims, but we need to recog
nize the difference between our
own styles versus the group we
are part of," Murdock said.
