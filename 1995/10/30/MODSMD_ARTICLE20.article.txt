# Students should be willing to deal with grades they deserve

Education and Psychology Prof. John
Krumboltz wrote recently that competi
tive grading creates a conflict of interest
for teachers and predictable negative
responses from "humiliated" students,
many of whom feel like "losers" because
they receive B's and not A's.
A culture of personal insecurity and
artificial praise, not competitive grading,

is the problem of our society. Naturally,
people have different talents and abili
ties and few people excel relative to their
peers in any one course. As long as one
is working to his potential, there is no
reason to be ashamed of or insecure
about receiving a B. One must use an
absolute, not relative, scale for self-eval
uation, and we all must be more con
cerned about our peers as diverse
human beings than as walking GPA's.
Using grade inflation, the undeserved
distribution of high grades, to combat
negative feelings helps no one. If every
one receives a trophy, what significance
does it have?
We must all be secure and realistic
enough to accept being average (which,
of course, can be defined in a narrow or
broad sense depending on the situation)
in some things, so that the praise we
receive for doing something else really
well is truly meaningful.
Competitive grading does serve a pur
pose and any form of evaluation will not
eliminate the truth that Prof. Krum
boltz admits: "[Tlhere will always be
individual differences in ability and
knowledge." The inability to confront

and deal with this reality, not the com
petitive grading system which is a reflec
tion of it, is the real problem.
