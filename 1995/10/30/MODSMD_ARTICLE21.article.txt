### 
I am writing to clarify your recent
editorial on campus lighting. In my dis
cussion with The Daily, I expressed con
cern for people's personal safety in the
evening and encouraged The Daily to
highlight a number of standard safety
tips.
I indicated that the University's map
of suggested travel routes map was a
good resource. Also, I have encouraged
people, most recently at last Tuesday's
ASSU Senate meeting, to forward con
cerns about campus lighting to the Uni
versity Planning Office. This is best
done by sending e-mail to pubworks
