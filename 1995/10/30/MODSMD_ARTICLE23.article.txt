## Confession of a sinner 
### 
IN TODAY'S COLUMN, I would like
to apologize to everyone whom I have
so savagely offended in my past
pieces. I would just like to express my
deep regret to all the students, faculty,
staff, Sinurf supporters, animals and
conservative monkeys who are so blind in
their devotion to the Republican party
that in trying to kiss the almighty ele
phant's ass, they accidentally lodged
their own heads so far up the colon that
they can see nothing but s-t. To all of you
whom I have offended, I am truly sorry.
In my defense, I think it is necessary
to explain just how hard it is to be a
columnist. In actuality, it isn't all fun and
games. No one seems to understand how
much time and discipline these columns
take to crank out.
For example, on some late nights, I am
faced with a dilemma: There is a beauti
ful girl lying on my bed and I have to
write another damn article for the next
day. Obviously, I go to bed. Hut that
means I have to cut all my classes the
next day so I can write a page worth of
insights into my distorted perspective of
the world so other people can whine and
make fun of them.
This brings me to those wonderful let
ters to the editor.
Yes, anyone with an e-mail address and
a pulse is welcome to make any accusat ion
against my column and moral values in

general. This is how I found myself read
ing a psychological profile on yours truly,
based on ancient Greek mythology and a
light-hearted column of mine which des
perately tried to make someone laugh. It
informed me, and everyone else who hap
pened to get a hold of The Daily that day
(before I had a chance to steal and burn
every remaining copy), that I have a
rapist's mentality. Have some compas
sion, for Christ's sake. It is hard enough
for me to get a date as it is, and that's
without the label of "Glorifier of Rape."
Of course, I must mention that not
every letter to the editor is bad. There are
still those wonderful individuals with
warmth and laughter in their hearts -
and emptiness in their pocketbooks. I
love you, all of you.
And then there is The Stanford Review,
which feels a need to single me out. Ah,
yes, The Review, a newspaper so conserva
tive that it probably blames global warm
ing on the AIDS quilt and so desperate for
attention that it can think of nothing bet
ter than to resurrect the old Stanford Indi
an mascot to piss people off. No, actually
that is untrue. I am sure the entire Stan
ford student body has reclaimed its sense
of school spirit at the mere sight of the old
mascot, which was dead before most of us
were born.
Those who condemn me claim that my
columns have no point to them at all. I

find this to be untrue. After all, it is quite
clear that this column is aimed to do
nothing but mend the differences that
have developed between myself and those
senseless bastards who have no sense of
humor — nothing more, nothing less.
However, The Review did say I was the
best of The Daily's columnists, for some
reason or another, but 1 forget why exact
ly. I just thought I would mention that.
By the way, give your proofreader
another shot of cheap tequila for mis
spelling my name.
Yet, it could be worse. I could have the
entire Greek system going after my balls
— castration, that is — like Friday's
columnist, whom I hope to replace with
my roommate.
And, amazingly, my fragile male ego
has and will survive the psychological
floggings The Review and others put me
through because I will always know that
my parents loved me. Besides, the Hitler
Youth over at The Review are not very
good at journalism.

Mr. McCullough is disappointed he did
not have the opportunity to wreak revenge
on Beavis and Butthead, The Daily's
Thursday columnists. He promises a
rematch in upcoming issues.
