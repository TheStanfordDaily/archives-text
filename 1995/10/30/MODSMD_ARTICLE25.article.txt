# AASA holds talk on immigrants in America

### Athima Chansanchai 
The Asian American Students' Association
(AASA) gave its first-ever conference, titled
"Listen to the Silence," at the Cubberley
School of Education Saturday.
Hut silence was the last thing that echoed
through the hallways.
Held all day, the conference featured three
sessions of workshops tackling issues such as
immigration, hate violence, affirmative action
and the arts.
About 70 students from around the Bay
Area came to the conference to connect with
other people who want to make an impact on
these issues.
Although only a handful of Stanford stu
dents attended, the organizers weren't fazed.
A core of about five people from the sum
mer and 15 this quarter who poured their
efforts into coordinating the conference felt
the fruits of their labor were justified.
AASA Chair Gavin Funabiki said he felt
that overall, the conference was a success.
The organizers gathered an impressive
array of speakers — among them authors,
playwrights, journalists and lawyers to ses
sions focusing on the three themes of interac
tion, action and expression.
Both speakers and students embraced the
concept that students must take that step
beyond caring and start doing.
Chita Divakauni, an acclaimed Indian writ
er and professor at Foothill College, gave the
keynote speech which emphasized "the impor
tance of Asian Americans becoming visible in
America."
Divakauni told students, "I want you to go

away from this conference saying, 'I can do
something in the Asian-American and the
larger community.' "
She suggested students become informed,
educate others about issues that are impor
tant to them, write to elected officials and give
speeches and presentations.
Carolyn Lee, a junior at UC-Berkeley,
strongly encouraged other students to "go
back to their communities and campuses and
educate, empower and activate."
"Everybody's personal and social responsi
bility is standing up for what you believe in,"
added Christine Tom, a senior at Mills College.
Connections seemed to be sprouting all
over the conference, as bridges between stu
dents and issues extended to bridging gaps
between each other.
"We need to tap into students who are
interested in issues and don't know where to
put that energy. Grassroots organizing and
policy change work hand in hand," said
Michelle Bautista, a junior at UC-Berkeley.
Bautista added, "The core question is how
we're going to construct our society. What is
the problem? Do we want to correct it? And
how do we do it?"
One of the most popular workshops dealt
with current federal immigration policy.
Richard Konda, the executive director of
the Asian Law Alliance and Vicki Shu, from
the Organization of Chinese Americans, gave
students a brief overview of discrimination
against Asians and Asian Americans, leading
to the current wave of legislation that may
effectively enact Proposition 187 on a federal
scale.
The presenters discussed the House of Rep

resentatives bill H.R. 2202 which would elimi
nate the cornerstone of I S. immigration poli
cy, family reunification.
They also mentioned the welfare reform bill
which contains provisions that they say would
cause undue hardship to immigrants.
Both Shu and Konda encouraged students
to write President Clinton and encourage him
to veto the bill if it comes out of conference
committee with these provisions intact.
When some students expressed concern
about speaking up in the face of a major tide of
resentment, the presenters reiterated the
need for students to be persistent, express
their viewpoints and realize that they can
make an impact.
The last session of workshops focused on
political expression through the arts. Five
members of the Wong family, a family of
Chinese Americans who have expressed
their activism through poetry, visual arts,
education and journalism, spoke about their
work.
Brad Wong, a journalist and the nephew of
poet Nellie Wong, put his family philosophy
like this: "If something bugs you, you have to
let people know. You have to put it out in a
broader forum."
His sister Felicia, a Stanford alum, said her
activism is something "far beyond guilt."
"It is very important to get involved with
Asian-American issues," she said.
Nellie Wong agreed. "If we don't deal with
the issues, we'll get continually stepped on,"
she said. "We're told in many ways we're not
supposed to make waves, take risks. When we
work with others we could move mountains.
We have to take these risks."
