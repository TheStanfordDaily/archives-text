# Rice, Zelikow discuss new book at Hoover
## 
### Jimmy Boegle 
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Harvard Associate Professor
Philip Zelikow explained what
Rice called "the highly interac
tive, energetic, engaged process"
of German reunification at a
seminar in Stauffer Auditorium
Friday.
The hour-long seminar, which
focused on their new book, "Ger
many United and Europe Trans
formed: A Study in Statecraft,"
attracted numerous students,
faculty members and Hoover fel
lows, including former Secretary
of State and current Hoover Dis
tinguished Fellow George
Shultz.
As members of the National
Security Council staff during the
Bush administration, Rice and
Zelikow were highly involved in
the reunification process.
In addition to describing the
book as a history of the reunifica
tion process, Zelikow said the
text gives an example of "how
international policy is actually
made and implemented."
"The book does emphasize
that statecraft matters — indi
vidual decisions matter," he said.
Rice discussed how former
President Reagan began the
events leading toward German
reunification and the fall of the
Soviet Union when he took what
the book calls "an all-or-nothing
negotiating stance" with the
U.S.S.R. during his presidency.
This stance, she said, along with
a decline in Soviet resources,
forced the Soviet Union to
change its policy.
"They took the option of
redefining national security
interests more in line with the
direction the world was facing,"
she said at the seminar.
This decision, along with a
series of Soviet misjudgments,
eventually led to the decline in
their empire that made reunifica
tion possible. The Bush adminis
tration continued the "all-or
nothing" stance in reunification
negotiations, ultimately leading
to a westernized Germany with
absolutely no Soviet interven
tion.
"Germany unified in a way

symmetric with Western inter
ests," Rice said. She gave the
examples of how Germany uni
fied as a NATO member "com
pletely and fully," and how "Ger
many emerged completely and
totally sovereign."
The German unification creat
ed a new Europe as well, she said.
"Europe emerged a veiy different
Europe, where Western institu
tions are supreme."
Zelikow said that when a State
Department official approached
him with the idea of writing the
book, he agreed to only if he was
given unlimited access to all the
relevant classified documents in
the possession of the United
States government. His request
was granted.
Rice decided while she was at
the Sept. 12, 1990 pact-signing
ceremony that she wanted to
write about the process. She
noticed then that Mikhail Gor
bachev had a very "blank" look
on his face throughout the sign
ing, and she pondered his situa
tion.
"He was essentially signing
away Soviet power in Europe,"
she said, pointing out that the
Soviet Union had suddenly lost
its most crucial European ally.
"The entire process described in
the book took less than a year,"
she said.
The book examines the reuni
fication process from all sides,
not just the United States' view,
the authors emphasized.
"It would be impossible to
write about this process from the
point of view of only one capital,"
said Rice.
This became possible when, in
addition to Zelikow's unlimited
access to United States docu
ments, they were able to have
access to many Soviet and East
German documents during the
chaos following the collapse of
the two countries.
"When the Soviet Union col
lapsed, nobody was really sure
what the status of documents
from a non-country would be,"
Rice said. Therefore, they had
access to many documents and
accounts that they otherwise
would have never had a chance to
acquire.
