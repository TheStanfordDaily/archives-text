# Stanford downs OSU 24-3 to break home-field jinx
## Cardinal defense allows fewest points since 1992 Blockbuster Bowl

Stanford 24

Stanford's victory over Oregon State
last Saturday was sort of like an old
Toyota commercial — who could ask for
anything more?
The Cardinal (5-2-1 overall, 3-2
Pacific 10 Conference) rejuvenated its
bowl-game hopes with a convincing, if
not unexpected 24-3 win over the
Beavers (1-7, 0-5). No fourth-quarter
heroics were necessary to determine the
outcome of this one — the first time
that's happened this season. Stanford
jumped ahead of the conference door
mat early on to take its first home win of
1995.

"This was a very important ball game
for us," said head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "Any time you get down into the
latter stretch of the season, if you have
aspirations of being a bowl team, of
being a good team, you have to win the
last few games that you play. This was a
very big game for us."
The conference race now stands as
follows: At 4-0-1, barring a complete
breakdown, USC and Washington are
good bets for the Rose Bowl and Cot
ton / Holiday Bowl. The Cardinal is in a
third-place tie with UCLA and Oregon,
fighting for the Pac-10's two remaining
guaranteed bowl berths, the Sun Bowl
and Jeep Eagle Aloha Bowl.
Should Stanford finish the year in
such a three-way tie, the Cardinal would
be the odd team out. To reach the post
season, Stanford must outpace either
the Bruins or the Ducks in the next
three weeks. Of the three squads, UCLA
faces the most difficult challenge, with a
home game against the Huskies sand
wiched between trips to Arizona State

and USC. The Cardinal, meanwhile,
must take at least two of its three final
contests — at USC, at Washington
State and home against California — by
performing like it did last Saturday.
Against Oregon State, the Stanford
defense — strung up for dead after
painful performances in the previous
two outings — showed life after all,
clamping down on the Beavers' option
attack and putting together its best
game of the year.
"We went with the basic option prin
ciples," Willingham said. "We set out to
stop the fullback dive, and for most of
the game, [the dive] was really not effec
tive. We played our responsibilities
along the line of scrimmage to keep the
quarterback in check."
Such a scheme held OSU, the Pac
10's top rushing attack, to 219 yards on
the ground, its season average, and gave
the Cardinal defense a much-needed
boost.

Sophomore running back Anthony Bookman takes off for a chunk of his 69 yards last
Saturday against Oregon State.
"Lately, the big thing has been
that we can't stop the run," said
sophomore linebacker Jon Hask
ins. "I don't know what the stats
are, but that was the best rushing
team in the league out there, and
we shut it down."
The Beavers' three points were
the fewest allowed by a Stanford
team since the 1992 season finale,
a 24-3 win over Penn State in the
Blockbuster Bowl, 30 games ago.
In the period between the two per
formances, every Stanford oppo
nent has managed at least 20
points against the Cardinal.
The team was particularly
pleased with its play in the second
half. A problem area in recent
weeks, the Stanford defense seems
to fall apart in the final 30 min
utes. Against the Beavers, howev
er, the Cardinal held Oregon State
scoreless after the break. Beaver
drives met with no success.
"This is a great confidence
builder for us," said junior free
safety Josh Madsen. "We stayed in
there and formed a strong bond in
the second half."
Haskins, who received signifi
cant playing time due to the
unique nature of the Beaver
offense, recorded three tackles-for
losses and assisted on yet another.
Madsen, with a team-high 12 tack
les, led a secondary that was key to
the defense's overall performance.
Strong safety Eliel Swinton con
tributed 10 tackles and defensive
back Corey Hill, who excels against
the option, added eight.
Because OSU's attack is so dif
ferent from any other that Stan
ford will see, it's still unclear as to
how much the Cardinal can take
from Saturday's victory. But one
thing is certain — no matter what
the case may be, the defense is
feeling better about itself.
"We needed this," Haskins
said. "If we had lost, if we had
struggled, it would've hurt us psy
chologically."
Stanford got out of the gates
quickly when sophomore Damon
Dunn took the opening kickoflf 47

yards to the OSU 41. After nine
and five-yard gains by sophomore
running back Anthony Bookman,
quarterback Mark Butterfield hit
Mike Mitchell with a swing pass
along the right sideline for 22
yards, setting up a five-yard touch
down plunge by fullback Adam
Salina. The scoring drive took only
two minutes, 36 seconds.
On the second play of the sec
ond quarter from the Beaver 37,
Bookman took the hand-off
around left tackle, broke free of
the Oregon State defensive front
and raced into the end zone for a
touchdown to give the Cardinal a
14-0 lead. Bookman would leave
the game in the second half with
bruised ribs, but not before gain
ing 69 yards on 11 carries.
"They have a ton of speed on
their offense," said OSU lineback
er Kane Rogers, who led the
Beavers with 14 tackles. "They did
exactly what we thought they were
going to do offensively. We just
couldn't stop it. [Stanford | is much
more physical and tougher than it
has been the last couple of years."
OSU head coach Jerry Petti
bone definitely noticed Stanford's
offensive attack. "The thing that
really impressed me about Stan
ford this year was their ability to
run the football," he said. "They
bring an awful lot to the table."
Oregon State got its lone score
on the next possession when the
Cardinal's containment broke
down and quarterback Tim
Alexander was able to scamper
around left end for 36 yards to the
Stanford 19. The Beavers got
lucky when an offsides penalty
negated a fumbled hand-off that
was recovered by Cardinal nose
tackle David Carder and allowed
them to kick a 29-yard field goal.
OSU started the first drive of
the second half on its own 27 and,
for a while, it appeared as if the
Stanford defense might be up to its
old tricks, as the Beavers marched
down the field to the Stanford 31.
But a bad pitch by Alexander didn't
make it into the hands of his run
ning back and Swinton picked up
the gift at the 40.
Stanford couldn't capitalize on
the turnover, punting on fourth
and-11. However, DeShawn

Williams fumbled the kick at the
Beaver 15, where reserve Cardinal
running back Jeff Byrd fell on the
ball. Four plays later, Mitchell,
who rushed for 56 yards on the
day, took the ball in from the 3.
The Stanford offense didn't do
much in the second half. On the
other hand, it didn't have to. OSU
couldn't put together an extended
drive after the third Stanford score,
even after junior Don Shanklin
replaced Alexander at the Ik-aver
helm. The Cardinal also lucked out
when Damon Dunn fumbled two
punts but managed to recover both
of the mishaps.
"Maybe there really is a curse

over OSU," said halfback Mark
Ohlford of the miserable predica
ment of his last-place Beavers.
"It's not like we were that uneven
ly matched out there. I don't know
what it is."
The Cardinal doesn't know
what it is either, but doesn't care.
The squad is just thankful for the
win and ready to move on to the
next challenge.
"This is the first game we've
won comfortably," Mitchell said.
"We got ourselves right back into
the thick of things in the bowl
hunt. We've still got a long way to
go, but this is the first step in the
right direction."
