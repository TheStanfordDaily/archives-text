# Stanford downs OSU 24-3 to break home-field jinx
## Cardinal defense allows fewest points since 1992 Blockbuster Bowl

Stanford 24

Stanford's victory over Oregon State
last Saturday was sort of like an old
Toyota commercial — who could ask for
anything more?
The Cardinal (5-2-1 overall, 3-2
Pacific 10 Conference) rejuvenated its
bowl-game hopes with a convincing, if
not unexpected 24-3 win over the
Beavers (1-7, 0-5). No fourth-quarter
heroics were necessary to determine the
outcome of this one — the first time
that's happened this season. Stanford
jumped ahead of the conference door
mat early on to take its first home win of
1995.

"This was a very important ball game
for us," said head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "Any time you get down into the
latter stretch of the season, if you have
aspirations of being a bowl team, of
being a good team, you have to win the
last few games that you play. This was a
very big game for us."
The conference race now stands as
follows: At 4-0-1, barring a complete
breakdown, USC and Washington are
good bets for the Rose Bowl and Cot
ton / Holiday Bowl. The Cardinal is in a
third-place tie with UCLA and Oregon,
fighting for the Pac-10's two remaining
guaranteed bowl berths, the Sun Bowl
and Jeep Eagle Aloha Bowl.
Should Stanford finish the year in
such a three-way tie, the Cardinal would
be the odd team out. To reach the post
season, Stanford must outpace either
the Bruins or the Ducks in the next
three weeks. Of the three squads, UCLA
faces the most difficult challenge, with a
home game against the Huskies sand
wiched between trips to Arizona State

and USC. The Cardinal, meanwhile,
must take at least two of its three final
contests — at USC, at Washington
State and home against California — by
performing like it did last Saturday.
Against Oregon State, the Stanford
defense — strung up for dead after
painful performances in the previous
two outings — showed life after all,
clamping down on the Beavers' option
attack and putting together its best
game of the year.
"We went with the basic option prin
ciples," Willingham said. "We set out to
stop the fullback dive, and for most of
the game, [the dive] was really not effec
tive. We played our responsibilities
along the line of scrimmage to keep the
quarterback in check."
Such a scheme held OSU, the Pac
10's top rushing attack, to 219 yards on
the ground, its season average, and gave
the Cardinal defense a much-needed
boost.
