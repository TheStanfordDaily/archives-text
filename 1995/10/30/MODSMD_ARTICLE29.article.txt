# Cardinal offense jumps out of gates, Carey finally gets his chance
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The Stanford football team did what
it had to do last Saturday and not much
else. An abysmal 30,665 witnessed a
game that was as exciting as watching
the Foster Field turf turn brown
between the hashes.
In the process, Stanford ended two
of the stranger quirks in college foot
ball this year. The Cardinal became the
106 th Division I-A team to win a home
game (Stanford still has not lost on the
road) and won after scoring first for the
only time in three such opportunities,
all in the past three games (Stanford
hasn't been defeated when the oppo

nent has scored first).
The Cardinal took care of business
early, jumping to a big lead and holding
an inept Beaver offense in check the
whole way. Stanford did little to con
vince anybody to vault the Cardinal
back into the rankings, but the Beavers
did little to dissuade the notion that
they belong in the Big Sky Conference,
not the Pacific 10.
Although the last 25 minutes fea
tured no scoring, the game's highlight
came in the fourth quarter when back
up quarterback Tim Carey made his
long-awaited debut. The redshirt
sophomore who battled with Mark
Butterfield for the starting job last
spring completed three of four passes

for just 12 yards but demonstrated a
lively arm.
After entering the Stanford pro
gram in 1993 amid much fanfare,
Carey was happy to step onto the field
in a game situation for the first time
with the Cardinal.
"I thought we'd blow out a couple of
teams and I'd get an opportunity (to
play,)" Carey said. "But we've played
some good teams and they've kept it
close, so I've just had to wait.
"I definitely thought I'd get in this
one."
Junior running back Mike Mitchell
said that Carey could not hide his gid-
diness about the chance to play.
"You could see the excitement in
his eyes," he said. "We thought
we were going to score."
While the Stanford offense
didn't provide fireworks, the
Beaver offense disintegrated into
ashes. Early on, Oregon State
varied from its double-slot forma
tion and received help from three
offsides penalties on the opening
drive. But the Beavers couldn't
take advantage and ended up with
seven possessions of 15 yards or
less.
"The effort's always there,"
said OSU senior halfback Mark
Olford. "The whole line pretty
much dominated the line of
scrimmage. We had a lot of big
runs inside with the fullback, but
we just couldn't get the big plays
outside."
While junior fullback Darron
Kirkman rushed for 72 yards on
nine carries, Stanford held quick
quarterback Tim Alexander to 44
yards on 16 tries, 36 of them on
one attempt. Alexander was
benched in favor of Don Shanklin
late in the third quarter.
The Beavers also shot them
selves in the foot with three lost
fumbles. Stanford contributed to
the sloppiness as well, with a sea
son-high 12 penalties and two
fumbled punts by sophomore
Damon Dunn. Oregon State never
capitalized on the penalties, and
Dunn recovered both fumbles,
including one that didn't matter
due to fair-catch interference.
While Oregon State failed to
move the ball consistently, head
coach Jerry Pettibone refused to
blame the option. Instead, he
relied on his favorite crutch — the
kicking game.

"I felt like we had a lot of
offense there," Pettibone said.
"The kicking game's been our
Achilles heel all year 1 think if we
hadn't had mistakes in the kick
ing game, we would have been
right in there."
Pettibone cited Stanford's
opening kickoff return to the
Beaver 41 and Marc Williams'
fumbled punt at the Beaver 15 in
the second half. Both miscues
gave Stanford excellent field posi
tion and led to Cardinal scores.
Special-teams monster Jeff
Byrd recovered the Williams fum
ble and also carried the ball for
the first time with the Cardinal.
Byrd has registered 12 tackles on
special teams alone.
"Any time I have a chance to
make a turnover and help my
team score, I'm going to be
happy," Byrd said.
Pettibone's offense could have
used such help. After Stanford
held his team to a season-low
three points, Pettibone said the
Cardinal compares favorably with
other teams in the Pac-10 the
Beavers have faced.
"I think Stanford and [No. 15J
Washington are very comparable
football teams," Pettibone said.
"The thing that's really impres
sive about Stanford is their ability
to run the football. Tyrone Will
ingham's done an excellent job
with this program."
On the other hand, Pettibone's
work with his program comes
under more ("ire with each Beaver
loss While Beaver players say
they just love to play, the frustra
tion comes across loud and clear.
"Right now we're in a bad situ
ation," Olford said. "Nothing's
going right. There isn't any way
to explain it. Me and a lot of the
other seniors came in to turn this
thing around, and we're still at
the same point as when we came
in here."

work with his program comes
under more ("ire with each Beaver
loss While Beaver players say
they just love to play, the frustra
tion comes across loud and clear.
"Right now we're in a bad situ
ation," Olford said. "Nothing's
going right. There isn't any way
to explain it. Me and a lot of the
other seniors came in to turn this
thing around, and we're still at
the same point as when we came
in here."
The Stanford football team did what
it had to do last Saturday and not much
else. An abysmal 30,665 witnessed a
game that was as exciting as watching
the Foster Field turf turn brown
between the hashes.
In the process, Stanford ended two
of the stranger quirks in college foot
ball this year. The Cardinal became the
106 th Division I-A team to win a home
game (Stanford still has not lost on the
road) and won after scoring first for the
only time in three such opportunities,
all in the past three games (Stanford
hasn't been defeated when the oppo

nent has scored first).
The Cardinal took care of business
early, jumping to a big lead and holding
an inept Beaver offense in check the
whole way. Stanford did little to con
vince anybody to vault the Cardinal
back into the rankings, but the Beavers
did little to dissuade the notion that
they belong in the Big Sky Conference,
not the Pacific 10.
Although the last 25 minutes fea
tured no scoring, the game's highlight
came in the fourth quarter when back
up quarterback Tim Carey made his
long-awaited debut. The redshirt
sophomore who battled with Mark
Butterfield for the starting job last
spring completed three of four passes

for just 12 yards but demonstrated a
lively arm.
After entering the Stanford pro
gram in 1993 amid much fanfare,
Carey was happy to step onto the field
in a game situation for the first time
with the Cardinal.
"I thought we'd blow out a couple of
teams and I'd get an opportunity (to
play,)" Carey said. "But we've played
some good teams and they've kept it
close, so I've just had to wait.
"I definitely thought I'd get in this
one."
Junior running back Mike Mitchell
said that Carey could not hide his gid-
diness about the chance to play.
"You could see the excitement in
his eyes," he said. "We thought
we were going to score."
While the Stanford offense
didn't provide fireworks, the
Beaver offense disintegrated into
ashes. Early on, Oregon State
varied from its double-slot forma
tion and received help from three
offsides penalties on the opening
drive. But the Beavers couldn't
take advantage and ended up with
seven possessions of 15 yards or
less.
"The effort's always there,"
said OSU senior halfback Mark
Olford. "The whole line pretty
much dominated the line of
scrimmage. We had a lot of big
runs inside with the fullback, but
we just couldn't get the big plays
outside."
While junior fullback Darron
Kirkman rushed for 72 yards on
nine carries, Stanford held quick
quarterback Tim Alexander to 44
yards on 16 tries, 36 of them on
one attempt. Alexander was
benched in favor of Don Shanklin
late in the third quarter.
The Beavers also shot them
selves in the foot with three lost
fumbles. Stanford contributed to
the sloppiness as well, with a sea
son-high 12 penalties and two
fumbled punts by sophomore
Damon Dunn. Oregon State never
capitalized on the penalties, and
Dunn recovered both fumbles,
including one that didn't matter
due to fair-catch interference.
While Oregon State failed to
move the ball consistently, head
coach Jerry Pettibone refused to
blame the option. Instead, he
relied on his favorite crutch — the
kicking game.

"I felt like we had a lot of
offense there," Pettibone said.
"The kicking game's been our
Achilles heel all year 1 think if we
hadn't had mistakes in the kick
ing game, we would have been
right in there."
Pettibone cited Stanford's
opening kickoff return to the
Beaver 41 and Marc Williams'
fumbled punt at the Beaver 15 in
the second half. Both miscues
gave Stanford excellent field posi
tion and led to Cardinal scores.
Special-teams monster Jeff
Byrd recovered the Williams fum
ble and also carried the ball for
the first time with the Cardinal.
Byrd has registered 12 tackles on
special teams alone.
"Any time I have a chance to
make a turnover and help my
team score, I'm going to be
happy," Byrd said.
Pettibone's offense could have
used such help. After Stanford
held his team to a season-low
three points, Pettibone said the
Cardinal compares favorably with
other teams in the Pac-10 the
Beavers have faced.
"I think Stanford and [No. 15J
Washington are very comparable
football teams," Pettibone said.
"The thing that's really impres
sive about Stanford is their ability
to run the football. Tyrone Will
ingham's done an excellent job
with this program."
On the other hand, Pettibone's
work with his program comes
under more ("ire with each Beaver

tion comes across loud and clear.
