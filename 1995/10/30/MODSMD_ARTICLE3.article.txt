## SEAS members decry Pepsico investments

Members of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford
hope that people will think a little
harder about human rights issues
before biting into their next bean
burrito.
To that end, they held a White
Plaza rally and a 2 1/2-mile march
to Taco Bell Friday to protest Pep
sico Inc.'s financial involvement
in Burma.
Pepsico owns Taco Bell, along
with the Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Pizza Hut restaurant chains,
and is planning to open restau
rants and a bottling plant in
Burma.
The rally and march were part
of an ongoing effort by SEAS to
heighten campus awareness of the
social and political ills that plague
Burma, a country in southeast
Asia. Burma is governed by a mili
tary regime called the State Law
and Order Restoration Council, or
SLORC.
Over the past year, SEAS has
questioned the University's large
investments in the Texaco and
Unocal corporations, both strong
financial backers of the SLORC.
This year, SEAS is working to cre

According to SEAS member
Nick Thompson, who is also a
member of the University's Advi

Taco Bell rather than to a Texaco
or Unocal station to maximize stu

The rally began at 11:30 a.m.
and was attended by about 50 peo
ple. SEAS members hoisted ban
ners and beat metal pots with
kitchen utensils to attract atten
tion, while other students
boomed, "Free Burma now" and
"Hey hey, ho ho, Pepsico has got
to go" through a megaphone.
Jane Jerome, chair of the Ray
Area Burma Round Table and one
of the speakers at the rally, assert
ed that "the SLORC's idea of law
and order is to keep people from
having any basic rights."
She added that it relies on the
financial support of companies
like Texaco and Unocal to remain
in power.
Jerome explained that the
SLORC uses money from foreign
investors to purchase arms from
China to "exterminate" the pro
democracy opposition and ethnic
minorities.
She also lamented the
