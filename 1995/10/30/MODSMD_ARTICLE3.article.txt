## SEAS members decry Pepsico investments 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
Members of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford
hope that people will think a little
harder about human rights issues
before biting into their next bean
burrito.
To that end, they held a White
Plaza rally and a 2 1/2-mile march
to Taco Bell Friday to protest Pep
sico Inc.'s financial involvement
in Burma.
Pepsico owns Taco Bell, along
with the Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Pizza Hut restaurant chains,
and is planning to open restau
rants and a bottling plant in
Burma.
The rally and march were part
of an ongoing effort by SEAS to
heighten campus awareness of the
social and political ills that plague
Burma, a country in southeast
Asia. Burma is governed by a mili
tary regime called the State Law
and Order Restoration Council, or
SLORC.
Over the past year, SEAS has
questioned the University's large
investments in the Texaco and
Unocal corporations, both strong
financial backers of the SLORC.
This year, SEAS is working to cre
ate proposals for sound invest
ment and selective purchasing
policies for the University, accord

ing to SEAS co-coordinator Kelly
Naylor.
According to SEAS member
Nick Thompson, who is also a
member of the University's Advi
sory Panel on Investment Respon
sibility, SEAS chose to march to
Taco Bell rather than to a Texaco
or Unocal station to maximize stu
dent involvement in the protest.
The rally began at 11:30 a.m.
and was attended by about 50 peo
ple. SEAS members hoisted ban
ners and beat metal pots with
kitchen utensils to attract atten
tion, while other students
boomed, "Free Burma now" and
"Hey hey, ho ho, Pepsico has got
to go" through a megaphone.
Jane Jerome, chair of the Ray
Area Burma Round Table and one
of the speakers at the rally, assert
ed that "the SLORC's idea of law
and order is to keep people from
having any basic rights."
She added that it relies on the
financial support of companies
like Texaco and Unocal to remain
in power.
Jerome explained that the
SLORC uses money from foreign
investors to purchase arms from
China to "exterminate" the pro
democracy opposition and ethnic
minorities.
She also lamented the
SLORC's policy of "slave labor."
A flier distributed at the rally said
that such forced labor would be
used in the construction of a
pipeline to pump gasoline from
Burma into Thailand, a project
proposed by Texaco and Unocal.
Rollin Vanbik, a student at
UC-Berkeley who has been exiled
from his native Burma for seven
years, also spoke. He recounted

many of the horrors Burmese cit
izens have suffered at the hands
of the SLORC — including one
anecdote about a woman who
died after her breast was cut off
by Burmese soldiers when she
failed to get to work because she
was breast-feeding her newborn
child.
Vanbik entreated listeners to
"please help stop this brutality
and cruelty ... by boycotting
those investors that have been
aiding this military regime in its
oppression."
As the final speaker before the

march to Taco Bell, Thompson
urged students to take control of
their power to protest.
Thompson said that because
Stanford has $10 million invested
in Texaco and Unocal, "we have a
lot of power" to change things.
"This is not just al>out freeing
Burma for Burma's sake. It's
about students working against
the brutes who are kicking people
down.
"Our eyes were closed, but now
they're open — we're not going to
close them until we stare these
corporations down," he said.
Chanting "Taco Bell, Burmese
hell" and carrying signs, about 30
students marched through cam
pus by way of Serra Street and
down El Camino Real to the Taco
Bell franchise. A few peoplejoined
the march along the way, with
drivers honking and giving the
thumbs-up sign as they passed.
Students handed out fliers to will
ing passers-by.
SEAS members spoke with
police and the managers of the
franchise in advance to alert them
to the protest. Picketers remained
on the sidewalk in front of the
restaurant so as not stand on its
property or obstruct its patrons.
The protesters picketed for
about 20 minutes, alternately
chanting and giving brief speech
es to explain Pepsico's involve
ment in Burma.
They presented the franchise
managers with a petition that
urged Taco Bell to acknowledge
Pepsico's role in Burma and to
send a letter to Pepsico demand
ing the company's withdrawal
from Burma and reparations "for
the profit they have made on
human abuses in Burma."
The assistant manager refused
to sign the petition and directed
the protesters to Taco Bell's pub
lic affairs department.
Lunchtime patrons seemed
unaffected by the picketers
though, as SEAS co-coordinator
Greg Wright pointed out, no one
was left on the patio at the con
clusion of the protest.
One onlooker, apparently a
local high school student, brought
up a new point of contention upon
hearing the subject of the stu
dents' protest.
"Aw!" he moaned. "But I love
Taco Bell!"
He was shortly offered comfort
from a nearby Stanford student.
"I know," she said. "We all do.
Doesn't it suck?"

ment in Burma.
They presented the franchise
managers with a petition that
urged Taco Bell to acknowledge
Pepsico's role in Burma and to
send a letter to Pepsico demand
ing the company's withdrawal
from Burma and reparations "for
the profit they have made on
human abuses in Burma."
The assistant manager refused
to sign the petition and directed
the protesters to Taco Bell's pub
lic affairs department.
Lunchtime patrons seemed
unaffected by the picketers
though, as SEAS co-coordinator
Greg Wright pointed out, no one
was left on the patio at the con
clusion of the protest.
One onlooker, apparently a
local high school student, brought
up a new point of contention upon
hearing the subject of the stu
dents' protest.
"Aw!" he moaned. "But I love
Taco Bell!"
He was shortly offered comfort
from a nearby Stanford student.
"I know," she said. "We all do.
Doesn't it suck?"
Members of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford
hope that people will think a little
harder about human rights issues
before biting into their next bean
burrito.
To that end, they held a White
Plaza rally and a 2 1/2-mile march
to Taco Bell Friday to protest Pep
sico Inc.'s financial involvement
in Burma.
Pepsico owns Taco Bell, along
with the Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Pizza Hut restaurant chains,
and is planning to open restau
rants and a bottling plant in
Burma.
The rally and march were part
of an ongoing effort by SEAS to
heighten campus awareness of the
social and political ills that plague
Burma, a country in southeast
Asia. Burma is governed by a mili
tary regime called the State Law
and Order Restoration Council, or
SLORC.
Over the past year, SEAS has
questioned the University's large
investments in the Texaco and
Unocal corporations, both strong
financial backers of the SLORC.
This year, SEAS is working to cre
ate proposals for sound invest
ment and selective purchasing
policies for the University, accord

ing to SEAS co-coordinator Kelly
Naylor.
According to SEAS member
Nick Thompson, who is also a
member of the University's Advi
sory Panel on Investment Respon
sibility, SEAS chose to march to
Taco Bell rather than to a Texaco
or Unocal station to maximize stu
dent involvement in the protest.
The rally began at 11:30 a.m.
and was attended by about 50 peo
ple. SEAS members hoisted ban
ners and beat metal pots with
kitchen utensils to attract atten
tion, while other students
boomed, "Free Burma now" and
"Hey hey, ho ho, Pepsico has got
to go" through a megaphone.
Jane Jerome, chair of the Ray
Area Burma Round Table and one
of the speakers at the rally, assert
ed that "the SLORC's idea of law
and order is to keep people from
having any basic rights."
She added that it relies on the
financial support of companies
like Texaco and Unocal to remain
in power.
Jerome explained that the
SLORC uses money from foreign
investors to purchase arms from
China to "exterminate" the pro
democracy opposition and ethnic
minorities.
She also lamented the
SLORC's policy of "slave labor."
A flier distributed at the rally said
that such forced labor would be
used in the construction of a
pipeline to pump gasoline from
Burma into Thailand, a project
proposed by Texaco and Unocal.
Rollin Vanbik, a student at
UC-Berkeley who has been exiled
from his native Burma for seven
years, also spoke. He recounted

many of the horrors Burmese cit
izens have suffered at the hands
of the SLORC — including one
anecdote about a woman who
died after her breast was cut off
by Burmese soldiers when she
failed to get to work because she
was breast-feeding her newborn
child.
Vanbik entreated listeners to
"please help stop this brutality
and cruelty ... by boycotting
those investors that have been
aiding this military regime in its
oppression."
As the final speaker before the

march to Taco Bell, Thompson
urged students to take control of
their power to protest.
Thompson said that because
Stanford has $10 million invested
in Texaco and Unocal, "we have a
lot of power" to change things.
"This is not just al>out freeing
Burma for Burma's sake. It's
about students working against
the brutes who are kicking people
down.
"Our eyes were closed, but now
they're open — we're not going to
close them until we stare these
corporations down," he said.
Chanting "Taco Bell, Burmese
hell" and carrying signs, about 30
students marched through cam
pus by way of Serra Street and
down El Camino Real to the Taco
Bell franchise. A few peoplejoined
the march along the way, with
drivers honking and giving the
thumbs-up sign as they passed.
Students handed out fliers to will
ing passers-by.
SEAS members spoke with
police and the managers of the
franchise in advance to alert them
to the protest. Picketers remained
on the sidewalk in front of the
restaurant so as not stand on its
property or obstruct its patrons.
The protesters picketed for
about 20 minutes, alternately
chanting and giving brief speech
es to explain Pepsico's involve
ment in Burma.
They presented the franchise
managers with a petition that
urged Taco Bell to acknowledge
Pepsico's role in Burma and to
