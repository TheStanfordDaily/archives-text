Continuing to demonstrate that it can beat its
opponent sin a variety of ways and with any one of its
dangerous players having a big night, the No. 4 Stan
ford women's volleyball team (19-2 overall, 13-0
Pacific 10 Conference) won its 15th and 16th consec
utive matches on the road last weekend, defeating
No. 17 Arizona and No. 14 Arizona State in straight
games.
Stanford thoroughly dominated the Wildcats, win
ning 15-4, 15-2, 15-6 despite hitting just .243 jus a
team. Although many critics accuse the Cardinal of
fielding an average defensive team, Stanford hand
cuffed Arizona.

The Wildcats recorded more errors than kills in
the match and finished with a goose egg in hitting
percentage. For the first time all season, the Cardinal
held an opponent to a .000 percentage.
Sophomore setter / outside hitter Lisa Sharpley
led Stanford, hitting .500 with 10 kills and five digs.
Senior outside hitter Wendy Hromadka showed why
she still deserves her spot in the starting lineup
ahead of senior Marnie Triefenbach, finishing with
nine kills and a .450 hitting percentage.
The Cardinal looked strong against a determined
Sun Devils squad Friday night in Tempe. After a
hard-fought second game went its way, the Cardinal
closed out ASU quickly in game three, winning it 15-
6.
The story of game three, as was the case through
out the contest, was Stanford's excellent passing,
which opened up its entire offensive attack. Continu
ing a formula that has held for the last six matches,
Stanford managed to distribute its kills evenly and
confuse the Sun Devil defense. Six Cardinal players
posted at least six kills, paced by Sharpley. Sharpley
registered her second consecutive outstanding per
formance, hitting an astonishing .706 for the match.
She recorded 13 kills in only 17 attempts.
After the match, Sharpley
noted that injuries to the Sun
Devils, which left ASU with only
one middle blocker, contributed
greatly to Stanford's success. "We

were definitely able to take advan
tage [of the injuries,)" she said.
"We could run our whole offense a
lot more effectively and have a lot
of fun out there.
"We were able to take advan
tage of their blocking weaknesses
and move (hem around a little bit."
In the second game, ASU gave
Stanford its best shot, building an

early lead before eventually falling
15-13. Senior outside hitter Jen
nifer Snyder led the Sun Devils
with 18 kills and while hitting
.314. Freshman hitter Holly
Sones sparked ASU in game two
with six of her eight kills. For the
match, Sones hit .375.
Game one resembled game
three, as Stanford came out firing

for one of the few times this season.
Entering the match with just a 12-8
record in opening games, the Cardi
nal built an early five-point advan
tage and extended to a 15-7 victory.
"We're playing really well right
now," Sharpley said. "I think we
have a mental edge. Most of the
teams we play want to win, but
expect to lose."
