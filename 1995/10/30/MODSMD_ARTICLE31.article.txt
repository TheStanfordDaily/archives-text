Stanford 15

It has been a long time coming,
but the Stanford men's water polo
team (13-6, 2-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) finally won
another game yesterday. The Car
dinal ended its four-game drought
yesterday in impressive fashion,
mastering the Pepperdine Waves
(9-8, 2-4) in a 15-11 home victory.
Before the win against the
Waves, the Cardinal had gone
without a victory since Oct. 1,
when it beat California in the

semi-finals of the Northern Cali
fornia Tournament. After nearly a
month of emerging on the wrong
end of close games, yesterday's
victory came as welcome relief to
the Stanford squad.
"That was a much needed vic
tory," said head coach Dante Det
tamanti, breathing a sigh of relief.
"We got back on the winning
track."
After starting slowly in three of
its previous four games, the Cardi
nal came out with all pistons fir
ing against the Waves. At first, it
looked as though Stanford might
settle into its trend of missed
opportunities when junior two
meter man Brian Wallin rocketed
a shot off of the crossbar. But
when the Cardinal next brought
the ball down the pool, senior
Jeremy Laster took the ball at the

inside wing position and powered
a shot into the back of the net for
the first goal of the afternoon.
The Cardinal took a 2-0 lead
when Wallin received the ball at
the two-meter spot, made a strong
move around his defender and
beat Wave goalie Merrill Moses.
Just over a minute later, Wallin
again threatened in front of the
goal, but he was fouled by his
guard, awarding Stanford a penal
ty shot. Laster converted the
opportunity, giving Stanford a
three-goal edge.
Senior Josh Leachman kept the
Cardinal momentum rolling when
he freed himself on the counterat
tack. After receiving a pass from
sophomore Layne Beaubien,
Leachman buried the ball in the
net, extending Stanford's lead to
four points.
The Cardinal could not shut
Pepperdine out indefinitely, how
ever, particularly in light of the
fact that the Waves' line-up
includes a player like Alan Her
rmann. The 6-foot-4, 250-pound
Herrmann is one of the top center
forwards in the country, and he
began to assert himself at the tail
end of the first quarter, scoring
two goals in the final two minutes.
Senior goalie Jack Bowen stopped
a Herrmann shot to prevent the
Waves from securing a hat trick in
the first period.
Senior Dan Hancock finished
off the quarter on a positive note
for the Cardinal when he added a
goal of his own with 16 seconds to
play in the first quarter.
