Stanford 15

It has been a long time coming,
but the Stanford men's water polo
team (13-6, 2-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) finally won
another game yesterday. The Car
dinal ended its four-game drought
yesterday in impressive fashion,
mastering the Pepperdine Waves
(9-8, 2-4) in a 15-11 home victory.
Before the win against the
Waves, the Cardinal had gone
without a victory since Oct. 1,
when it beat California in the

semi-finals of the Northern Cali
fornia Tournament. After nearly a
month of emerging on the wrong
end of close games, yesterday's
victory came as welcome relief to
the Stanford squad.
"That was a much needed vic
tory," said head coach Dante Det
tamanti, breathing a sigh of relief.
"We got back on the winning
track."
After starting slowly in three of
its previous four games, the Cardi
nal came out with all pistons fir
ing against the Waves. At first, it
looked as though Stanford might
settle into its trend of missed
opportunities when junior two
meter man Brian Wallin rocketed
a shot off of the crossbar. But
when the Cardinal next brought
the ball down the pool, senior
Jeremy Laster took the ball at the

inside wing position and powered
a shot into the back of the net for
the first goal of the afternoon.
The Cardinal took a 2-0 lead
when Wallin received the ball at
the two-meter spot, made a strong
move around his defender and
beat Wave goalie Merrill Moses.
Just over a minute later, Wallin
again threatened in front of the
goal, but he was fouled by his
guard, awarding Stanford a penal
ty shot. Laster converted the
opportunity, giving Stanford a
three-goal edge.
Senior Josh Leachman kept the
Cardinal momentum rolling when
he freed himself on the counterat
tack. After receiving a pass from
sophomore Layne Beaubien,
Leachman buried the ball in the
net, extending Stanford's lead to
four points.
The Cardinal could not shut
Pepperdine out indefinitely, how
ever, particularly in light of the
fact that the Waves' line-up
includes a player like Alan Her
rmann. The 6-foot-4, 250-pound
Herrmann is one of the top center
forwards in the country, and he
began to assert himself at the tail
end of the first quarter, scoring
two goals in the final two minutes.
Senior goalie Jack Bowen stopped
a Herrmann shot to prevent the
Waves from securing a hat trick in
the first period.
Senior Dan Hancock finished
off the quarter on a positive note
for the Cardinal when he added a
goal of his own with 16 seconds to
play in the first quarter.

The second period of play fea
tured a dearth of scoring opportu
nities for both teams. Pepper
dine's Scott SeminofT scored the
first goal of the quarter with three
minutes, 34 seconds left in the
contest, capitalizing on a penalty
>hot that had been assessed to
Wallin. Thirty seconds later,
Seminoff struck again with a lob
shot that floated just out of
Bowen's reach. The goal brought
the Waves to within one point of
the Cardinal, 5-4.
But Dettamanti's squad was
determined not to squander the
lead that it had amassed. Just six
seconds after Seminoffs second
goal, Wallin notched his second
point of the match during a Stan
ford 6-on-5 situation.
In the third quarter, the Cardi

nal began to dominate the Waves.
Hancock opened things up in the
second half by scoring on a coun
terattack, skipping the ball past
Moses to give Stanford a 7-4
advantage and posting his second
goal of the game. Hancock fin
ished off his hat trick just seconds
later in a man-up situation when
he popped free in front of the goal
and buried the ball in the back of
the net.
After Herrmann scored his
third goal of the game from the
two-meter position, Laster
showed that he too can play cen
ter-forward. Receiving the ball
from the perimeter, Laster
shrugged off his defender and
lined a backhand shot past Moses.
The third quarter also saw the
Cardinal receive key contributions
from a number of reserve players.
Junior Bryce Matthews spelled
Wallin in the two-meter spot and
drew a penalty shot. Junior
Michael Pyle scored Stanford's

12th goal of the contest when he
found himself open after a hard
counterattack.
"Our reserves played really
well today," Laster said. "It is
really great to see all those guys
step up because we are going to be
needing them at the end of the
season. In the conference tourna
ment. we'll be playing three games
in three days and guys will be get
ting tired, so we are going to need
contributions from everybody."
Entering the fourth quarter,
the Cardinal held a 12-6 advan
tage over the Waves. After Her
rmann scored on a penalty shot,
Widlin answered for the Cardinal
with his third goal of the game.
Twenty seconds later, senior
Daniel I>ehoczky stole the ball and
drove half the length of the pool
for his second point of the match.
At that point, with the score
14-7 in favor of the Cardinal, it
seemed as though a victory was
assured. But Pepperdine kept

playing hard, and the Waves rat
tled off four consecutive points to
pull within three of the Cardinal.
But Wallin then flicked in his
fourth goal of the match to quell
any possibility of a Waves come
back.
Besides exorcising the demons
of its four-game skid, the victory
over the Waves was significant to
Stanford for a number of reasons.
For the first time this month, the
Cardinal managed to execute
offensively while essentially sti
fling its opponent.
"Jeremy and Jack did a great
job on Herrmann today," Detta
manti said. "He got four goals out
of the two-meter spot, but that
was okay because we were playing
a pressing defense — nobody was
helping out from the perimeter.
And with everyone pressing their
men, our counterattack was really
effective."
While Laster contained the
dangerous Herrmann, Bowen had

a career day in goal. The senior,
who earned First-Team Ail-Amer
ican honors last year, pulled down
or deflected a personal-best 17
shots, including a number of spec
tacular saves at point blank range.
The pressure defense which the
Cardinal implemented served to
limit the number of scoring oppor
tunities for Pepperdine. Going
into the fourth quarter, by which
time the game was largely decided,
only Herrmann and SeminofT had
scored for the Waves. By contrast,
each of the Cardinal starters
recorded at least one point after
three quarters of play.
With its defensive strategies
working to near perfection, the
Cardinal offense likewise flowed
smoothly. Both the counterat
tack and the 6-on-5 situations,
two areas in which Stanford has
been suspect at times, proved
highly effective. The Cardinal
created three goals from the tran
sition game and were a perfect

four out of four in man-up oppor
tunities. Wallin paced the Cardi
nal with four goals. Hancock and
Laster each registered hat tricks,
while contributed two
goals.
"I think that what was huge
about today's game was that we
executed our game plan," Laster
said. "We basically got together
before the game, discussed what
we wanted to do and then we went
out there and did it."
While the final minutes of the
game provided some uninvited
excitement, Dettamanti neverthe
less came away from the game
with a positive feeling.
"We pretty much dominated
that game," Dettamanti said. "We
were under control and had com
mand of all facets of our game.
Sometimes you want to win so
badly, you get over-anxious. But
the guys were real calm and they
just went out there and executed
and did what had to be done."
