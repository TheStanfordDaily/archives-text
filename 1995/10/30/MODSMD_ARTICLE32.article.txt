10 Cross Country Championships rumbled through
the Stanford Golf Course under a sunny, cloudless

Melody Fairchild ran a time of 17:21 to place fifth.

"We got hurt by not running Kortney," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "With her, we place five in the
top 15 and it's a runaway. It's such a small meet that
[someone being hurt] does change the complexity of
