# Ducks sweep Pac-10 crowns
## Cardinal cross country places men second, women third 
### Edward Guzman Contributing writer 
The sky was the limit last Saturday as the Pacific
10 Cross Country Championships rumbled through
the Stanford Golf Course under a sunny, cloudless
sky.
Spectators witnessed new records and the return
of Oregon supremacy. The Ducks emerged as the new
champions on both the men's and women's sides,
denying the Cardinal women a third straight confer
ence title. The Stanford women finished third, while
the Cardinal men improved on last year's finish to
take second, only five points short of the Ducks.
As anticipated, bringing together eight nationally
ranked teams to compete for both league crowns pro
vided one of the closest championships in recent
years.
In the women's nine-team 5000 meter race, Amy
Skieresz of Arizona set a new course record by run
ning a time of 16 minutes, 45 seconds, shattering the
old record set at last year's Pac-lOs by over 15 sec
onds. Oregon senior Jenna Carlson finished second
overall with a time of 17:08, pacing Oregon to a 55-
point performance. Teammate and fellow senior
Melody Fairchild ran a time of 17:21 to place fifth.
Stanford competed without the services of sopho
more Kortney Dunscombe, who finished fourth in
last year's race. With six points separating the top
three teams, Dunscombe, out with a back injury,
would have made a significant difference.
"We got hurt by not running Kortney," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "With her, we place five in the
top 15 and it's a runaway. It's such a small meet that
[someone being hurt] does change the complexity of
the race."
Despite her absence, the rest of the Cardinal
stepped up impressively, placing three runners in the

top 10 for a 61-point tally. Fresh
man Mary Cobb once again
spearheaded the Cardinal, cap
turing third overall with a time
of 17:12.
"Mary did a great job," Lanan
na said. "She really went for it. At
nationals, she'll do a great job."
Junior Monal Chokshi came in
seventh with a time of 17:35.
Sophomore Sarna Renfro fol
lowed next for the Cardinal, fin
ishing 10th in a time of 17:40.
Junior Leila Burr and sophomore
Sara Moore rounded out Stan
ford's top five with times of 17:50
and 18:12 while taking 15th and
26th place, respectively.
Dunscombe's status is uncer
tain. "We'll probably hold her
until the [NCAA Championships
on Nov. 20,]" Lananna said. With
that return date, Dunscombe
would remain out of commission
through the NCAA District-8
Regional Championships.
The men's race provided no
less drama than the women's
opening act, as Oregon and Stan
ford struggled throughout the
8000 meter race to maintain posi
tion and garner key places. In the

end, however, Oregon finished
ahead of the Cardinal 53-58 in
the eight-team meet.
Junior Karl Keska of Oregon
captured the individual title, run
ning a time of 24:14 and edging
Bob Keino of Arizona by three sec
onds. Keska's teammate, sopho
more Matt Davis, took fourth
place with a time of 24:32.
The Cardinal's top runner was
junior Greg Jimmerson, who fin
ished seventh in 24:41. Stanford
sophomore Nathan Nutter fol
lowed immediately behind with a
time of 24:48, good for eight.
Freshman Brent Hauser came
in 13th, crossing the line in
25:05. Junior J.J White (25:13)
and freshman Jason Balkman
(25:15) placed 14th and 16th
respectively.
"It was a great, great race,"
Lananna said. "I was extremely
pleased. Our kids ran very, very
well. I thought Oregon would win
due to the small numbers. On the
women's side, we'll do some
regrouping and get them ready
[for the District-8 meet). As for
the men, there's not much we
need to do except for some fine
tuning."
Stanford's next test will be on
Nov. 11, when it heads to Port
land, Ore. for the District-8
championships.
