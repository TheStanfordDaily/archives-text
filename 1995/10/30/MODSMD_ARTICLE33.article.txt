Don't look now, but Erin Martin is on fire.
The red-hot junior forward from Arcadia, Calif,
scored her seventh goal in four matches yesterday
to cap another successful weekend for the Stanford
women's soccer team (14-3 overall, 5-0 Pacific 10
Conference), which continued its late-season tear
with a pair of road victories at Washington (8-7, 2-
3) and Washington State (4-11-1, 1-5).
Martin, who recorded four goals last weekend in
wins over USC and UCLA (earning her Athlete of
the Week honors), knocked in two second-half goals
to lift the ninth-ranked Cardinal to a 3-1 victory
over Washington last Friday. She then added
another score in yesterday's 3-0 blanking of Wash

ington State to run her team-leading total to 13.
The women's string of consecutive victories has
now extended to seven, their longest winning
streak since they opened the 1994 season with 10
straight. The Cardinal now stands in excellent posi
tion to earn one of eight first-round byes when
seedings for the NCAA playoffs are announced next
week.
Martin opened the scoring nine minutes, one
second into the second half of Friday's game when
she dribbled around two defenders and launched a
25-yard shot into the lower left corner of the Husky
goal. She connected again just nine minutes later,
redirecting a free cross kick from midfielder Dena
Dey into the net at 63:34. Senior defender Jessica
Fischer iced it at 73:38 when she knocked in a cor
ner kick from sophomore midfielder Rita Hermiz.
"Our defense played well," said Washington
coach Leslie Gallimore, "but Stanford is a very
good team, and our defense couldn't absorb their
pressure the whole game."
The women wasted little time getting down to
business in yesterday's drubbing of Washington
State. Sophomore midfielder Elie Foster scored
what could have amounted to the game-winning
goal just 2:15 into the match when she gathered in
a corner kick from Dena Dey and smacked a hard
roller towards the Cougar goal.
The ball slipped off the hands of
WSU's freshman goalkeeper Jes
sica Glazer and went between her
legs and over the goal line to give
the Cardinal a 1-0 lead. Martin
then extended the lead just before
halftime when she took a corner
kick from Fischer and headed it
past a diving Glazer.
The final Cardinal goal came
as a result of Dey's determina
tion. Dey saved a loose ball head
ed for the end line and kicked it

back over her head to Hermiz,
who booted it past Glazer and
into the lower right corner of the
Husky net. Stanford freshman
goalie Erin Bryla collected four
saves to earn her eighth shutout
of the year.
With a 5-0 Pac-10 record,
Stanford remains atop the con
ference standings in what is
essentially the inaugural season
of Pac-10 women's soccer (the
sport was sponsored by the con
ference in 1993 but took a hiatus
last season). The Cardinal can
wrap up the title and an unde
feated conference record with a
win over Arizona in next Sun
day's regular-season finale.
