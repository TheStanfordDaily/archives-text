# STATE OF STUDENT AFFAIRS
## 
### 
Each year as I stand before you to give the State of Student
Affairs address I am more and more thankful that I came to
Stanford. It is the people like you who have weathered several
budget cuts and downsizing yet remain committed to the students
and the mission of the university that make Stanford the place to
be.
This summer when the affirmative action vote was taken, 1 was
proud that I work at a private university that has diversity woven
it into the very fabric of the institution. How fortunate we are to
have a President who was willing to announce publicly his
position on affirmative action. I quote from his statement, "The
university is an institution dedicated to the search to know - the
search to know of each member in her or his individual capacity.
A university needs to be integrated in order to pursue its tasks.
Even with affirmative action, students are evaluated and admitted
to Stanford as individuals, not in groups. No university can thrive
unless each member is accepted without regard to labels and
stereotypes. This is the case with students, faculty, and staff."
Indeed we are fortunate to have Gerhard Casper as our president.
As we approach the last half of the last decade of this century
what do we in student affairs face? Anne Leavitt at the University
of Oregon presented a paper at a recent Student Affairs
conference that captures the reality of what we are facing. Let me
quote some lines from her article entitled, "Swimming Upstream
in a Professional Maelstrom, Serving Students in the 1990s":
College students in the 90s come to campus with
urgent, contradictory and complex needs for
support. The challenge of serving these students
can feel to student affairs personnel like
drowning, or swimming against the current, or
dog paddling in circles. Its a maelstrom,
generated by the pace of change, the swirling,
contradictory flow of expectations and demands,
and the sometimes desperate sense of being too
busy responding to gain understanding or vision.
.... Environmental pressures are forcing
changes in service before professionals can lead
these changes. We are finding new niches
through reaction rather than through managed
change. We are scrambling for a developmental
construct for the out-of-class experience at a
time when students' life paths are so divergent
that development is hard to track. Just when
more "applied" or "experimental learning"
opportunities are welcome on campus, resource
strapped students are placing more priority on
the classroom experience as they rush to
complete their degree on time.
I am sure many of us resonate with this description of the change
of pace and its consequences. In spite of the environment as
described above, I am inspired by the resilient manner in which
you have adapted and responded to the fast pace of change that
has occurred at Stanford over the last few years. It appeared that
each time we started to develop a broad based strategic plan
something came up to divert our energy. We have survived budget
cuts, reallocation of resources and personnel, reorganization, and
the search and selection of several directors and a new dean of
students. Now we are in position to develop a strategic plan that
will inform our decisions as we move towards the next century.
This will assist us in managing change. Let me refresh your
memories of the major themes I have presented.
In my first State of Student Affairs I spoke about the need to
consider some paradigm shifts and presented the concept of the
African word, Masakhana, which translated to "Let us be
mutually constructive." We have tried to do that with some
success.
In the second State of Students Affairs presentation I proposed
that we look at what we do, determine if it made a positive
difference, and consider emphasizing process management and
new ways of doing business. I spoke, also, about the impending
budget reductions and the need to survive change through
resilience.
Having survived the cuts and reorganization, last year I spoke
about the need to consolidate our units and empower the staff.
By now I imagine you may have guessed that the buzz words this
year will be "Managed Change."
Let me give you three examples of how we have begun to manage
change in some areas of Student Affairs. Change can be
personally difficult when a staff member has to change how she or
he thinks about and does work, when she or he has to establish
new alliances, work in teams, learn new technologies at a fast
pace, and in some cases move from one work place to another.
The Financial Aid Office staff under the leadership of Dean Jim
Montoya is installing the AMS system to serve the financial aid
needs of students in a more effective, efficient, and user friendly
manner.
Another endeavor that was successful this year was the planning,
development of and implementation of the new ID card system.
Much of its success goes to Roger Printup and his staff. Will
those of you who were involved please stand and be recognized.
Two years ago Stanford received funding to develop the
Community Partnership for Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse
Prevention from the Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary
Education (FIPSI). Student interns in ten communities had the
opportunity to conduct research and to learn about cultural and/or
environmental issues as they affect the ways in which their peers
dealt with alcohol. We now have a more informed rationale for
programming designed specifically for each community. This

program has received national attention for it identified the
situational differences and heterogeneity of student populations
and their drinking patterns.
Imagine if you will, that student affairs has at least three spokes in
the wheel that supports the mission of the university. Our
decision making, the allocation of resources, and the development
of our strategic plan should be influenced by these three spokes:
• Commitment to a student focused paradigm.
• Support system of the academic mission of teaching, learning,
and research.
• Future oriented so as to be proactive rather than reactive.
Considering these underpinnings, let me outline five action plans
for this year that will involve the good offices of all of us. 1 will
consider them to be "works in progress" because they have short
and long term implications.
First, I would like for us to continue working towards an
environment where it is comfortable to develop a shared vision.
All of you must feel empowered to share your views and ideas
with your managers and others and vice versa. We need all of the
input we can get. I ask that you get the opinion of students on
issues of concern to them. Let them know that you respect and
are interested in understanding their point of view.
Second, I would like for you to find ways to encourage more
participation of alumni in your areas where appropriate and
feasible. In most instances our alumni are an untapped or only
partially tapped resource. They have rich expertise to share.
Many would like involvement but don't know how to open up the
dialogue. Open it up for them. The Alumni Association would be
happy to give you information on how to do so.
Third, I would like to see a reduction or elimination of the
perception held by students that we are against them. The
we/them perception that prevails can be eliminated to a great
degree by inclusion of more students in decision making and by
open communication on both sides. I have found that students do
not like to be told "no." However, if the "no" is accompanied by
a reasoned and rational explanation rarely do they not accept the
decision.. Often I have heard students say, "I don't like the
decision but the way you explained it helped me to see that the
decision is fair." I have found, also, that when students
understand policies and procedures that explain how decisions are
made and the rationale used in determining the outcomes they are
less likely to be suspicious of our motives. It can be a teaching
and learning situation for the students to understand from us how
an institution of higher learning, which is a very complex
organization, operates. Don't keep them out of the loop. Take
time for explanations.
This will not be an easy task. Ernest Boyer noted, rightly, in his
book, The Undergraduate Experience in America, that "the
dilemma for university administrators is how to influence student
behavior while respecting students' independence." In student
affairs we need to find that balance.
Fourth, I would like for us to turn more attention to what out of
classroom-laboratory-clinical experiences are possible for
graduate and professional school students with the limited amount
of time they have for such pursuits. Many of us have been
graduate students. We have experienced the stress, the isolation,
the alienation, the frustration, and the depression. We have also
experienced the relief and sense of accomplishment when the
work was completed successfully. They have yet to reach that
point of exhilaration. So let us think of more ways to involve them
in the life of the university. As with the alumni, they are a fertile
resource for our undergraduate students as tutors, mentors, and
role models. They can inspire the undergraduates to continue to
pursue their education beyond the baccalaureate degree. Graduate
students are asking for additional connections.
Lastly, this is the year to focus more on building the sturdy
bridges between the academy and residential education. Often we
hear negative comments about residential education but rarely do
we get information that identifies clearly the issues. I have asked
our new Director, Jane Camarillo, to undertake the identification
of issues and concerns so that we might remedy the problems and
develop new initiatives to enhance further the out-of-classroom
educational experience for students. This will be done in
collaboration with the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education,
Ramon Saldivar, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
students, faculty, and staff.
In this my fourth year, with stable leadership at the senior staff
level, it is time to focus on specific areas that need our attention.
We must assess critically the present situation in order to
determine what ought to be. We must establish a research agenda
to ascertain the profile of the Stanford student today, then build
our programs, activities, and support systems to meet their needs.
We must - and thus are - revisiting our core values to determine if
they are appropriate today, and we must understand current laws
and policies both internal and external that define or influence the
manner in which we do business.
Over the last three years it has become apparent to me and others
that we need to address issues and concerns in three specific areas
that affect student life and the good order of the university. Those
areas are: student alcohol use and abuse; the Greek system; and
the student judicial system. Let me take them one at a time.
Since I came to Stanford and questioned our posture on alcohol
related student behavior, it has been reported that I wish to turn
RAs into police. Those words have never come from my mouth.
To me it is about being healthy in body and mind. It is about
caring for yourself and your peers. It is about maintaining a
healthy lifestyle in order to make the most out of the

undergraduate, graduate, or professional educational experience.
It is a mystery to me that those who are in the business of
developing community are reluctant to do much about the very
thing that destroys community most. We need to understand
how that has come to be so.
As I stated in the RA and RF training sessions this year, I
believe that there are three student populations that need our
attention. They are: the student who binges; those students
who choose not to drink and those who wish not be around
those who do so to excess; and the frosh who are most
vulnerable to the establishment of alcohol patterns during the
first twelve weeks of their college experience.
The concern over the dreaded "A" word has grown to gigantic
proportions this quarter. Over the last few weeks the DAILY has
had several articles on the university alcohol policy and student
reactions to certain parts of it. I believe that the conversations
that occurred at RA and RF training and are occurring now, the
energy around the issues, and the ambivalence and frustration
students are expressing is a healthy sign that the topic of
substance use and abuse which has been silent for so long is
now discussed openly. There is a sense that no one understands
the policy. The policy is very clear - as is the criminal code - on
alcohol-related conduct. What is not clear is the set of
procedures that allow the policy to be implemented in a
consistent manner and the delineation of the role of those in
positions to make a difference.
The procedures for specific situations and area of responsibility
and accountability must be clarified. Therefore I shall establish
a task force to be comprised of faculty, students, and staff who
have expertise on the subject, and those who have an interest or
a stake in the outcomes to conduct a systematic review of
policies, procedures to clarify expected behavior of students,
staff, and others, and to make recommendations to me.
We cannot justify what we do currently without looking
critically at the consequences. Therefore, the task force will be
asked to study past and present practices; research the health
and risk factors; study the relevant state and federal laws and
the University policy; review legal opinions relevant to risk;
review the latest national studies (the Columbia study and the
two Harvard studies) plus information on the current situation at
Stanford; discover how other comparable schools arc dealing
with issues of alcohol behavior on their campuses; and gather
data on the perceived and real problems on this campus through
valid and reliable research methodologies. Based on what has
been learned, they will make recommendations to me. I hope
that the work of the committee will be completed within this
academic year so that we will begin 1996-97 with clear
expectations and guidelines.
Let me share with you an example of how one university
approached this sensitive issue. Rutgers University received a
FIPSE grant to develop an approach to the implementation of
their alcohol policy. It was determined that "they needed a way
of thinking that urged collective action to balance the obsession
with individual rights, that promoted concern and connection
more than separation and rules and that encouraged care over
selfishness." They envisioned a web of caring as a metaphor
for engagement and a precondition for any desire to promote
community.
I like the concept of the "web of caring." Let us explore it
further. Janet Emig in The Web of Meaning (1983) wrote, "The
image of the web is a powerful one for us because it suggests a
complex series of connections, issues, motivations, and
circumstances. It helps suggest that the particular behavior is
bound up with many other issues. A web also offers many
opportunities to shift positions and to evade any particular
attempt to sort out one or a few strands of a problem .... the
web confirms the interconncctcdncss of much of what we do."
The second is the student Judicial system. The Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 has been amended several times but
there has not been a comprehensive review in many years.
Therefore, we shall begin a review process during this academic
year.
The third is the Greek System. Again, it has been several years
since a comprehensive review of the Greek system has been
undertaken. There are many issues that should be addressed.
One is not the demise of the Greek system at Stanford.
Repeatedly I hear that the university wishes to do away with the
Greek system. This perception is widely heard most often when
it is necessary to relieve a fraternity of its house for cause. I
have never sensed that perception to be the case. Greek
organizations, when they work well, bring a special vitality to a
campus. We wish that to be so on this campus. So it is time to
measure its health and see how, together, we can make the
system stronger.
Now I can hear you thinking that this is an ambitious order that
I have outlined today. But the time is ripe to begin. We will set
reasonable timelines and be flexible when necessary but we
must begin.
This Student Affairs organization has come a long way but there
are still many miles to go. We can never rest on our laurels at
any time. Change is constant. Although the mission of the
university remains essentially the same, the university changes,
administrations change, priorities change, values change,
faculty, staff and students change, resources and resource
allocations change, and the demographics of the state change.
Yes, change is a constant. But you have demonstrated that you
are up to the challenge.
