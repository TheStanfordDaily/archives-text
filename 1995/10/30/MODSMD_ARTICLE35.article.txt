Pacific Sports Federation) admin
istered a 4-2 whipping to California
(5-10-2, 1-6) in a home match yes
terday that could hardly be charac
terized as eye candy. Verbal war
fare between the referee and play
ers resulted in multiple red cards
and even more yellow cards. Mow
ever, both teams overcame the
obstacle cloaked in stripes to enter
tain the large crowd of Sunday
afternoon fans at Maloney Field.
Senior co-captain Chet Zimmer
constantly frustrated the Bears
offensive attacks by stealing or
clearing the ball almost at will,
while senior Ryan Estevez used
his size and strength to discard
the smaller Bear offensive players
and control loose balls. Senior
midfielder Steve Kirschbaum also
contributed an excellent effort,
assisting on both offense and
defense.
The entire Cardinal team
meshed into a resuscitated offense
and revitalized defense, playing
solidly and restraining itself
despite the challenges posed by the
bold referiv and Cal players.
The Bears initiated the scoring
when John Browne tapped in the
rebound of a save by the Cardinal's
freshman goalkeeper Jon Bruck in
the 15th minute. However, Stan

ford silenced the Cal offense for the
remainder of the half.
Stanford opened its largest scor
ing outing of the season two min
utes after Browne's strike when
sophomore defenseman Daniel
Wytock nailed a ball from far out
side the penalty box past the Cal
goalkeeper for his first goal of the
season.
In the 23rd minute, Cardinal co
captain Carmen D'Onofrio escaped
from the grasp of a Cal defender
that plagued him ;ill afternoon just
long enough to rocket a ball from
the top of the goal box into the net.
The Cardinal added to its 2-1
lead in the second half after less
than two minutes had elapsed.
Freshman A.J Sauer slipped the
ball by the Cal goalkeeper after
freshman Dan Tray lor carried the
ball to the right corner and
unleashed a well-placed cross.
Stanford's last goal of the
match came when the Cal goal
keeper illegally tackled a charging
Eric Vandevelde in the box.
Kirschbaum then rocketed the
penalty shot past Cal's backup
goaltender, who replaced the
Bears' ejected keeper.
Cal provided some excitement
bv scoring with nearly 10 minutes
left in the game. Raul Ornelas
eariuH.l his fourth goal of the sea
son by surprising Bruck with a
shot inside the box that followed a
confusing foul. However, the Car
dinal secured the win by control
ling the ball and tempo in the final
minutes.
"I liked not only the win, but
also that I got to see a lot of the
future of the program play," said
head coach Colin Lindores. "Near
ly everyone who was healthy
played."
