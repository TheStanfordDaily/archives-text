# Manzanita vote is yes on grapes
## The 						Grape Vote 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
In the first of many campus
votes, residents of Manzanita
chose last night to continue to
serve grapes in their dining hall.
In a close referendum, 90 resi
dents of Kimball, Castano and
Lantana voted not to boycott
grapes, while 82 voted for the boy
cott and 20 abstained.
More than 400 students live in
the three dorms. Abstaining was
an option on the ballot, but more
than 200 students did not vote at
all.
Resident assistants in the
three dorms said they felt they did
a good job educating students,
who then voted with all the evi
dence from both sides in hand.
But students involved with the

1994 hunger strike that began the
campaign for a University-wide
boycott on grapes were not happy
with the results, the first of many
that will come in from different
residences throughout the quar
ter.
"I'm disappointed," was all se

nior Elvira Prieto — one of four
students who refused to eat for
three days in May 1994 — had to
say.
Another student involved in
the issue, junior Eric Gavidia,
pledged to maintain his personal
boycott despite the vote in Kim
ball, where he lives.
"I will continue with the boy
cott on an individual basis, and
eat in a location on campus that
does not serve grapes, should
Manzanita continue to move for
ward with serving grapes,"
Gavidia said.
After the 1994 hunger strike,
University President Gerhard
Casper formed a Grape Policy
Committee, which last year rec
ommended that both residences
and administrative units be able
to vote on a boycott. Casper
rejected the recommendation for
administrative units, but said he
would allow residences to vote.
The deadline for residence
staff to begin discussions on the
grape issue was Friday. All resi
dences are supposed to complete
the voting process by Dec. 8, and
give the results to their dining
halls by Dec. 15.
Since classes began this year,
RAs, along with Assoc. Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga, chair of
the Grape Policy Committee,
have been educating students
through a variety of programs.
Fraga was out of town last
night and could not be reached
for comment.
Despite emotions that ran high
during and after the hunger
strike, RAs and students said the
results of the vote reflect a grow
ing apathy toward the subject.
"It's been a year and a half since
the hunger strike, so a lot of emo
tions ... might have died," said
junior Manuel Bermudez, a resi
dent of Castaho. "We have two new
classes.. . who weren't here for the
hunger strike. ... It became a
rational issue, not as emotional as
it was a year and a half ago."
"We seemed to have a bit of a
general apathy towards the grape
issue," said senior Megan Deßell,
an RAin Lantana. "We didn't
have as much emotion as we
expected. The attendance at the
programs to educate people was
pretty low."
But if not well attended, RAs
thought the education was thor
ough.
"We have done our best to edu
cate the residents," said Castano
RA Hak Chng, a senior. "We put
in our effort to make sure there
was a fair, unbiased presentation
of the facts."
"I think the three dorms have
done the best we could in the

sense of providing programming
and providing opportunities to
residents to educate themselves,"
said senior Christopher Ruiz de
Esparza, an RAin Kimball. "If
people decided they wanted to
serve grapes, I assume they
weighed the evidence."
Still, senior Nicole Vazquez, a
focus assistant in Castaho and a
member of the Council of Presi
dents, called on the University
administration to give more
resources to education on the
issue.
"People saw the issue as being
a pesticide issue, and it was not,"
Vazquez said. "On the basis of the
pesticide issue, people are not
convinced" to boycott grapes.
Use of pesticides, sprayed on
grape crops while people are
working in the fields, was one
reason mentioned in favor of the
boycott.
For some students, however,
any evidence in favor of the boy
cott may not have mattered.
"I didn't vote, so I don't care
that much," said sophomore Kim
ball resident Carter Petty.
"Grapes are good food, and I'm
going to eat some."
Others sympathized with the
idea but took issue with the pro
cess.
"Personally, I would not eat
grapes if it's that big of a deal to
others," said freshman Kimball
resident Joe Pawson. "But I don't
think the dining hall is in a posi
tion to tell other people that they
should not eat grapes."
With the results out, RAs are
unsure what the effects of the
vote will be.
"I'm hoping people won't take
it as a sign that people here are
against the issues that the boy
cott stands for," Deßell said. "A
lot of people voted for a lot of dif
ferent reasons.
"Hopefully, people will respect
that people should be able to feel
how they feel, and it's not an
antagonistic vote in any way
toward students on campus who
care about the issue very much
and brought it to our attention,"
she said.
"I think there are going to be
some people who are going to
react very emotionally to this,"
Ruiz de Esparza said. "It's going
to hit some people pretty harsh
ly."
But "people also have to take a
look at what happened here," he
said. "There were these issues
and residents were made aware of
these issues ... and this is how
they voted. Personally, you may
or may not agree, but you have to
go with what the majority goes
with."
