# Immigrants face financial aid loss
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Amid the general political
rhetoric surrounding the budget
battle in Congress hist week, a specif
ic, real threat has come to light that
would affect a small group of Stan
ford students: legal immigrants who
receive federal financial aid.
A technical change included in
welfare reform legislation passed by
both houses of

Congress last week
could effectively
shut out immi
grants currently
receiving Pell
grants, and it
might push some

over the limit for
subsidized student loans.
"This is a small provision that'i
been largely overlooked in a mucli
larger piece of legislation," said
Terry Hartle, vice president of the
American Council on Education, a
Washington, D.C.-based coalition of
2,000 colleges and universities.
Hartle said it would have "devastat
ing consequences" for individuals.
Immigrants who are not finan

daily independent must have a
sponsor to apply for permanent res
idency, someone who has sufficient
means to keep the immigrant from
relying on federal largess — even if
the sponsor would not truly he will
ing to spend this money.
Currently, federal need-based
scholarship programs do not count
sponsors' income as part of the im
migrant's personal income. But
under the new legislation it would
count — mean-

ing that appli
cants for federal
aid would ap
pear to have far
more financial
resources than
most actually re
ceive from spon-

sors, he said.
The artificial inflation of income
would lessen the number of perma
nent residents who appear to be eli
gible for federal financial aid.
This year, 151 Stanford students
who are permanent residents have
received a total of $275,000 in Pell
grant funds, according to Financial

Aids Officer Cynthia Rife. The
grants, aimed at helping low
income students, go directly to
recipients and do not need to be
repaid.
The bill would simply "cut off
access" for permanent residents,
Hartle said, in part because the
individuals listed as sponsors on
their legal documentation may not
have very close ties to them.
"Everything's pretty much up
for grabs," said Shirley Harris, an
adviser at the Bechtel International
Center, referring specifically to
tighter immigration laws that have
made it harder for dependents of
naturalized citizens to obtain cer
tain legal permits.
Of the 3,436 non-U.S. citizens
enrolled at the University, 842 are
permanent residents of this coun
try, according to Patty McGowan,
director of research for the Regis
trar's Office.
The measure could have a much
larger effect on California's public
schools, according to the Govern
ment Accounting Office. At UC-
Berkeley, for example, legal immi
grants receive $2.9 million a year in
Pell grants, according to the Los
Angeles Times.
The impact of the measure is

clouded by differences between wel
fare reform hills passed by the U.S.
Senate and House of Representa
tives hist week. The Senate version
would be more restrictive, denying
immigrants access to aid 10 years
after they are naturalized, while the
House bill would not affect immi
grants who l>ecome citizens.
The University does not consid
er recently naturalized citizens as a
separate category in enrollment fig
ures, McGowan said.
Also still undecided in Congress
is the amount of reduction in feder
al student loan programs — $4.8
billion in the Senate measure ver
sus $10.8 billion in the House. The
cuts are part of an effort to balance
the federal budget by the year 2002.
The differences between the two
houses' bills remain to be worked
out in committee, and with the
threat of a presidential veto hang
ing over the legislation, it is still too
early to tell the precise impact of
the changes on the University.
The threat of cuts should be of
major concern to Stanford stu
dents, said State University of New
York-Albany graduate student
Kazim Ali, who is serving as vice
president of the United States Stu
dents Association while on leave in
Washington, D.C.
"Students at private schools get
hit the hardest," he said, "because
whether you can get a loan often
means the difference between

whether you get to go to private
school or not."
Hoth houses of Congress would
cap government loans to students
at 20 percent of total lending,
which Ali said would force one
third to half of schools participat
ing in the direct-lending program
to drop out.
Stanford decided not to partici
pate in the program when it began
two years ago, Rife said, because it
would end up costing the Universi
ty more than it was worth. The
University receives good service
from private lenders, she added.
The actual availability of loans
would not be affected by the budget
cuts, Rife said, since federal regula
tion would still make available
loans of up to $5,500 a year at a
guaranteed interest rate. The legis
lation would also limit only the
number of those loans provided
directly by the government.
The House version of next
year's budget would also eliminate
the six-month "grace period" that
reduces interest charges on federal
ly subsidized Stafford loans. The
House bill would also charge
schools 0.85 percent of each loan
given out.
The Senate on Friday eliminat
ed both provisions from its version
of the budget, meaning a difference
of approximately $6 billion will
have to be worked out in commit
tee.
