# A 						credit to Lyman
## Report recommends accrediting changes 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
A new report, co-authored by
former University President
Richard Lyman, advocates in
creased internal review in the uni
versity and college accreditation
process.
Accreditation is intrusive and
inadequate, and it does not succeed
in its goal of making schools ac
countable, Lyman said.
Currently, outside accredita
tion teams, composed of experts
in the education field, visit col
leges and universities every few
years to monitor the quality of
teaching.
However, Lyman said, "Brief
visits cannot judge how depart
ment X is, let alone whole institu
tions.
"In 1988,1 was in charge of the
Yale accreditation," he said. "In
the three-day visit, I never set foot
in the law or medical school."
"Spot checks are all that's possi
ble," Lyman added.
Lyman pointed to another un
wanted consequence of accredita
tion. "They have a lot of power over
you," he said. "A struggling school
could have a lot of problems."
Instead, the report suggests
that accreditation be an internal
process, working on a departmen
tal basis.
After all, Lyman said, "institu
tions understand lx.\st their own
needs and problems."
Lyman said that one such
method could be peer evaluation, in
which teachers would visit each
other's classes on a regular basis.
"Everything doesn't have to
hang on one performance," Lyman
said.
According to the report, outside
agencies would then decide
whether the institutions' review
process was effective.
"Colleges and universities need to
be clear about their mission," Lyman
said. "If deans hick information or a
means of change, it's a bad sign."
The Consort ium on Financing of
Higher Education, the Mellon

Foundation and Columbia Univer
sity commissioned the study of
accreditation last year. The group
selected Lyman; Patricia Graham,
a dean at Harvard; and Martin
Trow, a professor at UC-Berkeley,
to author the report.
Beginning last December, the
three authors conducted their
research by traveling around the
country and talking to professors,
college presidents, regents and
experts.
"We didn't pretend to see a sci
entific cross-section," Lyman said.
"Instead, we spoke to people of par
ticular interest."
The report is part of an ongoing
education debate, which was
brought to a head when Congress
reauthorized the I ligher Education
Act in 1992, Lyman said.
"Congress added some rather
sweeping regulatory clauses which
scared the higher education estab
lishment," Lyman said. "The
Department of Education eventually
simplified the act. Since t hen, accred

itation hay been in a state of flux."
Lyman said the social context of
the debate is important in under
standing the issue.
"In general, there's been a loss
of trust," Lyman said. "Everyone
has to prove themselves.
However, accountability is more
difficult in higher education, Lyman
said. "It's not like manufacturing.
There's no tangible product."
Lyman said he hopes that the
report, which was sent to every col
lege president in the country, will
influence the discussion.
"The debate will never be
resolved permanently, but hopeful
ly the report will show schools how
to improve," Lyman said.
Lyman said schools should re
memlx i r their fundamental purpose.
"The most important issue is the
students. If schools aren't enabling
people to learn, they're not doing the
job," Lyman said.
