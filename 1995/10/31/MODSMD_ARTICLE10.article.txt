## Supreme Court tackling race issues Injust indictments of drug trafficking? 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court tackled a sensitive
racial issue yesterday, agreeing to
decide whether federal prosecutors
must respond to accusations that
they discriminate against blacks in
crack-cocaine cases.
The justices said they will review
rulings that threw out federal indict
ments against five men who had
been charged with trafficking in
crack in the Los Angeles area.
The men said they were chosen
for federal prosecution because they
are black, and federal prosecutors
initially refused to rebut the allega
tions.
The issue for the nation's highest
court is not whether racially biased
prosecution took place, but whether
lower courts wrongly required the
federal government to combat the
selective-prosecution allegations.
A decision is expected by July.
The dispute involves race and eco
nomic class, as does the national
debate over the federal policy of pun
ishing crack-cocaine offenders much
more harshly than those caught with
the powdered variety of the drug.
Crack, or cocaine base, is known
as an inner-city drug, and cocaine
powder is used more often in the
suburbs.
In the crack-cocaine case,
Christopher Armstrong, Aaron
Hampton, Freddie Mack, Shelton
Martin and Robert Rozelle were
charged in 1992 with participating in
a drug ring.
The charges stemmed from a
joint investigation by Inglewood,
Calif., police mid federal drug agents.
The decision to charge the five
men with federal, rather than state,
crimes was significant. Federal law
imposes a minimum sentence of 10
years and a maximum of life for those
convicted of selling more than 50

grams of crack. Under California law,
however, the sentence for that crime
ranges from three to five years.
To support their racial-bias claim,
the five defendants pointed to a
study of every crack prosecution
closed by the local federal public
defendant's office in 1991. In all 24
such cases, the defendants were
black.
"What we have here is institu
tional racism," said Los Angeles
lawyer David Dudley, who repre
sents one of the five men whose
indictments were dismissed. "The
fact of the matter is they (federal
prosecutors) are going after black
people."
Although the popular view is that
crack is mostly an inner-city drug,
Dudley said in a telephone interview
yesterday,"The majority of people
who sell crack cocaine are white,
there can be no doubt. Two-thirds of
the users are whites, and white kids
who buy crack aren't going to the
ghetto to buy it. Other white kids are
selling it to them."
A federal judge, nding in favor of
the defendants, ordered prosecutors
to provide further racial data and to
explain how they chose which crack
cases to pursue in federal court.
The government chose not to
comply with that order, and instead
appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. The appeals court
upheld the judge's order mid subse
quent dismissal of the indictments
against the five men.
The 9th Circuit court ruled that
the defendants had presented facts
"which establish a colorable basis to
believe that the government has
engaged in selective prosecution."
Only expert, testimony about the
prosecution's decision-making and
motivation could rebut that, the
appeals court said.
