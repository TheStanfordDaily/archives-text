# Quebec votes no by only 1 percent

MONTREAL (AP) — By a perilously
narrow margin, Quebeckers heeded pleas
for national unity and voted against seces
sion yesterday, sparing Canada a traumatic
fracture but leaving the French-speaking
province split down the middle.
Losing by only 1 percent of the vote, the
separatists quickly and defiantly vowed to
try again for independence.
"To see it escape our grasp is hard to
bear," said the separatists' charismatic
leader, Lucien Bouchard. "Let's keep the
faith, because the next time will be the right
time. And the next time could come quicker
than you think."
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, in a tele
vised address, appealed for reconcilation
and asked separatist leaders to work with
him in pursuing political change.
"We have every reason to be proud of a
democracy where citizens can peacefully
debate the very existence of their country,"
he said. "The time has come for us to work
together ... to turn a new page."
Final returns from 22,400 polling sta
tions showed the federalists won 50.6 per
cent to 49.4 percent —• a 50,000-vote mar
gin out of 4.65 million cast.
About 82 percent of Quebeckers are
French-speaking, and roughly 60 percent of
them voted for separation. As expected,
more than nine in 10 of English-speaking
and immigrant Quebeckers voted No.
Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau, turn
ing bitter in his speech at the losing head
quarters, blamed the defeat on "money and
the ethnic vote."
He was referring to big business, which
favored the federalists, and to Quebec's
non-francophones — many of them immi
grants — who overwhelming voted to stay
in Canada. Federalist leaders accused
Parizeau of demogoguery, saying his com
ments would stir up ethnic tensions.
Federalists celebrated raucously at their
headquarters, waving Canada's maple leaf
flag amid a flurry of balloons. Not all was
civil: Hundreds of Yes and No supporters
taunted one another in downtown Montre
al, and a dozen came to blows after the
results were announced.
Other separatist campaigners — who came
closer than many had dreamed a few months
ago — wept on each other's shoulders. But
they came to life, cheering proudly, when
Bouchard congratulated them for improving
so dramatically from a 60-40 percent defeat in

a 1980 independence referendum.
"We roll up our sleeves and we try
again," said Parizeau. "We won't wait 15
years this time. ... We want our country,
and we will get it."
Even if another referendum is not immi
nent, there will be immediate calls for con

stitutional reform.
"Canada on paper may still be a country
— but there's something wrong with this
country," said Louise Beaudoin, culture
minister in Quebec's separatist govern
ment. "We had 9 percent more than we had
in 1980 — something has to be done."
