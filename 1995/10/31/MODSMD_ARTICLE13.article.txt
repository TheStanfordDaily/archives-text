## Vote no on ban 
### 
Allowing groups to dictate
ultimatums sets precarious
precedent for the University

AFTER MONTHS OF negoti
ations, meetings and educa
tion, the first vote on the
grape boycott has come in — one
in favor of serving grapes.
In a 90-82 election, with 20
abstentions and more than 200
people who did not vote, Manzanita
residents chose Sunday night not to
boycott grapes. One vote cannot
necessarily be treated as a
harbinger of things to come, but
the message that comes through,
both from students who voted no
and from those who chose not to
participate at all, is that students
are sick and tired of hearing about
this issue.
As well they should be. The grape
vote is a waste of University
resources and of students' time. It's
a special-interest agenda item which
has no real place in the University
and students are wise to reject the
boycott for this reason alone.
More importantly, the vote sets a
dangerous precedent — letting
small groups of people who use the
politics of ultimatum dictate which
decisions this community will
make.
Diversity is revered here at Stan
ford. But it seems ironic that those
groups who call most loudly for
multicultural tolerance in this case
have dictated what the rest of the
campus must consider to be a wor
thy political issue.
Students here should never be
forced to take a political stand just
because someone else has delivered
an ultimatum, which is exactly
what this vote asks them to do. It is
no surprise that so many people
chose not to vote in Manzanita —
most students simply don't care.
They should not be forced to care.
This vote never had to happen.
Even the educational materials dis

tributed to students didn't address
whether the boycott would have
the effect its proponents claimed it
would — helping improve the
labor conditions of farm workers.
Focusing on symbolic gestures,
practical solutions weren't even con
sidered. One solution would be to
purchase organic grapes. Stanford
organizations could also serve
imported grapes. During the hunger
strike, a study showed that the
majority of grapes served at Stan
ford actually come from Chile, not
California, a fact that has been
almost completely overlooked in this
whole debate.
As one Castano resident put it,
once this issue lost its emotional
charge, it became "a rational issue."
Emotion should never be discount
ed, but it should not affect policy
except when it is tempered with rea
son. Who will try to get their agenda
across next? The effect of pesticides
on farm workers is only one exam
ple of human-rights violations.
There are children working as
slaves in Colombia, for example. Is a
mandated vote on a boycott of
Colombian coffee at the Coffee
House on the horizon?
The proponents of the grape
boycott have attempted to turn
what should have been a reason
able, debatable issue into a symbol
ic test of unnecessary divisiveness:
Are you a moral human being who
wants to protect poor farm work
ers, or by your vote, will you dis
miss the importance of the whole
problem? But a debate over some
thing to be decided under majority
rule should never be couched in
those terms. After all, if your Cul
tures, Ideas and Values class
taught you anything, it should be
that you can't necessarily pick
whose morals are right and whose
are wrong.
If you haven't already, vote no on
the grape boycott. There's nothing
wrong with wanting to protect
farmworkers— feel free to make a
personal choice not to eat grapes.
But the vote should not be forced.
Forcing students to this decision is
a moral violation in and of itself.
