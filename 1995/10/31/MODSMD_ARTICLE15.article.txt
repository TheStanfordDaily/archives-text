## The
						predicament of a pre-law 
### 
TO GET INTO law school, you only
need three things: grades, an LSAT
score and a few recommendations.
Which law schools you get into depend
mostly on the caliber of those three criteria.
But when I compare the criteria for
applying and getting into law school with
the criteria for applying and getting into
medical school, I, being pre-law feel pretty
damn lucky. Just to be considered by a
medical school, you need six courses in
chemistry, three courses in biology, five
courses in physics and one course in calcu
lus. On top of that, you also need to take the
vicious MCAT. Furthermore, if you want to
be competitive with a lot of Stanford pre
meds, you'll want to have worked in a labo
ratory for about 12 years.
I see pre-meds all around me working
their asses off to be competitive in the med
school admissions arena. I, on the other
hand, have only done one task oriented to
law school admissions in the past two years
â€” I went to the Bookstore and bought two
LSAT books. Right now, they're sitting in
my room at the bottom of a pile of other
books. Their pages have never seen the
light of day.
That strikes me as odd, because I know
that the LSAT is important. Yet, if I spend
just a fifth of the time pre-meds spend on
their admissions-related work studying for
the LSAT, I would probably do well enough
to get into any law school I wanted to.

And so, with this realization, with this
juxtaposition of my potential and my lack of
interest in achieving that potential, I am
faced with two questions:
Do I really want to go to law school?
Do I really want to be a lawyer?
Ask a law school student how they're
enjoying law school and, chances are, you
won't get responses like, "Oh, it's great! I
love law school!" or "Law school is the
best! I'm having a wonderful time!" I'm
not naive to the point where I think I
would actually enjoy law school. The pro
fessors, the pressure, the work and the
100 other neurotic lawyer wannabes in
your class won't add up to an enjoyable
experience, regardless of how you do the
math.
This is the point in my analysis where
we pre-lawyers can be jealous of p re-doc
tors. Sure, compared to law school, med
school might take twice as long to finish,
but once you're a doctor, your whole life is
set. I wouldn't mind a cushy, 9-to-5, four
day-a-week job at 100 grand per year. But
new lawyers are a dime a dozen. As a new
associate in some monstrously big law
firm, you're expected to put in 60 hours a
week of mind-grating, glued-to-your-desk
work.
Whereas med students are working like
hell now for a better life when they finish,
law students are working like hell now for
the honor of working like hell for the rest of

their lives.
Of course, there's always the vague hope
that, eventually, after working as inden
tured servants for a few decades, we pre
lawyers can be a rich partner in a firm, or a
municipal court judge, or a wealthy Senator
or a Supreme Court justice.
What would be ideal for me would be a
"judge school." People who want to argue
and bitch and haggle ovsr legal jargon and
big money can go to law school. People who
want to decide points of law while sitting in
a big leather swivel chair and having every
one call you "your honor" can go to judge
school. And why not? As if being a lawyer
prepares you for being a judge. I could have
out-judged Ito in my sleep.
Of course, when you look at law school
strictly as a financial investment, it's a deal
you'll fmd hard to beat. Three years for a
base salary of $80,000? It's the only way
you'll pay off your college loans in this mil
lennium.
But then, money isn't everything.
Would a new Mercedes be able to fill the
gaping hole in my life dug out by a brutal
law school and a slave-driving law firm?
Probably not.

Mr. Small has another year left before heed
ing the cattle call of law school admissions.
