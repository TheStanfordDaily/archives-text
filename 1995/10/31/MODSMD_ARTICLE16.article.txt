Students of SAGE tru to counter feeling of apathu

WE ARE WRITING this letter in
response to last week's editorial
by The Stanford Daily on stu
dent activism on campus. We commend
the efforts of the new activist groups and
want to remind Stanford students that
activism on campus is far from dead!
We are members of Students Against
Genocide, a very active and exciting
group founded in the summer of 1993.
We have been active throughout in
humanitarian relief, political action and
educating the public about the ongoing
war and systematic atrocities perpetrat
ed by Serb-nationalist fanatics in Bosnia
SAGE stands for a whole, democratic
Bosnia where everyone has the same
rights regardless of what religion they
follow or where their parents came from.

We're also working to support human
rights throughout the former Yugoslavia
and beyond. We meet every Thursday at
8 p.m. in the Fire Truck House.
This Thursday, we are having a
demonstration in White Plaza at noon to
protest Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic's arrival in the United States
while his enforcers continue spitting in
the face of the peace process by murder
ing non-Serb men and boys in Banja
Luka. The atrocities reported by the
refugees in the past two weeks have
been identical to those documented in
the months since the Srebrenica mas
sacre. A detailed report of this appeared
in last Sunday's New York Times and
the San Jose Mercury News.
The very architect of the continuing

slaughter is arriving in the U.S. to try to
negotiate the largest amount of territory
he can get out of his aggression. We rec
ommend calling the White House Com
ment Line at (202) 456-1111 to let the
President know how outraged you are at
our government's inaction while Milose
vic's thugs continue killing civilians dur
ing the cease-fire.
How can SAGE help you turn your
concern about Bosnia into action? There
are many ongoing programs where fresh
faces are always very welcome. You can
tutor Bosnian refugees in English (no
special experience required) or help us
organize and send medical supplies and
warm clothes to Bosnia (both are critical
ly important to civilian victims of siege
during the long winter, when gas may be

cut off at any time). You can help to plan
and carry out educational activities on
campus to raise awareness about Bosnia,
such as bringing Bernard-Henry Levy's
film, "Bosna!," to Stanford later this
month. You can even go to Croatia to
work with young children who are vic
tims of ethnic cleansing, having lost their
homes or even their parents to the war.
And, of course, you can write letters to
the President, Senators and Representa
tives to keep them aware of your outrage
at the continuing genocide.
Student activism is not dead at Stan
ford!
