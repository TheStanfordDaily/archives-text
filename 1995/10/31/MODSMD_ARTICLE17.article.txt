# Student says he was misinformed by the varsity ticket office
## 
### 
Last week, I called the varsity ticket
office and asked about buying a Big
Game ticket. Like any financially aware
student, I wanted to know how to get a
ticket to the game with the smallest dent
in my pocket possible.
The gentleman I spoke to carried on
proudly about how the season tickets
were prorated — the price was reduced
by $8 afler each home game. I asked
how much the season ticket would cost if
I bought it before the Oregon State
game last Saturday. Twenty-five dollars
was his response. I thought for a second
and asked, "So after the Oregon game,
the tickets will cost $17, right?" The
gentleman then explained to me that, in
fact, they would cost only $17 after the
Oregon State game had passed, assum
ing the tickets were not all sold out.
"Come in Monday morning and you'll
get the prorated price," he said.

So I headed over to Stanford Stadium
yesterday morning in hopes of securing
a ticket at $17. When I asked if any Big
Game tickets were left, the ticket sales
person told me that there were, but that
they would cost $35. I didn't believe
what I heard, so I asked again. "Thirty
five dollars," the man replied.
I explained to the salesperson that I
had called the ticket office the previous
week to ask about prices. I also explained
that I was told the tickets would be $17.
He replied, "Oh no, that's the price for
the Oregon State game and Big Game.
Big Game alone is $35." I asked why one
could buy a ticket to two games for $25
and one game for $35. He said that he
was sorry, but if I wanted a Big Game
ticket now, the price was $35.
Although I do not understand its poli
cy on ticket prices, I do not have a prob
lem with the ticket office because of it. If
the price of a ticket raises over the week
end from $25 to $35, that's the office's
prerogative. I do hope, at least, that the
ticket office would tell me this, rather
than giving me misinformation.
