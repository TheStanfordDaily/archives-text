# Retirement project managers issue clarification to article
## 
### 
Thank you for your Oct. 27 article
regarding changes to the University's
retirement which were announced by
the Faculty Senate on Oct. 26. I appreci
ate your interest in getting information
out to campus, but one very important
item needs clarification.
The bottom line is that the changes
made are positive for Stanford's work
force. I am not sure that the message
came through.
The major retirement plan change
happening Jan. 1, 1997 is that non
exempt employees who are not represent
ed by a bargaining unit will have access to
the retirement plan currently available to
faculty and exempt staff — the Stanford
Contributory Retirement Plan (SCRP).
The plan currently in place for non
exempt staff and many retirees — the
Stanford Staff Retirement Annuity Plan
(SRAP) — is not being discontinued. Non

exempt staff who move to SCRP will
retain the benefit they have earned in
SRAP as of Dec. 31,1996 but will be able
to begin getting University contributions
to SCRP and to contribute to SCRP begin
ning in 1997. Eligible non-exempt staff
above a certain age — to be determined by
actuaries — will have the choice of staying
in SRAP and continuing accruals in that
plan or moving to SCRP.
The Office of Total Compensation will
be sending employees more detailed
information on this transition in the
coming months. Later this month,
employees will receive a letter from Bar
bara Butterfield, Vice President of Fac
ulty and Staff Services, with more infor
mation about the changes as well as a
detailed time line of when these changes
are planned to take effect.
