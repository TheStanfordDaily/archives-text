# Book battle takes on mythic proportions

A debate over multiculturalism that
began with a book by two former Stan
ford students has grown thanks to a sec
ond book from a student's perspective,
authored by John Wilson and entitled
"The Myth of Political Correctness."
Stanford graduates David Sacks and
Peter Thiel described recent changes to

the University curriculum in their book,
"The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism
and the Politics of Intolerance at Stan
ford." The co-authors charged that "po
litically correct" changes attempted to
suppress campus debate and eliminate
consideration of Western culture from
students' core course work.
Wilson, a graduate student at the
University of Chicago, argues in his

soon-to-be-published book that such ar
guments really represent an "invented
crisis of political correctness."
Wilson examined the debate over
multiculturalism at several college aim
puses, including Stanford, focusing on
the question of whether there is a "left
ist domination of academia."
He traced the debate at Stanford
from the introduction of the Cultures,

Ideas and Values curriculum in 1989 all
the way to Sacks and Thiel's book.
Wilson said that during the CIV de
bates "a great deal of misinformation
was fed to the public." He found that the
University offers plenty of courses on
traditional topics and that multicultur
alism did not dominate the agenda.
alism did not dominate the agen
da.
Using research and personal
perspective from both his gradu
ate and undergraduate years, Wil
son examined what he feels have
been attempts by a conservative
minority to suppress multicultur
al ism.
Wilson, who spent his under
graduate years at the University of
Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, said
he wrote "The Myth of Political
Correctness" in an attempt to
bring "some balance back to the
debate." Wilson said that he want
ed to address the "sheer hypocrisy"
of multiculturalism critics.
"Those who condemned uni
versities as leftist totalitarians
nevef Â£ ud anything about the
suppression of other issues," he
said, citing race and gender in
particular. Despite recent

changes, such issues are still
excluded from many college
courses, he added.
Debate over the issue of multi
culturalism has stretched from
discussion on campus of "The
Diversity Myth" to the pages of
The Wall Street Journal. Sacks
and Thiel wrote an op-ed piece
detailing their arguments against
Stanford's CIV curriculum that
appeared earlier this month.
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice wrote an angry letter to The
Journal in response, calling the
piece "a cartoon, not a depiction of
[Stanford's] freshman curricu
lum."
Wilson said he sees his book as
part of an ongoing discussion
about the role of multiculturalism
on college campuses.
Recently, Wilson debated Thiel
at an "Accuracy in Academia" con
ference in Washington, D.C. Wil
son said he hopes to spread these
debates to other college campuses
nationwide.
