# Book battle takes on mythic proportions

A debate over multiculturalism that
began with a book by two former Stan
ford students has grown thanks to a sec
ond book from a student's perspective,
authored by John Wilson and entitled
"The Myth of Political Correctness."
Stanford graduates David Sacks and
Peter Thiel described recent changes to

the University curriculum in their book,
"The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism
and the Politics of Intolerance at Stan
ford." The co-authors charged that "po
litically correct" changes attempted to
suppress campus debate and eliminate
consideration of Western culture from
students' core course work.
Wilson, a graduate student at the
University of Chicago, argues in his

soon-to-be-published book that such ar
guments really represent an "invented
crisis of political correctness."
Wilson examined the debate over
multiculturalism at several college aim
puses, including Stanford, focusing on
the question of whether there is a "left
ist domination of academia."
He traced the debate at Stanford
from the introduction of the Cultures,

Ideas and Values curriculum in 1989 all
the way to Sacks and Thiel's book.
Wilson said that during the CIV de
bates "a great deal of misinformation
was fed to the public." He found that the
University offers plenty of courses on
traditional topics and that multicultur
alism did not dominate the agenda.
