## A
						brief history of Quebec's secessionist movement 
### 
Identity. Humiliation. Pride. These are the essence
of the Quebec secessionist movement â€” they are its
engine and its fuel. From afar, it is easy to dismiss
the idea of Quebec's independence as frivolous or even
ridiculous. The thought of Canada's second largest
province deciding to bail out of confederation has
always prompted scorn and disbelief. But as the refer
endum campaign has shown, the idea is real and its
proponents numerous. So what drives the Quebec
secessionist movement?
Identity
The French-speaking majority in Quebec defines
itself as a nation, a society bound together by a common
language and culture. This non-political definition of a
nation is most fitting for the French-speaking Quebe
cois and lends a true sense of identity to many mem
bers of Quebec society.
The grassroots secessionist movement believes that
political nationhood is the natural next step for the
French-speaking Quebec nation. There is a strong
belief among this movement that the survival of the
French language and culture in North America
depends on the emergence of a truly French-speaking
state ... Quebec. Quebec within a bilingual Canada is
then viewed as a means of diluting the French language
and a hindrance to the French-speaking nation.
Humiliation
The first breakthrough for the Quebec secessionist
movement came out of the Parti Quebecois (PQ) elec
tion victory in 1976. The PQ ran on a platform which
outlined steps for the achievement of political autono
my for the province. Rene Levesque, the PQ's charis
matic leader, organized a referendum in 1980 to deter
mine whether the Quebecois population wanted his
government to pursue negotiations with the federal
government for political autonomy within Canada, so
called "sovereign ty-association."
The referendum was defeated by a 60-40 percent
margin with promises of constitutional change by
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a
Quebecois who believed in a strong federal govern
ment. Constitutional change did occur, but not in the
way which was envisioned by most Quebecois.
The battle of wills and ideology between Levesque

and Trudeau came to such an impasse that Trudeau
made a decision which still resonates in the minds of
many Quebecois. The Canadian Constitution was repa
triated without the Quebec government's approval.
This event is often regarded as a severe humiliation for
Quebec. To this day, Quebec has not signed the Consti
tution Act of 1982.
Since then, several attempts have been made to get
Quebec to sign the Constitution Act. The Meech Lake
Accord, signed in the late 1980s by the federal govern
ment and sill provincial premiers, was designed to yield
to some of Quebec's historical demands. These
demands include the now famous "distinct society"
clause, which would have legally acknowledged Que
bec's distinctiveness within the Canadian family.
The Meech Lake Accord eventually failed, leaving
Quebecois with the feeling that they might never feel at
home in a federation that could not accept them.
Another attempt at constitutional change failed in
199*2 with the Charlottetown Accord, which was voted
down in a national referendum.
In sum, the last few decades of attempted constitu
tional changes has left many Quebecois feeling unwel
come in the Canadian federation. Many Quebecois
have voted 'oui' purely in the belief that the situation is
a lost cause; that they have been humiliated and
ignored too often; that they will never be understood.
Pride
Quebec has only recently come out of its Quiet Rev
olution, a period in the 1950s and 1960s from which
the province emerged as a modern society. Its past was
dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, endowed
with considerable power by the 18th century British
colonials. Only in this century did Quebecois rid them
selves of an overpowering religious establishment.
Another remnant of the British colonial past, the
powerful and rich English-speaking upper class, made
things very difficult in the 19605. The economic stran
glehold of English-speakers over the poorer citizens of
Quebec (mostly French-speaking) was overwhelming.
The Quebec government became an element of
strong pride as it began to exercise economic clout
in the early 19705. The election of the PQ in 1976
and the subsequent passing of Bill 101 (which
attempted to establish French as the language of
business in Quebec) were seen as great strides in

the emergence of the Quebecois. This pride contin
ues today on many levels and has helped Quebec
form a strong economic base. Some still see Canada
as the remaining shackles which must be removed
for Quebec to realize its full potential, both econom
ically and politically.
Through these past years, the Quebecois have
remained an enigma to other Canadians and even to
themselves. It is often said that Quebec wishes for an
independent Quebec within a strong and united Cana

da. This would seem like a valid interpretation, but it's
an ultimately impossible goal.
Throughout the years, Quebec has sent so many
contradictory messages that it has successfully woven a
political web of which it is now a victim. As much as
ever, the results of the Quebec referendum will cast
doubt on the political future of Quebec and Canada...
which if anything, is as Canadian as it gets.
