# The 						importance of the vote
## 
### 
By the time you read this,
the results of the most sig
nificant event in recent
Canadian history will be in. The
people of Quebec have decided
whether or not to pursue inde
pendence.
As a Canadian myself, I believe
the ramifications of this vote are
immediate: the possibility of a
new North American nation; the
Canadian identity gutted; the
Cree and Inuit, who have claim
over much of Quebec, refusing to
go; and the overnight disappear
ance of the legitimacy of our cur
rency, our prime minister and
much of our cabinet (representa
tives from Quebec).
Canada has been trying to get
itself together since the establish
ment of New France in 1663.
When the British took over a cen
tury later, they recognized civil
law and Catholicism as elements
of a distinct French society in
order to buy loyalty.
Canada was confederated in
1867. Our union was a highly

centralized one â€” the United
States had just suffered a civil
war under a loose federalism and
we were wary of demobilized
American troops and raids on our
border. This centralism is at the
root of our inability to settle on a
lasting national arrangement.
In the 19505, colonial differ
ences re-emerged as class differ
ences: Anglophone capital domi
nated Francophone labor in Que
bec. Soon, this became a full
blown ethnic conflict, but it only
regained political legitimacy with
the election of separatists to Que
bec's assembly in 1976.
Every attempt since then to
resolve this question has been
sullied by representative politics.
The Constitution of 1982 was
forced on Quebec by the
supreme court, but never accept
ed by that province. In 1987, an
agreement on constitutional
change was abandoned after
three years of debate. More
recently, Brian Mulroney called
a national referendum on an

agreement which had' been
signed. He lost and. Canada
stumbled on, visionless. '
These failures have tainted
government in Canada. In Cana
da, the most common political
expression has become the .'out
right rejection of politics.
Emblematic of this discontent,
the people of Quebec decided
whether or not to act before <
deciding how they would act.
Yesterday's vote is a culmina
tion of frustrations as old as
Canada itself. It is ironic that the
greatest act of democratic, liberal
federalism in Canada might have
been to dismantle itself. Whatev
er the result, it is a tribute that
such divisions have persisted
without exploding into the vio
lence that has cost some coun
tries far more than their identi
ties.
