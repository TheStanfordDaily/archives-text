# Water treatment research awarded

A Stanford professor and student last week
received one of two major awards given out
annually by the American Society of Civil Engi
neers.
Civil Engineering Prof. Perry McCarty and
environmental engineering and science gradu
ate student James Anderson will share the J.
James R. Croes Medal for their work in finding
a method of reducing the amount of chlorinated
solvents in groundwater.
"It was kind of a surprise," Anderson said of
winning the award for the paper he co-authored
with his adviser, McCarty.
Both were excited to share the award, which
they accepted at a ceremony held last Wednes
day in San Diego.
"It was a pleasure to be able to share it with
my adviser, who's very well known in his field,"
Anderson said.
"It's very nice as a professor to receive an
award along with your student who did the hard
work and the thinking associated with it,"
McCarty said.

The award is given each year to the authors of
a research paper, in this case a paper on "A Model
for Treatment of Trichloroethylene by Methan
otrophic Biofilms" that appeared in the society's
Journal of Environmental Engineering in 1994.
The paper was the culmination of several
years of work, which continues today, in reduc
ing cleanup costs for contaminated groundwa
ter, McCarty said.
"We have a major effort underway in the
Western Region Hazardous Substance Research
Center to learn of new ways to degrade chlori
nated solvents, which are a major contaminant
of ground water in the country," McCarty
explained.
"One of the methods is through use of bacte
ria that have enzymes that degrade chlorinated
solvents .. . through a process called
cometabolism," he said.
In the process, methane-eating methan
otrophs break down the pollutants in water,
Anderson said.
The problem he set out to solve was to model
the process.
"In a lot of processes, the methanotrophs are
present as films rather than just dispersed in

liquid," Anderson said. "That makes things a lit
tle more complicated in terms of modeling. So I
went about trying to model that situation."
Now, McCarty said, a team of professors, stu
dents and stafT from Stanford are working on a
"full-scale demonstration of the process at
Edwards Air Force Base in southern Califor
nia."
McCarty leads an interdisciplinary team in
chemistry, microbiology, hydrology and engi
neering at the hazardous substance research
center.
Anderson, who has a bachelor's degree in
civil engineering and a master's degree in envi
ronmental engineering and science both from
Stanford, has been working with McCarty since
he began graduate work in 1990.
"He's the greatest," Anderson said of his
adviser. "I owe a lot to him."
What makes the relationship between
McCarty and his students work is an atmo
sphere of mutual trust, Anderson said.
"He's an excellent mentor, and he allows a lot
of freedom," Anderson said. "He trusts the stu
dents working for him enough to let them follow
their own direction."
