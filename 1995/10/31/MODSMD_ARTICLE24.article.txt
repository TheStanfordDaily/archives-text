with even more positive points,
giving the Cherubs — as the
Cardinal players like to call

The Cardinal won two of its
three contests. In its first match

Plus, there was some carry-over
from the previous day's game
that we still had to deal with."
The two somewhat lackluster
performances did not bode well
for the Cardinal, a team which
must focus on the upcoming
