Stanford women's field hock

Pacific Conference) entered last
weekend's Midwest Field Hock
ey Tournament in St. Louis, Mo.
with a positive attitude and
came out of the competition
with even more positive points,
giving the Cherubs — as the
Cardinal players like to call
themselves — the wings needed
to swoop into tomorrow's Nor-
Pac championship game against
Cal and on to the NCAA Tour
nament Nov. 9.
The Cardinal won two of its
three contests. In its first match
against St. Louis, Stanford
managed to emerge with a 2-0
victory despite a siege of prob
lems. Incongruous officiating,
unorthodox plays and unfamil
iar competition flustered the
Cardinal. In addition, even
halfway across the continent,
the Cherubs could not entirely
escape the mundane pressures
of academia and midterm stress.

The best they could do was cope.
"It was not our best game,"
said senior captain Elise Mor
gan.
Solid performances by several
players turned the obstacles into
a win, however. Junior midfield
er Amy Marfil scored both of
Stanford's goals on assists from
freshmen Sarah Medeiros and
Monique Leroux. Defensively,
sophomore goalkeeper Kelly
Naylor demonstrated the amaz
ing control that both teammates
and opponents have come to
appreciate and respect, posting
yet another shutout.
The only goal Naylor allowed
came in game two against
Southwest Missouri. Unfortu
nately, it was the only goal of the
game, and Stanford lost 1-0.
"We were frustrated by the

different shots,

[opponents'l physical style of
play at the beginning," Morgan
said. "We let it frustrate us.
Plus, there was some carry-over
from the previous day's game
that we still had to deal with."
The two somewhat lackluster
performances did not bode well
for the Cardinal, a team which
must focus on the upcoming
NCAA playoff's. Stanford beat Cal
last Tuesday to qualify for
NCAAs. The team used last week
end's games as preparation for
the battles ahead.
"(The Midwest Field Hockey
Tournament] gave us a chance to
face a variety of very competitive
and more physical teams — and
some rare officiating," Naylor
said. "Hopefully, this will prepare
us for NCAAs."
Some of the preparation came
in the form of Astroturf, on which
all of Stanford's future NCAA
opponents play. At home, the Car
dinal plays on real grass, which is
a much slower surface. Even in a
loss, the Cherubs gained valuable
experience on turf, getting accus
tomed to the speed of the ball and
practicing passes, positioning and
timing.
Turf speed proved to be an
essential factor in Stanford's final
game of the tournament, a 2-0
victory over Davis and Elkins.
Ironically, it was one of the grass
grown Cardinal players,
Medeiros, who flew over the

Astroturf to score the game's only
goals. Having adjusted to both the
physical play and the speed on
turf, Stanford emerged from the
tournament an improved team.
"We really connected [against
Davis and Elkins,]" Naylor said.
But nobody connected against
her. Naylor's tournament perfor
mance was nothing short of stel
lar. By the end of the tournament,
her two shutouts would earn her
All-Tournament honors. Naylor,
humble as usual, elected not to
focus on her individual perfor
mance, choosing instead to talk
about Stanford's tournament
attitude as the NCAA playoffs
draw near.
"These were really challenging
games," she said. "We faced a lot
of different shots, like we might
see in the NCAAs."
The team as a whole can walk
away from the three games know
ing it can beat an aggressive,
physical opponent on a fast sur
face. This knowledge and confi
dence is worth gold in NCAA play.
Now, with their sights set on
NCAAs, the Cherubs are home
tomorrow, looking to bowl Cal
over with the newfound speed and
physical competitiveness attained
on last weekend's sojourn to the
