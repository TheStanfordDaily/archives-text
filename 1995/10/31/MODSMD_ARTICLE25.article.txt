# Men's crew shows signs of improvement
## Cardinal rowers finish second to California at Head of the Estuary 
### Laura Drum Contributing writer 
"Be patient. Work hard and be patient."
That is the message Stanford crew coach
Wieslaw Kujda wants to send to his team at
this point in the season. The men's varsity
crew team rowed in the Head of the Estuary
at Oakland last Sunday and placed second
and fourth in the regatta, which disappoint
ed some of the rowers who hoped to take

first place from No. 4 California, Stanford's
main competitor in the race. The Cardinal's
first boat finished in 18 minutes, two sec
onds, while Cal's winning boat completed
the course in 17: 47.
The 15-second difference, although
greater than the Cardinal would have liked,
showed an improvement over Stanford's fin
ish at the Head of the Charles two weeks
ago. The relatively straight course at the
Oakland Estuary amounted to approximate

ly six kilometers, requiring a racing time of
around 18 minutes. Boats began 10 seconds
apart.
In the first half of the competition, Stan
ford out-performed Cal. At the halfway
mark, the Cardinal led the Bears by a couple
of seconds. This impressive performance,
although not sustained, demonstrated the
extent of Stanford's rowing capabilities.

After a solid performance at the Head of the Estuary, Stanford crew appears to be headed in the right direction.
"There was a lot of excitement,
and there was a lot of aggression,"
said senior coxswain Eva Kim of
the race.
In the second half, the Cardi

nal lost some of its early speed,
while the Bears rowing held
strong, pulling them into the lead.
"We were moving in the begin
ning, and then they started to pull
away a bit," Kim said.
The fact that Stanford fell
behind in the second half of the
race speaks more to the Cardi
nal's still-developing aerobic abili

ties and Cal's strong showing
than to any inability to row. With
only four weeks of aerobic train
ing, Stanford continues to
improve its aerobics, while Cal
has trained for twice as long. The
length of the race accentuated
this difference.
Considering Cal's lofty nation
al ranking, the close finishes in

the regatta place Stanford in com
petition with the best crew teams
in the country. Now, only training
and patience can lead the Cardi
nal to victory. Kujda feels his
team will improve most by devel
oping aerobieally and by learning
from each race instead of becom
ing frustrated.
"The importance now isn't if

we win or lose, but how much we
close the gap," Kujda said. The
gap closed a little more in the
Head of the Estuary, as Stanford
improved from its previous con
frontation against the Bears.
The Estuary race speaks high
ly of the Cardinal. In comparison
to this juncture in the season last
year, the team's performance

indicates great potential.
"I feel like we're definitely
ahead of where we were last
year," said junior rower lan
Rhodes.
Senior rower Rob Bigler con
curred. "I think we improved
quite a bit over last year," he said,
"and we're looking forward to
spring season."
"Be patient. Work hard and be patient."
