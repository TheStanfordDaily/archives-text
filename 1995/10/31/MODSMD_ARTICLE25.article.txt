# Men's crew shows signs of improvement
## Cardinal rowers finish second to California at Head of the Estuary

"Be patient. Work hard and be patient."
That is the message Stanford crew coach
Wieslaw Kujda wants to send to his team at
this point in the season. The men's varsity
crew team rowed in the Head of the Estuary
at Oakland last Sunday and placed second
and fourth in the regatta, which disappoint
ed some of the rowers who hoped to take

first place from No. 4 California, Stanford's
main competitor in the race. The Cardinal's
first boat finished in 18 minutes, two sec
onds, while Cal's winning boat completed
the course in 17: 47.
The 15-second difference, although
greater than the Cardinal would have liked,
showed an improvement over Stanford's fin
ish at the Head of the Charles two weeks
ago. The relatively straight course at the
Oakland Estuary amounted to approximate

ly six kilometers, requiring a racing time of
around 18 minutes. Boats began 10 seconds
apart.
In the first half of the competition, Stan
ford out-performed Cal. At the halfway
mark, the Cardinal led the Bears by a couple
of seconds. This impressive performance,
although not sustained, demonstrated the
extent of Stanford's rowing capabilities.
