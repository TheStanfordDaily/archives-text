# Sailor Zimbaldi earns trip to Nationals
## Sophomore standout cruises to second-place finish at district qualifier 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
The five members of the Stan
ford sailing team who went down
to Santa Cruz last weekend to
compete in a qualifying regatta
for the Singlehanded Nationals
returned triumphantly. Against
tough rivals like USC, California
and Hawaii, the Cardinal man

aged to place three sailors in the
top five.
Sophomore Danny Zimbaldi
earned himself a ticket to the Sin
glehanded Nationals in Mobile,
Ala. on Nov. 17 with a second
place performance. Only the top
two finishers qualify to sail in the
Singlehanded Nationals. The two
other Cardinal top-five finishers
were sophomore John Meade and

senior Adam Lowry.
USC's Mike Uznis walked
away with first place, cruising so
far ahead of any other boat that
even with a last-place outing in
the final contest, he would have
remained untouchable.
On the other hand, Zimbaldi
and Hawaii's Pat Whitmarsh
fought each other throughout the
qualifier for second place. Both

sailed with equal competence and
dexterity, continuing their rivalry
straight to the end of their 15th
race. Zimbaldi went into the final
event with a four-point advantage
over Whitmarsh and succeeded in
defending his lead, claiming sec
ond for pood and causing Whit
marsh to settle for an unqualify
ing third.
Placing consistently in the top
five race after race proved to be
the key to the qualifier. Sailors
who performed well in one race
but then faltered in the next were
wiped out by sailors like Uznis
and Zimbaldi, who finished in the
top five in nearly every single
race.
"We are pretty happy to have
at least one sailor go to [the Sin
glehanded Nationals] although it
would have been great to have
two of our sailors take both first
and second," Meade said. "We
could have done this with a little
more effort."
Zimbaldi's dignified outing
more than made up for what the
other four Cardinal might have
lacked, however, and Stanford
waits with high hopes and expec
tations to see how Zimbaldi com
petes against the best in the
nation.

Stanford's Danny Zimbaldi will hope to keep the waters smooth and the sailing fast as he moves on to
the Singlehanded Nationals.
