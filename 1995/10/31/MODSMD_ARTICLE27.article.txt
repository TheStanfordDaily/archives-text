# Pacific next in line to feel wrath of Cardinal women's volleyball
## Deadly spikers set to smash Tigers 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
The ghosts of women's volley
ball greats will haunt No. 9 Pacif
ic tonight at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. But if the specters of
Halloween aren't enough to
derail the Tigers, Pacific will cer
tainly receive more than enough
torture from No. 4 Stanford.
The Cardinal (19-2 overall, 13-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) is on a
roll of epic proportions. Not only
has the team won 16 consecutive
matches, but over the last two
seasons, the Cardinal has won an
astonishing 53 out of 56 contests.
During this stretch, Stanford has
surpassed UCLA as the yardstick
by which volleyball teams are
measured.
Stanford's success this year
stems largely from its depth. The
fact that the team returned 13 of
15 players from last year's
national championship squad
means that coach Don Shaw can
field experienced players off the
bench. Such depth has left Shaw
with the most luxurious of prob
lems: finding enough playing
time to satisfy everyone.
Early in the season, injuries to
seniors Cary Wendell and Marnie
Triefenbach forced other players
into the lineup much sooner than
expected. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, its lesser-known play
ers stepped up to make tremen
dous contributions. Senior out
side hitter Wendy Hromadka is
quietly putting together an out
standing season. Hromadka, who
actually earned the starting spot
ahead of Triefenbach in spring
practice last year, is coming off
two excellent games this past

weekend in Arizona. She hit over
.400 in both games and recorded
nine kills against the Arizona
State.
Pacific will be the 12th ranked
opponent to face the Cardinal
this year, and the match will be
Stanford's 14th against a ranked
team. The strength of the Cardi
nal schedule adds controversy to
the national rankings. No. 1
Nebraska, whom Stanford
defeated earlier this season in
Lincoln, No. 2 Hawaii and No. 3
Florida all play a much weaker
schedule. Yet, Nebraska has just
one loss and the Rainbows and
Gators remain undefeated, so
Stanford has had trouble moving
up.
Following tonight's game,
Stanford will stay at home this
weekend to take on Washington
and No. 7 Washington State. The
Cougars are 10-3 in the Pac-10,
second-best in the conference.
Stanford will look to extend its
three-game conference lead
against Washington State in a
nationally-televised match on
Saturday night at 7 p.m.
