# Sports' many feats of tricks and treats
##

TTTith All Hallow's Eve
%/%# fast upon us and the
▼ T chirpings of "trick or
treat" just hours away, it seems
apropos to delve into our Hal
loween bag of fun and see who
in the world of sports this fall
season has been the recipient of
tasty, scrumptious treats and
who has had to swallow the bit
ter pill of cruel and heartless
tricks.
Starting in our own back
yard, Stanford athletics are
ripe for the plucking on both
sides of the fence. In the cate
gory of candy apple dreams and
marshmallow visions, women's
soccer and women's volleyball
are hotter than hell. The
women's soccer team has won
seven straight games, remains
undefeated in conference play
and appears to be peaking at
just the right time. Not to be
outdone, the women spikers
have a phenomenal 16-game
winning streak and, after a
shaky start, show no signs of
relinquishing their hold on the
championship glory they
attained last year.
Both men's and women's
cross country teams are also
reveling in the taste of sweet
success. Although the women
runners experienced a blow
with an injury to sophomore
star Kortney Dunscombe, don't
be surprised to see Stanford's
very own harriers create some
news in the world of cross coun
try.
Even field hockey is getting
in on the action, enjoying its
very own sugar-coated NorPac
crown and a playoff berth. So
what if field hockey only plays
in a three-team league? Play
offs are still playoffs.
On the other side of the
wheel of fortune, the perennial
ly strong water polo team has
taken a turn for the worse.
Stanford's aquamen aren't
even thinking conference title
right now. After losing four
straight games, the only thing
on the Cardinal's mind is quali
fying for the NCAA Champi
onships, which will take place
right here on the Farm. Stan
ford turned things around this
past weekend, getting that win
ning feeling back against Pep
perdine. But come December, if
Stanford fails to get invited to
its own dance, you can notch
this trick right up there with
finding a razor blade in your
sugar taffy.
Unlike its female counter

part, the men's soccer team
seems to be on the wrong end of
Halloween giving, posting a dis
mal 5-10-1 overall record. The
kickers dispelled rumors that
they were actually the walking
dead by finally getting a win
against hated Cal. Whether or
not this will prevent a third
straight losing season remains
to be seen.

Elsewhere in the world of
collegiate athletics, the grand
daddy of all tricks thus far this
year has been Stanford's "gift"
of quarterbacK Scott Frost to
Nebraska's football team. Frost
made a name for himself early
on this season not by running
the option, but by running
Heisman Trophy candidate
Lawrence Phillips right off the
team. Apparently, whatever
type of relationship Frost had
with a female friend of Phillips
was unacceptable to the
Husker running back and
pushed Phillips rather violently
over the edge and off the team.
While Phillips has since been
allowed to return to practice
and Nebraska really hasn't
shown too many ill-effects from
the loss (the Huskers are
ranked first now in the polls),
not even the most sinister of
masterminds could have come
up with this Trojan Horse of a
gift. Speaking of which . . . too
bad Frost didn't transfer to
USC instead.
College kids aren't the only
ones enjoying their fair share of
tricks and treats this fall sea
son. The big boys in the pros
are also having some fun in the
spirit of Halloween. After three
years of having wicked postsea
son hexes placed on them (four
if you count the labor strike),
the star-crossed Atlanta Braves
finally dispelled their curse and
captured the World Series.
Pitcher Tom Glavine tasted
perhaps the sweetest candy of
all, not only by winning the
World Series MVP, but also, for
the briefest of moments, by


Daniel
Kao
out-shining teammate Greg Mad
dux (a soon-to-be four-time Cy
Young award winner and best
righthander this century) and
proving that in the last five years,
he's been the second-best pitcher
in baseball.
Baseball fans also shared in the
Braves' spoils. Even if you aren't
an Atlanta fan, there's no denying
the masterful drama, action and
emotion of this year's Fall Classic.
Just hope that this will be a treat
that won't ever turn into a trick.

Thus far this NFL season, it's
become apparent which team
hauled in a mother lode of candy
corn and caramel and which team
got all the rotten eggs. And the
beauty of it all is that these two
teams seem bound by fate to have
intertwining destinies. If one goes
up, the other must go down . . .
and down. . . .
These two teams are the Dallas
Cowboys and San Francisco
49ers, and while there'll be much
more to talk about in two weeks
when these much-hated rivals
square off, one still can't deny the
glorious stash the Cowboys have
gotten this fall season and the
duds the Nitiers sowed. Dallas has
gone up, up, up and the Whiners

(they have good reason to cry
now) are face down in mud with
tire tracks running over them.
On one hand, Dallas has
reaped Deion Sanders (making
his Prime Time debut this past
Sunday), a rejuvenated core
nucleus of All-Pro stars Troy Aik
man, Michael Irvin and Emmitt
Smith, fat, cutting-edge deals
with Pepsi and Nike, not to men
tion in all likelihood, a third Lom
bardi Trophy in four years. On
the other hand, the Niners have
gotten three losses in eight
games, a bruised shoulder for
Steve Young, no kicker, a torn
knee for Brent Jones and another
for William Floyd (can't say I'll
miss him). Call it Karma or what

you will, but the phrase "just
desserts" comes to mind regard
ing these two teams.
Elsewhere around the league,
it appears as if most teams didn't
fare too well in their candy-hunt
ing pursuits. The Patriots, led by
young hot-shot quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, were supposed to be the
future of the NFL. Instead, they
have just two wins and six loss
es— including one to expansion
Carolina— to show for it. Cleve
land, another Super Bowl hope
ful, has also struggled this season
partly because of a free agent bust
they pulled in the name of Andre
Rison. The trend continues in the
AFC East with the Miami Dol
phins, who went for quantity in

their search for sweetness, load
ing their team with more first
round draft picks than you can
shake a stick at. Unfortunately
for the Fish, the acquisitions
haven't quite panned out and
Hall of Fame quarterback Dan
Marino got a nasty little present
in the form of torn knee cartilage.
This all translates into a strug
gling Dolphin team that in the
last month has lost to the likes of
the Saints and the Jets.
But some teams have been able
to find something that tastes
halfway decent in their bag of
goodies. Kansas City has discov
ered the second coming of Joe
Montana in Steve Bono (well,
maybe not Montana, but 7-1 isn't

too shabby). The Chiefs' AFC
West rival Oakland Raiders have
also found this season to their lik
ing despite hoodwinking Los
Angeles fans. Whether or not they
can sustain their performance is
another question. While the
Raiders have always had talent, it
appears that in recent years,
owner A 1 Davis, the wicked God
father of the West, has been able
to ruin things. I'm not sure this
year will be any different.
All things considered, it
appears as if the sports hobgob
lins of Halloween have fairly dis
pensed portions of whipped cream
and shaving cream. Now we can
only wait to see what's in Santa's
bag of presents.
