# Sports' many feats of tricks and treats

TTTith All Hallow's Eve
%/%# fast upon us and the
â–¼ T chirpings of "trick or
treat" just hours away, it seems
apropos to delve into our Hal
loween bag of fun and see who
in the world of sports this fall
season has been the recipient of
tasty, scrumptious treats and
who has had to swallow the bit
ter pill of cruel and heartless
tricks.
Starting in our own back
yard, Stanford athletics are
ripe for the plucking on both
sides of the fence. In the cate
gory of candy apple dreams and
marshmallow visions, women's
soccer and women's volleyball
are hotter than hell. The
women's soccer team has won
seven straight games, remains
undefeated in conference play
and appears to be peaking at
just the right time. Not to be
outdone, the women spikers
have a phenomenal 16-game
winning streak and, after a
shaky start, show no signs of
relinquishing their hold on the
championship glory they
attained last year.
Both men's and women's
cross country teams are also
reveling in the taste of sweet
success. Although the women
runners experienced a blow
with an injury to sophomore
star Kortney Dunscombe, don't
be surprised to see Stanford's
very own harriers create some
news in the world of cross coun
try.
Even field hockey is getting
in on the action, enjoying its
very own sugar-coated NorPac
crown and a playoff berth. So
what if field hockey only plays
in a three-team league? Play
offs are still playoffs.
On the other side of the
wheel of fortune, the perennial
ly strong water polo team has
taken a turn for the worse.
Stanford's aquamen aren't
even thinking conference title
right now. After losing four
straight games, the only thing
on the Cardinal's mind is quali
fying for the NCAA Champi
onships, which will take place
right here on the Farm. Stan
ford turned things around this
past weekend, getting that win
ning feeling back against Pep
perdine. But come December, if
Stanford fails to get invited to
its own dance, you can notch
this trick right up there with
finding a razor blade in your
sugar taffy.
Unlike its female counter

part, the men's soccer team
seems to be on the wrong end of
Halloween giving, posting a dis
mal 5-10-1 overall record. The
kickers dispelled rumors that
they were actually the walking
dead by finally getting a win
against hated Cal. Whether or
not this will prevent a third
straight losing season remains
to be seen.

Elsewhere in the world of
collegiate athletics, the grand
daddy of all tricks thus far this
year has been Stanford's "gift"
of quarterbacK Scott Frost to
Nebraska's football team. Frost
made a name for himself early
on this season not by running
the option, but by running
Heisman Trophy candidate
Lawrence Phillips right off the
team. Apparently, whatever
type of relationship Frost had
with a female friend of Phillips
was unacceptable to the
Husker running back and
pushed Phillips rather violently
over the edge and off the team.
While Phillips has since been
allowed to return to practice
and Nebraska really hasn't
shown too many ill-effects from
the loss (the Huskers are
ranked first now in the polls),
not even the most sinister of
masterminds could have come
up with this Trojan Horse of a
gift. Speaking of which . . . too
bad Frost didn't transfer to
USC instead.
College kids aren't the only
ones enjoying their fair share of
tricks and treats this fall sea
son. The big boys in the pros
are also having some fun in the
spirit of Halloween. After three
years of having wicked postsea
son hexes placed on them (four
if you count the labor strike),
the star-crossed Atlanta Braves
finally dispelled their curse and
captured the World Series.
Pitcher Tom Glavine tasted
perhaps the sweetest candy of
all, not only by winning the
World Series MVP, but also, for
the briefest of moments, by
