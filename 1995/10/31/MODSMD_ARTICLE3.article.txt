# Res Ed's head discusses role
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
The reaction to "new Residential Education poli
cies" on topics such as sexual harassment and alcohol
has repeatedly surprised Jane Camarillo, the new di
rector of Res Ed.
"I always get confused about why it's being called
a new policy — or why, even more so, it's being called
a Res Ed policy," she said. "I ask my staff, 'Is this a
new policy?' and they'll say 'Oh, no, we've always
trained RAs about this. . . . The policy has always
been the same.' "
Camarillo said that policies people perceive as
being directed by Res Ed often are not. The Universi
ty's alcohol and sexual harassment policies, for ex
ample, are formed by University committees, she
said.
"What we're charged with is actually supporting
those policies and ensuring the implementation of
things like the alcohol policy and the sexual as
sault / sexual harassment response within the resi
dences," Camarillo said.
In the most recent incident, potential changes to
the University sexual harassment policy caused
changes in residential assistant training that forbade
RAs from promising confidentiality to residents who
may have been victims of sexual harassment or sexu
al assault.
"I would say that the change has been that staff
are really being informed of what their obligations
are as staff," Camarillo said, explaining why she
thinks students believe that Res Ed is enacting new
policies.
"That may be a different slant
to what was part of training in
the past. . . . But I think the con
nection between (the individual]
staff member and what these
policies mean wasn't exactly
focused on during training" in
the past.
"Even though a suicidal stu
dent might say, 'I don't want you
to tell anybody this, but I'm going
to try to kill myself,' [RAs] had an
obligation to reveal that to some
one," she said. "In the same way,
generally, staff are told that you
can't always guarantee confiden
tiality. That's part of past train
ing and will be part of future
training."
Originally from Texas, Camar
illo first came to California to do
her graduate work at UCLA.
"Toward the dissertation
phase, I needed money so I
applied for a job as a program
assistant there with the Office of
Residential Life," she said.
"From that point on, I stayed in
Residential Life."
Ultimately, she held the posi
tion of "area director," supervis
ing the residence staff in two
high-rises and two suite complex
es with a total student population
of 2,100. She then became Stan
ford's director of Res Ed, ending
a three-year period in which that
position had been filled by acting
directors.
Camarillo does not intend to

change policies or create plans so
soon into her tenure at Stanford.
"My style is really to do a lot
more learning and listening
before we begin to establish ini
tiatives.
"In the coming year, a lot of
the focus is on figuring out what's
working and how it works, to see
what really needs to be tweaked
and what doesn't need to be
tweaked," she said. "If this is a
sound system, we are definitely
here to support you. If it's not a
sound system but we have stu
dents committed to it, we definite
ly want to be able to support it.
"What I would really like to do
is learn from the staff, the stu
dents and faculty, how they have
perceived Residential Education
in the past and what they envi
sion as a stronger and more sup
portive relationship with Resi
dential Education," she said.
Nonetheless, there are some
issues which Camarillo must face
immediately. Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds addressed some of
those in her State of Student
Affairs speech last Tuesday.
Specifically, Edmonds called
for examining the relationship
and "building the sturdy bridges
between the academy and Resi
dential Education."
To help do that, even though
the Office of Residential Educa
tion falls under the authority of
Edmonds, Camarillo is working
with Ramon Saldfvar, vice
provost and dean for undergradu
ate studies.
"I've been participating in
meetings with the Committee on

Undergraduate Studies primarily
to find out what are some of the
questions about undergraduate
studies that relate to Residential
Education and what we can be
doing to support undergraduate
studies and undergraduate edu
cation," she said.
Edmonds also called for the
creation of a task force to exam
ine the University's alcohol poli
ey.
"The task force ... is not just
to review what happens in the
residences but generally across
campus," Camarillo said. "It
doesn't necessarily mean that
RAs are now going to be seeing a
different role in enforcement or
not enforcement.
"I think the fear that students
have is, 'Now you're restricting
my freedom of choice to drink or
not to drink,' " she said. "What
we're trying to impact is not the
decision to drink or not to drink
but the real abusive behavior that
could result in dangerous or life
threatening situations. That's
what we would like to reduce."
"We are asking resident assis
tants to take a much more pro
active role in being able to pre
vent binge drinking or to con
front students who may be binge
drinking," Camarillo said. "But
when it comes down to enforce
ment, that's still something that
we expect [RAs] to be able to
depend on the support of resi
dence deans or the resident fel
lows.
"I suspect that's still the role
that the RAs will assume in deal
ing with abuse of alcohol," she
said.
