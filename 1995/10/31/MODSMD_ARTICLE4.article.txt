# Running for his life

### Dale Margolin 
For some medical students, training to be a doc
tor means more than sitting through lectures and
observing their mentors. It can also mean estab
lishing personal relationships with their patients.
On Dec. 10, Stephen Wallace, a third-year med
ical student at Stanford, will run 26.2 miles in a
marathon sponsored by the leukemia Society of
America. Just a few months after serious knee

surgery, Wallace is determined to run the
marathon in honor of his friend Ivan Dimas, a 17-
year-old who was diagnosed with leukemia two
years ago.
Wallace met Dimas a few months ago while
working in the Children's Hospital at Stanford
Medical Center and the two of them became close
friends. Dimas was recently diagnosed with a re-

lapse of leukemia and, according
to Wallace, his spirits have been
down.
"Ivan needs a boost," Wallace
explained as one of the reasons he
will run the marathon. He
described Dimas as "quiet" these
days and said he would like to
cheer him up. Dimas is waiting
for a hone-marrow transplant
and currently gets chemotherapy
treatments weekly.
However, Dimas is still an
active teenager, in spite of his
fight against leukemia. He said
he especially enjoys golf and bas
ketball and is also interested in
computers. Dimas has also main
tained a positive attitude about
the disease.
"Leukemia has helped me in
many ways. I have become
stronger. I don't take things for
granted anymore," Dimas said.
He said he has received a lot of
support from his community
since he was diagnosed with
leukemia.
"I have made many good
friends since I became sick," he
said.
Wallace is one of the many
people who befriended Dimas
upon arrival at the Children's
Hospital. Wallace recently hosted
Dimas and his family at his house
for a barbecue. The marathon is
symbolic of this friendship and
Wallace's concern for Dimas.
Wallace said he is also running
the marathon because he feels

that the leukemia Society is an
important organization that
deserves recognition and dona
tions. Every Friday, Dimas must
travel two hours from his home in
order to receive his chemotherapy
treatments at the Stanford Hospi
tal. When Wallace found out that
the Leukemia Society pays for
Dimas* transportation to Stan
ford every week, he said felt a
need to contribute to the society.
"The Leukemia Society is basi
cally funded by donations," said
Wallace. He said he would like to
help them in continue their great
work.
Wallace said he would also like
to make people more aware of
leukemia in general and hopes to
do this by publicizing the
marathon.
"Leukemia is not such a rare
disease," he said. "Both children
and adults are affected." Wallace
said he hopes to raise the aware
ness of this disease and of the
Leukemia society, which helps
people like Dimas and also spon
sors leukemia research at institu
tions like Stanford.
As Dec. 10 approaches, Wal
lace is recovering from a ski acci
dent last May. Despite undergo
ing surgery for the injury in July,
Wallace runs about eight miles a
day. He has run four marathons,
but this is his first after the ski
accident.
Wallace is currently seeking
sponsors on a per mile basis or for
a pre determined sum. He has
pledged to raise $3,000 in honor
of Dimas and to show his support
and respect for the Leukemia
Society of America.
