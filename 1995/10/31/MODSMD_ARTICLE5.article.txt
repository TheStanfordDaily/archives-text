# Language dept. overhaul may cut part-time posts
## But new division decreases bureaucracy, H&S says 
### James G. Wheaton Contributing writer 
Several part-time employees may lose their jobs as
a result of the reorganization of the University's lan
guage departments into a Division of Languages, Lit
eratures and Cultures.
But none of the 11 full-time positions in the divi
sion will be cut, Senior Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Etchemendy said after depart
mental meetings last week.
The new administrative structure, which com
bines six language departments into one division —
leaving depart ments independent under an executive
committee — would not necessarily lead to budget
savings or a reduction in the number of full-time em
ployees, Etchemendy said.
The loss of part-time jobs, he said, is "likely" be
cause of a philosophical shift toward specifically de
fined roles in a centralized administrative structure.
"There's not a problem with the new structure,
but the transition will be difficult. It will affect peo
ple," he added.
The 11 positions in the new division will include a
financial services specialist, a student service special
ist, an information technologies expert, the Lan

guage Center director and a general division admin
istrator. In addition, each department will retain a
full-time administrative assistant position.
"What we're trying to do here is like what they're
trying to do with Medicare," said Etchemendy. "We're
trying to do more with the same amount of money."
The fiscal effects of the plan are somewhat in
doubt. While there is no reduction in next year's bud
get, cutting costs "would be nice," Etchemendy said.
"It's hard to predict in steady numbers," he said.
"We have the same number of full-time equivalents,
but we'll have new functions and be more efficient
than the current system. Also, by eliminating the
part-time positions, we may have cost savings."
Asian Languages Department Chair Thomas
Hare said, "the administration has told us again and
again that this is not about cutting costs. However,
they want to streamline and centralize the various
administrative procedures, so you can take that as
you will."
Ralph Hester, chair of the Department of French
and Italian, said that the changes "wouldn't specifi
cally affect anything in the classroom."
"We'll have to wait and see how things work out
when we move to the new build
ing next year," Hester said.
Some language departments
have been operating out of mod
ules in the parking lot near
Wilbur Hall since the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake damaged their
traditional offices in the Quad.
These departments are sched
uled to move back into the Quad
alongside a new language center
before next fall.
The new division, directed by a
committee consisting of the
chairs of those six departments,
two at-large faculty members
from within the division and the
language center director, will
coordinate the administration of
the modern language depart

ments: French and Italian, Span
ish and Portuguese, Slavic Stud
ies, Asian Languages, German
Studies and Comparative Litera
ture.
Hare suggested that the
impact of restructuring on teach
ing and research depends on how
well the project is implemented.
"If the project is done well,
then there won't be a difference,"
he said. "However, if it is not done
well, professors may have to
spend more time getting reim
bursed for research expenses and
that sort of thing, and it could
become a burden."
Etchemendy disagreed, saying
that the restructuring will have
an "absolutely positive impact."
"We'll have a specialist in
fields like student services devel
oping programs for the whole
division. We'll have a computer
specialist to help professors use

technology which we don't have
now."
According to Etchemendy,
many of the departments have
"become dependent on part
time and student help." Under
the new, theoretically more effi
cient system, the part-time
employees will no longer be
needed, he said.
"The current staffing doesn't
work," said Etchemendy, adding
that often in a small department,
"one person is forced to deal with
all kinds of issues."
The possibility exists that
some of the part-time employees
will get full-time jobs in the new
structure. Etchemendy also said
the University takes care of
employees whose positions are
eliminated.
"First they get severance, and
then they get priority at any other
job that opens up in the Universi

ty," he said.
Because of the close ties that
often develop between chairs and
staff members inside the depart
ments, Etchemendy said, the ulti
mate responsibility for staff reas
signment lies with his office.
According to Etchemendy, the
division has already had a positive
effect, such as a revision in disser
tation policy.
"It used to be that all the dis
sertations had to be in English. ...
Well, it seems that if you're writ
ing a Spanish paper, and you're
reading the literature in Spanish,
and the people who are reading
the papers should be reading it in
Spanish, well, we should have for
eign-language dissertations.
"The departments, who had
been trying to fight this policy for
a long time, got together in the
division and changed the policy,"
Etchemendy said.

But none of the 11 full-time positions in the divi
sion will be cut, Senior Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Etchemendy said after depart
mental meetings last week.
The new administrative structure, which com
bines six language departments into one division —
leaving depart ments independent under an executive
committee — would not necessarily lead to budget
savings or a reduction in the number of full-time em
ployees, Etchemendy said.
The loss of part-time jobs, he said, is "likely" be
cause of a philosophical shift toward specifically de
fined roles in a centralized administrative structure.
"There's not a problem with the new structure,
but the transition will be difficult. It will affect peo
ple," he added.
The 11 positions in the new division will include a
financial services specialist, a student service special
ist, an information technologies expert, the Lan

guage Center director and a general division admin
istrator. In addition, each department will retain a
full-time administrative assistant position.
"What we're trying to do here is like what they're
trying to do with Medicare," said Etchemendy. "We're
trying to do more with the same amount of money."
The fiscal effects of the plan are somewhat in
doubt. While there is no reduction in next year's bud
get, cutting costs "would be nice," Etchemendy said.
"It's hard to predict in steady numbers," he said.
"We have the same number of full-time equivalents,
but we'll have new functions and be more efficient
than the current system. Also, by eliminating the
part-time positions, we may have cost savings."
Asian Languages Department Chair Thomas
Hare said, "the administration has told us again and
again that this is not about cutting costs. However,
they want to streamline and centralize the various
administrative procedures, so you can take that as
you will."
Ralph Hester, chair of the Department of French
and Italian, said that the changes "wouldn't specifi
cally affect anything in the classroom."
"We'll have to wait and see how things work out
when we move to the new build
ing next year," Hester said.
Some language departments
have been operating out of mod
ules in the parking lot near
Wilbur Hall since the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake damaged their
traditional offices in the Quad.
These departments are sched
uled to move back into the Quad
alongside a new language center
before next fall.
The new division, directed by a
committee consisting of the
chairs of those six departments,
two at-large faculty members
from within the division and the
language center director, will
coordinate the administration of
the modern language depart

ments: French and Italian, Span
ish and Portuguese, Slavic Stud
ies, Asian Languages, German
Studies and Comparative Litera
ture.
Hare suggested that the
impact of restructuring on teach
ing and research depends on how
well the project is implemented.
"If the project is done well,
then there won't be a difference,"
he said. "However, if it is not done
well, professors may have to
spend more time getting reim
bursed for research expenses and
that sort of thing, and it could
become a burden."
Etchemendy disagreed, saying
that the restructuring will have
an "absolutely positive impact."
"We'll have a specialist in
fields like student services devel
oping programs for the whole
division. We'll have a computer
specialist to help professors use

technology which we don't have
now."
According to Etchemendy,
many of the departments have
"become dependent on part
time and student help." Under
the new, theoretically more effi
cient system, the part-time
employees will no longer be
needed, he said.
"The current staffing doesn't
work," said Etchemendy, adding
that often in a small department,
"one person is forced to deal with
all kinds of issues."
The possibility exists that
some of the part-time employees
will get full-time jobs in the new
structure. Etchemendy also said
the University takes care of
employees whose positions are
eliminated.
"First they get severance, and
then they get priority at any other
job that opens up in the Universi

ty," he said.
Because of the close ties that
often develop between chairs and
staff members inside the depart
ments, Etchemendy said, the ulti
mate responsibility for staff reas
signment lies with his office.
According to Etchemendy, the
division has already had a positive
effect, such as a revision in disser
tation policy.
"It used to be that all the dis
sertations had to be in English. ...
Well, it seems that if you're writ
ing a Spanish paper, and you're
reading the literature in Spanish,
and the people who are reading
the papers should be reading it in
Spanish, well, we should have for
eign-language dissertations.
"The departments, who had
been trying to fight this policy for
a long time, got together in the
division and changed the policy,"
Etchemendy said.
