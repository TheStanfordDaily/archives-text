# Language dept. overhaul may cut part-time posts
## But new division decreases bureaucracy, H&S says 
### James G. Wheaton Contributing writer 
Several part-time employees may lose their jobs as
a result of the reorganization of the University's lan
guage departments into a Division of Languages, Lit
eratures and Cultures.
But none of the 11 full-time positions in the divi
sion will be cut, Senior Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Etchemendy said after depart
mental meetings last week.
The new administrative structure, which com
bines six language departments into one division —
leaving depart ments independent under an executive
committee — would not necessarily lead to budget
savings or a reduction in the number of full-time em
ployees, Etchemendy said.
The loss of part-time jobs, he said, is "likely" be
cause of a philosophical shift toward specifically de
fined roles in a centralized administrative structure.
"There's not a problem with the new structure,
but the transition will be difficult. It will affect peo
ple," he added.
The 11 positions in the new division will include a
financial services specialist, a student service special
ist, an information technologies expert, the Lan

guage Center director and a general division admin
istrator. In addition, each department will retain a
full-time administrative assistant position.
"What we're trying to do here is like what they're
trying to do with Medicare," said Etchemendy. "We're
trying to do more with the same amount of money."
The fiscal effects of the plan are somewhat in
doubt. While there is no reduction in next year's bud
get, cutting costs "would be nice," Etchemendy said.
"It's hard to predict in steady numbers," he said.
"We have the same number of full-time equivalents,
but we'll have new functions and be more efficient
than the current system. Also, by eliminating the
part-time positions, we may have cost savings."
Asian Languages Department Chair Thomas
Hare said, "the administration has told us again and
again that this is not about cutting costs. However,
they want to streamline and centralize the various
administrative procedures, so you can take that as
you will."
Ralph Hester, chair of the Department of French
and Italian, said that the changes "wouldn't specifi
cally affect anything in the classroom."
"We'll have to wait and see how things work out
