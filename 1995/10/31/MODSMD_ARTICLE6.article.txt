### Shoshana Deutschkron 
Walter Falcon, director of the
University's Institute for Interna
tional Studies, has been appointed
to the Board of International Food
and Agricultural Development by
President Clinton.
The seven-member board advis
es the Agency for International De
velopment on "food security issues
and other matters pertaining to for
eign assistance," Falcon said.
Falcon was sworn in last Thurs
day at the State Department. Fal
con said that while in Washington
he "had conversations with numer
ous specialists and spent time with
senior leadership at (the agency)."

Two main points the board grap
pled with included "the extraordi
narily difficult problems of increas
ing food production in Africa" and
the perception of humanitarian aid
activities in the United States, Fal
con said.
Referring to the perception of
humanitarian aid by the public,
Falcon said that there is a "huge
mismatch of perceptions and what
is actually the case." In support of
this statement, Falcon said that,
when polled, the public thought
one-fourth of the gross national
product goes to humanitarian aid,
when in fact, one-fourth of 1 pei
cent of the GNP goes to humanitar
ian aid.

Falcon said that one of the pur
poses of the board is to advise the
federal agency on how to "better ed
ucate the public on foreign aid is
sues."
Agricultural issues will "resur
face" next year as a result of an in
ternational summit held by the
United Nations' Food and Agri
cultural Organization, Falcon
said. There are many pressing is
sues which need to be examined,
he said, such as the 800 million
people worldwide who are under
fed.
The board meets four times a
year for two days, so it is more a ser
vice activity than a job, Falcon said.
He said he feels his appointment
will enhance his work at Stanford.
The concerns of the board overlap
with Falcon's areas of expertise and
his work with the institute.
As director of the institute, Fal
con deals with international politi
cal economies and the international
agricultural environment. The pri
mary purpose of the institute is to
"coordinate research on contempo
rary, policy-relevant issues that are
international and inter-school in
character," according to the Stan
ford Bulletin.

Currently, Falcon teaches a
course called "The World Food
Fconomy," which is an eco
nomics and food research course.
The course examines "interrela
tionships among food, popula
tion, resources, and economic
development," according to the
bulletin.
It also investigates "agricultural
and rural development in achieving
economic and social progress in
low-income nations." There Ls an
"emphasis on public-sector deci
sion making as it relates to f<x)d
policy."
This is Falcon's second national
appointment. During the Carter
administration, he was a member
of the Presidential Commission on
Food and Agriculture.
