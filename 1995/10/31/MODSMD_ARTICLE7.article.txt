# Curriculum is Casper's focus
## Advising, CUE on 1995 agenda 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Although political issues from the grape boycott
to the reduction of financial aid surround him,
University President Gerhard Casper plans to
focus his attention on the basic issue of curricular
change this year.
Casper said in an interview last week that en
suring quality curricular changes would be his
major focus for the 1995-96 academic year.

As responses to the recommen
dations by the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education are pre
sented to the Faculty Senate, the
University moves increasingly
closer to implementing massive re
forms in undergraduate studies.
"I will continue to worry about
the implementation of the CUE re
port," Casper said.
The commission was created by
Casper in April 1993 to re-examine

virtually all facets of undergraduate education.
Last October, Casper released the committee's 64-
page report, which detailed proposed changes in
everything from the system of distribution re
quirements to a program that would allow minors.
Looking ahead at the coming year, Casper said
he was particularly interested in prospects for es
tablishing technological resources so high school
and college students throughout the world can en
roll in Stanford classes.
By taking advantage of resources in technology,
"Stanford can relate to the world by means of dis
tance contacts," he said.
He emphasized, however, that despite ever
evolving technological advances, the University
should pursue stronger measures to remain up-to
date.
"The University has to confront the challenge
that comes from information technology much
more vigorously than we have so far," Casper said.
Thus far, two committees — both subcommit
tees of the University Committee on Technology in
Teaching and Learning — are examining how tech-


Casper
nology can be used to improve
the University and the outside
community.
A team-teaching program
with UC-Berkeley is in the plan
ning stages, and the committees
have already begun to establish
other team-teaching programs
and college / high school interac
tion. The committees have also
considered establishing a center
for human / computer interac
tion at Stanford.
Two issues from the commis
sion's report will soon resurface.
Proposals for changes to the

advising system and for tracks in
the science core will be debated
at the Faculty Senate's Nov. 9
meeting.
At the meeting, revisions to
undergraduate advising will be
announced by Vice Provost and
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Ramon Saldi'var. Casper has
repeatedly supported changes in
interaction between students
and faculty, both in advising and
with freshman and sophomore
small-group programs.
The proposed science core cur
riculum — currently under
review by Mathematics Prof.
Brad Osgood — will also be an
important change which could
commence as early as next year.
Casper emphasized, however,

that a quality program would
take time.
"It is important to me that we
do it and that we do it well," he
said. "We still have a lot of work
ahead of us."
The science core would give
students the option of taking a
year-long track which fulfills dis
tribution requirements in natu
ral sciences, mathematics and
applied and technological sci
ences. Multiple tracks are being
considered after proposals were
submitted last spring.
The track may be an option
for students beginning in the
1996-97 school year.
Other commission recommen
dations which Casper said are
major issues include the estab

lishment of a more stringent for
eign language requirement,
which was heavily debated last
year. The new rules would dis
continue the current practice of
allowing incoming freshmen to
meet the requirement with three
years of high school study.
Instead, students would have to
test out of the requirement.
Casper also mentioned that a
committee is looking into a possi
ble oral communications require
ment similar to the University's
Writing and Critical Thinking
requirement. The commission's
recommendations last year led to
an extension of the writing
requirement to include "writing
intensive" courses in every
major.
