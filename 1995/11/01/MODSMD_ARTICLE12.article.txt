MONTREAL (AP) — Stung by defeat
in the secession referendum, Quebec
Premier Jacques Parizeau said yester
day he will resign as head of the bitterly
divided province at year's end.
He also voiced regret at the way he
had blamed the loss on non-French
immigrants, but he stopped short of an
outright apology for a diatribe that drew
a firestorm of criticism.
Parizeau underscored his continuing
support for the separatist cause that hiis
been at the heart of his long political
career. He said his separatist Parti Que
becois would choose new leadership
capable of achieving independence for
the mostly French-speaking province.
Parizeau, 65, was elected premier hist
year after promising to hold a referen
dum on secession. His side lost Monday,
but only narrowly — 50.6 percent to 49.4
percent.
Hut at a time when the separatists
could have been taking heart at their
strong showing, Parizeau shocked even
his allies with a incendiary speech at

campaign headquarters, blaming the
defeat on immigrants.
"It's true we have been defeated, but
basically by what?" Parizeau said. "By
money and the ethnic vote."
About 90 percent of English-speaking
and immigrant Quebeckers opposed
secession, while French Quebeckers —•
who make up 82 percent of the popula
tion — voted for independence by a 60-
40 margin.
Parizeau took responsibility for
defeat.
"With my qualities and my faults, I
contributed to bringing this great project
to the result of Oct. 30," he said. "Others
will now take it across the final line."
Earlier yesterday, Bouchard — a pos
sible replacement for Parizeau — scoffed
at an offer from Chretien to negotiate a
new status for Quebec.
Bouchard reiterated the separatists'
promise to mount another independence
drive. Current Quebec law bars a new
secession referendum until after new
legislative elections, but separatists con

trol the legislature and could change the
law.
Though most of Canada welcomed
Monday's outcome, Quebec was uneasy.
Montreal police reported 40 arrests alter
supporters of the rival sides brawled,
and a homemade bomb was found at the
offices of the federalist Liberal Party. No
one was seriously injured in the street
fighting, police said.
There was little celebration in the fed
eral capital, Ottawa, where Chretien met
with his Cabinet to discuss the impact of
Monday's referendum.
The federalists' narrow victory kept
Canada intact but drove home the mes
sage that Quebeckers, and many other
Canadians, want major changes in the
federal system.
Financial markets welcomed the Yes
victory, narrow as it was. Prices rose on
the Toronto and Montreal stock
exchanges, and the Canadian dollar —
weakened by pre-referendum uncertain
ty — strengthened on world currency
markets.
