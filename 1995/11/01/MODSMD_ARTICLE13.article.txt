# Stage is set for Bosnian peace talks
## 
### 
DAYTON, Ohio (AP) â€” A somber
President Clinton, hoping to set the
stage for a settlement, warned the lead
ers of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia yester
day that they were undertaking what
could be "the last best chance we have
for a very long time" to end Europe's
deadliest conflict since World War 11.
Delegations headed by Presidents Slo
bodan Milosevic of Serbia, Franjo Tudj
man of Croatia and Alija Izetbegovic of
Bosnia were arriving separately yester
day night for the U.S.-run talks opening
today at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base.
"So much is riding on the success in
Dayton, and the whole world is watch
ing," Clinton said at the White House
in a send-off for Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and U.S. media

tor Richard Holbrooke.
Holbrooke, author of a basic agree
ment on the division of Bosnian territory
and postwar power-sharing, spoke cau
tiously about chances for peace after four
years of war.
Some of the toughest issues awaiting
negotiators are map boundaries, the sta
tus of Sarajevo, practical steps that must
l>e taken to separate hostile forces and
procedures for free elections.
They also will have to address, "a bun
dle of human rights issues," including
the plight of refugees and justice for war
atrocities, said Anthony Lake, Clinton's
national security adviser.
The austere military base, far from
Washington, was chosen to keep the
negotiations private.
On the eve of the talks, there was a

sense of foreboding in Congress about
sending up to 25,000 American troops to
Bosnia as part of a NATO force to enforce
any peace settlement.
House members expressed their con
cerns Monday, voting 315-103 on a non
binding resolution indicating hesitance
about using American soldiers.
Clinton said American troops would
be deployed only if sides settled on a
peace agreement. They would operate
under NATO command, with clear rides
of engagement and a clearly defmed mis
sion, the president said.
He warned that if the war reignites, it
could spread throughout Europe into the
type of conflict that has drawn Ameri
cans into two European wars in this cen
tury. "We have to end the war in Bosnia
and do it now."
