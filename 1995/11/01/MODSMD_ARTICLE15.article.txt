## A
						spending spree 
### 
LAST WEEK, THE Universi
ty won a long court battle
over the trust fund of the
late Eloise Maburv Knapp and her
sister, Bella Mabury. Stanford's
take is somewhere between $18
million and $20 million.
While the University has recent
ly received several sizable dona
tions, the trust settlement presents
an unusual and indeed fortunate
opportunity for Stanford. David
Glen, principal gifts director in the
Office of Development, said it best:
"The unrestricted nature [of the
gift] is important to Stanford. We
can put (the money) in places
which need it most."
In lay terms, Stanford has just
hit a $20-million jackpot and Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice
have complete discretion with the
money.
Undoubtedly, Casper's office
has already received suggestions
on how best to allot the windfall
funds. The following are some

ideas which may not have crossed
his desk:
• Build more graduate housing in
salamander-free areas. While
many grad students live comfort
ably in Rains or Mirrielees, some
are forced to either rough it in the
Manzanita trailers or try to get a
place in Palo Alto, where the hous
ing is neither affordable nor par
ticularly convenient.
• Serve meals seven days a week in
all residences. Don't crowd stu
dents into Florence Moore and
Wilbur on weekends.
• Since class sizes are growing, use
some of the funds to improve
undergraduate education by hiring
more teaching assistants to reduce
the size of sections, especially in
freshman classes like CIV and
Writing and Critical Thinking.
Increase funding to the Center for
Teaching and Learning so more
tutors can be made available to
students in difficult subjects.
• Last but not least, repaint Stern
Hall.
