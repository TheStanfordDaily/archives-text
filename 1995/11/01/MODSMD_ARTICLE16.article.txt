# Dramatic closing
## 
### 
Recently, ram's head
canceled its Spring Musical,
citing rising production
costs, high usage fees charged by
Events and Services and a lack of
student interest in its productions.
In canceling the show, Ram's
Head stated that its desire to keep
ticket prices low was a primary fac
tor in its decision. Unfortunately,
Ram's Head needs to remember
the lessons learned in Econ 1.
If your costs are fixed and you
can only cover them by raising
ticket prices, raise ticket prices.
The choice here was between no
show and a show with more expen
sive tickets — Ram's Head chose
no show. The real problem with
raising ticket prices lies in the fact
that, as Ram's Head freely admits,
its shows do not always generate
widespread interest. Even if ticket
prices are low, why pot on a show
that people do not want to see?

The only other way for Ram's
Head to produce a spring show was
to lower its costs — and it tried.
While Ram's Head said that Events
and Services' fees were unfairly
high, the fees are at least fairly
applied. Other campus groups such
as the Speakers Bureau and ASSU
Sunday Flicks have to pay the same
prices for space.
Calling the University's refusal
to make a special exception and
lower its fees a "lack of support by
the University," as one member of
the Ram's Head board of directors
did, is quite unreasonable. Instead
of asking for exemptions, if a prob
lem in the fee structure truly
exists, Ram's Head should work
with other student groups who feel
similarly to change the situation,
rather than abandoning potential
allies and advisors.
Ram's Head should re-group
and re-focus its efforts.
