Canada's referendum is a good lesson for U.S.

FIRST OFF, THANKS very much
to Pierre Kennepohl and Hamish
Nixon for their very thoughtful
comments on the Quebec Referendum.
Their analysis was by far the most
insightful discussion I read in the Amer
ican press today.
Virtually all U.S. media coverage of
Canada's national struggle over its iden
tity took the form of either assessing
the event in a vacuum (the "Whoa.
What's up in Canada?" approach) or for
its impact on the United States (the
"Wonder how this will affect NAFTA?"

approach). I'd like to suggest that
Americans can learn a lot about them
selves from the Quebec decision. The
referendum cuts close to issues of race,
culture, identity and separatism which
simmer on the back burner in this coun
try. It may presage things to come in
America.
In the wake of the Million Man March
and the separatist message of Louis Far
rakhan, one must wonder what the
result of a referendum similar to that of
the Quebecois might have on America.
The relevant issues are hauntingly simi

lar: What are the possibilities for plural
ism when all power accrues to the major
ity? Is culture a zero-sum game, in which
tolerating the culture of others necessari
ly diminishes one's own? Are the bound
aries between individual identities, group
identities and national identities so
insurmountable that we demand our citi
zens to choose among them?
I cannot begin to offer answers to
these questions. Canadians have spent
years grappling with them and will
devote the coming months to trying to
reconcile them. Half of Quebec voted

Monday that no answers are possible.
But Canada is by no means the only
country in North America in which a
minority, feeling itself disenfranchised
and ignored, has begun to abandon the
hope for a diverse and multicultural
nation. The Quebec referendum was not
just another current events story which
took place in a bubble someplace. It was
a preview and a warning about what
happens when the dream of tolerance
and pluralism is allowed to die.
