# First grape vote's low turnout due to lack of interest
## 
### 
Maybe it was the attraction of Flicks
that caused residents of Kimball, Lan
tana and Castano not to show up Sunday
night to vote on the grape issue — but I
doubt it. Regardless, less than half of the
students who eat at Manzanita Dining
Court bothered to vote on whether to
serve grapes at meals. Of the 400-plus
students, only 80 voted against serving
the special fruit, while 92 voted in favor
and 20 abstained (courteously), or so it
goes according to The Daily.
In case those of you on high failed to
notice the previous signs, this grand-

scale no-show should finally serve
notice that, on average, the Stanford
student doesn't care whether grapes
are served or not. Less than 200 stu
dents (192 in fact) decided that the
issue was worth a few minutes and a
pen stroke or two.
It seems that the only people taking
the issue seriously are those who will he
least affected — the administration and
faculty. Apparently every activist's
greatest fear has come true — apathy
has taken over our student body. Now,
1 don't mean to sjiy that we should be
criticized for lack of interest or con
cern, for in fact, I too don't care. After
all, not caring about anything is a
Stanford tradition which rivals Big
Game. My only point is that this non
issue (the grapes) has been built into a
major one by the University . . . and we

students don't care!
