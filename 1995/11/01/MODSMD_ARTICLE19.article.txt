# UC regent replies to Stanford protest
## 
### 
The purpose of this letter is to let you
know that I consider the action of the
students in using Stanford as a staging
area for their visit to our home to
protest my vote to change affirmative
action to be totally outrageous. Several
of my colleagues, particularly Senior Fel
low Dr. Thomas Metzger, agree with me
Even in the worst days of the late 1960s
and early 19705, my private property
was never invaded.
For the information of your readers,
the reason my wife and I were not home

is that we were out getting exercise,
playing tennis on the Stanford courts
with June and George Marotta. When
we drove back, we saw the demonstra
tors on our property with back-ups
across the street and we just drove on
and circled the hills. When we came
back, these so called "dedicated demon
strators" had already left.
As for Sandra Ramirez's remarks
about my being dead in 10 years, I hate to
disappoint her, but it will be at least 20-25
years before I am deceased, as my grand
father O'Brien lived to be 95. As one of
my colleagues once said in an earlier letter
to The Daily, "The Daily should be thor
oughly ashamed of publishing such driv
el."
