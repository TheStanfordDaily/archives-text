# Big Game glut
## Student tickets are still plentiful

Those still looking for Big
Game tickets can rest assured: It's

not too late.
The Athletic
Department
yesterday con
firmed that
there are more
than 13,000 tick
ets still available
for the game,
which will be
held in Stanford
Stadium on Nov.
18. Of those tick-

ets, 2,000 are student tickets, said
Asst. Athletics Director Charles
Davis.
Davis said the Athletic Depart
ment was "behind schedule on the
way to a sellout," and that there
were usually fewer tickets avail
able this close to the game. Part of
the problem, he said, is a wide

spread rnisperception of how fast
tickets get sold.
"People have become used to
sellouts and not being able to get
tickets, and so they don't try," he
said. However, the last time Stan
ford hosted UC-Berkeley in 1993,
the game failed to sell out, he
added.
He confirmed that this year's
unusually high rate of availability
was part of a pattern of lower than
usual attendance at Cardinal foot
ball games this season, though the
team has had its best start in
decades and maintained a winning
record.
Athletics Director Ted Leland
said the number of season tickets
sold this year is 2,500 less than
last year, although there has been
some increase in day-of-game
sales.
The Oregon State game last
Saturday had only 30,655 specta


Leland
tors, making it one of the five least
attended home games in the past
10 years. However, attendance
was "not substantially worse"
than the last time Stanford played
Oregon State, Leland said.
"We had two bad years in a row
. . . and a schedule with all the
home games clustered together in
an inconvenient way," Leland
explained. He also noted that
added television exposure, while
"good for the program" may have
kept down attendance.
Davis added, however, that the
entire Pacific-10 Conference has

been experiencing lower atten
dance at football games this year.
"This is not just a Stanford
problem," he said. "The only team
that sells out is Washington."
Herb Benengson, associate
director of media relations at UC-
Berkeley's Athletic Department,
confirmed that Cal is experiencing
similar problems.
While the Athletic Depart
ment is anxious to sell the
remaining tickets, Davis said no
tickets will be sold at lower than
the regular price, which is $35
for students.
At the Oregon State game, stu
dents who came to the ticket gate
were able to buy Big Game tickets
for $25, but there will be no such
reduction in the price of tickets

that are not part of a package
deal.
"[Discount sales] wouldn't be
fair to people who bought season
tickets," he said. If bought as part
of a season package, Big Game
tickets are $17 for students, a lit
tle less than half the regular price.
If there were discount sales, he
added, "next year, people will say
'why buy season tickets when
they'll cave in on the Big Game
tickets anyway?' "
Leland said the Athletic
Department has the potential to
lose up to $200,000 on Big Game.
The game will not be moved from
its kickoff time of 12:30 p.m.,
although a change might allow for
television broadcast and associat
ed revenue, he said.
