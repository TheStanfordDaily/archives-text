Those still looking for Big
Game tickets can rest assured: It's

not too late.
The Athletic
Department
yesterday con
firmed that
there are more
than 13,000 tick
ets still available
for the game,
which will be
held in Stanford
Stadium on Nov.
18. Of those tick-

ets, 2,000 are student tickets, said
Asst. Athletics Director Charles
Davis.
Davis said the Athletic Depart
ment was "behind schedule on the
way to a sellout," and that there
were usually fewer tickets avail
able this close to the game. Part of
the problem, he said, is a wide

spread rnisperception of how fast
tickets get sold.
"People have become used to
sellouts and not being able to get
tickets, and so they don't try," he
said. However, the last time Stan
ford hosted UC-Berkeley in 1993,
the game failed to sell out, he
added.
He confirmed that this year's
unusually high rate of availability
was part of a pattern of lower than
usual attendance at Cardinal foot
ball games this season, though the
team has had its best start in
decades and maintained a winning
record.
Athletics Director Ted Leland
said the number of season tickets
sold this year is 2,500 less than
last year, although there has been
some increase in day-of-game
sales.
The Oregon State game last
Saturday had only 30,655 specta
