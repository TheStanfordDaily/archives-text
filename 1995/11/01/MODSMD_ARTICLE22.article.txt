## A 						few Halloween treats 
### 
THE BEACHES I once frequented
slowly gain distance from my heart
and the old hobby of treasure hunt
ing is getting nastier than most of the
forks my trusty metal detector unearthed.
I sold my metal detector and set of junior
golf clubs to a Portuguese ex-con who
took his snake around with him every
where to complement his biblical tattoos.
Though no longer the beachcomber of
my youth, my ability to sense when some
thing can be found still occupies a central
place in my personality. Unfortunately,
so does my habit of loss. But I don't see
my lost-and-foundness as unique or
bounded within me. It is more that I am
a human portal for a remarkable phe
nomenon of energy. There is, as I'm sure
most of you know, a certain vortex where
things go to be lost and found, a meta
physical spot with its own peculiar flow
and vibe. Somehow, the currents of this
super-sensible spring flow through me
with eerie frequency. When this happens,
my mind becomes a "lost and found" bul
letin board.
The notices vary in scope. Some relate to
physic<d goods, others to spiritual bonds.
Either I have been extremely sensitive late
ly, or activity in this realm has been increas
ing, or both. As Halloween approached, I
have been very much involved with this
lost-and-found talent / curse.

Eor instance, I found an old freshman
dorm RA knocking around the Rose and
Crown. He's been very successful since
graduating — a quick tour in the Peace
Corps netted him a beautiful case of
syphilis. I passed by him and sidled up to
the bar, since he was busy trying to get a
Donnerite to skip the high-priced well
drinks and slide out to his car to drink
Ernie's Vodka. I guess the old RAin him
hasn't faded yet.
At the bar, I found the reincarnation
of Iceland Jr., so upset by the sacrilegious
stomping at the Mausoleum as to have no
control over the rising fury within his
spirit that had long ago pushed him over
the brink of incontinence. I decided to
take him to a scene more suitable — the
Synergy party.
On the way, I found a Poli-Sci reader
some poor person had lost. The interest
ing thing about it was this pencil
scrawled verse on the front cover: "Life
is so operose / I'm so morose/Not yet
lachrymose / But very gross." I present
ed it to a hysterical pre-med I had
bumped into at the Oval who secretly
whispered in my ear that she had lost all
direction and had nowhere to go with her
life. I laughed.
At Synergy, Junior lost himself among
his kind — nymphs and thcannobolic
hierophants unrestricted by the complete

absence of any curate of mental order.
They were completely lost — and found.
Leaving Synergy and Junior behind, I
found an unplayed scratch-off lottery
ticket while prowling outside the Hoover
House (where I next went), but lost.
A shooting star led me to an a cappella
singer caterwauling away, an obvious
sign that this person I was meant to find.
This person soon after lost (his life).
Finding a mixture of blood and pus on
my tooth paste, 1 lost control and rashly
had a temper tantrum so violent that I
had an out-of-body experience. I saw my
physical self, unproductively occupied.
Floating around over campus and deep
into the Santa Cruz mountains, I found a
very redwood-influenced geographically
specific moral insight. It is, however, too
profound to print here. If you would like
to learn more about it, seek a personal
audience with me. I promise you won't
lose anything you shouldn't or already
haven't.
Other things found: gypsum, a weight
belt, the next Dalai Lama, Jimi H&ndrix's
air guitar. Ix)st: a lighter, four pounds of
water weight, humanity, Stanford's
chance to host extraterrestrials.
