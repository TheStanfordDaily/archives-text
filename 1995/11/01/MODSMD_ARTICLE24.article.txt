## Genitals, gender roles and the femme phallus

being is either a man or a woman. . . .

Theory of Sexuality
My friend Matthew likes to think of
his penis as a female.
It's tweaked but true. When he disem
bodies his member in his mind, when he
separates it as a character and gives it a
pronoun, he doesn't say "he," but "she."
And when lie gives it a name, lie doesn't
say Spike or Dave or Buster or Dirk or
Heinrich or Chutzpah — he calls her
Harriet.
Yup, though thoroughly heterosexual,
though a burly, buff, dirt-eating, football
playing, six-foot-tall, testes-bearing,
manly-man with an upstanding and long
term girlfriend, Matt finds that he is
most at ease with his sexuality when he
thinks of his dingy in female terms.
Aberrant, you say? Unnatural and
confused and brimming with dualistic
deviance?
Well . . . you're right. It is kind of odd
and a little crass, so I'll try to be delicate.
But hey, we're talking about a penis
here. Not a car or a motorcycle or a power
drill or some other random technosymbol

for male virility — we're talking about
the actual article.
The penis; the neener: the one thing
that represents manhood in its truest
form.
And he calls her Harriet.
I must say that, when he recently
admitted this to me, my reaction was
probably much like yours must be right
now. "Matt," I said, "you're a freak.
Here's the number of my brother's ther
apist — call, she's excellent."
But then I stopped. And I took a
moment to ponder this, to see if perhaps
there was some propitious potential in
this seemingly perplexed peeper. And I
wondered if — again, perhaps — this
wasn't as odd an oddity as I might have
first thunk.
After all, in the puppet show of pas
sion that is sex, there are a whole bunch
of games we play where body parts are
named or conversationally disembodied:
"He wants to play." "He's glad to see
you." "I just don't know what's wrong
with Mr. Hooey today."
We all do it. So what should be the
problem with a simple switch from the he
to the she?
As far as I can tell, my friend's femi
nized nomenclature is not all that unlike
feminist renderings of certain prayer ser
vices. Some women find they can't pray

to a masculine god and can't connect with
a service so long as He remains a he. But
with a similar simple switch to a She
turning the King of the Universe into the
Queen — they suddenly find themselves,
often for the first time, able to connect
with the notion of a deity.
So, just as these women find they can't
be spiritually receptive to a god until they
recognize the femininity in the divine, my
friend Matt finds he can't be sexually
receptive to a woman until he recognizes
the femininity in his phallus.
It kind of responds to a complaint my
brother once had about how exclusive he
finds the term "member" as synonym for
penis: "It makes it sound like it's some
kind of a club,"he said. "What if I don't
wanna join?"
"Don't," says my friend Matthew with
the female penis.
It didn't even take all that long before
Matt and I found an etymological prece
dent for his condition. We soon learned,
for example, that in French the word for
penis is a indeed a female noun, la pine.
(Incidentally, the word for breast — le
sein — is masculine.) So I started think
ing, hey, since French is commonly
thought of as the language d'amour,
could it be that my friend Matt and his
femme phallus have hit on some ancient
insight here? Could Harriet actually be

the first stage in a revival of an arcane
bond between the sexes?
Ironically, it was Matt's girlfriend who
made the key connection here and verified
my suspicions. When I asked her if she had
a problem with his willie being a woman,
her answer cleared up everything. "Are
you kidding?" she said. "With Harriet I
can explore my bisexuality without ever
leaving or hurting the man I love."
A strange and disturbing thought
occurred to me when she said this: With
all the combinations made possible by a
gynepickle, is it possible that the brutish
wiener is completely outclassed by the
more versatile shener? Could it be that
the womanly winkie is the way to go? The
benefits to the bearer are indisputable.
Think: For Matt, every sexual
encounter can be something of a menage a
trois. When he's got a partner, he can
indulge in a whole slew of lesbian fantasies
without her even knowing. Even when he's
at it alone, there is always a girl around.
And besides, in this higgledy-piggledy
world where communication between the
sexes is limited to grunts and wheezes
and pop-psych books (see: "Women Are
From Mars, Men Have A Penis") how
wonderful it is that someone can claim
enough inner-diversity to declare:
"Hoorah! My penis is a lesbian."
You see, for Matt, the switch isn't just

an empty name-game played to spice up a
sex life by creating a metaphor for his
desires. It adds something. It allows him
to bring into the act another character,
another part of himself — one otherwise
unrepresented by a uterus or breasts.
It allows, as we say here at Stanford,
"for an expansion of his gender identity."
Of course, if we started looking at him
in Freudian terms, we'd find ourselves
amidst a caboodle of confusion. For,
according to sweet Sigmund, Matt's
dinger, as a girl, should be jealous of him
for possessing a male organ — that is, itself
— thus carrying us into a whole new realm
of meta-envy as yet unheard of. (Clod, if
only being a psych major wast his cool.)
But this is not our concern. Under
standing is. Now, I'm not suggesting that
my friend Matthew with the female penis
has solved the problem of the gender bar
rier. And I don't think he is so dedicated
to understanding the feminine form that
one day he'll try to parallel the experience
of childbirth by passing a Life Saver
through his urethra or anything like that
— at least I hope he won't.
But he is making an effort. And, some
how, thanks to his deviance, the distance
'twixt the sexes seems shorter to me now.
For this I thank him.
And Harriet.

all the combinations made possible by a
gynepickle, is it possible that the brutish
wiener is completely outclassed by the
more versatile shener? Could it be that
the womanly winkie is the way to go? The
benefits to the bearer are indisputable.
Think: For Matt, every sexual
encounter can be something of a menage a
trois. When he's got a partner, he can
indulge in a whole slew of lesbian fantasies
without her even knowing. Even when he's
at it alone, there is always a girl around.
And besides, in this higgledy-piggledy
world where communication between the
sexes is limited to grunts and wheezes
and pop-psych books (see: "Women Are
From Mars, Men Have A Penis") how
wonderful it is that someone can claim
enough inner-diversity to declare:
"Hoorah! My penis is a lesbian."
You see, for Matt, the switch isn't just

an empty name-game played to spice up a
sex life by creating a metaphor for his
desires. It adds something. It allows him
to bring into the act another character,
another part of himself — one otherwise
unrepresented by a uterus or breasts.
It allows, as we say here at Stanford,
"for an expansion of his gender identity."
Of course, if we started looking at him
in Freudian terms, we'd find ourselves
amidst a caboodle of confusion. For,
according to sweet Sigmund, Matt's
dinger, as a girl, should be jealous of him
for possessing a male organ — that is, itself
— thus carrying us into a whole new realm
of meta-envy as yet unheard of. (Clod, if
only being a psych major wast his cool.)
But this is not our concern. Under
standing is. Now, I'm not suggesting that
my friend Matthew with the female penis
has solved the problem of the gender bar
rier. And I don't think he is so dedicated
to understanding the feminine form that
one day he'll try to parallel the experience
of childbirth by passing a Life Saver
through his urethra or anything like that
— at least I hope he won't.
But he is making an effort. And, some
how, thanks to his deviance, the distance
'twixt the sexes seems shorter to me now.
For this I thank him.
And Harriet.

My friend Matthew likes to think of
his penis as a female.
It's tweaked but true. When he disem
bodies his member in his mind, when he
separates it as a character and gives it a
pronoun, he doesn't say "he," but "she."
And when lie gives it a name, lie doesn't
say Spike or Dave or Buster or Dirk or
Heinrich or Chutzpah — he calls her
Harriet.
Yup, though thoroughly heterosexual,
though a burly, buff, dirt-eating, football
playing, six-foot-tall, testes-bearing,
manly-man with an upstanding and long
term girlfriend, Matt finds that he is
most at ease with his sexuality when he
thinks of his dingy in female terms.
Aberrant, you say? Unnatural and
confused and brimming with dualistic
deviance?
Well . . . you're right. It is kind of odd
and a little crass, so I'll try to be delicate.
But hey, we're talking about a penis
here. Not a car or a motorcycle or a power
drill or some other random technosymbol

for male virility — we're talking about
the actual article.
The penis; the neener: the one thing
that represents manhood in its truest
form.
And he calls her Harriet.
I must say that, when he recently
admitted this to me, my reaction was
probably much like yours must be right
now. "Matt," I said, "you're a freak.
Here's the number of my brother's ther
apist — call, she's excellent."
But then I stopped. And I took a
moment to ponder this, to see if perhaps
there was some propitious potential in
this seemingly perplexed peeper. And I
wondered if — again, perhaps — this
wasn't as odd an oddity as I might have
first thunk.
After all, in the puppet show of pas
sion that is sex, there are a whole bunch
of games we play where body parts are
named or conversationally disembodied:
"He wants to play." "He's glad to see
you." "I just don't know what's wrong
with Mr. Hooey today."
We all do it. So what should be the
problem with a simple switch from the he
to the she?
As far as I can tell, my friend's femi
nized nomenclature is not all that unlike
feminist renderings of certain prayer ser
vices. Some women find they can't pray

to a masculine god and can't connect with
a service so long as He remains a he. But
with a similar simple switch to a She
turning the King of the Universe into the
Queen — they suddenly find themselves,
often for the first time, able to connect
with the notion of a deity.
So, just as these women find they can't
be spiritually receptive to a god until they
recognize the femininity in the divine, my
friend Matt finds he can't be sexually
receptive to a woman until he recognizes
the femininity in his phallus.
It kind of responds to a complaint my
brother once had about how exclusive he
finds the term "member" as synonym for
penis: "It makes it sound like it's some
kind of a club,"he said. "What if I don't
wanna join?"
"Don't," says my friend Matthew with
the female penis.
It didn't even take all that long before
Matt and I found an etymological prece
dent for his condition. We soon learned,
for example, that in French the word for
penis is a indeed a female noun, la pine.
(Incidentally, the word for breast — le
sein — is masculine.) So I started think
ing, hey, since French is commonly
thought of as the language d'amour,
could it be that my friend Matt and his
femme phallus have hit on some ancient
insight here? Could Harriet actually be

the first stage in a revival of an arcane
bond between the sexes?
Ironically, it was Matt's girlfriend who
made the key connection here and verified
my suspicions. When I asked her if she had
a problem with his willie being a woman,
her answer cleared up everything. "Are
you kidding?" she said. "With Harriet I
can explore my bisexuality without ever
leaving or hurting the man I love."
