The line to sign up for Communication Department
seminars may be longer than usual this winter quarter
when a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist comes to
Stanford as a vLsiting professor.
Ellen Goodman, an associate editor and columnist
for the Boston Globe, will join the Communication
Department as the first Lorry I. Lokey Visiting Pro
fessor in Professional Journalism. She will lead a
seminar titled "Telling People What to Think,"
focusing on how journalists use the power of the
press.
The Lokey Professorship is funded by a 1993
pledge from Lorry Ixjkey, founder and president of
Business Wire, who also donated $1.6 million to the
program.
Goodman said she plans to instruct the 16 students
who enroll in the seminar on opinion writing, criticism
and column writing. She will also help students develop
a voice and form their own views.
"You first have to think, to tell people what you
think," Goodman said.

Goodman has won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary
and has also been a Nieinan Fellow at Harvard Univer
sity. Goodman's many accolades were not, however, the
sole reason for her selection.
According to Dale Maharidge, a lecturer in the
Communication Department and Goodman's main
solicitor, the University was looking for a good com
municator. "She is a marvelous lecturer," he said.
Goodman's passion as a teacher, her freshness as a
columnist, as well as her status as a leading journalist
were among the qualities Maharidge cited. "She has a
great sense of humor, too," he added.
Goodman, who graduated from Radcliffe College,
began her journalism career as a researcher for
Newsweek at a time when women were not permitted
to do reporting. She moved to the Detroit Free Press
and then to the Globe in 1967, where she reported on
the women's movement.
Her struggle to rise through the journalistic ranks
coincidi*d with the battle for sexual equality in that field
and the workplace in general.
While teaching at Stanford, Goodman, who is the
author of six books, will continue writing her column.
