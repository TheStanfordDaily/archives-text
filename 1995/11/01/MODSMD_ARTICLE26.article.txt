Us giraffes, I have uncovered the
truth about Frisbees.
It turns out that the only way
toy companies can keep the
lucrative flying disc industry
alive is to force people to con
stantly lose them. To accomplish
this task, they have developed
Frisbees which have elaborate
tree, roof and dog detectors to
ensure that you can't get more
than two minutes of use out of
them.
OK, so I lied. I got all that
information from Oliver Stone
when he visited last week.
Actually, it's not your fault
that your Frisbee starts tilting
every time you throw it. Even
after decades of flying disc
research and development, sci
entists have yet to develop Fris
bees that won't tilt during flight.
But first, before I can tell you
how to fix your throw, you have
to read about how a Frisbee
works. You see, the Science Bug
column is a forum for learning. I
am required to put something
educational in every column,
even if I do make it up.
A flying disc creates lift in
much the same way an airplane
wing does. Air flowing over the
curved top of the disc travels a
longer distance in the same
amount of time as does air flow
ing underneath the disc. This
means that the air flowing over
the disc is going faster than the
air flowing under the disc.
According to Bernoulli's Law,
t he faster moving air exerts less
pressure on the disc than the
slower moving air under the
disc. This difference in pressure
pushes the disc upwards, coun
teracting the pull of gravity.
Interestingly, creating a little
bit of turbulence over the Fris
bee helps to enhance this effect.
That's why Frisbees have sets of
raised rings on their upper sur

face. Similarly, airplane wings
have little bumps on them called
ailerons which perform a similar
function. Of course, the ailerons
only produce small turbulence
effects, not the plane-shaking
variety that seems to occur only
when you arc in the tiny bath
room at the rear of the plane.
Besides the lift generated by
the pressure differences above
and below the disc, Bernoulli's
Law also applit?s to the sides of
the disc. Imagine a forward
moving disc, spinning clockwise
as viewed from above. On one
side of the disc, the air flows
with the rim, whereas on the
opposite side, the rim moves
against the flow of the air. This
idso causes a speed difference in
the air flow and the result is
that, if you throw right-handed,
the Frisbee drifts to the right.
Besides acting like an air
plane wing, a Frisbee also shares
characteristics with gyroscopes
and spinning tops. The rotation
al motion of a Frisbee con
tributes much to its stability, as
evidenced by the fact that a non
spinning Frisbee has the aerody
namic qualities of a dead cow.
Like a top. a flying disc is much
more stable when it is spinning
rapidly.
By giving the Frisbee spin
when you throw it, you give it a
significant amount of angular
momentum. Similar to linear
momentum, angular momen
tum keeps the Frisbee spinning
in the same plane.
The Frisbee's angular
momentum plays a large role
in the tilting effect. Even in the
most well-designed Frisbees,
more lift is generated at the
back of the Frisbee than at the
front. This is a result of the
complex air flow patterns
caused by the rim of the Fris
bee and is very difficult to fix.
The upward force at the rear
causes the spinning Frisbee to
tilt over on its side.
The reason many people
can't throw Frisbees is because
they believe that if they release
the Frisbee level, it will stay
level throughout the flight.
Instead, what you should do is
tilt the Frisbee slightly to the
left when you are putting clock
wise spin on it and to the right
for counterclockwise spin.
I think Oliver called it the
magic Frisbee theory.
