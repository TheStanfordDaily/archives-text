# 'I just don't like doing what other people are doing'
## Discovering the offbeat with Perl 
### Jennifer Kao 
Martin Perl's door looks like all
the others at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) —
except for some newspaper clip
pings about his newly awarded
Nobel prize.
His office also seems normal —
books, a dry-erase board, a chalk
board covered with diagrams.
Then you notice the giant bou
quets on his file cabinet.
The fact is that Perl is far from
ordinary. The story of his career
is one of offbeat but insightful
decisions. "I just don't like doing
what other people are doing," he
said of himself. For him, this just
"feels more free."
Perl's Nobel prize-winning dis
covery of the tau lepton resulted
from just such an offbeat attitude.
He said that "everyone was look
ing carefully at the complicated
events coming out of SPEAR
(Stanford Position-Election Asym
metric Ring) — at that time,
SLAC's new ring-shaped collider.
So, I decided to look at the simple
ones — the two track events."
These "two-track events" were
particle collisions that seemed to
produce two leptons, an electron
and a muon.
Leptons are particles which are
unaffected by the "strong" force
that glues protons and neutrons
into atomic nuclei. Muons, more
massive cousins of the electron,
decay to produce electrons. Perl
reasoned that an even heavier lep
ton could decay to produce such
two-track events.
His discovery of this tau —
Greek for third — lepton took
place over a period of a single
month in 1974. There were 24
events, or sightings of the tau. In
comparison, Perl will
soon work in a project
studying the tau at
Cornell which will have lj
5 million events. He
said his actual realization was
gradual. "It just fit," he explained.
Peri's history exemplifies his
love affair with the offbeat. He
was only 16 years old when he
graduated from high school, a feat
that was easier when he was
young, he said, because people
weren't as concerned about their
social lives.
Perl attended the Polytechnic
Institute in Brooklyn as an under
graduate. Most college students
then trained to be doctors,
lawyers, and accountants —
much like students now.
But a career in engineering, at
that time, was something differ
ent. So Perl majored in chemical
engineering and graduated
summa cum laude.
After graduation, General
Electric hired him, and Perl began
work in a job that was, at that
time, "a lot like working for the
civil service. You had a job for
life."
Although his parents were
happy about the job, Perl was
aching for more than just securi
ty. After a few years, he went back
to school, attending Columbia's
graduate school physics program.
"You can't do that sort of thing
now," Perl said. "At that time, I

had only had some elementary
physics." For the first time, Perl
found "my first dose of people
smarter than me."
Even though Perl has always
"tended to do the different
things," he admitted that in tech
nology, "what everyone is work
ing on is usually right," and that
"most out of the way ideas are bad
ideas." The trick of
working on unusual
ideas is knowing when £ *
to stop. M /
Right now, Perl and
his research team are
looking for free quarks — sub
atomic particles left over from the
beginnings of the universe.
These particles will probably
be completely different from
those of the three presently

known particle families.
If the team can find these
quarks, members hope their
behavior can tell even more about
how the universe is put together.
How do you find a free quark?
"We're starting with dif
ferent size oil drops, _ _
then mercury," Perl I
said. "Others say moon *\j
dust or the bottom of the k
ocean."
Knowing the right time to stop,
for Perl, is simply recognizing
when he's done all he can do.
There are "plenty of other smart
people, and technology gets better
and better," he said. If he cannot
find free quarks, Perl expects that
someone in the future will.
Perl has said in the past that
discovery "is a social thing with

statistical fluctuations about who
does it."
"Einstein did three great
things," he noted. "If he hadn't, it
would have had to be done by
three different people, but it
would have been done." Of his
own discovery, Perl says that the
tau lepton would have been found
"within five years."
In fact, Perl doesn't like the
idea of heroes in science at all. He
said he is always surprised by the
idea, insisting that it is "confusing
for young people."
Comparing success in science
to success in business, Perl said
that when there are 100 qualified
people starting out in business,
there is some random
ness which determines mm
who rises to the top. LS
Factors like financial
status, genes and luck
all play a role. Science
isn't any different.
In the future, Perl has plenty
to keep him busy. He will be
developing a new accelerator at
SLAC, a B-factory similar to the
one at Cornell. This new project
will take some time, he said. The
first data will not be ready until
the year 2000.
Does a man like Perl have time
for anything besides physics?
Added to the list of family and
music, Perl continues with his off
beat approach to life through an
avid interest in toys.
He has actually designed a
wooden construction toy called
"Big Nut," which unfortunately,
was too expensive to manufac
ture.
However, his philosophy of life
comes through during a casual dis
cussion of his favorite authors —
Dickens, Trollope and Bennett.
"When you're young, you read
to find out what's ahead of you,"
he said. "When you're old, you
look for authors with unique
insight. But you don't read as pre
dictor. Not anymore."
