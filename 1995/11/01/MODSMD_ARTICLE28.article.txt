Martin Perl, in his search for the third family of quarks, decided to
collide positrons and electrons. These collisions often resulted in
two-track events, the production of a muon and an electron. Perl
then theorized the existence of an undiscovered, more massive lep
ton that he called the tau, which decayed to produce these two
lighter leptons.
