# Newsflash: Media hype undermines scientific research
##

Petri dishes. Test tubes. The scent of
formaldehyde. Clusters of professionals
in long, white lab coats working diligent
ly and speaking an incomprehensible
language of "-oligies" and "-isms."
Is this what the average person envi
sions when he thinks of scientific
research? A separate world, divorced
from the rest of society?
This common stereotype of scientific
research concerns many in the scientific
world, and some are quick to point the
finger of blame at the media. They claim
that journalists who cover science-relat
ed issues often hype up the news in
order to capture public attention, there
by presenting a skewed view of scientific
research.
Traditionally, the media's scientific
coverage has focused heavily on areas of
research that have impacted our nation
in tangible ways. Among the areas that
have attracted such attention is genetic
technology, in which recent break
throughs have not only identified the
specific genes responsible for a myriad
of diseases, but have also spurred many
to believe that personality and homosex
uality could have biological determi
nants.
Has the power of genetic research
been over-exaggerated? Many scientists
said they feel that it has.
Although genetic technology has been

somewhat successful at treating certain
biochemical disorders, gene therapy is
far from being able to reliably cure dis
eases. "Gene therapy is a very important
area of research," said Neil Risch, pro
fessor of genetics. "But it is very differ
ent from understanding the biological
mechanisms behind

diseases."
In theory, the moti
vation behind gene
therapy is quite sim
ple: Locate the gene
that is defective and
replace it with the cor
rect version. However,
delivering an effective
gene into a dysfunc
tional system requires
that it he incorporated
into the appropriate

tissues while avoiding negative reac
tions with uninvolved tissues — a chal
lenge that remains largely insurmount
able.
Risch believes that the media and the
scientific community both contribute to
the public's overly optimistic percep
tions of genetic research and its poten
tial benefits. "There's often pressure on
scientists from reporters to overstate or
exaggerate their findings. The media
may not be interested unless it's flashy,"
Risch said.
In some cases, however, it is the sci
entists who are exaggerating their own
results. "Biotechnology companies want

more than the public's attention — they
want the investors' attention,"
explained Sally Lehrman, a San Francis
co Examiner science reporter and one of
this year's recipients of the Knight Fel
lowship, a program in which journalists
are invited to spend a year at Stanford
pursuing studies in their field of inter
est.
"The whole influence of the business
environment has changed the way scien
tists report their accomplishments,"
Lehrman explained. She noted that
researchers who face business pressure
are often forced to "present their work
as moving very quickly and having a lot
of potential," although in reality most
scientific research is painstakingly slow.
Despite the economic motive that
propels many biotechnology firms to
advertise their findings, Risch believes
that on the whole, scientists — especial
ly those in academia — need to make
efforts to increase communication with
the public. "Scientists tend to focus on
their research and don't pay too much
attention to the sociopolitical impact of
their work," he said. "Most scientists
live in an 'ivory tower' world, divorced
from the rest of the public."
Another area of research where
potential benefits were heralded prema
turely is artificial intelligence (AI), a
subdivision of computer science which
aims to design machines capable of per
forming human intellectual functions.
Early work in artificial intelligence

consisted of programming computers to
do geometric proofs, play chess, solve
logic puzzles and perform other mathe
matically related tasks. "I don't think
the media paid much attention to AI
until the 19605, when people started
building programs to do integral calcu
lus," said Nils Nilsson, professor of com
puter science with a specialization in
artificial intelligence and robotics.
And then the expert systems arrived
on the scene in the late 19605.
In contrast to earlier AI programs
which used a more generalized problem
solving approach, expert systems were
designed to solve very specific, complex
problems. One of the first AI develop
ments to have real social application was
a program created by Stanford Prof.
Edward Feigenbaum, which enabled
computers to diagnose various blood
infections as well as physicians could.
"When they started building expert
systems, the media rushed in," said
Nilsson. Unfortunately, journalists
often depicted the field of artificial intel
ligence as advancing further and faster
than it really was.
Articles in various magazines and
newspapers led many to believe that
computers could soon be made to do
almost anything that humans could. In
reality, however, many of these expert
systems were far from being "expert" in
what they could accomplish.
"Because a lot of these systems didn't
do well outside their specific area, there

was some frustration," explained Nils
son. "AI systems were hyped up quite a
bit, but didn't deliver."
Does this mean the media should be
blamed for warping the public's view of
scientific progress? Or have scientists
simply been too far removed from soci
ety for the public to really understand
the mysterious process of laboratory
research?
"The average scientist is likely to
spend the majority of his time with col
leagues and scientists. That's the fate of
any highly specialized profession," said
Robert McGinn, professor and acting
chair of the Science, Technology and
Society Department.
This makes the science reporter's job
an increasingly difficult one. "Keeping
up with science itself is a big challenge,"
admitted Lehrman. "As a reporter,
you're not trying to pump up the truth.
We see our job as interpreting and ana
lyzing scientific progress for the public."
Lehrman feels that her main task is to
"explain what the research is and search
for some way to connect it to the read
er."
McGinn agreed that more efforts are
needed to bring science to the public in a
more down-to-earth manner. He empha
sized that science should be portrayed
not "as an otherworldly, disembodied
product of textbooks, but as a human,
cultural form of activity, subject to all
the good and practical aspects of any
other human activity."
