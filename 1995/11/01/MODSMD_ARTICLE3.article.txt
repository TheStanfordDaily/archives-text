# Clinton wins in mock election

In a mock election held yesterday in White Plaza,
President Clinton was re-elected by a large margin.
Gen. Colin Powell placed second, followed by Sen.
Bob Dole with a distant third in the polling, which
was organized by a new student group called the Mod
erate Majority.
While the Clinton victory may not be surprising in
consideration of students' typical political leanings,
the balloting did produce some interesting results.
While Clinton received 46.4 percent and Powell gar
nered 24.4 percent, Dole, the GOP front-runner, fin
ished in a distant third place, with 5.1 percent of the
vote. An assortment of other candidates captured the
remaining votes.
Ballot tabulator Ur Jaddou, chair of Stanford in
Government (SIG), said the results did reveal some
intriguing indications about the political climate at
Stanford.
"The Democrats did not win by a landslide like you
would assume on a college campus," she said. Al
though the margin of victory for Clinton was sub
stantial, the results of past elections here at Stanford
and the political tendencies associated with universi
ties in general would have predicted even larger wins
for Democrats, she said.
In a 1992 campus-wide poll conducted by The


Matthew Lawrence â€” Daily
Even Foghorn Leghorn (really sophomore Joel Fosnaugh) tried to vote at the mock
election yesterday in White Plaza.
Daily, 71 percent of respondents
said they would vote for Clinton
while only 11 percent said they
would vote for President Bush.
Moderate Majority president
Danny Bramzon cited Powell's rel
atively high numbers as a factor for

Clinton's loss of support. Powell';
strong showing on a traditionally
liberal college campus has impor
tant implications for the 1996 race
Bramzon said.
"Colin Powell represents some
one whose beliefs are in line wit!
those of the majority of Americans
He is socially progressive and inter
nationally and economically con
servative," he said.
Based on the mock electior

results, Bramzon speculated that
"if Powell runs behind a Republi
can banner, it'd be a very close race
with Clinton."
Powell was not originally slated
to 1m- a choice on the ballot because
he has not yet declared himself a
candidate. Election organizers,
however, decided to include his
name because of hints that he will
formally announce his campaign
this month. Ross Perot, who

recently gained enough petition
signatures to be placet! on the Cali
fornia ballot, was also on the ballot
in the mock presidential race.
In another race on the mock bal
lot, for House of Representatives,
incumbent Anna Eshoo, D-Stan
ford, received 74 of the vote com
pared to Republican Ben Brink,
who earned 26 percent. An analysis
of the ballots, however, showed
that support for Powell came from

both Eshoo and Brink voters.
The mock election, co-sponsored
by Stanford in Government, was
meant to raise political awareness
on the campus. A total of 218 stu
dents, or 1.8 percent of the student
body, participated in the election.
Despite the low turnout, orga
nizers hope to see greater partici
pation when they hold a second
mock election in March, prior to
the California primary race.
