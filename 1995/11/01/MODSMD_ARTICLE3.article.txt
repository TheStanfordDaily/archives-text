In a mock election held yesterday in White Plaza,
President Clinton was re-elected by a large margin.
Gen. Colin Powell placed second, followed by Sen.
Bob Dole with a distant third in the polling, which
was organized by a new student group called the Mod
erate Majority.
While the Clinton victory may not be surprising in
consideration of students' typical political leanings,
the balloting did produce some interesting results.
While Clinton received 46.4 percent and Powell gar
nered 24.4 percent, Dole, the GOP front-runner, fin
ished in a distant third place, with 5.1 percent of the
vote. An assortment of other candidates captured the
remaining votes.
Ballot tabulator Ur Jaddou, chair of Stanford in
Government (SIG), said the results did reveal some
intriguing indications about the political climate at
Stanford.
"The Democrats did not win by a landslide like you
would assume on a college campus," she said. Al
though the margin of victory for Clinton was sub
stantial, the results of past elections here at Stanford
and the political tendencies associated with universi
ties in general would have predicted even larger wins
for Democrats, she said.
