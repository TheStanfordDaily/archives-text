## No stopping Stanford's Cary Wendell Player of the Year set to guide Stanford volleyball to promised land 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
When Cary Wendell is on
the volleyball court, good
things happen. Cardinal coach
Don Shaw and Stanford
women's volleyball fans have
been enjoying those good
things for the past four years
that Wendell has been on the
Farm.
Wendell, a senior, has
amassed a long list of honors
in her collegiate career, includ
ing being named Volleyball
magazine's National Player of
the Year in 1994 after leading
the Cardinal to its second
NCAA championship in three
years. This year, Wendell is
enjoying another great season
leading Stanford to a 20-2
record Her talents have met
every expectation Shaw had of
Wendell when she arrived four
years ago.
"We did think she was going
to he outstanding, but you
never know," Shaw said. "The
change from high school and
club to college volleyball is
pretty big, so you can't predict.
But with her knowledge and
ability, we knew she would do
well. We didn't know which
skill she would be best at — it
turned out to be all of them."
Her versatility is apparent

when she is on the court and shows
up all over the stat sheets. This
year, Wendell has reached double
figures in kills, set assists and digs
in eight out of 19 matches. To put
that accomplishment in perspec
tive, Wendell has eight of the 26
triple-doubles recorded in the
nation by Division I players this
year. Only one other player has as
many as two this season. All of
Wendell's triple-doubles have come
against ranked opponents.
Shaw attributes Wendell's on
court prowess to a combination of
qualities. "It is the intangibles that
make her a better player than oth
ers," he said. "She's not the most
physical player, but she has quick
hands and great hand-eye coordi
nation and reaction time. It's those
little things that make the differ
ence."
Wendell had (he benefit of grow

ing up watching volleyball, as both
of her parents and her sister play
the sport. She also has the advan
tage of getting tips and advice from
her family.
"My parents have been watch
ing high-level volleyball since I was
in the seventh grade," Wendell
said. "They know a lot about the
game and give me lots of input and
observations. They never push
their coaching on me because they
know I know the game, but some
times I joke about them being
Coach Wendell."
On the court, Wendell's knowl
edge of the game is an asset that
Shaw appreciates. "She's always
thinking two steps ahead," Shaw
said. "She's so valuable in so many
ways."
The Cardinal's offensive system
takes advantage of the abilities of
Wendell and sophomore setter Lisa
Sharpley. "We run a 6-2, where all
six players are hitters and we have
two setters," Shaw explained. "It
takes advantage of Cary and Lisa,
who are all-around volleyball play

ers. Cary am hit, set and serve verv
well."
Wendell can also block. She pro
vided a block assist on match point
of last year's title match against
UCLA. Seeking a third national
championship in her final year at
Stanford, Wendell said the fact
that the Cardinal has won in the
past relieves rather than adds pres
sure.
"Having won two titles already,
there is not a monkey on my back,
I'm not thinking, 'We have to win.
This is my last chance,' " Wendell
said. "I know what it takes to win.
Also, from sophomore year (when
the top-ranked Cardinal was elimi
nated from the NCAA tournament
by UCLA), I know what it feels like
to (Mid a year with a loss. That will
be a huge motivational factor for
me."
Afler her college career, Wen
dell will still play volleyball, with
her motivation being the 2000
Olympic Games. Wendell has
played with the U.S. National
Team in several international com

petitions and was recently offered
an extended try-out with the team,
which she declined in order to con
centrate on the Cardinal's cam
paign. She will also be looking into
playing professional beach volley
ball, either in four-woman or pairs.
While Wendell said that win
ning a national championship this
season would make 1995 her best
year at Stanford, when asked to
choose the accomplishment she is
most proud of, she recalls the Car
dinal's 1992 NCAA title.
"Winning freshman year was
very special," Wendell said. "It was
Stanford's first-ever champi
onship, and we usually had five
seniors starting. I got to play a big
role in that, and it felt good helping
them win. They deserved to win."
In search of a third national
championship in four years, Shaw
expects that Wendell will do every
thing she can to help the Cardinal
to another title.
As long as Wendell is on the
court, Shaw expects good things
like that to keep happening.

change from high school and
club to college volleyball is
pretty big, so you can't predict.
But with her knowledge and
ability, we knew she would do
well. We didn't know which
skill she would be best at — it
turned out to be all of them."
Her versatility is apparent

Senior Cary Wendell leads Stanford women's volleyball's charge for back-to-back championships.
when she is on the court and shows
up all over the stat sheets. This
year, Wendell has reached double
figures in kills, set assists and digs
in eight out of 19 matches. To put
that accomplishment in perspec
tive, Wendell has eight of the 26
triple-doubles recorded in the
nation by Division I players this
year. Only one other player has as
many as two this season. All of
Wendell's triple-doubles have come
against ranked opponents.
Shaw attributes Wendell's on
court prowess to a combination of
qualities. "It is the intangibles that
make her a better player than oth
ers," he said. "She's not the most
physical player, but she has quick
hands and great hand-eye coordi
nation and reaction time. It's those
little things that make the differ
ence."
Wendell had (he benefit of grow

ing up watching volleyball, as both
of her parents and her sister play
the sport. She also has the advan
tage of getting tips and advice from
her family.
"My parents have been watch
ing high-level volleyball since I was
in the seventh grade," Wendell
said. "They know a lot about the
game and give me lots of input and
observations. They never push
their coaching on me because they
know I know the game, but some
times I joke about them being
Coach Wendell."
On the court, Wendell's knowl
edge of the game is an asset that
Shaw appreciates. "She's always
thinking two steps ahead," Shaw
said. "She's so valuable in so many
ways."
The Cardinal's offensive system
takes advantage of the abilities of
Wendell and sophomore setter Lisa
Sharpley. "We run a 6-2, where all
six players are hitters and we have
two setters," Shaw explained. "It
takes advantage of Cary and Lisa,
who are all-around volleyball play

ers. Cary am hit, set and serve verv
well."
Wendell can also block. She pro
vided a block assist on match point
of last year's title match against
UCLA. Seeking a third national
championship in her final year at
Stanford, Wendell said the fact
that the Cardinal has won in the
past relieves rather than adds pres
sure.
"Having won two titles already,
there is not a monkey on my back,
I'm not thinking, 'We have to win.
This is my last chance,' " Wendell
said. "I know what it takes to win.
Also, from sophomore year (when
the top-ranked Cardinal was elimi
nated from the NCAA tournament
by UCLA), I know what it feels like
to (Mid a year with a loss. That will
be a huge motivational factor for
me."
Afler her college career, Wen
dell will still play volleyball, with
her motivation being the 2000
Olympic Games. Wendell has
played with the U.S. National
Team in several international com

petitions and was recently offered
an extended try-out with the team,
which she declined in order to con
centrate on the Cardinal's cam
paign. She will also be looking into
playing professional beach volley
ball, either in four-woman or pairs.
While Wendell said that win
ning a national championship this
season would make 1995 her best
year at Stanford, when asked to
choose the accomplishment she is
most proud of, she recalls the Car
dinal's 1992 NCAA title.
"Winning freshman year was
very special," Wendell said. "It was
Stanford's first-ever champi
onship, and we usually had five
seniors starting. I got to play a big
role in that, and it felt good helping
them win. They deserved to win."
In search of a third national
championship in four years, Shaw
expects that Wendell will do every
thing she can to help the Cardinal
to another title.
As long as Wendell is on the
court, Shaw expects good things
like that to keep happening.
