### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
When Cary Wendell is on
the volleyball court, good
things happen. Cardinal coach
Don Shaw and Stanford
women's volleyball fans have
been enjoying those good
things for the past four years
that Wendell has been on the
Farm.
Wendell, a senior, has
amassed a long list of honors
in her collegiate career, includ
ing being named Volleyball
magazine's National Player of
the Year in 1994 after leading
the Cardinal to its second
NCAA championship in three
years. This year, Wendell is
enjoying another great season
leading Stanford to a 20-2
record Her talents have met
every expectation Shaw had of
Wendell when she arrived four
years ago.
"We did think she was going
to he outstanding, but you
never know," Shaw said. "The
change from high school and
club to college volleyball is
pretty big, so you can't predict.
But with her knowledge and
ability, we knew she would do
well. We didn't know which
skill she would be best at — it
turned out to be all of them."
Her versatility is apparent
