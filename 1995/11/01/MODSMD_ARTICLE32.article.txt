# Notre Dame throws wrench in Pac-10 football
## 
### 
It was supposed to be our year.
With Heisman candidate
Keyshawn Johnson and his
USC Trojans splattered all over
Sports Illustrated's cover of the
season preview as the No. 1 team
in the country, big-time Pacific 10
Conference college football had

resurfaced. With steam
rolling perennial title contender
Miami 29-0 in its season opener,
the Bruins sent a collective Pac
-10 message hack East. And with
Washington, national champion
in this decade, coming off of a
two-year bowl probation, it looked
as if a wild gridiron rumpus was
to take place on the West Coast.
Within three weeks of the open
ing of the season, both Stanford
and Oregon joined the Huskies
and the Trojans among the top-20
programs nationwide.
Yet, halfway through the con

ference season, it seems as if nei
ther the speed of the hare nor the
intelligence of the tortoise will
ultimately decide the outcome of
this race to the Rose Bowl. Yes,
the eventual finish will result sur
prisingly from the actions of an
innocent bystander â€” indepen
dent, if you will, of the competi
tion.
The gridiron rumblings the
Pac-10 had the potential of mak
ing in this resurgent season have
been quieted by a storied team
from the Midwest, over 2,000
miles away from Pasadena. In
their two clashes with Washing
ton and USC, the Fighting Irish
of Notre Dame essentially dictat
ed the form which this Pac-10
season would come to assume.
In early October, the Irish
traveled northwest to visit Wash
ington at home, where the
Huskies had only lost two games
out of their previous 34. Notre
Dame, dismissed from the bowl
hunt by nearly everyone after
losses to Northwestern and Ohio
State (now widely considered two
of the best teams in the country),
hung in though down late in the
game. When Damon Huard over
threw a receiver which would
have put the Huskies in field-goal
position with the game tied,
Washington presented Notre

Dame with 14 generous points
and a shocking road victory.
The Trojans journeyed across
the country two weeks ago to
finally make a statement in their
depressingly lopsided rivalry ver
sus the Irish. Proving it is no
Northwestern. USC made no
such statement as Notre Dame's
running game rushed Southern
Cal head coach John Robinson all
the way back to Los Angeles with
a 38-10 defeat, extending Irish
dominance over the Trojans to 13
consecutive wins.
With those two wins, the gen
tlemen from South Bend sealed a
fate for the Pac-10 which would
not be revealed until a week later
when the Trojans and Huskies
collided in Seattle last Saturday.
Despite being down three touch
downs, USC stormed back in the
fourth quarter to tie the game at
21, where the contest ended in
truly anticlimactic fashion.
The stalemate set the Trojans'
and Huskies' conference records
at the same 5-0-1 mark. Looking
back on the season's happenings
thus far and anticipating a Pac-10
deadlock for first place, it is clear
that those two Irish victories will
loom large in the finale of this
Pac-10 season.
After the Trojans scored their
third touchdown of the game with

just under a minute to play, coach
Robinson faced a one-point deficit
at 21-20 and a decision to kick the
extra point or attempt a two-point
conversion.
With one blemish in the loss
column already, the decision was
not very difficult. Because of their
loss to Notre Dame the previous
week, the Trojans dropped out of
contention for the national cham
pionship. Knowing full well that
the Huskies had previously fallen
prey to the Irish and Ohio State,
Robinson was cognizant of the
fact that if USC ended the Pac-10
schedule in a standoff for first
with Washington, the Trojans
would host the Rose Bowl due to a
superior overall record.
Thus, USC put the extra point
through the uprights, and barring
unforeseen circumstances, is on
its way to the Rose Bowl. Yet, if
the Trojans had taken care of
business in South Bend last week
end, they no doubt would have
attempted the two point conver
sion in order to keep their title
hopes alive.
In addition, if the Huskies had
avoided their now extremely sig
nificant unraveling at home
against Holtz and Co., they may
have forced the Trojans to go for


Courtney
Mann
the win since they would have
had the possibility of mirroring
USC's overall record and confer
ence record.
Of course, all of this specula
tion can be thrown out the win
dow with some November
magic. Washington finds itself
in yet another duel with Oregon,
and the Ducks are bitter after
having their wings clipped by
lowly Arizona State. Stanford,
fresh off its best defensive per
formance in 30 games, mav be

primed to take the big one that
has been avoiding it all season
long (see Washington, UCLA).
Yet, upsetting USC last Satur
day may have sent Washington
to Pasadena, a possibility that
would leave the Cardinal kicking
itself knowing that with some
red-zone execution, it could
have blown out the Huskies at
home.
Either way, while the Pac-10
dreamed of turning heads west
ward in search of a rosy national
crown, it was two intersectional
battles against a squad from
northwest Indiana that will
determine the next of kin for The
Granddaddy of Them All.
