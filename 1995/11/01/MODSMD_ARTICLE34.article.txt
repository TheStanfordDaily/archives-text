Pacific 2 114

Continuing one of its fiercest
rivalries, the fourth-ranked Stan
ford women's volleyball team
thrashed No. 15 Pacific last night
at Maples Pavilion, winning 15-2,
15-11, 15-4.
During their many annual bat
tles, Pacific held the upper hand
against the Cardinal throughout
the early '80s. In recent times,
however, Stanford has fought
back to take control of the series.
Last night's match was the culmi
nation of the Cardinal's recent
success, as Stanford beat the
Tigers by the largest margin in
recent memory.
"We played pretty darn well,"
said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"They've been a nemesis to us
over the years, so it's nice [to beat

them handily.]"
The story of the match, typi
fied by Stanford's complete domi
nance of game three, was the Car
dinal's strong passing comple
mented by a complete lack of
passing from the Tigers.
"When you don't pass well,"
Shaw said, "you can't attack and
you can't show the other team
anything. They didn't really pass
well tonight and I thought that
we served aggressively."
Stanford's strong passing
enabled senior setter / outside
hitter Cary Wendell and sopho
more setter / outside hitter Lisa
Sharpley to run the Cardinal's
entire offensive attack. Senior
outside hitters Wendy Hromadka
and Marnie Triefenbach repeat
edly banged down kills from the
outside and sophomore middle
blocker Barbara Ifejika and
sophomore outside hitter Kristin
Folkl were strong when Stanford
ran the middle.
"We passed well tonight, so we
could do what we [wanted] with
our offense," Shaw said. "That's
what it's about in women's vol
leyball, passing and serving. I
think this was our best serving
match of the season."
The only controversy in game
three was whether or not the Car
dinal could toss a bagel at Pacific.
Ahead 14-0, Stanford had three
chances to win the match before
the Tigers managed to score. Fol
lowing that letdown, the Cardinal
seemed to briefly lose concentra
tion. With several reserves in the
Stanford lineup, the Tigers
scored three more points before
the Cardinal finally closed out the
match with a picture-perfect
block.
Game one was about <ls domi
nant a performance as Stanford
has mustered all season. Not only
did the Cardinal race to a 15-2
victory, but the game essentially
required just one complete rota
tion. Only Wendy Hromadka
served twice for Stanford in game
one.
"We didn't start well tonight,"
said Tiger coach John Dunning.
"Because of that, it was hard to
get momentum back, especially

when playing a team like Stan
ford. What made it even harder
was our inability to pass effective
ly "
Despite his disappointment in
his team's poor start, Dunning
was quick to acknowledge Stan
ford's role in the rout.
"Stanford's very good. They're
talented and well coached. A lot of
this loss was just Stanford being
too good," he said.
The only competitive game
was game two, where several
passing errors from the Cardinal
allowed the Tigers to jump to an
8-5 lead.
At this point, as he has done
without hesitation all season,
Shaw inserted Triefenbach to the
lineup to restore some order to
the Stanford defense. Shaw's
plan worked to perfection, as
Triefenbach electrified both the
crowd and her teammates with
inspired defense and powerful
hitting.
After trailing 8-5, Stanford
scored 11 straight points to take a
14-8 lead. As was the case in
game three, however, Pacific
showed good survival instincts. A
couple of uncharacteristic hitting
errors from Triefenbach helped
the Tigers climb to within 14-11
before Stanford put the game
away.
