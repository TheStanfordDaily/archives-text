Continuing one of its fiercest
rivalries, the fourth-ranked Stan
ford women's volleyball team
thrashed No. 15 Pacific last night
at Maples Pavilion, winning 15-2,
15-11, 15-4.

"When you don't pass well,"
Shaw said, "you can't attack and

Stanford's strong passing

Sharpley to run the Cardinal's
entire offensive attack. Senior
outside hitters Wendy Hromadka
and Marnie Triefenbach repeat

outside and sophomore middle
blocker Barbara Ifejika and
sophomore outside hitter Kristin
Folkl were strong when Stanford
ran the middle.
