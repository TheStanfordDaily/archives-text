# Field hockey facing Cal in championship
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Stanford field hockey (8-5
overall, 5-1 Northern Pacific Con
ference) will square off against
California (4-8, 4-2) again today
at home for the fourth time this
season — this time, for the brag
ging rights of the NorPac title.
The Cardinal's meeting
against the Golden Bears at 3
p.m. today at the Field Hockey
Field will be a replay of last
Tuesday's game.
In last Tuesday's contest,
Stanford defeated Cal in double
overtime 1-0. That game also
decided which team would
advance to the NCAA Tourna
ment because the league ruled
before the season began that the
conference record, rather than
the championship game, would
determine which team would
head into the postseason.
Although Stanford won the
deciding confrontation for the
NCAA playoffs, the victor of
today's rematch will become the
NorPac champion and receive the
championship plaque.
Throughout the season, the
animosity between Cal and Stan
ford has been growing from
their first and only matchup in
Berkeley (a 1-0 Cal victory) to the
Cardinal's subsequent 2-0 tri
umph over the Bears at Stanford,
to last week's decisive 1-0 Cardi
nal home victory.
Cal is now hungry for

vengeance and a victory to add to
its losing record. For the last three
years, the Bears have progressed to
the NCAAs. Since Stanford has
finally earned that privilege, a Car
dinal win today would solidify its
first-place standing in the confer
ence. In addition, another win
against a Division I school could
improve Stanford's ranking for the
playoffs
"We'd really like to put Cali
fornia away once and for all,"
said Cardinal coach Sheryl John
son.
Conversely, the Bears seek a
win in the championship to con
sole them as Stanford advances.
"It should be a close game, but
we've got the momentum going,"
Johnson said. The Cardinal
returned from a road trip to St.
Louis, Mo. last weekend with two
wins and one loss against unfa
miliar teams.
"We have more games under
our belt and more experience,"
Johnson said. "We do what we do
in order to win — practicing hard,
finishing on scoring opportunities
and playing solid defense.
"I think that our passing com
binations are working well lately.
We just need to score more off of
the many scoring opportunities
and we need to finish."
The Cardinal is not likely to
run out of steam because today's
contest does not affect its chances
of going to NCAAs. What will be
at stake is not post-conference
play, but consistency and pride.
