# Hall has been through it all
## 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Mike Hall is a man with perspec
tive.
The fifth-year senior has experi
enced the highs of back-to-back bowl
years in 1991 and 1992 and the lows
of losing seasons in the two most
recent years. He has played under
three different coaching staffs,
adapting to the defensive scheme of
each.
In 1995, his second season as a
starter and his last as a Cardinal, the
inside linebacker has truly come into
his own. Flourishing in defensive
coordinator Bill Harris's 4-3 set, Hall
has registered 80 tackles thus far,
the sixth highest total in the Pacific
10 Conference, and helped Stanford
to its 5-2-1 record.
Perhaps because of his unique
perspective, he is among the most
appreciative of the Cardinal's some
what surprising success.
"I'm ecstatic that I had the fifth
year," he said. "It's definitely a dif
ferent ball club from the previous
couple of years. If the season finishes
the way that it's been going so far, it
would be the perfect way to go out."
A freshman in 1991, Hall is one of
a handful players that can still
remember the hard-hitting defenses
of former head coach Denny Green,
who now calls the shots with the
Minnesota Vikings. Although Hall
redshirted after suffering through an
injury-plagued year that ended with
surgery to his knee, Green's defen
sive style appealed to the young man.

Linebacker Mike Hall has seen everything during
his time on the Farm.
Now that the reins of the Car
dinal have been passed on to one
of Green's assistants, Tyrone
Willingham, Hall feels that the
line of thought that first attract
ed him to the Farm has returned
after a noticeable absence the
past two seasons.
"This is the sort of philosophy
that I came in with," he said of
the defense's rejuvenated style of
play. "It's come around full circle
since I've been here. I'm glad
that it's gone that way."
During the Bill Walsh years,
commentators often noted Stan
ford's sieve-like defense. Stop
ping enemy drives was not the
Cardinal strong point.
"Last year, it seemed that we
were trying to piece together a
defensive scheme every game. It
was like 'What are we gointr to do

to stop these guys this week:
Hall said. "This year, it seems
that we have a much more solid
idea of what we're doing out
there. The basic scheme is
always the same. You always
have to make certain adjust
ments, but it's a solid scheme."
The new scheme includes a
switch in the alignment of Stan
ford's front seven. Instead of
using three defensive linemen
and four linebackers, this year's
Cardinal employs a fourth line
man and only three linebackers.
The switch in structure
means the nature of Hall's job
changes. But it is a change he
welcomes. Because more offen
sive linemen are engaged by the
additional defensive lineman,
Hall is able to see plays unfold
better and react to them more
quickly.
"I've been able to make a lot
more plays," he said. "The D-line
has done a great job on the line of
scrimmage. It means I can get to

the running back a lot quicker
without having to go through an
offensive lineman."
The scheme has also helped
Hall's partner in crime, Chris
Draft. The gifted sophomore has
amassed 81 tackles in his first
year at the inside linebacker
position. Draft's breakthrough
season has captured the atten
tion of the media, creating talk of
possible All-American seasons in
the future. The hoopla has some
what overshadowed Hall's own
performance, but the senior has
no wish to steal the spotlight
from his younger teammate.
"He's an incredible athlete,"
Hall said. "I'm just happy to
have him next to me out there,
and I'm looking forward to
watching him develop over the
next two years."
Hall's own development
included a move into the starting
lineup last year. He was one of
only a few veterans to start on a
Walsh defense filled with under

classmen. His 75 tackles ranked
third on the team and made him
the squad's top returning tackier
in 1995. In 1994's Big Game, he
led the team with nine tackles
and pulled down his first and
only career interception.
A player who stresses readi
ness, Hall does his homework on
opposing offenses. "The number
one thing is to be prepared," he
said. "It's nice to have confidence
when you walk out onto the field,
and if you have an idea of what
they're going to do, of what their
tendencies are, you can build up
a lot of confidence about what
you're doing. You can move
faster and be more aggressive."
Hall hopes that a newly
aggressive Cardinal defense can
push the team into a bowl game
and has no illusions about how
such a task will be accomplished.
"We'll just play as hard as we
can and see what happens," he
said. "It just comes down to mak
ing plays."

said. "It just comes down to mak
ing plays."
Mike Hall is a man with perspec
tive.
The fifth-year senior has experi
enced the highs of back-to-back bowl
years in 1991 and 1992 and the lows
of losing seasons in the two most
recent years. He has played under
three different coaching staffs,
adapting to the defensive scheme of
each.
In 1995, his second season as a
starter and his last as a Cardinal, the
inside linebacker has truly come into
his own. Flourishing in defensive
coordinator Bill Harris's 4-3 set, Hall
has registered 80 tackles thus far,
the sixth highest total in the Pacific
10 Conference, and helped Stanford
to its 5-2-1 record.
Perhaps because of his unique
perspective, he is among the most
appreciative of the Cardinal's some
what surprising success.
"I'm ecstatic that I had the fifth
year," he said. "It's definitely a dif
ferent ball club from the previous
couple of years. If the season finishes
the way that it's been going so far, it
would be the perfect way to go out."
A freshman in 1991, Hall is one of
a handful players that can still
remember the hard-hitting defenses
of former head coach Denny Green,
who now calls the shots with the
Minnesota Vikings. Although Hall
redshirted after suffering through an
injury-plagued year that ended with
surgery to his knee, Green's defen
sive style appealed to the young man.

Linebacker Mike Hall has seen everything during
his time on the Farm.
Now that the reins of the Car
dinal have been passed on to one
of Green's assistants, Tyrone
Willingham, Hall feels that the
line of thought that first attract
ed him to the Farm has returned
after a noticeable absence the
past two seasons.
"This is the sort of philosophy
that I came in with," he said of
the defense's rejuvenated style of
play. "It's come around full circle
since I've been here. I'm glad
that it's gone that way."
During the Bill Walsh years,
commentators often noted Stan
ford's sieve-like defense. Stop
ping enemy drives was not the
Cardinal strong point.
"Last year, it seemed that we
were trying to piece together a
defensive scheme every game. It
was like 'What are we gointr to do

to stop these guys this week:
Hall said. "This year, it seems
that we have a much more solid
idea of what we're doing out
there. The basic scheme is
always the same. You always
have to make certain adjust
ments, but it's a solid scheme."
The new scheme includes a
switch in the alignment of Stan
ford's front seven. Instead of
using three defensive linemen
and four linebackers, this year's
Cardinal employs a fourth line
man and only three linebackers.
The switch in structure
means the nature of Hall's job
changes. But it is a change he
welcomes. Because more offen
sive linemen are engaged by the
additional defensive lineman,
Hall is able to see plays unfold
better and react to them more
quickly.
"I've been able to make a lot
more plays," he said. "The D-line
has done a great job on the line of
scrimmage. It means I can get to

the running back a lot quicker
without having to go through an
offensive lineman."
The scheme has also helped
Hall's partner in crime, Chris
Draft. The gifted sophomore has
amassed 81 tackles in his first
year at the inside linebacker
position. Draft's breakthrough
season has captured the atten
tion of the media, creating talk of
possible All-American seasons in
the future. The hoopla has some
what overshadowed Hall's own
performance, but the senior has
no wish to steal the spotlight
from his younger teammate.
"He's an incredible athlete,"
Hall said. "I'm just happy to
have him next to me out there,
and I'm looking forward to
watching him develop over the
next two years."
Hall's own development
included a move into the starting
lineup last year. He was one of
only a few veterans to start on a
Walsh defense filled with under

classmen. His 75 tackles ranked
third on the team and made him
the squad's top returning tackier
in 1995. In 1994's Big Game, he
led the team with nine tackles
and pulled down his first and
only career interception.
A player who stresses readi
ness, Hall does his homework on
opposing offenses. "The number
one thing is to be prepared," he
said. "It's nice to have confidence
when you walk out onto the field,
and if you have an idea of what
they're going to do, of what their
tendencies are, you can build up
a lot of confidence about what
you're doing. You can move
faster and be more aggressive."
Hall hopes that a newly
aggressive Cardinal defense can
push the team into a bowl game
and has no illusions about how
such a task will be accomplished.
"We'll just play as hard as we
can and see what happens," he
said. "It just comes down to mak
ing plays."
