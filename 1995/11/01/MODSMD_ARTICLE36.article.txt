# Hall has been through it all
## 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Mike Hall is a man with perspec
tive.
The fifth-year senior has experi
enced the highs of back-to-back bowl
years in 1991 and 1992 and the lows
of losing seasons in the two most
recent years. He has played under
three different coaching staffs,
adapting to the defensive scheme of
each.
In 1995, his second season as a
starter and his last as a Cardinal, the
inside linebacker has truly come into
his own. Flourishing in defensive
coordinator Bill Harris's 4-3 set, Hall
has registered 80 tackles thus far,
the sixth highest total in the Pacific
10 Conference, and helped Stanford
to its 5-2-1 record.
Perhaps because of his unique
perspective, he is among the most
appreciative of the Cardinal's some
what surprising success.
"I'm ecstatic that I had the fifth
year," he said. "It's definitely a dif
ferent ball club from the previous
couple of years. If the season finishes
the way that it's been going so far, it
would be the perfect way to go out."
A freshman in 1991, Hall is one of
a handful players that can still
remember the hard-hitting defenses
of former head coach Denny Green,
who now calls the shots with the
Minnesota Vikings. Although Hall
redshirted after suffering through an
injury-plagued year that ended with
surgery to his knee, Green's defen
sive style appealed to the young man.
