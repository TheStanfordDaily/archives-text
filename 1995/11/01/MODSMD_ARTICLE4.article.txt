# Faculty debate role of teaching in evaluation
## Emphasis on research compromises improvement level 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
While a recent committee report before the Fac
ulty Senate called for a higher level of teaching, some
faculty members said they feel that the University's

strong emphasis on research puts a
burden on the level of possible
teaching improvement.
At the Faculty Senate's first
meeting of the year, the Subcommit
tee on the Evaluation and Improve
ment of Teaching, chaired by Educa
tion Prof. Lee Shulman, presented a
report recommending that more em
phasis be placed on teaching in the
University's hiring and promotion
practices and in its allocation of re
sources.

The problem, attested Spanish and Portuguese
Prof. Mary Pratt, is that "if research remains the
prime criteria in the reward system for tenure, pro
motions and raises . . . University attempts to im
prove teaching are an add-on."
Pratt, the recipient of a 19915 Bing Fellowship,
which recognizes excellence in undergraduate teach
ing, said the University needs to send a clear message
on incentives before professors can begin responding
to calls for increased attention to their teaching.
The teaching culture
While most agreed that promotion and hiring de
cisions are made largely on the basis of research,
there was dispute over whether this fact contributed
to a lower quality of teaching overall.
Ramon Saldi'var, vice provost for undergraduate

education and associate dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, said that in hiring and promoting, "for young
faculty, we're looking for potential ability in the field
of research. For older faculty, we're looking for
demonstrated ability."
"Obviously, we strive for equal excellence in both
[teaching and research]," said Saldivar. "That's the
ideal. You won't always be able to find that ideal, but
the goal is to strike a balance."
Besides being compromised bv research coming
first, teaching may suffer because "at a university,
nobody ever teaches you to teach," Pratt said.
The fact that professors never receive formal in
struction in "how to design a course, how to offer it in
class, how to assess how you're doing" is something
that should be considered "part of the equation"
when addressing quality of teaching, according to
Pratt.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy George Dekker
proposed his own explanation of why teaching might
suffer at a research university like Stanford.
"I think the drain is the time we spend on self-gov
ernance," he said, estimating that "committee ser
vice and doing the kind of work to keep the Universi
ty running" accounts for approximately one-third of
a professor's time.
Dekker pointed out that the professors he knows
normally do very little research except during the
summer or when on sabbatical and during "crunch
periods," for example, in the two years leading up to
a tenure or promotion evaluation.
"I haven't, however, in my 20-odd years here, seen
the teaching issue ignored," Dekker said. "Teaching
is always taken into account and can sometimes tip
