# Fee refund requests down this year
## ASSU fee refund results: Autumn 1995 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Though the special-fee system
has been the subject of much contro
versy in recent years, the amount of
money refunded this year has con
tinued its steady decline.
Overall, students this quarter
requested that 13.97 percent, or
$60,477.06, of ASSU funds given
to student groups be refunded
back to them.
The special fee is assessed to
each student as part of his or her
quarterly tuition bill. This pay
ment subsidizes certain student
groups on campus who are select
ed through a general election in
the spring. This quarter's special
fee was $32.96 per student.
Students can choose to refund
all or part of this payment, de
pending upon which groups they
object to funding.
This year's results represent a
decline in refund requests from
previous years. In the 1993-94

school year, about 36 percent of
students requested fee refunds.
During the 1994-95 year, 25 per
cent of students chose to refund
their fees. This quarter, only 16.3
percent of students chose to re

fund some or all of their fees.
This year the average refund
was $'26.67, compared with an av
erage refund of $25.27 last year.
"Refund rates are cyclical. They
fluctuate up and down," said

ASSU Financial Director John
Hall. "We're coming off a period of
high scrutiny of the program."
The hardest hit student groups

this year were MEChA, a Chicano
/ Latino student group; the Black
Student Union; and Stanford in
Government. More than 15.5 per
cent of these groups' fees were
refunded, forcing organizers to
scramble for extra funds.
MEChA leaders declined to
comment.
"I was surprised I by the refund
results] and disappointed that
more people do not see the bene
fits of SIG," said Ur Jaddou, chair
of Stanford in Government.
Jaddou said her group, like
many other campus groups, over
estimates their proposed budget

in order to compensate for funds
lost due to refunds.
"We will try and cut back on
extras, but the (lost funds] have to
take a toll on morale," she said.
This year, as in previous years,
the highest portion of refunds
came from graduate students,
who represented 80.3 percent of
those who refunded, up from 75.6
percent last year.
"Across the board, graduate
return rates have tended to be
four times that of undergradu
ates. This will create a very unsta
ble system for organizations fund
ed by graduate fees," said Hall.
Graduate student dissatisfac
tion has long plagued the ASSU's
funding of student groups. This
conflict came to a head in 1993,
when refunds reached a peak of

$165,000, mainly due to a group
of graduate students who bonded
together to refund 26.5 percent of
their special fees.
This group, the Graduate Stu
dent Tea Party, charged that the
funding program benefits student
groups whose main focus is
un de rgr a duates.
Unhappiness with the special
fee program led to the Common
Sense Fee Reform Amendment,
which is set to take effect next
spring. Under the new amend
ment, each organization will be
allowed to solicit fees from one of
three populations — undergradu
ates, graduates or the student
body as a whole.
Through this reform, only the
population from which the fee is
requested can vote on the group.
