# Fee refund requests down this year
## ASSU fee refund results: Autumn 1995 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Though the special-fee system
has been the subject of much contro
versy in recent years, the amount of
money refunded this year has con
tinued its steady decline.
Overall, students this quarter
requested that 13.97 percent, or
$60,477.06, of ASSU funds given
to student groups be refunded
back to them.
The special fee is assessed to
each student as part of his or her
quarterly tuition bill. This pay
ment subsidizes certain student
groups on campus who are select
ed through a general election in
the spring. This quarter's special
fee was $32.96 per student.
Students can choose to refund
all or part of this payment, de
pending upon which groups they
object to funding.
This year's results represent a
decline in refund requests from
previous years. In the 1993-94

school year, about 36 percent of
students requested fee refunds.
During the 1994-95 year, 25 per
cent of students chose to refund
their fees. This quarter, only 16.3
percent of students chose to re

fund some or all of their fees.
This year the average refund
was $'26.67, compared with an av
erage refund of $25.27 last year.
"Refund rates are cyclical. They
fluctuate up and down," said

ASSU Financial Director John
Hall. "We're coming off a period of
high scrutiny of the program."
