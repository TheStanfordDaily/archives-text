# No house in future for outdoors group
## Redwood theme house faces obstacles 
### James G. Wheaton Contributing writer 
Redwood Outdoor Club, a stu

an outdoors focus house.
In a meeting Monday between

framework stressing academics,"
said Fleming. "It's hard to accept
a proposal about backpacking
when you're in a framework like

programming.
"Basically, they want us to do
an Outward Bound-type program.
That takes a tremendous amount
of effort, and we're not sure we
want to do that," said Fleming.
According to Fleming, the
group might be able to get a house
if it is willing to change their pro

Res ideas. Some members of
