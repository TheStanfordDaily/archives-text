# No house in future for outdoors group
## Redwood theme house faces obstacles 
### James G. Wheaton Contributing writer 
Redwood Outdoor Club, a stu
dent group focusing on the out
doors and "experiential educa
tion," recently suffered a signifi
cant setback in its quest to create
an outdoors focus house.
In a meeting Monday between
Residential Education Director
Jane Camarillo and Redwood
members Lee Fleming, Ken Yang
and Vandy Johnson, the club
came to the realization that the
process of creating a focus house is
a difficult one.
"We were confused. We
thought a focus house didn't need
to be academic, and doesn't need
an RF (resident fellow). We were
wrong," said Fleming.
In their proposal, the Redwood
club stated "an outdoor focus
house would provide institutional
support for promoting experien
tial education at Stanford."
Redwood proposed the house
because "it would be nice to have a
centralized community for out
doors folks and experiential edu

cation," according to Johnson.
"That and we need a place for our
gear and for meetings. Some of
our things are rotting in the kayak
shed."
Res Ed was not overenthusias
tic about the proposal, however.
"Camarillo is working within a
framework stressing academics,"
said Fleming. "It's hard to accept
a proposal about backpacking
when you're in a framework like
that."
While Res Ed is more interest
ed in academic enrichment, ac
cording to Fleming, they are also
interested in the idea of working
with Redwood for various sorts of
programming.
"Basically, they want us to do
an Outward Bound-type program.
That takes a tremendous amount
of effort, and we're not sure we
want to do that," said Fleming.
According to Fleming, the
group might be able to get a house
if it is willing to change their pro
posal to more closely align with
Res ideas. Some members of
the club are leery of that proposal.
"We have an informal structure,
and we're not sure we want to be
co-opted by Res Ed," said Fleming.
Should the club decide to go for
ward with the plan, the road would
be arduous. According to Fleming,
the club must drum up faculty sup
{>ort and make extensive program
proposals to get a house.
"If a faculty member steppixi
forward and wanted to be the RF,

that would be very helpful," said
Flaming.
Three years ago, a group with
the name REDWOOD was founded
with support from the ASSU's
Council of Presidents, who gave
the organization both financial
support and office space. In three
years, however, REDWOOD was
unable have its special fee approved
and, contingent to its original deal
with the COP, lost both its office
space and its funding. The organi
zation now bears name Redwood
Outdoors Club and has no hudget
or office space.
Redwood's main goals are to

expand Stanford students' opportu
nities for "experiential education"
as well as to give more access to the
outdoors to Stanford students. It
also sponsors trips for first year stu
dents early in the academic year.
"It's disappointing for kids who
come to Stanford to not have
resources like those at Princeton to
Dartmouth or Williams," said
Johnson, an undergraduate mem
ber of the club.
"Everyone goes to Half Moon
Bay or Lake Tahoe for skiing but
we have Big Sur, Yosemite, even
Joshua Tree so close by," she
added.
