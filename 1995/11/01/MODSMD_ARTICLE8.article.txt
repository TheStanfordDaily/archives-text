Bhangra brouhaha
Another Sanskriti Bhangra party was the
scene of a crime this year when unknown sus
pects overturned a 1990 black-and-red Mazda
Miata parked in Lane L behind and
Governor's Corner.
Stanford Police said the vandalism occurred
last Saturday between 12:15 and 1 a.m. The
convertible was turned on its top, damaging
the car to such a great extent that the owner
could not drive it from the scene. Police said
the estimated damage was greater than $5,000.
The Bhangra party attracts people from
throughout the Bay Area. It was the scene of a
gang-like brawl last year when several men
began punching and beating another man at
the door of the party.
Report filed on missing bikes
The bikes lost in Stern storage over the
summer have now officially been reported
stolen.
Fourteen bicycles were reported missing
from a storage room under Twain East in
Stern Hall at the beginning of fall quarter.
Because of confusion surrounding the massive

renovation of Stern this summer, storage offi
cials believed the bikes were only temporarily
lost. They gave up the search for the bikes on
Oct. 16, however, and filed a report with
police.
Stanford Police said the thefts occurred
between June 17 and Sept. 24. They have no
suspects and no clues indicating how the sus
pects entered the storage room.
Golf cart bandits strike
A golf cart bandit has been wreaking havoc
around campus in recent weeks. Two carts
have been hit — one parked outside the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house and one outside Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest.
The first vandalism occurred on Oct. 15
between 12:45 and 2 a.m. A golf cart originally
locked outside of SAE was later discovered
with its steering wheel and steering column
torn out, according to Stanford Police. The seat
frame was bent backwards and the seats were
torn.
The second vandalism occurred on Oct. 17
between 12:50 and 1:15 a.m., to a golf cart orig
inally chained to a water pipe outside of EBF. A
witness heard a loud noise and saw water com

ing out of a broken water pipe near the cart,
Stanford Police said. The cart had been moved
a few yards, breaking the water pipe.
Stanford Police Sgt. John McMullen said
the unknown suspects either yanked the cart
chain to break the pipe or tried to drive the
chained golf cart away.
Stanford Police have no suspects in either
case.
Telephone trespasser
Two residents living in Mirrielees awoke at
4: 15 a. m. on Oct. 20 to find a stranger trying to
use the telephone in their apartment.
An unidentified male entered the ground
floor apartment through an unlocked sliding
glass dfx>r to use the phone, Stanford Police
said. The residents awoke, saw the man and
asked what he was doing. He replied that he
had to use the phone, and before the residents
could do anything, had completed his phone
call and left.
Residents said the white, 6-foot-tall male
was"the upperclassman type" in his early 20s
with dark short hair. He smelled strongly of
alcohol and was unsteady on his feet.
