# Canadians comment on Quebec 'No' vote
## 
### David Stein 
Although Quebeckers voted
against secession from Canada
Monday, many at Stanford said
they believe that the issue of Cana
dian national unity is far from
being resolved.
Federalists — those in favor of
maintaining a united Canada —
narrowly beat out the separatists
by a mere 50,000 votes out of 4.65
million. Members of the Stanford
community believe this lack of
mandate does not provide any
definitive vision of the French
speaking province's future rela
tionship with Canada.
"The ramifications of this deci
sion are indecisive like the vote
itself," said Economics Prof.
Ronald McKinnon. "However, the
separatists will no doubt try
again."
McKinnon added that he was a
little surprised at the close margin
of the vote, noting that the "edgy"
relationship between the federal
government and Quebec will not
soon go away.
A similar attempt at secession
was made in 1980, yet was sound
ly defeated by a substantial 60-40
margin. Since then, the Quebec-
Canada ties have become even
looser, with Quebec still refusing
to ratify the Canadian Constitu
tion.
Without a definitive majority,
the vote offers little chance for
talks on Quebec's political autono
my, said Dahlia Lithwick, a third
year law student and member of
the Stanford Canadian Club.
"With a clear mandate, we
could have sat down and" had a
conversation about Quebec's inde

pendence. You can hardly have a
conversation with 49.5 percent
voting for secessionsaid Lith
wick.
Nevertheless, there are those
who feel that the vote sent a
strong message to all Canadians.
"Serious negotiating should
come out of this," said Political
Science Prof. Philippe Schmitter.
"If this were a rational problem,
Canadians would start making
concessions to Quebec."
Along with 30 or so other mem
bers of the Canadian Club, Lith
wi< ;inxiously watched the voting
results from a satellite feed of
Canadiiin television at the Bechtel
International Center. Although
the crowd was quiet throughout,
champagne and cheers greeted the
decision for Canada to stay togeth
er.
Some observers, like fifth-year
graduate student in electrical engi
neering Michael Goldbach, were
not entirely content with the
results.
"I was pleased at our country's
not breaking apart, but it will be
disappointing if nothing happened
to recognize this distinct French
society," said Goldbach.
While there was some violence
in Canada after the results were
reported, the process, for the most
part, was peaceful. Lithwick com
mented that "it speaks well for
Canada that there was no rioting"
and that the people could sit down
and vote, rather than fight over
the outcome.
Goldbach said he was also
proud that 94 percent of eligible
voters contributed to the demo
cratic process of peacefully deter
mining the country's status.
