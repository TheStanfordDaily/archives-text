From a distance, the crowd

people in a circle chanting to a
rhythmic beat, encouraging
the performer in the middle.
As you inch closer, you see
somethingdifTerent. You see a
roda — the crowd — prodding
on the players who are per
forming capoeira, a Brazilian
martial art form which com
bines elements of dance,
music and a sense of commu
nity among the players.
The Stanford Capoeiristas,
a new campus group, are try
ing to introduce this engaging
art form to the Stanford com
munity.
The goal of the Stanford
Capoeiristas is "to get (experi
enced Capoeiristas I playing
constantly and then start
opening up to everybody," said
junior Andrew Kringstein, the
founder of the group.
The objective of the group
is to gather other capoeiristas
and train together. Currently,
there are five to six diehard
capoeiristas. Although formal
lessons won't be offered by
the group, there is a mestre —
capoeira teacher — in Palo
Alto who offers inexpensive

lessons.
Unfortunately, Kringstein
said, "You don't get together with
other schools and compete. There
are no competitions for capoeira."
To help introduce all Stanford
students to capoeira, Senior
Kaira Lingo will hold a capoeira
event at Roble Gym on November
17. The events include introduc
tory capoeira classes by Master
Cobra Mansa, viewing of the
movie "Quilombo" and a panel
discussion on the significance of
Nov. 20, which commemorates
300 years since the death of
Zumbi, leader of Palmarus, the
biggest and most successful slave
community in Brazil.
The origins of capoeira are
shrouded in mystery. Some myths
say that capoeira was a fight dis
guised as a dance so that African
slaves could practice it unknown

to their white masters. But that is
contrary to the truth, according
to Kringstein.
Capoeira was derived from an
African martial art called N'Golo,
and then it took on its own form
in Brazil. The Europeans said
they were going to suppress
capoeira because it gave the
Africans a sense of nationality,
developed self-confidence among
the slaves, and of course, created
skilled and dangerous fighters.
Eventually, capoeira hit Euro
pean centers and became popular
in the modern world.
There are two discrete forms of
capoeira. Angola — the more tra
ditional form — is a slower form
of martial art, one which is played
lower to the ground. The other
form — regional — is played erect
and faster. This form seems vio
lent sometimes and similar to the
Asian martial arts, even though
Capoeira is played, not fought.
Capoeira is focused around the
roda, or the circle where capoeira
is played. Instruments such as

the berimbau, a one-stringed,
bow-shaped instrument and pan
deiro, a tambourine, lead the pace
of the game. Different rhythms
give different ways to play the
games.
The martial art utilizes antici
pation and foresight rather than
brute strength. It is all about
swinging your body and deceiving
the other player — not attacks or
defense. During the game, a skilled
capoeirista exposes the limitations
of opponents through the use of
playful attacks and counterattacks.
There is no script to capoeira; peo
ple simply play off of each other.
Most of the time, it looks like a
well-choreographed dance.
In all, capoeira is an exciting
martial art form which fuses the
rhythms of music, the elegance
and beauty of dance, the decep
tion and speed of martial arts and
the feelings of camaraderie. The
capoeira experience cannot be
described by words alone; you
must see it in action, and become
part of the roda.
