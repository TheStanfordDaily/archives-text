Reform in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) — Vot
ers reshaped South Africa yesterday, putting
blacks in charge of cities and towns that had once
been white preserves.
It was the first time South Africa has had local
elections with all the country's races taking part
and only the second time blacks have been allowed
to vote.
The first, in April 1994, brought President Nel
son Mandela to power and ended white minority
rule at the national level. But at the local level
there were still no black elected officials although
some black mayors had been appointed as transi
tional leaders.
"This is the completion of the democratic pro
cess that we began" last year, Mandela said on a
visit to a polling station in the Atteridgeville black
township outside Pretoria.

Taxi discrimination
SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) - A few blocks from
the tomb of the Great Emancipator, a notice post
ed at Lincoln Yellow Cab Co.'s headquarters made
it clear that even gett ing a taxi can be a question
of race.
"Effective immediately Do not pick up any
black males unless you feel it is safe," the note
read. "If you do not feel safe with the way they
look Do not pick them up! There has been too
many robberies lately, and they have all been by
BLACK MALES."
The sign, posted on a bulletin board visible to
customers, came down yesterday shortly after an
Associated Press reporter asked about it.
Company manager Earl Reno said his lawyer
advised him to take the sign down and "put up a
sign that says do not pick up any suspicious-look
ing persons."
