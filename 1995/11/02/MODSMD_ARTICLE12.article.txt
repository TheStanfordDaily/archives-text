# Balkan leaders meet for peace
## 
### 
DAYTON, Ohio (AD -
Opening peace talks with stiff
handshakes, three Balkan presi
dents set out yesterday on a
"long journey" in pursuit of
peace in Bosnia. If they fail, Sec
retary of State Warren Christo
pher said, Europe could be
plunged into a wider war requir
ing American military interven
tion.
Sitting across a conference
table from the leaders of Serbia,
Croatia and Bosnia, Christopher
said "future generations would
surely hold us accountable for the
consequences."
The aim is a settlement to end
a 42-month war that has left tens
of thousands of people homeless
and sparked atrocities unmatched
in Europe since Nazi Germany

killed 6 million Jews in World
War II
Results emerged quickly.
At Christopher's urging, Ser
bia and Croatia promised to work
on normalizing relations by
respecting human rights and giv
ing refugees the option of com
pensation or returning to their
homeland. They also promised to
work on a peaceful settlement to
their dispute over a hotly contest
ed sliver of Croatian territory
occupied by Serb rebels since
1991.
The United States, meanwhile,
began parceling out portions of a
proposed draft treaty. A second
session ended with handshakes
and what U.S. spokesman
Nicholas Burns described as "a
good mixing of delegations."

In a somber speech, echoed by
European mediator Carl Bildt
and Russian Deputy Foreign Min
ister Igor Ivanov, Christopher
said Bosnia-Herzegovina was
entitled to be "a country at peace
and not a killing field."
"This will be a long journey,"
he said, "but it all starts her.e..
Let's all get down to work."
The three Balkan presidents,
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia,
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and
Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, made
no opening statements. They
shook hands at Christopher's urg
ing, but did not smile at each other.
"The world can and will help
you make peace," Christopher
told them. "But only you can
ensure that this process will suc
ceed."
