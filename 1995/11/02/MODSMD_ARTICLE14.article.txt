## Disorderly conduct 
### 
Last Tuesday evening, the
ASSU Speakers Bureau
launched its Speakers
Series with filmmaker Oliver
Stone. While Stone is by no
means an uncontroversial speak
er or filmmaker, the treatment he
received during his appearance
was rude and unacceptable.
When students invite an orator
to campus, there should be a level
of decorum maintained â€” pri
marily, the obligation to behave.
While the right to express per
sonal opinions and ask pointed
uuestions should not be hindered,
Q&iA is not a time for speech
making, name calling or extended
battles of wills and intellects.
Unfortunately, name calling and
speech making is what happened
that night.
In principal, even if students
disagree with the view of speak

ers, they should not patronize or
attempt to humiliate them in
public. They are guests of the
University, and how we treat
them is a reflection of our man
ners and reputation in the world
outside the confines of Stanford.
Judging by its historically low
refund rate and its high percent
age of special-fee election approval,
one can conclude that the Speak
ers Bureau is one of the most pop
ular student-run groups on cam
pus. Simply stated, Stanford stu
dents like the Speakers Bureau,
but they have an unusual way of
expressing their appreciation.
These events are meant to be
enjoyed by all, including those
who are invited to speak. In the
coming months, when others
come to speak, let the Stanford
community show that it is capable
of intelligent, respectful dissent.
