# A 						pathetic Review

THE STANFORD REVIEW is
back in familiar territory,
proving itself once again to be
the dregs of journalistic integrity
Recently, it resurrected the
w Chief" logo for use with the
"Smoke Signals" column. The logo
ks a rather bulky caricature of a man
(supposed to represent a Native
American tribal chief) with an ax
and feathered headband.
The drawing was at the center of
controversy last year when a group
6f Native American students,
Qffended by the icon's racist over
tones, protested the publication. It
was temporarily replaced by a photo
graph of a silhouetted figure with a
feathered headband.
Now "The Chief" is back. The
move follows that "news"paper's
typical pattern of being crass only to
foment controversy When confront
ed with their indelicacy, the editors
have, as usual, tried unconvincingly
to play the innocent, misunderstood
victim.
It seems that many Review edi
tors think the onlv wav thev can

attract attention is through contro
versy. From trumped-up controver
sies about bathroom sex to
harangues about the political prefer
ences of professors, The Stanford
Review has for years lived by the
maxim that all publicity is good pub
licity.
"The Chief" is just the latest
debacle. The editors claim the icon
is needed for aesthetic reasons.
Aside from the fact that it is ugly,
Review editors could think of more
graphics than just the childish
chieftain.
Indeed, there is no need to include
any graphic of a Native American in
any form with a column called
"Smoke Signals" â€” the most recent
issue's front cover featured a draw
ing of a match in the teaser of the
column.
Once again The Review's reason
ing is shown to be flawed and the
paper's desire to ofTend transparent.
It is time for The Review to show
some integrity To be a provocative
publication is fine, but provocation
not tempered with reason is vice.
