## Turn off the boob tube 
### 
This week sucked. Post-
Midterm Festivities were just
beginning when all of a sudden that
once-distant 20-page paper discussing at
great length the history of Jehovah's Wit
ness literature and its impact on the Chi
nese socioeconomic revolution slammed
up like a swift kick to the nether regions.
Yes, indeed, this is the time in the quarter
when romantic words such as Great
Learning, Knowledge and Intellectual Dis
course give way to other naughtier words
the Yossarian-inspired Daily editors would
black out anyway.
Unfortunately, in times like these, we
often lose sight of the Big Picture; we no
longer get to feast on the Tube. But now is
not the time to shun our television her
itage, not when we've just received word
from our spies in the networks. It seems
that the networks are about to jump off
the cutt ing edge of TV and bring us places
we've never really wanted to go. So trash
your calculator and burn your books,
because here's what's in store for us. . . .
Melrose Place: Let's get started with
that little tart Brooke who tricked Billy
into marriage. Anyway, this dirty little
hooker has simply been up to no good late
ly. Discovering that Amanda has only
faked her death, she calls up an old flame,
a wife-beating psycho from "Miami Vice,"
and asks him for a little favor.. ..
On top of that, we experience weird

Freudian overtones when Jake's sugar
daddy dumps him for a nine-year-old Thai
boy. Jake and his moody photographer
"friend" then hit the road on his "Chop
per" (baby) to avenge his brother's death.
Matt, the token gay social worker, has
been rethinking medical school. Presum
ably, he saw what the medical profession
had to offer in the likes of Michael and
Kimberly. But, let us not forget that the
gay man remains the only character with
out his own serious plot line. And hey,
where are the actors of color? Too smart to
be on this show.
Beverly Hills 90210: Continuing on
Freudian Oedipal themes, be sure to check
out Dylan McCay in his first controversial
role. With sex, boyish good looks and a
powder blue tutu as his only weapons, he
slowly infiltrates the mob to find out who
killed his daddy.
And speaking of sex, we welcome our
favorite Monday columnist to the show. In
his hit debut, Brendan sure hits it off with
Brandon and in a bold move, greets us in a
leather body suit. However, our man Bren
loses hand (or shall we say "gains a fist")
in the relationship when he submits to
Brandon's sordid sadistic pleasures.
Valerie continues to display her situa
tion ethics as an enigmatic heroine / anti
heroine. On the one hand, we see her get
kicked in the teeth, emotionally and
rather physically, by Donna (the blue

meany). Yet, on the other hand, a mere
few scenes later, she offers Donna some
timely advice on Ray (whom Donna has
dumped because he's so moody and
oppressive; but, shucks, he sure can play
that guitar). As if that weren't enough,
Valerie and David score some crank and
then spend an evening watching the
"Mowing Man" screen saver. So deep, yet,
so confusing.
Also, Shannon Doherty has been
rumored to be hanging with the recently
released Kimberly "DifPrent Strokes"
Drummond. Glory days.
Friends: Indeed, these are the days of
Girl Power. Phoebe, Monica and Rachel
continue to overthrow all sorts of domi
nant social feminine paradigms. Bully for
them!
Joey's been kinda dumb lately. But
don't worry, Ross and Chandler have been
teaming up to make Joey look more clever.
This is especially timely as Paul, a new
Friend, enters the show as the grown-up
feral kid from "Road Warrior," who by
now has increased his vocabulary to
include the words "pancake" and "Alanis"
and "Morissette". Go figure.

Confidential to Mr. Monday McCullough:
Yeah, we 11... so'syour morn.
