The Daily's grape vote editorial was misguided

lAM DISAPPOINTED and alarmed
to read the rhetoric surrounding a
rejection of the grape boycott, both
in The Daily's Oct. 31 editorial and in
yesterday's letter from freshman Brent
Greenfield.
I perceive that most students would
prefer not to be bothered by the ques
tion of injustice against farm workers
and feel that any "statement" made by
the residence would be, practically
.speaking, irrelevant. Fine.
But, irrespective of the merits of the
debate, I view The Daily's editorial as a
facile dismissal of the democratic process
and Greenfield's response to it sadly rep
resentative of widely-held attitudes
toward political participation and politi
cal Objectives.
The advocates of the grape boycott
considered this issue important enough
to bring before their community (The

University, I am sure, would have been
content simply to let the matter drop).
Recall that the vote was relatively close
— eight students made the difference.
Those who failed to participate may have
been disaffected with the agenda, or real
ly not cared whether they would be per
mitted the opportunity to eat grapes. In
any case, they allowed others to make
that decision for them. It may be a minor
issue, but it is a community issue.
Nearly a quarter of the residents in
Manzanita were concerned enough about
the problem to suggest a positive, if sym
bolic, change. They constitute a substan
tial proport ion of the electorate and do
not deserve the pejorative "special-inter
est" label which The Daily tars.
The Daily describes the grape vote as
being an unfair attempt by one group to
dictate the behavior and principles of an
entire community. The Daily character

izes the vote as a trivial pursuit which
the student body is "sick and tired" of
hearing about and claims that students
were "forced to vote." When did democ
racy become a system which aims to
allow each individual to go his own way
with a minimum of interference to ensure
everyone the right of comfortable apa
thy? Perhaps I was absent from class
that day. The democracy I learned about
was a community enterprise, not an
individual one. Its purpose was to endow
a community with the ability to make
collectively its own decisions about
behavior and principles, rather than
leaving those prerogatives to autocrats
and elites. Now that apathy is endemic,
those who still take this process serious
ly are deemed crackpots. It's a sorry
state of affairs.
The juxtaposition of The Daily's edi
torial with a story about the indepen-

dence vote in Quebec was a poignant
coincidence. There, 92 percent of the
electorate turned out to decide their col
lective identity in a democratic referen
dum. Almost exactly half of them were
disappointed, many grievously so. But it
was an honest effort, and an honest pro
cess; they knew that democracy doesn't
always produce the result one wants.
Now, both the pros and the cons must
manage to live together civilly, with
compromise and better mutual under
standing. Any 18-year-old can cast a
vote, but it takes adult self-discipline to
deal constructively with the outcome.
Since when did voting become an
onus in The Daily's eyes? The "powers
that be" might not give a second chance
Not caring is no excuse. Respect the pro
cess.
