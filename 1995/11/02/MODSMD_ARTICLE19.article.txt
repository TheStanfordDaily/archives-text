# Student's apathy on the grape vote stems from ignorance and na√Øvete
## 
### 
A letter printed in The Daily yester
day suggested that only "the administra
tion and the faculty" care about whether
grapes are boycotted. I would suggest
that the writer should have written that
only "the grown-ups" care.

I teach English to farm workers, most
of them in the same age group as Stan
lord students. They are grown-ups
whether they prefer it or not. Many have
heavy responsibilities for feeding rela
tives in Mexico, and they put up with
dangers and stresses that most of us
wouldn't tolerate for one day.
On top of that, last week, there were
immigration raids on the coast, and
Pescadero is buzzing with stories of
many workers with perfectly good
papers who were terrified and worried

sick by the time they were allowed to get
their documents from the car or the
locker. At the moment, some bosses are
requiring everyone to work 10 hours a
day to make up for the undocumented
workers that were taken away. The
worker I talked to is non-unionized and
is getting less than $5 an hour, including
overtime hours. This is only one of the
reasons we should boycott grapes or
anything else that will help the union.
I am sympathetic to those who are
too overwhelmed by other issues to

focus on the workers who form the base
on which our economic pyramid rests.
And I also have compassion for those
who are young and ignorant, and per
haps overindulged. Hut it is quite anoth
er thing to suggest self-righteously that
the community should ignore a great
social injustice that is right in our face
because "we have it made" and we don't
choose to lift a hand.
