# Students ponder affirmative action
## Discussion is freewheeling, relaxed at Cubberley forum 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
A diverse gathering of approximately 75
people participated in a lively open forum
at Cubberley Auditorium last night that
addressed a range of issues relating to af
firmative action.
Sally Dickson, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development, opened the
discussion with a short history and
overview of affirmative action.
"We are each on our own sides on this
issue, but all of our daily lives are affected
by it," she said. "Affirmative action doesn't
just affect women and people of color. It af
fects us all."
Dickson said affirmative action was first

established in the 19605, when 'President
Johnson, along with wise counsel, realized
that without a mechanism to ensure equal
opportunity to all individuals, business as
usual would go on."
In defending affirmative action, Dick
son contrasted the policy with racial quo
tas. "Affirmative action is about setting
goals and objectives," she said. "Affirma
tive action is not about giving someone a
joh as an engineer who doesn't have a col
lege degree. It is about recruiting in a way
so that individuals who in the past didn't
have opportunities now have them.
"We have to ask ourselves what the cost
to society would he if we didn't have these
policies that provided equal opportunity
for all individuals," said Dickson. She

added that "people of color and women
aren't going to go away."
Organizers of the del>ate emphasized an
open and relaxed format, where the stu
dents felt free to stand up and t;ilk to their
peers. Multicultural Educator Tommy
VVoon, who facilitated the discussion, com
mented that one reason for holding the
forum was the shortage of constructive dis
cussion among students about affirmative
action.
Senior Jeff Giesea stirred the discussion
as the only participant to (Irmly state his
opposition to affirmative action. Giesea felt
that if affirmative action is going to he dis
