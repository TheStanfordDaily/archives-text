# Students ponder affirmative action
## Discussion is freewheeling, relaxed at Cubberley forum 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes Contributing writer 
A diverse gathering of approximately 75
people participated in a lively open forum
at Cubberley Auditorium last night that
addressed a range of issues relating to af
firmative action.
Sally Dickson, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development, opened the
discussion with a short history and
overview of affirmative action.
"We are each on our own sides on this
issue, but all of our daily lives are affected
by it," she said. "Affirmative action doesn't
just affect women and people of color. It af
fects us all."
Dickson said affirmative action was first

established in the 19605, when 'President
Johnson, along with wise counsel, realized
that without a mechanism to ensure equal
opportunity to all individuals, business as
usual would go on."
In defending affirmative action, Dick
son contrasted the policy with racial quo
tas. "Affirmative action is about setting
goals and objectives," she said. "Affirma
tive action is not about giving someone a
joh as an engineer who doesn't have a col
lege degree. It is about recruiting in a way
so that individuals who in the past didn't
have opportunities now have them.
"We have to ask ourselves what the cost
to society would he if we didn't have these
policies that provided equal opportunity
for all individuals," said Dickson. She

added that "people of color and women
aren't going to go away."
Organizers of the del>ate emphasized an
open and relaxed format, where the stu
dents felt free to stand up and t;ilk to their
peers. Multicultural Educator Tommy
VVoon, who facilitated the discussion, com
mented that one reason for holding the
forum was the shortage of constructive dis
cussion among students about affirmative
action.
Senior Jeff Giesea stirred the discussion
as the only participant to (Irmly state his
opposition to affirmative action. Giesea felt
that if affirmative action is going to he dis
cussed, more information needs to be out
on the table, pointing to Stanford's
affirmative action policies and the
Admissions Office's refusal to
release a detailed breakdown of
statistics on the SAT scores and
grade point averages of students of
all races admitted to Stanford.
"The statistics (if released!
would show how extreme affirma
tive action is here and how it man
ifests in the performance of. .. the
people who have admitted by
affirmative action," said Giesea.
"There are a lot of things that
aren't fair in this country, but I
don't know if affirmative action is
the way to solve the problem. It
hurts people on both sides of the
issue — those who benefit from it
and those who don't."
In response to Giesea, senior
Seraphina Uludong said that
"finding out what kind of affirma
tive act,ion a school uses is differ
ent than finding out the [statistics]
of the students admitted by it.
There is nothing that you can do
that will stop people from ques
tioning why I am here."
She cautioned Giesea not to
"diagnose my problems and pro
vide solutions to them when you
don't know anything about my sit
uation."

Sophomore Misha Olivas said
affirmative action works as an
incentive. "Affirmative action lets
people know that they can get into
college and that they have the
opportunity," she said. "It's say
ing, apply, you have just as much
right as anyone else."
Senior Eric Ixigan, co-president
of the Black Student Union, relat
ed a personal anecdote to illustrate
why he supports afTirmative action
programs. "Recently I was at an
event and for the first time I heard
someone get up and say, 'I am an
affirmative action admittee to
Berkeley School,' and so the
next time someone asked me I said
the same thing — 'I am an affir
mative action admittee to Stan
ford,'" he said.
"People might say, 'No you're
not. You went to Phillips Exeter
Academy and got over 1400 on your
SATs.' But it's true. I am an afTir
mative action admittee.... Affir
mative action is trying to make this
country a true land of opportunity.
It's attempting to give us a chance
that this country has systematically
denied us in the past."
Even with affirmative action,
race alone does not ensure admis
sion to a university like Stanford,
said junior Pam Edwards. "Let a
ghetto black with a 1.7 GPA and a
700 SAT score apply to Stanford
and he can mark black all he
wants, it won't get him in."
