Tunes vex student
Stanford student Carlos Moreno, 22, must not
have liked the music playing at the Theta Xi party
Oct. 28. He was caught allegedly stealing CDs from
an unlocked car parked across the street.
Stanford Police said a witness discovered
Moreno holding CDs inside a 1992 Jeep Wrangler
Convertible.
The witness asked Moreno to get out of the jeep,
and Moreno refused. The witness realized Moreno
was stealing CDs, and a heated exchange ensued
wherein Moreno allegedly threatened the witness
with a metal security instrument from his own car
just yards away, police said.
Two security guards from the party approached

the two and grabbed Moreno from behind. After
determining that he would not leave the scene, the
guards let Moreno back into the party until Stan

Moreno was booked for burglary and has been
released from custody. He is awaiting arraign
