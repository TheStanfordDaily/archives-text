Unable to keep up with the
stress of midterms and the
strains of a weekend road trip, the
Stanford field hockey team (8-6
overall, 5-1 Northern Pacific Con
ference) ran out of gas yesterday

in the NorPac championship
game, losing 4-0 to California (5-
8, 4-2). The Bears have now cap
tured the NorPac title for the
fourth year in a row and cling to
hopes of a NCAA playoff berth.
NorPac league agreements
place an emphasis on conference
records in determining which
team will advance. Unfortunately
for Cal, the championship con

frontation will not count towards
league records.
Nonetheless, Cal head coach
Shelly Onstead does not think
that the Cardinal should advance
despite its superior league mark,
insisting instead that the Bears
still have a legitimate claim.
Denying that conference stand
ings take precedence over the
championship match, Onstead
argued that the long-standing
agreement of the conference only
made sure that the championship
game wasn't the sole factor in
deciding who will compete at
NCAAs.
"[Yesterday's title] makes it
four in a row, and my under
standing is that it does have a
bearing on NCAAs," Onstead
said. "Who goes is based on NCAA
criteria, like strength of schedule
and who is the strongest team."
Onstead mentioned the senti
mental value of the NorPac title
game to seniors as a motivating
factor. In addition, Onstead took
advantage of the vagueness of
NCAA standards to motivate her
team, reminding the Bears that
they were not out of it and that
they had to show the NCAA what
they've got.
Stanford head coach Sheryl
Johnson refused to comment on
the situation, saying only that the
advancing team will be decided
upon by a conference call this
week. Johnson, obviously dis
pleased at the recent turn of

events, previously had believed
that last Tuesday's 1-0 Cardinal
triumph over Cal meant that
Stanford would go on to the post
season.
The final decision will rest on
the vote of Pacific, the third uni
versity in the NorPac conference.
In any event, according to the
Cardinal, yesterday's game was
not indicative of its strength. Stan
ford lacked energy and motivation
due in part to the players' busy
academic and athletic schedules.
"All around, it almost looked
like we weren't ready to play,"
said junior right back Amy Marfil.
"We are definitely a lot better
than we played [yesterday.]"
Although the Cardinal posted
more shot attempts than the
Bears — 29 to Cal's 12 — close
shots don't win games. Cal break
aways oftentimes led to scores
through the weak Stanford
defense.

Senior Elise Morgan pushes the ball past a defender in a victory over NorPac conference rival Pacifc
earlier this season.
"We weren't finishing on our
scoring, and our defense was
really having trouble marking,"
said assistant coach Tina Syer.
Syer attributed the loss in
part to psychological and physi
cal factors. "I think that it was
motivation and academic pres
sure," she said. "It was hard to
focus on practice and (yester
day's contest). We have to learn
to play through that."
Stanford also dominated in
short-corner penalties, receiv
ing 14 attempts to Cat's two.
Two such plays even beat the
Bear goalie but were saved by
post defenders inside the goal.
The loss serves to motivate
the Cardinal for this weekend's
Western Collegiate Champi
onships. Stanford and Cal both
will receive a first-round bye for
the event while Pacific, UC-
Davis, Santa Clara and Santa
Barbara first play on Friday.
Pacific has yet to beat the Cardi
nal or the Bears this year, and
the Aggies and Broncos are both
club teams, so Stanford will in
all likelihood face Cal once again
However, the real face-off
will come this week as the
coaches from Stanford, Cal and
Pacific decide which team, the
Cardinal or the Bears, will gar
ner the coveted NCAA playoff
berth.

Cardinal field hockey has defeated Cal twice this year, but a 4-0 loss to the Bears in the NorPac cham

Stanford also dominated in
short-corner penalties, receiv
ing 14 attempts to Cat's two.
Two such plays even beat the
Bear goalie but were saved by
post defenders inside the goal.
The loss serves to motivate
the Cardinal for this weekend's
Western Collegiate Champi
onships. Stanford and Cal both
will receive a first-round bye for
the event while Pacific, UC-
Davis, Santa Clara and Santa
Barbara first play on Friday.
Pacific has yet to beat the Cardi
nal or the Bears this year, and
the Aggies and Broncos are both
club teams, so Stanford will in
all likelihood face Cal once again
However, the real face-off
will come this week as the
coaches from Stanford, Cal and
Pacific decide which team, the
Cardinal or the Bears, will gar
ner the coveted NCAA playoff
berth.

Cardinal field hockey has defeated Cal twice this year, but a 4-0 loss to the Bears in the NorPac cham
pionship yesterday has raised questions over who should go to the NCAA Tournament.
