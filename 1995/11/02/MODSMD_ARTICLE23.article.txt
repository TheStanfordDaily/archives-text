# Stanford sails south to UCSB
## Cardinal to test female sailors, youth in Southern California 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
After a successful weekend
down in Santa Cruz, the Stanford
sailing team will travel further
south to sail in the Women's Fall
Championships and Frosh / Soph
Championships this weekend at
UC-Santa Barbara.

Two Cardinal sailors will com
pete in the Women's Fall Champi
onships. Junior Alice Mannard
and sophomore Heather Rogers
will sail in Division A as the
favorites. Freshmen Taylor
Robinson and Meghan Higgins
will sail in Division B, but will
participate without any expecta
tions to win. Instead, head coach

Steve Bourdow hopes that the
event will provide a good learning
experience for the pair.
Bourdow plans on sending five
or six teams to compete in the
Frosh/Soph regatta. As of now,
the teams that will sail include
sophomores Phil Barow and
Daven Thomas, freshmen Ben
Cain and Jessica Knape, sopho
mores Danny Zimbaldi and Betsy
Carmichael, freshmen Tyler
Doyle and Jennifer Cromwell,
sophomore Jeff Graves and junior
Kristen Honey, and freshmen
Chien Si Harriman and Uma
Sanghu. The regatta gets its name
from requiring that each skipper
must be a freshman or sopho
more. The crew, on the other
hand, can be from any class.
Of the two regattas, the
Women's Fall Championships is
more significant. Winning the
championship will give Stanford
the opportunity to sail in selective
intersectional regattas coming up
this spring, most of which will
take place in the East. As these
events invite only one school
from the West, if Stanford places
first in the Women's Fall Cham
pionships, the women's team can
claim that one invitation and
force schools like California out.
The Frosh/Soph Champi
onships in comparison is not a
major event for the Cardinal,
though Stanford views the com
petition as a team-building oppor
tunity. Bourdow would like to see
Stanford approach the regatta
just like it would approach any

other important race. "We have
the chance to put together a solid
regatta this weekend," he said.
"All we need is intensity.
"In the past it has been our mis
fortune to be consistently inconsis

tent. We have the perfect opportu
nity to change this weekend."
The Frosh/Soph Champi
onships also will serve as a tune
up for the Cardinal's next major
intersectional, the North and

South Intersectional. Bourdow
already knows who will comprise
the starting team for the event,
but has not yet decided on which
tandem will go as the hack-up
squad.
