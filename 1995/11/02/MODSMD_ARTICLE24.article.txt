# Cardinal water polo hits the road
## Three matches in three days prepare Stanford for MPSF tourney 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
With an impressive victory over Pepperdine last
Sunday, the Stanford men's water polo team (13-6,
2-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) snapped a
four-game losing streak and reestablished itself as a
force to be reckoned with. But the Cardinal will not
have any time at all to rest on its laurels, as Stan
ford begins a three-game road trip tomorrow that
will take it into the belly of the beast.
"This week is basically our road trip from hell,"
said head coach Dante Dettamanti. "We are playing
three top-10 teams in three days."
First up for the Cardinal is Long Beach State,
currently the seventh-ranked team in the nation.
The two teams clashed earlier this season, when
Stanford gave the 49ers a 14-3 drubbing. Neverthe
less, with the game on the road, Dettamanti expects
a tough contest.
"Long Beach is a much improved team from last
year, and even [from] earlier in the season," Detta
manti said. "They have had some trouble with
injuries and sickness in the past, but now everyone
is healthy and they are ready to play."
In addition to improved health, the 49ers hold a
distinct scheduling advantage. Because the Cardi
nal will play three successive games, Dettamanti
was unable to tailor his team's practices to a partic
ular opponent. Conversely, Long Beach has only
the Cardinal to focus on for this week and thus can
prepare more thoroughly for the match.
The 49er offense, like that of most squads,
revolves around the play of their two-meter man,
senior Kip Parsons. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds,

nal take their act to the road tomorrow.
