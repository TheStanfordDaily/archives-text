# Cardinal water polo hits the road
## Three matches in three days prepare Stanford for MPSF tourney 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
With an impressive victory over Pepperdine last
Sunday, the Stanford men's water polo team (13-6,
2-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) snapped a
four-game losing streak and reestablished itself as a
force to be reckoned with. But the Cardinal will not
have any time at all to rest on its laurels, as Stan
ford begins a three-game road trip tomorrow that
will take it into the belly of the beast.
"This week is basically our road trip from hell,"
said head coach Dante Dettamanti. "We are playing
three top-10 teams in three days."
First up for the Cardinal is Long Beach State,
currently the seventh-ranked team in the nation.
The two teams clashed earlier this season, when
Stanford gave the 49ers a 14-3 drubbing. Neverthe
less, with the game on the road, Dettamanti expects
a tough contest.
"Long Beach is a much improved team from last
year, and even [from] earlier in the season," Detta
manti said. "They have had some trouble with
injuries and sickness in the past, but now everyone
is healthy and they are ready to play."
In addition to improved health, the 49ers hold a
distinct scheduling advantage. Because the Cardi
nal will play three successive games, Dettamanti
was unable to tailor his team's practices to a partic
ular opponent. Conversely, Long Beach has only
the Cardinal to focus on for this week and thus can
prepare more thoroughly for the match.
The 49er offense, like that of most squads,
revolves around the play of their two-meter man,
senior Kip Parsons. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds,

Junior two-meter man Brian Wallin and the Cardi
nal take their act to the road tomorrow.
Parsons is a big, strong center
forward who plays a very physical
game in the frontcourt.
Nevertheless, it generally
takes more than a prolific scoring
performance by an individual
player to win games, as Pepper
dine found out last Sunday. In
that contest, Pepperdine two
meter man Alan Herrmann
notched five goals against the
Cardinal, but his teammates were
essentially stifled, as Stanford
took the match 15-11.
Perhaps the most dangerous
aspect for the Cardinal concern
ing its upcoming contest with
Long Beach is what lies on the
horizon. After facing the 49ers,
Stanford must square off against
USC and UCLA. While both of
those teams certainly pose

formidable threats, the Cardinal
must make sure not to get caught
looking past a Long Beach team
that features a considerable
amount of talent. Treating any
team in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation lightly is a mis
take that can yield unpleasant
results.
"Long Beach is definitely a
team that we should be able to
beat if we play our game," Detta
manti said. "But I think that it
definitely could be a tough game,
especially if the guys don't go out
there focused and ready to play."
Indeed, it could prove crucial
for the Cardinal to assert itself
early against the 49ers. With
three games in three days, it
would be in the team's best inter
est to execute, build a substantial
lead and thus not have to suffer
the additional strain of a tight
game.
"Ideally, we would like to win
handily so that we can rest everv

one up for the games against USC
and UCLA," Dettamanti said.
"But again, all of that depends on
the guys playing at the level that
they are capable of playing."
While the prospect of compet
ing on three consecutive days may
seem daunting, Dettamanti
instead views the situation as an
opportunity for his team to pre
pare for the upcoming Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tour
ney, which will have the same
three-day format. With the win
ner of that tournament gaining
an automatic bid to the NCAA
championships, the competition
promises to be at least as tough as
this weekend's.
"These games will be some
thing of a dress rehearsal for the
league tourney," Dettamanti said.
"In that respect, this weekend
will be good preparation and will
provide us a chance to see where
we stand. And it all starts against
Long Beach."
