# Soccer to play host to Sac St.
## 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
With a Pacific 10 Confer
ence championship in its back
pocket and a seven-game win
ning streak in tow, the ninth
ranked Stanford women's soc
cer team (14-3-0 overall, 6-0
Pac-10) returns home to Harry
Maloney Field today for a mid
afternoon tune-up versus Cal
State Sacramento (3-15).
The Cardinal scored con
vincing wins over Washington
and Washington State this past
weekend to put the wraps on
its third consecutive confer
ence title. With only two regu
lar-season matches remaining,
the team must now avoid look
ing past an underachieving Sac
State team and ahead towards
N(:AA playoffs.
"Hopefully, there's no let
down. That's the key thing,"
said head coach lan Sawyers.
"We've won the Pac-10 and
we're on a high, but we've still
got to come out fired up to play.
Sac State's just the team that'll
come and surprise us — play
ing physical, sitting back,
defending and counterattack
ing — so we've got to be ready
for that. Our players have to be
mentally ready to go back into
battle."
The women have hit their
stride at the right time in the
season. Since suffering a 3-0
loss to top-ranked North Car
olina a month ago, the Cardinal

has run off seven straight wins
against the likes of No. 18 Oregon
State and No. 21 UCLA, outscor
ing its opponents by a combined
margin of 24-5.
"I don't know if we've peaked
yet," Sawyers said, "but I think
we're gaining a lot of momentum.
We've created a lot of chances all
year and haven't finished real
well, but recently we've been scor
ing a lot of goals."
That's due largely in part to
the efforts of junior forward Erin
Martin. Martin has collected
seven goals in the past four games
— including a three-goal perfor
mance in a 6-1 win over USC two
weekends ago — for a team-lead
ing total of 31 points (13 goals,
five assists). Senior midfielder
Carmel Murphy ranks second on
the team with 25 points on 10
goals and five assists.
Defensively, the Cardinal con
tinues to rely on the leadership
of senior defender Jessica Fisch
er. Fischer, who contributed a
goal and an assist in Friday's 3-1
win over Washington, was
named to Soccer America's
Women's Team of the Week, an
honor she garnered three times
last season.
The play of freshman goalie
Erin Bryla also has not gone

unnoticed. Bryla boasts a 0.79
goals-against average and has
notched eight shutouts.
"Our goalkeeper's playing a
good game," Sawyers said. "She's
making saves when she needs to
and she's communicating well
with the defense."
Sacramento State, meanwhile,
could salvage its season with a
strong performance against the
Cardinal. The Hornets opened
the year with eight consecutive
losses and have dropped their last
seven. Senior forward Tisha
Smith leads the team in scoring
with 16 points on seven goals and
two assists.
With convincing wins today
and Sunday in its regular-season
finale versus Arizona, Stanford
hopes to gain the favor of the
NCAA tournament committee,
which will announce the 24-team
playoff field next Monday morn
ing at 8 a.m. Though currently
ranked ninth, the Cardinal is
keeping its fingers crossed for one
of eight first-round byes.
"Unless Santa Clara slips up
tonight, we may not get a bye,"
Sawyers said, "or we may get a
bye in another region. It's the
first year they've had this format,
so it's going to be interesting to
see how they do it."
Either way, the Cardinal must
concern itself with the Hornets in

behind.
