Two Stanford women's tennis representa
tives tested their strokes in the professional
Bank of the West Tournament yesterday at the
Oakland Coliseum Arena.
The nation's No. 1 collegiate doubles squad of
junior Katie Schlukebir and sophomore Ania
Blezsynski received a wildcard invitation into
the tournament, which also features tour stars
such as Mary Jo Fernandez, Zina Garrison-Jack
son and Venus Williams.
Shlukebir and Bleszynski took the first set 6-
4 against former Cardinal All-American Tami
Whitlinger and Katalina Cristea.
The professional tandem then woke up, cap
turing the next two sets and the match 4-6, 6-2,
6-2.
"It was a really good experience to get to play
in this kind of tournament with names like
these," Bleszynski said. "We would have liked to
have won, but it will definitely be good for us in
the long run just to have played in the tourna
ment."
