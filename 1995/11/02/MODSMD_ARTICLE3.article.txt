### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
For the first time in its 48-year histo
ry, KZSU has earned recognition as one
of the top non-commercial radio sta
tions in the nation, according to t he Col
lege Music Journal (CMJ).
The Oct. 9 issue of the journal listed
Stanford's radio station as one of 77
"core radio reporters." The journal lists
the top 200 non-commercial radio sta
tions in each issue, with the best
ranked in the core radio reporter cate
gory.
KZSU's music director, senior Chris
tine Williams, said inclusion on the
journal's list is the result of recent im
provements made by the station.
"Five or seven years ago, we weren't
a very strong radio station," she said.
"We played mostly commercial stuff. I
think that CMJ finally recognizes that
KZSU has changed drastically."
KZSU program director Tim Rough
garden, a junior, also credited the sta
tion's commitment to change. "We al
ways thought we were good enough for
the core group," he said. "It's been a
long process of improvement over the
last three or four years.
"Certainly a big part of it has been
our music department," he added. "We
have a lot of hard-working music direc
tors promoting our name. People now
look to us more as a leader in experi

mental music and as an innovative sta
tion, whereas others are dictated by
what record companies tell them to
play."
According to Williams, core radio sta
tions are chosen based on their influ
ence on their local communities. Each
radio stiit ion submits a weekly list oft he
music it plays, and the staff at the jour
nal judges the quality of programming
based on those reports.
Williams said KZSU is one of the few
radio stations that reports music it ac
tually plays on the air.
"We make out our charts from actu
al airplay, unlike many other college
stations," which often fabricate the con
tent of their programming, she said.
Williams said the new recognition
won't have any official rewards but will
help to bolster the station's image.
"It's going to improve our reputation
greatly with record companies," she
said. "We'll get much more music and
attention from them, and they'll know
that having us play their music will be
much more important. I think it will
have a positive effect in building our
music library and obtaining more rare
and new releases than in the past."
She added t hat the promotion to core
radio reporter status would boost
morale at the stat ion as well. "It's good
for us internally, because it means we're
getting a lot of respect nationally," she
said.
