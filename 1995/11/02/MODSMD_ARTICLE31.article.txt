# Grub Focus on: Señor Taco
## Burritos as big as your head 
### Andrew Keum Travis Vigil 
Not too long ago, Senor Taco consisted of a
dilapidated, walk-up shack with one rickcty
bench to sit on and eat. A little while after that,
taking a step backward in their ambient dining
facilities, they moved into a shiny steel motor
home parked in an empty lot wedged in be
tween Taco Bell and the Psychic Palm Reader,
proudly displaying a sign that read "No lard."
With its shady history behind it, Senor Taco
has now returned with a vengeance, finally

sporting a bright, new, colorful building befit
ting their delicious burritos.
Upon entering Senor Taco, one is visually
assaulted with bright things. Most notable are
the brightly hand-painted, personalized din
ing chairs. Unfortunately, the chairs labeled
"Pancho" and "Beto" were already taken, and
thus we were relegated to the cheap scats
which afforded a great view of El Camino Real
and the Shell station across the street.
It was a bustling Saturday night at Senor
Taco when we stopped in for our quick bite.
The line was long but the server was friendly
and the food was worth the wait. We shame
lessly indulged ourselves in a super chicken
burrito and a super came asada burrito, ac
companied by large Coke (with free refills, of
course) and agua fresca (cantaloupe water).
Never underestimate the size of a super
burrito at Senor Taco. After lugging these
monster-sized culinary works of wonder
(housed in charming, bright plastic baskets) to
our table, we set out on a quest to sec the bot
tom of that tin-foil wrapper which held the

treats. Along with the obligatory meat and rice
(although Senor Taco also takes pride in its ex
tensive line of vegetarian options), the burri
tos included sour cream, lettuce, guacamole,
cheese, beans, jalapenos, carrots (not appreci
ated) and strategically placed bay leaves to
choke on. Available on the side for those with
taste buds o' steel were both red and green chili
sauces.
The overall quality of these burritos is the
best in the Bay Area (eat your heart out, Taco
Bell). The chicken was juicy and comfortably
spicy. The carne asada (sautded beef) was ten
der and enticing. Still, the burrito was not
without its quirks. It was quite surprising to
discover carrots and bay leaves in the burritos,
and the mixture of hot and cold elements
within the burritos offered something of an
oxymoronic taste sensation. But all this can be
overlooked by the sheer size and power of a
Senor Taco burrito.
The impressive and imposing size of Senor
Taco's super burritos can only be matched by
the even more impressive and imposing uni

sex bathroom. The bathroom, in keeping with
the overall motif oflarge bright things, was ap
propriately decorated with colorful tiles and
industrial-strength super-suck-flush toilet
bowl. The sink and the toilet occupied one
meager corner of the bathroom, while the rest
of the room sprawls to an empty white space,
reminiscent of a vacant handball court. Our
trip to the bathroom thus completed our jour
ney to the belly of Senor Taco's world of culi
nary creations.
So we left, our bellies stuffed with Senor
Taco's goodies and our eyes sagging with post
dinner exhaustion. We smiled wearily at our
fellow diners, looking forward to the not too
distant future when we shall return and claim
our rightful thrones, "Pancho" and "Beto."
