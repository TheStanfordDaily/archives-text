# The
						show, the after-party, THE INTERVIEW

### Ciara Stephens 
S\ A w man, nobody in this world can
touch Jodeci live. And I'm not
just savin' that. I ven if I wasn't in
this group, I would still say it."
Hard to touch? Try hard to roach. After
weeks of trying to squeeze into the over
whelmingly hectic tour schedule of this sexv
quartet, I was finally talking with the smooth
yet charming Mr. Daivin.
Jodeci, containing two sets of brothers ( k
Ci and JoJo Hailey and DeVante and Daivin
DeClrate), burst onto the hip-hop scene in
1991 with "forever My Lady." Competing
against all the other all-male groups that
seemed to Hood the hip-hop arena at the time,
such as Boy/ II Men and Shai, Jodeci seemed to
win the public's devotion. They created a new
sound, a fusion ol R&B and hip hop that they
have labeled "sexual R&B." Their latest album,
" I he Show, the After-Party, the I Jotel," mag
nifies the groups sexual side, relating the entic
ing chronicle ol the group's life on the road.
In response to constant criticism of the
group's explicitly raw sexual lyrics, Mr. I )alvin
speaks candidly about the genuine foundation
ot their songs. "What we sing about is what we
believe in. We believe in love, we sing about
love. Sex is real, we sing about sex. We don't
sing about violence. We weren't raised up in no
gangs. We don't sing about nothin' like that
because we don't know about nothin' like that.
We sing about love. But you know we might
sometimes sing about nasty love or nasty sex.
It's all about our job, what we do."
So what about Jodeci's outlook on love?
Collecting a vast audience of female admirers
over the years, Jodeci have come to be known
as some of hip-hop's most notorious players.
Members have been seen courting such infa
mously sexy women as Mary I. Blige, T-Boz of
TLC fame and Madonna. "To me, love is find
ing a person or somebody bringing out differ
ent sides of you." Daivin thoughtfully pauses
and begins again with subtle romanticism.
"That's gotta be love. Because it takes more
than just anybody to bring out different things
about you, especially good things. Finding
somebody you're willing to give your all to, I
guess is lovin' somebody. I've never been in
love myself... so that's what I believe in."
Recently the group took a socially con
scious stand against a disease that is
rapidly plaguing America, stressing
their love for life. Realizing that many of their
songs perpetuate sex and convey messages ot
sexual promiscuity, Jodeci felt a responsibility
to spearhead the Urban Aid for LlMbeat tour.
LlFEbcat's Tour Outreach Program set up ta
bles at each venue with condoms and infor
mation about safe sex and the AIDS virus.
"Being that the group is kinda like a sexual
group, which is no surprise, its like people
come and tell us all the time, 'Me and my
boyfriend made love to you all's tape,' or 'We
do it to you all's tape' or whatever, so I was like,
I ley man it's our responsibility, or the least we
could do is let our fans know, especially our
young fans, that AIDS is not prejudiced to age
limit. And let everybody know that i! you're
gonna make love to our tape, put on a con
dom, be safe about it.' "

I iowever, this sudden surge of responsibil
ity has not transformed the group's image to
that of a role model. Recognizing that their
lyrics and their actions send somewhat con
flicting messages, Dalvin intimates that the
pressures of being a role model are not some
thing Jodeci is ready to undertake. "Being a
role model is a hard job to have because peo
ple seem to forget sometimes that you're
human too. And, you know, everybody
makes mistakes. Once you're a role model or
you put yourself as a role model, the first time
you slip up and you have a crisis of your own,
people wanna bring you down and tear you
down."
Nevertheless, Jodeci has seemed to amass a
following that loves their bad-boy image, a
characterization that hasn't been with them
all their lives. The two sets of brothers began
their musical career on the gospel circuit in
North Carolina. In their evolution from the
gospel circuit to hip-hop cult status, their
music has undergone a myriad of changes,
from the gospel tunes of their youth to the
ballads on "Forever My Lady" and the sensu
al pleas on "Diary of a Mad Band," to the
overtly sexual lyrics of songs like "Freakin'
You" off their latest album. When asked how
the group managed to reconcile their reli
gious beliefs with the messages in their music,
Mr. Dalvin replies with astonishing reverence.
"What we try to do is not mix the two. It's like
church is on one hand and what we do is on
the other hand," says 1 )alvin, oblivious to the
interminable connection between the two.
"The only way we involve church in what we
do is in our beliefs and our morals and what
our parents taught us as tar as being good
people and doin' unto others as you want
them to do unto you. But as far as tryin' to mix
(iod with sex, we don't try to because that's
not right. Once people start doin' that, (iod
seems to condemn them because we know
better than that."

$o now they're on the road again. Fans
have waited three years to see the quar
tet in person, and now the group is
headlining a tour that features some of the
hottest and biggest names in hip-hop today,
including Naughty By Nature, Faith, Notori
ous 8.1.C1. and Mary ). Blige. Dalvin express
es amazement at the tour's success. "The tour
is good. Everywhere's been sellin' out. Been
packed out. We've been gettin' a good re
sponse. You know, there hasn't been any vio
lence on the tour. It's been, like, a positive
tour. It's not too often that you get a lot ol rap
groups, even black groups together, that
there's not a lot of violence."
Much of Jodeci's popularity can be attrib
uted to their creativity and their ability to make
songs without catering to the public. "Some
people in this business can get caught into one
style. 'Let's just keep doin' this. That's what
made us the first time. Keep doin' it. Keep doin'
it. Keep doin' it.' To me, that's not bein' happy,"
I >alvin asserts vehemently. "We make music
that we like. We don't make music because peo
ple are gonna buy it. Everybody's not always
gonna like your album. Everybody's not always
gonna like what you do. You're gonna have cra
zies that are gonna bring you down and say that
you can't do it or more. But we make songs that
we like, that we feel is necessary at the time. We
don't try to make albums that sound like the
last album, that sound like the last album, that
sound like the last album. Every one of our al
bums has totally different concepts or sounds
totally different. The songs talk about totally
different things."
So now that we've heard the albums, what
goes into a live lodeci performance that
doesn't come across on tape? "We don't have
people there to make up our show, to tell us
what to do," Palvin states proudly. "We tell
people what to play, what instruments to use,
what drum sets to use. Even in the show, we get
on the instruments ourselves and play'em. Be-

cause we're all musically inclined as far as, like,
song wise, lodeci is a group like ... we do
everything ourselves, even the artwork on our
allium cover, the clothes we wear, everything.
In a live show, we give it our all. The best we
can. And we don't leave the arena until every
body feels like we've given them our all."
Not only are the members of lodeci all
musically inclined, but they are also
involved in separate production
projects. DeVante runs Swing Mob Produc
tions, JoJo has J&J Productions and K-Ci and
Dalvin head Clownin'. DeVante just finished
taping the video for his first solo cut, "Gin and
Juice," off the "Dangerous Minds" soundtrack
in the mean streets of Charleston, West Vir
ginia. All this has fans wondering if lodeci will
manage to stay together.
Dalvin confidently says that won't be a
problem. "Anytime you get four professional
people together and being that we are so
young, we're gonna hump heads. You know,
because everyone's creatively talented," boasts
Dalvin of his fellow members. "You're always
gonna have your downfalls and your argu
ments. but when it's time to get down to busi
ness, we always come together."
I)ecked out on their album cover in fedoras
and business suits, it's hard to ignore Jodeci's
apparent maturity since the hip-hop gangster
image of 1991. business is what lodeci is all
about, from the studio, to the video, to the
album. See you at the show....
