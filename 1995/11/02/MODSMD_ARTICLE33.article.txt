I ily Ng listens to her grandparents tell
their life stories with an ear trained for dia
loguc. She relishes the opportunity to enjoy
the company of their marriage, like old
friends conversing after a lengthy separation.
Most students can relate to this love tor

one's elders, Init few make the time

to him their grandparents
history and then have it
shown at a movie theater.

Ng's 16mm film, "Pic
tures," is her second project in

her second year at Stanford's
Documentary Film and Video
production program. The Film

Arts Festival, sponsored by the Film
Arts Foundation, will show "Pit.
tures" alone with % other movies in

its comprehensive, six day "snapshot"

Northern California. The festival, run

11 ing from Nov. 1 > and on Nov. 10, starts
.it the ( astro, moves to the Roxie and ends

in Berkeley s I ( I heater.
l ive students from Stanford's 111 m pro
gram, several alumni and one faculty mem
her, lasmina Bojic, will have their projects
shown .it the festival this year. Ol the current

Two films, both Stanford affiliated, exemplih

life history ol Ng's (ihinese-born grandpar
cuts while another project, "Truth Under
Siege" lorcefully pulls you into the chaos ol
former Yugoslavia and then gently details
the lives of its unsung heroes.
A separated love
"Pictures" i hronicles Ng's grandparents as
they leave and return to ( hina, tinally coming
to rest in America alter a long separation dut
ing the ( onimunist revolution. The short
film takes place in their I os Angeles home. Ng
expresses the feelings grandchildren have for
their foreign born grandparents as the\ listen
to a history to which they can never fully re
late, but identify with and love.
In the opening scenes, Ng uses close upsol
the grandmother's aged hands as she gardens
and a wok with trying vegetables as the grand
father cooks the family meals. I ater, shots of
black and white photographs from the grand
parents' past are interspersed in the film, ex
plaining the title and tilling out the personal
histories.
Ng provides a voice-over narration that
strives to objectively portray the lives ol peo
pie for whom she cares deeply. She also trans
lates for her grandparents as they explain
their long separation from each other.
"Cirandpa says that in English there are
many ways to say how to miss someone, but
in Chinese there are less ways of saying the
same things, or with the same meanings," Ng
says in the narration.
She ends the lllm with a question and a

breaking voice: "How does one convey the
feeling of a hanging heart?"

"I always wanted to make an oral his
torvot them." Ni!savs about her

protect. "There is no

better media

th a n

film
112 or

B u t
it is an

sive un
dertaking.
She spent

$3,000 to 1
make this
ni n e in i iui t e

111ni which she
shot in tour days

and edited down
in one hectic
month.

"I'm really excited
by it. Mut at the same
time there are bigger

hurdles to come, she
says. If Ng >.an secure the

funding, her next protect "
w ill take her to I long kong

to film a more ambitious docu-

reunilication. She hopes to document people

Media kills
In another corner of the world .1 hot war
rages, captivating media attention as post
( old War politics dwindle into nationalist
terror.
Since 1991, the world news media has cov
ered the war in the Balkans from the outside,
hut how many know of the internal media
struggles 111 the countries themselves?
Jasmina Bojic, a Slavic Department lectur-

er from the former Yugoslavia
and a journalist, acted as a re
searcher for"Truth Under

Siege — Dissident media in
the wars ol the Yugoslav sir
cession." It is a fascinating,

hour-long documentary
that was shot in Serbia,
Croatia and Bosnia-

i terzogovma.
This video is last

on its feet, com
pelling and a com
plete antithesis to
the tone of loving
i .... 1

care in Ng's "Pic -
tu res.'
"Fropa

ganda started
this war,"
savs a voice
i

as we see
pictu i" e s
of

w rock e ii
buildings and armed

soldiers in the opening titles.
1 he video ultimately oortravs the

"bit;' media in the three states as colluding
agents with their respective governments.
I he media foment nationalist bloodlust with
rhetoric on the streets, in the newspapers and
on television news programs.
" I he media are to blame for everything
going on here, s.i\s a woman in Belgrade.
I hen we see a cut to an anchor for Bosnian
Television, "We broadcast at least 73 percent
of the truth,' he says.
As the video cameras intersperse scenes of
wrecked cities with those of architectural
beauty in former Yugoslavia, one can't help
but curse the war. I he documentary visually
explains that a once-beautiful Yugoslavia is
now a horrific mess.
"Truth Under Siege" is a bit muddled in

the beginning, but it finds its tocus and works
its way into the viewer like a powerful novel,
even though this is the real world. ( ameras
travel from Belgrade to Split, Croatia to Sara
jevo, where we listen to the accounts of 1111
derground journalists in the three cities. We
witness them battle the "big" media in a war
for truth and propaganda-free reporting. I lie
internal struggle taxes these independent
magazine writers, newspaper editors and
radio station DJ's. The pressures of poverty,
violence and government-sanctioned lies
cross their faces as they tell their stories.
The subjects change throughout this inter
national tour, but certain stars surface, like
Mladen Kristic. He is a young writer for
"I)ani," an alternative magazine in Sarajevo,
who pushes the limits as he tries to report ob
jectively on the war rather than repeat the
Bosnian government's party line.
"I don't know anything about the future,
that's what the war taught me," he says.
"This is hell, but we try to put just a little
bit of paradise in this hell." he continues, this
time from a small club in Sarajevo where
grenades have exploded around the building
as people are dancing inside.
Through the individual heroes, the film
tells us that governments in all three coun
tries removed editors who were against the
war policy, and replaced them with more
strident nationalists, people who don't mind
politically slanted coverage. But there are
those who came out and protested their gov
ernments' media policy and strove to com
municate with dissident elements across the

war-drawn boundaries. More than any
thing, you leave this documentary with .1

personal connection to the lournalists
whose stories would never have been told
were it not for this film.

"Before the war, I felt I was forever a
teenager, says the young Sarajevan
Kristic. "After this war experience,

you have to grow older. Shellmgs you
know, that's some kind of lottery:
v.......1.1 U . I ...J .....1.1 1,..

lou could be dead, you could be
not, that's it.'
