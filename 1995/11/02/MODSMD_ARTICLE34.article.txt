# Half Cocked
## Indie rock film 
### 
You'd really have to know where to
look to catch a screening of "Half-
Cocked," the year-old indepen
dent feature from first-time filmmakers
Michael Galinski and Sukt Hawley. For
the moment, in fact, Galinski and 1 iawley
have the only two prints in existence.
That's hard to believe given the level of in
terest produced by this penny-pinched
filmatic testament to the do-it-yourselt
ethic.
The film tells the rambling story of .1
group of penniless teens from Louisville,
Kv. who fortuitously transform — by way
of a stolen van full of musical equipment
— the disillusionment of their dead-end
lives into the hard-won creative fulfill
ment of unknown indie rockers on the
road. Winning praise at near-private
screenings across the country and at un
derground film festivals in Chicago and
in New York, "Half-Cocked" has still
managed to elude widespread success.
Appropriately, both Galinski and
Hawley have intimate knowledge of the
non-mainstream life. Veterans of the
indie club circuit themselves — Galinski
as a member of New York noise-pop trio
Sleepyhead and Hawley in support of her
roommate's fledgling band Ruby Falls —
they wrote the script from personal expe
rience, recruiting friends from other
bands to come to Kentucky to play the
parts. Galinski says," Wc wanted to docu
ment small bands touring in the South:
This is what it's like, this is what you do."
Hawley, the director of the project, is
quick to add, "But it's not a documentary
at all. We decided to go ahead and use
musicians who are really just playing
themselves. 1 mean, not literally, but who
are playing people very much like them.
The script is all fiction, and the idea
would be that it was a document, not a
documentary."
Filmed in Louisville, Chattanooga and
Nashville, in neighborhoods and clubs in
which the actors themselves play, the film
is an attempt to make permanent the al
ways-changing lifestyle of the relentless,
passionate and under-recognized. "In 10
years," says Galinski, "its definitely going
to be a different scene, and we wanted to
capture it while it's still there."
Having worked as an assistant on
film crews and in the cutting
room, film school graduate Haw
ley never thought she'd get a shot at mak
ing her own feature film so early in her ca
reer. "1 thought I would have to wait until
I was 40 and had some huge epiphany be
fore 1 could make a feature," she says. All
it really took, in fact, was a little optimism
and a small heap of cash.
"It was really inexpensive," Galinski

says, "as inexpensive as it could be and
still retain some sense of quality." The
cinematographer for the film, Galinski
had been taking pictures of his favorite
bands for years before he began raising
the money to do "Half-Cocked " "I'd al
ways wanted to move 011 to film," he says.
"Realizing that no one was going to give
me a camera and say, I lere, go ahead and
shoot this $2 million film,' convinced me
that we just had to make our own."
Their carefree attitude, however, only
goes so far. Both filmmakers impressed
upon everyone involved the level of com
mitment they expected. "It can't just be a
side thing," says Hawley, "just because of
the schedules involved and how much
money you're spending daily. It's got to be
all or nothing."
The cast and crew showed up in
Louisville to rehearse one week before
shooting began. "That was a little shaky
and scary," recollects Hawley. "It's freaky
to act around people you know when
you're not an actor. It was like, 'I know
these people and 1 live with some of these
people, and whatever I do, I'm going to
hear about for a long time.' just putting
yourself out like that was nerve-wrack
ing."
Unpredictability marked the next 15
days of shooting, demanding compro
mise, flexibility and patience. Galinski
and Hawley wrote new scenes on the fly,
adjusting to inconveniences (their van
broke down and got towed once) and
sudden reversals of plan. "The first thing
we learned even before we started writing
was just that we were going to have to
compromise a hell of a lot," says Galinski.
"Any idea we'd have we couldn't really get
stuck to because if it couldn't get done, it
wasn't going to get done."
The most daunting challenge for
Galinski and Hawley came after
they finished shooting, even after
they wrapped up six months of post-pro
duction. "Our intention," says Galinski,
"was to show it a little, to get some press,
and in the meantime be trying to find a
distributor." This last goal became a
stumbling block.
After a glowing and positive review in
film trade magazine Variety, Galinski and
Hawley were swamped with interest. The
flood of inquiries, however, dried up
when the low-budget signature of the
film emerged. Hawley laughs when re
membering those first few months after
the film was finally done: "It was really
weird. We got a million calls a month
from, like, Disney and Warner Bros., but
I just thought, 'It's 16mm and black and
white. Of course they're not interested.' I
didn't even call some of them back."

"It's been a year, and we've been pretty
much rejected by everybody that distrib
utes film," adds Galinski.
Both filmmakers, however, soon
found that critical acclaim and word-of
mouth attention attracted a pretty steady
audience to the few screenings they man
aged to organize. "It was not that hard to
get a show in New York City," remembers
Hawley. "We'd show it at a party, and then
that would lead to an art gallery owner
saying, 'Oh, let's show it in my gallery.'
People would keep coming to see it, more
than once, actually. We kept getting really
good press."
From there Galinski and Hawley de
cided to take the unprecedented step of
taking the film on the road to play in clubs
alongside such bands as Freakwater, Fuck
and Galinski's own Sleepyhead. "It's been
kind of unintentionally successful as a
self-distributed film. We can take it on
tour to all the rock clubs because we know
that the audience is out there."
There's something satisfying about
the struggles Galinski and Hawley
have had to endure to get their
film an audience. Indie rock's in
domitable credibility arises from its affin
ity for hardship, from its regretless aban
donment of mass appeal. Bands like the
one portrayed in "Half-Cocked" would
appreciate the set-backs and disappoint
ments the filmmakers have experienced.
Galinski adds that filmmaking pre
sents even more challenges than the aver
age indie musician ever faces. "With
music you can have a more 10-fi aspect
more easily. Anyone can go out and buy a
four-track and make a record. In some
ways that's great and in some ways that's
bad because there's a lot of crap you have
to sift through. But with film, you can't do
that. You can make a low budget film, but
it's just not the same. The lowest-budget
film is like the highest-budget record in
twice the effort."
Both Galinski and Hawley, though,
seem satisfied with everything they've
gone through, confident that when you
do track down their elusive film, you will
be happy with what you find. So satisfied,
even, that you'll want more, and they're
both happy to deliver, despite the strug
gle. "We have a new script," says Galinski,
"and we're really excited about doing it.
It's going to be frustrating, but, you know,
what isn't?"

You'd really have to know where to
look to catch a screening of "Half-
Cocked," the year-old indepen
dent feature from first-time filmmakers
Michael Galinski and Sukt Hawley. For
the moment, in fact, Galinski and 1 iawley
have the only two prints in existence.
That's hard to believe given the level of in
terest produced by this penny-pinched
filmatic testament to the do-it-yourselt
ethic.
The film tells the rambling story of .1
group of penniless teens from Louisville,
Kv. who fortuitously transform — by way
of a stolen van full of musical equipment
— the disillusionment of their dead-end
lives into the hard-won creative fulfill
ment of unknown indie rockers on the
road. Winning praise at near-private
screenings across the country and at un
derground film festivals in Chicago and
in New York, "Half-Cocked" has still
managed to elude widespread success.
Appropriately, both Galinski and
Hawley have intimate knowledge of the
non-mainstream life. Veterans of the
indie club circuit themselves — Galinski
as a member of New York noise-pop trio
Sleepyhead and Hawley in support of her
roommate's fledgling band Ruby Falls —
they wrote the script from personal expe
rience, recruiting friends from other
bands to come to Kentucky to play the
parts. Galinski says," Wc wanted to docu
ment small bands touring in the South:
This is what it's like, this is what you do."
Hawley, the director of the project, is
quick to add, "But it's not a documentary
at all. We decided to go ahead and use
musicians who are really just playing
themselves. 1 mean, not literally, but who
are playing people very much like them.
The script is all fiction, and the idea
would be that it was a document, not a
documentary."
Filmed in Louisville, Chattanooga and
Nashville, in neighborhoods and clubs in
which the actors themselves play, the film
is an attempt to make permanent the al
ways-changing lifestyle of the relentless,
passionate and under-recognized. "In 10
years," says Galinski, "its definitely going
to be a different scene, and we wanted to
capture it while it's still there."
Having worked as an assistant on
film crews and in the cutting
room, film school graduate Haw
ley never thought she'd get a shot at mak
ing her own feature film so early in her ca
reer. "1 thought I would have to wait until
I was 40 and had some huge epiphany be
fore 1 could make a feature," she says. All
it really took, in fact, was a little optimism
and a small heap of cash.
"It was really inexpensive," Galinski

says, "as inexpensive as it could be and
still retain some sense of quality." The
cinematographer for the film, Galinski
had been taking pictures of his favorite
bands for years before he began raising
the money to do "Half-Cocked " "I'd al
ways wanted to move 011 to film," he says.
"Realizing that no one was going to give
me a camera and say, I lere, go ahead and
shoot this $2 million film,' convinced me
that we just had to make our own."
Their carefree attitude, however, only
goes so far. Both filmmakers impressed
upon everyone involved the level of com
mitment they expected. "It can't just be a
side thing," says Hawley, "just because of
the schedules involved and how much
money you're spending daily. It's got to be
all or nothing."
The cast and crew showed up in
Louisville to rehearse one week before
shooting began. "That was a little shaky
and scary," recollects Hawley. "It's freaky
to act around people you know when
you're not an actor. It was like, 'I know
these people and 1 live with some of these
people, and whatever I do, I'm going to
hear about for a long time.' just putting
yourself out like that was nerve-wrack
ing."
Unpredictability marked the next 15
days of shooting, demanding compro
mise, flexibility and patience. Galinski
and Hawley wrote new scenes on the fly,
adjusting to inconveniences (their van
broke down and got towed once) and
sudden reversals of plan. "The first thing
we learned even before we started writing
was just that we were going to have to
compromise a hell of a lot," says Galinski.
"Any idea we'd have we couldn't really get
stuck to because if it couldn't get done, it
wasn't going to get done."
The most daunting challenge for
Galinski and Hawley came after
they finished shooting, even after
they wrapped up six months of post-pro
duction. "Our intention," says Galinski,
"was to show it a little, to get some press,
and in the meantime be trying to find a
distributor." This last goal became a
stumbling block.
After a glowing and positive review in
film trade magazine Variety, Galinski and
Hawley were swamped with interest. The
flood of inquiries, however, dried up
when the low-budget signature of the
film emerged. Hawley laughs when re
membering those first few months after
the film was finally done: "It was really
weird. We got a million calls a month
from, like, Disney and Warner Bros., but
I just thought, 'It's 16mm and black and
white. Of course they're not interested.' I
didn't even call some of them back."

"It's been a year, and we've been pretty
much rejected by everybody that distrib
utes film," adds Galinski.
Both filmmakers, however, soon
found that critical acclaim and word-of
mouth attention attracted a pretty steady
audience to the few screenings they man
aged to organize. "It was not that hard to
get a show in New York City," remembers
Hawley. "We'd show it at a party, and then
that would lead to an art gallery owner
saying, 'Oh, let's show it in my gallery.'
People would keep coming to see it, more
than once, actually. We kept getting really
good press."
From there Galinski and Hawley de
cided to take the unprecedented step of
taking the film on the road to play in clubs
alongside such bands as Freakwater, Fuck
and Galinski's own Sleepyhead. "It's been
kind of unintentionally successful as a
self-distributed film. We can take it on
tour to all the rock clubs because we know
that the audience is out there."
There's something satisfying about
the struggles Galinski and Hawley
have had to endure to get their
film an audience. Indie rock's in
domitable credibility arises from its affin
ity for hardship, from its regretless aban
donment of mass appeal. Bands like the
one portrayed in "Half-Cocked" would
appreciate the set-backs and disappoint
ments the filmmakers have experienced.
Galinski adds that filmmaking pre
sents even more challenges than the aver
age indie musician ever faces. "With
music you can have a more 10-fi aspect
more easily. Anyone can go out and buy a
