while vour mind will want to escape somewhere
else.
Art: beauty and pain
Beauty of art rubs uncomfortably against hor
ror ot circumstance in "Leaving Las Vegas," on
nationwide release Nov. 10. The new film by
British director Mike I iggis ("The Browning
Version," "Mr. lones," "Internal Affairs") won the
Silver Shell Award for best film at the San Se
bastien film festival in September.
1 iggis, in an interview held during his public
itv visit to San Francisco, says that he is
"shocked by the response th.it the film has re
ceived. I didn't expect anything like this, he
says. I le speaks softly, surprise tangible in his be
wildered look. Added to his long trizz\ hair, his
casual clothing and Ins gentle features, his mo
mentary confusion makes I iggis appear much
younger and less sophisticated than he really is.
Perhaps he reacts this way because he sees
himself as something other than a filmmaker.
"I 'm a musician first and foremost," he insists. I le
says that he is "moonlighting" as a director. But
then, aware that his success may make this com
ment seem ungracious, he adds hastily, with a
sell deprecatory laugh, "Don't give up the day
job, eh?"
Shot on super 16mm film, the movie is proof
that a limited budget (Figgis' single source, Lu
miere studios in France, put up $3.5 million),
tight timetables (the movie was shot in 2N days)
and an "amateur medium" can still produce a
highly aesthetic and polished production when
the one man band behind it all has talent. 1 iggis
not only directed, he wrote the screenplay and
the musical score and makes a cameo appear
ance.
Nicholas Cage and L.lisabeth Shue star in this
compelling and disturbing story which focuses
around the lives of an avowed alcoholic, Ben
(Cage), and a street-wise prostitute, Sera (Shue).
They are two lost souls who accidentally stumble

upon one another. Yet, out ot their destitution
and need comes something affirming and unde
structive — love.
"Why shouldn't it look beautiful?" counters
the director, eyebrows raised, when questioned
about the apparent disparity between content
and style.
And he is right.
lust as the characters in the film are able, at
times, to laugh at themselves and the situation
they are in, so we should not assume that the por
trayal of a stark and grim reality naturally points
to dreary and lackluster film techniques.
Figgis conveys a poignant message: From mo
ments of pain stem images of beauty.
They: swim against the stream
"I lave you ever had the feeling that the world's
left you behind?" wails the song that floods the au
ditorium as the movie begins. The words articu
late a dominant theme of "Leaving I as Vegas."
Figgis describes the two leading characters in
the film as "out of sync." I le does not see them or
their lives as failures, however. His candid ex
pression and slight frown testify to his own sin
cere belief in them.
They are lonely individuals "swimming
against the stream," he says. T he rest of society
has somehow left them behind.
Figgis has always had a strong sympathy for
the individual and an acute awareness of gang be
havior. Having grown up in Africa and then
moved at a young age to live in a rough area ot
Newcastle, in the north of Fngland, he obviously
appreciates what it feels like to be an outsider. I le
sits on the edge of the large sofa in his room as he
explains his suspicion of the group mentality
which singles out and rejects certain individuals.
He looks down for a moment to concentrate on
articulating precisely what lie means.
"I always feel sorry for victims," says Figgis.
He has always been fascinated with "anti-so
cial" personalities who are "picked on" by soci
ety. Prostitutes, alcoholics and drug addicts all
come under his definition. In a puzzled voice, he
notes that even in "Internal Affairs," he finds
Richard (lere's "bad guy " more sympathetic than
Andy Garcia.
"I'm not impressed with popular heroes who
possess the endorsement of their peers," Figgis
says with conviction.
Rather, he perceives courage in"the bravery of
the individual when he is picked on." It is the
bravery not to give in, either to the system of to
self-delusion.
He: tells truth over delusion
The film's two lead characters, Ben and Sera,

possess terrible bravery and a deep sense of vul
nerability in the stark and often painful honesty
with which they view their own lives.
Ben has drunk away his family, friends and
job. With nothing else to lose, he heads to Las
Vegas for one final binge. He leaves LA. because
the stores close too early, 1 fe kept running out of
booze because he forgot to look at his watch, he
explains to Sera in one of many exchanges that

nervously border be-

tween the comic
an d th e ab -

surd.
Ben now
has one sim
ple aim: "I
came hereto
drink

myself to death," he says. He is perfectly serious.
I le sticks to his goal with a passion and dedica
tion that seem to belie the utter hopelessness ol
his life. Or perhaps it is just that he has decided
that he wants to be successful at something —
and he is good at drinking.
Cage, who won best actor award at San Se
bastien for his role, never allows the character he
plays to become monotonous, self-pitying or to
tally bitter. This would be disastrous for both the
film and the amount of sympathy which Ben
elicits.
Cage avoids this pitfall by his unique method
of line delivery. "He delivers lines with a ghost of
the comedic," explains Figgis, who obviously ad
mires the actor. It is not that what he is saying is

tunny, it is rather the reverse. The more appar
ently comic comments are in fact often the sad
dest or blackest in the film.
Figgis takes as an example the scene in which
Sera gives Ben various moving-in presents.
Among them is a shiny silver hip-flask. Ben's re
sponse is simply, "Looks like I'm with the right
girl." One reaction is to laugh — the other is to
cringe.

It is a moment when two

"twisted souls" momentar
ily connect, when Sera
gives Ben something

much more valuable
than a

keepsake. She offers him, at this instant at least,
.in unconditional understanding.
liggis finds it upsetting when the audience
laughs. "That moment made me cry," he ex
plains. The director's openness is disarming.
1 lis emotional vulnerability and artistic integri
ty shine through his words. He is realistic
enough to admit that this is only a film and yet
in the same breath he explains his characters al
most as if he feels it is his duty to protect them.
It is this capacity to generate dual responses
that enables Figgis to construct an emotional
tight-rope that runs the length of the film. Just
as the characters oscillate between insecurity
and strength — one often swinging up as the
other swings down — the audience is forever

caught between grin and grimace.
She: hopes over truth
Sera approaches her "profession" with the
same apparent clear-sightedness as Ben does his
drinking. "I bring out the best in the men who
fuck me," she says to an unknown listener early
in the film. (It later turns out to be her therapist,
to whom she is recounting the events we sec de
picted.) "1 can turn on a dime," she says. "This
is their fantasy and I become it. It's a perfor
mance."
Sera seems to harbor no illusions. Prostitu
tion is her job and she is good at it. Yet for all
that, the character possesses an elusive quality
that begs for some form ot protection, almost as
it Sera needs to be shielded from her own life.
Figgis explains that this dichotomy attracted
him to the character when he first read John
O'Brien's novel, from which the film is adapted.
It began with a superficial distinction: "There
was a difference between what she was saying
and what she looked like,'' Figgis says.
Llisabeth Shue superbly brings out (his con
tradiction. At moments, says I iggis, she ap
pears Bergmanesque and at others like the all
American girl next door: straight teeth, athlet
ic build, perfect smile.
Shue adds another dimension ot her own. At
moments, she manages to give Sera a credible,
almost childlike, vulnerability. I iggis found the
interpretation fascinating and pushed it in the
film. Thus, when Sera tells Ben on their first
encounter, "I think the tough times are finally
behind me ... my life is good," we remain un
convinced.
The result is a character that is complex and
believable. Sera may try desperately to give the
impression that "she has her shit sorted out,"
says I iggis, adopting the rhetoric of the coun
try he is visiting, but her tough talk and ges
tures are constantly belied by her vulnerable
glances.
Figgis uses close-ups of Shue's eyes almost as
an alternative narrative device. Shue's eyes ex
press what her character will never articulate in
words: her act is self-delusion, she isn't in con
trol any more than Ben and it hurts. "She is in
denial of something," says F iggis.
Love: casts a shadow
Vet, despite, or perhaps because of, the pain
and torment that the two characters endure, the
remarkable happens — they manage to fall in
love, or at least create something that comes
very close. For two people already so vulnera
ble, this is real risk-taking.
"Love is a hit of a liability," says Figgis. "It

leaves you open to danger.
The consequence for Sera is horrific. After
she tells Ben to get out ot her apartment, having
found him with another woman, she is gang
raped hv three young college-age kids. "Her
meter should have been bleeping," says Figgis
about the situation with the men, but it didn't
because love had left her "emotionally con
fused."
Figgis looks disturbed and shifts uncomfort
ably in his seat as he discusses the rape scene.
Presented in play-back as Sera sits bleeding in
the shower, the event is symbolic of Sera's vul
nerability and her role in the film as social vic
tim. Again in the film, we teeter on the brink of
two realities: one is easy to dismiss as cliche —
Sera is a prostitute and film always resort to the
rape scene to highlight the role; the other al
most makes us choke — we look into the abyss
of social sickness and still don't know how to
deal with the perversions we find there. The lat
ter appears to be Figgis'own reaction — he may
have written the scene, but he is still wrestling
with how to deal with it.
I ove, however, is still portrayed as a risk
worth taking. Figgis is too committed to be a
cynic. Love alone possesses the power to re
deem.
Love: survives vulnerability
"In a bi/arre way," explains Figgis, "people
spend their entire life looking for love, and
most, I think, don't find it. They fall in love at
regular intervals and go through those emo
tions."
But Sera and Ben "had something," he insists
with compassion. Whatever it was — and it is
in the past because, as becomes clear in Sera's
narrative to her therapist, Ben has died — the
force that binds them together for most of the
film accounts for the intensity which makes this
movie more than .1 tale about social outcasts.
It is love which moves Ben to describe Sera's
apartment as "the home of an angel."
It is love that allows the real truth of the film
to be revealed in the simple transparency ofthe
survivor Sera's words: "We both realized we
didn't have that much time and I accepted him
for who he was and didn't expect him to
change, and I think he felt that about me too."
"I loved him," she adds after a slight pause.
The words do not need to be said. In this ever
darkening filmic world of rough destruction
and pain, the glow love casts cannot be extin
guished. Figgis is a romantic artist after all.
Love, he says simply, "is the light ofthe film."
And that light lends even harsh reality a lumi
nescent, if fragile, beauty.

Ben now
has one sim
ple aim: "I
came hereto
drink

myself to death," he says. He is perfectly serious.
I le sticks to his goal with a passion and dedica
tion that seem to belie the utter hopelessness ol
his life. Or perhaps it is just that he has decided
that he wants to be successful at something —
and he is good at drinking.
Cage, who won best actor award at San Se
bastien for his role, never allows the character he
plays to become monotonous, self-pitying or to
tally bitter. This would be disastrous for both the
film and the amount of sympathy which Ben
elicits.
Cage avoids this pitfall by his unique method
of line delivery. "He delivers lines with a ghost of
the comedic," explains Figgis, who obviously ad
mires the actor. It is not that what he is saying is

tunny, it is rather the reverse. The more appar
ently comic comments are in fact often the sad
dest or blackest in the film.
Figgis takes as an example the scene in which
Sera gives Ben various moving-in presents.
Among them is a shiny silver hip-flask. Ben's re
sponse is simply, "Looks like I'm with the right
girl." One reaction is to laugh — the other is to

liggis finds it upsetting when the audience
laughs. "That moment made me cry," he ex
plains. The director's openness is disarming.
1 lis emotional vulnerability and artistic integri
ty shine through his words. He is realistic
enough to admit that this is only a film and yet
in the same breath he explains his characters al
most as if he feels it is his duty to protect them.
It is this capacity to generate dual responses
that enables Figgis to construct an emotional
tight-rope that runs the length of the film. Just
as the characters oscillate between insecurity
and strength — one often swinging up as the
other swings down — the audience is forever

caught between grin and grimace.
She: hopes over truth
Sera approaches her "profession" with the
same apparent clear-sightedness as Ben does his
drinking. "I bring out the best in the men who
fuck me," she says to an unknown listener early
in the film. (It later turns out to be her therapist,
to whom she is recounting the events we sec de
picted.) "1 can turn on a dime," she says. "This
is their fantasy and I become it. It's a perfor
mance."
Sera seems to harbor no illusions. Prostitu
tion is her job and she is good at it. Yet for all
that, the character possesses an elusive quality
that begs for some form ot protection, almost as
it Sera needs to be shielded from her own life.
Figgis explains that this dichotomy attracted
him to the character when he first read John
O'Brien's novel, from which the film is adapted.
It began with a superficial distinction: "There
was a difference between what she was saying
and what she looked like,'' Figgis says.
Llisabeth Shue superbly brings out (his con
tradiction. At moments, says I iggis, she ap
pears Bergmanesque and at others like the all
American girl next door: straight teeth, athlet
ic build, perfect smile.
Shue adds another dimension ot her own. At
moments, she manages to give Sera a credible,
almost childlike, vulnerability. I iggis found the
interpretation fascinating and pushed it in the
film. Thus, when Sera tells Ben on their first
encounter, "I think the tough times are finally
behind me ... my life is good," we remain un
convinced.
The result is a character that is complex and
believable. Sera may try desperately to give the
impression that "she has her shit sorted out,"
says I iggis, adopting the rhetoric of the coun
try he is visiting, but her tough talk and ges
tures are constantly belied by her vulnerable
glances.
Figgis uses close-ups of Shue's eyes almost as
an alternative narrative device. Shue's eyes ex
press what her character will never articulate in
words: her act is self-delusion, she isn't in con
trol any more than Ben and it hurts. "She is in
denial of something," says F iggis.
Love: casts a shadow
Vet, despite, or perhaps because of, the pain
and torment that the two characters endure, the
remarkable happens — they manage to fall in
love, or at least create something that comes
very close. For two people already so vulnera
ble, this is real risk-taking.
"Love is a hit of a liability," says Figgis. "It

leaves you open to danger.
The consequence for Sera is horrific. After
she tells Ben to get out ot her apartment, having
found him with another woman, she is gang
raped hv three young college-age kids. "Her
meter should have been bleeping," says Figgis
about the situation with the men, but it didn't
because love had left her "emotionally con
fused."
Figgis looks disturbed and shifts uncomfort
ably in his seat as he discusses the rape scene.
Presented in play-back as Sera sits bleeding in
the shower, the event is symbolic of Sera's vul
nerability and her role in the film as social vic
tim. Again in the film, we teeter on the brink of
two realities: one is easy to dismiss as cliche —
Sera is a prostitute and film always resort to the
rape scene to highlight the role; the other al
most makes us choke — we look into the abyss
of social sickness and still don't know how to
deal with the perversions we find there. The lat
ter appears to be Figgis'own reaction — he may
have written the scene, but he is still wrestling
with how to deal with it.
I ove, however, is still portrayed as a risk
worth taking. Figgis is too committed to be a
cynic. Love alone possesses the power to re
deem.
Love: survives vulnerability
"In a bi/arre way," explains Figgis, "people
spend their entire life looking for love, and
most, I think, don't find it. They fall in love at
regular intervals and go through those emo
tions."
But Sera and Ben "had something," he insists
with compassion. Whatever it was — and it is
in the past because, as becomes clear in Sera's
narrative to her therapist, Ben has died — the
force that binds them together for most of the
film accounts for the intensity which makes this
movie more than .1 tale about social outcasts.
It is love which moves Ben to describe Sera's
apartment as "the home of an angel."
It is love that allows the real truth of the film
to be revealed in the simple transparency ofthe
survivor Sera's words: "We both realized we
didn't have that much time and I accepted him
for who he was and didn't expect him to
change, and I think he felt that about me too."
"I loved him," she adds after a slight pause.
The words do not need to be said. In this ever
darkening filmic world of rough destruction
and pain, the glow love casts cannot be extin
guished. Figgis is a romantic artist after all.
Love, he says simply, "is the light ofthe film."
And that light lends even harsh reality a lumi
nescent, if fragile, beauty.

I lis senses reel, awash in the tide of alcohol that

The visual beauty of the new film "Leaving 1 as
Vegas" will keep your eyes fixed to the screen,
while vour mind will want to escape somewhere
else.
Art: beauty and pain
Beauty of art rubs uncomfortably against hor
ror ot circumstance in "Leaving Las Vegas," on
nationwide release Nov. 10. The new film by
British director Mike I iggis ("The Browning
Version," "Mr. lones," "Internal Affairs") won the
Silver Shell Award for best film at the San Se
bastien film festival in September.
1 iggis, in an interview held during his public
itv visit to San Francisco, says that he is
"shocked by the response th.it the film has re
ceived. I didn't expect anything like this, he
says. I le speaks softly, surprise tangible in his be
wildered look. Added to his long trizz\ hair, his
casual clothing and Ins gentle features, his mo
mentary confusion makes I iggis appear much
younger and less sophisticated than he really is.
Perhaps he reacts this way because he sees
himself as something other than a filmmaker.
"I 'm a musician first and foremost," he insists. I le
says that he is "moonlighting" as a director. But
then, aware that his success may make this com
ment seem ungracious, he adds hastily, with a
sell deprecatory laugh, "Don't give up the day
job, eh?"
Shot on super 16mm film, the movie is proof
that a limited budget (Figgis' single source, Lu
miere studios in France, put up $3.5 million),
tight timetables (the movie was shot in 2N days)
and an "amateur medium" can still produce a
highly aesthetic and polished production when
the one man band behind it all has talent. 1 iggis
not only directed, he wrote the screenplay and
the musical score and makes a cameo appear
ance.
Nicholas Cage and L.lisabeth Shue star in this
compelling and disturbing story which focuses
around the lives of an avowed alcoholic, Ben
(Cage), and a street-wise prostitute, Sera (Shue).
They are two lost souls who accidentally stumble

upon one another. Yet, out ot their destitution
and need comes something affirming and unde
structive — love.
"Why shouldn't it look beautiful?" counters
the director, eyebrows raised, when questioned
about the apparent disparity between content
and style.
And he is right.
lust as the characters in the film are able, at
times, to laugh at themselves and the situation
they are in, so we should not assume that the por
trayal of a stark and grim reality naturally points
to dreary and lackluster film techniques.
Figgis conveys a poignant message: From mo
ments of pain stem images of beauty.
They: swim against the stream
"I lave you ever had the feeling that the world's
left you behind?" wails the song that floods the au
ditorium as the movie begins. The words articu
late a dominant theme of "Leaving I as Vegas."
Figgis describes the two leading characters in
the film as "out of sync." I le does not see them or
their lives as failures, however. His candid ex
pression and slight frown testify to his own sin
cere belief in them.
They are lonely individuals "swimming
against the stream," he says. T he rest of society
has somehow left them behind.
Figgis has always had a strong sympathy for
the individual and an acute awareness of gang be
havior. Having grown up in Africa and then
moved at a young age to live in a rough area ot
Newcastle, in the north of Fngland, he obviously
appreciates what it feels like to be an outsider. I le
sits on the edge of the large sofa in his room as he
explains his suspicion of the group mentality
which singles out and rejects certain individuals.
He looks down for a moment to concentrate on
articulating precisely what lie means.
"I always feel sorry for victims," says Figgis.
He has always been fascinated with "anti-so
cial" personalities who are "picked on" by soci
ety. Prostitutes, alcoholics and drug addicts all
come under his definition. In a puzzled voice, he
notes that even in "Internal Affairs," he finds
Richard (lere's "bad guy " more sympathetic than
Andy Garcia.
"I'm not impressed with popular heroes who
possess the endorsement of their peers," Figgis
says with conviction.
Rather, he perceives courage in"the bravery of
the individual when he is picked on." It is the
bravery not to give in, either to the system of to
self-delusion.
He: tells truth over delusion
The film's two lead characters, Ben and Sera,

possess terrible bravery and a deep sense of vul
nerability in the stark and often painful honesty
with which they view their own lives.
Ben has drunk away his family, friends and
job. With nothing else to lose, he heads to Las
Vegas for one final binge. He leaves LA. because

about the situation with the men, but it didn't
because love had left her "emotionally con
fused."
Figgis looks disturbed and shifts uncomfort
ably in his seat as he discusses the rape scene.
Presented in play-back as Sera sits bleeding in
the shower, the event is symbolic of Sera's vul
nerability and her role in the film as social vic
tim. Again in the film, we teeter on the brink of
two realities: one is easy to dismiss as cliche —
Sera is a prostitute and film always resort to the
rape scene to highlight the role; the other al
most makes us choke — we look into the abyss
of social sickness and still don't know how to
deal with the perversions we find there. The lat
ter appears to be Figgis'own reaction — he may
have written the scene, but he is still wrestling
with how to deal with it.
I ove, however, is still portrayed as a risk
worth taking. Figgis is too committed to be a
cynic. Love alone possesses the power to re
deem.
Love: survives vulnerability
"In a bi/arre way," explains Figgis, "people
spend their entire life looking for love, and
most, I think, don't find it. They fall in love at
regular intervals and go through those emo
tions."
But Sera and Ben "had something," he insists
with compassion. Whatever it was — and it is
in the past because, as becomes clear in Sera's
narrative to her therapist, Ben has died — the
force that binds them together for most of the
film accounts for the intensity which makes this
movie more than .1 tale about social outcasts.
It is love which moves Ben to describe Sera's
apartment as "the home of an angel."
It is love that allows the real truth of the film
to be revealed in the simple transparency ofthe
survivor Sera's words: "We both realized we
didn't have that much time and I accepted him
for who he was and didn't expect him to
change, and I think he felt that about me too."
"I loved him," she adds after a slight pause.
The words do not need to be said. In this ever
darkening filmic world of rough destruction
and pain, the glow love casts cannot be extin
guished. Figgis is a romantic artist after all.
Love, he says simply, "is the light ofthe film."
And that light lends even harsh reality a lumi
nescent, if fragile, beauty.

The visual beauty of the new film "Leaving 1 as
Vegas" will keep your eyes fixed to the screen,
while vour mind will want to escape somewhere
else.
Art: beauty and pain
Beauty of art rubs uncomfortably against hor
ror ot circumstance in "Leaving Las Vegas," on
nationwide release Nov. 10. The new film by
British director Mike I iggis ("The Browning
Version," "Mr. lones," "Internal Affairs") won the
Silver Shell Award for best film at the San Se
bastien film festival in September.
1 iggis, in an interview held during his public
itv visit to San Francisco, says that he is
"shocked by the response th.it the film has re
ceived. I didn't expect anything like this, he
says. I le speaks softly, surprise tangible in his be
wildered look. Added to his long trizz\ hair, his
casual clothing and Ins gentle features, his mo
mentary confusion makes I iggis appear much
younger and less sophisticated than he really is.
Perhaps he reacts this way because he sees
himself as something other than a filmmaker.
"I 'm a musician first and foremost," he insists. I le
says that he is "moonlighting" as a director. But
then, aware that his success may make this com
ment seem ungracious, he adds hastily, with a
sell deprecatory laugh, "Don't give up the day
job, eh?"
Shot on super 16mm film, the movie is proof
that a limited budget (Figgis' single source, Lu
miere studios in France, put up $3.5 million),
tight timetables (the movie was shot in 2N days)
and an "amateur medium" can still produce a
highly aesthetic and polished production when
the one man band behind it all has talent. 1 iggis
not only directed, he wrote the screenplay and
the musical score and makes a cameo appear
ance.
Nicholas Cage and L.lisabeth Shue star in this
compelling and disturbing story which focuses
around the lives of an avowed alcoholic, Ben
(Cage), and a street-wise prostitute, Sera (Shue).
They are two lost souls who accidentally stumble

upon one another. Yet, out ot their destitution
and need comes something affirming and unde
structive — love.
"Why shouldn't it look beautiful?" counters
the director, eyebrows raised, when questioned
about the apparent disparity between content
and style.
And he is right.
lust as the characters in the film are able, at
times, to laugh at themselves and the situation
they are in, so we should not assume that the por
trayal of a stark and grim reality naturally points
to dreary and lackluster film techniques.
Figgis conveys a poignant message: From mo
ments of pain stem images of beauty.
They: swim against the stream
"I lave you ever had the feeling that the world's
left you behind?" wails the song that floods the au
ditorium as the movie begins. The words articu
late a dominant theme of "Leaving I as Vegas."
Figgis describes the two leading characters in
the film as "out of sync." I le does not see them or
their lives as failures, however. His candid ex
pression and slight frown testify to his own sin
cere belief in them.
They are lonely individuals "swimming
against the stream," he says. T he rest of society
has somehow left them behind.
Figgis has always had a strong sympathy for
the individual and an acute awareness of gang be
havior. Having grown up in Africa and then
moved at a young age to live in a rough area ot
Newcastle, in the north of Fngland, he obviously
appreciates what it feels like to be an outsider. I le
sits on the edge of the large sofa in his room as he
explains his suspicion of the group mentality
which singles out and rejects certain individuals.
He looks down for a moment to concentrate on
articulating precisely what lie means.
"I always feel sorry for victims," says Figgis.
He has always been fascinated with "anti-so
cial" personalities who are "picked on" by soci
ety. Prostitutes, alcoholics and drug addicts all
come under his definition. In a puzzled voice, he
notes that even in "Internal Affairs," he finds
Richard (lere's "bad guy " more sympathetic than
Andy Garcia.
"I'm not impressed with popular heroes who
possess the endorsement of their peers," Figgis
says with conviction.
Rather, he perceives courage in"the bravery of
the individual when he is picked on." It is the
bravery not to give in, either to the system of to
self-delusion.
He: tells truth over delusion
The film's two lead characters, Ben and Sera,

possess terrible bravery and a deep sense of vul
nerability in the stark and often painful honesty
with which they view their own lives.
Ben has drunk away his family, friends and
job. With nothing else to lose, he heads to Las
Vegas for one final binge. He leaves LA. because
the stores close too early, 1 fe kept running out of
booze because he forgot to look at his watch, he
explains to Sera in one of many exchanges that

nervously border be-

tween the comic
an d th e ab -

surd.
Ben now
has one sim
ple aim: "I
came hereto
drink

myself to death," he says. He is perfectly serious.
I le sticks to his goal with a passion and dedica
tion that seem to belie the utter hopelessness ol
his life. Or perhaps it is just that he has decided
that he wants to be successful at something —
and he is good at drinking.
Cage, who won best actor award at San Se
bastien for his role, never allows the character he
plays to become monotonous, self-pitying or to
tally bitter. This would be disastrous for both the
film and the amount of sympathy which Ben
elicits.
Cage avoids this pitfall by his unique method
of line delivery. "He delivers lines with a ghost of
the comedic," explains Figgis, who obviously ad
mires the actor. It is not that what he is saying is

tunny, it is rather the reverse. The more appar
ently comic comments are in fact often the sad
dest or blackest in the film.
Figgis takes as an example the scene in which
Sera gives Ben various moving-in presents.
Among them is a shiny silver hip-flask. Ben's re
sponse is simply, "Looks like I'm with the right
girl." One reaction is to laugh — the other is to
cringe.

It is a moment when two

"twisted souls" momentar
ily connect, when Sera
gives Ben something

much more valuable
than a

keepsake. She offers him, at this instant at least,
.in unconditional understanding.
liggis finds it upsetting when the audience
laughs. "That moment made me cry," he ex
plains. The director's openness is disarming.
1 lis emotional vulnerability and artistic integri
ty shine through his words. He is realistic
enough to admit that this is only a film and yet
in the same breath he explains his characters al
most as if he feels it is his duty to protect them.
It is this capacity to generate dual responses
that enables Figgis to construct an emotional
tight-rope that runs the length of the film. Just
as the characters oscillate between insecurity
and strength — one often swinging up as the
other swings down — the audience is forever

caught between grin and grimace.
She: hopes over truth
Sera approaches her "profession" with the
same apparent clear-sightedness as Ben does his
drinking. "I bring out the best in the men who
fuck me," she says to an unknown listener early
in the film. (It later turns out to be her therapist,
to whom she is recounting the events we sec de
picted.) "1 can turn on a dime," she says. "This
is their fantasy and I become it. It's a perfor
mance."
Sera seems to harbor no illusions. Prostitu
tion is her job and she is good at it. Yet for all
that, the character possesses an elusive quality
that begs for some form ot protection, almost as
it Sera needs to be shielded from her own life.
Figgis explains that this dichotomy attracted
him to the character when he first read John
O'Brien's novel, from which the film is adapted.
It began with a superficial distinction: "There
was a difference between what she was saying
and what she looked like,'' Figgis says.
Llisabeth Shue superbly brings out (his con
tradiction. At moments, says I iggis, she ap
pears Bergmanesque and at others like the all
American girl next door: straight teeth, athlet
ic build, perfect smile.
Shue adds another dimension ot her own. At
moments, she manages to give Sera a credible,
almost childlike, vulnerability. I iggis found the
interpretation fascinating and pushed it in the
film. Thus, when Sera tells Ben on their first
encounter, "I think the tough times are finally
behind me ... my life is good," we remain un
convinced.
The result is a character that is complex and
believable. Sera may try desperately to give the
impression that "she has her shit sorted out,"
says I iggis, adopting the rhetoric of the coun
try he is visiting, but her tough talk and ges
tures are constantly belied by her vulnerable
glances.
Figgis uses close-ups of Shue's eyes almost as
an alternative narrative device. Shue's eyes ex
press what her character will never articulate in
words: her act is self-delusion, she isn't in con
trol any more than Ben and it hurts. "She is in
denial of something," says F iggis.
Love: casts a shadow
Vet, despite, or perhaps because of, the pain
and torment that the two characters endure, the
remarkable happens — they manage to fall in
love, or at least create something that comes
very close. For two people already so vulnera
ble, this is real risk-taking.
"Love is a hit of a liability," says Figgis. "It

leaves you open to danger.
The consequence for Sera is horrific. After
she tells Ben to get out ot her apartment, having
found him with another woman, she is gang
raped hv three young college-age kids. "Her
meter should have been bleeping," says Figgis
about the situation with the men, but it didn't
because love had left her "emotionally con
fused."
Figgis looks disturbed and shifts uncomfort
ably in his seat as he discusses the rape scene.
Presented in play-back as Sera sits bleeding in
the shower, the event is symbolic of Sera's vul
nerability and her role in the film as social vic
tim. Again in the film, we teeter on the brink of
two realities: one is easy to dismiss as cliche —
