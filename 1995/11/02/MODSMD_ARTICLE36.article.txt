## DEF LEPPARD Vault SMASHING PUMPKINS Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness 
### 
In the post-Nirvana alternative rock
world, bad 80s metal acts are targets ol e«is\
ridicule. About live years ago, Kurt Cobain
uncovered the self absorbed art form in hard
rock and dragged it to the mainstream, and
ever since, there's just no room lor SOs tight
pants -and-muscle-T bands, those bands
who made straight ahead rock music lor a
pop scene where honest expression wasn't
even an issue.
but with the release of the greatest hits
package "Vault," Def I.eppard make a state
ment for the genre they once championed. A
work of shameless self-glorification, "Vault'
which, according to the sadly deluded
press kit, chronicles the "first chapter ol Def
I eppard's career" — delivers song after song
of vacant hard rock, succeeding most
through the satisfying feel of an honest, art
less rock band that knows its limits. There's
no Vedder-esque frowning, no live ish sell -
ingof the melodrama, just a band with a one
armed drummer proudly making songs
about partying and scoring, but that they felt
the need to celebrate their emptiness with a
work as ridiculous as "Vault" says that they
mean what they say, even when they don't say
that much. Something like the I.eppard's

"Have You Ever Needed
Someone So bad" is just as
honest as "Lightning
Crashes;" it's just that I.ep
pard leader Joe F.lliott
doesn't hide behind a tor
ttired grimace when he
sings it.
As you'd expect, "Vault"
reliably delivers all the old
favorites, mixing testos
terone soaked rockers
("Pour Some Sugar On
Me, Rocket, etc.) and
awful power-ballads (the
similarly titled "Miss You
in a Heartbeat" and
Bringin' on the Heart
break"), but the whole
album becomes ultimately
entertaining when you re
ali/e that it's basically the
same stull you hear today,
lust tree of artistic preten
sion and self-pity. It's what
today's modern rockers
grew up on, whether they
admit it or not.

It arena rock is arena rock, then maybe the
Smashing Pumpkins' new two-disc, epic
only in-length "Mellon (iollieand the Infinite
Sadness is nothing more than a monument
to itself like "Vault" is for DefLeppard. Except
in the age when the Leppard prowled, the
mainstream was simple lust and cheese; bloat
ed with humorless self-importance, the
Smashing Pumpkins typify "Universal Angst,"
the current amphitheater-filling norm.
( locking in at two hours and 2K tracks,
"Mellon Collie" is a work of supreme pom
posity, not only in its grand, sweeping sound
but also in Hilly (Morgan's assumption that
anybody has the patience to listen to 120
minutes ot self-centered polemics and self

sorry whining. On the bustling first single
"Bullet with Butterfly Wings," (Morgan growls
ego-mindedly, "Tell me I'm the only
one / tell tne there's no other one / Jesus was
an only son." Though the three lines don't
form the syllogism Corgan = Jesus, the point
that he likes himself a lot comes through
screechingly clear. "Fuck You (An Ode to No
One)" is an ode to no one but Corgan him
self, where he tries to "disconnect" from lov
ing the "no good girl' who took his inno
cence only to decide miserably that "no way,
I don't need it." That doesn't even get to the
pensive, murky ballads of the second disc,
like "Thirty-Three," on which Corgan oh-so
generously sings, "Deep in thought I forgive
everyone."
Though (".organ's self-obsessed rants can't
help but drag down the whole of "Mellon
Collie," the Pumpkins create music thor
oughly more interesting and listenable than
any of its best-selling alt-rock ilk. If nothing
else, they're probably the only of their kind to
be able to put together a project this immense
with some sense of cohesion. Even without
the superior anthems of "Siamese Dream,"
the first half of the new set sneers with ap
pealing energy, outpacing pre-packaged,
pre-chewed stuff by l ive (again), Bush, Goo
Goo Dolls, whatever; the second batch is less
focused, alternately interesting and boring in
its experimentation. The sappy tribute to the
early-Leppard-cra, "1979," is perhaps the
most pleasant song the band has recorded, a
dusty, sentimental panorama where Corgan
observes without interjecting. Which points
out by example a cliche about the self that
Billy overlooks and that Def Leppard unwit
tingly fell into: you can be your own worst
enemy.
