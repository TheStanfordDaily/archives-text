# DAVID BOWIE
## Outside 
### 
David Bowie, the visionary, has returned.
On his newly released concept album,
"Outside," Bowie creates a futuristic night
mare which evokes inevitable comparisons

to his negative Utopia epics of the '70s. This
return to his past style is a welcome change.
During the '80s, Bowie proved that when
he tempered his artistic ambitions and fo
cused on the purely musical, the results were
insufferably boring. However much his pre
tensions burden his new album, the resultant
artistic spark produces some remarkable
music.
Subtitled "The Nathan Adler Diaries,"
the work is based upon a Bowie short story
included with the album. Set upon the
ominous date of Dec. 31, 1999, the story
traces detective Nathan Adler's "art
crime" investigation of the "art-ritual"
murder of a 14-year-old girl named Baby
Grace Blue.
In Adler's world, art has become so in
creasingly violent that murder itself can be
viewed as an art. Bowie's frightful vision
finds its base from the current emergence of
masochistic performance art in the '90s. See
ing murder as the final stage in this progres
sion, Bowie raises some disturbing questions
concerning the true nature of "art" — how
much should society allow as "art" which it
would not allow otherwise? The listener can
not help finding traces of Bowie's vision in


1995, such as within the well-worn debate
over pornographic art.
Indeed, Bowie challenges the usefulness of
the very title of "art" itself. In a satirical jab,
Bowie mocks the artistic world by having
Adler's detective agency funded by an "Arts
Protectorate" because certainly the investiga
tion of art crimes is "inseparable from other
forms of expression."
While the album's artistic ambitions both
fascinate and frustrate the listener, the music
itself never fails to compensate. Collaborat
ing with avant-garde producer Brian Eno, the
album's heavy dose ot techno-rock makes
Pink Floyd sound horribly dated.
Using technology to enhance the
music's depth and movement, each song
contains something unforgettable. "The
Heart's Filthy Lesson," "Hallo Spaceboy"
and "We Prick You" are all proof that rock
and roll can be a product of technology.
Moreover, on tracks like "Stranger When
We Meet," Bowie adds some grace and ele
gance that most technology-based music
lacks.
"Outside" is actually only the first chapter
in the "Nathan Adler Diaries." If Bowie con
tinues this artistic rebirth, the series could
rival the best work of his career.
