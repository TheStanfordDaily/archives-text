## DOUG E. FRESH Play 
### 
Doug I. Fresh, from Doug I Fresh and
the (let Fresh Crew, is back on the hip-hop
scene with his new album, "Play." The old
school never died, and Doug's been working
hard to keep his name fresh on the tongues of
rappers and listeners alike. He raps, co-pro
duces and executive produces this full-length
album that gets the feet stompin' and the
heads noddin' to smooth beats.
This is a party album, with chanting, call
and-response shouts and happ\ -days, don't
we-lovc to-live raps. When your friends start
drifting off into random conversations about
Foucaultdian discourse over a table full of
empties, throw this CD on to get the rumps
shakin' in the old school way.
Doug preserves the joy and excitement of
the days of early Run D.M.C in the first half
of the album with songs that will turn the
party out. But by the ninth track, his themes
of mo' money and mo' hoes get as stale as
hearing James Brown's "1 feel good" on TV
ads selling products for the man.
There is a ragga edge to some of the

songs, chorus shouts and smatterings of
new school production that get the blood
racing. Doug comes out of Harlem and he
has the New York sound of mellow beats
and lyrics that don't have to talk about fir
ing heaters in order to be aggressive. 110
says lie's a mac daddy, and his beats are
smooth, but his reliance on old school
techniqiie*, like synthesizers doesn't neces
sarilv titillate the ears of listeners from back
in the day.
"Everybody iust dance' sums up the
theme of "Play in the fifth track, 'I he Orig
inal Old School," which rips off too much of
the new school to be truly original. There is a
constant conflict in the album: Doug doesn't
seem to know if he should stick to the old
school wild style or try to keep up with the
likes of Public Enemy and A Tribe Called
Quest.
Hut his new album is still a fun-filled
house of freak in'. When was the last time you
heard beat-box rhythms, real scratching and
lyrics like, "haaaaay big bottoms /
youknowyougottabefromllahlem / haaaay
good lookin / vouknowyougottabefrom
Brooklyn?" It is full of freak shout-outs that
get tiring after awhile, but when they first
rock, you can't help yourself from movin to
Dough. fresh's freak show of "Freak's
Anonymous."
It's late, the party's over and you want to
kick it with your significant honey. Turn
the CD player on, wrap up and go with the
flow.
