# STEREOLAB
## Refried Ectoplasm 
### 
In terms of both the quantity and quality
of its product, Stereolab is among the most
prolific bands on the college music scene.
"Retried Kctoolasm," the latest from the

groop tli.it plays space-age bachelor pad
music, verifies that lofty status. The tull
length collects 13 tracks from hard-to-find
singles, obscure compilation contributions
and unreleased goodies by the 21st-century
Marxist party band.
I yen more, the new album highlights
the impeccable pop song instincts of a
band that stands out more for the trano
vibe it sets than for its individual songs. In
deed, "Retried I ctoplasm" charms inline
diatelx and is more accessible than an\
Stereolab 1 I' offering to date. I istening to
the album is like sampling the hit parade
from the near future. Stellar cuts like re
lentlessly shimmering "French Disko" and
the driving and purposeful "Sadistic" arc
meaningful in addition to sounding great,
where subliminal politics and droning gui
tars achieve .1 perfect balance of rhetoric
and music. "Tone Burst (Country)," a
redux of the opener to Stereolab's excellent
1993 album " Transient Random-Noise
bursts with Announcements," is cowpunk
light years ahead of its time, the moogs and
organs and reverb swaying and swaggering
like slide guitars.
It there's a shortcoming to "Retried Ecto
plasm," it's that the hodge-podge of super
stuff lacks the all-engrossing mood the al
bums weave delicately, which Stereolab does
most remarkably on 1994's mind-enlarging
opus "Mars Audiac Quintet." Whereas
"Mars Audiac Quintet" captivates with sub
tleties within and between tracks, the col lee
tion relies on the impact of the songs them
selves as wholes. Yet with tunes as delightful
and brilliant and intricate as the warm,
sprightly "Lo Boob Oscillator" (from the
much-coveted 7" the groop did for the Sub
Pop single of the month series) and the
steady, crisp "Eloge d i ms," there's more
than enough on which to prop an entire
album. If anything, "Retried Ectoplasm'
provides new perspectives into a band that
offers so many.
