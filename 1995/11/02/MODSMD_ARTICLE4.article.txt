# RAs feel squeeze of looming grape vote
## Dorm education efforts lagging behind 
### Carolyn Sleeth Sara Southern Contributing writers 
Although the suggested deadline to hold
dorm discussions on the merits of a grape
boycott expired last Friday, many resi
dences have not even brought up the issue
for examinat ion.
Resident assistants throughout campus
said education efforts have been hampered
by a lack of resources, unclear guidelines on
how to present educational material and a
general lack of student interest in the issue.
A guide given to resident assistants dur
ing their summer training recommended

The
Grape Vote

Educating the campus

that RAs provide an "introduction" to the
grapes issue, including "material, history
land a| decision-making plan" by the end of
the fourth week of the quarter. Residences
are required to vote before the end of the
quarter on whether or not they will serve
grapes.
If a residence does not reach a decision,
its dining service will serve "nutritionally
sound, seasonal and cost efficient fruit
(which may include grapes)," according to
the discussion guide.
Until now, most dorms have featured a
presentation by Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga about the history of the grapes issue,
but have not conducted a formal discussion
as described in the grapes policy guide.
"Stall series," with points describing each
side of the issue, also have heen posted in
some dorm bathrooms.
Manzanita, the first large dormitory to
have its referendum, voted last weekend
against a boycott. Sigma Alpha Epsilon and

557 Mayfield also have voted
already, but residence officials
declined to disclose the results.
Residents at Lagunita are voting
this week.
Most dorms, however, have
decided to postpone their votes
until after an educational forum to
be held Nov. 13, sponsored by Syn
ergy, Columbae, Terra and El Cen
tro Chicano.
Some RAs said they delayed dis
cussions and voting because they
didn't want to rush their residents
into a decision. "We wanted to hold
oft* on the vote until we had built
some community," Roble RA Craig
Skotdal smd.
Many RAs said interest in the
grape issue is minimal, and are
worried that students will become
apathetic as the quarter progress
es. Granada RA Smeeta Ramarath
nam said concern about increasing
indifference has motivated Laguni

ta to push up its vote to this week.
"It's just another issue," Serra
RA Sam Stapleton said. "A lot of
people are getting sick of it. I am
not sure everyone really wants to
find out about it."
More resources needed
Although RAs said they felt they
learned a lot about the issue during
RA training and that they could
lead a discussion, they did not feel
that the resources promised by
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice after the release of the Grape
Policy Committee's report last
spring have been sufficient.
"Those resources were not pro
vided," said Casa Zapata RA Tony
Gomez. "Casper came out with his
stance last year, but then it was
kind of thrown on RAs to educate
and bring the vote. There should
have been some sort of funding.
They just left it there for someone
else to take care of."
The statement issued by Casper
and Rice names the dean of stu
dents and Residential Education as

responsible for educating students.
lies Ed Director Jane Camarillo
defended her office's efTorts to
assist the RAs. The grape commit
tee's report from last spring has
been the basis of the information
distributed, she said. "In the
sources we provided, the intent was
to identify the critical reasons why
to boycott, specifically addressing
the health and labor issues,"
Camarillo said.
Camarillo said that RAs
received copies of the report to dis
tribute to residents. She added that
the original sources which the
grape committee used are available
in several places, including the
housing office, and a site on the
World Wide Web has been created
so students don't to go to the
library.
Voting strategies vary
Although in the discussion
guide given to RAs a sample ballot
states that "all ballot wording
should be the same across all vot
ing units," voting procedures have
varied among dorms that have held

their elections.
For instance, the sample ballot
does not include an option for
abstentions. But the Manzanita
ballot did include abstention as a
choice. The ballots do not
include abstention, while SAE and
557 Mayfield declined to comment
on their ballot wording.
"If the issue is important
enough to vote on, then I wanted
people to vote one way or another,"
said Marengo.
Trancos RA Sonya Elder agreed,
saying, "An abstention is like not
turning in a ballot at all."
Some RAs, however, felt an
option for abstention would be use
ful. "I think it's a g(xxl idea," said
Branner RA Katie Beman. "If some
residents are ambivalent, they
should have that option open to
them."
Camarillo said that the? sample
ballot was meant to be only a
guideline, and that residences
should have local control over how
the decision is made. "If some
houses want to decide by consen
sus, they should be able to,"

Camarillo said.
"We just provided the ballot so
that RAs weren't starting from
scratch. In the same way, we don't
want to require a quorum. That is
for each residence to decide."
Most RAs agreed the majority of
their residents would not vote at
all, and acknowledged that funda
mentally, those who really care
about the issue will vote.
"Those who choose not to vote
can't really complain," said Zapata
RA Juan Gabriel Ibarra. "It's
always best to have as many people
voting as possible, and the fact that
many residents won't vote bothers
me because the results won't clear
ly represent the student body on
thus issue."
Apathy an issue
Because half of the undergradu
ate population was not at Stanford
during the 1994 hunger strike —
which brought the grape issue into
the spotlight — general knowledge
about the issue on campus is fairly
low.
Nancy Lin, an RAin Branner,

said that freshmen are particularly
detached from the issue. "Many of
them haven't been affected by the
issue or haven't had to live with
others who are emotionally tied to
it," she said.
"Right now we are just trying to
inform them about the issue," said
Atesa Farshian, an RAin Gavilan,
an all-frosh dorm.
Toni Marengo said that
although she felt prepared to lead a
discussion on the issue, she "didn't
feel that students were as informed
as they should be."
Yet despite many students' apa
thy and lack of exposure to the
issue, RAs in some dorms have
worked toward informing their res
idents.
Adelfa RA Pete Deßlank said
Lagunita RAs also have held a "Lag
Raps" session — an informal small
group discussion — about the
issue.
"We've been putting it into the
context of Stanford. We are having
a hard time presenting a balanced
view, and we don't want to preju
dice people," said Ramarathnam.

The statement issued by Casper
and Rice names the dean of stu
dents and Residential Education as

responsible for educating students.
lies Ed Director Jane Camarillo
defended her office's efTorts to
assist the RAs. The grape commit
tee's report from last spring has
been the basis of the information
distributed, she said. "In the
sources we provided, the intent was
to identify the critical reasons why
to boycott, specifically addressing
the health and labor issues,"
Camarillo said.
Camarillo said that RAs
received copies of the report to dis
tribute to residents. She added that
the original sources which the
grape committee used are available
in several places, including the
housing office, and a site on the
World Wide Web has been created
so students don't to go to the
library.
Voting strategies vary
Although in the discussion
guide given to RAs a sample ballot
states that "all ballot wording
should be the same across all vot
ing units," voting procedures have
varied among dorms that have held

their elections.
For instance, the sample ballot
does not include an option for
abstentions. But the Manzanita
ballot did include abstention as a
choice. The ballots do not
include abstention, while SAE and
557 Mayfield declined to comment
on their ballot wording.
"If the issue is important
enough to vote on, then I wanted
people to vote one way or another,"
said Marengo.
Trancos RA Sonya Elder agreed,
saying, "An abstention is like not
turning in a ballot at all."
Some RAs, however, felt an
option for abstention would be use
ful. "I think it's a g(xxl idea," said
Branner RA Katie Beman. "If some
residents are ambivalent, they
should have that option open to
them."
Camarillo said that the? sample
ballot was meant to be only a
guideline, and that residences
should have local control over how
the decision is made. "If some
houses want to decide by consen
sus, they should be able to,"

Camarillo said.
"We just provided the ballot so
that RAs weren't starting from
scratch. In the same way, we don't
want to require a quorum. That is
for each residence to decide."
Most RAs agreed the majority of
their residents would not vote at
all, and acknowledged that funda
mentally, those who really care
about the issue will vote.
"Those who choose not to vote
can't really complain," said Zapata
RA Juan Gabriel Ibarra. "It's
always best to have as many people
voting as possible, and the fact that
many residents won't vote bothers
me because the results won't clear
ly represent the student body on
thus issue."
Apathy an issue
Because half of the undergradu
ate population was not at Stanford
during the 1994 hunger strike —
which brought the grape issue into
the spotlight — general knowledge
about the issue on campus is fairly
low.
Nancy Lin, an RAin Branner,

said that freshmen are particularly
detached from the issue. "Many of
them haven't been affected by the
issue or haven't had to live with
others who are emotionally tied to
it," she said.
"Right now we are just trying to
inform them about the issue," said
Atesa Farshian, an RAin Gavilan,
an all-frosh dorm.
Toni Marengo said that
although she felt prepared to lead a
discussion on the issue, she "didn't
feel that students were as informed
as they should be."
Yet despite many students' apa
thy and lack of exposure to the
issue, RAs in some dorms have
worked toward informing their res
idents.
Adelfa RA Pete Deßlank said
Lagunita RAs also have held a "Lag
Raps" session — an informal small
group discussion — about the
issue.
"We've been putting it into the
context of Stanford. We are having
a hard time presenting a balanced
view, and we don't want to preju
dice people," said Ramarathnam.
Although the suggested deadline to hold
dorm discussions on the merits of a grape
boycott expired last Friday, many resi
dences have not even brought up the issue
for examinat ion.
Resident assistants throughout campus
said education efforts have been hampered
by a lack of resources, unclear guidelines on
how to present educational material and a
general lack of student interest in the issue.
A guide given to resident assistants dur
ing their summer training recommended

The
Grape Vote

Educating the campus

that RAs provide an "introduction" to the
grapes issue, including "material, history
land a| decision-making plan" by the end of
the fourth week of the quarter. Residences
are required to vote before the end of the
quarter on whether or not they will serve
grapes.
If a residence does not reach a decision,
its dining service will serve "nutritionally
sound, seasonal and cost efficient fruit
(which may include grapes)," according to
the discussion guide.
Until now, most dorms have featured a
presentation by Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga about the history of the grapes issue,
but have not conducted a formal discussion
as described in the grapes policy guide.
"Stall series," with points describing each
side of the issue, also have heen posted in
some dorm bathrooms.
Manzanita, the first large dormitory to
have its referendum, voted last weekend
against a boycott. Sigma Alpha Epsilon and

557 Mayfield also have voted
already, but residence officials
declined to disclose the results.
Residents at Lagunita are voting
this week.
Most dorms, however, have
decided to postpone their votes
until after an educational forum to
be held Nov. 13, sponsored by Syn
ergy, Columbae, Terra and El Cen
tro Chicano.
Some RAs said they delayed dis
cussions and voting because they
didn't want to rush their residents
into a decision. "We wanted to hold
oft* on the vote until we had built
some community," Roble RA Craig
Skotdal smd.
Many RAs said interest in the
grape issue is minimal, and are
worried that students will become
apathetic as the quarter progress
es. Granada RA Smeeta Ramarath
nam said concern about increasing
indifference has motivated Laguni

ta to push up its vote to this week.
"It's just another issue," Serra
RA Sam Stapleton said. "A lot of
people are getting sick of it. I am
not sure everyone really wants to
find out about it."
More resources needed
Although RAs said they felt they
learned a lot about the issue during
RA training and that they could
lead a discussion, they did not feel
that the resources promised by
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice after the release of the Grape
Policy Committee's report last
spring have been sufficient.
"Those resources were not pro
vided," said Casa Zapata RA Tony
Gomez. "Casper came out with his
stance last year, but then it was
kind of thrown on RAs to educate
and bring the vote. There should
have been some sort of funding.
They just left it there for someone
else to take care of."
