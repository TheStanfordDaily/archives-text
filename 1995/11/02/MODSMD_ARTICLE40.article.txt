## Doom Generation 
### 
Hat, tuck, kill.
Those were the words printed in big boldface on the buttons
given away during "The Doom Generation screenings at bulla
palooza this year. And fittingly so, because the film doesn't amount
to much more. I )irected by (iregg Araki, u hose work has included
the gay films "The I iving Knd" and "Totally lucked Up, "The
Doom (ieneration has an interesting sit ol characters who
nonetheless can t compensate for tired dialogue, ridiculous vio
lence and boring sex.
Set in present day los Angeles, "Doom tells the story of two
young lovers from the Valley Ann blue (Rose McGowan) and
Jordan White (lames 1 )uval) — and their unlikely encounter with
the mysterious drifter Xavier Red (lohnathan Sehaech). After
Xavier innocently blows the head off a Quickie Marl clerk, the
three are forced to embark on a hallucinogenic road trip where
every time they stop tor nachos and fries, someone ends up dying.
Subplotted is the se\ triangle between the young, beautiful trio
that — though the film is subtitled "a heterosexual movie" — in
cludes more than one instance of tense homoerotic undertone.
One redeeming aspect of "Doom is its main cameos by pop
culture icons — I'erry I arrell (Porno for Pyros), I leidi I leiss, Mar
garet Gho, Dustin Nguyen ("21 lump Street "), Julie Tewes ("The
Love Boat") and Parker Posey ("Party Girl"). Araki describes it as
"falling asleep watching TV and having this nightmare filled with
these weird, recognizable faces.' In this way, the film works it
satirizes pop culture to the point of absurdity, which is the only way
to see it.
1 lowever, there is not much else in this film to discuss. The per
formances are adequate, but the stale script utters the actors little in
the ways of depth. Visually, the film is difficult to watch, with harsh
whites blinding the viewer in some scenes and darkness blurring
perception in others. I)esigned to be visually captivating, "Doom"
looks like a modern version of bad technicolor. Of course, it was
shot tor less than a million dollars, but so was Robert Rodriguez's
"I I Mariachi."
bottom line, this film could have been a lot better. Though tout
ed as the "Alienated Teen Pic to end all Alienated Teen Pics," "The
Doom Generation" ends up being just in-your-face violence and
sex.
