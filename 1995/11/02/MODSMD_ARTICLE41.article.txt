# Feast of July

I he visually captivating "I-cast ol |ul\ doesn't awaken
your senses so much as it stealthily and steadily inundates
them.
Directed hy Christopher Menaul ("Prime Suspect "),
this is a film lor those with both the patience and the
palette to see sumptuous scenery, rich characterizations
and classic stor\ telling served on a constant!) reflecting
plate. It's .ill washed down with first rate acting and a sprig
ot bitterness (this is Merchant Ivory, alter all).
Your appeti/er is the first hour of the film — focusing
on the internal and external struggles ot Bella l ord (Fin
heth Davidt/, "Schindler's I ist") in late nineteenth-centu
ry I ngland. It begins with her fall from grace as the
spurned lover of an unfaithful scoundrel, Arch Wilson
(Ben Wise).
Bella finds a place of redemption 111 the Wainwright
house, where she is caught in a Bermuda 'triangleot desire
by three brothers, further complicated by the obsessive
and possessive love given to her by the youngest, Con (Ben
l Jiaplin).
Midway through the film, which is slow to reconcile the
disparate images of grime and beauty flashing intermit
tently like a warning beacon, you're ready for the main
course.
It delivers when Bella finally makes her choice. Bella
and Con are given only a taste of happiness before it all
goes wrong. Con's chronic temper unleashes its lethal
blows upon Arch and the lovers are on the run as fugitives
from the law.
Suddenly, dessert doesn't seem like such a good idea
amidst all of this tragedy.
Despite the tragedy, the deliciousness of this film lies in
its illumination of transformation, how serendipity can be
both the ultimate blessing or damnation.
Women maintain a core of power while the men around
them fluctuate from one state of abandonment to another.
As Bella, I )avidtz brings a wealth of vulnerability and for
titude to a role that only requires her to be beautiful as jeal
ousy and violence unfurl around her. Gemma Jones stands
out as the stern matriarch of the Wainwright family, om

niscient in her understanding of the power shift in her
once-placid home. Alternatively threatened by Bella and
maternal toward her, she is always one-step ahead of the
not-so-subtle battle that rages on among her sons for
Bellas affections.
In the end, you will come out of "Feast of July" wishing
there had been more on the plate, but happy to have con
sumed in full what was there.
