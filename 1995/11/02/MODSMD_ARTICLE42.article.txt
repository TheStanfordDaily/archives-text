# Copycat

### 
Expcct absolutely nothing
from "Copycat" and maybe you'll
get your money's worth. Compa
rable to a TV movie-of-the-week,
this supposed suspense flick just
does not deliver any thrills.
Surprisingly enough, rep
utable actresses Sigourney Weaver
and Oscar-winner Holly Hunter
star in this mediocre movie.
Weaver plays serial-killer expert
Dr. Helen Hudson, who has con
fined herself to her apartment
after an attempt on her life by
killer Darryl Lee Cullum (Harry
Connick, Jr.). Weaver reluctantly
but inevitably teams up with De
tective I.P. Monahan (Hunter)
and her stiully partner to investi
gate a string of brutal murders
committed by .1 killer who likes to
copy the work of other serial
killers.
Weaver looks like she's
scared of aliens for pretty much
the entire movie. Hunter does a
nice generic job of the tough fe
male cop who can shoot better
than any man, including her part-

ner. The police pair carry out the obligatory
bantering and flirting with little jokes that
only one man in the audience seemed to get
and laugh at.
A barely recognizable and naturally
southern-accented Harry Connick, (r. stole
the three scenes he was in as the perverted
redneck Parryl Lee, mostly through extreme
camera close-ups that let you see every pore
on his face and every taste hud on his tongue.
However, it was nice to see Connick expand
his range from his previous roles in "Mem
phis Belle" and "Little Man Tate", in which his
small parts seemed like vehicles for him to
put his music on the big screen.
As for plot, Director lon Amiel must have
thought that suspense could be created
through music alone. As a result, whenever a
tense moment is supposed to arise, discor
dant clinking sounds on a piano and screech
ing violins abound. With no distinctive
themes, the music score sounds like a reject
from the "Psycho" soundtrack.
Unfortunately, you find yourself not real
ly caring if Weaver and Hunter can track
down the copycat killer because they are al
ways one step behind and can never outwit
him. They find success only by comparing
pictures of murder scenes and identifying
which murderer was copied.
As I checked my watch halfway through
the movie, I realized that this flick is just an
other thriller copycat.
