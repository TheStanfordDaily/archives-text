## Vampire in Brooklyn 
### 
Vampire in Brooklyn is an average movie, especially if you
overlook the fact that it could have been brilliant.
Director Wes Craven ("Nightmare on Elm Street")

vomits this sorry attempt to mix horror and comedy. All you "Him Street" fans
may recall how audiences swooned over Hreddy krueger cracking jokes before
mutilating his victims. But Hddie Murphy is no Hreddy Krueger.
1 he premise is simple: Maximillian (Murphy) is the last surviving vampire,
with the exception ol Rita < Angela Bassett), who is unaware that she's half vamp.
Max has come to Brooklyn to find Rita and enlighten her of her heritage so that
he won't be alone anymore. He's aided by his ghoul, Kadeem Ilardison ("A Dif
ferent World ). In the meantime, Rita is realizing how in love she is with her
partner, Justice (Allen Payne).
In this film, Eddie Murphy proves that lie's not an actor. 1 lis entire character
is his costume mixed with his nondescript-Coming-to-America-Part-Il-
African accent.
Angella Bassett ("What's Love (iot to Do With It") is a super-fierce-stud-god
dess from somewhere over the rainbow. Vet, she makes painfully bad acting
choices throughout this film. The screenwriter, the director and maybe even the
actress are so intent on portraying Rita as a hard-as-nails woman in dual strug
gles between good and evil that it just reads like she has terminal I'MS.
The special effects and cinematography were excellent. With Craven's imagi
nation, Murphy's money and Bassett's talent, this could have been a super,
multi-orgasmic experience. Bassett is fierce with fangs and her performance as
a vampire is indicative of the film's potential. When it's time for Bassett to expe
rience any semi-genuine experiences, she's quite good. But everytime she finds
herself in any damsel-in-distress-fleeing-from -the-monster in high-heels mo
ments, she falls flat on her face.
"Vampire in Brooklyn" never knows what type of movie it is. It isn't funny
enough to be a real comedy. It isn't scary, intriguing or suspenseful enough to be
a real horror film. Thus, its biggest short-coming is that it never commits to at
tempting to be either type of film. There is no through-line: It's cute and funny
one moment and the next scene Murphy is ripping someone's heart out. This
lack of a consistent world to get lost in makes the film impossible to get into.
Wait for this one to come to cable.
