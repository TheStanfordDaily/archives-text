# Never Talk to Strangers
## 
### 
In the realm of good advice to people everywhere: never talk to
strangers, look both ways before you cross the street and if you have any
interest in saving $7, wait for the video.
In this disjointed thriller, Rebecca DeMornay stars as Dr. Sarah Taylor,
a criminal psychologist with a tormented past and a murky present. She
becomes involved with a smooth talking, mysterious stranger played by a
leather-clad Antonio Banderas (having been surgically removed from
Melanie Griffith's face) whom she begins to suspect is stalking her with
death threats and dead pets. Sarah's tortured childhood, revealed in exag
gerated flashbacks, figures into the plot in the form of her lurking, sketchy
father. The story line follows her attempts to discover who is trying to kill
her while trying not to fall in love with this man she fears.
While the plot twists and turns are often absorbing, the overwhelming
impression this movie gives is simply silliness. Director Peter I iall seems
fiendishly bent on using every suspense-thriller cliche in the book: creepy
music before the "scary parts," the friendly neighbor (in this case, I )ennis
Miller for comic relief) who becomes an unfortunate victim, obscenities
scrawled in blood and, of course, the doomed house pet. "Never lalk to
Strangers" even has Harry Dean Stanton .is a Hannibal l.ecter like captive
psycho whom Sarah is evaluating — a ranting character whose purpose is
unclear with the exception of bothering Sarah about her sex life.
I suppose that a movie starring DeMornay and lust object tin jour Banderas
wouldn't be complete without five million bedroom tours, but forcing the av
erage person to sit through lines like "that's how I like my men ... wet and
naked" — even if it is Antonio Banderas — is just a bit over the top. I here s a
fine line between eroticism and farce, one which this film chooses to ignore.
Despite all this, the movie might have been saved, if not made brilliant,
In fairly competent acting — especially DeMornay, who has a lot of in
tense emotions to play — and fast paced action. I'ntortunatelv, when all
the mysteries are solved and all the secrets are revealed, the climax is the
silliest part of all and certainly not worth the long road of cliches it took to
get there — especially the poor dead cat. I personally will never under
stand why cinema stalking always entails the slaughtering of an innocent
domesticated animal. In the case of "Never lalk to Strangers, it might be
better just to never say never again.
