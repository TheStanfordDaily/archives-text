# Three Wishes
## 
### 
"Everything contains its opposite.
This simple statement echoes throughout Director
Martha C loolidge's movie, "Three Wishes." The movie,
however, is anything hut simple and exactly the oppo
site of what it seems: a magical, PG-rated children's
movie about monsters and genies. Yes, it has more
magic than Merlin, hut this movie can he enjoyed by all
ages.
Elizabeth Anderson's screenplay is carefully con
structed around a flashback of a Memorial Day in the
late 19405. Jeanne (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)
takes her two young sons Tom (Joseph Ma/zello) and
Gunny (Seth Mumy) to visit the gravesides of ser
vicemen who died in the Korean War, in which her
husband was declared missing in action. On the way
to a picnic afterwards, Jeanne's car hits a hitchhiker,
Jack McGloud (Patrick Swayze) and his dog that's re
ally a genie. Amidst the subplots of Gunny's battle
with cancer, Jeanne's romance with both Jack and an
old friend Phil and Ibm's struggle to llnd a positive
male role model, the genie grants the family three
wishes.
Swavze's Jack is a mysterious drifter with a heart of
gold. His penetrating blue eyes and fluid, dance-like
movements add to his strong screen presence. Like few
actors, Swayzc's quietly intense acting style is best in
the scenes with little dialogue. Mastrantonio and
Swayze are superb together, though her performance
stands slightly in his shadow. Jeanne's strength and
motherly warmth pour from Mastrantonio s facial ex
pressions and glowing smile.
The biggest scene stealer, however, is little Gunny.
At the beginning of the movie, lie's scared ol heights,
dogs, water, monsters — virtually everything imagin
able. by the end, he is literally flying through an

amusement park reaching out to touch the fireworks.
Mumy's cherub-like smile and precious toddler voice
would make Scrooge grin.
The producers have a fourth wish tor this film. They
took out ads in the Los Angeles Times and The New York
Times last week offering to donate $ 1 ()(),()()() to the
Make A Wish Foundation it Boh Dole and President
Clinton will view this family values movie together. If
Hillary and Chelsea attend, they'll add an extra
$50,000 in Chelsea's name. Dole has accepted and ot
tered to bring the food if ( linton provides the screen
ing room.
I his is a great movie to see with younger siblings,
first dates or even your grandparents because it can by
viewed on numerous levels. It is filled with positive
messages: be yourselt and love what you have. Though
Swayze's sexy charisma isn't for the week of heart, this
is the perfect family movie.
