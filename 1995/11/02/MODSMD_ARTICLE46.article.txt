						steep decline of Hollywood acting

Is there a point to the Oscars anymore?
Who could possibly he nominated this
year?
It'll be a race to see if Demi Moore's single
tear ("The Scarlet letter") can sway the audi
ence from Elizabeth Berkley's glittered nipples
("Showgirls"). Or perhaps Michelle Pfeiffer
will win the honor for pacifying those rowdy
Hast Palo Alto kids with candy ("Dangerous
Minds"). Granted, Meryl Streep will probably
win for enduring Clint Eastwood's seventh
chin, but who could possibly be up against her?
It's somehow worse when you consider
the actors: nominees like Val Kilmer ("Bat
man Forever"), Kevin Costner (' Water
world") and Mel Gibson ("Braveheart"). Per
haps the Academy will be so impressed by
Gary Oldman's rear ("The Scarlet Letter")
that he'll steal it from Tom I lanks ("Apollo
13"). Hanks keeps winning primarily be
cause there isn't any real competition.
Michelle Pfeiffer has a huge capacity of
untapped potential. Nevertheless, this past
summer, 1 walked into a video store in LA.
and told the owner I wanted to rent a good
Pfeiffer film.
She replied, "Oh why don't you rent 'A
River Runs Through It.'That's got pretty girls
in it too."
"No, you don't understand, I want to see a

good Pfeiffer movie I haven't already seen.
"Oh, well rent 'Wolf.'"
I had seen "Wolf."
"Did you think that was a good movie?"
"No, it was awful, but she looked fabulous
in it."
I left the store Pfeifferless and videoless,
but with a disturbing sense of what people
look for in actors and actresses.
Why arc people like Pfeiffer doing films
like "Dangerous Minds?" She's supposed to
be a beacon of hope for our youth, but she
spurts out lines like "I'll get you little fuckers"
as though she's about to pick up an uzi and
gun them down for not doing their poetry
reading. Pfeiffer can't be as clueless as the
movie makes her look.
Speaking of "Clueless," what's up with all
these single-note characters? Alicia Silver
stone had one state of being for that entire
film. And critics raved about Nicole Kidman
in "To Die For," but she was still all one note.
If all I needed to enjoy a movie was a pret
ty face, I would just go to Demi Moore
movies. As the highest paid actress in Holly
wood, she makes disgraceful acting choices.
Some would say she's just an awful actress
and doesn't know any better. But she had to
have something in her to get to this point. I
suspect that in her pure, unaffected form,

Moore is a decent actress. But add the money,
power and quasi-glitzy glamour and you get
I lester Prynne, the sexy leader of the feminist
movement, who, by the way, wore this trendy
little letter 'A' on all her clothing.
A handful of actors are still striving to do
good work, like Kathv Bates, Susan Sarandon
and Helena Bonham Carter. Fortunately,
Emma Thompson has a movie coming out
soon, "Carrington," where she plays the title
character. Let's just pray it's a step up from
"Junior."
Even Angela Bassett, an intelligent, well
trained actress is doing bad work. She's also
choosing bad movies ("Strange Days," "Vam
pire in Brooklyn"). Perhaps that's why we
haven't seen much of the really good actress
es â€” they're all waiting for worthwhile pro
jects.
And what about the boys? 1 iordes of good
men's roles exist and yet few good perfor
mances can be found. "Apollo 13" was a just
below-average movie with average perfor
mances. Eventually people are going to real
ize that Tom Hanks is the same character
with a different accent and clothing. The man
signed a $60 million contract to direct and
star in a picture he wrote himself. What
makes so many 1 lollywood actors think that
they can write and direct, when most of them

can hardly act?
People talked about how Kilmer was a
much better Batman than Michael Keaton.
Please. Kilmer was awful as Batman. He had
no charisma, no inner consciousness and no
history to him. Just pouty lips.
Actors are given far more room to be bad
than actresses in Hollywood. Granted,
Berkley was piss poor in "Showgirls," but she
was no less interesting than Chris O'Donnell
in "Batman Forever." Perhaps people just
thought he looked cute in that muscle-plated
Robin costume.
O'Donnell is a big star, yet he's one of the
blandest people ever to grace the screen. I
could grab some homeless kid oft the street
and promise you he'd be more interesting
looking. He's just becoming a big Hollywood
actor.
The probability that all of these people are
complete morons is rather low. So, I'll guess
that there must just be something in the
water in Hollywood....
Well, we don't have to stand for it. We don't
have to go see "The Scarlet Letter Part II: The
Scarlet Pimpernel," starring Moore as the
gorgeous old hag and O'Donnell as her dash
ing young buck. We can all stay home and
watch "Batman," the animated series. At least
those people have more than one dimension.
