# Fraga's lonely fight
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Luis Fraga won't be administering
any finals come December. He's not
even supposed to be teaching this quar
ter. But to Fraga, an associate professor
of political science and seemingly the
lone champion of campus grape educa
tion, the dorm lounge is his lecture hall.
His quasi-lecture series on the
pros and cons of boycotting grapes Ls
not authorized by the registrar and
hjis no funding behind it, receiving
only verbid support from the Uni
versity. Yet Fraga continues on
almost a weekly basis, holding "dis
cussion sections" from Manzanita
to Lagunita.
Fraga never to be the
administration's sole crusader for
grape education. But in mandating
that Residential Education imple
ment educational programs in every
dorm, University President Ger
hard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza I lice failed to provide the
resources ru>cessary for a more thor
ough effort, Fraga said.
Student enthusiasm has been
equally scarce. The lecture series
might better Ix 3 described as a semi
nar. None of Fraga's discussions in
Manzanita, Stern, Lagunita, Flo
rence Moore or Wilbur H.dls this
fall have drawn more than 30 peo
ple, he said.
Despite the low student turnout
at both educational programs and at
Manzanita's recent vote, Fraga is
not discouraged — only disappoint
ed.
"Students are | not just) deciding
tluit they don't want to learn about

the issue. Rather, they don't want to
hear about the issue," he said Tues
day night from Texas, where he is
conducting research. "Students are
making an a priori judgment rather
than taking time to hear about it."
Less thiui half of Manzanita's
410 residents chose to vote last
weekend on whether the dining hall
should serve grapes, an election that
resulted in a vote of 90 to 82 in favor
of serving grapes. Eollowing the
vote, grape boycott proponents said
that student awareness remains
low, and that hi id students attended
educational discussions, more
would have voted for the boycott.
Fraga, the chair of the Grape
Policy Committee created in May
1994 in response to a student
hunger strike, will continue residen
tial programs on the grape vote. He
will moderate a Res Ed panel dis
cussion Nov. 13 jind biter hold a
dorm discussion in Toyon Hall, after
which most dorms will hold their
referendums.
"I will continue to educate stu
dents on this issue because I am an
educator," said Fraga, a resident fel
low in Castario. "It's my responsibil
ity as both a professor find a resi
dent fellow. If one more person
thinks about (the grape issue] more
seriously than they would other
wise, then it's worth it."
He said he hopes merely that stu
dents will want to be educated, and,
more importantly, that they will

want to vote. Fraga said he dis
counts student claims that grape
education Ls superfluous.
"I don't think iiny of the students
have put in the time that I have," he
said, "so the idea that they're tired
of it 1 can't quite understand."
In future years, Fraga said a re
examination of not only the educa-
prtxxxiures but also the vot
ing requirements will be necessary.
He suggested that a quorum be
reached to decide the issue, and that
dorms refrain from voting until the
completion of all educational pn>
gnims. Residents in Manzanita and

Lagunita, for example, will have
voted l>efore the Nov. 13 discussion.
"I'm concerned that the |Man-
zanita | vote in part occurred {is a
result of a deadline estiiblished by
[residential assistant) staff during
HA training, and I'm not sure if that
deadline was reconsidered in light of
the one major educational pro
gram," Fraga said.
Despite the setbacks, Fraga will
persevere with his dorm discus
sions, and he encouniged other resi
dent fellows to lead their own edu
cational programs to ensure a
thoughtful vote.
