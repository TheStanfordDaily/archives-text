# Law School nets $2M, establishes new chair

The l4iw School's fortune is soaring with
the recent donation of $2 million for faculty
development from a Hay Area law firm.
The donation is the largest of its type on
t he West Coast and the first Stanford has re
ceived from a law firm.
"With this we hope to permanently
strengthen a groat law school," said James
Gaither, a senior partner at the firm of Cooley
Godward Castro Huddleson and Tatum,
which made the donation. Gaither is also a
former president of Stanford's Board of
Trustees.
The gift establishes an endowed chair,
the Edwin E. Huddleson Jr. Professorship,
and awards the honorary title to a
School professor.
"There were two main facets that are be
hind the gift: our respect, and devotion for Ed
[Huddleson I, who was responsible for creat
ing the firm we are today, and the fact that
many of our lawyers went to Stanford,"
Gaither said.
Recent budgetary cutbacks forced the law
school to cut its faculty from 45 to 40, and

some faculty salaries still fall below those of
Stanford's competitors.
The gift "helps support faculty or bring
new faculty," said Susan Bell, associate dean
for development at the School. "The gilt
is designed to provide salary support."
During Homecoming weekend, the Law
School inaugurated its campaign to raise $50
million over the next five years. The current
campaign is chaired by Gaither.
The Huddleson professorship — with con
tributions from the law firm, several of its
partners and Huddleson's friends — brings
the total amount raised so far to over $22 mil
lion in gifts and pledges. According to a Uni
versity press release, the Law School hopes to
use the $50 million to shore up four essential
areas: faculty and curriculum, financial aid, a
new library and the operating budget.
The School's last fund-raising cam
paign, held between 1968 and 1971, raised
$11 million.
Huddleson was a graduate of Stanford
University and Harvard Law School. He was
very involved in the development of Silicon
Valley and was a founder of the firm.
Huddleson died last April.
