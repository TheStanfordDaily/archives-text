Sure, youVe got midterms. But it's raining now â€” are you really going to
study in all that free time? Work for us. If you're interested, come to Daily
10IX this Sunday at noon. It's required for all new writers.
The one-hour program will be held in the Daily offices, corner of Santa
Teresa and Lomita, just across from Terman. Questions? Call Sarah or
Lindsey at 5-2100.
