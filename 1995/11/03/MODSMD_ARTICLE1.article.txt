# Food Research Institute faces downgrade
## H&S dean to increase efficiency, but some fear change harms prestigious center 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The Food Research Institute, Stanford's
internationally renowned economic devel
opment department, will be reduced to an
interdisciplinary center, pending the ap
proval of an administrative recommenda
tion.
Announced in a letter to the institute
this week by John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, the pro
posal calls for the termination of the 74-
year-old institute's doctoral program and
for the transfer of master's students to the
International Policy Studies program.
The policy, which still requires approval
from the University president, provost, Ad

visor}' Board of the Academic Council and
Board of Trustees, has left Food Research
students and faculty dismayed and search
ing for the rationale behind Shoven's deci
sion.
"We do not buy the assumption that by
simply putting a different label on it, our
program will continue," said Prof. Scott
Pearson, director of the institute.
'Restructuring' the program
Shoven's statement concurs with the
conclusion of a three-member faculty com
mittee created in February which requested
that the institute be transformed into a
common interdepartmental center because
of an expected wave of retirements by cur
rent institute faculty.

"l would view it as a closure and as a re
structuring," Shoven said yesterday. "We
think we can be better at this, have more ex
cellence in the area of food research and eco
nomic development with a structure cen
tered around interdisciplinary depart
ments."
The institute currently hires its own fac
ulty. The proposed Center for Economic
Development and Food Research will only
be able to draw faculty from University de
partments, Shoven said.
Students currently enrolled in degree
programs in the institute will still have the
opportunity to complete their studies, while
next year's master's students will likely en
roll in the International Policy Studies mas
ter's program, where they can specialize in

economic development, Shoven said.
Last academic year, about 50 graduate
students were pursuing studies at the insti
tute. Six doctoral students received their
Ph.D.s last June. This year, about 40 stu
dents are studying at the institute.
The University will guarantee depart
mental positions for tenured faculty. Ju
nior faculty, however, will be laid off in
three years, Shoven said.
"We are not getting out of this business,"
he said. "We are restructuring how we do
it."
Students and faculty at the institute
argue that eliminating the doctoral pro
gram alone will kill the international signif-

icance of the institute and its
research and hurt faculty recruit
ment. The institute's doctoral
graduates have historically found
jobs with the World Bank, the
International Monetary Eund
and other international finance
organizations.
"It's frustrating to understand
why it's going to be cut given its
success," said David Widawsky, a
fifth-year doctoral student who
recently won one of six Rocke
feller fellowships worldwide. "We
just don't see that the explana
tion is sufficient in cutting off
contribution to the international
community."
While a student in Colorado
State University's interdisci
plinary master's program,
Widawsky said he was not suc
cessful in securing faculty sup
port or funding for his research.
"Professors are going to give
resources to people in their
department," he said. "Students
in interdisciplinary programs are

always going to be second-tier."
Changing structure
The institute, initiated by
President Hoover in 1921 to
study the production, consump-

tion and distri
bution of food on
a global basis,
reported directly
to the provost
until 1975, when
University offi
cials placed it
under the aus
pices of the
School of

Humanities and Sciences.
However, faculty members are
loyal first to their department
and second to their interdisci
plinary center, Pearson said. The
proposed arrangement, he added,
would limit faculty dedication to
developing curriculum.
"To say you can have the same
kind of thing ... is, I think, fatu
ous reasoning," he said. "It just
won't happen."
The proposed change is cost
effective because the new center
will have fewer faculty but will
still receive the same endow

ments and grants, Shoven said.
He emphasized that financial con
cerns were secondary, however.
The expected retirement of six of
the institute's 13 faculty mem
bers will provide flexibility in
future hiring.
The institute's unique stand
ing was one reason it was target
ed for reduction, he added.
Shoven said when considering
"what are the central elements of
a great university, you don't think
of a food research institute."
Pearson discounted the effi
ciency argument for downgrading
the institute, saying it currently
generates $1 million per year for
the University.
The institute offered to reduce
its faculty to 10, but the offer was
rejected, Pearson said. Further
more, the institute cut its staff in
half two years ago due to Univer
sity budget cuts.
Institute representatives will
meet with Provost Condoleezza
Rice on Nov. 13 before making a
formal presentation to the Adviso
ry Board on Nov. 17, Pearson said.
"If we do lose, we lose the
chance of having something really
good here," he said.

a great university, you don't think
of a food research institute."

the University.
The institute offered to reduce
its faculty to 10, but the offer was

The Food Research Institute, Stanford's
internationally renowned economic devel
opment department, will be reduced to an
interdisciplinary center, pending the ap
proval of an administrative recommenda
tion.
Announced in a letter to the institute
this week by John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, the pro
posal calls for the termination of the 74-
year-old institute's doctoral program and
for the transfer of master's students to the
International Policy Studies program.
The policy, which still requires approval
from the University president, provost, Ad

visor}' Board of the Academic Council and
Board of Trustees, has left Food Research
students and faculty dismayed and search
ing for the rationale behind Shoven's deci
sion.
"We do not buy the assumption that by
simply putting a different label on it, our
program will continue," said Prof. Scott
Pearson, director of the institute.
'Restructuring' the program
Shoven's statement concurs with the
conclusion of a three-member faculty com
mittee created in February which requested
that the institute be transformed into a
common interdepartmental center because
of an expected wave of retirements by cur
rent institute faculty.

"l would view it as a closure and as a re
structuring," Shoven said yesterday. "We
think we can be better at this, have more ex
cellence in the area of food research and eco
nomic development with a structure cen
tered around interdisciplinary depart
ments."
The institute currently hires its own fac
ulty. The proposed Center for Economic
Development and Food Research will only
be able to draw faculty from University de
partments, Shoven said.
Students currently enrolled in degree
programs in the institute will still have the
opportunity to complete their studies, while
next year's master's students will likely en
roll in the International Policy Studies mas
ter's program, where they can specialize in

economic development, Shoven said.
Last academic year, about 50 graduate
students were pursuing studies at the insti
tute. Six doctoral students received their
Ph.D.s last June. This year, about 40 stu
dents are studying at the institute.
The University will guarantee depart
mental positions for tenured faculty. Ju
nior faculty, however, will be laid off in
three years, Shoven said.
"We are not getting out of this business,"
he said. "We are restructuring how we do
it."
Students and faculty at the institute
argue that eliminating the doctoral pro
gram alone will kill the international signif-


Scott Pearson
icance of the institute and its
research and hurt faculty recruit
ment. The institute's doctoral
graduates have historically found
jobs with the World Bank, the
International Monetary Eund
and other international finance
organizations.
"It's frustrating to understand
why it's going to be cut given its
success," said David Widawsky, a
fifth-year doctoral student who
recently won one of six Rocke
feller fellowships worldwide. "We
just don't see that the explana
tion is sufficient in cutting off
contribution to the international
community."
While a student in Colorado
State University's interdisci
plinary master's program,
Widawsky said he was not suc
cessful in securing faculty sup
port or funding for his research.
"Professors are going to give
resources to people in their
department," he said. "Students
in interdisciplinary programs are

always going to be second-tier."
Changing structure
The institute, initiated by
President Hoover in 1921 to
study the production, consump-

tion and distri
bution of food on
a global basis,
reported directly
to the provost
until 1975, when
University offi
cials placed it
under the aus
pices of the
School of

Humanities and Sciences.
However, faculty members are
loyal first to their department
and second to their interdisci
plinary center, Pearson said. The
proposed arrangement, he added,
would limit faculty dedication to
developing curriculum.
"To say you can have the same
kind of thing ... is, I think, fatu
ous reasoning," he said. "It just
won't happen."
The proposed change is cost
effective because the new center
will have fewer faculty but will
still receive the same endow

ments and grants, Shoven said.
He emphasized that financial con
cerns were secondary, however.
The expected retirement of six of
the institute's 13 faculty mem
bers will provide flexibility in
future hiring.
The institute's unique stand
ing was one reason it was target
ed for reduction, he added.
