# Food Research Institute faces downgrade
## H&S dean to increase efficiency, but some fear change harms prestigious center 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The Food Research Institute, Stanford's
internationally renowned economic devel
opment department, will be reduced to an
interdisciplinary center, pending the ap
proval of an administrative recommenda
tion.
Announced in a letter to the institute
this week by John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, the pro
posal calls for the termination of the 74-
year-old institute's doctoral program and
for the transfer of master's students to the
International Policy Studies program.
The policy, which still requires approval
from the University president, provost, Ad

visor}' Board of the Academic Council and
Board of Trustees, has left Food Research
students and faculty dismayed and search
ing for the rationale behind Shoven's deci
sion.
"We do not buy the assumption that by
simply putting a different label on it, our
program will continue," said Prof. Scott
Pearson, director of the institute.
'Restructuring' the program
Shoven's statement concurs with the
conclusion of a three-member faculty com
mittee created in February which requested
that the institute be transformed into a
common interdepartmental center because
of an expected wave of retirements by cur
rent institute faculty.

"l would view it as a closure and as a re
structuring," Shoven said yesterday. "We
think we can be better at this, have more ex
cellence in the area of food research and eco
nomic development with a structure cen
tered around interdisciplinary depart
ments."
The institute currently hires its own fac
ulty. The proposed Center for Economic
Development and Food Research will only
be able to draw faculty from University de
partments, Shoven said.
Students currently enrolled in degree
programs in the institute will still have the
opportunity to complete their studies, while
next year's master's students will likely en
roll in the International Policy Studies mas
ter's program, where they can specialize in

economic development, Shoven said.
Last academic year, about 50 graduate
students were pursuing studies at the insti
tute. Six doctoral students received their
Ph.D.s last June. This year, about 40 stu
dents are studying at the institute.
The University will guarantee depart
mental positions for tenured faculty. Ju
nior faculty, however, will be laid off in
three years, Shoven said.
"We are not getting out of this business,"
he said. "We are restructuring how we do
it."
Students and faculty at the institute
argue that eliminating the doctoral pro
gram alone will kill the international signif-
