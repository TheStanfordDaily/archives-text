# Man hijacks school bus
## Standoff ends with fatal shooting; students unharmed 
### 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -
For 75 terrifying minutes yester
day, an edgy man with a small bag
stood on a school bus with 11 dis
abled children aboard, repeatedly
reaching into his jacket as if he
had a gun and threatening to
blow everyone up.
Four times, the bus, surround
ed by police cars as it traveled 15
miles of Miami-area highways,
came to a stop at the hijacker's
request. Several times, he
crouched down and gathered his
whimpering young hostages
around him to shield himself
from the police.
When negotiations failed,
police shot him to death at the
door of the bus and dragged him
into an alley.
After it was over, the crying
children — some of whom have
autism or speech impediments —
were taken into Joe's Stone Crab
restaurant, where the hijacker
was a waiter, and were given
Cokes, french fries and ice cream.
Seven-year-old Brian Morales
called the hijacker "a had person."
The hijacker was identified as

Catalino "Nick" Sang, 42, a
native of the Dominican Republic
who had lived legally in the Unit
ed States since 1984 and went to
church every day.
Sang walked off his job
Wednesday night, telling his boss
he couldn't handle the pressure.
Yesterday, Sang asked his daugh
ter to pray for him, went to
church, became hysterical and
started ranting, said Fred Taylor,
director of the Metro-Dade Police
Department.
"He was not coherent and he
made several threats. He was dis
turbed, yelling. He was not ratio
nal," Taylor said.
Sang had been angry with the
Internal Revenue Service and ini
tially said he wanted to go to an
IRS office, police said.
"We were hostages because he
owed money to the government,"
said Nubia Castellanos, a mother
ordered onto the bus by Sang as
she helped her autistic son get on.
During the hijacking, Sang
carried a bag and told police he
had a bomb. But the device
turned out to be one of the chil

dren's respirators and police
found no weapon.
The youngsters were on the
way to their school, Blue Lakes
Elementary, when Sang forced his
way aboard at a stop and told bus
driver Alicia Chapman in Spanish,
"I'm taking control," police said.
A convoy of pursuing police
cars, lights flashing, quickly
formed around the bus as the
vehicle, with the door wide open
and the bus driver obeying the
rules of the road, traveled at a
cautious 35 mph to 40 mph, below
the 55 mph limit.
"The bus driver said she felt
threatened, because the subject,
when he argued with her, would
reach inside his jacket. She
thought he might shoot her," said
Pat Brickman, a Metro-Dade
police spokesman.
"She kept the subject calm, she
kept reasoning with him. She said
'I'll take you where you want to
go.' I would give her a lot of cred
it, not just for keeping the kids
calm but for keeping this hijacker
in a lucid state so that he didn't
shoot anybody," he said.
