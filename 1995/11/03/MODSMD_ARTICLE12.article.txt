# Poll shows voters wary of GOP budget
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Fifty-one per
cent of Americans think the Republi
cans' proposals to cut spending go too
far, and Medicare is their main worry,
an Associated Press poll found.
The poll also found that Americans
overwhelmingly doubt the GOP will
deliver on a tax cut. In fact, 55 percent
think their family's taxes will go up
next year as a result of the decisions
made in Washington.
A tax cut of $245 billion over seven
years is a central promise of the bud
get-balancing plans approved by the
House and Senate last week and
threatened with a veto by President
Clinton.
The poll, taken last Friday through
Tuesday, asked 1,008 Americans if

there any programs they are particu
larly worried about being cut. Medicare
is the most frequent answer, especially
among women. It is mentioned by 36
percent of all adults, and 56 percent of
those age 55 and older.
Republican leaders insist they are
not cutting Medicare but are holding
down its growth to keep the health
insurance program for older Ameri
cans from running out of money.
While a majority of those polled
think the GOP plans go too far, 30 per
cent say the spending reductions do
not go far enough, and 7 percent say
they are about right.
Overall, 41 percent put more trust
in Clinton than the Republicans in
Congress to make the hard choices

involved in balancing the budget, up
from 32 percent in an AP poll in June,
when there was more focus on the
president's own budget-cutting plans.
Some 36 percent put more trust in
the Republicans, virtually unchanged
from 37 percent in June. Eighteen per
cent don't trust either side.
The polls were taken by phone by
ICR Survey Research Group of Media,
Pa., part of AUS Consultants. Results
have a margin of sampling error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
At all income levels, half or more of
those surveyed think their taxes will go
up. Two-thirds of these people think
their taxes will go up more than $50,
including 38 percent who expect a rise
of* morn 112 hnn $ 1 00
