Letterman sees show's end
NEW YORK (AP) - The era of Top 10
lists, Stupid Pet Tricks and flying canned
hams may be winding down.
David Letterman says he'll probably
call it quits when his contract expires
just before the decade ends.
"I think more than likely we will stay
here through the contract, and then
that'll be it for us," he told the Daily
News. "Unless something dramatic
happens, this is probably our last hur
rah."
"It doesn't seem like that big a deal to
me if I want to retire when I'm in my
505." said Letterman, 48.

Letterman blamed CBS's declining
prime-time numbers for his own ratings,
which have fallen behind Jay Leno's
"Tonight Show" for the past two
months.
"Jay, with his success, has had the
benefit of a very strong thriving network
underneath him. And we, for over a year
now, have not had that benefit," Letter
man said.
The first phase of Letterman's CBS
contract runs through next summer, and
the network has an option for four more
years.
CBS Broadcast Group President Peter
Lund told the News he's confident Let
terman wiil change his mind.
