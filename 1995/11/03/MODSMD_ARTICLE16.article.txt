## Alcohol revisited 
### 
IN HER STATE of Student
Affairs speech last October,
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds urged
Stanford to help her curb alcohol
consumption on campus.
Then the issue died down for
the rest of the year.
Last week, however, respond
ing to confusion over perceived
changes in the enforcement of
the alcohol policy, Edmonds
announced that this year a
review of Stanford's alcohol poli
cy — including the creation of a
new task force — will take place.
In the three years she has been
here, Edmonds has made it clear
that she is no fan of the current
alcohol policy. In that time, how
ever, little has resulted but a few
abstract speeches — and little
else.
With the creation of a new task
force, there may be some forward
progress. Considering Edmonds'
outspoken views on the subject,

however, those who take pride in
Stanford's open residential atmo
sphere should be concerned.
Edmonds has been careful to
distance herself from recent con
cerns that resident assistants are
being turned into police. Edmonds
indicted alcohol for "destroy!ing]
community" but then proceeded to
muse on the importance of "main
taining a healthy lifestyle in order
to make the most" of the college
experience.
The alcohol policy needs to be
addressed, but it should be
addressed in a clear, rational way.
We're tired of abstractions.
People drink at Stanford. If the
University has a problem with
this, it should say so. By address
ing this issue in a sporadic,
abstract and unclear manner,
Edmonds has done students a
disservice.
We can only hope that the task
force — if it is actually created —
does things better.
