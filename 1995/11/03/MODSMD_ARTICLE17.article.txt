UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Gerhard Casper is one of
the powerful and recog
nized leaders of Stanford. And yet,
how many students can say they
have personally met our elusive
leader? And for those students
who are fortunate enough to have
met him, did that meeting take
place during a fund-raising event?
While the demands on Casper's
time are undoubtedly substantial,
the choice to spare a few moments
each week to meet with students
should not be boiled down into
what appears to be one of econom
ic utility.
For example, last year Casper
helped to man the 1995 Senior Gift
table in White Plaza. It was quite a
scene, as the prim and proper schol
ar of constitutional law held up a
megaphone, hailing senior students
down and asking them if they had
made their contribution yet.
While the presidential endorse

ment was amusing, it was made
primarily to raise money. Indeed it
seems that many of the events
Casper attends are linked with
some sort of fund-raising activity,
from football games to last week's
senior reception, where he was
flanked by promotional items from
the Alumni Association and orga
nizers from the 1996 Senior Gift.
Unfortunately, events that have
little economic value appear to be
at the bottom of the president's
list, like last year's Viennese Ball,
which he was scheduled to attend,
but cancelled. And while Casper
did attend an ASSU Senate meet
ing last week, the event was more
of a choreographed press release
than an informal dialogue with
student leaders.
Realizing that, intentionally or
not, his actions are sending certain
messages, Casper should try to
meet more often with students on
a more informal basis.
