## Oh grape, it's Gohlke

Many researchers say that
the majority of human communi
cation is redundant, containing
essentially no new, salient information.
These researchers, who thus generously
imply that a small percentage of our
exchanges are useful, have obviously not
been reading The Stanford Daily lately.
In Jin attempt to cure this load surplus
of unnecessary conversation as a medieval
physician would — that is, by further
injury — the following will be, quite merci
lessly, about grapes. That's right, gringo.
Uvas. Otra vez.
Here the reader asks, "For the love of
God, why?" And I reply, because, even after
scores of grape-flavored articles, letters and
opinion pieces, the issue of the boycott has
not been adequately explored beyond it's
surface. A towering stack of desperate let
ters on my desk testifies to this — letters
from members of the Stanford community,
who, failed by the mainstream media and
the administration alike, have turned to me
for answers. Answers about grapes.
(J: I love peanut butter and jelly sandwich
es. Supporting the ban was easy until my
friend called me a dirty hypocrite for using
grape jelly. Do grape-based condiments
count?
A: Since most grape jellies are indeed made
with the grape itself, you'll have to jettison
the jam to avoid summer-soldier status. My
advice to you is to try other jellies with your

peanut butter. Strawberry is a personal
favorite of mine, and boysenberry looks and
tastes remotely like the forbidden fruit,
especially if you keep repeating to yourself,
as you eat it, "Man, I love grape jelly."
(J: How about Grape Poupon?
A: Phonetic confusion aside, the gourmet
mustard actually contains white wine, so
watch out.
Q: Sometimes I like to stuff grapes in my
cheeks. I don't eat them — 1 just see how
many 1 can fit in my mouth. Then I spit
them out. Would this be in violation of the
grape ban?
A: This is a touchy mid much-discussed dis
tinction. The case is not as obvious as eat
ing grapes, but you are still employing
them. Most supermarkets would require
you to actually purchase the grapes in order
to engage in this activity; in which case you
woidd be supporting grape farmers, regard
less of the end use of their product.
Q: Sometimes I like to stick one grape in
each of my nostrils. Or I put them over my
eyes, squint really hard, and say, "Hey, I
can't see 'cause my eyes are damn grapes!"
If I want to support the grape boycott,
should I cease this behavior?
A: Probably. These antics, like those in the
previous question, require grape purchases.
Why not try olives, cherry tomatoes or some
other small, semi-spherical seed-bearer?
Q: How about Grape Bubblicious? You
don't really eat it, right?

A: 'l'he word from the experts is, "Grape
bubble-gum is okay." The important dis
tinction here is that the product contains
no actual grapes, although some militants
might object to the symbolic promotion of
the fruit, since the product does involve the
idea of grapeness. The same applies for
grape Skittles, grape Life-Savers, grape
soda and the like.
Q: Picking the purple Froot out of
the bowl is getting to be a real drag. I've
been late to class twice now because of the
time-consuming process. Any advice?
A: Studies have shown that Froot Ixiops
contain a rainbow of fruit colors, but not
flavors; that is, each color actually has the
same vague and non-specific fruity taste.
Objecting to the very color purple because
of its grapish implications would clearly be
extravagant. Hence, de-grape your cereal
no longer.
The issue until now has been a fruitless
debate over whether to grape or not to
grape. But the queries above seem to
address a greater philosophical mystery,
one I hope 1 have helped to elucidate here,
essentially: "What is grape?"
