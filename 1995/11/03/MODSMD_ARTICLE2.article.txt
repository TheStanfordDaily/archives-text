# Student groups embark on Stanford Fund partnership
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
About eight interested student groups showed up to
an informational meeting last night as the Stanford
Fund and the ASSU kicked off the new Student Group
Partnership.
The Stan ford Fund, which was created last fall to raise
money for undergraduate programs, restricts alumni so
licitations by student groups. Reacting to protests after
the Office of Development announced the now regula
tions, a committee of students and administrators last
spring developed the Studeni Group Partnership as one
of three fund-raising compromises.
The partnership allows group members to raise
money by doing administrative work for the Stanford
Fund.
This academic year, the Office of Development has
committed $150,000 of its Stanford Fund receipts to
participants in the new program, $50,000 of which are

matching funds.
Groups can work up to 25 hours a week and earn $20
per person per hour for a maximum of 375 hours per
academic year. The Stanford Fund will increase their
earnings 50 percent if the groups complete all of the
hours requested in their proposal, till members show up
for assigned shifts and the groups perform satisfactory
work. Each group can earn a maximum of $11,250.
Applications to raise money through the program
must be "for specific programs or activities, and not for
general budget support," said Program Coordinator
Jonathan Berent.
Groups r;use money through the program by signing
members up for shifts in which they work for the Stan
ford Fund. The work includes activities like writing
thank-you notes to recent donors, updating them on
current events and conducting surveys.
"There is no soliciting involved," Berent said. "We
mostly want to build alumni rela
tions."
Berent said it is important to
show alumni the difference their
donations make to students.
"We are demonstrating that
student groups really need alumni
support," he said.
Council of Presidents member
Mike Choo agreed. "A lot of alum
ni think that Stanford is only aca
demics," Choo said. "By doing this,
we show them otherwise and pro
vide an alternate way to raise
funding."
Groups can submit new applica
tions to raise funds for each new
project. Although most groups will
turn in their first applications this
month, some groups found out
about the fund raising through
(Tiers and have already begun
working in the partnership.
Heather Laird, a member of
The Mind's Eye, worked last week
to help raise money for the literary
journal.
"It was really fun and I felt real

ly good about doing it," Laird said.
"I wrote thank-you notes, mostly
talking about how I had personally
benefited from the Stanford Fund
and my activities with Mind's
Eye."

'A lot of alumni think
that Stanford is only
academics. By doing
this, we show them
otherwise and provide
an alternate way to
raise funding.'

As another example, Rerent
said the Equestrian Club raised
money to buy a western saddle.
"They felt that would help their
program, and it is something
specific that they needed," he
said.
Twenty student groups also
raised $20,000 at the Reunion

Homecoming Weekend.
Women's rugby team member
Monica Klement worked at Home
coming Weekend to raise money
for her team.
"The team hadn't formed yet,
so it was a nice way to meet some
of the other members and build
camaraderie," Klement said. "I
think the money we raised will go
towards our transportation to
games.... It is great to be given
these alternate opportunities to
raise money."
There are two other ways for
students to receive alumni dona
tions. Groups have the option of
soliciting money directly, as long
as they work under the auspices of
the Office of Development. Certain
groups are also eligible for exemp
tions.
Alumni donations to the Stan
ford Eund go to financial aid,
undergraduate library resources,
undergraduate teaching and spe
cial projects such as student
groups. In fiscal year 1994-95, the
fund netted $3,820,624 in dona
tions from 19,584 donors.
Another informational meeting
for groups interested in the part
nership will be held Nov. 9.
