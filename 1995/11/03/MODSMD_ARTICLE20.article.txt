Stanford students need to open their eyes

Stanford students need to open their
eyes and think — it's as simple as
that. I'm talking about how student*
here, in general, don't aire to even look at
the social issues around them. In particu
lar, I'm talking about what happened in
White Plaza last Friday at noon. Two
events unfolded simultaneously: a rally
exposing how Stanford indirectly funds a
military dictatorship in Burma that
slaughters its people and a synchronized
swimming performance by the Kappa Sigs
in the Claw. Now, this is no knock against
fraternities — as a pledge of a housed fra
ternity, I indulge myself in craziness too.
There's nothing at {ill wrong with that.
But while hundreds of people surrounded

t he Claw to watch guys in their bathing
suits, only about 50 listened to the rally.
And therein lies something deeply wrong.
Why? Because Stanford students refuse to
open their eyes and think.
And it's far too easy to get through
Stanford without doing so. I got caught in
that trap, too. I buried myself in my stud
ies and partied hard on the weekends,
week after week, without much real
thought. I was impenetrable. I was set.
Fortunately, though, I met the right peo
ple here who helped me dislodge the blin
ders I had placed on myself. I learned to
think critically about the world around
me — not just about the hydration of
alkenes.

What's important as a student — one
who is free from the bonds that tie down
those in the full-time working force — is
to take a side on an issue. To own an opin
ion. One side or the other, it doesn't mat
ter. We have to care about social issues
that confront us and take a stand because
our thoughts will be the ones shaping the
future of this nation and this planet. So
each of us had better get our values and
opinions straight.
But Stanford students seldom take a
stand. Why not? Because "they don't
know enough about the issue to make a
decision." That's when knowledgeable
students say, "Hey, lets put on a rally to
increase awareness of the atrocities occur

ring in Burma, Let's show everyone how
our very own school invests in companies
that fund the massacre of the Burmese
people."
Then, on Oct. 27, when all the infor
mation is ready to be dropped right in stu
dents' laps, right when an exiled Burmese
student tells first-hand accounts of slav
ery and massive killings (and hence can
never return to his homeland due to his
participation in such a rally), everyone
turns around to watch half-naked guys
dance in a fountain. It's so much easier.
Nobody wants to open their eyes and
think.
