# Michael Greens last column displayed little imagination

Michael Green's cockamamie Wednes
day column, "Genitals, gender roles and
the femme phallus," struck me as obnox
ious and offensive. I had hoped that over
the past 12 years since I was a staff writ
er for the University of Northern Col
orado student newspaper, humorous
enlightenment had come home to campus
life. I felt optimistic as I read the col
umn's curious title, but was disappointed
to find an inane diatribe of stereotypical
homophobia and misogyny.
Well, at least it's clear that Green
finds the tiresome topic of the penis wor
thy of five columns. I've discovered that
some men find ways to go on at length to
make up for certain shortcomings. . . . My
only question is — why spend such
promising cockeyed talents at a small
outspoken campus daily? I hear Rush
Limbaugh is looking for a new writer.
