## Akin Salawu Harassed on Halloween: an unfair police trick-or-treat? 
### 
The police lights sort of surprised me,
so I stopped walking. I was standing
on Serra Street near Palm Drive in
my Stan ford jacket at 10:30 on Halloween
night. The officer backed his air up and
rolled down his window.
"What are you doing here? Where arc
you going?"
"To the store."
"Where are you going?"
"To the store."
"Areyou a student?"
I showed him my Stanford ID.
"1 just wanted to make sure you were
crossing at the crosswalk. "
"Ah.... What's your name?"
"Deputy U"
I le drove off.
In the four years I've been at Stanford,
this is the fifth time I've been stopped and
questioned in this manner by the police.
Earlier this year, I fell asleep in my

dorm's lounge. I was awakened by a police
officer who asked if I lived there. I said yes
and went back to sleep. A few minutes later
the officer entered the lounge with one of
my resident assistants, who told the officer:
"Yeah, he lives here."
The most common excuse offered by the
police for these incidents has been, "We're
searching for somebody who fits your
description."
What description could that possibly
be? I'm sure there are lots of 5'6", 135-
pound black male criminals wreaking
havoc on this campus.
Perhaps I'm overreacting, but were I a
short white male in a Stanford jacket I
would almost definitely not have been
stopped. And what if I hadn't been carry
ing my ID.?
That night I called my mommy. She
suggested I get a white buddy to walk me
around campus. She wasn't surprised

because sadly, this is an extremely com
mon occurrence.
Black men are constantly being
harassed by police officers across the coun
try, so why should Stanford be any differ
ent?
I would hope everyone reading this
knows why Stanford should be different.
Of course, there could be hordes of legit
imate reasons why he stopped me: Perhaps
there really was some short, black, male
criminal hiding out on campus; perhaps
sweet, gorgeous, innocent little me looks
like a criminal; perhaps the police were
more sensitive to people walking alone
because it was Halloween; or perhaps that
nasty little melanin thing brought up
images of "Menace II Society" and South
Central.
True, there have been enough news
events and pop-culture images to make a
police officer more likely to perceive a

young black male as some sort of a threat
to the safety of the Stanford ivory tower. I
understand why these things happen, but
I'm still upset.
A relative of mine once told me, "White
people in positions of authority will use
every opportunity to remind you tnat
despite all your intelligence and achieve
ments, you're still just a nigger." I used to
think he was absolutely wrong. Hut now, I
really don't know.
Perhaps I should take comfort in the
fact that the Stanford Police probably
question everyone who looks suspicious.
Hut I know that everybody who walks
down Palm Drive at night doesn't get
stopped.
And what exactly constitutes "suspi
cious"? Could it have been the Stanford
jacket, which I probably stole from a legiti
mate student? Could it have been that
guilty expression I can't seem to wipe off

my face, or perhaps the way I wear my
hair?
I would be less upset if this were the
first time I had ever been questioned by a
police officer, but it's not. Ironically, the
only times I've even been approached by
the police have been at Stanford. Relative
to black men across the country, five times
in four years isn't so bad. But relative to
other Stanford students, five times isn't so
good either.
Since Halloween, I've been asking other
students, particularly white ones, if
they've ever been stopped by the Stanford
Police. (Most of them say they only get
stopped for bike violations.) I have yet to
encounter any white or female students
who've been stopped while they were walk
ing somewhere.
Regardless of whether or not this was
the first time this has happened to me or
to anyone, it needs to be the last.
