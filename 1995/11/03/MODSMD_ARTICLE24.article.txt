## Water polo opens a rocky road trip with 11-10 defeat 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
I Long Beach St. 11

Something happened to the
Stanford men's water polo team
on its way to Los Angeles. In a
game that was supposed to serve
more as a warmup for contests
with USC and UCLA rather than
an actual test, the No. 5 Cardinal
(13-7, 2-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) caved in to the
Long Beach State 49ers Thursday
night, 11-10.
After breaking out of a four
game funk with a victory over
Pepperdine last Sunday, the Car
dinal was beginning a three-day
tour of Southern California. With
games against Nos. 1 and 2 USC
and UCLA also on the agenda,
No. 7 Long Beach (8-9, 3-5
MPSF) was certainly not the
headline stop on the road trip. As
head coach Dante Dettamanti has
warned his team, however, it can
he dangerous to overlook any
team in the highly competitive
MPSF.
In the first quarter, the Cardi
nal reverted to the style of play
that cost it victories earlier in the
season. Unable to execute offen
sively, Stanford seemed to be
expecting its reputation do all the
work. After one period of play, the

Cardinal trailed the 49ers, 5-4.
Dettamanti's squad seemed to
be turning things around in the
second quarter, outscoring Long
Beach 4-2, to take a one-point
advantage into halftime.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, the second quarter proved to
be an aberration rather than the
rule. After the break, the Stan
ford offense suffered an unprece
dented power outage, producing
only two goals. The 49ers were
not much better, but Long Bcach
managed to scrape together four
goals, which was good enough for
the win.
While the Long Beach game
was a rocky beginning, the Cardi
nal will have a chance to salvage
the rest of the road trip with vic
tories against UClj\ and USC.
Today's game against the Bru
ins will be a rematch of a contest
that took place at Stanford's
deGuerre pool two weeks ago. In
that game, the Cardinal came out
of the gate slow, allowing UCLA
to build a substantial lead. After
making a late rally to tie the
game, a Cardinal defensive mis
cue as time expired gave the Bru
ins the opportunity to win 8-7.
After tangling with UCIA, the
Cardinal will make the trip across
town to face the Trojans tomor
row. USC sits once again on top of
the heap of collegiate water polo,
following a pair of losses by previ
ous No. 1 California last week
end.

Tomorrow's contest marks
the third time that the Cardinal
and Trojans have met this sea

son, with USC holding a 2-0
edge. The Trojans hested Stan
ford in the finals of the Northern
California Tournament, 14-13 in
overtime. USC then visited
deGuerre pool the following
week, where it again handed the
Cardinal an overtime loss, 8-7.

The two losses sent Dettamanti's
squad into a skid, losing its next
two games before turning things
around against Pepperdine last
weekend.
Needless to say, back-to-back
games against the top two teams
in the nation is a tough assign

ment for the Cardinal, and the
addition of the Long Beach game
at the front of the road trip
makes the trek down to South
ern California quite a gauntlet.
But, says Dettamanti, the great
teams always rise to the occa
sion.
"I think that we are going to
find out this weekend if we can
continue the success that we
experienced agaisnt Pepper
dine," Dettamanti said, referring
to his team's 15-11 victory over
the Waves last Sunday. "We are
really going to find out a lot
about our team. This is basically
a gut check for the guys, a chance
for them to show that they have
both the talent and the desire to
be NCAA champions."
Two factors make the three
game stretch what Dettamanti
described as "by far the most dif
ficult weekend of the season."
Not only does the Cardinal have
to play three games in three days
against top-10 teams, but it has
to on the road. In addition, the
Trojans and Bruins have only
Stanford on this week's calendar,
meaning that they will be well
rested. In contrast, during the
MPSF tournament, every team
will play three games, putting
the various schools on more or
less level playing fields.

Regardless of the obstacles
which stand in its way, this
weekend's matches will serve as
an excellent opportunity for the
Cardinal to prepare for the rigors
of the MPSF tourney. Whichever
team captures the conference
title will gain a much coveted bid
to the NCAA championship tour
nament, which is being held at
Stanford's deGuerre Pool the
first weekend of December.
The game against USC in par
ticular will be of interest to Det
tamanti, as the Trojans will like
ly be the Cardinal's opponent in
the first round of the MPSF
tournament. The matchups for
the first round of the tourney are
determined by league records.
Despite being the top-ranked
team in the country, the Trojans
are currently fourth in the con
ference, illustrating the tremen
dous parity that exists in the
league. The Cardinal, mean
while, occupies the fifth spot in
the conference, and thus would
face USC. Winning the game this
weekend would help to dispel the
magic that the Trojans have had
over the Cardinal this year.
"We have to start establishing
ourselves, and showing everyone
that we want to play in the
NCAA tournament," Dettamanti
said.

that took place at Stanford's
deGuerre pool two weeks ago. In
that game, the Cardinal came out
of the gate slow, allowing UCLA
to build a substantial lead. After
making a late rally to tie the
game, a Cardinal defensive mis
cue as time expired gave the Bru
ins the opportunity to win 8-7.
After tangling with UCIA, the
Cardinal will make the trip across
town to face the Trojans tomor
row. USC sits once again on top of
the heap of collegiate water polo,
following a pair of losses by previ
ous No. 1 California last week
end.

Tomorrow's contest marks
the third time that the Cardinal
and Trojans have met this sea

son, with USC holding a 2-0
edge. The Trojans hested Stan
ford in the finals of the Northern
California Tournament, 14-13 in
overtime. USC then visited
deGuerre pool the following
week, where it again handed the
Cardinal an overtime loss, 8-7.

The two losses sent Dettamanti's
squad into a skid, losing its next
two games before turning things
around against Pepperdine last
weekend.
Needless to say, back-to-back
games against the top two teams
in the nation is a tough assign

ment for the Cardinal, and the
addition of the Long Beach game
at the front of the road trip
makes the trek down to South
ern California quite a gauntlet.
But, says Dettamanti, the great
teams always rise to the occa
sion.
"I think that we are going to
find out this weekend if we can
continue the success that we
experienced agaisnt Pepper
dine," Dettamanti said, referring
to his team's 15-11 victory over
the Waves last Sunday. "We are
really going to find out a lot
about our team. This is basically
a gut check for the guys, a chance
for them to show that they have
both the talent and the desire to
be NCAA champions."
Two factors make the three
game stretch what Dettamanti
described as "by far the most dif
ficult weekend of the season."
Not only does the Cardinal have
to play three games in three days
against top-10 teams, but it has
to on the road. In addition, the
Trojans and Bruins have only
Stanford on this week's calendar,
meaning that they will be well
rested. In contrast, during the
MPSF tournament, every team
will play three games, putting
the various schools on more or
less level playing fields.

Regardless of the obstacles
which stand in its way, this
weekend's matches will serve as
an excellent opportunity for the
Cardinal to prepare for the rigors
of the MPSF tourney. Whichever
team captures the conference
title will gain a much coveted bid
to the NCAA championship tour
nament, which is being held at
Stanford's deGuerre Pool the
first weekend of December.
The game against USC in par
ticular will be of interest to Det
tamanti, as the Trojans will like
ly be the Cardinal's opponent in
the first round of the MPSF
tournament. The matchups for
the first round of the tourney are
determined by league records.
Despite being the top-ranked
team in the country, the Trojans
are currently fourth in the con
ference, illustrating the tremen
dous parity that exists in the
league. The Cardinal, mean
while, occupies the fifth spot in
the conference, and thus would
face USC. Winning the game this
weekend would help to dispel the
magic that the Trojans have had
over the Cardinal this year.
"We have to start establishing
ourselves, and showing everyone
that we want to play in the
NCAA tournament," Dettamanti
said.

I Long Beach St. 11

Something happened to the
Stanford men's water polo team
on its way to Los Angeles. In a
game that was supposed to serve
more as a warmup for contests
with USC and UCLA rather than
an actual test, the No. 5 Cardinal
(13-7, 2-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) caved in to the
Long Beach State 49ers Thursday
night, 11-10.
After breaking out of a four
game funk with a victory over
Pepperdine last Sunday, the Car
dinal was beginning a three-day
tour of Southern California. With
games against Nos. 1 and 2 USC
and UCLA also on the agenda,
No. 7 Long Beach (8-9, 3-5
MPSF) was certainly not the
headline stop on the road trip. As
head coach Dante Dettamanti has
warned his team, however, it can
he dangerous to overlook any
team in the highly competitive
MPSF.
In the first quarter, the Cardi
nal reverted to the style of play
that cost it victories earlier in the
season. Unable to execute offen
sively, Stanford seemed to be
expecting its reputation do all the
work. After one period of play, the

Cardinal trailed the 49ers, 5-4.
Dettamanti's squad seemed to
be turning things around in the
second quarter, outscoring Long
Beach 4-2, to take a one-point
advantage into halftime.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, the second quarter proved to
be an aberration rather than the
rule. After the break, the Stan
ford offense suffered an unprece
dented power outage, producing
only two goals. The 49ers were
not much better, but Long Bcach
managed to scrape together four
goals, which was good enough for
the win.
While the Long Beach game
was a rocky beginning, the Cardi
nal will have a chance to salvage
the rest of the road trip with vic
tories against UClj\ and USC.
Today's game against the Bru
ins will be a rematch of a contest
that took place at Stanford's
deGuerre pool two weeks ago. In
that game, the Cardinal came out
of the gate slow, allowing UCLA
to build a substantial lead. After
