## Water polo opens a rocky road trip with 11-10 defeat

Something happened to the
Stanford men's water polo team
on its way to Los Angeles. In a
game that was supposed to serve
more as a warmup for contests
with USC and UCLA rather than
an actual test, the No. 5 Cardinal
(13-7, 2-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) caved in to the
Long Beach State 49ers Thursday
night, 11-10.
After breaking out of a four
game funk with a victory over
Pepperdine last Sunday, the Car
dinal was beginning a three-day
tour of Southern California. With
games against Nos. 1 and 2 USC
and UCLA also on the agenda,
No. 7 Long Beach (8-9, 3-5
MPSF) was certainly not the
headline stop on the road trip. As
head coach Dante Dettamanti has
warned his team, however, it can
he dangerous to overlook any
team in the highly competitive
MPSF.
In the first quarter, the Cardi
nal reverted to the style of play
that cost it victories earlier in the
season. Unable to execute offen
sively, Stanford seemed to be
expecting its reputation do all the
work. After one period of play, the

Cardinal trailed the 49ers, 5-4.
Dettamanti's squad seemed to
be turning things around in the
second quarter, outscoring Long
Beach 4-2, to take a one-point
advantage into halftime.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, the second quarter proved to
be an aberration rather than the
rule. After the break, the Stan
ford offense suffered an unprece
dented power outage, producing
only two goals. The 49ers were
not much better, but Long Bcach
managed to scrape together four
goals, which was good enough for
the win.
While the Long Beach game
was a rocky beginning, the Cardi
nal will have a chance to salvage
the rest of the road trip with vic
tories against UClj\ and USC.
Today's game against the Bru
ins will be a rematch of a contest
that took place at Stanford's
deGuerre pool two weeks ago. In
that game, the Cardinal came out
of the gate slow, allowing UCLA
to build a substantial lead. After
making a late rally to tie the
game, a Cardinal defensive mis
cue as time expired gave the Bru
ins the opportunity to win 8-7.
After tangling with UCIA, the
Cardinal will make the trip across
town to face the Trojans tomor
row. USC sits once again on top of
the heap of collegiate water polo,
following a pair of losses by previ
ous No. 1 California last week
end.
