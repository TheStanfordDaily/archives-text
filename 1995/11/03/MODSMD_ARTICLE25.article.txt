# Men's soccer out to tackle Broncos
## 
### Alan Eaton Contributing writer 
After posting its best offensive
showing of the season in a 4-2 tri
umph over California, the Stan
ford men's soccer team (5-10-1
overall, 2-4-0 Mountain Pacific-
Sports Federation) will travel to
south to play Santa Clara (9-2-2,
2-1-1 West Coast Conference) on
Sunday night at 7:30 p.m.
While the Cardinal will play the
Broncos on almost a week of rest,
the Broncos must first battle the
Dons in San Francisco tonight in a
match that may decide the WCC
title (Santa Clara would move into
first place with a win against the
Dons). Stanford will also have the
advantage of playing at Buck
Shaw Stadium, where Santa Clara
recently ended a three-game win
less streak.
Santa Clara's midfield is the
heart of the Bronco team. Oppo
nents had shutout the Santa Clara
midfielders for the first eight
matches of the season. However,
the group has improved vastly
since, scoring eight of the nine
Bronco goals in the last five
matches.
Senior Mike Lynch leads the
Broncos in scoring, but he will not
compete against the Cardinal after
injuring his ankle in the team's
last match against Portland. He
will sit out indefinitely.
Sophomore midfielder Derrick

Harris ranks as Santa Clara's sec
ond highest scorer and has proven
the most effective in the Broncos'
last five matches, posting four
goals and one assist. Senior mid
fielder Derick Brownell has
deposited three balls in the net
and assisted thrice.
Santa Clara's best defender
may very well be its final one.
Goalkeeper Joe Cannon's 0.71
goals-against average is second
best in the WCC. The sophomore
has amassed 35 saved while
recording four shutouts.
As for Stanford, the Cardinal is
playing its best soccer since
September, having won two of its
last three matches with the loss
occurring in a heated double-over
time match against San Francisco.
Sophomore Eric Vandevelde
tops the Cardinal goal list with
four scores. Senior Ryan Estevez
and freshman A.J. Sauer have
added three goals apiece.
The Stanford defenders, led by
senior co-captain Chet Zimmer,
must tighten and prevent the
Broncos' midfield from continuing
its scoring spree for the Cardinal
to win.
The two-headed monster
known as Stanford goalkeeping
has performed well since the begin
ning of the season. Junior Ryan
Craig and freshman Jon Bruck
combine for a 1.84 goals-against
average. Craig has saved 41 balls
while Bruck has stopped 21.
