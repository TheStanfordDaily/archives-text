# Football out to disrupt rosy path
## Stanford upset over No. 14 Trojans can send conference race into frenzy

"Anyone who is in that band
for more than a year must be
psychologically damaged," said
Cardinal senior linebacker Mike
Hall, referring to the USC
band's propensity to repeat the
same song over and over again.
Trojan band members won't
be the only ones going crazy,
however, when Stanford (5-2-1
overall, 3-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) travels south to the Los
Angeles Coliseum to collide with
14th-ranked USC (6-1-1, 4-0-1)
at 12:30 p.m. tomorrow.
It's Homecoming Weekend
for the Trojans and the atmo
sphere, already pumped-up with
tradition, horses and repetitive
songs, will be doubly charged.
"It's like a rallying thing for
us," said Cardinal senior nose
tackle John Hebert. "Our team
versus an entire stadium — I
really enjoy it. It's the best part
of playing football."
The contest also carries great
weight for both squads.
"This really is a big-time col
lege game for both teams," said
senior offensive tackle Nathan
Parks. "What you do in Novem
ber determines almost every
thing."

However, stumbling against the
Cardinal would once again throw
the conference championship up
for grabs.
Meanwhile, Stanford still
remains a bubble team in terms
of postseason positioning. Upset
ting the Trojans in L.A. would gc;
a long way towards ensuring
that the Cardinal is still playing
football come the end of 1995.
"As I told my football team
[before the OSU game], there's
one sure way we can get into a
bowl," said head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "That's to win al
four games I left, in the schedule]
Anything less than that and it's
a maybe."

USC is no longer the jugger
naut it appeared to be when the
season began. Dropping a 38-10
decision to Notre Dame two
weeks ago knocked the Trojans
out of contention for the nation
al title. Last Saturday, it looked
as if the team's Rose Bowl
dreams might come to an end as
well when the Huskies took a 21-
0 lead into the fourth quarter.
However, USC came alive in the
final 15 minutes to salvage the
tie.
"We're obviously shaken by
the events of the last two
weeks," said Trojan head coach
John Robinson, "but when it got
down to the end, with the season
on the line, we responded well."
Despite USC's struggles of
late, Willingham feels the only
change in the Trojans is the way
they are perceived by the media.
"If there is a difference, it's only
the way the team's seen outside
the program," he said. "On the
field, they're the same team —
an aggressive football club with
big, talented athletes. They're
the most talented team we've
faced to date."
One of the big, talented ath
letes of which Willingham
speaks is Keyshawn Johnson. All
conversations concerning USC
eventually turn to the extremely
talented senior wide receiver, a
Heisman hopeful and virtual
lock for Ail-American honors.
In 1994, Johnson grabbed 66
passes for 1,362 yards (20.6
yards per catch) and nine touch
downs. In the Cotton Howl, he
amassed a personal-best and
Cotton Howl record 222 yards on
eight catches for three touch
downs. He ranked first in the
conference in receiving yards
(123.8 yards per game, good for
second in the nation) and third
in receptions (six per game, 12th
in the nation).
With 66 catches (48 for first
downs) for 958 yards in 1995,
Johnson leads the Pac-10 in both
categories by large margins. In
the midst of his second season
with the Trojans, the junior col
lege transfer needs only 23 more

receptions to become USC's all
time leader. With 13 more catch
es, he will set the Pac-10 regular
season record. In 19 games as a
Trojan, Johnson has posted 15
100-yard games.

All the numbers have caused
the never-silent Johnson to quip
that he shouldn't even be
allowed to play college football.
