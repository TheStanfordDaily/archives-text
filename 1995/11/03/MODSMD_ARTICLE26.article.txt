# Football out to disrupt rosy path
## Stanford upset over No. 14 Trojans can send conference race into frenzy 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
"Anyone who is in that band
for more than a year must be
psychologically damaged," said
Cardinal senior linebacker Mike
Hall, referring to the USC
band's propensity to repeat the
same song over and over again.
Trojan band members won't
be the only ones going crazy,
however, when Stanford (5-2-1
overall, 3-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) travels south to the Los
Angeles Coliseum to collide with
14th-ranked USC (6-1-1, 4-0-1)
at 12:30 p.m. tomorrow.
It's Homecoming Weekend
for the Trojans and the atmo
sphere, already pumped-up with
tradition, horses and repetitive
songs, will be doubly charged.
"It's like a rallying thing for
us," said Cardinal senior nose
tackle John Hebert. "Our team
versus an entire stadium — I
really enjoy it. It's the best part
of playing football."
The contest also carries great
weight for both squads.
"This really is a big-time col
lege game for both teams," said
senior offensive tackle Nathan
Parks. "What you do in Novem
ber determines almost every
thing."
USC sits in the driver's seat
for the Pac-10's Rose Howl berth
after securing a last-second tit
with Washington hist Saturday
However, stumbling against the
Cardinal would once again throw
the conference championship up
for grabs.
Meanwhile, Stanford still
remains a bubble team in terms
of postseason positioning. Upset
ting the Trojans in L.A. would gc;
a long way towards ensuring
that the Cardinal is still playing
football come the end of 1995.
"As I told my football team
[before the OSU game], there's
one sure way we can get into a
bowl," said head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "That's to win al
four games I left, in the schedule]
Anything less than that and it's
a maybe."

USC is no longer the jugger
naut it appeared to be when the
season began. Dropping a 38-10
decision to Notre Dame two
weeks ago knocked the Trojans
out of contention for the nation
al title. Last Saturday, it looked
as if the team's Rose Bowl
dreams might come to an end as
well when the Huskies took a 21-
0 lead into the fourth quarter.
However, USC came alive in the
final 15 minutes to salvage the
tie.
"We're obviously shaken by
the events of the last two
weeks," said Trojan head coach
John Robinson, "but when it got
down to the end, with the season
on the line, we responded well."
Despite USC's struggles of
late, Willingham feels the only
change in the Trojans is the way
they are perceived by the media.
"If there is a difference, it's only
the way the team's seen outside
the program," he said. "On the
field, they're the same team —
an aggressive football club with
big, talented athletes. They're
the most talented team we've
faced to date."
One of the big, talented ath
letes of which Willingham
speaks is Keyshawn Johnson. All
conversations concerning USC
eventually turn to the extremely
talented senior wide receiver, a
Heisman hopeful and virtual
lock for Ail-American honors.
In 1994, Johnson grabbed 66
passes for 1,362 yards (20.6
yards per catch) and nine touch
downs. In the Cotton Howl, he
amassed a personal-best and
Cotton Howl record 222 yards on
eight catches for three touch
downs. He ranked first in the
conference in receiving yards
(123.8 yards per game, good for
second in the nation) and third
in receptions (six per game, 12th
in the nation).
With 66 catches (48 for first
downs) for 958 yards in 1995,
Johnson leads the Pac-10 in both
categories by large margins. In
the midst of his second season
with the Trojans, the junior col
lege transfer needs only 23 more

receptions to become USC's all
time leader. With 13 more catch
es, he will set the Pac-10 regular
season record. In 19 games as a
Trojan, Johnson has posted 15
100-yard games.

All the numbers have caused
the never-silent Johnson to quip
that he shouldn't even be
allowed to play college football.

down the middle of the field against Oregon State in the Cardi
nal's therapeutic 24-3 win last weekend.
"It wouldn't bother me if he
didn't play this weekend," Willing
ham joked.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Johnson will be waiting for the
Cardinal when it arrives at the
Coliseum, ready to unleash his
abilities on the secondary, so Stan
ford must adjust accordingly.
"If there is a player that big or
strong, I don't think you can real
ly stop him," Willingham said. "He
wouldn't get all the Heisman
attention and the hoopla if he
wasn't a quality player. Hopefully,
we'll be able to hold him to four or
five receptions."
Robinson echoed Willingham's
sentiments. "I don't think you stop
a player as good as he is," Robinson
said. "Maybe you go out and get
Deion Sanders or something."
The Cardinal will employ a vari
ety of strategies to control the gift
ed Johnson.
"We'll attack him," said junior
free safety Josh Madscn. "We'll
use some man-to-man, we'll run
some blitzes. You don't want to
just sit back and hope."
While Johnson's presence will
cause the secondary considerable
stress, it also places pressure on
the defensive line. Stanford's front
four must make sure that the Tro
jan quarterback doesn't have
enough time to find his go-to-guy.
"There's definitely a sense of
urgency to get in there and mess
things up," Hebert said.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
USC features a formidable group
of offensive linemen, including

heavyweights like center Jeremy
Hogue (6-foot-4, 285 pounds),
right guard Phalen Pounds (6-
foot-7, 310) and right tackle Nor
berto Garrido (6-foot-7, 325).
"I'm impressed with their offen
sive line," Hebert said. "They're
big, strong guys. They fire off t he
ball and punish defenses. It's a real
test for our front seven."
The USC quarterback poses
another problem. Robinson couldn't
decide between junior Brad Otton or
fifth-year senior Kyle Wachholtz, so
he uses them both.
Splitting time hasn't hurt pro
duction at all. Wachholtz leads the
Pac-10 in passing efficiency and
has thrown for six touchdowns.
Otton ranks third and has 10
touchdown tosses under his belt.
The quarterback combination
makes life for the Stanford defense
more difficult. It must come up
with a game plan to combat the
tendencies of not just one talented
passer, but two.
"Just in your mind set you have
to gear up for each athlete because
each one brings different talents to
the table," Willingham said.
The rotation also means that
each play-caller takes less of a
beating over the course of a game.
"It's sort of disappointing,"
Hebert said. "One of the joys as a
defensive lineman is to put a quar
terback on the floor so that by the
third or fourth quarter, he's tired
and beat up. With two, they're
probably more fresh."
The Trojan ground attack, tra
ditionally the team's offensive
strength, took a hit after the third
game of the year when the NCAA
announced that it would under
take an investigation of running
back Shawn Walters for allegedly

accepting money from an agent.
Walters has sat out of competi
tion since that time and his status
for Saturday's game remains uncer
tain. Sophomore Delon Washington
has played in Walters' absence,
rushing for 604 yards on 140 carries
to average 75.5 yards per game.
While Johnson, the quarter
back combo and the rest of the
Trojan offense have captured most
of the attention, the line play of
the USC defense has gone largely
unnoticed. USC ranks second in
the league in both rushing and
pass efficiency defense and holds
opponents to a mere 14.5 points
per game.
Though the defense fell off its
pace in the past two weeks, the
return of defensive end Israel
Ifeanyi from suspension and
linebacker Errick Herrin from
injury will definitely bolster the
Trojan's 5-2 front.
Tackles Matt Keneley and Dar
rell Russell are among the league
leaders in tackles-for-loss.
The Trojans go two deep at
every position in the secondary
without a drop-off in talent. Strong
safety Sammy Knight, free safeties
Micah Phillips and Jesse Davis and
cornerbacks Brian Kelly, Daylon
McCutcheon and Quincy Harrison
will cause problems for Stanford
quarterback Mark Butterfield and
his receivers.
"We have to give them the
respect a great team deserves,"
Parks said. "They're one of the
better defensive fronts we've faced
all year."
Stanford may compete without
the services of freshman running
back Anthony Bookman, who
bruised some ribs against the
Beavers.
"Anyone who is in that band
for more than a year must be
psychologically damaged," said
Cardinal senior linebacker Mike
Hall, referring to the USC
band's propensity to repeat the

on the line, we responded well."
Despite USC's struggles of
late, Willingham feels the only
change in the Trojans is the way
they are perceived by the media.
"If there is a difference, it's only
the way the team's seen outside
the program," he said. "On the
field, they're the same team —
an aggressive football club with
big, talented athletes. They're
the most talented team we've
faced to date."
One of the big, talented ath
letes of which Willingham
speaks is Keyshawn Johnson. All
conversations concerning USC
eventually turn to the extremely
talented senior wide receiver, a
Heisman hopeful and virtual
lock for Ail-American honors.
In 1994, Johnson grabbed 66
passes for 1,362 yards (20.6
yards per catch) and nine touch
downs. In the Cotton Howl, he
amassed a personal-best and
Cotton Howl record 222 yards on
eight catches for three touch
downs. He ranked first in the
conference in receiving yards
(123.8 yards per game, good for
second in the nation) and third
in receptions (six per game, 12th
in the nation).
With 66 catches (48 for first
downs) for 958 yards in 1995,
Johnson leads the Pac-10 in both
categories by large margins. In
the midst of his second season
with the Trojans, the junior col
lege transfer needs only 23 more

receptions to become USC's all
time leader. With 13 more catch
es, he will set the Pac-10 regular
season record. In 19 games as a
Trojan, Johnson has posted 15
100-yard games.

All the numbers have caused
the never-silent Johnson to quip
that he shouldn't even be
allowed to play college football.

Junior wide receiver Brian Manning takes a Mark Butterfield pass
down the middle of the field against Oregon State in the Cardi
nal's therapeutic 24-3 win last weekend.
"It wouldn't bother me if he
didn't play this weekend," Willing
ham joked.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Johnson will be waiting for the
Cardinal when it arrives at the
Coliseum, ready to unleash his
abilities on the secondary, so Stan
ford must adjust accordingly.
"If there is a player that big or
strong, I don't think you can real
ly stop him," Willingham said. "He
wouldn't get all the Heisman
attention and the hoopla if he
wasn't a quality player. Hopefully,
we'll be able to hold him to four or
five receptions."
Robinson echoed Willingham's
sentiments. "I don't think you stop
a player as good as he is," Robinson
said. "Maybe you go out and get
Deion Sanders or something."
The Cardinal will employ a vari
ety of strategies to control the gift
ed Johnson.
"We'll attack him," said junior
free safety Josh Madscn. "We'll
use some man-to-man, we'll run
some blitzes. You don't want to
just sit back and hope."
While Johnson's presence will
cause the secondary considerable
stress, it also places pressure on
the defensive line. Stanford's front
four must make sure that the Tro
jan quarterback doesn't have
enough time to find his go-to-guy.
"There's definitely a sense of
urgency to get in there and mess
things up," Hebert said.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
USC features a formidable group
of offensive linemen, including

heavyweights like center Jeremy
Hogue (6-foot-4, 285 pounds),
right guard Phalen Pounds (6-
foot-7, 310) and right tackle Nor
berto Garrido (6-foot-7, 325).
"I'm impressed with their offen
sive line," Hebert said. "They're
big, strong guys. They fire off t he
ball and punish defenses. It's a real
test for our front seven."
The USC quarterback poses
another problem. Robinson couldn't
decide between junior Brad Otton or
fifth-year senior Kyle Wachholtz, so
he uses them both.
Splitting time hasn't hurt pro
duction at all. Wachholtz leads the
Pac-10 in passing efficiency and
has thrown for six touchdowns.
Otton ranks third and has 10
touchdown tosses under his belt.
The quarterback combination
makes life for the Stanford defense
more difficult. It must come up
with a game plan to combat the
tendencies of not just one talented
passer, but two.
"Just in your mind set you have
to gear up for each athlete because
each one brings different talents to
the table," Willingham said.
The rotation also means that
each play-caller takes less of a
beating over the course of a game.
"It's sort of disappointing,"
Hebert said. "One of the joys as a
defensive lineman is to put a quar
terback on the floor so that by the
third or fourth quarter, he's tired
and beat up. With two, they're
probably more fresh."
The Trojan ground attack, tra
ditionally the team's offensive
strength, took a hit after the third
game of the year when the NCAA
announced that it would under
take an investigation of running
back Shawn Walters for allegedly

accepting money from an agent.
Walters has sat out of competi
tion since that time and his status
for Saturday's game remains uncer
tain. Sophomore Delon Washington
has played in Walters' absence,
rushing for 604 yards on 140 carries
to average 75.5 yards per game.
While Johnson, the quarter
back combo and the rest of the
Trojan offense have captured most
of the attention, the line play of
the USC defense has gone largely
unnoticed. USC ranks second in
the league in both rushing and
pass efficiency defense and holds
opponents to a mere 14.5 points
per game.
Though the defense fell off its
pace in the past two weeks, the
return of defensive end Israel
Ifeanyi from suspension and
linebacker Errick Herrin from
injury will definitely bolster the
Trojan's 5-2 front.
Tackles Matt Keneley and Dar
rell Russell are among the league
leaders in tackles-for-loss.
The Trojans go two deep at
every position in the secondary
without a drop-off in talent. Strong
safety Sammy Knight, free safeties
Micah Phillips and Jesse Davis and
cornerbacks Brian Kelly, Daylon
McCutcheon and Quincy Harrison
will cause problems for Stanford
quarterback Mark Butterfield and
his receivers.
"We have to give them the
respect a great team deserves,"
Parks said. "They're one of the
better defensive fronts we've faced
all year."
Stanford may compete without
the services of freshman running
back Anthony Bookman, who
bruised some ribs against the
Beavers.
"Anyone who is in that band
for more than a year must be
psychologically damaged," said
Cardinal senior linebacker Mike
Hall, referring to the USC
band's propensity to repeat the
same song over and over again.
Trojan band members won't
be the only ones going crazy,
however, when Stanford (5-2-1
overall, 3-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) travels south to the Los
Angeles Coliseum to collide with
14th-ranked USC (6-1-1, 4-0-1)
at 12:30 p.m. tomorrow.
It's Homecoming Weekend
for the Trojans and the atmo
sphere, already pumped-up with
tradition, horses and repetitive
songs, will be doubly charged.
"It's like a rallying thing for
us," said Cardinal senior nose
tackle John Hebert. "Our team
versus an entire stadium — I
really enjoy it. It's the best part
of playing football."
The contest also carries great
weight for both squads.
"This really is a big-time col
lege game for both teams," said
senior offensive tackle Nathan
Parks. "What you do in Novem
ber determines almost every
thing."
USC sits in the driver's seat
for the Pac-10's Rose Howl berth
after securing a last-second tit

However, stumbling against the
Cardinal would once again throw
the conference championship up
for grabs.
Meanwhile, Stanford still
remains a bubble team in terms
of postseason positioning. Upset
ting the Trojans in L.A. would gc;
a long way towards ensuring
that the Cardinal is still playing
football come the end of 1995.
"As I told my football team
[before the OSU game], there's
one sure way we can get into a
bowl," said head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "That's to win al
four games I left, in the schedule]
Anything less than that and it's
a maybe."

USC is no longer the jugger
naut it appeared to be when the
season began. Dropping a 38-10
decision to Notre Dame two
weeks ago knocked the Trojans
out of contention for the nation
al title. Last Saturday, it looked
as if the team's Rose Bowl
dreams might come to an end as
well when the Huskies took a 21-
0 lead into the fourth quarter.
However, USC came alive in the
final 15 minutes to salvage the
tie.

sentiments. "I don't think you stop
a player as good as he is," Robinson
said. "Maybe you go out and get
Deion Sanders or something."
The Cardinal will employ a vari
ety of strategies to control the gift
ed Johnson.
"We'll attack him," said junior
free safety Josh Madscn. "We'll
use some man-to-man, we'll run
some blitzes. You don't want to
just sit back and hope."
While Johnson's presence will
cause the secondary considerable
stress, it also places pressure on
the defensive line. Stanford's front
four must make sure that the Tro
jan quarterback doesn't have
enough time to find his go-to-guy.
"There's definitely a sense of
urgency to get in there and mess
things up," Hebert said.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
USC features a formidable group
of offensive linemen, including

heavyweights like center Jeremy
Hogue (6-foot-4, 285 pounds),
right guard Phalen Pounds (6-
foot-7, 310) and right tackle Nor
berto Garrido (6-foot-7, 325).
"I'm impressed with their offen
sive line," Hebert said. "They're
big, strong guys. They fire off t he
ball and punish defenses. It's a real
test for our front seven."
The USC quarterback poses
another problem. Robinson couldn't
decide between junior Brad Otton or
fifth-year senior Kyle Wachholtz, so
he uses them both.
Splitting time hasn't hurt pro
duction at all. Wachholtz leads the
Pac-10 in passing efficiency and
has thrown for six touchdowns.
Otton ranks third and has 10
touchdown tosses under his belt.
The quarterback combination
makes life for the Stanford defense
more difficult. It must come up
with a game plan to combat the
tendencies of not just one talented
passer, but two.
"Just in your mind set you have
to gear up for each athlete because
each one brings different talents to
the table," Willingham said.
The rotation also means that
each play-caller takes less of a
beating over the course of a game.
"It's sort of disappointing,"
Hebert said. "One of the joys as a
defensive lineman is to put a quar
terback on the floor so that by the
third or fourth quarter, he's tired
and beat up. With two, they're
probably more fresh."
The Trojan ground attack, tra
ditionally the team's offensive
strength, took a hit after the third
game of the year when the NCAA
announced that it would under
take an investigation of running
back Shawn Walters for allegedly

accepting money from an agent.
Walters has sat out of competi
tion since that time and his status
for Saturday's game remains uncer
tain. Sophomore Delon Washington
has played in Walters' absence,
rushing for 604 yards on 140 carries
to average 75.5 yards per game.
While Johnson, the quarter
back combo and the rest of the
Trojan offense have captured most
of the attention, the line play of
the USC defense has gone largely
unnoticed. USC ranks second in
the league in both rushing and
pass efficiency defense and holds
opponents to a mere 14.5 points
per game.
Though the defense fell off its
pace in the past two weeks, the
return of defensive end Israel
Ifeanyi from suspension and
linebacker Errick Herrin from
injury will definitely bolster the
Trojan's 5-2 front.
Tackles Matt Keneley and Dar
rell Russell are among the league
leaders in tackles-for-loss.
The Trojans go two deep at
every position in the secondary
without a drop-off in talent. Strong
safety Sammy Knight, free safeties
Micah Phillips and Jesse Davis and
cornerbacks Brian Kelly, Daylon
McCutcheon and Quincy Harrison
will cause problems for Stanford
quarterback Mark Butterfield and
his receivers.
"We have to give them the
respect a great team deserves,"
Parks said. "They're one of the
better defensive fronts we've faced
all year."
Stanford may compete without
the services of freshman running
back Anthony Bookman, who
bruised some ribs against the
Beavers.
