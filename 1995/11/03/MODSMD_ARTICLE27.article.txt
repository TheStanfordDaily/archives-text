# Women's volleyball looks for 18th and 19th versus the Huskies and Cougars
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
In what could turn out as its two most
challenging matches of the season, the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball team will take
on red-hot Washington (10-7 overall, 5-7
Pacific 10 Conference) and No. 9 Washing
ton State (17-3, 9-3) this weekend at Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinal (20-2, 13-0) hold a com
manding three-game lead over the Cougars
in the Pac-10. With two wins this weekend,
Stanford would clinch its second consecu
tive conference title.
"It's nice to get to 20 (wins]," said Stan
ford coach Don Shaw. "We're on a bit of a
roll. We hammered some tough Arizona
teams llast weekend in Arizona] and played
well against Pacific [Halloween night). But
this weekend will be tough."
Tonight's 7 p.m. matchup features a
Huskies squad that has recovered from a

disastrous four-match losing streak that
effectively eliminated Washington from
Pac-10 title contention. Considering that
Pac-10 coaches predicted Washington to fin
ish third in the conference, the Huskies
have found this year's results extremely dis
appointing.
"They've had some really tough injuries
and haven't really been at full strength that
much this year," Shaw said.
Shaw was quick to point out, however,
that Washington is now healthy and playing
outstanding volleyball. "They're finally
playing like the team picked to finish third
in the conference," he said. "They're
healthy and they're confident. They're one
of those teams that has the talent to beat
any team in the nation."
Although the Huskies have performed
well of late, Stanford has been on a roll since
the sixth game of the season. The Cardinal

has now won 17 straight matches,
six of thorn against teams ranked in
the top 17 in the nation, and has
not lost at home since a five-game
setback to then-No. 1 UCIJ\ early
in the 1993 season.
Recently, Stanford's success has
come from improved passing. Earli

er thus season, Stanford struggled
with its passing and, as a result,
faced limited choices with its
offense. With a resurgent passing
attack, the entire offense has
opened up for sophomore
setter / outside hitter Lisa Sharpley
and senior setter / outside hitter
Can' Wendell.
Sharpley's game in particular
has really taken oil". Against Ari
zona State last Friday, the 6-footer
from Los Altos registered an amaz

ing .706 hitting percentage, finish
ing with 13 kills in just 17 attempts.
The next night against Arizona, she
hit .500 and recorded 10 kills. For
her efforts, Sharpley earned Pac-10
Player of the Week honors.
Tomorrow's match at features
the second-place Cougars. Washing
ton State junior middle blocker
Sarah Silvernail leads the Pac-10 in
kills and is the only player in the con
ference to be named Pac-10 Player of
the Week twice.

"Both teams are very confi
dent," Shaw said. "They're playing
well against a conference that's
really tough from top to bottom."
Though impressed with his
team's recent execution, Shaw sees
room for improvement in one vital
aspect of his team's performance at
home — support from the Maples
Pavilion crowd. Shaw was particu
larly disappointed that only 900
people watched Stanford thrash
No. 15 Pacific on Halloween.

"It's weird to see a match against
[arch-rival] Pacific with such a
small crowd," Shaw said. "And why
doesn't the band show up?"
The Stanford band, which is
famous for firing up Maples Pavil
ion student sections, has been con
spicuously absent from several vol
ley ball matches this season.
Both matches will begin at 7:00
p.m., tonight night's match will be
