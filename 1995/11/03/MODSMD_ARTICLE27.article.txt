In what could turn out as its two most
challenging matches of the season, the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball team will take
on red-hot Washington (10-7 overall, 5-7
Pacific 10 Conference) and No. 9 Washing
ton State (17-3, 9-3) this weekend at Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinal (20-2, 13-0) hold a com
manding three-game lead over the Cougars
in the Pac-10. With two wins this weekend,
Stanford would clinch its second consecu
tive conference title.
"It's nice to get to 20 (wins]," said Stan
ford coach Don Shaw. "We're on a bit of a
roll. We hammered some tough Arizona
teams llast weekend in Arizona] and played
well against Pacific [Halloween night). But
this weekend will be tough."
Tonight's 7 p.m. matchup features a
Huskies squad that has recovered from a

disastrous four-match losing streak that
effectively eliminated Washington from
Pac-10 title contention. Considering that
Pac-10 coaches predicted Washington to fin
ish third in the conference, the Huskies
have found this year's results extremely dis
appointing.
"They've had some really tough injuries
and haven't really been at full strength that
much this year," Shaw said.
Shaw was quick to point out, however,
that Washington is now healthy and playing
outstanding volleyball. "They're finally
playing like the team picked to finish third
in the conference," he said. "They're
healthy and they're confident. They're one
of those teams that has the talent to beat
any team in the nation."
Although the Huskies have performed
well of late, Stanford has been on a roll since
the sixth game of the season. The Cardinal
