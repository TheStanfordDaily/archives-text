The suspense certainly didn't last long
yesterday afternoon at Harry Maloney
Field — one minute, 45 seconds to be
exact. That's all the time it took for the
Stanford women's soccer team (15-3 over
all, 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference) to get on
the scoreboard. The Cardinal then went
on to rack up seven first-half goals, three
from freshman forward Kelly Adamson,
in an 8-0 mauling of Cal State-Sacramen
to (3-16).
Junior forward Erin Martin staked the
women to a 1-0 lead less than two minutes
into the match when she headed a perfect
ly-placed cross kick from sophomore Rita
Hermiz past Sacramento State goalie
Dawn Anderson. After senior defender
Jessica Fischer made the score 2-0, Adam
son ran off three goals in a span of nine
minutes to put the game out of reach.

"I just got lucky," said Adamson of the
hat trick. "They were great services in the
box, and I was in the right place at the
right time."
Adamson has been struggling to regain
some type of scoring groove ever since she
scored both Stanford goals in the season
opening shutout of Pacific. Her three
goals yesterday equaled her goal-scoring
output from the team's previous 16
matches combined.
"It was great for her confidence," said
head coach lan Sawyers. "She's been
struggling a little bit recently with finish
ing, so it was nice for her to get those
three. It would have been nice to get a cou
ple more with the two [missed second
half] chances that she had, but you can't
grumble when you score eight."
Adamson wasn't the only one in on the
act yesterday. Hermiz and Martin con
tributed a goal and two assists apiece,
while freshman Becka Livermore and
senior Meredith Larson each connected
for their first goals of the season. Defen
sively, freshmen goalkeepers Erin Bryla
and Lisa Brooks combined for the team's
11th shutout of the season.
