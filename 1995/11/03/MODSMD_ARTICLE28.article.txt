The suspense certainly didn't last long
yesterday afternoon at Harry Maloney
Field — one minute, 45 seconds to be
exact. That's all the time it took for the
Stanford women's soccer team (15-3 over
all, 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference) to get on
the scoreboard. The Cardinal then went
on to rack up seven first-half goals, three
from freshman forward Kelly Adamson,
in an 8-0 mauling of Cal State-Sacramen
to (3-16).
Junior forward Erin Martin staked the
women to a 1-0 lead less than two minutes
into the match when she headed a perfect
ly-placed cross kick from sophomore Rita
Hermiz past Sacramento State goalie
Dawn Anderson. After senior defender
Jessica Fischer made the score 2-0, Adam
son ran off three goals in a span of nine
minutes to put the game out of reach.

"I just got lucky," said Adamson of the
hat trick. "They were great services in the
box, and I was in the right place at the
right time."
Adamson has been struggling to regain
some type of scoring groove ever since she
scored both Stanford goals in the season
opening shutout of Pacific. Her three
goals yesterday equaled her goal-scoring
output from the team's previous 16
matches combined.
"It was great for her confidence," said
head coach lan Sawyers. "She's been
struggling a little bit recently with finish
ing, so it was nice for her to get those
three. It would have been nice to get a cou
ple more with the two [missed second
half] chances that she had, but you can't
grumble when you score eight."
Adamson wasn't the only one in on the
act yesterday. Hermiz and Martin con
tributed a goal and two assists apiece,
while freshman Becka Livermore and
senior Meredith Larson each connected
for their first goals of the season. Defen
sively, freshmen goalkeepers Erin Bryla
and Lisa Brooks combined for the team's
11th shutout of the season.

"I thought our kids did a great
job," Sawyers said. "We made some
really good tactical choices, getting
in behind the defense and breaking
them down, and our finishing was
really on target. The girls were cre
ating their own shooting opportu
nities and finishing them."
With the Hornets out of the
way, the women now turn their
attention to Arizona (6-9, 1-4).
Stanford will take on the Wildcats
in a 1 p.m. match Sunday after
noon.
"It's the last regular-season
game of the year," Sawyers said,
"so you know it's going to be an
emotional game. Hopefully, we'll
come out strong and try to get an
early (goal 1 again."
Christine Keeley leads Arizona
offensively with 25 points on 10
goals and five assists. Nikki Jones
— who recorded a hat trick of her
own in the Wildcats' 4-2 win over
Sacramento State last Sunday —
ranks second on the squad with 18
points on eight goals and two
assists. The two have combined for
75 percent of Arizona's total
offense this year.
Stanford will look to use Sunday's
match as a springboard for the
NCAA playoffs, which begin Nov. 11.
The 24-team field will be announced
Monday morning at 8 am.
"We're hoping to correct some
of the things that didn't go quite
well [yesterday 1 in the second
half," Sawyers said, "but the key
thing is to gain momentum going
into the postseason. We want to get
our players confident, get them
going up there [into the playoffs 1
with every possible idea of advanc
ing. Anything we can do to keep
momentum going is good."
