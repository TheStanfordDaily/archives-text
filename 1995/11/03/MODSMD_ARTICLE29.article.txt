Live from Stanford Univer
sity, where some hooks are
to be tasted, others swal
lowed, some digested and still
more spat out and vomited, it's a
mystical look at the weekend's
college football games. To help
me shore up my prognosticating
skills, I've summoned the help of
the Deja Vu Psychic Hotline.
Predicting the games with me
this week is "Joe." His real name
has been withheld at his request,
and if my picks keep stinking as
badly as they have the past few
weeks, I may decide to follow
suit.
This has always been a for
ward-looking column, one with a
keen eve on future events. Ix>t's

hope that vision is sharpened by a
little prediction-preaching from
an actual member of the profes
sion. So read on, and do so with
great haste â€” the cost for reading
what lies below is $3.95 per
minute. Must be 18 or older. For
entertainment purposes only.
Stanford at USC
Is there really much to say?
Cardinal visions of a bowl will no
doubt take another blow this
week in Los Angeles. There's just
too much Trojan defense to back
up a USC offense that is so good it
requires the combined efforts of
TWO top-notch quarterbacks. At
