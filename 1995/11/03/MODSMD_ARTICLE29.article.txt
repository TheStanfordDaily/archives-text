Live from Stanford Univer
sity, where some hooks are
to be tasted, others swal
lowed, some digested and still
more spat out and vomited, it's a
mystical look at the weekend's
college football games. To help
me shore up my prognosticating
skills, I've summoned the help of
the Deja Vu Psychic Hotline.
Predicting the games with me
this week is "Joe." His real name
has been withheld at his request,
and if my picks keep stinking as
badly as they have the past few
weeks, I may decide to follow
suit.
This has always been a for
ward-looking column, one with a
keen eve on future events. Ix>t's

hope that vision is sharpened by a
little prediction-preaching from
an actual member of the profes
sion. So read on, and do so with
great haste — the cost for reading
what lies below is $3.95 per
minute. Must be 18 or older. For
entertainment purposes only.
Stanford at USC
Is there really much to say?
Cardinal visions of a bowl will no
doubt take another blow this
week in Los Angeles. There's just
too much Trojan defense to back
up a USC offense that is so good it
requires the combined efforts of
TWO top-notch quarterbacks. At

" Joe "
least Stanford can rest easy
knowing that, if faced with the
choice of going for a tie or a victo
ry, USC coach John Robinson will
no doubt display absolutely no
backbone (again) and settle for
the tie.
"Joe" sees Stanford not scor
ing much — only around 10
points — but he says he saw a
bright light hovering around the
Cardinal.
I'd characterize that bright
light as that light seen by many
during near-death experiences.
My guess is that, by the time the
game comes to a conclusion, the
Cardinal will be as close to dead as
you can get on the scoreboard.
"Joe": Stanford by 1
Me: USC by 21
Oregon at Washington
The Ducks are flying in forma
tion into a whole heap of trouble.
The Huskies are coming off the
big Trojan comeback and have
their drooling chops ready to
devour whatever fowl stands
between them and a Rose Bowl
berth.
For the past two weeks, Ore
gon's rushing game has been as
graceful as its webbed-footed,
knock-kneed mascot. And we all
know that an Oregon quarterback
can't throw the ball to save his
soul.
"Joe" also sees a close outcome
in this contest. In fact, he doesn't
see the winning squad scoring
much more than a touchdown.

Oddly enough, I think I'll look
to the PAST to pick the winner of
this one. Oregon's in a skid and
Washington is on the rise. 1 guess
you don't need the gift of fore
sight to make a rational predic
tion. Which is fortunate, seeing
how my foresight is often clouded
with cataracts.
"Joe": Oregon by 2 or 3
Me: Washington by 7
Washington State at Cal
The Bears have the edge accord
ing to "Joe's" predictive itch. And
Washington State's
to Arizona certainly makes that
itch scratchable. But the rash that
has infested Cal this season isn't
going to heal anytime soon.
The Cougars, who were in the
hunt with Stanford for the Aloha
Bowl, have dropped three games
in a row and will only be playing
in the potato chip dip bowl in
their living rooms come New
Year's Day.
But bowl bids aside, WSU is
facing Division II caliber competi
tion this weekend in the Golden
Bears. They can just view the trip
as a weekend excursion to the San
Francisco Bay. Let me suggest a
team trip to Pier 39, a walk
through Ripley's Believe-it-or-
Not and an Alcatraz tour Satur
day morning before the game.
"Joe": Cal by I to 4
Me: WSU by 10
UCLA at Arizona State
The Sun Devils scorched the
combustible feathers of the Ore
gon Ducks last week, but the Bru
ins are bound to be a flame retar
dant bunch. UCLA has bowl

hopes riding on the outcome of
this game, while ASU will need a
few victories and a miracle that
makes Moses' exodus through the
Red Sea look like a stroll over a
backyard drainage ditch.
"Joe" likes ASU, with the
home field and momentum in its
favor. I like the Bruins, with the
talent and ability to rush. And
although the Sun Devils shut
down Oregon in the last half of
last week's game, they came into
that contest tanked dead last in
the conferend 1 in the three major
defensive categories.
If "Joe" thinks Arizona State
will win, he really must know
more about the future than I do.
He must know that Karim Abdul-
Jabbar and the UCLA offensive
line are going to drop dead before
the game Saturday. Otherwise,
there's no chance for another Sun
Devil surprise.
"Joe": Arizona State by 4
Me: UCLA by 6
Arizona at Oregon State
Beyond sensing the numbers
in favor of Arizona, "Joe" also
could sense rain in the Corvallis
forecast on Saturday. While it
doesn't exactly take a tenured
meteorologist to make such a
claim, the wetness could well hurt
the Wildcats. But my guess is that
the worst it can do is send them
back to the Southwest with runny
noses.
"Joe": Arizona by ?
Me: Arizona by 14
cumulative:
them: 16 for 26 (62%)
me: 18 for 26 (69%)
