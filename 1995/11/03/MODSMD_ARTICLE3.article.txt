# Forum mulls ethnic studies
## Scholars offer viewpoints on Stanford's curriculum plans 
### Jimmy Boogle 
Three prominent scholars of
comparative studies in race and
ethnicity discussed the history of
ethnic studies programs from
their beginnings to the present in
a forum last night in Jordan Hall,
both praising and criticizing Stan
ford's efforts to create an ethnic
studies program.
Included in the panel were Eve
lyn Hu-Dehart, professor of
Latin American history at the
University of Colorado; Michael
Omi, associate professor of Asian-
American studies at UC-Berkeley;
and Ella Habiba Shohat, associate
professor of women's and cultural
studies at the City University of
New York.
The panel, moderated bv Vice

X
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Ramon Saldivar, was the
first in a series of events this year
sponsored by the President's
Committee on Culture and Cul
tures.
Hu-Dehart discussed her be
ginnings in ethnic studies as a
Stanford undergraduate in the
late 19605. She said she went into
Latin American studies to focus
on a non-Eurocentric field.
"When we went into these area
studies, we began to change them"
and take a more ethnic, compara
tive approach, she said. "We began
way back then, almost 30 years
ago."
She discussed the problems
with those area studies, which
were largely linked, she said, to
the United States' ideas of imperi

alism.
"The original purpose (of
these area studies departments)
was to train specialists to up
hold U.S. hegemony in these
areas," she said, pointing out
that much of her schooling was
paid for by the U.S. Department
of Defense.
Omi, on the other hand, talked
about Berkeley's ethnic studies
program, which began in 1969.
"Ethnic studies was guided by a
specific paradigm: internal colo
nialism," he said, commenting on
how ethnic studies programs op
posed ethnic assimilation.
He also discussed how ethnic
studies programs are changing
today, and how they need to
change.
"We need to look at how wc

conceptualize race," he said,
explaining how terms of race
and ethnicity are often confused
and problematic. He also said a
"creative engagement" of stud
ies of race, gender and class is
needed, as the three areas are

often treated as mutually exclu
sive while they are not.
Shohat further discussed the
need for cross-departmental
linkage in ethnic studies. Stud
ies of race, gender and class
have "links that need to be

strengthened institutionally,"
she said, criticizing departmen
tally "ghettoized" courses in
these topics.
She also encouraged ethnic
studies programs to encourage
a more global "transnational"
approach, saying ethnic studies
is incorrectly seen as unique to
the United States.
Shohat said she was
"delighted to see Stanford's
commitment" toward develop
ing a Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity major,
which is scheduled to begin
next year.
However, Hu-Dehart was
not as delighted. She criticized
Stanford — as well as the rest
of academia — for emphasizing
ethnic studies programs over
ethnic studies departments.
She said it is "nearly impossi
ble" to build a program from
courses in other departments
and that these programs have
little power and are often
prone to budget cuts and elimi
nation.
"I would like to leave Stan
ford with one thought," Hu-
Dehart said. "Ethnic studies, in
order to survive and thrive,
needs to aspire and work
toward autonomy."
The three speakers will also
participate in a noontime dis
cussion today in History Corner
room 34.
