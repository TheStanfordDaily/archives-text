# Stanford to defend dynasty
## Wolters receives top bid as tennis squad heads to San Jose 
### Edward Guzman Contributing writer 
With one match under its belt along with a
month s worth of off-season conditioning, the top
ranked Stanford men's tennis team will continue
to sharpen its skills in the 50th annual NORCAL
Rolex Intercollegiate lennis Invitational Champi
onship at San Jose State this weekend.

Despite its off-season scheduling, the Rolex
competition is not without significance. Not only
can it help boost national rankings, but it is also a
qualifier for the Rolex Indoor Tournament in
February.
Head coach Dick Gould looks forward to the
event. "It's a great time for a tournament," he
said. "It will help [the players'J national rankings,
and it's the only tournament where every guy has
a chance to play."
The Cardinal has traditionally dominated the
Rolex contest. Past Stanford singles winners
include Roscoe Tanner (1970), present assistant
coach John Whitlinger (1974-75), Jeff Tarango
(1988) and Alex O'Brien (1989-90). The Cardinal
has also captured the past 25 unofficial team titles.
Stanford's performance last season at the Rolex
championship best exemplified its domination, as
current senior Jeff Salzenstein beat teammate
Scott Humphries in the singles final while the
doubles tandem of Humphries and current sopho
more Paul Goldstein knocked off current Cardinal
seniors Ricky Becker and Jim Thomas in the dou
bles final.
This year, Gould will send eight players to com
pete. They will all play singles as well as compose
four doubles teams. Freshman boy-wonder Ryan
Wolters is the top seed in the tournament. Given
that Wolters shook down the thunder by winning
the Indoor Tennis Association All-American
Championships in Austin, Texas, Gould is anxious
to see how Wolters will play. "He's still sort of on
a cloud," Gould said. "It'll be interesting to see
how he comes back."
Other seeded Cardinal players include third
seed Goldstein, fourth seed Thomas and junior
Grant Elliott, seeded seventh. Stanford also land
ed two of the top four doubles seeds. The team of
Goldstein-Thomas received the top seed while the
doubles pair of Elliott-Wolters will enter as the
third seed.
Matches will take place from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday at the Spartan
Courts. The singles title match will start at 1 p.m.
on Tuesday, followed by the doubles final.
"We're in good shape physically and we hope to
do a good job," Gould said. "It's a nice chance for
everyone to step up. We're ready to play a little
better, and the coaches are all anxious to see what
[the players] can do."
