### Brian Lee Staff writer 
In the world of big-time college
athletics, the concept of friendly
competition has become some
what anachronistic. However,
this weekend's Stanford Fall Invi
tational may prove to be a refresh
ing dose of nostalgia.
The Cardinal men's golf squad
will host a field of 16 teams this
weekend for a three-round, 54-
hole tournament. The event fea
tures highly competitive pro
grams from all over the nation.
The coaches of many of these
schools are good friends of Stan

ford head coach Wally Goodwin.
"It's going to be a great week
end," Goodwin said. "Everyone
knows each other and so it will be
a nice change to play in an envi
ronment where all the coaches are
friends."
Not that spectators should
expect any diminution in the qual
ity of play. A number of teams in
the field will be vying for NCAA
berths come spring and everyone
will participate with the intention
of winning.
"The rivalry will still be there,"
Goodwin said. "It will be more of a
friendly rivalry though."
This tournament holds partic

ular importance to the Cardinal
however, as it looks to improve on
a slow start this season. After
showing flashes of brilliance at
Northwestern in the season open
er, the team collapsed in the third
round of last week's Olympic Invi
tational in San Francisco, strag
gling to a sixth-place finish.
"We've looked pretty bad," said
freshman Joel Kribel. "We're all
just working really hard, trying
not to let it happen again.
Kribel and sophomore Ail-
American Tiger Woods headline
the Cardinal squad. Senior cap
tain Jerry Chang joins them to
form one of the strongest cores in
the country.
"The top three, when they're
on, can compete with anyone in
college golf," Goodwin said.
Freshman Scott Wang and
junior Conrad Ray complete the
squad. Wang earned a spot on the
starting five with a sparkling
tournament performance in Mon
terey, and Hay won the final spot
in a hard-fought team qualifier.
"The performance of our
fourth and fifth guys is really
important for us to win," Good
win said. "We have to produce in
those positions if .vant to stay
competitive."
The addition of Wang gives the
team a young look. Neither Wang
nor Kribel seems to be fazed
beyond the normal freshman con
cerns, however.
In addition to the starting five,
seniors Pete Ligotti, David Garcia
and Darren Dragovich and sopho
more Jake Poe will enter the field
as individual competitors.
"This should be a great oppor
tunity for the team to all sort of
play together," Goodwin said.
"It'll be good for all the guys to get
to compete against some strong
squads."
