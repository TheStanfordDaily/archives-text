# Laissez-faire ...

### 
Iwas taking the HER from Paris to Versailles
when I was linguistically jumped by a just
pubescent French youth.
"Boooooooonzhour," he crooned into my
once pristine ear, fondling my stirrup and anvil
with more carnal zest than Catherine the Great
in a petting zoo. "Boooooonzhour mon
amooooour."
Like a pre-teen Alicia Silverstone forced to
shop at Marshalls, 1 rolled my eyes and looked
away. But, alas, this fixed action pattern display
of rejection didn't phase him.
"Boooooooonzhour, ma petite," he contin
ued. licking his Nutella-smeared lips.
The youth quickly approached me, his gait
laden with lascivious intent. To avoid unwanted
flirtation, I had to act quickly. I jumped for my
purse and went straight for my only weapon: a
Random House French-English dictionary. It
gave me what I needed ... a testosterone
nulling. pseudo-Adonis-crushing insult to
bruise his libido. Enriched with the power of
bilingual male-directed ridicule, I declared:
"Laisse-moi tranquille. . . . C-c-cochon!"
I smiled at my noble exclamation, making a
mental Post-it that I had intentionally used the
derogatory "tu" form of the verb with this com
plete stranger, a rebellious act that would make
any French teacher convulse with conjugations.
But my words didn't deliver (Alas, the impo
tence of being earnest). Unphased, unbruised.
unhurt and uncastrated, the French youth con
tinued on his vector path straight for me. Des
perate. I grabbed my dictionary again for fur
t her assistance.
1 threw it at him.
"Adoraaaaaable." he smiled as he handed
the dictionary back to me.
Despite the fact that he and I were the only
passengers in our car, despite the fact that
there were over 20 other emptv seats available,

he grasped the opportunity to take a seat right
on my lap. Oppressed bv the weight of his ado
lescent body, the rank odor of his Mennen-free
pits and the warm backside of his Naf Naf jeans,
I was exponentially repulsed. I promptly
escaped from the sweaty realm underneath his
pimply derriere and stood above him. arms
akimbo . . ready to rant:
"Laisse-moi! Tu es, like, trop-"
"Zee words cannot dispoze of moi. -Je te
veux."
Upon realizing that the youth (like all noble
members of non-American culture) was bilin
gual, 1 continued quite emphatically: "Look,
buck-o I DON'T WANT YOU. You've offended
me. You've completely disgusted me. You're
foul, repugnant and smell like a Synergy party.
Leave me alone."
For 50 nano-seconds, he was completely
silent. Suddenly, bis upper lip began to quiver,
his face became flushed with a red No. 5 hue
and his eyes glistened salty.
"On crie, on sort, et e'est la mort." he mut
tered.
"Is that like a Vanessa Paradis song or some
thing?"
"Je suis mi idiot!'
"Yes, you are an idiot, but please stop crying.
I don't want you to turn into a Victor Hugo
novel on me right now."
I sat down next to the crumpled lump of a
14-year-old and proceeded to talk him out of
jumping off the train (I am a former Bridge
counselor, you know) and into better methods
of handling the opposite sex.
"You've got it all wrong, frenchie," I instruct
ed him as I handed him a hankie. "You can't
force flirting to a purpose beyond the aesthetic.
You're too direct in your approach. Don't force
yourself on women. That only invites rejection
as well as several sharp, piercing, and testicular

ly-threatening elbow jabs to the groin . .
"Zee tragedie!" he uttered in between hyper
ventilatorv gasps. "Zee tragedie!
"Instead, why don't you try to play up the
enigma. The mystery. The indirectness. Don't
throw your pheromones in her face. Don't
announce your squalid desires
"But women love it when I call zem rnon
amour, man tresor, man little ponie . . .
"And take off that stupid t-shirt. "
"But 1 will work for sex!"
"How old are you?"
"Fourteen."
"Tell me what's wrong with you
He told me about his bout with a few bottles
of laced Perrier a few years back and a certain
sojourn in Chernobyl but 1 didn't buy it How
ever, his Mickey Rourke fan club membership
did shed much clarity on his practice of full
frontal eros.
"Back then, you could get away with your lit
tle French piqk-up lines. But now, tu must grow
up and lose the in-your-face approaches.
Instead of saying i want to do the breaststroke
in your mucus, man amour,' leave a bird of par
adise on her doorstep. "
"C'est tout?"
"Of course not. That's only the first move in
a series of carefully engineered steps toward
successfu I seducti< >n."
Then the train finally came to a stop. I had
successfully made it to Versailles without a
drop of his saliva in my ear. Grabbing my
eurotrashed gear and proceeding to leave,
twas my time to make like a prom dress and
take off.
