# Message from a monoglot

### Jeremy Desmon International Correspondent Special to Diversions 
OXFORD, That Little Island
Off Europe (DIV) — Over the
Thames and through the wood, and
about another 10 hours by 747,
you'll find a strange-looking crew of
Cardinal(s). Stanford students who
flock each quarter to this medieval
(hut don't call it quaint) little town
of Oxford. And now, 1 would like to
give you a glimpse of the life of a stu
dent in the Stanford-in-Oxford Pro
gram.
The origins of such a program
are not difficult to appreciate. Pic
ture two drunken professors hang
ing out in History Corner one
night with darts and a map of the
world: "How about sending 'em to
(hiccup) Afghanistan? STANford
in AfghaniSTAN, right? Heh-heh!"
"Nah man, how about Stan-
FORD in OxFORD, get it?"
"No. I don't. But I could use
some more Absolut."
Or so the story goes.
And we all know the type who
takes this three-month hiatus
from Northern California. They
all: 1. are fuzzy, yet not too fuzzy;

2. rush to declare English the
night before the application is due;
3. feel that "exploring oneself
through the eyes of another cul
ture" is a "worthwhile experi
ence"; and 4. were too lazy to get
off their asses and learn another
language. (Of course, they do know
"Would you like to sleep with me?"
in 15 languages and think it's a
cool icebreaker at parties.) So
these 51 wacky Americans pull
themselves out of the Draw and
head for the land where Shake
speare is served by the barrel and
beer is served by the pint.
These monoglots, however, may
find more than just Coors Light at
the end of the Chunnel. They've
thrown on their long, dark, woolen
overcoats, pulled out their umbrel
lae and tried to work the word
"wanker" into a sentence, but
somehow it just doesn't work. They
go to pubs (bars) with other blokes,
chaps or mates (guys, guys or
guys), say splendid (cool) and bril
liant (rockin') and awesome (awe
some — this one's American) and
they eat their crisps (chips) and
their chips (fries), smoke a fag or
two (Marlboro), then go home, fall
on their bum (both left and right

buttock combined) and puke in the
100 lie toilette). But somewhere,
somehow, they were spotted as
Americans. Loud, obnoxious, red
white-and-blue, culture-exporting,
over-consuming bloody Yanks.
Is it the accent? The clothes?
The way that the phrase "Damn
Brits'' seems to slip into every con
versation? We try to fit in . . . yet as
hard as we do, we come home as
American and un-Britishized as
ever. And we remain proud of the
fact that "two hundred years ago
in that little war thing we fought,
my great-great-great-great-great
grandaddy kicked your great
great-great-great -great-gra ndad
dy's bum."
So I guess the moral of the story
is to be true to yourself. I've
learned that different is not always
a bad thing. Just because your
paper money looks like something
out of a cereal box, or you butcher
the hell out of a language that
Americans made famous or even if
you couldn't make a decent plate
of nachos if your measly little
Anglo-life depended on it, it
wouldn't mean you were worth
less. Just "different."
Damn Brits.
