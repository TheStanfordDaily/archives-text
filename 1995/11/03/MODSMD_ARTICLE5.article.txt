## 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
Lying down in the middle of White Plaza, pre
tending to be dead, members of Students
Against Genocide (SAGE) protested the arrival

of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the
United States for peace talks yesterday.
At the protest, speakers urged students to get
involved by helping educate other students,
writing letters to politicians and working with
humanitarian outreach programs that tutor

refugees and help with food and clothing drives.
To educate Stanford students about the on
going war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, representa
tives from SAGE spoke about ethnic cleansing,
set up an information table and a showed a film
about the war. SAGE also provided letters to
President Clinton and California Sens. Barbara
Boxer and Dianne Feinstcin for students who
wanted to take an active part in protesting Milo
sevic's visit.
SAGE is a student group started in 1992 in
response to the Bosnian war and is part of a larg
er group of university organizations around the
United States, Canada, Australia .and Europe
that works to bring peace to Bosnia and end
genocide. SAGE has also sponsored several
other protests at Stanford in the last three
years.
About 10 SAGE members spoke and partici
pated in the demonstration, with about 30 more
students observing and others riding through
White Plaza to stop by to talk to representatives
and watch the film at the information table.
"There are three things that we are demon
strating for today," said graduate student Sheri
Fink, president of the Students Against Geno
cide Coalition, a national umbrella group that
includes SAGE.
"There are issues that we think need to be
brought out. First, we don't want Bosnia to get
partitioned — that would reward genocide. Sec
ond, we want to see the war criminals brought to

justice. Third, we are protesting
the U.S. government's decision
to bring Slobodan Milosevic here
for peace talks," she said.
SAGE president Tin Gazivo
da, a junior, said he hoped yes
terday's demonstration made
Stanford students aware of the
greater implications of ethnic
cleansing in Bosnia.
"I am involved in this stuff for
personal reasons," Gazivoda said.
"I'm from Zagreb, Croatia, and 1
have relatives and friends back
there. I feel like I couldn't just be
here and not care. I think the
principle of tolerance is extreme
ly important.

"The implications of this are
really great and raise serious con
cerns," Gazivoda added. "It's not
just about one individual nation.
A lot of people are confused and
don't understand what's going on
in Bosnia. It's simple. This is a
war about Serbian aggression.
Human lives are being thrown
away and a people's existence is
being threatened."
Protesters cited U.N. reports
which stated that at least
200,000 people have been killed
in the war in Bosnia. Demon
strators feel that people don't
understand what that number
means.
"It's important for people to
begin seeing the numbers as peo
ple," said freshman Emira Tufo.
"The statistics are so imperson
al. Those numbers are people

with names and lives, and they
are actually going and went
through all that horrible things
people read about. I left Sarajevo
a year ago to come here and get
an education so I can contribute
something to my country, if
there is a country for me to go
back to."
SAGE plans to bring Bernard
Henir Levi's "Bosna," a docu
mentary about the war to Stan
ford later this month, and also to
speak in dorms in an attempt to
get more students involved.
"I think things today went
really well," Fink said. "A lot of
people stopped by even just to
read the signs. It's the most
interest I've seen in Bosnia in a
while. A lot of people signed let
ters and got information. It's
really heartening."
