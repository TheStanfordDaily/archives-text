Lying down in the middle of White Plaza, pre
tending to be dead, members of Students
Against Genocide (SAGE) protested the arrival

of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the
United States for peace talks yesterday.
At the protest, speakers urged students to get
involved by helping educate other students,
writing letters to politicians and working with
humanitarian outreach programs that tutor

refugees and help with food and clothing drives.
To educate Stanford students about the on

set up an information table and a showed a film
about the war. SAGE also provided letters to
President Clinton and California Sens. Barbara

wanted to take an active part in protesting Milo

SAGE is a student group started in 1992 in

other protests at Stanford in the last three

brought out. First, we don't want Bosnia to get
