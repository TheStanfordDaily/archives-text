## Earth Sciences will venture off dry land

Hoping to expand its base of
research, the School of Earth Sci
ences has developed the Ocean
Margins Initiative, aimed at
broadening the school's research
work and teaching in the study of
oceanic and atmospheric sci
ences.
The new program, which calls
for the addition of three new facul
ty members for the department,
will also provide the school with
opportunities for collaboration
with scientists outside of the Uni
versity.
Franklin Orr, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, empha
sized the importance of the project
and described it as a good opportu
nity to "investigate the geological
and biological effects [of oceanic
activity) on the edges of conti
nents."
Orr said the work is relevant
because it will study the climate

changes of the ocean in detail to
help researchers understand
how those changes affect dry
land.
He added that it is an attempt

to study the rea
sons for these
changes over
time — both in
the ocean and in
the offshore sedi
ment — and to
explain these
changes by read
ing the geological
record left in the
ocean and in the

gases found in the earth's crust.
"It is hoped that in reading the
ocean's past and understanding
how the changes in the ocean
came about," Orr said, "they will
be able to see how the ocean devel
ops in the future."
The program also allows for
