## Earth Sciences will venture off dry land

Hoping to expand its base of
research, the School of Earth Sci
ences has developed the Ocean
Margins Initiative, aimed at
broadening the school's research
work and teaching in the study of
oceanic and atmospheric sci
ences.
The new program, which calls
for the addition of three new facul
ty members for the department,
will also provide the school with
opportunities for collaboration
with scientists outside of the Uni
versity.
Franklin Orr, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, empha
sized the importance of the project
and described it as a good opportu
nity to "investigate the geological
and biological effects [of oceanic
activity) on the edges of conti
nents."
Orr said the work is relevant
because it will study the climate

changes of the ocean in detail to
help researchers understand
how those changes affect dry
land.
He added that it is an attempt

to study the rea
sons for these
changes over
time — both in
the ocean and in
the offshore sedi
ment — and to
explain these
changes by read
ing the geological
record left in the
ocean and in the

gases found in the earth's crust.
"It is hoped that in reading the
ocean's past and understanding
how the changes in the ocean
came about," Orr said, "they will
be able to see how the ocean devel
ops in the future."
The program also allows for

collaboration between the school
and scientific institutions such as
the U.S. Geological Survey and the
Monterey Buy Aquarium Research
Institute (MBARI) for shared
research and information, as well
as better educational opportunities
for all involved in the program.
A report issued by a visiting
committee last year found the
school to be lacking in "some
important areas of research in the
geological sciences" and presented
the school with a challenge to
expand its horizons and incorpo
rate an expanded base of research
that would fit in with the Univer
sity's initiative in the environmen
tal sciences.
"This program is the response
to that challenge," stated Jonathan
Roughgarden, a professor of bio

logical sciences and geophysics and
director of the new prognun.
"This scientific study of the
oceans will encompass so many
sub-disciplines of earth science
and will undoubtedly move (the
school) toward its overall objec
tive, namely to move the School of
Earth Sciences into the ocean
from our strongest point, the solid
earth," he said.
The initiative officially begins
this fall with a search for three
new faculty members who special
ize in oceanography or related
fields to head up oceanic research
and teach new courses on oceanic
studies which will be incorporated
into the school's already extant
geosphere track.
Though the school does not
plan to add a specific major in
oceanography, Orr said, "the
school will be able to offer more
depth in other majors and offer
new areas of concentration" relat
ed to ocean studies.

"The caliber of the research and
teaching in this field really
depends upon the faculty hired,"
Roughgarden said. Hiring will not
occur until next fall.
The future of the program is
hazy, as the school is still trying to
establish a definite timetable.
Though other plans for coopera
tion with other schools and scien
tific institutions are still uncer
tain, the program is set to work
closely with MBARI in terms of
research opportunities.
"We see a lot of chance for coop
eration with [MBARI]," said
Roughgarden, "and we're consult
ing with them a lot as we go, hop
ing to establish some key bonds
with them."
Orr added that the program is
really trying to establish links not
only with MBARI but also with
Hopkins Marine Station. Working
with those institutions is the best
way to "offer real opportunities in
ocean research," he said.
