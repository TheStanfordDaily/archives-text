# Symposium to examine debatable ethics of gene research

A campus symposium this
weekend will examine controver
sies surrounding the Human
Genome Project's efforts to deci
pher the genetic code.
The symposium, which begins
today, will focus on the interac
tion of scientific and public cul
tures, tackling such topics as the
Human Genome Diversity Pro
ject, the study of the breast cancer
gene and the theory of the "gay
gene."
The project is a large scale
effort to put together a complete
composite map of the human
genetic code. The findings have
already impacted medical technol
ogy through advances in the
understanding of how certain
genes contribute to disease.
However, according to Law

Prof. Henry Greely, the project
does not take into account the
enormous amount of genetic
diversity in the world.
"Most of the people who have
given genetic samples for analysis
by the Human Genome Project
have been of North American and
Western European descent,"
Greely said. "Genomic variations
are often common to ethnic
groups. With this research, we
will only know whether a particu
lar [genetic] sequence is common
among only Europeans, not the
other 80 percent of the popula
tion."
A possible solution to this prob
lem is to analyze the genetic con
tent of a larger number of popula
tions to get a better overall pic
ture if the makeup of the human
genome. The Human Genome
Diversity Project, in which Greely
is involved, intends to sample 500

distinct populations of people
around the world over five to
seven years.
The project, Greely said, will
attempt to provide genetic clues
about disease and will hopefully
help answer more fundamental
questions about the shared ances
try of human beings.
"Anthropology is really our
first priority," Greely said. "What
we want is to get a better sense of
the genetics of our overall
species."
Similarities in the genes of dif
ferent ethnic groups could lead to
information on where human life
began and on early human migra
tion patterns, Greely said.
Under current plans, pilot
studies for the project are slated to
receive funding next year from the
National Science Foundation.
However, Greely isn't overly opti
mistic, saying, "We live in hope,

but nobody knows what is going to
happen with the budget."
The project is also running
into trouble with populations
who are prospective genetic
donors to the project, according
to symposium organizer Joan
Fujimura, an associate professor
of anthropology.
"Some people object to this
project on cultural and religious
grounds," Fujimura said, refer
ring to a reluctance to give blood
and cell samples. "Another prob
lem is the question of privacy.
People are nervous about the idea
that this information about them
is going to be stored in data banks
and might not be secure."
Yet another concern is the mis
trust of the goals and outcomes of
the project; more than 100 Native
American tribes have come out
against the project. This was one
reason that Fujimura put the

symposium together.
"It's meant to be a public edu
cational event with people on both
sides of the issue," said Fujimura.
Fujimura said she herself has
some reservations about the pro
ject.
"We have to understand that
this is a First World project,"
Fujimura said. "Many countries
are going to be worried about the
basic necessities of life more than
about this project."
"Scientists need to be aware of
the cultural and ethical ramifica
tions of the work that they are
doing," Fujimura said. She said
she hopes the symposium will
raise awareness of difficult issues
raised by genetic research.
Research involving genetic
explanations for human behavior
can be highly emotional and con
troversial. At the symposium,
Genetics Prof. Neil Risch will dis

cuss the implications of prior
studies of genetic and behavioral
connections.
"What I am interested in is
what the public believes has been
determined by these studies,"
Risch said, referring to the large
number of articles in the lay press
discussing the finding of a so-called
"gay gene."
"There has been no gene found
that has been shown to influence
sexual orientation," Risch said.
"The two studies done were with
small sample sizes of 40 and 30
people, but all the same the phras
ing 'gay gene' sounds very deter
ministic."
"We need to educate people on
the findings," Risch added. "Part
of the problem is that people no
longer know what to believe."
The panel begins today at
Tresidder and will conclude
tomorrow at Kresge Auditorium.
