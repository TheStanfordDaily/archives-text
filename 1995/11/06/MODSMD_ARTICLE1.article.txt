How information technology
will change the engineering fields
is be one of the most critical issues
Computer Science and Electrical
Engineering Prof. John Hen
nessy will face when he takes over
as dean of the School of Engineer
ing at the end of the academic
year.
"Our big challenge is enhanc
ing education and research and
how information technology is
going to change research and

teaching at uni
versities," he
said. "We've got
to grab that bull
by the horns and
infuse informa
tion technology
into teaching,
since engineer
ing students will
need to use that
technology on a
daily basis."

Hennessy was selected by


Hennessy
Provost Condoleezza Kice last
week to succeed current Dean and
Electrical Engineering Prof. James
Gibbons, who is stepping down to
assume the position of special
counsel to the president and
provost for industry relations.
Hennessy said he was pleased
to be appointed to the position, but
added that he realizes the respon
sibilities facing him in the new job.
"I'm honored," he said. "It's a
challenge . . . given the accom
plishments that previous deans
before me have achieved."
An extensive national search
involving 70 nominations and
applications was conducted to find
Gibbons' replacement. Hennessy's
academic and industrial reputa
tion were cited as mj\jor factors in
his selection.
Gibbons spoke highly of his
successor, emphasizing Hen
nessy's expertise in computer
information and technology as
very important for the engineer
ing departments.
"The last four deans in the
School of Engineering have been
people that worked on the 'hard
ware' aspect, which has been and
continues to be an extremely
important thing for us," he said.
"However, one of the things that
John brings to this is [that] he is in
the field of computer information
and technology.
"It's time for a leader who has
grown up in that era with those
instincts," Gibbons added. "That
sort of individual htis to have risen
through the academic ranks
recently. The field is developing
rapidly, and having someone with
his currency is important."
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Ron Hanson, who also serves as
chair of that department, said he
admires Hennessy's commitment
to all aspects of engineering in the
academic environment.
"I personally like the fact that
he shows a strong commitment to
both teaching and research," Han
son said. "We need to put more
pressure on the University to pay
more attention to undergraduate
instruction, and he supports
that."
Hennessy said he is aware of
concerns about federal cutbacks in
research funding and plans to

work to prevent any funding
shortage in the School of Engi
neering.
"The Engineering School is
leveraged heavily in federal
funds," he said. "We need to make
sure that we're competitive for the
federal funding that remains.
"However, we also want to
enhance our program so we're
not so vulnerable to such cuts,"
he added. "We're looking to
industry and other means of sup
port in our fundraising efforts."
Hennessy received a bachelor's
degree in electrical engineering
from Villanova University in 1973.
He earned his master's and doc
toral degrees in 1975 and 1977,
respectively, at the State Universi
ty of New York in Stony Brook.
In September 1977, he joined
the electrical engineering and
computer science faculty at Stan
ford as part of the Computer Sys
tems Laboratory — a microproces
sor design lab — which he cur
rently directs. He was named the
Willard and Inez K. Bell Professor
of the School of Engineering in
1987 and holds a joint professor
ship in electrical engineering and
computer science. He has chaired
the Computer Science Depart
ment since 1994.
Hennessy has also received a
number of notable accolades,
including a 1984 National Science
Foundation Presidential Young
Investigator's Award. He is a
member of the National Academy
of Engineering, the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences and
the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers.
Hennessy's research interests
have centered around improving
computer microprocessor design
to enhance performance. In the
early 1980s, he initiated the MIPS
(microprocessor without interlock
pipe stages) project at Stanford,
which pioneered the development
of RISC (reduced instruction set
computing) architecture, an
approach now used by most com
puter manufacturers. He helped
to found MIPS Computer Sys
tems in 1984 while on sabbatical
leave.
Hennessy has also co-authored
two textbooks on computer archi
tecture — one for undergraduates
and another for graduate students
which have revolutionized how
the subject is taught in universi
ties across the nation.

research funding and plans to

work to prevent any funding
shortage in the School of Engi
neering.
"The Engineering School is
leveraged heavily in federal
funds," he said. "We need to make
sure that we're competitive for the
federal funding that remains.
"However, we also want to
enhance our program so we're
not so vulnerable to such cuts,"
he added. "We're looking to
industry and other means of sup
port in our fundraising efforts."
Hennessy received a bachelor's
degree in electrical engineering
from Villanova University in 1973.
He earned his master's and doc
toral degrees in 1975 and 1977,
respectively, at the State Universi
ty of New York in Stony Brook.
In September 1977, he joined
the electrical engineering and
computer science faculty at Stan
ford as part of the Computer Sys
tems Laboratory — a microproces
sor design lab — which he cur
rently directs. He was named the
Willard and Inez K. Bell Professor
of the School of Engineering in
1987 and holds a joint professor
ship in electrical engineering and
computer science. He has chaired
the Computer Science Depart
ment since 1994.
Hennessy has also received a
number of notable accolades,
including a 1984 National Science
Foundation Presidential Young
Investigator's Award. He is a
member of the National Academy
of Engineering, the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences and
the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers.
Hennessy's research interests
have centered around improving
computer microprocessor design
to enhance performance. In the
early 1980s, he initiated the MIPS
(microprocessor without interlock
pipe stages) project at Stanford,
which pioneered the development
of RISC (reduced instruction set
computing) architecture, an
approach now used by most com
puter manufacturers. He helped
to found MIPS Computer Sys
tems in 1984 while on sabbatical
leave.
Hennessy has also co-authored
two textbooks on computer archi
tecture — one for undergraduates
and another for graduate students
which have revolutionized how
the subject is taught in universi
ties across the nation.
