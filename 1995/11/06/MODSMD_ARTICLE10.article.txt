## Israeli Prime Minister killed by Jewish militant Over 40 leaders to attend funeral Thousands mourn Rabin's death 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — The funeral of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl cemetery
today Ls bringing together more than 40 heads of state,
from American and European presidents to Arab leaders
who joined the peace he died for.
The list includes President Clinton, Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia, Prime Minister John
Major of Britain, Prince Charles of Britain, President
Jacques Chirac of France and Germany's Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein
of Jordan have also said they would come.
Forty-two heads of state and prime ministers had
accepted invitations by yesterday evening, and the list
was growing steadily. The American guest list may be
longest, including former Presidents Carter and Bush,
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and two of his
predecessors, James Baker and Henry Kissinger.
For Israel, the Arab participation is particularly sig
nificant.
It was the first time Mubarak has agreed to visit Israel
since he came to power in 1981. It will also be King Hus
sein's first visit to Jerusalem as a guest of Israel.
The two Arab leaders have not visited the disputed
city, claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital. An
official visit to Jerusalem is seen by the Arab world as
recognition of the city as Israel's capital.
Rabin's most important peace partner, PLO chief
Yasser Arafat, said he would not attend, out of security
concerns. He was likely discouraged by Israel from join
ing the mourners, for fear his presence, still highly con
troversial in Israel, would set off protests.
Arafat has not visited Jerusalem since Palestinian
self-rule beg.m 18 months ago because his presence there
would aggravate the sensitive issue of sovereignty over
the city, which both Palestinians and Israelis claim as
their capital.
Morocco's King Hassan, who had intended to attend
the funeral, canceled his trip due to illness.
According to Jewish tradition, burial should take
place by the next sunset, but the prime minister's funer
al was delayed a day to allow world leaders to attend.
Rabin, a former army chief, will be buried with full
military honors in the section of the Mount Herzl ceme
tery reserved for prime ministers and other national
leaders. The coffin will be brought from parliament,
where it has been lying in state.
Between 5,000 and 6,000 people will attend the main
service on the esplanade in front of the tomb of Theodor
1 lerz.l, founder of the Zionist movement and visionary of
the modern Jewish state.

JERUSALEM (AP) - An end
less procession of Israelis, many
weeping, many bearing flowers,
silently filed past the simple
wooden coffin of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin yesterday. World
leaders were convening for a final
salute to the assassinated soldier,
statesman and man of peace.
Hundreds of thousands of
mourners came from all over the
shocked and saddened country to
a courtyard in front of the Israeli
parliament. The vigil was expect
ed to continue all night until the
start of a state funeral today
attended by dozens of world lead
ers, including President Clinton.
Under a bright, warm
Jerusalem sun, many Israelis
placed bouquets of flowers on
stone tiles near the flag-draped
coffin in which the 73-year-old
slain leader lay. Others saluted
the former army chief of staff
who became Israel's standard
bearer for peace.
"I feel that half the country
has died," high school student
Pini Cohen said as he and a group
of friends huddled and lighted
candles in parliament's courtyard
on a hill overlooking Jerusalem.

Rabin's assassination at a pro
peace rally in Tel Aviv on Satur
day night stunned a nation that,
despite increasingly bitter divi
sions over peacemaking with the
Arabs, had somehow denied that
such violence could happen to
them.
The suspect, Yigal Amir, a 27-
year-old law student with links to
the Jewish extremist fringe, told
interrogators he wanted to stop
Rabin's peace policies.
Rabin's death raised immedi
ate questions about the future of
Middle East peacemaking, espe
cially the Israel-PLO autonomy
agreement on the withdrawal of
Israeli troops from most West
Bank towns and villages by the
end of the year.
Some delays were possible as
Rabin's successor, Shimon Peres,
puts together a caretaker govern
ment.
Dubbed "Mr. Security," Rabin
was the one politician Israelis
trusted to take the risks involved
along the rocky path toward peace.
Israel's first native-born prime
minister, he fought in the Jewish
underground in Palestine and rose
to become Israel's military chief of

staff before entering politics.
His peacemaking with the PLO
earned him the 1994 Nobel Peace
Prize, along with Peres and PLO
chief Yasser Arafat. But the polit
ical climate had turned unprece
dentedly venomous in recent
months over the planned West
Bank withdrawal, and Rabin
became the target of increasing
vitriol by Israel's right wing,
which called him a traitor and
compared him to a Nazi.
A stunned nation tried to come
to grips with the killing yester
day. "Rabin Murdered, Israel is
hurting and crying," read the
headline in the Yediot Ahronot
newspaper.
Tens of thousands stood silent
ly yesterday at the site of the
assassination. A sea of memorial
candles, bouquets, handwritten
prayers and Rabin photographs
covered the spot where the prime
minister was shot. A sign in
Hebrew read, "Why?"
"Rabin was looking to the
future. He was looking out for us,
the younger generation," said
Amir Shavir, an 18-year-old from
Tel Aviv. "They killed him. They
killed my hope."

Hundreds of thousands of
mourners came from all over the
shocked and saddened country to
a courtyard in front of the Israeli
parliament. The vigil was expect
ed to continue all night until the
start of a state funeral today
attended by dozens of world lead
ers, including President Clinton.
Under a bright, warm
Jerusalem sun, many Israelis
placed bouquets of flowers on
stone tiles near the flag-draped
coffin in which the 73-year-old
slain leader lay. Others saluted
the former army chief of staff
who became Israel's standard
bearer for peace.
"I feel that half the country
has died," high school student
Pini Cohen said as he and a group
of friends huddled and lighted
candles in parliament's courtyard
on a hill overlooking Jerusalem.

Rabin's assassination at a pro
peace rally in Tel Aviv on Satur
day night stunned a nation that,
despite increasingly bitter divi
sions over peacemaking with the
Arabs, had somehow denied that
such violence could happen to
them.
The suspect, Yigal Amir, a 27-
year-old law student with links to
the Jewish extremist fringe, told
interrogators he wanted to stop
Rabin's peace policies.
Rabin's death raised immedi
ate questions about the future of
Middle East peacemaking, espe
cially the Israel-PLO autonomy
agreement on the withdrawal of
Israeli troops from most West
Bank towns and villages by the
end of the year.
Some delays were possible as
Rabin's successor, Shimon Peres,
puts together a caretaker govern
ment.
Dubbed "Mr. Security," Rabin
was the one politician Israelis
trusted to take the risks involved
along the rocky path toward peace.
Israel's first native-born prime
minister, he fought in the Jewish
underground in Palestine and rose
to become Israel's military chief of

staff before entering politics.
His peacemaking with the PLO
earned him the 1994 Nobel Peace
Prize, along with Peres and PLO
chief Yasser Arafat. But the polit
ical climate had turned unprece
dentedly venomous in recent
months over the planned West
Bank withdrawal, and Rabin
became the target of increasing
vitriol by Israel's right wing,
which called him a traitor and
compared him to a Nazi.
A stunned nation tried to come
to grips with the killing yester
day. "Rabin Murdered, Israel is
hurting and crying," read the
headline in the Yediot Ahronot
newspaper.
Tens of thousands stood silent
ly yesterday at the site of the
assassination. A sea of memorial
candles, bouquets, handwritten
prayers and Rabin photographs
covered the spot where the prime
minister was shot. A sign in
Hebrew read, "Why?"
"Rabin was looking to the
future. He was looking out for us,
the younger generation," said
Amir Shavir, an 18-year-old from
Tel Aviv. "They killed him. They
killed my hope."

JERUSALEM (AP) — The funeral of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl cemetery
today Ls bringing together more than 40 heads of state,
from American and European presidents to Arab leaders
who joined the peace he died for.
The list includes President Clinton, Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia, Prime Minister John
Major of Britain, Prince Charles of Britain, President
Jacques Chirac of France and Germany's Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein
of Jordan have also said they would come.
Forty-two heads of state and prime ministers had
accepted invitations by yesterday evening, and the list
was growing steadily. The American guest list may be
longest, including former Presidents Carter and Bush,
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and two of his
predecessors, James Baker and Henry Kissinger.
For Israel, the Arab participation is particularly sig
nificant.
It was the first time Mubarak has agreed to visit Israel
since he came to power in 1981. It will also be King Hus
sein's first visit to Jerusalem as a guest of Israel.
The two Arab leaders have not visited the disputed
city, claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital. An
official visit to Jerusalem is seen by the Arab world as
recognition of the city as Israel's capital.
Rabin's most important peace partner, PLO chief
Yasser Arafat, said he would not attend, out of security
concerns. He was likely discouraged by Israel from join
ing the mourners, for fear his presence, still highly con
troversial in Israel, would set off protests.
Arafat has not visited Jerusalem since Palestinian
self-rule beg.m 18 months ago because his presence there
would aggravate the sensitive issue of sovereignty over
the city, which both Palestinians and Israelis claim as
their capital.
Morocco's King Hassan, who had intended to attend
the funeral, canceled his trip due to illness.
According to Jewish tradition, burial should take
place by the next sunset, but the prime minister's funer
al was delayed a day to allow world leaders to attend.
Rabin, a former army chief, will be buried with full
military honors in the section of the Mount Herzl ceme
tery reserved for prime ministers and other national
leaders. The coffin will be brought from parliament,
where it has been lying in state.
Between 5,000 and 6,000 people will attend the main
service on the esplanade in front of the tomb of Theodor
1 lerz.l, founder of the Zionist movement and visionary of
the modern Jewish state.

JERUSALEM (AP) - An end
