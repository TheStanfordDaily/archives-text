JERUSALEM (AP) — How could it
happen?
No country puts more emphasis on
security than Israel. The Shin Bet secret
service built an enviable reputation for
protecting its leaders and preventing
terrorist attacks.
Security broke down, however, when
bodyguards apparently mistook a young
law student for a VIP driver and let him
get close enough to shoot Prime Minis
ter Yitzhak Rabin with a 9mm Beretta.
It's not as if there wasn't ample warn
ing that an attack might come from
Israel's religious right-wing. The suspect
had links to right-wing extremists.
In recent weeks, angry debate over

the future of the West Bank spilled into
the streets with right-wingers heckling
Rabin at public appearances, calling him
a "murderer," "Nazi" and "traitor."
Yossi Melman, an expert on intelli
gence, said security was "a total failure
because the handwriting has been on
the Weill for the past month."
Gideon Ezrach, former deputy head
of the Shin Bet, said he thought that
when Rabin was in the Arab West Bank
town of Nablus, his bodyguards were
"more psychologically alert" than they
were in lei Aviv.
"I also think that we all did not
believe that such a thing could happen,"
said Ezrach.

The security instead focused on
Palestinian militants, especially Islamic
extremists who had threatened to get
even for Hahin's reported decision to
order the recent execution of the Islam
ic Jihad leader Fathi Shakaki in Malta.
An official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Rabin refused to wear a
bulletproof vest. Melman said the Shin
Bet should have insisted that he wear
one and that the shots might not have
been fatal if he had.
But Ehud Sprinzak, a professor of
political science at Hebrew University,
said Rabin would have refused to wear a
vest anyway.
"We are talking about a very old sol

dier who went through all kinds of dan
gers in his life. He did not consider an
assassination a serious danger," said
Sprinzak.
Israeli experts said the 27-year-old
law student who confessed to the assas
sination, Yigal Amir, fit almost exactly
the Shin Bet's profile for an attacker —
a fringe activist with no record of violent
behavior.
Among the books found in Amir's
room was"Day of the Jackal," a novel
about the attempted assassination of
French President Charles de Gaulle, and
a book about Baruch Goldstein, the Jew
ish settler who killed 29 Muslim wor
shipers in Hebron in February 1994.
