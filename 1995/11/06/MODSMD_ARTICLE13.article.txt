## Editorial No on measure R 
### 
Stanford and Palo Alto
would pay heavy price
to send wrong message

WHILE EVERYONE seems
to be looking forward to
the 1996 election already,
local residents should be concen
trating on tomorrow's vote.
This year's Palo Alto ballot
includes Measure R, an anti
growth initiative that, if passed,
would negatively affect Stanford
University and all other major
businesses in Palo Alto. In con
trast, the benefits of the measure
are small.
Measure R would fix Palo Alto's
non-residential zoning limits,
approved in 1989, for 20 more
years. The power to rezone any
area to allow development would be
removed from the city government.
New projects could only move
ahead after a citywide vote on the
issue.
Current zoning would allow for
about 2.6 million square feet of
non-residential expansion. Already,
however, 4.8 million square feet of
development has been proposed for
consideration in the city's Compre
hensive Plan for zoning that is now
being drafted. That means two mil
lion square feet of potential devel
opment would be stopped by the
measure.
But the issue is not just a ques
tion of faceless numbers. Right
now, several major projects would
be damaged by Measure R, includ
ing proposals to expand the Stan
ford Shopping Center and develop a
hotel and conference center on
Stanford property at Page Mill
Road and El Camino Real.
Opponents of the measure point
out that a "yes" vote would halt
further expansion of Stanford's
Research Park and the Medical
Center. For these reasons, the Uni
versity donated a survey worth
$18,000 to the fight against the

proposition.
Measure R would not just hurt
Stanford, though. Indeed, one of
the worst things about the proposal
is that it would lock in a plan —
already six years old — for two
decades. No one can claim to know
what sort of commercial opportuni
ties might appear for Palo Alto
between now and 2015. Measure R
would at best hinder the advances
and at worst prevent them.
Measure R would also capri
ciously rob local government of one
of its most important duties, that of
mediating between the interests of
the public and of private property
owners.
Yet if Measure R's proponents
are willing to pass up better shop
ping, better business and better
medical care, the plan must provide
strong benefits. In fact, however it
does not. The biggest claims in
favor of Measure R seem to be that
it would ease traffic and parking
difficulties in Palo Alto, helping to
maintain a "small-town" feel.
To rectify these problems by
threatening two decades worth of
potential progress is to put the cart
before the horse. What the city
needs is more construction —
specifically, a better road network
and a few more parking garages —
not a stop to development that
might expand local economic and
cultural life.
Does this threaten Palo Alto's
atmosphere? Certainly, it might
change the town's ambiance. Then
again, Palo Alto is not known for its
scenic or pastoral beauty now. It
has grown past the Woodside phase
of small-town charm into a major
suburban area. Rejecting Measure
R will give Palo Alto the chance to
continue to grow into a much more
vibrant and interesting city
No one wants a Palo Alto mega
lopolis. But to crush many poten
tially wonderful advances simply to
avoid the normal processes of civic
government is ridiculous. Everyone
registered in Palo Alto should vote
against Measure R tomorrow. Let
society progress and make Palo
Alto's City Council do its iob.
