FRI students outraged at Dean Shaven \s decision

HOW MUCH DO you think your
tuition will rise if Stanford
makes a regular habit of closing
down departments that earn net rev
enues for the University? If this sounds
like a ridiculous question, you should
consider posing it to John Shoven, dean
of humanities and sciences. He recently
decided that the Food Research Institute
(FRI) should be shut down and convert
ed to a non-degree-granting center.
The initial reason given for an evalua
tion of FRI was a budgetary concern, but
when it was demonstrated that FRI in
fact makes the University about $1 mil
lion every year, we were told that the
budget wasn't the issue. At the same
time, Dean Shoven tells Stanford that
language programs must be streamlined
and minimum section sizes must be
increased for budgetary reasons. There
seems to be an inconsistency there.
Many of you might ask, "What is
FRI?" Usually, when we tell people
we're getting our M.A. or Ph.D. degrees
at the Food Research Institute, the
response is something like, "Oh, genetic
engineering must be interesting," or
"So, do you guys test how long it takes
to boil an egg?" At FRI, we study inter
national development policy and the eco
nomics of development, with attention
to the food and commodity sectors cru
cial to most developing economies. Our
program focuses on applied economic
research, based on fieldwork in develop
ing countries, which sharply distinguish
es it from the economics department.
In short, FRI trains people to com-

bine cutting-edge development theory
with rigorous empirical work to find
solutions to the problems of hunger,
poverty and development. With this
training, our graduates end up working
in top positions in universities and gov
ernments, multilateral institutions such
as the World Bank and the United
Nations and international research cen
ters throughout the world.
So why would Dean Shoven want to
close down this department? He asserts
that FRI does not meet the standards of
a "great university" like Stanford. A
1994 evaluation of the Institute conclud
ed that FRI is a high-quality program,
and getting even better with the restruc
turing of the master's program. The
advisory committee which conducted a
review of FRI for Dean Shoven also
agreed that the Ph.D. program is of high
quality, as is the M.A. program. These
evaluations are confirmed by the general
high regard in which FRI is held in the
international development community
and other agricultural economics depart
ments both in and outside the U.S. So,
despite the fact that FRI is a top-ranking
program and earns money for Stanford,
the dean feels that it is not worth having
around. He would have us believe that a
department dedicated to international
development issues is a redundancy at
Stanford.
Why should you care if FRI disap
pears as a department? Aside from the
principles and precedents implicit in the
dismantling of a successful program,
there will be fewer development courses

taught at Stanford. Many undergradu
ates have taken Population and Develop
ment, World Food Economy, Economic
Development in Africa, Development in
Greater China or any of various other
courses at FRI. Numerous international
relations and human biology people find
that FRI offerings for the economics
component of their majors are preferable
to those in the econ department, not to
mention that anyone in any major that
wants to focus on international develop
ment ends up taking a number of FRI
courses.
If FRI is converted to a research cen
ter without departmental status, the
high-quality faculty currently teaching
these courses will leave the University
and seek positions elsewhere. It could
take years for Stanford to rebuild any
kind of coherent development curricu
lum. Additionally, FRI offers a unique
co-terminal opportunity to undergradu
ates from all majors. The survival of this
co-terminal option depends on the exis
tence of FRI as a department with a
Ph.D. program.
From a variety of quarters at Stan
ford, we hear statements regarding the
international character and orientation
of Stanford University. FRI embodies
that commitment, with a high ratio of
international students, faculty and dis
sertation work in countries all over the
globe and a research and teaching pro
gram which focuses on the developing
world. Furthermore, the careers of FRI
graduates are dedicated to international
development. Closing this department

down would hardly be consistent with
Stanford's "internationalism."
The students at FRI reject this deci
sion for additional reasons of our own.
We came to FRI despite offers from
other top-ranked economics programs
because we believe this program is the
best at what it does. We believe in FRl's
approach to studying development, the
quality of the faculty and the value of
the education FRI offers. The synergy of
a small department where all faculty and
students are committed to applied
approaches to international development
cannot be duplicated by a research cen
ter and does not exist in the economics
department. Without FRI, Stanford
would not be able to offer us and those
that share our values and interests an
opportunity to study international devel
opment with the success currently
enjoyed by this program.
In sum, then, the situation is this: At
the same time that the University reaf
firms its commitment to an internation
al orientation and goes through drastic
budgetary measures, Dean Shoven has
decided to close a highly international
department that makes money. This in
and of itself is puzzling, and more so
considering the many merits of FRI as a
department, both for Stanford and the
world community. Finally, if FRI is shut
down on the basis of such meager justifi
cation, one question immediately arises:
"Which department is next?"
