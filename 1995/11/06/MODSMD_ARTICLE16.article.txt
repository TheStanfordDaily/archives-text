## Digtial communication 
### 
TODAY, I WOULD like to discuss dig
ital communication in our lives. You
know, the finger.
I can't remember when I first learned
how to give someone the bird — it was so
long ago. I'm pretty sure 1 knew how to
give it before I was born because I remem
ber giving it to the doctor who was pulling
me out of the womb and getting slapped in
the face. Since then, I have learned a lot
about giving Mr. Digit Finger-Puppet.
There is a certain etiquette that goes
along with honoring someone with half of
the peace sign. These are just a few genor
al rules you learn through experience:
1. The "Double Barrel Bird," where you
aim both middle fingers at someone, is
immature.
2. Never flip someone off who is driving a
car while you are riding a bike. Cars are
bigger and faster. Trust me.
3. I believe the "fist method" (make a fist
minus a certain finger) is better than the
"curling method" (the palm is vertical with
the unimportant fingers curled at the
king's side).
4. The finger is not a good pick-up line.
5. Don't overuse the bird or it loses its
power.
0. Never give the finger to someone with a
life-size tattoo of a lawnmower on his back,
no matter what. You only make that mis
take once.
The only other thing that should be

mentioned here is that I believe everyone,
sometime in his or her life, needs to go to
the top of a large land mark in a large city
and see what it is like to give the one-fin
ger-salute to over a million people at one
time. It's a very self-gratifying experience.
I honored over a million French people
from the Eiffel Tower with it.
I would say the finger is used most often
on this country's roads and freeways. If
you have never received it from someone
while driving, you have never driven. And
if you have never given it, you will probably
wind up climbing up a bell tower with a
high-powered rifle or becoming a postal
employee.
I remember when I first learned to
drive, the bird was a wonderful, new-found
pleasure. I would give it to anyone for the
usual moving violations (e.g. cutting me
off, driving too slowly, etc.); anyone I knew
with the exception of my parents, of
course — to anyone whom I just felt like
doing it to and anytime I believed I could
get away with doing so. However, after
having a few psychos chase you for half an
hour or so, you learn to discriminate a lit
tle better between who gets the finger and
who doesn't. In other words, you begin to
forgive large groups of fat, hairy men rid
ing Harley-Davidsons for going too slowly.
Now, I seldom have a good reason to
give someone the finger, but when I do, it
really feels great. Last week I had one of

those opportunities. I was stopped at a left
turn light behind someone in a new Toyota
sedan with darkened rear windows and a
license plate frame that said, "CAL
BERKELEY." So, to prove my school spir
it, after we made the turn, I jumped along
side this Toyota, slowed down to the same
speed and aimed my five-inch finger oflove
at some unsuspecting Cal supporter. I
didn't really get to enjoy the experience as
much as I would have liked because I
couldn't tell if the old lady driving the Toy
ota saw me — on account of those damn
wrap-around sunglasses — and I think the
old guy in the passenger seat was dead any
way. Nonetheless, it felt good.
There is one thing that I have always
wondered about regarding the bird: Is it
slang in sign language? Translated into
English, it is, but my sign language is a lit
tle rusty. All I really know is the finger,
waving and how to say, "Be quiet or you
will wake my roommate and his goat."
Regardless, I have always considered it the
most important, or at least useful, phrase
in sign language. But, then again, who
doesn't?

Mr. McCullough would like to dedicate
this column to all those funny little boyi
and girls over at The Stanford Review.
