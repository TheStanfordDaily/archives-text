# Measured expansion: Stanford's development through the years
##

Stanford land. I he plan immedi
ately got under way and the Stan
ford Shopping Center — which
now covers 70 acres — celebrated
its grand opening in the spring of
1956.
The Stanford Industrial Park,
now known as Stanford Research
Park, opened in 1951. The busi
ness center was comprised of
such leading industrial firms and
research laboratories as Hewlett-
Packard, Varian Associates,
Lockheed Missiles & Space Com
pany and Xerox.
Everyone seemingly benefited.
"The city would be able to estab
lish a significant tax base, the
University could ensure a good
cash flow from pre-paid leases,
and it provided an attractive site
for research facilities," said
Steven Staiger, historian for the
Palo Alto Historical Association.
In building these commercial
centers, the city annexed the
lands from Stanford, thereby
establishing a solid tax base.
"That revenue has played a major
role in Palo Alto's success and
affluence," said Doty.
Today, the Stanford Shopping
Center and Stanford Research
Park generate $30 million a year
in sales, property and utility
taxes for the city of Palo Alto,
according to Andy Coe, director
of community relations for Stan
ford.
An expanding rift
"This whole area burgeoned
after World War II," said Doty.
The area virtually doubled in
population in the decade follow
ing the war. Towns in the area
expanded into cities that now
seem to meld together at their
borders.
"It was a time before the envi
ronmental movement, before
concern for traffic," he said. But
those times would change rapid
ly.
The mutual development "was
fine and dandy for many years —
until Palo Alto started to feel the
University had gone too far, that
it developed too much land for
commercial purposes," Doty said.
By the late 19505, a group of
residents suspicious of the impli
cations of further commercial
development on the quality of
Palo Alto life emerged to counter

Palo Alto's city council, which
usually gave the go-ahead to such
proposals.
Palo Alto resident Ellen
Wyman explained that even into
the 19605, the city council was
"largely made of Realtors,
lawyers and businessmen."
The conflict that "bifurcated"
the area came in 1962. Residents
voted on a Santa Clara County
proposal to widen the congested,
two-lane Oregon Avenue. The
measure was aimed to remedy
the increased traffic flowing

The pendulum has
swung back to pro
expansion. But it's
nowhere near where
it once was in
encouraging
growth.'

through the Industrial Park and
surrounding community.
The plan passed, creating the
Oregon Expressway. "One might
say that the developers won that
particular battle," said Reider,
also a Palo Alto resident.
Wyman said the measure
"asked people not if they wanted
it, but how they wanted to pay for
it." The presumption that resi
dents would accept the measure
so inflamed the community that
the "residentialists" set out to
win city council seats and to pass
measures to preserve the city's
residential interests.
"For the last 30 to 40 years,
the issue between the University
and city regarding Stanford lands
has been, first, the extent to
which lands within the city
should be developed, and second
ly, how substantial should
growth on campus be," said Ken
Schreiber, Palo Alto director of
planning and community envi
ronment.
To many Palo Alto residents,
congested streets are key
reminders of the sometimes neg

ative impact of further develop
ment. Traffic concerns prompted
a 1989 study on Citywide Land
Use and Transportation spon
sored by the City. The study
noted that traffic conditions in
Palo Alto are already poor, and
projected that the situation
would worsen even if new devel
opment were to be prohibited. It
stated that Palo Alto's streets
and utilities could not support
growth at the then-existing lev
els.
The council voted unanimous
ly to adopt zoning provisions
which decreased the extent to
which non-residential land could
be commercially developed.
Wyman said, however, that in
recent years, council members
have often yielded to mounting
pressure from developers to push
those limits.
Tomorrow's vote on Measure
R will try to counter this latest
trend. Palo Alto residents advo
cating Measure R "are simply
saying, let's continue those lim
its," said Wyman.
A swinging pendulum
The history of the conflict may
be seen as a pendulum swinging
between the pro-expansionary
forces and Palo Alto residents'
resistance to growth, suggested
Doty. "The pendulum has swung
back to pro-expansion. But it's
nowhere near where it once was
in encouraging growth," he said.
Until the mid-19605, Palo Alto
and Stanford worked together to
create a viable economic commu
nity. Ironically, the intimacy of
this relationship may be the
cause of the tensions that have
led up to tomorrow's vote.
"Complications were bound to
arise as land-use issues became
increasingly controversial," said
Reider.
Regardless of the result of this
week's vote, those tensions are
likely to persist into the next cen
tury. Without commercial devel
opment, University officials con
tend, Stanford might not be able
to make ends meet.
"The University constantly
has to re-energize itself to make
sure it can support its academic
vision," said Coe. "Because real
ly, that is the whole purpose of
I using] commercial properties."
