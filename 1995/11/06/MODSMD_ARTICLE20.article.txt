## Football almost slays Trojans, falls in last minute Bowl hopes dim with Cardinal in four-way tie for fourth

Keyshav/n Johnson, USC's star
receiver, caught only four passes for 69
yards, his worst outing since his first
appearance in a Trojan uniform. But he
made sure that the few balls he did snag
made a big difference.
Johnson's eight-yard touchdown
reception from quarterback Kyle Wach
holtz with 39 seconds remaining gave
USC (7-1-1 overall, 5-0-1 Pacific 10
Conference) a wild 31-30 triumph over
Stanford (5-3-1, 3-3) last Saturday. The
game-winning grab came just moments
after he had made a catch for a 32-yard
gain.
"Like every great athlete, his team
needed him to step up and he did," said
junior Cardinal cornerback Leroy
Pruitt. "That's why he's an Ail-Ameri
can."
Because USC's attempt at a two
point conversion failed, the Cardinal
could still pull out a victory with a field
goal. With time a precious commodity,
senior quarterback Mark Butterfield,
who went 29 of 47 for 345 yards, tried to
move Stanford quickly downfield. But
the Cardinal's last-ditch effort to pull
down the walls of Troy would end at
midfield.
"All we needed was a field goal," said
senior wide receiver Mark Harris, who
caught 10 passes for 187 yards. "With
the way Eric [Abrams] is kicking, if we
had gotten within 50 yards, (the field

goal] would've been automatic."
Instead, Stanford was stranded at its
own 47-yard line with just three ticks
left on the clock. Butterfield's Hail
Mary attempt was batted down at the 1-
yard line by Johnson of all people, see
ing some time at defensive back because
of his 6-foot-4 height.
There was some confusion when it
appeared that Stanford senior receiver
Marlon Evans managed to come up with
the deflection. The referees correctly
ruled it as an incomplete pass as the ball
did hit the ground. However, even if the
officials had mistakenly ruled the play a
catch or if Evans had snagged the bat
ted ball before it touched grass, the Car
dinal wideout would have been ruled
down at the 1, short of the game-win
ning score.
"It bounced off the ground. I was
hoping for the deflection, but the ball
went straight down," Evans said. "I
tried to dive for it but couldn't get to it."
For the first time in 1995, Stanford
wound up holding the short end of the
stick in a game decided in the final
minute. The Cardinal was 3-0-1 in such
contests prior to Saturday's confronta
tion.
"When you lose in the manner we did,
it takes a lot out of you," said head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "It cuts deep."
Junior strong safety Eliel Swinton
echoed his coach's sentiment. "It hurts
more than you think," he said, "more
than you know, more than we're letting
on."
Stanford's defense tempted fate too
many times in the second half. Trailing
24-17, the Trojan offense, ineffective in
the first half, put running back Delon
Washington to work on its second drive
after the break. The Cardinal's inability
to slow down the ground attack, Stan
ford's Achilles' heel all year, proved

fatal in Troy.
Behind Washington, who on the day
amassed 144 yards on 22 carries, USC
moved to Stanford's 21. But a fumbled
snap, recovered by Stanford senior nose
tackle David Carder, ended the drive.
After regaining possession on their
own 9, the Trojans once again marched
down the field. A 30-yard reverse play
by Johnson left USC at the Stanford 20.
This time, Cardinal senior cornerback
Kwame Ellis stopped the Trojans by
stepping in front of receiver Billy Miller
and picking off a Wachholtz pass.
The third time proved to be the
charm for the Trojans. The traditional
bread-and-butter play, Student Body
Left, worked wonders. Rodney Sermons
eventually punched the football into the
end zone from the 1 and a two-point
conversion pass from Wachholtz to
Chris Miller gave USC its first lead of
the game, 25-24, with 7:18 left to play.
Stanford struck back quickly with an
80-yard drive highlighted by a 34-yard
catch by Harris. Junior fullback Greg
Cornelia put on the finishing touches
with a bullish six-yard TD run.
Willingham, hoping to lengthen the
lead to seven, decided to go for two.
Junior flanker Brian Manning, open in
the left part of the end zone, dropped
the pass.
"I should have caught it," Manning
said. "It was in my hands."
The four-minute scoring drive gave
the Trojans just enough time to deal
with the Stanford defense and score the
game-winner.
"They gave us the short stuff and we
happened to get the big play," Wach
holtz said. "When Keyshawn got the
ball over the middle, we were working
in the middle of the field and the next

read was to go to Keyshawn in
the end zone."
Although the Cardinal looked
weary during the final drive,
senior defensive tackle Pete
Swanson contended that fatigue
was not a factor. "We were all
right," he said. "It wasn't a mat
ter of running out of gas. They
did what they had to do and we
didn't. That's the bottom line."
Despite all the final-quarter
feats, the key play of the game
may have occurred at the end of
the first half. Down 24-10, USC
took possession with 2:45
remaining in the second quarter.
Given new life by a Stanford
defensive holding penalty on a
fourth-down play, the Trojans
took the ball to Stanford's 2. Then,
on second-and-goal with 26 sec
onds left, senior nose tackle John
Hebert broke through the offen
sive line and nailed Wachholtz for
what looked like a sack and a con
siderable loss. However, the Tro
jan quarterback threw the ball at
his feet as he fell and the officials
ailed it an incomplete pass.
The referees' decision not to
call Wachholtz "in the grasp" of
Hebert cost the Cardinal, consid
ering that the clock runs after a
sack. According to Hebert, the
officials should have at least
penalized Wachholtz for inten

tional grounding, which entails a
loss of yardage and a loss of down.
"(Wachholtz) was falling. He was
going down and he just threw the
ball down," he said. "That's
intentional grounding. I knew he
still had the ball (when he was
falling) because I could see it."
Willingham believed that
Wachholtz actually lost control
of the ball. "There was a fum
ble," he said. "I'll be disappoint
ed if anything else shows up."
Instead, USC kept the ball at
the 2 and scored on fourth down,
cutting the margin to seven as
the half expired.
The Stanford offense met with
considerable success in the first
half, jumping out to a 16-0 lead.
However, the team squandered
some opportunities inside USC's
20.
On the first drive of the game,
the Cardinal had first-and-10 at
the 16 but couldn't convert a first
down. Abrams kicked a 25-yard
field goal.
After the defense clamped
down on USC, sophomore Jeff
Allen blocked the punt and
sophomore Kadar Hamilton
recovered the ball at the 12. But
on third down, junior Mike
Mitchell couldn't hold onto a pass
and Abrams was once again called
onto the field.
"I was definitely disappoint
ed," Butterfield said. "We had the
ball on the 12 and had to settle for
a field goal."
Stanford receivers dropped six

catchable passes throughout the
game. "That's something you
can't do when you play a good
team," Willingham said.
After an interception by junior
Alistair White gave Stanford the
ball once again, Butterfield and
Co. showed a little bit of razzle
dazzle. The quarterback faked a
handoff to Mitchell, who faked a
handoff to Manning coming
through the backfield. Butter
field then threw deep to a wide
open Harris, who trotted into the
end zone for a 60-yard touch
down. It was the longest pass of
Butterfield's career and the
longest catch by Harris.
"They're a good secondary,"
Butterfield said. "They gave us
mainly the short stuff and we
took that and we got lucky with
the reverse. They really bit on the
reverse."
After Abrams added a 32-
yarder, Stanford's momentum
finally ebbed. Sophomore Damon
Dunn failed to field a punt, pin
ning the Cardinal offense at its
own 6. The team managed to get
some breathing room but muffed
a handoff on a second-and-two
play for a loss of six. A false start
dug the team a third-down hole
that it couldn't climb out of.
Finally, to cap off the disas
trous series, sophomore punter
Kevin Miller fumbled the snap
and was downed at the 9. The
Trojans took over and scored
their first points of the day on the
second play to make it 16-7.

How's that for opening up doors
for your enemies?
"That sequence cost us," Will
ingham said. "That changes the
game."
USC added an ugly field goal
by placekicker Adam Rendon and
Stanford finished off a 72-yard
drive with an Adam Salina touch
down to make the score 24-10,
setting up the Trojans' final drive
of the half.
The Trojan win coupled with
Washington's loss to Oregon vir
tually guarantees a USC berth in
the Rose Bowl. Head coach John
Robinson's team would have to
drop both of its remaining games
to fall out of the Rose Bowl.
The Trojan coach congratulat
ed both teams for playing
inspired football.
"Stanford played great foot
ball," Robinson said. "I told our
football team that I'm proud of
them as men. A game like this
asks something of them as men.
It asks something of Stanford.
You'll never forget being involved
in a game like this."
The Cardinal meanwhile drops
into a four-way tie with UCLA,
Arizona State and Arizona for
fourth place in the conference
and must win both of its final
games in order to keep its post
season hopes alive.
"We'll come back strong,"
Harris said. "A game like this —
it makes you hungry. We feel like
this was a ball game we should've
won."
