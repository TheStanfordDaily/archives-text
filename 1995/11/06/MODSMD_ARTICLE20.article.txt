## Football almost slays Trojans, falls in last minute Bowl hopes dim with Cardinal in four-way tie for fourth

Keyshav/n Johnson, USC's star
receiver, caught only four passes for 69
yards, his worst outing since his first
appearance in a Trojan uniform. But he
made sure that the few balls he did snag
made a big difference.
Johnson's eight-yard touchdown
reception from quarterback Kyle Wach
holtz with 39 seconds remaining gave
USC (7-1-1 overall, 5-0-1 Pacific 10
Conference) a wild 31-30 triumph over
Stanford (5-3-1, 3-3) last Saturday. The
game-winning grab came just moments
after he had made a catch for a 32-yard
gain.
"Like every great athlete, his team
needed him to step up and he did," said
junior Cardinal cornerback Leroy
Pruitt. "That's why he's an Ail-Ameri
can."
Because USC's attempt at a two
point conversion failed, the Cardinal
could still pull out a victory with a field
goal. With time a precious commodity,
senior quarterback Mark Butterfield,
who went 29 of 47 for 345 yards, tried to
move Stanford quickly downfield. But
the Cardinal's last-ditch effort to pull
down the walls of Troy would end at
midfield.
"All we needed was a field goal," said
senior wide receiver Mark Harris, who
caught 10 passes for 187 yards. "With
the way Eric [Abrams] is kicking, if we
had gotten within 50 yards, (the field

goal] would've been automatic."
Instead, Stanford was stranded at its
own 47-yard line with just three ticks
left on the clock. Butterfield's Hail
Mary attempt was batted down at the 1-
yard line by Johnson of all people, see
ing some time at defensive back because
of his 6-foot-4 height.
There was some confusion when it
appeared that Stanford senior receiver
Marlon Evans managed to come up with
the deflection. The referees correctly
ruled it as an incomplete pass as the ball
did hit the ground. However, even if the
officials had mistakenly ruled the play a
catch or if Evans had snagged the bat
ted ball before it touched grass, the Car
dinal wideout would have been ruled
down at the 1, short of the game-win
ning score.
"It bounced off the ground. I was
hoping for the deflection, but the ball
went straight down," Evans said. "I
tried to dive for it but couldn't get to it."
For the first time in 1995, Stanford
wound up holding the short end of the
stick in a game decided in the final
minute. The Cardinal was 3-0-1 in such
contests prior to Saturday's confronta
tion.
"When you lose in the manner we did,
it takes a lot out of you," said head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "It cuts deep."
Junior strong safety Eliel Swinton
echoed his coach's sentiment. "It hurts
more than you think," he said, "more
than you know, more than we're letting
on."
Stanford's defense tempted fate too
many times in the second half. Trailing
24-17, the Trojan offense, ineffective in
the first half, put running back Delon
Washington to work on its second drive
after the break. The Cardinal's inability
to slow down the ground attack, Stan
ford's Achilles' heel all year, proved

fatal in Troy.
Behind Washington, who on the day
amassed 144 yards on 22 carries, USC
moved to Stanford's 21. But a fumbled
snap, recovered by Stanford senior nose
tackle David Carder, ended the drive.
After regaining possession on their
own 9, the Trojans once again marched
down the field. A 30-yard reverse play
by Johnson left USC at the Stanford 20.
This time, Cardinal senior cornerback
Kwame Ellis stopped the Trojans by
stepping in front of receiver Billy Miller
and picking off a Wachholtz pass.
The third time proved to be the
charm for the Trojans. The traditional
bread-and-butter play, Student Body
Left, worked wonders. Rodney Sermons
eventually punched the football into the
end zone from the 1 and a two-point
conversion pass from Wachholtz to
Chris Miller gave USC its first lead of
the game, 25-24, with 7:18 left to play.
Stanford struck back quickly with an
80-yard drive highlighted by a 34-yard
catch by Harris. Junior fullback Greg
Cornelia put on the finishing touches
with a bullish six-yard TD run.
Willingham, hoping to lengthen the
lead to seven, decided to go for two.
Junior flanker Brian Manning, open in
the left part of the end zone, dropped
the pass.
"I should have caught it," Manning
said. "It was in my hands."
The four-minute scoring drive gave
the Trojans just enough time to deal
with the Stanford defense and score the
game-winner.
"They gave us the short stuff and we
happened to get the big play," Wach
holtz said. "When Keyshawn got the
ball over the middle, we were working
in the middle of the field and the next

Junior safety Eliel Swinton has Trojan quarterback Kyle Wachholtz firmly in his
grasp, but victory just eluded the Cardinal grasp Saturday.
