Southern California, the home
of the happiest place on earth, did
not provide any joy for the Stan
ford men's water polo team last
weekend. In fact, the No. 5 Cardi
nal (13-9, 2-6 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) was treated
downright rudely by hosts UCLA
and USC, losing games to both
squads.
"It was quite simply the road
trip from hell," said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti.
Westwood was the first desti
nation for the Cardinal, where it
faced off against the second
ranked Bruins. With memories of
a bitter loss to UCLA earlier in
the season, and still stinging from
a defeat at the hands of Long
Beach State the day before, the
Cardinal was set to play a tough
game. Indeed, the score was knot
ted 1-1 at the end of the first
quarter and stood at 3-3 by half
time.
In the third quarter, the Cardi
nal began to assert itself slightly,
taking a one-goal advantage into
the final period of play. In the
fourth quarter, Dettamanti's
squad appeared to take control of
the game. With the Cardinal lead
ing 8-6, junior two-meter man
Brian Wallin shoved in two con
secutive goals, extending his
team's lead to four points. Senior
Jeremy Laster appeared to ice the
game for the Cardinal when he
rifled in a shot to set the score at
11-7 in favor of Stanford with just
three minutes, 26 seconds
remaining.
But the Bruins never quit scrap
ping. After answering Laster's goal
seconds later with one of its own,
UCLA pulled to within 11-10 when
senior Mark Sutter launched a
two-point shot that narrowly evad
ed Cardinal senior goalie Jack
Bowen's grasp.
With momentum now in their
favor, the Bruins continued their
late surge, tying the game at 11
apiece. Finally, with 1:19 left to
play, UCLA captured the lead on
a goal from junior Corbin Gra
ham, capping a comeback that
was impressive for the Bruins and
demoralizing for the Cardinal.
"That loss against UCLA was

just devastating," Dettamanti
said. "There is no way that we
should have lost that game. It
would be similar to the football
team losing a game that they were
leading by two touchdowns with
two minutes to play."
The next day, the Cardinal,
bodies and egos bruised, made the
trip across town to play top
ranked USC. Perhaps indicating
what kind of day lay ahead, when
Dettamanti's players arrived at
the USC complex, they discovered
that due to a scheduling mistake,
they would have a half hour less
to warm up.
"I tried to build on the fact that
we had really played well against
UCLA except for the final few
minutes," Dettamanti said. "But
the guys were just a little tired
and depressed."
Indeed, it looked as though the
Trojans would make quick work
of the Cardinal as they cruised to
a 3-0 lead after one quarter. After
falling behind by four points,
Stanford finally notched its first
goal.
On the Trojans' next posses
sion, sophomore Mateo Juric
pulled up behind the two-point
line and uncorked a lob shot.
Bowen was caught slightly out of
position, and the ball floated into
the back of the net.
"That two-point shot just
broke our backs," Dettamanti
said. "It is almost impossible to
come back from a five-goal deficit
against the top-ranked team in
the country, especially when you
are at their pool. But the guys
kept battling."
Indeed, the Cardinal refused to
roll over and die. Goals by seniors
Dan Hancock and Josh Leachman
made the score 6-3 in favor of
USC. Juric and Laster then
exchanged goals before halftime,
making it a 7-4 game at the break.
After junior Marko Cizmic
began the third quarter with a
goal for USC, the Cardinal
climbed back to within two points
of the Trojans on successive goals
by seniors Brian Pyle and Daniel
Lehoczky.
With USC then leading by a
surmountable score of 8-6, Juric
struck again. Violating common
water polo protocol, the hard
throwing Trojan lofted yet anoth
er two-point shot, this time dur
ing a 6-on-5 situation. The shot
caught everyone by surprise and
deflected off the crossbar and into
the goal, giving the Trojans
another four-point advantage.
In the end, USC proved to be
too much. The Trojans went on to
win the game 13-9.
"It was a very tough road trip,"
