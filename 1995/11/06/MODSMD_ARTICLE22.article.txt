Two weeks remain in the Pacific 10
Conference women's volleyball season,
but the Stanford Cardinal has already
secured the league championship.
No. 4 Stanford (22-2, 15-0 Pac-10)
clinched its fourth conference title and
its first consecutive crowns as it routed
Washington (11-11, 6-8) and No. 9
Washington State (18-4, 10-4) in three
games apiece, posting its 19th straight
match victory and 18th consecutive
game win, Stanford's longest streak of
the year.
"I think it's always fun to just win for
the title," said senior outside hitter
Marnie Triefenbach. "If we can go 18-0
in the Pac-10, I think we'd be really
happy because that was one of our goals
for the year."
Stanford clinched the title earlier in
the season than ever before. Coach Don
Shaw stressed the significance of claim
ing the championship with two weeks
left. "Winning the Pac-10 is one of our
goals, so to get that out of the way, now

we can really focus in the next month on
just the NCAA tournament and not have
to battle down to the wire in a conference
race," he said.
On Saturday night, Stanford assured
that Washington State would not post
pone the inevitable title. The Cougars
succumbed 15-6, 15-7, 15-8 before a
vocal Maples Pavilion crowd of 1,900.
The Cougars had not dropped a match in
three since 1994 and pushed the Cardi
nal to the limit in the teams' earlier
meeting. But they never threatened
Stanford on Saturday as their lead over
third-place UCLA shrunk to one match.
The Cougar receiving and passing
game never resembled the form that lift
ed Washington State to top-10 status. As
a result, Washington State, which loves
to attack the middle quickly, was forced
to go outside early on. Stanford neutral
ized junior middle blocker Sarah Silver
nail, who had registered 325 kills and
was hitting .354, and sophomore middle
hitter Karen Oigman, who hit at a .368
clip entering the match. In game one, Sil
vernail recorded just two kills in four
attempts while Oigman committed two
errors without posting kills.
"In Sarah Silvernail, they have a
great hitter, so we basically concentrated
on trying to stop her," said sophomore
outside hitter Kristin Folkl. "I felt like
we came out pretty strong. Our passing
was all right and our serving was a lot
better than last night."
Meanwhile, Stanford spread the
