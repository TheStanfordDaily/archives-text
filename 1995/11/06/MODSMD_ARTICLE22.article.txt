Two weeks remain in the Pacific 10
Conference women's volleyball season,
but the Stanford Cardinal has already
secured the league championship.
No. 4 Stanford (22-2, 15-0 Pac-10)
clinched its fourth conference title and
its first consecutive crowns as it routed
Washington (11-11, 6-8) and No. 9
Washington State (18-4, 10-4) in three
games apiece, posting its 19th straight
match victory and 18th consecutive
game win, Stanford's longest streak of
the year.
"I think it's always fun to just win for
the title," said senior outside hitter
Marnie Triefenbach. "If we can go 18-0
in the Pac-10, I think we'd be really
happy because that was one of our goals
for the year."
Stanford clinched the title earlier in
the season than ever before. Coach Don
Shaw stressed the significance of claim
ing the championship with two weeks
left. "Winning the Pac-10 is one of our
goals, so to get that out of the way, now

we can really focus in the next month on
just the NCAA tournament and not have
to battle down to the wire in a conference
race," he said.
On Saturday night, Stanford assured
that Washington State would not post
pone the inevitable title. The Cougars
succumbed 15-6, 15-7, 15-8 before a
vocal Maples Pavilion crowd of 1,900.
The Cougars had not dropped a match in
three since 1994 and pushed the Cardi
nal to the limit in the teams' earlier
meeting. But they never threatened
Stanford on Saturday as their lead over
third-place UCLA shrunk to one match.
The Cougar receiving and passing
game never resembled the form that lift
ed Washington State to top-10 status. As
a result, Washington State, which loves
to attack the middle quickly, was forced
to go outside early on. Stanford neutral
ized junior middle blocker Sarah Silver
nail, who had registered 325 kills and
was hitting .354, and sophomore middle
hitter Karen Oigman, who hit at a .368
clip entering the match. In game one, Sil
vernail recorded just two kills in four
attempts while Oigman committed two
errors without posting kills.
"In Sarah Silvernail, they have a
great hitter, so we basically concentrated
on trying to stop her," said sophomore
outside hitter Kristin Folkl. "I felt like
we came out pretty strong. Our passing
was all right and our serving was a lot
better than last night."
Meanwhile, Stanford spread the

offense around, as four players had
three kills in the opener. In game
two, the Cardinal again jumped out
to an early lead. While Silvernail
and Oigman did become more
involved in the offense, all six Cardi
nal players frustrated the Cougars.
After the intermission, Stanford
seemed poised to wait/ to the Pac
-10 crown, but the Cougars closed to
11-8 and Shaw called a timeout.
The Cardinal then rolled oft four
straight points, appropriately wrap
ping up the match with a right-side
kill by all-evervthing Cary Wendell.
Stanford hit an impressive .336
for the contest against WSU, a te;un
that had held prior opponents to a
league-low .138. Sophomore setter/
outside hitter Lisa Sharpley posted
her second triple-double of the sea
son with 26 assists, 11 digs and 10
kills (with a .692 hitting percent
age). Senior outside hitter Wendy
Hromadka paced the Cardinal with
10 kills.
In the match against Washing
ton, Stanford appeared to have fall
en back into the first-game blues
that had plagued the Cardinal earli
er this year. The Huskies raced to a
10-1 lead as Stanford struggled with
both its serve and Washington's,
and Shaw called a key timeout.
"We made a slight adjustment in
our service-reception formation,"

Shaw said. "We moved a ample peo
ple just slightly, something that
made it a little harder for them to
serve the ball to who they wanted to
serve the ball to.
"Getting Miirnie in there, she's a
great passer and that definitely
steadied us out. She can cover a lot
of court."
Stanford outscored the Huskies
44-10 the rest of the way despite 15
service errors, winning 15-12, 15-1,
15-7.
The Husky hitting percentage
declined with each game and ended
at .082 while the Stanford machine
hit .339, including a .500 effort
with 18 kills from sophomore out
side hitter Kristin Folkl. Wendell
fell one kill short in her quest for a
ninth triple-double in 1995, posting
29 kills and 16 digs. Sharpley came
up two kills short, and Triefenbach
notched 13 kills and seven digs,
keeping Hromadka from returning
to the floor. The Stanford balance
kept Washington off guard all
night.
"We have such a strong middle
attack that when they start keying
on our middle, they shoot the ball
outside and you have somebody like
Folkl with one blocker up and it's
over," Triefenbach said. "When we
pass well, we run the middle attack
and it opens up everybody.
"It's evident in game one that we
really didn't have our head in the
match. When we get our head on
straight and we get going, it's fright
en inL r to watch."
