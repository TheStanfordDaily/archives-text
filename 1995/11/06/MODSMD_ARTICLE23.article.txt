The ninth-ranked Stanford women's
soccer team (16-3 overall, 7-0 Pacific 10
Conference) rounded out its regular season
yesterday afternoon in characteristic fash
ion, dominating the match throughout in a
4-0 pounding of an overmatched Arizona
team (6-11, 1-6) at Harry Maloney Field.
Sophomore midfielder Rita Hermiz
recorded a goal and two assists in the
match to lift the Cardinal to its ninth
straight win. With the regular season
behind them, the women now turn their
attention to the NCAA playoffs, which
begin Nov. 11 at campus sites. Pairings for
the 24-team tournament will be
announced this morning.
"[The nine-game winning streak] gives
us a hell of a lot of momentum going into
playoffs, and a lot of confidence," said
head coach lan Sawyers.

Hermiz opened the scoring at the 16-
minute, 21-second mark when she drib
bled through the Wildcat defense and beat
junior goalkeeper Jennifer Weibel to the
right side of the net, putting the Cardinal
on top for good. Despite outshooting Ari
zona 9-2 in the first half, however, Stan
ford didn't seem to find a groove until the
second period.
"They obviously came up here to kind of
keep the score down, and we didn't work it
out very well in the first half," Sawyers said.
"In the second half, we just played with a lit
tle bit more tactical understanding of what
they were doing. We did a good job of sens
ing it out ourselves and reading the defense,
reading the strengths and weaknesses of the
system they were trying to play."
The Cardinal outshot Arizona 13-1
after intermission, continually penetrat
ing deep into Wildcat territory. Senior
midfielder Carmel Murphy finally broke
through at the 55:08 mark on an assist
from freshman Charmaine Leßlanc. Her
miz then put the game out of reach when
she assisted on goals by senior sweeper
Jessica Fischer at 72:48 and freshman for
ward Kelly Adamson at 85:09.
