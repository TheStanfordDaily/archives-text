The ninth-ranked Stanford women's
soccer team (16-3 overall, 7-0 Pacific 10
Conference) rounded out its regular season
yesterday afternoon in characteristic fash
ion, dominating the match throughout in a
4-0 pounding of an overmatched Arizona
team (6-11, 1-6) at Harry Maloney Field.
Sophomore midfielder Rita Hermiz
recorded a goal and two assists in the
match to lift the Cardinal to its ninth
straight win. With the regular season
behind them, the women now turn their
attention to the NCAA playoffs, which
begin Nov. 11 at campus sites. Pairings for
the 24-team tournament will be
announced this morning.
"[The nine-game winning streak] gives
us a hell of a lot of momentum going into
playoffs, and a lot of confidence," said
head coach lan Sawyers.

Hermiz opened the scoring at the 16-
minute, 21-second mark when she drib
bled through the Wildcat defense and beat
junior goalkeeper Jennifer Weibel to the
right side of the net, putting the Cardinal
on top for good. Despite outshooting Ari
zona 9-2 in the first half, however, Stan
ford didn't seem to find a groove until the
second period.
"They obviously came up here to kind of
keep the score down, and we didn't work it
out very well in the first half," Sawyers said.
"In the second half, we just played with a lit
tle bit more tactical understanding of what
they were doing. We did a good job of sens
ing it out ourselves and reading the defense,
reading the strengths and weaknesses of the
system they were trying to play."
The Cardinal outshot Arizona 13-1
after intermission, continually penetrat
ing deep into Wildcat territory. Senior
midfielder Carmel Murphy finally broke
through at the 55:08 mark on an assist
from freshman Charmaine Leßlanc. Her
miz then put the game out of reach when
she assisted on goals by senior sweeper
Jessica Fischer at 72:48 and freshman for
ward Kelly Adamson at 85:09.

Defensively, freshman goalie
Erin Bryla made two saves in reg
istering her ninth shutout of the
season. Meanwhile, Fischer — a
four-year starter and consensus
All-American — started the 80th
game of her Stanford career to
surpass Melinda Minstrell as the
Cardinal's all-time leader in both
games played and games started.
Other than that, however, the
season finale didn't carry any
particular sentimental signifi
cance.
"I think it was emotional in
different periods of the game,
right at the very start of the game
and right at the very end,"
Sawyers said. "But I think we
know that we're gonna go on, so
it's not sn much like it's the last

game — which is a great way of
doing it, because you don't want
any game to be your last game."
For their finale, the women
prefer to wait until Dec. 3 in
Chapel Hill, N.C. — site of this
year's NCAA Final. To get there,
however, the Cardinal will have
to work its way past three top-25
opponents.
"I think (what we've got to
work on | is mentally preparing
for what other teams are going
to throw at us and being able to
do that on the fly," Sawyers said.
"As a coach, you want your play
ers to be decision makers on the
field because you can't get out
there and stop the game and say,
'No, this is what you should
have thought of.' So, we're try
ing to encourage our players to
be decision makers, to take
responsibility, and you just hope
that in a pressure-cooker situa
tion, they're able to do that."
