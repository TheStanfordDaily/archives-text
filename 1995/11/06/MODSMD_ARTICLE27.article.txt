# Lag votes in favor of grape boycott
## The 						Grape Vote 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
In the second major vote on the grape issue,
students in Lagunita Court elected this week
end to boycott the controversial fruit.
Coming in a week after Manzanita voted by a
small margin in favor of serving grapes, the
Lagunita referendum showed a large majority of
voters in favor of the boycott.
Of the 218 who voted in Lagunita Court —
which includes Ujamaa, Naranja, Granada,
Eucalypto and Adelfa — 142 voted to boycott
grapes, while 75 voted against the boycott. One
person wrote in an abstention, which was not an
option on the ballot. The total residency of
is 385 people.
Ujamaa resident assistant DeAngela Burns,
a senior, said the results were fair and students
were not swayed by pressures from either side.
In the view of the house staff at Ujamaa, she
added, "We're glad the result turned out the
way that it did."
But throughout Lagunita Court, opinions
were mixed on the highly charged issue, Burns
said. The house staff tried to present facts for
both sides.
"People had mixed opinions," she said of the
dorms. "What we tried to do was balance each
other out and make sure our programming was
equal, especially for the freshmen and sopho

mores who don't have as much exposure to the
issue.
"We made sure we got out all the pros and
cons," she added.
Students, faculty and staff at Stanford have
been fighting for a boycott on grapes for years, a
battle which came to the forefront after a
hunger strike staged in May 1994.
After the strike — during which students
allied for a University-wide boycott on grapes
because of treatment of migrant workers who
pick grapes — University President Gerhard
Casper formed a Grape Policy Committee,
which last year recommended that both resi
dences and administrative units be able to vote
on a boycott.
Casper rejected the recommendation for
administrative units but said he would allow
individual residences to vote.
But the voting includes only two options: to
boycott grapes or to serve grapes. Residents of
some co-ops on campus are now trying to publi
cize what they see as a solid compromise.
Coterminal student Forrest Melton, RA at
Synergy, and senior Caesar Djavaherian, RA at
Columbae, are offering information to anyone
interested in looking into buying organic grapes,
which Synergy would then order for the other
house.

way and take care of workers," Melton said.
The idea to publicize organic grapes stemmed
from what students felt was a lack of alterna
tives presented during the grape debate.
"When in KA training we were talking about
the grape policy, the two options being present
ed were to buy grapes or not to buy grapes," he
said. "There was no sort of alternative present
ed. The reason we were given was that it would
be too difficult for food service to buy organic
grapes. ... 1 felt like there were issues that
weren't being raised in the discussion of the
grape boycott."
All residences mast vote on the boycott by the
end of the quarter. Although Manzanita and
1-igunitn have already held their referenda, many
other dorms are waiting until a Nov. 13 forum, in
order to expand education on the issue.
