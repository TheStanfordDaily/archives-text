# Stage set for Measure R vote
## Palo Altans to consider anti-growth initiative in election tomorrow 
### Sonia M. Giordani Staff writer 
The heated debate over the
controversial Measure R comes
to a close tomorrow when Palo
Alto citizens vote on the initia
tive that seeks to curtail exces
sive commercial development.
If passed, the measure would
essentially wipe out current
plans outlined by the Stanford
Management Company for ex
pansion and renovation of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
The measure proposes to
maintain existing city growth

limits in the drafting of Palo
Alto's new Comprehensive Plan
for physical development
through the year 2015.
If approved, Measure R would
cap the density of development in
non-residential parcels of land,
said Ken Schreiber, director of
planning and community envi
ronment for the city of Palo Alto.
Schreiber said Measure R's
major impact on the University
would be felt by the shopping
center. One segment of the mea
sure specifically targets the mall,
limiting its expansion to a 1989
allotment of 65,000 square feet.
Last November the Stanford Management Com
pany — which manages the University's real estate
— proposed to increase the allotment by more than
140,000 square feet for renovation and expansion
of the shopping mall's retail and parking areas.
"The existing cap would be locked into place" by
Measure R, Schreiber said. "The Stanford Manage
ment Company could not go through with its plans."
Possible plans to expand the Medical School by
some 400,000 square feet over the next 20 years
would also be affected. Under the city's current
zoning ordinance, the Medical School's projected
growth would not be feasible, said Schreiber. Mea
sure R would make an amendment to the zoning
rules impossible without a citywide vote.
The measure would also hamper discussions
between city officials and Stanford Management
Company over a project to build a hotel and confer
ence center near the Stanford Research Park on
lands currently designated for residential purposes.
Stanford has spent close to $19,000 to oppose
Measure R. According to Andy Coe, director of com
munity relations, the University opposes the mea
sure because it specifically targets Stanford proper
ties. In addition, said Coe, "It is bad government
process to lock up city planning policy for 20 years."
However, proponents of Measure R note that
the latest draft of the city's new Comprehensive
Plan includes proposals that will only add to traffic.
"It's not a no-growth measure," said Palo Alto
resident Tom Wyman, who helped draft the argu
ment in favor of Measure R on the ballot. "It sim
ply says, let's retain those 11989] limitations."
"Measure R would simply require a public vote"
in order to amend those limitations, said Ellen
Wvman, also a Measure It advocate. "Nothing says

the committee cannot vote on something that
affects the community. The community is intelli
gent, interested, alert."
Measure R supporters include the Committee on
Affirmative Planning — a citizens' group that pre
sented the petition-initiative to the Palo Alto city
council in June, as well as the Charleston Meadows
Neighborhood Association and the Committee for
Green Foothills.
Over the last few weeks, an anti-Measure R
movement has gathered momentum, with such
supporters as the League of Women Voters and the
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce. Hewlett-Packard
has made a $5,000 contribution to the No on Mea
sure R Committee.
Hewlett-Packard's opposition to the measure
stems largely from a belief that such a proposal
"robs the planning commission, the city council
and Palo Alto citizens from the city's planning pro
cess," according to Carl Guardino, Bay Area gov
ernment affairs manager for the firm. Such a "dra
conian step is not needed in a city like Palo Alto
where the citizens are so engaged," he added.
"The meat of the coconut is Palo Alto's city
council, [which] is extremely diligent in watching
Stanford to make sure it would not do harm to the
community," said Palo Alto resident Andy Doty,
former director of community relations for Stan
ford. He added that he thinks the measure reflects
"misplaced concern."
The measure was born as a petition. More than
4,000 Palo Alto residents signed their names in sup
port of an initiative that seeks to maintain growth
limitations that came out of a 1989 study on City
wide Land Use and Transportation that warned of
the growing problem of traffic congestion.
Submitted to the Palo Alto city council in July,
the measure was placed on the ballot in August
when the council decided not to adopt it.
