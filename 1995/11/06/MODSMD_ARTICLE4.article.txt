# Stanford's history of growing pains
## 
### Sonia M. Giordani Staff writer 
The golden foothills that
cradle Stanford University
once rolled through Leland and
Jane Stanford's farm, where
Leland Stanford Jr. spent most
of his childhood. Horses
roamed and cattle grazed on the
grassy lands of the family's ex
pansive property.

A century later, the Univer
sity has lost most of its rural fla
vor. The Stanford Shopping
Center has replaced the old
dairy farm on the northern end
of the Stamfords' farm binds.
On the formerly bucolic pasture
of the West Campus rises one of
the world's leading medical cen
ters. The once-barren hills sur-
rounding the University are now popu
lated by 150 leading industrial and
research firms that comprise the Stan
ford Research Park.
As the University's skyline changed,
so too did its academic character. Stan
ford transformed itself from a regional
college into an international institution
of higher learning at the cutting edge of
research and applied science.
With some 8,200 acres of land, Stan
ford had the unique capacity to finance
its academic vision with such ventures
as a shopping center and the research
park, while also benefiting from the
close relationship to the industrial dis
trict of Silicon Valley.
"I do not think that (the University]
could have been done without land
development," said Jon Reider, associ
ate director of undergraduate admis
sions and a Stanford history expert.
"There are schools today that would
like to make such a transformation but
can't."
But Stanford's transformation has
brought more than esteem to Stanford

uid adjacent communities. It was
accompanied by the more tangible and
visible effects of increased traffic and
decreased open space that continue to

communities.
The controversial Measure R initia
tive on tomorrow's ballot marks the lat
est battle in a 35-year-old debate
between commercial developers and
Palo Alto's residential interests. As the
area's largest developer, Stanford Uni
versity and its expansion proposals have
mobilized Palo Alto residents, who fear
that further commercial growth will
compromise general neighborhood tran
quility with traffic and pollution.

The measure seeks to limit excessive
development in Palo Alto over the next
20 years. If passed, the proposal would
curtail Stanford's plans for further
commercial expansion.
"The community would be a very dif
ferent place without Stanford," said
Ellen VVyman, a Measure R advocate
who has been involved in the expansion
debate since she and her husband Tom,
a Stanford alumnus, moved to Palo Alto
in 1965.
She underlined that Palo Alto resi
dents are by no means "anti-Stanford."
"But Stanford does have an insa
tiable appetite for development," she
added.
From livestock to labs
For decades, the University must
have appeared an oasis of buildings pop
ping up in the midst of the Stanfords'
grassy terrain. Despite the construction
of academic buildings and residential
halls, the University managed to keep a
rural character.
The beginning of the 20th century
marked a time when the Marguerite
shuttle was a horse-drawn buggv and

Stanford was a small college where stu
dents could pursue the traditional liber
al arts education of the eastern schools
in a place where livestock still roamed.
The University grew modestly over
the course of its first 50 years. But

Stanford does have an
insatiable appetite for
development.'

Stanford s major transformation —
which propelled the University into the
major league of higher education to vie
with the Ivies of the East — came in the
aftermath of the second World War.
At the time, higher education was
growing and returning soldiers were
given incentives to pursue their educa
tion. In an effort to attract leading fac
ulty and top students, the University
set out to construct more academic and
housing facilities to serve the burgeon
ing Stanford community.

"The University was way behind i]
terms of laboratories, classrooms an*
residence halls," said Andy Doty, Stan
ford's director of community relation
from 1972 to 1993. But to expand it
facilities, the University would have t
generate more revenue.
Though "Stanford, California" wa
comprised of a mere cluster of building
and a post office, the University was no
exempt from paying taxes on its acres o
idle land.
By the late 1940s and early 1950s
however, "the taxes on the outlyini
lands exceeded the income from its agri
cultural uses, such as for grazing cows,
said Doty.
As the University looked for ways t<
generate income to broaden its academi
vision, the small, slumbering town o
Palo Alto idso realized possibilities fo
growth and development and sought t<
profit from Stanford's expansionary
plans.
By 1947, the University, the city an<
industrial leaders were discussing a pro
posal advanced by Stanford Busines:

The University, shown here in an aerial photograph from the early 19205, has developed heavily into
areas that were previously used for grazing cattle.
