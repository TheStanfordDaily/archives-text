# Stanford responds to Rabin's assassination
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
While saddened and shocked by Satur
day's assassination of Israeli Prime Minis
ter Yitzhak Kabin, Stanford students and
faculty expressed mixed reactions yesterday
about whether it would positively or nega
tively affect the peace process in the Middle
East.
"I started to cry. I was devastated," said
Jewish Student Association President
Nicole Marmon. "It is a horrible loss for the
country of Israel and for the Jewish people
as a whole around the world."
Rabin was shot Saturday night as he was
leaving a rally for peace. He was rushed to
the hospital and died an hour later. The al
leged assailant, Yigal Amir, is a 27-year-old
law student with ties to Jewish right-wing
extremist groups.
Amir claims he shot Rabin to stop Is
rael's peace policies. Rabin signed an agree
ment in 1993 to give Palestinians autonomy
in the West Bank and Gaza, territories cur
rently occupied by the Israelis.
It is widely expected that the Israeli
Knesset will back an interim government
led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, an
other key figure in the peace negotiations,
who has been acting as prime minister since
Rabin's death. Elections are scheduled for
October 1996 but may be moved up in the
wake of the assassination.
Stanford students and faculty said they
were surprised and saddened by the assassi
nation.
Junior Wael Diab, a Jordanian of Pales
tinian descent, said, "I was pretty upset
with the assassination. Rabin was the first

Israeli prime minister with enough courage
and will to go through peace process with
the Palestinians."
However, some said they thought they
could detect the tension in the past which
culminated in the assassination.
"I burst out in tears, but I wasn't sur
prised," said junior Gil Rabinovici, a mem
ber of the Israeli Student Association. "I
had been in Israel last summer and sensed
that things were getting out of hand. The
right wing was villainizing Rabin. They
were depicting him as a Nazi and saying he
was a traitor. I could feel the mood in Israel
was going toward division. Despite that,
everyone thought it was only slogans. No
one thought something like this would hap
pen."
History Prof. Steven Zipperstein, head of
the Jewish Studies Program, agreed, saying
the assassination was consistent with a po
litical culture which in recent months pro
duced posters of Rabin between the sights of
a gun. A recent ruling by a group of rabbis in
New York said "that it is legitimate to as
sassinate Rabin and Peres on the grounds of
them giving up part of the holy land."
"It is important to understand that in
radical religious circles in Israel, the mur
der of Rabin and Peres has been spoken
about openly for some time," said Joel
Beinin, an associate professor of history. "It
seems to me that it would be a mistake to
write his assassin off as a marginal lone
gunman. He may have worked alone, but he
emerged out of a distinct and very disturb
ing cultural milieu."
While some said they believed that the
peace efforts may have been irrevo
cably damaged, others thought that
the assassination might spur the
peace process
"In a bizarre way ... it might
help the peace process," Zipperstein
said. "The general tendency in
Israel has been that the extreme
left and right wings have
denounced the (assassination). ...
They want to separate themselves
from it."
Feres also might be more willing

to push harder for peace than
Rabin, Zipperstein said.
"Rabin was not terrifically
enthusiastically forthcoming and
generous about peace," he said. "It
was Peres' project. He did most of
the negotiating. Rabin has been
associated with the more militaris
tic elements. He was a military hero
and had a view of peace as a securi
ty question for Israel.
"Peres has a different view,"
Zipperstein continued. "He really
believes that in order for peace to
work, the Palestinians and other
Arabs must perceive Israel as just.
He is willing to give more conces
sions than Rabin wanted to

make."
History Prof. Mark Mancall
agreed. "I do not think it will affect
the peace process except that it may
encourage it a little faster," Mancall
said. "People forget that it was
Peres who was the first member of
the government to push the pro
cess.
Others were less certain, howev
er, about the stability of the peace
process given the assassination.
"Either Israeli society will real
ize what point we fire at and how
much we stand to lose if we contin
ue to be divided ... or else this is
the first shot in a civil war which
will determine the future nature of

the country," Rabinovici said.
"Whether we go toward com
promise and peace or backtrack
completely, I honestly do not
know,"he added. "Many in Israel
are scared."
Peres does not have the credibil
ity that Rabin enjoyed because of
the latter's status as a military hero
and firm defense minister during
Palestinian unrest, said Hillel
Rabbi Ari Cartun.
"Rabin's passing symbolizes the
last of his generation of Zionist pio
neers leaving the government,"
Cartun said. "With his passing,
that clear vision of Zionism
becomes more clouded by the seem

ingly intractable choices the Israeli
populace faces.
"But this assassination might
cause people in Israel to become
more disgusted with the very far
right wing and its rhetoric of trea
son and encouragement and incite
ment of civil war," he added.
Marmon said she thought that
the assassination could seriously
jeopardize the peace process.
"It will impede the process a lot,
and I don't know how the transi
tion will be from Rabin to a new
leader," she said. "A lot of people
are upset and think that it is not
beneficial to facilitating peace. I
think it will be difficult."

Because the assassin was Jew
ish, the effects of the assassination
will be more strongly felt, students
and faculty said.
"It would be the expected thing
if the assassin was an Arab,'' Zip
perstein said. "There would have
been grief, but it would have set
back the peace process. It would not
have caused the degree of political
reconsideration that is now under
way."
Mancall agreed, saying the
assassination will spur Jews all
over the world "to rethink our own
attitudes. If someone else would
have assassinated Rabin, it would
have been a different world."

been grief, but it would have set
back the peace process. It would not
have caused the degree of political
reconsideration that is now under
way."
Mancall agreed, saying the
assassination will spur Jews all
over the world "to rethink our own
attitudes. If someone else would
have assassinated Rabin, it would
have been a different world."
While saddened and shocked by Satur
day's assassination of Israeli Prime Minis
ter Yitzhak Kabin, Stanford students and
faculty expressed mixed reactions yesterday
about whether it would positively or nega
tively affect the peace process in the Middle
East.
"I started to cry. I was devastated," said
Jewish Student Association President
Nicole Marmon. "It is a horrible loss for the
country of Israel and for the Jewish people
as a whole around the world."
Rabin was shot Saturday night as he was
leaving a rally for peace. He was rushed to
the hospital and died an hour later. The al
leged assailant, Yigal Amir, is a 27-year-old
law student with ties to Jewish right-wing
extremist groups.
Amir claims he shot Rabin to stop Is
rael's peace policies. Rabin signed an agree
ment in 1993 to give Palestinians autonomy
in the West Bank and Gaza, territories cur
rently occupied by the Israelis.
It is widely expected that the Israeli
Knesset will back an interim government
led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, an
other key figure in the peace negotiations,
who has been acting as prime minister since
Rabin's death. Elections are scheduled for
October 1996 but may be moved up in the
wake of the assassination.
Stanford students and faculty said they
were surprised and saddened by the assassi
nation.
Junior Wael Diab, a Jordanian of Pales
tinian descent, said, "I was pretty upset
with the assassination. Rabin was the first

Israeli prime minister with enough courage
and will to go through peace process with
the Palestinians."
However, some said they thought they
could detect the tension in the past which
culminated in the assassination.
"I burst out in tears, but I wasn't sur
prised," said junior Gil Rabinovici, a mem
ber of the Israeli Student Association. "I
had been in Israel last summer and sensed
that things were getting out of hand. The
right wing was villainizing Rabin. They
were depicting him as a Nazi and saying he
was a traitor. I could feel the mood in Israel
was going toward division. Despite that,
everyone thought it was only slogans. No
one thought something like this would hap
pen."
History Prof. Steven Zipperstein, head of
the Jewish Studies Program, agreed, saying
the assassination was consistent with a po
litical culture which in recent months pro
duced posters of Rabin between the sights of
a gun. A recent ruling by a group of rabbis in
New York said "that it is legitimate to as
sassinate Rabin and Peres on the grounds of
them giving up part of the holy land."
"It is important to understand that in
radical religious circles in Israel, the mur
der of Rabin and Peres has been spoken
about openly for some time," said Joel
Beinin, an associate professor of history. "It
seems to me that it would be a mistake to
write his assassin off as a marginal lone
gunman. He may have worked alone, but he
emerged out of a distinct and very disturb
ing cultural milieu."
While some said they believed that the
peace efforts may have been irrevo
cably damaged, others thought that
the assassination might spur the
peace process
"In a bizarre way ... it might
help the peace process," Zipperstein
said. "The general tendency in
Israel has been that the extreme
left and right wings have
denounced the (assassination). ...
They want to separate themselves
from it."
Feres also might be more willing

to push harder for peace than
Rabin, Zipperstein said.
"Rabin was not terrifically
enthusiastically forthcoming and
generous about peace," he said. "It
was Peres' project. He did most of
the negotiating. Rabin has been
associated with the more militaris
tic elements. He was a military hero
and had a view of peace as a securi
ty question for Israel.
"Peres has a different view,"
Zipperstein continued. "He really
believes that in order for peace to
work, the Palestinians and other
Arabs must perceive Israel as just.
He is willing to give more conces
sions than Rabin wanted to

make."
History Prof. Mark Mancall
agreed. "I do not think it will affect
the peace process except that it may
encourage it a little faster," Mancall
said. "People forget that it was
Peres who was the first member of
the government to push the pro
cess.
Others were less certain, howev
er, about the stability of the peace
process given the assassination.
"Either Israeli society will real
ize what point we fire at and how
much we stand to lose if we contin
ue to be divided ... or else this is
the first shot in a civil war which
will determine the future nature of

the country," Rabinovici said.
"Whether we go toward com
promise and peace or backtrack
completely, I honestly do not
know,"he added. "Many in Israel
are scared."
Peres does not have the credibil
ity that Rabin enjoyed because of
the latter's status as a military hero
and firm defense minister during
Palestinian unrest, said Hillel
Rabbi Ari Cartun.
"Rabin's passing symbolizes the
last of his generation of Zionist pio
neers leaving the government,"
Cartun said. "With his passing,
that clear vision of Zionism
becomes more clouded by the seem

ingly intractable choices the Israeli
populace faces.
"But this assassination might
cause people in Israel to become
more disgusted with the very far
right wing and its rhetoric of trea
son and encouragement and incite
ment of civil war," he added.
Marmon said she thought that
the assassination could seriously
jeopardize the peace process.
"It will impede the process a lot,
and I don't know how the transi
tion will be from Rabin to a new
leader," she said. "A lot of people
are upset and think that it is not
beneficial to facilitating peace. I
think it will be difficult."

Because the assassin was Jew
ish, the effects of the assassination
will be more strongly felt, students
and faculty said.
"It would be the expected thing
if the assassin was an Arab,'' Zip
perstein said. "There would have
been grief, but it would have set
back the peace process. It would not
have caused the degree of political
