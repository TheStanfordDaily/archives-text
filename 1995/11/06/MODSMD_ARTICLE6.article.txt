# Registrar's Office gets onto the Infobahn with Bulletin
## 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
The full text of the Stanford
course catalog and a wealth of
other University information are
now available on-line over the
World Wide Web.
As part of a new home page for
the Registrar's Office, all the in
formation in the "Stanford Bul
letin" is now available on-line,
said Thomas Stephens, editor and
publications coordinator at the
Registrar's Office.
The bulletin is published annu
ally by the Registrar's Office and

includes a full catalog of graduate
and undergraduate degrees, de
partments and courses, as well as
explanations of University struc
ture, policies and a general
overview of how the University
works.
While the Time Schedule has
been on-line for over a year, this is
the first time the bulletin and the
Registrar's Office home page are
available.
The project was executed by
Stephens, Computer Administra
tion Support Team Manager
Christine Quinn and Conrad
Damon of the Workstation Sup

port Team, which oversees all of
the University's on-line services.
"[On-line manuals] are a gen
eral trend at universities across
the country," Stephens said.
"Stanford's a little behind the
curve."
University Registrar Roger
Printup stressed that the on-line
bulletin is simply a first stage in
an ongoing project.
"What is there now... is a very
early version," he said. "There's
much more to come.... We plan
to put all of the publications for
which the Registrar's Office is
responsible on-line."
These publications include the
Registering at Stanford pamphlet,
the Graduate Student Handbook
and forms for graduate admission.
"Instead of coming down to the
Registrar's Office," Stephens
explained, "they am find us on-line
ctnd print up their own forms."
Stephens said the Registrar's
Office is also planning to add links
allowing anyone looking at a course
entry in the Stanford Bulletin to
immediately see that course's entry
in the Time Schedule, which would
be continuously updated to reflect
any changes in time or location.
Stephens said those future pro
jects might be available in one to
two months.
The Registrar's Office home
page, which was introduced Oct. 24,
