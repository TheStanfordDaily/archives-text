# 'Mumia is the only political prisoner on death row in the United States'
## Lawyer Weinglass calls for justice 
### Dana Hangai 
In a trial that has gained attention from such
celebrities as Ed Asner, Samuel L. Jackson and
Whoopi Goldberg, defense attorney Leonard Wein
glass spoke at Branner on Friday night about his
role in the high-profile Mumia Abu-Jamal case and
his efforts to provide Abu-Jamal with another court
hearing.
Abu-Jamal is a Philadelphia African-American
journalist who was convicted and sentenced to death
in 1982 for the shooting of a police officer. His sup
porters maintain that the trial was racially and polit
ically biased.

Abu-Jamal was originally scheduled to be execut
ed Aug. 17, but was granted an indefinite stay of exe
cution by Pennsylvania Judge Albert Sabo, who
presided over the original trial.
At 16, Abu-Jamal was one of the founding
members of the Black Panthers and, as a reporter,
spoke out against police brutality. Weinglass be
came involved in the case in 1992 and is one of four
lawyers working with Abu-Jamal to get a new
trial.
"Mumia is the only political prisoner on death row
in the United States," said Weinglass, who has also
represented such controversial
figures as 1960s activists Abbie
Hoffman and Angela Davis.
"(Abu-Jamal is] a journalist, an
award-winning author who's been
in prison for 14 years, and his case
has important implications fur
everyone."
Weinglass stated that at the
trial, Abu-Jamal was denied
access to a proper defense. He
was provided with only $150
each for his own pathologists,
firearms experts and investiga
tors â€” an amount "that no
expert would even consider
accepting."
"He had ajudge who had sent
more people to death row than
any other sitting judge, includ
ing those in the death-row
states," Weinglass said. "He had
a reluctant lawyer to defend
him who had never even talked
to any of the defense's witness

es. Mumia's trial was a non
trial."
Weinglass also discussed the
prosecution's attack strategy.
"They brought before the jury
Mumia's politics," he said. "The
prosecutors paraded before the
jury his political affiliations and
beliefs when he was only 16 years
old. In 1991, the Supreme Court
said that you cannot use some
one's politics which are not
directly related to a case in order
to escalate it to the death penal
ty"
Concerning the international
support Abu-Jamal's case is
receiving from France. Japan
and other countries, Weinglass
said, "You're talking about a
trial international in scope with
the whole world watching, look
ing at our nation's racial history
and its flaws in the justice sys
tem. People see it so clearly from
the outside, but we cannot see it
on the inside."
Currently, Abu-Jamal is still
incarcerated and his petition for
another trial was denied Sept.

15. Weinglass said his efforts
will not end until justice is
served.
"We are not saying that we
want to free Abu-Jamal," he
said. "We want another trial and
whatever the verdict is, we'll
defend that trial."
The discussion was sponsored
by Branner Presents and the
African and Afro-American
Studies Program.
Branner resident assistant
David Valle, who organized the
event, said, "I think it was
important that we have things
like this. It may be nice to have
Oliver Stone speak on campus,
but it's important to have people
like Leonard Weinglass that
bring us to the reality that is out
there."
Junior Joy Moses said, "I
thought it was interesting. I
learned some things about the
case that I hadn't heard before.
I'm glad that he came because he
informed students about issues
that should be important to
them."
