As the former executive direc
tor of the National Gay and Les
bian Task Force, Urvashi Vaid
has long been on the vanguard of
the gay and lesbian movement.
And though she said her call for
"good" family values like plea
sure, fun, joy and sex would prob
ably scandalize the right-wing
Christian Coalition, audience
members who assembled in the
History Corner on Friday night
were more than eager to applaud
her speech.
According to graduate stu
dent Jana Rich, Vaid is one of the
top leaders in the gay and lesbian
movement. She added that she
admires Vaid for her "political
passion that gets everyone in
spired."
"The fact that Urvashi is a
woman does not mean that she
only appeals to women," said

Friday night.
Rich.
Vaid spent the majority of Fri
day night's speech outlining her
agenda for "broad social change."
According to Vaid, traditional
methods of activism and protest
will never bring the gay and lesbian
movement success.

Vaid, a lawyer and an activist,
was named bv Time magazine last
year as one of the nation's most
influential young leaders. Her
recent book, "Virtual Equality: the
Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian
Liberation," has reinforced her sta
tus as a visionary leader of the gay
and lesbian movement.
The movement, Vaid said, has
been focused on creating a society
based on non-discrimination. She
explained that the major goals of

the movement are to find a way to
allow gay and lesbian people to be
parents, to have equal access to
government services and to live
openly without prejudice and dis
crimination.
Although Vaid said she does not
believe that she will live to see the
fulfillment of this basic agenda, she
still insisted that the movement
must not limit itself to a single
issue. The movement, she main
tained, must be progressive.

"I am proposing that we have to
do more," Vaid said. "The lesbian
and gay movement ought to con
sider our ideal society. We must say
that we are against racism and sex
ism, and we must articulate the
type of society that we want to cre
ate for all people."
Vaid stressed that this type of
change might take a revolution.
She said she is seeking other pro
gressive people who have a desire
for social change to help her

achieve her vision of an "ideal soci
ety."
"Historically, it has been young
people who have led revolutions,"
Vaid said. "I refuse to believe that
the only option is the one Newt Gin
grich is putting on the table. If we
are left with Newt Gingrich as our
only revolutionary ...she said.
To facilitate thought and
progress, Vaid encouraged campus
groups to stimulate discussion. She
stressed that one goal of the gay

and lesbian movement is to edu
cate people.
"My suggestion is always go for
events that will cause a buzz," Vaid
said.
Vaid's speech was sponsored by
a wide variety of campus groups
including the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, the
Stanford's Women Center, and gay
and lesbian groups at the Law
School and the Graduate School of
