As the former executive direc
tor of the National Gay and Les
bian Task Force, Urvashi Vaid
has long been on the vanguard of
the gay and lesbian movement.
And though she said her call for
"good" family values like plea
sure, fun, joy and sex would prob
ably scandalize the right-wing
Christian Coalition, audience
members who assembled in the
History Corner on Friday night
were more than eager to applaud
her speech.
According to graduate stu
dent Jana Rich, Vaid is one of the
top leaders in the gay and lesbian
movement. She added that she
admires Vaid for her "political
passion that gets everyone in
spired."
"The fact that Urvashi is a
woman does not mean that she
only appeals to women," said
