John Shoven's not trying to
"Harvardize," only reorganize.
Shoven, dean of the School of

Humanities and
Sciences, insists
that the closure
of the Food Re
search Institute
will be beneficial
in the long run.
But for many fac
ulty members,
his recommenda
tion is hard to di
gest.

Shoven yesterday elaborated on
his rationale for proposing that the
75-year-old department be consoli
dated into an interdisciplinary re
search center, its doctoral program
cut and its masters students moved
to the International Policy Studies
program.
To be implemented, the recom

mendation requires the approval of
the University President, Provost,
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council and the Board of Trustees.
Shoven cited the inefficiency of
the University's "five economics
departments" compared to the sys
tems established by its competi
tion.
Besides the institute, econom
ics research is done at the Gradu
ate School of Business, Depart
ment of Economics, Department
of Engineering and Economic Sys
tems and the Hoover Institution,
he said.
In addition, professors in the de
partments of economics, political
science, history and anthropology
study economic development.
"I don't think you'll find other
disciplines that have five different
places," he said.
Similarly, Shoven argues that
because none of Stanford's compa-


Shoven
rable institutions have a Food
Research Institute, it is an easy
and obvious target for review.
The debate, however, contin
ues over whether Stanford
should maintain its uniqueness
and keep the internationally
renowned institute intact or —
due to a wave of expected retire
ments over the next five years
— strengthen the doctoral pro
grams under the Economics
Department while transforming
the institute to a Center for
Economic Development and
Food Research, drawing faculty
from already-existing depart
ments.
Citing the success of similar
measures at other institutions
such as the University of Chica
go, Boston University and Har
vard — which has a comparable
Institute for International Devel
opment — Shoven said the con
solidation will increase effective
ness.
"The Food Research Institute
is a fairly unique institution.
That's part of its strength and
part of its weakness," he said.
"Most every other University
structure is different. We
shouldn't be wed to the history of
how it's done at Stanford."
However, he emphasized that
his intent is not to "homogenize"
Stanford's programs to mimic
those of Harvard, Yale or other
comparable institutions.
Shoven's recommendation,
originally proposed by a commit
tee consisting of Business Prof.
David Brady, History Prof.
Stephen I labor and A. Michael
Spence, Graduate School of
Business dean, has drawn a bar
rage of criticism from faculty
and students close to the insti
tute.
And even at the institutions
Shoven would like his school to
emulate, there is no consensus
that closing the institute would
be beneficial.
"I really don't think it would

maintain its present level of dis
tinction," said D. Gale Johnson,
an economics professor for 50
years at the University of Chica
go. "The Ph.D. program is an
important part of that. If those
are down the drain, most of what
the FRI stood for is gone."
Institute faculty have also
condemned the decision, assert
ing that a separate interdisci
plinary program will not be
enticing to students, and the
research center will not appeal to
faculty.
Shoven emphasized that the
institute is the only special pro
gram considered for the restruc
turing. He said that applied
physics, the only other compara
ble program in humanities and
sciences to the food research
department, is under no danger
of consolidation.
At the Institute of Interna
tional Studies, the change could
affect the status of its affiliates.
Some food research professors
also do research for international
studies and may be displaced
after the reorganization.
Shoven has insisted that all
tenured faculty will be given
departmental positions, while
the junior faculty will be laid off
after three years.
"We're certainly hoping that a
very positive outcome can be
found for their presence at Stan
ford," said Nancy Okimoto,
deputy director of the Institute
for International Studies.
Faculty affiliated with the
Program in International Poli
cy Studies — where masters
students will be transferred
should the recommendations
be approved — had little con
tact with the decision commit
tee before the recommendation
was made. However, Political
Science Prof. Judith Goldstein,
coordinator of the program,
said that the proposal is in too
early a stage to warrant notifi
cation or concern.
"If they were thinking about it
seriously, we'd know something
about it," she said. "We're way
back in this process. Nothing has
happened."
