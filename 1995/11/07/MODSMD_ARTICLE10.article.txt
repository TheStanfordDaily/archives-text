## 'Peace soldier' put to rest 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — A shaken
world said its goodbyes to Yitzhak
Rabin in a sun-washed pine grove yes
terday, laying him to rest with the
praise of presidents and the tears of a
granddaughter.
The host of world leaders attending
his funeral at Mount Herzl cemetery
was testimony to the authority of the
slain prime minister, a warrior who
looked beyond his years on the battle
field to make peace with some of Israel's
most intractable enemies.
The dozens of dignitaries from the
Arab world who put aside their most
fundamental differences with Israel to
attend his funeral proved how radically
Rabin helped change the face of the
Middle East.
King Hussein came from Jordan to
urge other Arab countries to take the
road to peace. President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt also made his first
visit to Jerusalem under Israeli rule, as
did ministers from Morocco, Oman and
Qatar, countries without ties to Israel.
In a stunned Israel, Jews were still

trying to digest the ugly fact that one of
their own — a right-wing extremist
opposed to Rabin's peacemaking with
the Palestinians — had shot him to
death at a peace rally.
In a region fumbling for direction,
the Arabs' presence at the funeral was a
powerful gesture of acceptance towards
Israel. They put aside their differences
over the disputed city of Jerusalem —
the most sensitive issue on the Arab-
Israeli agenda — to pay respects to a
fallen peacemaker.
King Hussein forged a strong bond
with Rabin in decades of secret and
open negotiations that culminated in a
peace treaty between Jordan and Israel
last year.
"You lived as a soldier, you died as a
soldier for peace," said Hussein, who
wore a red-and-white checkered Arab
headdress. "I believe it is time for all of
us to come out openly and to speak of
peace."
Rabin, who led Israel to triumphs on
the battlefield, then stretched out a
hand of peace to his Arab neighbors,

was buried with full military honors in
a pine glade atop a hill overlooking the
volatile city where he was born 73 years
ago.
His widow Leah, sitting in the first
row, wept through much of the ceremo
ny, supported by her son, Yuval, her
daughter, Dalia, and her grandchildren
Noa and Yonatan.
Only once did a smile cross her face,
when President Clinton affectionately
recalled how Rabin, never one for for
mality, had come to a black-tie dinner in
Washington without the black tie.
Clinton called Rabin "a martyr for
peace but... a victim of hate."
Rabin aide Eitan Haber spoke last,
reading from the bloodstained sheet of
paper with the words of the "Song for
Peace" that Rabin had sung at Saturday
night's rally.
After Haber spoke, Rabin's coffin
was carried about 200 yards to the
gravesite. A blue-and-white flag with
the Star of David was removed from the
casket, which was then lowered into the
grave.
