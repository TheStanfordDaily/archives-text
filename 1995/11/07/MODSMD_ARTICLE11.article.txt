# Arab leaders mourn Rabin's death

JERUSALEM (AP) - Arab leaders
made a powerful gesture of acceptance to
Israel at the funeral of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, putting aside fundamen
tal differences to pay last respects to a fall
en peacemaker.
Five Arab states — Jordan, Egypt,
Oman, Qatar, Morocco — and the Pales
tinians sent delegations to the funeral in
Jerusalem despite the political risk at
home.
"It has a huge significance. I had to
pinch myself to believe what I am seeing,"
said government spokesman Uri Dromi,
noting the Arab robes and headdresses
that dotted the gallery of dignitaries.
"It's terrible that it takes such a
tragedy to bring them here, but I don't
believe anyone in Israel can be indifferent

to this."
Jerusalem is the most explosive issue
dividing Arabs and Israelis, and Arab
leaders had avoided the holy city for fear
of implying recognition of Israel's claim to
all of Jerusalem as its capital. Israel,
under the command of then-chief of staff
Rabin, captured Jerusalem's eastern sec
tor from Jordan in 1967 and annexed it.
Palestinians want east Jerusalem as a
future capital.
But in a stirring testimony to the long
road that the Mideast has trodden, the
Arab heads of state and ministers put
aside this most volatile of issues to pay
tribute to the vision of peace for which
Rabin became a martyr.
Conspicuous by his absence was PLO
leader Yasser Arafat, who together with

Rabin and his foreign minister, Shimon
Peres, won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize
for the historic Israel-PLO treaty.
An Israeli official said Arafat stayed
home by "mutual consent," for fear his
presence would provoke right-wing
protests in Israel and because of lingering
ambivalence m.iny Israelis still feel about
the Palestinian leader.
The PLO leader watched the funeral
on television from his office in Gaza City
and told CNN: "This loss is not only a loss
for the Israelis and the Palestinians, but
the whole world because it is a loss for the
peace."
Rabin's assassination, he said, "must
not give a chance for the fanatic enemies
of the peace process to achieve their goals.
And we have to continue together."
