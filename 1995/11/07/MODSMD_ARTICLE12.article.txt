# Government waiting on Congress to extend its credit limit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The govern
ment indefinitely postponed $31.5 billion in
borrowing yesterday, avoiding violation of
the federal debt limit but raising new talk of
the first default in the nation's history.
House Republican Leader Dick Annoy of
Texas predicted Congress would raise the
limit this week. But the issue is deeply tan
gled with the dispute between Congress
and President Clinton over federal spend
ing.
Wall Street was wary.
Historic default on U.S. debt repayment

"is a very major threat," said economist
Elliott Piatt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jen
rette Securities Corp. in New York.
The debt ceiling, which cannot be raised
except by Congress, is now $4.9 trillion.
Armey said in a statement, "We've
known for some time that we'll have to act
before Nov. 15, which is why later this week
we'll pass a debt ceiling increase consistent
with getting to the first balanced budget in
30 years."
Clinton and most Republican congres
sional leaders were in Israel yesterday for

the funeral of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
Even if agreement is reached on a tem
porary increase in the limit, some House
Republicans are threatening to attach
amendments to the legislation that Clinton
has promised to veto.
The House Ways and Means Committee
plans to vote today on a measure that
would extend the government's borrowing
authority into early to mid-December, said
panel spokesman Ari Fleischer.
Rut that measure will probably include

language forbidding Clinton from shifting
money from trust funds or employing other
strategies that the administration has con
sidered using in case Congress refuses to
extend the debt limit further, said an
anonymous Republican aide.
The impasse is simple to describe but
difficult to break: The Republicans are
insisting that Clinton accept their blueprint
for balancing the budget in seven years
before they pass legislation to lift the ceiling
for more than a short period. The adminis
tration wants Congrass to boost the limit

while negotiations over broader tax and
spending issues continue.
Before leaving for Israel aboard Air
Force One with Clinton, Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he believed
Congress would boost the ceiling in time to
avoid default.
But unless Congress raises the limit
quickly, the Treasury will be forced to find
other alternatives, all of which Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin has said would
entail costs to U.S. taxpayers and in some
cases be subject to possible legal challenges.
