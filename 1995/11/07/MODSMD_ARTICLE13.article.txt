New students, transfers
need more help getting
involved in activities

Fall quarter has
reached its midpoint here at
Stanford. What seems nor
mal to many can be a momentous
occasion for new faces in the
crowd â€” freshmen and transfers.
Confusion and academics often
occupy the first few weeks of a
new student's life. Only after set
tling in comfortably can new stu
dents really have the opportunity
to experience new social and
extra-curricular activities.
For this reason, the University
should try to create and distribute
handbook that can serve as a
resource guide for new students
who may be interested in activi
ties, but could not find the time to
investigate them at the beginning
of the year. The Student Activities
Fair occurs so early in the year
that freshmen and transfers may
not even attend because they are
so preoccupied with academic
affairs.
Furthermore, the short descrip
tions given for student groups and
organizations in front of the Stan
ford Directory provide a thread
bare picture of what certain
groups have to offer. Then again,
this assumes that freshmen and
transfers are able to get their
hands on a copy of the Directory,
since it does not come out until
November at the earliest. Most
students don't even know about
its existence, much less look up the
phone numbers for organizations
there.
An organizations directory pub
lished at the beginning of the year,
much like the freshman facebook,
would help students recognize and
explore the great variety of stu
dent groups and activities on cam
pus. This could be a partial solu
tion to help cure the apathy that

so many people complain about at
Stanford.
A student handbook would also
be a good way to coordinate all the
disparate pieces of information
floating around. Currently, the
huge variety of student groups cir
culate independent literature
about themselves. Collecting their
literature in a single handbook
would be of great convenience to
both students and the groups
themselves.
This strategy could also partial
ly accommodate the inability of
organizations and students to
effectively communicate interest
to each other. Organizations such
as The Bridge already post fliers
everywhere. But fliers can be
taken down or overlooked. A pub
lished guide to student organiza
tions on campus would be a ready
resource for students to use.
When word gets out, the
response can be overwhelming.
The first meeting of the Texas
Club drew a packed crowd to its
inaugural meeting. But what if
someone missed the meeting or
what about prospective freshmen
who may be interested in explor
ing some of these groups? What
resource would such individual's
have? Students have notoriously
short memories and asking
friends and resident assistants
may not be the best bet. A student
handbook would easily put the
information in the hands of inter
ested students.
Along with information on
organizations, the handbook
could also contain updated and
more detailed versions of maps for
new students. It could also include
safety information found in the
Stanford Farm Almanac.
While the Stanford Directory is
a good resource, it comes out
when the quarter is almost over. A
student organizations handbook
is not a superfluous expense. It
would bridge the gap between the
time the Directory's information
is made available for new students
and the insufficient Student
Activities Fair.
