## It's an affirmative reaction 
### 
Affirmative action in college
admissions exists to counter this
fact: Without race-based prefer
ences, certain races would be underrepre
sented (or even more underrepresented
than they are now) in American colleges.
Who or what is responsible for this
fact? Beyond all the rhetoric, this simple
question leads to the root of the affirma
tive action debate.
Supporters of affirmative action assert
that the responsibility lies outside the
ethnic groups affirmative action prefer
ences are supposed to help. Whether
from racism, historical disadvantage or
other malevolent force, the cause behind
a group's under-representation cannot be
attributed to the group itself.
Critics of affirmative action believe the
exact opposite. If, for example, African-
Americans are underrepresented in
American colleges, the responsibility for
that fact lies with African-Americans.
With regard to malevolent exogenous
forces, critics of racial preferences believe
they are either insignificant or don't exist
at all.
As an analogy, imagine a race between
two people. One person consistently
wins, and consequently, the other consis
tently loses. Affirmative action support
ers attribute the phenomenon to the dif
ference in lengths of the tracks or the dis
proportionate training of the winner.
Critics attribute the phenomenon to the
runners themselves.

This gets to the heart of why affirma
tive action is such a sensitive issue to so
many people. If you are against racial
preferences, you are attributing a group's
failure to the group itself. Think for a
moment what this implies: African Amer
icans collectively score lower on the SAT.
The SAT is a fair measure of intelligence.
Therefore, African Americans are collec
tively less intelligent than other ethnic
groups.
Now you know why many supporters
of affirmative action act like they'll tear
your head off if you disagree with them.
I support affirmative action, but not
for many of the reasons affirmative
action supporters assert. Back to the run
ner analogy, I believe that the tracks are
the same length and in the same condi
tion. Supporters of affirmative action will
use buzzwords like "racist society" and
"institutional racism" without specifical
ly identifying what they're talking about.
Where is this racism? Where is this Uni
versity of Keep the Minorities Down? A
common response to these questions
points to a lack of minorities in educa
tion, business and other areas. This
response, however, is a classic circular
argument. This says that minorities are
underrepresented because minorities are
underrepresented — but it doesn't
explain why.
Those who claim "institutional racism"
are fighting ghosts. They detract from
affirmative action by attributing its pur

pose to an enemy that doesn't exist.
So why do I support affirmative action?
Although there is no "institutional
racism" today, institutional anti-minority
forces were prevalent only decades ago,
and this fact has had a strong bearing on
the situation we are in today. Every per
son's success has a strong correlation to
his or her parents' success. If my grandfa
ther was financially successful, that
would put me at a distinct advantage to
those whose grandfathers were not finan
cially successful. If my grandfather was
discriminated against, and that discrimi
nation prevented him from reaching his
full potential, it would only be consistent
for me to receive a preference to make up
for that discrimination.
It is without question that many
minorities would be in a more favorable
position today if their grandparents were
allowed their fair piece of the American
pie.
Affirmative action is not about fight
ing "institutional racism" or any other
imaginary foe.
It's about making up for what's
already been lost.

Mr. Small's great-grandfather created a
successful linen business. He attributes
part of his success to his family's finan
cial well-being.
