Rabin's death a time of reflection on Israeli ties

AS MEMBERS OF the Stanford
community, we were extremely
saddened by the assassination of
Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a
courageous leader and a crusader for
peace. As Jewish students deeply con
cerned with the security and future of
Israel, we hope that Rabin's vision of
regional harmony will live on and that
the world will not allow the acts of one
extremist to stand in the way of peace.
As Americans, we believe that our own
nation must stand by Israel to support
democracy and promote peace â€” now
more than ever.
In concluding his speech on Saturday,
President Clinton said, "Yitzhak Rabin
was my partner and my friend. . ..
Because words cannot express my true
feelings, let me just say, 'Shalom
chaver.' Good-bye friend." In addition to
describing the deep friendship between
two great world leaders, Clinton's words
illustrate the special relationship shared

by their two nations as well. An ongoing
spirit of allegiance and mutual respect
has characterized U.S.-Israeli relations
since the state's founding in 1949.
Over the years, this partnership has
served the vital interests of both coun
tries. As a tiny nation (approximately the
size of New Jersey) continually forced to
defend its mere existence, Israel depends
on U.S. assistance to maintain its mili
tary advantage and national security.
The willingness of Israel's Arab neigh
bors to resolve their differences at the
table rather than on the battlefield is
largely due to a resolute U.S. commit
ment to Israel's security. Recent develop
ments in the peace process, such as the
signing of the Oslo II agreement, suggest
that consistent American support gives
the Israelis the confidence they need to
continue to take risks for peace. In the
wake of Rabin's death, American backing
becomes even more critical to easing
Israeli uncertainties.

During the past 46 years, Israel has
been a loyal partner to the U.S., protect
ing American interests and advancing
democratic ideals. As the only democracy
in the Middle East and a long-standing
friend to the United States, Israel is a
vital ally in a volatile region of the world.
Our small financial investment in
Israel furthers domestic interests as
well. In this time of budget cutting and
reevaluating national priorities, there
has been much eagerness to put America
first. Yet, 73 percent of all foreign aid
dollars is actually spent right here at
home, boosting the U.S. economy. Aid to
Israel has greatly expanded the market
for U.S. exports, in turn creating jobs
and supporting U.S. businesses. Addi
tionally, shared technology and joint
research efforts (involving FDA drug
testing, biotechnology and defense con
version to name just a few) have saved
both nations time and money. Bringing
Israeli inventions into the American

marketplace directly benefits both
nations.
Though our monetary investment in
total foreign aid is modest, representing
only 0.9 percent of all government
spending, the social, political and eco
nomic returns are staggering.
Israel has been there for us, as a
strategic ally, an economic resource and
a political partner in pursuing regional
peace and stability. Now, in this time of
national tragedy in Israel, we must reit
erate our commitment to Israel as a
staunch ally, as a loyal friend. As we
mourn the death of Yitzhak Rabin, let us
reaffirm our support for that state
which he dedicated his life to serving,
and let us continue to promote the ideals
of peace for which he will always be
remembered.
