# Assistant to the President Fetter found Daily's edit to be misinformative
## 
### 
I have been a faithful reader of The
Daily for more than 20 years, and my
reactions to your articles and editorials
have ranged from admiration to dismay
This is only the second time that I have
written in formal protest. Both occa
sions have been prompted by unjustifi
able criticisms, and your editorial of Fri
day, Nov. 3 on "Elusive President" falls
into this category.
Mr. Casper makes considerable and
consistent efforts to meet and talk with

students, both informally and in sched
uled events. Since the beginning of this
quarter, for example, he has welcomed
freshmen and their parents, welcomed
international students, hosted a recep
tion for Orientation volunteers and new
students in Hoover House garden, par
ticipated in Junior Convocation, met
with the Council of Presidents, attended
the ASSU Senate and met with mem
bers of the senior class. Still ahead for
the quarter are Gaieties rehearsals and
performances, the Big Game rally, a
dinner with presidential scholars, lunch
with Daily editors and two bedtime sto
ries in the dorms.
While you are correct in understating
that the demands on Mr. Casper's time
are "undoubtedly substantial," the pre

ceding list can scarcely be characterized
as choices of "economic utility." The
example you cited about the 1995
Senior Gift table in White Plaza came
about by chance. Mr. Casper was walk
ing to a lunch meeting when a member
of the senior class asked if he would
help with the megaphone. He did. More
recently, he was similarly hailed from a
dorm window with an invitation to join
members of the house for dinner. He
did.
Yes, university presidents have con
siderable calls on their time, but Mr.
Casper has always placed students high
on his list of priorities, whether the
topic is undergraduate education or per
sonal contact. He took particular plea
sure during the last two years in teach

ing seminars through the Department
of Political Science. At the beginning of
this quarter, he asked Dean of Students
Marc Wais to explore more effective
ways of making contact with students
and time has already been held on Mr.
Casper's calendar for a number of meet
ings in the winter and spring quarters.
We would welcome creative and con
structive suggestions from anyone
about how to make the best use of Mr.
Casper's time in meeting Stanford's
14,000 undergraduate and graduate stu
dents. This is a non-trivial scheduling
problem and one that is not helped by
inaccurate charges of lack of effort by
the president.
