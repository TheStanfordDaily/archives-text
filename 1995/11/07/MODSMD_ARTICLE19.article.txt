# Countdown to election ’96
## 
### 
Are the Democrat«» dead? One year Irom now the American people will head to the polls and vote (or a new Congress and president. With the loss ol
Congress and numerous defections ol high-level officials Irom the party, the question turns not to if President Clinton can win re-election, but to
whether the Democrats themselves are in danger of being shut out and rendered irrelevant to the political process.

NOV. 8, 1994: the day of the rev
olution. America sent a mes
sage to Washington, D.C. that
penetrated the thick walls of the Capi
tol Building and reverberated into the
White House. Republicans across the
nation rejoiced. Many expected the
Democratic Party's obituary in the

next day's paper, but
it was not there —
nor will it be in 1996
either. No, the Demo
cratic Party is not
dead, and as a regis
tered Republican, I
say with all sincerity
that I hope it never
dies.
The November elec
tion revealed an ill

ness that worsens the further the
Democratic Party strays from the
mainstream. But far from killing the
Party, the election will hopefully be
the dose of unpleasant medicine
needed to return it to its previous
vision. Ignoring the voters' discon
tent, however, could send the
Democrats to their grave, and I urge
them to make the modifications
needed to survive. Consider this a
"get well" card to the Democratic
Party from a well-meaning Republi
can.
As someone who loves her country
and believes in the principles on
which it was founded, 1 realize the
inherent value of a plurality of opin
ions. I have faith that people with
divergent views can come together
and respectfully resolve their differ
ences. We can actually accomplish
more through teamwork. For exam
ple, our Constitution was born from
compromise. I hardly think that dele
gates from one state alone could have
formulated a document as brilliant as
the Constitution. It took representa
tives from every state. Their argu
ments, frustrations and conflicts pro
duced the "Supreme Law of the
Land."
Whv the history lesson, you ask?

Past experience has shown why a
plurality of opinions is important, so
why desire a monolithic political sys
tem today? Are we so arrogant to
believe that we have reached perfec
tion and no longer need challenges to
the status quo? Republicans rightly
celebrated the 1994 election; they
stormed Washington with the vote of
America behind them. It would be
wrong, however, to celebrate the
death of the Democratic Party. It
would be wrong to celebrate the
death of any organization that
expresses a political opinion differing
from our own.
Republicans are unapologetic
patriots. Jefferson, Paine, Alexander,
Washington and Franklin were
greats in American history; I cry
when our anthem plays at the
Olympics. We are stubborn in our
beliefs, but any Republican who
longs for the death of the Democratic
Party does not love democracy as
much as they might purport.
Do not take this as an endorse
ment of the Democratic Party, but I
can still recognize the value of views
contrary to my own. I know that one
of the prime reasons the U.S. is great
is due to people's differences. How
horrible if we all thought alike; this
campus would be dead without
debate and disagreement. Free
speech is protected for a reason —
there is an inherent value in plurali
ty-

The November election
revealed an illness that
worsens the further the
Democratic Party strays
from the mainstream.

Recognizing this value can be
extremely hard while listening to
views you passionately oppose. There
are times when I want to scream
"What is the matter with you!?" dur
ing a heated discussion with a Demo
cratic friend. I wonder from where
they derive their logic. Voters, too,
have questioned the Democrats' logic

and decided they did not agree with
the direction in which the party was
headed. Unsatisfied with the social
welfare programs, not trusting big
government solutions and seeking
relief from burdensome taxes, many
voters deserted in search of an alter
native. Maybe the Democrats' mis
take was not listening to the plurali
ty of opinions that exist within their
own party and instead pandering to
specific interest groups. For whatev
er reason, the majority of America
has decided that the Democratic
party no longer speaks for them, and
until the party addresses this prob
lem, it will be terminally ill. The
Republican Party can leai n from this
as well, lest we fail to represent and
encompass differing internal view
points.
Although 1 disagree with most of
the Democratic stance, 1 know that

both Republicans and Democrats
share a common goal. We both want
the U.S. to be a country of freedom,
equality and opportunity for all, but
we differ on the means to attain our
noble ends. I do not believe that the
Republicans have all the answers,
and we do not have a monopoly on
solutions for our country's ails. I
am sure that I have upset many
Republicans with my views, but we
need Democrats to confront us,
watch us and force us to examine
our held beliefs. Only after ques
tioning Republican principles our
selves can we be sure that our
actions are correct. If we are scared
of a challenge, how strongly, then,
do we believe in what we are doing?
I am confident enough in the
Republican Party to sincerely hope
for the continued existence of the
Democratic Party.

JUST BEAUSE DEMOCRATS lost their 40-year Con
gressional tenure in 1994 does not mean they have
been squeezed out of political power — no matter how
Newt Gingrich or the media portrays the Congressional
transformation. However, Democratic marginalization is
becoming increasingly obvious, as even Colin Powell
claims the Democratic Party's ideals are outdated. Presi
dent Clinton, though, still leads in most polls today. So
why even pose the question of Democratic marginaliza
tion?
The American public is not as much marginalizing the

donkey club as the party is marginalizing
"We The People." Possibly blinded by the
glory of day's past and continuing to hope
the New Deal's great-grandchildren will
continue following the footsteps of their
predecessors, the Democratic Party, in
general, continues its leflward movement
on the political spectrum. Oddly, the leftist
intensification comes at a time when more
Americans are happy to stand in the mid
dle of the road rather than cross over to
the left. However, Democratic marginal-

ization is not making way for a complete Republican con
quest.
Today, more Americans may be standing to the right of
the broken yellow line, but they still would rather be in the
middle of the road than cross to the curb on the right. The
morally imposing Christian Coalition can no longer guise
the Republican Party as pro-life. As the most vocal 30 per
cent (but still only 30 percent!) of the Republican Party
attempts to remain in grasp of its moral haven, it too is
marginalizing its constituents.
The splintering of the elephant's club is as obvious as
that of the former Yugoslavia. Even on campus, the opposi
tion has been symbolized by progressive movements to
change the Republican platform such as the Republican
Youth Majority.
The bilateral party marginalization of America acts as a
centripetal force with the middle of the political spectrum
pulling in most Americans. Colin Powell thus comes into
focus. Not only does he represent somebody new, but also
something new. He may lead one of the country's few
national political transformations. His carpool would drive
straight on the road rather than jump either side of the
curb, and since America cannot stand still forever, it will
join the carpool too.
The Democratic Party may be marginalized. However,
the Republican's yacht is only a sailboat's charade, as
demonstrated by splintering groups such as the Republican
Youth Majority. Therefore, I turn the pity towards the
marginalization of one political party into the people's
vengeance on both parties' stubbornness to change. I claim
America's two mainstream parlies have forced their guests
to leave because of the music selection they have decided to
play.
