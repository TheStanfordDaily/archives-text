## Law School fosters environment clinic 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
After two years of running it
out of the goodness of their hearts,
a group of Stanford law students
has received official recognition
and funding from the University
to run a clinic in East Palo Alto.
As of this quarter, the Commu
nity Environmental Project — a
program designed to help resi
dents fight for environmental
rights — is a formal part of the
Stanford Law School, with the
means to rent a new office and add
paid positions to the staff.
The project oversees the Envi
ronmental Justice Clinic, an office
in East Palo Alto where informa
tion and legal advice is provided to
residents on environmental is
sues. The clinic also offers law stu
dents the chance to receive course

credit for community work and de
velop courses in environmental
justice.
The clinic began two years ago
when a group of students interest
ed in environmental justice pro
posed to Law Prof. Barton Thomp
son a way to apply their concerns
to the local community. It now has
a staff of six students, both from
the Law School and elsewhere,
who are assisted by volunteers.
Law Prof. Flora Choo, co-direc
tor of the Community Environ
ment Project, defined "environ
mental justice" a.s redressing "the
phenomenon where communities
of color and low-income communi
ties are being asked to bear a
greater share of the environmen
tal burden."
Choo said that the clinic has a
preventative focus.
"We see our role as providing
technical and legal information ...
for communities to make deci
sions," she said.
Among the major issues the
clinic has worked with in East Palo
Alto is that of Romic Environmen
tal Technologies, which has operat
ed a solvent recycling plant there
since the 19505. Romic is applying
for permit renewal and expansion,
and this has raised concerns in the
community.
"Many residents are concerned
because they had accidents with
workers," said Vali Frank, a third
year law student who works at the
clinic. She cited one particular inci
dent where a worker was allegedly
"severely brain damaged" because

of an accident, and Romic was
fined for negligence. She also
referred to other "explosions and
fires" at the facility.
She went on to say that, until
their recent expansion, Romic has
never had to do a full environmen
tal impact report on the site.
In the case that is about to be
made, she said, the clinic will
"work with the community to
make sure that [the report] covers
the necessary areas."
The clinic is also a part of the
wide-scale Urban Environmental
Project which, Frank said, is work
ing on "educating and helping resi
dents with health risks in hous
ing," such as lead paint and house
hold chemicals.
The clinic also provides what
Frank called "compliance counsel
ing."
"We try to educate business cen
ters and worker groups about safe
ty issues and what they need to do

to comply with environmental
laws," she explained.
Choo added that the clinic was
helping out with problems related
to parts of East Palo Alto such as
the Ravenswood area that are in
need of development but have
extensive industrial contamina
tion. The contamination and
accompanying liability issues
obstruct development, she said.
Although it operates from with
in the Law School, students in
other disciplines are welcome tc
enroll in a course that involves
staffing the clinic, and much of
what they deal with does not have
a strictly legal focus.
"It was elesigned to be a multi
disciplinary clinic, because envi
ronmental issues are not single
discipline" issues, Choo said.
In addition to being responsible
for the clinic, the Community
Environmental Project has intro
duced new courses in related areas

at the Law School.
Choo said that next year they
would be adding a "perspectives
course" where students can study
the positions and actions of par
ties in environmental disputes,
and a "simulation" in which stu
dents can apply their skills to a
fictitious scenario in environmen
tal law.
She added that the project sus
tains many advantages from its
new status. Its full-time student
staff now earns course credit and
funding is more secure.
Choo listed the Law School, the
Federal Department of Education
and private foundations as sources
of funding. She said that major
expenses were salaries and rental
of their office, which is in the same
building as the School's East
Palo Alto Community Law Center.
The Clinic is still looking for vol
unteers. Interested students may
