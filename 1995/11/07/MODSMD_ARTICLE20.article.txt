# ON THE CONTRARY, DEMOCRATS MAY BE DOWN, BUT NOT OUT
## 
### 
Democrats may belong
to the oldest political party
in the world, but our values
and issues are fur from old-fash
ioned. Unless right-wing extrem
ism has somehow worked its way
into the political center of our
nation, the Democratic Pcirty still
represents mainstream American
thinking. When voters compare
traditional Democratic values to
the policies of Newt Gingrich and
Co., Democrats come out ahead.
Americans believe that our
nation must invest in education if
we are to compete in the global
economy. Republicans have voted to
cut student aid by over $10 billion
and made massive cuts to student
lunch and breakfast programs.
Americans believe that our
nation must protect its precious
environ mental resources. Republi
cans have voted to lift regulations
designed to keep arsenic out of our
water supply, allowed oil drilling in
the Arctic Wildlife Reserve, put
wetlands at risk and gut the
Endangered Species Act.
This clash between Newt's
agenda and America's values is
starting to erode support for the
Republican Party.
Americans believe that govern
ment should respect our right to
privacy. Republicans have voted
time and time again to end abor
tion rights and ban family plan
ning services.

shows Americans rejecting GOP
plans for Mtxdicare by a 57-26 per
cent margin. In a response to a
Washington Post questionnaire

(Oct. 1, 1995), 50
percent of respon
dents said they
would vote for a
Democratic can
didate and 43 per
cent said they
would vote for a
Republican one.
Just before the
big GOP victory
in 1994, both

parties were running about even.
And Newt Gingrich Ls more unpopu
kir than ever with 43 percent of
those responding to a Wall Street
Journal poll (Sept. 1995) giving him
negative ratings. This could explain
why he avoided public contact dur
ing his visit to San Jose last month.
But while these numbers add up
to potential electoral gains for the
Democratic Party, we cannot mid
should not depend on the unpopu
larity of Republicans to ensure our
success. Voters sent a wake-up call
in 1994 and we would be foolish to
ignore their concerns.
We need to rebuild and reshape
our party by articulating an agenda
that goes beyond simply opposing
the Gingrich agenda. I believe peo
ple will embrace us again if we
demonstrate that Democrats — in
addition to being pro-education,
pro-choice, pro-environment and
pro-family — am be trusted to
change the way Washington does
business. This means being out in
front on reforms, reforming the
campaign finance system, eliminat
ing gifts from lobbyists and improv-

ing lobbyist disclosure regulation.
It also means demonstrating
that we can be trusted on the all
important issue of fiscal responsi
bility — balancing the budget, but
in an equitable and compassionate
manner. I voted for a conservative
Democratic budget alternative that
does just that, balancing the bud

the solvency of Medicare's trust
fund by cutting $100 billion less
than the Republican proposal. It
also would have provided FULL
funding of student loans. I did not

agree with every provision in this
alternative budget, but I believe it
offers a vision of federal priorities
that better reflect America's val
ues.
No one should downplay the
extent of Democratic losses in
1994. The Democratic Party will be
revived only through the earned.
trust of the people — a trust built
on the timeless values of fairness
and moving our society forward
with all its citizens, and through
an efficient and compassionate
government.

ONE YEAR AGO this week,
Americans elected the first
Republican-controlled
Congress in 40 years. Now, one
year later, that Congress is turn
ing out to be one mean pig-in-the
poke.
The American people voted
last year for a change, no doubt
about it. But did anyone really
vote for this kind of change?
The new federal budget Repub
licans are trying to ram through
Congress right now cuts student
aid by one-third.
Sixty three percent of Stanford
students rely on federal grants
and loans to pay their tuition. You
think it's tough to afford Stan
ford now? Imagine what it would
be like if the Republicans in
Congress succeed in their plans to
cut one out of every three stu-

dent's federal-aid dollars.
Maybe such drastic cuts in
education don't matter to some
people. But for a lot of Stanford
students, slashing student aid
could mean switching from full
time to part time attendance. For
others, it could mean transferring
to a less expensive college. And for
still others, it could mean drop
ping out altogether.
The Republican cuts in educa
tion best exemplify the differ
ences between the two political
parties. It's also one of the rea
son's why, when voters go to the
polls next November, they will
elect more Democrats to office.
Americans have mixed feelings
about the Democratic Party these
days, but most American still sup
port the Democratic agenda. Con
sider the differences:
• Most Americans believe that if
you work hard and get good
grades, you ought to be able to go
to college, no matter how much
money your parents make.
Democrats are committed to pre
serving student aid. The Republi
can budget cuts it.
• Most Americans want to pre
serve the environmental progress
we've made over the past 25
years. The extreme, right-wing
Republicans in Congress want to
turn the clock back. Not only do
they want to gut the federal Clean

Air Act and Clean Water Act, but
their regulatory "reform" bill
would also allow companies to
release toxic chemicals into the

people who live near the plants.
• Republicans also want to open
up the National Wildlife

newest national park, established
in the Mohave Desert last year.
Democrats are defending these
natural resources.
• Most Americans are pro-choice.
The extreme, right-wing Republi
cans in Congress want to outlaw
abortion.
• Most Americans think big
money special interests wield too
much influence in Washington
already. The Republicans in
Congress have given them even
more power. Instead of just influ
encing bills, big-industry lobbies
are writing bills in the Republi
can-controlled Congress.
Republicans also say they want
a balanced budget. It is one sub
ject where both parties agree.
However, there is a right way and
wrong way to balance the budget.
In the 1980s, under Republi
can presidents, the federal deficit
exploded from about $300 billion
to more than $3 trillion. But in
1993, Democrats in Congress and
President Clinton signed a seven
year deficit reduction plan leading
to the following results:
• This year, for the third time in a
row, the deficit is going down.
That hasn't happened since
Harry Truman was President.
• The number of workers on the
federal payroll is smaller than
when President Kennedy was in
the White House.
• More than seven million new
jobs have been created in the pri-

cutting education, job training,
environmental protection and a
whole range of other priorities
that are critical to our long-term
economic well-being.
Why are they making all these
cuts? One reason — to give more
tax cuts to the wealthiest individ
uals and corporations in Ameri
ca.
That's not what Americans
voted for last November. And
next year, when voters go back to
the polls, they're going to reject
the people who are pushing this
extreme "contract" — because
the Democratic agenda is still
America's agenda.
