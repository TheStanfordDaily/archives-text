THE DEMOCRATS DEAD? Hell no!
We're alive and well! What about 1994,
you ask? Is it just a fluke? Is the Demo
cratic Party ready to come roaring back in 1996?
Not exactly.

We're not going to sugar
coat the fact that we were
spanked by the conservative
movement. After all, if any
party is in touch with reality
here, it's us. So where are the
Democrats and where are we
headed?
Democrats are confused,
disheartened and disillu
sioned, but dead we certainly
are not. Now is the time for

the party to reaffirm its values. Only if we
revisit what it means to be a Democrat can we
reassert our vision for the future. So pack
your bags — we're going on a trip.
Eirst stop — progressive social policy. Since
FDR's New Deal, Democrats have always
believed in the value of the social safety net.

Bill Shen and Maria Bleavins are the co
chairs of Stanford Democrats. Both are sopho
mores majoring in public policy.

Compassion, good economic sense and basic
responsibility anchor our support for Demo
cratic social programs. Where would America
be without the Democrat-initiated programs
of Social Security, Medicare and — yes —
AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Chil
dren)? These programs have kept millions of
elderly and children, the most vulnerable
Americans, out of poverty.

We don't claim to know the
cure for our social ills, but
the government cannot turn
its back on its people.

We don't claim to know the cure for our
social ills, but the government cannot turn its
back on its people. A country with increased
stratification between classes finds itself
unable to move forward without a progressive
social policy. It seems that even many
Democrats find themselves doubting the neces
sity of these programs as a result of the contin
ual onslaught of Republican extremist rhetoric.

Hut we ask, "Whose proposals make sense?"
Second stop — fiscal policy. The new
Republican budget plans to cut student aid,
Medicaid and food stamps in the name of bal-

ancing the budget. If the
budget must be balanced,
why does it propose to cut
taxes? We're all for tax cuts
as long as the burden of bud
get cuts is shared equally.
The same Republican budget
has half of its tax cuts going
to families making over
$100,000 a year while rais
ing taxes for families making
less than $30,000. Simply

put, the economy is stronger than it's been in
decades. Unemployment is below the norm,
inflation is low and productivity is high. Eco
nomic indicators tell us that Clinton and the
Democrats have been doing their jobs. We
have much to be proud of.
Third stop — the nation's environment.
Though there's been an effort to shut down
this stop on our tour, Democrats are still work
ing to preserve America's natural resources.

Bleavins
We recognize the fine line which
exists between the economy and thr
environment, mid we understand
that the two are far from mutually
exclusive. We are committed to
seeking the critical balance between
business and the earth which sus
tains us.
Last stop — mainstream Ameri
ca. Iyxjking for Ralph Re<d and the
Christian Coalition? Keep looking.
These right-wing zealots have
hijacked the Republican Party and
are dragging it and America
towards a perfect world of homo
geneity. The Democratic Party con
tinues to defend and protect the
rights of all Americans. A woman's

right to choose, religious freedom
and access to higher education —
we believe that these are the beliefs
of mainstream America, not the
divisive and non-inclusionary tac
tics of the far Right.
Now that we've reflected upon
the beliefs of our party, let's try to
figure our where we n* going. In
light of the outlandish proposals the
majority in Congress is putting
forth, and so long as we stand by our
convictions, the Democratic Party
ideals will survly resonate with the
American voter again. If the Repub
lican proposals succeed in our com
mon goal of a better America, then
we will be Ix'tu-r for it. Hut iftheend
result doesn't satisfy the intention,
the voters will hold Republicans
accountable. Whatever the case
may I**, we cannot stray 112 rom what
we believe in.
