## Men's golf swings high 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
In the friendly surroundings
of the Farm, the Stanford men's
golf team finally got on track this
season, obliterating 15 other
teams last weekend to take the
title at the Stanford Fall Invita
tional.
The Cardinal won its first
tournament in three attempts
thus far this season by posting
a team score of 847 and outpac
ing second-place Kansas by 30
strokes in the two-day, 54-hole
event.
"It was definitely the best
tournament we've played so far
this season as a team," said
junior Conrad Hay. "We're all
really excited about it.
"It was the first time that the
everybody has played well. Usu
ally, we have a few guys doing
well, a few doing not so well, but
we all came together to play good,
consistent golf this weekend."
Stanford golfers crowded the
top of the leader board as the
Cardinal captured four of the top
eight spots. Much to the delight
of the large gallery assembled,
sophomore All-American Tiger
Woods won the individual title
with a seven-under-par 206.
Freshman Joel Kribel matched
Woods nearly stroke for stroke,
finishing only one shot back at
207.
Ray rode a sparkling first
round 66 to place fifth overall
and post the best performance of
his collegiate career. Senior cap
tain Jerry Chang recovered from
a rough second round by firing a
third-round 72 en route to his tie
for seventh. Freshman Scott
Wang struggled after a solid first
round to finish in a tie for 53rd.
"I just couldn't find my
rhythm," Wang said. "There was
a little pressure with it being my
first varsity tournament, but for
the most part, it was just an off
day."
Stanford was coming off a dis
appointing sixth-place outing a
week earlier at the Olympic Invi
tational in San Francisco. Any-

one expecting to see a repeat per
formance was surprised early as
the squad leapt out to seize the
lead with a phenomenal first
round. The team shot a tourna
ment-low 275, averaging more
than a stroke under par for each
player. Most telling was the fact
Wang's first-round 74, which
would normally make the four
scores that count toward the
team total, was Stanford's worst

score of the round by four
strokes.
"We really got some good
scores on the board early," Wang
said. "I think it really helped us
to get some momentum."
Home-course advantage fur
ther aided the Cardinal's produc
tion.
"I don't think that it played a
huge factor, but our familiarity
with the course definitely helped
us," Ray said. "We had an advan
tage in that we knew what the
course has to offer and what to
expect. The comfort level was
probably a bit higher for us too."

In addition, the team drew
strength from the friendly sup
port offered by the home crowd.
While a large crowd is typical of
any Woods appearance, a good
number of the spectators were
genuinely enthused to see the
team as a whole play well.
"The success of the team in
the past few years has contribut
ed a lot to the following we have
now," Ray said. "A lot of people
want to see just how good we
really will be this year. It gets you
sort of pumped up because it
shows that people really care
about the team."
