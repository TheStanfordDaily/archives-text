I Santa Clara 2
Stanford 0

The Stanford men's soccer team (5-11-1 overall, 2-4-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) fell 2-0 Sunday
night at Ruck Shaw stadium to No. 16 Santa Clara (11-

2-2, 3-1-1 West Coast Conference). The Broncos struck
quickly, scoring both of their goals in the first half.
Stanford head coach Colin Lindores acknowledged
that the Broncos deserve their ranking. "They win
games on a regular basis," he said. "The games are not
entertaining, but the ranking is not based on style
points. What matters is who has the most goals at the
end of the game. They will probably be invited to the
NCAA tournament."
In its last home game of the season, Santa Clara
honored the five seniors on its squad with a win. Senior
Brian Boesiger chose the perfect match to chip in his
first goal of the season. Senior
Mike Lynch unleashed a shot that
Boesiger knocked in off the
rebound.
Santa Clara sophomore Chris
Wilson completed the scoring with
a long shot from the left corner of
the goal box.
The Cardinal's best scoring
opportunities occurred late in the
game when sophomore Shan
Gaw caromed a shot off the right
post. Senior Steve Kirschbaum
settled the ball and knocked it
again off the same post. Senior
co-captain Carmen D'Onofrio
rebounded the shot, but Bronco
goalkeeper Joe Cannon managed
to get the save.
Cannon recorded his fifth
shutout of the season. The shutout
will lower his already impressive
0.71 goals-against average.
"(The game was] traditional
Stanford-versus-Santa Clara,"
Lindores said. "They created
opportunities and put them away.
We did not."
