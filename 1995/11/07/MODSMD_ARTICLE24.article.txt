# Free agency costing sports fans a bundle
## 
### 
Don't get me wrong. I
love sports, but some
times sports make me
sick to my stomach. At the
same time the athletics world
makes me the happy, go-lucky
kid that 1 am, it also causes me
to rip off the skin of my scalp
and jump up and down in
aconv. Whv is that, you ask?

Is it because of the prover
bial "joy of victory and agony
of defeat?" Or is it because
sports is life and life's just
screwy that way? Maybe.
Those and a slew of other rea
sons could be the source of my
dilemma.
But the most recent reason
why sports has been a double
edged sword plunged into my
belly is due to two words:
"free" and "agency." At the
same time that I recognize the
virtues and necessity of free
agency, especially in a busi

ness-oriented, multi-billion
dollar industry like sports, 1
wish for the more idyllic days
of my childhood — days when
you felt safe to root for a team
along with its players because
you knew that the whole team
would always stick together.
All that's changed, however.
It started off slowly. I remem
ber the stir when the Washing
ton Redskins signed the Chica
go Bears' Pro-Bowl linebacker
Wilbur Marshall as a free
agent. The 'Skins literally gave
up half their team, their entire
practice squad and three-quar
ters of their future to obtain
Marshall. The Marshall plan
caused quite an uproar around
the league. People gasped at
the thought of a player chang
ing teams because of free agen
cy. But little did the NFL know
that Wilbur was just the tip of
the iceberg.
Baseball was an entirely dif
ferent story — at least early
on. With a stronger union, the
MLBPA was able to attain free
agency rights over a decade
before most of the other sports
. . . and without a salary cap to
boot! I still remember being
amazed by the blockbuster
signings of players like Carlton
Fisk, Dave Winfield, Andre


Daniel
Kao
Dawson and Barry Bonds. Little
did I know that the NBA and NFL
would follow suit.
The Reggie White supersigo
ing opened the doors for "free
trade" in the National Football
League. As a Cowboy fan, I still
cringe when free agency is men
tioned. Ken Norton defecting to
the Niners. Over half the offen
sive line gone just like that
because of free enterprise. Alvin
Harper signing with the Bucs.
The list goes on and on.
But that's what it's come down
to. The world of professional
sports is one-half team talent and
one-half team management. I
wholeheartedly sympathize and
understand the players' need to
market themselves. After all,
that's what America's all about,
right? Each player supplies his

own skills and each owner
demands the talent. Basic free
market economics.
That still doesn't lessen the
hurt any when favorite players
leave favorite teams. I long ago
decided against following a
favorite NBA team for this very
reason. Who knows when your
favorite player would switch
teams? And in the case of a five
on-five sport like hoops, one man
does make a difference.
My fears have already been
realized early on this season with
two players, Dennis Hodman and
Alonzo Mourning. Will Perdue
just doesn't quite make me jis big
a Spurs fan as the Worm. Same
applies with Mourning. Zo was
the only reason I followed the
Hornets, so when he moved on to
the Heat, I sure as hell wasn't
sticking around.
In both these cases, even
though the acquisition of these
superstar players was not
through a free-agency signing per

se, but by a trade, everyone knew
that the trade was made because
of free agency. If a player's going
to leave next year no matter what,
like in the cases of Rodman and
Mourning, you might as well ship
him off and get as much as you
can out of him.
We even see some of this play
er instability in college athletics.
With the lure of big money,
underclassmen defections are a
dime a dozen. It doesn't appear if
any place is safe from the clutches
of player free agency.
The only question is what
now? Free agency is a must. It
might not be fair to owners and
especially fans, but it's the only
fair thing for players.
The answer is to grin and bear
it as I've had to do and just tack
this whole free agency thing on
the wall of life's of "unfairness"
(along with the 20 zillion other
things up there) because sports is
life, and life's just screwy that
way.

decided against following a
favorite NBA team for this very
reason. Who knows when your
favorite player would switch
teams? And in the case of a five
on-five sport like hoops, one man
does make a difference.
My fears have already been
realized early on this season with
two players, Dennis Hodman and
Alonzo Mourning. Will Perdue
just doesn't quite make me jis big
a Spurs fan as the Worm. Same
applies with Mourning. Zo was
the only reason I followed the
Hornets, so when he moved on to
the Heat, I sure as hell wasn't
sticking around.
In both these cases, even
though the acquisition of these
superstar players was not
through a free-agency signing per

se, but by a trade, everyone knew
that the trade was made because
of free agency. If a player's going
to leave next year no matter what,
like in the cases of Rodman and
Mourning, you might as well ship
him off and get as much as you
can out of him.
We even see some of this play
er instability in college athletics.
With the lure of big money,
underclassmen defections are a
dime a dozen. It doesn't appear if
any place is safe from the clutches
of player free agency.
The only question is what
now? Free agency is a must. It
might not be fair to owners and
especially fans, but it's the only
fair thing for players.
The answer is to grin and bear
it as I've had to do and just tack
this whole free agency thing on
the wall of life's of "unfairness"
(along with the 20 zillion other
things up there) because sports is
life, and life's just screwy that
way.
