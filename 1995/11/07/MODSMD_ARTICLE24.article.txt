# Free agency costing sports fans a bundle
## 
### 
Don't get me wrong. I
love sports, but some
times sports make me
sick to my stomach. At the
same time the athletics world
makes me the happy, go-lucky
kid that 1 am, it also causes me
to rip off the skin of my scalp
and jump up and down in
aconv. Whv is that, you ask?

Is it because of the prover
bial "joy of victory and agony
of defeat?" Or is it because
sports is life and life's just
screwy that way? Maybe.
Those and a slew of other rea
sons could be the source of my
dilemma.
But the most recent reason
why sports has been a double
edged sword plunged into my
belly is due to two words:
"free" and "agency." At the
same time that I recognize the
virtues and necessity of free
agency, especially in a busi

ness-oriented, multi-billion
dollar industry like sports, 1
wish for the more idyllic days
of my childhood — days when
you felt safe to root for a team
along with its players because
you knew that the whole team
would always stick together.
All that's changed, however.
It started off slowly. I remem
ber the stir when the Washing
ton Redskins signed the Chica
go Bears' Pro-Bowl linebacker
Wilbur Marshall as a free
agent. The 'Skins literally gave
up half their team, their entire
practice squad and three-quar
ters of their future to obtain
Marshall. The Marshall plan
caused quite an uproar around
the league. People gasped at
the thought of a player chang
ing teams because of free agen
cy. But little did the NFL know
that Wilbur was just the tip of
the iceberg.
Baseball was an entirely dif
ferent story — at least early
on. With a stronger union, the
MLBPA was able to attain free
agency rights over a decade
before most of the other sports
. . . and without a salary cap to
boot! I still remember being
amazed by the blockbuster
signings of players like Carlton
Fisk, Dave Winfield, Andre
