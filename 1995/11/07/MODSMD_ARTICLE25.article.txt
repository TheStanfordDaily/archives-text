Stanford's field hockey team
(8-6 overall, 5-1 Northern Pacif
ic Conference) finally secured an
NCAA playoff berth by defeat
ing California (4-8, 4-2) 1-0 in
the final round of the Western
Collegiate Field Hockey Cham
pionships last weekend, con
firming once and for all who
reigns as the best team in the
NorPac.
The Western Collegiate event
actually serves as a prototype
for the tournament that will
determine the NorPac champi
on in the future. The confer
ence, which now includes only
Pacific, Cal and Stanford, awaits
the official admittance of UC-
Davis, UC-Santa Barbara and
Santa Clara, currently club
teams, as Division I field hockey
teams. Until then, the tourna
ment pits all six squads against
one another for practice and to
cap off the season.
Hosted by Stanford this
year, the tourney began last

Friday with the Aggies beating
the Gauchos and the Tigers
downing the Broncos. The top
two teams, Cal and Stanford,
received first-round byes.

Freshman Sarah Medeiros accelerates towards a loose ball ear
lier this season versus Pacific.
Stanford and Shellie Onstead of
California, gathered for a confer
ence call to decide which school
would advance to the NCAA play
offs.
"Eight criteria were used to
decide who was the stronger
team, and it was decided that
Stanford [met] more of the crite
ria,"said senior tri-captain Elise
Morgan.
The Cardinal led the Stanford-
Cal series in conference play. Cal
won the first matchup 1-0 early in
the season, but then Stanford
took the following two contests 2-

0 and 1-0. However, the Bears
dominated the Cardinal 4-0 in
last week's NorPac championship
game.
"There was [a question of who
advances] just because of how the
game went last Wednesday," Mor
gan said. "We didn't play nearly
as well then as we played | last
Saturday]. There was miscommu
nication about what the game
meant to us as opposed to what it
meant to [Cal. 1 "
The Cardinal had previously
believed that conference records
would determine the advancing
team, but the Hears clung to the
argument that their 4-0 thrash
ing of Stanford in the NorPac
championship game warranted
consideration.

Ultimately, Stanford won the
privilege, but entering Saturday's
matches, it had something to
prove to the league.
The Cardinal began the morn
ing against Davis, edging the
Aggies out 1-0. Later that morn
ing, Cal beat Pacific 4-0. With
that win, the Bears would face
nemesis Stanford once again.
The fifth and final matchup of
the year between the Cardinal
and the Bears was one of aggres
sion and high emotion. The disap
pointed Bears took out their fi us
trations on Stanford with
extremely physical play.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal tal
ent shined through the unsports
manlike conduct and Stanford tri
umphed over the Bears.
