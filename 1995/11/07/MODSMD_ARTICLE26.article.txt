# Women's volleyball prepares for Bears after clinching title
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
Coming off' its earliest clinch
ing of the Pacific 10 Conference
title in school history, the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball team
(22-2 overall, 15-0 Pac-10) looks
to stay focused tonight in its sec
ond match of the season against
California (11-13, 4-11), which
will start at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
"It's a nice goal to have out of
the way," said Stanford coach
Don Shaw in regard to winning
the conference crown. "We've
just tried to stay above the may
hem of the conference this season
and we managed to do a good job
of it."
The Cardinal improved its play
dramatically last week despite the
fact that it entered the week with
16 consecutive victories. After
defeating No. 15 Pacific, No. 27
Washington and No. 9 Washing

ton State, that winning streak
now stands at 19.
"When I woke up Monday
morning [last week J and saw the
teams on our schedule, I thought

'Considering the
team they brought
back from last year,
Sue Woodstra is do
ing a great job.'
â€” Don Shaw

it was going to be a scary week,"
Shaw said. "Those are three
teams that are capable of beating
you and, with very little time for
preparation, we were able to han
dle them all pretty easily."
According to Shaw, Stanford's
ability to sideout and play tough

defense allowed the Cardinal to
overcome its lack of preparation.
"We're playing really well right
now," Shaw said.
With the conference champi
onship under his belt, Shaw will
use his team's remaining four
matches to rest his squad and add
a few new wrinkles to an already
potent attack.
"We need to rest some people
and let them catch up on their
schoolwork," Shaw said. "Hope
fully, we can let them get ahead
with papers and assignments
because December will be a hectic
month for us with the [NCAA]
tournament."
When starters do play, howev
er, Shaw will work with them to
"add some things" into the Cardi
nal's offensive and defensive
schemes that might prove useful
against particular teams in the
NCAA tournament.
