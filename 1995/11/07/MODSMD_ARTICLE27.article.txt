# Stanford sailors discover smooth waters down south at UCSB's Women's, Frosh/Soph regattas
## Women record first- and second-place finishes as youth completes the Cardinal sweep 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
Racking up the wins this week
end down in Santa Barbara, the
Stanford sailing team continued
its dominance over its district,
returning home once again as the
unquestionable victor. Not only
did the Cardinal capture first
place in both the Frosh/Soph
regatta and the Women's Fall
Championships hosted by UC-
Santa Barbara, but it succeeded
in securing second in each as well.
The talented and experienced
team of junior Alice Mannard
and sophomore Heather Rogers
clenched the top spot in the
Women's Fall Championships.
Mannard and Rogers entered the
regatta as the favorites and suc
cessfully measured up to their
distinguished reputation, win
ning 11 of their 16 races. Fresh
men Taylor Robinson and Jessica
Knape, who blew California's
first boat out of the water, fol
lowed right behind their victori
ous teammates, putting Stanford
atop the standings by 20 points.
"We sailed against the best
women's teams in our district,"
said head coach Steve Bourdow.
"I was impressed with Mannard
and Rogers finishing first in 11
races, but I was even more
impressed with how solidly

Robinson and Knape sailed. Not
only did they place well, but more
importantly, they sailed well as a
team."
Normally, Stanford does not
face much noteworthy competition
in its women's regattas, but the
skill level has improved this year.
"Cal recruited three talented fresh
men, and for awhile they worried
us," Bourdow said. "But with skip
pers like Mannard and Robinson
sailing as well as they have been,
Cal doesn't stand a chance."
In the Frosh/Soph regatta,
freshmen Steve Kleha and Adri
enne Stolz took an unchallenged

first, winning over 80 percent of
their races. Freshmen Tyler
Doyle and Jennifer Cromwell fin
ished second. Sophomores Jeff
Graves and Meghan Higgins
came in eighth.
"Conditions at UCSB were
great," Bourdow said. "They have
the potential to be brutal, but
both Saturday and Sunday were
beautiful, sunny and windy."
In each regatta, Stanford
improved both its consistency
and its speed. "We were conserva
tive and fast, a rarely beatable
combination," Bourdow said.
If Stanford can maintain its
consistency, conservation and
speed, it will undoubtedly contin
ue its dominance in its district
and uphold its reputation as the
team to beat on the West Coast.
