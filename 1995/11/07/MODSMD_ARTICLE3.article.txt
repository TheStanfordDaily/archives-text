# Kaddish for slain peacemaker
## Hundreds gather in White Plaza to mourn loss of Yitzhak Rabin 
### Joe El Rady 
Students, staff, professors and clergy
came from both on and off campus yes
terday to honor the memory of Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a man
who symbolized the new hope for peace
in the Middle East.
A crowd of several hundred mourners
gathered in White yesterday at
noon to attend the brief memorial ser
vice organized by the Israeli Student As
sociation and the Hillel Foundation.
Most of the mourners stood silently
throughout the half-hour service. Many
focused their eyes on the ground while
tears trickled down their cheeks.
University Provost Condoleezza Rice
spoke poignantly about the fallen prime
minister. "This is a time of tremendous
sorrow," Rice said.
During some speeches, Rice said,
Rabin made a practice of listing the
names of Israelis who had died as part of
the stiuggle for peace. "He himself can
now be added to the names of those who
have died for peace," she said.
Junior Gil Rabinovici, a member of
the Israeli Student Association, echoed
Rice's sentiments. "The assassin's bullet
killed more than just Yitzhak Rabin,"
Rabinovici said. "It is a symptom of a so
ciety deeply divided, of intolerance for
brothers holding different viewpoints."
As Rabinovici said, the attendees

came to honor not only a courageous
leader, but also an ideal. They paid
homage to the peace that Rabin labored
to achieve and to decry the forces that
would thwart his efforts.
Rabin was assassinated on Saturday
after speaking at a peace rally in Tel
Aviv. Israeli police are holding a right
wing Israeli law student as the prime
suspect.
Aaron Lehman, senior class president
and former president of the Jewish Stu
dent Association, emphasized the need
for continued support of the peace
process. "We must forge ahead in the
name of Yitzhak Rabin and all who have
died for peace," he said.
Lehman went on to read portions of
the speech which Rabin delivered mo
ments before he was attacked. Attendees
at yesterday's service then sang "Shir la
Shalom," the "song of peace" that pro
vided the concluding words at the peace
rally Rabin spoke at Saturday. A copy of
the lyrics to that song, soaked with blood
and pierced by a bullet, was found in
Rabin's pocket and read at his funeral in
Israel.
Junior Seth Yoskowitz, president of
the Synagogue Board, led the crowd in a
kaddish, the Hebrew prayer for the
dead. A moment of silence, punctured by
sobs, followed the blessing. The service
