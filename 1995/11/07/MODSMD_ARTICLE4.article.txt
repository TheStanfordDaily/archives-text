# Richards brings down-home rhetoric to campus
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Sporting her trademark Lone Star pin and no
holds-barred rhetoric, former Texas Gov. Ann
Richards exhorted a receptive Memorial Auditorium
audience to fight against the current right-wing tide of
national politics.
"It's a lunatic time in this country, and you guys
have got to speak out," the Democratic Party activist
said in an address sponsored by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau and Stanford in Government and attended by
approximately 800 people. "When people are prejudi
cial . . . you have my permission to get in their face."
Richards, who served as governor from 1991 to
1993, first attracted national attention at the 1988 De
mocratic National Convention when she said that
then vice President George Bush was "born with a sil
ver foot in his mouth."
As irascible last night as ever, she opened her
speech by promising: "I worked real hard on this
speech.... There's something here to offend every
one."
Mainly, though, her more offensive remarks were
directed at conservative media figures, Republican
politicians and right-wing groups.
The national debate should be about why stan
dards of living are stagnating while the economy and
corporate profits are growing, Richards said.
Instead, she said, the dominant political discussion
is of the divisive variety forwarded by politicians like
Pat Buchanan.
"Right now, people are looking for someone to
blame for everything from my ingrown toenail to
Bosnia," she said.
"Who ever thought that the voice of moderation in
the Republican Party would be Barry Goldwater?"
Richards asked rhetorically. "Instead of trying to
make the public conform to some fantasy ... let's
make sure people have jobs so that they can keep their

families together."
"The message we need to be get
ting from our government is that
we're stronger when we work
together than when we pull apart ,"
she said.
Richards attacked GOP plans
for rolling back the responsibili
ties of government, noting that
the budget currently on its way to
passage is full of cuts for pro
grams benefiting those who ain't
— or don't — vote, such as the
young and the poor. She pointed
out, however, that cuts to such
programs will hurt more than
those immediately affected.
"I don't want to get started on
this budget, because it's just a
joke," she said. "I hope it's obvi

"I really and truly believe that
these people are zealots, t hat they
have a mission [and] it's all writ
ten out in that contract," she said.
"It's getting tougher and tougher
to see where the mainstream ends
and the lunatic fringe begins."
Richards was particularly viru
lent in her attacks on right-wing
media figures who, she said, wield
tremendous power without ever
subjecting themselves to the
scrutiny of an election campaign.
"A lot of times, the people at
the top know more than the talk
show hosts," she said.
"Responsible journalism is not,
I think, an oxymoron," she said.
"But it is becoming a quaint and
rather elitist notion."
Richards holds those engaging
in such demagoguery at least par
tially responsible for the Okla
homa City bombing.

"There is a price to pay for call
ing the government the enemy,"
she said.
"They are corrosive, they are
an acid eating away at the ties
that bind us together as a
nation," she said of far-right
media figures and political opera
tives.
Richards likened the current
political climate to that which
existed a century ago. At that
time, she said, there was great
concern about the development of
an undereducated permanent
underclass. There was a large
amount of anti-immigrant senti
ment and great concern about
drug abuse. A third political party
seemed more viable than ever
before. The country seemed to be
splitting apart, "and guess what,"
she said, "there was an angry
white male backlash."
"In the words of that great
political philosopher, Yogi Berra,

'It's deja vu all over again,' " she
said.
Nonetheless, Richards noted,
as an outgrowth of that unrest,
the progressive movement gained
steam and resulted in the passage
of legislation like that giving
women the right to vote.
"We can look back and see 1995
as a new beginning if we work for
it," she said. "It's not the future
that's the challenge, it's our abili
ty to make the most of it."
The Republican Party was able
to make such significant gains in
the previous election, Richards
said, because of its ability to keep
voters aligned despite their small
ideological differences. In the
Democratic Party, she said, vot
ers unhappy with particular posi
tions tend not to vote.
"Be sure you get your voice
heard on the issues that matter to
you most, but for God's sake,
vote," she said.
