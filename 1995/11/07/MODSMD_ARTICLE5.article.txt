## Law students campaign for rights of prisoners 
### Curtis Sittenfeld 
When Lauren Leslie sent holi
day greeting cards to 50 inmates
at Pelican Bay State Prison in De
cember 1994, she did not realize
that the gesture would change the
trajectory of her law school experi
ence.
"I just wrote, 'There are people
out here who care about you. Keep
your spirits up,' " Leslie said. Near
ly a year later, she is still corre
sponding with almost all the men.
The overwhelming response of
the inmates led Leslie, a second
year student at the Law School, to
seek out other students concerned
about the human rights violations
which occur regularly in U.S. pris
ons. This fall, Leslie and Tara
Mulay, another second-year law
student, have formally founded
Stanford Students for Prisoners'
Rights (SSPR).
Leslie's initial interest in prison
ers' rights stemmed from an article
she read in the Office of Career Ser
vices, when she was beginning a job
search for last summer. The article,
printed in the progressive National
Lawyers Guild, led Leslie to the
Pelican Bay Information Project,
an organization which holds meet
ings in San Francisco.
Through the organization,
Leslie became aware that a dispro
portionate number of inmates at

Pelican Bay — a maximum security
prison near the Oregon border —
were forced to spend 23 hours a day
alone in windowless cells.
"It's my own personal night
mare," said Leslie, who suffers
from claustrophobia. "It's like
being buried alive."
For Mulay, prisoners' rights be
came a priority when she was in col
lege. "I worked in a maximum secu
rity prison, tutoring," Mulay said.
Among the injustices Mulay
learned about were the racism and
brutality of the guards, the lack of a
support system for prisoners who
receive parole and the discrimina
tion involved in placing prisoners in
isolation.
"Prisoners are moved [into iso
lation] under shady circum
stances," Mulay said. "There's dis
crimination against jail-house
lawyers, people who advocate for
themselves and other prisoners,
who communicate with people on
the outside about prison condi
tions."
Prison administrators single out
such inmates and label them, often
falsely, as "gang-affiliated" or
"gang-identified," Mulay said. The
label then allows the administra
tors to send the inmate into isola
tion for an indefinite period.
