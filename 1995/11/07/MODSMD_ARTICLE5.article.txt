# You don't ask them what they're in for'
## Law students campaign for rights of prisoners 
### Curtis Sittenfeld 
When Lauren Leslie sent holi
day greeting cards to 50 inmates
at Pelican Bay State Prison in De
cember 1994, she did not realize
that the gesture would change the
trajectory of her law school experi
ence.
"I just wrote, 'There are people
out here who care about you. Keep
your spirits up,' " Leslie said. Near
ly a year later, she is still corre
sponding with almost all the men.
The overwhelming response of
the inmates led Leslie, a second
year student at the Law School, to
seek out other students concerned
about the human rights violations
which occur regularly in U.S. pris
ons. This fall, Leslie and Tara
Mulay, another second-year law
student, have formally founded
Stanford Students for Prisoners'
Rights (SSPR).
Leslie's initial interest in prison
ers' rights stemmed from an article
she read in the Office of Career Ser
vices, when she was beginning a job
search for last summer. The article,
printed in the progressive National
Lawyers Guild, led Leslie to the
Pelican Bay Information Project,
an organization which holds meet
ings in San Francisco.
Through the organization,
Leslie became aware that a dispro
portionate number of inmates at

Pelican Bay — a maximum security
prison near the Oregon border —
were forced to spend 23 hours a day
alone in windowless cells.
"It's my own personal night
mare," said Leslie, who suffers
from claustrophobia. "It's like
being buried alive."
For Mulay, prisoners' rights be
came a priority when she was in col
lege. "I worked in a maximum secu
rity prison, tutoring," Mulay said.
Among the injustices Mulay
learned about were the racism and
brutality of the guards, the lack of a
support system for prisoners who
receive parole and the discrimina
tion involved in placing prisoners in
isolation.
"Prisoners are moved [into iso
lation] under shady circum
stances," Mulay said. "There's dis
crimination against jail-house
lawyers, people who advocate for
themselves and other prisoners,
who communicate with people on
the outside about prison condi
tions."
Prison administrators single out
such inmates and label them, often
falsely, as "gang-affiliated" or
"gang-identified," Mulay said. The
label then allows the administra
tors to send the inmate into isola
tion for an indefinite period.
With regard to being freed from
isolation, Leslie explained, the
"snitch, parole or die" rule
applies: "You have to snitch on
someone else, you parole out or
you die there."
"People treat prisoners as if
they don't have civiJ rights any
more," said Mulay, adding that
the issue is an example of the "out
of sight, out of mind" proverb.
Both Mulay and Leslie realize
that because prisoners are convict
ed criminals, many Americans
believe they should be "out of
mind." Said Leslie, "I get asked,
'Why are you advocating for people
who have committed heinous
crimes when you could be saving
children who are starving some
where?' But it's precisely because
prisoners are viewed as the cast
aways of our society — that's what
draws me to them even more."
Working with prisoners "is a
challenge to us. We should want to
know why a person can't function
in this society, what it is about
this society," she said.
In her letters to prisoners,
Leslie said, she does not ask them
about their crimes. "I don't make
moral judgments about what they
did to get into prison. There's an
etiquette when corresponding.
You don't ask them what they're

in for."
Helping people who may have
committed atrocities "is not a big
conflict for me," said Leslie. "And
it's not like I've never been a vic
tim of crime."
Mulay also has been a victim of
crime but remains staunch in her
belief that prisoners deserve bet
ter treatment. "I don't think vic
tims' rights and prisoners' rights
are in conflict," she said. "Defi
nitely there should be resources
A lot of prisoners are
victims of crime
before and after they
commit crimes.'
— Tara Mulay
for victims. But I don't see how
demonizing [criminals] makes
things better for victims."
Furthermore, Mulay pointed
out, "A lot of prisoners are victims
of crime before and after they
commit crimes. A lot of them are
victims of poverty — these guys
never had a chance."
The prisoners with whom
Mulay and Leslie have been in
touch have been not only appre
ciative but savvy in their own
right. Because prisons are
required by law to have a law
library, many prisoners read

about crimes and their subse
quent punishments.
"They understand that their
rights are being violated," said
Mulay. "They know a lot more
than we do."
As for the stereotype of lascivi
ousness which surrounds prison
ers, Leslie said she has had no
problems with unwanted sexual
attention. "It's important to set
boundaries," she said, to show
that "you're not wanting to be
their girlfriend." With only one
exception, she has been struck by
the respectful attitude of her cor
respondents.
The exception, Leslie said, had
been imprisoned in the sixties and
his attempts to woo her were so
outdated they almost seemed
quaint. "He wrote, 'Hey, cupcake.
Hey, good-lookin', what's cookin'?'
I didn't feel threatened, just
annoyed. I didn't write him back,
and he didn't write to me again."
Like Leslie, the other 21 mem
bers of SSPR also have initiated
personal correspondences with
prisoners. Yet their activism is not
limited to letter writing.
On Nov. 29, a group of prison
ers' rights advocates will speak on
a panel entitled "The Crime of
Punishment." Members of SSPR
anticipate making regular visits at
a women's prison in San Quentin
and organizing "know-your
rights" presentations at prisons
and juvenile detention centers.

In addition, said Mulay, "The
group plans to do a lot more to
educate ourselves and the Skin
ford community." Currently,
Leslie and Mulay are preparing a
prison-law course, which they

hope will be taught next fall by
Law Prof. Kim Taylor-Thompson.
Despite a political climate that
seems unfavorable to their efforts,
Leslie and Mulay said they feel
that prisoners' rights activism is

not only humanitarian but also
logical.
"If we don't give prisoners
hope, skills, and resources," asked
Leslie, "what are they going to do
but fall back?"

Furthermore, Mulay pointed
out, "A lot of prisoners are victims
of crime before and after they
commit crimes. A lot of them are
victims of poverty — these guys
never had a chance."
The prisoners with whom
Mulay and Leslie have been in
touch have been not only appre
ciative but savvy in their own
right. Because prisons are
required by law to have a law
library, many prisoners read

about crimes and their subse
quent punishments.
"They understand that their
rights are being violated," said
Mulay. "They know a lot more
than we do."
As for the stereotype of lascivi
ousness which surrounds prison
ers, Leslie said she has had no
problems with unwanted sexual
attention. "It's important to set
boundaries," she said, to show
that "you're not wanting to be
their girlfriend." With only one
exception, she has been struck by
the respectful attitude of her cor
respondents.
The exception, Leslie said, had
been imprisoned in the sixties and
his attempts to woo her were so
outdated they almost seemed
quaint. "He wrote, 'Hey, cupcake.
Hey, good-lookin', what's cookin'?'
I didn't feel threatened, just
annoyed. I didn't write him back,
and he didn't write to me again."
Like Leslie, the other 21 mem
bers of SSPR also have initiated
personal correspondences with
prisoners. Yet their activism is not
limited to letter writing.
On Nov. 29, a group of prison
ers' rights advocates will speak on
a panel entitled "The Crime of
Punishment." Members of SSPR
anticipate making regular visits at
a women's prison in San Quentin
and organizing "know-your
rights" presentations at prisons
and juvenile detention centers.

In addition, said Mulay, "The
group plans to do a lot more to
educate ourselves and the Skin
ford community." Currently,
Leslie and Mulay are preparing a
prison-law course, which they

hope will be taught next fall by
Law Prof. Kim Taylor-Thompson.
Despite a political climate that
seems unfavorable to their efforts,
Leslie and Mulay said they feel
that prisoners' rights activism is

not only humanitarian but also
logical.
"If we don't give prisoners
hope, skills, and resources," asked
Leslie, "what are they going to do
but fall back?"

Members of Stanford Students for Prisoners' Rights plan to educate students about prison conditions.
When Lauren Leslie sent holi
day greeting cards to 50 inmates
at Pelican Bay State Prison in De
cember 1994, she did not realize
that the gesture would change the
trajectory of her law school experi
ence.
"I just wrote, 'There are people
out here who care about you. Keep
your spirits up,' " Leslie said. Near
ly a year later, she is still corre
sponding with almost all the men.
The overwhelming response of
the inmates led Leslie, a second
year student at the Law School, to
seek out other students concerned
about the human rights violations
which occur regularly in U.S. pris
ons. This fall, Leslie and Tara
Mulay, another second-year law
student, have formally founded
Stanford Students for Prisoners'
Rights (SSPR).
Leslie's initial interest in prison
ers' rights stemmed from an article
she read in the Office of Career Ser
vices, when she was beginning a job
search for last summer. The article,
printed in the progressive National
Lawyers Guild, led Leslie to the
Pelican Bay Information Project,
an organization which holds meet
ings in San Francisco.
Through the organization,
Leslie became aware that a dispro
portionate number of inmates at

Pelican Bay — a maximum security
prison near the Oregon border —
were forced to spend 23 hours a day
alone in windowless cells.
"It's my own personal night
mare," said Leslie, who suffers
from claustrophobia. "It's like
being buried alive."
For Mulay, prisoners' rights be
came a priority when she was in col
lege. "I worked in a maximum secu
rity prison, tutoring," Mulay said.
Among the injustices Mulay
learned about were the racism and
brutality of the guards, the lack of a
support system for prisoners who
receive parole and the discrimina
tion involved in placing prisoners in
isolation.
"Prisoners are moved [into iso
lation] under shady circum
stances," Mulay said. "There's dis
crimination against jail-house
lawyers, people who advocate for
themselves and other prisoners,
who communicate with people on
the outside about prison condi
tions."
Prison administrators single out
such inmates and label them, often
falsely, as "gang-affiliated" or
"gang-identified," Mulay said. The
label then allows the administra
tors to send the inmate into isola
tion for an indefinite period.
With regard to being freed from
isolation, Leslie explained, the
"snitch, parole or die" rule
applies: "You have to snitch on
someone else, you parole out or
you die there."
"People treat prisoners as if
they don't have civiJ rights any
more," said Mulay, adding that
the issue is an example of the "out
of sight, out of mind" proverb.
Both Mulay and Leslie realize
that because prisoners are convict
ed criminals, many Americans
believe they should be "out of
mind." Said Leslie, "I get asked,
'Why are you advocating for people
who have committed heinous
crimes when you could be saving
children who are starving some
where?' But it's precisely because
prisoners are viewed as the cast
aways of our society — that's what
draws me to them even more."
Working with prisoners "is a
challenge to us. We should want to
know why a person can't function
in this society, what it is about
this society," she said.
In her letters to prisoners,
Leslie said, she does not ask them
about their crimes. "I don't make
moral judgments about what they
did to get into prison. There's an
etiquette when corresponding.
You don't ask them what they're

in for."
Helping people who may have
committed atrocities "is not a big
conflict for me," said Leslie. "And
it's not like I've never been a vic
tim of crime."
Mulay also has been a victim of
crime but remains staunch in her
belief that prisoners deserve bet
ter treatment. "I don't think vic
tims' rights and prisoners' rights
are in conflict," she said. "Defi
nitely there should be resources
A lot of prisoners are
victims of crime
before and after they
commit crimes.'

demonizing [criminals] makes
