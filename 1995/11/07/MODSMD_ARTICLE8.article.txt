# Standing ovations for Dove's poetry
## Youngest and first-ever African-American poet laureate gives campus reading 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
Former United States Poet Laureate Rita
Dove's concession last night to her Kresge Audi
torium audience went largely unnoticed.
Dove — who served as poet laureate from
1993-95 and was both the youngest person and
the first African American to receive the
appointment — told the audience members
that they didn't have to applaud between poems
unless, she jocularly amended, they were "com
pletely overwhelmed."
Judging from the standing ovation she
received at the reading's end, Dove's approxi
mately 400 listeners were suitably impressed.
The first speaker this year in the Creative
Writing Program's Jean and Bill Lane Lecture
Series, Dove is currently a Commonwealth
Professor of English at the University of Vir
ginia in Charlottesville. In addition to being a
former Fulbright scholar, Dove is the recipient
of fellowships from both the National Endow
ment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foun
dation.
Dove delighted her audience with readings
from "Grace Notes," "Selected Poems" and
"Mother Love," her most recent collection.
"It's great to be here back in the West," Dove
said. "I spent eight years in Arizona, in Phoenix,
in fact" — teaching creative writing at Arizona
State University from 1981 to 1989 — "and I
feel like I'm coming home, in a sense."
Accordingly, Dove began with a poem enti
tled "Ars poetica" — a poem that within itself
describes the art of writing a poem. Her version,

she £Hiid, is a kind of "anti-'Ars poetica' " in
response to a teacher who had his beginning
poetry students write such a poem as their first
assignment.
"I thought, 'Does he want them ever to write
again?' " she said.
The poem describes a cavernous Wyoming
with a "long, dull stare" and concludes:
"What I want is this poem to be small — a
ghost town on the larger map of wills."
Dove also read a few selections from her
"Thomas and Beulah" poems. The collection,
which in 1987 won the Pulitzer Prize, draws its
inspiration from the lives of her grandparents.
Their history trickled down to her through the
stories her grandmother told Dove when she
was growing up in Akron, Ohio, in the 1950s
and '60s.
The book "began with one poem, and 1 kept
saying, 'That's not enough,' " Dove said of the
writing process for "Thomas and Beulah." If
she had anticipated that she would produce an
entire Ixxik based on the material of her grand
parents' experiences, Dove said, "I probably
would have been terrified."
One poem, entitled "Dusting," depicts
Dove's grandmother trying to recall her first
quasi-boyfriend as she cleans the "diirk wood,"
with "each dust stroke a deep breath."
Beulah remembers a boy with a goldfish
"years lx>fore her father gave her up with her
name," and knows his name is not Michael, but
"something finer."
At the poem's end, she finally conjures it up:
"Maurice."
Dove said her 12-year-old daughter, Aviva,

"thinks it's appalling" that anyone could forget
the name of so important a person.
"I just tell her, 'Wait,' " Dove deadpanned.
In "Mother Ix)ve," Dove's poems explore the
relationship between mothers and daughters
using the model of Persephone and Demeter. In
Greek mythology, Persephone, the daughter of
the harvest goddess Demeter, is kidnapped by
the god of the underworld, Hades, and made his
wife.
Dove has set the underworld as contempo
rary Paris. In one of these poems, Demeter, the
speaker, has a date with her daughter in a Paris
bistro and tries to assess Persephone's state of
mind.
Persephone waltzes into the restaurant
wrapped in cashmere and proceeds to feast on
fattening foods, though she is but "a lipstick
ghost on tissue" and "nothing seemed to fill her
up."
During the cheese and fruit course, Demeter,
"fearing," whispers, "But are you happy?"
"What?" replies Persephone, rendered in a
haughty voice by Dove. "You know, mother, one
should really try the fruit here."
Demeter concludes, "I've lost her," and calls
for the bill.
In "Persephone Falling," Dove's words seem
to warn just how quickly a mother can lose a
daughter. As the earth opens to consume Perse
phone, the poem admonishes young girls to "go
straight to school. Keep you eyes down," with
other similar advice.
The danger is made apparent at the poem's
conclusion: "This is how easily the pit opens.
This is how one foot sinks into the ground."

Greek mythology, Persephone, the daughter of
the harvest goddess Demeter, is kidnapped by
the god of the underworld, Hades, and made his
wife.
Dove has set the underworld as contempo
rary Paris. In one of these poems, Demeter, the
speaker, has a date with her daughter in a Paris
bistro and tries to assess Persephone's state of
mind.
Persephone waltzes into the restaurant
wrapped in cashmere and proceeds to feast on
fattening foods, though she is but "a lipstick
ghost on tissue" and "nothing seemed to fill her
up."
During the cheese and fruit course, Demeter,
"fearing," whispers, "But are you happy?"
"What?" replies Persephone, rendered in a
haughty voice by Dove. "You know, mother, one
should really try the fruit here."
Demeter concludes, "I've lost her," and calls
for the bill.
In "Persephone Falling," Dove's words seem
to warn just how quickly a mother can lose a
daughter. As the earth opens to consume Perse
phone, the poem admonishes young girls to "go
straight to school. Keep you eyes down," with
other similar advice.
The danger is made apparent at the poem's
conclusion: "This is how easily the pit opens.
This is how one foot sinks into the ground."
