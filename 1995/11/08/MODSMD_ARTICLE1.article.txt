A controversial Palo Alto mea
sure that would have severely limit
ed the University's plans for devel
opment was widely defeated yester
day with nearly three out of four
Palo Altans voting it down.
Measure R, which began as a pe
tit ion in July, was den ied passage by
some 10,576 voters, or approxi-

mately 70.3 per
cent of the vot
ing population.
Only 4,464 vot
ers cast their
ballots in sup
port of the mea
sure. All ballots
were counted by
last night.
In total, only

ahout half of the approximately
30,000 registered voters in Palo

Alto went to the polls yesterday.
If passed, Measure R would have
frozen development in Palo Alto at
1989 levels — a 65,000 square foot
allotment — through the year 2015.
Last November, however, Stanford
Management Company, which
manages the University's commer
cial holdings, issued a proposal to
the Palo Alto City Council request
ing about 140,000 more square feet
for development of the Stanford
Shopping Center.

Also, plans to expand the Med
ical School by 400,000 square feet
over the next 20 years could have
been jeopardized by so-called rigid
zoning rules.
Proponents of the measure were
also interested in curtailing traffic
congestion along major streets,
which they say could increase with
additional commercial develop
ment.
Watching the vote

Several Stanford officials joined
Palo Alto residents at the "No on
Measure R" campaign last night at
the Cardinal Hotel to watch the
election results and celebrate the
measure's overwhelming defeat.
Director of Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities Laura
Selznick said she felt the voters had

sent a strong message of confidence
in their city council to work with po
tential hind development projects.
"The residents of Palo Alto are
saying that they don't need to be
protected by government mea
sures," she said.
