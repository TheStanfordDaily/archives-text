# Measure R rejected by voters
## University's position victorious; development will not be blocked 
### Bobby Chen September Trevino Staff writers 
A controversial Palo Alto mea
sure that would have severely limit
ed the University's plans for devel
opment was widely defeated yester
day with nearly three out of four
Palo Altans voting it down.
Measure R, which began as a pe
tit ion in July, was den ied passage by
some 10,576 voters, or approxi-

mately 70.3 per
cent of the vot
ing population.
Only 4,464 vot
ers cast their
ballots in sup
port of the mea
sure. All ballots
were counted by
last night.
In total, only

ahout half of the approximately
30,000 registered voters in Palo

Alto went to the polls yesterday.
If passed, Measure R would have
frozen development in Palo Alto at
1989 levels — a 65,000 square foot
allotment — through the year 2015.
Last November, however, Stanford
Management Company, which
manages the University's commer
cial holdings, issued a proposal to
the Palo Alto City Council request
ing about 140,000 more square feet
for development of the Stanford
Shopping Center.

Also, plans to expand the Med
ical School by 400,000 square feet
over the next 20 years could have
been jeopardized by so-called rigid
zoning rules.
Proponents of the measure were
also interested in curtailing traffic
congestion along major streets,
which they say could increase with
additional commercial develop
ment.
Watching the vote

Several Stanford officials joined
Palo Alto residents at the "No on
Measure R" campaign last night at
the Cardinal Hotel to watch the
election results and celebrate the
measure's overwhelming defeat.
Director of Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities Laura
Selznick said she felt the voters had

sent a strong message of confidence
in their city council to work with po
tential hind development projects.
"The residents of Palo Alto are
saying that they don't need to be
protected by government mea
sures," she said.
Many who attended the gather


ing at the hotel in downtown Palo
Alto expected the proposal to be
defeated.
"We're absolutely thrilled," said
Susan Frank, director of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce. "We
went into tonight looking for a
resounding defeat, and we got it.
It's an ultimate vote of confidence
for the council — they know they
can be trusted."
Most people were surprised by
the large percentage of votes cast
against the measure.
"I'm amazed at how lopsided
the numbers were," said Mike
Cobb, a former Palo Alto council
man and mayor. "It's a positive
sign for the city.

"It showed that voters were able
to distinguish between traffic wor
ries and a bad government pro
cess," he added.
Will Beckett, co-chair of the "No
on Measure R" steering commit
tee, also expressed his surprise at
the size of his campaign's victory.
However, he was quick to point out
what the results of the election
actually mean.
"I didn't expect us to get over
70 percent of the votes," he said
last night, after it became clear
that the measure would definitely
fail. "I'm happy that this has hap
pened, but we've got to remember
that it's not a growth or no-growth
mandate.
"It's just very clear that the vot
ers did not want to lose the city
council as zoning management for
the next 20 years," he added.

Measure R supporters reuct
On the other hand, the mood in
the "Yes on Measure R" camp just
a few blocks down University
Avenue was signified with somber
faces.
As absentee ballot results fore
shadowed defeat early yesterday
evening, the "Yes" group had
reservations about the initiative's
passage. But supporters tried to
keep spirits up.
"Absentee ballots tend to be
conservative," said Emily Renzel,
co-coordinator of Citizens for Affir
mative Planning, the Palo Alto cit
izen's group which initiated the
petition that put Measure R on the
ballot.
"It's really hard to tell . . .
because they've spent a lot of
money," said Renzel, echoing the
sentiments of most the measure's

organizers.
She said that opponents of the
measure had already devoted
about $62,000 to the campaign and
estimated that a final fundraising
figure would be close to $100,000,
adding that developers donated
nearly $8,000 in the last week
alone.
"We started out very strong,"
she said. "I think that's why they
spent so much money."
Despite early reservations,
Renzel and other Measure R sup
porters were surprised by the
landslide and cited low voter
turnout as a possible cause for the
defeat.
But Renzel was confident that
supporters of the measure were
heard. "I think that the council
members nevertheless got a strong
message that a good percentage of
the public is concerned with this
issue," Renzel said.
Ellen Wyman, Palo Alto resi
dent and Measure R proponent
agreed, saying that despite the loss,
the Palo Alto City Council should
recognize that they are "out of
touch" and that residents want to
slow growth.
Wyman partly blamed negative
press coverage for the measure's
defeat.
"One paper had about three to
four editorials opposing us and
they got nasty," said Wyman of the
Palo Alto Weekly.
She also criticized the mea
sure's opponents for alleged dis
honesty.
"The 'No' team said a lot of
things that weren't true," said
Wyman, adding that the 'No' camp
"made Measure R look totally
inflexible" on zoning issues. "It
scared people and confused them.
It made [Measure R! seem rigid,"
she said.
Despite the measure's defeat,
Renzel said that supporters of lim
ited growth would continue to keep
close watch over the city's develop
ment plans.
