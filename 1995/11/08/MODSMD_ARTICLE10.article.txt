# December runoffs scheduled for San Francisco mayor race
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Mayor Frank Jordan
held an early lead yesterday over former Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, but was short of the majori
ty he'd need to avoid a runoff in December. Former
federal housing official Roberta Achtenberg was a
distant third.
With only absentee ballots counted, Jordan had
48.6 percent, or 14,863 votes, Brown had 27.8 per
cent, or 8,535 votes, and Achtenberg had 14.6 per
cent, or 4,499 votes.
A computer problem delayed returns for more
than two hours. By late evening, the registrar's
office had no estimate on when precinct returns

would be available.
Recent polls showed that neither Jordan, Acht
enberg nor Brown was likely to receive more than
50 percent of the vote yesterday, requiring a
runoff.
An off-year election usually means low voter
turnout that favors conservative candidates. But
the city is heavily Democratic and with a strong list
of top candidates, the result will depend on who hit
the streets the hardest, said political consultant
John Whitehurst.
The nonpartisan race was characterized by mud
slinging and a well-publicized photo featuring the

usually staid Jordan shirtless in his shower with
two similarly clad radio disc jockeys.
The former police chief used the stunt as joking
evidence that he is "squeaky clean" and said he
wanted to show a "different side of me" — his sense
of humor. Others called the act outrageous and
unlikely to impress conservative voters Jordan
needs to win.
Brown, with 30 years in the state Assembly, half
of them as the powerful speaker, toned down his
flamboyant image, but his opponents attacked it,
portraying him as a shrewd lawyer who wears
$1,000 suits and drives high-priced cars.

Achtenberg, a former Housing and Urban Devel
opment official who was the highest-ranking open
ly lesbian official in any presidential administra
tion, ran a low-profile campaign.
Opponents criticized her for a lack of city gov
ernment experience and questioned whether she
would endure as mayor, noting that she left her city
supervisor post for HUD and then bowed out of
that job midway through the Clinton administra
tion.
Jordan was best known for renewing the home
less crackdown that helped him win office in 1991
after 33 years in the police department.
