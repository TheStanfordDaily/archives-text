# GOP fails to dominate mid-term elections
## Dems hold on in local races in South, gambling initiatives also fail 
### 
(AP) — After back-to-back
election triumphs, Republicans
failed yesterday in bids to seize
control of the Kentucky gover
nor's office and legislatures in
Virginia and Maine. A GOP bright
spot was in Mississippi, where
Gov. Kirk Fordice easily won a
second term.
Emboldened by historic gains
in 1993 and 1994, Republicans
had hoped to show the party's
revival would spread this year to
state and local contests long dom
inated by Democrats.
But any GOP hopes for anoth
er sweep were quickly dashed in
Kentucky, and followed by several
additional disappointments.
Democratic Lt. Gov. Paul Pat
ton fought back a tough challenge
from businessman Larry Forgy in
Kentucky's governor's race,
extending his party's 24-year grip
on that office.
Democrats also coasted in five
other statewide contests there.
Despite the close margin, Patton
suggested the results offered a
message to the Republican
Congress.
"This will be remembered as
the day that Kentucky stood tall,"
Patton said. "Kentucky has said
'no' to Newt Gingrich and Bob
Dole."
The GOP fared much better in
Mississippi, where Fordice handi
ly beat Democrat Dick Molpus, a
three-term secretary of state.
With 92 percent of the vote in,
Fordice had 55 percent to 45 per
cent for Molpus.

Fordice, the state's first
Republican governor since 1876,
boasted of a booming economy
and promised to cut income taxes.
Molpus said his plan to halve the
state's 7 percent grocery sales tax
was a better deal for lower- and
middle-income families. He also
accused Fordice of ignoring prob
lems in the state's public schools.
A late Molpus radio ad target
ing black voters said a Fordice re
election meant "You go to the
back of the bus." Fordice accused
Molpus of race-baiting.
Even as the South has turned
reliably Republican in presiden
tial elections over the past quar
ter century, Democrats held a
firm grip on local politics.
But Republicans have made
major inroads of late, at the polls
and through a steady stream of
party switchers. They had hoped
for more in Virginia and Missis
sippi.
Republicans still remain confi
dent of winning Louisiana's
gubernatorial race, which will be
settled in a Nov. 18 runoff.
Republicans have never con
trolled either chamber of the Vir
ginia Legislature, and entered tht?
day believing history was within
reach.
But Democrats held their 52-
47 House majority. Republicans
did gain two state Senate seats,
leaving the 40-member chamber
equally divided, although Repub
licans held out hope of convincing
a conservative Democrat to
switch parties. The Democratic

lieutenant governor would break
any tie votes.
In Maine, Democrats had tem
porarily lost control of the House
earlier this year because of party
switches, but they reclaimed a
one-vote majority by winning two
special elections.

'Unquestionably, we
still have the wind at
our backs. At some
point we won't win
every election.'
— Haley Barbour

Dozens of communities elected
mayors. Big-city incumbents who
won easily included Kurt Schmoke
in Baltimore, Edward Rendell in
Philadelphia and Bob Lanier in
Houston. In Gary, Ind., where 90
percent of the population is black,
Scott King was elected the first
white mayor since 1967.
As always, ballots were crowd
ed with propositions. Two Indiana
counties rejected riverboat gam
bling, and residents of Spring
field, Mass., said they did not
want casinos.
A Maine proposal to prohibit
laws aimed at protecting homo
sexuals from discrimination was
defeated.
The attention in Washington
was on the gubernatorial and leg

islative elections. In 1993, off
year contests offered the first evi
dence of the Republican revival,
and both parties watched for clues
to the climate in the coming pres
idential year.
"Unquestionably, we still have
the wind at our backs," said
Republican National Committee
Chairman Haley Barbour. Still,
mindful of the deep Democratic
traditions in local Southern poli
tics, he said: "At some point we
won't win every election."
As for national implications,
the White House took a wait-and
see posture. "If Democrats win
everywhere . . . I'm sure it will be
a very dramatic and national
trend," Clinton press secretary
Mike McCurrv joked.
After two years of Republican
boasting, Democrats were sure to
claim bragging rights.
But even in victory, there were
signs of Democratic distress. Pat
ton distanced himself from Clin
ton and, in a big tobacco state,
vowed not to support him in 1996
if the president kept pushing
curbs on smoking.
Hoping to tie Patton to the
unpopular president, business
man Forgy ran an ad comparing
Patton to the "liberal" Clinton —
and for good measure included a
photograph of 1988 Democratic
presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis.
But with 99 percent of the vote
tallied, Patton had 498,805, or 51
percent, to Forgy's 476,296, or 49
percent.

(AP) — After back-to-back
election triumphs, Republicans
failed yesterday in bids to seize
control of the Kentucky gover
nor's office and legislatures in
Virginia and Maine. A GOP bright
spot was in Mississippi, where
Gov. Kirk Fordice easily won a
second term.
Emboldened by historic gains
in 1993 and 1994, Republicans
had hoped to show the party's
revival would spread this year to
state and local contests long dom
inated by Democrats.
But any GOP hopes for anoth
er sweep were quickly dashed in
Kentucky, and followed by several
additional disappointments.
Democratic Lt. Gov. Paul Pat
ton fought back a tough challenge
from businessman Larry Forgy in
Kentucky's governor's race,
extending his party's 24-year grip
on that office.
Democrats also coasted in five
other statewide contests there.
Despite the close margin, Patton
suggested the results offered a
message to the Republican
Congress.
"This will be remembered as
the day that Kentucky stood tall,"
Patton said. "Kentucky has said
'no' to Newt Gingrich and Bob
Dole."
The GOP fared much better in
Mississippi, where Fordice handi
ly beat Democrat Dick Molpus, a
three-term secretary of state.
With 92 percent of the vote in,
Fordice had 55 percent to 45 per
cent for Molpus.

Fordice, the state's first
Republican governor since 1876,
boasted of a booming economy
and promised to cut income taxes.
Molpus said his plan to halve the
state's 7 percent grocery sales tax
was a better deal for lower- and
middle-income families. He also
accused Fordice of ignoring prob
lems in the state's public schools.
A late Molpus radio ad target
ing black voters said a Fordice re
election meant "You go to the
back of the bus." Fordice accused
Molpus of race-baiting.
Even as the South has turned
reliably Republican in presiden
tial elections over the past quar
ter century, Democrats held a
firm grip on local politics.
But Republicans have made
major inroads of late, at the polls
and through a steady stream of
party switchers. They had hoped
for more in Virginia and Missis
sippi.
Republicans still remain confi
dent of winning Louisiana's
gubernatorial race, which will be
settled in a Nov. 18 runoff.
Republicans have never con
trolled either chamber of the Vir
ginia Legislature, and entered tht?
day believing history was within
reach.
But Democrats held their 52-
47 House majority. Republicans
did gain two state Senate seats,
leaving the 40-member chamber
equally divided, although Repub
licans held out hope of convincing
a conservative Democrat to
switch parties. The Democratic

lieutenant governor would break
any tie votes.
In Maine, Democrats had tem
porarily lost control of the House
earlier this year because of party
switches, but they reclaimed a
one-vote majority by winning two
special elections.

'Unquestionably, we
still have the wind at
our backs. At some
point we won't win
every election.'
— Haley Barbour

Dozens of communities elected
mayors. Big-city incumbents who
won easily included Kurt Schmoke
in Baltimore, Edward Rendell in
Philadelphia and Bob Lanier in
Houston. In Gary, Ind., where 90
percent of the population is black,
Scott King was elected the first
white mayor since 1967.
As always, ballots were crowd
ed with propositions. Two Indiana
counties rejected riverboat gam
bling, and residents of Spring
field, Mass., said they did not
want casinos.
A Maine proposal to prohibit
laws aimed at protecting homo
sexuals from discrimination was
defeated.
The attention in Washington
was on the gubernatorial and leg

islative elections. In 1993, off
year contests offered the first evi
dence of the Republican revival,
and both parties watched for clues
to the climate in the coming pres
idential year.
"Unquestionably, we still have
the wind at our backs," said
Republican National Committee
Chairman Haley Barbour. Still,
mindful of the deep Democratic
traditions in local Southern poli
tics, he said: "At some point we
won't win every election."
As for national implications,
the White House took a wait-and
see posture. "If Democrats win
everywhere . . . I'm sure it will be
a very dramatic and national
trend," Clinton press secretary
Mike McCurrv joked.
After two years of Republican
boasting, Democrats were sure to
claim bragging rights.
But even in victory, there were
signs of Democratic distress. Pat
ton distanced himself from Clin
ton and, in a big tobacco state,
vowed not to support him in 1996
if the president kept pushing
curbs on smoking.
Hoping to tie Patton to the
unpopular president, business
man Forgy ran an ad comparing
Patton to the "liberal" Clinton —
and for good measure included a
photograph of 1988 Democratic
presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis.
But with 99 percent of the vote
tallied, Patton had 498,805, or 51
percent, to Forgy's 476,296, or 49
percent.
