## Stop ticket tricks 
### 
LOGIC SEEMS TO be a little
lacking in the Department
of Athletics lately.
While there is a glut of tickets
left over for next week's Big
Game, the Athletics Department
is currently charging the price for
season tickets, $35, to students
who only want to buy a ticket for
that single game. Had students
bought their tickets at the Oregon
State game, however, they would
have been able to get Big Game
passes for only $25.
Pro-rating is fine, but only if
it's done consistently Discount
sales "wouldn't be fair to people
who bought season tickets," said
Asst. Athletic Director Charles
Davis, but how is it fair to lower
the price and then raise it again?
In the interest of fairness, the
Athletics Department needs to stick
to a consistent policy. Either charge
a price of $35 throughout the entire
season, or charge a decreasing price
as the season progresses. Most stu

dents would probably prefer the lat
ter.
Considering all the extra tickets
it has left over, the Athletics
Department should prefer the lat
ter course as well and lower its
price back to $25. It's the simple
economics of supply-and-demand.
Officials say the department may
lose up to $200,000 on Big Game,
partly because demand for season
tickets is lower than usual. Lower
ing the price to where demand and
supply meet is a logical thing to
do.
As for next year, the Athletics
Department should consider revis
ing its policy to allow students to
buy Big Game tickets separately
again. Obviously, the department
wants to make money off season
tickets. But students who other
wise wouldn't go to Big Game
would probably be much more
receptive to a lower price, which
might ultimately allow the Athlet
ics Department to cut its losses.
