# Psychological help

### 
LAST WEEK, A student
attempted suicide here at
Stanford. While suicide may
not be a new statistic, it still
remains a disturbing fact of life on
college campuses across the coun
try.
The University has and should
continue to provide resources to
aid students who are under
extreme emotional pressures. The
Bridge, a 24-hour, student-run
counseling service, receives over
100 calls per quarter from stu
dents. Obviously, there is a need
for these services on campus.
Students should also be more
vigilant about their mental and
physical health. Despite all the
hype that Stanford is laid back, in
truth, the University can and
often is intensely competitive.
There are several campus pro
fessional psychological services for
students on campus that are
essentially free.

These include:
• Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell, which provides
crisis services 24 hours a day.
• Health Promotion Services at
Cowell.
• Dorm peer health educators who
put up fliers relating to personal
well-being. Take the time to read
the advice, especially the ones on
relaxation techniques.
Anxieties can often be attribut
ed to academic pressures. Talk to
advisers, as many as possible,
when feeling overly stressed. The
Center for Teaching and Learning
in Sweet Hall has free tutors for
those having difficulty in classes.
Finally, retaking or dropping a
class is not the end of the world.
Slowing down one's academic and
extracurricular schedule doesn't
equate with failure. Yes, Stanford
can be daunting challenge, but col
lege should never be a hazard to
psychological and mental health.
