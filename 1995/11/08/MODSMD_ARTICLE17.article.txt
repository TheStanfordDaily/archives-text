Grape issue isn't really about special interests

WE ARE WRITING this from the
Stanford Overseas Center in
Santiago, Chile. Reading The
Daily is one of the few ways that stu
dents here are able to obtain informa
tion on "what's going on" back at Stan
ford. Eor us, however, finding out
"what's going on" has been pretty disap
pointing.
We are writing because it angers us,
frustrates us and embarrasses us to see
that our fellow Stanford students don't
care enough about an issue to open
themselves up to learn.
The so called "grape issue" isn't

about "special interests." It isn't about
"student politics." And it has absolutely
nothing to do with "ultimatums." It
does, however, have everything to do
with the plight of the farm worker: low
wages and minimal standards of safety,
including overexposure to sun, heat,
hazardous chemicals, etc. It has every
thing to do with the people who sweat to
put food on our tables. It is about a
social injustice that is happening right
now — a social injustice that we choose
to ignore.
The Daily's Oct. 31 editorial states
that the grape issue has "no real place in

the University." Excuse us, but we dis
agree. The University Charter stipulates
that the objectives of the University are
"to qualify students for personal success
and direct usefulness in life; and to pro
mote public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civi
lization." Therefore, to say that this issue
"has no real place in the University" is
not only inaccurate, but insubstantial.
It is disheartening to read that stu
dents are "sick and tired" of the grape
issue, one that some people regard as
"just another issue." It is disheartening
to know that some students aren't even

making the effort to learn. It is equally
disheartening, if not disgusting, that
some students aren't even bothering to
vote.
As students, it is our responsibility to
learn. As members of a community, it is
our responsibility to vote. As people,
you'd think it was our responsibility to
care.
