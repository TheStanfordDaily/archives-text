# Democratic party is still strong and supported by many
## 
### 
On Tuesday, Nov. 7, The Daily ran five
articles from various campus political
groups and local politicians, all talking
about the future of the Democratic Party
in view of the 1996 election. While all five
articles presented different views about
the direction the party should take, they
all seemed to agree on one thing: that in
1994, the American people had voted
overwhelmingly for change and against
the old message of the Democratic Party.
"Nov. 8, 1994, the day of the revolution,"
one writer even termed it.
What all writers neglected to men
tion are the minuscule numbers of
American citizens whose voices were
actually heard that day. Fewer than
half of the eligible, voting-age Ameri
cans are even registered and of that
minority, fewer than half turned out to
vote in 1994. This was no mandate
from the people. This was an apathetic
exercise in partisan democracy that
makes the campus grape debate seem

impassioned by comparison.
The Democrats did not lose because
the nation had lost faith in the "great
society" ideals that the party has sup
ported for the past 30 years. According
to all the polls quoted in these five arti
cles, the American people are largely dis
satisfied with the changes instituted by
the Republican majority. The Democrats
were defeated because the Republicans
unified a minority of the electorate with
a national platform and gave local voters
a clear "us or them" option — which the
Democrats failed to do.
Traditional Democratic voters didn't
support the party in 1994, not because
they had shifted too far to the extreme
left, as several writers in The Daily
claimed, but because, led by President
Clinton, the Democrats have abandoned
their liberal, idealistic foundation in
favor of a move to the center they
believed would bring greater political
success. Witness the failure to provide
universal health care, the dismissal of
cabinet nominee Lani Gumier because
of her stand on affirmative action and
the largely unsatisfactory solution to
the issue of homosexuality in the mili
tary — all 1992 campaign promises that
the Democrats had the power to enact.
If they really wish to regain their

former prominence, the Democrats
need to follow the advise of Mr. Bill
Shen and renew their support of the
causes that have traditionally been the
focus of the party — helping those who
cannot help themselves. A further shift
to the center would only solidify the
reputation of national politics as an
arena in which the rich and powerful
look out for each other, not a place
where the interests of the common citi
zen are championed. The damage that
would result to our society from such a
move would not be the type that could
be repaired with another so-called "rev
olution."
