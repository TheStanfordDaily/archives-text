# Shoven's closure of FRI is damaging and hypocritical
## 
### 
The same day last year that I
learned the Food Research Institute
would be placed under review, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John Shoven
was above the fold of The Daily, trum

peting the planned ethnic studies pro
grams and Stanford's commitment to
an international and multicultural
curriculum. I savor the irony. The FRI
is (or rather, will be remembered as) a
department with rich offerings in the
study of economic development in
Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Nonetheless, Shoven will eliminate
the department and replace it with an
interdisciplinary center, dumping the
Ph.D. program and keeping the mas
ters program. The implicit assumption
is that the masters program quality
would be maintained.
However, by eliminating the Ph.D.
program, Shoven will drive away quali
ty faculty and make it harder to
attract new faculty. Masters students
will lose the benefit of contact with
professors and Ph.D. students involved
in frontier research. They would be
left with a milquetoast degree that
would still cost $30,000. I find this
offensive and cynical, as should future
masters students and recipients of the
budget ax. Stanford clearly wants to
keep its revenue sources without pre
serving a commitment to a quality
graduate education.
