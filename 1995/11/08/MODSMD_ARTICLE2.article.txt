# Task force to propose changes in undergraduate advising system
## Committee calls for more faculty involvement, clarified roles 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
As a two-year advising associate,
Michelle Koh has seen both sides of the
spectrum. She spent one year with an
enthusiastic faculty adviser who moti
vated his freshmen and another with an
adviser who was not respected by his ad
visees.
Roll's job — though not fully clarified
was to fill the gap and provide stu
dents with the best possible advising ex
perience.
"The AA's job is to know the nuts and
bolts of advising," said Koh, one of 11
members of an advising task force which
will put forth 20 recommendations on
improving undergraduate advising to
the Faculty Senate on Thursday. "It's

not much of an adviser's
job to know all that
stuff. The main role of
the faculty adviser is to
bring in outside per
spective and provide a
mentorship for under
graduates."
By clarifying the
roles of each actor in the
current advising sce-

nario — and providing incentives for fac
ulty members to become involved —
task force members hope to encourage
greater participation by advisers and ad
visees and enhance the overall advising
experience.
Overall, despite some complaints
from both students and faculty, the task
force found that Stanford's unique sys

tcm of incorporating faculty, profession
als and students into the advising sys
tem works and should be continued.
No advising system will be devoid of
complaints, said Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ram6n Saldi'var,
chair of the committee. In fact, he said,
at all institutions student expectations
are greater than the actual advising that
is provided.
However, when compared to advising
plans at other schools, the Stanford sys
tem was "right in there with them,"
Saldi'var said. He cautioned, however,
that there is still room for improvement.
To augment the system, the commit
tee will propose revisions to the role of
advisers and the strengthening of small-


Saldivar
group freshman and sophomore
programs.
A well-defined job
Freshmen, their advisers and
all AAs should know their roles in
the advising system before fall
quarter begins, the committee will
recommend.
Currently, Koh said, "fresh
men expect the adviser to do one
thing where the advisers expect
them to do another. The expecta
tions on both sides are not clearly
matched."
To alleviate that problem, the
committee will request that
"Approaching Stanford I" and
"Approaching Stanford II"the —the
two handbooks which incoming
freshmen receive during the sum
mer — be entirely rewritten.
In addition, definitions of the
adviser's role should be clearly
defined in the Faculty Handbook
and shared with students, Saldi
var will request tomorrow.
The task force will also recom
mend that the University provide
incentives to encourage more facul
ty participation in order to demon
strate a commitment to advising.
"Good advising of students is
part of the regular responsibility
of the faculty," Saldivar said. "We
should expect faculty to take part
in the advising system, but we rec
ognize that not all the faculty can
participate all of the time."
He said the actual implementa
tion of incentive programs is
planned by the president and
provost.
"It's faculty members' job to
teach and advise," said Provost
Condoleezza Rice. "If we didn't
want to teach and advise, we'd be
at a research institution."
The committee will also pro

pose establishing minimum
requirements for advisers and
adviser training. Advisers should
be faculty members as often as
possible, hold an advanced degree,
know the undergraduate curricu
lum and specialize in a subject
which is part of the undergradu
ate curriculum, the committee
will request.
Faculty, graduate students and
University staff currently advise
freshmen. But only 128 of the
1,400 faculty serve as faculty
advisers, comprising only one
third of the overall number of
freshman advisers.
Closer advising relations
By encouraging closer contact
between undeclared undergradu
ates and faculty, students will be
more motivated toward declaring a
major, studying overseas and writ
ing an honors thesis, Saldivar said.
The committee will propose
expanding the fledgling Sopho
more College program — an
intensive two-week program in
which groups of 10 sophomores
study with a well-reputed faculty
member — and will also suggest
creating freshman seminars to
model the current sophomore pro
gram and move more faculty con
tact to the dorms.
Saldivar, who taught at Sopho
more College, said it provided stu
dents with more focused advising
and closer contact with faculty,
something which currently is
infrequent in students' first two
years.
"In the two weeks we were
there, they handed us all of Stan
ford's resources," said sophomore
Abigail Moreland, who studied
communism's fall with Rice. "It
was a hit overwhelming, but we
knew all the opportunities that
were there."
The committee will also
encourage increased relations
among freshmen, the Undergrad

uate Advising Center and the
Head Advising Associate. The
committee will propose adding
two full-time advisers to the cen
ter and dividing the advisers
among residence halls on cam
pus. The committee also will rec
ommend that head AAs be com
pensated that the role of AAs be
expanded.
Calling for change
The committee was created by
Rice following last year's recom
mendation by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education that
the advising system be revised.
The commission's report, while
not making specific suggestions,
asked that specific actions and
implementation plans be provided
by the end of this quarter.
Among those calling for revi
sions to the system is University
President Gerhard Casper, whose
personal experience in advising
has shaped his opinion.
"I have never been absolutely
convinced that faculty advisers
are the best possible [advisers!,"
he said.
As a first-year professor at UC-
Berkeley in 1963, Casper served
as a freshman adviser. "I'd never
taught at an American universi
ty," he said. "I'd never taught. I,
of course, had no clue."
He said he agreed with the rec
ommendation to expand small
group faculty / student interac
tion, saying that closer relations
with faculty automatically pro
duce a better advising system.
After hearing the recommenda
tions, the Faculty Senate will
most likely take action at a later
meeting. Saldi'var said he is hope
ful that the University can devote
the resources to allow all the pro
posed revisions to occur.
"I'm optimistic because some
changes have already begun," he
said. "The groundwork has
already been there."

committee will propose adding
two full-time advisers to the cen
ter and dividing the advisers
among residence halls on cam
pus. The committee also will rec
ommend that head AAs be com
pensated that the role of AAs be
expanded.
Calling for change
The committee was created by
Rice following last year's recom
mendation by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education that
the advising system be revised.
The commission's report, while
not making specific suggestions,
asked that specific actions and
implementation plans be provided
by the end of this quarter.
Among those calling for revi
sions to the system is University
President Gerhard Casper, whose
personal experience in advising
has shaped his opinion.
"I have never been absolutely
convinced that faculty advisers
are the best possible [advisers!,"
he said.
As a first-year professor at UC-
Berkeley in 1963, Casper served
as a freshman adviser. "I'd never
taught at an American universi
ty," he said. "I'd never taught. I,
of course, had no clue."
He said he agreed with the rec
ommendation to expand small
group faculty / student interac
tion, saying that closer relations
with faculty automatically pro
duce a better advising system.
After hearing the recommenda
tions, the Faculty Senate will
most likely take action at a later
meeting. Saldi'var said he is hope
ful that the University can devote
the resources to allow all the pro
posed revisions to occur.
"I'm optimistic because some
changes have already begun," he
said. "The groundwork has
already been there."
As a two-year advising associate,
Michelle Koh has seen both sides of the
spectrum. She spent one year with an
enthusiastic faculty adviser who moti
vated his freshmen and another with an
adviser who was not respected by his ad
visees.
Roll's job — though not fully clarified
was to fill the gap and provide stu
dents with the best possible advising ex
perience.
"The AA's job is to know the nuts and
bolts of advising," said Koh, one of 11
members of an advising task force which
will put forth 20 recommendations on
improving undergraduate advising to
the Faculty Senate on Thursday. "It's

not much of an adviser's
job to know all that
stuff. The main role of
the faculty adviser is to
bring in outside per
spective and provide a
mentorship for under
graduates."
By clarifying the
roles of each actor in the
current advising sce-

nario — and providing incentives for fac
ulty members to become involved —
task force members hope to encourage
greater participation by advisers and ad
visees and enhance the overall advising
experience.
Overall, despite some complaints
from both students and faculty, the task
force found that Stanford's unique sys

tcm of incorporating faculty, profession
als and students into the advising sys
tem works and should be continued.
No advising system will be devoid of
complaints, said Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ram6n Saldi'var,
chair of the committee. In fact, he said,
at all institutions student expectations
are greater than the actual advising that
is provided.
However, when compared to advising
plans at other schools, the Stanford sys
tem was "right in there with them,"
Saldi'var said. He cautioned, however,
that there is still room for improvement.
To augment the system, the commit
tee will propose revisions to the role of
advisers and the strengthening of small-


Saldivar
group freshman and sophomore
programs.
A well-defined job
Freshmen, their advisers and
all AAs should know their roles in
the advising system before fall
quarter begins, the committee will
recommend.
Currently, Koh said, "fresh
men expect the adviser to do one
thing where the advisers expect
them to do another. The expecta
tions on both sides are not clearly
matched."
To alleviate that problem, the
committee will request that
"Approaching Stanford I" and
"Approaching Stanford II"the —the
two handbooks which incoming
freshmen receive during the sum
mer — be entirely rewritten.
In addition, definitions of the
adviser's role should be clearly
defined in the Faculty Handbook
and shared with students, Saldi
var will request tomorrow.
The task force will also recom
mend that the University provide
incentives to encourage more facul
ty participation in order to demon
strate a commitment to advising.
"Good advising of students is
part of the regular responsibility
of the faculty," Saldivar said. "We
should expect faculty to take part
in the advising system, but we rec
ognize that not all the faculty can
participate all of the time."
He said the actual implementa
tion of incentive programs is
planned by the president and
provost.
"It's faculty members' job to
teach and advise," said Provost
Condoleezza Rice. "If we didn't
want to teach and advise, we'd be
at a research institution."
The committee will also pro

pose establishing minimum
requirements for advisers and
adviser training. Advisers should
be faculty members as often as
possible, hold an advanced degree,
know the undergraduate curricu
lum and specialize in a subject
which is part of the undergradu
ate curriculum, the committee
will request.
Faculty, graduate students and
University staff currently advise
freshmen. But only 128 of the
1,400 faculty serve as faculty
advisers, comprising only one
third of the overall number of
freshman advisers.
Closer advising relations
By encouraging closer contact
between undeclared undergradu
ates and faculty, students will be
more motivated toward declaring a
major, studying overseas and writ
ing an honors thesis, Saldivar said.
The committee will propose
expanding the fledgling Sopho
more College program — an
intensive two-week program in
which groups of 10 sophomores
study with a well-reputed faculty
member — and will also suggest
creating freshman seminars to
model the current sophomore pro
gram and move more faculty con
tact to the dorms.
Saldivar, who taught at Sopho
more College, said it provided stu
dents with more focused advising
and closer contact with faculty,
something which currently is
infrequent in students' first two
years.
"In the two weeks we were
there, they handed us all of Stan
ford's resources," said sophomore
Abigail Moreland, who studied
communism's fall with Rice. "It
was a hit overwhelming, but we
knew all the opportunities that
were there."
The committee will also
encourage increased relations
among freshmen, the Undergrad

uate Advising Center and the
Head Advising Associate. The
committee will propose adding
two full-time advisers to the cen
ter and dividing the advisers
among residence halls on cam
pus. The committee also will rec
ommend that head AAs be com
pensated that the role of AAs be
expanded.
