# Task force to propose changes in undergraduate advising system
## Committee calls for more faculty involvement, clarified roles 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
As a two-year advising associate,
Michelle Koh has seen both sides of the
spectrum. She spent one year with an
enthusiastic faculty adviser who moti
vated his freshmen and another with an
adviser who was not respected by his ad
visees.
Roll's job — though not fully clarified
was to fill the gap and provide stu
dents with the best possible advising ex
perience.
"The AA's job is to know the nuts and
bolts of advising," said Koh, one of 11
members of an advising task force which
will put forth 20 recommendations on
improving undergraduate advising to
the Faculty Senate on Thursday. "It's

not much of an adviser's
job to know all that
stuff. The main role of
the faculty adviser is to
bring in outside per
spective and provide a
mentorship for under
graduates."
By clarifying the
roles of each actor in the
current advising sce-

nario — and providing incentives for fac
ulty members to become involved —
task force members hope to encourage
greater participation by advisers and ad
visees and enhance the overall advising
experience.
Overall, despite some complaints
from both students and faculty, the task
force found that Stanford's unique sys

tcm of incorporating faculty, profession
als and students into the advising sys
tem works and should be continued.
No advising system will be devoid of
complaints, said Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ram6n Saldi'var,
chair of the committee. In fact, he said,
at all institutions student expectations
are greater than the actual advising that
is provided.
However, when compared to advising
plans at other schools, the Stanford sys
tem was "right in there with them,"
Saldi'var said. He cautioned, however,
that there is still room for improvement.
To augment the system, the commit
tee will propose revisions to the role of
advisers and the strengthening of small-
