## We need universities? 
### 
Anyone reading this ha* had
some connection with a university,
if only for the first time right now.
I hazard that most people who have had
connections with a university, Stanford
or any other, have not thought critically
and at length about the merits of univer
sities. I certainly haven't. I do believe
that most have considered and judged
particular aspects of university-hood.
Taking Stanford as an example, many
have recognized the terrible manage
ment of our postal station, the lopsided
ness between technical and fine-art
scholarship and the coolness of our pres
ident's hair. But what about universities
as a whole and how they affect their
individual constituents?
First of all, what do undergraduates
(such as myself and most of the people
who read this paper) gain from spending
time at a university? Learning, I guess.
But learning confined strictly to aca
demic skills — not including research —
does not reach any special height at uni
versities. If learning is something gained
by study and or instruction, universities
certainly are not unparalleled. Self
study or learning at colleges (that enroll
only undergraduates) is equal to, if not
better than academic learning at univer
sities.
Learning social skills, elements of per
sonal maturity and other intangibles

also occurs at universities. And although
much of this happens, I believe this is
only because the average undergraduate
remains at school for about four years
during their most advanced experience
of independence. So it is natural that
some serious learning must go on for a
person 18-22 years of age after leaving
structured environments. But if an 18-
year-old left a structured environment to
learn for four years, I doubt a university
would be the best place to do so. A place
filled with other undergraduates in the
same situation, invisible grad students
and administrators and professors con
tent with luxuriating in what they see as
ivory towers could hardly be the most
fulfilling. Traveling for four years, hold
ing a job, joining the army (albeit very
structured) or numerous other options
could provide as much, if not more learn
ing of these intangibles for an under
graduate-aged person.
What about graduate and under
graduate research? Universities cer
tainly provide valuable opportunities in
these areas. But those graduate stu
dents who are being primed to continue
in university academia are molded into
traditional roles — to become part of a
university. Those who are doing gradu
ate study leading to an industry career
could better profit by attending a tech
nical school, think tank or some insti

tute that is totally devoted to such pur
suits.
And how many professors can balance
teaching and research well? Relatively
few. The majority that can't would be
better off devoting themselves to college
instruction or institutional research.
Those that can can work at both.
How many of you really think that
administrators and university institu
tions do worthwhile activities? Certainly,
they are worthwhile within the context of
universities, but it is hard to imagine
how they are helpful to the world as a
whole. The Faculty Senate is a joke —
wonkers wanting to rise the ladder by
establishing rules that have no real sig
nificance. Ever had a bad experience in
Old Union?
Need I say more?
Perhaps universities are good
because they are a conglomeration of
many elements and include many
aspects known as university life: football
teams, multicultural population, bad
newspapers, etc. Maybe they're a good
place to learn that universities really
aren't that great.
Mr. Kazaks will soon be graduating
from this place.
