## Afterlife altercations — issues with the hereafter 
### 
C C A 111 can sa y is that if there're no
LJk onion bagels in heaven, you can
A. me the hell out."
—Ari Newberger
Today I believe in the Afterlife.
I change around on the subject quite a
bit, flopping from side to side on the
belief scale. One day I lean to the more
faithful side, to where hope reigns over
dysthymia and bad poetry. The next I
poke my head over to the more skeptical
side, over to the side of reason and atoms
and a chemical consciousness. . .
But today, as I said, I do believe in the
Afterlife. I believe that thought does con
tinue after the breath. I believe that
something exists for me to do once that
all-Dorito diet does me in.
Maybe it's just that I need some com
forting this week. Maybe it's because day
light-savings time has sunlight-deprived
and depressed me enough to reactivate
my parochial schooling. Maybe it's
because ever since Saturday I have this
new fantasy that, one day, I might get the
chance to go up to Yitzhak Rabin person
ally, shake his hand, and — as a neutral
representative of humans living at the
time of his assassination — apologize for
our sometimes-pathological fear of actu

ally getting what we want.
Whatever the reason, today I find the
idea of an Afterlife to be more than non
ludicrous, and in fact downright plausible.
Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure
which version of the fairy tale I like best.
Judaism is far too fickle in its inconsis
tent depictions for me to be sated by the
pictures drawn by my ancestors (con
trary to common belief, Jews do have a
tradition of the Big Beyond — it's just
been rejected for centuries because of the
profound emphasis it places on the con
sumption of fried foods and smoked fish
products).
Maybe I should cop a Buddhist 'tude
instead and believe that after corporeal
life there is simply more corporeal life,
that after my chassis gets all green and
crusty I'll have the privilege to be reborn
into some new form — as an eagle, or a
woman or a sea cucumber.
Oh, but it's also pretty easy to be
seduced by the schmoozy cocktail party
version of heaven — that is, the Afterlife
as a star-studded, catered buffet (no
cover charge but you gotta know some
one to get in).
Or, even better still, I could explore
the Roman Catholic take, with its Virgin
Airlines' view of the hereafter. After all,

according to the Vatican, the heaven,
hell, purgatory breakdown of the After
life is not all that unlike a domestic flight.
Think: You've got your first class, your
business class and your coach. If you're
in first class, everything is perfect — free
drinks, good service and you get to hob
nob with all the best people. In business
class things are okay, but the whole time
you're there you're really just hoping
that at some point the Virgin-Stewardess
Mary will come and tell you you've been
bumped up to first.
And coach is, well, coach.
Still, circular logic tells me I should be
especially concerned with the design of my
own post-interment existence. Especially
since this is eternity we're talking about,
not just a weekend in the Hamptons. This
is all the rest of the time of forever.
It's not too far off to suggest that we
petty humans would experience a dimin
ishing return on divinity just the same as
we would on a Snickers bar. What sites or
things or people would I really want to do
for all time? Could I really handle choco
late milk and orgasm for eternity? I
mean, no matter how cool the Afterlife is,
we're talking about forever and ever and
ever and ever here.
That's one hell of a long time to have

to hang out in heaven — no matter how
up to date the magazine rack is.
(For a brief analogy of eternity imag
ine this: Person A is getting ready to bake
a huge wedding cake, while, at the same
time, Person B is reading "Madame
Bovary." But Person A is only able to add
flour into the mix one grain at a time, and
she can only add one grain every thou
sand years. By the time Person A is ready
to put the icing on the fourteenth layer,
Person B would be up to the part where
Emma has her first crush.)
But, to be honest, I don't think I'd be
all that picky about what God's amuse
ment park looks like, so long as there is
something once this Mr. Toad's Wild
Ride of Life comes to an end. So long as
it's not nothingness. So long I get to keep
on being me.
And so long as it's a place where I can
ask God a few questions. Because, in the
end, I think that's the only reason I real
ly want an Afterlife: for some closure, for
some answers.
I'd enter the Throne Room described in
Ezekiel. ... A sapphire light would blaze.
The inner chamber would be all white and
misty. My allergies would act up.
"God?" I'd call.
"What," He'd answer.

"Can I ask you a question?" I'd ask.
"No," He'd answer.
"But you just answered a question,"
I'd say.
"Don't be a wise ass. Now go get a tis
sue," He'd reply.
So I'd turn to the heavenly court. And
from them I'd demand answers.
"Why does He aliow sufTering?" I'd
ask an angel.
"Why did you fry ants with a magnify
ing glass?" it'd reply.
"Why are zucchinis so weird looking?"
"Why are you so weird looking?"
"Don't answer my questions with
questions!"
"Don't ask us questions we don't like."
"How come bad things happen to good
people?"
"How come you think you know
what's bad?"
"Why doesn't He tell us which is
which?"
"Don't bring up that whole God's
silence thing, He's really sensitive about
it — especially since 'Crimes and Misde
meanors' came out."
"That's a really good movie."
"We think so too, just don't tell Him
we said so. Here, take another tissue."

Today I believe in the Afterlife.
I change around on the subject quite a
bit, flopping from side to side on the
belief scale. One day I lean to the more
faithful side, to where hope reigns over
dysthymia and bad poetry. The next I
poke my head over to the more skeptical
side, over to the side of reason and atoms
and a chemical consciousness. . .
But today, as I said, I do believe in the
Afterlife. I believe that thought does con
tinue after the breath. I believe that
something exists for me to do once that
all-Dorito diet does me in.
Maybe it's just that I need some com
forting this week. Maybe it's because day
light-savings time has sunlight-deprived
and depressed me enough to reactivate
my parochial schooling. Maybe it's
because ever since Saturday I have this
new fantasy that, one day, I might get the
chance to go up to Yitzhak Rabin person
ally, shake his hand, and — as a neutral
representative of humans living at the
time of his assassination — apologize for
our sometimes-pathological fear of actu

ally getting what we want.
Whatever the reason, today I find the
idea of an Afterlife to be more than non
ludicrous, and in fact downright plausible.
Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure
which version of the fairy tale I like best.
Judaism is far too fickle in its inconsis
tent depictions for me to be sated by the
pictures drawn by my ancestors (con
trary to common belief, Jews do have a
tradition of the Big Beyond — it's just
been rejected for centuries because of the
profound emphasis it places on the con
sumption of fried foods and smoked fish
products).
Maybe I should cop a Buddhist 'tude
instead and believe that after corporeal
life there is simply more corporeal life,
that after my chassis gets all green and
crusty I'll have the privilege to be reborn
into some new form — as an eagle, or a
woman or a sea cucumber.
Oh, but it's also pretty easy to be
seduced by the schmoozy cocktail party
version of heaven — that is, the Afterlife
as a star-studded, catered buffet (no
cover charge but you gotta know some
one to get in).
Or, even better still, I could explore
the Roman Catholic take, with its Virgin
Airlines' view of the hereafter. After all,

according to the Vatican, the heaven,
hell, purgatory breakdown of the After
life is not all that unlike a domestic flight.
Think: You've got your first class, your
business class and your coach. If you're
in first class, everything is perfect — free
drinks, good service and you get to hob
nob with all the best people. In business
class things are okay, but the whole time
you're there you're really just hoping
that at some point the Virgin-Stewardess
Mary will come and tell you you've been
bumped up to first.
And coach is, well, coach.
Still, circular logic tells me I should be
especially concerned with the design of my
own post-interment existence. Especially
since this is eternity we're talking about,
not just a weekend in the Hamptons. This
is all the rest of the time of forever.
It's not too far off to suggest that we
petty humans would experience a dimin
ishing return on divinity just the same as
we would on a Snickers bar. What sites or
things or people would I really want to do
for all time? Could I really handle choco
late milk and orgasm for eternity? I
mean, no matter how cool the Afterlife is,
we're talking about forever and ever and
ever and ever here.
That's one hell of a long time to have

to hang out in heaven — no matter how
up to date the magazine rack is.
(For a brief analogy of eternity imag
ine this: Person A is getting ready to bake
a huge wedding cake, while, at the same
time, Person B is reading "Madame
Bovary." But Person A is only able to add
flour into the mix one grain at a time, and
she can only add one grain every thou
sand years. By the time Person A is ready
to put the icing on the fourteenth layer,
Person B would be up to the part where
Emma has her first crush.)
But, to be honest, I don't think I'd be
all that picky about what God's amuse
ment park looks like, so long as there is
something once this Mr. Toad's Wild
Ride of Life comes to an end. So long as
it's not nothingness. So long I get to keep
on being me.
And so long as it's a place where I can
ask God a few questions. Because, in the
end, I think that's the only reason I real
ly want an Afterlife: for some closure, for
some answers.
I'd enter the Throne Room described in
Ezekiel. ... A sapphire light would blaze.
The inner chamber would be all white and
misty. My allergies would act up.
"God?" I'd call.
"What," He'd answer.

"Can I ask you a question?" I'd ask.
"No," He'd answer.
"But you just answered a question,"
I'd say.
"Don't be a wise ass. Now go get a tis
sue," He'd reply.
So I'd turn to the heavenly court. And
from them I'd demand answers.
"Why does He aliow sufTering?" I'd
ask an angel.
"Why did you fry ants with a magnify
ing glass?" it'd reply.
"Why are zucchinis so weird looking?"
"Why are you so weird looking?"
"Don't answer my questions with
questions!"
"Don't ask us questions we don't like."
"How come bad things happen to good
people?"
"How come you think you know
what's bad?"
"Why doesn't He tell us which is
which?"
"Don't bring up that whole God's
silence thing, He's really sensitive about
it — especially since 'Crimes and Misde
meanors' came out."
"That's a really good movie."
