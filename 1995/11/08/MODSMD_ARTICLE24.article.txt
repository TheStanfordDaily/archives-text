## Law professor calls for end to violence in Galapagos 
### Lori Sunamoto 
The battle of man versus nature rages
on in the jungles and tropics of South
America. The environment of the Gala
pagos Islands, the famed site of Charles
Darwin's study of natural selection, is in
jeopardy. Enraged locals of the tiny
islands off the coast of Ecuador have
resorted to violence in protest of the gov
ernment's measures to protect the
islands' environment.
Marc Miller, a visiting scholar at Stan
ford and a professor of law at Emory Uni
versity, has been closely following the sit
uation on the islands, and has founded
the Galapagos Coalition with biologists
Greg Aplet and Matt James.
The main goals of the Galapagos
Coalition are to distribute information
and create awareness of the crisis on the
islands. To date, this crisis includes two
violent takeovers of the Charles Darwin
Research Station, the death of over 90

Galapagos tortoises and a large fire, most
likely due to arson, on the main island.
Miller is concerned about the lack of
attention that the struggle in the Galapa
gos has been getting. "It's a very special,
very isolated, very unique place. It
seemed to us like such an important test
case for the world, and so important in its
own right, that we set up this group."
In 1959, the Galapagos government
declared 95 percent of the islands a
national park and has since taken other
precautionary measures, such as requir

ing a trained naturalist to guide tourists
in an effort to preserve the environment.
Many locals, however, are demanding
power over their land. Furthermore, the
protesters have threatened to start tak
ing tourists hostage.
Takeovers of the research station are
not the only acts of terrorism inflicted
upon the environment. The islands' resi
dents have been known to kill sharks for
their fins, as well as sea lions for their
penises which are then sold as aphrodisi
acs. Extractive fisheries and other indus
tries, such as the well-known whaling
fleets, have been depleting the islands'
natural resources for centuries.
Additionally, the unnatural introduc
tion of foreign species as pets or food as a
form of eco-terrorism has caused extinc
tion, and has fundamentally changed the
spectrum of species that currently inhab
it the island.
The first takeover of the Darwin sta
tion occurred in January of this year
after the government pulled the plug on
an experimental sea-cucumber fishery.
The Fisheries Council, pressured by local
politicians, initially authorized the cre
ation of the fishery in an attempt to cur
tail the excessive amount of illegal fish
ing, but later cut it short after the fisher
men had taken between 7 million to 12
million cucumbers over their limit of half
a million. The angry fishermen rallied for
their commercial rights, flooding the
gates of the station, but harming nobody.
The station was taken over again Sept.
4, a few days after a bill that would

reduce protection
of the ecosystem
and give the resi
dents administra
tive authority
was vetoed by
President Sixto
Duran Ballen.
Angry Galapagos
natives — Gala
paganos — armed
with machetes

entered the station and ordered that all
work cease.
They had closed two airports by the

time the government sent in troops to
calm the situation. The government
agreed to listen to the protesters'
grievances, which included the passing of
the failed bill, but the result of this battle
is of yet uncertain.
Miller, however, believes that there is
still hope the situation can be rectified.
"What is striking to me is that with a lit
tle bit of effort, it's possible to influence
the debate, to contribute in a healthy
way." Getting involved can be as simple
as making an effort to follow the plight of
the Galapagos, he said.
According to Miller, thousands of

Americans visit the islands every year, yet
many do not have sufficient knowledge of
its history to recognize the human impacts
on the environment, or to understand the

conflict between the
locals and the Galapagos
government — between
the economy and the
environment.
Miller offers numer
ous ways that people

can become acquainted with the situation
in the Galapagos, and stresses the impor
tance of awareness in combating the
increasing ecological destruction. He

points to the display at the California
Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate

Park, to which Stanford
is a major contributor
of Galapagos artifacts,
and to the Internet,
which he believes was

crucial in his own search for information.
He said those interested should browse
http://www.law.emory.edu/PI/GALAPA
GOS/.
But why bother to care about the
Galapagos at all? Says Miller, "That can
all be summed up by saying, 'It simply
matters.' "
