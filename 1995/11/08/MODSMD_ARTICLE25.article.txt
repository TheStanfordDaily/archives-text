# Flex those abs!

/ 1 . Why is it more difficult
to do a sit-up with your
• hands behind your
head than when they are out in
front of you?
A First, for those of you
• that have never done a
• sit-up, try this right
now. Yoti will find that it is much
easier to do sit-ups with your
arms out in front than tucked
away behind your head, no mat
ter what j'our coach or Tammy
Lee Webb says. It is also a lot
easier to sit-up with your legs
stretched out than with them
bent at t he knees. Why is this?
Well, after doing enough sit
ups to make my abs rock hard —
yes, I am cool — I have come up
with the reason. Listen ye of the
human world, obsessed with the
form of your flesh. You see, a sit
up basically is a change in body
position; in this case, a bend at
the waist.

When you lie on your back,
your weight is evenly distributed
across your whole body, whereas
while standing all the weight is
focused on the legs and feet.
What makes the sit-up difficult
is that you have to actually move
the weight of your body
upwards.
WeU, not all of it. You are real
ly only moving half of your body
weight in a sit-up. Since your
stomach muscles are not nearly
as strong as your legs, it is much
harder to do a sit-up than a
standing bend.
Most of you will agree that

the sit-up is hard enough. It's
even harder for us bugs whose
stomach muscles ... well, aren't
there. Now, when you put your
arms behind your head, you are
effectively raising the amount of
weight to be moved.
Not only do your abdominals
have to pull up your torso, but
your arms as well. If your arms
are outstretched, then much of
their weight is distributed down
your body, towards your waist.
This is why it is easier to do sit
ups with your arms stretched
out, effectively doubling your
innate ability to look like a walk
ing zombie.
Another tip that makes doing
sit-ups much easier and just as
impressive is to keep your legs
stretched out instead of tucked
in at the knees. This position
also redirects your weight down
your body. Although this may
not be as effective in developing
one's abs, it is encouraging to be
able to do thousands more sit
ups than before.
While I'm in gym mode, I
might as well mention some
thing about push-ups as well.
Push-ups are difficult for the
same reason as sit-ups — you are
moving some amount of your
body weight, about one third,
against gravity. With pushups
though, the position of your
arms in relation to your body
makes all the difference. Since
your upper body is the only part
"that moves, with your feet or
knees stationary on the ground,
your entire body becomes a
lever, with the feet or knees as
the fulcrum.
Some of you may remember
an old physics lecture about this.
It is much easier to raise a lever,
in this case your body, by push
ing at a point farther from the
fulcrum. Some of your friends
may refer to this as leverage,
although torque might be a bet
ter word.
Of course, if you move your
arms too far up — above your
shoulders for example — then
your body stops obeying physics
and starts obeying anatomy.
Optimally, you should place your
arms on the ground in a perpen
dicular line from the shoulders.
So, now you know how to bet
ter do sit-ups and pushups. It's
definitely time to make that well
needed trip to the gym, or better
yet, join the Stanford ab-sensa
tion, led by — who else? —
Tammy Lee Webb and her Abs
of Steel.
