# Genetics forum catalyzes discussion
## Panelists debate questions of homosexuality and breast cancer 
### Steven Kasapi 
Last Friday and Saturday, scientists, schol
ars and the public gathered at Stanford to dis
cuss the implications of genetic research. The
symposium, titled "Genetics and the Human
Genome Project: Where Scientific and Public
Cultures Meet," reflected the broad impact that
genetic research is likely to have on our lives.
Joan Fujimura, professor of biotechnology and
society and organizer of the symposium, felt
that the forum was successful in bringing
together people with differing viewpoints, and
fostering continued discussion.
Among the major topics were the Human
Genome Project, its proposed but unfunded
cousin — the Human Genome Diversity Project
— and the impact of these programs on issues
as indiscriminate as homosexuality and breast
cancer. The Human Genome Project is an
international effort to sequence all 23 chromo
somes making up the human genetic code. The
hope is that by understanding the 99.9 percent
of the identical genetic material found in all
members of the human race, scientists will be
able to understand diseases at their most basic
level.
The Human Genome Diversity Project, or
HGDP, hopes to take this understanding one
step further by studying global variations in the
remaining 0.1 percent of genetic material
which differs among humans.
The symposium began with a discussion of
the merits of the Human Genome Project and
the lingering concerns of many in the scientific
community. According to those who believe
genetic investigation to be a powerful yet
unqualified good, genetic markers — identifi
able patterns within the DNA — may offer new
views on human history. For example, Kenneth
Kidd of Yale University Medical Center report
ed that genetic information is "consistent with
migration from Africa into Europe and Asia."
One goal of the HGDP is to collect genetic
samples from people from many different cul
tures. That is where its troubles begin. Troy
Duster of the Department of Sociology at the
University of California, Berkeley, argued that
the problem of race is going to "confound most
of our discussion" of the HGDP. He insisted

that "the HGDP is conflated with race and eth
nicity," citing recent history of racial evolution
ary theory as evidence that science is often
tainted by societal bias.
Henry Greely, professor of law at Stanford
and chair of the Ethics Committee of the North
American chapter of the HGDP, tried to
counter the Duster's accusations by arguing
that the HGDP is attempting to address the
concerns of native peoples. It hopes, he said, "to
foster a partnership" between the researcher
and subject, to offer medical assistance where
possible, and to ensure that any native popula
tions "benefit from any spin-offs of the
research."
Recently, however, 160 Native American
tribes issued a statement denouncing the
HGDP. If the worldwide opposition to the pro
gram grows, it may have no subjects left to
study. "Who really benefits from this
research?" members of the audience asked.
"Why is this research really being conducted?"
The Human Genome Project, unlike the
HGDP, is firmly under way. As more genetic
information is identified, molecular biologists
will inevitably find genes that influence our
traits and susceptibility to disease. In 1993
Dean Hamer and colleagues at the National
Cancer Institute published a report suggesting
that male sexual orientation is in part genetic.
Hamer defended his earlier findings during the
symposium.
The first step in Hamer's search for a genet
ic link to sexuality was to examine the family
histories of gay men. Women carry two X chro
mosomes while men carry one X and one Y.
Hamer's group noticed that homosexuality
tended to be passed along to the mother's side
of the family. Thus, they hypothesized, if there
were some genetic code for sexual orientation,
it may well be on the mother's X chromosome.
Hamer's group found that 83 percent of 40 gay
brothers studied shared a set of 5 markers on a
region of the X chromosome called" Xq2B. A
group of lesbian sisters shared no markers on
the X chromosome. Thus, Hamer concluded,
male homosexuality is probably partially an
inherited trait passed through the mother. If a
gene influencing sexual orientation exists, it is
probably located on Xq2B.

The case of the "gay gene," however, is far
from closed. Neil Risch of the Genetics Depart
ment questioned both Hamer's experiment and
conclusions. In the family trees of Hamer's sub
jects, Risch showed, the gay male offspring
tended not to have children. The apparent
maternal link may thus be false, since it is not
known whether the children of gay men are
more likely to be gay. Risch also pointed out
that the correlation Hamer saw on Xq2B may
be the result of chance, since neither Hamer's
own lab nor a group at the University of West
ern Ontario have been unable to conclusively
reproduce Hamer's 1993 results.
Nonetheless, the notion of a "gay gene" has
already entered popular culture as fact. Some
gay and lesbian advocates are arguing that being
gay really is a matter of biology, not choice, and
on this basis discrimination against gays should
be illegal. Janet Halley of the Law School sharply
criticized legal arguments based on biological
determinism. "They don't work," she said cate
gorically. "The argument for immutability is at
least hopeless." She cited cases in which biologi
cal immutability even worked against a plaintiff
and stressed that the real issue was the nature of
discrimination itself.
The research of the Human Genome Project
also has major repercussions concerning breast
cancer, and this topic was discussed at the sym
posium as well. David Cox of the Genetics
Department described a gene called BRCAI
which was recently linked to breast and ovarian
cancer in women. One percent of Ashkenazi
Jewish women, he explained, carry a particular
mutation of the gene. This mutation accounts
for 16 percent of all breast cancer and 39 per
cent of all ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, there
is no known preventative treatment for breast
or ovarian cancer. Nonetheless, women over
whelmingly want to be tested.
Spanning two days and numerous ethical,
scientific and humanistic concerns, the success
of the Genetics and Human Genome Project
Symposium in bringing together numerous
experts from both the scientific and legal
worlds was readily apparent. However, the
eventual repercussions of the symposium, and
the fate of the field of genetic investigation
itself, will not be evident for years to come.

genetic research is likely to have on our lives.
Joan Fujimura, professor of biotechnology and
society and organizer of the symposium, felt
that the forum was successful in bringing
together people with differing viewpoints, and
fostering continued discussion.
Among the major topics were the Human
Genome Project, its proposed but unfunded
cousin — the Human Genome Diversity Project
— and the impact of these programs on issues
as indiscriminate as homosexuality and breast
cancer. The Human Genome Project is an
international effort to sequence all 23 chromo
somes making up the human genetic code. The
hope is that by understanding the 99.9 percent
of the identical genetic material found in all
members of the human race, scientists will be
able to understand diseases at their most basic
level.
The Human Genome Diversity Project, or
HGDP, hopes to take this understanding one
step further by studying global variations in the
remaining 0.1 percent of genetic material
which differs among humans.
The symposium began with a discussion of
the merits of the Human Genome Project and
the lingering concerns of many in the scientific
community. According to those who believe
genetic investigation to be a powerful yet
unqualified good, genetic markers — identifi
able patterns within the DNA — may offer new
views on human history. For example, Kenneth
Kidd of Yale University Medical Center report
ed that genetic information is "consistent with
migration from Africa into Europe and Asia."
One goal of the HGDP is to collect genetic
samples from people from many different cul
tures. That is where its troubles begin. Troy
Duster of the Department of Sociology at the
University of California, Berkeley, argued that
the problem of race is going to "confound most
of our discussion" of the HGDP. He insisted

that "the HGDP is conflated with race and eth
nicity," citing recent history of racial evolution
ary theory as evidence that science is often
tainted by societal bias.
Henry Greely, professor of law at Stanford
and chair of the Ethics Committee of the North
American chapter of the HGDP, tried to
counter the Duster's accusations by arguing
that the HGDP is attempting to address the
concerns of native peoples. It hopes, he said, "to
foster a partnership" between the researcher
and subject, to offer medical assistance where
possible, and to ensure that any native popula
tions "benefit from any spin-offs of the
research."
Recently, however, 160 Native American
tribes issued a statement denouncing the
HGDP. If the worldwide opposition to the pro
gram grows, it may have no subjects left to
study. "Who really benefits from this
research?" members of the audience asked.
"Why is this research really being conducted?"
The Human Genome Project, unlike the
HGDP, is firmly under way. As more genetic
information is identified, molecular biologists
will inevitably find genes that influence our
traits and susceptibility to disease. In 1993
Dean Hamer and colleagues at the National
Cancer Institute published a report suggesting
that male sexual orientation is in part genetic.
Hamer defended his earlier findings during the
symposium.
The first step in Hamer's search for a genet
ic link to sexuality was to examine the family
histories of gay men. Women carry two X chro
mosomes while men carry one X and one Y.
Hamer's group noticed that homosexuality
tended to be passed along to the mother's side
of the family. Thus, they hypothesized, if there
were some genetic code for sexual orientation,
it may well be on the mother's X chromosome.
Hamer's group found that 83 percent of 40 gay
brothers studied shared a set of 5 markers on a
region of the X chromosome called" Xq2B. A
group of lesbian sisters shared no markers on
the X chromosome. Thus, Hamer concluded,
male homosexuality is probably partially an
inherited trait passed through the mother. If a
gene influencing sexual orientation exists, it is
probably located on Xq2B.

The case of the "gay gene," however, is far
from closed. Neil Risch of the Genetics Depart
ment questioned both Hamer's experiment and
conclusions. In the family trees of Hamer's sub
jects, Risch showed, the gay male offspring
tended not to have children. The apparent
maternal link may thus be false, since it is not
known whether the children of gay men are
more likely to be gay. Risch also pointed out
that the correlation Hamer saw on Xq2B may
be the result of chance, since neither Hamer's
own lab nor a group at the University of West
ern Ontario have been unable to conclusively
reproduce Hamer's 1993 results.
Nonetheless, the notion of a "gay gene" has
already entered popular culture as fact. Some
gay and lesbian advocates are arguing that being
gay really is a matter of biology, not choice, and
on this basis discrimination against gays should
be illegal. Janet Halley of the Law School sharply
criticized legal arguments based on biological
determinism. "They don't work," she said cate
gorically. "The argument for immutability is at
least hopeless." She cited cases in which biologi
cal immutability even worked against a plaintiff
and stressed that the real issue was the nature of
discrimination itself.
The research of the Human Genome Project
also has major repercussions concerning breast
cancer, and this topic was discussed at the sym
posium as well. David Cox of the Genetics
Department described a gene called BRCAI
which was recently linked to breast and ovarian
cancer in women. One percent of Ashkenazi
Jewish women, he explained, carry a particular
mutation of the gene. This mutation accounts
for 16 percent of all breast cancer and 39 per
cent of all ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, there
is no known preventative treatment for breast
or ovarian cancer. Nonetheless, women over
whelmingly want to be tested.
Spanning two days and numerous ethical,
scientific and humanistic concerns, the success
of the Genetics and Human Genome Project
Symposium in bringing together numerous
experts from both the scientific and legal
worlds was readily apparent. However, the
eventual repercussions of the symposium, and
the fate of the field of genetic investigation
itself, will not be evident for years to come.

The Genetics and Human Genome Symposium included both lectures and panel discussions concerning the future implications of genet
ics research.
Last Friday and Saturday, scientists, schol
ars and the public gathered at Stanford to dis
cuss the implications of genetic research. The
symposium, titled "Genetics and the Human
Genome Project: Where Scientific and Public
