# 'Queerland' attacks LGBCC
## Anonymous letter calls for community center to 'wake up' 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
A gay activist group known as Queerland has resur
faced on the Stanford campus, with members writing
that they disagree with some positions of the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center and posing sug
gestions for other changes around the University.
In an anonymous letter, Queerland emphasized
the fact that it is not associated with the LGBCC and
laid out its 11 "Theses of Truth," one of which called
for the community center to "wake up."
Sherri Taylor, coordinator of the LGBCC's Speak
ers Bureau, said that although Queerland made
some valid points, she feels that the LGBCC is doing
what it is meant to do.
"I take no offense whatsoever," said Taylor.
"Queerland wants people to re-examine important
issues. That's always helpful."
Taylor said she remembers Queerland from her
freshman year, when a Christian group brought a
"reformed" lesbian to campus to speak about how she
came to see the error in her ways. "Queerland had
made a 'counterflier' in response to the [Christian]
group's flier that made some good points," Taylor said.
"Queerland is around to just shake things up in
general," added Taylor. "I think their goal is to not
let anyone get too complacent about issues, which

could happen easily if people weren't shocked now
and then. Actually, I see them as more of a help than
a hindrance."
She added that Queerland's visibility varies from
year to year. "Some years they're more under
ground," said Taylor. "You won't hear anything from
them, and then out of nowhere they're busting a gut."
The issues which Queerland addressed in its letter
extend beyond gay issues. Members expressed disap
proval of the University's investment in Pepsico, stu
dents' vacillation on the grape ban and the fact that
every community center on campus is not wheelchair
accessible.
Queerland also emphasized the fact that the
LGBCC should "recognize transgender people in
name and action." Taylor said the possibility of
changing the "LGBCC" to the Lesbian, Gay Bisexual
and Transgender Community Center (LGBTCC), so
as to include transgender individuals, has been a sub
ject of debate for some time.
She added that she agreed with Queerland that all
community centers should be wheelchair accessible.
The issue also came up at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
"I actually kind of like them," Taylor said, con
cerning her opinion of Queerland in general. "They
may be rather militant but at least they temper it
with wit."
