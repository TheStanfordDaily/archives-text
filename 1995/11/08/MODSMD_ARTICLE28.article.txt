Hookworm busted
A man was arrested last Wednesday for allegedly steal
ing more than 200 books from the Stanford Bookstore
and Hoover Institution.
Glaudios Yohannes, 33, a Hoover archives employee,
was caught by Bookstore security officials while leaving
the Bookstore with three books that had no book jackets.
Security officials notified Stanford Police.

Because an increasing number of empty book jackets
have recently been discovered on Bookstore shelves, Stan
ford Police were quite suspicious of Yohannes and
obtained a search warrant for his San Jose residence.
They found more than 200 apparently new books without
book jackets, police said.
The Bookstore is currently trying to determine which
books from Yohannes' collection belong to the Bookstore.
Some of the books have already been verified as stolen

books, with a majority belonging to the Bookstore and a
smaller number belonging to Hoover.
A Bookstore security official declined to discuss the
case in fear of jeopardizing the investigation.
Yohannes was released from jail Monday and faces
charges of burglary, possession of stolen property, and
grand theft.
Yohannes could not be reached for comment.
