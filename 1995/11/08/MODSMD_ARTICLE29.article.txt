## Goldstein sweeps at Rolex Tennis Invite 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
The 50th annual Rolex NorCal
Men's Tennis Invitational, which
started last Saturday and ended
yesterday at San Jose State, pit
ted 79 players from 11 different
schools against one another.

'It was a great tourna
ment. [The men]
showed me guts and
fight. It speaks well
for the team.'

By the semifinals, however, it
looked like the Stanford men's
tennis team's personal clinic. The
top-ranked Cardinal advanced
four singles players and three
doubles teams to the semis.
Inevitably, Stanford swept both
the singles and doubles titles.

Third-seeded sophomore Paul
Goldstein defeated top-seeded
freshman Ryan Wolters 6-2, 6-4 in
the singles final while the tandem
of Goldstein and senior Jim
Thomas knocked off Ornello Arlati
and Nick Williams of Washington
7-5, 6-3. The winners received
automatic berths in the Rolex
Indoor Championships, which will
take place in Dallas, Texas starting
Feb. 8.
It was an unusual finish in
that Goldstein won both titles
while Thomas, playing his last
Rolex tourney, achieved his own
double-triumph by winning the
doubles competition this year
after capturing the singles title in
1993. "Jim played exceptionally
well in his [final Rolex outing]."
said head coach Dick Gould.
At first glance, Stanford's dom
ination seemed effortless. Howev
er, Gould is quick to point out oth
erwise. Indeed, some players had
to play three matches a day.
"It was a great tournament,"
Gould said. "[The men] showed

me guts and fight. [They] proved
to be great competitors. It speaks
well for the team."
No Cardinal player personi
fied Stanford's toughness belter
than seventh-seeded Grant
Elliott, who had to contend with
a sore back. Gould was leery of
playing the hobbled junior in
both singles and doubles, but
Elliott competed in gutsy fash
ion.
Elliott's best match came in
the quarterfinals, where he took
on second-seeded Casey Louie of
California.
Elliott took the 23rd-ranked
Louie to the limit in each and
every set. Elliott squeaked out a
7-6 win in the first set, which
included a tight 9-7 tie breaker.
After Louie escaped with the sec
ond set 7-5, Elliott stormed back
with a vengeance to take the
third set 7-5 and advance to the
semifinals.
However, after dropping the
first set 6-4 against Goldstein in
the semifinal match, Elliott's
back pain set in, and he was
unable to continue, allowing
Goldstein to advance to the
final.
Other strong performances
included that of top-seeded
Wolters.
Playing under what Gould
called "reverse pressure,"
Wolters responded well in front
of his hometown crowd.
After reaching the quarterfi
nals with relative ease, Wolters
ran into trouble against Eric
Drew of Washington. Wolters
dropped the first set 4-6, but
responded by taking the next two
sets 6-2, 6-3.
Wolters continued building
his momentum by defeating
fourth-seeded Thomas 6-2,6-1 in
the semis.
"As a team, we couldn't have
done much better," Gould said.
"Essentially, we played a perfect,
tournament."
