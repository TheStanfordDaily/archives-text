;zza Rice, in response
,o questions from
numbers of the ASSU
senate last night, dis
ussed the inaccessi
>ly of campus ethnic
•enters to physically
lisahled students.
() 1 d Union, the
ocation of several

ethnic centers, does have elevators in
some areas, but not ones which help stu
dents reach places like the Hillel office,
the Asian American Activities Center
and the Native American Cultural Cen
ter, senators said.
Rice said that Old Union is not in
cluded in the University's Capital Plan,
but should possibly be examined sepa
rately. Current federal law requires any
buildings underirointr renovation to be

made handicapped-accessible.
"Maybe the solution would be eleva
tors in Old Union, but when you begin
construction on old buildings for one
purpose, other problems always arise,"
Rice said
An Americans with Disabilities Act
compliance officer, Rosa Gonzalez, has
been hired this year to work with con
struction project managers throughout
the campus and to ensure that buildings
are made accessible to all students dur
ing any renovations.
David Barba, co-student director of
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center, brought up the issue of cen
ters like the LGBCC and the Black Com
munity Service Center, which are also
inaccessible. Speaking forcefully, Barba
said he feels that the LGBCC's inaccessi
bility is ignored because it is not in Old
Union.
"It really angers me that members of
the lesbian, gay and bisexual community
are not able to come up to this space and

interact with their peers and contribute
directly to their peers and this center.
We can't have them volunteer up here,"
said Barba.
"There are few safe places on this
campus, and this inaccessibility keeps
[disabled people] away," he added.
Rice responded by saying that be
cause the Women's Center itself is acces
sible, the Fire Truck House may not
have "as high a priority as Old Union in
making it accessible."
In some cases, renovation work on
campus has rendered some buildings
and areas inaccessible. Rice said the ad
ministration is taking preventative mea
sures to deal with accessibility by notify
ing the Disability Resource Center
ahead of time about construction barri
ers.
Rice addressed another construction
related issue: new graduate student
housing slated to be located by Gover-

nor's Corner. Thus summer, con
struction was delayed on that pro
ject, partly because of the endan
gered tiger salamander population
in the Lake Lagunita lakebed.
However, Rice said the director
of facilities plans to begin con
struction on the housing in June
1996, to be completed in the fall of
1997. "They have figured out what
to do with the salamander," Rice
said, adding that "they wouldn't
have been able to complete t he pro
ject before next fall anyway."
Graduate students also ques

tioned Rice about computing
resources — especially those in
Rains — which they consider to be
insufficient. There are two com
puter clusters in all of Rains — 14
computers total, or approximately
one computer for every 25 stu
dents. In undergraduate resi
dences, there is approximately
one computer for every 10 stu
dents.
According to Rice, universities
nationwide were caught unpre
pared for the current high demand
for computer resources. Right
now, she said, there is not enough
funding to provide as many com
puters as students desire.
While the number of machines
available to graduate students in

their residences is smaller than the
number available in undergradu
ate residences, Rice said, that is
because Residential Computing
has determined that about 50 per
cent of graduate students bring
their own computers and many
have access to computers in their
departments.
Rice also addressed the issue of
incentives for faculty to work
harder at teaching and advising.
She said she feels that it is a pro
fessor's job to be a good teacher,
and that rewards such as extended
sabbatical or positions such as a
teaching chair would be excessive.
"Most people take their teaching
and advising very seriously," she
said.
