;zza Rice, in response
,o questions from
numbers of the ASSU
senate last night, dis
ussed the inaccessi
>ly of campus ethnic
â€¢enters to physically
lisahled students.
() 1 d Union, the
ocation of several

ethnic centers, does have elevators in
some areas, but not ones which help stu
dents reach places like the Hillel office,
the Asian American Activities Center
and the Native American Cultural Cen
ter, senators said.
Rice said that Old Union is not in
cluded in the University's Capital Plan,
but should possibly be examined sepa
rately. Current federal law requires any
buildings underirointr renovation to be

made handicapped-accessible.
"Maybe the solution would be eleva
tors in Old Union, but when you begin
construction on old buildings for one
purpose, other problems always arise,"
Rice said
An Americans with Disabilities Act
compliance officer, Rosa Gonzalez, has
been hired this year to work with con
struction project managers throughout
the campus and to ensure that buildings
are made accessible to all students dur
ing any renovations.
David Barba, co-student director of
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center, brought up the issue of cen
ters like the LGBCC and the Black Com
munity Service Center, which are also
inaccessible. Speaking forcefully, Barba
said he feels that the LGBCC's inaccessi
bility is ignored because it is not in Old
Union.
"It really angers me that members of
the lesbian, gay and bisexual community
are not able to come up to this space and

interact with their peers and contribute
directly to their peers and this center.
We can't have them volunteer up here,"
said Barba.
"There are few safe places on this
campus, and this inaccessibility keeps
[disabled people] away," he added.
Rice responded by saying that be
cause the Women's Center itself is acces
sible, the Fire Truck House may not
have "as high a priority as Old Union in
making it accessible."
In some cases, renovation work on
campus has rendered some buildings
and areas inaccessible. Rice said the ad
ministration is taking preventative mea
sures to deal with accessibility by notify
ing the Disability Resource Center
ahead of time about construction barri
ers.
