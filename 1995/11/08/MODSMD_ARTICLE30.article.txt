# Knee injury doesn't keep Hermiz down
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
On Sept. 25, 1994, most
returning students moved back in
at Stanford, starting a new school
year.
Rita Hermiz started a new way
of life.
Hermiz, then a freshman on
the Stanford women's soccer
team, was trying to get by a Cal
defender. Seconds later, she was
sprawled out on the grass at Mal
oney Field. Her knee was gone.
Two of her four knee liga
ments, the medial collateral and
posterior cruciate ligament, were
torn. Torn cartilage resulted.
"[The defender] kind of came
in in a weird way with her knees
first," Hermiz said. "She hit the
inside of my left knee and
knocked that out, and I think
that's when I tore my MCL.
Then, when I fell, she fell on top
of me and that's when I ripped my
PCL."
Hermiz had never suffered a
serious injury before, but she
knew her time had come.
"I kind of felt like the rest of
my leg below my knee wasn't con
nected to my knee," Hermiz said.
"I was laying there kind of ignor
ing everybody because they were
asking how I was. I knew it was
something really big. I was really
scared. Even when the trainer
ran out, I was kind of ignoring her
for awhile too, thinking maybe I
was imagining it."
But Hermiz's nightmare was
all too real. And for a growing
number of female athletes, knee

injuries are shattering dreams
and shortening careers.
However, Hermiz's injury did
more damage than most.
"From what I gathered from
the doctor and my therapist, it
was a pretty severe and unique
injury — a weird combination [of
ligaments]," Hermiz said. "My
doctor stressed how major, how
hard of a blow it must have been
for these ligaments to have torn
the way they did.
"He said that when he looked
inside, it was the biggest mess
he'd ever seen."
That mess led to another mess
— double surgeries and grueling
rehabilitation. For Hermiz, the
pain had just begun.
Physicians, led by Stanford's
Dr. Michael Dillingham, reat
tached Hermiz's PCL. The proce
dure is rare and often unsuccess
ful since the ligament surprising
ly ripped off the bone instead of
ripping in half. Although she
could have functioned without
her PCL, doctors told Hermiz
that reattaching the PCL would
prevent arthritis as she ages. The
cast remained for eight weeks,
and Hermiz thinks the immobili
ty caused the ensuing scarring
that prolonged her recovery.
"After the cast came off, I
couldn't really bend or straighten
my knee at all," Hermiz said. "It
took me a really long time to get
that range back.
"Basically, after I got my cast,
for the next three or four months,
I was probably in the most pain I
had ever felt. When that scarring
happens and you're trying to (gain
mobility), I can't even describe the
pain. I was basically screaming
and yelling every time we were
doing rehab. Almost every day I
was crying. You basically want it
to rip every single day so you can
get extra range."
Extra range meant extra rehab,
and Hermiz put in four hours a day
— two before class and two before
she went to watch her teammates
practice. Her effort led nowhere.
Hermiz's body scars faster
than most, doctors said. While
normally a protective quality, the
quick scarring worked against
Hermiz, inhibiting the movement
of her joints. Hermiz grew frus
trated with the ineffective rehab
and cut back her hours, and doc
tors decided another surgery was
imperative in late January.
The second surgery finally
began to pay dividends. Hermiz
religiously performed all the stan
dard leg exercises — raises,
lunges, step-ups, slide boards and
squats. By April, she was lifting
weights and jogging.
On the other hand, victims of
the more common anterior cruci

ate ligament tear can usually begin
to jog shortly after surgery due to
the linear movement of jogging.
Hermiz suffered the hard way.
"I couldn't really do anything
for the longest time," she said.
"Being in the situation I was, all I
would think about was my injury.
There were so many little things
you could do for rehab. The doc
tors said flex your quad whenever
you're sitting around. Every
minute of the day I was thinking
about my knee and what I could
be doing or what pain I was in."
Now Hermiz spends many of
her minutes thinking about soc
cer. She earned a starting role
again on the 1995 Stanford team
and on Sunday enjoyed the finest
game of her career with one goal
and two assists in a 4-0 regular
season-ending win over Arizona.
Still, Hermiz said she is not the
same player.
"I'm definitely not as quick now,
although it has gotten better," she
said. "I think that it will come prob
ably within a year. I'm still getting
my strength back and I don't have
that power of explosion I used to
have. I'm also hoping that my psy
chological breakdowns are going to
get better with going in hard and
being more aggressive.
"I kind of evaluate it as it's not
worth the risk any more. I think I
have to reconcile it with just being

smarter, knowing when to go and
when not to go at it, as opposed to
now, where I'm just kind of not
going at all."
Last year, seven Cardinal play
ers including Hermiz suffered
knee injuries. Narrower bone
placement in women's knees and
the different weight distribution
of women are cited as two reasons
for the prevalence of knee injuries,
especially ACLs, in women. Her
miz thinks ligament tears can be
reduced if players make wiser
decisions, at least in soccer.
"Knowing how to place your
body when you're colliding and
where you want to be when you're
coming up against somebody at
high velocity (can reduce the risk
of injury)," Hermiz said.
As her team readies for its first
postseason contest Friday night at
Santa Clara, Hermiz prepares for
the day she will have the same
capabilities she once showcased.
"In a sense, I am (back to nor
mal! because I can practice every
day and I can do everything phys
ically, but I 'm not the same in that
I still can't do little things like sit
on my knees," Hermiz said. "My
knee still gets sore and inflamed,
and it pops and makes weird nois
es at times. I still don't have full
flexion in my legs.
"Hopefully, that will come
soon."
