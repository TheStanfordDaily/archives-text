# Knee injury doesn't keep Hermiz down
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
On Sept. 25, 1994, most
returning students moved back in
at Stanford, starting a new school
year.
Rita Hermiz started a new way
of life.
Hermiz, then a freshman on
the Stanford women's soccer
team, was trying to get by a Cal
defender. Seconds later, she was
sprawled out on the grass at Mal
oney Field. Her knee was gone.
Two of her four knee liga
ments, the medial collateral and
posterior cruciate ligament, were
torn. Torn cartilage resulted.
"[The defender] kind of came
in in a weird way with her knees
first," Hermiz said. "She hit the
inside of my left knee and
knocked that out, and I think
that's when I tore my MCL.
Then, when I fell, she fell on top
of me and that's when I ripped my
PCL."
Hermiz had never suffered a
serious injury before, but she
knew her time had come.
"I kind of felt like the rest of
my leg below my knee wasn't con
nected to my knee," Hermiz said.
"I was laying there kind of ignor
ing everybody because they were
asking how I was. I knew it was
something really big. I was really
scared. Even when the trainer
ran out, I was kind of ignoring her
for awhile too, thinking maybe I
was imagining it."
But Hermiz's nightmare was
all too real. And for a growing
number of female athletes, knee

injuries are shattering dreams
and shortening careers.
However, Hermiz's injury did
more damage than most.
"From what I gathered from
the doctor and my therapist, it
was a pretty severe and unique
injury — a weird combination [of
ligaments]," Hermiz said. "My
doctor stressed how major, how
hard of a blow it must have been
for these ligaments to have torn
the way they did.
"He said that when he looked
inside, it was the biggest mess
he'd ever seen."
That mess led to another mess
— double surgeries and grueling
rehabilitation. For Hermiz, the
pain had just begun.
Physicians, led by Stanford's
Dr. Michael Dillingham, reat
tached Hermiz's PCL. The proce
dure is rare and often unsuccess
ful since the ligament surprising
ly ripped off the bone instead of
ripping in half. Although she
could have functioned without
her PCL, doctors told Hermiz
that reattaching the PCL would
prevent arthritis as she ages. The
cast remained for eight weeks,
and Hermiz thinks the immobili
ty caused the ensuing scarring
that prolonged her recovery.
"After the cast came off, I
couldn't really bend or straighten
my knee at all," Hermiz said. "It
took me a really long time to get
that range back.
"Basically, after I got my cast,
for the next three or four months,
I was probably in the most pain I
