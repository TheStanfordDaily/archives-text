# Volleyball sticks a fork in Weenies

In case you missed it — and judging by the attendance at Maples
Pavilion, you did — the No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team held a
weenie roast last night.
Winning its 20th consecutive match before an embarrassingly small
number of students, the Cardinal (23-2, 16-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
swept the Bears 15-7, 15-4, 15-9.
"The student support is sad," said Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"We're offering the best that collegiate women's volleyball has to offer,
and no one cares."
Had anyone shown up, they would have witnessed the hottest vol
leyball team in the nation demolish a Pac-10 opponent that had been
playing extremely well in recent weeks.
Despite their recent success, the Bears were no match for a Stanford
team that boasts superior talent, experience and teamwork.
"These [easy matches] aren't always easy," Shaw said. "When you
know that disaster would have to strike [before the team would losej,
it's hard to motivate."
While not playing its best volleyball of the season, the Cardinal man
aged to perform well at times, particularly in game two. In addition,
Shaw was able to use all of his available players.
"It's good to get everyone in there," Shaw said. "We kept up our
level of play pretty well."
Specifically, game three saw some dazzling setting by senior reserve
Maureen McLaren. After a competitive beginning to the game, Stan
ford slowly pulled away thanks to McLaren's efforts. A nifty backset to
sophomore setter / outside hitter Lisa Sharpley resulted in a key side
out at 13-6 that allowed Stanford to reach game point. Though Cal
managed to score three more points, the outcome was inevitable.
"IMcLaren] did a great job," Shaw said. "It's the little things like
that that we work on in spring
practice that pay off. Should we
not be able to use Wendell and
Sharpley, she's our emergency
setter."
Game two witnessed Stan
ford's most dominating perfor
mance of the night. After the
Bears closed to 4-3, the Cardinal
reeled off 11 of the game's next 12
points to win 15-4.
A slight adjustment in defen
sive tactics from game one paid
off in game two, as Stanford's
blockers began to challenge
attacks from the back row. The
strategy worked, as Cal began to

hit balls long routinely.
"Originally, we had decided
not to block any back row
attempts," Shaw said. "But they
hit well [from the back], and
scored some points from there. By
two-thirds of the way into game
one, we decided to challenge them
— not so much to block balls, but
to give them something to think
about while hitting. It worked."
Game one was characterized
by slow starts from both teams, as
neither team could effectively
string points together. Eventual
ly, Stanford's strong blocking
attack wore down the Bears.
"They did a nice job blocking
tonight," said Cal coach Sue
Woodstra. "I don't know what it
was, but we came out flat tonight.
We olaved better than the hist

time we played them, but it's
nothing like the way we can play."
At the same time, Woodstra
acknowledged that Stanford took
the Bears completely out of their
game plan.
"The last few weeks, they've
been playing much better as a
team," Woodstra said. "They just
took us out of our game. Playing
like this, they should be a Final-
Four team."
The three-game victory leaves
Stanford two wins away from the
first undefeated season in the
Pac-10 since accomplished
that feat in 1992. For the Cardi
nal, the win was its 29th consecu
tive home victory and 18th
straight conference win at Maples
Pavilion. Overall, the Cardinal
has won 55 of its last 58 matches.
