### Alan Eaton Contributing writer 
The final match of the 1995
season for the Stanford men's
soccer team (5-11-1 overall, 2-4-0

Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) will take place at 7:30 p.m.
tonight at San Jose State (5-11-1,
2-3-1). Stanford hopes to rebound
from a 2-0 loss to 16th-ranked
Santa Clara last Sunday whereas

the Spartans are riding the wave
of euphoria that accompanied a 4-
3 triumph against Cal-State
Northridge. San Jose State had
dropped its five previous matches.
"Based on just the records, it

should be a close match," said
Stanford head coach Colin Lin
dores. With a win, the Cardinal
would surpass the five wins the
team recorded last year.
The Spartans feature an abso
lute dynamo in forward Jason Mar
tinez. Martinez scored two goals
against Cal-State Northridge,
bringing his season total to a mon
strous 10 goals and four assists.
Midfielder Espen Soraa ranks sec
ond in scoring with three goals and
three assists.
Spartans Keith Bateman and
Brandon Main split time at goal
keeper. However, Bateman holds
the statistical edge over Main in
all keeper categories: 1.55 goals
against average compared to 2.77,
58 saves compared to 53 and three
shutouts compared to none.
Sophomore Eric Vandevelde
leads the Cardinal offense with
four goals and three assists.
Senior Ryan Estevez and fresh
man A.J. Sauer have added three
goals and one assist each.
"The game should be an enter
taining one," Lindores said. "San
Jose State plays a style of soccer
similar to ours. It will not be as
direct a game as Santa Clara
because San Jose State tries to
work the ball."
Stanford will likely play a com-

soned scrappers and young pups
against the Spartans. Lindores
has the task of combining seniors
on the way out with freshmen on
the way in while fielding a team
competitive enough to win the
season finale. Indeed, as the sea
son is coming to a close, Lindores
must concern himself with next
year's campaign.
The match signifies the pass
ing of another Stanford men's
soccer generation.
Senior co-captains Carmen
D'Onofrio and Chet Zimmer as
well as fellow classmates Ryan
Estevez and Steve Kirschbaum
exemplified leadership and valor
ous play all season long. If all
goes well, the seniors will earn a
win before relinquishing the
reigns of the team.
"All the seniors have been
thinking about the game for
awhile," D'Onofrio said. "It's
finally sank in.
"With this being our last
game, we want it to be a game to
remember. We really want to win
this. We'll go out shooting to win.
We're going to give it our best
and hope for a good result."
