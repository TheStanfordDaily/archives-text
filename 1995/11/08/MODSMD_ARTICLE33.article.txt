# NBA rookie report card
## 
### 
For many, the opening week of the
NBA season does not bring loads of
excitement. Teams still struggle at
times, working out their offseason kinks
and acclimating themselves with new per
sonnel. For the first couple of weeks, fans
will witness missed free throws, three-sec
ond violations and countless turnovers. Yet,
after a summer of speculation, the first
weeks of the season does provide us with a
sneak preview of the future stars of the
NBA. Of course, judgments based on a few
days of competition are hardly conclusive,
but my "speculation" is more appropriately
considered "truth."

Who better to start the Class of 1995
analysis with than Joe Smith? Coming in as
the first overall pick in the draft and resid
ing just across the bay with the Golden
State Warriors, Smith has been given an
auspicious hand with which to play. r l he
former Terrapin superstar has all the skill
to be a serious factor in the NBA for a long
time, but physically, he doesn't have the
ability to dominate just yet.
Fortunately for Joe, playing in Oakland
gives him the exact opportunity he needs â€”
the opportunity to develop his game physi
cally and mentally. With Tim Hardaway,
Chris Mullin, Latrell Sprewell and B.J.
Armstrong highlighting their roster, the

Warriors will not be depending on Smith for
double figures in scoring and rebounding
night in and night out. With the pressure
off, Smith can work on adjusting to the
power forward slot NBA-style and bulking
up in the weight room.
Smith might struggle at times this sea
son. He may find getting shots extremely
difficult and he may get pushed around
down low. Yet, Smith will provide athleti
cism every night. He will crash the boards
hard and will not hesitate to dive on the
floor for a loose ball. Essentially, Smith will
find a way to contribute, whether it shows
up in the box score or not. By the end of the
season, Smith will reap the benefits of those
sown seeds and find more success scoring
and rebounding, just as he used to in Col
lege Park. But for now, Smith will have to
take it slow and focus on adjusting.
The second pick, Antonio McDyess, finds
himself in a similar situation in Denver.
Bailed out of obscurity in a seriously dubi
ous trade on the part of the Los Angeles
Clippers, McDyess, like Smith, is not the
focus of his squad. Unlike Smith, however,
the youngster out of Alabama physically
has everything Smith is lacking. Right now,
McDyess can bang with Karl Malone or
Charles Barkley underneath the hoop, and
he will benefit tremendously from not hav
ing the pressure, as he would have had in
L.A., to bring his team out of the cellar.
Denver is a playoff-caliber squad with a lot
of young talent, which leaves McDyess to
his strengths: banging and boarding.
Out on the East Coast, the Sixers may
have finally broken out of their draft slump.
Often times, NBA teams are forced to draft
players who physically do not fit their posi
tion. Joe Smith and Corliss Williamson are
perfect examples at the power forward posi-


Courtney
Mann
tion. Michigan State's Shawn
Respert may be too small to play
the off-guard spot. Yet, with the
new big-guard trend in the East,
Jerry Stackhouse fits the mold
fiawlessly. The third pick out of
North Carolina seemingly has it
all: the build, the talent, the mind
and the heart. In addition, he has
a 7-foot-6 constant reminder
planted right next to him on the
bench of what not to become.
Stackhouse has the ability to
dominate a game like the best in
the NBA and will fulfill that
potential sooner than anyone in
his rookie class.
With the No. 4 pick, the Wash
ington Bullets may have selected
the only player more immature
than the 19-year-old high school
kid that followed in the draft. Not
only did the Bullets overstock
themselves with another young
power forward in litis heed Wal
lace, but they also overstocked
themselves with another attitude.
Despite what I'm sure was a rigor
ous two-year academic stint at
North Carolina, Wallace could
probably have benefited from a
couple more years of high school.
Wallace has already mac'e a fool of
himself in this young season, as
Stackhouse had to get in his face
and settle him down in the Sixers

105-103 victory last rnday. Its
one thing if a veteran teammate
needs to cool you off, Has heed, but
a rookie on the opposing team?
The Minnesota Timberwolves
took a chance on high-school All-
American Kevin Garnett and will
cash in if they stick with him. He
may be too lanky to play the four
spot in the NBA, but the fact that
at 6-foot-10 he has the athleti
cism to play small forward is
frightening. At that size, Garnett
made it to the finals of the high
school Ail-American three-point
contest. If he can stay on the
straight and narrow, fans may
find a treat in Garnett.
The No. 6 pick, Bryant Reeves
out of Oklahoma State, has good
size and will be around the league
for a long time. Since he's not
that exciting, we'll go on.
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire
will take the reigns in Toronto.
He can shoot with the best of
them and, as the main man in
Toronto, he will get all the shots
he wants, which is a good number.
Watch for that field-goal percent
age to drop however. Stoudamire,
at under six feet, is an endangered
species in the Eastern Conference,
and natural selection may not be
too kind to him. The big guard
seems to be taking over, and with
Michael Jordan, Penny Hardaway
and Steve Smith in his face,
Stoudamire might not get the
good looks he needs. Sorry
Damon, no more 5-foot-10 Pac-10

point guards to bust on.
Outside of the top seven, there
will be some sleepers in the draft
as always. Wisconsin's Michael
Finley fits in extremely well in
Phoenix, and with Dan Majerle's
departure freeing up minutes at
the three spot, Finley may be an
extremely valuable role player for
the Suns in their run for the title.
Believe it or not, George Zedik
is turning heads in Charlotte. In
his season opener, the former
Bruin looked more comfortable in
the NBA paint than he did at
Maples. Zedik will never be a
dominant superstar, but never
theless, the Hornets could use
some consistency. Oregon State's
Brent Barry has the genes and
the skills to shock the league with
his versatility, but unfortunately,
the Clippers and superstardom
have never been compatible.
The race for the 1995 Rookie of
the Year should be interesting.
Stackhouse's 24.5 points-per
game average will demand atten
tion, as will McDyess' double fig
ures in rebounds. Smith will come
on strong at the end, arguing
improvement as the criteria by
which to give him the award, and
Garnett will be a constant high
light reel. Regardless of the out
come, the Class of '95 should give
the NBA some of the stars who,
along with the Kidds, the Hills
and the Robinsons, will take over
after the Jordans, Barkleys and
Olajuwons pass along the torch.
