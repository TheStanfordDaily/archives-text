# NBA rookie report card
## 
### 
For many, the opening week of the
NBA season does not bring loads of
excitement. Teams still struggle at
times, working out their offseason kinks
and acclimating themselves with new per
sonnel. For the first couple of weeks, fans
will witness missed free throws, three-sec
ond violations and countless turnovers. Yet,
after a summer of speculation, the first
weeks of the season does provide us with a
sneak preview of the future stars of the
NBA. Of course, judgments based on a few
days of competition are hardly conclusive,
but my "speculation" is more appropriately
considered "truth."

Who better to start the Class of 1995
analysis with than Joe Smith? Coming in as
the first overall pick in the draft and resid
ing just across the bay with the Golden
State Warriors, Smith has been given an
auspicious hand with which to play. r l he
former Terrapin superstar has all the skill
to be a serious factor in the NBA for a long
time, but physically, he doesn't have the
ability to dominate just yet.
Fortunately for Joe, playing in Oakland
gives him the exact opportunity he needs â€”
the opportunity to develop his game physi
cally and mentally. With Tim Hardaway,
Chris Mullin, Latrell Sprewell and B.J.
Armstrong highlighting their roster, the

Warriors will not be depending on Smith for
double figures in scoring and rebounding
night in and night out. With the pressure
off, Smith can work on adjusting to the
power forward slot NBA-style and bulking
up in the weight room.
Smith might struggle at times this sea
son. He may find getting shots extremely
difficult and he may get pushed around
down low. Yet, Smith will provide athleti
cism every night. He will crash the boards
hard and will not hesitate to dive on the
floor for a loose ball. Essentially, Smith will
find a way to contribute, whether it shows
up in the box score or not. By the end of the
season, Smith will reap the benefits of those
sown seeds and find more success scoring
and rebounding, just as he used to in Col
lege Park. But for now, Smith will have to
take it slow and focus on adjusting.
The second pick, Antonio McDyess, finds
himself in a similar situation in Denver.
Bailed out of obscurity in a seriously dubi
ous trade on the part of the Los Angeles
Clippers, McDyess, like Smith, is not the
focus of his squad. Unlike Smith, however,
the youngster out of Alabama physically
has everything Smith is lacking. Right now,
McDyess can bang with Karl Malone or
Charles Barkley underneath the hoop, and
he will benefit tremendously from not hav
ing the pressure, as he would have had in
L.A., to bring his team out of the cellar.
Denver is a playoff-caliber squad with a lot
of young talent, which leaves McDyess to
his strengths: banging and boarding.
Out on the East Coast, the Sixers may
have finally broken out of their draft slump.
Often times, NBA teams are forced to draft
players who physically do not fit their posi
tion. Joe Smith and Corliss Williamson are
perfect examples at the power forward posi-
