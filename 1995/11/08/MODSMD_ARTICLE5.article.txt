# Mountain lion reportedly seen just off campus
## 
### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
A mountain lion has been reported lurking in the
wilds surrounding the Stanford campus in the past
five days, Stanford Police said.
The mountain lion would most likely be roaming
the area looking for food, said Philippe Cohen, ad
ministrative director of Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve. Four sightings have been reported.
"Wherever you have deer or small animals, you'll
have mountain lions looking for food," said Cohen.
However, Cohen was skeptical as to whether the
animals spotted were actually mountain lions.
Stanford Police Capt. Ilaoul Niemeyer said the
first sighting occurred Thursday around twilight
when a News Service employee encountered what she
believed to be a mountain lion off a bicycle trail in the
Foothills near the corner of Alpine and Arastradero
roads. She saw the animal come
out of the bushes chasing a deer
and then saunter back, Niemeyer
said.
The second sighting occurred
Friday when an employee from
the Stanford Linear Accelerator

Center saw a lion across the fence
in Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve. The employee was driving
his truck and said the mountain
lion smelled him from afar while
walking alone near the fence.
The third sighting occurred
Saturday afternoon when a moun
tain lion was spotted on Slj\C
property near Collider Hall.
The most recent sighting
occurred Sunday at 5:53 p.m.

when a SLAC employee saw a
mountain lion cross a small mead
ow on the SLAC property in the
vicinity of Sand Hill Road. The
employee said the animal looked to
weigh between 180 and 200
pounds.
Stanford Police warned hikers
and joggers to be careful when in
the Foothills and other open
spaces.
"Mountain lions will he aggres

sive depending upon what they're
doing," Cohen added.
At least three previous moun
tain lion sightings have occurred
around Stanford. In September
1994, two mountain lion sight
ings were reported. One moun
tain lion was spotted in the Lagu
nita lakebed, while the other was
sighted near the Dish in a woodsy
spot at the top of a footpath lead
ing from the intersection of Stan

ford Avenue and Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
In addition, two SLAC employ
ees spotted a mountain lion last
April near the intersection of
Alpine and Whiskey Hill Roads on
the property of Jasper Ridge.
"If you encounter a mountain
lion, you should look as big and
loud as possible," Cohen said. "You
should make a lot of noise and
stand as tall as you can. You should

not turn your back on it and run."
"A mountain lion is a solo
hunter, and if it gets hurt, it dies,"
Cohen said. "It will not attack for
food unless it has a real high confi
dence level that it will not get hurt.
The bigger you look, the less appe
tizing you look."
Anyone who spots a mountain
lion should quickly and quietly
leave the area and contact police
from the nearest phone.
