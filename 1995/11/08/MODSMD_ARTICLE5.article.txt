A mountain lion has been reported lurking in the
wilds surrounding the Stanford campus in the past
five days, Stanford Police said.
The mountain lion would most likely be roaming
the area looking for food, said Philippe Cohen, ad
ministrative director of Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve. Four sightings have been reported.
"Wherever you have deer or small animals, you'll
have mountain lions looking for food," said Cohen.
However, Cohen was skeptical as to whether the
animals spotted were actually mountain lions.
Stanford Police Capt. Ilaoul Niemeyer said the
first sighting occurred Thursday around twilight
when a News Service employee encountered what she
believed to be a mountain lion off a bicycle trail in the
Foothills near the corner of Alpine and Arastradero
