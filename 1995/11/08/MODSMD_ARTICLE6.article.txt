For most students at Stan
ford, the turmoil in the former
Yugoslavia seems distant and
confusing.
But for Sonja Kuftinec, a
graduate student in drama, that
turmoil became personal and im
mediate when she spent a month
last summer teaching drama in
Croatian refugee camps.
"For me, theater is always em
bedded in a social context," said

Kuftinec learned of the oppor
tunity to teach at the camps
through Cornerstone, a Los An
geles-based organization about
which Kuftinec is writing her
dissertation.
"Cornerstone adapts plays
and performs them in communi
ties, [re-writing] them so they
have local resonance," explained
Kuftinec. "Their intention is to

make theater vital to its audience,
not to make theater elite. They
try to engage people in the actual
performance."
Through Cornerstone, Kuftinec
became familiar with a group
called Suncokret, which brings
volunteers to Croatia to organize
activities in the refugee camps.
Last November, Kuftinec,
whose father is Croatian, began
developing ideas about projects
that she could conduct with
refugees in the town of Varazhdin.
She also began corresponding with
Sabrina Peck, a choreographer
and photographer living in New
York, who eventually accompanied
Kuftinec to Croatia. Kuftinec also
applied for and received financial
assistance from philanthropic
organizations such as the Mellon
Foundation, Arts Link and Stan
ford's own Haas Center for Public
Service.
From the Haas Center,
Kuftinec was awarded a Kennedy
fellowship. Each year, 10 or 15

students are awarded these fel
lowships to perform community
service.
Once in Croatia, Kuftinec
worked with two separate groups,
one composed of children and the
other of teens and adults. "We
were not interested in doing a play
or in having them do characters,"
Kuftinec said. "We were interest
ed in having them tell their sto
ries, in structuring workshops in a
way to generate material."
Time was a constraint, espe
cially since Kuftinec intended for
the various activities to culminate
in a performance. "We had three
weeks," said Kuftinec. "We had to
create something that instantly
could go on stage."
Kuftinec and Peck worked
with the refugees on ideas about
space, motion and memory.
Because of the language barrier,
body movement was particularly
important, Kuftinec said.
In one exercise, the refugees
listed what they brought with
them when they had left home.
For many refugees, Kuftinec said,
their departure had occurred in
the middle of the night at gun
point.

"A Serbian with a rifle comes
to your house and says you have
15 minutes to pack your things,"
Kuftinec said. "He has a piece of
paper with [a list of] your proper
ty and belongings, and he forces
you to sign a contract saying
you're giving it to a Serbian.
Sometimes they gave you three
days to sell your belongings."
In the dramatic exercise, in
response to the question of what
possession they had brought with
them to the camps, refugees'
answers included "photographs,"
"sneakers," "my brother" and
"only what I was wearing and
food for one day."
Another exercise was entitled
"Odakle Ste, Gdje Ste, Gdje
Idete," which translates as
"where are you from, where are
you now, where are you going."
"We were envisioning the
future," Kuftinec said. "We didn't
want to manipulate the drama of
war, but we wanted to acknowl
edge that home was a place the
refugees were not, and to give
them the opportunity to envision
being in a (better] place.
"It was empowering for them
to think beyond their [current sit

uation]," Kuftinec added. "We
wanted them to re-connect their
personal lives with their artistic
lives. (Merely] coming out and
saying life is hard for refugees is
not very interesting and not very
revealing."
Kuftinec said that she and
Peck were careful to avoid being
maudlin or intrusive. "I'm wary
of theater that tries to be therapy.
I don't feel like I'm a therapist;
I'm a director."
However, Kuftinec admitted,
"You can't help becoming invest
ed in the lives of these people."
Refugees account for 10 per
cent of the Croatian population,
Kuftinec said, and among the
refugees are many "professors,
students, intellectuals and (mem
bers of the] middle class."
Most refugees are Bosnian
Muslims, Bosnian Croats or non
nomadic gypsies. Although lines
between the three groups are
often blurry, members of the
groups expressed hostility or bit
terness toward one another,
Kuftinec explained. Divisions also
exist between refugees who live in
the camps and refugees who live
with friends or relatives and are

often better off materially.
"The situation is tremendously
complex, which doesn't mean that
people shouldn't be aware of it,"
Kuftinec said.
Kuftinec said she had imagined
most refugees as "downtrodden
old women with no teeth," when
in fact many refugees were quite
"vibrant."
Kuftinec met a young couple,
Goran and Amra, who had three
children under the age of five.
"Amra is a former model and has
a crew cut shock of white-blonde
hair," Kuftinec said. "Goran is a
goateed musician — he played the
bongos, he played things on the
table." At night, Kuftinec would
sit with Goran, Amra and others,
"drinking coffee and singing."
Yet, Kuftinec added, "Goran is
really thin. He's lost 40 pounds
since the start of the war. He has
no job — he works where he can
on the black market — and he's
consumed with worry." The cou
ple's youngest child, a six-month
old baby, had been born blind, and
the resources to operate on her
were unavailable in Croatia.
The family was awaiting the
chance to emigrate to the United

States, a process which usually
takes about a year. Explained
Kuftinec, "An older psychologist
from West Virginia got her whole
church to sponsor (the family]."
Goran, who had taught himself
English, spent much of his time
poring over an atlas of West Vir
ginia.
"They're tremendously bored,"
Kuftinec said of Goran and Amra
as well as of other refugees. "The
Muslims can't legally hold a job,
or attend the university." Many
adults spend the day playing
cards or simply sitting around,
according to Kuftinec. The chil
dren, while usually well-behaved
during dramatic exercises, would
run wild outside of the work
shops. "They would spit on each
other or pinch me," said Kuftinec.
The dramatic exercises,
Kuftinec said, helped give a kind
of daily structure and purpose to
the refugees.
"Not to say that this changed
the lives of the people involved,
but it was a moment where people
came together. I think of theater
as something that can really build
community, against tremendous
odds."
