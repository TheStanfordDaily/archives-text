## 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
Last night's defeat of Palo
Alto's Measure R demonstrat
ed voter confidence in the
city's management of com
mercial development on Stan
ford property, according to
several University and city
officials.
'"The outcome reflects the
voters' attitude toward change
and their confidence in the cur
rent council," said Gail Wool
ley, co-chair of the steering
committee of the "No on Mea
sure R" campaign. "It indicates
the voters' belief in the signifi
cance of Stanford [commercial
development! and its impor
tance to the city."
Andy Coe, Stanford director
of community relations, said he
believes voters are satisfied
with the current review process
which new land development
projects at the University must
undergo.
"It's better for everyone to
have a constructive dialogue
instead of laying down a mea
sure against development from
the very beginning," he said
last night, after preliminary
results indicated the measure
would fail.
"Eveiything will come out
all right in the public process of
review that we now use," Coe
added.
With the measure defeated,
the University can proceed
with its proposal to expand the

Stanford Shopping Center by
more than 140,000 square feet.
In addition, the University will
not be forced to shelve its plans
to potentially expand the Medi
cal School by 400,000 square
feet.
"It's nice not to have a mea
sure right out of the chute"
which would hinder the expan
sion process, Coe said.
Palo Alto Mayor Joe Simi
tian said he did not expect the
failure of Measure R to affect
how the city handles develop
ment proposals concerning
Stanford land.
"I expect that the individual
projects that Stanford brings
forward will get the care and
scrutiny that they require," he
said last night. "That has been
and always will be the expecta
tion in the community."
Will Beckett, the other co
chair of the "No on Measure R"
steering committee, agreed
that Stanford would not
change its current methods of
working with the city regarding
development proposals.
"Stanford works with many
agencies to manage their devel
opment projects, and they have
better traffic management
around their developed areas,"
he said.
He emphasized the Univer
sity's interest in working with
the city council during the
development process and how
the measure's defeat would
allow Stanford to continue
such a close interaction.
