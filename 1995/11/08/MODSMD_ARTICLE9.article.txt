## Rape trial begins in Okinawa 
### 
NAILA, Japan (AP) — The three
U.S. servicemen spotted the 12-year
old schoolgirl as she stood outside a sta
tionery store where she had gone to
buy a notebook.
According to prosecutors, the men
grabbed her, shoved her into a car and
bound her with tape that they had
bought, along with condoms, at a gro
cery store on a U.S. airbase. Then, they
drove her down a lonely road lined with
fields of sugar cane.
Navy Seaman Marcus D. Gill calmly
confessed yesterday to raping the girl
— a crime that has damaged America's
security ties with its most important
Pacific ally. Marine Pfcs. liodrico Harp
and Kendrick Ledet admitted to help
ing him.
The rape has prompted an outpour
ing of anger on Okinawa, where more
than 26,000 U.S. troops, including the
largest contingent of Marines outside
of the United States, are stationed.
The uproar showed little sign of

abating yesterday as dozens of
reporters and Okinawans filled the
spartan Naha District Court chamber
No. 201 for the opening of the trial.
Prosecutors gave a graphic account
of the crime, saying it began on the
afternoon of Sept. 4 when Gill, Harp
and Ledet were out cruising in a rented
car. The rape was Gill's idea, they said.
Kirst the three men bought the con
doms and tape at a grocery story on a
U.S. airbase. For the next few hours,
they drove around a nearby town in
search of prey, prosecutors said.
Their search ended at about 8 p.m.,
when they noticed the girl, still dressed
in her school uniform.
While Gill waited in the car, the
prosecutors said, llarp approached her
as though to ask directions, and before
she could answer, Ledet grabbed her
from behind.
Ledet and Harp allegedly shoved her
into the car and bound her with the
tape as Gill drove down a remote road.

Gill confessed to raping the girl and
then dumping her in a sugar cane field
before returning to his base.
In pleading guilty to charges of con
finement and rape resulting in injury,
Gill, 22, of Woodville, Texas, could face
life in prison in Japan.
Ledet, 20, of Waycross, Ga., and
Harp, 21, of Griffin, Ga., face the same
charges and are being tried with Gill.
On Tuesday, they acknowledged their
role in abducting the girl, but denied
penetrating her.
Mitsunobu Matsunaga, Harp's
lawyer, said Harp was coerced by U.S.
military investigators into signing a
confession saying that he had partici
pated in the rape itself.
He said he would contest the credi
bility of the statement in the next trial
session, scheduled for Dec. 4. Court
sources said a final verdict for all three
was possible before the end of the year
— which would be unusually speedy for
Japanese courts.
