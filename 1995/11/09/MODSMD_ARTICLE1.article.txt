# Disabled access limited at centers
## Students, directors say unreachable centers can't serve broad audience 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Wheelchair inaccessibility at cam
pus cultural centers has been a mount
ing problem, and center leaders are
angry that because of inaccessibility,
programs are not fulfilling their com
mitment to diversity.
"Our community is one of the most
diverse anywhere," said David Barba,
co-student director ofthe Lesbian, (Jay
and Bisexual Community Center. "Dis

abled students are a vital part of our di
versity."
"It makes it really difficult for dis
abled students when we don't have ac
cess," said senior Bliss Temple, who
uses a wheelchair.
"The argument is that the centers
could just move their programs, but
part of the idea of the center is to have
a safe place where students can go,"
Temple said.
Currently, centers state on their
fliers that programs can be moved to

areas with access if disabled students
call to arrange for it.
But Temple said moving programs
is logistically and psychologically diffi
cult for both students and event orga
nizers.
"It is especially difficult to call when
a student is concerned with issues of
privacy, such as attending a coming
out support group at the LGBCC,"
Temple said.
Barba echoed those sentiments.
"People aren't taking advantage of

the opportunity to call and move an
event, which means we are placing too
big of a burden on students," Barba
said.
Donna Davies, a graduate student
act ive in the Disability Resource Cen
ter, said she feels the purpose of a cul
tural center is to promote inclusion. By
not creating access, Davies said, the
University is making the assumption
that disabled people can't be interested
