# Disabled access limited at centers
## Students, directors say unreachable centers can't serve broad audience 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Wheelchair inaccessibility at cam
pus cultural centers has been a mount
ing problem, and center leaders are
angry that because of inaccessibility,
programs are not fulfilling their com
mitment to diversity.
"Our community is one of the most
diverse anywhere," said David Barba,
co-student director ofthe Lesbian, (Jay
and Bisexual Community Center. "Dis

abled students are a vital part of our di
versity."
"It makes it really difficult for dis
abled students when we don't have ac
cess," said senior Bliss Temple, who
uses a wheelchair.
"The argument is that the centers
could just move their programs, but
part of the idea of the center is to have
a safe place where students can go,"
Temple said.
Currently, centers state on their
fliers that programs can be moved to

areas with access if disabled students
call to arrange for it.
But Temple said moving programs
is logistically and psychologically diffi
cult for both students and event orga
nizers.
"It is especially difficult to call when
a student is concerned with issues of
privacy, such as attending a coming
out support group at the LGBCC,"
Temple said.
Barba echoed those sentiments.
"People aren't taking advantage of

the opportunity to call and move an
event, which means we are placing too
big of a burden on students," Barba
said.
Donna Davies, a graduate student
act ive in the Disability Resource Cen
ter, said she feels the purpose of a cul
tural center is to promote inclusion. By
not creating access, Davies said, the
University is making the assumption
that disabled people can't be interested

in more than disabilities issues.
"It's like, if you are disabled,
you are white, straight and have
no religious affiliations," Temple
said.
At Tuesday's ASSU Senate
meeting, disabled students and
LGBCC representatives ques
tioned Provost Condoleezza Rice
on wheelchair accessibility to the
cultural centers around campus,
in the Old Union Clubhouse and
in separately housed centers like
the Black Community Services
Center and the LGBCC.
Rice said at that meeting that
she would like nothing better
than to have the Old Union Club
house accessible.
"I am aware of the problem,"
Rice said.
Although she said that eleva
tors are a possibility for the club
house, Rice didn't as clearly
address the problem of the sepa
rately housed centers.
BCSC director Morris Graves
said the leaders of the ethnic cen
ters have been addressing the
problem at their weekly meetings.
"The Black House is an old
building," Graves said. "For dis
abled students to have access, we
would have to build a ramp
extending into the parking lot,
and almost every doorway would
have to be widened.
"I want the students of this
campus to feel they can come to
the Black House and be involved,"
he said. "I have been trying to
make accommodations despite my
financial and physical limits, but
progress is difficult."
Temple agreed that little has
been done to help the ethnic cen
ters become more accessible.
"The University has done
nothing at all to change accessi
bility to the cultural centers," she
said.
DRC Director Nancy Deason
agreed, but said the University

has taken steps in other areas,
focusing on residences and on
accessibility at academic pro
grams.
"We are about do a self-study
and look to see where we need to
improve," Deason said. "The eth
nic centers need to be included."
One of the few centers that is
wheelchair accessible is El Centro
Chicano.
"I think we are pretty lucky,"
said Chris Clarke, assistant direc
tor of El Centro. A ramp was built
several years ago to aid a
wheelchair user who was working
there at the time.
"The only way he could get in
was to get off the chair and pull
himself up the stairs, dragging
the chair after him," said El Cen
tro Director Frances Morales.
"He was so happy about the ramp
— it did a lot for his self-esteem to
enter the building like other stu
dents."
Davies said she is bothered by
the University's failure to attend
to access problems in cultural
centers.
"I worry about big institutions
like this," she said. "Are they only
responding to disabilities as liabil
ities? They should act because it
is the right thing to do."
Carla Dunn, program coordi
nator at the DRC, said she feels
there is new attention to the issue
coming from cultural center
directors and new Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais.
"They are speaking out, and
that is making a difference,"
Dunn said. "There is a higher
consciousness to disabilities."
Asian American Activities Cen
ter Director Rick Yuen said he has
spoken with structural engineers
about improving access to the Old
Union Clubhouse, where the cen
ter is housed.
"There are two proposals for
creating accessibility — one
would include a ramp beginning
in White Plaza, and the other
would include having an elevator
system," Yuen said.
He said there are problems

with both choices: The ramp
would reach only the first and sec
ond floors and thus would not
provide access to the campus min
istries on the third floor, and the
elevator would be much more
costly.
The current system of moving
programs to accommodate dis

abled students is not enough,
Yuen said, due to the fact that a
strong function of the centers is
just having students there,
the libraries and attending gener
al meetings.
"Our activities are of a commu
nity nature, and we would rather
hold them here," Yuen said.

The steep stairway leading to the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
