## Doubts about patient's illness Kevorkian accused 
### 
•SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP)
Dr. Jack Kevorkian took part in a
26th suicide yesterday — that of a
58-year-old cancer patient who the
medical examiner later determined
had no lingering trace of the dis
ease.
"There was no cancer," Dr.
Kanvi Virani, deputy chief medical
examiner for Oakland County, said
after an autopsy.
The body of Patricia Cashman
was found wrapped in a blanket in
the back seat of an old car outside
the morgue.
Cashman, who ran a travel
agency in San Marcos, Calif., suf
fered for three years from breast
cancer that had spread throughout
her body and had recently lost her
ability to walk, Kevorkian lawyer
Geoffrey Fieger said earlier yester
day. Fieger said the woman feared
ending up a "vegetable."
However, Virani said that while
the woman had undergone a mas
tectomy on her right breast, he
found no cancer in her lymph

nodes, liver or other internal
organs, where he had expected to
see the disease.
I le said that he hadn't examined
her brain and spinal cord but that
it was highly unlikely the ameer
would appear there if it hadn't
shown up elsewhere.
Fieger called Virani's assertions
"outrageous lies" and accused the
doctor of an anti-Kevorkian agen
da.
"The body he has at the Oak
land County Medical Examiner is
bald because she was undergoing
chemotherapy for metastatic bone
cancer," Fieger said.
He told CBS Radio that the
breast cancer had spread to all of
Cash man's bones, her bones were
crumbling and she was on mor
phine: "I promise you, and you can
take this to the bank, she was dying
of bone cancer, the most painful
kind of cancer."
The medical examiner listed the
cause of death as carbon monoxide
poisoning.
