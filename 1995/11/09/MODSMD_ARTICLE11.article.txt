# Fighting deportation

■ SAN FRANCISCO (AF)
Saying aliens have the same
rights of free speech and associa
tion as citizens, a federal appeals
court ruled yesterday that a
group of Palestinians could fight
deportation on the grounds that
they were allegedly targeted for
their political views.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals rebuffed the Clinton
administration on two issues: t he
administration's claim that resi
dent aliens had fewer constitu
tional protections than citizens,
and its attempt to deport two
men on the basis of secret evi
dence alleging terrorist connec
tions.
"Aliens in the United States
enjoy full First Amendment
rights," said Judge Dorothy Nel
son in the 3-0 ruling. . . It is
thus especially appropriate that
the First Amendment principle of
tolerance for different voices
restrain our decisions to expel a
participant in that (immigrant)
community from our midst."
She also said undisclosed evi
dence, which can be used to keep

foreigners out of the country, was
"inherently unfair" in proceed
ings to deport an alien because of
alleged national security con
cerns.
A "counter terrorism" bill sup
ported by President Clinton
would allow deportations based
on political affiliations and secret
evidence, said Georgetown law
professor David Cole, a lawyer in
the current case. He said the rul
ing should cast doubt on the con
stitutionality of the bill.
The case involves eight Los
Angeles-area aliens — seven
Palestinians and the Kenyan
born wife of one of them — whom
the government has been trying
to deport since 1987.
Federal immigration officials
say the eight are associates or
supporters of the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, a
radical offshoot of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. The
PFLP opposes the current peace
negotiations between the PLC)
and Israel and is considered a ter
rorist organization by the United
States.
