# Powell announces he will not run

WASHINGTON (AP) -
After months of "prayerful con
sideration" that captivated the
nation, Colin Powell awkwardly
embraced the Republican Party
yesterday but said he would not
run for president in 1996
because it was "a calling that I
do not yet hear."

Ending an extraordinary
political mystery, Powell ruled
out seeking any elected office
next year. Instead, he said he
would dedicate himself to restor
ing "the spirit of Lincoln" to a
Republican Party he said was a
lot more diverse than many con
servatives would admit.

"I'm sorry I disappointed
you," the retired general said in a
poignant tribute to the thou
sands of everyday Americans
who had urged him to run, in
person, through letters and by
joining draft Powell efforts.
"We're devastated," said
James Lynch, a New York

lawyer involved in the draft
effort. Said Tim Bush, an orga
nizer in New Hampshire: "I
think really the country is the
loser."
Such support brought him to
the brink of a candidacy, Powell
said, but in the end he stepped
back from elective politics — for
now anyway.
To run for president, he said,
would demand "a passion and
commitment that, despite my
every effort, I do not have for
political life, because such a life
requires a calling that I do not
yet hear."
"For me to pretend otherwise
would not be honest to myself, it
would not be honest to the Amer
ican people."
Powell also ruled out being
the GOP's vice presidential nom
inee, but said he might consider
an appointed government posi
tion. Many Republicans, even
Powell critics, said the retired
general still was almost certain
to be considered for the No. 2
spot on the GOP ticket.
Powell's decision left 10
declared Republican candidates
and one GOP giant still sitting
on the fence: House Speaker
Newt Gingrich.
As he bowed out of the presi
dential race, Powell for the first
time pledged political allegiance
— to a Republican Party he said
was rightly dedicated to balanc
ing the budget, cutting taxes and
shrinking government.
"I believe they have ideas and
energy at this time that I can
align with," he said.
In another sign of his awk
ward transition from soldier to
author to prominent Republican,
Powell would not promise to
back the 1996 GOP nominee,
saying he wanted to watch the
campaign unfold. Nor did he rule
out voting for President Clinton
next year.
In the short term, Powell's
decision was seen as a boon to
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,
whose position as the GOP front
runner would have been imperiled
by a Powell candidacy. The deci
sion came amid some evidence
that conservatives wary of Powell
were rallying to Dole's side.
