LAST WEEK, John Shoven,
dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences,
outlined plans to "restructure" the
74-year-old Food Research Insti
tute as a cost-cutting measure.
While the wisdom of this move
is being debated, one thing is
already certain. Shoven's remarks
that "the Food Research Institute
was not a program identified with
a great university" are an embar
rassment to the University, and
showed a kick of respect for the
students, staff and professors who
work and teach at the institute.
Shoven also said that because
schools comparable to Stanford do
not have a distinct food research
arm, the institute is an easy and
obvious target for review. Such
inappropriate statements have
served only to demoralize those
involved with the institute.
Additionally, Shoven's remarks
point to another disturbing trend:
the increasing effort to mold the

University into an Ivv-League
clone. While Shoven has denied
having a "Harvardization" men
tality, his statements seem to illus
trate the opposite opinion.
Stanford has many unique
aspects that set it apart from other
schools. It is a point of pride that
the University is not a West Coast
version of Harvard.
In an attempt to deflect further
criticism, Shoven has said that the
institute is the only special pro
gram being considered for restruc
turing. But that does not answer
the question â€” that if the institute
is considered unworthy of a
"great" university, then which pro
grams will be next? Furthermore,
who is to be the subjective voice
which will decide which programs
are cut?
Shoven's statements are inap
propriate and unbecoming. Stan
ford is great, and the University
does not need validation from sub
jective viewpoints to prove it.
