ON THE SURFACE, the Stu
dent Group Partnership
appears to be an innocent
and magnanimous program which
provides a convenient means for
student organizations to raise
funds. The partnership — one of
three ways for students to get
alumni funding — allows members
of student organizations to earn
money for their respective causes
by performing administrative
duties for the Stanford Fund.
However, the manner in which
the Stanford Fund tries to help
student groups can be interpreted
as a form of forced labor. Students
must agree to work in such capaci
ties as writing thank-you notes to
recent donors, conducting surveys
and updating alumni on current
campus events.
In other words if students want
funding from alumni, they must sell
themselves to the Stanford Fund.
Jonathan Berent, the coordina

tor of the program, argued that it is
important for students to show
alumni that their donations make a
difference to students. "There is no
soliciting involved," he said. "We are
demonstrating that student groups
really need alumni support."
If the point is to show alumni
that their contributions make a dif
ference, what better way is there to
let them know then by allowing
students themselves to approach
alumni as representatives of vari
ous organizations? Though this
option is available, it is greatly
restricted by the Office of Develop
ment.
The Stanford Fund and the Stu
dent Group Partnership may allow
the University to make more
money, and admittedly may even
allow the groups themselves to
make more money too. Unfortu
nately, for student groups it will be
money won through an unfairly
forced and demeaning process.
