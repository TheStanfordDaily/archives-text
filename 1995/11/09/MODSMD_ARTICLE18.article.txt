## Hootie and the suckfish 
### 
I SAW THE best minds of my genera
tion destroyed by monotony, staid
suited semi-satisfied,
Scared lost souls burning for the North
Beach Dharma of hardwood floors and
black stereo components,
Who scurried frightened and hungry
through cult-like "informational ses
sions" at Tresidder and clandestine
cabals at Gordon Biersch,
Dragging themselves through the CPPC
at dawn screamin' for angry analyst jobs,
scrawling down addresses and phone
numbers,
Cowering in dark, humid confessionals
and ranting incoherently about previous
professional experience and relevant
internships and exercise-oriented hob
bies,
Who cut up and bleeding, crawled hyster
ical through adrenaline-rushed second
round interviews and wild-eyed midnight
flights to New York,
Converging like rabid hyenas on Nordy's
and Macy's for monomaniacal money
spending sprees on creased slacks and sin
gle-breasted jackets and starched collars,

Ironing and ironing their old semi-formal
ties into stiff cloth bands of understated
paisley, imbuing them with a terrible new
professional significance,
Rushing with wild abandon to debauch
erous two-week orientation orgies of lux
urious hotel bedrooms and $100 dinners
and frenzied project analysis seminars,
Who turned with trembling fingers
pages and pages of credit card fraud and
petrochemical production and market
ing strategy and downsizing methodolo
gy,
Who crazed with corporate Karma, con
sulted and analyzed and processed and
calculated and collated and scripted and
unstapled and re-collated and re-stapled
for hours and days and weeks,
Staying up 'til dawn on glorious caffeine
highs, twitching in spasmodic extasy as
pages and pages of a project analysis
report are slowly laser-printed,
Spontaneously jumping on red-eyes to
Provo to work 70 surreal hours on top
secret "hatchet jobs," sleeping through
$40 airport cab rides and fighting uncon
sciousness during expensive business
lunches,

Who slumped catatonic in front of televi
sion screens after work; flickering
images of befuddled 20-somethings danc
ing in fountains before their dilated
pupils,
Trembling in badly lit bars on Lombard
Street on weekends, raving stark-naked
epithets at football games on large televi
sion monitors,
Drinking themselves into oblivion on
microbrews and Zimastm and fuzzy
navels,
Who seized with a berzerker frenzy, race
like banshees along the marina, sweating
and panting in U. sweatshirts,
Staggering into the office on Monday
morning, strung out bleeding on frappa
cinos, desperately trying to purge the
lurid memories of the weekend's
debauchery from their aching skulls,
Hootie baby hootie.

This week's poetic insight is presented by
our dear friend and Gen-Xpoet laureate,
Mr. Gabe Weisert. Hey, thanks Gabe!
