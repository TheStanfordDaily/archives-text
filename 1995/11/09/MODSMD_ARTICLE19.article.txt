Small's affirmative action column misses point

TONY SMALL, IN his noble
attempt to justify affirmative
action, ends up demonstrating the
great disparity between what the privi
leged and the disadvantaged consider
reality. His outrageous statement that
"there is no 'institutional racism' today"
defies the volumes of current research
which documents contemporary racism
in an institutional framework. He dis
misses out of hand the institutional
argument without fully researching the
claim. Here are some instances that
might be a good start ing point.
A recent audit by Midpeninsula Citi
zens for Fair Housing (MCFH), located in
downtown Palo Alto, found that approxi
mately 65 percent of African-Americans
received differential treatment when seek
ing rental housing in the Midpeninsula,
compared to a white applicant with simi
lar financial assets and history. This dif
ferential treatment consisted of greater

scrutiny of credit, refusal to show avail
able units altogether and greater empha
sis of undesirable qualities in the rental,
among other tactics. MCFH reports that
apartment associations commonly deny
that active enforcement of anti-discrimi
nation laws is needed.
Jury selection for courts in California
draws upon voter registration lists. Reg
istered voters tend to be disproportion
ately affluent, white and elderly. His
panics, in particular, are vastly under
represented in the pool of registered vot
ers in California. Thirty-five percent of
all Hispanics are registered to vote, com
pared to 68 percent of whites and 62
percent of blacks. The entire process of
jury selection is inherently biased
against poor citizens, who tend to be dis
proportionately minorities, since the
average daily payment for jury service is
between $5-10 in California. This mea
ger compensation serves as an economic

disincentive for persons who, on aver
age, must spend 50 percent of their
income on housing alone.
Until the 19405, real estate agents
were specifically trained to separate
white and non-white residents who were
seeking a home and steer them to differ
ent neighborhoods. Although officially
outlawed today, research by the non
partisan Urban Institute in 1988, and by
subsequent individuals, has shown that
steering still occurs with significant fre
quency — in about one out of every
three encounters for African Americans.
In 1986, about 60 percent of cities
used at-large elections, which means that
the general population votes as a whole.
At-large elections serve to enhance the
voting power of whites in white-majority
cities, compared to cities which use an
electoral district system. Even with the
district system, as recently as 1991, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judicial

elections in Louisiana and Texas violated
the 1982 Voting Rights Act because the
large districts effectively ensured that
whites in any given district would out
number minorities.
Finally, a parable for the day. Recent
ly, a taxi company put a sign in front of
its office to the effect of, "Do not pick up
any black males at night. We have had
many robbings by black males lately."
Faced with complaints of racism, the
company simply changed the sign to say,
"Do not pick up any suspicious-looking
persons at night." But we all still know
exactly what is meant by "suspicious
looking persons" and who is mostly like
ly to be affected by this rule.
A quote I heard once, which describes
Small's argument perfectly: "If the play
ing field looks even to you, it's likely
you're sitting in the box seat."
