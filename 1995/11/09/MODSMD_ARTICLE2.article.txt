# Is loan system flawed?
## 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Members of ;
the Department \
of Education \
plan to respond \
soon to charges j
that a new sys- \
tem for calculat- I:
ing loan-default ;
rates is inaccu- l
rate and hastily \
iniDlemented.

several universities, including
Stanford, are arguing that the new
process, the National Student Loan
Data System, has serious design
flaws.
But a senior official at the De
partment of Education has said no
changes will be made in response to
the complaints. Leo Cornfeld, se
nior adviser to the Secretary of Ed
ucation for direct lending, said the
forthcoming response will not
promise change.
The National Student Loan
Data system, implemented this
year, provides a national data bank
of student loan repayment records.
Previously, the data were collected
through guarantee agencies.
Rather than collect data from so
many different sources, the nation
al system aims to consolidate the
process.
Default-rate calculations are an
important component in determin
ing universities' eligibility for loan
and aid programs. Any student who
does not pay back student loans
contributes to the default rate.
Despite the good intentions of
the creators of the system, howev
er, administrators at some univer
sities say the changes will create

more problems than they will
solve.
Aid administrators at Pacific
10 Conference schools detailed
their charges against the new sys
tem in a letter to the Education
Department written in August.
In the letter, Nancy Coolidge
and Jacqueline Ito-Woo, financial
aid administrators at UC-Berke
ley, criticized the Education
Department's handling of the new
system.
"The plan was not designed
well," Coolidge said. "It needs to
be rethought on the basis of new
technology."
Speci fical ly, administrators
said they are concerned about the
accuracy of student information
fed into the data system.
"We are concerned with the

integrity of the information,"
said Stanford Bursar John Erick
son. "First, is that information
correct? Second, if the informa
tion is incorrect, what are the
mechanisms for dealing with
that?"
Aid administrators charge that
when inaccurate data — such as
an incorrect birth date for a stu
dent — is fed to the system, the
database keeps the inaccurate
information and rejects further
attempts to change the data.
The problems likely have
arisen because of a rush on finish
ing the system before all the bugs
could be sorted out, the authors of
the letter said.
"There is a concern if the sys
tem is really ready," Ito-Woo said.
"The Education Department was
under pressure to get it mounted,
so elements of the system are
ready and others are still not
ready."
Government officials, on the

other hand, believe use of the sys
tem can begin any time.
Cornfeld called the charges
"grossly inaccurate."
"This is the first time in the
history of the U.S. government
that we have had a centralized
database [about student loan
default rates]. We've tried to
respond to the need to go faster,"
Cornfeld said.
Cornfeld argued that many of
the problems with the new system
are due to faulty data from the
guarantee agencies themselves,
particularly data from agencies in
California.
In any event, the problems
from the system can be solved,
given proper time, Erickson said.
"The main issue is that the sys
tem doesn't have all the tools in it
yet," Erickson said. "When you
build a database, you have to
anticipate all that will go bump in
the night. A number of issues
haven't been fleshed out vet."
