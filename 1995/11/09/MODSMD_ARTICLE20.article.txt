# LGBCC dismayed at Rice's stance on wheelchair access
## 
### 
Is Provost Condoleezza Rice homo
phobic or just ignorant? Her stance
regarding wheelchair accessibility at
Tuesday night's ASSU Senate meeting
left us wondering if she has ever been to
the lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center (LGBCC) or the Women's
Center, if she has been outside Building
10, and if she gives a damn that several
disabled members of the Stanford queer
community cannot go up the stairs to
the LGBCC unless they are physically
carried up by other community mem
bers.
This situation is unacceptable. At the
meeting, Rice "addressed" the issue of
wheelchair accessibility for all community
centers. Two disabled Stanford students
were present to question the provost as to

what actions she was taking to remedy
the situation. One of the students cited
federal law regarding accessibility in the
university setting. Rice proceeded to dis
miss the student's inquiry on the basis
that federal law concerning this issue
applies only to newly-constructed or reno
vated buildings. Afler Rice was questioned
by several senators, an attempt was made
by David Barba to call attention to the
accessibility needs of the LGBCC, which
were ignored in Rice's previous com
ments.
Senate Chair Alane Murdock silenced
both Barba and a senator who attempt
ed to yield the floor to Barba. Barba
stated that he understood parliamen
tary procedures, but he felt that his
views were not being represented by
those senators "allowed" to speak. Nev
ertheless, he went on to say that Rice
blatantly disregarded the accessibility
needs of the LGBQ (lesbian, Gay, Bi
sexual, Queer) community — specifical

ly, the importance of having a safe space
on campus for all queer students. The
LGBCC is the only place at Stanford
where students who are not out of the
closet, or who are questioning their sex
uality, can gather safely with other
queers.
Rice responded to Barba's comments
by rolling her eyes.
In line with parliamentary procedure,
another senator followed up Barba's
statements with a direct question for
Rice regarding wheelchair accessibility
for the LGBCC. Provost Rice fumbled
around unable to remember the center's
name. Finally, and incorrectly, she called
it the "LBGCC" — twice.
If she doesn't know the name, how
can she know the needs?
She dug herself into a deeper hole by
asking, "It's in the Firehouse, right?"
She then stated that she was under the
assumption that the "LBGCC" is
wheelchair accessible through the

Women's Center. Unbeknownst to her,
there are in fact two flights of stairs at
both entrances to the LGBCC. Perhaps
the provost would know this if she had
ever visited the LGBCC.
We wonder if Rice's words are indica
tive of homophobic sentiments or merely
evidence her ignorance regarding LGBQ
issues at Stanford. While we support
Provost Rice's stated plans to investigate
wheelchair accessibility for the communi
ty centers located in Old Union, we
would also like to remind her that some
community centers exist outside Old
Union and deserve equal attention.
We extend an invitation to Rice to
climb the stairs to the LGBCC, learn its
name and educate herself about the
community it serves.
