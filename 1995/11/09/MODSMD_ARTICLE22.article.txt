# University moving along on campus access woes
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Although there are elevators
in both Meyer and Green
Libraries, senior Bliss Temple
said the facilities still aren't
completely friendly to wheel
chair users.
"I find that I pick my research
topics by what call numbers are
on the accessible stacks," said
Temple, who uses a wheelchair.
"The small space between the
stacks makes it impossible to
access the material."
Last Bpring, this problem was
brought to the attention of the
Disability Resource Center,
which acted quickly.
"There were several prob
lems we needed to deal with,"
said Nancy Deason, director of
the DRC. "Telephones and
Xerox machines were too high to
reach, and the process for get
ting the elevator key to get to
Government Documents was
not clear."
"We came up with a referral
list with contact people available
in each library, so that students
could go to someone in particu
lar," Deason said.
Access problems in Universi
ty facilities have been coming to
a head in the past few months.
"Students were having trou
ble with Dining Services ... like
being unable to see the food if
they were in wheelchairs or get
ting their trays to tables." said
Carla Dunn, the program coor
dinator for the DRC.
"A group of us met with Din
ing Services to look at what
could be done, and they agreed
to provide staffing to give stu
dents their rights," Dunn said.
Dunn said she is pleased with
the outcome of the food service
problem.
"Stanford am be incredibly
responsive," she said. "There is
an effort to make a systematic
change, and an asking of, 'How
are we going to deal with this
problem when it comes up next
time?' "
Right now, the DRC is

addressing the issue of construc
tion projects on campus block
ing access ramps and entrances
to buildings.
"For both the visually
impaired and students in wheel
chairs, the construction is creat
ing a huge problem," Temple said.
Last week, for example, Tem
ple had to take a long detour to
get to the Mathematics Depart
ment.
"Because of the construction,
I had to go up the ramp in the
front of Main Quad, through
Memorial Court, around the
square, across the center of
Main Quad and around past the
Psych building to get almost
back to where I started," Tem
ple said.
"This is more that just an
inconvenience," said graduate
student Donna Davies, a stu
dent active in the DRC.
"It is a safety issue," she said.
"There are more hazards than
ever on this campus."
According to Temple, the
problems have arisen because
contractors are supposed to
notify the DRC when barriers
are going up, and this communi
cation hasn'toccured.
"I don't believe the adminis
tration is malicious; they aren't
making the decisions with I bad
intentions]," Davies said. "Peo
ple have to be held responsible
for raising consciousness. Igno
rance is not a good excuse."
A new Americans with Dis
abilities Act 504 compliance
coordinator, Rosa Gonzalez, was
hired last spring, and Dunn feels
that a lot of hard work is coming
together under Gonzalez's
direction.
Deason agreed, saying, "Dis
ability issues are personally
important to [Gonzalez]. She is
in a position where students can
go to her on compliance viola
tions, and she will focus on the
issue and navigate the student
through the process."
"There have been a lot of
recent changes," Temple said,
"and we are reaching a kind of
happy synergy."
