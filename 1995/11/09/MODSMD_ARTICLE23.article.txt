## Curtain falls on a dreary season for men's soccer 
### Alan Eaton Contributing writer 
San Jose State 1

The Stanford men's soccer
team (5-12-1 overall, 2-4 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
concluded its 1995 season with a
1-0 loss to San Jose State (6-11-1,
3-3) last night in San Jose. For
the Cardinal, the loss capped an
already disappointing season and
limited its win total to five, the
exact number of games in which
Stanford triumphed last year.
The Spartans play the same
style of soccer as Stanford, and
perhaps coincidentally, the two
teams sport similar records. San
Jose eked out the victory, scoring
a goal in the first 20 seconds of

play. Spartan forward Jody Riehl
put the ball in the back of the net
for his first score of the season.
However, the goal resulted
from an unusual and unfortunate
sequence of events. Stanford
freshman goalie Jon Bruck collid
ed with a teammate and fell over.
Bruck's collapse left the goal open
for Riehl, who, after intercepting
a pass between Cardinal defend
ers, knocked a 15-yard shot into
the unprotected goal.
After this quick strike, the
Spartans were able to tighten the
screws defensively until the final
gun sounded. Yesterday's match
was the fourth time this season
that an opposing team shutout
the anemic Stanford offense. The
Cardinal was held scoreless in its
last two outings of the season.
San Jose goalkeeper Keith
Bateman recorded his fourth
shutout of the season and saved
seven balls. Bateman totaled an
impressive 65 saves for the year
and carried a competitive 1.40
goals-against average during the
season.
The Stanford team began the
season with promise, winning
three of its first four matches.
However, that promise was
squashed by a winless streak that
started Sept. 17 and extended
until Oct. 22, when the Cardinal

beat Air Force 1-0. When the
unwelcome streak finally ended,
Stanford was 3-9-1 and looking at
yet another year without a post
season appearance.
The season did provide some
excitement and notable perfor
mances. Sophomore Eric Vande
velde emerged as the Cardinal's
leading scorer with four goals
and three assists. Senior Ryan
Estevez left a lasting impression
with his gutsy play and three
goals of his own. Freshmen Jon
Bruck and A.J. Sauer rose to the
challenge of collegiate soccer,
making timely contributions.

Senior co-captains Carmen
D'Onofrio and Chet Zimmer
brought leadership and consis
tent play to each match. Mean
while, the crop of underclassmen
played well in certain matches
and not so well in others, but the
foundation for the future of the
Stanford men's soccer program
has been laid and is seemingly in
good hands.
The Cardinal laid to rest a frus
trating season last night. Incon
sistent play brought constant
defeat, but the Cardinal may yet
rise next year to post better
results.
