## Curtain falls on a dreary season for men's soccer

The Stanford men's soccer
team (5-12-1 overall, 2-4 Moun

concluded its 1995 season with a
1-0 loss to San Jose State (6-11-1,
3-3) last night in San Jose. For
the Cardinal, the loss capped an

limited its win total to five, the
exact number of games in which
Stanford triumphed last year.

teams sport similar records. San
Jose eked out the victory, scoring
a goal in the first 20 seconds of

play. Spartan forward Jody Riehl
put the ball in the back of the net
for his first score of the season.
However, the goal resulted
from an unusual and unfortunate
sequence of events. Stanford
freshman goalie Jon Bruck collid
ed with a teammate and fell over.
Bruck's collapse left the goal open
for Riehl, who, after intercepting
a pass between Cardinal defend

the unprotected goal.
After this quick strike, the
Spartans were able to tighten the
screws defensively until the final
gun sounded. Yesterday's match
was the fourth time this season
that an opposing team shutout
the anemic Stanford offense. The
Cardinal was held scoreless in its
last two outings of the season.
San Jose goalkeeper Keith
Bateman recorded his fourth
shutout of the season and saved
