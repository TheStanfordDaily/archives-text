### Aid a Leu Staff writer 
For the first time in four years,
Stanford field hockey (8-6 overall,
5-2 Northern Pacific Conference)
will compete in the NCAA tourna
ment, facing off against Penn
State (14-8 overall, 6-4 Big Ten)
in Happy Valley, Pa. tonight at
7:30 p.m. EST.
The Cardinal women traveled
to Pennsylvania Tuesday morn
ing for a bit of extra practice on
the Astroturf and to acclimate to
the chilly New England weather.
The 12-team tournament
begins today, followed by second -
round contests on Nov. 12. Stan
ford will meet defending NCAA
champion James Madison if the
Cardinal passes its test against
the Nittany Lions. The final four
and championship game will take
place at Wake Forest.
Head coach Sheryl Johnson
told her players on Monday that
Penn State is the best possible
opponent that the Cardinal could
have drawn because Penn State,
although a great team, has been
plagued by inconsistency all year.
She also pointed out that the Nit
tany Lions have lost more games
than Stanford has.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal can
not count on another team's
inconsistencies to pull it through.

Stanford had one of its best prac
tices all year on Monday and
hopes to ride the momentum of its
Western Collegiate Tournament
win throughout the playoffs.
For the Cardinal, the 1995
playoffs may be the last chance it
has to prove itself in the NCAA
tournament. Beginning next
year, the NorPac Conference will
no longer receive a guaranteed
bid to nationals. The NorPac
leader will have to compete with
the Midwestern Conference
champion for a tournament
berth.
Teams out of the Midwest and
East Coast generally field much
stronger teams due to more
extensive regular-season competi
tion. Stanford currently faces
only two challengers in the Nor-
Pac â€” California and Pacific.
"Most of the time, the East
Coast teams think they can blow
right by us, but our team is really
fired up," said senior tri-captain
Jennifer Glueck. "We've worked
hard all season and we are going
to play the game of our lives."
Although competing with the
Midwest for a playoff berth
means that West Coast teams
might not advance for a few years,
Glueck did not view the consolida
tion as a setback.
