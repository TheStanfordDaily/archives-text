# Women's hoops sporting new look
## Without VanDerveer, Cardinal sets its sights on the same lofty goals 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
The head coach is on a leave
of absence. Three starters were
lost to graduation, among them
two Honorable Mention Ail-
Americans. And one of the top
freshmen in the nation last sea
son may not return for her
sophomore campaign. What
does all this mean for the 1995-
96 Stanford women's basketball
team?
It still quite possibly means a
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship and a ninth consecutive
trip to the NCAA Tournament.
Unreasonable, you say? It's
not unreasonable at Stanford,
where women's basketball has
attained a level of excellence
unrivaled in the Pac-10.
The women have qualified for
postseason play eight straight
years, captured six of the last
seven Pac-10 titles and appeared
in the Final Four in four of the
past six seasons, capturing the
NCAA crown in 1990 and 1992.
Last year, under the tutelage of
head coach Tara VanDerveer,
the Cardinal finished 30-3 (17-1
Pac-10) and once again reached
the Final Four, where it bowed
out to eventual champion Con
necticut.
But this is a new season, and
for the first time in 11 years,
VanDerveer will not be guiding
the women hoopsters. Van-
Derveer assumed full-time head
coaching duties for the 1995
U.S. National Team and the
1996 U.S. Olympic Team on Oct.
1. Her vacancy will be filled by
interim head coach Amy Tucker,
a long-time assistant of Van-
Derveer's, and co-interim head
coach Marianne Stanley, for
merly of Old Dominion, Penn
sylvania and USC.
"I feel very comfortable with

the situation, having Marianne
Stanley as a co-head coach,'
Tucker said. "She provides a
wealth of experience and will

provide us with a whole new set
of ideas. There is no doubt that
things will be different. But
being different does not have to

be bad. In fact, change can some
times be very good."

Junior Jamila Wideman will take over as the floor general after the graduation of Kate Paye.
That change begins in the
frontcourt, where the Cardinal
lost the services of four-year
starter Rachel Hemmer, a 6-foot
-3 forward, and 6-foot-5 center
Anita Kaplan, a First-Team All-
Pac-10 selection. Shooting guard
Kate Paye, Stanford's fifth all
time assist leader, has also
departed.
"As a team, we have the poten
tial to be very good," Tucker said.
"In Kaplan, Hemmer and Paye,
we lost a tremendous amount of
scoring, rebounding and leader
ship. I'm not sure we are going to
replace Kate Paye's determina
tion and grit on defense. Someone
is going to have to step up and fill
that role."
One player the Cardinal will
welcome back is 6-foot-2 junior
guard / forward Kate Starbird, a
preseason Naismith Award and
All-America candidate. As a
sophomore last season, Starbird
started 32 games while leading
the team in scoring with a 16.0
points-per-game average, good
enough to earn her First-Team
All-Pac-10 honors.
"Kate Starbird was not only
our leading scorer last year, but
she was also our flashiest player,"
Tucker said. "I have a lot of confi
dence in her, especially in the
transition game. She can play
either the '2' [position] or the
'3.' "
A trio of talented sophomores
will solidify the remainder of the
frontcourt. Topping the list is 6-
foot-3 forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele, a Pac-10 All-Freshman
Team selection who averaged 7.3
points and 3.0 rebounds coming
off the bench last season. Mean
while, 6-foot-2 sophomore
Heather Owen (5.5 points per
game, 3.2 rebounds) will see time

at both the forward and center
positions. Finally, there's
Olympia Scott, a 6-foot-2 rebound
specialist (6.1, 4.6) who started
the first 19 games of last year
before suffering a stress fracture
in her right leg.
"[Scoot is) our best rebounder,
most athletic player and perhaps
our best defender," Tucker said.
Junior point guard Jamila
Wideman, a returning starter
who averaged 3.7 points and 3.5
assists last season, will provide
leadership in a backcourt lacking
experience and depth. The only
other point guard who played
extensively last year is 5-foot-10
junior Charinin Smith, who looks
to provide more of an offensive
threat this season after averaging
just 1.7 points as a sophomore.
Meanwhile, 5-foot-ll guard / for
ward Bobbie Kelsey, the team's
only fifth-year senior, must con
tribute at both the forward and
off-guard positions. Sophomore
Regan Freuen and senior walk-on
Amy Wustefeld add depth off the
bench.
Others who will receive playing
time this season include 6-foot-0
junior Tara Harrington, the
team's most versatile player, and
sophomore forward Vanessa
Nygaard, a hot-handed three
point shooter and one of the Car
dinal's most rugged cagers. Tuck
er also expects significant contri
bution from 6-foot-7 redshirt
freshman Chandra Benton, the
only true center on the team. An
intimidating force with good
offensive moves, Benton will pro
vide the Cardinal with a tremen
dous height advantage in the mid
dle.
With such a wealth of talent to
draw from, the women may not
even miss the possible departure
of sophomore phenom Kristin
Folkl. The 6-foot-2 Folkl garnered
National Freshman of the Year
and All-American honors while
leading women's volleyball to the

NCAA title last season. She then
joined the basketball team in mid
season and earned First-Team
Pac-10 All-Freshman honors
while averaging 9.5 points and 5.5
rebounds a game. Unfortunately
for the Cardinal, Folk! may opt to
join the U.S. National Volleyball
Team in January and forego the
basketball season. Folkl will not
finalize her decision until Decem
ber.
The women will get a chance to
see what they're made of tomor
row at Maples Pavilion when the
Cardinal meets VanDerveer's
U.S. National Team in a presea
son exhibition. The regular sea
son begins Nov. 24 and 26 with
road games at Massachusetts and
Providence College, with the
home-opener slated for Dec. 1
versus Old Dominion. In addition
to its usual Pac-10 schedule, the
Cardinal will host Santa Clara,
Tennessee and the Fry's/Cardi
nal Classic (featuring Auburn,
Eastern Washington and Sacra
mento State) and travel to Texas
Tech and Texas.
With limited experience and a
grueling schedule, it's unlikely
that Stanford can dominate its
opponents as thoroughly as it did
last year, when the Cardinal won
its games by an average margin of
23.7 points. But there is no doubt
that Tucker's squad has the fire
power to once again compete at
the upper echelon of NCAA
women's basketball.
"Overall, we're looking for a
great year," Tucker said. "With or
without Tara VanDerveer, our
goals will be as high as they usu
ally are — to win a Pac-10 title
and to go as deep into the NCAA
tournament as we possibly can.
It's a year of change, but we're
looking forward to keeping the
program in solid shape for Tara's
return."
At Stanford, "solid shape" usu
ally translates into a Final-Four
appearance — at least.

"Overall, we're looking for a
great year," Tucker said. "With or
without Tara VanDerveer, our
goals will be as high as they usu
ally are — to win a Pac-10 title
and to go as deep into the NCAA
tournament as we possibly can.
It's a year of change, but we're
looking forward to keeping the
program in solid shape for Tara's
return."
At Stanford, "solid shape" usu
ally translates into a Final-Four
appearance — at least.
The head coach is on a leave
of absence. Three starters were
lost to graduation, among them
two Honorable Mention Ail-
Americans. And one of the top
freshmen in the nation last sea
son may not return for her
sophomore campaign. What
does all this mean for the 1995-
96 Stanford women's basketball
team?
It still quite possibly means a
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship and a ninth consecutive
trip to the NCAA Tournament.
Unreasonable, you say? It's
not unreasonable at Stanford,
where women's basketball has
attained a level of excellence
unrivaled in the Pac-10.
The women have qualified for
postseason play eight straight
years, captured six of the last
seven Pac-10 titles and appeared
in the Final Four in four of the
past six seasons, capturing the
NCAA crown in 1990 and 1992.
Last year, under the tutelage of
head coach Tara VanDerveer,
the Cardinal finished 30-3 (17-1
Pac-10) and once again reached
the Final Four, where it bowed
out to eventual champion Con
necticut.
But this is a new season, and
for the first time in 11 years,
VanDerveer will not be guiding
the women hoopsters. Van-
Derveer assumed full-time head
coaching duties for the 1995
U.S. National Team and the
1996 U.S. Olympic Team on Oct.
1. Her vacancy will be filled by
interim head coach Amy Tucker,
a long-time assistant of Van-
Derveer's, and co-interim head
coach Marianne Stanley, for
merly of Old Dominion, Penn
sylvania and USC.
"I feel very comfortable with

the situation, having Marianne
Stanley as a co-head coach,'
Tucker said. "She provides a
wealth of experience and will

provide us with a whole new set
of ideas. There is no doubt that
things will be different. But
being different does not have to

be bad. In fact, change can some
times be very good."

Junior Jamila Wideman will take over as the floor general after the graduation of Kate Paye.
That change begins in the
frontcourt, where the Cardinal
lost the services of four-year
starter Rachel Hemmer, a 6-foot
-3 forward, and 6-foot-5 center
Anita Kaplan, a First-Team All-
Pac-10 selection. Shooting guard
Kate Paye, Stanford's fifth all
time assist leader, has also
departed.
"As a team, we have the poten
tial to be very good," Tucker said.
"In Kaplan, Hemmer and Paye,
we lost a tremendous amount of
scoring, rebounding and leader
ship. I'm not sure we are going to
replace Kate Paye's determina
tion and grit on defense. Someone
is going to have to step up and fill
that role."
One player the Cardinal will
welcome back is 6-foot-2 junior
guard / forward Kate Starbird, a
preseason Naismith Award and
All-America candidate. As a
sophomore last season, Starbird
started 32 games while leading
the team in scoring with a 16.0
points-per-game average, good
enough to earn her First-Team
All-Pac-10 honors.
"Kate Starbird was not only
our leading scorer last year, but
she was also our flashiest player,"
Tucker said. "I have a lot of confi
dence in her, especially in the
transition game. She can play
either the '2' [position] or the
'3.' "
A trio of talented sophomores
will solidify the remainder of the
frontcourt. Topping the list is 6-
foot-3 forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele, a Pac-10 All-Freshman
Team selection who averaged 7.3
points and 3.0 rebounds coming
off the bench last season. Mean
while, 6-foot-2 sophomore
Heather Owen (5.5 points per
game, 3.2 rebounds) will see time

at both the forward and center
positions. Finally, there's
Olympia Scott, a 6-foot-2 rebound
specialist (6.1, 4.6) who started
the first 19 games of last year
before suffering a stress fracture
in her right leg.
"[Scoot is) our best rebounder,
most athletic player and perhaps
our best defender," Tucker said.
Junior point guard Jamila
Wideman, a returning starter
who averaged 3.7 points and 3.5
assists last season, will provide
leadership in a backcourt lacking
experience and depth. The only
other point guard who played
extensively last year is 5-foot-10
junior Charinin Smith, who looks
to provide more of an offensive
threat this season after averaging
just 1.7 points as a sophomore.
Meanwhile, 5-foot-ll guard / for
ward Bobbie Kelsey, the team's
only fifth-year senior, must con
tribute at both the forward and
off-guard positions. Sophomore
Regan Freuen and senior walk-on
Amy Wustefeld add depth off the
bench.
Others who will receive playing
time this season include 6-foot-0
junior Tara Harrington, the
team's most versatile player, and
sophomore forward Vanessa
Nygaard, a hot-handed three
point shooter and one of the Car
dinal's most rugged cagers. Tuck
er also expects significant contri
bution from 6-foot-7 redshirt
freshman Chandra Benton, the
only true center on the team. An
intimidating force with good
offensive moves, Benton will pro
vide the Cardinal with a tremen
dous height advantage in the mid
dle.
With such a wealth of talent to
draw from, the women may not
even miss the possible departure
of sophomore phenom Kristin
Folkl. The 6-foot-2 Folkl garnered
National Freshman of the Year
and All-American honors while
leading women's volleyball to the

NCAA title last season. She then
joined the basketball team in mid
season and earned First-Team
Pac-10 All-Freshman honors
while averaging 9.5 points and 5.5
rebounds a game. Unfortunately
for the Cardinal, Folk! may opt to
join the U.S. National Volleyball
Team in January and forego the
basketball season. Folkl will not
finalize her decision until Decem
ber.
The women will get a chance to
see what they're made of tomor
row at Maples Pavilion when the
Cardinal meets VanDerveer's
U.S. National Team in a presea
son exhibition. The regular sea
son begins Nov. 24 and 26 with
road games at Massachusetts and
Providence College, with the
home-opener slated for Dec. 1
versus Old Dominion. In addition
to its usual Pac-10 schedule, the
Cardinal will host Santa Clara,
Tennessee and the Fry's/Cardi
nal Classic (featuring Auburn,
Eastern Washington and Sacra
mento State) and travel to Texas
Tech and Texas.
With limited experience and a
grueling schedule, it's unlikely
that Stanford can dominate its
opponents as thoroughly as it did
last year, when the Cardinal won
its games by an average margin of
23.7 points. But there is no doubt
that Tucker's squad has the fire
power to once again compete at
the upper echelon of NCAA
women's basketball.
"Overall, we're looking for a
great year," Tucker said. "With or
without Tara VanDerveer, our
goals will be as high as they usu
ally are — to win a Pac-10 title
