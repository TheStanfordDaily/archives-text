# Women's hoops sporting new look
## Without VanDerveer, Cardinal sets its sights on the same lofty goals 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
The head coach is on a leave
of absence. Three starters were
lost to graduation, among them
two Honorable Mention Ail-
Americans. And one of the top
freshmen in the nation last sea
son may not return for her
sophomore campaign. What
does all this mean for the 1995-
96 Stanford women's basketball
team?
It still quite possibly means a
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship and a ninth consecutive
trip to the NCAA Tournament.
Unreasonable, you say? It's
not unreasonable at Stanford,
where women's basketball has
attained a level of excellence
unrivaled in the Pac-10.
The women have qualified for
postseason play eight straight
years, captured six of the last
seven Pac-10 titles and appeared
in the Final Four in four of the
past six seasons, capturing the
NCAA crown in 1990 and 1992.
Last year, under the tutelage of
head coach Tara VanDerveer,
the Cardinal finished 30-3 (17-1
Pac-10) and once again reached
the Final Four, where it bowed
out to eventual champion Con
necticut.
But this is a new season, and
for the first time in 11 years,
VanDerveer will not be guiding
the women hoopsters. Van-
Derveer assumed full-time head
coaching duties for the 1995
U.S. National Team and the
1996 U.S. Olympic Team on Oct.
1. Her vacancy will be filled by
interim head coach Amy Tucker,
a long-time assistant of Van-
Derveer's, and co-interim head
coach Marianne Stanley, for
merly of Old Dominion, Penn
sylvania and USC.
"I feel very comfortable with

the situation, having Marianne
Stanley as a co-head coach,'
Tucker said. "She provides a
wealth of experience and will

provide us with a whole new set
of ideas. There is no doubt that
things will be different. But
being different does not have to

be bad. In fact, change can some
times be very good."
