# Cardinal crew heads north to Seattle
## Stanford to challenge tough Husky, Cougar rowing programs

Stanford crew will battle the cold weather
and stiff competition of the Northwest this
weekend. The women's and men's teams will
both compete in the Head of the Lake on Sun
day morning in Seattle, Wash. Other partici
pating schools include Washington, Washing
ton State and Oregon State, which will pose
serious challenges to the Cardinal.
The course, approximately three miles long,
includes a 180-degree turn in the middle (most
courses are straight). Maneuvering this turn
successfully requires skill on the part of both
rowers and coxswain. The race also lasts longer
than most. The Cardinal must keep these two
details in mind as it prepares for the race.
The women's team will send two eight
rower boats to Washington, the first time the
entire group of 1(3 rowers and two coxswains

will travel together.
"They will face off against the best of the
West Coast and two of the best teams in the
country," said head coach Aimee Baker. The
two teams Baker refers to are Washington,
second in the nation last year and strong again
in 1995, and Washington State, which recent
ly beat nationally-ranked Princeton. The Car
dinal has yet to face either the Huskies or the
Cougars t his year.
Although the women hope to win, they will
focus on their own performance. Finishing
within 30 seconds of a boat as strong as Wash
ington's would constitute a success in and of
itself. Last year, the Cardinal finished a
minute behind the Huskies. As for Washing
ton State, although it should prove a difficult
feat, Stanford looks to defeat the Cougars.
The Cardinal will use Sunday's race to
build its skill and experience in preparation
for the spring season. "We're pulling together,

and it's another step," Baker said. Although
Stanford has rowed for only two months, sig
nificantly less than semester schools, the
women plan to draw upon whatever experi
ence they have gained so far.
"It seems we feel more comfortable on the
water now after these two months. Hopefully
we'll give |the other schools] some good com
petition," said senior rower Julie Lewczyk.
Three outstanding freshman recruits,
Emily Johnson, Katie Sears and Jana Watson,
will row varsity for the first time.
"I think it'll be really exciting because it'll
be a different level of competition," Sears said.
The men's team will also use the regatta to
provide its members with rowing experience.
It will send one four-rower boat and one eight
rower boat to Washington, mainly comprised
of JV rowers. The race will give the JV rowers
