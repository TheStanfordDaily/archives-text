# Sailors to shake off distractions
## Strong Cardinal finish can freeze rivals out of spring regattas 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
If this Sunday's North / South
Intersectional unfolds in historic
fashion, the Stanford sailing
team better beware. Sailors who
competed last year might know
what to expect. Newcomers, on
the other hand, will be in for
quite a surprise.

Hosted by UC-Santa Barabra,
North / South is a major regatta
for the Cardinal. The Cardinal's
finish will determine its spring
schedule. A strong performance
would grant Stanford the ability to
choose which regattas to attend.
With this kind of freedom, Stan
ford could knock out rival schools
such as California and UC-Irvine,
both major contenders for such

first-pick privileges, because East
Coast events offer limited spots to
West Coast schools.
"I am not looking forward to
this regatta at all," said Cardinal
head coach Steve Bourdow. "So
much rides on how well each
team does, yet the regatta is
characterized by foolishness and
seems more like a joke and not
an important intersectional."
Indeed, Bourdow questions
the logic behind how the regatta
is organized and run. For exam
ple, in addition to the schools
racing, alumni of the district
also are invited to compete.
"You would think that hav
ing the alumni sail would chal
lenge and push the college
sailors, but as it is, they have no
respect for rules or student
sailors," Bourdow said. "They'll
do anything they feel like doing
whether it's legal or not. And if
they break a rule, they won't
care about the penalties. It's the
most frustrating thing."
Bourdow also questions the
location of the regatta and the
fact that the teams camp out
overnight at the site.
Held at Lake Cachuma,
north of Santa Barbara, condi
tions have the potential to be as
sketchy as they come. And after
a Saturday night spent camping
out in miserable weather, many
sailors are wiped out once Sun
day morning rolls around.

The Stanford sailing team needs a strong finish in the
North/South regatta this weekend at UCSB.
"Sunday can be pretty much
pointless," Bourdow said. "Either
everyone is enraged because of
the reckless and inconsiderate
behavior of the alumni, or every
one is wiped out from staying up
late and not getting any sleep."
According to Bourdow, a number
of alumni have been known to
make the night hell for student
sailors, doing anything from

stealing equipment to tampering
with boats.
To avoid such mayhem, Stan
ford sailors will spend the night in
Santa Barbara. "This doesn't
mean we won't hang out on Sat
urday night, because we will,"
Bourdow said. "It just means we
can leave when things start get
ting nasty. That way, I am sure
my team will sail up to their
potential on Sunday."
Sophomores John Meade and
Heather Rogers will sail in Divi
sion A, senior Adam Lowry and
sophomore Mara Holian in Divi

sion B, junior Alice Mannard in
Division C and freshman Tyler
Doyle in Division D. Four sailors
will also compete in the JV divi
sion of the regatta. Freshmen
Steve Kleha, Adrienne Stolz, Tay
lor Robinson and Jessica Knape
will sail against the alumni, who
are only allowed to sail in JV.
"This is a good chance for our
freshmen to sail against tough
competition," Bourdow said.
"The alumni are usually very
good. I just hope all four can deal
with what can potentially be a
purely frustrating regatta."
