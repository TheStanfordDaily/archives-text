# Sailors to shake off distractions
## Strong Cardinal finish can freeze rivals out of spring regattas 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
If this Sunday's North / South
Intersectional unfolds in historic
fashion, the Stanford sailing
team better beware. Sailors who
competed last year might know
what to expect. Newcomers, on
the other hand, will be in for
quite a surprise.

Hosted by UC-Santa Barabra,
North / South is a major regatta
for the Cardinal. The Cardinal's
finish will determine its spring
schedule. A strong performance
would grant Stanford the ability to
choose which regattas to attend.
With this kind of freedom, Stan
ford could knock out rival schools
such as California and UC-Irvine,
both major contenders for such

first-pick privileges, because East
Coast events offer limited spots to
West Coast schools.
"I am not looking forward to
this regatta at all," said Cardinal
head coach Steve Bourdow. "So
much rides on how well each
team does, yet the regatta is
characterized by foolishness and
seems more like a joke and not
an important intersectional."
Indeed, Bourdow questions
the logic behind how the regatta
is organized and run. For exam
ple, in addition to the schools
racing, alumni of the district
also are invited to compete.
"You would think that hav
ing the alumni sail would chal
lenge and push the college
sailors, but as it is, they have no
respect for rules or student
sailors," Bourdow said. "They'll
do anything they feel like doing
whether it's legal or not. And if
they break a rule, they won't
care about the penalties. It's the
most frustrating thing."
Bourdow also questions the
location of the regatta and the
fact that the teams camp out
overnight at the site.
Held at Lake Cachuma,
north of Santa Barbara, condi
tions have the potential to be as
sketchy as they come. And after
a Saturday night spent camping
out in miserable weather, many
sailors are wiped out once Sun
day morning rolls around.
