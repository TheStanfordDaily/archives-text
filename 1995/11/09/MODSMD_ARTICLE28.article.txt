### Robin Davidson 
The Rolex Regional Champi
onships are set to get underway
tomorrow with top-caliber teams
from Northern California, Wash
ington and Oregon competing for
the opportunity to advance to the
Rolex Indoor Championships in
February. The tournament will
take place at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium, finishing on Monday.
Out of the draw of 64, Stanford
has the top two seeds of the tour
nament in junior Sandra DeSilva
and senior Kim Shasby, as well as
six other singles slots for sopho
mores Julie Scott and Heidi Stalla,
junior Emily Burt and seniors
Beth Berris, Amy Chiminello and
Wendy Sacks.
Stanford will field four teams
in doubles competition. Stand
outs Ania Bleszynski and Katie
Schlukebir will not participate,
however. Their performance in
the Indoor Tennis Association
Ail-American Championships last
month in Los Angeles earned
them an automatic bid to the
tournament in Texas.
The Rolex regional event is a
four-day tourney that will allow
the Cardinal to see first-hand
what level of competition it may
face later on in the year. According
to DeSilva, California will provide
the most formidable challenge.
"It's a good tournament with
strong competition," Shasby said.
"There are a lot of new freshmen,
and it will be interesting to see

tant on a lot of levels," said assis
tant coach Lele Forood. "It gives
us an idea about our own team
not only how they do against oth
ers, hut how they stack up against
each other as well."
DeSilva feels that playing in
the Ail-American tournament
two weeks ago prepared her well
for this weekend. "I'm kind of in

that competition mode,' she said.
"It's hard to come into a tourna
ment during the offseason, but
I've played lots of matches 1 this
fall]."
Shasby hopes that the event
will get everyone back into com
petition mode. "It is a well-run
tournament and it's fun to play
in," she said. "It's a good start to
the season."
