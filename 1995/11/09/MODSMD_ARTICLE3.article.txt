# 'This is the end of Israeli innocence'
## Pivotal peace 
### Joe El Rady 
"These last three days were
probably one of the hardest
times that Israel has ever faced,"
said Consul Reda Mansour of the
Israeli Consulate General in San
Francisco, during a presentation
last night in the School of Educa
tion on the assassination of Is
raeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
The event, which featured
Mansour speaking about the
Arab-Israeli peace process, had
been planned for some time but
was refocused to discuss the ef
fects of the assassination on the
peace process.
The presentation was part of
the "Food for Thought" series, a
biweekly dinner and discussion
addressing issues of interest to
Jewish students. "Food for
Thought" was created by Mered
ith Goldsmith, a graduate stu
dent in operations research, with
help from the Hillei Foundation.

Mansour said the assassina
tion will prove to be a pivotal
event in Israeli history.
"I tried to look for something
that gets close to that in our his
tory, and maybe it's one of the
major wars, like Yom Kippur or
the Six-Day War, maybe — I'm
not sure those are close," he said.
"Rabin was assassinated after
he led this amazing historical
campaign that we call the peace
process," Mansour said. "People
knew this process, if it advanced,
would change the entire face of
Israel, and maybe the face of the
entire Middle East."
He likened the situation in Is
rael to that in America after the
political assassinations of the
19605.
"In a way, Israel will go
through a process which Ameri
ca went through after the assas
sination of President Kennedy,"
Mansour said. "Everybody now

feels that this is the end of Israeli
innocence."
Mansour blamed propaganda
drummed up by right-wing Cringe
groups for "preparing the atmo
sphere for something like this or
similar to this to happen."
"The last extreme (image) that
everybody is mentioning now is
the one that was shown in
Jerusalem in the right-wing
demonstrations a few weeks ago,
where [Rabin] was shown in a SS
Nazi uniform," Mansour said. "If
you know about the Jewish histo
ry, about the Holocaust, you know
that this is not just a sophisticated

political way of saying what you
think. It's like asking people to
commit this kind of act."
However, Mansour empha
sized that mainstream right-wing
groups such as the Likud party
did not support the assassination.
"You definitely cannot say this
of the Likud," he said. "The
Likud is a very responsible
party. . . . This is a party that was
in power for many years and
brought the peace process with
Egypt."
As for the effects that the
assassination will have upon the
peace process, Mansour said,
"this debate is going to be contin
ued because it i.- a major issue for
Israel today. Both sides feel that
we are doing things that are irre
versible, that's why they feel so

strongly about the whole situa
tion."
He warned that the process is
still not proceeding smoothly
even after positive developments
such as the handshakes in Wash
ington and the awarding of the
Nobel Prize to the peacemakers,
because the issue is still very divi
sive in Israel.
Mansour ended by reiterating
the need to learn from this inci
dent.
"I hope we will learn much
from this assassination," he said,
"| that) we will have some time for
reflection to know that peace is
the only real option, instead of
going through more wars and
waking up years from now saying
that we could have prevented
t hem."
