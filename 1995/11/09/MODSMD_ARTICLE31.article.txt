# Stanford Jeopardy
## Teams gear up for IM College Bowl tournament this weekend 
### Amanda Garcia 
Quick wits with quick hands will vie for the
intramural championship when Stanford's College
Bowl Club sponsors its annual campus tourna
ment this Saturday and Sunday. The final rounds
of the tournament will be held the following week
end.
The club has publicized the event through the
activities fair and e-mail to various mailing lists and
newsgroups. Club president Mark Ruzon said mod
erators at the tournament will note any exceptional
"College Bowl talent" among the student-formed
teams.
"We recruit as a matter of survival," said Ruzon.
"The year before I came, the club had dwindled
down to two people. Now we have some veteran
players, but we always need new people."
Approximately 20 teams are currently registered
fur the tournament this weekend. During the first
round, the teams will compete in a round-robin for
mat, answering questions in subjects ranging from
science to popular culture.
In each match, two teams will compete against
each other, racing to be the first to answer the toss
up question, which is open to both teams. Once that
10-point question is correctly answered, a bonus
question is directed to the answering team.

At the end of two eight-minute periods, the team
with the most points wins.
Questions for the tournament originate at Col
lege Bowl Inc., which specializes in writing trivia
questions.
"CBI questions are faster and easier than other
types of questions," noted freshman Brad Harris, a
club member. "They emphasize speed and anticipa
tion over knowledge."
The club now boasts 10 members. Although the
club will not field a team at the tournament, some
individual members have created their own teams.
"We want students to form their own teams and
give it a shot," Harris said.
The College Bowl Club competes at invitational
tournaments, as well as at regional and national
annual tournaments Stanford has won the champi
onship in its region, which includes teams from Cal
ifornia, Nevada and Hawaii, for five out of the past
six years. In an invitational meet at UC-Berkeley
last weekend, the Stanford teams finished fourth
and sixth.
The deadline for registering for the intramural
tournament has been extended to today. Because it
is the second deadline, teams are not guaranteed a
place in the tournament, in which case their entry
money will be refunded. Anyone interested should
contact Mark Ruzon at ruzon(«cs.stanford.edu.
