## Kristie Lü Stout The 						Woody Allen Drinking Game® 
### 
OBJECT: To turn any Woody-themed screen
ing soiree into a bona fide bacchanalian liver
killer. Great for high-brow types who incorpo
rate the words "polymorphously perverse"
into their vocabulary and savor the occasional
vat of malt liquor 'n port every now and then.
NUMBER OF PERSONS: Two or more. Re
member kiddos, drinking alone is a warning
sign of alcoholism (77te Balance Beam, A stu
dent health newsletter, Vol. 3, No. 2).
MATERIALS: Any Woody Allen movie (no
matter what the dominant paradigm tells you,
"Interiors," "Shadows and Fog" and "Septem
ber" are not Allen flicks), an ambidextrous
bartender, plenty o' booze, plenty o' goblets,
plenty o' pink plastic swizzle sticks and just a
dash of thanatos.

nondescript pea green wool sweater with
