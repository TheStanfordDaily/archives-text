# Seven minutes with Harry Connick Jr. Jazzy dreamboat crooner lets music do the talking
## 
### Colleen Krueger 
/jjjarry Connick |r. yawned for about
rll 25 seconds of our seven-minute
1L interview Monday morning.
I can't say that I blame him.
It's just that at minute four of a seven
minute interview, a 25-second yawn can be a
definitive moment by default.
Seven minutes isn't much time to get to
know anyone, but it's really not much time
with singer / pianist ('.onnick, who was as re
served and stoic in conversation as he is ani
mated and loquacious in concert. Not that he
was unfriendly at all. He was polite, apolo
gizing for the yawn and everything, and he
even called me a "cool kid at one point,
which really means something coming from
a jazz type.
Connick was just reticent, which must
have been helpful when he was questioned in
1993 for trying to pack a gun onto an air
plane, but wasn't quite such a boon Monday
morning.
The funny thing is, there's a lot to say
about Connick right now.
He
Connick made a splash crooning roman
tic favorites like "It Had To Be You" and
"Don't Cet Around Much Anymore" on
1989's "When Harry Met Sally" soundtrack,
his punchy big band standards appealing
both to jazz connoisseurs and lay folks. I lis
dreamboat good looks didn't hurt him any
either; critics never seemed to tire of calling
Connick "a young Frank Sinatra." He slid
original numbers onto his next two albums,
"We Are in Love" (which won him a 1991
grammy for Best la// Vocal Performance)
and "Blue l ight, Red I ight," both highly suc
cessful recordings in the same well-received
swing mode.
Connick settled into a niche. As a
spokesmodel for pop-jazz, the less-than-in
novative (kmnick was celebrated for success
fully peddling jazz to a mass market which
eluded most artists throughout the '70s and
'80s. He was seen as sort of a pre-fab Mel
Torme or Guy Lombardo, allowed to pro
duce big band albums and even the occasion
al side project in peace, so long as he gave the
people what they wanted.
Problem was, Harry wanted more.
Last year, he released "She" — a New Or
leans-style pop-jazz album laced with funk
and rock that, with its electric guitars and
hushed ballads, will at least ensure that Con
nick and the rest of the world get a break
from Sinatra comparisons. But, in rocking
his way through numbers like "Joe Slam and
the Spaceship," Connick has rocked right out
of the hearts of many fans and critics longing
for the old 1 larry.
"A lot of people probably hate the new
sound, but that's cool," Connick said, in a
particularly garrulous moment around

minute two. "It wasn't really going out on a
limb; I was playing this music before people
knew who I was. I was going to do this re
gardless of whether anybody bought the
album or not."
The negative critical reaction hasn't stung
(Connick, who said he doesn't read reviews: "I
don't care what they're saying."
Connick s current college tour, which vis
its San lose State tonight, is an extension of
last year's funk show, featuring his four-man
Funk Band.
"There aren't seats in the audience any
more, so it's all just stand-up cra/.iness," he
said. "I just love being up there every night,
especially with this music, 'cause there's a lot
less musical responsibility than the stuff we
were doing before."
She
About the same time "She" came out,
Connick married longtime sweetheart
model (ill Cioodacre, best known for her Vic
toria's Secret catalogue work, lust last week,
the couple announced from their home in
New Orleans that they will have their first
child in April.
"Oh man, I'm real ready," Connick said of
his impending fatherhood. "We always want
ed a family. That was something we always
planned."
Growing up as the son of New Orleans
District Attorney Harry Connick, a contro
versial figure who was often in the city news,
Connick knows what it's like to have famous
parents and hopes to protect his child from
publicity.
"We are kind of private people," he said
simply. "We like to keep our privacy.'
So far, marriage hasn't meant sacrificing
work. "I'm not on the road that much, and a
lot of the time lill comes with me," he said, in
a statement long enough to connect minute
three to minute four. "I'm 28, I need to he
working. When I'm 38, I'll slow down a little."
Along with a new musical style, a new wife
and a baby on the way, Connick is also enjoy
ing a burgeoning film career. Although he
has acted in "Memphis Belle," "Little Man
Tate" and even an episode of "Cheers," the
new release "Copycat", with Holly Hunter
and Sigourney Weaver, has brought him a
new kind of attention.
"It's just a whole different level of fame,"
he said. "A lot more people see movies than
buy records."
Filming "Copycat" with Weaver, Connick
said he "just tried to keep his mouth shut and
listen and learn."
Ironically, the yawn followed that last
comment.
Connick finished shooting "Indepen
dence Day" about two weeks ago with Will
Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum,
which he describes as the story of "a big alien

spaceship that takes over the earth." The film
is due out Inlv 4th.
"Movies are iust another way to feed my
ego," Connick said. "I need to perform."
The son of New Orleans music store own
ers, Connick has been performing for most
of his life. He entertained at his father's
swearing-in ceremony when he was six, and
made his recording debut with a local jazz
band before he had turned 10. After studying
and playing piano with James Booker, I His
Marsalis and Dclfeavo Marsalis as a child,
Connick moved to New York at 18 to study
music at Hunter College and the Manhattan
School of Music before cutting his first solo
album at the age of 19.
Minute six.
More films in the future?
"I like doing movies, they're a lot of fun."

Could we maybe get more specific?
"If a script comes along that I like with a
good director, 1 11 grab it, but I'm not like
planning anything, you know."
New album?
"It's not that hard to throw one down
when I feel like it."
Where does he see his style heading?
"I just want to keep getting better."
The enlightening round is over, Harry's
yawning again and my seven minutes are up.

sound, but that's cool," Connick said, in a
particularly garrulous moment around

minute two. "It wasn't really going out on a
limb; I was playing this music before people
knew who I was. I was going to do this re
gardless of whether anybody bought the
album or not."
The negative critical reaction hasn't stung
(Connick, who said he doesn't read reviews: "I
don't care what they're saying."
Connick s current college tour, which vis
its San lose State tonight, is an extension of
last year's funk show, featuring his four-man
Funk Band.
"There aren't seats in the audience any
more, so it's all just stand-up cra/.iness," he
said. "I just love being up there every night,
especially with this music, 'cause there's a lot
less musical responsibility than the stuff we
were doing before."
She
About the same time "She" came out,
Connick married longtime sweetheart
model (ill Cioodacre, best known for her Vic
toria's Secret catalogue work, lust last week,
the couple announced from their home in
New Orleans that they will have their first
child in April.
"Oh man, I'm real ready," Connick said of
his impending fatherhood. "We always want
ed a family. That was something we always
planned."
Growing up as the son of New Orleans
District Attorney Harry Connick, a contro
versial figure who was often in the city news,
Connick knows what it's like to have famous
parents and hopes to protect his child from
publicity.
"We are kind of private people," he said
simply. "We like to keep our privacy.'
So far, marriage hasn't meant sacrificing
work. "I'm not on the road that much, and a
lot of the time lill comes with me," he said, in
a statement long enough to connect minute
three to minute four. "I'm 28, I need to he
working. When I'm 38, I'll slow down a little."
Along with a new musical style, a new wife
and a baby on the way, Connick is also enjoy
ing a burgeoning film career. Although he
has acted in "Memphis Belle," "Little Man
Tate" and even an episode of "Cheers," the
new release "Copycat", with Holly Hunter
and Sigourney Weaver, has brought him a
new kind of attention.
"It's just a whole different level of fame,"
he said. "A lot more people see movies than
buy records."
Filming "Copycat" with Weaver, Connick
said he "just tried to keep his mouth shut and
listen and learn."
Ironically, the yawn followed that last
comment.
Connick finished shooting "Indepen
dence Day" about two weeks ago with Will
Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum,
which he describes as the story of "a big alien

spaceship that takes over the earth." The film
is due out Inlv 4th.
"Movies are iust another way to feed my
ego," Connick said. "I need to perform."
The son of New Orleans music store own
ers, Connick has been performing for most
of his life. He entertained at his father's
swearing-in ceremony when he was six, and
made his recording debut with a local jazz
band before he had turned 10. After studying
and playing piano with James Booker, I His
Marsalis and Dclfeavo Marsalis as a child,
Connick moved to New York at 18 to study
music at Hunter College and the Manhattan
School of Music before cutting his first solo
album at the age of 19.
Minute six.
More films in the future?
"I like doing movies, they're a lot of fun."

Could we maybe get more specific?
"If a script comes along that I like with a
good director, 1 11 grab it, but I'm not like
planning anything, you know."
New album?
"It's not that hard to throw one down
when I feel like it."
Where does he see his style heading?
"I just want to keep getting better."
The enlightening round is over, Harry's
yawning again and my seven minutes are up.

/jjjarry Connick |r. yawned for about
rll 25 seconds of our seven-minute
1L interview Monday morning.
I can't say that I blame him.
It's just that at minute four of a seven
minute interview, a 25-second yawn can be a
definitive moment by default.
Seven minutes isn't much time to get to
know anyone, but it's really not much time
with singer / pianist ('.onnick, who was as re
served and stoic in conversation as he is ani
mated and loquacious in concert. Not that he
was unfriendly at all. He was polite, apolo
gizing for the yawn and everything, and he
even called me a "cool kid at one point,
which really means something coming from
a jazz type.
Connick was just reticent, which must
have been helpful when he was questioned in
1993 for trying to pack a gun onto an air
plane, but wasn't quite such a boon Monday
morning.
The funny thing is, there's a lot to say
about Connick right now.
He
Connick made a splash crooning roman
tic favorites like "It Had To Be You" and
"Don't Cet Around Much Anymore" on
1989's "When Harry Met Sally" soundtrack,
his punchy big band standards appealing
both to jazz connoisseurs and lay folks. I lis
dreamboat good looks didn't hurt him any
either; critics never seemed to tire of calling
Connick "a young Frank Sinatra." He slid
original numbers onto his next two albums,
"We Are in Love" (which won him a 1991
grammy for Best la// Vocal Performance)
and "Blue l ight, Red I ight," both highly suc
cessful recordings in the same well-received
swing mode.
Connick settled into a niche. As a
spokesmodel for pop-jazz, the less-than-in
novative (kmnick was celebrated for success
fully peddling jazz to a mass market which
eluded most artists throughout the '70s and
'80s. He was seen as sort of a pre-fab Mel
Torme or Guy Lombardo, allowed to pro
duce big band albums and even the occasion
al side project in peace, so long as he gave the
people what they wanted.
Problem was, Harry wanted more.
Last year, he released "She" — a New Or
leans-style pop-jazz album laced with funk
and rock that, with its electric guitars and
hushed ballads, will at least ensure that Con
nick and the rest of the world get a break
from Sinatra comparisons. But, in rocking
his way through numbers like "Joe Slam and
the Spaceship," Connick has rocked right out
of the hearts of many fans and critics longing
for the old 1 larry.
"A lot of people probably hate the new
sound, but that's cool," Connick said, in a
particularly garrulous moment around

minute two. "It wasn't really going out on a
