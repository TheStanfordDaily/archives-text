# BLATANT PROPAGANDA FOR ONE COOL MAG
## 
### CURTIS SITTENFELD 
Might magazine has a circulation of
30,000, no copy machine, no coffee maker
and no payroll. Published out of San Francis
co by a group of smart-alecky college grads, it
is a magazine for magazine junkies.
According to senior editor Paul Tullis,
"Our audience is people who read a lot, who
are left feeling dry and unfulfilled by main
stream consumer magazines telling you what
products you can buy to make yourself cool
in the eyes of your peers. We have serious cul
tural analysis and political analysis, in a frame
that is invigorating and lively." Or, as associ
ate editor Zev Borow explains it, "Might is
not a total fucking chore to read."
The cover of the first issue of Might, pub
lished in February 1994, promised, "NO
STARS! NO MODELS! NO FASHION! JUST
BRAINS AND HEAVENLY SURPRISES!"
Among the heavenly surprises which ap
peared in that and other issues have been
commentary on marriage, wigs, investment
banking, environmentalism, David Hassel
hoffand what happens if you cut off your ear.
With no corporate sponsor and minimal
support from advertisers, the staff of Might
has produced eight bi-monthly issues. The
magazine is oversized, made of non-glossy
paper and has weird bright graphics.
Media coverage has been practically effu
sive— The Washington Post identified Might
as "the best of the crop," and the (Chicago Tri
bune labeled it "side-splitting [and) hilari
ous." In a profile of Might printed last June,
Newsweek called it "funny, knowing and
wryly on target."
The three editors in chief David l agers,
1 )avid Moodie and Marny Requa — are long
time friends who created the precursor of
Might when they were all in high school in
Lake Forest, 111., a (Chicago suburb. Most of
the current editors learned about the maga
zine through friends of friends, l'wo editors
are roommates.
At Might's headquarters, on the sixth floor
ol a downtown office building, everyone's
desks are in a large open room. Magazines are

strewn on the floor along one wall, and when
Lggers is put on hold during a telephone call,
he stretches out on the carpet and goes to
sleep. An editor in chief is as likely as an intern
to answer the phone.
I he same informality permeates the mag
azine. The fiction in the lune / |ulv 1995 issue
by (ilasgow Phillips, a former Stegner Fel
low at Stanford — was described in the table
of contents as "Fiction by a guy who went out
with a girl Paul [Tullisj went out with before
Paul did. He dumped her. I hen she dumped
Paul. He still hasn't gotten over her, he's so
pathetic."' A subscription coupon reads,
"You're probably not supposed to send cash
in the mail, but we don't really mind. And a
notice at the bottom ol the op-ed page tells
readers, "Might welcomes your letters, even il
they're poorly written and filled with horrible
grammatical errors.''
"We get asked, 'Aren't you afraid people
don't get the jokes and references?'" says
Tullis. "Our response is, so what? The people
who do get the jokes and references are so
grateful a magazine assumes they have cul
tural literacy and don't have to have culture
and politics defined for them."
Of the more serious articles, the one which
prompted the strongest response was subti
tled "Confessions of an Investment Banker."
The article outlined such corporate frauds
and feats as negotiating with a Japanese real
estate company which purposely overpaid
$235 million lor a Manhattan office building,
entirely for the sake of gaining entry into the
(iuinness Book of World Records. The article
was translated into Hebrew, Japanese,
Swedish and French, says Tullis, and was ex
cerpted in periodicals ranging from The Is
raeli I )aily I la'aretz to I larper's.
During a mid-day conversation in late Oc
tober, Tullis, Borow, Vice President I ance
c rapo and I ditorial Assistant Nancy Miller
are usually animated and occasionally impa
tient. Discussing Might's history and finan
cial problems seems to bore them, lullis is
eager to point out that after a recent book
deal with Putnam, "We're better oil than
we've ever been."
"We're interested in expanding horizon

tallv," lk>row says. "We have a fan
tasy that we'll be multi-media
moguls, with books, bands, radio
shows, lord dealerships."
Comments among the editors
frequently segue into absurdity. "I
wore .1 sweater the other night I've
had since eighth grade,' iullis says
to no one in particular. "Pure
acrylic." l ater, heading down a
crowded sidewalk outside the
Might oflke, I ullis makes his com
panions pause so that he can
demonstrate on ( rapo .1 particu
larly cheesy manner of embracing.
"We're such a big bunch of
blowhards here, says Miller.
"When I started as an intern, I
didn't talk for two months. Every
one was brilliant and tunny and

well spoken. I veryone's doing this polka
dance, and you have to wait tor a time to
jump in. Of course, I'm a social moron.'
As a woman who was "breast-fed on
Vogue," Miller is pleased to be working at a
maga/ine that treats equality between the
sexes as a given. In fact, Might regularly
mocks women's magazines. Fake tables of
contents have offered "articles" entitled "12
Ways You Don't Look Right," "Products You
Can Buy to 1 lide Your Defects," and "Ten All-
Fruit Diets That Really Really Work."
Hut Miller is quick to explain, "We're not
caught up in ho said / she said shit. 1 very
body's prey."
The theme of the most recent issue (see pic
ture) is "selling out" and includes an advertise
ment on the cover and record reviews written
In the artists' own publicists. The press release
tor the issue announces, "Never has a maga
zine so abandoned any pretense ol integrity.
1 loorav!"
Another notable issue was "a celebration
of all things cheesy. A celebration of life it
self." Not content to identify standard "tacky,
mall rat cheese," editors provided a list of 277
items and phenomena astonishing in both
their specificity and familiarity; reading the
list makes you feel as it the editors have been
eavesdropping on your conversations.

Among the cheesy faux pas: still quoting
"Pulp Fiction;" signs that tell you to flush;
turning your calculator upside-down and
spelling bad words like "hell;" dreaming
about being immortal; laser shows (Bonus:
laser shows set to classic rock!); food served in
a sourdough bowl.
So who is the discerning non-cheesy mi
nority that comprises Might's readership?
"Trendsetters in prison," Tullis says. "Stan
ford students."
"My mom likes it a whole lot," Borow
adds. The typical Might subscriber, he says, is
"an androgynous college-educated 24-year
old who hates his job, had one or two sexual
experiences growing up, is an occasional
recreational drug user and buys lots of music
and video games."
And who is the target readership? Without
hesitating, Borow says, "Everyone."
