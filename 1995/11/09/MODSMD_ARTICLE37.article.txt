# Sabnuards show off some magic and music

Time is the only reliable test
of true comedy. I ike fleeting fads,
humor tends to tickle our fancies
only as lone as the tits of laughter

last. Occasionally, however, a genius comes
along and creates something with enough
truth, charm and wit to outlast one genera
tion, and remain entertaining for the next.
1 he comic operettas of Arthur Gilbert and
W.S. Sullivan have poked fun at themselves
tor over a century and audiences are still
rolling in the aisles. The clever ingenuity of
Gilbert's words set to Sullivan's enchanting
melodies combine into powerful chemical
reactions. The result is an effervescent canon
of works that has enchanted audiences for
generations.
For the next two weekends, the Stanford
Savoyards will present one of the first and
most rarely performed Gilbert and Sullivan
shows: "The Sorcerer."
A rare showing
Compared to the sensationally popular
"Pirates of Penzance," "H.M.S. Pinafore" and
"The Mikado," "The Sorcerer" seems like an
unfairly neglected sibling. The first of Gilbert
and Sullivan's full-length collaborations, it
has not enjoyed as much stage time as other
works. The show was last performed at Stan
ford in 1986.
The Stanford Savoyards, now in their 22nd
year of promoting and producing Gilbert and
Sullivan shows, are resurrecting the oft-ig
nored operetta for their fall show.
The Board of Savoyards' Executive Direc
tor Kevin Igan — who was instrumental in
choosing "The Sorcerer" — said he expects
audiences to appreciate not only the simple
charm of the operetta's story, but also the rare
glimpse at the beginnings of the collaborative
genius that came to define 19th-century I ng
lish satire.
"This is a production a lot of people miss
out on," Igan said. "This particular show of
fers such great insight to (iilbert and Sullivan
in their earlier stages. This is a rare opportu
nity to see a side of Gilbert and Sullivan that
you might not see in other works."
l ike all Gilbert and Sullivan, "The Sorcer
er" has a wide appeal that welcomes any au
dience regardless of their level of knowledge
about operettas. The only prerequisite need
ed to enjoy one of the shows is an affinity for
self-ridiculing satire.
"Gilbert and Sullivan is one of the funniest
traditions in the English language of (the Vic
torian Age). Although a lot of theater already
assumes a certain level of sophistication,
Gilbert and Sullivan is accessible to any audi
ence with a sense of humor," Igan said.
Limpid love and magic spells
When "The Sorcerer" was first performed
in 1877, Victorian theatergoers were growing
tired of the vacuous absurdity of the comedy
characteristic of French opera bouffe — the
spicy style that most early 19th-century Kng-

lish theater mimicked.
Sensing the widespread desire
for a more morally respectable 1 ng
lish stage, Gilbert and Sullivan de
cided that wry satire was the best
mirror to hold up to British society,
one which would make men and
women chuckle at their charming
weaknesses. The canon that
emerged from their ingenious al
liance, often called Comedy of
Manners, has become the working
definition of Victorian satire.
The hilariously honest self
mocking panache fathered the dry
British wit typical of modern tradi
tions like Monty Python. "The Sor
cerer invites the audience's histori
cal imagination for a jovial waltz
through a society in pre-industrial
I ngland as it might have been if
class lines had not been so rigidly
stratified.
The curtain opens as a merry
medley of perfectly matched couples
prances across the stage in an

arrangement as ordered as the social
hierarchies typical of 19th-century English
life. Their giggles, whispers and hatting eye
lashes compose a jolly portrait of wooing eti
quette.
The jubilant overture spills joy into the au
dience, but the merriment, as the tears of a
young maiden promptly hint, is only a dis
guise for a deeper problem: the unfairness of
social fetters that prevent courtships across
class lines.
Oh rapture! Fear not. Alexis Poindexter
(Frank Farris), the insufferably corny roman
tic lead, envisions a recipe for a "love that
loves for love alone."
Revealing the secret to universal happi
ness, Alexis proclaims, "Oh, that the world
would break down the artificial barriers of
rank, wealth, education, age, beauty, habits,
taste and recognize that in marriage alone is
to be found the panacea for every ill!"
Fnter the shrewd salesman of magic and
spells, Mr. John Wellington Wells (Bergman).
Poor Wells never chose to be a sorcerer. Like
all tradesmen of his day, he simply followed
in his father's professional footsteps, carrying
on his family's old-established tradition of
sorcery.
So when Alexis, the noble-minded control
freak, commissions Wells' supernatural ser
vices, he rises to the entrepreneurial occasion
as any businessman would and gives the ide
alistic aristocrat his "Patent Oxy-Hydrogen
Love-at-first-sight Philtre." The romantic
havoc his concoction inflicts on the village is
,111 unfortunate and unanticipated side effect.
The mismatched couples that end up
falling in love defy all well-established social
norms, a romantic innovation that pleases
Alexis, who trumpets "the good that will
come of these ill-assorted unions."
His opinion changes quickly when he sees

his betrothed Aline (Karma Raines) — whom
he coaxed into drinking the love potion in
order to ensure that their love would hurdle
any obstacle — falls in love with the elderly
town vicar.
However propitious the ending might
seem, the final curtain call does not close the
issue at the heart of the operetta: the unfair
arrangement of social strata. Instead, the
ending offers the quick fix Gilbert and Sulli
van's audiences were hoping for. The open
ended denouement keeps the subject fresh
for modern audiences, raising a difficult
question: Just how far have we come in our
efforts to loosen the bindings of class distinc
tions?
Class-conscious production
In addition to providing a spirited glimpse
of lovers in 19th century England, "The Sor
cerer" reminds audiences that class conflicts
which might seem out-dated are more alive
and troubling today than we often realize.
"The fact remains and the show proves
that though we aren't peasants or aristocracy,
we are all to a certain extent trapped where we
are in society," Director Liz Palfreyman said.
To add visual emphasis to the operetta's
theme of class rigidity, Palfreyman's original
set design departs from the traditionally real
istic backdrop most often used in Gilbert and
Sullivan shows.
Instead, this show's set is abstract, spare in
details that distract from the performance it
self. Enclosing the garden where the action
takes place, symmetrical ivy-covered walls
create a visual sense of claustrophobia. Four
marble pillars cast shadows that resemble
prison bars, reinforcing further the feeling of
social entrapment.
"This is the first time we've really had a set

that supports an underlying concept in the
show," Palfreyman explained. " The produc
tion will be as exciting visually as it will be for
the ear."
Splendid
Palfreyman sings high praise for "an ex
tremely talented cast." Most cast members are
veterans to the Gilbert and Sullivan stage, and
some have performed the operettas for as
many as 20 years.
Close to 100 Savoyards have put the pro
duction together in the month that followed
the early October casting. Describing the
zealous ethic that embodies the spirit of the
Savoyards, chorus member Neil Midkiff said,
"The real joy is putting together something
that requires the contributions of so many
people. Most of us have put considerable ef
fort into sets, lighting, costumes, publicity,
orchestra. It's a real collaborative effort done
purely for the love of it."
The timelessness of Gilbert and Sullivan's
humor sings a lovable illustration of how
richly opera can decorate the English lan
guage.
"We have some of the best voices in the Bay
Area," said musical director Paul Zawilski.
"The performance will be splendid."
