### STORY BY ALLISON AMEND PHOTOS BY PAT TOWER 
The
thing
about Big
Game Gai

eties is, its one
big secret. I could

'O * — ~ ~
tell you about it, but
then I'd have to kill you.

Talking to a Ram's I lead mem

ber is like reconstructing a congressional

meeting; tor every fact, there are a thousand
askance glances, cleared throats and shrugged
shoulders. The plain truth is that no one knows
anything about this year's Gaieties, except the
people involved.
Hidden files

"The Axe Files" is a "mystery" says actress (and
potential transfer student) Anne Cunha. Any rela
tion to the popular television show of the similar
name is purely intentional.
" The title has something to do with the show,"
says director Salma Qarnain vaguely.
"Its loosely based on the television show," ad
mits head writer Michael (ireen. "But its an origi
nal concept."

Originality is not a word
usually associ-

a ted with (iaieties, but this is not a usual (iaieties
"I'd like to stress the tact that this is a Ciaieties
for upperelassmen as well," says producer
Marisa Pick.
Green agrees, "This is a (iaieties that up
perclassmen will be proud to see, not seeing it
freshman year. And having seen it freshman
year is no longer an excuse for not seeing it."
So what's different about it? Well, I can't
tell you.
"It's Gaieties with a conscience. When we mur
der someone on stage, we feel had about it,"
(ireen says.
"The big hitch was writing the thing in iambic
pentameter," he jokes. "We all had to take a Shake
speare class to do the rhyming couplets. Usually,
they just copy out old Pearl Jam lyrics."
But seriously. "In the past it's been a major spir
it activity. Hut this year, even though it is a spirit ac
tivity, it's definitely solid musical theater. It's not
just rah-rah pre-Big Game nonsense," Pick says.
Even the plot is out of the ordinary. "It's a real
script. It's not the typical freshman meets hasher
and they walk into the sunset. There's none of that
trite romance; it's all actual story and plot," she
says.
And the plot would be? "It's everything hut ro
mance. It's suspenseful; it's a comedy," explains
Pick.
"Think conspiracy," she hints. "Think Oliver
Stone would really get a kick out of it."
"It's really plot-based, plot-driven," says Qar
nain, " There is a point to the music."
"It's not just a skit with a couple of songs thrown
in," Pick adds.
Practice makes perfect
I he excitement in Memorial Auditorium is audi
ble. With just 15 days left before production, the
actors are smiling and the energy is evident.
Freshman Jason Alisharan is working with
Ram's I lead for the first time. "The cast has a lot of
professionalism, too. Everybody comes to work to
get down to it. We don't spend a lot of time mess
ing around. Sometimes, though, Salma has to get

us on track now and then," he says.
"This is my first time really di
rectinga lot of people in a theater sense
... You just have to get used to a rela
tionship with your cast, Qarnain says.
She's been building this relation
ship since school started. "The show

takes about six weeks to do, says Qarnain. Since
auditions, which were held early in the quarter, the
actors have been rehearsing between three and five
hours almost every day. "A lot of time and work
have gone into the show, just because the script de
mands such a rigorous schedule, " she adds.
What exactly does the script demand? Does the
title's antecedent demand some super-natural spe
cial effects? They can't tell you, "but we are relying
heavily on sound and lighting and the orchestra,"
hints Qarnain.
Costumes and sets are also of tantamount im
portance. "We use costumes to attract the people
way in the back," says Ram's Head Executive Pro
ducer Laura Wilson. She promises that the cos
tume for Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid
James Montoya — a regular Gaieties performer
— will be a special surprise.
Memorial Auditorium's size dictates technical
issues as well, its large space influencing how much
scenery needs to be built.
Technical details can make or break Gaieties.
"We have a ton of technical people who just came
out of the woodwork. This year we've rallied more
tech people than ever," Pick says. They are a real
presence during rehearsals, painting and building
the original sets to look like — well, I can't tell you.
The rehearsal starts with a warm-up exercise,
and then the cast and crew gets down to business.
" I he cast has a real respect for the [production]
staff says Cunha, which may seem surprising
since the staff and the cast are peers. The entire
production is student run, from the original script,
cast music and set, and even to the costume de
signers.
"We have a huge directing staff and they all
bring something to it," Pick says. "We do it for the
love of theater and school spirit."
Though manned by students, the staff is not
afraid to consult the experts when necessary.
"Choreographer Sara [Farley] has been working
with a martial arts expert choreographing the
dances and fight scenes. It's very professionally
done," she says.
The Drama Department has also been very
helpful with Gaieties, by providing training and
even allowing Ram's Head to borrow some cos
tumes.
But overall, the professionalism comes 112 rom the
students. Alisharan says, "I've done a lot ofensem
ble work and this ranks right up there. We do haw
main characters, but evervone works together to

create an ensemble feeling. You really get the sense
that it's a group and a group rehearsal and it's really
nice to come to work everyday and be surrounded by
that."
I)espite its status as amateur theater, "Gaieties has
a commitment to doing high-quality theater," Pick
explains.
"I've done film and television before, and this
group seems to be a lot closer together ... It's very
professional," says Alisharan.
Cunha adds, "as far as the student-run produc
tions I've been in, this has been extremely well orga
nized."
"They're really open to suggestions" says Alisha
ran.
Even the Bard revised
Behind-the-scenes Gaieties began during spring
quarter when the head writer and the twelve sup
porting writers were chosen through a rigorous
writing sample and interview process.
"We have a brilliant writing staff," says Green im
modestly. Commenting on the staff's diversity,
Green adds that it is composed of everything "from
a lOOth-year senior to a freshman" and that all the
different humor venues on campus are represented,
as well as the disciplines.
Spring quarter, the writers discussed and work
shopped, wrote and rewrote. They finally revised
during the summer to keep the script current.
"We met twice a week from 3 to 5 a.m. and then
we split up the scene work," Green recalls. After the
writers finished the script, they sent it to music com
poser Jeremy Desmon, who wrote the original
melodies for the piece. Desmon, who is in Oxford
this quarter, will not have the chance to see the pro
duction, "but he'll be watching it via satellite
hookup. That's worked into the budget," jokes
Green.
Commenting on the actual music, Pick says, "Je
remy has had a lot of experience, and it really shows."
Associate Vocal Director Rachel Cederberg
agrees. "We've got a little bit of everything, from
Broadway musical stuff to '50s doo-wap to rap."
Administrative angst
"Dean Montoya sings a song," Green adds in an
uncharacteristic moment of candor.
"Montoya and [University President Gerhard]
Casper have a big part," Pick says. "They are not re
ally on our team, they're the bad guys."
Aha, so it's us against them, huh? Not really. "I

can't really say, but there's a real live killingon stage,'®
says Green. "We had to line up three actors for thJ
part, one for each night." 1
As for the big administrators, either Casper or'
Montoya might say a bad word. But I can't tell you
which one.
"Montoya is wonderful to work with," Green
continues. "He's got a great part, he's really excited
about it."
Not just for frosh anymore
Sunday s rehearsal winds down and the tired ac
tors begin to disperse. The stringent schedule
seems to be paying off; the cast is producing a pol
ished product.
"In the past, Gaieties came together on the last
day, but this time we could go up tomorrow and be
okay. The cast is more prepared than I 've ever seen
them," says Pick.
Pick adds that she is happy with the way ticket
sales have also mirrored the rehearsals. "We are al
most sold out for Friday night ... We've got over
1,600 people coming so far."
Pick thinks the high number is due to this year's
"real push for publicity. The response we've had
for tickets has far surpassed our imagination."
As for the expected audience, the Gaieties crew
hopes to see a lot of upperclassmen and not just
freshmen there. "Frosh will laugh, but the jokes are
written for upperclassmen," says Green. "We were
mostly upperclassmen on the [writing] staff. We
made a list of things we didn't want to see in Gai
eties. The jokes are standard Gaieties, but they sur
pass standard Gaieties."
"We have something in our program we've
never done before, a glossary which is part hu
morous, part informational" so that freshmen
will understand the lingo, says Pick.
"Now that we don't have the Axe, we still need
to keep the spirit alive, so we need to be a little
more creative as far as writing the show and de
ciding what to focus on," savs Wilson.

(i a let ics promises

Green says, "This

The
thing
about Big
Game Gai

eties is, its one
big secret. I could

'O * — ~ ~
tell you about it, but
then I'd have to kill you.

Talking to a Ram's I lead mem

ber is like reconstructing a congressional

meeting; tor every fact, there are a thousand
askance glances, cleared throats and shrugged
shoulders. The plain truth is that no one knows
anything about this year's Gaieties, except the
people involved.
Hidden files

"The Axe Files" is a "mystery" says actress (and
potential transfer student) Anne Cunha. Any rela
tion to the popular television show of the similar
name is purely intentional.
" The title has something to do with the show,"
says director Salma Qarnain vaguely.
"Its loosely based on the television show," ad
mits head writer Michael (ireen. "But its an origi
nal concept."

Originality is not a word
usually associ-

a ted with (iaieties, but this is not a usual (iaieties
"I'd like to stress the tact that this is a Ciaieties
for upperelassmen as well," says producer
Marisa Pick.
Green agrees, "This is a (iaieties that up
perclassmen will be proud to see, not seeing it
freshman year. And having seen it freshman
year is no longer an excuse for not seeing it."
So what's different about it? Well, I can't
tell you.
"It's Gaieties with a conscience. When we mur
der someone on stage, we feel had about it,"
(ireen says.
"The big hitch was writing the thing in iambic
pentameter," he jokes. "We all had to take a Shake
speare class to do the rhyming couplets. Usually,
they just copy out old Pearl Jam lyrics."
But seriously. "In the past it's been a major spir
it activity. Hut this year, even though it is a spirit ac
tivity, it's definitely solid musical theater. It's not
just rah-rah pre-Big Game nonsense," Pick says.
Even the plot is out of the ordinary. "It's a real
script. It's not the typical freshman meets hasher
and they walk into the sunset. There's none of that
trite romance; it's all actual story and plot," she
says.
And the plot would be? "It's everything hut ro
mance. It's suspenseful; it's a comedy," explains
Pick.
"Think conspiracy," she hints. "Think Oliver
Stone would really get a kick out of it."
"It's really plot-based, plot-driven," says Qar
nain, " There is a point to the music."
"It's not just a skit with a couple of songs thrown
in," Pick adds.
Practice makes perfect
I he excitement in Memorial Auditorium is audi
ble. With just 15 days left before production, the
actors are smiling and the energy is evident.
Freshman Jason Alisharan is working with
Ram's I lead for the first time. "The cast has a lot of
professionalism, too. Everybody comes to work to
get down to it. We don't spend a lot of time mess
ing around. Sometimes, though, Salma has to get

us on track now and then," he says.
"This is my first time really di
rectinga lot of people in a theater sense
... You just have to get used to a rela
tionship with your cast, Qarnain says.
She's been building this relation
ship since school started. "The show

takes about six weeks to do, says Qarnain. Since
auditions, which were held early in the quarter, the
actors have been rehearsing between three and five
hours almost every day. "A lot of time and work
have gone into the show, just because the script de
mands such a rigorous schedule, " she adds.
What exactly does the script demand? Does the
title's antecedent demand some super-natural spe
cial effects? They can't tell you, "but we are relying
heavily on sound and lighting and the orchestra,"
hints Qarnain.
Costumes and sets are also of tantamount im
portance. "We use costumes to attract the people
way in the back," says Ram's Head Executive Pro
ducer Laura Wilson. She promises that the cos
tume for Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid
James Montoya — a regular Gaieties performer
— will be a special surprise.
Memorial Auditorium's size dictates technical
issues as well, its large space influencing how much
scenery needs to be built.
Technical details can make or break Gaieties.
"We have a ton of technical people who just came
out of the woodwork. This year we've rallied more
tech people than ever," Pick says. They are a real
presence during rehearsals, painting and building
the original sets to look like — well, I can't tell you.
The rehearsal starts with a warm-up exercise,
and then the cast and crew gets down to business.
" I he cast has a real respect for the [production]
staff says Cunha, which may seem surprising
since the staff and the cast are peers. The entire
production is student run, from the original script,
cast music and set, and even to the costume de
signers.
"We have a huge directing staff and they all
bring something to it," Pick says. "We do it for the
love of theater and school spirit."
Though manned by students, the staff is not
afraid to consult the experts when necessary.
"Choreographer Sara [Farley] has been working
with a martial arts expert choreographing the
dances and fight scenes. It's very professionally
done," she says.
The Drama Department has also been very
helpful with Gaieties, by providing training and
even allowing Ram's Head to borrow some cos
tumes.
But overall, the professionalism comes 112 rom the
students. Alisharan says, "I've done a lot ofensem
ble work and this ranks right up there. We do haw
main characters, but evervone works together to

create an ensemble feeling. You really get the sense
that it's a group and a group rehearsal and it's really
nice to come to work everyday and be surrounded by
that."
I)espite its status as amateur theater, "Gaieties has
a commitment to doing high-quality theater," Pick
explains.
"I've done film and television before, and this
group seems to be a lot closer together ... It's very
professional," says Alisharan.
Cunha adds, "as far as the student-run produc
tions I've been in, this has been extremely well orga
nized."
"They're really open to suggestions" says Alisha
ran.
Even the Bard revised
Behind-the-scenes Gaieties began during spring
quarter when the head writer and the twelve sup
porting writers were chosen through a rigorous
writing sample and interview process.
"We have a brilliant writing staff," says Green im
modestly. Commenting on the staff's diversity,
Green adds that it is composed of everything "from
a lOOth-year senior to a freshman" and that all the
different humor venues on campus are represented,
as well as the disciplines.
Spring quarter, the writers discussed and work
shopped, wrote and rewrote. They finally revised
during the summer to keep the script current.
"We met twice a week from 3 to 5 a.m. and then
we split up the scene work," Green recalls. After the
writers finished the script, they sent it to music com
poser Jeremy Desmon, who wrote the original
melodies for the piece. Desmon, who is in Oxford
this quarter, will not have the chance to see the pro
duction, "but he'll be watching it via satellite
hookup. That's worked into the budget," jokes
Green.
Commenting on the actual music, Pick says, "Je
remy has had a lot of experience, and it really shows."
Associate Vocal Director Rachel Cederberg
agrees. "We've got a little bit of everything, from
Broadway musical stuff to '50s doo-wap to rap."
Administrative angst
"Dean Montoya sings a song," Green adds in an
uncharacteristic moment of candor.
"Montoya and [University President Gerhard]
Casper have a big part," Pick says. "They are not re
ally on our team, they're the bad guys."
Aha, so it's us against them, huh? Not really. "I

can't really say, but there's a real live killingon stage,'®
says Green. "We had to line up three actors for thJ
part, one for each night." 1
As for the big administrators, either Casper or'
Montoya might say a bad word. But I can't tell you
which one.
"Montoya is wonderful to work with," Green
continues. "He's got a great part, he's really excited
about it."
Not just for frosh anymore
Sunday s rehearsal winds down and the tired ac
tors begin to disperse. The stringent schedule
seems to be paying off; the cast is producing a pol
ished product.
"In the past, Gaieties came together on the last
day, but this time we could go up tomorrow and be
okay. The cast is more prepared than I 've ever seen
them," says Pick.
Pick adds that she is happy with the way ticket
sales have also mirrored the rehearsals. "We are al
most sold out for Friday night ... We've got over
1,600 people coming so far."
Pick thinks the high number is due to this year's
"real push for publicity. The response we've had
for tickets has far surpassed our imagination."
As for the expected audience, the Gaieties crew
hopes to see a lot of upperclassmen and not just
freshmen there. "Frosh will laugh, but the jokes are
written for upperclassmen," says Green. "We were
mostly upperclassmen on the [writing] staff. We
made a list of things we didn't want to see in Gai
eties. The jokes are standard Gaieties, but they sur
pass standard Gaieties."
"We have something in our program we've
never done before, a glossary which is part hu
morous, part informational" so that freshmen
will understand the lingo, says Pick.
"Now that we don't have the Axe, we still need

them," says Pick.
Pick adds that she is happy with the way ticket
sales have also mirrored the rehearsals. "We are al
most sold out for Friday night ... We've got over
1,600 people coming so far."
Pick thinks the high number is due to this year's
"real push for publicity. The response we've had
for tickets has far surpassed our imagination."
As for the expected audience, the Gaieties crew
hopes to see a lot of upperclassmen and not just
freshmen there. "Frosh will laugh, but the jokes are
written for upperclassmen," says Green. "We were
mostly upperclassmen on the [writing] staff. We
made a list of things we didn't want to see in Gai
eties. The jokes are standard Gaieties, but they sur
pass standard Gaieties."
"We have something in our program we've
never done before, a glossary which is part hu
morous, part informational" so that freshmen
will understand the lingo, says Pick.
"Now that we don't have the Axe, we still need
to keep the spirit alive, so we need to be a little
more creative as far as writing the show and de
ciding what to focus on," savs Wilson.

The
thing
about Big
Game Gai

eties is, its one
big secret. I could

'O * — ~ ~
tell you about it, but
then I'd have to kill you.

Talking to a Ram's I lead mem

ber is like reconstructing a congressional

meeting; tor every fact, there are a thousand
askance glances, cleared throats and shrugged
shoulders. The plain truth is that no one knows
anything about this year's Gaieties, except the
people involved.
Hidden files

"The Axe Files" is a "mystery" says actress (and
potential transfer student) Anne Cunha. Any rela
tion to the popular television show of the similar
name is purely intentional.
" The title has something to do with the show,"
says director Salma Qarnain vaguely.
"Its loosely based on the television show," ad
mits head writer Michael (ireen. "But its an origi
nal concept."

Originality is not a word
usually associ-

a ted with (iaieties, but this is not a usual (iaieties
"I'd like to stress the tact that this is a Ciaieties
for upperelassmen as well," says producer
Marisa Pick.
Green agrees, "This is a (iaieties that up
perclassmen will be proud to see, not seeing it
freshman year. And having seen it freshman
year is no longer an excuse for not seeing it."
So what's different about it? Well, I can't
tell you.
"It's Gaieties with a conscience. When we mur
der someone on stage, we feel had about it,"
(ireen says.
"The big hitch was writing the thing in iambic
pentameter," he jokes. "We all had to take a Shake
speare class to do the rhyming couplets. Usually,
they just copy out old Pearl Jam lyrics."
But seriously. "In the past it's been a major spir
it activity. Hut this year, even though it is a spirit ac
tivity, it's definitely solid musical theater. It's not
just rah-rah pre-Big Game nonsense," Pick says.
Even the plot is out of the ordinary. "It's a real
script. It's not the typical freshman meets hasher
and they walk into the sunset. There's none of that
trite romance; it's all actual story and plot," she
says.
And the plot would be? "It's everything hut ro
mance. It's suspenseful; it's a comedy," explains
Pick.
"Think conspiracy," she hints. "Think Oliver
Stone would really get a kick out of it."
"It's really plot-based, plot-driven," says Qar
nain, " There is a point to the music."
"It's not just a skit with a couple of songs thrown
in," Pick adds.
Practice makes perfect
I he excitement in Memorial Auditorium is audi
ble. With just 15 days left before production, the
actors are smiling and the energy is evident.
Freshman Jason Alisharan is working with
Ram's I lead for the first time. "The cast has a lot of
professionalism, too. Everybody comes to work to
get down to it. We don't spend a lot of time mess
ing around. Sometimes, though, Salma has to get

us on track now and then," he says.
"This is my first time really di
rectinga lot of people in a theater sense
... You just have to get used to a rela
tionship with your cast, Qarnain says.
She's been building this relation
ship since school started. "The show

takes about six weeks to do, says Qarnain. Since
auditions, which were held early in the quarter, the
actors have been rehearsing between three and five
hours almost every day. "A lot of time and work
have gone into the show, just because the script de
mands such a rigorous schedule, " she adds.
What exactly does the script demand? Does the
title's antecedent demand some super-natural spe
cial effects? They can't tell you, "but we are relying
heavily on sound and lighting and the orchestra,"
hints Qarnain.
Costumes and sets are also of tantamount im
portance. "We use costumes to attract the people
way in the back," says Ram's Head Executive Pro
ducer Laura Wilson. She promises that the cos
tume for Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid
James Montoya — a regular Gaieties performer
— will be a special surprise.
Memorial Auditorium's size dictates technical
issues as well, its large space influencing how much
scenery needs to be built.
Technical details can make or break Gaieties.
"We have a ton of technical people who just came
out of the woodwork. This year we've rallied more
tech people than ever," Pick says. They are a real
presence during rehearsals, painting and building
the original sets to look like — well, I can't tell you.
The rehearsal starts with a warm-up exercise,
and then the cast and crew gets down to business.
" I he cast has a real respect for the [production]
staff says Cunha, which may seem surprising
since the staff and the cast are peers. The entire
production is student run, from the original script,
cast music and set, and even to the costume de
signers.
"We have a huge directing staff and they all
bring something to it," Pick says. "We do it for the
love of theater and school spirit."
Though manned by students, the staff is not
afraid to consult the experts when necessary.
"Choreographer Sara [Farley] has been working
with a martial arts expert choreographing the
dances and fight scenes. It's very professionally
done," she says.
The Drama Department has also been very
helpful with Gaieties, by providing training and
even allowing Ram's Head to borrow some cos
tumes.
But overall, the professionalism comes 112 rom the
students. Alisharan says, "I've done a lot ofensem
ble work and this ranks right up there. We do haw
main characters, but evervone works together to

create an ensemble feeling. You really get the sense
that it's a group and a group rehearsal and it's really
nice to come to work everyday and be surrounded by
that."
I)espite its status as amateur theater, "Gaieties has
a commitment to doing high-quality theater," Pick
explains.
"I've done film and television before, and this
group seems to be a lot closer together ... It's very
professional," says Alisharan.
Cunha adds, "as far as the student-run produc
tions I've been in, this has been extremely well orga
nized."
"They're really open to suggestions" says Alisha
ran.
Even the Bard revised
Behind-the-scenes Gaieties began during spring
quarter when the head writer and the twelve sup
porting writers were chosen through a rigorous
writing sample and interview process.
"We have a brilliant writing staff," says Green im
modestly. Commenting on the staff's diversity,
Green adds that it is composed of everything "from
a lOOth-year senior to a freshman" and that all the
different humor venues on campus are represented,
as well as the disciplines.
Spring quarter, the writers discussed and work
shopped, wrote and rewrote. They finally revised
during the summer to keep the script current.
"We met twice a week from 3 to 5 a.m. and then
we split up the scene work," Green recalls. After the
writers finished the script, they sent it to music com
poser Jeremy Desmon, who wrote the original
melodies for the piece. Desmon, who is in Oxford
this quarter, will not have the chance to see the pro
duction, "but he'll be watching it via satellite
hookup. That's worked into the budget," jokes
Green.
Commenting on the actual music, Pick says, "Je
remy has had a lot of experience, and it really shows."
Associate Vocal Director Rachel Cederberg
agrees. "We've got a little bit of everything, from
Broadway musical stuff to '50s doo-wap to rap."
Administrative angst
"Dean Montoya sings a song," Green adds in an
uncharacteristic moment of candor.
"Montoya and [University President Gerhard]
Casper have a big part," Pick says. "They are not re
ally on our team, they're the bad guys."
Aha, so it's us against them, huh? Not really. "I

can't really say, but there's a real live killingon stage,'®
says Green. "We had to line up three actors for thJ
part, one for each night." 1
As for the big administrators, either Casper or'
Montoya might say a bad word. But I can't tell you
which one.
"Montoya is wonderful to work with," Green
continues. "He's got a great part, he's really excited
about it."
Not just for frosh anymore
Sunday s rehearsal winds down and the tired ac
tors begin to disperse. The stringent schedule
seems to be paying off; the cast is producing a pol
ished product.
"In the past, Gaieties came together on the last
day, but this time we could go up tomorrow and be
okay. The cast is more prepared than I 've ever seen
them," says Pick.
Pick adds that she is happy with the way ticket
sales have also mirrored the rehearsals. "We are al
most sold out for Friday night ... We've got over
1,600 people coming so far."
Pick thinks the high number is due to this year's
