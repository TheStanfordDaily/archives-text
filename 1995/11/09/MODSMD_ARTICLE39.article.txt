## THE 						AMPS Pater 
### 
Kim Deal equals the Amps, hut thai
doesn't mean the Amps' allnim "Pacer" is jusi
a name for a new Breeders lull length. Sure
Deal's two deals share personnel (behemoth
Breeder drummer lim MacPherson is an
Amp too) and material (the track "I loverin'
is an old B-side), but "Pacer holds little re
semblance to any Breeders offering. Mori
like a solo project, I )eal's new act and new I I 1
exude an intimate personality that often gets
muddled in the self conscious quirkiness ol
her other gig's warped fare.
The leadoff / title track sets the immediate
tone ol "Pacer" with its fu//y, twangv guitars.
When Deal delivers the first lines, "Now I'd
like to get back / I'd like to get to the other
side," in her warm, husky voice, she cuts to
the emotional core in a poignant and viscei
ally affecting way. " I ippC its " maintains the
mood as it cranks up the energy, chugging
away with surly rhythms and Deal's unem
bellished howls in the background. In the
context ol the vibrant ditty, the lyrics "Pea
cock /Caught looking in the mirror/Stop
drinking my beer" shine through not so
much because they're strange, but because
they're strange, personable and tunny. Deal
soars into the third cut, "I Am Decided," an
infectious pop tune smoother than the two
before it.
That's not to say that Deal plays it straight
with the Amps, but only that her improvised
musings stay within the scope of the songs
rather than bury the tunes under the weight
of oddball accents. "Breaking the Split Screen
Barrier" stops and goes with bursts of
buzzed-out sounds, aiming nowhere but get
ting somewhere as Deal's wispv, reverberat

ing singing wanders forward in a bleary-eyed
stupor.
"Dedicated" closes "Pacer" appropriately,
moving ahead in many directions at once.
Lurching to a false start with a sparse, gritty
riff and witty, blunt pondering, "II you were
one big mass / Never get a c hance to kick ass,"
the tune eases into a stretch of bubbly pop
without answering Deal's hypothetical.
Whatever the reply, there's no question that
Deal is at her creative best on "Dedicated,"
where the allure of her eccentricities don't
overwhelm the music but, instead, amplify
its subtleties and unique«.harm.
