-1 he race is on across the country to find
a man suspected of stealing a wide variety
of items — from credit cards to cars — from
several university campuses, including
Stanford.
A $150,000 extradition warrant has
been issued by Stanford Police for the ar
rest and return of the man to the Palo Alto
area.
Alton Faletoi Jr., 30, is wanted by Stan
ford Police on numerous charges of bur
glary. Police have been on his tail since
June when a Stanford professor reported
the theft of a credit card.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said a professor who works in the McCul
lough Building reported that his American

Express card was missing and that he had
been charged $579 for telephone calls and
other items. Stanford Police called the
phone numbers listed on the credit card bill
and were connected directly to people Fale
toi had called, allegedly using the card.
These people became informants and gave
police the identity of the suspect, police
said.
Police were then able to trace Faletoi's
movements after he left Stanford in June.
Faletoi returned to the Portland area and
then decided to go to Southern California,
Niemeyer said.
On the way to Southern California, Fale
toi stopped at Stanford in September and
added to his list of crimes by allegedly com
mitting additional burglaries. Between his
June and September visits to Stanford,

Building, Lane Medical Library, Polya Hall
and the Gilbert Biological Sciences Build
ing, Niemeyer said.
Alter leaving Stanford, Faletoi picked up
a hitchhiker who befriended him, police
said. When Faletoi's truck broke down, tho
hitchhiker took Faletoi to an auto shop.
The auto shop owner did not have the parts

needed to fix the truck, and he gave Faletoi
the keys to his Saab so Faletoi could buy the
parts and bring them back to the shop. The
hitchhiker and the auto shop owner have
not seen Faletoi since, police said.
Faletoi returned north in mid-October
and allegedly committed more burglaries
along the way.
Niemeyer said Faletoi got the call to "go
east, young man" because police were after
him on the West Coast. On Oct. 23, he al
legedly stole an ROTC vehicle from the
University of Utah and headed toward
lowa, Niemeyer said.
()n Oct. 25, Faletoi was stopped by state
troopers along Interstate 80 in lowa near
the Illinois border. While state troopers
checked his license and registration, Fale
toi raced off in his stolen lIOTC car. A high-

doned his car and was able to elude

police.
The abandoned car contained
stolen property from Stanford and
other universities, including Reed
College, Lewis and Clark College
and the University of Utah, police
said. The items included comput

ers, cellular phones, credit cards
and university departmental keys.
Police have been unable to locate
Faletoi. Niemeyer said he suspects
Faletoi has stolen another air and
is in hiding.
Faletoi also is wanted in Clacka

mas County, Ore., on a probation
violation, and in King County,
Wash., on burglary charges.
Stanford Police have placed
information on Faletoi in a nation
