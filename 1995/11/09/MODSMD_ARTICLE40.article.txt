Anyone lucky enough to have seen 1 immy
taylor careen and convulse about .1 concert
stage like a horribly deranged Jim Carrey
should be able to appreciate the honest} in his
shout of "(io freaks go! at the start of Hraini
ai's new "Internationale" single. Hrainiac are
indeed freaks, and more than ever before,
they've taken their relentlessly jerky rhythms
anil splattenngs of noise to a higher level —to
some strange and brilliant smattering of punk,
art, pop and technology.
The lead-off track, "Go Freaks (io," takes
off from its initial yell, launching into a dis
turbingly great seizure of a song, complete
with screeching noise bits and hopelessly
scrambled vocals about "excessive gyration"
and the like.
Equally impressive is "Simon Says," which
starts out with some fuzzy, out of-tunc
riffage, before settling into a groove reminis
cent of Sonic Youth's "Dirty" made 10 times
more interesting. Ultimately, the track ex
plodes into a surging, squealing chorus that

seems to have
the word "alive"
repeated and
mangled within
it, even after
Simon says,
"You're dead."
Wedged in
between the
two stellar
tracks is the
Ihro w a w v
mood piece
"Silver lodine,"
its lonely, muf
fled voice tense
ly wandering
over .1 layer ol
odd sound ef
fects and
bustling static.
It's an awkward
break, even a
tad annoying,
but it's well de
served and
much - needed
within "Inter

n a t i o 11 a I es
perfect 10-minute freak show.
