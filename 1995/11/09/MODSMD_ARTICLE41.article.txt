# LIZ PHAIR
## Juvenilia 
### 
One signpost of having arrived as a rock
star is the dubious honor of seeing your for
mative work repackaged and sold after the
fact, be it precocious or precarious. Liz
Phair's latest release, "Juvenilia," a compila
tion of tracks largely taken from demo tapes
known as the "Girly Sound Cassettes," is
both.
By turns repetitive and frankly adolescent,
or deliciously whimsical and cutting, Phair's
uneven collection of stray tracks occasional
ly shows flashes ol her shimmering guitar
work and trademark forthrightness (and
cussing). Within tracks, Phair hits both in
sightful and absurd notes, but the juxtaposi
tion is almost always interesting to listen to.
Her cover of "Turning Japanese," for ex
ample, sounds like a TV soundtrack on
speed. Amidst synthesized cliches of China
town tunes, an electric guitar reminiscent of
"Beverly Hills 90210" chimes as Phair
singsongs "I think I'm turning Japanese, 1
think I'm turning Japanese, 1 think I'm turn
ing Japanese, 1 really think so" at a frenetic
pace. But I'm not sure why.
At the other end of the spectrum, the
album's closing track, "Easy," makes a foray
into the dark and messy corners of incom
plete relationships that Phair describes so
well. "1 laughed when I had thought you
died, because I didn't know what else I was
going to do / Now I laugh when I see you
alive because I think you're just pulling my
leg." Though the mood shifts aren't quite as
deft as the work on her debut opus, "Exile in
Guyville," Phair still creates an aural glow of
bittersweet, sometimes comic, detachment.
Though slightly patchier, Phair's textured
and natural guitar work also shines through
on "Batmobile." The chorus grates, but
Phair's lyrical gifts are especially lucid on the

occasional verse: "I hope you all can see there
just isn't a place here for me /1 look around
and feel that somebody must be fucking with
me /1 just can't take any of you seriously."
The album's opener, "Jealousy," originally
from her latest full-length, "Whip-smart," is
a radio-friendly could-have-been with its
taut, insistent beat. Also good is the flippant
"California," where a couple economical
music phrases serve mostly as segues for a
drawn-out and ridiculous joke about bulls
and cows. Awesome.
On the weaker side, "Animal Girl" fore
shadows some of the sonorous piano stuffon
"Exile," but the verse — "There's a gathering
crowd of heavy-breasted men" — is peculiar
at best. It's also an abrupt reminder of Phair's
limited vocal talents, at times like a child's
singing, earnest and somewhat painful to lis
ten to. The remaining tracks, "South I )akota"
and "Dead Shark," suffer from repetitiveness
and momentum drags.
Though "Juvenilia" 's inconsistencies may
drive away casual listeners, there's still
enough here to interest those who aren't
diehard l.iz followers.
