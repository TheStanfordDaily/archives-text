## VARIOUS ARTISTS Mallrats Soundtrack 
### 
Free-floating alternative refuse, formerlv
found b-siding into deserved obscurity, has fi
nails discovered its spotlight. Soundtracks of
mo\ ies you'll probably never see advocate radio
rejects, magnetizing second-rate alt scrubs just
a half-beat awa\ from the major league I IV!
105 "in crowd." The effect is one of desperation
— the forced endorsement of under qualified
songs onto over-demanding ears.
"Bubbles by Bush, the first track on the
relentlessly unappealing soundtrack to
"Mallrats," is a good example. A one-riff ex
periment, numbingh repetitious and
doltishly uncatchy, the song never should
have seen the light of day.
You could bargain-bin much of the "Mall
rats" soundtrack, in fact, with relatively little
remorse. The sub-par tracks by such one-hit
wonders as Sponge and Sublime are hardly
surprising. Habitually adequate Belly pro
duce the lazily annoying "Broken," and you
can imagine how much fun it is to listen to ju
venile Aussi playmates Silverchair get
"Stoned." Wax produce serviceably listcnable
pop with "Mallrats," but their shopping-as
relationship metaphor ("Damaged goods, no
receipt") is a little hard to take.
The real saving grace here, though, isn't
Weezer's pleasingly brain-dead "Susanne" or
the Archers of Loaf's quirky and solid "Web
in Front." "Mallrats" thankfully serves up 11
snippets of priceless dialogue from the film.
Commentary on the insufficiency of Lois
Lane's uterus lies beside a gutter-low anec
dote about someone's autoerotically inspired
cousin named Walter. Jason Lee and Shannen
Doherty perform the undeniably hip duet,
"Post Coital Techno Boogie," and the 30
priceless seconds of Poherty-delivered sass
provide unforgettable phrasing for anyone
who has ever searched for a more emphatic
wav to say "I'm so over you." "If you think

that I'm going to suffer any more of your shit
with a smile now that we're broken up," Do
herty says, "you're in for some serious fuck
ing disappointment."
