# PRETENDERS
## The 						Isle of View 
### 
Another live acoustic album. And just like
all the other "unplugged" albums, the Pre
tenders' latest offering, titled "The Isle of
View," is just another ploy to milk money
from the gullible masses. Usually, the Pre
tenders achieve (he perfect balance between
harmonious melodies and solid electric
rock, but here, their music is just as palatable
as the most watered-down beer you can find.

On this new album, their traditional sot
up of electric guitars is replaced by an all -
acoustic arrangement backed by the lamed
Duke Quartet. In their softer experimenta
tion, the Pretenders fail to transcend to
greater heights and find themselves treading
in music's no-man's land. By going acoustic,
the songs lack the dynamics and power found
on their previous albums. Classics such as
"Back on the Chain Gang" and "Brass in
Pocket" become sappy and impotent. Alter
hearing their listless rhythms and tame ac
companiments, 1 would think that this album
would be relegated to elevator music play lists.
Fortunately, Chrissie 1 lynde's ethereal and
timeless vocals still remain. Her spiritual
lyrics and the tinge of rebellion in her voice
successfully complement her extraordinary
singing range and resonance. Luckily, the un
obtrusive guitars and mellow string quartet
do nothing hut highlight the Pretenders'
strongest asset.
Also, unlike many live albums, where the
music is enshrouded by the rabid incanta
tions ol concert-goers, the sound on this
album is amazingly clear. It it weren't for the
civilized clapping after each song, I would
have guessed that this album was performed
in a studio.
from Chrissie Hynde's guest appearance
on an episode ol "I riends" to her group's per
formance on "1 he I ate Show With David Let
terman," the Pretenders are becoming an
übiquitous icon in modern rock, but they are
in jeopardy of losing new listeners with this
mediocre new album. It was a mistake tor the
Pretenders to stray from their traditional
blend of electric ba-s, drums, guitar and
Hynde's punctuating vocals. Nobody likes
watered-down beer, skip this light version ol
the Pretenders. C.o for the original and listen
to the genuine classics from the Pretenders
old albums.
