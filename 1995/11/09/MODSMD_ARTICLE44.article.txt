## Me Hungry 
### 
To sonic extent, members ol Louisville's
Kong have alwa\s been in a world ot
their own, but never has it been painted so

vividly as on their ambitious new concept
album, "Me Hungry." A project as daring
and as unique as anything put nut this year,
"Me 1 lungry" relates the story of a troubled
caveman and the trials of prehistoric life,
told both by a clear-voiced narrator and by
the clumsy, grammarless interjections of
the caveman himself.
The berry-eating Cro-Magnon starts
out happily in love with his yak (with a
crow on its back), but the two soon meet
with such formidable obstacles as saber
toothed tigers, other women, beastie
bears, fro/en berry bushes and the coming
of the Ice Age. The plot is loaded with sur
prising twists and turns — including the
discoveries of meat-eating and weaponry
("It occurs to me / tree make tiger dead!")
and everything comes together to form
an extraordinary tale that's good-natured,
tragic and funny.
Of course, the expert musicianship of
this bunch (featuring two ex-members of
underground giants Slint) makes "Me 1 fun
grv" more than just an amusing story. King
Kong's organ-tinged, ia//v pop keeps things
lively and interesting while the smooth vo
cals of Amy Greenwood's narrator perfectly
complement Ethan Buckler's dopey cave
man.
I he romping "Beastie Bear' chronicles
an episode between the caveman and a
hungry bear with Buckler blurting, "Me
scared, me excited!" before finally killing
the animal, scowling, " lake that, piece of
shit beast Beastie bear, let me eat my
berries in peace!
With a similar charm, the innocent ode
to prehistoric bestiality, "To Love a Yak,"
bounces and sparkles with lines like "Me
want to nuzzle you forever, my love" and
the more detailed "To reach across the back
I love / and grab the horns upon your
head / to pull your horns until youi head
comes back / is to give love to a yak.
Other highlights include the heart
wrenching "Teardrop" and the edge-of vour
seat title track, but there'n really not a bad
song in the bunch. The whole trip whips up a
fascinating \ ibe and comic groove that make
it perfectly clear that this is the greatest cave
man concept album ever.
