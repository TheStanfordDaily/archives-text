## Fair Game 
### 
1 was willing to give her a chance. I really was. I threw aside all my preconceptions,
settled into m\ se.it surrounded by a c rowd of actie stricken pre teens who definite

ly were not 1 / years-old and sat myself down ready to enjoy the film.
I he opening title sequence was hopeful, showing her running v\ itli the hacklit orange sun
set, gently swaying under her sports bra. Anticipation built 111 flic audience, everyone hanging
on the edge of their seats in eager expectation for her first line. I lie answer is no. She can't act.
I veil with the help of a dialogue coach and vocal consultant, ( uub ( raw ford (whatever
the hell her character name was) manages to deliver her lines with about as much flatness as
people thought the earth had before Columbus.
I he plot of "I air (lame," which is actualh based on a book In Paula (iosling, takes back seat
... *U . 1.. / ' U . .

to the large urisnam-esque
hase which consumes the film.
Basically, a bunch of British ac
cented Russian ex KCiB agents
who are now freelancing elec
tronic terrorists have lex
I uthor's version of the World
Wide Web to probe into the
world's computer information
banks. They're chasing Cindy
because she's a civil lawyer try
ing to repossess a boat which
they are secretly using as an
electronic surveillance base.
William Baldwin (once
again, you don't really care
wh.it hischaracter was called) is
a cop who gets caught up in the
intrigue and comes to ( inch 's
aid. No matter how hard he
fries, Baldwin is unable to draw
any emotion out of his brown
spotted co-star, ( inch's about
as afraid of the Russian mob as
she is of her mascara running.
1 know what you want to
know. Do they hook up? Yes.
Is there nudity? Yes. Mow
much? A shot of Cindy's
breasts from the side, and a si I
houetted shot of Baldwins
posterior for a lew seconds
along with Cindy's breasts
during the blue-light- fop
C lun-imitating love scene.
But is it all worth it? I or my
pre teen neighbors 111 the audi
ence, maybe, lor Baldwin?
Could be. l or C nuly? I'd rather
be stuck in mypre-"l air( lame"
fantasy of her on MTV's 1 louse
of Style. I.veil though her shirts
get shorter and tighter as the
movie goes on, I've heard her
workout video is far more inter
esting and definitely less costly.
Knough beautiful women in the
world actually can act.
