# Home for the Holidays
## 
### 
"Home lor Ihe Holi
I days is a lot like Thanks
giving dinner. It has

turkeys, it bombards you with a lot of people and a lot of
emotions, everybody in it eats excessively, it has a crazy
aunt, some of it could be better, but at the end of it all,
you're definitely satisfied.
The plot centers on Holly Hunter as Claudia, a recent-

ly fired art restorer
whose teenage
daughter has just an
nounced her inten
tions to start having
sex. Claudia goes
home to her eccen
tric family for
Thanksgiving only to
be more harried by
her family than she
was by losing her job.
Her chain-smoking,
chatterbox mother
forces her to wear a
gigantic pink coat
(fhe image of the
diminutive Hunter
dwarfed by this hor
rid [Milk thing is ab
solutelv hysterical),
her father plavs the

organ incessantly, her
/any brother snaps pho
tos while she's in the

shower, and the turkey ends up flying across the table.
And that's only the beginning.
The combination of Jodie foster — here in her sec
ond outing as director — and an absolutely fantastic cast
is what enables this movie to walk the very fine line be
tween sentimentality and outright cheese with the suc
cess that it does. And paired with W.D. Richter's finely
wrought screenplay, "Home For The Holidays" manages
to be super funny and make tun of its characters while
still showing great affection for them.
The cast is great. Anne Bancroft is perfect as the com
plaining, overbearing, vet devoted mom. Charles Durn

ing is fabulous as the storv-telling father whose idea ot
saying grace runs along the lines of thanking God for "old
fashioned, pain in-the-ass traditions like Thanksgiving,
which really mean something to us, although, god
dammit, we couldn't tell you what that is." (ieraldine
Chaplin is sweetly pathetic in her role as the slightly loony
Aunt Cilady. Robert Downey |r. is hysterical as wacky
brothel Tommv. whose homosexuality is dealt with hon-

estly hut isn t over
stressed. Dylan Mc-
Dermott finally gets
to play an interesting
character in a main
stream movie as lust
hoy Leo l ish. Hunter
is the thread holding
it all together — she's
never been more en
dearing,
j The only
problems lie with
I Cynthia Stevenson
and Steve Ciuttenherg
(I know, I couldn't
believe it either) as
Claudia's whiny, con
servative and gloomy
sister Joanne and her
husband. Thev mope
around, bitch a lot
and they're evil to
Tommy. I personally
was tilad when loanne

got turkey grease dumped on her head.
The movie's main flaw is that it tries to do too much. It
is hard to balance out the side-splitting funny parts with
the cheesy family misty-eye parts. The ending, a montage
of the characters as they are now and as they were when
younger, seems a hit of a sell -out, too ham-handed after
such subtlety throughout the rest of the movie.
but never mind all that. Even the more maudlin
scenes arc sweet, and once you're on the plane back
home, you're pretty glad you ate Aunt Gladys lime jello
with mini-marshmallows and M&Ms.
