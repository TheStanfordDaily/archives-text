Is there something lethal in each of us? What would happen it

from director Abel Ferrara ("The Bad Lieutenant"), this
is a film junkie's consummate fix. ferrara gives us the inside

anatomy <>t evil incarnate, nut this is not your typical horror tare. As herrara says in a press
release introduction, "1 never thought ol it as a vampire movie. I related to the addiction that
we all share our own fascination with evil and violence. It seems to run through our
blood.
shot in black and white, the film makes New York appear starker than it's ever been. Blood has
never seemed to run more viciously. The filming adds complex dimensions that color would

have obscured. Kathy's shadow
looms large as she stands over her
first victim, injects a syringe and
shoots up blood. It's not long be
tore the lead character, played by
I ily Taylor ("Short Cuts,' "Say
Anything"), becomes more cava
lier and a mini-colony of vampires
flourishes thanks to her efforts.
She preys among academia:
professors, colleagues and stu
dents studying in her favorite
graveyard — library stacks. Her
role as a seductress is more pro
nounced as she coyly flirts, draws
trust and then executes her thirst
for blood with chilling
vengeance. Taylor steals this film
hands-down. Her internal revo
lution from cynical but kind
NYU doctoral philosophy candi
date to a no-mercy killer keeps
you wanting more.
Cameos complete the film.
Christopher Walken's Peina, an
other vampire, takes tough love to
a new level as a vampire in rehab.
Annabella Sciorra's Casanova,
Kathy's maker, goes against her
typical role and displays an unusu
al streak of cruelty and violence.
In a fitting and ironic end,
Kathy invites her professors to a
reception commemorating her
Ph.D. and makes it an all-you
can-eat bloodfest with them as
the main course.
Gorged, Kathy hits bottom. She
realizes her appetite is insatiable
and that feeding the habit is the
only relief in sight. Nevertheless,
she knows it has to stop. Problem
is, you don't want the film to stop
because you're hooked.
Like her, try to "look sin in the
face and tell it to go away."
Chances are, you won't be able to
tear your eyes away from this one.
