"Powder" equals crap. Convicted
pedophile director Victor Salva

serves this offensively ridiculous story about
the persecution of one poor young man who's
just a little different than everyone else (he's
pure white — like a piece of chalk — and has
purple eyes).
Mary Steenburgen ("Philadelphia," "Par
enthood") plays Jessie Caldwell, the one per
son who can instantly see past Powder's skin
color and witness his inner beauty. She has all
these emotional, "Can't you see that deep
down inside he's just a scared little boy" mo
ments.
Powder, played by Sean Patrick Flannery
("The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"), is

dull to watch because the actor plays "all I re
ally want is to be left alone and allowed to go
home." Jeff Goldblum ("Jurassic Park") plays
schoolteacher Donald Ripley who is enam
ored by Powder's powers of electrical conduc
tivity and superior intellect.
Powder became the way he is because his
mother was struck by lightning moments be
fore he was born. He somehow saw this hap
pen from inside the womb and also talks of re
membering the worst day of his life — the day
he was born and his father denied that the pale
white thing was his son. Powder remembers
his birth. And somehow, the day he
he understood English, as if the English lan
guage is divinely inspired.
The film hinges on our belief that the nasty
people in this small town in Texas have noth

ing more important to do than point guns at
Powder and call him a faggot. Sympathy to
wards Powder over being called a faggot only
exists when one thinks "the poor boy is nor
mal ... he couldn't really be gay."
It's almost impossible to forget Salva's
questionable history while watching this
film, especially while watching the scene
where Powder and Goldblum sit alone in a
dark room. Powder says people are afraid to
touch him so Goldblum caresses his face.
Then Powder's eyes roll to the back of his
head and he cries tears of joy as Goldblum
feels his bald head. While Goldblum was giv
ing Powder head, audience members
moaned and groaned, and some even got up
and left.
"Powder" has all these trite little themes

and statements about racial tension. The film's
depiction of prejudice is disgustingly simple
and blatant. Someone actually says,"I never
thought we'd find the man who was too white
for even you."
And when all is said and done, Powder is
still white. There is something funny about the
miracle boy being as pure white as possible. If
they were serious about the motif, they would
have hired a genuine albino actor, rather than
painting Scan Patrick Flannery's skin white.
This film's creators are guilty of the ignorance
which they condemn.
This film isn't even a rental. This is a 4-
a.m.-on-a-Sunday-night-when-you're-too
weak-to-push-the-remote-control-button-
to-change-the-channel movie.
