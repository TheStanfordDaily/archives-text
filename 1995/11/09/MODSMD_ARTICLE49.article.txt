gy rejuvenates an older peer's career.
"Total Eclipse" succeeds in "Amadeus " like
form, ll begins and ends with the future, as the
rest of the film is flashback. The passionate
real-life story of 19th-century French poets
Arlhui Rimbaud (Leonard DiCaprio) and
Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis) is directed by
Agnieszka 1 lolland ("Furopa, Huropa," "Olivi
er, Olivier"). The film draws the audience in
with its superb acting, beautiful art direction
and stirring score (composed by Jan Kacz
marek).
But this film adds a new twist to the
Mozart-like plot. After reading his poems and
inviting the young artist to Paris, Verlaine
finds himself seduced by Rimbaud's passion
and artistic integrity. Holland's intelligent di
rection pulls the audience into the touching
relationship that develops into a passionate
love affair between Rimbaud and Verlaine.
(The fairly graphic sexual scenes are tastefully
done.) This relationship tears Verlaine away
from his beautiful, rich wife Mathilde, played
by French actress Romane Bohringer.
Rimbaud teaches Verlaine to open up as an

artist and liberate himself from the bounds of
lyric poetry that constrain him. Rimbaud's vin
dictiveness against the bourgeois society of the
times and his desire to live freely are beautifully
depicted by Holland, especially the apocalyptic
dream sequence that haunts him.
The couple's exploration of the French
countryside and their roaming life in London
and across Europe tear them apart as much as

bring them together. The violent scenes be
tween them are masterfully painful for the au
dience as well.
DiCaprio not only looks the part, but
brings out Rimbaud's passion and search tor
knowledge with existential perfection. Thewlis
too makes his Verlaine a simpering, indecisive
poet caught in a new age so real that, by the end
of the film, one feels real disgust for him.

The cinematography is stunning. The
scene where Rimbaud, after returning from
Africa, leaves home moves one to tears by its
perfect aesthetic composition.
Unlike many recent foreign artsy flicks,
"Total Hclipse" portrays a real story in lumi
nous cinematic form.
