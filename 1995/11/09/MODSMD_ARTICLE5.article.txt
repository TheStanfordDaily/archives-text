Don't mess with Texas.
After till, what other state
boasts Ann Richards, Ross
Perot and J.R. Ewing? Where
else do bumper stickers read, "I
wasn't horn here, but I got here
<ls fast as I could?" And, frankly,
what ot her continental state has
a club promoting it on Stan
ford's campus?
The Stanford Texas Club is a
new organization devoted to cel
ebrating all things Texan. Ap
parently, even the Lone Star
State's 267,339 square miles
can't contain the fierce pride of
its residents.
Grace Wang, a junior and
founder of the club, decided to
start the club last year with a fel
low Texan, junior David Wolitz,
who is now in Berlin. They
planned the club as a way of
meeting people and sharing en
thusiasm for the second-largest
state in the nation.
