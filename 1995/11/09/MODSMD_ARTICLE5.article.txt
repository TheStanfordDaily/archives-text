# Lone Star Stanford
## Yellow roses, BBQ make for one big campus group 
### Dee Ann Durbin 
Don't mess with Texas.
After till, what other state
boasts Ann Richards, Ross
Perot and J.R. Ewing? Where
else do bumper stickers read, "I
wasn't horn here, but I got here
<ls fast as I could?" And, frankly,
what ot her continental state has
a club promoting it on Stan
ford's campus?
The Stanford Texas Club is a
new organization devoted to cel
ebrating all things Texan. Ap
parently, even the Lone Star
State's 267,339 square miles
can't contain the fierce pride of
its residents.
Grace Wang, a junior and
founder of the club, decided to
start the club last year with a fel
low Texan, junior David Wolitz,
who is now in Berlin. They
planned the club as a way of
meeting people and sharing en
thusiasm for the second-largest
state in the nation.

Members of the Stanford Texas Club show their true colors.
"Texas has an aura that I want
ed to tap into," said Wang, a native
of San Antonio. "It has stories,
rich cultural history, legends."
Wang admitted that the aura is
part mythology, steeped in cow
hoys, the Alamo and rough fron
tiers. But building up that myth is
part of the fun, she said.
"The Alamo, Texas rangers,
cattle drives, Pace commercials —
so many images come to mind
when you think of Texas," she
said. "And whatever it is, it
works."
The first meeting of the club
drew 40 people — some of whom
arrived with Texas flags, cowboy
hats and boots in tow. Also includ
ed was at least one Texophile.
"Why did I come?" asked junior
Jennifer Yu. The club's lone repre
sentative from Massachusetts, Yu
is a former roommate of Wang's. "I
lived for a year in this room with a
big Texas flag on the ceiling."
Wang was pleased with the
turnout and with the diversity of
the interested students.
"Even seniors and grad stu
dents came," said Wang. "They
dun't come to anything."
Still, she said she hopes more
students will join — the bigger the
better, as any Texan knows.

For now, the group is planning
a number of events, including an
end-of-the-year barbecue blowout
and a Dallas Cowboys party on
Nov. 12. Wang also hopes the
group will sponsor a speaker from
Texas and will help the Admis
sions Office recruit new Texans.
"New clubs are hard to start
because your enthusiasm always
has to be high," Wang said. Lucki
ly, her task has been made easier
by the club's members, who live
up to Texas' reputation for enthu
siasm and friendliness.
"The idea that it's a friendly
state is not just an idea," Wang
said.
Club member Anna Rowland, a
sophomore, agreed.
"You'll be driving down the
street, and some complete
stranger will wave to you," Row
land said.
All the Texans at the meeting
agreed that friendliness was one of
their state's greatest assets. Food
was another.
"Friendliness is the most
important. Then food," said Deb
bie Rowland, a junior.
"Cal-Mex is just not Tex-Mex,"
Wang said. "I mean, chicken and
scallop fajitas? What's that?"
Before long, a discussion of food
in a room full of Texans inevitably
leads to the supremacy of the
Texas barbecue.
"The difference is the quality of
meat and the sauce," said Travis

Bowie, a freshman who used to
work at a Texas barbecue. "People
wearing cowboy hats and cowboy
boots also make it a Texas barbe
cue." For good measure, Bowie
sported a pair of black cowboy
boots.
Wang also sang the praises of
Texas barbecue. Her favorite
joint in high school was Rudy's, a
shack near her school which
served huge portions of meat on
wax paper. On the side were a few
slices of bread.
Besides food, Wang has noticed
a few other major differences
between Texas and California.
"Parallel parking is a foreign
concept to me," she said. "We have
big miles of parking in Texas, huge
lots."
On the positive side, she admit
ted that the weather in California
is much better — cooler and less
humid — and pay is higher.
Still, there is a longing for
Texas in these club members'
hearts.
"Texas gets a bad rap some
times," said Rowland. "There are
lots of jokes, and people make fun
of the language."
For her, the club helps counter
some of this.
"Being far away, it's nice to
know that there's people you have
things in common with," she said.
Thanks to Wang, the stars at
night are big and bright, deep in
the heart of.. . Stanford.

dun't come to anything."
Still, she said she hopes more
students will join — the bigger the
better, as any Texan knows.

For now, the group is planning
a number of events, including an
end-of-the-year barbecue blowout
and a Dallas Cowboys party on
Nov. 12. Wang also hopes the
group will sponsor a speaker from
Texas and will help the Admis
sions Office recruit new Texans.
"New clubs are hard to start
because your enthusiasm always
has to be high," Wang said. Lucki
ly, her task has been made easier
by the club's members, who live
up to Texas' reputation for enthu
siasm and friendliness.
"The idea that it's a friendly
state is not just an idea," Wang
said.
Club member Anna Rowland, a
sophomore, agreed.
"You'll be driving down the
street, and some complete
stranger will wave to you," Row
land said.
All the Texans at the meeting
agreed that friendliness was one of
their state's greatest assets. Food
was another.
"Friendliness is the most
important. Then food," said Deb
bie Rowland, a junior.
"Cal-Mex is just not Tex-Mex,"
Wang said. "I mean, chicken and
scallop fajitas? What's that?"
Before long, a discussion of food
in a room full of Texans inevitably
leads to the supremacy of the
Texas barbecue.
"The difference is the quality of
meat and the sauce," said Travis

Bowie, a freshman who used to
work at a Texas barbecue. "People
wearing cowboy hats and cowboy
boots also make it a Texas barbe
cue." For good measure, Bowie
sported a pair of black cowboy
boots.
Wang also sang the praises of
Texas barbecue. Her favorite
joint in high school was Rudy's, a
shack near her school which
served huge portions of meat on
wax paper. On the side were a few
slices of bread.
Besides food, Wang has noticed
a few other major differences
between Texas and California.
"Parallel parking is a foreign
concept to me," she said. "We have
big miles of parking in Texas, huge
lots."
On the positive side, she admit
ted that the weather in California
is much better — cooler and less
humid — and pay is higher.
Still, there is a longing for
Texas in these club members'
hearts.
"Texas gets a bad rap some
times," said Rowland. "There are
lots of jokes, and people make fun
of the language."
For her, the club helps counter
some of this.
"Being far away, it's nice to
know that there's people you have
things in common with," she said.
Thanks to Wang, the stars at
night are big and bright, deep in
the heart of.. . Stanford.
