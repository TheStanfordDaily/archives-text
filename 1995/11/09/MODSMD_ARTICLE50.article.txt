## The
						imminent death of reading 
### Sean McMeekin 
Sven Birkerts is no
fan of computers.
Discussing his new
book, " The (iutcn
berg Elegies: the
l ate of Reading in
an Electronic Age,"
recently in Moun
tain View, Birkerts
spoke of entering
"enemy territory."

For him, Silicon Valley is the enemy capital of
The Reading Wars. Against the media bar
rage of advertisers, business and Wall .Street
leaders, pundits and politicians all smitten
with the "information revolution Birk
erts wishes to submit a dissenting vote. The
elegant essays of "The Gutenberg Elegies
form a cry of anguish for a reading culture he
believes to be in its death throes.
What troubles Birkerts is not simply the
comparative devaluation of books engen
dercd by the growing influence of computers.
Rather, what is at stak* ;s an entire culture of
reading, in which our spiritual lives are cult,
vated and nourished by the printed word.
The encroachment of information technolo
gies into our lives television, answering
machines, modems, computer networks
has, Birkerts believes, altered the "funda
mental transactions of existence." Techno
logical advancement has allowed us to con
quer the "constraints of presence" at the cost
of the loss of presence. Our relation to space
and time — to geographic place and com
munity, to the narratives of shared history

and memory — has been irrevocably altered.
Most of all, the erosion of private reading as a
force in our lives has transformed our rela
tion to language itself.
For Birkerts, this is the heart of the matter:
language, and not technology, is the "true
evolutionary miracle of humankind. It is
through language that we attempt to forge
meaning in our lives, fashioning narratives
about ourselves and our orientation on the
"space-time axis" of the cosmos. We arc
uniquely human because we seek meaning
through language. If language is impover
ished, we begin to lose that which makes us
human. And language is being impover
ished, according to Birkerts, as printed words
are replaced by electronic ones.
The Reading Wars are not about whether
or not we will read. They are about how we
will read. For Birkerts, words are not stable
entities, infinitely transmittable as data. They
are infinitely shaped by the medium in which
they are communicated: in pre-literacy oral
storytelling; etched permanently in stone;
printed on a book weathered with age;
ephcmerally visible on a computer screen. In
cyberspace, words are but data, transmitted
through the unfeeling circuitry of electronic
networks. They come to us out of nowhere
and exit again to nowhere, bound by neither
time nor place.
Birkerts is convinced that language is
being "flattened." We no longer experience
words; we "process" them. Words easily com
posed and erased are devoid o( permanence
and invested with little spiritual meaning.

They draw us in to the screen, the spectacle,
but do not send us "into the self." Though we
have ever more information at our disposal,
we are increasingly uninterested in "wis
dom"— "the knowing not of facts but of
truths about human nature and the process
es of life." Saturated with mediating tech
nologies, Birkerts writes, "we tend to act em
barrassed around those once-freighted terms
— truth, meaning, soul, destiny." We have lit
tle time for serious reading because we are
becoming disinclined towards its values: pa
tience, inwardness, mental passion.
Birkerts' essays on the dying experience of
reading are personal and deeply passionate.
1 le explores with remarkable clarity the mys
tery of the reading process: the way we turn
symbols on a page into whole worlds; the way
good Fiction sends us "into the self," into
frenzied contemplation of our own lives even
as we experience the author's narrative; the
way serious reading "decelerates" us and
transforms our relation to the world. This is
what Birkerts calls deep or "duration" time,
in which time ceases to be a "deviceable enti
ty.' It is here, feeling the "slow, grainy move
ment of time passing," that we approach
most closely the mystery of existence.
But fewer and fewer of us spend time
doing this. As evidence of the imminent
death of reading, Birkerts draws our atten
tion to the cultural wars fought over univer
sity curricula. His interpretation is simple:
people fight over scarce resources. The sup
ply of serious readers is dwindling, so con
tending factions battle to access them. CIV

esque reading lists matter because they con
stitute some of the only serious reading most
of us will do in our lives. "The cry for multi
cultural representation," Birkerts writes, may
be "a last-ditch bid for connection to the fad
ing legacy of print."
Martin Heidegger called technology the
"forgetting of being." Birkerts fears that the
ever-expanding electronic web will finish the
job. Already, the information revolution has
its victims: dehumanized "selves" are break
ing down under the strain, going in for "re
pairs" in staggering numbers to the therapist's
office or with Prozac. Birkerts' nightmare vi
sion is .1 world of Orwell ian efficiency, popu
lated by "efficient and prosperous informa
tion managers living in the shallows of what it
means to be human and not knowing the dif
ference." Stripped of the taste for individuali
ty, we arc inexorably pulled into the tribal
newsgroups and chat rooms of the electronic
hive, where one day we will be "piled together
like transparent wafers in cyberspace."
If this doom-and-gloom scenario sounds
extreme, it is meant to. Birkerts is not aiming
for balance. He is playing David to the Go
liath of the Internet's legions. If he doesn't ex
pect "refuseniks" to follow him, he wishes
nonetheless to illustrate what we are losing as
we move from a print culture to an electron
ic one. Whether or not we share his appre
hensions about the future of reading, the
pained eloquence of "The Gutenberg Ele
gies" may force us to confront the question
no one seems to be asking about the elec
tronic future — just where are we going?
