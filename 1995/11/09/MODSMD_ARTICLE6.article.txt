# Candidate calls for end of lawsuit binge
## Frivolous action drains taxpayers, alum says 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
Stanford alumnus Patrick Shan
non discussed "frivolous lawsuits"
and the problems they are causing
the California civil court system in a
small, informal discussion last night
in Building3oo.
"Today, many people see the sys
tem as a way to rake in a jackpot, not
to serve justice," said the 31-year-old
Shannon.
The talk, entitled "The Lawsuit
Plague: A Perspective on Legal Re
form," was sponsored by the Stan
ford College Republicans and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Shannon is running as a Republi
can for the State Assembly seat in
the 21st District, which includes
Stanford.
Ix'gal reform is badly needed,
Shannon said, because of the "unbe
lievable drain" lx>ing placed on tax
payers as a result of frivolous law
suits. These suits have resulted in
what he called a "lawsuit tax" on
many items He said that, for exam
ple, 90 percent of the cost of a child's

vaccination and 50 percent of the
cost of a football helmet results from
costs attributable to frivolous law
suits.
Shannon said that previous ef
forts for reform were stymied largely
by efforts of the California Trial
Lawyers Association, which, Shan
non said, contributed $7.5 million to
legislature candidates Ix-tween 1990
and 1994.
Shannon, Gov. Pete Wilson's
Bay Area policy director, is the au
thor of Wilson's legal reform pack
age. He said the package seeks to
eliminate many of the "arbitrary
and unpredictable result" in the
California civil court system.
Punitive damages is one of the
three areas targeted in the reform
package.
"Runaway punitive damages are
the biggest problem in the civil
courts," Shannon said, citing the ab
sence of concrete standards for
awarding punitive damages.
The reform package, if passed,
would limit punitive awards to
three times the amount of the orig
inal judgment. The hill also would
have judges, not juries, decide how
much to award in punitive dam
ages
A second area of targeted reform
concerns product liability lawsuits.
The reform package would protect
the manufacturer from liability for
"unknowable risks" in products.
An "unknowable risk" is defined as
a risk that cannot be detected even
with "state-of-the-art" technology.
Currently, manufacturers are held
responsible for these risks, Shan
non said.
The third area of proposed
reform would eliminate many
wrongful termination lawsuits by
upholding written "at-will"
employment contracts, which allow
employers or employees to termi
nate employment, at any time with

out reason.
"In the last 20 years, judges
have carved out numerous excep
tions" to at-will agreements, Shan
non said. As an example, he cited
rulings on "implied contracts," in
which at-will agreements are over
ridden because of the duration of
employment.
Shannon also discussed legal
reforms being attempted through
public initiatives. He spoke favor
ably of three notable initiatives
that will be placed on the March
199(> ballot concerning volatile
stock suits, no-fault auto insurance
and limits on lawyer contingency
fees.
"The prospects for (these initia
tives) passing are really good," he
said.
Shannon graduated from Stan
ford in 1986 with a bachelor's in
political science. He received a mas
ter's in international relations from
the Ixmdon School of Economics in
1987 ;uid graduated from Boalt
Hall, the law school at UC-Berkeley.
