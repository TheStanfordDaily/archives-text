# Core unveiled
## New tracks could appeal to fuzzies 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The three tracks in the proposed Math
ematics-Science-Engineering Core were
unveiled at the Faculty Senate yesterday,
covering the physical history und future of
Earth, the human heart and the qualities
and uses of light.
Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood, who

chaired the committee that created the sci
ence core, said the new curriculum will en
courage non-technical students to pursue
study in the sciences, math and engineer
ing. Osgood said he thought that many
students "will find something like this in
teresting and appealing."
The core will be offered beginning in
the fall of 1996. Last year, the sen
ate voted to create the optional
three-quarter series of classes,
which will integrate physical sci
ence, math and engineering and
fulfill the distribution require
ments in all three areas. Current
ly, the committee is in the process
of finalizing the specifics of the
courses.
The tracks have no formal
names yet. Osgood referred to the
professors involved in creating
the respective tracks as the
"Earthlings," the "Heartbreak
ers" and the "llluminati."
According to the preliminary
proposal, the "Earthlings' " class
will focus on four themes — glob
al change, the origin and evolution
of life on earth, living with natural
hazards and earth resources and
the sustainability of life. Possible
topics of exploration could be plate
tectonics, the extinction of species
and impacts of future population
growth.
The class may also include
field trips to such sites as Mount
Lassen and to the San Andreas
Fault at Hollister to collect sam
ples which would be later ana
lyzed in laboratories, according to
the proposal.
The class will be taught by
Petroleum Engineering Prof.
Martin Blunt, Geological and
Environmental Sciences Prof.
Don Lowe, Geophysics Prof.
Mark Zoback and Biology Prof.
Gretchen Daily.
The "Heartbreakers" class will

study the workings, function,
development and failure of the
human heart, according to the
preliminary proposal.
Students in this class may be
asked to measure heart functions,
blood pressure and biochemical
assays of blood clotting, as well as
perform ultrasounds and perhaps
magnetic resonance imaging, the
proposal said. Mathematics will
be introduced in conjunction with
the scientific concepts.
Genetics Profs. David Cox,
David Botstein and Rick Myers,
Statistics Prof. David Siegmund
and Physics Prof. Charles Marcus
will teach the class.
The nature, sources and appli
cations of light, including mirrors,
cameras and optics, will be the
subject of the "llluminati" class,
said the preliminary proposal.
Possible lectures may include
discussions of color perception,
binocular vision, optical correc
tion devices and the human eye.
These will be supplemented by
demonstrations of traveling
waves, rainbows and additive
color mixing, the proposal said.
The class will be taught by Pat
Burchat, professor of physics;
Russell Fernald, professor of psy
chology; Sharon Long, an investi
gator in biological sciences at the
Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute; and Osgood.
At the meeting, Osgood pre
sented new statistics demonstrat
ing the need for the Science Core.
According to an analysis of 350
graduating seniors' transcripts in
the four largest non-technical
majors — economics, English,
international relations and politi
cal science — few take rigorous

classes to fulfill their technical
distribution requirements. If eco
nomics majors are subtracted, the
number declines even more.
Osgood admitted that the
statistics may be somewhat mis
leading since they do not include
transfer credit used to fulfill dis
tribution requirements.
Even though the new core will
not be required, Osgood said he
thought that students would
choose to take it, but stressed the
need for good advising to make
students aware of this option.
Osgood also expressed excite
ment about the process of creat
ing the classes, noting the diversi
ty of opinions which resulted
from the collaboration across dis
ciplines.
"We went down the list of pos
sible topics, labs and demonstra
tions and how they would be pre
sented," Osgood said. "For all
topics, Fernald had a different
way of looking at things. The
same thing happened when Long
went down the list."
The teams of professors will
continue to refine the proposals
throughout the year, Osgood said.
"The next step is to continue
the discussions by the teams and
to get a sense of what the budgets
are," Osgood said. "All teams will
meet often."
The new core developed after
the report of the Committee on
Undergraduate Education called
for the improvement of science
education at Stanford. The recom
mendation stemmed from a per
ception that humanities and social
science majors were taking less
rigorous science classes to fulfill
their distribution requirements.

the four largest non-technical
majors — economics, English,
international relations and politi
cal science — few take rigorous

classes to fulfill their technical
distribution requirements. If eco
nomics majors are subtracted, the
number declines even more.
Osgood admitted that the
statistics may be somewhat mis
leading since they do not include
transfer credit used to fulfill dis
tribution requirements.
Even though the new core will
not be required, Osgood said he
thought that students would
choose to take it, but stressed the
need for good advising to make
students aware of this option.
Osgood also expressed excite
ment about the process of creat
ing the classes, noting the diversi
ty of opinions which resulted
from the collaboration across dis
ciplines.
"We went down the list of pos
sible topics, labs and demonstra
tions and how they would be pre
sented," Osgood said. "For all
topics, Fernald had a different
way of looking at things. The
same thing happened when Long
went down the list."
The teams of professors will
continue to refine the proposals
throughout the year, Osgood said.
"The next step is to continue
the discussions by the teams and
to get a sense of what the budgets
are," Osgood said. "All teams will
meet often."
The new core developed after
the report of the Committee on
Undergraduate Education called
for the improvement of science
education at Stanford. The recom
mendation stemmed from a per
ception that humanities and social
science majors were taking less
rigorous science classes to fulfill
their distribution requirements.
