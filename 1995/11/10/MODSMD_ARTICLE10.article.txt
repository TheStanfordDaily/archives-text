# Budget faces certain Clinton veto
## Government will default on loans if stalemate continues 
### 
WASHINGTON <AP)
With a potential federal
default and government shut
down at stake, Congress toiled
over a pair of budget bills yes
terday and lurched ever closer
to a jolting veto showdown
with President Clinton.
A day after the House
approved legislation that
would provide stopgap funds
for government agencies
through Dec. 1, the Senate
adopted the measure by 50-
46 after softening House
approved reins on lobbying
by many federally aided pri
vate groups.
The House voted 227-194
for another bill extending

federal borrowing authority
through Dec. 12. Capping a
marathon day, the Senate
approved that measure by
49-47, and shipped it back to
the House after voting by
voice to remove language
killing the Commerce
Department.
The House was expected to
accept the Senate version of
both measures and ship them
to the White House on Friday.
Administration officials
pledged that both bills
would meet vetoes at the
White House because of
unacceptable provisions,
even though the govern
ment's abilities to borrow

and spend lapse next week.
That declaration prompt
ed furious rhetoric from both
sides that almost overshad
owed the day's legislative
work.
White House spokesman
Mike McCurry said that
thanks to Republican intran
sigence, "default is increas
ingly likely." Bond prices
drooped slightly. He added
that "there are no chances at
this point" to avoid federal
agencies from having to halt
some of their work next week.
Leon Panetta, the White
House chief of staff, likened
the Republican strategy to
putting "a gun to the head of

the president," adding, "That's
a form of terrorism. We are not
going to accept that."
"If he's not willing to
cooperate to pass a balanced
budget, then the choice will
be his," said Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. "If
the government shuts down,
his fingerprints are going to
be all over it."
House Speaker Newt Gin
grich, R-Ga., accused the
administration of waging "a
failed attempt to frighten the
bond market." He said Clin
ton was playing "destructive
political games at the expense
of the American people and at
the expense of our children."
