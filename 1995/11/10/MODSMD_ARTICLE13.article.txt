## Editorial What's the ASSU? 
### 
Student government
must increase efforts
to reach community

WHAT DOES THE govern
ment of the Associated
Students of Stanford Uni
versity do? What's an ASSU Sena
tor (besides someone who can be
seen wearing a silly sweatshirt
every week, even on scorching hot
Tuesdays)? Most Stanford students
probably don't know the answer to
these questions.
About a year ago, after extensive
surveys about and analysis of the
ASSU, Cardinal Consulting, an
independent consulting group,
reported that many students not
only felt that the ASSU govern
ment did not effectively represent
their interests, but that they also
didn't really have a clear under
standing what that government
was for.
Clearly there has been a commu
nication breakdown, a problem with
the distribution and access of infor
mation. Our student government
needs to focus on repairing this
breakdown by keeping its con
stituency better informed. This task
will be difficult because it involves
the ASSU student government not
only explaining to students what
they are doing, but also what they
can do and why they exist.
Making the day-to-day running
and processes of the senate and
Council of Presidents accessible
should be a main priority of our
student representatives. The sen
ate has a beautiful World Wide Web
page, a good first step, but instead
of brimming with bills, agendas,
minutes and lively debate, it has
unfortunately remained empty all
year.
Many newly elected senators
may not have ever heard of Cardi
nal Consulting or its reported
results (intuitive as they may be),
or be able to relate a history of the

ASSU and its government. Because
classes turn over every few years,
those who finally gain valuable
experience and understanding
graduate, leaving a new uninitiated
generation behind to re-learn the
ropes.
Easily accessible records would
not only help reduce such bouts of
institutional memory loss, they
would also allow future students
and representatives to study and
learn from the past. Have there
been projects or initiatives which
students have historically support
ed or rejected? There's no way for
an inquiring mind to know.
By increasing outreach, the sen
ate would cause students to pay
more attention to their government
and its deeds. Every year, candi
dates for student government make
a wide variety of promises. Eor
example, this year's Council of
Presidents promised to find outside
sponsors to keep home athletic
games free, to bring outside compe
tition and added services to Tresid
der and to deliver more effective
adviser training. Do incoming
freshmen know about these
promises made by their inherited
representatives? Has the senate
been working on these problems?
How far have they progressed?
How would someone who wanted
to know get answers? There needs
to be an easier way for anyone
who's interested to find out.
Students shouldn't have to
attend senate meetings or exercise
the Freedom of Information Act,
their representatives have a
responsibility to inform them, both
about their successes and their fail
ures. Institutional memory should
not be allowed to shroud past polit
ical promises — our student gov
ernment needs to be held account
able.
Creating a more useful Web page
would be a good start. Last spring,
the newly elected senate planned to
televise its meetings — another
good idea. For the system to be its
most productive, students must
remain vigilant and to do so they
need to be well-informed.
