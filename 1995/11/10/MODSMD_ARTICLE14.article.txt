Cherish and honor your friendly postman

THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY three
ways you can stamp and mail your
letter home — that is, if you are
still one of the lost generation of letter
writers. The first method is that you buy
your stamps in bulk ahead of time and
take care of it as you need. The second
method is through the machine: You put
your coins in and it spits out your
stamps — or you use the meter machine.
The third method is the long-lost art of
humanism: You stand in the line
patiently and await your turn. Then,
when you hear "next," you step up to
the counter where the postman says,
"How can I help you?" and you take care
of your letter with love.
I always opt for the third method. It's
actually a lost way of life which I was
reminded of three years ago by the nov
elist and president of the American
Humanism Association, Kurt Vonnegut
Jr. As he delivered his speech in Memo
rial Auditorium, he explained how,
against his wife's bulk-stamp method, he
would rather go through the entire
ordeal of walking down to his local post
office, standing in line, exchanging a
smile and a conversation while buying

his stamp, licking it, pasting it and
hand-delivering it to the postman / post
woman and then walking out completely
satisfied with the whole event.
I took Vonnegut's advice to heart and
gave it a shot. As cumbersome as it may
appear — especially to those of us gov
erned by the "tyranny of urgency" —
out of the three methods described, this
is the most humane of all: It brings life
into your life.
Lo and behold, I discovered that
behind every one of these counters lies a
person, a real human being, with a
name, a personality, a set of values, a
family and an entire world which beats
any machine of any kind.
Today, after three years of going to
the post office almost every day and
standing in the line and waiting, I have
come to learn a valuable lesson: Our
local post office is indeed the heart and
soul of our University — much more
than the central administration could
ever claim to be!
Located in White Plaza, next to the
Bookstore, our post office is full of life.
Apart from the fascinating faces stand
ing in line, you have the real people who

make it all happen. THEY ARE NOT
MACHINES. THEY ARE REAL
HUMAN BEINGS WITH HANDS AND
FEET, EYES AND EARS, HEART AND
SOUL, JUST LIKE US.
You have the always-smiling Ray,
who is married to Nora and has two
kids, George (15) and Valery (10); you
have the energetic, always-slicked-back
hair Steve, who is married to Vicky and
has two kids, Sierra (2) and Brenna (5);
you have Norvel or Hammond (depends
who you are), the big African-American
fellow who can give you a mini-lecture in
90 seconds on jazz or blues, or teach you
a thing or two about American history
much better than any of your professors
ever can; you have the elderly postmas
ter, Mr. Bill, with a semi-white goatee,
who is married to Alma and is a father
to Demetria (26), Katrina (22) and Akhi
la (14), as well as being a choir leader;
and then you have a dozen others who
work night and day to deliver your mail
to your mailboxes and doorsteps: Trang
(whom I've come to nickname Desde
mona — and I don't know why or how),
Gene, Jerry, Bob, Jim and a bunch of
other people whom I have yet to meet.

The point is this, folks: Open your
eyes and ears and you may actually dis
cover lots of life right in front of your
nose — right at your local post office!
Don't rush around so much. Nothing
can be more urgent than your birthday
gift in the mail and those who toil to get
it to you.
Next time, instead of putting coins in
that iron machine, stand in line, contem
plate or write a poem and when you hear
"next," step right up and buy your stamp
behind the counter. And when you get
there, remember: There's a human being
behind the counter and not a machine.
Have some manners. Have a heart.
Introduce yourself. Have a chat. Then,
after a few seconds of heart-warming,
take care of your important business.
You'll soon discover for yourself that
Vonnegut is right: It is well worth every
second of this ordeal and life is too sweet
to be wasted on machines. Stay human.
Love your postmen. And get both — a
spark and a stamp — from the postman
behind the counter!
