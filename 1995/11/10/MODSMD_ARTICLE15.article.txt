# Athletes shouldn't attend sporting events for free
## 
### 
An editorial in Wednesday's Daily
brought up the issue of waning ticket
sales to this year's Big Game and the
possible loss of up to $200,000.
I find it odd that the Athletics
Department is raising ticket prices for

students, when at the same time they
find the need to give away free home
game football tickets to a select group
of students on campus: varsity ath
letes.
These athletes get to waltz into foot
ball games through a special "Varsity
Athletes Only" gate. No line, no ticket
needed, just your name on the varsity
athlete roster.
Athletes are students first, not elite
representatives of the Athletics Depart
ment. To privilege them over other stu
dents is unjustifiable and divisive. Fur

thermore, in light of recent debts, this
policy may make poor business sense.
I suppose that the recent hike in the
price for Big Game tickets (from $'25 to
$35) represents an effort to make up
for some of the looming debt the Ath
letics Department faces. In other
words, in hard times, the Athletics
Department is asking for more support
from the students. Why doesn't the
Athletics Department ask for similar
support from the group that should be
its strongest advocate â€” varsity ath
letes? I resent the fact that the money

I spend to see athletic events may
make it possible for other students,
varsity athletes, to get in to these same
events for free.
As I don't see the justification for
this practice, I suggest that the Athlet
ics Department lower its ticket prices
to a level which it feels it can charge all
students, even its own athletes.
If this trend of favoritism and price
increasing continues, the only people in
the stands may be the varsity athletes.
