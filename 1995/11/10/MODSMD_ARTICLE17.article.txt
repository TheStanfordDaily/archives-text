## Revolt, Stanford style 
### 
u TX EY, DO YOU guys feel cheat-
I I ed? 'Cause, like, nothing
JL JLworks out and everything's
always going wrong and s—t?"
The second-rate band's introduction
— to the hit single, "Cheated," of
course — was admittedly lame in any
context, but it might have gone over
tolerably well in any second-rate San
Jose club, where perhaps the South Hay
skinheads could just try to forget the
awkward moment in a flurry of drunk
en dancing.
Hut, unfortunately for all involved,
the singer in this case was addressing a
Stanford fraternity party. And instead of
the rousing "Yeah!" called for, the soror
ity girls and freshmen present responded
with more of a collective whimper that
amounted to: "Well, sure, I suppose
sometimes we feel kind of unhappy about
stuff."
Ah, the rebellion of youths who have
been coerced into $100,000 educations!
What kind of Stanford-style riot was this
punk rocker trying to start?
"Yeah, I feel cheated, because some
times I have to wait like 15 minutes in
the ATM line!"
"Where do the cops get off telling me I
have to use a bike light?"
"The post office takes too long. I feel
cheated, too!"
"And food service just sucks, man!"
Stanford students have many ways of
rebelling against odious oppression and
the dc facto slavery system that compels
them to pay $1 re-shelving fees and pro

hibits the propping-open of doors. Pro
gressing on a scale from mild malaise to
outright sedition, here are the most
important signals by which Stanford stu
dents indicate that revolution is perilous
ly nigh:
Hanging out at the Co Ho
Although the Coffee House appears to
be little more than a tacky, tawdry imita
tion of, well, a coffee house, it is in reality
a seething cauldron of dissatisfaction.
Malicious malcontents can be heard
betraying their revolt-readiness when
they say, "Man, I'm always at the CofTee
House." One more spin of Marley's "Stir
It Up" and anarchy could ensue.
Abuse of legal drugs
Don't think those kids sitting there
smoking cigarettes are just going to keep
sitting there, smoking cigarettes. Sure,
their parents smoked, but not in the
same ominous manner.
"Later, I'm getting a double mocha,
and then the Man had better watch his
back!"
Abuse of illegal drugs
True militants, of course, move on to
true contraband. "I've been exploited all
week, but let's see what the establish
ment does when I get mad munchies and
eat all of their Captain Crunch!"
Skateboarding
Some students are so insurrection
minded that even their means of trans
portation are subversive. On the menace
meter, Stanford skate-rats are second
only to Cory Haim in "Prayer for the
Rollerboys."

Ridiculous hair
Nothing makes Big Brother tremble
like a guy with blue hair. Rock on, com
rade!
Earth systems
This concentration has been deemed
even more dangerous to the administra
tion than Modern Thought and Litera
ture because, with its lack of internal
coherence or consistency, it is a direct
attack on the idea of majors.
Co-ops
Revolt by residence elevates le resis
tance at Stanford to a lifestyle. Anyone
who lives in EBF by choice clearly poses
an immediate threat to conventional
western thought. By demanding poor
lighting and unclean bathrooms, co-op
contras symbolically reject the system's
oppressive notions of decency.
Proclaiming oneself "crazy"
Perhaps the most blatant fomenting of
anarchic violence is a student's own con
fession that he or she is in a treasonous
state of mind. Such open instability com
prises perhaps the most immediate
threat to the powers in place at Stanford.
"I have a paper due next week and I
haven't even started. I'm losin' it."
"Yeah, you are losin' it. But I drank so
much last night I was going insane."
"Man. vou are crazy."

You bet Josh Gohlkc has got something
personal against you.
