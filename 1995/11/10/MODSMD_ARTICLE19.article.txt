## Cardinal football heads north to tangle with Cougars Bowl hopes on the line as Stanford battles WSU and the elements in chilly showdown at Pullman 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
After a heartbreaker in South
ern California, the Stanford foot
ball team will face a drastically
different set of environmental
factors this weekend. The cold
temperatures, frigid precipitation
and blustery winds of Pullman,
Wash., will be a far cry from the
sun and smog of Los Angeles.
The Cardinal (5-3-1 overall, 3-
3 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
faces off against Washington
State (3-6, 2-4) at 3:30 Saturday
afternoon in a game that means a
great deal to Stanford head coach
Tyrone Willingham and his team.
A Cardinal loss ends virtually any
hopes of participating in a bowl
game, and Willingham knows it.
"When you're playing for
something — and we're playing
for something — each game defi
nitely gets bigger," he said. "This
one is huge as we look at it. We've
got to win this football game if we
want to play 12 games or even
have a chance to play 12."
In order to win this game,
Stanford must bounce back from
a last-second loss to USC, a game
that just slipped through the
team's fingers. But based on his
team's performance thus far this
season, Willingham believes the
Cardinal will come back with a
vengeance.
"You can take the high road or

the low road (in regards to dealing
with a loss)," he said. "We've
taken the high road. We've
bounced back.
"After the Washington game,
we played hard against UCLA,
though we didn't come up as
strong as we needed to. After
UCI.A, we bounced back against
Oregon State. Then we dealt with
what some may think is the best
team in the league this year and
played a heck of a game. We just
missed by a couple of plays. We've
taken the high road in terms of
setbacks, and we should continue
to do that against our next oppo
nent."
On the other hand, the
Cougars have not. After a strong
start, including a win over UCI-A
and a relatively close battle with
top-ranked Nebraska, WSU is
now mired in a four-game losing
streak. The downturn is taking
its toll.
In the midst of last week's dis
appointing 27-11 Cougar loss to
California, second-year starting
quarterback Chad Davis just gave
up, according to some teammates,
exhibiting a lackadaisical manner
on the field. This is apparently
the latest in a series of incidents
involving Davis this season. It is
also to be the last.
"As a result of a disturbing
pattern of behavior, the Washing

this weekend.
ton State football team has cho
sen to bench Chad Davis for the
next two games," announced
Cougar head coach Mike Price on
Tuesday. "Chad has displayed a
negative and non-supportive atti
tude towards his teammates and
coaches, and that kind of behavior
will not be tolerated. This disci
plinary decision results from an
accumulation of Chad's actions
and is not based on any one inci
dent."
Price would not go into great
detail concerning the nature of
these "actions", but only offered
that they did not involve drugs or
any problems with the law. He
also said that in no way should the
decision signal disapproval with
Davis' performance this season.
"I want everyone to under
stand that Chad should not be
looked upon as a scapegoat for
our losses," he said. "No one in
the program is off the hook
because of this. Everyone must
share in the responsibility of our
record."
Now that Davis, who had
thrown for 1,868 yards and 12
touchdowns in 1995, is out, the
quarterback position is in the
hands of redshirt freshman Ryan
Leaf and fifth-year senior Shawn
Deeds. Together (he two have
thrown five complete passes in 22
attempts this season.
"Ryan Lief and Sean Deeds are
going to play in both of these

games," Price said. "I haven't
decided who will start, but both
will play and both will play con
siderably. I've got some coaching
for Lief and a dust-off and some
WD-40 for Deeds."
The quarterback change poses
some problems for the Stanford
defense. It no longer knows what
tendencies the Cougar play-caller
will exhibit.
"I don't really see it as an
advantage, but they don't know
what we're going to run now,"
said Price.
Willingham's defensive set will
focus upon WSU's passing-orient
ed offense.
"We'll prepare mostly for their
schemes — the three- and four
wide receiver sets — and not just
their quarterbacks," Willingham
said.
Slotback Jay Dumas, tight end
Eric Moore, flanker Bryant
Thomas and split end Chad Car
penter have flourished in the
Cougar's passing attack. All have
racked up at least 20 catches. In
addition, deep threat Shawn Tims
has caught 12 passes and four
touchdowns.
The WSU running game has
been a different story. Despite the
presence of Frank Madu, who is
third in the Pac-10 in rushing at
93.6 yards per game, the Cougars
languish in eighth place overall.
Price admits that his one-back set
can become predictable at times.
In addition, Madu, suffering
from bruised ribs, is listed as
questionable for Saturday's
game. If he does not play, the
Cougars will be without their two

main offensive threats. Davis and
Madu have accounted for 83 per
cent of WSU's total offense this
year.
Defensively, the Cougars rank
fourth in the conference. Despite
losing eight starters from 1994's
defense (which was tops in the
nation), Price has rebuilt quickly.
Dwayne Sanders, one of the three
returning starters, leads a young
defensive line. Chris Hayes and
James Darling, team leaders in
tackles, headline the linebacking
corps. Cornerback Brian Walker
and free safety Derek Henderson,
the other two returning starters,
call the shots in the secondary.
Despite the seemingly weak
ened state of the Washington
State squad, Willingham is still
wary of the trip to Pullman.
"They play very well at home,"
he said. "You could be very easily
deceived by watching their last
game against Cal.
"Over the years, they have
been a very sound, a very good
defense. They have some younger
players in there, but the condition
still stands."
Price, for his part, has been
impressed with the way Stanford
has played this year.
"Stanford is a real good foot
ball team," he said. "I like the way
Stanford plays because it plays as
a team. It plays everything hard.
They are well-disciplined. They
don't have any big stars but they
sure get the job done."
The Cardinal hopes, for the
sake of its post-season plans, that
it can continue that streak this
weekend.
