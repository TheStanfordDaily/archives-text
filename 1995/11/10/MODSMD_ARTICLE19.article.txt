## Cardinal football heads north to tangle with Cougars Bowl hopes on the line as Stanford battles WSU and the elements in chilly showdown at Pullman 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
After a heartbreaker in South
ern California, the Stanford foot
ball team will face a drastically
different set of environmental
factors this weekend. The cold
temperatures, frigid precipitation
and blustery winds of Pullman,
Wash., will be a far cry from the
sun and smog of Los Angeles.
The Cardinal (5-3-1 overall, 3-
3 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
faces off against Washington
State (3-6, 2-4) at 3:30 Saturday
afternoon in a game that means a
great deal to Stanford head coach
Tyrone Willingham and his team.
A Cardinal loss ends virtually any
hopes of participating in a bowl
game, and Willingham knows it.
"When you're playing for
something — and we're playing
for something — each game defi
nitely gets bigger," he said. "This
one is huge as we look at it. We've
got to win this football game if we
want to play 12 games or even
have a chance to play 12."
In order to win this game,
Stanford must bounce back from
a last-second loss to USC, a game
that just slipped through the
team's fingers. But based on his
team's performance thus far this
season, Willingham believes the
Cardinal will come back with a
vengeance.
"You can take the high road or

the low road (in regards to dealing
with a loss)," he said. "We've
taken the high road. We've
bounced back.
"After the Washington game,
we played hard against UCLA,
though we didn't come up as
strong as we needed to. After
UCI.A, we bounced back against
Oregon State. Then we dealt with
what some may think is the best
team in the league this year and
played a heck of a game. We just
missed by a couple of plays. We've
taken the high road in terms of
setbacks, and we should continue
to do that against our next oppo
nent."
On the other hand, the
Cougars have not. After a strong
start, including a win over UCI-A
and a relatively close battle with
top-ranked Nebraska, WSU is
now mired in a four-game losing
streak. The downturn is taking
its toll.
In the midst of last week's dis
appointing 27-11 Cougar loss to
California, second-year starting
quarterback Chad Davis just gave
up, according to some teammates,
exhibiting a lackadaisical manner
on the field. This is apparently
the latest in a series of incidents
involving Davis this season. It is
also to be the last.
"As a result of a disturbing
pattern of behavior, the Washing

this weekend.
