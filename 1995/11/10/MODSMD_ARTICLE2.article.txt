# Prof projects big damage for L.A.

Public officials in Los Angeles may reconsider
earthquake precautions following the release of a
study by a Stanford professor warning of significant
loss of life and extensive damage in the event of anoth
er high-magnitude earthquake in the Los Angeles
area.
The study — authored by Structural Engineering
Prof. Haresh Shah and titled "What if a Major Earth
quake Strikes the Los Angeles Area?" — predicts that
up to 8,000 deaths and $220 billion of damage would
result in the event of an earthquake measuring 7.0 on
the Richter .cale along the Newport-Inglewood Fault,
which runs through one of L.A.'s most densely popu
lated areas.
The last major movement of the fault occurred in
1933, when an earthquake measuring 6.3 on the
Richter scale killed 120 people.
Following three years of research and the release of
preliminary results in October 1994, the new report
features revised potential damage and casualty esti
mates based on new data from the 1994 Northridge
earthquake and the Kobe, Japan quake last January.
While original estimates of the loss of life that would re
sult from a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Sout hern Cal
ifornia hovered at 2,000 to 3,000 deaths, the new sur
vey's peak is more than twice that figure.
Maximum damage estimates have been raised from
$145 billion to $220 billion, and potential injuries have
risen from 15,000 to 20,000. According to the report,
most of the damage would occur in Los Angeles Coun
ty, although Orange County would also be affected.
Shall said that the dramatic increase in the damage
estimates stems from "better data we have received
from Kobe and Northridge. We learned quite a bit from
those earthquakes, and since we decided to incorporate
the latest information, the numbers have changed ac
cordingly."
The report is part of a series of studies on the eco
nomic ramifications of natural disasters in major met
ropolitan areas around the world. Last May, Shah's
firm, Risk Management Solutions, Inc. (RMS), re
leased a similar study of the damage that would be
caused by an 8.3 magnitude earthquake in the Bay
Area. According to the study, 3,000 to 8,000 deaths and
dam.iges totaling between $170 billion and $225 billion
would ensue.
A detailed analysis of Tokyo's preparedness is due
out next month, and reports on the catastrophic risk in
Seattle, St. Louis and Miami will follow.
To prevent the disastrous circumstances projected
in the most recent report, Shah suggested that L.A.
and Orange counties retrofit many of the structures
