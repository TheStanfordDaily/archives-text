# Women's soccer kicks off playoffs
## 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
Nineteen games, one Pacific
10 Conference championship
and several bumps and bruises
later, it all comes down to this
— the NCAA playoffs.
Tonight at 7:30, the Stan
ford women's soccer team (16-3
overall, 7-0 Pac-10) lays it all on
the line when No. 7 Santa Clara
(14-3-2) hosts the ninth-ranked
Cardinal in a do-or-die first
round matchup at the Broncos'
Buck Shaw Stadium. The win
ner advances to the round of 16
and a date with No. 11 Virginia.
Tournament pairings, which
were announced Monday morn
ing, raised eyebrows among
those who expected at least one
of the schools to reccive a first
round bye. Instead, the NCAA
tournament committee chose to
pit Stanford and Santa Clara,
the only top-10 teams which did
not receive byes, against one
another.
"It's great," said head coach
lan Sawyers, "because one, it's

the tournament, and two, you're
right into it — you're not messing
around. It's great to go into a
tournament as an underdog,
rather than being one of the best
teams in the country playing a
lesser seed. If our kids aren't fired
up for this one, then they'll never
he fired up."
Tonight's showdown marks
the second meeting of the year
between the two schools. Santa
Clara, ranked 13th at the time,
defeated the Cardinal 3-2 on Sept.
23 in what was then considered a
mild upset. In that game, the
Broncos jumped out to a 3-0 lead,
then held offa late Stanford surge
to secure the victory. Will the
Cardinal have revenge on its
mind tonight?
"I don't know so much about
revenge," said Sawyers, "but I
think readjustment is going to be
a kev factor. We didn't do some

things that we d hoped to do in
that game, and I think our play
ers were very frustrated with
their play, yet we were still a goal
away from making it difficult."
Santa Clara is making its sev
enth straight NCAA tournament
appearance under head coach
Jerry Smith, but hasn't won a
post-season game since 1992
when the Broncos shut out Stan
ford 2-0 to advance to the nation
al semifinals. Last year the
women were upset by St. Mary's
2-0 in the first round.
The Broncos hope to reverse
that trend tonight with a win at
home against the rival Cardinal.
Led by the efforts of junior for
ward Mikka Hansen (12 goals,
five assists) and junior midfielder
Erin Martinez (nine goals, five
assists), Santa Clara has climbed
steadily up the polls all season.
The team posted a -1-2-1 record
against ranked opponents, fin
ished second in the competitive
West Coast Conference and is
unbeaten in its last seven games.
"They're verv aggressive," said

Sawyers of the Broncos. "They'll
try to disrupt our game plan.
They defend very hard, and
they're always emotionally
charged to play against Stanford.
They [also] knock it to their for
wards pretty early and get their
forwards going. That's their
strength — their forward line."
Stanford, meanwhile, will be
making its sixth consecutive tour
nament appearance and third
straight under Sawyers. The Car
dinal advanced to the round of
eight last season before being
eliminated by Portland 2-1 in a
heartbreaking triple-overtime
loss. This year the Pac-10 Confer
ence champions have allowed just
14 goals en route to a 16-3 overall
mark. They bring a nine-game
winning streak into tonight's
playoff opener.
"Our kids are very excited
about the possibilities," said
Sawyers. "Anytime you're in the
tournament, it's a lot of fun. And
if our kids perform well, I'm very
confident that we can compete
with anybody in the country."
