# Runners set for District 8 Championships
## 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's cross country teams
return to action after two weeks
of hard training, traveling to
Woodland, Wash., for the NCAA
District 8 Championships at the
rain-swept Louis River Golf
Course.
Coming off a hard fought
Pacific 10 Conference meet in
which Oregon swept both titles,
the Cardinal not only seeks
vengeance, but also a berth in
the NCAA National Champi
onships in Ames, lowa, on Nov.
20.
The field will be consider
ably larger than the one that
rumbled through the Stanford
Golf Course in the Pac-10
Championships two weeks ago.
26 schools from up and down
the West Coast, including all
the Pac-10 schools, will field
teams, bringing the total num
ber of runners to 182. The men
will be first to run at 10 a.m.
while the women will follow at
11 a.m.
In order to get an automatic
bid for the nationals, a team has
to place first or second in its
region. A third-place team
might get an at-large bid, but
it's not a certainty. A committee
picks the three at-large teams
from across the country, basing
its selection on rankings,
record, etc. With eight regions
in the country ensuring 19
berths, (three regions, due to
their size, get three automatic
berths), the nationals will end
up fielding 22 teams on both
sides.
The third-ranked Stanford
men's team faces two signifi

cant changes. Instead of the
usual 8,000-meter race, the men
will be running 10,000 meters.
With the significant increase in
mileage, head coach Vin Lanan
na has made one change to his
top seven runners: He will run
junior James Long, citing expe
rience as well as the need for the
"strongest" runners. The rest of
the cast, led by junior Greg Jim
merson and sophomore Nathan
Nutter, remains the same.
Lananna also cited a unique
advantage for the Cardinal.
Despite the muddy conditions of
Saturday's course, he feels
Stanford will benefit because
the team consists of "Midwest
erners" used to these slow run
ning conditions.
Coming in ranked fourth
nationally, the women will once
again rely on their depth to
place highly in this meet.
Sophomore Kortney Dun
scombe will not run, as she con
tinues to rest her back. "We're
going to give her as much time
as possible," Lananna said.
Even without Dunscombe,
the team is still dangerous. Led
by freshman Mary Cobb, junior
Monal Chokshi and sophomore
Sarna Renfro, all of whom fin
ished in the top ten at the Pac
10s, the team stands a good
chance of attaining a NCAA
berth and a chance to run with
Dunscombe once again.
Lananna feels that an impor
tant factor for Saturday's meet
is to not get nervous. "We have
to run a composed, confident
race. We're going to go in there,
ready to go and try to qualify.
"The women have a reason
ably good shot. They should
qualify. The men will have to
run hard," he added.
