# Polo off to face Pacific in warm-up for tourney
## 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
It isn't common for a coach to take
out his starters when his team is hold
ing on to a one-point lead with a minute
to play in the game. But anything could
happen tomorrow when the sixth
ranked Stanford men's water polo team
(13-9, 2-5 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) takes on No. 13 Pacific (8-17, 0-
7 MPSF).
With the all-important MPSF league
tournament just two weeks away, the
Cardinal is more interested in using
Saturday's match as preparation for
defending its conference title than earn
ing a victory at the Tigers' expense.
Of course, Cardinal head coach
Dante Dettamanti would still like to
win, and he expects a tough game from
the Tigers, particularly at their home
pool. But at this point in the season, an
individual game might be sacrificed if it
would favor the team in the big picture.
"The outcome of this game will not
make a difference in the standings,"
Dettamanti said. "Both teams are pret
ty much stuck where they are in the
standings. For that reason, I would like
to use this game to develop our subs.
Our bench needs to get some playing
time because they are going to be cru
cial during the conference tournament.
I am going to be using preset substitu
tion patterns, regardless of the score."
For the Cardinal, like most teams in
the MPSF, the league tournament, to
be held from Nov. 24-26, has assumed
critical importance. Whichever team
emerges from the three-day struggle
atop the conference will not only be
awarded a plaque and a year's worth of
bragging rights, but will also earn one
of the four bids to the NCAA finals. All

told, only two teams from the MPSF
will gain entrance to the championship
round despite the fact that all 10 of the
top-ranked teams in the nation hail
from that league.
The next two weeks are vital for the
Cardinal, as they will be the final oppor
tunity for the team to refine all facets of
its game before the decisive tournament
in Long Beach.
To that end, Dettamanti is using
these weeks of practice to drill his play
ers into shape. "We are working very
hard this week," Dettamanti said. "We
aren't going to rest up like we normally
do before games. This week and next
are training for the MPSF tourna
ment."
In addition to simply running diffi
cult workouts, Dettamanti has made a
number of adjustments in his practices
in an effort to prepare his players for
the upcoming tournament. He is not
allowing either senior Jeremy Laster or
sophomore Layne Beaubien, the two
primary two-meter defenders, to guard
that position during practice in hopes of
defusing a popular strategy of opposing
teams: Frequently this season, teams
have created mismatches at the center
forward spot by driving in a new two
meter man. In the process, one of the
other Cardinal players gets drawn in
and forced to guard the new set.
"Everybody has to learn how to
guard the two-meter spot," Dettamanti
said. "It is guaranteed that guys other
than Jeremy and Layne are going to get
caught in there at some time during the
course of a game, and we just can't
afford to give up easy goals or kick
outs."
Dettamanti is also emphasizing an
improvement in guarding against
other team's counterattack and
perimeter shooting. The Cardi
nal's woes this season have
stemmed from the team's habit of
allowing opponents to score too
many goals, placing excessive
pressure on the offense to keep

pace. It is a pattern which I)etta
manti would like to stop.
In the grand scheme of things
then, today's match against the
Tigers is not terribly significant in
and of itself The importance of the
game lies not so much in the out
come. as in how the Cardinal plays.
"I'm not really concerned with
how Pacific i> playing, or what
they are going to do," said Detta
manti. "I am much more interest
ed in what our guys are doing in

terms of executing and playing a
solid game. Winning the game
would of course be nice, but it is
really not our primary concern."
But while the Cardinal is not
pressing for a win, it must remain
focused on playing at the level
necessary for it to succeed in the
MPSF tournament and the
NCAA championship beyond
that. Time is running short for
Dettamanti's squad to step things
up.
