Live from Stanford University, where
education has become one of the
chief obstacles to intelligence and
freedom of thought, looms the next-to-last
week of college football picks for this sea
son.
Never fear — here this week to try the
law's long arm at prognosticating is Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer, taking a few minutes off from
rounding up the raving bands of nude,
inebriated frat boys that meander campus
two nights a week in unparalleled displays
of stupidity that have "hazing" written all
over them, played his share of football in
college and beyond. But he's about to dis
cover that predicting the outcome of a
game might be just as difficult as influ
encing that outcome on the field.
Read on as the captain takes his best

shot, but don't make any sudden moves
towards your pockets and realize that any
thing you say while mulling over the col
umn can and will be used against you in a
court of law:
Stanford at Washington State
I'm still recovering from the shock of
having "Joe" (who, by the way, admitted
to knowing absolutely nothing about foot
ball) slaughter me in last week's picks by
predicting three of the four big upsets; if
the Cardinal squad had a defense that
didn't regularly de-evolve into a group of
slothful, laggard slowpokes in the final
five minutes of every game, "Joe" would
have gone 5-for-5 and sold me on the
whole psychic bit.

As is it, I'm left with a dilemma
for this week's game. The Cardi
nal is clearly the better squad.
But what of the sub-freezing tem
peratures and precipitation in
Pullman? Can Stanford continue
to play well on the road, where it
is 4-1 on the season?
Perhaps these are answers
only "Joe" could answer before
tomorrow. All 1 can say is that the
game will be close — the Cardinal
has played in five games this sea
son that were decided in the final
minute.
Niemeyer knows that WSU
poses a problem. "If the Cougs
have a running game, [Stanford 1
will be in for it. . . again."
That's not likely to happen
after WSU managed only 80 rush
ing yards last week against Cal.
Besides, the paternalistic Niemey

er thinks " 'our guys' are suffi
ciently irritated enough after get
ting ripped-off by the best pro
team in the NCAA last week" to
pull off the victory.
They may not need any form of
emotion at all to defeat the
Cougars. WSU's starting quarter
back was dumped from the roster
for "non-supportive" behavior
(translation: the team sucked and
he didn't like it) and the two
replacements are a combined 4-
for-22 on the season. One is a red
shirt freshman and the other
hasn't played in a game against a
Division I-A opponent in two
years.
If the Cardinal can remember
which endzone is theirs, this
should be the victory that sends
them to Hawaii. Good luck think
ing about palm trees and coconuts
in the frigid air of Eastern Wash
ington.

Oregon at Arizona
The captain "doesn't really
care" about this one, so let's make
it brief. Arizona ranks 102 out of
108 Division I-A teams in rushing
offense and will meet a gaggle of
Ducks that rank ninth nationally
in rushing defense. Arizona's
offense is averaging fewer points
per game than most top-25 squads
are averaging in the first quarter.
Oregon won't be smelling roses
on New Year's Day again this year
unless it is written into federal
law between now and Jan. 1. But
a decent bowl is still on the hori
zon, and that image of yestc r-year
of the Ducks as in-season game
birds on the gridiron is slowly fad
ing.

Arizona State at Cal
The captain likes the "Frank
furters" in this one. And while I
know I should never dispute an

officer of the law, I've developed a
real aversion to nitrites, especially
with Big Game only a week away.

Washington at UCIA
These two clubs have had roller
coaster seasons that make Great
America's Top Gun ride look like a
rickety swingset. With the race for
the Rose Bowl all but over, all that's
left is to jostle over positioning
within the conference. The Huskies
have had two football teams playing
all season long — one talented
squad that beat Miami and jumped
out ahead of USC, and another piti
ful team that blew a three-touch
down lead to the Trojans and lost to
Oregon last weekend.
The Bruins are the Bad News
Bears for football fans in West
wood. A quick start to the season
has evolved into a mediocre 3-3
Pac-10 record, and only Karim
Abdul-Jabbar has remained stel-

lar all season.
For Niemeyer, Abdul-Jabbar
won't be enough. "The Huskies
will slam-dunk Karim and will pre
vail."
I'm not sure if I'd put my
money on that; besides, Niemeyer
warned me (in his altruistic
attempt to uphold the law) not to
"bet on any of these games."
While I did turn 21 last month,
I'm not particularly interested in
flushing money down the john
while trying to exercise what fee
ble predictive skills I have. (For a
point of clarification, see my
cumulative record below)

USC at Oregon State
Hopefully this mismatch won't
be televised, the captain says."I
couldn't bear to hear the Univer
sity of Spoiled Children's band
play that annoying refrain a mil
lion times."

That incessantly executed ditty
will be music to the jewelry-laden
ears of SC fans, who will get to
watch the tube as their beloved
studs clinch a berth in the Rose
Bowl.
I was trying to think of ways to
actually make this an interesting
game. Maybe raise each Beaver
touchdown to the power of ten?
Or how about calling the 50-yard
line OSU's goal every time their
offense takes the field?
I guess even those "redistribu
tion of points" plans require that
the Beavers move the football.
And when your offense is better
than only two other squads in col
lege football, you can't even take
walking out on the field without
pulling a muscle for granted.
