Live from Stanford University, where
education has become one of the
chief obstacles to intelligence and
freedom of thought, looms the next-to-last
week of college football picks for this sea
son.
Never fear â€” here this week to try the
law's long arm at prognosticating is Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer, taking a few minutes off from
rounding up the raving bands of nude,
inebriated frat boys that meander campus
two nights a week in unparalleled displays
of stupidity that have "hazing" written all
over them, played his share of football in
college and beyond. But he's about to dis
cover that predicting the outcome of a
game might be just as difficult as influ
encing that outcome on the field.
Read on as the captain takes his best

shot, but don't make any sudden moves
towards your pockets and realize that any
thing you say while mulling over the col
umn can and will be used against you in a
court of law:
Stanford at Washington State
I'm still recovering from the shock of
having "Joe" (who, by the way, admitted
to knowing absolutely nothing about foot
ball) slaughter me in last week's picks by
predicting three of the four big upsets; if
the Cardinal squad had a defense that
didn't regularly de-evolve into a group of
slothful, laggard slowpokes in the final
five minutes of every game, "Joe" would
have gone 5-for-5 and sold me on the
whole psychic bit.
