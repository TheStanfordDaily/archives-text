Where's
the beef?


Brought to you by Ben Squire ft Jason Wishnow

"The beef is in our
links and in our hot
dogs and we have
veal and pork
and turkey also."
— Joe Ryan,
Ireland


"I just came from
chemistry ... we
haven't gotten to
that yet, we're just
doing carboxylic
acids."
— Robyn Nordstrom,
Sophomore, Virgo



"I'm having trouble
with 'the beef'
because we're
bringing the Good
News and we prefer
to be on the positive
side, so we don't
want to have a beef
with the opposition."
— Earl Keener,
The Gideons


"I want to say in
your pants' but
that's not very
appropriate."
— Betsy Kennedy,
Senior, English
