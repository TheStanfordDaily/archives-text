# Man, oh manna!
## 
### 
Yhu know, it's not even day that I take it
upon myself to solve the international food
shortage and end world hunger, or at least
make sure 1 eat right. But last week. 1 tried.
"Golly, 1 really should try to eat better," 1
told my Pop Tart at breakfast. We were
briefly out of Froot Loops.
It didn't respond, but 1 knew what it was
thinking. "Yes. You should But, oy, it's hard,
1 know. Sometimes, you have to skip a meal.
Sometimes you have to eat. And so Tres Ex is
most convenient — whose fault is that?'
"I know, 1 know. Believe you me, I don't
need no PHK to tt'll me improper diet can lead
to mental imbalance. But, I'm busy enough
without having to schedule self-maintenance
on top of everything else. Why can't we run on
batteries like those dorky made-over man
nequins on those Duracell commercials?
Somehow, I wish something would just take
care of this whole subsistence issue."
"Like manna from heaven, huh?" I thought
I heard my Pop Tart think.
Like manna from . . . now there's an idea.
Tasty, low-cal, cholesterol-free manna to take
the worry and inconvenience out of suste
nance. If all there was around was manna,
then that would just be one less thing to worry
about. I mean . . . yeah, like it's . . . Manna!
Just think how great it would be, gettin' all
spiffed up to go out to your favorite manna
place. Of course, if you're short on time, you
could just stop out for a quick bite at Manna
Bell, and that's cool, too. And. hey, even if
you're stuck at home with manna leftovers,
well . . . what more could you want?
That's right, sorrowful cries of "I Boring

food| again?!?" would be swapped for the daily
affirmation of "Manna Again!!" Mmm-mmm
good. There will no longer be a need for little
youngsters everywhere to stare blankly at
broccoli while parents whine of children starv
ing overseas. (By the way, when I was small,
this logic always escaped me: a. I have food
and do not want it. b. Small child in Zanzibar
wants food but does not have it. c. Therefore,
/ should eat the food? I mean . . . huh?)
Oh, and around here, hashing would be a
breeze, and that double-portion thing is per
fect for the weekends.
Yes indeed, this definitely sounded like a
plan and I had to be the one to carry it out. If
1 could get it right, we'd all be set. I mean,
this is manna — any portion is divinely guar
anteed to satisfy, right? 1 would feed the world
and still make my 9 a.m.
From what I remembered, it was simple
enough and so I bet if I took the afternoon. 1
could get a good start, no problem. What did 1
need? Ingredients, yes. Ah. but first, the
recipe. So I picked up the world's first cook
book and flipped right to Exodus 16:14.
The house of Israel called it manna. It was
11he coriander seed, white, and the taste of it
was like wafers touched with honey.
Golden Grahams?
Well, I could see right off that this might be
a challenge. I wasn't going to have lot of luck
reconstructing the original genuine article.
The "recipe" didn't leave much to work with
and we were fresh out of coriander seed.
Besides, everything was measured in "omers,"
which is not exactly the metric system. Even
after converting to cubits, 1 still didn't think I

had it right.
1 seemed to be on my own, which is maybe
how it should have been. I mean, this was my
little project. Give or take a little divine reve
lation and Kellogg's inspiration, this was com
pletely my idea. (Sound cue #12: Maniacal
laughter — Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget.)
Furiously, I scoured the kitchen. I collected
something from every food group, including
the bagel group. Flour. Salt. Graham crack
ers. String cheese. Granola. Instant hot cocoa.
Loaf of bread. Container of milk. Stick of but
ter. Kye of newt.
Pots, pans, Cuisinarts. Stoves ablaze. Oven
preheated to 450 degrees. Fverything arrayed
before me, I was ready to create. (Sound cue
#486: Gargainel fantasizing: Smurf kabobs,
Smurf pate, etc.)
Then someone walked in.
"Urn . . . what are you doing?"
"Huh? Bu-I-well . . . Uh, nothing," I said.
"Just cleaning up."
With a shrug and a laugh, I began to tidy
up, leaving my housemate to consider my
obvious mental imbalance. Apparently, my
demented dreams of world relief were just
going to have to wait, as was dinner. Back to
the same old routine. But before closing my
cookbook of wonders, 1 skimmed quickly,
searching for one last message of hope.
An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.
Oh. Great.
