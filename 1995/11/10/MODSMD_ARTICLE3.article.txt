## Judaism 'definitely' part of show, Spock tells Trekkies 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
He titled his first autobiography, "I am Not Spock." He ti
tled the sequel, "I am Spock."
Addressing an audience of about 450 yesterday afternoon in
Kresge Auditorium, Leonard Nimoy, who played the emotion
less Vulcan character on the original "Star Trek," talked about
the issue of his identity — as Mr. Spock, as Nimoy and as a Jew.
The Jewish Studies Program sponsored the speech, "Spock
in the Diaspora." Talking to the audience about religion in
"Star Trek," Nimoy explained that there is an overall lack of re
ligious discussion and that for the most part, if a character is
praving it means he or she is in trouble. Still, he said, he worked

his religion into the show.
"Is there Judaism in 'Star Trek'?" Nirnoy asked. "Definite
ly, yes."
Recounting a childhood memory of services at his orthodox
synagogue in Boston, Nimoy pulled a prayer shawl from the
podium. He wrapped the shawl around his shoulders, pulled it
over his head, carefully positioned his hands and began chanti
ng, demonstrating the prayer he remembered from his youth
as "passionate" and "mesmerizing."
In making "A Mock Time," a Star Trek episode where Spock
goes back to his home planet to fulfill a marriage contract,
Nimoy said there was a processional during which the planet's

matriarch came out to meet Spock
and welcome him home.
"Different cultures have differ
ent ways of greeting each other,"
Nimoy said. "The question was how
Spock was going to greet her."
Incorporating his Jewish roots
into the episode, Nimoy said he
taught the actress playing the
matriarch to copy the hand gestures
of the praying Jews he remembered
from his childhood — a V-shape
with the hand split between the
middle and ring fingers. He added
that the now-famous "live long and
prosper" phrase was spoken for the
first time in that scene as well.
"A week after the episode aired
for the first time, I was in Cleve
land," Nimoy said. "A women
waved at me like that. It's a symbol
tliat people recognize immediately
and an icon connected to 'live long
and prosper.' "
On stage for the first time when
he was eight vears old, Nimoy said

that his decision to go to school in
California and become an actor
shocked his Russian parents.
"My Jewish immigrant family
didn't exactly sneak out of Russia to
make it possible for their son to
hangout with what they called gyp
sies and actors," Nimoy said.
Ailer going to school in Califor
nia for a few months, Nimoy began
to work with a Yiddish theater
group in Los Angeles. In 1982, while
working on "A Woman Called
Golda" — a movie about former
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir
— Nimoy said he had another
opportunity to play a Jewish role.
"I went to Israel with Ingrid
Bergman for 'A Woman Called
Golda,' " Nimoy said. "I played her
schleppy, tag-along husband, a very
Jewish character. Things were
going along all right for the first two
or three or four days and I was doing
a scene with Judy Davis and I asked
about how to interpret a line and
out it came — the director said to
me, 'What does it matter? You're
not right for the role anyway.' It was
unhappy territory coming to grips
with. 'Are vou Jewish?' Over time.

there was a measure of acceptance
and I got nominated for an Emmy
for the role."
Coming back to the question of
his identity as linked to Mr. Spock,
Nimoy discussed his new autobiog
raphy, "I am Spook."
"When I wrote the first book, 'I
am not Spock,' and people asked me
if there was going to bo a sequel 1
said, joking, that I'd do one one day
iind call it 'Well, maybe I am,' "
Nimoy said.
After 30 years of playing Spock,
Nimoy explained his new book gave
him a sense of closure.
"I produced and wrote the story
for 'Star Trek 6,' " Nimoy said. "In
fact, there is a scene in [the film)
with Spock and Kirk near the end.
Spock was betrayed by a fellow Vul
can and he's feeling sorry for him
self.
"Spock philosophically asks
'Have we outlived our usefulness in
Star Fleet?' It struck me as a sub
text: Leonard Nimoy saying to Hill
Shatner 'Have you and I outlived
our usefulness?' Spock and I were
one and the same voice, on common
trround."

a scene with Judy Davis and I asked
about how to interpret a line and
out it came — the director said to
me, 'What does it matter? You're
not right for the role anyway.' It was
unhappy territory coming to grips
with. 'Are vou Jewish?' Over time.

there was a measure of acceptance
and I got nominated for an Emmy
for the role."
Coming back to the question of
his identity as linked to Mr. Spock,
Nimoy discussed his new autobiog
raphy, "I am Spook."
"When I wrote the first book, 'I
am not Spock,' and people asked me
if there was going to bo a sequel 1
said, joking, that I'd do one one day
iind call it 'Well, maybe I am,' "
Nimoy said.
After 30 years of playing Spock,
Nimoy explained his new book gave
him a sense of closure.
"I produced and wrote the story
for 'Star Trek 6,' " Nimoy said. "In
fact, there is a scene in [the film)
with Spock and Kirk near the end.
Spock was betrayed by a fellow Vul
can and he's feeling sorry for him
self.
"Spock philosophically asks
'Have we outlived our usefulness in
Star Fleet?' It struck me as a sub
text: Leonard Nimoy saying to Hill
Shatner 'Have you and I outlived
our usefulness?' Spock and I were
one and the same voice, on common
trround."
