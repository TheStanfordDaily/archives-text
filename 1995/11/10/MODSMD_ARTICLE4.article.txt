# ASSU to run cheap airport shuttle
## 
### Kristina Batiste 
Students rushing to catch flights home for
Thanksgiving will benefit from a new, low-cost shut
tle service sponsored by the ASSU and Fry's Elec
tronics.
Under the plan, students holding vouchers on sale
from the ASSU will save between $5 and $10 off reg
ular prices on rides to the San Francisco and San Jose
International airports.
The ASSU has contracted with an outside shut-

tle service to provide continuous
shuttles going directly from Stan
ford to the airports with no outside
stops.
The airport shuttle service is an
endeavor of the Group Discount
Project, an ASSU program that
aims to provide student discounts
on such items as tickets to amuse
ment parks and professional bas
ketball games.
Project Manager Danny Bressler

and ASSU Financial Manager John Hall said they
saw a lack of options for students going to the airport
over Thanksgiving weekend. They hope their plan
will make it easier and less expensive to secure a
shuttle ride to and from the airports.
"This is the first time a shuttle service has been
run by the ASSU in may years," said Bressler. He
said that if the project is successful, it may be repeat
ed for the winter holidays.
"We really feel there's a strong demand for it
among students," Hall said. "It's a great way to get
students a good deal on something they really
need."

The shuttles will operate on a pre-pay voucher sys
tem. Vouchers for a specific time slot to the airport of
choice will sell for $10 for departing rides and $11 for
return service to Stanford. Vouchers will be available
until Nov. 15 at the ASSU office.
The shuttles will depart from in front of Lagunita
Court and from Wilbur field. The shuttles will run
from both locations to both airports every hour and
15 minutes.

Vouchers for a specific time slot
to the airport of choice will sell for
$10 for departing rides and $11
for return service to Stanford.

Shuttles will run to both airports Nov. 21 and
Nov. 22 from 6 a.m. until 6:30 p.m., and will return
that Sunday from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m.
The service is the latest offering from the ASSU
Group Discount program, following Stanford Day
and discount tickets to Great America and Golden
State Warriors games. Bressler said that so far, the
program has been successful, and the project man
agers are currently working on a weekend ski-trip
package for dorms.
"Group Discounts has been very well-received,"
Hall added. "Students have contacted us and ex
pressed a great deal of excitement that somebody in
(he ASSU is doing something that will benefit them
and save them money."
