# Senate divided over faculty's responsibility to advise
## Advising report causes sparks 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
In its most heated debate this year,
the Faculty Senate yesterday spent al
most 90 minutes discussing the benefits
of compensating faculty for advising
freshmen and whether advising is a
choice or a responsibility.
If nothing else, the meeting showed
that despite an eight-month investiga
tion of undergraduate advising, faculty

members may never
agree on specific im
provements to the
system.
The most contro
versial aspect of the
report, presented by
Ramon Saldfvar, vice
provost of undergrad
uate education, was

its recommendation that faculty be com
pensated for advising undeclared under

graduates.
The issue appeared to divide the sen
ate in half, some recommending an in
centive system and others suggesting
that compensation would divert funding
that could be better used elsewhere.
Although an official compensation
plan would be constructed by the Uni
versity president and provost, senators
argued that two of the most common

forms of compensation — money
juid additional sabbatical time —
would inhibit teaching, the primary
role of faculty.
"I worry about giving the faculty
incentives to do freshman advis
ing," said English Prof. Robert Pol
hemus. "Advising will never be per
fect. It's not as important as the
teaching and research that happens
m the University. It's not what the
University exists for. Good teach
ing and good research is what it's
for."
The 11-member committee, cre
ated in .June, found that most stu
dents expected more from the
advising system, a trend common
to all universities, Saldivar said.
Students often complained that
their faculty advisers were not
knowledgeable in the specifics of
freshman year.
The committee recommended
clarification of the adviser's role
and suggested revision of advising
literature mailed to incoming fresh
men. But senators disagreed on a
more basic issue: whether faculty
from all departments ;ire qualified
to advise freshmen.
Chemistry Prof. Michael Fayer
argued that faculty in graduate
schools are often not necessarily
qualified, nor should they be. Mis
outspoken remarks drew emotional
reactions by two medical school

professors who both are currently
freshman advisers.
"We exist as educators and as
scientists, as teachers and as advis
ers," said Developmental Biology
Prof. Lucille Shapiro, who works in
the Medical School. "It would be
reward enough if we were simply
recognized as educators and faculty
at Stanford.... We are advisers.
We would like a greater role. We're
here."
Wliile Shapiro said she would
prefer verbal recognition over mon
etary compensation, Molecular
Pharmacology Prof. Phyllis Gard
ner said monetary compensation is
necessary to keep other Medical
School professors involved in fresh
man advising.
But Radiology Prof. Lewis
Wexler said Medical School faculty
are paid too much already for advis
ing compensation to have an
impact.
If compensation is necessary,
the advisers should be profession
als, said Economics Prof. Timothy
Bresnahan, who emphatically stat
ed that no amount of money could
compel him to be a freshman advis
er. Saldivar acknowledged that
freshman advisers at the Universi
ty of Chicago are all professionals.
Other senators also rebuked the
encouragement to advise freshmen
and said the committee's recom
mendations existed solely to pro
duce more faculty advisers. Cur
rently, 9 percent of faculty serve as
freshman advisers, comprising only
one-third of all freshman advisers.

Some senate members also criti
cized the committee's report for
failing to place equal importance on
graduate advising.
"It just sounds like if you're not
a faculty member who gives formal
undergrad advising, you're falling
down on your teaching responsibil
ities," said Fayer. "I just don't feel
that way. Some of us are advising
up to our eyeballs."
Fayer exhorted Saldivar to "at
least acknowledge the fact that
graduate students exist in this Uni
versity" and revise the recommen
dations to include graduate advis
ing.
The senators with advising
experience agreed that their com
mittment to advising was not
matched by their students' inter
est. Many senators believe fresh
men do not have a vested interest in
the advising program, which causes
faculty to leave the program.
"I have demonstrated my com
mitment in many ways," said Mate
rials Science Prof. John Bravman,
adding that over one-fourth of his
advisees skip their meetings with
him. "Like education, it's got to be
two ways."
The senate did not take any
action on the committee's report,
but plans to discuss the matter fur
ther Jan. 25. Both University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice support advising
reform. Rice plans to forward the
report to the University Cabinet,
Dean of Research Charles Kruger
said.
