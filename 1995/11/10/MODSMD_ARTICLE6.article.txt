# Farm Security Council
## Model U.N. comes back 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
After a two-year hiatus, Stan
ford's Model United Nations is once
again debating vital international
issues.
"In schools around the world,
M.U.N, simulates the workings of
the U.N.," said senior Kevin Looi,
vice president of M.U.N. "Ix>cal
chapters send delegations, who rep
resent an individual country, to
conferences. They create and vote
on resolutions.
"It's a great opportunity to de
velop public-speaking skills and to
become more aware on the interna
tional level," Looi added.
Moreover, M.U.N, helps people
better understand international
governing bodies, Looi said.
"People don't always realize
that every nation is sovereign. You
can't force countries to do any
thing," Looi said. "Through
M.U.N, you leave with a sense of
how the U.N. approaches its prob
lems."
Each week, the Stanford chapter
holds mock conferences on current
international issues, said sopho
more Claudia Campos, the secre
tary of M.U.N.
"Last week we debated over the
expansion of the Security Council,"
Campos said. "People represented
countries such as Japan and Ger
many."
The model world body debates
either on actual U.N. resolutions or
from ideas submitted by members,
Looi said.
Both Looi and senior Mike Put
nam, the chapter president, are
transfer students and had previ
ously attended the Harvard M.U.N,
conference, the largest one in the
world.
"I was shocked when I got here
to see that Stanford didn't have an
active M.U.N, program," Looi said.
"A major university of this caliber
should have one."
"The organization died away
before because it didn't have
enough help," said Looi. "When
the core group became too busy or
left to study abroad, they had no
depth to support them."
Putnam, participated in
M.U.N, while studying overseas
at Oxford University. When Put
nam got back, he contacted Looi.
"He got the momentum, the
inertia going," Looi said.
Campos had already registered
the group with the ASSU.
"We were lucky enough to
meet up and start working
together," Campos said.
The model U.N. already has a
number of activities planned for
this year, Campos said.
The group hopes to commemo
rate the United Nations 50th
anniversary, which took place
last month, Campos said.
"We'd like to have a panel dis
cussing a current issue," Campos
said. "We've contacted some

members of the faculty. Hopeful
ly, we can also get some Hoover
fellows, such as Harry Wu or
George Shultz, to speak."
Looi said the club is also plan
ning a statewide high school con
ference.
"We need to get funds in order
to participate in a collegiate con
ference," Looi said.
"We'd also like to hold a Stan
ford-student only conference on
campus this year, to give people
more experience," Looi said.
Winter quarter, the club hopes
to send a Stanford delegation to a
conference at another school,
Campos said.
A large range of people partici
pate in M.U.N., Looi stressed.
"M.U.N, isn't just for Interna
tional Relations or Political Sci
ence majors. There's a wide
appeal," Looi said. "After all, two
of the people who restarted the
club are Engineering majors," he
said.
Looi added, "We're looking to
expand. The interest, talent and
resources are here. People should
check us out."
S.M.U.N, meets Tuesdays at
8:15 p.m. in Bechtel Internation
al Center.
