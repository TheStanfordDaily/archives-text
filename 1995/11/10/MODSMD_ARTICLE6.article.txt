## Model U.N. comes back 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
After a two-year hiatus, Stan
ford's Model United Nations is once
again debating vital international
issues.
"In schools around the world,
M.U.N, simulates the workings of
the U.N.," said senior Kevin Looi,
vice president of M.U.N. "Ix>cal
chapters send delegations, who rep
resent an individual country, to
conferences. They create and vote
on resolutions.
"It's a great opportunity to de
velop public-speaking skills and to
become more aware on the interna
tional level," Looi added.
Moreover, M.U.N, helps people
better understand international
governing bodies, Looi said.
"People don't always realize
that every nation is sovereign. You
can't force countries to do any
thing," Looi said. "Through
M.U.N, you leave with a sense of
how the U.N. approaches its prob
lems."
Each week, the Stanford chapter
holds mock conferences on current
international issues, said sopho
more Claudia Campos, the secre
tary of M.U.N.
"Last week we debated over the
expansion of the Security Council,"
Campos said. "People represented
countries such as Japan and Ger
many."
The model world body debates
either on actual U.N. resolutions or
from ideas submitted by members,
Looi said.
Both Looi and senior Mike Put
nam, the chapter president, are
transfer students and had previ
ously attended the Harvard M.U.N,
conference, the largest one in the
world.
"I was shocked when I got here
to see that Stanford didn't have an
active M.U.N, program," Looi said.
