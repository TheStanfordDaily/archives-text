Rabin's assassination was a calculated move
JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's slaying was part of a care
fully planned right-wing conspiracy, Israel's police minister said yesterday. Police
unearthed a cache of guns and explosives at the home of the confessed killer.
Two more religious Jewish extremists were hauled into court handcuffed and
shackled, and police said they planned to charge one of them with murder. Only one
suspect has been accused of murder so far — confessed gunman Yigal Amir.
Calvin and Hobbes comic strip to end
KANSAS CI'IY, Mo. (AP) — Calvin and Hobbes, the terrible tyke and his sidekick
tiger, will be retired from the funny pages on Dec. 31.
In a letter to newspaper editors yesterday, cartoonist Bill Watterson said the deci
sion to end the strip was not a recent or easy decision.
"I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and
small panels," Watterson, 38, said in the letter. "I am eager to work at a more
thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises."
The letter featured a drawing of the two cartoon characters getting kicked out a
door. The two buddies are shown clutching each other they fly through the air,
leaving a trail of stars.
