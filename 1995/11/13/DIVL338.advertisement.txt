National Day of Black Consciousness in Brazil:
Commemoration of 300 Years of Zumbi
(sponsored by the Brazilian Student's Association and the Black Students' Union)
• The National Day of Black Consciousness in Brazil commemorates 300 years since the
death of Zumbi, a contemporary black hero and king of Palmares — the most famous
quilombo, community of escaped slaves in Brazil. Over 20,000 fugitive slaves inhabited
Palmares and they resisted Portuguese and Dutch invasions for almost a century.
• Though May 13th Is the official celebration of the abolition of slavery, because Black
Brazilians find themselves in deplorable conditions similar to the time of slavery, they
protest this day and instead, have created their own day of national awareness In honor
of the death of Zumbi.
