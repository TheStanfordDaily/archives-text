# Football bowls over Cougars
## Big Game might not end Cardinal season 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN, Wash. - It didn't look
good for Stanford football.
Nearly halfway through the game,
the Cardinal trailed Washington State
17-3. Stanford hadn't done much on
either offense or defense and Bowl
hopes were fading away with the af
ternoon light.
"We were looking for anything to
give us some momentum," said Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willingham.
"We needed something to get us
going."
Junior flanker Brian Manning
gave the Cardinal what it was looking
for.
On a critical fourth-and-seven
play, he pulled in a 35-yard pass from
senior Mark Butterfield, leaping high
between two Cougar defensive backs
in the end zone to haul in the touch
down that resuscitated the Stanford
squad.
"It was time for me to step up and
make some plays," Manning said.
"What better time? As the ball went
up in the air, I knew it was essential
that I make that catch."
Manning, much-maligned for drop
ping some passes — including a cru
cial two-point conversion in last
week's narrow loss to USC — came
back strong against WSU's secondary.
The flanker snagged a season-high
eight passes for 125 yards.
"The coaches didn't lose faith in
me," Manning said. "I appreciate
that. I didn't lose faith in myself."
Sparked by the catch, Stanford (6-
3-1 overall, 4-3 Pacific 10 Conference)
bore down after the break, reeling off
three unanswered touchdowns to
begin the second half en route to a 36-
24 victory over Washington State (3-
7,2-5). The victory ensured the Cardi
nal of its first winning season since
1992.
"Just to win this game is a big
thing," Willingham said. "This team
is a winner. We will have a winning
record in 1995."
