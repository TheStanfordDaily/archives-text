# Football bowls over Cougars
## Big Game might not end Cardinal season 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN, Wash. - It didn't look
good for Stanford football.
Nearly halfway through the game,
the Cardinal trailed Washington State
17-3. Stanford hadn't done much on
either offense or defense and Bowl
hopes were fading away with the af
ternoon light.
"We were looking for anything to
give us some momentum," said Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willingham.
"We needed something to get us
going."
Junior flanker Brian Manning
gave the Cardinal what it was looking
for.
On a critical fourth-and-seven
play, he pulled in a 35-yard pass from
senior Mark Butterfield, leaping high
between two Cougar defensive backs
in the end zone to haul in the touch
down that resuscitated the Stanford
squad.
"It was time for me to step up and
make some plays," Manning said.
"What better time? As the ball went
up in the air, I knew it was essential
that I make that catch."
Manning, much-maligned for drop
ping some passes — including a cru
cial two-point conversion in last
week's narrow loss to USC — came
back strong against WSU's secondary.
The flanker snagged a season-high
eight passes for 125 yards.
"The coaches didn't lose faith in
me," Manning said. "I appreciate
that. I didn't lose faith in myself."
Sparked by the catch, Stanford (6-
3-1 overall, 4-3 Pacific 10 Conference)
bore down after the break, reeling off
three unanswered touchdowns to
begin the second half en route to a 36-
24 victory over Washington State (3-
7,2-5). The victory ensured the Cardi
nal of its first winning season since
1992.
"Just to win this game is a big
thing," Willingham said. "This team
is a winner. We will have a winning
record in 1995."

Senior wide receiver Mark Harris leaps for the touchdown grab that broke
Washington State's back in Stanford's 36-24 win Saturday.
The triumph also drastically
improved Stanford's chances of
capturing either the Pac-10's berth
in the Aloha Bowl on Christmas
Day or perhaps an invitation to the
Independence Bowl in Shreveport,
l>a. With such carrots dangling in
front of their faces, it was easy for
Cardinal athletes to get pumped up
for the second half.
"Coach got us to realize the
importance of playing well in the
second half," said senior wide
receiver Mark Harris, who had four
receptions for 120 yards. "I don't
think it took too much to convince
us."
Sophomore running back An
thony Bookman definitely knew
what was at stake. "All I kept think
ing about was 30 minutes — 30
minutes if we want to go to a bowl
game," he said. "We were looking
death right in the eye. You've got to
see what kind of a man you are. Are
you going to lay down or step up?"
Bookman stepped up in a big
way. After being held to 25 yards on
eight carries (including a 22-yard
run) in the first half, he racked up
98 yards on 13 carries in the second
to go over 100 yards rushing for the
fourth time this year.
On the second play of the second
half, Bookman broke out of the
Cougar defensive front and dashed
41 yards to WSU's 14 before free
safety Shad Hinchen brought him
down. The scamper set up an eight
yard touchdown run by junior Mike
Mitchell to tie the score at 17.
After the Stanford defense
forced the Cougars to punt on
fourth-and-38, Bookman was all
the offense Stanford needed. He
took the kick from the Cardinal's
own 41 to WSU's 46. Runs of six,
12 and three yards brought the
Cardinal to the 25. Then, Book
man caught a swing pass from
Butterfield and, with the help of a
Manning block, raced into the end
zone.
A few series later, Bookman
returned a punt 46 yards to the
Cougar 31, helping to set up a 10-
vard touchdown on a reverse by

sophomore flanker Damon Dunn.
"The linemen and fullbacks just
did a great job of blocking and
opened up some holes," Bookman
said. "They gave me a chance to get
into the open field."
Bookman's inspired perfor
mance came after learning that
Mitchell, Stanford's other premier
back, would only see limited action
in the second half after slightly
injuring his knee.
"I'm kind of speechless," Man
ning said. "[Bookman] really came
through for us. We couldn't have
done it without him."
After WSU narrowed the lead to
six (senior placekicker Eric Abrams
missed the extra point on Stan
ford's third touchdown of the half),
Stanford quickly widened the gap
again.
On a play-action pass that the
Cougar secondary didn't bite on,
Butterfield threw deep to Harris,
who, in a move reminiscent of Man
ning's, leapt up between two
defenders, made the grab and trot
ted into the end zone for a 54-yard
touchdown strike. In the first quar
ter, Harris had set up a 34-yard
Abrams field goal with a 52-yard
catch.
"It's a do-or-die thing," Harris
said. "You hope to bring the cover
age up with play-action, but it
didn't work. [Butterfield] just
heaved it up there and gave me a
chance to make the play. He's
throwing the ball really well and
he's got a lot of confidence in us."
Butterfield completed 19 of 31
pass attempts for three touchdowns
and 320 yards. Last Friday marked
the first time the team has won this
year when Butterfield's passing
yardage exceeded 300. "It was nice
to air it out a little," the quarter
back said, "especially when you
have guys like Manning and Harris
making plays like that. I just
dropped back, threw it up and they
did the rest."
The team's second-half outburst
was a far cry from what it had
accomplished in the first. The Car
dinal's first drive ended with a fum
ble by junior tight end Greg Clark,
its second with a field goal after a

touchdown had been called back by
a holding penalty and its third with
an interception.
"The second half was a real gut
check for our football team," Will
ingham said. "We played sloppy at
fust. We just didn't play with any
poise and we were out of control.
"In the second half, we played
with much more discipline. They
showed a lot of character and
courage."
The defense also had to make
adjustments. WSU's redshirt fresh
man quarterback Ryan Ijeaf, start
ing in place of the benched Chad
Davis, found early success against
the Cardinal defense. He completed
11 of 18 passes for 99 yards, includ
ing 21- and 22-yard touchdown
passes to receiver Brian Thomas
and tight end Eric Moore, respec
tively.
"The plays they scored on were
blown coverage by the secondary,"
said junior free safety Josh Madsen.
"It hurt us and we knew we had to
step it up."
The defense performed well in
the second half, a time which
seemed to have become a problem
for Stanford in games against
Washington, UCLA and USC.
Madsen helped the Cardinal cause
by knocking WSU's star running
back Frank Madu out of the game
late in the second half. Madu had
been a problem in the first half, net
ting 80 yards on 13 carries.
Despite its lackluster play and
the 14-point, first-half deficit, the
Cardinal remained confident that it
could mount a comeback.
"We definitely weren't clicking
out there," Butterfield said. "But
we knew the game was 60 minutes
long. We were down 17-3, but we
weren't out of it. We just said, 'Ix?t's
get a score.' "
Senior defensive end Jason
White spoke for the defense. "I
wasn't nervous at all," he said. "I
just knew how poorly we played in
the first half. That's not our style.
"I wasn't sure if we'd come back,
but I was confident that everyone
was going to come back and play
their hearts out. That second half
was our whole season."
