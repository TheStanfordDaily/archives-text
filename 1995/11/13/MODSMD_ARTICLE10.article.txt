# Clinton won't support GOP plan

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Clinton administration refused yes
terday to commit to a seven-year
balanced budget as the Republican
price for averting the twin crises
this week of a partial federal shut
down and a halt to government bor
rowing.
In what amounted to a day of
broadcast budget bargaining, lead
ers swapped conditions for complet
ing a pair of bills allowing t he gov
ernment to continue borrowing and
spending money, which President
Clinton has threatened to veto.
Federal spending authority
expires at midnight today and fail
ure to extend it will force hundreds
of thousands of federal employees
to go home tomorrow morning and
will curtail what are considered to
be non-essential government ser
vices. Separately, borrowing

authority also lapses this week,
which could rattle financial mar
kets if not extended.
Clinton has vowed to veto the
two separate bills addressing the
spending authority and debt ceiling
matters.
He objects to the temporary debt
ceiling extension because it con
tains new restrictions on the way
the government could handle its
cash flow if no agreement on a long
term debt ceiling increase was
reached by the time the temporary
extension expires.
He objects to the temporary
spending authority bill because it
encompasses much of the GOP
Congress's entire philosophy of a
smaller government and reduced
spending. Clinton is specifically
honing in on a provision that would
allow Medicare premiums to rise in

January and thus keep the Republi
cans on track toward their larger
goal of saving $270 billion in Medi
care spending over a seven-year
period.
Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., went on ABC's "This
Week With David Brinkley" and
said, "If the president would agree
to a balanced budget in seven years,
then we could make very good
progress" in completing the bills.
That sentiment was echoed by
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-
Ga. Appearing on NBC's "Meet the
Press," he called for "a letter from
the president that said, 4 1 accept in
principle getting to a balanced bud
get in seven years, not the details,
but in principle.' "
White House chief of staff Leon
Panetta wasted little time in turn
ing them down.
