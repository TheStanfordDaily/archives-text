## Editorial Where's Taco Bell? 
### 
It appears that little
has been done to
fulfill old promises

JUST WHAT IS Tresidder
Union? A building with nice
meeting rooms? The site of an
expensive convenience store? Or
perhaps the location of the cam
pus' main computer cluster?
It's clear that the sum of Tresid
der's varied parts don't add up to a
cohesive whole. Perhaps it's sim
pler to say what the sprawling
building is not. Although the word
"union" is in its name, Tresidder
is not a student union. This is
unfortunate because there is a real
need for one.
With its expensive pizza and
inconvenient hours — most of
Tresidder shuts down at midnight
and the Coffee House sharply
scales back its operations at that
time as well — Tresidder Union is
analogous to a bureaucracy, a large
and complicated building that is of
little use to students.
Other universities have real
student unions, why can't Stan
ford? The University and student
representatives should change this
situation.
Part of the problem is that
Tresidder has always been
assigned too many roles — roles
that don't fit in with the scope of
what a student union should be.
In addition to housing a cafeteria
and other dining services, the
building hosts the Office of Stu
dent Activities and a dean of stu
dents, the Computer Science
Department and a whole slew of
meeting rooms.
Over the years, students have
been promised that Tresidder
would be improved with additions
such as the now legendary Taco
Bell. However, the University has
failed to follow through and stu
dent leaders have done little to
press administrators on the issue.

A good start would be to take
advantage of the mechanisms
already in place. There is, in theo
ry, a Tresidder Advisory Board
that is supposed to represent stu
dent interests to the University on
this issue. However, according to
one of its student members, it has
yet to convene this year (in fact,
the student has yet to be contacted
regarding his position on the
board).
This is quite sad. Tresidder could
be a valuable resource if the Uni
versity were to study the issue
seriously and make some logical
changes. A few years ago, it
appeared that the University was
going to do just this — but we've
heard nothing on the issue for
awhile.
Student leaders should press
the University to once again focus
on this issue. Anyone who's taken
Econ 1 could tell you what the
solution to the problem of short
hours and high prices at Tresid
der is — the introduction of com
petition. With its University
sanctioned monopoly on Tresid
der food operations, Bon Appetit
— which operates the CoHo, Cor
ner Pocket and other Tresidder
dining choices — is sitting pretty,
with no competition and little
incentive to improve services or
cut prices. When Bon Appetit's
contract expires, the University
should try to encourage greater
competitive forces by bringing in
separate vendors who would be
more responsive to student dining
needs.
A few years ago, someone in
Tresidder management said that
students don't want a Taco Bell in
Tresidder. We would beg to differ,
but that's not important. What is
important is that the University
needs to recognize that students
— who make up a large part of
Tresidder's business — are not
being served by the current situa
tion. Whether students want a
Taco Bell is something for the free
market — not an out-of-touch
University bureaucracy — to
decide.
