Money should not be an incentive to advise

THE DAILY'S FRIDAY report on
the advising discussion in the Fac
ulty Senate badly misquoted me
and further misreported one of the main
points of the meeting: incentives for
advising.
At the meeting, I bragged shamelessly
about some high-quality advising service
to a senior. I was pointing out that the
best work undergraduates and faculty do
together is not elicited by incentives. You
reported this as "[Bresnahan] emphati
cally stated that no amount of money
could compel him to be a freshman advis

er." Sheesh! I've been a freshman adviser
as recently as last year and will be one
again in the future. You report me as in
favor of professional, specialist freshman
advisers, if compensation must be paid. I
did say that, with heavy emphasis on the
"if (I opposed compensation and favored
more faculty contact with freshmen in
that same sentence).
More importantly, The Daily was con
fused about the debate over incentives
for advising freshmen. The Daily thought
we opposed incentives because "compen
sation would divert funding that could be

better used elsewhere." Here's a clue â€”
when faculty object to higher pay to fac
ulty, the issue is not resource allocation.
Many faculty, who value advising
highly, objected to the advising report's
nonacademic definition of advising. In
the way the report seeks to encourage
more advising, it sees advising as social
rather than intellectual, as defined by a
bureaucracy, not by the schools and as
something that needs to be drawn from
faculty by incentives, not as an extension
of teaching. These are all implementa
tion mistakes. Almost all faculty who

opposed the incentives think advising is
important and most have been freshman
advisers. The debate was over means not
ends.
I myself think the report was full of
good ideas and that its goals are 100 per
cent right. One important goal is getting
more faculty / freshmen contact via
advising and other routes. There is a live
ly debate about how to do this. The right
way to do it definitely does not involve
moving faculty to a piece-rate pay scale.
