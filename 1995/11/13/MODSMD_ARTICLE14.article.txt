# Stanford could learn a few things from Harvard
## 
### 
We at Stanford often trumpet the
fact that we have been rated No. 1 in a
number of academic disciplines, but
most of America (and for that matter,
the world) thinks of Harvard when it
thinks of the best university in America
I think the time has come to admit it —
Stanford is still a provincial school with
neither the breadth of vision nor the
global scope that Harvard has.
No matter what Stanford says about
its "international" focus, it continues to
treat international students as second

and third-class citizens. For example, it
does not provide financial aid to inter
national students, but it does provide
aid to Americans. Stanford claims to be
"need-blind," but in all honesty it
should claim "need-blind for Americans,
discriminatory against needy interna
tional students." Harvard, on the other
hand, is truly need-blind and does not
discriminate on the basis of a student's
country of origin.
If Stanford expects international
alumni to "give back" to it in the form
of donations, it must first provide a rea
son as to why they should. As interna
tional students, we are not treated as
well as other students in that we are
denied financial aid and we were (until
recently) underrepresented on the
Board of Trustees. If Stanford is ever to

reach the stature of Harvard, we must
broaden our vision and see every stu
dent, especially an international stu
dent, as a future ambassador of Stan
ford and cease to discriminate against
internationals.
