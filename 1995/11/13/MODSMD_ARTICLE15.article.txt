# FRI's research is essential to growth of many countries
## 
### 
I was sorry to hear about a possible
"reorganization" of the Food Research
Institute. Scholars at the institute are
at the forefront of research on issues of

food policy in developing countries.
Eighty-five percent of population
growth for the 21st century is expected
to occur in these countries and massive
shortfalls of grain and other foods have
been predicted by early- to mid-century
for many parts of the world.
Research undertaken by FRI can
influence policy makers in both poor
and rich countries throughout the world
to confront issues of food security, pop
ulation growth and environmental
degradation. I would hope that Univer
sity administrators carefully consider all
possible alternatives to closing FRI. It
would be a shame to lose this valuable
resource.
