## The 						anatomy of a joke 
### 
HAVE YOU EVER wondered what
makes something funny funny?
Have you ever said to yourself,
"Jeez, why don't I know Brendan's secret
to being so damn funny, so that the girls
would flock to me too?" If the answer is
yes to either of these questions, today is
your lucky day — I have the answer.
Let me start with a reasonably good
joke as an example: How do you make a
hormone? Don't pay her! Most people
find this joke to be pretty amusing, but
why?
The answer is that there are three
essential parts to a joke that make it
funny. Each part on its own is insignifi
cant, but when all three are present, the
joke is funny.
The first part is that the punchline is
unexpected. When your brain heard the
question, "How do you make a hor
mone?" it most likely expected some biol
ogy jargon as the answer. "Don't pay her"
has nothing to do with hormones or biol
ogy in general, so your brain didn't even
consider it as an answer. Of course, "A
Pez dispenser!" would have been just as
unexpected, but that wouldn't have been
a funny punch line.
The reason for this is the second part
of the funny joke formula: The person
must come to some sort of realization
that isn't explicitly stated in the joke. In
my example, this happens when your
brain figures out that when I said "hor

mone," I actually meant "whore moan."
Granted, in this case it is not exactly a
great revelation, but this is by no stretch
of the imagination a sophisticated joke. If
I had said "A Pez dispenser!" your brain
wouldn't have been able to come to any
realization, so the joke would fail. If you
think about it, there are a plethora of
jokes that use this simple form of realiza
tion — namely innuendo and double
entendre.
The last part of the formula is much
less obvious. It is that the realization is
unexpected. In my example, you obvious
ly didn't expect "hormone" to mean
"whore moan," so the realization was
unpredictable. This may sound a lot like
the first part of the formula, but the two
are different. Before, it was the words
that were unexpected. Here, it is the
meaning of those words.
To clarify, consider this joke: What did
O.J. say to Judge Ito after the trial? "So,
can I get my cap and gloves back?" First,
did you expect him to bring up the cap
and gloves of all things? No. It passes the
first part of the formula. Is there a real
ization? Yes. It is that the cap and gloves
are actually O.J.'s, ergo, he is the killer.
Now, is this realization expected? No.
Even if he was going to mention the cap
and gloves, you don't expect him to give
away his dirty little secret.
However, if the punchline had been,
"Ha ha, I tricked you!" the joke isn't

funny because it fails the last part of the
formula. You don't expect O.J. to laugh
at Judge Ito and you realize he is admit
ting his guilt, but, based on this response,
you are not surprised at all by this real
ization.
Of course, I better mention that this
formula generally fits anything that is
funny, but anything that fits this formu
la is not necessarily funny. For example,
if you notice the guy sitting next to you
isn't breathing, you would probably be
surprised you noticed in the first place
and you would be shocked by the realiza
tion that he is dead. Yet, you wouldn't
keel over laughing.
Finally, there are just a couple other
important things about humor. First,
some things are just inherently funny,
like goats and third nipples (I can't wait
to see the letters in response to this!).
Second, all professors have to do in order
to be funny is swear or give the bird.
Obviously, when your math professor
says, "No, you are incorrectly assuming x
is rational, you f-ing moron," everyone
laughs. If, on the other hand, I say it, no
one lauehs.
