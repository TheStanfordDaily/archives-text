## 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Stanford Health Services Chief of Staff James
McGuire has announced his intention to resign and
accept academic and administrative posts at Har
vard University in early December.
McGuire, who also currently serves as associate
dean for clinical affairs and graduate medical edu
cation, will serve as the executive vice president of a
newly merged Harvard-affiliated physician group

that encompasses the Boston and Cambridge areas.
He has also accepted a position as an associate pro
fessor of medicine and will be teaching courses on
immunology and musculoskeletal diseases includ
ing arthritis, osteoporosis and other disorders.
McGuire said that while he will miss Stanford,
the move will provide new challenges for himself as
well as for SHS and Medical School staff members.
"I couldn't have been happier here," he said. But


McGuire
"this was a natural transition time
for me. ... I wanted to try a few
other things."
McGuire, 46, said the move
would give him the chance to run a
larger medical group and offer the
opportunity to do more experimen
tal musculoskeletal research. He
added that he would like to set up
musculoskeletal research centers
at various Harvard-affiliated hos
pitals.
Peter Van Etten, SHS president
and chief executive officer, praised
McGuire for his leadership abili
ties. "Jim made a very significant
contribution to Stanford, and he
will be missed.... It will be hard to

replace him because he did things
very well."
But McGuire said he is confi
dent his successors will continue to
move SHS in the right direction,
adding that an incredibly talented
pool of people will have the oppor
tunity to move forward with his
programs and to assume leader
ship roles.
McGuire first came to Stanford
eight years ago from the Universi
ty of Massachusetts where he was
a professor of cellular biology.
Since then, he has set up the Uni
versity's sports medicine program
as well lis a summer workshop for
Stanford undergraduates interest
ed in a career in medicine.
Three years ago, he and a Stan
ford undergraduate student
designed a scientific research and
clinical medicine ethics course that

is now offered each year in the
Medical School. He has also
coached the Stanford men's
lacrosse team for the past eight
years.
McGuire said, however, that he
will miss undergraduate academic
advising the most. But he may not
be gone for long.
"I look to return to Stanford
sometime in the near future," he
said. "I can't wait to come back
to see how things have devel
oped."
SHS administrators are cur
rently seeking McGuire's adminis
trative replacement. In the mean
time, his duties will be split four
ways among Dr. Peter Gregory,
chief medical officer, and associate
chiefs of staff Dr. Thomas McDon
ald, Dr. Walter Cannon and Dr.
Norman Shumwav.
