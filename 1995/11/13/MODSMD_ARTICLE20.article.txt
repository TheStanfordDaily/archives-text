# Symposium urges funds for arts

Discussing the implications of
cuts to the National Endowments
for the Arts and for the Humani
ties, two panelists criticized univer
sity presidents Friday for their lack
of support for the arts.
The symposium, held in the
Political Science Building, was
moderated by Janice Ross, a lectur
er in the Stanford Dance Division,
and sponsored by the President's
Committee on Culture and Cul
tures.
Panelist Douglas Greenberg,
president and director of the Chica
go Historical Society, said the aca
demic world has failed to make a
strong case for federal support for
cultural studies, and that this may
be one factor in recent congression
al budget reductions to the NEA
and NEH.
He added that if Congress had
threatened to reduce research dol
lars for the National Science Foun
dation, university presidents would
have immediately been in Wash
ington, D.C. to protest.
During their peak years, the
combined budgets of the NEH and
NEA were never more than about
$400 million. While the agencies
have survived complete elimina
tion, it was only with significant
cuts of approximately 40 percent of
their previous year's spending, he
said.

According to Greenberg, one
reason for the lack of interest in
the arts among academic leaders
is that the number of dollars at
stake is smaller when it comes
to cultural research, so it is
sometimes felt those areas of a
university that engage in such
work "can take care of them
selves."
He also noted that "there is a
growing gap between the arts and
humanities and those who lead
universities," Greenberg said.
"Once presidents were mostly
humanists and now they are
lawyers and social scientists."
Greenberg emphasized the
importance of the NEH, noting
that it provides the largest number
of fellowships for humanities schol
ars in the country. It also supports
exhibitions at the local and nation
al levels and promotes the use of
new technology, such as the preser
vation of work in digital format, he
said.
The net result of NEH support
is that it "allows humanistic
inquiry at all levels," said Green
berg.
Les Blank, an independent
documentary filmmaker who has
received NEH and NEA funding
for several of his films, showed
clips of his work at the sympo
sium. Without federal assis
tance, his documentaries on cul
tural celebrations in America

would not have been produced,
said Blank.
"These films full of vitality and
the human spirit would not be
made by the major studios," he
said.
While some claim private fund
ing should be sought instead,
Greenberg argued that donors
wouldn't be willing to support
many kinds of original work. The
national stature that NEA and
NEH funding places on a project
acts as a sort of "venture capital
for humanities" and helps elicit
private support, he said.
With regard to critics who argue
that the work done is obscene and
anti-American, he agreed that
some artists go too far. However,
that should not illegitimize art's
funding overall, just as the Navy's
Tailhook scandal did not mean that
defense spending should be elimi
nated, he said.
Responding to fiscal concerns,
Greenberg said the NEA and NEH
budgets are small enough that they
would have little effect on the bud
get deficit. Furthermore, in
response to claims that the Consti
tution doesn't mandate funding for
the arts, Greenberg said that many
agencies not explicitly required by
the Constitution are quite neces
sary.
"It is the duty of the present to
preserve the past for the future,"
Greenberg concluded.
