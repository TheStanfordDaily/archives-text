It took four overtime periods
and an inspired effort by an emo
tionally-charged Santa Clara
squad, but the Cardinal women's
soccer season came to a sudden
and heartbreaking conclusion last
Friday night at Santa Clara.
The Broncos' Mikka Hansen
scored on a close-range follow
shot in the 139 th minute to the
lift seventh-ranked Santa Clara
(15-3-2) to a dramatic 3-2 victory
over the visiting Cardinal (16-4
overall, 7-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) before a packed house of
2,857 at Buck Shaw Stadium,
capping an epic battle that lasted
nearly two-and-a-half hours.
The winning shot came three
minutes, 40 seconds into the sec
ond of two 15-minute sudden
death overtime periods (the first

two 15-minute overtimes failed to
produce a winner). Had neither
team scored during the fourth
and final overtime period, penalty
kicks would have decided the
match.
Instead, Hansen put a dramat
ic end to Stanford's championship
hopes when she gathered in a
rebounded shot and booted it past
sophomore midfielder F2lie Foster
and freshman goalie Erin Bryla
for the game-winning goal. Bron
co midfielder Samantha Obara's
previous shot attempt ricocheted
off the crossbar right to the junior
forward, who alertly converted
the loose ball for the score.
"Every time we play Santa
Clara, it's like this," said senior
sweeper Jessica Fischer. "They're
disruptive, and we're trying to
settle ourselves down, and it ends
up turning out to be just a big bat
tle — whoever wants it. It's
always gone to the wire."
Santa Clara now moves on to
play No. 10 Virginia in a second
round match at Charlottesville,
Va. Stanford, on the other hand,
