## Santa Clara squeaks on by women's soccer

It took four overtime periods
and an inspired effort by an emo
tionally-charged Santa Clara
squad, but the Cardinal women's
soccer season came to a sudden
and heartbreaking conclusion last
Friday night at Santa Clara.
The Broncos' Mikka Hansen
scored on a close-range follow
shot in the 139 th minute to the
lift seventh-ranked Santa Clara
(15-3-2) to a dramatic 3-2 victory
over the visiting Cardinal (16-4
overall, 7-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) before a packed house of
2,857 at Buck Shaw Stadium,
capping an epic battle that lasted
nearly two-and-a-half hours.
The winning shot came three
minutes, 40 seconds into the sec
ond of two 15-minute sudden
death overtime periods (the first

two 15-minute overtimes failed to
produce a winner). Had neither
team scored during the fourth
and final overtime period, penalty
kicks would have decided the
match.
Instead, Hansen put a dramat
ic end to Stanford's championship
hopes when she gathered in a
rebounded shot and booted it past
sophomore midfielder F2lie Foster
and freshman goalie Erin Bryla
for the game-winning goal. Bron
co midfielder Samantha Obara's
previous shot attempt ricocheted
off the crossbar right to the junior
forward, who alertly converted
the loose ball for the score.
"Every time we play Santa
Clara, it's like this," said senior
sweeper Jessica Fischer. "They're
disruptive, and we're trying to
settle ourselves down, and it ends
up turning out to be just a big bat
tle — whoever wants it. It's
always gone to the wire."
Santa Clara now moves on to
play No. 10 Virginia in a second
round match at Charlottesville,

will only reflect on what could
have been.
"I'm very proud of my team
and I'm very proud of the way
they fought," said head coach
lan Sawyers. "I think we've
come a long way. It's obviously a
very difficult time for the young
players to experience this kind of
atmosphere, this kind of result.
But if I was to lose a game, I
wouldn't want to lose it any
other way than the way that my
kids played."
A wild see-saw exchange of
scoring opportunities character
ized the first half of regulation.
Santa Clara appeared to take the
lead in the 10th minute when
Bryla leapt and batted down an
Erin Martinez shot attempt.
Bryla moved forward to pounce
on the loose ball but collided
with Obara. The ball then
squirted loose and Hansen
knocked it into the unguarded

net for what appeared to be a 1-
0 Bronco lead. But the goal was
nullified, however, when Obara
was called for obstruction.
"We didn't think there was a
foul there," said Bronco head
coach Jerry Smith. "I think it
was a fair challenge — Saman
tha and the goalkeeper battling
for a 50-50 ball — but it's the
referee's call to make."
Freshman midfielder Kelly
Adamson finally broke the score
less tie 14:12 into the second
half when she snuck between
two Santa Clara defenders and
converted on a pass from senior
Dena Dey. The score remained 1-
0 until the 80:09 mark, when
Obara beat Bryla to the left side
on a penalty kick. The free kick
was awarded after junior defend
er Suzie Boots tackled Martinez
illegally.
"I just think I shouldn't have
gone in in that situation," Boots
said. "That pretty much sums it
up."
With the score still knotted at
1-1 at the end of regulation, the
match moved to the first of two

15-minute overtime periods,
where the Cardinal soon found
itself pinned to the wall. With
only 2:48 remaining on the
clock, Hansen gave Santa Clara
its first lead of the night by run
ning onto a Dayna Smith pass in
the penalty box and lifting it
past a charging Bryla.
The 2-1 Bronco lead appeared
to spell doom for Stanford's sea
son. But instead, the Cardinal
came charging back to tie the
score just 52 seconds later, when
freshman midfielder Tracey
Lawyer scored her second goal of
the season on a 10-yard shot off
a rebound. Boots provided the
assist.
"In that situation, in over
time, it's already emotional a lot
of the time," Fischer said.
"We're thinking to shut them
down and just not get into a big
frenzy."
With the score tied 2-2 at the
end of one OT, the match moved
on to a second 15-minute over
time period, and then on to sud
den death, where Hansen finally
put an end to the thriller.

In spite of Friday's loss, the
Cardinal has plenty to be proud
of as it reflects back on the 1995
campaign. Stanford finished with
a 16-4 overall record, including
three victories over tournament
teams.
The women also posted a 7-0
Pac-10 record, earning itself the
conference championship in the
inaugural season of Pac-10 wo
men's soccer (the sport began in
1993 but took a hiatus during
the '94 season). Last but not
least, the Cardinal made its sixth
consecutive NCAA tournament
appearance, and third straight
under Sawyers.
"We have a lot of respect for
the Stanford team," Smith said.
"They're a hell of a team, and
they gave us a hell of a game today.
This was a game where we could
be sitting here at the end of our
season right now and they could
very easily be going to Virginia.
They're well-coached, well-orga
nized and have a lot of talent. It
took our best effort to sneak in
an overtime victory against
them."
