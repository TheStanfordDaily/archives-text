Entering last Saturday's match against Pacific,
the sixth-ranked Stanford men's water polo team
(14-9, 3-5 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
was more concerned with playing a solid game
than with notching a victory. But a win is always
nice, and the Cardinal can't help but be pleased
with its performance after steamrolling the No. 13
Tigers (8-18, 0-8 MPSF) 13-4 in Stockton.
"Going into the game, I was really looking for a
good effort from the guys," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "I wanted the guys to play focusing
on strong fundamentals and good execution. I
think that they really did all of the things that
they needed to do."
The players were even more enthusiastic about
their showing. "The game went just about as well
as it could have," said senior goalkeeper Jack
Bowen. "We came out strong and just took it to
them. We played a really solid game."
Senior Josh Leachman echoed Bowen's words.

"I'd say that it was the first time
in a long time, possibly in this
entire season, that we have put
together a complete game," he
said. "We played like a team. Peo
ple were looking to help each
other out. It just seemed like we
were a more cohesive unit than
we have been for awhile."
The Cardinal utilized a fierce
pressing defense that stifled
UOP's offense and generated a
plethora of scoring opportunities.
Numerous times, a Cardinal steal
interrupted a Tiger possession,
which in turn led to offensive mis
matches at the other end of the
pool as Stanford players beat their
men in transition.
"I thought that our defense
made a 180-degree turnaround
from where we have been,"
Bowen said. "Everybody was com
municating really well and the
guys were playing a good, press
ing defense. When our team plays
good defense, it gets us revved up,
and the guys take that with them

when they go down on offense."
"We were running a very effec
tive press, and they just started to
crack under the pressure of our
counterattack," Leachman said.
"The majority of our goals were
tied to the transition game."
In addition to outright break
away goals, the intense Cardinal
transition game helped to create
11 6-on-5 opportunities for Stan
ford. The Cardinal capitalized on
the man-up situations with
remarkable efficiency, scoring
eight points.
The counterattack may have
been the primary catalyst for the
offense, but the Cardinal would
not have been able to capitalize
on its opportunities without
improved execution and shoot
ing. Throughout the season,
Stanford has had good looks at
the goal but could not put the ball
in the net.
But after a week of specifically
concentrating on shooting in prac
tice, the Cardinal lit up the UOP
goalie. Junior Brian Wallin led the
Stanford charge, notching five
goals. Senior Daniel Lehoczky and
junior Tyrone Miller contributed
two goals apiece, while seniors

Dan Hancock and Brian Pyle,
junior Michael Rosenthal and
freshman Arturo Rodelo each
added a point.
While the resurgence of the
offense and the tightening of the
defense were encouraging, Stan
ford's biggest boost came from
the play of its reserves. Detta
manti had decided before the
game that he would substitute
liberally to give more of his play
ers some much-needed experi
ence. Dettamanti held true to his
plan, playing all 12 field players
who made the trip to Stockton. In
addition, junior Buzzy Spain
spelled Bowen in goal during the
fourth quarter.
The Cardinal will certainly
need contributions from its bench
during the grueling Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tour
ney, which will take place over
Thanksgiving weekend at Long
Beach State. In that event, Stan
ford will play against four top
ranked teams in the span of three
days.
"The guys coming off the
bench played really well Satur
day," Leachman said. "Our subs
are going to be crucial during the

MPSF tournament."
The victory over UOP also
served as a much-needed morale
boost for a Cardinal team coming
off a miserable road trip. During
that three-day journey, the Cardi
nal dropped three games, includ
ing demoralizing losses to Long
Beach State and UCLA.
With only one more regular
season game remaining before the
MPSF championship, the Cardi
nal is looking to turn things
around. An impressive victory,
such as the one against UOP,
might be just what the doctor
ordered.
"I feel like (the game against
UOP I was a good take-off point,"
Bowen said. "Going into the last
week of the season, it is good to
get some momentum going our
way."
Dettamanti agreed with his
goalie. "Pacific was not a great
challenge, but they are a pretty
decent team," he said. "This game
was really good because it provid
ed us with an opportunity to get
back on the winning track and to
get the team together. Now we
can aim for California and the
league championship."

the sixth-ranked Stanford men's water polo team
(14-9, 3-5 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
was more concerned with playing a solid game
than with notching a victory. But a win is always
nice, and the Cardinal can't help but be pleased
with its performance after steamrolling the No. 13
Tigers (8-18, 0-8 MPSF) 13-4 in Stockton.
"Going into the game, I was really looking for a
good effort from the guys," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "I wanted the guys to play focusing
on strong fundamentals and good execution. I
think that they really did all of the things that
they needed to do."
The players were even more enthusiastic about
their showing. "The game went just about as well
as it could have," said senior goalkeeper Jack
Bowen. "We came out strong and just took it to
them. We played a really solid game."
Senior Josh Leachman echoed Bowen's words.

Senior forward Dan Hancock rises above a UC-lrvine defender earlier in the Cardinal's
1995 campaign.

"I'd say that it was the first time
in a long time, possibly in this
entire season, that we have put
together a complete game," he
said. "We played like a team. Peo
ple were looking to help each
other out. It just seemed like we
were a more cohesive unit than
we have been for awhile."
The Cardinal utilized a fierce
pressing defense that stifled
UOP's offense and generated a
plethora of scoring opportunities.
Numerous times, a Cardinal steal
interrupted a Tiger possession,
which in turn led to offensive mis
matches at the other end of the
pool as Stanford players beat their
men in transition.
"I thought that our defense
made a 180-degree turnaround
from where we have been,"
Bowen said. "Everybody was com
municating really well and the
guys were playing a good, press
ing defense. When our team plays
good defense, it gets us revved up,
and the guys take that with them

when they go down on offense."
"We were running a very effec
tive press, and they just started to
crack under the pressure of our
counterattack," Leachman said.
"The majority of our goals were
tied to the transition game."
In addition to outright break
away goals, the intense Cardinal
transition game helped to create
11 6-on-5 opportunities for Stan
ford. The Cardinal capitalized on
the man-up situations with
remarkable efficiency, scoring
eight points.
The counterattack may have
been the primary catalyst for the
offense, but the Cardinal would
not have been able to capitalize
on its opportunities without
improved execution and shoot
ing. Throughout the season,
Stanford has had good looks at
the goal but could not put the ball
in the net.
But after a week of specifically
concentrating on shooting in prac
tice, the Cardinal lit up the UOP
goalie. Junior Brian Wallin led the
Stanford charge, notching five
goals. Senior Daniel Lehoczky and
junior Tyrone Miller contributed
two goals apiece, while seniors

Dan Hancock and Brian Pyle,
junior Michael Rosenthal and
freshman Arturo Rodelo each
added a point.
While the resurgence of the
offense and the tightening of the
defense were encouraging, Stan
ford's biggest boost came from
the play of its reserves. Detta
manti had decided before the
game that he would substitute
liberally to give more of his play
ers some much-needed experi
ence. Dettamanti held true to his
plan, playing all 12 field players
who made the trip to Stockton. In
addition, junior Buzzy Spain
spelled Bowen in goal during the
fourth quarter.
The Cardinal will certainly
need contributions from its bench
during the grueling Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tour
ney, which will take place over
Thanksgiving weekend at Long
Beach State. In that event, Stan
ford will play against four top
ranked teams in the span of three
days.
"The guys coming off the
bench played really well Satur
day," Leachman said. "Our subs
are going to be crucial during the

MPSF tournament."
The victory over UOP also
served as a much-needed morale
boost for a Cardinal team coming
off a miserable road trip. During
that three-day journey, the Cardi
nal dropped three games, includ
ing demoralizing losses to Long
Beach State and UCLA.
With only one more regular
season game remaining before the
MPSF championship, the Cardi
nal is looking to turn things
around. An impressive victory,
such as the one against UOP,
might be just what the doctor
ordered.
"I feel like (the game against
UOP I was a good take-off point,"
Bowen said. "Going into the last
week of the season, it is good to
get some momentum going our
way."
Dettamanti agreed with his
goalie. "Pacific was not a great
challenge, but they are a pretty
decent team," he said. "This game
was really good because it provid
ed us with an opportunity to get
back on the winning track and to
get the team together. Now we
can aim for California and the
league championship."
