Entering last Saturday's match against Pacific,
the sixth-ranked Stanford men's water polo team
(14-9, 3-5 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
was more concerned with playing a solid game
than with notching a victory. But a win is always
nice, and the Cardinal can't help but be pleased
with its performance after steamrolling the No. 13
Tigers (8-18, 0-8 MPSF) 13-4 in Stockton.
"Going into the game, I was really looking for a
good effort from the guys," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "I wanted the guys to play focusing
on strong fundamentals and good execution. I
think that they really did all of the things that
they needed to do."
The players were even more enthusiastic about
their showing. "The game went just about as well
as it could have," said senior goalkeeper Jack
Bowen. "We came out strong and just took it to
them. We played a really solid game."
Senior Josh Leachman echoed Bowen's words.
