### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
Despite running through the
muck and pouring rain of Wood
land, Wash., both the Stanford
men's and women's cross country
teams emerged with clean, auto
matic bids to the NCAA Champi
onships in Ames, lowa on Nov. 20.
By finishing first and second in
the NCAA District 8 Regional
Championships, respectively, the
Cardinal men and women earned
the right to run for the national
crown. It was the first time the
men won the district title. Mean
while, the women have now qual
ified for the third consecutive sea
son. Only the top two teams from
each district meet advance to
NCAAs.
Despite the extra mileage
(10,000 meters compared to the
8,000 the men run in races during

the season), the men put together
one of their best efforts of the
year. The third-ranked Cardinal
placed five runners in the top 20,
allowing it to edge Pacific 10 Con
ference rival Oregon by a score of
53-69. Junior Greg Jimmerson
paced Stanford once again as he
took fourth place in a time of 30
minutes, 35 seconds. Sophomore
Nathan Nutter followed in sev
enth place, running the course in
30:48. Junior J.J. White crossed
the line in 31:07, good for 10th.
Senior Mark Fadil and freshman
Brent Hauser posted times of
31:23 and 31:24, respectively,
rounding out the group at 17th
and 18th.
"Our theme all year was to be a
tough, competitive team," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "This
was our best race of the season.
