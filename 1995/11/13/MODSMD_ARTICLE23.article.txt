# Men 1st, women 2nd
## Both running teams off to NCAAs 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
Despite running through the
muck and pouring rain of Wood
land, Wash., both the Stanford
men's and women's cross country
teams emerged with clean, auto
matic bids to the NCAA Champi
onships in Ames, lowa on Nov. 20.
By finishing first and second in
the NCAA District 8 Regional
Championships, respectively, the
Cardinal men and women earned
the right to run for the national
crown. It was the first time the
men won the district title. Mean
while, the women have now qual
ified for the third consecutive sea
son. Only the top two teams from
each district meet advance to
NCAAs.
Despite the extra mileage
(10,000 meters compared to the
8,000 the men run in races during

the season), the men put together
one of their best efforts of the
year. The third-ranked Cardinal
placed five runners in the top 20,
allowing it to edge Pacific 10 Con
ference rival Oregon by a score of
53-69. Junior Greg Jimmerson
paced Stanford once again as he
took fourth place in a time of 30
minutes, 35 seconds. Sophomore
Nathan Nutter followed in sev
enth place, running the course in
30:48. Junior J.J. White crossed
the line in 31:07, good for 10th.
Senior Mark Fadil and freshman
Brent Hauser posted times of
31:23 and 31:24, respectively,
rounding out the group at 17th
and 18th.
"Our theme all year was to be a
tough, competitive team," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "This
was our best race of the season.
We had been training all year for
the 10,000, and now we have our
guys peaking at the right time."
The women's 5,000 meter race
provided intense drama, not so
much because of the torrential
downpour, but because Stanford
and Arizona went down to the
wire trying to secure the second
automatic berth.
Oregon won the race easily
with 37 points. Stanford, mean
while, placed four runners in the
top 25. That proved to be the dif
ference in edging Arizona 71-75.
Freshman sensation Mary Cobb
led the way with a fourth-place
performance, running the mud
ridden course in 17:09.
"She ran a very smart, very
composed race," Lananna said.

Junior Monal Chokshi placed
sixth, crossing the finish line in
17:20. Sophomore Sarna Renfro
followed next for the Cardinal,
finishing 12th in a time of 17:34.
Junior Leila Burr and sophomore
Ann Sheehy rounded out Stan
ford's top five with times of 17:57
and 18:11 while taking 23rd and
30th place, respectively.
"Our women did a great job,"
Lananna said. "They knew they
had to finish second and they
went out and did it. This was a lit
tle bit better than the Pac-10
race."
Lananna added that to have
both teams qualify spoke volumes
about the Cardinal program.
"There are 275 men's teams
and 278 women's teams in Divi
sion I. To qualify [for nationals]
means you're automatically con
sidered one of the top 22. That in
itself is a tribute to the athletes
here."
