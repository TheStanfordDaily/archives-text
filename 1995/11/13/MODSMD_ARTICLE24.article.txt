Unable to counter Penn
State's tremendous corner plays,
Stanford field hockey concluded a
stellar season with a 5-0 loss in
the first round of the NCAA play
offs last Thursday.
The Stanford women played
stifling defense in the first half of
the contest, holding the Nittany

turf.
The 5-0 score did not accurate

"That shot shouldn't even
have gone in," Johnson said. "My
team played really well. It wasn't
a 5-0 Igame]."
In addition, Stanford managed
