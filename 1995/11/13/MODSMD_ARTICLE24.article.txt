Unable to counter Penn
State's tremendous corner plays,
Stanford field hockey concluded a
stellar season with a 5-0 loss in
the first round of the NCAA play
offs last Thursday.
The Stanford women played
stifling defense in the first half of
the contest, holding the Nittany
Lions scoreless until one minute,
58 seconds remained in the first
period. Penn State exhibited
some of the inconsistency that
coach Sheryl Johnson had antici
pated, failing to chase down the
ball and often hitting out of
bounds.
However, Penn State respond
ed by knocking in two quick cor
ner shots, the second with 25 sec
onds left in the half. The first
came from Jen Coletta. As expect
ed, the senior midfielder, Penn
State's leading scorer with a total
of 27 goals this year, got the ball
rolling for the Lady Lions. The

two scores enabled the Lady
Lions to take the lead and control
the game.
"They started to gain momen
tum," Johnson said.
The Cardinal was unable to
stop the quick penalty shooting of
the Lady Lions. Penn State uti
lized the continuity of the Astro
turf to smoothly and sharply
knock in goals.
"The turf definitely made a dif
ference," Johnson said.
The Lady Lions went on to put
in two more shots off penalty cor
ners that Stanford could not
answer.
"They just executed them real
ly well," Johnson said. She
attributed the slow reaction time
of her players to the increased
speed of the ball on the artificial
turf.
The 5-0 score did not accurate
ly reflect Stanford's level of play,
however. Not counting the corner
goals, Penn State only registered
one shot, which resulted from a
scramble at the goal.
"That shot shouldn't even
have gone in," Johnson said. "My
team played really well. It wasn't
a 5-0 Igame]."
In addition, Stanford managed
several close shots that could

have evened the score. The Cardi
nal competed at the top of its
game, and despite the hype sur
rounding its freshman recruits,
Stanford seniors combined for
most of the attempted shots.
The three seniors, center mid
fielder Elise Morgan, left wing
Jennifer Glueck and sweeper
Leah Jacobs, each attempted one
shot. But last week's contest was
a group effort â€” every Cardinal
player checked into the game and
played her hardest.
Indeed, goalie Kelly Naylor
went the distance with a broken
thumb that she had incurred dur
ing warm-ups. Post-game x-rays
confirmed the injury.
"It was really exciting to play

in an NCAA game, and I think it
was something that we will all
look back on and feel proud
about," Glueck said. "And even
though we lost, we had a great
season and grew as a team.
"I'm really glad that this sea
son was my last. It was a real
honor to work with each and every
individual on the team, and I
learned from every one of them."
Last season, the Cardinal fin
ished last in the Northern Pacific
Conference only to come back this
year with new faces and a new
attitude. Stanford reached the
NCAA playoffs for the first time
in four years by ousting rival Cal
ifornia, gave Penn State a run for
its money and showed the NCAA
what it can expect in the future.
"We have a very young team
and the success we've had this
year can only get better," John
son said.
