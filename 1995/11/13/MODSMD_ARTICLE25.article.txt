# Cal, Nebraska frozen
## Swimmers sweep 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
The No. 2 Cardinal men's
swimming team dove into the
new season this past Thursday
and Saturday with its first two
dual meets against No. 8 Califor
nia and No. 24 Nebraska. As
expected, the Cardinal started
the season on a good note, blow
ing both teams out of the water
at deGuerre Pool.
Against Cal, Stanford jumped
off to a quick start, placing first
and second in the first three
events and never giving the Bears
a chance to close the gap. On the
way to a 133-97 victory, the Car
dinal swam the last four events
unofficially. Senior Ray Carey
and junior Kevin Radvany won
two events apiece, and freshman
Tate Blahnik emerged as one of
the early surprises of the season
with a victory in the 200-yard
backstroke and a good leg on the
victorious 400-yard medley relay
team. Radvany and seniors Scott
Gagner and Eric Diehl teamed up
to sweep the top three places in
the 500-yard freestyle.
Cardinal swimmers captured
eight of the nine official events.
Winners included Blahnik and
sophomores Tom Wilkens, Sabir
Muhammad and Scott Claypool
in the 400-yard medley relay;
Gagner in the 200-yard freestyle;
Radvany in the 1650-yard
freestyle and the 500-yard
freestyle; Carey in the 400-yard
individual medley and the 200-
yard butterfly; Claypool in the
100-yard freestyle; and Blahnik
in the 200-yard back.
As in the Cal meet, the Cardi
nal ran away from the outset
against Nebraska, notching a
141-81 victory. Stanford won
each of the first nine events
before withdrawing all swimmers
from the 10th event and swim
ming unofficially in the last five.
Of those first nine events, Cardi
nal swimmers placed first, second
and third in all but two. Junior
Scott Jones won two events, and
Blahnik came through with
another victory, this time in the
100-yard backstroke.

The Cardinal winners includ
ed sophomore Muhammad in the
100-yard butterfly, Blahnik,
junior Phil Trinidad in the 100-
yard breaststroke, Radvany in
the 1000-yard freestyle, Jones in
the 100- and 200-yard freestyle,
sophomore Chris Olson in the
50-yard freestyle, Wilkens in the
200-yard individual medley and
Carey in the 200-yard butterfly.
"It was a wonderful starting
point for the year," said senior
Scott Gagner. "We surprised our
selves at how well we can do.
We've been training really hard,
but we managed to put all of that
aside and swim some really
tough races."
One of the most important
functions of the first meets of the
year is that while they give the
upperclassmen a chance to
regain a feel for the water, they
provide the first opportunity for
the freshmen to see what colle
giate competition is going to be
like. And the freshmen stepped
up to provide one of the first
pleasant surprises of the season.
Freshmen Matt O'Mara, Tate
Blahnik, Dan Schultz, Blake
Holden and Dod Wales each
placed first, second or third in at
least one event in the two meets.
The biggest surprise was Blahnik
in the 100- and 200-yard back
stroke. Blahnik will try to fill the
gap that backstroker Brian Ret
terer left after graduating.
"[Blahnik] had a lot of confi
dence, and it's great to hear him
talking about big goals," Gagner
said. "We had a gap to fill and he
stepped up to fill that gap."
Finally, the meets served as
Stanford's first mid only tune-up
for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, which will take
place Nov. 25-27 in Ixmg Beach.
The Pac-lOs are usually in the
winter a few weeks before the
NCAAs. This year, because the
Olympic trials will be held at the
time when the Pac-lOs are usual
ly held, the conference champi
onship is in the fall. "People
know that they'll have to perform
well very soon," Gagner said.
"They took these opportunities
and made the most of them."
