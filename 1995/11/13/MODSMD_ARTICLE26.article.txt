USA 100
Stanford 63

America hopes the best women's basketball team in the world
stepped on the Maples Pavilion floor last Friday night. For a third of
the game, Stanford, not the USA National Team, more closely fit that

description.
In the end, the USA rolled to a 100-63 victory after a dominant sec
ond half. Early on, the USA seemed flustered by the pre-game festivi
ties celebrating the return of former (and likely future) Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer and two leaders of Stanford's first NCAA-title
team, Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding.
Stanford quickly sprinted to a 17-8 advantage with a small, quick
starting lineup. After destroying its first three opponents on its 20-
team NCAA tour, the national team finally took the lead for good
against the Cardinal with just under four minutes remaining in the
first half.
Cardinal sophomore Olympia Scott, a surprise starter at center,
neutralized the athletic Lisa Leslie despite a three-inch height disad
vantage. Scott made 10 trips to the free-throw line before halftime,
while the USA only went eight times as a team.
Another mild surprise in the starting five, sophomore forward
Vanessa Nygaard, displayed great shooting touch and her trademark
intensity with 10 first-half points.
Meanwhile, junior All-American candidate Kate Starbird shined in
transition and from outside. The twosome combined for 25 first-half
points on 10-of-12 shooting as the Cardinal kept pace with its former
coach.
"I kind of feel like we're a bully that doesn't fight until we get a
bloody nose," VanDerveer said.
The USA's superior talent, conditioning and depth made the differ
ence in the second half. In the first eight minutes, 32 seconds after the
break, the USA raced to a 23-4 run. Despite a roster of only nine avail
able players, no American played more than 26 minutes. On the other
hand, Starbird and point guard Jamila Wideman almost went the dis
tance.
"I'd love to talk about the first half," Wideman said. "I feel like I
don't know what hit us [in the second]."
The junior spark plug generated some spectacular drives with the
shot clock winding down en route to an eight-point, four-assist perfor
mance.
Cardinal interim head coach Amy Tucker expressed little surprise
with the final outcome but enjoyed the poise her squad exhibited
against its former coach.
"I thought we played well in the first half," Tucker said. "But we
had a complete meltdown in the second half."
Azzi and Steding aided the melting process with 10 points apiece, as
only two USA players missed scoring in double figures. Azzi was thrust
into the starting lineup for the first time due, in part, to an injury to
point guard and former Virginia standout Dawn Staley. The team
mates on the 32-1 Cardinal squad that captured the 1990 NCAA title
received standing ovations in the pre-game festivities and especially
when VanDerveer sat them down in the closing minutes.
Gunner Ruthie Bolton-Holifield paced the USA with 16 points,
including two bombs from over 25 feet. Leslie ended with 15 and lead
ing rebounder Katrina McClain of Georgia garnered 12 points and 10
rebounds.
Starbird's 19 led all scorers, and in transition, the graceful junior
showed she could clearly play with the best.
The Cardinal's performance Friday night indicated great potential
but also the need for improvement. Besides Starbird and Wideman,
Cardinal players were playing for the opportunity to start or gain play
ing time.
But Friday night was not about future expectations. Friday was a
night to celebrate the best America can offer, a night to enjoy the
return of Cardinal legends to their home and a night that most of the
7,391 on hand and the participants will not soon forget.
"I don't want to make them feel old, but they're kind of like role
models," Nygaard said. "I was really honored just to be on the floor
with them."
