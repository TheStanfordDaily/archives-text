## 
### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
Does guaranteed scholarship money
sound too good to be true? It probably is.
A classified advertisement appearing in
the Nov. 1 issue of The Stanford Daily of
fered to make available financial services to
students who called a toll-free number.
These services were offered by a company ti

tied AIM, or Academic Investment Money.
According to Stanford Police, the company's
scholarship services are a scam.
"Their aim — AIM — is to rip you off,"
said Stanford Police Capt. Ilaoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said a student called the 800
number and talked to a representative from
the company. When the representative
asked the student for checking
account and credit card numbers,
the student became suspicious.
Stanford Police were called in to
investigate the company, and
Detective Mark Swineford allied
the number and asked to speak to
the chief executive officer. He iden
tified himself as a police officer and
the company immediately hung up
on him, Niemeyer said.
A University official in the Pres
ident's Office then called the num
ber and was told to write to an
address in Grand Rapids, Mich.
Niemeyer said the address was
phony.
Swineford called the Better
Business Bureau in Michigan and
eave them the 800 number and the

name of the company. The bureau
had a long list of reports and com
plaints about the company,
Niemeyer said.
"These people are boiler-room
people — scammers," Niemeyer
said. "They get unsuspecting stu
dents or clients.to give them check
ing account or credit card numbers
or they charge a membership fee
right away. They then don't do
anything for you."
These scholarship scams are
quite common, and students
should be aware of any company or
advertisement offering guaranteed
financial aid or scholarship money.
A World Wide Web site on finan
cial aid scams recently listed nine
warning signals that should make
students suspicious of an offer.
Among them are:
• Any scholarship that requires
application fees, offers guaranteed
winnings or advertises that anyone

is eligible.
• Advertisements that have typ
ing or spelling errors, give a box
number or residential address as a
return address or ask applicants to
respond quickly.
• Companies that are unestab
lished, ask for personal informa
tion such as credit card or social
security numbers or notify by
phone.
Some common scams are schol
arships with an application fee,
low-interest loans that require a
student to pay money before receiv
ing the loan, scholarship prizes
that require students to pay money
before the prize is released and
scholarship search services that
guarantee winnings.
A student encountering a ques
tionable scholarship services
should bring all literature and cor
respondence to the University's
Financial Aids Office.
