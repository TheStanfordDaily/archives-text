## 1995-96 directory released

Stanford's operators can now breathe
easier. With the delivery of the Stanford Di
rectory tomorrow, students will no longer
have to trouble them with incessant queries.
The Directory's format remains the
same, but the number of pages has been in
creased and all information has been revised
for easier access, according to Steven Rosen
baum, 1995-96 project director.
The Directory is a yearly project which

carries almost every faculty member and
student's phone number and provides a
guide to the University's resources and ac
tivities.
This year marks the first time the Direc
tory has been published under the auspices
of the ASSU instead of through the Office of
Student Activities. Rosenbaum said he sees
the transition as a natural extension of the
ASSU's student services.
"We really want this to be a
resource so that when people want
to know about Stanford Universi
ty, they look here first," Rosen
baum said. "The ASSU is really
supportive of our efforts."
In other changes, the Universi
ty Information Guide has been
completely reorganized, Rosen
baum said. Instead of categorizing
resources under different head
ings, information is alphabetized
in the table of contents, allowing

for easier usage.
New full-color maps of sur
rounding cities and San Francisco
have been designed and include
indexes of local streets. These
maps will be updated in future edi
tions.
"We have bigger and better
maps," Directory Graphic Design
er Kristen Meinhold said. "You'll
see an expanded and more useful
full-color map section, including a
really nice map of the University
itself." The University map has
also been flipped on its head for the
first time — with north pointing
up as opposed to down.
Undergraduate distribution will

begin tomorrow, with the directo
ries delivered directly to student
residences. Off-campus under
graduates will receive a postcard in
the mail which can be exchanged
at the ASSU office for directories.
Faculty and graduate students can
pick up their copies from their aca
demic department's administra
tors.
The Directory includes a dining
guide, a yellow pages section of
local businesses and a coupons sec
tion.
"We sold over $426,000 in
advertisements — an increase of
over 26 percent from last year,"
Rosenbaum said.
