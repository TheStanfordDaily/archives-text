Stanford's operators can now breathe
easier. With the delivery of the Stanford Di
rectory tomorrow, students will no longer
have to trouble them with incessant queries.
The Directory's format remains the
same, but the number of pages has been in
creased and all information has been revised
for easier access, according to Steven Rosen
baum, 1995-96 project director.
The Directory is a yearly project which

carries almost every faculty member and
student's phone number and provides a
guide to the University's resources and ac
tivities.
This year marks the first time the Direc
tory has been published under the auspices
of the ASSU instead of through the Office of
Student Activities. Rosenbaum said he sees
the transition as a natural extension of the
ASSU's student services.
