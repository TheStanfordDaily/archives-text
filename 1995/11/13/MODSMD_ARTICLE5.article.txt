# Village renovations proving satisfactory
## EV residents content after year's housing reforms 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
In sharp contrast to previous years, the
residents of Escondido Village seem content
this fall with the University's response to
years of student complaints about deterio
rating facilities and the aging of Escondido.
One year ago, the University began to
make major revisions in its housing policy.
The move included implementing a new
timetable for improving Escondido mainte
nance services, developing a student review
group to oversee the cleaning and inspection
processes, addressing the aging of the old
apartments and reevaluating rent dispari
ties among tenants in the unrenovated
apartments.
Resident complaints, which had accumu
lated for years, prompted the University's
response. Last fall, some residents were so
enraged with the housing conditions in Es
condido that they took their complaints to
the top, demanding meetings with Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds and other housing officials.
"We've made a lot of progress" since last
year's revisions were put in place, said
Assoc. Director of Housing and Dining Ser
vices Rodger Whitney. Student reaction is
"very solid and positive" to the new changes,
he said.
One area of progress that is particularly
appealing to residents is the renovation
timetable for old apartments. To date, more

than one-third of Escondido has been reno
vated. In fact, about 35 percent of the units
are now renovated — a figure that places the
University ahead of schedule, Whitney said.
"Our goal is to complete the Capital Im
provement Project I for Escondido] in eight
years," he said. "We're in the fourth year
now and we're in an accelerated phase of the
project.".
The CIP is the University's 12-year plan

to renovate old housing facilities
as well as construct new resi
dences. Other areas renovated
under the CIP include undergrad
uate dormitories Wilbur Hall and
Stern Hall.
Debbie Wood, a new resident in
Escondido, said she was very
pleased to find that her apartment
had been renovated upon arrival.
Wayne Pitcher, a first-year
graduate student in chemistry who
lives in one of the Escondido high
rises, said his apartment is still in
" '60s shape" and furnished with
the same old green vinyl sofa. "It
was fairly clean though," he said.
According to Graduate Apart
ment Facilities Manager Lynn
Click, the University has renovat
ed other complexes ahead of
Pitcher's building because the
apartment renovations have been
"prioritized by a worst-first"
schedule, which she said was a
common practice in most renova
tion projects.
Aside from complete renova
tions, however, all of the apart
ments have undergone some
improvement. For example, the
University has installed new
refrigerators in all Escondido
apartments, ahead of the CIP
schedule. With a few exceptions,
all of the Escondido low-rise
apartments have also been
equipped with new stoves, said
Whitney.
Cleaning standards
Past resident woes concerning
the cleanliness of the apartments
and the flexibility of residents
moving in and out have also been
addressed.
Protocols are in place which
help to minimize the problems
when old residents move out and
new ones move in, Whitney said.
The University is maintaining its
cleaning standards while still
enabling the students to have a
great deal of flexibility in their
moves, he added.
According to Whitney, resident
feedback is positive. Surveys have
indicated that the University has
significantly improved the hous
ing conditions in Escondido, as
compared with the situation
before last year's revisions. "On a
scale of one to five, [Facilities] is
receiving a four to five mark
now," he said.

Jim Hansen, last year's chair of
the former Escondido Village
Family Council and a leading fig
ure in the outrage over housing
problems, said this year is "light
years" ahead of the past.
"There's been an earthquake,"
he said.
According to Hansen, renova
tion dates in the past were ridicu
lous, often coinciding with
midterms and precluding a stu
dent's temporary move, he said.
"This fall, we're finally seeing the
benefits of the changes that were
made last year," he said.
Chris Shockman, another pro
ponent for housing changes, con
firmed that the housing situation
is getting better.
"Last year, we thought we were
abandoned by Housing," she said.
The University has brought in
some very competent people,
though, particularly Graduate
Facilities Supervisor Teresa Rise
borough and graduate CIP liaison
Glenn Carroll, who have focused

'On a scale of one to
five, [Facilities] is
receiving a four to

more attention on day-to-day
maintenance, she said.
Smadar Schiffman, a resident
in Escondido, said there has been a
"great improvement in facilities."
Allowing residents to notify hous
ing of maintenance problems over
e-mail was a good idea, she said.
"The response to fix-it requests
has been a lot better too."
Village reviewed
Last fall, Director of Graduate
Residences Christine Griffith said
Housing and Dining Services was
also in the process of forming a
Village Operations Review Group
to allow administrators to work
with students on issues such as
cleaning, maintenance and reno
vation schedules. Griffith con
firmed that this group was formed
last November and started meet
ing regularly soon after.
The review group consists of
students and staff, including
Facilities and maintenance per
sonnel, Griffith said. After meet
ing last fall and evaluating the
faults of the housing system, the

group formulated several recom
mendations for improving Escon
dido.
Among their suggestions was
that Housing Services establish
better cleaning and maintenance
standards which would include
annual inspections of the apart
ments, she said.
"We implemented the recom
mendations," Griffith said. Last
winter some members of the
review group accompanied the
administrators on their inspection
of the apartments and the "group
feedback was good," Griffith said.
"Maintenance and cleaning stan
dards were met."
According to Whitney, this
group is an "ongoing working
group that will (continue to] over
see the cleaning of the apart
ments."
Kathy Eisenhut, a member of
the Village Operations Review
Group who attended some of the
inspections last winter, said the
apartments were clean then. How
ever, Eisenhut said she has not
met with the group this fall, nor
has anyone contacted her about
meetings or inspections. She
added that she is planning to con
tact someone soon about the sta
tus of the group.
According to Hansen, it's
important to remember that the
University is not giving the resi
dents any services they do not
deserve. These improvements are
issues of basic maintenance, he
said.
Cost of living
Another concern for many resi
dents of Escondido over the past
few years has been the high rent
they must pay for such inadequate
living conditions. Part of this out
rage has subsided since the recent
renovations made to some of the
apartments, but some Escondido
residents feel that University poli
cy should address the discrepan
cies among apartments.
"I pay the same rent [for my
renovated apartment], and this
place has to be worth $100 more,"
said Hansen, who lives in a reno
vated low-rise family apartment
in Escondido.
The condition of an unrenovat
ed apartment in Escondido is com
parable to that of a "slum," he
said.
Pitcher, who just moved from
an apartment in Cambridge,
Mass., to study at Stanford,
agreed with Hansen, saying he
also felt that it was inappropriate

that he pay the same for his
unrenovated apartment as
Hansen pays for a renovated unit.
Pitcher said, however, that the
difference is not a major point of
contention for him.
"I'm fairly happy with where I
live now, but I wouldn't want to
live on campus next year unless I
moved into [a nicer place like]
Rains with some of my friends,"
Pitcher said.
He added that he also tries to
focus on the benefits of living in
the high rise. "It's on campus,
close to everything, on the 11th
floor, and positioned to a great
view," he said.
The idea of establishing a hier
archy of rent according to quality
of apartment is not a new thought
for the University, Whitney said.
He explained, however, that the
University is not considering a
rent change with the CIP almost
halfway to completion.
Housing Services has tried to
lessen the discrepancies among
apartments in lieu of full renova
tions, Whitney said. Escondido is
now completely wired for cable
and Ethernet connections, and
some unrenovated apartments
have had new stoves and refriger
ators installed, he added.
Other problems and concerns
Although residents' outrage is
slowly dissipating in terms of
housing conditions, there are
other problems that plague the
Escondido community.
Hansen said he believes that
opportunity costs are prohibiting

the University from addressing
other pertinent issues. One of
Hansen's major concerns is the
lead paint and asbestos problem
that affects Escondido residents.
The policy is conservative in a
pocketbook sense, he explained.
The lead and asbestos "is only
removed by request."
According to Hansen, residents
in the past had to contact Janet
Gleason, the health and safety
systems coordinator, in order to
have it removed.
This process is becoming more
complicated now that Housing
Services has lost Gleason. Accord
ing to Glick, Gleason left Stanford
about two or three months ago for
another job. Housing Services is in
the process of hiring a new person
to fill the position, Whitney said.
Housing Energy Management
Center Coordinator Mike Guthrie
has assumed Gleason's responsi
bility for now, said Glick. To have
the lead and asbestos removed,
residents must call their housing
supervisor, who will then contact
Guthrie to have it removed.
The most recent housing facili
ties statement posted to the resi
dents this month indicated that
target goals in this new fiscal year
include a focus on the asbestos
ceilings which remain in the low
rise family apartments.
According to Hansen, however,
the University will handle this
issue in the same way it deals with
any other issue — at what he
called a "bureaucratic pace." He
said he encourages residents to
get free lead testing of their apart

ments in the meantime.
"We have children here and
they will be exposed," Hansen
said.
Shockman said she is also con
cerned about the lead. It's impos
sible to communicate to a little
child what parts of the house they
can touch and which parts they
can't, she said.
"All lead that extends to the 48-
to 52-inch level should be obliter
ated" regardless of cost, she said.
Shockman added that better
forms of education, besides the
long notification letter written in
English that is currently circulat
ed, should be in place in order to
better communicate the harms of
the lead paint to the international
students in Escondido.
"Once all of the apartments are
renovated, everything will be okay
though," she said.
Although Hansen concedes
that residents are not rallying
behind a cause right now, he
believes that a few pertinent
issues besides asbestos will be
coming up in the future. Parking
and sidewalk problems seem to be
the new concerns, he said.
Shockman said she agreed that
parking has been a "big issue" for
Escondido.
"People will have cars [at Stan
ford! without a regional mass
transit system and nothing Pve
heard of [including this fall's latest
parking plan! addresses the fact
that in some places there are just
more people than spaces," he said.
"The biggest item of the new
plan is to keep working on it,
though," said Schiffman, who was
one of the members of the parking
committee formulated last year to
address the parking issue. This
year's plan is the first step toward
a "global" solution, she said. "I'm
glad to see a different attitude
being taken by the University."
Hansen also said that in the
future residents will rally for solu
tions that address the dangers of
Olmsted Road to parents walking
with their children. Olmsted Road
is the outlet road that surrounds
Escondido that connects drivers
to both Stanford Avenue and
Serra Street.
"At least once a month, some
one reports almost being hit on
that road because there are no
sidewalks," he explained.
Whether these issues will rally
residents together in another
organized effort for change, such
as the Escondido Village Family
Council, remains to be seen.

Among their suggestions was
that Housing Services establish
better cleaning and maintenance
standards which would include
annual inspections of the apart
ments, she said.
"We implemented the recom
mendations," Griffith said. Last
winter some members of the
review group accompanied the
administrators on their inspection
of the apartments and the "group
feedback was good," Griffith said.
"Maintenance and cleaning stan
dards were met."
According to Whitney, this
group is an "ongoing working
group that will (continue to] over
see the cleaning of the apart
ments."
Kathy Eisenhut, a member of
the Village Operations Review
Group who attended some of the
inspections last winter, said the
apartments were clean then. How
ever, Eisenhut said she has not
met with the group this fall, nor
has anyone contacted her about
meetings or inspections. She
added that she is planning to con
tact someone soon about the sta
tus of the group.
According to Hansen, it's
important to remember that the
University is not giving the resi
dents any services they do not
deserve. These improvements are
issues of basic maintenance, he
said.
Cost of living
Another concern for many resi
dents of Escondido over the past
few years has been the high rent
they must pay for such inadequate
living conditions. Part of this out
rage has subsided since the recent
renovations made to some of the
apartments, but some Escondido
residents feel that University poli
cy should address the discrepan
cies among apartments.
"I pay the same rent [for my
renovated apartment], and this
place has to be worth $100 more,"
said Hansen, who lives in a reno
vated low-rise family apartment
in Escondido.
The condition of an unrenovat
ed apartment in Escondido is com
parable to that of a "slum," he
said.
Pitcher, who just moved from
an apartment in Cambridge,
Mass., to study at Stanford,
agreed with Hansen, saying he
also felt that it was inappropriate

that he pay the same for his
unrenovated apartment as
Hansen pays for a renovated unit.
Pitcher said, however, that the
difference is not a major point of
contention for him.
"I'm fairly happy with where I
live now, but I wouldn't want to
live on campus next year unless I
moved into [a nicer place like]
Rains with some of my friends,"
Pitcher said.
He added that he also tries to
focus on the benefits of living in
the high rise. "It's on campus,
close to everything, on the 11th
floor, and positioned to a great
view," he said.
The idea of establishing a hier
archy of rent according to quality
of apartment is not a new thought
for the University, Whitney said.
He explained, however, that the
University is not considering a
rent change with the CIP almost
halfway to completion.
Housing Services has tried to
lessen the discrepancies among
apartments in lieu of full renova
tions, Whitney said. Escondido is
now completely wired for cable
and Ethernet connections, and
some unrenovated apartments
have had new stoves and refriger
ators installed, he added.
Other problems and concerns
Although residents' outrage is
slowly dissipating in terms of
housing conditions, there are
other problems that plague the
Escondido community.
Hansen said he believes that
opportunity costs are prohibiting

the University from addressing
other pertinent issues. One of
Hansen's major concerns is the
lead paint and asbestos problem
that affects Escondido residents.
The policy is conservative in a
pocketbook sense, he explained.
The lead and asbestos "is only
removed by request."
According to Hansen, residents
in the past had to contact Janet
Gleason, the health and safety
systems coordinator, in order to
have it removed.
This process is becoming more
complicated now that Housing
Services has lost Gleason. Accord
ing to Glick, Gleason left Stanford
about two or three months ago for
another job. Housing Services is in
the process of hiring a new person
to fill the position, Whitney said.
Housing Energy Management
Center Coordinator Mike Guthrie
has assumed Gleason's responsi
bility for now, said Glick. To have
the lead and asbestos removed,
residents must call their housing
supervisor, who will then contact
Guthrie to have it removed.
The most recent housing facili
ties statement posted to the resi
dents this month indicated that
target goals in this new fiscal year
include a focus on the asbestos
ceilings which remain in the low
rise family apartments.
According to Hansen, however,
the University will handle this
issue in the same way it deals with
any other issue — at what he
called a "bureaucratic pace." He
said he encourages residents to
get free lead testing of their apart

ments in the meantime.
"We have children here and
they will be exposed," Hansen
said.
Shockman said she is also con
cerned about the lead. It's impos
sible to communicate to a little
child what parts of the house they
can touch and which parts they
can't, she said.
"All lead that extends to the 48-
to 52-inch level should be obliter
ated" regardless of cost, she said.
Shockman added that better
forms of education, besides the
long notification letter written in
English that is currently circulat
ed, should be in place in order to
better communicate the harms of
the lead paint to the international
students in Escondido.
"Once all of the apartments are
renovated, everything will be okay
though," she said.
Although Hansen concedes
that residents are not rallying
behind a cause right now, he
believes that a few pertinent
issues besides asbestos will be
coming up in the future. Parking
and sidewalk problems seem to be
the new concerns, he said.
Shockman said she agreed that
parking has been a "big issue" for
Escondido.
"People will have cars [at Stan
ford! without a regional mass
transit system and nothing Pve
heard of [including this fall's latest
parking plan! addresses the fact
that in some places there are just
more people than spaces," he said.
"The biggest item of the new
plan is to keep working on it,
though," said Schiffman, who was
one of the members of the parking
committee formulated last year to
address the parking issue. This
year's plan is the first step toward
a "global" solution, she said. "I'm
glad to see a different attitude
being taken by the University."
Hansen also said that in the
future residents will rally for solu
tions that address the dangers of
Olmsted Road to parents walking
with their children. Olmsted Road
is the outlet road that surrounds
Escondido that connects drivers
to both Stanford Avenue and
Serra Street.
"At least once a month, some
one reports almost being hit on
that road because there are no
sidewalks," he explained.
Whether these issues will rally
residents together in another
organized effort for change, such
as the Escondido Village Family
Council, remains to be seen.

Leonard watches over her daughter Carlie, who showed exposure
to lead in medical tests in December 1992.
In sharp contrast to previous years, the
residents of Escondido Village seem content
this fall with the University's response to
years of student complaints about deterio
rating facilities and the aging of Escondido.
One year ago, the University began to
make major revisions in its housing policy.
The move included implementing a new
timetable for improving Escondido mainte
nance services, developing a student review
group to oversee the cleaning and inspection
processes, addressing the aging of the old
apartments and reevaluating rent dispari
ties among tenants in the unrenovated
apartments.
Resident complaints, which had accumu
lated for years, prompted the University's
response. Last fall, some residents were so
enraged with the housing conditions in Es
condido that they took their complaints to
the top, demanding meetings with Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds and other housing officials.
"We've made a lot of progress" since last
year's revisions were put in place, said
Assoc. Director of Housing and Dining Ser
vices Rodger Whitney. Student reaction is
"very solid and positive" to the new changes,
he said.
One area of progress that is particularly
appealing to residents is the renovation
timetable for old apartments. To date, more

than one-third of Escondido has been reno
vated. In fact, about 35 percent of the units
are now renovated — a figure that places the
University ahead of schedule, Whitney said.
"Our goal is to complete the Capital Im
provement Project I for Escondido] in eight
years," he said. "We're in the fourth year
now and we're in an accelerated phase of the
project.".
The CIP is the University's 12-year plan

to renovate old housing facilities
as well as construct new resi
dences. Other areas renovated
under the CIP include undergrad
uate dormitories Wilbur Hall and
Stern Hall.
Debbie Wood, a new resident in
Escondido, said she was very
pleased to find that her apartment
had been renovated upon arrival.
Wayne Pitcher, a first-year
graduate student in chemistry who
lives in one of the Escondido high
rises, said his apartment is still in
" '60s shape" and furnished with
the same old green vinyl sofa. "It
was fairly clean though," he said.
According to Graduate Apart
ment Facilities Manager Lynn
Click, the University has renovat
ed other complexes ahead of
Pitcher's building because the
apartment renovations have been
"prioritized by a worst-first"
schedule, which she said was a
common practice in most renova
tion projects.
Aside from complete renova
tions, however, all of the apart
ments have undergone some
improvement. For example, the
University has installed new
refrigerators in all Escondido
apartments, ahead of the CIP
schedule. With a few exceptions,
all of the Escondido low-rise
apartments have also been
equipped with new stoves, said
Whitney.
Cleaning standards
Past resident woes concerning
the cleanliness of the apartments
and the flexibility of residents
moving in and out have also been
addressed.
Protocols are in place which
help to minimize the problems
when old residents move out and
new ones move in, Whitney said.
The University is maintaining its
cleaning standards while still
enabling the students to have a
great deal of flexibility in their
moves, he added.
According to Whitney, resident
feedback is positive. Surveys have
indicated that the University has
significantly improved the hous
ing conditions in Escondido, as
compared with the situation
before last year's revisions. "On a
scale of one to five, [Facilities] is
receiving a four to five mark
now," he said.

Jim Hansen, last year's chair of
the former Escondido Village
Family Council and a leading fig
ure in the outrage over housing
problems, said this year is "light
years" ahead of the past.
"There's been an earthquake,"
he said.
According to Hansen, renova
tion dates in the past were ridicu
lous, often coinciding with
midterms and precluding a stu
dent's temporary move, he said.
"This fall, we're finally seeing the
benefits of the changes that were
made last year," he said.
Chris Shockman, another pro
ponent for housing changes, con
firmed that the housing situation
is getting better.
"Last year, we thought we were
abandoned by Housing," she said.
The University has brought in
some very competent people,
though, particularly Graduate
Facilities Supervisor Teresa Rise
borough and graduate CIP liaison
Glenn Carroll, who have focused

'On a scale of one to
five, [Facilities] is
receiving a four to
five mark now.'
— Rodger Whitney

more attention on day-to-day
maintenance, she said.
Smadar Schiffman, a resident
in Escondido, said there has been a
"great improvement in facilities."
Allowing residents to notify hous
ing of maintenance problems over
e-mail was a good idea, she said.
"The response to fix-it requests
has been a lot better too."
Village reviewed
Last fall, Director of Graduate
Residences Christine Griffith said
Housing and Dining Services was
also in the process of forming a
Village Operations Review Group
to allow administrators to work
with students on issues such as
cleaning, maintenance and reno
vation schedules. Griffith con
firmed that this group was formed
last November and started meet
ing regularly soon after.
The review group consists of
students and staff, including
Facilities and maintenance per
sonnel, Griffith said. After meet
ing last fall and evaluating the
faults of the housing system, the

group formulated several recom
mendations for improving Escon
dido.
Among their suggestions was
that Housing Services establish
better cleaning and maintenance
standards which would include
annual inspections of the apart

"We implemented the recom

Escondido.
"People will have cars [at Stan
ford! without a regional mass
transit system and nothing Pve
heard of [including this fall's latest
parking plan! addresses the fact
that in some places there are just
more people than spaces," he said.
"The biggest item of the new
plan is to keep working on it,
though," said Schiffman, who was
one of the members of the parking
committee formulated last year to
address the parking issue. This
year's plan is the first step toward
a "global" solution, she said. "I'm
glad to see a different attitude
being taken by the University."
Hansen also said that in the
future residents will rally for solu
tions that address the dangers of
Olmsted Road to parents walking
with their children. Olmsted Road
is the outlet road that surrounds
Escondido that connects drivers
to both Stanford Avenue and
Serra Street.
"At least once a month, some
one reports almost being hit on
that road because there are no
sidewalks," he explained.
Whether these issues will rally
residents together in another
organized effort for change, such
as the Escondido Village Family
Council, remains to be seen.

Leonard watches over her daughter Carlie, who showed exposure
to lead in medical tests in December 1992.
In sharp contrast to previous years, the
residents of Escondido Village seem content
this fall with the University's response to
years of student complaints about deterio
rating facilities and the aging of Escondido.
One year ago, the University began to
make major revisions in its housing policy.
The move included implementing a new
timetable for improving Escondido mainte
nance services, developing a student review
group to oversee the cleaning and inspection
processes, addressing the aging of the old
apartments and reevaluating rent dispari
ties among tenants in the unrenovated
apartments.
Resident complaints, which had accumu
lated for years, prompted the University's
response. Last fall, some residents were so
enraged with the housing conditions in Es
condido that they took their complaints to
the top, demanding meetings with Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds and other housing officials.
"We've made a lot of progress" since last
year's revisions were put in place, said
Assoc. Director of Housing and Dining Ser
vices Rodger Whitney. Student reaction is
"very solid and positive" to the new changes,
he said.
One area of progress that is particularly
appealing to residents is the renovation
timetable for old apartments. To date, more

than one-third of Escondido has been reno
vated. In fact, about 35 percent of the units
are now renovated — a figure that places the
University ahead of schedule, Whitney said.
"Our goal is to complete the Capital Im
provement Project I for Escondido] in eight
years," he said. "We're in the fourth year
now and we're in an accelerated phase of the
project.".
The CIP is the University's 12-year plan

to renovate old housing facilities
as well as construct new resi
dences. Other areas renovated
under the CIP include undergrad
uate dormitories Wilbur Hall and
Stern Hall.
Debbie Wood, a new resident in
Escondido, said she was very
pleased to find that her apartment
had been renovated upon arrival.
Wayne Pitcher, a first-year
graduate student in chemistry who
lives in one of the Escondido high
rises, said his apartment is still in
" '60s shape" and furnished with
the same old green vinyl sofa. "It
was fairly clean though," he said.
According to Graduate Apart
ment Facilities Manager Lynn
Click, the University has renovat
ed other complexes ahead of
Pitcher's building because the
apartment renovations have been
"prioritized by a worst-first"
schedule, which she said was a
common practice in most renova
tion projects.
Aside from complete renova
tions, however, all of the apart
ments have undergone some
improvement. For example, the
University has installed new
refrigerators in all Escondido
apartments, ahead of the CIP
schedule. With a few exceptions,
all of the Escondido low-rise
apartments have also been
equipped with new stoves, said
Whitney.
Cleaning standards
Past resident woes concerning
the cleanliness of the apartments
and the flexibility of residents
moving in and out have also been
addressed.
Protocols are in place which
help to minimize the problems
when old residents move out and
new ones move in, Whitney said.
The University is maintaining its
cleaning standards while still
enabling the students to have a
great deal of flexibility in their
moves, he added.
According to Whitney, resident
feedback is positive. Surveys have
indicated that the University has
significantly improved the hous
ing conditions in Escondido, as
compared with the situation
before last year's revisions. "On a
scale of one to five, [Facilities] is
receiving a four to five mark
now," he said.

Jim Hansen, last year's chair of
the former Escondido Village
Family Council and a leading fig
ure in the outrage over housing
problems, said this year is "light
years" ahead of the past.
"There's been an earthquake,"
he said.
According to Hansen, renova
tion dates in the past were ridicu
lous, often coinciding with
midterms and precluding a stu
dent's temporary move, he said.
"This fall, we're finally seeing the
benefits of the changes that were
made last year," he said.
Chris Shockman, another pro
ponent for housing changes, con
firmed that the housing situation
is getting better.
"Last year, we thought we were
abandoned by Housing," she said.
The University has brought in
some very competent people,
though, particularly Graduate
Facilities Supervisor Teresa Rise
borough and graduate CIP liaison
Glenn Carroll, who have focused

'On a scale of one to
five, [Facilities] is
receiving a four to
five mark now.'
— Rodger Whitney

more attention on day-to-day
maintenance, she said.
Smadar Schiffman, a resident
in Escondido, said there has been a
"great improvement in facilities."
Allowing residents to notify hous
ing of maintenance problems over
e-mail was a good idea, she said.
"The response to fix-it requests
has been a lot better too."
Village reviewed
Last fall, Director of Graduate
Residences Christine Griffith said
Housing and Dining Services was
also in the process of forming a
Village Operations Review Group
to allow administrators to work
with students on issues such as
cleaning, maintenance and reno
vation schedules. Griffith con
firmed that this group was formed
last November and started meet
ing regularly soon after.
The review group consists of
students and staff, including
Facilities and maintenance per
sonnel, Griffith said. After meet
ing last fall and evaluating the
faults of the housing system, the

group formulated several recom
mendations for improving Escon
dido.
Among their suggestions was
that Housing Services establish
better cleaning and maintenance
standards which would include
annual inspections of the apart
ments, she said.
"We implemented the recom
mendations," Griffith said. Last
winter some members of the
review group accompanied the
administrators on their inspection
of the apartments and the "group
feedback was good," Griffith said.
"Maintenance and cleaning stan
dards were met."
According to Whitney, this
group is an "ongoing working
group that will (continue to] over
see the cleaning of the apart
ments."
Kathy Eisenhut, a member of
the Village Operations Review
Group who attended some of the
inspections last winter, said the
apartments were clean then. How
ever, Eisenhut said she has not
met with the group this fall, nor
has anyone contacted her about
meetings or inspections. She
added that she is planning to con
tact someone soon about the sta
tus of the group.
According to Hansen, it's
important to remember that the
University is not giving the resi
dents any services they do not
deserve. These improvements are
issues of basic maintenance, he
said.
Cost of living
Another concern for many resi
dents of Escondido over the past
few years has been the high rent
they must pay for such inadequate
living conditions. Part of this out
rage has subsided since the recent
renovations made to some of the
apartments, but some Escondido
residents feel that University poli
cy should address the discrepan
cies among apartments.
"I pay the same rent [for my
renovated apartment], and this
place has to be worth $100 more,"
said Hansen, who lives in a reno
vated low-rise family apartment
in Escondido.
The condition of an unrenovat
ed apartment in Escondido is com
parable to that of a "slum," he
said.
Pitcher, who just moved from
an apartment in Cambridge,
Mass., to study at Stanford,
agreed with Hansen, saying he
also felt that it was inappropriate

that he pay the same for his
unrenovated apartment as
Hansen pays for a renovated unit.
Pitcher said, however, that the
difference is not a major point of
contention for him.
"I'm fairly happy with where I
live now, but I wouldn't want to
live on campus next year unless I
moved into [a nicer place like]
Rains with some of my friends,"
Pitcher said.
He added that he also tries to
focus on the benefits of living in
the high rise. "It's on campus,
close to everything, on the 11th
floor, and positioned to a great
view," he said.
The idea of establishing a hier
archy of rent according to quality
of apartment is not a new thought
for the University, Whitney said.
He explained, however, that the
University is not considering a
rent change with the CIP almost
halfway to completion.
Housing Services has tried to
lessen the discrepancies among
apartments in lieu of full renova
tions, Whitney said. Escondido is
now completely wired for cable
and Ethernet connections, and
some unrenovated apartments
have had new stoves and refriger
ators installed, he added.
Other problems and concerns
Although residents' outrage is
slowly dissipating in terms of
housing conditions, there are
other problems that plague the
Escondido community.
Hansen said he believes that
opportunity costs are prohibiting

the University from addressing
other pertinent issues. One of
Hansen's major concerns is the
lead paint and asbestos problem
that affects Escondido residents.
The policy is conservative in a
pocketbook sense, he explained.
The lead and asbestos "is only
removed by request."
According to Hansen, residents
in the past had to contact Janet
Gleason, the health and safety
systems coordinator, in order to
have it removed.
This process is becoming more
complicated now that Housing
Services has lost Gleason. Accord
ing to Glick, Gleason left Stanford
about two or three months ago for
another job. Housing Services is in
the process of hiring a new person
to fill the position, Whitney said.
Housing Energy Management
Center Coordinator Mike Guthrie
has assumed Gleason's responsi
bility for now, said Glick. To have
the lead and asbestos removed,
residents must call their housing
supervisor, who will then contact
Guthrie to have it removed.
The most recent housing facili
ties statement posted to the resi
dents this month indicated that
target goals in this new fiscal year
include a focus on the asbestos
ceilings which remain in the low
rise family apartments.
According to Hansen, however,
the University will handle this
issue in the same way it deals with
any other issue — at what he
called a "bureaucratic pace." He
said he encourages residents to
get free lead testing of their apart

ments in the meantime.
"We have children here and
they will be exposed," Hansen
said.
Shockman said she is also con
cerned about the lead. It's impos
sible to communicate to a little
child what parts of the house they
can touch and which parts they
can't, she said.
"All lead that extends to the 48-
to 52-inch level should be obliter
ated" regardless of cost, she said.
Shockman added that better
forms of education, besides the
long notification letter written in
English that is currently circulat
ed, should be in place in order to
better communicate the harms of
the lead paint to the international
students in Escondido.
"Once all of the apartments are
renovated, everything will be okay
though," she said.
Although Hansen concedes
that residents are not rallying
behind a cause right now, he
believes that a few pertinent
issues besides asbestos will be
coming up in the future. Parking
and sidewalk problems seem to be
the new concerns, he said.
Shockman said she agreed that
parking has been a "big issue" for
Escondido.
"People will have cars [at Stan
ford! without a regional mass
transit system and nothing Pve
heard of [including this fall's latest
parking plan! addresses the fact
that in some places there are just
more people than spaces," he said.
"The biggest item of the new
plan is to keep working on it,
though," said Schiffman, who was
one of the members of the parking
committee formulated last year to
address the parking issue. This
year's plan is the first step toward
a "global" solution, she said. "I'm
glad to see a different attitude
being taken by the University."
Hansen also said that in the
future residents will rally for solu
tions that address the dangers of
Olmsted Road to parents walking
with their children. Olmsted Road
is the outlet road that surrounds
Escondido that connects drivers
to both Stanford Avenue and
Serra Street.
"At least once a month, some
one reports almost being hit on
that road because there are no
sidewalks," he explained.
Whether these issues will rally
residents together in another
organized effort for change, such
as the Escondido Village Family
Council, remains to be seen.
