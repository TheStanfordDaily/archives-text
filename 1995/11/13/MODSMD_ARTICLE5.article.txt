# Village renovations proving satisfactory
## EV residents content after year's housing reforms 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
In sharp contrast to previous years, the
residents of Escondido Village seem content
this fall with the University's response to
years of student complaints about deterio
rating facilities and the aging of Escondido.
One year ago, the University began to
make major revisions in its housing policy.
The move included implementing a new
timetable for improving Escondido mainte
nance services, developing a student review
group to oversee the cleaning and inspection
processes, addressing the aging of the old
apartments and reevaluating rent dispari
ties among tenants in the unrenovated
apartments.
Resident complaints, which had accumu
lated for years, prompted the University's
response. Last fall, some residents were so
enraged with the housing conditions in Es
condido that they took their complaints to
the top, demanding meetings with Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds and other housing officials.
"We've made a lot of progress" since last
year's revisions were put in place, said
Assoc. Director of Housing and Dining Ser
vices Rodger Whitney. Student reaction is
"very solid and positive" to the new changes,
he said.
One area of progress that is particularly
appealing to residents is the renovation
timetable for old apartments. To date, more

than one-third of Escondido has been reno
vated. In fact, about 35 percent of the units
are now renovated — a figure that places the
University ahead of schedule, Whitney said.
"Our goal is to complete the Capital Im
provement Project I for Escondido] in eight
years," he said. "We're in the fourth year
now and we're in an accelerated phase of the
project.".
The CIP is the University's 12-year plan
