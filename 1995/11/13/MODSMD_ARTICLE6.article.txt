# UAC underlines need to define advising roles
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Representatives of the Undergraduate
Advising Center are responding positively to
the recommendations on undergraduate ad
vising made at last Thursday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting, stressing the importance of
providing incentives and clarifying the defi
nition of advising.
"Both the role of the student and the ad
viser need to be clearly defined," said Verity
Powell, pre-professional adviser at the UAC.
"We train the advisers and the advising
associates try to prepare the students, but
there are some unrealistic expectations. The
students want someone to advise them, and
assume their adviser knows everything,"
Powell said.
UAC Adviser Cathy Wright agreed. "The
first thing we need to do is to define the
terms, look at our resources and make a pro
ductive relationship between the adviser
and the student," Wright said.
Michelle Koh, a student on the commit
tee which made the recommendations, said
the main goal was to give freshmen and

sophomores as much contact with faculty as
possible.
"Freshmen need someone to provide
them mentorship and advice," she said.
Compensating faculty
Providing compensation for such advice,
however, is a controversial part in the com
mittee's recommendation. Koh said the
idea is meant to encourage faculty by "rec
ognizing advising as a valuable teaching ac
tivity."
"Although it is part of the responsibility
of a faculty member, it is not currently part
of the Stanford culture to encourage them
to advise," said Koh. "In many departments,
it is even discouraged. It is not the payment
or the extra sabbatical that should encour
age them. It is the recognition."
Wright said she feels faculty are under
appreciated. "They are under great stress.
Advising is a time-consuming activity, and
hopefully people are realistic about the time
involved. l Perhaps they would be more will
ing to give if they were compensated,"
Wright said.
Powell added that students
complain that their adviser is never
there or is too critical of them. "It's
a two-way street, though. Advisers
have told me that they go to the
dorm for dinner, and the students
don't come to eat with them," Pow
ell said.
Some of the apparent problems
with the advising system are advis
ers who don't know enough about
the curriculum and the fact that
only about a third of the advisers
are faculty. Powell said, however,
that some of the best reviews they
get are of staff advisers.
"There is a problem with the
volunteer system in general. . . .

There is no way of evaluating
[advisers] because they are not
being judged on their perfor
mance," Powell said. "At some
schools, faculty have to advise and
they hate it. It is something they
are forced to do, and they just don't
want to."
How Stanford compares
Todd Trubey, a college adviser
at Northwestern University, said
that, as at Stanford, freshmen are
assigned a random adviser from a
pre-selected academic area. All the
advisers are faculty, but they are
only assigned to the student for
the first year. "Most students
select a major adviser by the end of
their freshman year," said
Trubey.
Robert Schlegel, a junior in eco
nomics at Yale who works at Yale's
information center, said that the

"master" of each residential college
— a faculty member who lives on
the premises — provides most of
the freshman advising.
"There is a director of under
graduate studies, and you can go to
him for advice on courses or aca
demic difficulties," Schlegel said.
"Then, after your first year, you
choose a major adviser."
At UC-Berkeley, there are 18
staff advisers for the entire under
graduate population of around
21,000, with whom students can
make appointments a week in
advance. If they want, students can
be assigned an adviser for their
major.
Powell said that when she looks
at Stanford compared to other
schools, "we are really the model.
Our perception is that we could be
doing something better. Advising is
a universal problem," she said.
