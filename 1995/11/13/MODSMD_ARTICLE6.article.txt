# UAC underlines need to define advising roles

### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Representatives of the Undergraduate
Advising Center are responding positively to
the recommendations on undergraduate ad
vising made at last Thursday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting, stressing the importance of
providing incentives and clarifying the defi
nition of advising.
"Both the role of the student and the ad
viser need to be clearly defined," said Verity
Powell, pre-professional adviser at the UAC.
"We train the advisers and the advising
associates try to prepare the students, but
there are some unrealistic expectations. The
students want someone to advise them, and
assume their adviser knows everything,"
Powell said.
UAC Adviser Cathy Wright agreed. "The
first thing we need to do is to define the
terms, look at our resources and make a pro
ductive relationship between the adviser
and the student," Wright said.
Michelle Koh, a student on the commit
tee which made the recommendations, said
the main goal was to give freshmen and

sophomores as much contact with faculty as
possible.
"Freshmen need someone to provide
them mentorship and advice," she said.
Compensating faculty
Providing compensation for such advice,
however, is a controversial part in the com
mittee's recommendation. Koh said the
idea is meant to encourage faculty by "rec
ognizing advising as a valuable teaching ac
tivity."
"Although it is part of the responsibility
of a faculty member, it is not currently part
of the Stanford culture to encourage them
to advise," said Koh. "In many departments,
it is even discouraged. It is not the payment
or the extra sabbatical that should encour
age them. It is the recognition."
Wright said she feels faculty are under
appreciated. "They are under great stress.
Advising is a time-consuming activity, and
hopefully people are realistic about the time
involved. l Perhaps they would be more will
ing to give if they were compensated,"
