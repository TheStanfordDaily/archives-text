Agreement reached in Dayton
ERDUT, Croatia (AP) — Rebel Serbs agreed
yesterday to submit the last of their holdings in
Croatia to government authority, resolving a dis
pute that threatened to derail U.S.-led talks in
Ohio on peace for the Balkans.
The agreement, signed in this Serb-held town
in eastern Croatia and witnessed by Galbraith
and chief U.N. envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg, also
averted the imminent threat of more fighting.
Croatian troops in May and August recaptured
most Serb-held territory taken in a 1991 war,
sending about 180,000 Croatian Serbs fleeing to
Bosnia and Serbia.
Croatia threatened to attack the remaining bit of
Serb-held territory, known as eastern Slavonia, if
rebels refused to accept the plan for its reintegration.
Such an attack on the territory, which borders
Serbia, could have drawn in the Serb-led Yugoslav

army, leading to renewed war and a collapse of
Bosnian peace talks at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base.
The agreement to reintegrate eastern Slavonia
under Croatian sovereignty was a major step
toward peace, President Clinton said.
"I congratulate the parties for the wisdom they
have shown in entering into this agreement and
avoiding renewed conflict," Clinton said.
The agreement calls for a one-year transitional
period that can be extended to two if requested by
either side. It asks the U.N. Security Council to
create an interim administration for the area and
deploy troops to maintain peace, but does not
specify the composition of those forces.
The 14-point agreement was finalized in Day
ton during talks between Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman and Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, negotiating on behalf of rebel Serbs in
Croatia and Bosnia, sources said.
