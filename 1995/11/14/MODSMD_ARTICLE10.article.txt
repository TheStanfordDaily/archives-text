# Government shutdown imminent
## Money runs out as Clinton, GOP leaders cannot agree on funding bill 
### 
WASHINGTON vAP) - The government
skidded toward a shutdown that would send
800,000 federid workers home after President
Glinton and Republican leaders failed to reach a
budget deal in late-night talks yesterday.
White House press secretary Mike McCurry
said it was virtually certain the government
would begin closing this morning. As much as 40
percent of the federal workforce could be idled in
the first government shutdown in five years.
"There's no continuing resolution and no
funding authority to keep the United States gov
ernment operating," he said. He dismissed any
suggestion that Republicans could rush a bill
through early in the day to avert a shutdown.
Clinton met with lawmakers for an hour and
40 minutes last night in the Cabinet Room at the
request of GOP leaders."
Dole said the talks would continue this morn
ing, with White House chief of staff Panet

ta meeting with House Budget Committee
Chairman John Kasich and his Senate counter
part, Pete Domenici.
Democratic leaders emerging from the White
House meeting were pessimistic that a short
term extension of spending and borrowing
authority could be worked out in less than 24
hours. "There was no progress at all," said Sen
ate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle.
Even so, Dole said, "The fact we're going to
meet tomorrow is progress." House Speaker
Newt Gingrich said, "We laid out in a pretty can
did way where we feel different in terms of prin
ciple."
The White House meeting came after Clinton
vetoed twin spending and borrowing bills, insist
ing that Republicans drop provisions that would
raise Medicare premiums and cut education and
environmental spending. Republicans urgently
requested to see Clinton, and went to the White

House at 10 p.m.
"If America must close down access to quality
education, a clean environment and affordable
health care for our seniors in order to keep the
government open, then that price is too high,"
Clinton said in vetoing a temporary spending
bill.
Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Manage
ment and Budget, told heads of federal agencies
to have their employees report for work as usual
this morning. If it looked like a temporary bud
get measure acceptable to the president could
clear Congress on today, agencies will operate
normally, she said.
In any case, air traffic controllers, prison
guards and others with crucial jobs would keep
working, as would military personnel and the
Postal Service. But national museums and mon
uments and the IRS and Social Security hotlines
would be among the federal operations closed.
