## Professional advice 
### 
Replacing faculty with
full-time staff advisers
will better focus system

THE AXIOM "GOOD advice is
hard to come by" might have
applied to last week's Faculty
Senate meeting. Even after an eight
month study of freshman advising,
faculty members could not come to
an agreement on how to make spe
cific improvements to the system.
Faculty contact for first-year stu
dents is undoubtedly valuable in
introducing freshmen to the rich
ness of University life. But part of
the solution to the advising problem
may lie in removing faculty mem
bers as first-year advisers altogether
and revamping the entire system by
turning it over to a professional
advising staff.
In a perfect world, students —
particularly first-years — would
have professors seeing them as fre
quently as possible to answer any
questions they might have about
academics or life at Stanford in gen
eral. But in reality, giving students
advice is not always the top priority
of professors occupied with research
and teaching duties. While most pro
fessors would probably be glad to
give some quick tips on which class
es to take in their own departments,
quality advice takes time and
patience — responsibilities some
professors are simply not able to
shoulder.
Another problem of the process is
that students are sometimes poorly
matched with faculty advisers.
Freshmen are required to declare a
concentration before they arrive in
order to be matched with an appro
priate dorm-based advising group.
But a student interested in physics
may be neglected when placed in a
group where the adviser is a chemi
cal engineer.
In addition, freshmen oflen dis
cover different academic interests
once thev tret to Stanford — a pro

cess encouraged by the distribution
requirement system. In these cases,
advisers often cannot help their
advisees. Without time and research,
a human biology professor may find
it difficult to counsel a student sud
denly interested in becoming a polit
ical science major.
Advising should be viewed as a
serious undertaking. Thus, it makes
sense to turn first-year advising
duties over to a professional staff
focused on the process as a whole.
The University should consider
hiring a full-time staff of at least 16
advisers for each first-year class of
students. These advisers would have
expert knowledge of Stanford as a
whole as well as intimate knowledge
of certain departments. While 100
students per adviser may seem a bit
bureaucratic, counselors with noth
ing else to absorb their time would
be able to give full attention to their
duties. Advising in most cases could
even stay residence-based.
One possibility is to hire graduat
ing seniors for some of the positions.
Most students can probably say that
some of the best advice they received
about classes came from their peers.
Recently graduated alumni who
have spent the last four or five years
on the Farm have both historical
perspective and an understanding of
what new students may be going
through.
Funding a staff of professionals
will cost money in an era of budget
cutting. But advising should be a top
priority at this University. Instead of
compensating professors, Stanford
administrators would be wise to hire
counselors who can really devote
their time and energy to the process.
Admittedly, a possible detriment
in removing faculty advisers is that
students might not have contact
with the people they may one day
wish to do research with. But it
should be noted that only one-third
of all freshman advisers are faculty
members. Though faculty contact
is wonderful and valuable, it's not
too hard to come by when you're
motivated. As Stanford students,
that shouldn't be a problem for
anvone.
