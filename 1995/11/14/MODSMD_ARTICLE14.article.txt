Tuesday morning, I was surprised to see
a big red pick-up truck on the sidewalk
outside of the post office. I saw a big man
inside of the truck and he saw me too.
"He turned the truck around quickly,
and as I rode toward the Bookstore, I felt
his monster truck following behind me. I
didn't know what to do. I thought that
he might run me over with his truck or
he might jump out and chase me. I ped
aled faster. It was dark and there was no
one around. There was no phone to pick
up. There was no one to hear me scream.
"I rode toward the bike racks outside
the Bookstore, where I hoped a car
couldn't fit. I looked back and the truck
hesitated. I ran toward the Bookstore
steps, hoping that the truck wouldn't be
able to follow. I panicked. No one should
ever feel that frightened or helpless.
"The truck sped away past the Quad.
The man inside may not have been trying
to threaten me, but I felt threatened. He
mav not have wanted to hurt me, but he

could have. I was scared. I was at the cen
ter of campus. I was in a place where non-
University vehicles aren't supposed to be.
"It's not fair. Why didn't I feel safe? I
could have easily been an assault or a
rape victim. What does this say about
our University, that someone could feel
so alone and so helpless in the very cen
ter of campus, even in a time when a
local serial rapist remains at large?
"The University needs to address
security issues. This is home. We should
all feel safe here."
The previous account was of a true
incident related to me by a friend.
Have you ever marched to take back
the night? Have you ever sat on the cold
stones of the Quad holding a candle and
listening to woman after woman stand
up and tell her story — the story of how
she was raped? The story of how she was
violated, assaulted, abused or harassed?
Have you ever sat on the floor of your
friend's dorm room with your hand on
her knee, watching the tears stream
down her cheeks as she describes her
fear — her feeling of utter helplessness

and desolation?
Self defense for women classes
should be offered on campus. I know
women who have considered taking the
local class, but decided not to because it
requires traveling off campus at night
and costs money. It does not appear
that the administration cares if women
have the skills and confidence to defend
themselves. They decided it was accept
able for the Self Defense For Women
Program to be exiled from campus as
part of a pre-verdict agreement on the
impending Title IX suit against it. This
action, taken after countless letters,
petitions, legal briefs and demonstra
tions articulating the enormous impact
the class has had on the lives of hun
dreds of women, says to me, "Yes, it is
O.K. for the voices of women to be trivi
alized."
Do people think that there is no rape
on this campus? No verbal abuse and no
sexual harassment? If these things exist
ed, we would know about them and do
something about them. This is a danger
ous fallacy. How can we expect assaulted

women to speak up when the adminis
tration shows little support for their
voices and little interest in helping us
grow? Why isn't there a self defense for
women class taught on campus? Why
have the number of sexual assault pre
vention positions been reduced from two
positions to one part-time position? Why
do we deny that rape exists and that ver
bal harassment is a problem? We keep
trying to convince ourselves that things
are different here at Stanford, that the
women and men here are too intelligent
and politically correct to perpetuate gen
der stereotypes.
Both of these ideas are ridiculous and
we need to address the true situation.
There are women getting raped and
harassed at Stanford. We do not have
ready access to support systems or to a
class which would enable us to find our
voices. Resources must be available
which help us tap the strength we
already have inside of us to scream
"NO!"
