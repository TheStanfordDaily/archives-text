# Free entry for varsity athletes should not be considered elitist perk
## 
### 
As student-athletes, we would like to
defend the Department of Athletics' pol
icy to allow varsity athletes to attend
football games and other sporting events
free of charge.
A letter in last Friday's issue of The
Daily suggests that in the face of "loom
ing debt," the Athletics Department
should ask for support and sacrifice
from varsity athletes, "a group that
should be its strongest advocate." The

distinction made between varsity ath
letes and the department is miscon
ceived, for we are more than just its sup
porters — in fact, we arc the Athletics
Department. Given that the department
receives no financial support from the
University itself, our role is crucial for
ticket sales and fund raising. These
events depend substantially on our per
formance and representation of the Uni
versity.
As the letter correctly states, we are
students first. However, we are students
who give up to 30 hours per week to the
Athletics Department in the form of
practice and competition. While some do
receive financial aid for their efforts,
many receive nothing at all aside from

the honor of representing Stanford in
competition. We are representatives of
the Athletics Department and free
admission to sporting events on campus
is a privilege we receive out of respect
and gratitude from our department. For
this reason, we feel the practice is per
fectly justifiable. In our opinion, it is nei
ther elitist nor divisive.
The letter closes with an expression
of resentment at the fact that the
money spent by students on tickets, and
now ticket price increases, may make it
possible for varsity athletes to attend
games for free. Student-athlete atten
dance at games has always been, and
continues to be, quite high. As we have
been granted free admission for some

time, it would be difficult, if not impos
sible, to draw a legitimate connection
between this practice and ticket price
fluctuations. Football tickets are not
more expensive because varsity athletes
get into games for free. It is more likely
that price increases are the result of
marginal student support of our teams.
Those who share the sentiments of the
author of Friday's letter should consider
this possibility before pointing fingers
at varsity athletes — a group that truly
is the Athletics Department's strongest
advocate.
