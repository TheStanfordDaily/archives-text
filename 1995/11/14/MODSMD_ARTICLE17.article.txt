## Why find romance here? 
### 
WHAT IS MORE important to
you? Having a girlfriend or get
ting an A in one of your classes?
Unfortunately, the majority of Stanford
students think getting an A is more impor
tant. According to them, you come to Stan
ford to learn and pursue the road to finan
cial success. If you really want to find
someone, you'll have time for that later in
life in aisle seven of the supermarket.
In life, the pursuit of love, money,
power and prestige is irrevocably linked
with the pursuit of happiness. Happiness
is everyone's goal. The only real differ
ence between people is their perception of
what the best path to that goal is.
So with happiness as the goal, compare
the success of two hypothetical Stanford
students, Smart-guy and Love-guy, in
reaching that goal. Smart-guy loves Stan
ford and sees the University as his step
ping stone to the tower of financial securi
ty. He boasts a 3.8 CPA, goes on to Yale
Law School and eventually becomes a suc
cessful tax attorney.
Unfortunately for Smart-guy, he never
falls in love, and so, everyday, he comes
home from work to a lifeless apartment —
no one is there to welcome him home and
no one is there to kiss him goodnight.
Like Smart-guy, Love-guy loves Stan
ford. Unlike Smart-guy, however, he sees
the University not only as a place of
learning, but as a place to meet people
and hopefully, a place to meet that special

someone who would do him the honor of
spending the rest of her life with him.
Love-guy ends up with a 3.2 GPA, goes to
poe-dunk law school and finds a low-pay
ing but reliable job in the District Attor
ney's office. But Love-guy has more than
just a job — he is also happily married.
After meeting Love-girl his junior year,
they fell in love and eventually pro
gressed towards marital bliss.
So which one would you want to be? Do
you want to be wildly successful and lone
ly or only moderately successful but in
love? Which of the two situations would
make you happier? The correct choice is
clear.
Of course, many will say that being in
love and being successful are not mutual
ly exclusive. But the fact is, most Stanford
students spend too much time obsessing
over grades and classes and too little time
looking for the love of their life. If every
one took three less units of classes and
took three units of time looking for mean
ingful companionship — looking for and
securing their happiness in the future —
Stanford would have a lot more Love-guys
and a lot less Smart-guys. Everyone's
well-being would increase and Stanford
would be a much happier place.
On the other hand, I'm not suggesting
that we turn the entire campus into an
AASA-esque, screw-your-sib meat mar
ket. But if we could just convert half of
the 60 percent of students who cling to

asexuality, we would come a long way.
Of course, speaking from personal
experience, looking for love will not guar
antee that you will actually find it.
There's another problem that prevents
many Love-guys from finding their true
love — the problem of exaggerated expec
tations. People at Stanford tend to think
far too highly of themselves. Everyone
believes that they deserve more than they
can actually get.
Sure, that girl is cool and sweet, but
hey, I can do better than that!
As an analogy, look at the search for a
relationship like the search for a new car.
Stanford students will always obsess over
that car that's just $,1000 dollars out of
their budget. As a result, no one buys any
thing, and many great and affordable cars
sit undriven. Of course, there are always
those buyers who will take cars for test
drives with no intention to purchase.
These jerks end up pissing off the car
dealer and wearing out the car, but they
still have to take a bus home from the lot.
So if you haven't looked, start looking.
If you have looked, look more carefully.
That special person is here — you just
have to find her.

Mr. Small considers himself a Love-guy
still looking.
