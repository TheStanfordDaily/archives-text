## Is there a moral obligation to donate to Stanford? Don't mandate morality A 						student's obligation 
### 
LAST WEEK, I gave a man a
couple dollars because he
was unemployed and living
in the streets of Sunnyvale. That
donation probably will not
impoverish me, even though I am
a self-sustaining student heavily
dependent on financial aid. But
at least I know he had enough
money to eat that evening, if he
so desired.
I could have walked away, fig
uring someone else would give
him cash, but then I would have
had to live with that decision —
knowing that I denied someone in
need. It was a moral obligation I
felt within myself to give him
money, simply because he was
poor and I was not.
This reasoning is the funda
mental basis of giving. Self-satis
faction of an internal moral stan
dard is the primary motive in
helping others. People volunteer
and give gifts because it makes
them feel like they have con
tributed positively to the social
welfare. Productive outcomes
from gift-giving continually rein
force an individual's internal
sense of "doing good."
After giving the man money
that evening, I read about Stan
ford's new interpretation of alum
ni giving: We now have a "moral
obligation" to donate money to
Stanford. This initially shocked
me, but upon further contempla
tion, it also revealed the serious
state of financing an education at
Stanford.
On one level, Stanford unfor
tunately does not agree that gift
giving is driven by an internal
sense of morality. The University
— indeed, University President
Gerhard Casper himself — has
decided that Stanford students
and alumni are not capable of
making donation decisions alone
and should instead adhere to a
University-defined "moral obliga
tion to give."
Imposed top-down rather than
bottom-up, Casper's "moral obli
gation" reflects a troubling sense
of subjective and paternalistic
power pervading the University
administration these days. Stan

ford basically views us as self
interested Hobbsian individuals
who require a higher authority to
outline how we should act even
after we leave Stanford.
The new "moral obligation"
demands that we follow Stan
ford's institutional norm in gift
giving. Like it or not, Stanford is
now tabulating numerically our
individual levels of "moralness"
with each dollar we give. This is
not "1984" yet, but it seems we
are well on our way there.
It is chilling to know that the
University feels it has the
responsibility to institutionalize
our morals, particularly in alum
ni donations. Whether the Uni
versity intended it, this concept
has now become a bureaucratic
norm simply because Casper
publicly proclaimed it as neces
sary for Stanford's future.
Encoding this "moral obligation"
into the Fundamental Standard
is the only step remaining in the
formalization process, absurd as
it sounds.
Toqueville said that American
democracy thrives because small
associations foster a reciprocal
process of "giving" between the
individual and society. This is
antithetical to Stanford's top
down "moral obligation" because
the element of reciprocity is
absent in a hierarchical power
structure. Stanford is not thank
ing us for our money; Stanford is
demanding it.
Particularly disturbing is that
this new standard lacks legal sub
stance or rule-based objectivity,
despite its permeation of Stan
ford's value system. Failing to
give money (or worse, failing to
give enough money) could con
ceivably be a violation of Stanford
ethics, resulting in a subjective
devaluation of an individual's net
worth as perceived by the Univer
sity.
This would be tragic, consider
ing that Stanford graduates earn
different salaries, some very low
compared to typical Stanford aver
ages. An institutionalized "moral
obligation" would affect alumni
regressivelv, especially if incomes
are constrained by high college
loan debt. Taken to extremes, the
poor might be guilty of moral
transgression simply because they
cannot afford to give.
Granted, much of this discus
sion is nonsense. Stanford's
moral argument is in fact an
excuse for failing to attack the
real sources of poor alumni giving
rates. Many more serious prob

lems in funding Stanford aca
demics actually exist and require
fundamental reform.
Stanford's financial situation is
complicated. On one hand, the
University bears most of the
transaction costs of education —
Casper is correct on this point.
However, the University also
refuses to remedy the situation in
the most effective and cost effi
cient manner. The result is a grid
lock in which the University tries
to do too many things at once and
ultimately does many things back
wards and counter intuitively.
As it stands, the University
relies too much on older genera
tions to fund today's students.
Young alumni are wary about
supporting an institution with
which they have philosophical
and moral grievances. Irresponsi
ble and wasteful spending,
tuition hikes that exceed infla
tion, politicized academics and
collusive and dishonest leader
ship combine to ruin Stanford's
national image. And unlike other
universities which support

strong, extensive and energetic
alumni clubs, Stanford does little
to promote a sense of "owner
ship" among alumni.
Provost Condoleezza Rice
understands this situation better
than anyone else on campus. She
has taken bold steps to stream
line, rationalize and balance Stan
ford's budget. Rice has shown
Stanford that cost-cutting is as
critical to budget management as
increasing revenues.
Establishing an institutional
"moral obligation" to donate is
wrong because it usurps individu
al discretion. People will give for
their own personal reasons. The
University should stop ignoring
some of the basic issues that
cause poor alumni giving rates
and rebuild Stanford into Ameri
ca's greatest university.
Excusing itself from blame will
only perpetuate alumni discon
tent and exacerbate Stanford's
financial woes.

THERE IS A wonderful
phrase spoken at every
Stanford Commencement
and engraved on every Stanford
diploma — it states that the
graduate is awarded a degree
"with all the Rights, Privileges,
Honors and Responsibilities
thereunto appertaining."
A Stanford education does
indeed confer upon every recipi
ent rights, privileges, honors and
responsibilities. Just the oppor
tunity to study at one of the
world's great universities is a
privilege. Every student admit
ted to Stanford has worked hard
and been judged "deserving and
exceptional." Yet many other
deserving and exceptional indi
viduals do not get this opportu
nity. In other words, a Stanford
education is not an entitlement.
The privilege current Stan
ford students enjoy is made pos
sible in large part by the gen
erosity of preceding generations
of students. These committed
individuals have accepted their
responsibilities to preserve Stan
ford's excellence and its avail
ability to subsequent genera
tions.
Alumni giving is at heart a
bequest from one generation of
students to the next of "rights,
privileges, honors and responsi
bilities." Thus, the moral obliga
tion and generosity of a Stanford
student or alumnus is not simply
to the institution — it is to one's
predecessors and successors.
Generosity is a special human
value and philanthropy is a spe
cial kind of generosity — its
Greek root literally means "lov
ing mankind." Stanford Univer
sity began with the philanthropy
of Jane and Leland Stanford on
behalf of "other people's" sons
and daughters — generations of
Stanford students yet to come.
Their commitment and responsi
bility passed a severe test very
early on.
Beginning with the founding
grant of 1885, Senator Stanford
personally paid for all University
expenses, from the construction
of buildings to the salaries of the

faculty. When he died, two years
after the University's opening,
his estate was entirely tied up in
probate, leaving Stanford literal
ly without a penny. Faced with
almost unanimous advice to
close the University, Jane Stan
ford squarely faced her responsi
bility: The University was to go
on, no matter what happened to
anything else. She was prepared
"to sacrifice her own property,
even her furniture, if necessary
to this end."
Indeed, when the court per
mitted her an allowance of
$10,000 a month, she kept only
$350. The rest was given to Pres
ident David Starr Jordan for
University purposes, including
paying the faculty reduced
salaries. Mrs. Stanford's biogra
pher, Gunther Nagel, writes
about these troubled years:
"Everyone — faculty, student,
worker — was united in a com
mon purpose. The University
took on a new meaning. The red
tiled roofs, the Quad, the Row,
the Chapel ... became symbols
of fortitude, faith and good cheer.
Salaries were cut with few com
plaints or thoughts of leaving. A
dealer furnished coal free for the
University power plant; mer
chants gave unlimited credit to
the needy. .. . Dr. Jordan
retained his natural optimism
and the students, with faith in
their leaders and the excitement
of fresh outlets in learning and
living, remained cheerful and
unconcerned."
Since that time, generations
of Stanford students, faculty
members and alumni have taken
up the mantle of responsibility
and moral obligation. Your turn
approaches to repay past genera
tions by passing on something to
future ones.
Jordan, Stanford's founding
president, at the end of our Uni
versity's second decade, said: "It
is said that Rome was not built
in one day, nor Stanford in a cen
tury; but it is being built, quiet
ly, honestly, steadfastly, stone
after stone. . .." In an age used
to hype and "dramatic" gestures,
few things in life are more dra
matic than the advances that
result from building Stanford in
that manner. I hope you will join
this tradition and feel the sense
of moral obligation, responsibili
ty and satisfaction of helping to
build Stanford, stone after stone.
