# They're coming to America
## Stanford still popular with foreign scholars 
### Stewart Maclennan Contributing writer 
According to a report released
last week by the Institute of Inter
national Education, the number

of foreign schol
ars at major re
search universi
ties in the United
States has de
clined for the sec
ond consecutive
year.
However, the
report noted that
Stanford's inter
nationally re-

nowned science and engineering
programs make it an exception to
this year's trend.
The study, entitled, "Open
Doors 1994-1995" found that a
total of 58,074 foreign scholars
were working at U.S. institutions
last year, a 3.3 percent decline to
1,907 fewer than the year before.

to major universities across the
United States as leading to re

ties at both the scholar and the
student level.
According to John Pearson, di
rector of Stanford's International

scholars at Stanford has increased
to roughly 2,600 undergraduate,
graduate and post-doctoral stu
dents, up 30 to 40 students from
last year.
"Stanford is doing extremely
well in attracting foreign scholars.

creasing over the past 10 to 15
years, and the caliber of the each
international student has been
particularly high," he said.
The institute's report lists
Stanford as having the third
largest international student body
as a percentage of total enroll
ment. Harvard and Columbia Uni
versities took the first and second
ranks.
Richard Krasno, a Stanford
graduate and president of the In
