# They're coming to America
## Stanford still popular with foreign scholars 
### Stewart Maclennan Contributing writer 
According to a report released
last week by the Institute of Inter
national Education, the number

of foreign schol
ars at major re
search universi
ties in the United
States has de
clined for the sec
ond consecutive
year.
However, the
report noted that
Stanford's inter
nationally re-

nowned science and engineering
programs make it an exception to
this year's trend.
The study, entitled, "Open
Doors 1994-1995" found that a
total of 58,074 foreign scholars
were working at U.S. institutions
last year, a 3.3 percent decline to
1,907 fewer than the year before.
The institute cited cuts in fed
eral government research grants
to major universities across the
United States as leading to re
duced support of exchange activi

ties at both the scholar and the
student level.
According to John Pearson, di
rector of Stanford's International
Center, the number of foreign
scholars at Stanford has increased
to roughly 2,600 undergraduate,
graduate and post-doctoral stu
dents, up 30 to 40 students from
last year.
"Stanford is doing extremely
well in attracting foreign scholars.
Our numbers have been slowly in
creasing over the past 10 to 15
years, and the caliber of the each
international student has been
particularly high," he said.
The institute's report lists
Stanford as having the third
largest international student body
as a percentage of total enroll
ment. Harvard and Columbia Uni
versities took the first and second
ranks.
Richard Krasno, a Stanford
graduate and president of the In
stitute of International Educa
tion, points to the University's
strong reputation overseas as the
most important reason why stu


Fetter
dents abroad are attracted to the
Farm.
"Students everywhere have
heard of Stanford and as a result a
much larger percentage of stu
dents apply than can be accept
ed," he said.
Stanford President Emeritus
Richard Lyman, who was an
active supporter of the Bechtel
International Center during his
presidency from 1970 to 1980,
also emphasized that it is Stan
ford's reputation which draws
international students.

"To my knowledge there has
not been a real recruitment effort
by the University," he said.
Lyman pointed out that the
majority of foreign scholars at
Stanford are graduate students.
"Over half of the Engineering
School's graduate students are
foreign. These students make up
for a relative lack of qualified
American applicants," he said.
According to Pearson, the rep
resentation of international stu
dents among undergraduates is
roughly 5 percent.
Lyman explained that the
smaller numbers of foreign stu
dents at the undergraduate level
is partly due to the difficulty of
judging student credentials from

schools outside of the Unites
States.
Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter, former dean of undergrad
uate admissions, noted that many
prospective international stu
dents are hesitant to attend Stan
ford because of the limited finan
cial aid allocated to them.
"It's a very expensive proposi
tion to enroll international stu
dents," she said. To her knowl
edge, Harvard is the only U.S.
institution which has unlimited
financial aid available for interna
tional students.
She also explained that at the
undergraduate level, Stanford
places a priority on American stu
dents.
