## Expectations lofty for hoops Montgomery's squad poised for Pac-10 title run 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Take everything you know about
Stanford men's basketball and turn it up
a notch — everything old is big again.
Bigger expectations (preseason rank
ings floating between ninth and 22nd), a
big-time schedule (a tournament in
North Carolina, where the Cardinal
might face the Tar Heels) and a bigger
team (a roster of 16 and each returning
player gained muscle during the offsea
son) make this the brightest start to any
year in recent history.
So what does this increase in national
attention mean for the Cardinal?
"I don't know if we're overrated as to
what we might be," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "Some people have
elevated us, but that's okay. It will pro
vide motivation for us."
That motivation may get downright
scary. Every player hit the weight room
in the offseason, and now the team looks
more like a body building club than a
traditional West Coast hoops team —
UCLA this isn't.
Each of the five returning starters
gained an average of eight pounds, with
junior point guard Brevin Knight lead
ing the way with a sculpted 18 pounds
added to his previously willowy frame.
The returning reserves added even more
muscle in a circular game of "who's got
the bigger bicep?"
"All the guys on the team like [lift
ing]," said senior forward Andy Poppink.
"All the guys like getting bigger and
stronger. When some people get bigger,
then other guys realize they need it for
practice so they don't get knocked
around as much."
Returning 95 percent of the scoring
from last year's 20-9 club that made it to
the second round of the NCAA Tourna
ment before losing to Massachusetts,
Stanford looked to be at least as good
just with its nine returning players. But
when Montgomery brought in the
strongest recruiting class of his 10 years

on the Farm, suddenly the potential
exploded into unseen territory.
"We think that we will be the best
team here since the 1942 team, when
they won the NCAA championship,"
Knight said.
Along with Poppink (10.8 points per
game, 5.9 rebounds last year) and
Knight (16.6 ppg, 6.6 assists, 2.8 steals),
the Cardinal has senior sharpshooter
Dion Cross (16.8 ppg, 48 percent three
point shooting), senior power forward
Darren Allaway (6.0 ppg, 4.4 rpg) and
sophomore center Tim Young (12.3 ppg,
8.6 rpg) rounding out the most experi
enced starting five in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. With senior guard and top
defender David Harbour (9.6 ppg) com
ing off the bench at the first sign of trou
ble, the core of last year's team is togeth-

er agam.
Add to that a freshman class of point
guard Arthur Lee, shooter Kris Weems,
forwards Pete Sauer and Mark Seaton,
center Andy McClelland (who is still
recovering from an anterior cruciate lig
ament tear he suffered his senior year of
high school), transfer Pete Van Elswyk
(from South Carolina) and walk-on for
ward Karl Wente to the returning bench
of junior forward Rich Jackson and
sophomore guards Kamba Tshionyi and
Mark Thompson and practice time
becomes fast and furious.
"The freshmen have really impressed
me," Allaway said. "I don't know how I
looked as a freshman, but I'm sure they

look a lot better than I did."
With 15 healthy bodies practicing
(McClelland is out until at least early
December, according to Montgomery),
intensity has reached a game-like state.
Last year, with all the aches and pains
sidelining players on a weekly basis,
practice was usually cut down to 10 play
ers. This year, it's every man for himself.
"It's not like going in short bullets,"
Montgomery said. "We definitely have
the bullets this year. Right now, we
don't know how they'll react once the
lights come on."
According to Knight, the only stated
goal of the season is to win the Pac-10.
As far as the tournament goes, last
year's "little taste" whetted the
appetites of the team.
"This year we feel like we can get
more of a taste," Knight said. "We have
so many veterans, if we don't go further
it will be a letdown."
Although the regular season doesn't
tip off until Thanksgiving weekend's
Fry's Invitational, fans get a chance to
preview this year's squad tonight at an
exhibition with the Mexican National
Team at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
"We're anxious," Knight said. "We're
ready to start playing. We've been going
against each other for 20-some days.
Now we're ready to play against some
body else and see how we click."
Currently on an eight-city tour of the
western United States, the Mexican
National Team lost to Arizona in its first
game 100-56.
Other highlights of this year's Cardi
nal schedule include a December trip
back east to face South Carolina in the
first round of the Diet Pepsi Tourna
ment of Champions in Charlotte, N.C.
and an intersectional matchup with
Seton Hall in the Bay Area Classic on
Feb. 2. Pac-10 play begins when Arizona
State comes to Stanford Jan. 4.

teams in the country, we have to play
