# Scott, Shasby and De Silva win the Rolex

Just in case someone forgot to tell the other tennis
teams in the tournament, Stanford and California
were very quick to remind their competitors that the
theme for this year's Women's Northwest Regional
Rolex Intercollegiate Championships was "Stanford
versus Cal." The schools are ranked third and sixth
respectively in the preseason top-25 poll, and they
certainly showed everyone why last weekend.
The top eight seeds of the tournament were either
from Stanford or Cal and the semifinals in singles fea
tured two Stanford-Cal matchups which led to a
Stanford-Cal clash in the final as well. Only one play
er not from either Stanford or Cal advanced as far as
the quarterfinals and just five players not from Stan
ford or Cal made it to the round of 16. Two Bears and
no Cardinal lost in the first round, and only three
Bears and one Cardinal lost to someone from a school
other than Stanford or Cal.
Stanford's dominance extended into the doubles
draw as well, with the final featuring Stanford's team
of senior Kim Shasby and sophomore Julie Scott
against Stanford's senior Beth Berris and junior
Emily Burt. Shasby and Scott, the No. 1 seeds, took
the match and the doubles title 6-2, 6-2 in a fashion
reminiscent of their dominant play throughout the
tournament. Berris and Burt also performed well,
upsetting No. 2-seeded Nicole Elliott and Dominique
Lao of Cal on their way to the final.
