# Scott, Shasby and De Silva win the Rolex
## 
### Robin Davidson 
Just in case someone forgot to tell the other tennis
teams in the tournament, Stanford and California
were very quick to remind their competitors that the
theme for this year's Women's Northwest Regional
Rolex Intercollegiate Championships was "Stanford
versus Cal." The schools are ranked third and sixth
respectively in the preseason top-25 poll, and they
certainly showed everyone why last weekend.
The top eight seeds of the tournament were either
from Stanford or Cal and the semifinals in singles fea
tured two Stanford-Cal matchups which led to a
Stanford-Cal clash in the final as well. Only one play
er not from either Stanford or Cal advanced as far as
the quarterfinals and just five players not from Stan
ford or Cal made it to the round of 16. Two Bears and
no Cardinal lost in the first round, and only three
Bears and one Cardinal lost to someone from a school
other than Stanford or Cal.
Stanford's dominance extended into the doubles
draw as well, with the final featuring Stanford's team
of senior Kim Shasby and sophomore Julie Scott
against Stanford's senior Beth Berris and junior
Emily Burt. Shasby and Scott, the No. 1 seeds, took
the match and the doubles title 6-2, 6-2 in a fashion
reminiscent of their dominant play throughout the
tournament. Berris and Burt also performed well,
upsetting No. 2-seeded Nicole Elliott and Dominique
Lao of Cal on their way to the final.
According to Shasby, playing
against her teammates proved
more difficult than any other
match. "It's tough," she said.
"You love to see your teammates
do well. You're used to cheering
for them (rather than playing
against them)."
Shasby also played well in sin
gles competition. She reached the
semifinals before falling to Cal's
Renaca Kolbovic 6-0, 6-4. On the
other side of the draw, Stanford
junior Sandra De Silva faced
Amanda Augustus of Cal. De
Silva's powerful ground strokes
proved to be the difference in a
tough match, and she advanced to
the finals 6-4, 0-6, 7-5.
De Silva faced Kolbovic in the
final for what proved to be the
most exciting match of the tour
nament. De Silva started off slow
ly, hitting shots wide and into the
net. Kolbovic took every advan
tage and raced to a 6-0 first set.
However, De Silva bounced back
at the start of the second set by
breaking Kolbovic's serve to win
her first game of the match and
take a 1-0 lead in the second set.
Suddenly, De Silva's shots
were hitting every line and racing
just out of Kolbovic's reach for
clean winners. Kolbovic was by no
means out of the match and con
tinued to force De Silva into long
rallies. But finally, after a crucial
service break in the seventh game
of the set, De Silva was able to
serve out the set at 6-4.

De Silva's newfound confi
dence flowed over into the final
set, and she quickly captured a 3-
0 advantage with two service
breaks. Kolbovic bounced back
with one service break of her own
to bring the match to 3-2, but an
incredible forehand winner from
De Silva in game six and a double
fault by Kolbovic in game seven
gave De Silva a 5-2 lead. Kolbovic
managed to stretch the match out
for a few more games, but De
Silva's passing shots proved too
much for Kolbovic. De Silva took
the match 0-6, 6-4, 6-4.
"I was going for a lot of big
shots [in the first set] and was not
being consistent," De Silva said.
"I was trying to win quick
points."
De Silva was more patient in
the second and third sets and
managed to force longer rallies.
"[Kolbovic] hits shorter shots
later in the rally," De Silva said.
By waiting for the shorter shot,
De Silva was able to do more with
her own shot and go for winners.
Coach Frank Brennan felt the
tournament went well for his
squad. "[We] have the singles and
doubles winner and the runner
up in doubles," he said. "Sandra
was clearly the hero. We need to
prepare her a little more to get
started [in a match]. She didn't
look good at all in the first set."
Brennan also said Sandra
improved throughout the tourna
ment with her serve, her ground
strokes and her quickness. "She's
learned how to slow up and be
patient," he said. "Most of our com
petition is done for the fall. Now we
can start working for the season."

much for Kolbovic. De Silva took
the match 0-6, 6-4, 6-4.
"I was going for a lot of big
shots [in the first set] and was not
being consistent," De Silva said.
"I was trying to win quick
points."
De Silva was more patient in
the second and third sets and
managed to force longer rallies.
"[Kolbovic] hits shorter shots
later in the rally," De Silva said.
By waiting for the shorter shot,
De Silva was able to do more with
her own shot and go for winners.
Coach Frank Brennan felt the
tournament went well for his
squad. "[We] have the singles and
doubles winner and the runner
up in doubles," he said. "Sandra
was clearly the hero. We need to
prepare her a little more to get
started [in a match]. She didn't
look good at all in the first set."
Brennan also said Sandra
improved throughout the tourna
ment with her serve, her ground
strokes and her quickness. "She's
learned how to slow up and be
patient," he said. "Most of our com
petition is done for the fall. Now we
can start working for the season."
