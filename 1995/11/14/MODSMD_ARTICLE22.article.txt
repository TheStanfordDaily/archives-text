# Cowboy choke is Barry's fault
## 
### 
After it was all said and done last Sunday, the
only thing left was for Deion Sanders to say,
"We got our butts kicked."
And the only thing left for Sanders and the rest of

his Dallas Cowboy
teammates to do was
look through that
gaping hole on top of
Texas Stadium, into
the heavens, at the
Lord and painstaking
ly wonder how things
could go so wrong, so
fast.
Just hours before,
the Cowboys were sit-

ting on top of the world. Dallas possessed the games
most potent offense with a cadre of stars like future
Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith, the league's best quar
terback Troy Aikman and"The Playmaker" Michael
Irvin. Add a Pro Bowl offensive line, a vacuum clean
er tight end and a fullback nicknamed the "Moose,"
and there was no stopping these guys.
Couple that offense with a fleet-footed, no-non
sense defense highlighted by the presence of Prime
Time himself, and you can bet that these Cowboys
were already making January travel plans to Tempe.
Add to that a nearly spotless 8-1 record and the fact


Daniel
Kao
that the Cowboys' most hated
nemesis, the San Francisco 49ers,
were limping into town with ass
whomping pasted across their
forehead, and life couldn't get
much better.
A funny thing happened to
these Cowboys on their way to
Lombardi Land, however. They
got the living daylights kicked,
beaten, bludgeoned and pum
meled out of them by the 49ers.
And the punch line of the
whole joke is that these very same
Niners were suppose to be the
whompees and not the whompers.
In fact, the stage had been set for
Dallas not only to make a state
ment, but in addition, to knock
out its arch-rival 49ers all in one
swooping blow.
After suffering two defeats last
season at the hands of Frisco, one
in the ever-crucial NFC title
game, the Cowboys still contend
ed they were the better team.
Smith was hobbled by a bad ham
string and Cowboy Erik Williams,
the best left tackle in the game,
was out because of an auto acci
dent, so Dallas still felt, despite
the two losses, that they were the
best team in the NFL. And who
was there to argue, especially
after owner Jerry Jones swung
perhaps the most publicized deal
of the century in acquiring Deion
Sanders from San Francisco?
Not only did the Niners lose
Sanders this offseason, but they
have also been hit hard by
injuries to the league's most

annoying player, William Floyd,
and MVP quarterback Steve
Young. San Francisco was also
reeling after losing two straight to
the likes of the New Orleans
'Aints and the expansion North
Carolina Panthers. Perched at a
precarious 5-4, this was Dallas'
opportunity of a lifetime to wreak
vengeance on the 49ers and stick
a stake through their hearts.
And don't think the Cowboys
didn t know it. There was enough
trash talking by Dallas before
hand to load up a landfill the size
of that Nike swoosh hanging on
top of Texas Stadium. The Cow
boys knew they were good, they
knew the 49ers weren't and they
had the smack-talking, chest
thumping bravado to prove it.
Something happens though when
a person becomes overly confi
dent, arrogant and proud. I
believe my ninth-grade English
teacher called it hubris.
Yes, the same disease which
afflicted the most glorious heroes
throughout history found yet
another victim in the Cowboys.
And because of it, another band of
great heroes fell — not to mention
the likelihood that the entire
empire could very well topple
because of Sunday's game.
Perhaps you think that I am
jumping to conclusions, but a
closer examination will reveal
that Sunday's loss sends a dis
turbing message to Cowboy fans
far and wide. Point No. 1 is that
the Cowboys have yet to beat San
Francisco in the Barry Switzer
era. That leads us to the question
of "Can they ever?"
Dallas was obviously flat Sun
day, as it was in last year's NFC

Championship game. But how
can Dallas possibly be flat for
either of those games? The stakes
were high in both games, yet the
Cowboys played with their heads
up their heinies. And I'd hate to
point fingers, but you have to
blame head coach Barry Switzer.
In true Jimmy Johnson fashion, I
would guarantee that the Cow
boys, with Johnson, would be
playing for their fourth consecu
tive Super Bowl now if the afore
mentioned head coach were on
the sidelines instead of in the tele
vision booth.
Switzer fiat out did not do his
job — any of it. From an X's and
O's standpoint, Switzer fell short.
With Jerry Rice as the lone
remaining Niner weapon, the
Cowboys left the middle of the
field wide open for him to romp
and run. Switzer's job in terms of
mental preparation was even
worse. So far he's 0-3 in pumping
his team up for the big game. It's
his job to make certain the hubris
doesn't set in and that his players
do their job. Of course, Switzer
wasn't the one that fumbled the
football or threw the interception,
but at the same time, the reason
those errors occurred was all psy
chological.
Now the question is whether or
not Dallas can come back and win
the NFC Championship in Jan
uary. The Cowboys have dug
themselves in a hole now after
missing the opportunity to blow
the Niners out of this season. Now,
no matter what, San Francisco
knows it can beat Dallas, even if it
has to play its practice squad. In
addition, even though Dallas is
still saying that it's the best team,

I m not sure the Cowboys believe
that they can play to beat the Nin
ers. Of course, like Sunday, I'm
sure they think they can just show
up and win, but I'm not sure if
they think they can win if they
actually have to play.
Even with over a day now to
think about the game, it's still dif
ficult to believe what happened.
Similar to the NFC Champi
onship game when the Niners
jumped out early, I was just pray
ing and wishing that I was still
asleep and the game hadn't start
ed yet. Or else, I was the only one
watching this bizarre game in an
alternate reality, and the rest of
the world was watching the real
game wherein the Cowboys were
kicking some Whiner butt. Alas,
neither was the case in either
game. Dallas simply blew it big
time. Both times.
Perhaps I'm not giving enough
credit to Frisco, but I still don't
think the Niners are anywhere
near Dallas. I'm not going to be
silly and blame the loss on the
Cowboys' "10th game jinx" (Dal
las has lost the 10th game of the
season nine consecutive years) or
the fact that S.F. hasn't lost three
in a row since 1980. No jinx. No
coincidence. The Niners, as Irvin
said, were just better . . .just this
game.
Hopefully, when next these
two teams meet, I'll be proven
right. Hopefully, Dallas will real
ize that when the ball is kicked
off, the game starts — not after
you're down by three scores. And
hopefully, the Cowboys won't
enter the game thinking that
they'll automatically win —
they'll just play that way.

these Cowboys on their way to
Lombardi Land, however. They
got the living daylights kicked,
beaten, bludgeoned and pum
meled out of them by the 49ers.
And the punch line of the
whole joke is that these very same
Niners were suppose to be the
whompees and not the whompers.
In fact, the stage had been set for
Dallas not only to make a state
ment, but in addition, to knock
out its arch-rival 49ers all in one
swooping blow.
After suffering two defeats last
season at the hands of Frisco, one
in the ever-crucial NFC title
game, the Cowboys still contend
ed they were the better team.
Smith was hobbled by a bad ham
string and Cowboy Erik Williams,
the best left tackle in the game,
was out because of an auto acci
dent, so Dallas still felt, despite
the two losses, that they were the
best team in the NFL. And who
was there to argue, especially
after owner Jerry Jones swung
perhaps the most publicized deal
of the century in acquiring Deion
Sanders from San Francisco?
Not only did the Niners lose
Sanders this offseason, but they
have also been hit hard by
injuries to the league's most

annoying player, William Floyd,
and MVP quarterback Steve
Young. San Francisco was also
reeling after losing two straight to
the likes of the New Orleans
'Aints and the expansion North
Carolina Panthers. Perched at a
precarious 5-4, this was Dallas'
opportunity of a lifetime to wreak
vengeance on the 49ers and stick
a stake through their hearts.
And don't think the Cowboys
didn t know it. There was enough
trash talking by Dallas before
hand to load up a landfill the size
of that Nike swoosh hanging on
top of Texas Stadium. The Cow
boys knew they were good, they
knew the 49ers weren't and they
had the smack-talking, chest
thumping bravado to prove it.
Something happens though when
a person becomes overly confi
dent, arrogant and proud. I
believe my ninth-grade English
teacher called it hubris.
Yes, the same disease which
afflicted the most glorious heroes
throughout history found yet
another victim in the Cowboys.
And because of it, another band of
great heroes fell — not to mention
the likelihood that the entire
empire could very well topple
because of Sunday's game.
Perhaps you think that I am
jumping to conclusions, but a
closer examination will reveal
that Sunday's loss sends a dis
turbing message to Cowboy fans
far and wide. Point No. 1 is that
the Cowboys have yet to beat San
Francisco in the Barry Switzer
era. That leads us to the question
of "Can they ever?"
Dallas was obviously flat Sun
day, as it was in last year's NFC

Championship game. But how
can Dallas possibly be flat for
either of those games? The stakes
were high in both games, yet the
Cowboys played with their heads
up their heinies. And I'd hate to
point fingers, but you have to
blame head coach Barry Switzer.
In true Jimmy Johnson fashion, I
would guarantee that the Cow
boys, with Johnson, would be
playing for their fourth consecu
tive Super Bowl now if the afore
mentioned head coach were on
the sidelines instead of in the tele
vision booth.
Switzer fiat out did not do his
job — any of it. From an X's and
O's standpoint, Switzer fell short.
With Jerry Rice as the lone
remaining Niner weapon, the
Cowboys left the middle of the
field wide open for him to romp
and run. Switzer's job in terms of
mental preparation was even
worse. So far he's 0-3 in pumping
his team up for the big game. It's
his job to make certain the hubris
doesn't set in and that his players
do their job. Of course, Switzer
wasn't the one that fumbled the
football or threw the interception,
but at the same time, the reason
those errors occurred was all psy
chological.
Now the question is whether or
not Dallas can come back and win
the NFC Championship in Jan
uary. The Cowboys have dug
themselves in a hole now after
missing the opportunity to blow
the Niners out of this season. Now,
no matter what, San Francisco
knows it can beat Dallas, even if it
has to play its practice squad. In
addition, even though Dallas is
still saying that it's the best team,

I m not sure the Cowboys believe
that they can play to beat the Nin
ers. Of course, like Sunday, I'm
sure they think they can just show
up and win, but I'm not sure if
they think they can win if they
actually have to play.
Even with over a day now to
think about the game, it's still dif
ficult to believe what happened.
Similar to the NFC Champi
onship game when the Niners
jumped out early, I was just pray
ing and wishing that I was still
asleep and the game hadn't start
ed yet. Or else, I was the only one
watching this bizarre game in an
alternate reality, and the rest of
the world was watching the real
game wherein the Cowboys were
kicking some Whiner butt. Alas,
neither was the case in either
game. Dallas simply blew it big
time. Both times.
Perhaps I'm not giving enough
credit to Frisco, but I still don't
think the Niners are anywhere
near Dallas. I'm not going to be
silly and blame the loss on the
Cowboys' "10th game jinx" (Dal
las has lost the 10th game of the
season nine consecutive years) or
the fact that S.F. hasn't lost three
in a row since 1980. No jinx. No
coincidence. The Niners, as Irvin
said, were just better . . .just this
game.
Hopefully, when next these
two teams meet, I'll be proven
right. Hopefully, Dallas will real
ize that when the ball is kicked
off, the game starts — not after
you're down by three scores. And
hopefully, the Cowboys won't
enter the game thinking that
they'll automatically win —
they'll just play that way.
After it was all said and done last Sunday, the
only thing left was for Deion Sanders to say,
"We got our butts kicked."
And the only thing left for Sanders and the rest of

his Dallas Cowboy
teammates to do was
look through that
gaping hole on top of
Texas Stadium, into
the heavens, at the
Lord and painstaking
ly wonder how things
could go so wrong, so
fast.
Just hours before,
the Cowboys were sit-

ting on top of the world. Dallas possessed the games
most potent offense with a cadre of stars like future
Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith, the league's best quar
terback Troy Aikman and"The Playmaker" Michael
Irvin. Add a Pro Bowl offensive line, a vacuum clean
er tight end and a fullback nicknamed the "Moose,"
and there was no stopping these guys.
Couple that offense with a fleet-footed, no-non
sense defense highlighted by the presence of Prime
Time himself, and you can bet that these Cowboys
were already making January travel plans to Tempe.
Add to that a nearly spotless 8-1 record and the fact


Daniel
Kao
that the Cowboys' most hated
nemesis, the San Francisco 49ers,
were limping into town with ass
whomping pasted across their
forehead, and life couldn't get
much better.
