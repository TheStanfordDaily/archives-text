# Cowboy choke is Barry's fault
## 
### 
After it was all said and done last Sunday, the
only thing left was for Deion Sanders to say,
"We got our butts kicked."
And the only thing left for Sanders and the rest of

his Dallas Cowboy
teammates to do was
look through that
gaping hole on top of
Texas Stadium, into
the heavens, at the
Lord and painstaking
ly wonder how things
could go so wrong, so
fast.
Just hours before,
the Cowboys were sit-

ting on top of the world. Dallas possessed the games
most potent offense with a cadre of stars like future
Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith, the league's best quar
terback Troy Aikman and"The Playmaker" Michael
Irvin. Add a Pro Bowl offensive line, a vacuum clean
er tight end and a fullback nicknamed the "Moose,"
and there was no stopping these guys.
Couple that offense with a fleet-footed, no-non
sense defense highlighted by the presence of Prime
Time himself, and you can bet that these Cowboys
were already making January travel plans to Tempe.
Add to that a nearly spotless 8-1 record and the fact
