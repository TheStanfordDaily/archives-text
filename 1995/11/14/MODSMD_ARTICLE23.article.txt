# Golf stumbles at Hilton Head
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Coming off a big win at home and playing
against the nation's best, Stanford men's golf
hoped to post a strong finale to what has been a
turbulent fall season. Unfortunately, things didn't
go quite its way.
The Cardinal emerged from the fray battered
and worn last weekend at the Palmetto Dunes Col
legiate Invitational in Hilton Head, S.C., limping
to a 12th-place finish in the 18-team field. Stan
ford shot a team score of 887 over the three-day,
54-hole event, 22 strokes behind surprising cham
pion East Tennessee State.
"We were kind of disappointed," said senior
David Garcia. "We really came into the meet on a
high from last weekend, so it was hard to play the
way we did."
The squad broke out of a slump a week ago,
cruising to a 30-stroke victory in the Stanford Fall
Invitational hosted at the team's home course.
However, the teams at that event were not
nearly as competitive as the ones the Cardinal
faced in South Carolina. Last weekend's field
included the top 15 teams in the nation, drawing
national title favorite Florida, defending national
champion Oklahoma State and West Coast power
house Arizona State.
"We didn't play that poorly," Garcia said. "We
just didn't play well.
"If you expect to compete in a tournament like
this one, where all the teams are of such a high cal

iber, you really have to bring your game up a level.
Stanford's lone bright spot was sophomore All-
American Tiger Woods, who fired a 6-under-par
210 to tie for first through regulation. Woods lost
on the first playoff hole to Oklahoma's Grant Mas
son, who sank a clutch 30-foot birdie putt to seal
the victory.
The rest of the team fared worse, with fresh
man Joel Kribel shooting a 224 to place second or
the team and tie for 40th overall. Senior captain
Jerry Chang and junior Conrad Ray finished three
and six strokes behind in ties for 57th- and 63rd
place, respectively.
A large part of the Cardinal's problem was the
poor weather on the island. What was supposed tc
be a clear, mild weekend turned ugly as a colc
front hit. Moderately high winds plagued the play
ers on the second day and frigid temperatures
added to the misery for the final round. Not sur
prisingly, scores in general skyrocketed for those
two days.
"It was definitely not like anything we've
encountered in Palo Alto this year," Garcia said
"That's no excuse though. The teams that wert
prepared for this kind of weather did well and w(
just weren't ready for it."
While last weekend's event marked the fina
tournament of the fall schedule, Stanford will noi
have the opportunity to sit back and relax.
"If anything, this tournament is a motivator foi
us," Garcia said. "I think this team has a really
good attitude as a whole and that will help us tak<
something from the experience."
