# Clean sweep
## Sailors rout at North/South 
### Elisabeth Krebs Contributing writer 
It seems the Stanford sailing team is
incapable of losing. With another success
ful weekend down at Santa Barbara's
North / South Intersectional regatta, the
Cardinal added yet another win to its sea
son, strengthening its reputation as the
all-around force of the West.
Nineteen schools showed up at the
North / South event ready to fight for a
much-desired first place. Among them, the
most competitive teams came from Cali
fornia, USC and Hawaii.
When it was all over, Stanford left these
three squads and many more struggling at
the starting line while it sailed swiftly past
the finish line. Overall, Stanford finished
with 106 points compared to Cal's 164,
USC's 173 and Hawaii's 174. Stanford not
only won overall, but it also won each of
the four divisions.
Sophomores John Meade and Heather
Rogers sailed in Division A and posted one
of their greatest regattas of the season.
Head coach Steve Bourdow said they sailed
more aggressively than any other team,
committing no errors and completely dom
inating their last two races.
"Meade and Rogers did everything
right," Bourdow said. "Even with a
sketchy breeze and challenging conditions
in eir last race, they held on, concentrat
ed only on winning and didn't allow them
selves to be distracted."
Senior Adam Lowry and sophomore

Mara Holian captured Division B. The tan
dem ruled the division from beginning to
end. Lowry and Holian won six out of their
eight races, sailing fast and conservatively.
"They nailed every start and sailed with
really awesome speed," Bourdowsaid. "It's
the best I've seen them sail so far."
Junior Alice Manard took first in Divi
sion C. Winning her first four races, she
had a huge lead afler Saturday's competi
tion. On Sunday, however, she encoun
tered a little trouble in one race because of
a bad start and garnered a lOth-place fin
ish. However, she made up for her mistake
by placing first in her last race.
Freshman Tyler Doyle triumphed in
Division D. Doyle only won a couple races
but never dropped below fourth. He fin
ished with a 10-point lead over the USC
boat.
"Doyle was solid, although he may not
be completely satisfied with his overall per
formance," Bourdow said. "Considering
the low level of competition within his divi
sion, I think he expected to win by a larger
margin."
Two Stanford teams also sailed in the
JV divisions of the regatta. Freshman Tay
lor Robinson and junior Barry Kang placed
third out of 38 teams in Division A, and
freshmen Steve Kleha and Adrienne Stolz
placed third in Division B. Sailing against
skilled alumni, both teams struggled a bit,
but performed well considering the talent
in their divisions. Stanford alumni cap
tured both JV divisions, reaffirming the
strength of the Stanford sailing program.
