Stanford crew took to the cold
waters of the Northwest last Sun
day, competing in the Head of the
Lake in Seattle, Wash. The
women's team finished third
among U.S. teams and fifth over
all, while the men came in fourth
in the collegiate ranks and eighth

overall. Both squads performed
well considering the competition
they faced, which included top
rowing schools Washington and
Victoria, B.C.
The course stretched three
miles and included a difficult 180-
degree turn which posed a chal

water in a 1000-meter stretch of
the course also increased rowing
difficulty, but Stanford coxswains
successfully maneuvered through
the tumultuous waters.
The women's team performed
above expectations. It finished in
18 minutes, 31 seconds, only 43
seconds behind first-place Wash
ington. Entering the race, Stan
ford had hoped to finish less than
a minute behind the nationally
ranked Huskies.
The Cardinal also showed
improvement by following only 12
seconds behind runner-up Wash

ington State. The Cougars had beat -
en Princeton the week before by one
second. In the Head of the Charles a
month ago, Stanford lost to Prince
ton by 40 seconds, a dramatic differ
ence from its latest performance.
"We went up there to accom
plish a few things and we did,"
said head coach Aimee Baker.
The Cardinal also gained valu
able experience in Washington.
Freshman recruits Jana Watson,
Katie Sears and Emily Johnson
raced with the team for the first
time.
"It's a whole new type of com
petition,-' Watson said. "You're
racing for Stanford. It's exciting."
The women hope to continue
performing at its new level this
weekend in an important San

Mateo race which will conclude
the fall season. "[Our team's per
formance Sunday! sets a good
tone for this next weekend. It
puts us in a good position," Baker
said. "We're focused and excited."
The men's team also per
formed well in Washington, espe
cially considering that many of
the varsity rowers remained
home and JV rowers competed
instead. The squad finished one
minute, 20 seconds behind the
first-place Huskies. Although the
team rowed competently, it had
hoped for a better performance.
"There were no fireworks, but
it went as expected," said head
coach Wieslaw Kujda. "The guys
rowed a regular piece."
The difficulty in maintaining

concentration during the unusual
ly long race might account for part
of the disappointment. The course
and level of competition demanded
a higher level of focus that the
team failed to maintain. The high
waves in one part of the course also
slowed the Cardinal considerably.
Before encountering turbulent
waters in the middle of the course,
the team only trailed Washington
by 15 seconds. Fighting the waves
instead of rowing with them
caused an unrecoverable delay.
Nonetheless, the men feel con
fident that their experience will
pay off in future outings.
"It was a good lesson," Kujda
said. "I prefer we learn it now
instead of in the (more critical)
spring season."
