## The 						Grape Vote Educating the campus 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
Confrontation and controversy
surrounded last night's discussion
of grapes, as panelists argued over
whether Stanford dormitories
should support the United Farm
Workers' boycott of the fruit.
A highly partisan audience of
about 150 turned out for the Cub
berley Auditorium panel, which
was entitled "Grapes in the '90s:
Arguments For and Against Serv
ing Grapes at Stanford."
The panel included Dolores
Huerta, vice president and co
founder of the United Farm Work
ers (UFWi; Carmen Garza and
Phillip Maxwell of the Grape
Workers and Farmers Coalition;
Elizabeth Boret from Veritable
Vegetable, an organic produce dis

tributor; and senior Elvira Prieto,
one of the participants of the May
1994 student hunger strike which
demanded a University-wide boy
cott on grapes.
The audience, which often
cheered for Huerta when she
spoke, jeered and shouted at many
of Maxwell's remarks.
Moderator Luis Fraga, associ
ate political science professor and
chair of the University Grape Pol

icy Committee, began and ended
the panel by urging the audience to
become educated about the issue,
and to educate others. He harshly
criticized a recent editorial in The
Daily for, as he put it, "urging igno
rance" about the issue.
"The Daily editorial effectively
said that it is okay to bury your
head in the sand," said Fraga.
Huerta discussed the past suc
cess in UFW-urged boycotts in get
ting dangerous pesticides banned.
"This is why we are asking peo
ple to continue support," said
Huerta. "I think that we have to
use our power as consumers to pre
vent this (pesticide use)."
Prieto, one of the four students
who fasted for three days during
the 1994 hunger strike, talked

about how her family works and
lives in the grape fields where the
pesticides are sprayed.
"When the tractors come
through and people are spraying,
(pesticide residue] gets all over the
place," she said, urging students to
take action against this practice.
On the other side of the issue,
Garza accused the UFW of using
the pesticides issue to gain union
contracts and public support, call
ing the UFW's boycott "a tool to get
publicity and money from their
high-tech mailings."
"The boycott did not start
because of pesticides, but because
of politics," she said.
"Do not bury your head in the
sand, but give us credit for making
our own decisions," said Garza,
pointing out that a highly effective
boycott would deprive grape work
ers of jobs.
Maxwell accused the Universi
ty's "education" process of being

biased.
"Prof. Fraga may believe that
what is going on is education, but
the end game is to hurt me and my
farm workers," he said.
He also criticized the UFW for
singling out grapes for a boycott,
saying that pesticide use is preva
lent with other crops.
In order to end the boycott,
Huerta said, pesticide regulation
must be taken out of the California
Department of Agriculture, saying
that grape growers have been fight
ing such a move "tooth and nail."
Pesticide regulation "is not a
political issue; this is a health
issue," she said, saying it should be
a Health Department matter.
Maxwell carefully noted Huer
ta's statement and said he person
ally "did not care" about which
department handled pesticide reg
ulation, but refused to speak for
the whole of the Grape Workers
and Farmers Coalition.
