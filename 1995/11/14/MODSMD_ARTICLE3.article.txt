Confrontation and controversy
surrounded last night's discussion
of grapes, as panelists argued over
whether Stanford dormitories
should support the United Farm
Workers' boycott of the fruit.
A highly partisan audience of
about 150 turned out for the Cub
berley Auditorium panel, which
was entitled "Grapes in the '90s:
Arguments For and Against Serv
ing Grapes at Stanford."
The panel included Dolores
Huerta, vice president and co
founder of the United Farm Work
ers (UFWi; Carmen Garza and
Phillip Maxwell of the Grape
Workers and Farmers Coalition;
Elizabeth Boret from Veritable
Vegetable, an organic produce dis

tributor; and senior Elvira Prieto,
one of the participants of the May
1994 student hunger strike which
demanded a University-wide boy
cott on grapes.
The audience, which often
cheered for Huerta when she
spoke, jeered and shouted at many
of Maxwell's remarks.
Moderator Luis Fraga, associ
ate political science professor and
chair of the University Grape Pol
