# While clouds loom, aid may weather the storm
## Stanford prepares for Class of 2000's financial needs 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Last week, in the face of deep
rumblings in Washington, D.C.,
and disheartening economic fig
ures from Main Street, U.S.A., the
University's Financial Aid Office
began to formulate approximations
of need-based awards for the Class
of 2000.
Forced to start quickly due to
the University's new early decision
program, the office began figuring
out exactly how the University will
meet the demonstrated need of
every admitted student, as it does
eveiy year. What they may have
discovered in those calculations is
that the University is in a surpris
ingly good financial situation, de
spite several ominous long-term
trends.
Chief among these trends is a
continuing increase in tuition,
which simply makes financial aid
more expensive. But economic data
showing slow income growth for
portions of the middle class and the
politically controversial prospect of
shrinking government expendi
tures have also caused some con
cern among University officials.
Overall, University finances
seem sound enough to uphold its
commitment to "need-blind" ad
missions. But maintaining its abili
ty to provide for students with all

levels of financial need does not
promise to be easy in coming years.
A look at the numbers
As it stands, Stanford is among
the most generous universities in

the country. The University gives
out the highest average need-based
grant of any "national university"
surveyed by U.S. News and World


Dongmin Shim — Daily
Report.
The University awarded
$15,045 to the average financial
aid recipient in this year's incom-

ing freshman
class. Second
place MIT
grants $14,715
to its needy
students, while
Harvard gives
out $12,532 on
average.
The Univer
sity also stands

out, along with MIT and Dart
mouth College, as one of only
three universities on the list whose
average grant cuts more than half
from the university's total cost.
However, the percentage of
admitted students who receive a
grant is relatively low, at 40 per
cent. In part because of that fig
ure, Stanford ranks only fifth
among 50 national universities
listed as "best buys" by U.S.
News.
Not all need-based awards are
funded directly by the University.
A portion of the funding for such
awards comes from the federal
government, either as guaranteed
loans — private loans offered at a
low interest rate, which provide up
to $5,500 in aid — or direct grants
to students and the University.
Federal Pell grants go directly to
students, with a maximum award
of $2,340; the University, with
help from the government, also
provides low-cost Perkins loans to
low-income students.
It is still undecided how much
of this year's financial aid package
will be paid for by outside sources.
According to Director of Student
Awards Cynthia Rife, the need
estimates that will be sent to stu
dents next month as part of the
early decision program will list
financial aid awards based only on
the calculated need of students,
without specifying the actual

sources of funding used to meet
that need.
Rife says there is little reason
for concern about this year's need
based awards, since no current
federal legislation would reduce
overall access to student loans.
But she acknowledged that if fed
eral funding for some forms of
financial aid should unexpectedly
drop, then the University would
have to scramble to meet the
needs of early-decision students
with its own grants, loans or
scholarships.
Honoring a commitment
University policy, according to
Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid James Montoya, is closely tied
to its "strong commitment" to
need-blind admissions, as well as
to its affirmative action efforts.
A "need-blind" policy means
that admissions officers under
Montoya are prohibited from tak
ing a student's financial situation
into account when deciding which
students are allowed to enroll.
Montoya said this policy has
been in place "for as long as the
University has had a modern
admissions office," or more than
40 years. He also stressed that
need-blind admissions distinguish
the University from competing
institutions, some of whom do not
adhere to such policies.
At Brown University, for exam
ple, borderline applications may be
decided based on financial data,
though Brown Admissions Officer
Melisa Lai said such decisions are
only made at the end of the admis
sions calendar and would not
affect more than a handful of stu
dents in any given year.
Stanford is also unique in its
ability to provide funds for low
income students. Changes in eligi
bility requirements for federal
funds have led some schools, but
not Stanford, to de-emphasize
their support for low-income stu
dents, Montoya said.
At the same time, financial-aid
officers acknowledge that pres
sures are mounting on low-income
loans. The University's budget

projected last year that direct gov
ernment grants to students would
increase by only 0.7 percent in the
next fiscal year. According to Bud
get Director Tim Warner, the
amount of money the University
received from external sources for
student aid was the same in 1993
as it was in 1989, and government
funding has been "flat" for the
past several years. In particular,
this stagnation aflects efforts to
help low-income students, Mon
toya said.
Sue Wood, who administers the
Perkins loan program for the
financial aids office, said "funds
are limited" in such programs —
which give money directly to low
income students — thus limiting
the number of students that can
be directly helped.
Montoya said the continuing
low funding levels makes the Uni
versity's commitment to affirma
tive action all the more important.
"In some ways, the damage has
already been done," he said. "It
requires those of us who are
admissions officers and financial
aid officers to encourage students
to apply to 'high-cost' independent
institutions. ... Some of the insti
tutions which from their perspec
tive may cost the most are the
same institutions in many cases
which are in the best position to
offer them financial aid."
An increasing contribution?
One reason the University's
average award figures are so high
may be that tuition has been
steadily increasing over the past
five years, from $14,280 in the
1991-92 school year to $19,695
this year.
Tuition, as well as room and
board charges and other college
related expenses, has a direct
effect on the amount of money the
University spends on financial aid,
since the University promises to
help every admitted student pay
tuition, as long as he demonstrates
financial need.
At the same time, Montoya
said, "federal support has become
a smaller percentage of overall

financial aid figures." Thus a larg
er percentage of the University's
own money is going to cover finan
cial aid.
On the other side of the income
expenditure equation, the higher
tuition gets, the more money is
available as "unrestricted funds"
used to fill the gaps in financial aid
funding.
According to Assoc. Budget
Director Dana Shelley, though, the
University's financial aid budget is
set by first determining the
amount of aid required to meet
students' need, then looking to
various sources of funding to pro
vide that money.
Only after funds specifically
designated for financial aid —
such as government aid, gifts from
alumni and even a certain portion
of the University's endowment —
were taken into consideration
would tuition money be used, she
said.
Nonetheless, statistics provided
by the Budget Office showing con
tinued increases in the amount of
unrestricted funds being used to
meet students' financial need do
indicate an increasing contribu
tion from unrestricted funds.
In fiscal year 1994, $17.7 mil
lion of the $46 million the Uni
versity spent on financial aid
came from unrestricted funds,
Budget Director Timothy Warner
said, amounting to a 7.9 percent
increase over the previous year.
In 1995, the fiscal year that
ended this fall, the use of unre
stricted funds increased by 13
percent.
University predictions for the
current fiscal year indicate a
much lower increase of 5.2 per
cent, making it the second year in
the last five in which the percent
age increase in the portion of
financial aid spending coming
directly out of the University bud
get was lower than the annual
tuition increase.
Shelley attributed the smaller
increase in part to a shift in fund
raising efforts that occurred
when the University's annual
alumni donation campaign was

renamed the Stanford Fund last
year. According to Development
Officer Nancy Wells, the Stanford
Fund raised $3.8 million last year.
Of that money, 65 percent, or $2.5
million, was designated to go to
financial aid.
Money raised by the fund-rais
ing effort is not considered unre
stricted funds, Shelley said,
though alumni are no longer given
the option to simply check a box
indicating they want money to go
to financial aid.
She added that big increases in
the use of unrestricted funds in
recent years reflect a larger supply
of funds more than an increasing
overall cost to the University.
Long-term options
The long-term economic pic
ture cannot be said to favor con
tinuing financial aid at the same
level.
The Republican Congress, as
part of its effort to balance the fed
eral budget deficit in seven years,
has proposed changes to financial
aid legislation that could end up
costing both students and the Uni
versity, although current efforts
would have little immediate
impact on overall access to finan
cial aid.
To begin with, there are pro
posed changes to the student loan
program that would save the gov
ernment anywhere from $5 billion
to $10 billion on its loan guaran
tees. Savings would come by elimi
nating the six-month waiting peri
od on student loans, as well as cuts
to the direct-lending program in
which the government itself loans
money to students.
The University does not partic
ipate in the direct-lending pro
gram, so that portion of the legis
lation would not affect tuition,
though students would pay for the
elimination of the waiting period
through higher interest payments.
Also, proposed changes could
limit access to Pell grant funds for
some legal immigrants. So far this
year, 151 legal immigrants attend
ing Stanford have received
$275,000 in Pell grant funds.

The ultimate impact of such
changes is undetermined, as dif
ferences between House and Sen
ate versions of various budget
related bills — as well as differ
ences between the White House
and Congress — remain to be
worked out.
But the current government cli
mate would seem to shut out the
possibility of an increased govern
ment role in funding financial aid.
Larry Horton, the University's
chief negotiator in Washington,
said recently, referring to overall
funding for the University, "If
you're very successful in Washing
ton, you'll be about where you
were" the year before.
Economic trends pointing to
"harder, leaner times" for large
portions of the middle class could
also be a long-term problem for
the University, said George
Dekker, associate dean of gradu
ate study.
If income stagnates as it has in
recent years, while tuition contin
ues to increase, more families will
qualify for financial aid, meaning
increased costs for the University.
Rife said a slowdown in the rate
of home value inflation, which she
said has slowed in the 1990s from
the real estate boom of the 1980s,
would also affect the determina
tion of need for the majority of
applicants. The University cur
rently uses a supplemental appli
cation, asking for information
related to parents' home equity, to
determine a family's financial
need.
The one bright spot in Universi
ty finances may be the prospect of
increased private donations. This
year, a gift left by two Christian
Scientist sisters will add $35 mil
lion to University coffers. The year
before that, the founders of
Hewlett-Packard offered $77.4
million, the largest single donation
to the University ever.
But there remains no easy
answer to the continuing finan
cial-aid difficulty. As Dekker put
it,"the problems of middle-class
parents is something the Universi
ty has recognized for a long time."
