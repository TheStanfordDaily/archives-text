# While clouds loom, aid may weather the storm
## Stanford prepares for Class of 2000's financial needs 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Last week, in the face of deep
rumblings in Washington, D.C.,
and disheartening economic fig
ures from Main Street, U.S.A., the
University's Financial Aid Office
began to formulate approximations
of need-based awards for the Class
of 2000.
Forced to start quickly due to
the University's new early decision
program, the office began figuring
out exactly how the University will
meet the demonstrated need of
every admitted student, as it does
eveiy year. What they may have
discovered in those calculations is
that the University is in a surpris
ingly good financial situation, de
spite several ominous long-term
trends.
Chief among these trends is a
continuing increase in tuition,
which simply makes financial aid
more expensive. But economic data
showing slow income growth for
portions of the middle class and the
politically controversial prospect of
shrinking government expendi
tures have also caused some con
cern among University officials.
Overall, University finances
seem sound enough to uphold its
commitment to "need-blind" ad
missions. But maintaining its abili
ty to provide for students with all

levels of financial need does not
promise to be easy in coming years.
A look at the numbers
As it stands, Stanford is among
the most generous universities in

the country. The University gives
out the highest average need-based
grant of any "national university"
surveyed by U.S. News and World
