# Racial issues misreported, Mabry says
## 
### James G. Wheaton Contributing writer 
Mainstream American media has failed to
report fairly on race-related issues, Newsweek
correspondent Marcus Mabry charged in an
address last night to about 40 people in Histo
ry Corner.
Mabry, who is currently working for
Newsweek in Paris and will soon become the

magazine's Johannesburg bureau chief, grad
uated from Stanford in 1988 with a degree in
international relations. He also holds a mas
ter's in English from the University.
In the coverage of both the O.J. Simpson
Trial and the"Million Man March" on Wash
ington, Mabry said, Americans "have glimpsed
the nation's media responsibility, or better, ir
responsibility"
"[Journalists] put Farrakhan in a historical

context of black separatism, but not sepa
ratism in its historical context as a non-exclu
sive tool in combination with integration," he
said.
While Mabry claimed that most Simpson
coverage was "pretty lousy," he said even the
best reporting revealed the inherent bias of
other media outlets, including their tendency
to choose only the statistics that
show us "the most polarized" rela
tions between blacks and whites."
"Sixty percent of white Ameri
cans think the jury did its job. Why
do we not hear about that?" he
asked.
The media's poor ability to accu
rately report racial issues is a result
of a desire to sensationalize, Mabry
said. Reporters and editors seem
uninterested in covering the mun
dane day-to-day realities of diverse
people coexisting, he said.
Instead, "we prefer sexy stories"
in the mainstream media, Mabry
said, citing Stanford as a case in
point.
"Newspapers look for tension.
The mainstream media never
wrote about multiculturalism at

Stanford, when were learning
about pain and tolerance and coop
erating. But when the Secretary of
Education and the president of the
University had a debate, then (the
media reported that) we were dis
emboweling Western culture,"
Mabry said, referring to a 1988
debate between then-University
President Donald Kennedy and
then-Secretary of Education
William Bennett.
Problems also exist with the
lack of racial diversity and sensitiv
ity among the staff of major media
groups, particularly weekly news
magazines like Newsweek, Mabry
said.
News magazines "are the last
bastion of the Ivy League old boys
and girls club. We are the worst in
that respect," he said.
Mabry sees a lack of diversity
throughout the media industry,
saying that blacks are "an exotic
ornament, not an intrinsic part" of

journalistic ranks. He cited a
Newsweek story claiming gangsta
rap as typical of rap in general. The
story was written by a white male
who had never listened to rap, and
ran with a cover photo of rapper
Tone Loc, the writer of what
Mabry termed "rap's most playful
ditties."
Mabry sees no easy way of
redressing the failure of the media
to accurately report on racial
issues. Because the mainstream
media "usually doesn't learn from
its mistakes," the responsibility for
change may be incumbent upon
the readers, he said.
"First, you must make receiving
news an active process. Watch crit
ically and ask why they write
things from a certain bias," he said.
"Second, you must keep us honest.
You must write, phone, picket or e
mail us when we get it wrong."
"You can and must make the
difference."
