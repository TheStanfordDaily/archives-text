# RAGE works to 'disorient' Farm
## Guide tells alternative history 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Just when freshmen were beginning to get set
tled in, the Stanford Disorientation Guide, a new
student publication, aims to challenge traditional
perspectives on University history.
The guide, which has been distributed to all
freshmen, covers a diversity of concerns, detailing
issues from the cancellation of women's self defense
classes on campus to the divestment campaign
against Exxon.
"Freshmen — and upperclassmen — have all
heard the rhetoric of the University," senior Chris
tine Dehlendorf said. "This is another perspective,
the option of political activism."
Dehlendorf said freshmen were targeted specifi
cally because they might be unfamiliar with campus
issues of recent years.
"The guide creates an institutional memory. Year
to year, there's a high student turnover," junior
Julie Leadbetter said. The guide "shows the history
of activism and what the context is for events."
Dehlendorf stressed that the guide is a useful re
source for upperclassmen as well.
The guide's directions to a crossword puzzle
states, "If you're having a difficult time, here's a
hint — don't rely on upperclasspeople for the an
swers, 'cause they might not know themselves. Find
out on your own."
Moreover, Leadbetter said the guide "provides an
alternative framework of analysis, different from
other campus periodicals or the University."
Three years ago, Leadbetter took a directed read
ing in alternative education from former Education
Prof. Ronald Glass.
"At the time, I was working on the creation of eth
nic studies," Leadbetter said. "He gave me advice on
organizing principles."
Glass then showed Lead better a copy of a Disori
entation Guide, from UC-Berkeley He suggested
that she create an up-to-date version for Stanford,
Leadbetter said.
"(Junior) Kris Hayashi and I both met with him,
and wrote a few articles the summer after freshman
year," Leadbetter said. "There weren't enough peo-
pie though, to put out an issue."
Last summer, the student
group Resistance Action Grass
roots Organization Fducation
(RAGE) started to work on the
guide again.
"It's been a long evolution of
groups and ideas," Leadbetter
said.
RAGE was originally formed

last year in response to Proposi
tion 187, an initiative that
sparked the debate on illegal
immigrants' rights.
After the election, group mem
bers decided to create an organiza
tion that would work with their
social and political concerns, instead
of reorganizing each time another
issue came up, Dehlendorf said.
"We wrote on issues that con
nect to Stanford and surrounding
communities," Dehlendorf said.
"We want to show how the cam
pus is part of a broader political

climate."
The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice provided the group with an ini
tial $500, which covered the pro
duction costs of the first 500 copies.
An additional $500 grant from the
Asian American Students Associa
tion paid for another 500 copies.
"We'd love to do more issues,"
Dehlendorf said. "It's just a mat
ter of funding."
Dehlendorf added, "We hope
that people become more aware,
to realize that there's more to
Stanford."
