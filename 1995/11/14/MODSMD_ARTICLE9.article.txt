Israel accelerates Rabin's peace plans
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel handed over the West Bank
town of Jenin to PLO rule a week early yesterday in a sign of Prime
Minister Shimon Peres' determination to pursue and even acceler
ate his slain predecessor's peace policies.
Peres met with his main right-wing rival yesterday and the two
promised to restore "restraint and civility" to the bitter political
debate that cost Yitzhak Rabin his life.
Thousands of Palestinians lined the streets of Jenin to welcome
arriving busloads of PLO troops as Israel's army pulled out under
the autonomy accord that Rabin signed with Yasser Arafat in
September at the White House.
The move indicated Peres may press even more vigorously than
Rabin toward a final Palestinian settlement and peace with Syria.
That could require Israel to give up the strategic Golan Heights,
captured in a 1967 war.
"W T e must continue with the peace process. This is what Yitzhak
wanted," Peres told the Knesset, Israel's parliament, at a special
session to honor Rabin. "We will make a deep, truthful decision."
