Should Stanford's
Food Research Institute
be Killed?
NO, say knowledgeable scholars and experts, including*
D. Gale Johnson, Eliakim Hastings Moore Distinguished Service
Professor Emeritus, Department of Economics, University of Chicago:
"The work of the Food Research Institute is directly relevant to the life
and work of well over half of the world's population. . . . Stanford is
a world university, not just a university in Northern California or the
Western United States."
David K. Leonard, Professor of Political Science, UC-Berkeley:
"Although the FRI does much more than just agricultural economics,
it certainly would be classified as one of the top three graduate
departments in that field in the United States today (with Cornell and
Berkeley). Just as important, it is alone among the good departments
in being privately endowed. . . . Stanford's FRI. . .has played a role
in international food and agricultural research that [is] far
disproportionate to its human and material resources."
Robert W. Herdt, D irector for Agricultural Sciences, The
Rockefeller Foundation:
"I learned with some considerable dismay there is a possibility that
the FRI may suffer a reduction in program support. If this happened,
Stanford, the nation, and the world would all be the poorer. FRI is
one of just a handful of institutions where food-related policy issues
from any place on the globe have been treated with professional
excellence on a continuing basis."
William C. Clark, Sidney Harman Professor of International
Science, Public Policy and Human Development, John F. Kennedy
School of Government, Harvard University:
"If America's elite universities abdicate their responsibilities for
wrestling with the difficult challenges of keeping scholarship
grounded in and engaged with the real world, how can less self
confident institutions be expected to carry on? I can only hope that
Stanford's faculty and administration will think very seriously about
the place that FRI has played, and should continue to play, in their
institution's history."
Whitney MacMillan, Chairman of the Board, Cargill Corp.:
"Speaking both for Cargill as an institution and myself as an
individual, I hope [the Stanford review committee] will concur with us
that the Food Research Institute is in their top five school resources."
Per Pinstrup-Andersen, Director-General, International Food
Policy Research Institute, Washington, D.C.:
"In view of the Institute's past contributions and future potentials,
we need a stronger rather than a weaker food research institute.
There is, to my knowledge, no other institute in the United States
that so effectively performs the combined roles of teaching and
research of the kind that has practical applicability and policy
relevance for those responsible for the decisions related to the
future food situation."
Sjarifudin Baharsjah, Minister of Agriculture, Republic of
Indonesia:
. .your [Prof. Scott Pearson's] periodic visits to Indonesia and the
consultations based on your and your colleagues' findings [have]
been very useful and contributed significantly to Indonesia's
capability to establish a healthy rice economy with far-reaching
consequences to economic development. . . ."
Ousmane Ouedraogo, former Minister of Finance and
Planning, Burkina Faso:
"I would like here to testify, from my recent experience as a
Minister of Finance and Planning of a semi-arid country who is
daily struggling for food security, Burkina Faso in West Africa, that
the FRI, with a high level of teaching as well as applied research
capabilities, is definitely the key element for keeping Stanford
University opened to the Developing World. . . ."
G. Edward Schuh, Dean and Professor, Hubert H. Humphrey
Institute of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota:
"I am chagrined to learn that there is a possibility the Food
Research Institute may be phased out. . . . This, in my view, would
be a big mistake, and a loss of substantial human capital and
institutional capacity to the nation as a whole. . . . The world
currently seems to be living in a state of euphoria about the world
food situation. There is little evidence to support such a positive
view. There is a lot of evidence that the reverse is true - that within
the near future we could be facing a serious world food problem.
When that crisis emerges, the Food Research Institute would be
one of the few institutions that could help address the problems
such a crisis could create."
Save the Food Research Institute!
It has contributed to Stanford's
excellence for nearly 75 years.
Please don't kill it now!
