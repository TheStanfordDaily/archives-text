# Jackson urges students to 'come alive'
## Reverend preaches on character and renewal 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Trying to warm up an already
well-heated crowd, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson began his speech at noon
yesterday by calling out, "I am
somebody!"
The crowd, which filled White
Plaza, echoed his call with the
strength of more than 2,000 voices
before Jackson began his formal
remarks on affirmative action and
national politics.
"Young America, you've got to
come alive," Jackson said, citing
youth movements in past decades.
"You can change the whole world."
While his call for change fell
upon one of the biggest gatherings
at Stanford in recent years, Jack
son said the way to measure suc
cess was not by the size of a crowd
at an event. "One relevant person
has the power. You cannot mea
sure relevance by numbers, but by
the connection to public policy,"
he said.
Jackson added that the stu
dents cheering in the crowd were
part of the problem if they were
not registered to vote. He asked all

unregistered students to "make
their way through the crowd" at
the end of his hour-long speech to
and fill out registration forms.
"If you are not a registered
voter today, you are not connected
to the public policy," Jackson said.
According to Bill Shen, co-chair
of the Stanford Democrats and a
main organizer of the rally, ap
proximately 1,200 people came
forward to register and more than
400 forms were turned in at the
event.
Lindy Eichenbaum, public rela
tions director for Stanford-in-
Government, said she thought the
speech was motivational and ener
gizing to the crowd of students.
"I'm pleased that we had such a
large turnout, which shows that
even though we are isolated in our
protective bubble at Stanford, we
still care about the people outside
of our little world," Eichenbaum
said.
