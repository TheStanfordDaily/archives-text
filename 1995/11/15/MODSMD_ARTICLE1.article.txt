# Jackson urges students to 'come alive'
## Reverend preaches on character and renewal 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Trying to warm up an already
well-heated crowd, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson began his speech at noon
yesterday by calling out, "I am
somebody!"
The crowd, which filled White
Plaza, echoed his call with the
strength of more than 2,000 voices
before Jackson began his formal
remarks on affirmative action and
national politics.
"Young America, you've got to
come alive," Jackson said, citing
youth movements in past decades.
"You can change the whole world."
While his call for change fell
upon one of the biggest gatherings
at Stanford in recent years, Jack
son said the way to measure suc
cess was not by the size of a crowd
at an event. "One relevant person
has the power. You cannot mea
sure relevance by numbers, but by
the connection to public policy,"
he said.
Jackson added that the stu
dents cheering in the crowd were
part of the problem if they were
not registered to vote. He asked all

unregistered students to "make
their way through the crowd" at
the end of his hour-long speech to
and fill out registration forms.
"If you are not a registered
voter today, you are not connected
to the public policy," Jackson said.
According to Bill Shen, co-chair
of the Stanford Democrats and a
main organizer of the rally, ap
proximately 1,200 people came
forward to register and more than
400 forms were turned in at the
event.
Lindy Eichenbaum, public rela
tions director for Stanford-in-
Government, said she thought the
speech was motivational and ener
gizing to the crowd of students.
"I'm pleased that we had such a
large turnout, which shows that
even though we are isolated in our
protective bubble at Stanford, we
still care about the people outside
of our little world," Eichenbaum
said.

ranged from amused to angry as

he expressed his dissatisfaction
with the political system.
"We must go another way," said
Jackson. "This is not about build
ing walls, but about outstretched
arms." He entreated the students
in the crowd to reach out: "Open
your eyes and gain something
beyond what you came here with."
"This struggle is about how to
lift people up, not how to pull them
in," Jackson said.
"Some say that the real problem
is that white mail's are angry. But I
don't know tl'n basis of their
anger," he said. Jackson estimated
that 35 percent of the work force is
white males, as tire 80 percent of
professors, 80 percent of the
Congress and all U.S. presidents.
"They couldn't be angry. What
about? Not knowing the pain of
being underprivileged?" he asked.
Jackson confirmed President
Clinton's statement that affirma
tive action has been good for Amer
ica, saying that the main beneficia
ries are white women, then blacks,
Latinos, Native Americans and the

physically handicapped.
"The majority has benefited
from affirmative action, not the
minority," Jackson said.
He gave example after example
of the positive effects of affirmative
action, saying before each explana
tion, "Let me try another way."
"It is like if a tire blows on your
car — you go and get a new one.
But then that one blows, and then
a third," said Jackson. "You have
to think, maybe it is not the tire,
but that things need realign
ment. . . . This is a structural
problem here."
Jackson explained that the dom
inant power structures — academ
ic, corporate, military and journal
istic — "have not yet seen the
light." He said that most leaders
see only walls blocking progress.
"If we want to see that Statue of
Liberty over the walls, we must
measure our character not by what
we have achieved, not by grade
point average, not by SAT scores or
what we inherit from our parents,"
Jackson said, "but measure it by
how we treat people, how we are
willing to do justice, to love and to
have mercy."
"I cannot be taught that whites
are an inferior race, that Jews are

inferior, that women are inferior,
because I know better. I know bet
ter, I know to do better, I know to
act better, I know to make the
world better," Jackson said.
Monisha Bajaj, a student
activist involved in the Asian
American Students Association
said Jackson provided a good bal
ance to Stanford's "intellectual
ized" discussion of affirmative
action. Afler recalling Speaker of
the House Newt Gingrich's state
ment that mothers should not be
home in the housing projects
watching soap operas while others
work, Jackson said this bigotry sig
nifies a character deficit in the
country's leadership.
"A character deficit is more
basic than a budget deficit," Jack
son said. "Racism represents a
character deficit."
To demonstrate a positive
example of character, Jackson
invoked the late Israeli Prime Min
ister Yitzhak Rabin.
"We are learning to live and lib
erate together in peace, and it is
because we made the choice. . ..
Rabin made a judgment more diffi
cult than declaring war — declar
ing peace," Jackson said. He added
that "the blood of martyrs is the

stuff change is made of."
"Rabin joins the martyrs who
sought to end wars, who chose
peace over war," he said.
Jackson also invoked Nelson
Mandela and the struggle in South
Africa, recalling that apartheid
ended not because of boycotts and
international pressure but because
the power structure in that coun
try saw a united South Africa as in
its best interest.
He stressed the fact that South
Africa is now a growing center for
tourism and investment.
At the reception before his
speech, Jackson criticized Gen.
Colin Powell for joining the Repub
lican party after announcing he
would not run for president.
"Everything that made him a gen
eral was a socially safe force — the
desegregation of schools, the deseg
regation of the military. Without
affirmative action, those forces are
under assault and he is joining
against the forces," he said.
According to press reports,
Jackson is currently considering a
presidential run of his own. When
asked by a crowd member after the
speech whether he would run, he
answered only that he would "pray
over it."

invoked the late Israeli Prime Min
ister Yitzhak Rabin.
"We are learning to live and lib
erate together in peace, and it is
because we made the choice. . ..
Rabin made a judgment more diffi
cult than declaring war — declar
ing peace," Jackson said. He added
that "the blood of martyrs is the

stuff change is made of."
"Rabin joins the martyrs who
sought to end wars, who chose
peace over war," he said.
Jackson also invoked Nelson
Mandela and the struggle in South
Africa, recalling that apartheid
ended not because of boycotts and
international pressure but because
the power structure in that coun
try saw a united South Africa as in
its best interest.
He stressed the fact that South
Africa is now a growing center for
tourism and investment.
At the reception before his
speech, Jackson criticized Gen.
Colin Powell for joining the Repub
lican party after announcing he
would not run for president.
"Everything that made him a gen
eral was a socially safe force — the
desegregation of schools, the deseg
regation of the military. Without
affirmative action, those forces are
under assault and he is joining
against the forces," he said.
According to press reports,
Jackson is currently considering a
presidential run of his own. When
asked by a crowd member after the
speech whether he would run, he
answered only that he would "pray
over it."
Trying to warm up an already
well-heated crowd, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson began his speech at noon
yesterday by calling out, "I am
somebody!"
The crowd, which filled White
Plaza, echoed his call with the
strength of more than 2,000 voices
before Jackson began his formal
remarks on affirmative action and
national politics.
"Young America, you've got to
come alive," Jackson said, citing
youth movements in past decades.
"You can change the whole world."
While his call for change fell
upon one of the biggest gatherings
at Stanford in recent years, Jack
son said the way to measure suc
cess was not by the size of a crowd
at an event. "One relevant person
has the power. You cannot mea
sure relevance by numbers, but by
the connection to public policy,"
he said.
Jackson added that the stu
dents cheering in the crowd were
part of the problem if they were
not registered to vote. He asked all

unregistered students to "make
their way through the crowd" at
the end of his hour-long speech to
and fill out registration forms.
"If you are not a registered
voter today, you are not connected
to the public policy," Jackson said.
According to Bill Shen, co-chair
of the Stanford Democrats and a
main organizer of the rally, ap
proximately 1,200 people came
forward to register and more than
400 forms were turned in at the
event.
Lindy Eichenbaum, public rela
tions director for Stanford-in-
Government, said she thought the
speech was motivational and ener
gizing to the crowd of students.
"I'm pleased that we had such a
large turnout, which shows that
even though we are isolated in our
protective bubble at Stanford, we
still care about the people outside
of our little world," Eichenbaum
said.
Affirming affirmative action
The tone of Jackson's speech
ranged from amused to angry as

Top: The Rev. Jesse Jackson calls students to the stage where he registered them to
vote. Above: In his speech, Jackson exhorted "young America" to mobilize and support
affirmative action.
he expressed his dissatisfaction
with the political system.
"We must go another way," said
Jackson. "This is not about build
ing walls, but about outstretched
arms." He entreated the students
in the crowd to reach out: "Open
your eyes and gain something
beyond what you came here with."
"This struggle is about how to
lift people up, not how to pull them
in," Jackson said.
"Some say that the real problem
is that white mail's are angry. But I
don't know tl'n basis of their
anger," he said. Jackson estimated
that 35 percent of the work force is
white males, as tire 80 percent of
professors, 80 percent of the
Congress and all U.S. presidents.
"They couldn't be angry. What
about? Not knowing the pain of
being underprivileged?" he asked.
Jackson confirmed President
Clinton's statement that affirma
tive action has been good for Amer
ica, saying that the main beneficia
ries are white women, then blacks,
Latinos, Native Americans and the

physically handicapped.
"The majority has benefited
from affirmative action, not the
minority," Jackson said.
He gave example after example
of the positive effects of affirmative
action, saying before each explana
tion, "Let me try another way."
"It is like if a tire blows on your
car — you go and get a new one.
But then that one blows, and then
a third," said Jackson. "You have
to think, maybe it is not the tire,
but that things need realign
ment. . . . This is a structural
problem here."
Jackson explained that the dom
inant power structures — academ
ic, corporate, military and journal
istic — "have not yet seen the
light." He said that most leaders
see only walls blocking progress.
"If we want to see that Statue of
Liberty over the walls, we must
measure our character not by what
we have achieved, not by grade
point average, not by SAT scores or
what we inherit from our parents,"
Jackson said, "but measure it by
how we treat people, how we are
willing to do justice, to love and to
have mercy."
"I cannot be taught that whites
are an inferior race, that Jews are

inferior, that women are inferior,
because I know better. I know bet
ter, I know to do better, I know to
act better, I know to make the
world better," Jackson said.
Monisha Bajaj, a student
activist involved in the Asian
American Students Association
said Jackson provided a good bal
ance to Stanford's "intellectual
ized" discussion of affirmative
action. Afler recalling Speaker of
the House Newt Gingrich's state
ment that mothers should not be
home in the housing projects
watching soap operas while others
work, Jackson said this bigotry sig
nifies a character deficit in the
country's leadership.
"A character deficit is more
basic than a budget deficit," Jack
son said. "Racism represents a
character deficit."
To demonstrate a positive
example of character, Jackson

ister Yitzhak Rabin.

erate together in peace, and it is
