## Access priorities 
### 
THE PROBLEM OF handi
cap access on the Stanford
campus to buildings such as
the Fire Truck House and Old
Union is not new. However, the
solution may take longer to imple
ment than some groups would
like.
Indue time, measures should
be undertaken to make these
buildings more accessible to dis
abled students. In the interim, the
University is right to continue its
approach to this problem in a cau
tious manner lest it find itself in a
quagmire of financial costs.
Once the University starts a
construction plan such as
installing elevators in a building
like Old Union, new problems
arise because of federal regula
tions and structural problems.
Engineers have to deal with dilem
mas such as the building's founda
tion and removing hazardous

materials such as asbestos. Addi
tionally, these buildings have to be
re-surveyed so that they can be
certified earthquake safe.
In a time of budgetary cutbacks,
the "solution" to this construction
dilemma about handicap inaccessi
bility is to set up a priority list of
buildings which are used by both
handicapped people and able-bod
ied people most frequently. As util
itarian as this may sound, it is the
correct path for the University to
follow at the current time.
However, this contingency poli
cy does not absolve Stanford
administrators from continuing
efforts to improve handicap access
to places such as the Fire Truck
House or sections of Old Union.
The University should try to reno
vate these buildings sometime,
preferably in the near future. By
law the University is obligated to
keep these promises.
