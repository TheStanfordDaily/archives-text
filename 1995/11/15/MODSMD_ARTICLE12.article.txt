# Marvelous maps
## 
### 
Many Stanford stu
dents sometimes feel that
their lives are adrift. For
tunately, it just got easier to give
yourself some direction.
Take north, for example. For
years, this direction languished,
somewhat mysteriously, in the bot
tom-right portion of Stanford
maps. Confused freshmen, trying
to reach Hoover Tower, often
found themselves at Roble. Those
seeking the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den might orienteer themselves up
(that is, down) to Bob.
It was, in short, a mess — but
no more. The Stanford Directory
has published a new, improved
map of the campus — a map on
which (gasp!) north is up.
Indeed, every year, the Directo
ry's maps seem to improve. This
year, in addition to the great Stan
ford map, the Directory provides a
very complete San Francisco map.
Once again, the maps are a high
light, if not the very best part, of
the Directory.

Take a closer look at the campus
map, for example. Based on a map
from Stanford Transportation
Programs, the campus map is
drawn to scale for the first time.
The chart also shows where roads
are blocked off. Parking garages
are very clearly marked.
Now examine the San Francisco
city map, made specially for the
Directory by Eureka Cartography
in Berkeley. The whole city is dis
played, as are the directions of San
Francisco's complex web of one
way streets. The index is also com
prehensive. Flip over the map and
you'll find a detail of downtown,
from the Mission District, through
North Beach, up to Fisherman's
Warf.
Finally, for those who never
quite get to the city, the Directory
has provided a detailed map of the
Peninsula from Sunnyvale to San
Carlos.
So bravo, Directory, for charting
this new course. Keep up the good
work in the future.
