## A
						recent acquisition 
### 
Last Friday afternoon, i
decided I would go down to Memo
rial Church and take a tour given
by the docents who do that sort of thing
on Friday afternoons. Little did I know
that my leader would be Timothy Leary,
clinical psychologist turned LSD
guru / CIA agent in the New Left move
ment of the late 19605.
It was about 2 p.m. on a beautiful day.
Outside the church, there were about six
or seven people, mostly older non-stu
dents, including a woman in a print
dress, who, because she was facing the
rest of the crowd, I assumed was the
docent. She told me I had just missed the
introductory portion of the tour, but that
I was lucky to get there before they went
inside. "There's a special format to our
tour today," she said. "Once we're in, the
church will be closed and no one will be
allowed to enter until it's over."
We walked into the entryway. The
docent told us to enter the church and sit
in the front row. The church was the
same as always, cavernous for its size, a
darkened haven from the (mostly) ungod
ly academic world of the Quad and
beyond. We waited a bit, but not long
enough to get uncomfortable or befriend
anyone else. A few menacing chords were
played on the organ.
Then, a few seconds later, a silver
haired man with a worn face appeared at
the pulpit and announced, "You're not
supposed to believe anvthinir I sav. I'm

Dr. Timothy Leary and I will be leading
you today. I'm being observed by Stan
ford higher-ups like President Gerhard
and some other trustees to see if I'm
valuable — to see if I am a relic, to see if
I should be acquired like Allen Ginsberg's
notes; a living memorial to a different
time, a different attitude.
"But they're not sure if they want me,
so I'm being tested to see if I can fill the
first endowed docentship. That's fine
with me. A docent is not only a tour
guide, but a leader, a lecturer as well. And
you're my first group. But this place is
getting tired. Let's go tour the Rodin
Sculpture Garden."
We walked through the Quad and the
Oval. He explained that he wasn't sup
posed to give his first Rodin tour until
Saturday, but the church was oppressing
him and he wanted to see "Rodin's gar
gantuan gravestones to humanity." I
wondered if Stanford really wanted to
collect him like an action figure. I won
dered if he was sober.
"These 'Gates of Hell' are remarkable.
So detailed, so meaningful, it can be alle
gorized to represent anything," he said.
"But in truth, it was inspired by a fanta
sy that had a powerful grip on Rodin —
that Europe was controlled by a secret
network of gendarmes. It's all about the
hell that those cops made for Rodin and
his artistic society. It's all about cops,
man. Can you imagine that anyone would
want to be a cop and control someone

else's lifestyle?"
Well, I could.
"Cops are part of a primitive, back
ward order. If people could just be
allowed to tune into themselves, they
wouldn't do any deeds that needed polic
ing. Everyone can be their own cop," he
proclaimed.
By this time, Leary had totally worked
himself up. He turned his back on us to
wheeze and wipe his sweaty red face with
a kerchief that looked like a miniature
Confederate flag.
He turned around and said, "I've got to
end this tour. I was going to slip you some
hallucinogens and brainwash you as we
went on a universal trip, but I'm getting
some intense flashbacks and gotta split.
But don't forget to be your own boss, your
own cop and don't be copped out or
around by society. I know how bad they
can be. I was one," he wheezed.
With that, he slapped all of us on our
shoulders with his left hand. He said he
was going to go look for "another troll." I
didn't understand this — it must have
had something to do with his flashbacks.
It wasn't until I was alone, around
3:30 p.m., that I started to feel the drug
he somehow secretly slipped to me.
