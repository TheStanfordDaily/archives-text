The U.S. prison system has benefits as well

lAM WHITING in response to the arti
cle which appeared in the Nov. 7 issue
of The Daily about law school stu
dents campaigning for prisoners' rights.
While I agree that there are certain
aspects of our prison system which are in
need of reform, I am afraid that Stanford
students Lauren Leslie and Tara Mulay
fail to realize the diversity of "heinous
crimes" for which prisoners in the U.S.
are serving time.
It was mentioned in the article that,
through the Pelican Bay Information
Project organization, Stanford law stu
dents became aware of a disproportionate
number of inmates at Pelican Bay prison
who were "forced to spend 23 hours / day
alone in windowless cells." About one
year ago, there were a series of art icles in
my hometown Ohio newspaper concern
ing similar "atrocities" at an Ohio prison.
Apparently, prisoners who misbehaved
were only allowed to eat "meal loaf' dur
ing mealtime. Prison cooks prepare "meal
loaf" bv mixing all the different foods

offered during dinner in a blender and
baking this concoction into a casserole. It
still retains the same nutritional value of
the separate foods other inmates receive;
it's just difficult to eat.
It is true that some of these restric
tions / punishments placed on some pris
oners serve absolutely no function in the
process of reform. Obviously, one could
argue that they serve no purpose in the
reform of a prisoner convicted of, say,
narcotics sales. But, there are a large
number of prison inmates who could ben
efit from being exposed to the conditions
mentioned above.
For instance, I recently had charges
brought against a man who severely
physically and sexually abused me for
years while I was an adolescent. This
man lived in my family's home for years
and subjected me to physical and mental
torture. I was forced to engage in sexual
acts with this person at the age of 12.1
was forced to go days without eating
because I had "misbehaved." As a result

of this abuse, I was spending up to 23
hours / day alone in my dark bedroom
thinking about what I might have done to
cause all of this. I was, in effect, an
unwilling prisoner in my own home.
Now that this man is serving his
prison sentence, he frequently calls my
mother — collect of course — to complain
about the very conditions which so
appalled Stanford law students in last
Tuesday's article. He frequently com
plains on behalf of other inmates who
committed the same crimes as he and
were, as prisoners, being subjected to the
same conditions.
After about two years of this treat
ment, this man is finally gaining some
sort of understanding about what he did
to me. You see, he finally realizes what it
feels like to be utterly out of control of
your life and a victim. For the first time
in about 40 years, he is told what to do,
when to do it and how to do it. I am not
stating that, in general, it is good that
prison guards are willing and able to sub

ject inmates, like my abuser, to those con
ditions which seemed so atrocious to the
members of Stanford Students For Pris
oners' Rights. I am simply stating that in
many cases, these conditions inadvertent
ly serve a beneficial purpose. As my abus
er stated a few months ago, "If I had not
gone to prison and been subjected to
these conditions, I would never have
come close to understanding what I did to
my victim; what it felt like."
Of course, not all prisoners are able to
reach this understanding, even when
forced to undergo the same types of abuse
they imposed on their victims / survivors.
Furthermore, inmates such as my abuser
are not entirely reformed by the prison
system alone. But, I believe people need
to be aware that there actually are benefi
cial aspects to our prison system, depend
ing on the type of crime committed. And,
if after reading this, you believe my story
is an exception to the rule, WAKE UP!
