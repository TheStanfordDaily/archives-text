# Foreign students are indeed eligible for financial aid
## 
### 
It is always astonishing to me, even
after many years at Stanford, that
bright students can get even the most
elementary facts wrong. I refer specifi
cally to the letter in Monday's Daily
(Nov. 13) by Krishna Mahesh claiming

that Stanford does not offer financial aid
to international students.
This is absolutely incorrect, as I am
sure some of the more than 100
international undergraduates students
receiving financial aid from Stanford
will he quick to verify. In fact, Stanford
is one of the most generous universities
in the country in providing financial aid
to undergraduates from other coun
tries.
More remarkably, Mr. Mahesh cannot
even remember his own application from
last year when he was specifically asked

if ho wanted to apply for financial aid as
an international student. It was right
there in black and white, as it has been
for many years. In the 10 years that I
have been the principal officer in the
Office of Admissions responsible for
international students, we have always
stressed that we are not need-blind for
international students, both in all our
publications and in every personal con
tact.
If Mr. Mahesh is unaware of this, I
can only suggest that he did not read
what he signed last year very carefully.

As far as I know, Harvard is the only
American university that is totally need
blind, including international students.
Stanford does extremely well, consider
ing the many demands made on the
always finite resources available here.
Misinformation of this sort is always
damaging because more people read the
inaccurate accusation than the response
I urge those who write to The Daily to
make sure they have all the facts before
they engage in righteous criticism.
