# Michael Green
## Mike and Ralph — Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? 
### 
Lately I've been worried about
Ralph. No, not Macchio. Not Lau
ren or Malph or Waldo Emerson.
Rut Ralph my other.
My anti-person.
My no-ppleganger.
You see, I believe in the existence of a
certain character — an other. I believe
there exists for myself (if not for every
one) an individual, singled out, to whom I
am bound in a bond of oppositeness. That
for everything he is, I am the opposite;
that for everything that happens to me,
he must handle the inverse.
In the worst Jungian way, we share a
clutch gas existence of antithetical expe
rience. We take in life in mirror images,
similar in timing, but backwards in
occurrence.
And I believe his name to be Ralph.
It's the only thing I really know about
him — other than what I can deduce by
looking in a mirror. For as my opposite,
dear Ralph must be in possession of a cer
tain few traits.
By definition, he must be tall, unre
flective and conflict-avoidant. Great hair,
a good upper body and a lumpy butt.
Mature, outdoorsy. Graduated in four
years. Politically active. Econ major.
Loves raisins. Thinks sports and skate

boards are cool. Definitely Catholic.
Ralph: When he is happy, I'm sad.
When I'm getting dissed, he's gettin'
dates. And, when I'm downloading nudie
pics to sublimate my sex drive, he's off
doin' carnal cartwheels with the women's
crew team.
The anti-Michael whom Divine Irony
neglects . that's my Ralph.
You can imagine, of course, why I'd
bother believing all this. After all, it's
compelling to think that someone is
always there, sharing your world, yin
ningyour yang.
Imagine that. Imagine that for every
time you felt one thing, a divinely desig
nated other always felt the opposite. An
anima to your animus; a Pine to your
Elm. You're all sophist, she's dogmatic.
You shave, she waxes. You're iUvas No!,
she's iSi!
I've believed in my own personal Ralph
for years, ever since high school. Sure, 1
may have simply created him when —
trapped in Jewish parochial hell — 1
sought meaning in my melancholia, hop
ingthat, perhaps, I wallowed in cliche ado
lescent anomic squalor for a reason: that
somewhere, someone else might frolic.
Be that as it may, I began to believe
that, indeed, someone existed who

though vacuous and undeserving — was
feeling the opposite of what I was feel
ing.. someone who got to be laughin'
while I was whining.
(Yes, I am fully aware how melodra
matic I'm being here, but this is high
school we're talking about. Everyone gets
bitter when they talk about high school
me especially. I had to wear a
yarmulke all day and I always got in
trouble for having my hair too long and
they made me cut it. And now, when I'm
finally old enough to grow my hair as
long as I damn well please, it's falling out.
So don't you tell me not to be bitter.)
And still — even with the possibility
that Ralph is nothing but a projection
born of my pre-balding pubescent angst,
the possibility that I constructed the fan
tasy of him out of wish fulfillment, Cure
lyrics and duct tape — I believe he is real.
Like 1 still believe in Santa Claus, I
still believe Ralph's out there, some
where — fixin' cars eatin* pork carin'
about football . . . and sobbin' his little
brown eyes out.
You see, this is why I've been thinking
about Ralph so much lately: I'm a little
worried for him.
It's a little disturbing, but things are
going pretty well with me these days. You

probably can't tell but right now, while
I'm sitting here typing, I'm fairly con
tented with how things are.
Honest. My car's fixed, I'm not, I
haven't gotten a ticket for parking in the
RF spot in weeks and the old refractory
period is averaging at just under eight
minutes.
Life's been, umm, well good.
Not that I'm whistling show tunes and
dotting my 'j's with little evil happy
hearts. But lately, I just can't complain as
much as I used to. Or as much as I'd like
to.
I'm downright gruntled.
Now here's the problem: In the past,
I'd only thought on dear Ralph in nega
tive terms — as the dingus responsible
for my discomfiture, as the one who was
happy while I was in high school.
It's true. For so long I've known noth
ing but resentment for what I figured
must've been the greediest other a 16-
year-old could ever be paired with. And I
comforted myself by being bitter about
how happy the son of a bitch must be.
Only now things aren't all that bad.
And I'm concerned he, in turn, might
be depressed. Or lonely.
And the poor once-perky pooper, well,
he just doesn't know from these kind of

things. I can't help but to be worried
about him — all he's got to keep him
going is that really cool hair of his and,
from the look of things, some outstand
ing prospects for employment.
I should find Ralph and warn him.
I'd see him in a crowd and tap him on
his six-foot high shoulder. "Hey, dork,"
I'd say.
"Yeah, dude," he'd reply. He talks like
that.
"I think you should know, things
might suck for you for a while," I'd say.
"Sure, dude," he'd reply.
"You're probably not gonna be getting
any for a while either," I'd remind him.
"Oh, that's okay," he'd reply. "I don't
think about sex all that often anyway. And
besides, with my new outstandingly high
paying job, I don't have nearly the kind of
time to go have sex all day anymore. I used
to hook up an awful lot, you know."
"It's funny, I was thinking of feeling
guilty about all that's about to happen to
you. But now . .
"What?"
"I hope you choke on your own sperm
count."
"Thanks, dude."
"No problem, Ralph."

be depressed. Or lonely.
And the poor once-perky pooper, well,
he just doesn't know from these kind of

things. I can't help but to be worried
about him — all he's got to keep him
going is that really cool hair of his and,
from the look of things, some outstand
ing prospects for employment.
I should find Ralph and warn him.
I'd see him in a crowd and tap him on
his six-foot high shoulder. "Hey, dork,"
I'd say.
"Yeah, dude," he'd reply. He talks like
that.
"I think you should know, things
might suck for you for a while," I'd say.
"Sure, dude," he'd reply.
"You're probably not gonna be getting
any for a while either," I'd remind him.
"Oh, that's okay," he'd reply. "I don't
think about sex all that often anyway. And
besides, with my new outstandingly high
paying job, I don't have nearly the kind of
time to go have sex all day anymore. I used
to hook up an awful lot, you know."
"It's funny, I was thinking of feeling
guilty about all that's about to happen to
you. But now . .
"What?"
"I hope you choke on your own sperm
count."
"Thanks, dude."
"No problem, Ralph."

Lately I've been worried about
Ralph. No, not Macchio. Not Lau
ren or Malph or Waldo Emerson.
Rut Ralph my other.
My anti-person.
My no-ppleganger.
You see, I believe in the existence of a
certain character — an other. I believe
there exists for myself (if not for every
one) an individual, singled out, to whom I
am bound in a bond of oppositeness. That
for everything he is, I am the opposite;
that for everything that happens to me,
he must handle the inverse.
In the worst Jungian way, we share a
clutch gas existence of antithetical expe
rience. We take in life in mirror images,
similar in timing, but backwards in
occurrence.
And I believe his name to be Ralph.
It's the only thing I really know about
him — other than what I can deduce by
looking in a mirror. For as my opposite,
dear Ralph must be in possession of a cer
tain few traits.
By definition, he must be tall, unre
flective and conflict-avoidant. Great hair,
a good upper body and a lumpy butt.
Mature, outdoorsy. Graduated in four
years. Politically active. Econ major.
Loves raisins. Thinks sports and skate

boards are cool. Definitely Catholic.
Ralph: When he is happy, I'm sad.
When I'm getting dissed, he's gettin'
dates. And, when I'm downloading nudie
pics to sublimate my sex drive, he's off
doin' carnal cartwheels with the women's
crew team.
The anti-Michael whom Divine Irony
neglects . that's my Ralph.
You can imagine, of course, why I'd
bother believing all this. After all, it's
compelling to think that someone is
always there, sharing your world, yin
ningyour yang.
Imagine that. Imagine that for every
time you felt one thing, a divinely desig
nated other always felt the opposite. An
anima to your animus; a Pine to your
Elm. You're all sophist, she's dogmatic.
You shave, she waxes. You're iUvas No!,
she's iSi!
I've believed in my own personal Ralph
for years, ever since high school. Sure, 1
may have simply created him when —
trapped in Jewish parochial hell — 1
sought meaning in my melancholia, hop
ingthat, perhaps, I wallowed in cliche ado
lescent anomic squalor for a reason: that
somewhere, someone else might frolic.
Be that as it may, I began to believe
that, indeed, someone existed who

though vacuous and undeserving — was
feeling the opposite of what I was feel
ing.. someone who got to be laughin'
while I was whining.
(Yes, I am fully aware how melodra
matic I'm being here, but this is high
school we're talking about. Everyone gets
bitter when they talk about high school
me especially. I had to wear a
yarmulke all day and I always got in
trouble for having my hair too long and
they made me cut it. And now, when I'm
finally old enough to grow my hair as
long as I damn well please, it's falling out.
So don't you tell me not to be bitter.)
And still — even with the possibility
that Ralph is nothing but a projection
born of my pre-balding pubescent angst,
the possibility that I constructed the fan
tasy of him out of wish fulfillment, Cure
lyrics and duct tape — I believe he is real.
Like 1 still believe in Santa Claus, I
still believe Ralph's out there, some
where — fixin' cars eatin* pork carin'
about football . . . and sobbin' his little
brown eyes out.
You see, this is why I've been thinking
about Ralph so much lately: I'm a little
worried for him.
It's a little disturbing, but things are
going pretty well with me these days. You

probably can't tell but right now, while
I'm sitting here typing, I'm fairly con
tented with how things are.
Honest. My car's fixed, I'm not, I
haven't gotten a ticket for parking in the
RF spot in weeks and the old refractory
period is averaging at just under eight
minutes.
Life's been, umm, well good.
Not that I'm whistling show tunes and
dotting my 'j's with little evil happy
hearts. But lately, I just can't complain as
much as I used to. Or as much as I'd like
to.
I'm downright gruntled.
Now here's the problem: In the past,
I'd only thought on dear Ralph in nega
tive terms — as the dingus responsible
for my discomfiture, as the one who was
happy while I was in high school.
It's true. For so long I've known noth
ing but resentment for what I figured
must've been the greediest other a 16-
year-old could ever be paired with. And I
comforted myself by being bitter about
how happy the son of a bitch must be.
