# Protesters heed rally's message of activism
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Students rallying at the I loover Insti
tution in favor of what they termed
equality of opportunity succeeded yester
day in enraging some of the think tank's
most senior scholars.
Bolstered hy the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
speech promoting affirmative action and
calling for greater steps toward equality,
roughly 75 people marched to Hoover
Tower to protest the recent decision of
the UC Board of Regents to abolish pref
erential admissions and hiring pro
grams. Hoover Director Emeritus W.
Glenn Campbell is a regent.
Shanta Diver, a member of a group
called The Berkeley Coalition to Defend
Affirmative Action By Any Means Nec
essary and the woman who interrupted
Jackson's speech with a call for him to
join a rally at this week's regents meet
ing, said she thinks protests can influ
ence the regents' — and specifically
Campbell's — decisions.
"I do, I do," she said. "And I think
that it's important for the regents to un
derstand that we will confront them
everywhere that they appear."
The protesters planned to present
Campbell, whose home was picketed for
similar reasons two weeks ago, with a
declaration expressing the students' ob
jections to the regents' decision.
"We are here to show that there are
many people who are concerned about
this issue and opposed to the destruction
of affirmative action," said sophomore
Misha Olivas, reading the declaration to
the protesters from the steps of Hoover
Tower. "By voting against affirmative
action, the UC Regents have voted
against the future of this country.
"We will not sit by and allow the re
gents to decide the fate of this country

when the decision that has been made is
so obviously regressive and racist," she
continued. "We will not stop fighting
until this decision is overturned and a
renewed commitment is made to the
youth and to the future of this country."
The group then moved to a location in
the center of the Hoover complex while
chanting "Affirmative action now" and
"Hey hey, ho ho, Glenn Campbell has
got to go."
Protesters were confronted there by
Dr. Thomas Metzger, a senior fellow at
the institution.

"You're not civilized. You're disturb
ing University surroundings here," Met
zger told the protesters, who responded
with chants of "Hell no, we won't go."
"This is not free speech, this is bark
ing dogs," he said. "I also disagree with
their point of view, but that's a different
matter."
"I'm not sure of the legality," Met
zger added when asked whether the stu
dents had a constitutional right to
protest, "but certainly coming here to

disturb people who are working
here doing research is outra
geous."
"It's barbarous, it's stupid, it's
beneath the dignity of the Uni
versity," he said.
In response, a student said, "I
don't see how the students can be
below the dignity of the Universi
ty."
"He's so ignorant," said sopho
more Monisha Bajaj, a student
leader for pro-affirmative action
causes.
"I think that's the kind of
ignorance we have to face in the
Hoover Institution and on this
campus," she said.
If students want to get in
touch with Campbell, who Bajaj
called "one of the most racist and

sexist UC regents," Metzger said
that "they can send him a letter
in the mail."
Campbell — whose presence
around the corner of the building
went unnoticed by the students
— did not speak to the protesters,
but seemed unswayed by their
pleas.
"I certainly won't (react to stu
dents' demands)," he said. "All it
makes me is more determined to
change affirmative action."
He added that "we're not abol
ishing affirmative action, we've
just changed it," but he refused to
explain how the changes differed
from abolishment.
Junior Kris Hayashi, a mem
ber of the Affirmative Action
Coalition and a leader of the rally,
said that a delegation had
attempted to deliver the declara
tion to Campbell but that "they
weren't able to get in"and did not
receive any response.
