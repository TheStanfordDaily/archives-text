# Students won't eat to spare Food Research
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Students at the Food Research Institute
announced yesterday that they will hold a
24-hour fast beginning tomorrow afternoon
to protest the department's proposed clo
sure.
The fast, to be held in White Plaza begin
ning at 2 p.m., will kick off a series of
protests by the institute's students, who
claim there is no justification for John
Shoven, dean of the school of humanities and
sciences, to close the institute.
Students in both the institute's doctoral
and masters programs plan to camp out
overnight and hold a rally in White Plaza at
noon Friday.
Shoven has recommended the shut down of
the internationally renowned doctoral pro
gram, the transfer of senior faculty to other
departments and the integration of the mas
ters students into the International Policy
Studies program. In addition, plans also call

for the junior faculty to be laid off in three
years.
"Most of the institute will be fasting for
24 hours in show of solidarity," said doctoral
candidate Albert Park, who studies rural
poverty in China. "Some of the faculty will
be participating."
The last curriculum-related fast occurred
in May 1994 when a three-day hunger strike
by a group of Chicano / Latino students
resulted in a committee that eventually pro
posed a new Comparative Studies in Itace
and Ethnicity program.
"Students are coalescing around FRI just
as they coalesced around that group," Park
said. "We're hopeful the result will be the
same."
All this week, students clad in white T
shirts with the slogan "If it ain't broke, don't
kill it" have solicited signatures to be pre
sented to the Advisory Board of the Academ
ic Council before its 3 p.m. meeting Friday in
Building 10.
Students have also organized a postcard

drive exhorting University President Ger
hard Casper to retain the department. In
addition, the institute raised contributions
to buy a full-page Daily advertisement,
which contains letters of support from nine
economists including the Indonesian Minis
ter of Agriculture. They have also bought a
sky advertisement for Big Game.
Twenty-seven student organizations have
pledged their support to the institute.
"We really hope that President Casper
and Provost [Condoleezza Ricel will engage
and think hard about what this means to
Stanford," Park said.
Shoven, however, was not optimistic
about the ramifications the fast might have
on Casper's decision. "This is a dramatic way
to express student concern," he said. "That
will be duly noted. We have already noted
student concerns in this regard, so in that
sense I don't think it will change anything."
Institute officials met with Rice yesterday
but failed to have the matter removed from
the Advisory Board's agenda.
