# Former publications director McCann dies

### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Former Stanford University
Publications Service Director
Robert E. McCann died last week
of stomach cancer at age 69.
Known as a loyal Stanford
employee, McCann acted as direc
tor of Publications Service from
1980-82, retiring in 1991 after 32
years of service. He passed away
last Wednesday.
McCann began his career at
Stanford as a journalism student,
earning his degree in 1949. Ten
years later, he joined the Univer
sity News and Publications Ser
vice. Along with serving time as
director, McCann edited "Staff

News" for the service from
TS.
Karen Bartholomew, a friend
and co-worker of McCann,
recalled him as talented in his
roles as both employee and man
ager.
"When he was the publications
director, he wasn't just a boss,"
she said. "He was like a teacher to
young staff members, and that
was a quality I really liked in
him."
"I appreciated Bob's devotion
to producing the very best publi
cations at Stanford, no matter
how much time and effort it
took," she said.
During the mid-1980s, she and
McCann held a contest to identify

12 architectural features on aim
pus. Photos of the features —
such as part of the roof on the
Round Room of Memorial Church
and a piece of the railing in front
of Encina Hall — were printed on
the cover of what was then a fac
ulty and staff directory. Contes
tants who identified the photos
correctly won.
"I had a great time working
with him on this and many other
projects over the years,"
Bartholomew said.
Former Stanford News Service
Director Bob Beyers said
McCann's publications "affected
literally everyone at Stanford.
"Long before computers, he
created, organized and updated

official campus maps," Beyers
said in an obituary. "He produced
hundreds of catalogs, including
decades of the basic 'Courses and
Degrees.' He worked straight
through holidays and weekends
to make sure the official Time
Schedule was both accurate and
available at the start of fall class
es."
McCann is survived by his
wife, Margot, four children and
four grandchildren.
