## Tremble no longer: earthquake detection a possibility 
### Malcolm Maclachlan Contributing writer 
Imagine if scientists could
predict earthquakes. When.
Where. How strong. People
could evacuate days ahead of
time. The constant itch of fear
would be gone, along with all
those jokes about California
falling into the ocean.
No, they can't do it yet. But
according to one Stanford scien
tist, they may have a method
that will eventually show them
how.
Anthony Fraser-Smith, a
member of both the Physics and
Electrical Engineering Depart
ments, was able to detect strong
low-frequency electromagnetic
signals coming from the earth in
the three months preceding last
December's magnitude five
earthquake in Parkfield. This is
the same phenomena he noted
before the Loma Prieta Earth
quake in 1989 — and may be the
key to an early warning system.
Fraser-Smith came upon his
discovery almost by accident. In
1989, he was in Carrolitos work
ing on an unrelated experiment
to measure electro-magnetic
fields. He was trying to come up
with a baseline measurement of
electro-magnetic "noise," a
means of filtering out the con
stant radiation which comes
from space and, he suspected,
from within the earth. A string
of scientific necessities led Fras
er-Smith to move his instru
ments from campus to the
remote site in the Santa Cruz
Mountains.
"BART [Bay Area Rapid
Transit] is a very strong source
of noise in the frequency I was
measuring," he says. "Ultimate
ly, I moved because all I was
doing was measuring BART. It
turned out to be an unusual
opportunity, because most peo
ple aren't operating equipment
like mine so near an earth
quake."
Soon after he set up his equip
ment, Fraser-Smith began to
record some unusually strong
readings. "We sat back and
thought maybe it would go away,
or if not, we would have to move
to yet another location."

In the twelve days before the
Loma Prieta earthquake, his
readings often read 30 times the
normal level of activity. The
readings eventually went down
to 10 times normal, then sud
denly hit 300 times normal in
the hours before the powerful
quake — before any foreshocks
were felt.
"The signals were probably
even bigger," Fraser-Smith says,
"but our instruments were satu
rated."
When the quake hit, Fraser-
Smith was on the phone with
Arman Bernotti, a former stu
dent who had set up the equip
ment at Corralitos who was then
working for a company in Berke
ley. From his Stanford office,
Fraser-Smith was able to warn
Bernotti several seconds before
the quake hit Berkeley.
Fraser-Smith says this is
when he made the connection.
Earthquake waves travel very
slowly compared to electro
magnetic signals — thus they
could talk on the phone in real
time even though only one of
them had been hit by the earth
quake. If faults were giving off
electromagnetic waves, they
would be measurable long
before an earthquake actually
hit. The experience influenced
Fraser-Smith to change the
focus of his research.
He soon realized that he had
just corroborated research that
Greek scientists had been work
ing on for a decade. The team
led by Panayiotis Varotsos of
the University of Athens had
been trying to measure the
same kind of signals in order to
predict earthquakes, but had
received little recognition for
their work.
This changed with Eraser-
Smith's discovery — and when
Varotsos's predictions, faxed to
other scientists, started coming
true. Since 1984, Varotsos has
successfully predicted six of the
eight largest earthquakes in
Greece.
"Nobody believed him,"
Fraser-Smith says of Varotsos.
"But (in his prediction) his loca
tions weren't far out, his timing
wasn't bad, and his magnitudes
weren't bad. My attitude in that

faults are moving," says Tim
Lui, an electrical engineering
Ph.D. student who is working
on Fraser-Smith's earthquake
project. "Faults are probably
lubricated by water or other flu
ids.
Over the years, Varotsos has
made his equipment more
sophisticated. However, both
the Greek and American scien
tists still make their measure
ments with comparatively sim
ple equipment — pairs of sensi
tive metal coils placed in the
ground. The emphasis now, Lui
says, is not on improving equip
ment but finding the right
places to put it.
The Greek researchers have
found that spots 100 miles from
an earthquake gave stronger sig
nals than spots only 10 miles
away. This has given rise to the
idea of "sensitive spots," areas
that conduct the signals better
due to the composition of the
crust beneath them. Developing
an early warning system would
involve doing composition map
ping of large regions, in order to
find numerous sensitive sites.
This promises to be a very time
consuming process, Lui says.
"The Greeks have a lot of
magnitude five earthquakes, so
they can really hunt around for
them. In California, we don't
have as many. Where it could
take them a few mont hs to find a
sensitive spot, it could take us
years. That doesn't work for
funding."
This will not stop Fraser-
Smith and his colleagues from
trying. They are now concentrat
ing again on Parkfield, in Cali
fornia's Central Valley. The area
is unusual because it has had a
very consistent history of seis
mic activity — a magnitude six
to seven quake every 22 years,
with one exception, in the last
century and a half. It is now
overdue, so they are looking to
this area to help them refine
their methods. They also have
equipment set up at eight other
sites near faults around the
state.
"It's sort of like fishing,"
Fraser-Smith says. "I've got a
lot of poles in the water right
now."

Nine measuring sites are located throughout California along the San Andreas fault, where they can
measure low-frequency electromagnetic waves prior to an earthquake.
