# McConnell leading the flock

Walking at the head of a flock of sheep in the cen
tral valley of California, Dr. Susan McConnell, assis
tant professor of biological sciences, witnesses the
amazing inner workings of the nervous system.

Instances like these serve to further inspirt
McConnell to penetrate the mysteries of the brain.

It was McConncll's interest in animal behavior
that originally led her into developmental neurobiol
ogy. Having studied primate behavior as an under
graduate, she began to question the underlying basis
of behavior that dictates how an animal will behave.
"Instead of thinking about animals in their environ
ment, I started to become more and more interested
in how neurons behave in their environment — the
brain."
McConnell has been at Stanford for the last six
years where she has, in addition to teaching, spent
her time fitting the pieces together of what may
someday be the full story of nervous system devel
opment.
Early on in their development, young nerve cells,
called neurons, are "born" and begin a longjourney
to their correct and final position in the brain.
There, they become responsible for a specific aspect
of behavior. "We're trying to understand," she
explained, "at what point in its developmental histo
ry does a neuron actually make a decision about
what type of cell to become."
Using techniques such as time-lapse imaging,

McConnell is actually able to visualize the creation
and development of the neuron, bringing to light an
incredible world of cells communicating with each
other, spurred on by their genetic makeup. Molecu
lar biology techniques reveal such communication,
showing which genes are playing an integral role in
development.
In the future, research in neurodevelopment will
be pertinent to understanding a vast array of dis
eases, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's
disease, dyslexia and other learning disabilities. Pre
sent technology allows McConnell and researchers
across the country to uncover mechanisms and pro
cesses, such as neuronal development, that will
define possible treatment for many human diseases.
According to McConnell, we are at a "stage in sci
ence" where the excitement and potential is at an
all-time high. At the same time, the "level of frus
tration" among scientists is increasing due to dimin
ishing federal funds. Recent years have proved to be
an "uphill battle for funding in science," McConnell
said. And with the federal government tightening its
budget, money with which to conduct research has
been sparse.
Money for basic research — like McConnell's —
which traditionally relied upon government grants
has been particularly hard hit. Scientists are spend
ing more and more time frantically writing grants,
vying to be among the few that will actually be fund
ed. "Fortunately," she acknowledged, "there is a
core group in Congress who understand that money
spent on research is an investment on human
health."
On the brighter side, the Department of Biologi
cal Sciences has been "amazingly supportive." As a
woman in science, McConnell feels extremely fortu
nate to be at a university where men and women, in
her department, "are equally nourished and
helped."
Surrounded by a family of postdoctoral fellows,
graduate students, and undergraduates, McConnell
heads the flock to fit another piece of the neurobiol
ogy puzzle into place.

Time-lapse imaging allows McConnell to actually
track specific neurons and their fates. Here, the
