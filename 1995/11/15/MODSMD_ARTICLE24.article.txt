Q fs it possible to pull an Oreo cookie apart so
that fxrth cookies come out clean and the fill
• ing cimps off in the middle ?
A In all my time as an Oreo cookie consumer
• and separator, I have yet to come across The
• One that has split cleanly into cookie, filler
and then cookie again. Perhaps someday, sometime,
due to serendipitous conditions and the chance align
ment of the stars, planets and Sonny Bono, there will
come along The One which will magically separate
into three pieces and bring all the children of the
world together to hold hands and sing in unison.
Unfortunately, the laws of physics are against you
on this one, and anyway the children were planning
on singing John Denver's greatest hits.
To see why it is impossible to split an Oreo cookie
in three, try this simple experiment. All you need is
a piece of paper and both your hands. First, make
sure that the paper you will be using is not impor
tant. This means using your roommate's physics
problem set is not a good idea. For similar reasons,
using the original manuscript of the Constitution of
the United States is also a no-no.
Next, tear or cut two parallel slits in the piece of
paper, spanning about three-quarters of its length.
You should now have a piece of paper which is almost
split into three. If you look very hard and use your
imagination a bit, you can see how this is like an
Oreo cookie. The two sections on the sides are like
the black cookie part, and the middle section
between the two slits is like the white filling.
When you start to pull this "cookie" apart, both
slits might tear slightly at first. Eventually, though,
one of the slits will rip a little bit more and get a lead
on the other one. When this happens, the more torn
slit becomes more prone to tearing and eventually
completely severs the paper in two, not three.
Theoretically, if everything were perfectly sym
metric, it would be possible to break the paper in
three. Like wise, a perfect cookie might also be able
to split into three parts. Unfortunately, this is highly
unlikely, and to date, the perfect Oreo cookie has yet
to be discovered.
That's not the end of the cookie saga, though.
Yesterday, I applied for a $55,010 grant to do
research on Oreo cookie splitting. After getting
myself a I .exus to drive myself to the supermarket to
buy the cookies, I rounded up a few researchers to
conduct extensive testing with me.
The tests were conducted with Reduced Fat Oreo
cookies, Double StufT Oreo cookies and also cheap,
imitation non-Oreo cookies. Three of the researchers
were right-handed and one was left-handed. We also
tried twisting the cookies clockwise and counter
clockwise to see if that had any effect on which side
the filling came out on.
In all the tests we conducted with the Reduced

Fat Oreo cookies, the distribution of filler seemed to
be pretty much random. In fact, more often than not,
the white filler itself split into two parts and stuck to
both cookies. We believe that this behavior is a result
of the weird chemicals present in low fat foods. We're
still not sure whether we should be worried about
this or not.
With the Double Stuff Oreos, there was a definite
trend in the distribution of filler. With right-handed
experimenters opening the cookie using a clockwise
turn, the filling came out significantly more often on
the left cookie.
Similarly, a left hander using a counterclockwise
turn more often came out with the filling on the right
cookie. When the direction of opening was reversed,
however, these effects disappeared and the filling
came out randomly

We found similar results for our generic brand
Oreo cookies, except that the filling in these were
more prone to splitting in half, leaving two semicir
cles on each cookie. In the Double Stuff cookies, the
filling would almost always stick exclusively to one
cookie.
So, how can we explain this strange phenomenon?
We believe that when the filling came out more often
on one side than the other, it resulted from some
kind of asymmetric opening process. We also believe
that this asymmetry is more pronounced when you
open the cookie with your hand's natural turn — for
example, clockwise for right handers. Turning the
cookie against the hand's natural direction counter
acts our intrinsic tendency towards asymmetrical
opening, and so the filling comes out randomly.
So where do we go from here? I don't know, but
tomorrow we're applying for a grant to do research
on cheez-balls.
