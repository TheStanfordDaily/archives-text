## Bowl hopes alive and well for Cardinal football Sorting through the plethora of postseason gridiron possibilities for Stanford 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
For the first time in three
years, Saturday's Big Game has
greater implications for Stanford
than just bragging rights. Indeed,
a bowl berth is on the line.
However, a win doesn't neces
sarily guarantee the Cardinal a
postseason spot and a loss doesn't
necessarily rule the team out
(though it makes the prospect
extremely unlikely). Here's what
the situation looks like:
The Pacific 10 Conference has
four guaranteed bowl berths in
1995. The biggest plum is a bid to
the Rose Bowl, which, as always,
goes to the league champion.
With its win over Oregon last Sat
urday, No. 11 USC (8-1-1 overall,
6-0-1 Pac-10) assured itself of a
trip to Pasadena on New Year's
Day to face the Big Ten champi
on.
A second Pac-10 team (but not
necessarily the second-place
team) will be invited to either the
Cotton Bowl (New Year's Day in
Dallas) or the Plymouth Holiday
Bowl (Dec. 29 in San Diego). The
Cotton Bowl will choose between
a Pac-10 team and the champion
of the Western Athletic Confer
ence.
It is unlikely that the Cotton
Bowl would choose a WAC team
over a Pac-10 team, but should
things turn out that way, the Pac
-10 team would play in the Holiday
Bowl. The opponent in either
bowl will come from the Big 12
(the current Big Eight plus the
four Southwest Conference mem
bers who will join the Big Eight
next year).

Although No. 22 Washington
(6-3, 5-1-1) would finish in second
place should it defeat Washington
State this weekend, the Cotton
Bowl will probably select No. 15
Oregon (8-2, 5-2) due to the
Ducks' better overall record and
higher national ranking.
After the Cotton Bowl has
made its selection, the highest
remaining team in the standings
will go to the Sun Bowl (Dec. 29 in
El Paso) to face a Big Ten oppo
nent. In the case of a tie, the Sun
Bowl has its choice among the
tied teams.
Because the Huskies can fin
ish no lower than third, they
have clinched a berth in one of
the two bowls. Should the Cotton
Bowl choose Oregon, as expect
ed, Washington will head to El
Paso.
If the Cotton Bowl surprises
everyone and chooses Washing
ton, the Sun Bowl will leap at the
chance to take Oregon, which can
finish no lower than tied for third.
After these three aforemen
tioned berths are filled, a fourth
team (not necessarily the fourth
place team) will go to the Jeep
Eagle Aloha Bowl (Christmas Day
in Honolulu) to face a Big 12
opponent.
It is this fourth and final Pac
-10 spot that concerns the Cardi
nal. Currently, Stanford (6-3-1, 4-
3) is tied with Arizona State (6-4,
4-3) for fourth place in the confer
ence. UCLA (6-4, 3-4) and Ari
zona (5-5, 3-4) lurk just behind.
Because the Aloha Bowl's pick is
subjective, it could take any team
which finishes with six wins —

The Cardinal's 31-30 loss to the Trojans set back bowl wishes, but Stanford is still primed to pounce on an opportunity to play 12
games this season. A Christmas present to Hawaii maybe?
