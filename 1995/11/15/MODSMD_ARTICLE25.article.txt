## Bowl hopes alive and well for Cardinal football Sorting through the plethora of postseason gridiron possibilities for Stanford 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
For the first time in three
years, Saturday's Big Game has
greater implications for Stanford
than just bragging rights. Indeed,
a bowl berth is on the line.
However, a win doesn't neces
sarily guarantee the Cardinal a
postseason spot and a loss doesn't
necessarily rule the team out
(though it makes the prospect
extremely unlikely). Here's what
the situation looks like:
The Pacific 10 Conference has
four guaranteed bowl berths in
1995. The biggest plum is a bid to
the Rose Bowl, which, as always,
goes to the league champion.
With its win over Oregon last Sat
urday, No. 11 USC (8-1-1 overall,
6-0-1 Pac-10) assured itself of a
trip to Pasadena on New Year's
Day to face the Big Ten champi
on.
A second Pac-10 team (but not
necessarily the second-place
team) will be invited to either the
Cotton Bowl (New Year's Day in
Dallas) or the Plymouth Holiday
Bowl (Dec. 29 in San Diego). The
Cotton Bowl will choose between
a Pac-10 team and the champion
of the Western Athletic Confer
ence.
It is unlikely that the Cotton
Bowl would choose a WAC team
over a Pac-10 team, but should
things turn out that way, the Pac
-10 team would play in the Holiday
Bowl. The opponent in either
bowl will come from the Big 12
(the current Big Eight plus the
four Southwest Conference mem
bers who will join the Big Eight
next year).

Although No. 22 Washington
(6-3, 5-1-1) would finish in second
place should it defeat Washington
State this weekend, the Cotton
Bowl will probably select No. 15
Oregon (8-2, 5-2) due to the
Ducks' better overall record and
higher national ranking.
After the Cotton Bowl has
made its selection, the highest
remaining team in the standings
will go to the Sun Bowl (Dec. 29 in
El Paso) to face a Big Ten oppo
nent. In the case of a tie, the Sun
Bowl has its choice among the
tied teams.
Because the Huskies can fin
ish no lower than third, they
have clinched a berth in one of
the two bowls. Should the Cotton
Bowl choose Oregon, as expect
ed, Washington will head to El
Paso.
If the Cotton Bowl surprises
everyone and chooses Washing
ton, the Sun Bowl will leap at the
chance to take Oregon, which can
finish no lower than tied for third.
After these three aforemen
tioned berths are filled, a fourth
team (not necessarily the fourth
place team) will go to the Jeep
Eagle Aloha Bowl (Christmas Day
in Honolulu) to face a Big 12
opponent.
It is this fourth and final Pac
-10 spot that concerns the Cardi
nal. Currently, Stanford (6-3-1, 4-
3) is tied with Arizona State (6-4,
4-3) for fourth place in the confer
ence. UCLA (6-4, 3-4) and Ari
zona (5-5, 3-4) lurk just behind.
Because the Aloha Bowl's pick is
subjective, it could take any team
which finishes with six wins —

The Cardinal's 31-30 loss to the Trojans set back bowl wishes, but Stanford is still primed to pounce on an opportunity to play 12
games this season. A Christmas present to Hawaii maybe?
even if other teams finish ahead in
the standings. For example, the bid
could go to UCLA even if Stanford
and ASU place ahead of the Bruins.
However, UCLA's hopes hinge
on upsetting USC this Saturday.
With star running back Karim
Abdul-Jabbar questionable for the
contest due to a sprained ankle sus
tained in the team's loss to Wash
ington, this seems unlikely. But if
both the Bruins and the Cardinal
win this weekend, don't be sur
prised to see UCLA fly off to
Hawaii for Christmas.
If UCIA is knocked out of the
picture, the bid will go to either
Stanford or one of the Arizona
schools. Since the Sun Devils and
Wildcats play against each other,
only one will emerge victorious. If
it's Arizona, Stanford gets the invi
tation (assuming that the Cardinal

downs California).
If both Stanford and ASU come
out winners, the decision becomes
thornier. Both squads would boast
seven wins. And although the Car
dinal would have in its favor one
less loss than ASU and a 30-28 vic
tory in a head-to-head contest with
the Sun Devils, Aloha Bowl repre
sentatives have said that these fac
tors will mean little to the commit
tee when it makes its decision.
The choice may ultimately
come down to style of play. And
while Arizona State would be a
team on a roll with five straight
victories, the Aloha Bowl has said
that it prefers Stanford.
Both Arizona State and Stanford
feature good quarterbacks, a talent
ed set of running backs, a solid corps
of receivers and defenses notorious
for surrendering a lot of points.
Both also upset Oregon in Eugene
and lost narrowly to Washington.
However, Stanford may hold
the edge because it has been in
every game it has played this sea

son. The Cardinal has pulled out
four games in the final minutes and
its three losses weren't decided
until the fourth quarter. ASU, on
the other hand, has been blown out
77-28 by Nebraska and shutout 31-
0 by USC. The fact that head coach
Tyrone Willingham is a candidate
for NCAA Coach of the Year also
helps Stanford's prospects.
Should the Cardinal be over
looked by the Aloha Bowl, an at
kirge bid to the Independence Bowl
(Dec. 29 in Shreveport) or an invi
tation to the Liberty Bowl (which
becomes available if only three Big
East teams finish with six or more
wins) remain as possibilities. Stan
ford would be compared against
other teams in the nation that
hadn't qualified for bowls, and the
squad could still be nosed out.
The politicking couldn't help
but enter into Willingham's mind.
But Willingham knows that all
these bowl permutations depend
upon the Cardinal beating Cal this
weekend. Stanford would be eligi

ble for a bowl bid even if it loses,
but expecting an invitation in such
a scenario borders on the absurd.
"lAthletic Director] Ted [Leland]
and I talk about the bowl situation
and what we'd like to see happen
and about trying to establish some
communication with the different
committees that will make the
selection," he said. "What we really
feel is important, though, is for us
to win our ball game — which
should allow us to be the fourth
place team in the conference. We
feel that for the integrity of the con
ference, the fourth-place team
should be selected. We hope that
takes the politics out of it."
Regardless of the preferences of
the bowl committees, the team
understands that a win is neces
sary for it to have a realistic shot at
realizing its postseason dreams.
"We've still got those guys from
across the Bay," said senior wide
receiver Mark Harris. "We still
have to finish the season the way
we envisioned it."
