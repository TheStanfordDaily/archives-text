### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
While still basking in the glorious
glow of a successful Rolex tournament
last week, the top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team scored another major
victory.
The team pulled off a tremendous
coup as it received letters of intent from
twin brothers Mike and Bob Bryan as
well as Geoff Abrams to play at Stanford
in 1996. By adding three of the top six
players in the 1994 Boys 16 and Under
age group, the Cardinal has positioned
itself to continue its winning ways. With
the loss of three key seniors next year,
head coach Dick Gould placed great
importance on the signings.
"No one else was on our scholarship
list," he said. "To get all three players
was critical to us."
The Bryans hail from Camarillo, Calif.

and attend Rio Mesa High School. They
were ranked third and fourth, respective
ly, in the 16 and Under age group. As a
doubles tandem, they ranked second.
Abrams is from Newport Beach, Calif.
However, he attends Palmer Academy in
Tampa, Fla. He was one-half of the top
doubles team in the 16 and Under age
group as well as sixth-best in singles
competition.
All three players were on the Elite
U.S. National Team. They have also
competed successfully in international
tournaments, most notably the Junior
Wimbledon and Junior U.S. Open tour
naments.
"We are delighted to add these three
players of world-class talent to the Stan
ford program," Gould said. "Not only are
we pleased to have Mike, Bob and Geoff
because of their athletic ability, but more
because of the type of people they are and
what they will bring to the program."
