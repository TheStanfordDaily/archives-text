# Nothing like big time rivalry to get Big Game juices flowing
## 
### 
Before the "modern" day, violence ran
rampant and was accepted as a legiti
mate method of establishing power in
society. Fear and physical intimidation were
essential tools to survival of the fittest. In a
world that now values sensitivity, love,
kindness and increasing political correct
ness, it's refreshing to ax that prior
restraint and plug some good, solid hatred
back into culture.

With Big Game on the horizon, it's offi
cially time once again to return to our
ancestors' Philistine tendencies. The man
ners, consideration and helpfulness
implanted in our beings long ago can be
packed up and stored away for the next five
days because the Bears are coming to town
and deserve nothing less than to be sent
directly into hibernation.
There is nothing healthier in life than an
intense, no-holds-barred rivalry. It simply
brings out the best (or worst, depending on
your school of thought) in everyone, both
players and fans.
For example, the "Go Card and
"Defense, Defense" chants are all well and
good for most games. But come Saturday,
ladies and gentlemen, reach back into the
deepest, darkest, most repressed parts of
the psyche and come up with something
that will offend someone across the bleach
ers. That's right. No Cal mother should be

safe from the abyss of animosity to fill Stan
ford Stadium.
Whereas going crazy and getting inde
cent on any other day of the year could
bring about a permanent stigma, Big Game
provides everyone an excuse to be what
everyone actually may want to be, but just
can't justify being: ugly, vulgar, abusive and
insulting.
Rivalry really is a beautiful thing. I per
sonally have grown up on it as a sports fan.
In the midst of the intense nastiness
between the Bulls and Pistons in the early
'90s, my sister began dating a guy from
Detroit, a relationship which I had some
serious difficulty allowing. Upon my first
meeting with him and his family, the two of
us proceeded to discuss (or should I say,
vehemently altercate), at heightened vol
umes, our respective positions. I went at
him without restraint, and when his moth
er stepped in for a brief moment, I did not
hesitate to put her back in her place. Did it
matter if he treated my sister well? Maybe,
but that was a chance I was unwilling to
take. Was he mature, intelligent, respect
ful? Most likely, but I had seen enough. It
took my sister a little longer to realize it, but
just as I suspected, the relationship eventu
ally failed. With such tremendous philo
sophical barriers, it just wasn't meant to be.
As I walked toward Stanford Stadium in
October for the Cardinal's contest with Wis
consin, I came across a Wisconsin native
who happened to be donning the yellow and
green on a Green Bay Packers jersey. Being
the considerate and socially responsible
gentleman that I am, I obviously was con
cerned that this man might continue going
about his day not realizing the tremendous
ly foolish decision he had made in front of
the mirror that morning.
