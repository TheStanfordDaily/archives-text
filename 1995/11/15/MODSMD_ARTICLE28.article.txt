The Stanford wrestling team
quietly and successfully wrestled
its way to a strong showing at the
All-California Open at Cal State
Fullerton last Saturday. The Car
dinal hopes its performance will
vault it to its best season in many
years. Team veterans and senior
co-captains Tod Surmon and
Jimmy Aguirre, along with four
other place winners, bolstered
head coach Chris Horpel's asser

The All-California event was
an open, meaning that there was

the Cardinal, Cal State Bakers

top four against a field which
included three top-10 teams. Ari
zona State, for instance, boasts a
No. 2 ranking.
