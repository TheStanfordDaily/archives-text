The Stanford wrestling team
quietly and successfully wrestled
its way to a strong showing at the
All-California Open at Cal State
Fullerton last Saturday. The Car
dinal hopes its performance will
vault it to its best season in many
years. Team veterans and senior
co-captains Tod Surmon and
Jimmy Aguirre, along with four
other place winners, bolstered
head coach Chris Horpel's asser
tion that this is Stanford's big
year.
The All-California event was
an open, meaning that there was
no team scoring. In addition to
the Cardinal, Cal State Bakers
field, Fresno State and Arizona
State also competed.
Despite entering the match
ranked 39th in the country, Stan
ford finished unofficially in the
top four against a field which
included three top-10 teams. Ari
zona State, for instance, boasts a
No. 2 ranking.

Despite a No. 39 preseason ranking, the Stanford wrestling team stands ready
to lock up against all comers this season.
wrestlers in each of the 10 weight
divisions. Stanford produced six
place winners, led by Aguirre and
Surmon, who captured their
weight divisions of 134 pounds
and 150 pounds, respectively.
They each went undefeated with
records of 4-0.
"As a whole, I was very pleased
with our performance," said Hor
pel, now in his 17th year as head

coach. "We won a lot of the close
matches, and our conditioning
was pretty good for this early in
the season. Producing two of the
10 champions was also nice."
Conditioning will be key to the
Cardinal's success. If Stanford
stays healthy, it has the potential to
break into the top 20, according to
senior Sahlan Martin, who placed
third in the 167-pound weight class.
The Cardinal is banking on its
experienced core of starters, con
sisting of Aguirre, Surmon, Mar
tin, Matt Cano (126 pounds) and
junior Brvan Vaniman, wrestling

at 190 pounds. The team also has
an abundance of raw young
starters, including sophomore
Jason Gladden (177), freshman
Frank Ruiz (118), redshirt fresh
man B.J. Sanchez (142) and
sophomore Scott Chapman (167).
Chapman and Sanchez placed sec
ond and fourth in the tourna
ment, respectively.
"This year, we have a lot of
older guys on the team," Horpel
said. "We've got lots of juniors
and seniors starting. We've got
experience, quality and depth.
This is our vear."
