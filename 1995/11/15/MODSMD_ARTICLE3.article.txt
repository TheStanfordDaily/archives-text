# Ram's Head up in arms
## Alumni write letter to protest lack of support for drama facilities 
### Shoshana Deutschkron 
Citing conditions which they say are making the
production of fine arts at Stanford increasingly diffi
cult, numerous alumni recently sent a letter to Uni
versity officials criticizing their lack of support for
student performing arts.
According to Tiffany Neill, one of the alumni who
signed the letter, "Stanford has taken a negatively ag
gressive trend toward the arts and is hostile toward
the arts in general." Neill added that she feels this
trend started when she was at Stanford and has
"snowballed" since she graduated in 1993.
The letter — compiled by Daniel Goldman, class of
'95, and signed by 38 alumni of the Ram's Head The
atrical Society — is dated Nov. 1. It states that the
alumni are "dismayed at the treatment which stu
dent performing groups are afforded by the Universi
ty departments upon which they depend, and on the
state of the arts at Stanford in general."
Jeffrey Meador, who graduated last year, said the
letter "expressed a lot of concerns that I was feeling

last year, and the issues needed to be out in the open."
Meador said he thought it was important to "bolster
communication between Ram's Head, alumni and
the University because the problems we are facing
are not only Ram's Head's, but all organizations po
tentially."
Recipients of the letter included University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, Provost Condoleezza Rice, Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds and Dean
of Students Marc Wais.
In the letter, Goldman cited two specific adminis
trative decisions which he claimed "adversely affect
t he student group Ram's Head Theatrical Society and
the performing arts on the Stanford campus." They
include the decision to delay the repair of the lighting
board and the eviction of Ram's Head's prop and cos
tume room from the basement of Burbank in Stern
Hall.
The first action criticized in the letter is Event Ser
vices' recent decision "to delay the repair or replace-
ment of Memorial Auditorium's
lighting board until next year, crip
pling the auditorium's utility for
performance purposes."
The current lighting board
ceased to operate last spring dur
ing Ram's Head's production of
"Once On This Island." In an
interview, Goldman said that with
out a lighting board, variation of
the lighting in Mem Aud is limited
to having the lights on or off.
Bruce Krempetz, production
manager for Event Services, said
Stanford Events, which is respon
sible for producing large-scale
events on campus, received
approval on funding to replace the
current lighting board Sept. 1.
However, installation of a new
lighting board will require closing
the auditorium for six weeks. This
installation will not be feasible
until next summer, he said.
The letter also cited a decision
to evict Ram's Head "from its prop
and costume room in the basement
of Burbank House in Stern Hall."
This storage space had been used
by Ram's Head for more than 18
years.
Up until last year, Ram's Head
was one of three student activities
occupying areas in student resi
dences. The two other activities
were pottery and photography,
both of which were also evicted
from their spaces this year.
Former Ram's Head executive
producer Jeffrey Meador said he,
along with current Board of Direc
tors member Sal ma Qarnain, met
last year with Cesar Cervantes,
facilities supervisor at Stern Hall.
During this meeting, it was
decided that Ram's Head's belong
ings would be moved out this sum
mer during the renovations to
Stern. However, Meador claimed
that Cervantes said with "abso

lutely no uncertainty that once
Stern Hall reopened, Ram's Head
would be able to move their
belongings back into their space."
In addition, the group was told
that they may even be able to
obtain more space.
At the beginning of this year,
however, executive producer
Laura Wilson was "informed that
Ram's Head's belongings would
not be returned to their former
location and that the organization
could not have access to them in
their current location in storage in
Zapata," the letter stated.
According to Keith Guy, direc
tor of Housing and Dining Ser
vices, the general decision was
"made during the process of reno
vating that groups provided with
space in student residences needed
to find space elsewhere."
Reasons given for the change
include liability factors and the
fact that "student space should be
used by students who live in the
buildings and pay the rent," he
said.
Wilson described relations
between the University and Ram's
Head as a "very unfortunate situa
tion." She said she hopes that the
letter will be beneficial because of
the value of alumni to the Univer
sity and thinks that the letter "can
only help."
Recently, Wilson spoke to Jean
Fetter, assistant to the president,
about Ram's Head's space difficul
ties. Fetter advised Wilson to con
tact Nanci Howe, director of stu
dent activities, about the issue.
Since then, Howe has arranged
for Ram's Head to use a temporary
space in (he Elliot Program Center
and has promised to continue to
work with Ram's Head in order to
find a long term solution to the
organization's space problems.
Howe has also asked Wilson to
compile a proposal for long term
storage space so that the Universi
ty can identify Ram's Head's
needs.

and has promised to continue to
work with Ram's Head in order to
find a long term solution to the
organization's space problems.
Howe has also asked Wilson to
compile a proposal for long term
storage space so that the Universi

needs.
Citing conditions which they say are making the
production of fine arts at Stanford increasingly diffi
cult, numerous alumni recently sent a letter to Uni
versity officials criticizing their lack of support for
student performing arts.
According to Tiffany Neill, one of the alumni who
signed the letter, "Stanford has taken a negatively ag
gressive trend toward the arts and is hostile toward
the arts in general." Neill added that she feels this
trend started when she was at Stanford and has
"snowballed" since she graduated in 1993.
The letter — compiled by Daniel Goldman, class of
'95, and signed by 38 alumni of the Ram's Head The
atrical Society — is dated Nov. 1. It states that the
alumni are "dismayed at the treatment which stu
dent performing groups are afforded by the Universi
ty departments upon which they depend, and on the
state of the arts at Stanford in general."
Jeffrey Meador, who graduated last year, said the
letter "expressed a lot of concerns that I was feeling

last year, and the issues needed to be out in the open."
Meador said he thought it was important to "bolster
communication between Ram's Head, alumni and
the University because the problems we are facing
are not only Ram's Head's, but all organizations po
tentially."
Recipients of the letter included University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, Provost Condoleezza Rice, Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds and Dean
of Students Marc Wais.
In the letter, Goldman cited two specific adminis
trative decisions which he claimed "adversely affect
t he student group Ram's Head Theatrical Society and
the performing arts on the Stanford campus." They
include the decision to delay the repair of the lighting
board and the eviction of Ram's Head's prop and cos
tume room from the basement of Burbank in Stern
Hall.
The first action criticized in the letter is Event Ser
vices' recent decision "to delay the repair or replace-
ment of Memorial Auditorium's
lighting board until next year, crip
pling the auditorium's utility for
performance purposes."
The current lighting board
ceased to operate last spring dur
ing Ram's Head's production of
"Once On This Island." In an
interview, Goldman said that with
out a lighting board, variation of
the lighting in Mem Aud is limited
to having the lights on or off.
Bruce Krempetz, production
manager for Event Services, said
Stanford Events, which is respon
sible for producing large-scale
events on campus, received
approval on funding to replace the
current lighting board Sept. 1.
However, installation of a new
lighting board will require closing
the auditorium for six weeks. This
installation will not be feasible
until next summer, he said.
The letter also cited a decision
to evict Ram's Head "from its prop
and costume room in the basement
of Burbank House in Stern Hall."
This storage space had been used
by Ram's Head for more than 18
years.
Up until last year, Ram's Head
was one of three student activities
occupying areas in student resi
dences. The two other activities
were pottery and photography,
both of which were also evicted
from their spaces this year.
Former Ram's Head executive
producer Jeffrey Meador said he,
along with current Board of Direc
tors member Sal ma Qarnain, met
last year with Cesar Cervantes,
facilities supervisor at Stern Hall.
During this meeting, it was
decided that Ram's Head's belong
ings would be moved out this sum
mer during the renovations to
Stern. However, Meador claimed
that Cervantes said with "abso

lutely no uncertainty that once
Stern Hall reopened, Ram's Head
would be able to move their
belongings back into their space."
In addition, the group was told
that they may even be able to
obtain more space.
At the beginning of this year,
however, executive producer
Laura Wilson was "informed that
Ram's Head's belongings would
not be returned to their former
location and that the organization
could not have access to them in
their current location in storage in
Zapata," the letter stated.
According to Keith Guy, direc
tor of Housing and Dining Ser
vices, the general decision was
"made during the process of reno
vating that groups provided with
space in student residences needed
to find space elsewhere."
Reasons given for the change
include liability factors and the
fact that "student space should be
used by students who live in the
buildings and pay the rent," he
said.
Wilson described relations
between the University and Ram's
Head as a "very unfortunate situa
tion." She said she hopes that the
letter will be beneficial because of
the value of alumni to the Univer
sity and thinks that the letter "can
only help."
Recently, Wilson spoke to Jean
Fetter, assistant to the president,
about Ram's Head's space difficul
ties. Fetter advised Wilson to con
tact Nanci Howe, director of stu
dent activities, about the issue.
Since then, Howe has arranged
for Ram's Head to use a temporary
space in (he Elliot Program Center
and has promised to continue to
work with Ram's Head in order to
find a long term solution to the
organization's space problems.
Howe has also asked Wilson to
compile a proposal for long term
storage space so that the Universi
ty can identify Ram's Head's
needs.
