Citing conditions which they say are making the
production of fine arts at Stanford increasingly diffi

versity officials criticizing their lack of support for
student performing arts.
According to Tiffany Neill, one of the alumni who
signed the letter, "Stanford has taken a negatively ag

the performing arts on the Stanford campus." They
include the decision to delay the repair of the lighting
