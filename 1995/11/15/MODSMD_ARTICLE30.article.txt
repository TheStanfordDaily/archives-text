Men's basketball
The Stanford men's basketball team opened its season last night by defeating the Mexican National
Team 89-79 in front of 1,889 at Maples Pavilion. Despite winning, the Cardinal did not perform up to
expectations. Sophomore Tim Young paced Stanford with 20 points and 10 rebounds.
"It's easy for people to get carried away," said head coach Mike Montgomery. "Fundamentally, we
were poor defensively — slow to the ball, not getting hands in shooters' faces."
