# Video system to enliven campus station
## SCBN upgrades the way it broadcasts movies, taped events, in effort to improve service

In a move to expand its broadcasting capabil
ities, Stanford's "Imagination Station" has
acquired a now automated video playback sys
tem which will jillow it to run full-day broadcast
schedules.
The Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting Net
work (SCBN), which purchased its new system
with ASSU financial backing, still plans to
broadcast only from 6 p.m. to midnight daily,
said Programming Director Tudor Havriliuc.
He added, however, that the automation system
will improve the quality of both the station and
its programs.
According to Station Manager Eric Gavidia,
one obvious benefit, is "improved service"
through "the elimination of human error."
With the automated system, the proper broad
casts and air times are pre-set, thereby remov
ing the possibility of mistakes and delays.
In addition, SCBN will no longer have to

commit employees to the task of manual pro
gramming. "This will allow us to dedicate our
selves to starting new programs like entertain
ment shows and student projects," said Havrili
uc.
Technical Director Trevor Gattis noted that
this will put more emphasis "on projects and
filming instead of programming."
Currently, SCBN serves primarily as an
entertainment channel for Stanford students.
Its daily programming schedule includes
movies, better known as "Teleflicks," as well as
music video programs.
With the resources freed by the new automa
tion system, Havriliuc said he plans to start new
projects to diversify SCBN's broadcasts. Possi
bilities include a news division and a talk show
forum which organizations like the Stanford
College Republicans and the Stanford
Democrats could use to present and discuss
campus events and issues, he said.
The automation system consists of a six

VCKs and connecting equipment which car
handle up to 24 hours of broadcasting a day
With financial backing from the ASSU, SCBN
purchased the equipment for about $5,000.
Gavidia initiidly negotiated an agreement for
financial support with ASSU Financial Manag
er John Hall in July. Hall wanted SCBN to run
ASSU-sponsored Teleflicks on a regular basis
Gavidia said. However, this required an
automation system, which SCBN did not have
The final agreement stipulated that the ASSU
would buy the system and that the station
would be obligated to repay the debt.
(iattis said that the station will repay the
ASSU through either special fee funding or
through a gradual repayment process, depen
dent upon whether S( 'BN receives a special fee
next spring. If it is not approved for a special
fee, SCBN will pay the ASSU back over seven
years.
