### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
In the traditionally spirited
week before Big Game, Stanford
Police have arrested two Cal
Bears for leaving a trail of blue
and gold paw prints all over cam
pus.
UC-Berkeley students Thuon
Fin Chen, 21, and Steven Andrew
Brown, 24, were arrested early
Monday morning for allegedly
spray-painting bear paws around
the campus.
Stanford Police Capt. llaoul
Niemeyer said the two "Berkeley
frankfurters" were caught out
side Gate 1 near Stanford Stadi
um when a special security offi
cer hired for Big Game week
heard the shaking of an aerosol
can while he was sitting inside
his parked vehicle. He then heard
the hissing of paint and spotted
Chen and Brown painting paws
on the ground, Niemeyer said.
He asked them to halt, but they
immediately ran off in opposite
directions.
Brown headed due south
toward the Quad and Chen
headed toward the eucalyptus
grove across Galvez Street,
Niemeyer said. Stanford Police
surrounded the grove with the
help of the Palo Alto Police
Department.
Police heard Chen rustling in
the bushes and told him to come
out because fhe place was sur

rounded. When Chen did not give
himself up, Stanford Police offi
cer Harris Kuhn went into the
grove and found Chen hiding
under a bush.
Chen was carrying a backpack
full of blue and gold aerosol paint
cans, Niemeyer said. He also had
blue and gold paint on his sweat
pants and hands. He was arrested
for trespassing, vandalism, pos
session of paint with the intent to
vandalize and resisting arrest.
Chen was booked at Santa Clara
County Jail and later released on
bail.
Brown was arrested later in
the morning when the special
security officer noticed a white
Honda Civic driving slowly back
and forth in front of the stadium.
Police stopped the car, discovered
Brown in the driver's seat with
four cans of aerosol paint in the
car and arrested him for being in
possession of paint with the
intent to vandalize.
Brown admitted to the crime
and was released pending review
by the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney.
Police discovered blue and gold
bear paws on the ground outside
of Green Library, Meyer Library
and Tresidder Memorial Union
and believe Chen and Brown are
responsible, Niemeyer said.
"We need to let these Berkeley
students know that we have bear
traps all over the place," Niemey
er said.
