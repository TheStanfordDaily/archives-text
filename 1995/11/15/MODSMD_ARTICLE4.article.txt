# Senators quiz Dean Shoven on minors, Food Research Institute
## ASSU enters curriculum debate 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, spent time at last night's
ASSIJ meeting addressing the
issue of the Food Research Insti
tute, as well as the new option to
minor.
Shoven proposed in a letter to
the institute two weeks ago that
the Food Research Institute's
doctoral program be cut and that

the master's program be reduced to an interdisci
plinary center.
In response to a request for clarification of his
reasons for the transition, Shoven stressed that the
issue was "not whether the institute works on agri

cultural issues, but in what structure that work is
done."
Ho questioned whether the institute, "largely a
group of economists working as a separate depart
ment, is the best structure." Shoven stressed that
the institute would "not be a normal interdiscipli
nary program, but an interdisciplinary research
center that will not be housed in the Economics De
partment."
Shoven went on to say that the change in the in
stitute would not signal a retreat from internation
al research or a decrease in prestige.
But some at the meeting disagreed. Several in
stitute students were present at the ASSU meeting
with banners reading, "Hey Stanford: Don't axe
the Food Research Institute."
b "How could Shoven's decision not harm the

prestige of the Food Research
Institute?" asked David Widaw
sky, a fifth-year doctoral student,
after the meeting. "Our Ph.D.s
have historically been hired to
impressive organizations like the
World Hank. Shoven says no more
doctoral program, but without a
Ph.D., students simply won't get
hired. I think that's tragic."
Widawsky expressed his disap
proval of the University's expla
nation that the institute's trans

formation was necessitated by the
retirement of several current
institute faculty.
"The fact that people are retir
ing is no reason to close the
department, it's reason to replace
them and go on," said Widawsky.
"Will [Shoven] close other depart
ments when faculty members
retire? I believe the retirement of
faculty is a pretty regular thing."
When asked what he thought
the advantages of the institute's
transformation were, Shoven said
the hiring of new senior faculty
members over the next few years
would improve the quality of
teaching in interdisciplinary

fields.
He added, however, that in the
meantime, the transition would
be a "difficult and painful" one.
Shoven, in response to ques
tions from ASSIJ senators, also
addressed the issue of tin- new
undergraduate minor program,
explaining specifically how he
would implement guidelines for a
minor and when the minor opt ion
would be available.
Today marks the deadline for
departments to submit proposals
for a minor program. Although
the actual structure of the pro
gram has not been decided,
Shoven did say that all minors

will be reviewed bv a curriculum
committee looking for a "struc
tured set of courses." The option
to minor will probably be avail
able next year, he said, with
courses taken before counting
toward the minor.
Shoven specified that the
minor would probably require a
five- or six-course sequence, and
that every department offering a
major will have a minor.
"1 think a strong major plus a
minor is better than any double
major," said Shoven. "I wouldn't
be surprised it 75 percent of Stan
ford students are completing a
minor in the next five years."
