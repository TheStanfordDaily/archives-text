## Government shutdown continues amid budget impasse 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With the
Smithsonian's museums shuttered and
federal workers sent home in droves, the
Clinton administration and Republican
leaders failed to reach accord on the budget
yesterday and sharply attacked each other
over a partial government shutdown.
"At this time, I have to tell you we are at
an impasse," White House Chief of Staff
Leon Panetta said after several hours of
talks with GOP leaders ended without
agreement.
With the shutdown less than one day
old, however, Republicans moved to shel
ter certain politically popular programs
from disruption.
The first effects of the shutdown were
felt as the political positioning unfolded,
although essential services such as the

nation's defense, air traffic control system
and prison operations were maintained
without interruption.
"Due to the federal government shut
down, the Smithsonian Institution must
be closed," read signs posted up and down
Washington's Mall, home to museums
where millions flock annually to gaze at
exhibits of art, space exploration, natural
history and more.
Some 800,000 of the 2.1 million federal
civilian workers in Washington and
around the world had a place to go â€” home
from their offices after reporting to work
and being told their services were
nonessential.
The American Federation of Govern
ment Employees filed a lawsuit challeng
ing the administration's handling of the

situation, including its definition of essen
tial workers and its authority to require
them to work without knowing when they
would be paid. A federal judge scheduled a
hearing for tomorrow.
And with the government's routine bor
rowing authority expiring as well, Trea
sury Secretary Robert Rubin said he would
take unspecified steps "to avert the default
that will otherwise take place."
The shutdown was triggered Monday
night when Clinton vetoed legislation nec
essary to maintain regular government
spending, saying he did so because it would
have raised Medicare premiums. A White
House meeting that lasted until the mid
night hour failed to resolve the impasse.
Earlier, Clinton vetoed a measure nec
essary to extend government borrowing

authority, citing provisions he said would
restrict Rubin's ability to manage the gov
ernment's finances. Despite the uncertain
ty, financial markets reacted calmly to the
events in Washington.
At the White House, spokesman Mike
McCurry replied with an abrupt "Yes,"
when asked if he thought the government
would remain shut down today, and he
said the standoff could be lengthy.
At the Capitol, Democrats in both hous
es sought to pass short-term legislation to
reopen the government, but majority
Republicans blocked votes in the proposals.
Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., reflecting
many members of his party, said Gingrich
hiid begun planning last spring to use the
threat of a government shutdown to
impose his "radical and extreme agenda"

on Clinton.
Republicans struggled to shift the focus
from Medicare to their own seven-year bal
anced budget plan. After more than two
weeks of House-Senate compromise talks,
they were racing to resolve remaining dif
ferences over school lunches, the federal
dairy program and other issues, and send it
to Clinton by week's end.
That bill, too, faces a presidential veto,
since it would cut the growth of spending
on Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and other
programs and includes a large tax cut that
Democrats charge is targeted to the rich.
Republicans, however, were hoping that
budget balancing bill would regenerate the
political leverage they lost when Clinton
cited higher Medicare premiums as the rea
son for his veto of the stopgap spending bill.
