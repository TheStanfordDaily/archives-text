Security Council might expand
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The United
States said yesterday it would not support any
enlargement of the U.N. Security Council unless
Germany and Japan gained permanent member
ship.
The statement, delivered to the General
Assembly, by U.S. delegate Karl Inderf'urth
places the Clinton administration at odds with
Italy as well as some Central American countries
which want to see the system of permanent mem
bership phased out.
Permanent members — the United States,
Britain, France, Russia and China — have the
sole right to veto council resolutions, which are
legally binding on the 185 member states.
"We enthusiastically endorse the candidacies
of Japan and Germany for permanent member
ship," Inderfurth said on the second day of
Assembly debate on reforming the council.
"Indeed, the United States could not agree to a
council enlargement that did not result in their
permanent membership."
During Monday's debate, France and Britain
also endorsed permanent membership for Ger
many and Japan because of their economic clout.
It would mark the first expansion of the council
in the U.N.'s 50-year history.
It would also elevate to full membership two of
World War IPs vanquished powers, a status

which had been reserved for the conflict's win
ners.
Runoff needed in Guatemalan
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Wealthy busi
nessman Alvaro Arzu and lawyer Alfonso Portillo
will meet Jan. 7 in a runoff election, since neither
won with an absolute majority in last Sunday's
presidential vote.
Both are conservatives, but Portillo is farther
to the right than Arzu, the reformist former
mayor of Guatemala City. The winner takes
office Jan. 14 for a five-year term.
With almost 98 percent of the precincts report
ing yesterday, Arzu, of the Advanced National
Party, was ahead with 563,599 votes, or 36.55
percent. Portillo, of the Guatemalan Republican
Front, had 340,844 votes, or 22.11 percent.
In contrast to recent elections in Central Amer
ica, the voting Sunday was accompanied byfew
accusations of irregularities and no violence.
But absenteeism also was high. More than half
of the country's 3.7 million registered voters
failed to cast ballots, despite campaigns by the
government, the parties and even leftist guerril
las urging people to vote.
The leftist National Guatemalan Revolution
ary Unity rebels announced a 13-day truce during
elections, the first ever in Guatemala's 35-year
civil war. The truce ended Monday, but there have
been no reports of rebel act ivity since then.
