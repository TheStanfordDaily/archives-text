hone Calls
To Your Bank?
i
Some local banks give you three free phone calls per
month, then charge you $1.50 for each additional call to
a live operator. At the Stanford Federal Credit Union, we
offer our members free, unlimited phone service. And your
calls are answered by real people, rather than automated
voices with a list of confusing options.
That's because we're here to serve your banking and
borrow ing needs, not to generate corporate profits. Your
credit union is a not-for-profit, member-owned institution
that has been helping Stanford students, faculty and staff
for 35 years. So. if you're looking for a financial institution
that will take care of you. instead of taking you for a ride,
maybe it's time you checked us out.
