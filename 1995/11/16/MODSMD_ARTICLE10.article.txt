## Clinton, Congress prepare for long budget battle 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With a partial
shutdown stretching through a second dis
ruptive day, Republicans crafled legisla
tion yesterday to reopen government on
condition President Clinton agrees to bal
ance the budget in seven years.
Clinton threatened to veto the measure
even before the lawmakers could pass it,
saying the GOP was demanding "a level of
cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, in educa
tion, in the environment and a tax increase
on working people, ail of which I find objec
tionable."
In an interview on CBS, Clinton vowed
to hold firm in the standoff, "even if it's 90
days, 120 days or 180 days."
That left the impasse without any clear
end in sight, and with the two sides scram
bling for political position on an issue that
has divided them all year.
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,

D-S.D., accused House Speaker Newt Gin
grich of provoking the budget crunch. "He
wants chaos. He wants collapse of the gov
ernment, and now he's got it."
Congress, meanwhile, completed work
on a spending bill that would, among other
things, provide the money to keep the
White House running through the year.
While Clinton did not sign that immedi
ately, he did sign a measure putting the
Transportation Department in business
for the year; Congress finished that bill
last month, but it wasn't sent to the White
House until Wednesday.
As for the proposed legislation that
would reopen the entire government
through Dec. 5 while requiring Clinton to
b.ilance the budget by 2002, Gingrich and
Dole unveiled it shortly before the evening
newscasts aired in the East.
"We're going to give him a chance to

sign up for a balanced budget," said Gin
grich, R-Ga. Both he and Dole, R-Kan.,
said Clinton had repeatedly expressed sup
port for such a plan.
In a retreat for Republicans, the bill
would lack the hike in Medicare premiums
that Clinton cited in vetoing an earlier bill.
It would put Clinton on record in favor
of technical economic estimates made by
the Congressional Budget Office — less
optimistic than the administration's own.
McCurry signing that bill would be tan
tamount to accepting the GOP balanced
budget bill, which would squeeze many
social programs while financing a tax cut
that Democrats say favors the rich.
"By endorsing the seven-year balanced
budget, you have to endorse their Medi
care cuts. You have to endorse their whole
budget. And the president has said that's
unacceptable," said McCurry.
