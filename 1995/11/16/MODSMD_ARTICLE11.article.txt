WASHINGTON (AP) - An angry
Newt Gingrich said yesterday that Clinton
administration snubs during lengthy
flights to and from Yitzhak Rabin's funer
al led to this week's budget impasse and
government shutdown.
A lack of contact with the President
during the 25 hours in flight, along with
the request that GOP leaders exit through
the rear of the plane were "part of why
you ended up with us sending down a
tougher continuing resolution," Gingrich
said. The resolution, a measure to keep
the government running for a brief period,
was vetoed by President Clinton on Mon
day.
"You just wonder where is their sense of

manners, where is their sense of courtesy,"
Gingrich sputtered. "Was it just a sign of
utter incompetence or lack of considera
tion, or was it a deliberate strategy of
insult? I don't know which it was."
White House spokesman Mike McCur
ry said Gingrich was treated with "utmost
courtesy," including being allowed to bring
his wife along on the trip. Presidents Bush
and Carter, along with tiie delegation from
Congress, were told that there was insuffi
cient room for wives on the flight.
"The president of the United States lost
a friend. And I don't think he much felt
like talking about budget politics with
Speaker Gingrich, with all due respect,"
McCurry said.
