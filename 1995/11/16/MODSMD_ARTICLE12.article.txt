New science core must
challenge and appeal to
non-technical students

IN LAST WEEK'S Faculty Sen
ate meeting, Mathematics Prof.
Brad Osgood, the chair of the
committee creating Stanford's
Mathematics-Science-Engineering
Core, presented three tracks that
will make up the new distribution
requirement. Though they have no
formal titles, the three-quarter
classes are affectionately known as
the "Earthlings," the "Heartbreak
ers" and the "Illuminati."
Hopefully these tracks — cov
ering the physical history and
future of the Earth, the human
heart and the quality and uses of
light — will be more rigorous than
the above names imply. The impe
tus behind the core is to encourage
non-technical students to pursue
serious study in the natural sci
ences, math and engineering —
without letting them get away
with the now-common practice of
satisfying these requirements
through courses easier than those
offered in high school.
The University is on the right
track with its push to make sci
ence courses more rigorous while
also trying to appeal to "fuzzies,"
but faculty members will have to
take extra effort to find a balance
between the two objectives. While
the tracks are still in the planning
stages, their creators must make
certain that the courses are not
too easy, even though they are
designed for non-technical majors.
At the same time, the courses have
to be interesting enough so that
students will be willing to take the
cOre, even though it is not
required.
Take the "Earthlings" track for
example. According to the commit
tee's preliminary proposal, the
class will focus on four themes:
global change, the origin and evo-

lution of life on earth, living with
natural hazards and earth
resources and the sustainability of
life. The course may include field
trips to local geologic points of
interest to collect samples for anal
ysis in later laboratory experi
ments.
This three-quarter series has
the potential to be an exciting,
hard-core look at the way the
world works — including study
ing intensely the chemistry of
earth materials, the biology of
human evolution and the physical
principles of energy use. Unfortu
nately, it also has the potential to
be about as easy — and as uninter
esting — as an eighth-grade earth
science class, complete with trips
to the beach to study erosion and
experiments that any 13-year-old
with a chemistry set could do.
Non-technical students deserve
better and must be challenged.
"Fuzzie" majors may not have the
same abilities in math and science
that their "techie" counterparts
possess, but their math SAT scores
must still have been high enough
for them to get into the University.
But there is also the challenge
of making the track appeal to non
technical majors without making
it a requirement. With Cultures,
Ideas and Values required for
everyone, nobody is going to want
to take a non-required, three
quarter track unless it's intellectu
ally exciting and challenging. The
task for the core's creators is to
walk the fine line between making
the three tracks so difficult that
students will opt for an easier DR,
or so easy that the core loses its
whole purpose.
More than two years of thought
have already gone into the creation
of this new requirement, from the
initial study done by the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
to the recent work of the science
core committee. The core has both
a noble purpose and the potential
to meet it. It would be a shame to
see it become just another easy dis
tribution requirement — slipping
by with little gained.
