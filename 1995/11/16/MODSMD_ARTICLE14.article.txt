# Jon Ganz and Rand Blackford
## Choose your adventure 
### 
AS YOU MAY not know, lately we
have been barraged with criticism
for our frivolity and our careful
sidestepping of the issues. So this week,
we have decided to solve the controversy
surrounding Asian sex tours — the prac
tice of going to Southeast Asia for the
purpose of costly, extramarital sex. But
we feel that it is not the duty of a colum
nist to spoon-feed you an opinion.
Instead, we have chosen to provide you
with a choose-your-adventure-esque
guide to help you decide your own posi
tion on this highly controversial issue. So
let's get started. If you have an inkling
that you might support this issue, go to
the paragraph starting with "D." Other
wise, go to G.
Believe it or not, the other wrestler also
chooses the path of non-violence. Unfor
tunately, the warlords are not amused
with your antics and send ninja warriors
to destroy the both of you with throwing
stars. Ironically, you now find yourself an
ally with the wrestler you were pitted
against just moments before. If you think
this is really weird, go to T. If you opt for
running like hell, go to N. If instead, you
rely on the confusionary tactics of unrav
eling your sumo strappings, go to M.
Curses! You realize that your place will
not be that of a mighty samurai warrior,
but rather as a sex kitten for the real
samurai warriors. Isn't life filled with till

sorts of ironies?
Doh! You have fallen into a time-space
warp continuum and are cast into the
Sarnac Pit near Jabba's palace. Here you
are to be slowly digested with Boba Fett
over 1000 years. Your adventure is over.
Serves you right for thinking sex tours
are not a bad thing. Try again.
Golly you've been thrown into a Cave of
Time and seem to have landed in feudal
Japan! Astutely, you notice that you are
clad only in the revealing strappings of a
sumo wrestler. You cleverly deduce that
there are two rival clans who have chosen
you to settle their differences in the sumo
ring. Across from you is a burly 700-pound
wrestler. If you throw salt, slap your belly
and choose to fight, go to Y. If you choose
the path of non-violence, go to B.
Mooning the ninjas amuses your feudal
Japanese friends to no end. They are
impressed with your cunning, your brav
ery and your smoothness. They ask you
to join their happy clan. If you are willing
to readjust your life's game plan to
include whimsical feudal pleasures, Noh
tragedies and sword play, go to C. If you
decline politely and scamper back to the
Cave of Time, go to W.
Ninjas are faster than you, ding-a-ling!
An arrow through the back of your throat
also teaches you the painful lesson that
ninjas are more heavily armed than the
common man. Please try again.

There's no time to think in feudal Japan!
If you think, you're dead. In that moment
of flickering thought, your tongue is
ripped out, your ears boxed, your larynx
removed with a throwing star, your fin
gernails separated with burning bamboo,
your nose hairs trimmed and your honor
deflowered. Ouch!
What are you thinking? You could have
had everything! Well, anyway, loser, the
übiquitous Cave of Time hurls you into a
land war in Asia where you are subse
quently riddled with bullets. A bit poetic,
isn't it?
You win! Violence seems to be the answer
in this case, doesn't it?! Well, we certain
ly hope that you have learned from this
little thought experiment on Asian sex
tours. You may have noticed that only
through violence was the issue at hand
resolved. However, we do not endorse
senseless violence to solve all of life's
complex issues. We prefer thumb
wrestling bouts (best two out of three)
over a nice pint or two in the late after
noon at the Coffee House as the best way
to resolve these modern-day moral quag
mires.

Mr. Ganz and Mr. Blackford certainly
have a most bizarre sense of humor.
