Dean Shoven misrepresented FRI closing to ASSU

Tuesday at the assu Senate
meeting, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven, with ques
tionable logic, responded to questions
from senators asking him to justify his
recommendation to close the Food
Resoarch Institute (FRI) as a degree
granting program and to "restructure" i
a $ m\ interdisciplinary research center.
Allowing him to convince President
Casper to sanction a closure of FRI
based on these ill-conceived notions
would be a grave injustice to Stanford
and a detriment to the world develop
ment community.
According to Shoven, the institute's
"restructuring" does not diminish Stan
ford's.commitment to international
issues? and the needs of the world's poor.
In truth, the "restructuring" Shoven
prOposes eliminates FRl's Ph.D. pro
gram, with the result that uniquely
qualified FRI doctoral students who gar
ner top jobs in international develop
ment! will no longer be available for
those positions. Since these top jobs are
open only to those with a Ph.D., Stan-

ford will cease to make this critical con
tribution to international development.
Therefore, rather than "restructuring,"
Shoven is actually proposing to eviscer
ate FRI.
According to Shoven, FRl's important
work in international development will
continue more efficiently as an interdis
ciplinary research institute.
In truth, of the approximately 20-25
professors working on international
development at Stanford, more than half
are from FRI. Under Shoven's plan, all
FRI faculty will either be fired or retire
in a few short years, and no faculty posi
tions for his alleged "center" are guaran
teed, leaving such a "center" thoroughly
incapable of matching FRl's current
high-quality program. Shoven is utterly
specious in his claim that his "center"
will successfully replace the current
highly-acclaimed masters program of
nuts-and-bolts policy economics while
continuing to attract top students who
go on to play important roles in policy
jobs around the world.
According to Shoven, upcoming

retirements by several FRI faculty
necessitate reassessing the role of the
institute.
In truth, retirements occur constantly
in all departments at Stanford, at least
in departments where people do not live
forever. The reasonable policy in the
past was to hire new faculty to replace
those who retire, not to eliminate suc
cessful departments like FRI. Shoven's
claim implies that any department with
distinguished senior faculty ought to
prepare to be eliminated as a matter of
policy. At a university with otherwise
high intellectual standards, Shoven's
position would be laughable were it not
such an affront to common sense.
According to Shoven, when you think
of a great university, you don't think of
a food research institute.
In truth, in founding Stanford,
Leland Stanford Sr. stated that one of
the University's objectives was "to quali
fy students for personal success and
direct usefulness in life; and to promote
the public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civiliza

tion." FRI graduates dedicate them
selves to help solve global problems of
hunger and poverty, and with their
unique training at FRI, consistently lead
the world by winning top-level jobs in
development organizations globally.
What program better embodies the origi
nal goals of this great university?
Unfortunately, Shoven has refused a
public debate on these issues, necessitat
ing that his (mis)claims be scrutinized
under the harsh light of fact in these
public pages. Further, he told me at the
ASSU meeting that such debate is extra
neous since Stanford is not compelled to
make decisions publicly. Before it is too
late, please let University President Ger
hard Casper know by phone, fax or e
mail that Shoven's behind-closed-doors
stratagem of demolishing FRI is an out
rage to the Stanford community and an
insult to the mission of Stanford Univer
sity. Join us in our protest fast in White
Plaza today and tomorrow.
