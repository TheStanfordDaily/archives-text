Although Proposition 187 has not yet been enact
ed, its influence is already noticeable both in new
government initiatives and in immigrant communi
ties, according to a panel at the Law School last
night.
"Although [Proposition 187] is not enforced,
there is a tremendous fear and a tremendous anxiety
in the immigrant and Latino communities," said
Anamaria Loya, a staff attorney for the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Education Fund.
The panel, entitled "The Expanding Attack on
Immigrants: Prop. 187 and Beyond," was moderated
by Law Prof. Bill Ong Hing. In addition to Loya, pan
elists included Lina Avidan, the director of public
policy for the Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee
Rights and Services; Guadalupe Berumen, an immi
grant from Mexico; Violeta Ortega, an immigrant
from Guatemala; and Thuy Bui, an immigrant from
Vietnam and a law student. Approximately 75 people
attended the discussion.
Passed by a solid majority in last year's California
election, Proposition 187 would prohibit illegal
immigrants from receiving such public goods as
schooling and medical care. Implementation has
been delayed, however, because of a number of con
stitutional and other legal challenges at both the
state and federal levels.
The panel discussed many pieces of legislation at
the national level that would adversely affect immi
grants â€” both legal and illegal.
"These bills are really trying to pass Proposition

187 at a federal level," said Avidan.
She attacked the legislation for using data that
depict immigrants as, for example, welfare abusers
who refuse to learn English.
"It is spurious data gathered by pseudo-academics
with their own political agenda," she said. "I am
starting to get angrier and angrier at the bigotry and
hatred people are proposing as solutions for econom
ic problems."
Berumen, a legal resident who immigrated from
Mexico over 20 years ago, said Proposition 187 and
the proposed federal legislation worry him.
"The Constitution is open for all of us," he said
through an interpreter. "The Constitution was
made for everyone, for all races that come to this
country."
Violeta Ortega, an immigrant from Guatemala,
came to the United States in 1970 planning to stay
with her sisters for only six months. But something
made her change her mind.
"I fell in love," she said, explaining that she got
married and stayed.
Ortega used herself as an example of an immi
grant who adds to the United States, saying that she
has been active as a volunteer at her children's
schools and in a number of other community organi
zations and has never been on welfare.
Bui pointed out that a great number of people
come to the United States out of necessity. Her fam
ily immigrated to the United States in 1978 as Viet
namese refugees.
"Contrary to popular anti-immigrant beliefs, not
everyone wants to come here, not everyone jumps to
come to the United States," she said.
