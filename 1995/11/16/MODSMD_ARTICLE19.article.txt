						brief history of one of college's oldest and most heated rivalries

The Big Game.
On Saturday, the Stanford
Cardinal and the California Gold
en Bears will add another chapter
to their storied cross-Bay rivalry
in the 98th Big Game. The Stan
ford-Cal series, begun in 1892, is
tied for 10th longest in NCAA
Division 1-A college football.
Stanford Stadium will be a fes
tive gala of cardinal and white
and blue and gold, as students
and alumni from both institu
tions converge to cheer for their
respective gridiron squad.
Lloyd McGovern (class of '47)
will be among the Big Game
crowd for the 63rd consecutive
year. McGovern, curator of the
Stanford Athletics Hall of Fame
and Stanford sports historian,
has attended every Big Game
since 1933.
That first Big Game experience
is one McGovern recalls well. He
witnessed the contest with an
uncle who was a Cal graduate and
sat among the blue and gold sup
porters. Stanford's "Vow Boys"
were victorious that day, claiming
a 7-3 win.
"When Stanford scored, you
could hear me for miles, while the
Cal fans told my uncle to 'Shut
that kid up,' " wrote McGovern in
an article titled "Memories of A
Big Game Rivalry."
Other games which were espe
cially memorable to McGovern
include 1940, when the "Wow
Boys," led by the legendary
Chuck Taylor, completed a per
fect season, narrowly defeating
the Golden Bears 13-7. Stanford
went on to beat Nebraska in the
Rose Bowl 21-13. In 1950, an

undefeated and heavily favored
Cal team was stunned by the Indi
ans, who fought to a 7-7 tie. Stan
ford narrowly missed victory
when a 70-yard pass from a punt
formation on the last play of the
game fell just out of reach.
In 1963, the Big Game was
postponed one week, as the Unit
ed States mourned the loss of
President John F. Kennedy. The
game was coach John Ralston's
first Big Game, and Stanford
emerged with a 28-17 triumph.
As for the 1974 contest,
McGovern wrote, "This game
could match any thriller you can
imagine."
Stanford entered the final
quarter of play ahead 19-10
before a touchdown pass from
Steve Bartkowski to Steve Rivera
gave Cal a 20-19 lead with 26 sec
onds remaining. Before the extra
point attempt, Berkeley fans
streamed onto the field in celebra
tion. When order was restored,
Stanford quarterback Guy Ben
jamin moved his squad into field
goal range with two quick pass
completions. Kicker Mike Lang
ford booted a 50-yard field goal to
give Stanford an incredible 22-20
victory.
Still, nothing compares to the
wacky finish of the 1982 Big
Game, which featured "The
Play."
In perhaps the wildest ending
in college football history, Stan
ford held a 20-19 lead with four
seconds on the clock before the
famous five-lateral miracle run
through the Stanford Band gave
Cal a 25-20 win. The Berkeley
Gazette's headline read "God is a
Golden Bear."
In 1990, history repeated itself

Both Stanford and Cal know what awaits them at the end of each season. Neither team will have its eyes set on anything but each other
and victory.
