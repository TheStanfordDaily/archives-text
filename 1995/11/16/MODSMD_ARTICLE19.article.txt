## Big Game tradition full of drama and excitement A 						brief history of one of college's oldest and most heated rivalries

The Big Game.
On Saturday, the Stanford
Cardinal and the California Gold
en Bears will add another chapter
to their storied cross-Bay rivalry
in the 98th Big Game. The Stan
ford-Cal series, begun in 1892, is
tied for 10th longest in NCAA
Division 1-A college football.
Stanford Stadium will be a fes
tive gala of cardinal and white
and blue and gold, as students
and alumni from both institu
tions converge to cheer for their
respective gridiron squad.
Lloyd McGovern (class of '47)
will be among the Big Game
crowd for the 63rd consecutive
year. McGovern, curator of the
Stanford Athletics Hall of Fame
and Stanford sports historian,
has attended every Big Game
since 1933.
That first Big Game experience
is one McGovern recalls well. He
witnessed the contest with an
uncle who was a Cal graduate and
sat among the blue and gold sup
porters. Stanford's "Vow Boys"
were victorious that day, claiming
a 7-3 win.
"When Stanford scored, you
could hear me for miles, while the
Cal fans told my uncle to 'Shut
that kid up,' " wrote McGovern in
an article titled "Memories of A
Big Game Rivalry."
Other games which were espe
cially memorable to McGovern
include 1940, when the "Wow
Boys," led by the legendary
Chuck Taylor, completed a per
fect season, narrowly defeating
the Golden Bears 13-7. Stanford
went on to beat Nebraska in the
Rose Bowl 21-13. In 1950, an

undefeated and heavily favored
Cal team was stunned by the Indi
ans, who fought to a 7-7 tie. Stan
ford narrowly missed victory
when a 70-yard pass from a punt
formation on the last play of the
game fell just out of reach.
In 1963, the Big Game was
postponed one week, as the Unit
ed States mourned the loss of
President John F. Kennedy. The
game was coach John Ralston's
first Big Game, and Stanford
emerged with a 28-17 triumph.
As for the 1974 contest,
McGovern wrote, "This game
could match any thriller you can
imagine."
Stanford entered the final
quarter of play ahead 19-10
before a touchdown pass from
Steve Bartkowski to Steve Rivera
gave Cal a 20-19 lead with 26 sec
onds remaining. Before the extra
point attempt, Berkeley fans
streamed onto the field in celebra
tion. When order was restored,
Stanford quarterback Guy Ben
jamin moved his squad into field
goal range with two quick pass
completions. Kicker Mike Lang
ford booted a 50-yard field goal to
give Stanford an incredible 22-20
victory.
Still, nothing compares to the
wacky finish of the 1982 Big
Game, which featured "The
Play."
In perhaps the wildest ending
in college football history, Stan
ford held a 20-19 lead with four
seconds on the clock before the
famous five-lateral miracle run
through the Stanford Band gave
Cal a 25-20 win. The Berkeley
Gazette's headline read "God is a
Golden Bear."
In 1990, history repeated itself

Both Stanford and Cal know what awaits them at the end of each season. Neither team will have its eyes set on anything but each other
and victory.
in a way, as the Bears lost under
circumstances eerily similar to
those of 1974. With 12 seconds
to play, the Cardinal closed to
within one point at 25-24 with a
touchdown. Stanford attempted
a two-point conversion, but the
pass was intercepted in the end
zone.
Just like 16 years before, Cal
fans swarmed the field. This
time, it cost Cal a delay of game
penalty. Stanford kicked from
the 50-yard line and recovered
the onside kick. Quarterback
Jason Palumbis then threw an
incomplete pass, but Cal was
penalized for roughing the pass
er, putting the ball on the 22-
yard line. Kicker John Hopkins
nailed a 37-yard field goal as
time ran out to lift Stanford to
victory, 27-25.
Another longtime Stanford
supporter who will be in the
crowd Saturday is Ed Macau lay,
the public address announcer at
Stanford home games from 1952
until 1991. Macaulay's final call
was the 1991 Big Game, in
which "Touchdown" Tommy
Vardell and the Stanford "Now
Boys" left a trash-talking Cal
team speechless in a 38-21 drub-

bing.
"That was a gratifying game,"
Macaulay said. "Cal was heavily
favored. They were a great team,
but they talked a lot of trash. It
was a super victory for the Stan
ford team."
Although he has seen count
less Stanford football games,
Macaulay said the Big Game is
something else.
"There is something very spe
cial about Big Game," Macaula>
said. "Homecoming games art
big, too, but nothing like Big
Game. This rivalry goes back
more than 100 years."
As an announcer, Macaulaj
always felt extra anxiety before
Stanford and Cal met on the
. field.
"There is a certain tenseness
before the game," he said. "You
almost feel like a player — there
is intensity and nervousness
before, but once you get going
you're fine. You can't help feel
ing like that if you have feelings
for the school."
On Saturday, Stanford will
look to reclaim the Axe, the infa
mous prize for Big Game tri
umphs. The Cardinal leads the
all-time series 47-39-11. McGov
ern and Macaulay will join thou
sands in the tradition of the
Game.
On Saturday, the tradition
will continue.
