# Sex harassment rules get positive feedback
## Reaction is sparse; Women's Center yet to comment 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Only a handful of people have responded to
a call for comments on drafted revisions to the
University's sexual harassment policy, offer
ing much praise scattered with a few criti
cisms.
Yesterday was the deadline for comments
set by Assistant to the President Jean Fetter,
chair of the 11-member ad hoc committee re
viewing the new policy.
Fetter said most of the responses she has
received are either positive or request clarifi
cation on specific points, such as the proposed
change to make parties found guilty of sexual
harassment responsible for reimbursing the
University's legal costs.
"I am reassured that.. . people are reason
ably happy with the proposed policy," Fetter
said in an interview yesterday.
Despite the overwhelmingly positive re
sponse received to date, members of the
Women's Center Advisory Board, who were
still preparing their formal comments yester
day, have suggested that the new policy does
not adequately address certain issues.
Rula Ruzak, an undergraduate member of

the board, said the board
believes the policy does not
adequately address the pre
vention of sexual harass
ment and insufficiently
stresses the importance of
educating resident assis
tants and other "unofficial
advisers" likely to be con
tacted before staff and ad
ministrators in a case of

possible harassment. The
policy also does not provide for sufficient co
ordination between sexual harassment and
sexual assault policies on the organizational
levels, she charged.
Nonetheless, after meeting yesterday with
the Faculty Senate Steering Committee —
which sets the agenda for Faculty Senate
meetings — Fetter reported that "they were
very pleased to see [ the {K)licy | shortened and,
according to their interpretations, simpli
fied."
The revised policy is "clear, direct, unam
biguous and reassuring," Fetter added.
