# Sex harassment rules get positive feedback
## Reaction is sparse; Women's Center yet to comment 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Only a handful of people have responded to
a call for comments on drafted revisions to the
University's sexual harassment policy, offer
ing much praise scattered with a few criti
cisms.
Yesterday was the deadline for comments
set by Assistant to the President Jean Fetter,
chair of the 11-member ad hoc committee re
viewing the new policy.
Fetter said most of the responses she has
received are either positive or request clarifi
cation on specific points, such as the proposed
change to make parties found guilty of sexual
harassment responsible for reimbursing the
University's legal costs.
"I am reassured that.. . people are reason
ably happy with the proposed policy," Fetter
said in an interview yesterday.
Despite the overwhelmingly positive re
sponse received to date, members of the
Women's Center Advisory Board, who were
still preparing their formal comments yester
day, have suggested that the new policy does
not adequately address certain issues.
Rula Ruzak, an undergraduate member of

the board, said the board
believes the policy does not
adequately address the pre
vention of sexual harass
ment and insufficiently
stresses the importance of
educating resident assis
tants and other "unofficial
advisers" likely to be con
tacted before staff and ad
ministrators in a case of

possible harassment. The
policy also does not provide for sufficient co
ordination between sexual harassment and
sexual assault policies on the organizational
levels, she charged.
Nonetheless, after meeting yesterday with
the Faculty Senate Steering Committee —
which sets the agenda for Faculty Senate
meetings — Fetter reported that "they were
very pleased to see [ the {K)licy | shortened and,
according to their interpretations, simpli
fied."
The revised policy is "clear, direct, unam
biguous and reassuring," Fetter added.
One of the major differences between this


Fetter
and the original 1993 draft is the
way the University deals with
confidentiality. Though the exist
ing policy works to protect confi
dentiality hy not permitting
records to be kept without the
express consent of the accuser,
the new policy — while maintain
ing the anonymity of those
involved — would permit the Uni
versity to keep records for statisti
cal purposes.
According to Alejandro Mar
tinez, director of Counseling and
Psychological Services, the new
policy addresses the issue of con
fidentiality more clearlv and

honestly.
"Disclosure is becoming a criti
cal issue," Martinez said. "It is
important for students to know
and understand their options
before taking action in response to
sexual harassment. [The new poli
cy] puts more responsibility on
individual behavior and account
ability, not just institutions" and
administrative responses, he
added.
David Rasch, director of the
Stanford Help Center, which pro
vides counseling to faculty and
staff, also expressed support for the
new policy, saying that "it is much
clearer, a step in the right direc
tion."
Three ASSU senators recently
met with Fetter to discuss the new
policy's finer points. Graduate sen

ator Jessica Koran, who was at the
meeting, said she was "really
impressed with the whole policy. It
sets out a lot of ways to protect
both sides and make the system
fair."
Undergraduate senator Armen
Panossian, who also attended the
meeting, offered praise for the Uni
versity's serious commitment and
openness to student concerns. "We
believe that the draft is in good
form," he said.
Fetter's committee will meet
Tuesday to discuss possibilities for
further revision. By the end of this
month, they will present a draft to
the Faculty Senate for discussion
and debate, after which it will move
to University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice for approval.
