point scorers and leaders like Brian Retterer,
Kurt Grote, Dan Kanner and Clay Tippins to

NCAA championship in five years.

training camp in Colorado, and the next major
step is the Pacific 10 Conference championship
meet over Thanksgiving weekend. Then, the dual
meet season picks up after winter break. Finally,

last destination of the Cardinal's season-long
preparation.

year because the Olympic trials commence in
March, when the Pac-lOs are usually held. The
