# No rebuilding necessary for swimmers
## Maximizing potential is key to Cardinal success this season 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
After the Stanford men's swimming team lost
point scorers and leaders like Brian Retterer,
Kurt Grote, Dan Kanner and Clay Tippins to
graduation, it appeared that the 1995-96 season
might serve as a rebuilding year. However, as evi
denced by an impressive showing last weekend
against California and Nebraska as well as the
emergence of some young stars, the Cardinal is
poised to make a competitive run at its fourth
NCAA championship in five years.
"It could have been seen as a rebuilding year,
[since we] lost a good number of point scorers last
year," said senior Scott Gagner. "But last week
end, we proved we have a strong team which is
waiting to come out."
The long season, which began before school
started, has many important steps, all leading to
the ultimate goal of winning the NCAA champi
onship.
It all began in September with a two-week
training camp in Colorado, and the next major
step is the Pacific 10 Conference championship
meet over Thanksgiving weekend. Then, the dual
meet season picks up after winter break. Finally,
in March come the national championships — the
last destination of the Cardinal's season-long
preparation.
The upcoming Pac-10 championships will
assess the Cardinal's potential. Usually swam in
the spring, the Pac-lOs take place in the fall this
year because the Olympic trials commence in
March, when the Pac-lOs are usually held. The

early placement of the meet has
both positive and negative conse
quences. While the change does
not give freshmen much of a
chance to get used to college
swimming, it does clear the rest of
the season for those who will not
participate in the Olympic trials
to focus solely on the NCAAs.
"I don't think it's the ideal sit
uation," said senior co-captain
Eric Diehl. "But now that we're
into the season, it doesn't seem
like a big deal. The freshmen real
ly stepped up last weekend, and
now they're inspiring the older
guys. I think a lot of the excite
ment for Pac-lOs is coming from
the freshmen."
The strong performances of
freshmen Matt O'Mara, Tate
Blahnik, Dod Wales, Blake Hold
en and Dan Schultz in the first

two dual meets of the season
demonstrated that they do not
need to do any adjusting to be pre
pared to swim at the NCAA level.
"I'm really encouraged by how
well they've adapted," Gagner
said. "My freshman year, I don't
know if I'd have been as prepared
as they seem to be. That's to their
credit. Given the way they swam
last weekend, we're looking for
them to really step up."
As for the Olympic trials, the
Cardinal does not believe that the
trials will add an unwanted dis
traction. Because the trials will
take place at the same time that
the Pac-lOs are usually held, they
will not upset the normal training
pattern for the veterans who will
participate.
"We have several individuals
training for the Olympic trials,"
Diehl said. "Hut because it is so
exciting, if anything, it will
enhance their work ethic."
According to some swimmers,
the trials will allow the Cardinal

to come together as a team.
"The focus is on swimming
fast," Gagner said, "whether it's
Pac-lOs or the Olympic trials.
Either way, we have a good group
of guys going to the trials. It will
feel like a Stanford meet. There
will be so much emotion that, if
anything, it is an encouragement.
It is an inspiration to the people
who aren't there but hope to be
there in a few years, and it will be
an inspiration for the guys who
are there to see their good buddies
make the Olympic team."
Physically, the trials will help
both the young and the experi
enced. For the veterans, the
Olympic trials provide extra
incentive to train harder.
"For the '92 team," Gagner
said, "training went so well we
pretty much dominated NCAAs."
For those who will not try out,
the absence of the Pac-lOs in
March will remove the need to
compete back-to-back in Pac-lOs
and NCAAs.

The Cardinal expects several
athletes to play important roles
throughout the season. Junior
Kevin Radvany is an ever-improv
ing distance swimmer who will
provide some extra points in an
area where the Cardinal has not
performed well recently. The
return of Ray Carey, who was
injured last year, will add big
points in the butterfly, an event
which will also benefit from
sophomore sprint star Sabir
Muhammad. Stanford is also
looking for juniors like Scott
Jones to continue improving and
contribute significantly to the
team.
"We're going to be looking for
good leadership out of the veter
ans — people like Kevin Radvany,
Ray Carey, Scott Claypool, Sabir
Muhammad, Tom Wilkens — the
guys who have been to NCAAs,"
Gagner said. "They'll lead by
example."
The Cardinal will also rely on
its all-around depth to keep it in

the hunt for the national title.
"Our biggest strength is really
that we have no weaknesses,"
Diehl said. With solid swimmers
in most areas of competition,
Stanford hopes to score points in
all events. Furthermore, senior
David Johns, who participated in
NCAAs last year, should provide
important points in the diving
competition.
"We have a good fly group with
Ray and Sabir," Gagner said. "We
have some good sprinters with
Scott Claypool and Sabir. We have
a great core of 200 (meter) guys
with Scott Jones and Dod Wales.
Our distance group is coming
along well with Radvany and the
addition of Matt O'Mara. The
backstroke group is helped out by
Tate. To be honest, you look
across the board and we're pretty
solid all around."
The final question, then, is
whether this all-around team can
win the NCAA championships. To
do so, every swimmer must train

hard to maximize his potential.
"Everybody believes we can
win," Diehl said. "Make no mis
take. To win NCAAs, we all have
to swim really well. No freshman
can swim like a freshman. We
need them to just swim up to
their potential. If everybody does
that, we can win."
There can be no difference
from the most seasoned veterans
to the greenest rookies. Each
member of the team expects every
other member to train hard to
win.
"In the past, when Tyler May
field and Derek Weatherford were
seniors," Gagner said, "there was
a sort of a rift because those guys
were big point-scoring veterans
and we had a group of freshmen
that came in that almost didn't
get the attention they'd have oth
erwise deserved. But having dif
ferent expectations puts some
body on a lower plain, which is
not how this team operates. We
all train for excellence."
