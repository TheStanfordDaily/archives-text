# Crew ready to give Cal big hurt at Big Row
## 
### Laura Drum Contributing writer 
This weekend promises a
plethora of sporting events for
the Stanford sports fan. Often,
the Big Game overshadows many
of the other competitions the
weekend has to offer, but as the
excitement of Saturday's Big
Game dies down, the Stanford
men's and women's crew teams
will face California on Sunday
and rekindle the flames of the
heated cross-Bay rivalry.
Men's crew coxswain Eva Kim
was quick to remind fans that
pigskin won't be the only game in
town, not with the San Mateo
Race versus the Golden Bears on
the horizon. "You can equate it
to the Big Game," she said. "It's
the Big Row."
Kim's utatement describes the
significance of Sunday's San
Mateo regatta, which will be the
team's fall season finale.
The race will take place in San
Mateo, the closest site the team
can call home. The course
stretches three and a half miles
and lasts approximately 17 min

utes. While the water is calm, it
consists of several sharp curves
and narrow areas, including a
narrow bridge after the first
mile. These obstacles require the
coxswains to remain particularly
alert. "[The course] winds
through a residential area,
snaking through all these hous
es," Kim said. "It's pretty windy
and narrow as well."

'We want to see what
we can really do in
this race. There's no
excuses. We're using
our best.'

Cal won't be the only other
team racing against Stanford,
but as in the Big Game, the Bears
will be the Cardinal's main
nemesis. Other teams which will
compete include the University

of Victoria, UC-Irvine, UC-Davis
and most other California
schools.
The men's and women's teams
will each send two eight-boats of
experienced rowers, as well as
novice boats. The men will field
one four-rower boat as well. The
novice teams will race for the
first time and expect to provide
Cal with some competition.
The race marks the men's
third encounter with Cal. In the
first two contests, the Cardinal
improved its performance against
the Bears, narrowing the time
gap between the two schools.
Stanford hopes to close the gap
further in the San Mateo race.
"We definitely have the ability
[to beat Call," said men's coach
Wieslaw Kujda. "We came close
in our last encounter."
The men view the regatta as
the most critical of the fall sea
son. Their performance at San
Mateo will set the tone as they
enter the more crucial spring
season. "We want to see what we
can really do in this race," Kujda
said. "There's no excuses. We're
using our best."

While the Cardinal faced diffi
culties in concentration and
drive in the past, it definitely
remains capable of posting a
remarkable outing.
"Concentration and determi
nation — those two factors are
going to have to be there, and
they have to keep rhythm with
the water," Kujda said.
The women's team faces a
similar challenge. Last year, all
the women's boats beat all the
Cal boats in San Mateo. This sea
son, the Cardinal has geared
everything for the upcoming race
and hopes to conclude the season
with a flourish.
"Races like this are ones we
have a really good shot at win
ning, so that's what we're aiming
for," said women's coxswain
Katherine Bostick.
The women expect a strong
performance from themselves
and hope to enter the spring sea
son with a winning attitude.
"We have yet to see our best,
and I would like to see it in this
race," said women's coach Aimee
Baker. "It's a big week and a big
race."
