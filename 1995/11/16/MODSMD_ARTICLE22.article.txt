# Wrestlers look to take down Davis

### Karim Fakhry 
If the Stanford wrestling
team had a motto, it would
undoubtedly be, "This is our
year." Everyone involved with
the team, from coaches to play
ers to supporters, abounds with
an irrepressible confidence.
Tomorrow night at 7 p.m.,
this enthusiastic team will face
its first test against UC-Davis
at Burnham Pavilion. This
meet traditionally takes place
on the evening before Big
Game.
When asked about season
prospects, head coach Chris
Horpel never fails to stress his
"Year Four" philosophy. Accord
ing to Horpel, the 1995-96 cam
paign represents year four in a
four-year cycle.
"Wrestling is a sport of expe
rience," he said. "You become
more competitive with experi
ence, knowledge and tech
nique."
The Cardinal is under the
leadership of juniors and
seniors who have spent several
years preparing for this season.
Finished with their years of
nurturing and gaining experi
ence, the upperclassmen are
now ready to attain their team
goals of placing in the top four
in the Pacific 10 Conference
and finishing in the top 20
nationally. They are also ready
to realize their personal goals
of becoming NCAA champions.
"We have a large and experi
enced team that includes 11
returning Pac-10 place winners

and three returning NCAA
qualifiers," Horpel said. "Those
kinds of numbers make my
expectations pretty high.
"This is our year."
In all likelihood, the team
must produce at least one All-
American if it is to achieve its
goals. (A wrestler needs to place
in the top eight at the NCAA
tournament in order to earn
Ail-American honors.) The two
strongest candidates for the
distinction are senior co-cap
tains Jimmy Aguirre and Tod
Surmon, competing at the 134-
pound and 150-pound slots,
respectively.
Surmon is ranked seventh in
his weight division and has
already made two appearances
in the NCAA tournament. This
is his final year, and he wants
desperately to become an All-
American. "The key to my suc
cess is going to be to stay
healthy and peak at the right
time," he said. "In the past, I've
gotten sick and hurt, and that's
slowed me down."
Aguirre faces the same situ
ation. He has captured two
Pac-10 titles and has defeated
several All-Americans. The key
for him is to win close matches
and stay healthy. "I don't want
to put any limits on anything,"
Aguirre said. "I think I can do
as well as anyone. I plan on
going into every match with the
attitude that I will win."
Another possible All-Ameri
can is senior Matt Cano (126
