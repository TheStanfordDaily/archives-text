j ) ast Palo Alto. lb describe it in a Pic
C tionary game, the player might draw a
. J drug dealer, or a gunman or a run
down building. It's free association at its
worst, but it seems to correspond to the gen
eral public's view of what the city is like.
Think leggy models for Paris, poor children
for East Palo Alto.
The Committee on Black Performing Arts
is trying to challenge these (mis)perceptions.
And if students won't come to East Palo Alto
to learn the truth, then East Palo Alto will
come to them. Thank the magic of theater,
for the city has taken wings and landed at the
Nitery, where it has been speaking to the
Stanford community since yesterday in the
form of two one-act plays. They are "Circle in
the Dirt" and "Dancing on the Brink." The
two shows run through Sunday, Nov. 19.
"Dancing on the Brink" begins with a
dream, as the Muwekma chief of the Ohlone
tribe tells the gathered about a powerful vi
sion of the future. The year is 1769, and in the
dream, the village is invaded by "horrible
ghosts of the unborn," and a sense of im
pending doom is established.
The play moves back and forth between
the past and the present, stopping at signifi
cant historical moments. It focuses on the
people who come to the land and those who
work it. One scene shows the arrival of Chi
nese immigrants in California while another
centers on a group of migrant workers seek
ing work. One scene features African slaves at
the time of the trade, and another shows a
white couple selling a house when blacks
move into their neighborhood.
These are the Muwekma chief's "visions,"
with each scene representing a different vision.
All the scenes (the play features about 50 differ
ent characters) add up to a comprehensive view
of East Palo Alto's history. The c ity comes off as
possessing great cultural diversity and histori
cal richness — nothing like its stereotype.
That, by the way, was the goal of the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts when it com
missioned the plays: to use theater as a vehicle
for telling "just the story" of East Palo Alto.

Both plays are the product of extensive re
search. Before playwright Charles "Oyamo"
Gordon started writing "Dancing on the
Brink," he spent many hours hunched over
historical archives and reviewing papers and
articles written about the area.
Cherrie Moraga, author of the other play,
"Circle in the Dirt," met with a number of
community residents and viewed over 40
hours of videotaped interviews, all so she
could tell their story right.
"The things that people say are so pro
found," said Moraga, who sees this work as a
vehicle toward community empowerment.
"It was a privilege to have access to people's
lives. My goal was to create a composite out
of the jewels those people said."
In the end, the two plays are as much
about theater as they are about community
service and journalism.
"The major thrust of the project is that it's
a collaboration with the community," said
Drama Professor Harry I.lam. "The plays are
not essentially about entertainment at all. The
plays are much more. They're about finding a
way to open a dialogue with the community."

One way to achieve this is through the dis
cussions held immediately after the perfor
mance of the plays. Members of each com
munity (Stanford and East Palo Alto) facili
tate an exploration of the issues raised by the
plays. What the people behind this project arc
hoping for is that these plays will lead to more
interaction between Stanford and East Palo
Alto.
"Hopefully, we'll get people to talk and
think about Stanford's relationship with Palo
Alto," Elam said. Elam, who directed "Danc
ing on the Brink," is also the director of the
Committee on Black Performing Arts.
"Stanford is the home of Yahoo and stu
dents can be connected and know how a
human being half way across the world feels,
but they might have no connection to this very
poor neighbor that's just an avenue away," said
"Circle in the Dirt" director Roberto Gutier
rez-Varea. "It's a real paradox."
"Take pride in the land," says a Pacific-Is
lander immigrant in "Dancingon the Brink."
Land is a big concern in this play. People
fight for it and worry about it. Land is an es
sential part of the American Dream, and

most of the characters in the play are search
ing for some, even if they have to suffer ex
ploitation and victimization.
In one scene, two illegal immigrants try
ing to get into the United States attempt to
survive hunger, dehydration and lack of oxy
gen, until one of them finally dies.
In another scene, a young Mexican-Amer
ican talks of the Mexicans who never left the
land and who were there in the '40s, when the
city received its name. "And yet, we're treated
like aliens," he protests. Later we hear, "But
there's a storm in the horizon that could blow
us straight to hell."
How could it not? The play traces a pat
tern of struggle and discrimination, racism
and violence. A concern over the land and
the role of community both play key roles in
the other one-act, "Circle in the Dirt."
In "Circle in the Dirt," the residents of an
apartment project set to be torn down come
together to share how they feel about living
in East Palo Alto. The group is diverse in gen
der, age and race, and all are based on actual
East Palo Alto residents.
"The play doesn't sugarcoat their reality.
They're disenfranchised, poor and have to face
a lot of racism," said Gutierrez-Varea. "But
Cherrie has really been able to show the human
dignity that speaks through these people."
The play shows that while it's tough to live
in East Palo Alto, there is much to be proud
of given the circumstances.
"East Palo Alto emerges as a real multi
faceted, complex character," said Gutierrez-
Varea. "Like any complex being, it's a combi
nation of positive and difficult, but the posi
tive shines."

"Circle in the Dirt."

in East Palo Alto. The group is diverse in gen
der, age and race, and all are based on actual
East Palo Alto residents.
"The play doesn't sugarcoat their reality.
They're disenfranchised, poor and have to face
a lot of racism," said Gutierrez-Varea. "But
Cherrie has really been able to show the human
dignity that speaks through these people."
The play shows that while it's tough to live
in East Palo Alto, there is much to be proud
of given the circumstances.
"East Palo Alto emerges as a real multi
faceted, complex character," said Gutierrez-
Varea. "Like any complex being, it's a combi
nation of positive and difficult, but the posi
tive shines."

WHAT: "Dancing on the Brink" and
"Circle in the Dirt."
WHEN: Through Saturday, Nov, 18 Q
8 p.m., and Sunday, Nov. 19 @ 2 p.m.
WHERE: The Nitery (Old Union)
HOW MUCH: $5 students & seniors, $8
faculty & staff and $10 general public, at

C tionary game, the player might draw a

down building. It's free association at its
worst, but it seems to correspond to the gen
eral public's view of what the city is like.
Think leggy models for Paris, poor children
for East Palo Alto.
The Committee on Black Performing Arts
is trying to challenge these (mis)perceptions.
And if students won't come to East Palo Alto
to learn the truth, then East Palo Alto will
come to them. Thank the magic of theater,
for the city has taken wings and landed at the
Nitery, where it has been speaking to the
Stanford community since yesterday in the
form of two one-act plays. They are "Circle in
the Dirt" and "Dancing on the Brink." The
two shows run through Sunday, Nov. 19.
"Dancing on the Brink" begins with a
dream, as the Muwekma chief of the Ohlone
tribe tells the gathered about a powerful vi
sion of the future. The year is 1769, and in the
dream, the village is invaded by "horrible
ghosts of the unborn," and a sense of im
pending doom is established.
The play moves back and forth between
the past and the present, stopping at signifi
cant historical moments. It focuses on the
people who come to the land and those who
work it. One scene shows the arrival of Chi
nese immigrants in California while another
centers on a group of migrant workers seek
ing work. One scene features African slaves at
the time of the trade, and another shows a
white couple selling a house when blacks
move into their neighborhood.
These are the Muwekma chief's "visions,"
with each scene representing a different vision.
All the scenes (the play features about 50 differ
ent characters) add up to a comprehensive view
of East Palo Alto's history. The c ity comes off as
possessing great cultural diversity and histori
cal richness — nothing like its stereotype.
That, by the way, was the goal of the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts when it com
missioned the plays: to use theater as a vehicle
for telling "just the story" of East Palo Alto.

Both plays are the product of extensive re
search. Before playwright Charles "Oyamo"
Gordon started writing "Dancing on the
Brink," he spent many hours hunched over
historical archives and reviewing papers and
articles written about the area.
Cherrie Moraga, author of the other play,
"Circle in the Dirt," met with a number of
community residents and viewed over 40
hours of videotaped interviews, all so she
could tell their story right.
"The things that people say are so pro
found," said Moraga, who sees this work as a
vehicle toward community empowerment.
"It was a privilege to have access to people's
lives. My goal was to create a composite out
of the jewels those people said."
In the end, the two plays are as much
about theater as they are about community
service and journalism.
"The major thrust of the project is that it's
a collaboration with the community," said
Drama Professor Harry I.lam. "The plays are
not essentially about entertainment at all. The
plays are much more. They're about finding a
way to open a dialogue with the community."

One way to achieve this is through the dis
cussions held immediately after the perfor
mance of the plays. Members of each com
munity (Stanford and East Palo Alto) facili
tate an exploration of the issues raised by the
plays. What the people behind this project arc
hoping for is that these plays will lead to more
interaction between Stanford and East Palo
Alto.
"Hopefully, we'll get people to talk and
think about Stanford's relationship with Palo
Alto," Elam said. Elam, who directed "Danc
ing on the Brink," is also the director of the
Committee on Black Performing Arts.
"Stanford is the home of Yahoo and stu
dents can be connected and know how a
human being half way across the world feels,
but they might have no connection to this very
poor neighbor that's just an avenue away," said
"Circle in the Dirt" director Roberto Gutier
rez-Varea. "It's a real paradox."
"Take pride in the land," says a Pacific-Is
lander immigrant in "Dancingon the Brink."
Land is a big concern in this play. People
fight for it and worry about it. Land is an es
sential part of the American Dream, and

most of the characters in the play are search
ing for some, even if they have to suffer ex
ploitation and victimization.
In one scene, two illegal immigrants try
ing to get into the United States attempt to
survive hunger, dehydration and lack of oxy
gen, until one of them finally dies.
In another scene, a young Mexican-Amer
ican talks of the Mexicans who never left the
land and who were there in the '40s, when the
city received its name. "And yet, we're treated
like aliens," he protests. Later we hear, "But
there's a storm in the horizon that could blow
us straight to hell."
How could it not? The play traces a pat
tern of struggle and discrimination, racism
and violence. A concern over the land and
the role of community both play key roles in
the other one-act, "Circle in the Dirt."
In "Circle in the Dirt," the residents of an
apartment project set to be torn down come
together to share how they feel about living
in East Palo Alto. The group is diverse in gen
der, age and race, and all are based on actual
