# The 						distant charm of Stephin Merritt
## 
### Arnold Pan 
Distance separates the unique songwrit
ing gifts of Stephin Merritt. Aesthetic
distance, emotional distance, traveled
distances — these qualities and subjects de
tine the music of his numerous yet unvaried
projects, the Magnetic Fields, the bths and
Future Bible Heroes.
Go no further than the titles of the Mag
netic Fields' LPs — 1989's "Distant Plastic
Irees," 1991's "The Wayward Bus," 1993's
1 he Charm of the Highway Strip" and the
latest release "Get Lost" — and the theme be
comes obvious. The delicate tales told in Mer
ritt .s songs expound on the broad headings.
More often than not, they are stories of alien
ation and ruined expectation, but also of the
self-enlightenment that comes with fatigued
despair. In particular, "The Charm of the
1 lighway Strip" works like a travel log of the
hapless, hopeless straggler who finds solace in
his journeys down "lonely highways" and
"long Vermont roads." His friends are imagi
nary — "You were Jesse James /1 was William
Tell / You were Daniel Webster/I was the
devil himself / Two characters in search of a
country song/Just make believe but so in
love, Merritt croons with twang on "Two
Characters in Search of a Country Song."
The music matches the narrative, where
expression seems as far away as the remote
wanderings in verse. Different but the same,
Merritt's lush, pretty orchestrations rely 011
glimmering synthesizers and syncopated
drum-machine-driven rhythms, infusing a
sense of anonymity and steely melody that's a
given in his material. And considering that a
goodly amount of Merritt's lyrics are deliv
ered from without, the impersonal nature of
the compositions is inescapable: the 6ths is a
project featuring countless indie-pop faves
on vox (Lou Barlow, Helium's MaryTimony,
Luna's Dean Wareham, among others) and
the first two Magnetic Fields full-lengths
have Susan Anway as vocalist. The only con
stant — and requirement Merritt asks of his
singers — is that the interpreter sounds as
bored and emotionally removed as Merritt's
own deep, droning voice does.
"Candy," a cut from"The Wayward Bus,"
exemplifies the spiral of confusingly de
tached relations. The calculus of identity in
the tune is mind-bogglingly complicated: a
woman croons coolly the words of a gay au
thor, who conjures an account of a jilted
male lover leaving his female companion.
Disjointedly enough, Anway sings in a flat
manner that she's not the man they want
her to be, and that "maybe it was only with
you that I could be me." He / she "can't
keep lying all the time," but where's the
truth in the piece anyway? And who's "I," if
that matters?
In song, it doesn't. "Candy," like much of
Merritt's catalog, thrives on meaning mud
dled by distance. The impersonal becomes
the universal; the accusations and doubts are
the same whoever expresses them, so vivid
and strong in (spite of) its lack of palpable
identity. The downcast, two-minute-plus
ditty takes the formula of the lovey-dovey
pop song and then transcends its conven
tions; Anway, Merritt, the listener are one
part Candy, one part Candy's opposite.

Indeed,
some of Mer
ritt's best are

his most ambiguous. "Josephine" pulls the
gender switch too with Anway taking the role
of Napoleon to the track's namesake: "If 1
were Napoleon / You could be my turtle-dove
— Living out in Corsica / In our summer cot
tages / And you could be my Josephine / And
we could be Siamese twins," she emotes dryly.
On "When You Were My Baby," Anway and
Merritt create a restrained melodrama, the
vocals pining over a soured relationship and
its lingering memories. Yet, the tune never
stoops as low as its hackneyed plot and stays
oh-so-above it all because it never gets partic
ular, stressing the first-person plural in spite
of the singular point-of-view.
Merritt's opus "100,000 Fireflies" from
"Distant Plastic Trees" extends the play of
subject-object affectingly, where "I" is insep
arable from "we." Her voice submitting to ex
haustion and submission, Anway tries to
convince herself and her spurned partner to
try again: "You won't be happy with me / But
give me one more chance — You won't be
happy anvwav," she reasons deludedly in a

plain, tired monotone. As much as its won
derful imagery and lucent poetry, distance
makes "100,000 Fireflies" as brilliant as it is.
lust compare Superchunk's well-meaning
cover of it and the completeness of form and
content in the original seems even more so.
Out of tune and out of control, Mac Mc-
Caughan breaks the tenuous balance the
Magnetic Fields so thrillingly create, shriek
ing when the song means soft things. Up too
close, the picture loses the focus gained by
backing off and giving up.
The Magnetic Fields' latest, "Get Lost," is a
new variation on the theme, more immediate
at times and as ever distant at others. "With
Whom to Dance" and "Love Is Lighter than
Air" are sparse, acoustic-like numbers and as
close as Merritt gets to his introspective indie
counterparts. On "The Desperate Things
You Made Me Do," Merritt almost jumps out
of character, with its seemingly specified sub
ject directly addressing a specified object in
the chorus of "I dedicate this song to you."
Yet nothing about Merritt's material is
clear-cut, and the opener, "Famous," mucks
things up from the get-go, generalizing the
experience of success and anxiety that's valid

in any ease but explicit to rock and roll in
context. The sense of unifying ambiguity
rises as Merritt's groggy, throaty baritone
[ strains to observe smugly, "You are the queen
I /Of every scene / You are the king /Of
Everything." And just when Merritt seems
weary of his elusiveness, he darts away, dis
consolate in New York-Tokyo-London on
the depressingly triumphant "All the Um
i brellas in London" and chasing the past and
r the heavens as he cruises the Autobahn on
"The Dreaming Moon."
i So while Merritt strays from his audience,
he always leaves a trail — though crooked
i and winding it may be —to follow. In the
end, how close / how far isn't the point be
cause Stephin Merritt connects the dots.

oh-so-above it all because it never gets partic
ular, stressing the first-person plural in spite
of the singular point-of-view.
Merritt's opus "100,000 Fireflies" from
"Distant Plastic Trees" extends the play of
subject-object affectingly, where "I" is insep
arable from "we." Her voice submitting to ex
haustion and submission, Anway tries to
convince herself and her spurned partner to
try again: "You won't be happy with me / But
give me one more chance — You won't be
happy anvwav," she reasons deludedly in a

plain, tired monotone. As much as its won
derful imagery and lucent poetry, distance
makes "100,000 Fireflies" as brilliant as it is.
lust compare Superchunk's well-meaning
cover of it and the completeness of form and
content in the original seems even more so.
Out of tune and out of control, Mac Mc-
Caughan breaks the tenuous balance the
Magnetic Fields so thrillingly create, shriek
ing when the song means soft things. Up too
close, the picture loses the focus gained by
backing off and giving up.
The Magnetic Fields' latest, "Get Lost," is a
new variation on the theme, more immediate
at times and as ever distant at others. "With
Whom to Dance" and "Love Is Lighter than
Air" are sparse, acoustic-like numbers and as
close as Merritt gets to his introspective indie
counterparts. On "The Desperate Things
You Made Me Do," Merritt almost jumps out
of character, with its seemingly specified sub
ject directly addressing a specified object in
the chorus of "I dedicate this song to you."
Yet nothing about Merritt's material is
clear-cut, and the opener, "Famous," mucks
things up from the get-go, generalizing the
experience of success and anxiety that's valid

in any ease but explicit to rock and roll in
context. The sense of unifying ambiguity
rises as Merritt's groggy, throaty baritone
[ strains to observe smugly, "You are the queen
I /Of every scene / You are the king /Of
Everything." And just when Merritt seems
weary of his elusiveness, he darts away, dis
consolate in New York-Tokyo-London on
the depressingly triumphant "All the Um
i brellas in London" and chasing the past and
r the heavens as he cruises the Autobahn on
"The Dreaming Moon."
i So while Merritt strays from his audience,
he always leaves a trail — though crooked
i and winding it may be —to follow. In the
end, how close / how far isn't the point be
cause Stephin Merritt connects the dots.

Distance separates the unique songwrit
ing gifts of Stephin Merritt. Aesthetic
distance, emotional distance, traveled
distances — these qualities and subjects de
tine the music of his numerous yet unvaried
projects, the Magnetic Fields, the bths and
Future Bible Heroes.
Go no further than the titles of the Mag
netic Fields' LPs — 1989's "Distant Plastic
Irees," 1991's "The Wayward Bus," 1993's
1 he Charm of the Highway Strip" and the
latest release "Get Lost" — and the theme be
comes obvious. The delicate tales told in Mer
ritt .s songs expound on the broad headings.
More often than not, they are stories of alien
ation and ruined expectation, but also of the
self-enlightenment that comes with fatigued
despair. In particular, "The Charm of the
1 lighway Strip" works like a travel log of the
hapless, hopeless straggler who finds solace in
his journeys down "lonely highways" and
"long Vermont roads." His friends are imagi
nary — "You were Jesse James /1 was William
Tell / You were Daniel Webster/I was the
devil himself / Two characters in search of a
country song/Just make believe but so in
love, Merritt croons with twang on "Two
Characters in Search of a Country Song."
The music matches the narrative, where
expression seems as far away as the remote
wanderings in verse. Different but the same,
Merritt's lush, pretty orchestrations rely 011
glimmering synthesizers and syncopated
drum-machine-driven rhythms, infusing a
sense of anonymity and steely melody that's a
given in his material. And considering that a
goodly amount of Merritt's lyrics are deliv
ered from without, the impersonal nature of
the compositions is inescapable: the 6ths is a
project featuring countless indie-pop faves
on vox (Lou Barlow, Helium's MaryTimony,
Luna's Dean Wareham, among others) and
the first two Magnetic Fields full-lengths
have Susan Anway as vocalist. The only con
stant — and requirement Merritt asks of his
singers — is that the interpreter sounds as
bored and emotionally removed as Merritt's
own deep, droning voice does.
"Candy," a cut from"The Wayward Bus,"
exemplifies the spiral of confusingly de
tached relations. The calculus of identity in
the tune is mind-bogglingly complicated: a
woman croons coolly the words of a gay au
thor, who conjures an account of a jilted
male lover leaving his female companion.
Disjointedly enough, Anway sings in a flat
manner that she's not the man they want
her to be, and that "maybe it was only with
you that I could be me." He / she "can't
keep lying all the time," but where's the
truth in the piece anyway? And who's "I," if
that matters?
In song, it doesn't. "Candy," like much of
Merritt's catalog, thrives on meaning mud
dled by distance. The impersonal becomes
the universal; the accusations and doubts are
the same whoever expresses them, so vivid
and strong in (spite of) its lack of palpable
identity. The downcast, two-minute-plus
ditty takes the formula of the lovey-dovey
pop song and then transcends its conven
tions; Anway, Merritt, the listener are one
part Candy, one part Candy's opposite.

Indeed,
some of Mer
ritt's best are

his most ambiguous. "Josephine" pulls the
gender switch too with Anway taking the role
of Napoleon to the track's namesake: "If 1
were Napoleon / You could be my turtle-dove
— Living out in Corsica / In our summer cot
tages / And you could be my Josephine / And
we could be Siamese twins," she emotes dryly.
On "When You Were My Baby," Anway and
Merritt create a restrained melodrama, the
vocals pining over a soured relationship and
its lingering memories. Yet, the tune never
stoops as low as its hackneyed plot and stays
oh-so-above it all because it never gets partic
ular, stressing the first-person plural in spite
