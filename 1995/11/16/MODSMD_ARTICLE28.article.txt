# Focus on: Little India
## A
						vast amount of healthy Indian food 
### Brady Nichoison 
Tucked away on Broadway in Redwood
City, Little India advertises itself as the source
of "family-style" Indian food on the Peninsu
la. The term "family-style" conjures up child
hood memories where Dad's choice of a
restaurant was determined by the poundage,
not the quality, of servings, and if you were in
a place that didn't have menus, you knew you
were in good hands. In this respect, Little
India does itself proud since family-style in
this case should be translated: "buffet."
The menu on the buffet changes daily, but
owners Manoj and Sunita Chopra always at
tempt to provide an array of Indian dishes —
all of which are prepared with the health
conscious in mind. Chef Chopra avoids
cooking in oils, preferring to bake rather than
fry, and uses as many low-fat substitutes as
possible in his dishes. The focus on health

might be one of the things detracting from
the spiciness usually found in Indian dishes.
The variety of Little India's buffet ranges
from standard meat dishes such as lamb vin
daloo, chicken tikka and tandoori chicken
(which is some of the most tender chicken I
have ever been served, literally falling off of
the bone) to vegetarian curries (pahadi kadi
and alu baigan) and nightly potato and lentil
dishes. A vast array of chutneys (finely
minced vegetables and spices) and peppers
are offered to vary the temperature and taste
of all dishes which are purposely prepared for
those who prefer very mild (read: almost
bland) dishes. A native Indian dessert is al
ways on hand, in addition to the generous of
fering of fresh fruit. The evening of our visit,
the special was Mango Phirnee.
Unfortunately — as is the case with so
many things in life — there arc major trade
offs between the quantity and quality of food
at Little India. Many of the dishes simply
lacked the spice and flavor that makes Indian
food popular, even after adding the provided
peppers, sauces and chutneys. Dishes lacked
distinctiveness, perhaps due to the baking as
opposed to the deep frying method, as well as
the volume in which it was cooked.
For example, we were hard pressed to dis
tinguish the chicken tikka from the tandoori
chicken and the lamb — it seemed like un
differentiate meat. I was hesitant to try the
lamb vindaloo due to the number of horror

stories I had heard about the intense temper
atures associated with this style of curry. My
fears were unfounded, as the lamb went
down as easy as a Chuck's donut. Perhaps I
could have committed culinary suicide by
heaping layers of peppers on the vindaloo,
but that's not the point of Indian food. Half
of the fun is tasting the variety of spices with
which each chef elects to dress the dish.
Another drawback to the "family-style
service" is the voluminous presentation of
food. Served in large crock pots and warming
dishes, many dishes were warm at best.
The nan bread served with our meal was
very disappointing. It tasted like pita bread
that had been lightly toasted and smeared
with butter. I have only tasted nan such as
this once before — when I left a package of
Safeway nan bread in the window of my car
for the afternoon while sightseeing at Wind
sor. The mango dessert seemed harmless, but
was again disappointing, having the consis
tency of week-old jello (and a skin to match).
I forced down two bites (to be objective) with
the same conclusion: blah.
The "charming" atmosphere promised on
the advertisements and reviews of days past
that adorned Little India's facade consisted of
plastic flowers placed in empty imported beer
bottles (the source of empty beer bottles was
probably the long menu list of imported Indi
an and German beers), plants everywhere and
an incessant soundtrack of a man writhing in

pain at several hundred decibels. Although I
revel in finding restaurants with "character,"
this place had enough character to serve as the
hero of a Charles Dickens novel. I recognize
that one cannot expect too much from a buf
fet-style eatery, but this was no Mr. Chad's. It
was more like what 1 would imagine the Hun
gry Heifer (of "Cheers" fame) to be.
In summary, ifyou are looking for a cheap
Indian fix, with an eye for quantity and qual
ity-be-damned, and you have a penchant for
health-conscious Indian food, then Little
India is worth looking into if you are in the
area. However, other Indian restaurants have
substantially better fare and are well within
biking distance (be prepared to wait for a
table, though!). But if you are feeling kind of
seedy and happen to be cruising downtown
Redwood City, pay a visit to Little India. And
tell them that Norm sent you.
