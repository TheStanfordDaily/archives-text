# Fabulous Finales at the Opera
## 
### Gabriela Teodorescu 
»Jpera isn t only about the tat lady singing,
though it has something to do with it. As the
conclusion of this tail's San Francisco Opera
season shows, the romance and the tragedy
of opera can he terrifyingly moving and gen
tly entertaining. Four different operas will he
showing, interspersed between today and
Dec. 10.
Fa ust
Charles Gounod classic "Faust," the first
of the tour pieces closing this autumn's series.
The story of an old man, Faust, who signs his
soul to the devil in exchange for youth and
love is well-known. He falls in love and then
betrays his love, Marguerite, a part sung by
soprano Nancy Gustafson. Samuel Ramey,
who sings the bass part of Mephistopheles,
has been world-acclaimed for his voice.
"Ffe rocked the house," says junior Yasmin
Craig, a music major. "And so did | Richard
Leech, who played Faust]."
The set in the new production replicates
life-size the facade of a gothic cathedral, atop
of which is a gargoyle. A floodlight shines on
the gargoyle whenever Mephistopheles in on
stage. Other such details come together to
create a sense of intimacy and power. For ex-

ample, in the final scenes, when Margeurite
has gone insane, she is bald and shocking to
the audience.
I his one actually might be hard to catch
since the overwhelming demand for tickets
has made the opera add an additional perfor
mance. If you are lucky enough to find a tick
et or scalp one, try not to miss the beautiful
music and the tragic story all set in a new
production. The last performance, sung in
French, is on Nov. 16.
Die Walk iire
Despite the bad reputation that Richard
Wagner often receives, this opera does tend
to be Wagner at his best. The story is a uni
versal oneofVikinggodsat war with thunder
and lightning flashing across the stage. The
tale is filled with all the archetypal situations,
from the sword found in a tree, to incest be
tween brother and sister, to a goddess and a
ring of fire.
According to Craig, two of the most beau
tiful voices in the piece are those of Jane Ea
glen, who sings the part of Brunnhilde and
Anne Evans, who sings the part of Sieglinde.
Both are sopranos.

"The emotional depth of their voices, es
pecially in the more tragic scenes, was truly
heart-wrenching," Craig says.
Once again, the set defines beauty in
tragedy through its majesty and attention to
detail, from the huge tree in the first act to the
smoking urn and the immensity of the Val
halla palace. The costumes are rich and strik
ing in their color and depth.
"I was more impressed with Wagner than I
thought I would be," Craig says."The music is
tryingly beautiful, more so than I expected."
Wagner's epic, and a production of "Die
Walkiire" you do not want to miss, is sung in
German from now until Nov. 29.
Don Giovanni
Who could forget this tale of the quintes
sential rake, put to music by the unforget
table Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart? The char
acter of Don Giovanni is also sung masterful
ly by Samuel Ramey in many of the perfor
mances.
Giovanni makes no discrimination as to
which women he chooses to compromise. In
fact, as the story goes, he breaks the heart of
each one until he runs into some trouble. In
the reconfiguration of the Don Juan saga,
Mozart chooses to offer up some angry
women, jealous suitors and one extremely
vengeful ghost. In fact, don't expect only
tragedy from this one — some comedy cer
tainly strikes at the heart.
The music for this new production, of
course, is some of the most beautiful opera
has to offer. It is Mozart at his most moving.

To hear both gorgeous music and incredible
voices, see Don Giovanni sung in Italian be
fore Dec. 7, when it closes.
Rusalka
No, "Rusalka" is not Disney on the stage of
the War Memorial Opera House, but it is a
retelling of the"The Little Mermaid" story by
Hans Christian Andersen.
The opera, written by Antonin Dvorak,
has a very unique character to it — it is sung
in Czech. Having never been produced by the
San Francisco opera before, it is the opera's
second premiere of the season (the other
having been "Ruslan and Lyudmila" early in
the season). The story is probably familiar:
The water nymph Rusalka decides to relin
quish her underwater existence for a mere
mortal whom she has fallen in love with. But
once she loses her past, the question remains
as to whether she can be happy with life on
earth.
For the part of Rusalka, one of the most
beautiful operatic artists, Renee Fleming,
will be singing the piece. She is a soprano
who has sung to world acclaim since her Met
ropolitan Opera debut in March 1991.
The opera, with magical and enchanting
music, will be closing this incredibly success
ful season on Dec. 10.
So before the fat lady finishes singing, and
especially in order to get away from the hum
drum of campus life and experience tragedy
other than failing a midterm, take the Cal-
Train, dress up and listen to some opera.
You'll feel better for it.

»Jpera isn t only about the tat lady singing,
though it has something to do with it. As the
conclusion of this tail's San Francisco Opera
season shows, the romance and the tragedy
of opera can he terrifyingly moving and gen
tly entertaining. Four different operas will he
showing, interspersed between today and
Dec. 10.
Fa ust
Charles Gounod classic "Faust," the first
of the tour pieces closing this autumn's series.
The story of an old man, Faust, who signs his
soul to the devil in exchange for youth and
love is well-known. He falls in love and then
betrays his love, Marguerite, a part sung by
soprano Nancy Gustafson. Samuel Ramey,
who sings the bass part of Mephistopheles,
has been world-acclaimed for his voice.
"Ffe rocked the house," says junior Yasmin
Craig, a music major. "And so did | Richard
Leech, who played Faust]."
The set in the new production replicates
life-size the facade of a gothic cathedral, atop
of which is a gargoyle. A floodlight shines on
the gargoyle whenever Mephistopheles in on
stage. Other such details come together to
create a sense of intimacy and power. For ex-

ample, in the final scenes, when Margeurite
has gone insane, she is bald and shocking to
the audience.
I his one actually might be hard to catch
since the overwhelming demand for tickets
has made the opera add an additional perfor
mance. If you are lucky enough to find a tick
et or scalp one, try not to miss the beautiful
music and the tragic story all set in a new
production. The last performance, sung in
French, is on Nov. 16.
Die Walk iire
Despite the bad reputation that Richard
Wagner often receives, this opera does tend
to be Wagner at his best. The story is a uni
versal oneofVikinggodsat war with thunder
and lightning flashing across the stage. The
tale is filled with all the archetypal situations,
from the sword found in a tree, to incest be
tween brother and sister, to a goddess and a
ring of fire.
According to Craig, two of the most beau
tiful voices in the piece are those of Jane Ea
glen, who sings the part of Brunnhilde and
Anne Evans, who sings the part of Sieglinde.
Both are sopranos.

"The emotional depth of their voices, es
pecially in the more tragic scenes, was truly
heart-wrenching," Craig says.
Once again, the set defines beauty in
tragedy through its majesty and attention to
detail, from the huge tree in the first act to the
smoking urn and the immensity of the Val
halla palace. The costumes are rich and strik
ing in their color and depth.
"I was more impressed with Wagner than I
thought I would be," Craig says."The music is
tryingly beautiful, more so than I expected."
Wagner's epic, and a production of "Die
Walkiire" you do not want to miss, is sung in
German from now until Nov. 29.
Don Giovanni
Who could forget this tale of the quintes
sential rake, put to music by the unforget
table Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart? The char
acter of Don Giovanni is also sung masterful
ly by Samuel Ramey in many of the perfor
mances.
Giovanni makes no discrimination as to
which women he chooses to compromise. In
fact, as the story goes, he breaks the heart of
each one until he runs into some trouble. In
the reconfiguration of the Don Juan saga,
Mozart chooses to offer up some angry
women, jealous suitors and one extremely
vengeful ghost. In fact, don't expect only
tragedy from this one — some comedy cer
tainly strikes at the heart.
The music for this new production, of
course, is some of the most beautiful opera
has to offer. It is Mozart at his most moving.

To hear both gorgeous music and incredible
voices, see Don Giovanni sung in Italian be
fore Dec. 7, when it closes.
Rusalka
No, "Rusalka" is not Disney on the stage of
the War Memorial Opera House, but it is a
retelling of the"The Little Mermaid" story by
Hans Christian Andersen.
The opera, written by Antonin Dvorak,
has a very unique character to it — it is sung
in Czech. Having never been produced by the
San Francisco opera before, it is the opera's
second premiere of the season (the other
having been "Ruslan and Lyudmila" early in
the season). The story is probably familiar:
The water nymph Rusalka decides to relin
quish her underwater existence for a mere
mortal whom she has fallen in love with. But
once she loses her past, the question remains
as to whether she can be happy with life on
earth.
For the part of Rusalka, one of the most
beautiful operatic artists, Renee Fleming,
will be singing the piece. She is a soprano
who has sung to world acclaim since her Met
ropolitan Opera debut in March 1991.
The opera, with magical and enchanting
music, will be closing this incredibly success
ful season on Dec. 10.
So before the fat lady finishes singing, and
especially in order to get away from the hum
drum of campus life and experience tragedy
other than failing a midterm, take the Cal-
Train, dress up and listen to some opera.
You'll feel better for it.
