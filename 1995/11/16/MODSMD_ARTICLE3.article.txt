# 'A game of politics'
## Farm's experts discuss federal budget impasse

The ongoing duel in Washington over a
balanced budget plan which has led to a shut
down of non-essential government services
simply reflects business as usual for govern
ment, Stanford professors say.
"The standoff is a game of politics," said
John Cogan, a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution and acting director of the Public
Policy Program.
"This has happened in the past," Cogan
added. "Americans just have to get used to
living in a political environment."
The battle has been raging between a De
mocratic White House and a Republican Con
gress — as well as between the Senate and the
House of Representatives — for many
months. But it was not until Tuesday that the
inability of President Clinton and House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., to come to
any agreement began to directly affect Amer
icans nationwide.
Late Monday night, Clinton vetoed a bill

which would have provided funding to run
the government past Tuesday and another
which would have allowed the federal debt
ceiling to rise. Clinton objected to measures
attached to the two bills which would have re
quired him to follow the Republicans' plan to
balance the budget in seven years and also
would have raised Medicare premiums.
History Prof. Emeritus Carl Degler agreed
that the standoff among the two houses of
Congress and the President is no surprise but
said, nevertheless, "it's pretty deplorable."
"There's no reason we have to do this kind
of thing," Degler said. "We're the only coun
try in the Western world that runs into this
kind of thing because we're the only country
that has a divided government."
Because American politics follow a system
of checks and balances that "distribute
rather than concentrate" national authority,
"this is going to happen over and over again,"
