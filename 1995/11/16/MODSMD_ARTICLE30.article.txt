# A 						Focus ON Independent Filmmaking
## Take One: Haile Gerima-Five commandments of black Filmmking 
### Victor Haseman Malcolm Maclachlan 
Independent filmmaker and academician
Haile Gerima may very well be the Holly
wood studio system's most unforgiving
critic — and that is a compliment. As a 25-
year veteran of the kind of filmmaking that
won't ever win a five-film development deal
with Columbia / Tri-Star, the outlawkind, he
is intimately familiar with the slippery nature
of Hollywood's shuffle. Gerima has done all
that he can to steer his art, his distribution
company, Mypheduh Films, Inc., and his stu
dents at the predominantly black Howard

University clear of a production system that
he believes incapable of negotiating the nar
rative needs of all Americans save white
Americans.
I. If you choose to work in Hollywood, know
that you will always be at the end of a major
studio's lease.
"By in large," explains the soft spoken Ger
ima in a recent phone interview, "the indus
try is very racist. And within that racial con
text, 1 don't think they're capable of respond
ing to an African-American or African per
spective on issues. I think [Hollywood] has
come about it from a plantation owner's per
spective historically, even when they make
movies about blacks."
Though his criticisms of Hollywood are
scathing, do not mistake them for the kinds
of "kill whitey" rhetoric too often associated
with extreme thinkers — thinkers ripped out
of context by sensitive, main-stream critics of
racial discourse as mediated through Ameri
can pop culture. His perspective is sub
merged in a convincing and compelling
logic, one exemplified regally in his latest fea

ture"Sankofa" (1993), which will be present
ed tomorrow evening by the African-Ameri
can Class of 1998 in Kresge Auditorium.
11. Don't make movies about subjects you
care nothing about.
Taken literally, "Sankofa" (which, in the
African language of Akan, means a return to
roots, a recapturing of that which was lost in
order to move forward) is the story of a black
woman's journey into the past, where she be
comes a house slave on a sugar plantation. It

Courlesy of Haile Gerima
is a harrowingly graphic introduction — for
both heroine and audience — to an econom
ic and social way of life that robbed a race rich
in cultural and social diversity of its dignity,
its humanity, its autonomy.
Taken allegorically, it is as much an indict
ment of today as of yesterday, explains Geri
ma. "Basically ['Sankofa'] departed from the
whole notion of identity ... and racism as a
cultural notion and slavery as a system,
which supported the landscape for me to
work out some of the psychological, social
and economic problems blacks are experi
encing today.... It's working out the years of
badgering the identity of the African people
and the psychological repercussions of those
kinds of sociological realities — and psycho
logical realities."
Taken as a model for contemporary, inde
pendent black film, however, "Sankofa" is
that much more compelling. The making of
the underground hit is as powerful a tale as its
narrative, and equally important. The origi
nal idea started as a brain child some nine
years ago, explains Gerima, though he feels
that the struggle to get the film produced

took much longer.
"'Sankofa' is a 20-year struggle. Other
movies have been made to generate some of
[its] seed money. We have our own distribu
tion company (Mypheduh). Until 'Sankofa,'
we made movies in a basement where we
lived. Now we have a four- or five-room of
fice and an editing space."
111. Black independent cinema must be sup
ported by black financiers, black distribu
tors, black theater owners, black audiences.
Of course, Gerima's film would be
nowhere without the support of black com
munities throughout the nation. One need
only glance through a few of the film's multi
tude of write-ups to have an understanding
of the instrumental support of black audi
ences and investors.
Though financing "Sankofa" must be un
derstood within the continuum of fundraising
for previous Mypheduh productions, it is im
portant to understand that Gerima's latest fea
ture struck a chord among the collective con
sciousness of black folk the way a sermon from
a seasoned preacher man might — unexpect
edly, and with soul-wringing force. Previous
films include "Ashes and Embers" (1982), the
poignant tale of a Vietnam veteran, and "Bush
Mama" (1976), the film that most critics agree
announced Gerima's arrival.
It was the kind of response that held the
movie over 11 weeks in a District of Colum
bia theater that was originally scheduled for
one week. It was the kind of response that
prompted Mypheduh to lease the Thalia the
ater on the upperside of Manhattan for an
open-ended engagement after the film fin
ished a five-month run in New York last year.
It was the kind of response that independent
ly catapulted the film into limited release
around the country and abroad.
"['Sankofa'] is a film done by people with
out the industry," explains Gerima, "neither
financially, nor ideologically, nor culturally.
It comes from a different angle. It has its own
pitfalls, its own mediocracies, its own suc
cesses. It's not only what it says — the very
language of the film is an imperfect attempt
to define identity.
IV. To create a cultural image, a notion of
humanity, you must abandon the methods
of filmmaking dictated by the Hollywood
system.
"Not only through the issues that are pre
sented, but the very notion, the very struc
ture of the film, the very title of the film, the
very casting of the characters and the narra
tive is totally a very unacceptable narrative
from the Hollywood perspective. And we're
fully aware of that."
And the filmmaker would not wish it to be
any different. Central to the making of
"Sankofa" — and to Gerima's personal pro

auction philosophy —is the total rejection ot
the studio system. It is a system, he contends,
that confounds the filmmaker of color's en
deavor to produce meaningful visual state
ments. On the one hand, suggests Gerima, it
is a system devoted to maintain the status
quo, be it through new and original work, or
through reinterpretations of the history.
In the last year alone, the American public
has witnessed everything from"The Scarlet
Letter" to "Rob Roy" to "Jefferson in Paris,"
and has even seen the future of the status quo
in interpretations as varied as "Water World,"
to "Johnny Mnemonic," to "Tank Girl." The
mainstream is toasted and celebrated more
times a year in theaters across the country
than any— save the statisticians whose job it
is to care — can count.
In contrast, argues Gerima, "If a movie is
made about slavery, it is to contrast the politi
cal notion that [the studio systems] want to
push in [America]. And the pressure they
mount on black films, on Native American
films to live up to American notions is part of
the [system's] flaw. Again, I don't think they
see Native Americans beyond 'Dances With
Wolves,' which is their perspective. I don't
think they see black people beyond 'Driving
Miss Daisy,' or being a devoted male loyalist at
all expenses of humanity to prove citizenship."
While Gerima's vision of the modern
American filmmaker of color's plight in Hol
lywood is thoroughly bleak, he does not
leave her or him without options. And his is
a solution rooted in common sense. Instead
of channeling energy into finding money in
Hollywood at the risk of compromising
one's narrative vision, why not instead take
your energy and channel it into virtually un
charted territory — one's community of
color.
"Identity does not come by shouting con
tent only. Identity is also reinforced in form
as well. You can't liberate yourself with poi
soned form. And that's the very premise of
['Sankofa']. And so all the appeal we received
from the African American community
specifically and especially is because that
hunger is shared — that common hunger. We
made the movie because we were hungry for
images different than what the West's con
ception of us, of our kind of people, is."
V. Always assume that your story is merely a
drop of water on a desert landscape. To c" -
sider the holistic merits of your work is to
miss the point.

Basically, looking around the movies we see,
they continue to depend on white people. They
continue to nurture the notion of racism in a
very sophisticated way. "Sankofa," on the other
hand, is a drop of water on a desert landscape
that is not permitted to be worked out in the
film expression medium.

IV. To create a cultural image, a notion of
humanity, you must abandon the methods
of filmmaking dictated by the Hollywood
system.
"Not only through the issues that are pre
sented, but the very notion, the very struc
ture of the film, the very title of the film, the
very casting of the characters and the narra
tive is totally a very unacceptable narrative
from the Hollywood perspective. And we're
fully aware of that."
And the filmmaker would not wish it to be
any different. Central to the making of
"Sankofa" — and to Gerima's personal pro

auction philosophy —is the total rejection ot
the studio system. It is a system, he contends,
that confounds the filmmaker of color's en
deavor to produce meaningful visual state
ments. On the one hand, suggests Gerima, it
is a system devoted to maintain the status
quo, be it through new and original work, or
through reinterpretations of the history.
In the last year alone, the American public
has witnessed everything from"The Scarlet
Letter" to "Rob Roy" to "Jefferson in Paris,"
and has even seen the future of the status quo
in interpretations as varied as "Water World,"
to "Johnny Mnemonic," to "Tank Girl." The
mainstream is toasted and celebrated more
times a year in theaters across the country
than any— save the statisticians whose job it
is to care — can count.
In contrast, argues Gerima, "If a movie is
made about slavery, it is to contrast the politi
cal notion that [the studio systems] want to
push in [America]. And the pressure they
mount on black films, on Native American
films to live up to American notions is part of
the [system's] flaw. Again, I don't think they
see Native Americans beyond 'Dances With
Wolves,' which is their perspective. I don't
think they see black people beyond 'Driving
Miss Daisy,' or being a devoted male loyalist at
all expenses of humanity to prove citizenship."
While Gerima's vision of the modern
American filmmaker of color's plight in Hol
lywood is thoroughly bleak, he does not
leave her or him without options. And his is
a solution rooted in common sense. Instead
of channeling energy into finding money in
Hollywood at the risk of compromising
one's narrative vision, why not instead take
your energy and channel it into virtually un
charted territory — one's community of
color.
"Identity does not come by shouting con
tent only. Identity is also reinforced in form
as well. You can't liberate yourself with poi
soned form. And that's the very premise of
['Sankofa']. And so all the appeal we received
from the African American community
specifically and especially is because that
hunger is shared — that common hunger. We
made the movie because we were hungry for
images different than what the West's con
ception of us, of our kind of people, is."
V. Always assume that your story is merely a
drop of water on a desert landscape. To c" -

miss the point.

Basically, looking around the movies we see,
they continue to depend on white people. They
continue to nurture the notion of racism in a
very sophisticated way. "Sankofa," on the other
hand, is a drop of water on a desert landscape
that is not permitted to be worked out in the
film expression medium.

Independent filmmaker and academician
Haile Gerima may very well be the Holly
wood studio system's most unforgiving
critic — and that is a compliment. As a 25-
year veteran of the kind of filmmaking that
won't ever win a five-film development deal
with Columbia / Tri-Star, the outlawkind, he
is intimately familiar with the slippery nature
of Hollywood's shuffle. Gerima has done all
that he can to steer his art, his distribution
company, Mypheduh Films, Inc., and his stu
dents at the predominantly black Howard

University clear of a production system that
he believes incapable of negotiating the nar
rative needs of all Americans save white
Americans.
I. If you choose to work in Hollywood, know
that you will always be at the end of a major
studio's lease.
"By in large," explains the soft spoken Ger
ima in a recent phone interview, "the indus
try is very racist. And within that racial con
text, 1 don't think they're capable of respond
ing to an African-American or African per
spective on issues. I think [Hollywood] has
come about it from a plantation owner's per
spective historically, even when they make
movies about blacks."
Though his criticisms of Hollywood are
scathing, do not mistake them for the kinds
of "kill whitey" rhetoric too often associated
with extreme thinkers — thinkers ripped out
of context by sensitive, main-stream critics of
racial discourse as mediated through Ameri
can pop culture. His perspective is sub
merged in a convincing and compelling
logic, one exemplified regally in his latest fea

ture"Sankofa" (1993), which will be present
ed tomorrow evening by the African-Ameri
can Class of 1998 in Kresge Auditorium.
11. Don't make movies about subjects you
care nothing about.
Taken literally, "Sankofa" (which, in the
African language of Akan, means a return to
roots, a recapturing of that which was lost in
order to move forward) is the story of a black
woman's journey into the past, where she be
comes a house slave on a sugar plantation. It

Courlesy of Haile Gerima
is a harrowingly graphic introduction — for
both heroine and audience — to an econom
ic and social way of life that robbed a race rich
in cultural and social diversity of its dignity,
its humanity, its autonomy.
Taken allegorically, it is as much an indict
ment of today as of yesterday, explains Geri
ma. "Basically ['Sankofa'] departed from the
whole notion of identity ... and racism as a
cultural notion and slavery as a system,
which supported the landscape for me to
work out some of the psychological, social
and economic problems blacks are experi
encing today.... It's working out the years of
badgering the identity of the African people
and the psychological repercussions of those
kinds of sociological realities — and psycho
logical realities."
Taken as a model for contemporary, inde
pendent black film, however, "Sankofa" is
that much more compelling. The making of
the underground hit is as powerful a tale as its
narrative, and equally important. The origi
nal idea started as a brain child some nine
years ago, explains Gerima, though he feels
that the struggle to get the film produced

took much longer.
"'Sankofa' is a 20-year struggle. Other
movies have been made to generate some of
[its] seed money. We have our own distribu
tion company (Mypheduh). Until 'Sankofa,'
we made movies in a basement where we
lived. Now we have a four- or five-room of
fice and an editing space."
111. Black independent cinema must be sup
ported by black financiers, black distribu
tors, black theater owners, black audiences.
Of course, Gerima's film would be
nowhere without the support of black com
munities throughout the nation. One need
only glance through a few of the film's multi
tude of write-ups to have an understanding
of the instrumental support of black audi
ences and investors.
Though financing "Sankofa" must be un
derstood within the continuum of fundraising
for previous Mypheduh productions, it is im
portant to understand that Gerima's latest fea
ture struck a chord among the collective con
sciousness of black folk the way a sermon from
a seasoned preacher man might — unexpect
edly, and with soul-wringing force. Previous
films include "Ashes and Embers" (1982), the
poignant tale of a Vietnam veteran, and "Bush
Mama" (1976), the film that most critics agree
announced Gerima's arrival.
It was the kind of response that held the
movie over 11 weeks in a District of Colum
bia theater that was originally scheduled for
one week. It was the kind of response that
prompted Mypheduh to lease the Thalia the
ater on the upperside of Manhattan for an
open-ended engagement after the film fin
ished a five-month run in New York last year.
It was the kind of response that independent
ly catapulted the film into limited release
around the country and abroad.
"['Sankofa'] is a film done by people with
out the industry," explains Gerima, "neither
financially, nor ideologically, nor culturally.
It comes from a different angle. It has its own
pitfalls, its own mediocracies, its own suc
cesses. It's not only what it says — the very
language of the film is an imperfect attempt
to define identity.
