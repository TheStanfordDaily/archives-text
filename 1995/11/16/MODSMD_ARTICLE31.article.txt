# Take Two: Les Blank-director with a Mission
## 
### 
When opponents of the National En
dowment for the Arts criticize the
fund, they usually cite Robert
Mapplethorpe. The Endowment's support
ers can cite Les Blank.
Last Thursday, Blank participated in a
panel discussion at Stanford on the issue of
NEA funding. When asked what this funding
has meant to his career, Blank did not pull
any punches.
"None of these films would have been
made without initial funding by the NEA. It
doesn't pay for everything, but it gives you a
start for going out and getting private grants
and donations to finish a film," Blank said.
Blank has been making prize-winning
documentaries for 35 years. He has won
awards at the Sundance, Melbourne and San
Francisco Film Festivals and from the Amer
ican Film Institute and the British Academy
Awards. New York's Museum of Modern Art
has done a retrospective of his films and The
New York Times has called him "one of our
most original filmmakers."
"Most NEA grants are matching grants,"
Blank said. "They give you $25,000 if you can
go out and find $25,000 on your own. It's a
way of proving to potential donors that your
project is worthwhile."
Blank gives a human face to the ongoing
battles over federal funding for the En
dowments for Arts and Humanities.
While independent documentary filmmakers
often lose a lot of time trying to secure fund
ing for projects, Blank has been successful
enough over the years to produce almost 40
films since 1960, including three released last
year alone. He is currently hoping to contin
ue work on a film about Garrison Keillor. He
had started the project, but his NEA grant was
canceled part way through. This, Blank says,
is becoming more and more typical.
"Fortunately, it has not been common. It's
only in the last few years that it has hap
pened," he adds.
With the NEA taking a 40 percent budget
cut this year — and with it likely to be phased
out completely by 1997 — canceled funding
is likely to become increasingly common.
Blank was joined on the discussion panel
by Douglas Greenberg, president and direc
tor of the Chicago Historical Society, a pri
vate group which gives grants for academic
and artistic endeavors. Greenberg delivered
a paper entitled "Losing the Battle and Win
ning the War," in which he made the intel
lectual case for public funding for the arts.
"If we eliminated all the cultural pro
grams tomorrow, we would not approach
the cost of a single B-l bomber or make a
dent in the deficit that anyone could notice
or measure. The NEA and NEH have made
some bad grants, but nobody is suggesting
getting rid of the Navy because of the Tail

hook scandal. Nobody has said we should
dissolve the Senate because Bob Packvvood
sexually harassed every woman he met
over 25 years."
The irony for Blank is that he does not
see himself as a controversial artist. "I
don't know if I'm the one the [opponents]
are mainly after. I hope not. I don't think
I'm upsetting the apple cart," he says.
Blank nevertheless admits to the anti
establishment views of his films, howev
er. "I do empower poor people. I try to
find something powerful and meaning
ful about people," he said.
One of his most prominent films,
"Burden of Dreams," was
screened at Stanford the night
before the discussion. The film follows

German director Werner Herzog
through a four-year ordeal as he films
his epic "Fitzcarraldo" in the Brazilian
rain forest. The film deals with rubber
baron Fitzcarraldo, loosely based on a
historical figure, and an obsession
which leads him to try to have a steam
boat carried from one river to another
over a mountain. "Burden of Dreams"
becomes a story about a megalomaniac
making a film about a megalomaniac, as
the filming required Herzog to repeat
this improbable stunt. Herzog nearly
got several native workers killed in the

process. Yet many of
the workers came to
share Herzoe's

dream, Blank say!
even threatening
to kill star Klaus
Kinski if he
didn't finish the
film.

"I kept thinking
of the story of'Heart

of Darkness,' " Blank
told the audience after the

screening. "Near the end, it
seemed to me that Herzog was
becoming like Fitzcarraldo himself

"Burden of Dreams" won the 1982
Brit ish Academy Award for best feature doc
umentary. Though he was initially somewha

embarrassed by the way he was portrayed in
the film, Herzog now asks that "Burden Of
Dreams" be included among retrospectives of
his own work. The film also won Blank wide
critical acclaim in this country. Such promi
nence allowed him to become more prolific
throughout the 1980s and early 19905.
Through it all, Blank has rarely been influ
enced either by criticism or praise of his works.
"Usually, I let the subject determine the
style in which 1 film," Blank said. "A lot of
people think I only do films on ethnic music."
Blank's films are a celebration of both the
ordinary and the bizarre. They include "Gap-

Toothed
Women" (1987) and"In Heaven There is No
Beer? (That's Why Drink It Here)," which
features Connecticut's Polkabration and
other Polish-American celebrations.
He also has an ongoing interest in tradi
tional societies, especially those in America,
from Louisiana Cajuns to Appalachian Blue
grass musicians. These films pay particular
attention to the art these cultures produce —
and to the fact that the line between produc
ers and consumers of art in such cultures has
not been strictly drawn, as it is in modern
capitalists societies.
Last year, Blank won rave reviews at the
San Francisco Film Festival for"The Mae
stro: King of the Cowboy Artists." Shot over
10 years, it details the life of 59-year-old Gary
Gaxiola, an acclaimed artist who is ignored
by the art galleries because he refuses to ac
cept money for his works.
An uncompromising vision is something
with which Blank, 60, can identify. He brings
so much integrity to his work that sometimes
even the producers at the Public Broadcast
ing System are too commercial for him. He
told the forum audience about the problems
he had while making "Burden of Dreams"
with the help of some PBS funds.
"They told me I could not show anything
on camera for more than four seconds with
some narration explaining it. They tried to
make the film into the kind of film they
would like to see for television," he said.
In the end, Blank got to make that film —
and all the others — the way he wanted.
The fear of losing public funding has not
influenced Blank to seek "safe" projects. He is
currently working on a film about Earth
First!, the radical environmental group.
When asked to defend why the public
should help fund what he does, Blank point
ed out that profit companies would never
make films like his.
"All of these are films 1 would like to see,"
he said. "They're artful. They are full of vital
ity and human spirit."
