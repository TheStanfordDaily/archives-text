## PASSENGERS Original Soundtracks 1 
### 
"Original Soundtracks 1," the new collab
oration between U2 and Brian I no, is.i mess.
I ven though every U2 album since "The
Unforgettable Fire" (1986) could be de
scribed as a collaboration ol sorts with I.no,
U2 decided to change their name to "Passen -
gers" lor this new album. The only official
difference is that, for the first time, 1 no is
given writing credit along with the rest ofU2.
A mix of instrumental tracks, experimen
tal songs and what can only be called novelty
numbers, the album is supposedly a collec
tion of soundtrack music from various films
from around the world. Indeed, even that
fact is doubtful, as the descriptions of a num
ber of the films are comically fake. Further
more, the names of many of the actors and
directors from the film are simply anagrams
of people involved with U2 (such as director
l.urlene Clewman, a.k.a. Lawrence Mullen,
U2's drummer).
Understanding the album is nearly im
possible. Even the songs with lyrics are diffi
cult to grasp. "Always Forever Now," for ex
ample, is composed of simply those same
three words over and over again, and "Miss
Sarajevo" and "Ito Okashi" contain signifi
cant sections in Japanese and Italian.
Listening to the album, however, is a dif
ferent story. Fno has worked hard to give U2
an utterly unique sound, which has helped to
crystallize the band's masterpieces, "The
Joshua Tree" and "Achtung Baby." Neverthe
less, on those albums, the emphasis was still
on making good rock and roll. On "Original
Soundtracks 1," the emphasis is the sound.
On "Slug," heavy studio effects give the
song a majestic, ethereal feel, producing a
beautifully hypnotic effect. Similarly, the
throbbing techno beat to "Theme From* Let's
Go Native' " gives the song enough intensity
to overcome its general lack of melody.
In general, the sonic experimentalism of
the album is quite enticing although the en
durability ol the songs is questionable.
"Theme From 'The Swan,' " for example, is

unbearably awful, a mere jumble of
synthesized notes held far too long. By
far the album's most pretentious mo
ment, the track evokes images of a 12-
year-old playing with the keyboard he
just got for (Christmas.
Two tracks, however, come close to
remedying the album's weaknesses.
"Miss Sarajevo" features a gorgeous
cameo by I uciano I'avarotti, which
perhaps will show a number ol I '2 fans
just how much more elegant opera is
than rock and roll. The other standout
tr.uk, "1 Ivis Ate America," is a hilari
ously bizarre rockabilly tune which
one has to hear to believe.
Both a disappointment and a suc
cess, "Original Soundtracks 1" is a
beautiful album and a boring album.
Generally, however, it is a confusing
album.
