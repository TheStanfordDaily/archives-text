# CYPRESS HILL
## Temples of Boom 
### 
Cypress Hill crecp like vampire
gangsters in their third album, "Temples of
Boom." A dark, plodding production style
flows under 151 racks of deep beats and organ
loops to form a horrific mixture of smooth
and cinematic hip-hop. Cypress Hill are
ready to get their tracks booming to horror
flicks — the album feels like an urban Drac
ula resurrected into hip-hops legacy of street
rhythm and rap battles.
The style is unique, mysterious, kickback
and addictive to pop fans and hip-hop con
noisseurs alike. It has become one of the Bay
Area's top selling albums for good reason:
Cypress 1 lill have skills. They have no bright
songs to light up your life in "Temples of
Boom." Instead, there are samples of disem
bodied opera singers, broken pianos and
bursts of saxophone to darken late nights
stuck in the wrong part of town.
lyrics arc rapped with the same Cypress
Hill nasal style as the earlier albums, but the
words themselves don't no beyond making

mo' money and killing mo' suckas. "I put the
glock to your dome and you start to cry" is a
repeated refrain on track six, "Boom Biddy
Bye Bye." They even bring back to life the
"Stoned is the way of the walk" refrain in the
last track, suggesting that they ran out of
ideas towards the end of their 55-minute CD.
The flowing theme, returned to through
out the album like a drunk stumbling
through a midnight alley, is chronic-puffing,
blunt-rolling and indo-toking. Interlaced
through the thick narcotic haze are we-are
doper-than-your-mama songs or tracks
mixed in Spanish and English about popping
cops and nailing the luckless.
The Chicano and Latino crowds will be
pleased to be represented on pop records.
And those seeking phat beats for hip-hop
snacks are right at home with "Temple" 's
unique production and gothic sound. But if
you and your 13 bones are out for something
a little deeper than lyrics like "Everybody
must get stoned," keep on looking, liver since
Grand Master Flash and the Furious Five
recorded "The Message," I've been looking
for something more profound in rap lyrics
than a roughneck flamboyance with little in
the way of enlightenment. But if slick, artful
style is what you're after, then Cypress Hill's
"Temples of Boom" has it for the taking.
