## Hempilation 
### 
Emerging from endless billows of pot
smoking apathy and smoke-staled rhetoric is
"Hempilation," an impressive collection of
power-puffing ditties determined to bring
new meaning to the phrase "grass roots.' Co
ordinated by the politically ambitious hemp
defenders NORM I. (National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana l aws), the
album features the works of some of reefer's
most outspoken bards: Cypress Hill, the
Black Crowes, Ziggv Marley and the Melody
Makers and Blues Traveler.

With uncanny cooperation and noble
vigor, "Hempilation" has crystallized more
than a generation's worth of dissatisfaction
with current marijuana laws. Transcending
the aimless "Legalize it, dude" sentiment, the
album resurrects some of pot's most cher
ished anthems with sensitive originality and
modern style. Replenishing Sly and the Fam
ily Stone's "I Want to Take You Higher" is
Blues Traveler, a group that admirably follows
a tough act with '90s vibrance and a comfy
barroom atmosphere. And electrifying the
archival chords of Black Sabbath's "Sweet
Leaf" is Sacred Reich, an Arizona metal outfit
that crashes the mellow parade with pound
ing double bass and clenching power chords,
forcefully spraying ice water onto the faces of
yesterday's actionless stoners.
Perhaps "Hempilation" 's most harrowing
bong-blast comes from the Black Crowes,
whose sloppy delivery of Bob Dylan's "Rainy
Day Women #12 and 35" is downright unac
ceptable. The cover, featuring Dylan's cheeba
credo, "Everybody must get stoned," is ac
corded draconian punishment with the
Crowes' makeshift performance and plastic

pot worship. Brighter moments emerge with
Cypress Hill's live rendition of "I Wanna Get
High" and lan Moore's "Champagne and
Reefer," an innovative remixing of the Muddy
Waters blues classic.
l asts laughs are accorded to the self-paro
dying 1 )avid Peel and the 3h()'s, whose "I l ike
Marijuana" was most certainly inspired and
performed under a comic influence. With
twisty lyrics like "1 want to be a hippie and I
want to get stoned" being followed by semi
co m p reh e nsible sc rea msof"M a r i j u a na!" th is
Animal House potfest may be more than
some reefer-ragers can handle. Perhaps
David Peel and the 360 s have a message that
is somewhat different than its marijuana
cronies on "Hempilation": "I Like Marijua
na" is a devilishly exposing revelation of the
absurdities of the pot underworld, a perspec
tive that may be important to maintain in a
dubious crusade for marijuana liberation.
