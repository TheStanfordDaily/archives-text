## BLONDE REDHEAD La 						Mia Vita Violenta 
### 
Sure, American indie rock has more Sonic
Youth-inspired rock bands than it knows
what to do with, and low-fi noise-pop is no
longer the novelty it used to be. But just leave
it to two twins from Italy and two women
from Japan to show that the right group ol
people can still make a worthwhile record
with a hopelessly tired formula.
With their second I.P, "La Mia Vita Vio
lenta" (Italian for "My Violent Life"), Blonde
Redhead run the Thurston and Kim dynam
ic through their own skewed and scu/zy filter,
spicing things up to the point that their 10
nuggets of derivative pop actually come out
vaguely unique. Dual frontpersons Amedeo
Pace and kazu Makino whine and mumble
their way through soundscapes ol hazy
melodies and modest experimentation for a
trip that's thoroughly pleasant about 90 per
cent of the time.
Of course, the other 10 percent come early.
Track one starts with Makino's squeaky
squeals of "Oh my" over and over again be
fore Pace lets loose with his flat, dopey moan.
It's an awkward and slightly grating start, but
even here, there's a pretty great gurgling pop
song for those persistent enough to enjoy it.
"Violent Life" comes next, and now the
vocals are just fine. With a pleasantly eerie

Meat Puppets
feel reminiscent of something from the 3Ds'
last album, Pace's thin howl is now endearing
as it struggles to keep pace with the tight,
echoing guitars around it. Most of the other
songs here are similarly solid, simmering
with muffled energy and raw focus.
But it's on two tracks towards the end of
the album, "Bean" and "Jewel," where Blonde
Redhead really shine, finally finding the per
fect balance between pop and slop. With
honest emotion, tasteful sonic experiments
and a glimmer of Sonic Youth, it's here that
the group demonstrates that creative imita
tion can be the next best thing to, and indeed
the basis for, creative innovation.
