# MEAT PUPPETS
## No Joke! 
### 
Ladies and gentlemen! Are you ready to
play? Are you ready to win? Are you ready for
"Name that Musical Genre?" Today's topic is
the new album "No Joke!" by the Meat Pup
pets. Punk rock or country rock? Glam rock
or hard rock? With the Meat Puppets, the dis
tinction is never too clear. But after 15 years
and 11 albums, one thing is certain: their

music never fails to entertain the masses.
The album begins with their radio-friend
ly single, "Scum." Curt Kirkwood's ear-pierc
ing fretwork deftly goes into the highly infec
tious chorus — "Under the stone / We find
the scum / Under the stars/We find the
scum." On the next song, "Nothing," Kirk
wood takes the band to another level by
breaking out with turbulent, psychedelic
rock and chanting nihilistic platitudes — all
which evokes images of )imi Hendrix's classic
rock paradigms.
On their third cut, the Meat Puppets make
an unexpected halt and take a step back by in
troducing a sweet, soothing ballad titled
"Head." Although it lacks the orgasmic
adrenaline found on the first two songs, the
skilled use of piano, cello and Hammond
organ accompaniments is a true testament to
their extraordinary ability to transform from
one musical style to another.
As for the rest of the album, they continue
to pump one great song after another. On
"Eyeball," Kirkwood morbidly chants "Since
I hurt myself /1 feel so much better/Suck
my eyeball." Meanwhile, on "Predator," Kirk
wood extinguishes all the pressures of the real
world with tranquili/.ing melodies rounded
off by a charming guitar solo in between.
With one gritty rock song here and a sub
dued song there, one would ultimately think
that the Meat Puppets are going through an
identity crisis. But there is nothing more
pleasing than an album which fuses almost
all the genres of rock from the '70s to the '90s
into one cohesive package. Is this eclectic
sampling the formula for success? For $13,
you bet it is.
