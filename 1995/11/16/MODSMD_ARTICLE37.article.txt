# MADONNA
## Something to Remember 
### 
Madonna has three new songs on her
compilation of ballads, "Something to Re
member." You probably won't forget them,
but they're certainly not going to be in

grained in your brain either.
"I Want You," which initiates and ends the
album in two versions, has a funky sound and
some trivially romantic lyrics. Madonna's
latest release, "You'll Sec," contains that
haunting, Madonna ish sound mingled with
lyrics like "All on my own, I don't need any
one this time." Finally, her last try at ballad
innovation, "One More Chance," uses an
acoustic guitar and makes her sound differ
ent enough to be interesting, in a "More
Than Words" kind of way.
Aside from the three new songs, Madonna
has her best slow-moving melodies on this
album. But before we get to the music, on the
CD sleeve, Madonna tells us: "So much con
troversy has swirled around my career this
past decade that very little attention ever gets
paid to my music. The songs are all but for
gotten." Food for deep thought from the
blonde babe.
"Crazy for You" is still good, especially
since it should remind you of junior high
dances where the guy you're dancing with
had his face in your breasts. Couldn't forget
that feeling, and the song just brings it all
back.
"Live to Tell" is still good. Somehow, de
spite the unmemorable movie to which the
song was connected, this was a gem of the boy
toy's career. Remember all the little Madonna
look-alikes in their lace tops getting teary
eyed at the thought of her and Sean Penn in
the video? More from the CD cover: "While I
have no regrets regarding the choices I've
made artistically, I've learned to appreciate
the idea of doing things a simpler way." So,
the music is simple. What did you expect?
"Love Don't Live Here Anymore" is also
still good, though it won't be exactly like you
remember it. It's been "remixed."
In addition to such memorable un-
Madonna lyrics as "The best things in life are
always free" in '"I'llis Used to Be My Play
ground," and the sweet, pining tones of "Oh
Father," the album is pretty much complete.
"So without a lot of fanfare," Madonna
writes, "without any distraction, I present to
you this collection of ballads. Some are old,
some are new. All of them are from my heart."
Madonna fans, this one's only for you.
