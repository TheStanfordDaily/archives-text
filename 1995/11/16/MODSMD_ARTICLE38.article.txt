## Les 						Miserables 
### 
I'he cinematic epic is dead
despite "Les Miserables' '

fervent attempt to revive it.
This truth became painfully apparent as I
wandered into .1 vast, completely empty the
ater, save for a nuzzling elderly couple and
one zealous aspiring filmmaker. After spend
ing the previous week as a living sleep-depri
vation experiment, I clung to my S3 caf
feinated beverage, my only hope of enduring
Claude Lelouch's three-hour magnum opus.
But the film was surprisingly involving and
fast-paced, il horrendously self-conscious.
"Les Miserables" is not the forthcoming
movie of the glitzy Broadway extravaganza, but
a French film "inspired by the novel," written
and directed by Lelouch and starring Jean Paul

Belmondo as three different lean Valjean fig
ures. The film juxtaposes Victor Hugo's novel
with two other stories: a man falsely accused of
murder, and a Jewish family's (light from the
Nazis. Lelouch directs a bloated love letter to
I iugo's novel, attempting to show its universal
ity and effect 011 the lives of the French.
I.ike most epics, "Les Miserables" fails be
cause it has no sense of subtlety in expres
sion. It is in fact a silent movie that wandered
into the 1990s with all its affectations and
melodrama intact. As an apparent homage to
the live music of silent films, Lelouch inserts
shots of frantic piano playing to heighten the
dramatic tension in scenes. The result, how
ever, is jarring rather than profound. Despite
huge doses of suspension of disbelief, many
moments are simply preposterous. When a
ballet dancer sees her husband for the first
time in two years, having thought him dead

in the* war, she stoically mouths the words to
"Dancing cheek to cheek." This moment in
spired a palpable groan in the four-person
audience.
Often, despite a valiant effort to suppress
cynicism, 1 felt I was being swept into a Hall
mark-card universe. This was particularly
the case in the saccharin-laced finale, which
oddly undermines the film's overt suffering
theme. The story of the World War 11 Valjean
takes up the recent exasperating theme ignit
ed by Forrest (lump, with a simple man float
ing through life as a coincidental good
Samaritan. Everything is filtered and sepia
toned, as if Lelouch thought we needed some
extra indication of the film's vehement nos
talgia. While the acting is definitely sec
ondary to the spectacle, memorable perfor
mances include Alessandra Martines, lumi
nous as the ballerina, and Annie Girardot as

an intriguing woman who shelters a Jewish
lawyer. Belmondo, who does most of the
emoting with his abundant wrinkles, was
certainly not among the highlights.
"Les Miserables" has all the strengths and
weaknesses of a traditional screen epic. It's
overblown and ostentatious, but also
tremendously fun and possesses the occa
sional moment of sweeping vision. It is re
freshing to see a film with such a huge ambi
tion; essentially, it attempts to define the
human experience. However, it's also annoy
ingly relentless in its search for parallels to
Hugo's novel. The movie begins with a dizzy
ing society waltz and extends this vertigo
throughout, bombarding us with a web ot
narrative gimmicks. "Les Miserables" is as
much a culprit of masturbatory artistic ex
cess as the Broadway musical.
