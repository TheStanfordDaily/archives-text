## Nature Calls

I lere's the deal: I "here s a plot
(kind of), a girl (kind of),
many, many animals, there's

some ass-talking jokes, the same hair and
there's definitely Jim (Carrey.
Because this movie is a sequel, it's a hell of a
lot more conscious of everything it and $20-
million Jim do. Many egos did not emerge un
scathed from early production, after the firing
ot the first director and rampant rumors of
prima donna-type behavior — and of course,
the expectations of fans of the original (I per
sonallv loved the first and I say that with pride).
So anyway, the sequel is not as good — but it
docs have a Gregorian-like chant involving the
words "alrighty then" set to music. No joke.
The opening is a "Cliffhanger" parody that
is pretty damn funny wherein Ace loses a dan
gling raccoon he's trying to save. Devastated
by his failure, he flees to a Buddhist monastery
to become one with himself and nature, only
to be dragged out of meditation by a British
consulate assistant (lan McNeice) to find a
missing bat — the only one of God's beasts
dear Ventura truly fears. The catch is that the

freakish creature is a sacred albino, the key to
peace between two African tribes and the only
thing preventing a great deal of bloodshed.
I lence the interest of the slimy consul general
played by Simon ( allow.
limbo is pretty much out of control the en
tire time. Whether coughing up gigantic
phlegm globbcrs, dancingaround the consulate
in his Hawaiian print shirts, bonding with the
natives via walkingon hot coals or just spending
quiet time with "The Princess," Carrey's rubber
faced antics are on full throttle 24-7.
Not only is Jim the hyper guy going nuts,
but some of the situations arc unnecessarily
distasteful to the point of losing a lot of the
humor. The two tribes are fictional, but the
notion of tribal culture is mocked continu
ously, which gets old fairly fast. The slow
scenes are balanced out by several outrageous
ly funny scenes — just not enough of them.
"Ace Ventura 2" is pretty much a critic
proof movie. Millions of people will go see it
regardless of what reviewers says and most of
them will laugh much harder than 1 did. When
Old Jimmers spouts, "Come to me, my jungle
friends," whether it's worth $7 or not, whether
he's worth $20 million or not, they go.
