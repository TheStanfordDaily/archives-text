Lambertus Hesselink is hoping to revo
lutionize the way large amounts of data are
stored.
Hesselink, a professor of electrical engi
neering and applied physics at Stanford, is
one of two principal investigators working
on the Holographic Data Storage System
(HDSS). The program hopes to use holo

graphic technology to store the data equiva
lent of several hundred compact discs on, in
Hesselink's words, "something the size of a
sugar cube."
Hesselink said that instead of storing in
formation as physical features on a surface,
like a CD or floppy disc, the new technology
would "store in volume."
The process will work, he said, by storing
data in the form of pages that will resemble
"black and white checkerboards." An enor

mous number of these pages will make up
one cube, which will be made of a "light-sen
sitive medium."
HDSS was started in April with a $32
million grant for the Five-year program,
which is funded in part by Stanford. At the
end of this program, engineers hope to pro
duce two demonstration devices, Hesselink
said.
Hesselink listed several prospective ap
plications of this technology, including li

braries, satellite mapping, photo archives
and commercial databases.
He said that most of the applications will
involve storing image-based data rather
than text because the technology is practical
only for very large volumes of data, and
most databases on that scale contain images
rather than text.
Hesselink has been involved in the area
of holographic data storage since
1985, at which time his work
was funded by the Strategic
Defense Initiative program.
He added that although the
program is scheduled for five
years, he expected that once the
engineers produce demonstra
tion models, private corpora
tions will take over the project.
