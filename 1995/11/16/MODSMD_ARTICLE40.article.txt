This film doesn't even pretend tonave
plot — which on some level is ad
mirable. Basically, the main cast has just

graduated from college with no clue as to what to
do with their lives. So they go through a series of
pointless scenes where they try to figure it out.
All the main characters seem to he upper
middle-class white males with dark, black hair
who majored in I nglish. Fortunately, they've
each got different hairstyles which define their
character for us. Red-headed Hric Stoltz ("The
Waterdance") plays the most interesting — al
though peripheral — member of the cast. 1 le is
a l()th-year senior still working on his thesis.
Ironically, as the graduated men worry about
paying off their student loans, Stoltz seems to
have no trouble finding the funds for his 11th
year.
The film paints college students as generally
mindless, hormonal idiots. In one scene, a
freshman girl gives herself to one of the men be
cause, "It just seems like the college thing to do
(giggle)." It sounds a lot like Animal House,but
it isn't funny or outrageous enough to fall into
that category. It fancies itself an artsy film, and
granted, it does have moments where we get to
see new uses of the film medium, but it's fun
damentally still a film-school movie.
There's a lot of Woody Allen-esque shots

and scenes that can't hold a candle to Woody
Allen because the characters are weak and the
actors are even weaker. These people worry
more about how they should say their lines than
what's happening to them in a given scene.
The first 30 minutes has the cast sitting around
spurting lame one-liners. The most painful is the
scene where two characters ponder the eternal
question, "Would you rather lose your mother
... or fuck a cow?" "Fuck a cow." "Cowfucker!"
The film is drowning in an abyss of why-are
women-such-an-enigma-monients. Vet, the
filmmakers still don't know much about the
women. Even some of the actresses are pretty
clueless. Everyone involved seems to think that
a man who's been to Europe, or a man who's
very sensitive, or a man who's got a lot of
money — basically a man who's not like him —
always gets the women. Even the dark, brown
haired guy with the big nose who keeps saying,
"Man, I'd love to fuck her hard," can't figure
out why he hasn 't got a lot of dates.
The filmmakers tried for something fresh
and different. They certainly got something dif
ferent. But the movie's basically a slow, long
frat party, where everyone's in a daze, lost and
horny, but nobody can get it up.
Don't even rent this movie. Wait until it's
four months after graduation and you still
don't have a job. Then rent it. It'll cheer you up.
