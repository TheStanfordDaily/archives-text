The main
characters of

Christopher
1 lampion's directorial debut arc undeniably
fascinating. Dora Carrington (who preferred
to be called by her surname) is a feminist be
fore her time, an accomplished painter who
lives as she likes and with whom she likes.
I ler main passion, however, is for the older,
cynical and openly gay literary critic, Lytton
Strachey.
Their story is set against the backdrop of
early 20th-century England, encompassing
London's intellectual Rloomsbury Croup
and World War I. Rut because the world ol
"Carrington" revolves almost solely around
Carrington and Strachey, their platonic 17-
vear relationship passes as sedately as the
timeless golden light that illuminates many
of the scenes.
It is Jonathan Pryceand Emma Thompson's
performances that save "Carrington" from hav
ing an overly Masterpiece Theater-like am
biance. Pryce, ("Brazil", "Miss Saigon," but per
haps best known to American audiences as the

Infiniti spokesman), plays Lytton Strachey with
a certain flair, l-'ven if you're not well-acquainted
with Strachey's personal habits, you get the idea
that Pryce looks, moves and speaks like Strachey
should. Pryce also gets the best lines in the film
— wry one-liners and wicked epigrams deliv
ered in a drv, sardonic voice that even makes

profanity sound
dignified.
Although Emma
Thompson plays
the title role, she
has less of a chance
to show off her tal
ent. Carrington's
nature becomes in
creasingly melan
choly over time,
and her stubborn
devotion to Stra
chey makes her a
rather pathetic fig
ure. She does,
though, get to have
fairly explicit flings
with an assortment
of lovers, some of
whom Strachey is

also attracted to, although potential menaces it
iroi never make it onscreen.
Although "Carrington" spans so many
years, much of the film feels as if it takes place
in the twilight of these characters' lives. I lamp
ton adds to this sense of bleakness by wisely re
training from painting idealized scenes of the

Knglish countryside or London's artistic mi
lieu. By focusing more on (Harrington's life
than that of her flamboyant companion and
his intellectual world, the film is a quiet, beau
tifully acted study of unrequited passion.
