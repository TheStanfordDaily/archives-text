"But then the big question is, well, what is
reality?" John Cadigan asks in "Out of My
Mind," one of tour documentaries which try
to convey some sense of what reality means
in various situations. Stories of loss, recovery
and connections that exist between viewer
and subject were shown to a rapt audience of
about 250 last Wednesday night at Annen
berg Auditorium.
The four documentaries resonate with in
tense clarity, seamlessly weaving different
perspectives, visual sophistication and com
pelling characters into stories that grip the
viewer from beginning to end.
Four M.A. graduates of the Stanford
Communications Department's Documen
tary Film & Video Program screened their
diploma projects: Sara Whitely's "Requiem,"
Cynthia Wade's "Almost Home," Beth
Cohen's "Farewell Bosnia" and Katie Cadi
gan's "Out of My Mind."
War is given a human face in "Farewell
Bosnia," Cohen's story of two young women,
Alma Kuduzovic and Biba Fladziavdic who
fled the war and are now pursuing educa
tions in the U.S.
"This is a story about migration, losing
your home," Cohen says. Although it is about
Bosnia, it could be "about anyone who's ever
had to migrate because of political reasons or
war." Scenes of the family life they left behind
and interviews with Kuduzovic and Fladzi
avdic arc interspersed with archival footage

of a war that decimated their homes.
Home footage is crucial because it repre
sents family closeness, Cohen says. She want
ed to "create a sense of home, create what it
feels like to have that unexpectedly taken
away from you."
Creating a sense of another sort of loss is
Cadigan's "Out of My Mind." It is her depic
tion about reality suddenly slipping away, told
in first-person narrative through her brother,
John. He has a mental illness, a form of schiz
ophrenia called schizo affective disorder.
Cadigan gauges what it is like to live with
in the experience by allowing the camera to
record her and her family as subjects. "It's
difficult to be a director of a documentary
and be a subject at the same time," Cadigan
says. She enlisted the help of fellow masters
student Cynthia Wade, "whose forte is cine
ma verite" â€” the ability to shoot a scene as
it's unfolding, which allowed for minimal in
trusion into John's life.
Cadigan began the project in 1992 at
John's suggestion, thinking it was going to be
a piece about his recovery. It was painfully
clear it wasn't going to stay on that track.
Since filming ended a year ago, however,
there has been an upswing in John's life,
thanks to a new drug called Clozaril.
In fact, the documentary has inspired
others to make their voices heard. At one
point in his narration, John says, "psychia
try's in the stone age in terms of under
standing the brain." This statement was one
of many that elicited favorable reactions

when the documentary was screened in a
group home of people seriously disabled by
mental illness. As Cadigan relates, their re
action was "beyond my wildest dreams. It
was the first time they felt they had stories
worth telling. A week later, they were lobby
ing their staff to get camcorders to tell their
stories."
"Almost Home" chronicles the lives of two
families living in a homeless shelter in the
Bronx, New York. Wade takes us into their
world through the voices of two unwed
women and their children. The shelter pro
vides a chance to recover from their losses.
Their stories illustrate a bitter poignancy as
they share their frustrations living in a shel
ter, feeling ostracized in a material world

which values them for what they have or
don't have.
Documentaries are an intimate connector
of people's experience with loss, as is dramat
ically revealed in "Requiem." Whitely deals
with the death of her grandmother in a 10-
minute visual extravaganza juxtaposing im
ages of the moon and earth with shots of her
grandmother, her narration running
throughout the documentary.
Lose something everyday and it may be
gone forever. Fortunately, documentaries
record those lost moments and moments of
loss. But instead of escapism through con
ventional feature films, documentaries offer
the viewer grounding in reality, whatever it
means to each of us.
