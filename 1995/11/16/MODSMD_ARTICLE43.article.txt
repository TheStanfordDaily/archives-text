## Arnold Pan Moshed potatoes and scrawny Mr. Whiskers 
### 
In a recent installment of his weekly punk
rock column "Pissed!" Bay Guardian scribe
Johnny Angel lays down the law for clubgo
ing behavior, citing four infractions meriting
expulsion. The third violation Angel calls
"The Create-a-Mosh-Pit-Even-Though-No-
One-Else-Wants-One Gambit," and it's
something that every live rock and roll fan
has endured and suffered. "Why is it that the
largest, most oafish doofuses in the room are
always motivated to start jostling at the
slightest hint of an upbeat number?," Angel
wonders.
The restless shuffle and not-so-gentle
nudges that get the mosh pit going are like
the coming on of a sore throat — that irrita
ble, rotten feeling that's worse than the sick
ness itself. And you're the one who always

catches it, another body forming the human
border at the edge of the fist-to-fisticuft's
where the evolutionary chain makes a sud
den break. Indeed, it's on the periphery that
the usually mild-mannered get super
charged, ready to fight for limb and love for
music. Anxious and devoted, they put their
dukes up for rock and roll, elbowing out the
space they've earned facing the singer / gui
tarist.
Like last month's Superchunk show at the
Fillmore. Rather than taking the band's cue
and pogoing in punk-pop bliss, those most
oafish doofuses rammed and butted each
other, shirtlessly, recklessly, mindlessly. They
punished one another to anything, expected
ly to some of Superchunk's hyper numbers
and unexpectedly to the quartet's slower,

moodier pieces. And as the energy level
peaked to the exhilarating performance on
the stage, so the mosh pit expanded, calling
on the brave souls lined against it into active
duty.
For instance, when a relatively scrawny
fellow — call him "Whiskers" for the downy
strands that hung from his chin — broke
from the moshing pack and began to roll his
bony, sweaty frame on the intent and content
fans around him, he was met by their tolerant
vigilance. Yet, that did little to slow Mr.
Whiskers, who became even more irritating
and infuriating to the good folk around him.
In turn, the mild-mannered types turned
militia-like. One mellow guy excitedly boast
ed about getting a few licks in on him. Oth
ers, realizing the eyc-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth

crccd was better left to the behemoths of the
pit, restrained themselves, fixed their atten
tion on the real show, assured in the knowl
edge that one of the fist-waving, cap-doffing
frat assholes would swat him like a fly.
Only the fittest survive in the pit — which
isn't any better for avid fans who express their
adoration for a band and its music in a more
civil fashion. After all, what's left are the bul
lies who slam dance to Lou Barlow's intro
spective break-up ditties (cf. Sebadoh show
at Slim's last year) like it was death-metal
cock-rock and who rush the stage at a Veloc
ity Girl gig (Dallas, summer 1994) as if that
sugary-pop quartet sounded anything simi
lar to its hard-core brethren from D.C. And
in the end, of course, they're the ones stand
ing next to you.
