The first screening of the documen

documentary is being written and edited
by filmmaker Nancy Brink and produced
and directed by Michael Levin of Stan
ford's Academic Software Development.
Stanford's Committee on Black Per
forming Arts (CPBA) has orchestrated
all of the programs under the heading of
"Dreams of a City: The East Palo Alto
Project." Three years ago, director of the
CBPA and associate professor of drama
Harry Elam initiated the project.
"He was thinking of ways to better in

over the last 70 years.
laborative relationship," said
Elena Becks, coordinator of CBPA
and an East Palo Alto native.
For their model, Elam and oth
ers used a 1970s program at
Brown University, in which play
wrights created performances
based on the oral histories of resi
dents in the community.
Early on, the CBPA estab
lished the East Palo Alto Task
Force, a group of residents and
activists from EPA, as well as
staff, students and faculty mem
bers from Stanford.
"The Task Force has been the
guiding force for the entire pro
ject. We wanted the community to
decide the direction," said Becks.
One member of the community
who shared her ideas was Nevida
Butler, an employee of the Ecu
menical Hunger Program and a
resident of EPA since 1973.
"We wanted the plays to show
both the good and the negative of
the city," said Butler. "People
think it's always bickering, but
there are a lot of good things that
happen here."
Among the good things, Butler
said, are volunteer programs in
which children play tennis, soccer
and football, as well as a Monday
night meal served to the homeless
through the Ecumenical Hunger
Program.
"The other part is the gangs,
the killing," said Butler. "You
have that along with the positive
things."
Butler said she believes that
the plays accurately depict EPA.
"The playwrights really did their
homework," Butler said. Among
the particularly realistic charac
ters Butler cited were "a woman

reading a bible, a woman selling
tamales and a little girl looking
out the window, wanting to play,
but her parents are afraid to let
her outside."
Over the course of the years
during which Moraga and OyamO
were working on their plays, the
Task Force met three times for
community forums. Each forum,
said Becks, focused on a different
subset of the EPA population:
first senior citizens, then Latinos,
then youth. Members of the
forums held readings of the plays
in progress.
The final products, according
to Becks, show EPA at its best and
most varied. Among the residents
profiled in the documentary is
Emily Damant, who came to EPA
in 1917. With her husband,
Damant moved to be a member of
the Utopian community Run
nymede. Damant is now in her
90s.
The invention of Charles
Weeks, Runnymede was a poul
try-based farm that promised
"abundant living close to nature."
Its motto was "One acre and inde
pendence." In a letter to prospec
tive members, Weeks explained
that "a boy that (smokes or
drinks] cannot work on my farm,
as he cannot develop with such a
handicap."
Although Runnymede officially
closed in 1930, the "Dreams of a
City" documentary claims, "The
spirit of Runnymede lives on at
weekly farmers' markets." On
camera, a young man currently
living in EPA holds out "organic
East Palo Alto garlic" and
explains that he calls it "hood gar
lic."
"EPA has an extremely rich
history," said Becks. "It probably
has the oldest history on the
peninsula, with the exception of
San Francisco."

In addition to being home to
Runnymede, Becks said, EPA has
also been the site of a deep water
port, the site of one of the coun
try's largest flower exporting
industries and the home of the
Muwekma Indians. The narrative
of the documentary explains its
aims to showcase such "diversity,
development and change," as well
as to acknowledge EPA's "grow
ing pains as a community."
According to Becks, "the char
acterization for the plays is drawn
from the video." "A Circle in the
Dirt" is centered around the dis
assembly of Ravenswood High
School and the Cooley Apart
ments and focuses on various
racial and ethnic dynamics in
EPA.
"Dancing on the Brink" has a
broader temporal scope, viewing
the history of EPA and looking
towards the future, all through
the eyes of a Muwekma chief.
At performances, organized
discussion groups immediately
follow. At the C£sar Chavez
Academy, both the plays and the
discussions have been "a great
success," said Becks. "They were
really exciting. There were heart
felt discussions about ourselves
and our relationship to the com
munity."
Although the plays will run
only until Nov. 19, "Dreams of a
City" is hardly finished, according
to Becks. "Members of the Task
Force are working with teachers
in the Ravenswood School District
to introduce the [documentary]
into the curriculum of students in
third through eighth grades," said
Becks.
In addition, an exhibit of EPA
artifacts went on display in Stan
ford's Harmony House last Mon
day. Included in the display, said
Becks, are photographs, papers
and oral histories shown on video.

ters Butler cited were "a woman

reading a bible, a woman selling
tamales and a little girl looking
out the window, wanting to play,
but her parents are afraid to let
her outside."
Over the course of the years
during which Moraga and OyamO
were working on their plays, the
Task Force met three times for
community forums. Each forum,
said Becks, focused on a different
subset of the EPA population:
first senior citizens, then Latinos,
then youth. Members of the
forums held readings of the plays
in progress.
The final products, according
to Becks, show EPA at its best and
most varied. Among the residents
profiled in the documentary is
Emily Damant, who came to EPA
in 1917. With her husband,
Damant moved to be a member of
the Utopian community Run
nymede. Damant is now in her
90s.
The invention of Charles
Weeks, Runnymede was a poul
try-based farm that promised
"abundant living close to nature."
Its motto was "One acre and inde
pendence." In a letter to prospec
tive members, Weeks explained
that "a boy that (smokes or
drinks] cannot work on my farm,
as he cannot develop with such a
handicap."
Although Runnymede officially
closed in 1930, the "Dreams of a
City" documentary claims, "The
spirit of Runnymede lives on at
weekly farmers' markets." On
camera, a young man currently
living in EPA holds out "organic
East Palo Alto garlic" and
explains that he calls it "hood gar
lic."
"EPA has an extremely rich
history," said Becks. "It probably
has the oldest history on the
peninsula, with the exception of
San Francisco."

In addition to being home to
Runnymede, Becks said, EPA has
also been the site of a deep water
port, the site of one of the coun
try's largest flower exporting
industries and the home of the
Muwekma Indians. The narrative
of the documentary explains its
aims to showcase such "diversity,
development and change," as well
as to acknowledge EPA's "grow
ing pains as a community."
According to Becks, "the char
acterization for the plays is drawn
from the video." "A Circle in the
Dirt" is centered around the dis
assembly of Ravenswood High
School and the Cooley Apart
ments and focuses on various
racial and ethnic dynamics in
EPA.
"Dancing on the Brink" has a
broader temporal scope, viewing
the history of EPA and looking
towards the future, all through
the eyes of a Muwekma chief.
At performances, organized
discussion groups immediately
follow. At the C£sar Chavez
Academy, both the plays and the
discussions have been "a great
success," said Becks. "They were
really exciting. There were heart
felt discussions about ourselves
and our relationship to the com
munity."
Although the plays will run
only until Nov. 19, "Dreams of a
City" is hardly finished, according
to Becks. "Members of the Task
Force are working with teachers
in the Ravenswood School District
to introduce the [documentary]
into the curriculum of students in
third through eighth grades," said
Becks.
In addition, an exhibit of EPA
artifacts went on display in Stan
ford's Harmony House last Mon
day. Included in the display, said
Becks, are photographs, papers
and oral histories shown on video.

The first screening of the documen

Stanford's Committee on Black Per
forming Arts (CPBA) has orchestrated
all of the programs under the heading of
"Dreams of a City: The East Palo Alto
Project." Three years ago, director of the
CBPA and associate professor of drama
Harry Elam initiated the project.
"He was thinking of ways to better in

over the last 70 years.
laborative relationship," said
Elena Becks, coordinator of CBPA
and an East Palo Alto native.
For their model, Elam and oth
ers used a 1970s program at
Brown University, in which play
wrights created performances
based on the oral histories of resi
dents in the community.
Early on, the CBPA estab
lished the East Palo Alto Task
Force, a group of residents and
activists from EPA, as well as
staff, students and faculty mem
bers from Stanford.
"The Task Force has been the
guiding force for the entire pro
ject. We wanted the community to
decide the direction," said Becks.
One member of the community
who shared her ideas was Nevida
Butler, an employee of the Ecu
menical Hunger Program and a
resident of EPA since 1973.
"We wanted the plays to show
both the good and the negative of
the city," said Butler. "People
think it's always bickering, but
there are a lot of good things that
happen here."
Among the good things, Butler
said, are volunteer programs in
which children play tennis, soccer
and football, as well as a Monday
night meal served to the homeless
through the Ecumenical Hunger
Program.
"The other part is the gangs,
the killing," said Butler. "You
have that along with the positive
things."
Butler said she believes that
the plays accurately depict EPA.
"The playwrights really did their
homework," Butler said. Among
the particularly realistic charac
ters Butler cited were "a woman

reading a bible, a woman selling
tamales and a little girl looking
out the window, wanting to play,
but her parents are afraid to let
her outside."
