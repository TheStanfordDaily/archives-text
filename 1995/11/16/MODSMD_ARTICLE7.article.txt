# Cal, Stanford face off in Hemo Bowl
## Big Game for blood 
### Jeanhee Hong 
The Axe may not be the only tro
phy up for grabs during Big Game
Week. The traditional object of
contention between Stanford and
UC-Berkeley could soon bo joined
by "The Syringe."
This year will mark the first
year for the "Hemo Bowl," a blood
drive competition between Stan
ford and UC-Berkeley which orga
nizers hope will Ijecoine a new tra
dition to support Bay Area blood
banks.
"We realize it might be a fright
ening idea," said Kim Bluitt, pro
gram director of alumni relations
at the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion. "There are a lot of stereotypes
about the donating process, but we
hope that the rivalry with Cal
might help motivate people to over
come their apprehension."
To meet a challenge issued by
Berkeley over the summer, Stan
ford must have a larger jx?rcentage
of donors from its faculty, staff,
students and alumni in the area
than Berkeley. The two-day drive
takes place today from noon to 7:30
p.m. at the Stanford Blood Center,
and Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
