# Cal, Stanford face off in Hemo Bowl
## Big Game for blood 
### Jeanhee Hong 
The Axe may not be the only tro
phy up for grabs during Big Game
Week. The traditional object of
contention between Stanford and
UC-Berkeley could soon bo joined
by "The Syringe."
This year will mark the first
year for the "Hemo Bowl," a blood
drive competition between Stan
ford and UC-Berkeley which orga
nizers hope will Ijecoine a new tra
dition to support Bay Area blood
banks.
"We realize it might be a fright
ening idea," said Kim Bluitt, pro
gram director of alumni relations
at the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion. "There are a lot of stereotypes
about the donating process, but we
hope that the rivalry with Cal
might help motivate people to over
come their apprehension."
To meet a challenge issued by
Berkeley over the summer, Stan
ford must have a larger jx?rcentage
of donors from its faculty, staff,
students and alumni in the area
than Berkeley. The two-day drive
takes place today from noon to 7:30
p.m. at the Stanford Blood Center,
and Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
in the Old Union Clubhouse.
Senior Tara Narula, co-coordi
nator for the Hemo Bowl, said the
event is aimed at promoting "more
awareness of the need for blood,
especially around the holiday sea
son," a time when the need for
blood is high.
"The Cal Alumni Association
runs a blood drive every year before
Big Game. This year, they contact
ed the adviser for STAN (Stanford
Student Alumni Network)" to
make it a competition, said senior
Sung Hwan Cho, president of the
network and the ot her coordinator
for the Hemo Bowl.
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion and STAN an? working in con
junction with the Blood Center, as
well as with organizations at UC-
Berkeley, to mobilize students,
staff, faculty and alumni in the
area to part icipate.
Radio station KM EL will broad

cast live from White Plaza at 1 p.m.
today to publicize the event and
give students a chance to show
their school spirit.
"It elevates the whole competi
tion a little bit, and creates some
thing that is certainly for the pub
lic good," said Jeanne Larkin, a
recruitment consultant at the
Blood Center. Larkin also pointed
out that the need for blood is espe
cially high in this area, as the
Stanford Hospital is the second
highest user of blood in the
nation.
"We hope people will realize
how important it is for people who
are eligible to donate blood," Bluitt
said.
Organizers are tossing around
the idea of adding a new trophy
during Big Game in addition to the
Axe: a syringe, which the winning
school will house each year.
Donors will receive a free T
shirt from the Blood Center, and
will also have a chance to enter a
raffle contest, the winner of which
will be announced at halftime dur
ing Big Game.
