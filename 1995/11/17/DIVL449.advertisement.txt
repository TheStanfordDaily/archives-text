Casper Should Reject Dean Shoven's Recommendation to Close FRI
In his statements in last Friday's Daily regarding the closing of" the Food Research institute,
Dean Shoven is quoted as saying, "We think we can be better at this, have more excellence in
the arena of food research and economic development with a structure centered around
interdisciplinary departments." Later he comments, "We are not getting out of this business.
We are restructuring how we do it." Finally, and incredibly, he flippantly notes that in
considering "what are the central elements of a great university, you don't think of a food
research institute."
This last statement, while probably not made with malicious intent, carelessly denigrates a rich
and long tradition of research and teaching excellence at the Food Research Institute. But
more disconcerting is the way Dean Shoven is trying to have his cake and eat it too. FRI is
not that important, and we can do what they do better in a center, anyway. If this statement
seems disingenuous, it's because it is. During the review process leading up to his decision,
Dean Shoven was presented with numerous reasons why a center could not duplicate the
current work of FRI, and to date he has yet to articulate how "we can be better at this" in a
center.
Shoven's "defense" of his decision in Tuesday's Daily is alarming in its vague appeals to
the inefficiency of having 5 economics departments at Stanford and the lack of comparable
structures elsewhere. These hardly justify closing a successful department, and set a
dangerous precedent for other programs at Stanford. FRl's applied focus makes it unique
from other departments. Why close FRI and not the other programs? The structure works,
why fix it? How about agricultural economics departments at other universities? Why must
we emulate others instead of appreciating FRl's unique history at Stanford? Most
importantly, what is to be gained by such thoughtless "restructuring"?
On the other hand, there are plenty of reasons to believe a center would fail. It all starts with
FRl's Ph.D. program which Shoven proposes to terminate. The program attracts top students
who have a strong motivation to conduct applied research in economic development. Many
have living or work experience in the developing world. At FRI, all students are expected to
conduct fieldwork in a developing country, increasing the relevance of their work and
providing them with excellent training in applied research skills. Graduates make a
difference in the work, ending up at universities, governments, international organizations,
and research centers in the U.S. and around the globe. Can there be a better example of
Stanford's academic mission?
Shoven has hinted that new faculty and research money in the economics department can
support similar work in development. This view betrays a very poor understanding of what
goes on at the Food Research Institute. FRI Ph.D. students are different than those in
economics, who in general have neither the background nor the motivation to do applied
research in development. The record clearly shows that conducting field research abroad, the
heart of FRl's program, is a rarity in the economics department! FRl's critical mass of
faculty with a web of regional and substantive specializations that is the basis of productive
faculty-student interactions cannot possibly be duplicated in a corner of the economics
department.
The bottom line is that without a first-rate Ph.D. program, FRl's best faculty have already
indicated they will leave for other universities. With fewer faculty and no Ph.D. students to
serve as TAs, FRl's highly successful masters program in International Development Policy,
which draws students from around the globe, will be unsustainable. It is naive to believe that
FRI masters students would be attracted to the International Policy Studies program at lIS,
which is much more interdisciplinary and less focused on practical analytical tools.
Amazingly, Tuesday's article makes clear that little thought has gone into this critical aspect
of the proposed "restructuring." On the other hand, loss of faculty means that many
popular FRI international development courses will no longer be offered, undermining the
university's commitment to multicultural and international issues. Is this Shoven's vision of
how "we can be better?" In an interdisciplinary center without its own faculty appointments,
first loyalty will always be to individual departments with vastly differing agendas. Can this
possibly be superior to a focused, highly successful department with its own faculty and
students?
And to top it all off. the university accrues no budgetary savings from the proposed
"restructuring"! The question we keep asking ourselves, then, is why? WHY? Stanford has
not ended a degree-granting program in decades. Unless this question can be answered
convincingly, we urge the President to reject Dena Shoven's recommendation.
