Heroin addict exposed
A man under the influence of heroin
allegedly exposed himself to a woman walk
ing her dog through the parking lot near
Maples Pavilion on Saturday, Stanford
Police said.
Royal Anthony Norman, 45, was sitting in
his parked vehicle near Maples Pavilion
when he saw a woman walking through the
parking lot. He allegedly got out of his air,
approached the woman and hiked up his
shorts to expose his penis.
The woman immediately called 911, and
Stanford Police responded. When officers got
to the scene of the crime, Norman was still in
the parking lot sitting in his car.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said Norman was looking at pornographic
magazines and was about to inject himself
with a loaded syringe of heroin when police
approached him. Police also found a fresh
needle mark on his arm.
Police allegedly found drug paraphernalia
in Norman's car, including hypodermic nee
dles, a spoon and a cooker.
Norman was booked at the Santa Clara
County Jail on charges of indecent expo
sure, being under the influence of heroin
and possession of drug paraphernalia.
Police discovered he was also wanted on a
$10,000 warrant from San Mateo County

for violating parole. Niemeyer said Norman
is still in jail.
Intrepid intruders ignored
Several intruders engaged in their own
variation of "Let's Make a Deal" Nov. 7
when they went through Xanadu at 3:30
a.m. trying to see what was behind various
numbered doors.
The game began when one of the intrud
ers pounded on a student's window and
asked the student to open the outside door
into the house, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said. The intruder said he knew
"Jeff the house manager," but the student
knew there was no house manager named
Jeff. Nevertheless, he decided to let the per
son into the house.
Niemeyer said the intruder then entered
Xanadu with several other people. He
knocked on the door of a student's room. The
student said he opened the door to a very
intoxicated man, 18-20 years old, 5 feet 10
inches tall, 160 pounds, wearing a red tlannel
shirt and wanting alcohol. The individual
simply closed his door on the intruder and
went back to sleep without calling the police.
Niemeyer said the intruder then went to
another room and knocked on the door.
When that resident opened the door, the
intruder told him that he was looking for

alcohol and that the house manager Jeff sent
him to the room. The resident told the
intruder there was no house manager named
Jeff and went back to sleep because he
assumed the intrusion was a "frat prank,"
Niemeyer said.
The intruder then went inside a female's
unlocked room and she awoke to find him
standing by her bed. The intruder told her
that he wanted money and alcohol. She told
him to get out of the room, and he stumbled
out. She also simply went back to bed with
out calling the police, Niemeyer said.
Another male resident awoke to find two
males inside his room crouching by the door.
When he asked them what they were doing,
they threw his wallet at him and ran out of
the room. They had stolen his roommate's
wallet and $15 from his own wallet.
Finally, Niemeyer said, two women awoke
when the intruder knocked on their door.
When the women opened the door, no one
was there, but they heard commotion out
side and saw four or five men running naked
across the parking lot behind 553 Mayfield.
"What you have here is at least two
intruders in the house. No one called the
police and people's doors were unlocked.
That's scary," said Niemeyer. "This is not
normal. The intruders were coming in to rip
people off."
