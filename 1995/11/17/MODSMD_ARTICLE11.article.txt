## Miss Nigeria leaves pageant due to protest 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) â€”
Miss Nigeria withdrew from the Miss World
beauty pageant yesterday, after protests against
her government's execution of nine dissidents,
organizers said.
Human rights groups, trade unions and the
government of the South African province
where the pageant is being held demanded that
it expel Toyin Raji, 23, in a show of solidarity
against Nigeria's military rulers.
Pageant organizers, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that pressure led to Raji's with
drawal hours after she was voted Miss Personal
ity by fellow contestants at the Sun City resort.
It wasn't clear whether Raji left voluntarily.
She wasn't available for comment.
M iss World is to be chosen tomorrow night
from among contestants from 88 countries. The
winner receives $78,000 in prize money, plus
endorsement contracts and entertainment
opportunities.
"The withdrawal of Miss Nigeria will not only
benefit the standing and profile of the organiza
tion and the Miss World pageant in general, but
will also be in the interests of the contestants,
the hosts and sponsors of the pageant," the
North West Province government said in a letter
to the organizers released Wednesday.
Organizers said earlier in the week that Raji
would not be forced out of the pageant, which
they insisted was apolitical, without U.N.
