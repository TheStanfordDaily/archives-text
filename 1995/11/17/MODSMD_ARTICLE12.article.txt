# Fake fat passes nutritionists' test

### 
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - The first
artificial fat that could take every bit of
artery-clogging oil out of potato chips with
out stealing the taste passed its first gov
ernment test yesterday.
Nutritionists told the Food and Drug
Administration they believe olestra is safe
for Americans to eat, although it does have
some unpleasant side effects. But the deci
sion was not unanimous â€” and the FDA's
top food advisers will wrangle over
olestra's safety today before formally rec
ommending whether the chemical should
be sold.
"These are complex and difficult deci
sions," said FDA Commissioner David
Kessler, who sat through the 10-hour
debate. "Whenever you add something to
the food supply of healthy people . . .
you've got to get it right."
The FDA has the final say on olestra
and Kessler wouldn't estimate when that

decision would be made.
Olestra is a synthetic chemical made of
sugar and vegetable oil. It looks like regu
lar fat but is undigestible, passing through
the body without stopping to clog arteries
or fatten hips.
Manufacturer Procter & Gamble Co.
says olestra could help Americans dramat
ically cut their consumption of fat, the
leading cause of heart disease. But critics
say olestra is dangerous, that it acts as a
laxative and robs the body of nutrients.
"I don't think the substance should be in
the food supply," said Columbia University
nutritionist Joan Gussow, who joined two
of the other 13 panelists to criticize olestra.
The FDA by law must let olestra on the
market if it is safe to eat. It can't judge
whether olestra would actually benefit
Americans' diet, something Florida food
safety chief Martha Roberts said she
doubted.
