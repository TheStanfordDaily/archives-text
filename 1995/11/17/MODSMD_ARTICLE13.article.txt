# Serious contender enters Haitian presidential race
## Benoit challenges Aristide's heir 
### 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — One
of Haiti's most popular politicians
announced yesterday he would enter the
Dec. 17 presidential election — the first
serious challenger to President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide's heir apparent.
Victor Benoit, 54, leader of the Nation
al Congress of Democratic Movements,
caught the country by surprise with his
last-minute decision.
Fourteen candidates met Wednesday's
midnight filing deadline for the election to
replace Aristide. Most are practically
unknown to the public — except for Benoit
and Rene Preval, 51, who ran Aristide's
first government before the September

1991 army coup.
Until Benoit stepped forward, Preval
appeared to be a shoe-in as the candidate
of the three-party Lavalas Platform
endorsed by Aristide. Riding on the crest
of Aristide's enormous popularity with
poor Haitians, Lavalas candidates won
more than three-fourths of parliamentary
seats in recent elections.
Benoit, a private high school principal,
is widely respected for his long support of
democracy. He served as education minis
ter in Premier Robert Malval's caretaker
government in 1993-94. His socialist party
is entrenched across the country, drawing
support from many civic organizations.
