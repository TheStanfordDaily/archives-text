# Clinton threatening another budget veto

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Refusing to
bend in a test of wills, President Clinton
threatened anew yesterday to veto the
latest Republican offer to end a three
day partial government shutdown. He
said he was recalling furloughed workers
to process claims for Social Security ben
efits.
Rebutted Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole: "He doesn't want a balanced budget.
. . . That's the issue."
With the two sides seemingly at grid
lock, Democrats savaged House Speaker
Newt Gingrich for claiming Clinton had
snubbed him recently aboard Air Force
One, and for saying he had toughened
his terms on the budget battle as a
result.
Several lawmakers trooped to the
House floor with oversized copies of the
front page of the New York Daily News. It
bore a huge headline of "Cry Baby" and a
cartoon depicting Gingrich in a diaper,
holding a baby bottle and throwing a
tantrum.
At three days, the partial shutdown was
the longest ever arising from one of the
nation's periodic budget wars. And bar
ring an unexpected concession from one
side or the other, it seemed likely to
stretch into next week.
Republicans are hoping to pass a sepa
rate measure containing their balanced
budget plan by the weekend. Clinton has
threatened to reject it, as well, and Repub
licans and Democrats alike said they
doubted serious compromise talks would

begin until that veto had been cast.
The Republican leaders repeatedly
expressed a willingness to reopen talks
with Clinton on ending the impasse that
has forced huge sections of the govern
ment to remain closed since Tuesday and
disrupted normal treasury borrowing.
Gingrich, R-Ga., offered to meet last
night.
At the same time, the Republican-con
trolled Senate ignored Clinton's veto
threat. It labored to pass legislation that
would reopen the government through
Dec. 5 on condition Clinton agree to work
out a seven-year balanced budget, based
on Congressional Budget Office economic
assumptions.
The House approved the measure early
yesterday, 277-151, with 48 Democrats in
favor. Democratic lawmakers said Clinton
had lobbied them by telephone shortly
before the vote to make sure the margin of
support wasn't big enough to override his
threatened veto.
It wasn't, but only by a dozen votes.
And Clinton was told in one conversation
that the time had come to begin thinking
about a "gracious exit" from the standoff,
said one lawmaker who recounted the
exchange on condition of anonymity.
With Republicans insisting on a seven
year time frame, both sides were dancing
around the key issue of economic assump
tions â€” estimates of growth, unemploy
ment and inflation that have a major
impact on government spending and rev
enue estimates.
