# Attorney General discloses diagnosis with Parkinson's
## Reno stays strong 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” With medication controlling the
shaking of her left hand, Attorney General Janet Reno says
her newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease will neither force
her from office nor cease her long weekend walks along the
Potomac River.
"I feel fine now. I continue to take my long walks," the 57-
year-old attorney general said at her weekly news conference
yesterday."I don't feel like I have any impairment. I feel
strong and feel like moving ahead."
She has "an excellent, long-term prognosis," her doctor,
Jonathan Pincus, a neurology professor at Georgetown Uni
versity Medical Center, said at a later news conference. "Her
mild tremor was completely eliminated with modest doses,"
of medication, he said.
Reno disclosed that she was diagnosed three weeks ago
with the progressive disease that undermines muscle con
trol. Doctors assured her that, like hundreds of thousands of
other Americans with Parkinson's, she could continue work
ing without impairment.
For reporters, who previously had noted a tremor in her
hand, Reno thrust out a steady left hand to demonstrate that
medication has controlled her only symptom. She takes 1 1/2
Sinemet pills before each of her three daily meals.
Earlier in the morning, Reno had advised the White
House. She said chief of staff Leon Panetta "was very sup
portive." President Clinton telephoned Reno later in the day.
"The president has complete confidence now, as he
always did, that the attorney general will continue to pursue
her job in the excellent manner she has in the past," said a
statement issued by the White House press office.
Reno made clear she had no intention of resigning and
said if Clinton won a second term and "if he wanted me back,
this would be no reason not to do it."
"If I didn't think I could do the job, I'd be the first to tell
President Clinton," Reno said. "Based on everything the
doctors told me and what I know, there should be no reason
why, if the president wanted me to come back in a second
term, I wouldn't do so."
