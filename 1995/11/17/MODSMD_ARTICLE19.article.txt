Stanford students have no excuse for apathy

DID YOU HEAR Jesse Jackson
speak last Tuesday? Were you one
of the many who repeated after
him when he signaled? Did you applaud
when you liked what he said? Did you
also walk away thinking "Yeah, he's a
great speaker, but I'm hungry and late
for my 1:15 class?"
I decided to join a small group on the
march to Hoover Tower, but if I'd had a
1:15 class, would I even have done that?
For those of us who support affirmative
action, it's really inspiring to hear a great
speaker talk on the issue, but it's so easy
to just walk away afterward. It's easy to
listen to Jackson say it's up to us to

change the world and then walk away —
we have classes, we have "futures."
I was disappointed that so few people
followed the crowd to Hoover Tower and
then to the Hoover Institute to protest
UC Regent Glenn Campbell's support of
anti-affirmative action policy. This is
Stanford. I thought I was coming to a
place that was alive with activism. Yet,
out of thousands of students, only 100
or so followed Jackson's speech with a
simple action. What about all of you who
cheered for Jackson? If you really care,
then why didn't you take action? Yes,
registering to vote is the first step, but
it's so easy to do just a little bit more,

especially when the opportunity presents
itself as the march to Hoover Tower did.
When we got to the Hoover Institute,
a man came out and said that we had no
right to be there, that we sounded like
barking dogs and that "this doesn't hap
pen at Stanford." Yikes! It's precisely
because of people like this that we need
to take action.
I didn't go to the UC Regents meeting
yesterday because I had too much work
— that's such an easy excuse. It's so
easy to bury ourselves in academia, but
we can't. So many students, myself
included, are hypocrites to cheer for
Jackson and then promptly go back to

our studies without a second thought.
What does that say about our charac
ters? We have no excuse.
I'm tired of being a hypocrite. Jack
son's was the second speech I've heard
in my month and a half at Stanford that
made me feel guilty for not devoting my
whole life to a cause I believe in.
While I'm not going to drop every
thing to advocate affirmative action, I'm
going to take the little bit of initiative
necessary to become an act ive advocate
for something because I'm sick of being
a part of the apathetic majority.
