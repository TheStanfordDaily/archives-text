# Straight from Casper's wallet?
## Fund targets innovative projects 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
The Stanford Language Center has ambi
tious plans to revolutionize language instruction
at Stanford with state-of-the-art technology and
teaching methods. But those plans will cost
money.
Fortunately, the Language Center will re
ceive a $300,000 boost from the President's
Fund, which will also benefit six other groups.
The fund, established last year by University
President Gerhard Casper, gives money to pro
jects on campus which might otherwise lack
funding. Casper selects projects based on their

abilities to "enhance academic
innovation," according to Di
rector of Development Nancy
Wells.
Along with the Language
Center, Casper's gifts this year
range from investing $450,000
in preserving the quality of
Stanford's faculty to spending
$150,000 each on graduate re
search workshops in the hu-

inanities and graduate research opportunities.
"The President's Fund is a wonderful alloca
tion for an interesting range of programs," Wells
said. "It represents a generosity at an annual

level that is very impressive."
This year, the fund distributed a total of $1.97
million to seven different beneficiaries, still
falling slightly short, however, of its $'2 million
target. Last year, the fund received $1.54 mil
lion, exceeding its $1 million goal.
Monies for the fund come from private sup
porters, each of whom must give a minimum of
$10,000 annually. These donors "represent a
cross-section of some of the University's
strongest supporters," Wells said.
The fund's "very purpose and value — to en
courage and reward academic innovation at


Casper
Stanford — remains constant and
compelling," Casper said in a
report released last month to
members of the President's Fund.
"Thus, we continue to invest in
our greatest resources, our stu
dents and faculty, whose pioneer
ing spirit and passion for ideas dis
tinguish the University."
Part of the $300,000 in funds
given to the Language Center will
support a historic reconstruction
of Building 30, where the center

will be housed.
"The future is extraordinarily
bright for language instruction at
Stanford," said Elizabeth Bern
hardt-Kamil, the center's director.
The President's Fund will also
support The High Wire Press, an
electronic publishing project
which was one of the first organi
zations to attempt large-scale pub
lication of academic materials over
the Internet.
With additional money from
the President's Fund, the press is
planning to collaborate with the
Stanford University Press to dis
tribute works to international
readers which focus on Latin

America.
"These funds are a sure sign of
support from the president," said
University Librarian Michael
Keller, publisher of the High Wire
Press.
The $450,000 in funding given
to "Preserving the Quality of Stan
ford's Education" will be used to
retain high-quality faculty, the
report said. In particular, the
funds supported new appoint
ments in the music and computer
science departments.
The fund will also support the
creation of staff positions for six
information resource specialists
who will keep faculty abreast of

new technology.
The Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, which received $279,000
in funding, plans to use the money
to address several long-term
needs. The preserve will imple
ment a data management program
to improve its efficiency. In addi
tion, the funds will support a
hydrological assessment of the
Searsville Lake watershed along
the San Francisquito Creek.
Phillipe Cohen, administrative
director of the preserve, called the
funds "manna from heaven."
"I was amazed at the respon
siveness of the University to
reward new ideas and initia

tives," he said. "These funds
were absolutely central. It made
my year."
Humanities departments will
use their share of the funds for
research workshops between fac
ulty and graduate students to dis
cuss common issues. Located at
the Stanford Humanities Center,
the program will allow visiting
scholars to discuss academic issues
with students.
"It is terrific that we are able to
get support for research in the
humanities from the president,"
said Keith Baker, director of the
Stanford Humanities Center.
"This gift opens up some very

exciting possibilities."
Money allocated to Graduate
Research Opportunities will sup
port graduate student projects.
While many praised the presi
dent's funding decisions, Council
of Presidents member Mike Choo,
who also received a copy of the
report, said he felt Casper could be
more public about the way he
decides to use the money.
"Although it's a discretionary
fund, it's still a very large sum of
money," he said. "I think he could
be more public about his initia
tives for the year, and there
should be public discussion about
the fund."

"These funds are a sure sign of
support from the president," said
University Librarian Michael
Keller, publisher of the High Wire
Press.
The $450,000 in funding given
to "Preserving the Quality of Stan
ford's Education" will be used to
retain high-quality faculty, the
report said. In particular, the
funds supported new appoint
ments in the music and computer
science departments.
The fund will also support the
creation of staff positions for six
information resource specialists
who will keep faculty abreast of

new technology.
The Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, which received $279,000
in funding, plans to use the money
to address several long-term
needs. The preserve will imple
ment a data management program
to improve its efficiency. In addi
tion, the funds will support a
hydrological assessment of the
Searsville Lake watershed along
the San Francisquito Creek.
Phillipe Cohen, administrative
director of the preserve, called the
funds "manna from heaven."
"I was amazed at the respon
siveness of the University to
reward new ideas and initia

tives," he said. "These funds
were absolutely central. It made
my year."
Humanities departments will
use their share of the funds for
research workshops between fac
ulty and graduate students to dis
cuss common issues. Located at
the Stanford Humanities Center,
the program will allow visiting
scholars to discuss academic issues
with students.
"It is terrific that we are able to
get support for research in the
humanities from the president,"
said Keith Baker, director of the
Stanford Humanities Center.
"This gift opens up some very

exciting possibilities."
Money allocated to Graduate
Research Opportunities will sup
port graduate student projects.
While many praised the presi
dent's funding decisions, Council
of Presidents member Mike Choo,
who also received a copy of the
report, said he felt Casper could be
more public about the way he
decides to use the money.
"Although it's a discretionary
fund, it's still a very large sum of
money," he said. "I think he could
be more public about his initia
tives for the year, and there
should be public discussion about
the fund."
