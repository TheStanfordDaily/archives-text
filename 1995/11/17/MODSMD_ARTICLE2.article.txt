# Straight from Casper's wallet?
## Fund targets innovative projects 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
The Stanford Language Center has ambi
tious plans to revolutionize language instruction
at Stanford with state-of-the-art technology and
teaching methods. But those plans will cost
money.
Fortunately, the Language Center will re
ceive a $300,000 boost from the President's
Fund, which will also benefit six other groups.
The fund, established last year by University
President Gerhard Casper, gives money to pro
jects on campus which might otherwise lack
funding. Casper selects projects based on their

abilities to "enhance academic
innovation," according to Di
rector of Development Nancy
Wells.
Along with the Language
Center, Casper's gifts this year
range from investing $450,000
in preserving the quality of
Stanford's faculty to spending
$150,000 each on graduate re
search workshops in the hu-

inanities and graduate research opportunities.
"The President's Fund is a wonderful alloca
tion for an interesting range of programs," Wells
said. "It represents a generosity at an annual

level that is very impressive."
This year, the fund distributed a total of $1.97
million to seven different beneficiaries, still
falling slightly short, however, of its $'2 million
target. Last year, the fund received $1.54 mil
lion, exceeding its $1 million goal.
Monies for the fund come from private sup
porters, each of whom must give a minimum of
$10,000 annually. These donors "represent a
cross-section of some of the University's
strongest supporters," Wells said.
