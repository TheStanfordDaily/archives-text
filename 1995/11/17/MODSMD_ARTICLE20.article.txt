# Shen's comments at Jackson speech belittled students
## 
### 
I had some serious problems with Bill
Shen's introduction of Jesse Jackson on
Tuesday. The focus of the day was affirma
tive action. However, Shen felt that he
should use our valuable time to inform us
about the Food Research Institute and the
screening of some movie. These issues had
absolutely nothing to do with affirmative
action and seemed to be a plug for Shen's
own political agenda rather than affirma
tive action.
I also found it rather disturbing that
Shen encouraged us to "take time away
from our golf and sailing classes" and get
involved. First, it seemed to me to be a bla
tant stab at Stanford students (that they
spend their time doing frivolous things).
Given that most of the people in the audi
ence were Stanford students, this was
probably not a good idea. Wasn't he stereo
typing Stanford students? Surely, some
students don't take golf and sailing class
es. This stereotype was coupled with the
appellation "white hairs," which Shen
used when he mentioned the people

opposed to affirmative action (again, I'm
sure some of these people do not have
white hair).
We all learn in our freshman writing
classes to challenge ideas, not people.
The speech was certainly weakened by
these stereotypies and, furthermore, the
whole idea of stereotypes seemed to con
tradict the goals of affirmative action.
