# University should allow the ASSU to run Co Ho again
## 
### 
During the early '80s, there was a
magical atmosphere at the Coffee House.
This was largely because it was run by
the ASSU. Then suddenly, the students
running it were discredited by the Tresid
der staff. The incoming food concession
aires said bad things about the students
— things which the Tresidder staff
apparently wanted to hear — and poof,
the students lost in the "competitive" bid
ding process for the renewal of their
leas®.
The outraged students opened up a
small espresso bar at the international

center in bitter protest. Over time, the
grandiose promises of renovation and
expansion from the new concessionaires
were forgotten. Instead, within a couple
of years, prices jumped about 60 per
cent. The protesting students eventually
graduated into oblivion and the espresso
bar slowly faded.
The University should now give the
ASSU an opportunity to take back
Tresidder Express and / or the Coffee
House. Students, make no mistake
about it — you are being targeted for
your money at their cash registers (more
so than if I were to open up a panhan
dling table in White Plaza).
