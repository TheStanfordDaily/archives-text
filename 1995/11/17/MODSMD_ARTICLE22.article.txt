# Conduct at grapes panel was unfair and disrespectful
## 
### 
After I came back from the grapes
panel last Monday, I sat down to write a
letter expressing my disgust at the per
sonal attacks and evasion of questions
by both Dolores Huerta and Phillip
Maxwell (the president of the United
Farm Workers and a local grower,

respectively), as well as the extremely
disrespectful behavior of the audience. I
had written about half a page when I
realized that, like those mentioned
above, I would simply be venting my
anger instead of educating or working
towards a resolution.
I would therefore like to make a sim
ple request to Stanford students: Please
respect people and their ideas. It is pos
sible to have rational, even heated dis
cussions about controversial topics with
out resorting to personal attacks. When
arguing, truth must always be the final
goal — humiliation of the opposition is
never constructive.
Please consider the merits of ideas
regardless of the characters of their pro
ponents. Finally, be as radical or reac
tionary as you must, but always be will
ing to question your own ideas and
assumptions; conviction is not decreased
by open-rnindedness.
Next time you see someone preaching
in White Plaza, or hear a statement you
find offensive, talk with the person and
find out where they are coming from. You
could both end up learning something.
