## Sorry, y'all asked for it! 
### 
I'M NOT SURE who said originality is
the art of concealing one's source. But I
do know who said, sometimes, the best
story is the one that happens.
And about 10 years ago, before I knew
tmy of that, I walked into a bathroom at a
ski hxlge in New Mexico and learned the
truth. Above the apparently semi-func
tional toilet was a sign in polite red type:
"Please hold handle down for 5 seconds
when you flush." Scrawled underneath the
message in black marker was the prophet
ic qualifier: "... 25 if you're from Texas."
Journalism lesson No. 37: the news peg.
I wouldn't have had a single reason or
right to even mention y'all under normal
circumstances, but then you had to start
this foolish club. You had to plaster your
smiling faces and flags all over The Daily,
as if to say, "Hey, Gohlke, make fun of
me!" You had to make it so damn easy.
Well, I've got an idea. Now that we've
got all of you in one room, let's call up
Charter by United and fly you to Quebec.
Just as I told those cranky Quebecois, "The
French already have a country. It's called
France;" so I inform the Texas Club's
membership, "Texans already have a club
— it's allied the NIIA."
What could be worse than 15 million
people galloping around the desert, wear
ing big hats to compensate for their small
penises? Perhaps 40 of them trying to get
the whole thing started anew in my state.
Never has a group of people been more

convinced that size is everything. The only
recommendation Texans can give them
selves is just how enormous the place is, as
if they're in a perpetual geographical lock
er-room brag-session: "Texas is the best
'cause it's really big! Yee-hah!" By that
logic, Canada is one of the best countries in
the world.
Perhaps the most poignant aspect of
Texans' size fixation is that Texas isn't
even the largest state. Ever since 1959,
they have been reduced to innocuous con
structions such as "the biggest contiguous
state." Not only does Texas lose in its cho
sen category — it loses to Alaska.
Texans also tend to constantly boast of
their erstwhile independence: "Yee-hah!
Our state was once a country!" But so was
Crete. And Canada is a country, right now.
The requirements are obviously not that
stringent.
So what is so big about Texas? The
insects? The barometer readings?
"I've been to Texas," said senior Jesse
Damm. "It's miserable. Just roaches. And
that place, Whattaburger. You can get
Whattashakes and Whattafries, it's
stupid."
One sophomore pointed out a possible
danger of Texans' well-known fashion
frailties.
"The thing about Texas is they still
wear cowboy boots there," said Arizonan
Chris Babbitt. "You could be having an
operation and your surgeon might be wear

ing spurs."
Most common were expressions of mild
contempt toward the almost-the-biggest
state.
"They dress all in glitter there," said
senior David Rochefort, vice president of
the Stanford Massachusetts Society. "Gut
ter boots. Glitter shoes. And they like big
cars. It's very tacky. I've only been to
Texas once, though."
I tried to remind these Texophobes of all
Texas has given us: George Bush, the Fab
ulous Thunderbirds, Phil Gramm, chain
saws, David Koresh, Chili's.
"It's Denny's with decorative tile and
free coasters," some said of the latter.
But beyond the fast answers, all the
non-Texans I spoke with had a single ques
tion: "Can't they secede?" Americans cer
tainly carry around some historical touchi
ness over secession, but it seems much of
that has worn off, especially with regard to
the just-about-the-hugest state. It could be
a lengthy diplomatic process, but I don't
think anyone wants to fight a civil war over
pecans, especially if you're going to pro
nounce it that way.
I'm not saying the accent makes you
sound uneducated. I'm saying it makes you
sound really stupid.

Dun 7 mess with Josh Gohlke.
