## Stanford football out to bring the Axe back home Cal head coaching job, Cardinal bowl hopes on the line this time 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
One team is suffering through a depressing year. The
other is shooting lor a bowl. One coach's job hangs by a
string, and the other's couldn't be safer.
Big Game must be here.
Last year, Bill Walsh was widely rumored to be leaving the
building as Stanford staggered to a 3-6-1 mark heading into
the California contest. The Cardinal didn't quite come out of
the gates trying to save its coach, as California raced to a 14-
0 lead at about the "rocket's red glare" portion of the anthem.
Cal kept the Axe with a 24-23 win.
"Last year, the Big Game was our whole season," said
senior tackle Jeff Buckey. "And we lost by a point. It turned
out like the whole season."
This year, Big Game presents Cal with an opportunity to
salvage a dismal campaign. Coach Keith Gilbertson is in trou-

ble, and nobody has rushed
to the beleaguered man's
defense. In fact, for much of
the season, Cal hasn't
defended much of anything.
A win for the Gilber might
send the coach back to the
sidelines for another season,
but chances are, Gilbertson
will have to settle for, at
best, a better sendoff than
Walsh.

On the Cardinal side of the
story, in 1994, a frustrated Mark Butterfield watched as
Walsh handed Scott Frost the reins of an injury-depleted
offense. Butterfield always believed he should have played
instead of Frost. Frost now waits his turn at Nebraska, while
Butterfield has exceeded everybody's expectations.
"I'm going to be playing this year," Butterfield said. "I was
disappointed that I wasn't playing [last year]. It was hard to
sit on the sidelines when the team was losing."
Butterfield no longer sits on the sidelines, and losing is no
longer a Cardinal habit. Coach Tyrone Willingham returns to
his first Big Game since 1991, when he served as the running
backs coach under Dennis Green.
"I think you always miss the atmosphere of the Big Game
if you've been involved with it," Willingham said. "It's one of
the few games that you start preparation for two weeks
before. I don't know anywhere else in the country that that is

the case. It's really enjoyable. It
sets the mood for what you have
to do that Saturday afternoon."
Last year, Big Game marked
the end for both teams. This
year, Stanford hopes it is merely
a springboard to game No. 12.
With a win, the 7-3-1 Cardinal
would stake its claim to a bowl
game. Stanford hopes its season
will end the same way that Will
ingham's last season with the
Cardinal concluded — with a trip
to Honolulu for the Aloha Bowl.
"We spoke to the fact that we
wanted to play 12 games this
year," Willingham said. "That
was one of our major goals. It has
always been in our structure that
if we play as hard as we can, as
smart as we can, for as long as we
can, that gives us our best oppor
tunity to win a game. And it is
the accumulation of those wins
that will give us a 12th game."
On paper, Stanford gets its
Axe and Gilbertson gets his. In
the paper, Glenn Dickey writes
that "Willingham's total lack of
charisma has rubbed off on the
Stanford team." On the field, the
Cardinal will determine if it will
step on the field another time in
19915.

Senior quarterback Mark Butterfield has a much different perspec

snaps after Steve Stenstrom went down with an injury.
