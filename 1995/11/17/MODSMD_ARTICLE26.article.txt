## Stanford football out to bring the Axe back home Cal head coaching job, Cardinal bowl hopes on the line this time 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
One team is suffering through a depressing year. The
other is shooting lor a bowl. One coach's job hangs by a
string, and the other's couldn't be safer.
Big Game must be here.
Last year, Bill Walsh was widely rumored to be leaving the
building as Stanford staggered to a 3-6-1 mark heading into
the California contest. The Cardinal didn't quite come out of
the gates trying to save its coach, as California raced to a 14-
0 lead at about the "rocket's red glare" portion of the anthem.
Cal kept the Axe with a 24-23 win.
"Last year, the Big Game was our whole season," said
senior tackle Jeff Buckey. "And we lost by a point. It turned
out like the whole season."

the season, Cal hasn't
defended much of anything.
A win for the Gilber might

sidelines for another season,
but chances are, Gilbertson
will have to settle for, at
best, a better sendoff than
Walsh.

On the Cardinal side of the
story, in 1994, a frustrated Mark Butterfield watched as
Walsh handed Scott Frost the reins of an injury-depleted
offense. Butterfield always believed he should have played
instead of Frost. Frost now waits his turn at Nebraska, while
Butterfield has exceeded everybody's expectations.
"I'm going to be playing this year," Butterfield said. "I was
disappointed that I wasn't playing [last year]. It was hard to
sit on the sidelines when the team was losing."
Butterfield no longer sits on the sidelines, and losing is no
longer a Cardinal habit. Coach Tyrone Willingham returns to
his first Big Game since 1991, when he served as the running
backs coach under Dennis Green.
"I think you always miss the atmosphere of the Big Game
if you've been involved with it," Willingham said. "It's one of
the few games that you start preparation for two weeks
before. I don't know anywhere else in the country that that is
