# Ducks, Beavers up next for No. 4 spikers
## Cardinal on verge of first undefeated Pac-10 season in four years 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team
(22-2 overall, 16-0 Pacific 10 Conference) looks
to finish the first undefeated conference season
by any team in four years when it travels to Ore
gon this weekend for road matches against Ore
gon (8-19, 2-14) and Oregon State (11-15, 5-11).
"Our first goal was to win the [conference],"
said head coach Don Shaw. "It's nice to get that
goal out of the way. Another [of our goals] is to
stay undefeated in the Pac-10. We don't plan on
losing any more matches."
During its unimpeded march through league
play, the Cardinal has established itself as the
team to beat. Despite playing one of the most
difficult schedule in the country, Stanford has
won 20 consecutive matches. In Pac-10 play, the
Cardinal has lost just six games in 10 matches.
"We're playing really well right now," Shaw
said. "We just try to prepare ourselves against
the best possible schedule so that we'll be ready
for the competition in the tournament."
Stanford has used its contests to improve its
passing drastically over the course of the season.
Whereas early in the year, senior setter / outside
hitter Gary Wendell and sophomore setter / out
side hitter Lisa Sharpley were forced to send
passes almost exclusively to the outside hitters,
the Cardinal's improved passing has opened up
the middle of the offense and has given Stanford
additional options.
Oregon enters tonight's contest as the con
ference cellar dweller. Despite having lost its
last two, the Ducks are playing well of late, hav
ing recently teamed with arch-rival Oregon
State to sweep the nationally-ranked Arizona
schools.
Meanwhile, Oregon State ranks eighth in the
Pac-10 but is 4-3 at home in Corvallis.
"[Our matches against them in Maples|
weren't easy matches," Shaw said. "Both of
those teams have some talent, and Oregon State
in particular will be tough at home."
