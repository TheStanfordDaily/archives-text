# Water polo rivalry to continue at deGuerre
## Stanford seeks Big Splash though Bears lead season series 2-1 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
It's that time of year again. With the end of
the first quarter rapidly approaching, so too
are the regular seasons of the fall sports inex
orably drawing to a close. For the Stanford
men's water polo team, this means only one
thing â€” it's time to beat Cal.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (14-9, 3-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will
square off against its nemesis from across the
Bay tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m. before
Big Game. The deceptively delightful-sound
ing Big Splash will mark the fourth time this
year that the Cardinal and Golden Bears have
matched up.
The Bears hold the edge on the seasonal
series to date, having taken two of three. Cal
secured a 7-5 victory in a sloppy game during
the Southern California Tournament and
trounced the Cardinal 15-10 in a league game

at Cal. Stanford notched its victory in the
semifinals of the Northern California Tourna
ment 13-11.
But all of that is history. While Big Splash
has little concrete significance, there is still no
fiercer rivalry than between the Cardinal and
the Bears.
"This game has no real significance as far
as qualifying for the NCAA tournament, or for
league standing or anything like that goes,"
said Cardinal head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"But it is still the biggest individual game of
the season, and we want to win. I'm sure that
the guys are going to be up for this game."
Besides providing an opportunity for the
Cardinal to demonstrate that it is finally firing
on all cylinders, tomorrow's contest will serve
as a prognosticator's tool. In 15 of the last 22
Big Splash encounters, the winner has gone
on to win the national championship.
To the victor goes the spoils.
Yet, it should not come as a surprise that

whichever team has won Big Splash has seen
such success in the NCAA tournament. Indeed,
Stanford and Cal are the two most decorated
water polo teams in collegiate history. In the 28
years of the NCAA water polo tourney, either
the Cardinal or Cal has emerged atop the heap
19 times. The Cardinal has captured nine
national championships, while Cal has notched
11. Either Stanford or Cal has played in 22 of
the last 26 national championship games,
including the last 15 in a row, and the two
squads have met in the final round six times.
While a victory tomorrow will grant brag
ging rights, the game is also significant for the
Cardinal in terms of team development.
"In the back of our minds, we are thinking
ahead to the conference tournament," Detta
manti said. "This game should be a good test
to see where we are. We should be peaking
right now and playing our best polo."
As in last week's 14-4 victory
over Pacific, Dettamanti plans on
substituting heavily. He hopes to
utilize all 12 of his field players,
though freshman Arturo Rodelo
is questionable due to a sprained
shoulder. Junior Brian Wallin,
who leads the squad with 64
points, had a touch of the stom
ach flu earlier in the week, but
has been practicing since Wednes
day. Otherwise, Dettamanti's
players are at full strength.
In addition to a relatively free
substitution scheme, Dettamanti
plans to introduce a new wrinkle to
the Cardinal strategy. Senior Jere
my Laster has been given the green
light to play the center-forward
position on approximately one
third of the Cardinal possessions.
Ideally, this small change will
reap twofold benefits. With
Laster assuming a greater mantle
of responsibility for the grueling
two-meter spot, Wallin will be
able to rest more, hopefully
increasing the effectiveness of his
already prolific scoring abilities.
In addition, since he will normal
ly be guarded by the opposing
team's center-forward, Laster
will attempt to draw kickouts in
an effort to get that key player
removed from the game.
Against Cal, this second goal
assumes even greater importance.
The Bears boast an excellent two
meter man in Brent Albright.
Albright is a big left-hander (6-
foot-6, 220 pounds) and paces his
team with 44 points.
"I think that Albright may be
the best hole man in the countrv

this year," Dettamanti said. "He
hasn't scored as many goals as
Brian [Wallin], but they don't rely
on him as much as we do on
Wallin. They spread their scoring
around quite a bit."
Senior Nick Kittredge ranks as
the Bears' second-highest scorer
with 33 points. When the Cardinal
last faced Cal, Kittredge scored
four points, including a two-point
er. Notching 29 points to date,
freshman Ryan Flynn rounds out
the top three scorers for the Bears
and also serves as one of the pri
mary backups to Albright in the
two-meter spot. Several other Cal

players have registered over 20
points. By contrast, only Wallin,
senior Daniel Lehoczky (35
points) and Laster (34) have
exceeded the 20-point mark.
"Cal doesn't have one guy that
they go to all the time," Detta
manti said. "That makes them
tough to play because you can't
key in on individuals. They can
get goals lots of different ways
from lots of different people. We
are just going to have to play good
team defense."
Thus, tomorrow's game will
provide a glimpse at where the
Cardinal stands. A victory would

serve as a statement that, despite
suffering a number of disappoint
ing setbacks during the course of
the season, Dettamanti's squad is
poised to make a run in the post
season.
"We have had good practices
all week," Dettamanti said. " I
think that we are ready to go. We
are still preparing for the confer
ence tournament, but we still
want to play well. A victory is
important to give us the confi
dence we need going into the
league championships."
And of course, it's just plain
fun to beat Cal.
