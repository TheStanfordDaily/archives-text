# Water polo rivalry to continue at deGuerre
## Stanford seeks Big Splash though Bears lead season series 2-1 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
It's that time of year again. With the end of
the first quarter rapidly approaching, so too
are the regular seasons of the fall sports inex
orably drawing to a close. For the Stanford
men's water polo team, this means only one
thing â€” it's time to beat Cal.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (14-9, 3-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will
square off against its nemesis from across the
Bay tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m. before
Big Game. The deceptively delightful-sound
ing Big Splash will mark the fourth time this
year that the Cardinal and Golden Bears have
matched up.
The Bears hold the edge on the seasonal
series to date, having taken two of three. Cal
secured a 7-5 victory in a sloppy game during
the Southern California Tournament and
trounced the Cardinal 15-10 in a league game

at Cal. Stanford notched its victory in the
semifinals of the Northern California Tourna
ment 13-11.
But all of that is history. While Big Splash
has little concrete significance, there is still no
fiercer rivalry than between the Cardinal and
the Bears.
"This game has no real significance as far
as qualifying for the NCAA tournament, or for
league standing or anything like that goes,"
said Cardinal head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"But it is still the biggest individual game of
the season, and we want to win. I'm sure that
the guys are going to be up for this game."
Besides providing an opportunity for the
Cardinal to demonstrate that it is finally firing
on all cylinders, tomorrow's contest will serve
as a prognosticator's tool. In 15 of the last 22
Big Splash encounters, the winner has gone
on to win the national championship.
To the victor goes the spoils.
Yet, it should not come as a surprise that

whichever team has won Big Splash has seen
such success in the NCAA tournament. Indeed,
Stanford and Cal are the two most decorated
water polo teams in collegiate history. In the 28
years of the NCAA water polo tourney, either
the Cardinal or Cal has emerged atop the heap
19 times. The Cardinal has captured nine
national championships, while Cal has notched
11. Either Stanford or Cal has played in 22 of
the last 26 national championship games,
including the last 15 in a row, and the two
squads have met in the final round six times.
While a victory tomorrow will grant brag
ging rights, the game is also significant for the
Cardinal in terms of team development.
"In the back of our minds, we are thinking
ahead to the conference tournament," Detta
manti said. "This game should be a good test
to see where we are. We should be peaking
right now and playing our best polo."
