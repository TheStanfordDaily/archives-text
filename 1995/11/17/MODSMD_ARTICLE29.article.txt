# Cardinal seeks end to Cal's two-year Big Game win streak

Forget the standings. Burn the statistics. It's Big Game
and the rules that normally govern football no longer apply.
In the 98th installation of one of college football's most
storied rivalries, Stanford (6-3-1 overall, 4-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) hosts California (3-7, 2-5) at 12:30 p.m. tomorrow in
Stanford Stadium.
Cal, mired in a losing season, may enter the contest as a
nine-point underdog, but in a series with more improbable
endings than any other, a betting man would have to be crazy
to expect the Cardinal to win easily — if it manages to win at
all. Forty-five of the previous 97 Big Games have been decid
ed by one touchdown or less, and the favored team hasn't
exactly met with resounding success.
"With the Cal game, you always throw out the records,"
said senior left tackle Jeff Buckey. "You just don't know what
to expect."
A victory over the Golden Bears might prove twice as tasty
in 1995. In addition to humiliating its arch-rival, a win may
gain the Cardinal an invitation to a bowl game.
"The rivalry really fires me up — getting the Axe as well as
using them as a stepping stone to a 12-game season," said
senior defensive end Jason White.
However, the prospect of a postseason appearance for the
Cardinal also sweetens the deal for Cal. In light of the con
test's history, it would be more than fitting for the Bears to
emerge triumphant. And there is nothing the Bears would
like better than to deny Stanford's dreams.
"In a way, this is their bowl game," said senior linebacker
Mike Hall.
Some have speculated that Stanford's gridiron warriors
may enter the contest flat, with their minds more on bowl
games than Big Games.
That won't be so, according to Hall. "I wouldn't say we're
looking past this game," he said. "Obviously, we have to win
this game in order to get to a 12th game. This game stands in
the way of that. On top of that, we haven't had the Axe for
two years and we want it back."
Head coach Tyrone Willingham echoed his linebacker's
thoughts. "We have the incentive that if we win this ball
game, it gives us our best chance for a 12-game season," he
said. "I think that is plenty of incentive for any final game of
the year.
"But as I've said, this is the game. This is the one we want
to win. This is the one we feel we have to win simply because
