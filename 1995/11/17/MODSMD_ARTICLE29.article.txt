# Cardinal seeks end to Cal's two-year Big Game win streak
## 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Forget the standings. Burn the statistics. It's Big Game
and the rules that normally govern football no longer apply.
In the 98th installation of one of college football's most
storied rivalries, Stanford (6-3-1 overall, 4-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) hosts California (3-7, 2-5) at 12:30 p.m. tomorrow in
Stanford Stadium.
Cal, mired in a losing season, may enter the contest as a
nine-point underdog, but in a series with more improbable
endings than any other, a betting man would have to be crazy
to expect the Cardinal to win easily — if it manages to win at
all. Forty-five of the previous 97 Big Games have been decid
ed by one touchdown or less, and the favored team hasn't
exactly met with resounding success.
"With the Cal game, you always throw out the records,"
said senior left tackle Jeff Buckey. "You just don't know what
to expect."
A victory over the Golden Bears might prove twice as tasty
in 1995. In addition to humiliating its arch-rival, a win may
gain the Cardinal an invitation to a bowl game.
"The rivalry really fires me up — getting the Axe as well as
using them as a stepping stone to a 12-game season," said
senior defensive end Jason White.
However, the prospect of a postseason appearance for the
Cardinal also sweetens the deal for Cal. In light of the con
test's history, it would be more than fitting for the Bears to
emerge triumphant. And there is nothing the Bears would
like better than to deny Stanford's dreams.
"In a way, this is their bowl game," said senior linebacker
Mike Hall.
Some have speculated that Stanford's gridiron warriors
may enter the contest flat, with their minds more on bowl
games than Big Games.
That won't be so, according to Hall. "I wouldn't say we're
looking past this game," he said. "Obviously, we have to win
this game in order to get to a 12th game. This game stands in
the way of that. On top of that, we haven't had the Axe for
two years and we want it back."
Head coach Tyrone Willingham echoed his linebacker's
thoughts. "We have the incentive that if we win this ball
game, it gives us our best chance for a 12-game season," he
said. "I think that is plenty of incentive for any final game of
the year.
"But as I've said, this is the game. This is the one we want
to win. This is the one we feel we have to win simply because
it is the Big Game. It's our cross
town rivalry. It's the game you
want bragging rights on."
In the preseason, Cal was tout
ed as a dark horse for the Rose
Bowl. At the very least, most pun
dits proclaimed that the Bears
would finish in the top half of the
league standings.
But the Bears' dismal 1-5 start
quickly ended any talk of trips to
Pasadena. It also put head coach
Keith Gilbertson on the hot seat.
Even a win over Stanford might
not be enough to save his job.
Cal has managed to take two
out of its last four games, howev
er, enough to convince the Cardi
nal that the Bears might be able
to play like the team they were
expected to be.
"They're a good team," Hall
said. "Their record might not
indicate that, but they're capable
of beating any team if they play
the way they can."
Led by Pat Barnes, Cal's pass
ing offense ranks third in the con
ference. The junior quarterback
has completed 52.7 percent of his
passes for 2351 yards and 15
touchdowns.
"Barnes is a really good pass
er," White said. "When he's under
pressure, he tends to throw deep.
We just want to keep him from
completing those passes."
The Bears also boast a talented
group of receivers. Wideouts Na'il
Benjamon (45 catches, 513 yards,
four touchdowns) and Bobby
Shaw (37, 647, six) and tight end
Tony Gonzalez (27, 391, one) pro
vide Barnes with good targets.
Unfortunately for Cal, the Bears
must compete without star
receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke (30,
506, three), who suffered an
injury two weeks ago against
Washington State.
Cal's running game has not
proven as successful, but not for
lack of talent. Running backs
Reynard Rutherford and Tarik
Smith both have yards-per-rush
averages above 4.5, but because
Cal has fallen behind and been

forced to pass so often this year,
neither has carried the ball signif
icantly. Still, Rutherford ranks
sixth in the league in rushing at
75.4 yards per game, just slightly
off the pace of Stanford's Antho
ny Bookman, the Pac-10 Offen
sive Player of the Week.
While the Bear offense certain
ly has potential, it is the Bear
defense that especially concerns
Stanford.
"They're a great defense,"
Buckey said. "It's hard to believe
that they've lost as many games
as they have. They are very domi
nating. You just hope they don't
put it all together."
Defensive ends Regan Upshaw
and Andy Jacobs and outside
linebacker Duane Clemons have
combined for 54 tackles behind
the line of scrimmage. Clemons
and Upshaw lead the league with
25 and 17, respectively. Both have
registered 9.5 quarterback sacks.
Such a disruptive pass rush
poses problems for the Cardinal.
However, on the other side of the
ball, the Cardinal offensive line
has surrendered only 13 sacks to
opposing defenses all season.
"You have to tip your hat to
our offensive line coaches, Pat
Morris and Dave Boberly," Will
ingham said. "Almost every week
we've had to shuffle that line
around (because of injuries).
They've done a good job of coach
ing and getting those young men
prepared. I think our players have
done a great job of working with
our scheme and communicating
with each other."
Senior quarterback Mark But
terfield, the individual who suf
fers the most when protection
breaks down, appreciates the fine
play as well. "The line has played
great," he said. "It's nice to drop
back and know that you're not
going to get hit."
Butterfield is one of a number
of seniors who will be making his
final start in Stanford Stadium
tomorrow. All the seniors want to
go out on a winning note.
"This is my last year and I'd
like to celebrate in my stadium
with the Axe," Hall said, sum
ming up the sentiments of all the
veterans. "It's a big game for me."
