# Big Game security
## Fans beware: Big Brother is watching you 
### Molly Stephens Contributing writer 
Stanford Police are mobilizing
their forces to prevent tomorrow's
Big Game from becoming the vio
lent fruit-throwing contest it has
been in years past.
Security will be in full force on
Big Game day, said Stanford Police
4 apt. Marvin Moore.
"We are in a no-tolerance, no
nonsense mode," he said. "We want
people (< ; :,ive fun, but they must
know I here are limits."
To enforce these limits, Stanford
Police will have more officers than
usual pat rolling the stadium during
the came. Moore said 15 police offi

cers are on duty dur'ng regular
games, but between 45 and 60 offi
cers will be on duty during the Stan
ford / UC-Berkeley matchup. The
larger police force will include offi
cers from the Stanford Police, the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Office
and the UC-Berkeley Police Depart -
ment.
Moore said the University will
also use its security staff — un
armed personnel — to patrol the
stadium. The total security force for
the 98th Rig Game will be roughly
twice the size used during regular
games.
For the first time at the annual
event, Stanford Police will also
use a closed-circuit television
security system to monitor the
crowd.
"The system gives us 100 per
cent coverage inside the stadium
and 97 percent coverage outside
— we didn't want to cut down the
trees blocking our outside view,"
Moore said.
Moore said the $500,000 secu
rity system, which was installed
for the World Cup soccer matches
held at Stanford in 1994, has tele
photo lenses that allow police to
clearly identify people from the
crowd. Police will use the camera
to spot trouble and record activi
ty. The still photos generated by
the camera will be used to identi
fy and possibly charge any person
suspected of committing a crime.
The security staff will be kept
an extended period of time after
Big Game, Moore said. Since peo
ple who attend Big Game are gen
erally familiar with the campus,
security personnel will stay on
duty until the early morning
hours.
Stanford Police have not been
waiting for Big Game day to imple
ment tougher security measures,
however. Officers have already
begun securing the campus.
"We start securing the campus

well before Big Game," Moore
said. "But I don't think it's pru
dent to let people know exactly
when we start."
Moore said special security
officers have been patrolling the
inner campus for vandalism for
the past few weeks. Stanford
Police arrested two UC-Berkeley
students early Monday morning
for allegedly painting blue and
gold bear paws around the cam
pus.
Security officers have also
been patrolling the inside of the
stadium and athletic facilities to
prevent damage and vandalism.
In addition, a committee com
prising representatives from UC-
Berkeley, the Stanford Axe Com
mittee and the two schools'
bands, mascots, rally squads and
athletics departments have met
five or six times.
Moore said the joint Big Game
committee was formed two years
ago in response to the anger and
numerous acts of violence dis
played during the game. The com
mittee has developed programs to
make students aware that Big
Game is a friendly rivalry. These
programs include the playing of
the national anthem by both
school bands, the exchanging of
gifts in the center of the field by
mascots and the confinement of
each mascot to zones in order to
prevent them from inciting vio
lence.
Stanford Police expect a crowd

of between 80,000 and 86,000
spectators for Big Game.
Moore said he doesn't expect
the chaos that has ensued in the
past to occur this weekend.
"The violence and hatred prob
ably peaked three years ago," he
said. "I don't know why it escalat
ed. . . . During the last three
years, we've curtailed it. The
number of calls for services and
acts of violence have gradually
decreased."
Moore said the problems have
decreased because students are
now held more accountable for
their actions. Not only are they
booked by police, but they are also
prosecuted under the Fundamen
tal Standard — Stanford's code of
student conduct.
Big Game has approached
mass chaos in the past. At the
1992 Big Game held at UC-Berke
ley, the "Flag Boy" and Tree were
attacked by UC-Berkeley fans.
Fruit and paint were thrown at
the band, cheerleaders and spec
tators. Police arrested no one.
At the 1993 Big Game, hun
dreds of UC-Berkeley students
rushed the field in Stanford Sta
dium — destroying grass and one
of the goal posts. The Tree was
also attacked. Fifteen people were
arrested and the University suf
fered $4,000 worth of damages.
Last year, three people were
arrested for violence, and fruit
was thrown at the band and spec
tators.
