# Nostra Demas

Live from Stanford Uni
versity, where pebbles
are polished and dia
monds are dimmed, it's a Big
Week of Big Predictions for
some Big Games. For this, my
final regular-season excursion
down humility lane, I've
retained the services of Stan
ford President Gerhard Casper.
As if he's not busy enough try
ing to keep the University from
slipping into anarchy, he sat
down to ponder this weekend's
big games â€” especially THE
Big Game.
You might know Casper from
his annual Big Game Gaieties
performance. Or maybe you
have seen his mug shot, as it has

appeared several thousand
times in The Daily this year.
Now that you think about it,
perhaps that was him you saw
sitting in the Quad consuming
grapes three-at-a-time and read
ing Richard Nixon's memoirs? If
we could only be so lucky.
Hold back thy tears, but this
might be my conclusive prog
nosticative endeavor of the sea
son. If the Cardinal football ath
letes are sitting at home eating
bon-bons and playing Old Maid
with their little brothers and
sisters come bowl time, I doubt
I shall return to the hallowed
pages of The Daily this year.
