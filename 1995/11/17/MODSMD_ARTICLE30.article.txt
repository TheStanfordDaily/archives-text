Live from Stanford Uni
versity, where pebbles
are polished and dia
monds are dimmed, it's a Big
Week of Big Predictions for
some Big Games. For this, my
final regular-season excursion
down humility lane, I've
retained the services of Stan
ford President Gerhard Casper.
As if he's not busy enough try
ing to keep the University from
slipping into anarchy, he sat
down to ponder this weekend's
big games — especially THE
Big Game.
You might know Casper from
his annual Big Game Gaieties
performance. Or maybe you
have seen his mug shot, as it has

appeared several thousand
times in The Daily this year.
Now that you think about it,
perhaps that was him you saw
sitting in the Quad consuming
grapes three-at-a-time and read
ing Richard Nixon's memoirs? If
we could only be so lucky.
Hold back thy tears, but this
might be my conclusive prog
nosticative endeavor of the sea
son. If the Cardinal football ath
letes are sitting at home eating
bon-bons and playing Old Maid
with their little brothers and
sisters come bowl time, I doubt
I shall return to the hallowed
pages of The Daily this year.

Hut fear not. Postseason play
is being handed to Stanford on a
gold-rimmed silver platter. If the
Cardinal can reach out and grab it
without tripping over its own feet,
tomorrow will be another day.
Cal at Stanford
The campus is giddy with the
news that the Cardinal may be
headed to Hawaii for the Aloha
Bowl if the squad can skin the
Bears in Big Came. But Stanford's
fate has yet to be determined, and
you can bet the folks from that
bowl in the middle of the Pacific
will have their profit-maximizing
eyes glued on Stanford this week
end.
Meanwhile, Big Came won't be
a trip to Fantasy Island for the
Cardinal. The squad will have to
maximize its ability and take
advantage of its first realistic
opportunity to win back the Axe in
two years. Otherwise, watching
"Hawaii Five-O" reruns at 3 a.m.
will be the closest the squad will get
to Honolulu over Christmas break.
There is a lot riding on this
game considering the two mediocre
squads that are taking the field. It
should definitely be worth attend
ing — if not for the game, for the
sight of seeing the Stanford Band
beat the snot out of any backpack
toting Weenies that are sure to
storm the field at halftime.
President Casper has no doubts
about the game (of course, if he did,
I'd be I he last person he would tell).
I le picks the Cardinal by over three
touchdowns, but is expecting a real
blow-out. "We'll actually win by
more, but presidents should be gra
cious hosts."
Hosting this game is going to be
a pain in the rear for the Universi
ty if Stanford loses. Winning this
contest means a lot more than just
pride. It would be nice if the Cardi
nal could emerge victorious Just to
avoid the thousands of dollars it
will cost to fix the stadium after
10,000 Cal fans in various altered
states bring the goal posts down
and tear grass out of the field
again.

Gerhard: Stanford by 24
Me: Stanford by less than that
UCI at USC
Whoop-de-doo. Look who's
going to the Row Bowl. Too bad
the Trojans Jire going to be put to
the sword against the Big Ten's
best in Pasadena. Before that hap
pens, we'll allow the sanctimonious
USC squad one final hurrah — an
old-fashioned spanking of cross
town rival UCIA.
Kiirim Abdul-Jabbar is uncer
tain for the contest, which only
means it is uncertain if USC will
win by two touchdowns or by an
order of magnitude more. Casper
says that the game "all hinges on
whether Karim can use his sky
hook." I say the outcome hinges on
whether the apocalypse occurs at
halftime and prevents the game
from concluding.
Gerhard: USC by 10
Me: USC by more than that
WSU at Washington
Too bad the Huskies decided to
blow their shot at the Rose Bowl
and allow the Pac-10 to be repre
sented on Jan. 1 by the struggling
remnants of a USC squad that was
once actually very good. Instead,
Washington just needs to hammer
the pussy-cat Cougars and carry
the momentum into its bowl game.
Maybe then, at least one Pac-10
squad will look good on New Year's
Day.
Casper thinks weather and the
home meteorological advantage
will make the difference. "The
Huskies are known for playing best
in the rain, while the Cougars
thrive in more wintry weather. I
pick Washington to win, assuming
it will be Sleetless in Seattle."
Gerhard: Washington by 14
Me: Washington by 10
Arizona at Arizona State
This is the other game the
Aloha Bowl will be mulling over
on Saturday. A Sun Devil victory
coupled with a Stanford loss
would send once-pathetic but
now-improved ASU to Hawaii. In
the likely case that both squads
win, the Cardinal would almost
certainly be on the plane to Hon

olulu because of its flashy air
attack and ratings-grabbing offen
sive production. (The lack of
defense also helps — the more
scoring, the more people want to
watch).
While I see the Sun Devils, who
have won four games in a row, fin
ishing off the season in fine fash
ion, the president has a royal dis
agreement with me. "Arizona
State is coached by (former Cal
coach] Bruce Snyder," Casper says.
"And even former Cal coaches have
a hard time breaking the habit of
losing on Big Game day."
His methods of prediction are
not regular tricks of the prognosti
cating trade, but Casper's conclu
sion is plausible. For the Stanford
football team's sake (and for the
benefit of any of you who might be
traveling with the squad on the
sojourn over the sunny Pacific),
let's hope Casper's inclinations are
inclined in the right direction.
Gerhard: Arizona by 3
Me: ASU by 7
Oregon State at Oregon
Casper says this contest will be
part of "an 0-3 day by 'State Uni
versities' against 'Universities of.' "
I say thus year's Civil War (the over
ly dramatic name football-starved
Oregonians give this pathetic
grime) will be won as quickly as an
armed conflict between the United
States and Luxembourg.
The president has some other
insights on the game: "It is difficult
to choose in a contest featuring
these two mascots," Casper says.
"A duck and a beaver, both wear
ing sailor hats." (If you have never
noticed, it's absolutely true.)
Oregon is headed for the Cotton
Bowl, and the game against the
Beavers will give the center a
chance to practice a few snaps
before the big bowl game. Other
than that, put videotaped copies of
this game on the pharmaceuticals
market and watch sales of Sominex
and Nyquil plummet.

There is a lot riding on this
game considering the two mediocre
squads that are taking the field. It
should definitely be worth attend
ing — if not for the game, for the
sight of seeing the Stanford Band
beat the snot out of any backpack
toting Weenies that are sure to
storm the field at halftime.
President Casper has no doubts
about the game (of course, if he did,
I'd be I he last person he would tell).
I le picks the Cardinal by over three
touchdowns, but is expecting a real
blow-out. "We'll actually win by
more, but presidents should be gra
cious hosts."
Hosting this game is going to be
a pain in the rear for the Universi
ty if Stanford loses. Winning this
contest means a lot more than just
pride. It would be nice if the Cardi
nal could emerge victorious Just to
avoid the thousands of dollars it
will cost to fix the stadium after
10,000 Cal fans in various altered
states bring the goal posts down
and tear grass out of the field
again.

UCI at USC
Whoop-de-doo. Look who's
going to the Row Bowl. Too bad
the Trojans Jire going to be put to
the sword against the Big Ten's
best in Pasadena. Before that hap
pens, we'll allow the sanctimonious
USC squad one final hurrah — an
old-fashioned spanking of cross
town rival UCIA.
Kiirim Abdul-Jabbar is uncer
tain for the contest, which only
means it is uncertain if USC will
win by two touchdowns or by an
order of magnitude more. Casper
says that the game "all hinges on
whether Karim can use his sky
hook." I say the outcome hinges on
whether the apocalypse occurs at
halftime and prevents the game
from concluding.

WSU at Washington
Too bad the Huskies decided to
blow their shot at the Rose Bowl
and allow the Pac-10 to be repre
sented on Jan. 1 by the struggling
remnants of a USC squad that was
once actually very good. Instead,
Washington just needs to hammer
the pussy-cat Cougars and carry
the momentum into its bowl game.
Maybe then, at least one Pac-10
squad will look good on New Year's
Day.
Casper thinks weather and the
home meteorological advantage
will make the difference. "The
Huskies are known for playing best
in the rain, while the Cougars
thrive in more wintry weather. I
pick Washington to win, assuming
it will be Sleetless in Seattle."

Arizona at Arizona State
This is the other game the
Aloha Bowl will be mulling over
on Saturday. A Sun Devil victory
coupled with a Stanford loss
would send once-pathetic but
now-improved ASU to Hawaii. In
the likely case that both squads
win, the Cardinal would almost
certainly be on the plane to Hon

olulu because of its flashy air
attack and ratings-grabbing offen
sive production. (The lack of
defense also helps — the more
scoring, the more people want to
watch).
While I see the Sun Devils, who
have won four games in a row, fin
ishing off the season in fine fash
ion, the president has a royal dis
agreement with me. "Arizona
State is coached by (former Cal
coach] Bruce Snyder," Casper says.
"And even former Cal coaches have
a hard time breaking the habit of
losing on Big Game day."
His methods of prediction are
not regular tricks of the prognosti
cating trade, but Casper's conclu
sion is plausible. For the Stanford
football team's sake (and for the
benefit of any of you who might be
traveling with the squad on the
sojourn over the sunny Pacific),
let's hope Casper's inclinations are
inclined in the right direction.

Oregon State at Oregon
Casper says this contest will be
part of "an 0-3 day by 'State Uni
versities' against 'Universities of.' "
I say thus year's Civil War (the over
ly dramatic name football-starved
Oregonians give this pathetic
grime) will be won as quickly as an
armed conflict between the United
States and Luxembourg.
The president has some other
insights on the game: "It is difficult
to choose in a contest featuring
these two mascots," Casper says.
"A duck and a beaver, both wear
ing sailor hats." (If you have never
noticed, it's absolutely true.)
Oregon is headed for the Cotton
Bowl, and the game against the
Beavers will give the center a
chance to practice a few snaps
before the big bowl game. Other
than that, put videotaped copies of
this game on the pharmaceuticals
market and watch sales of Sominex
and Nyquil plummet.

Live from Stanford Uni
versity, where pebbles
are polished and dia
monds are dimmed, it's a Big
Week of Big Predictions for
some Big Games. For this, my
final regular-season excursion
down humility lane, I've
retained the services of Stan
ford President Gerhard Casper.
As if he's not busy enough try
ing to keep the University from
slipping into anarchy, he sat
down to ponder this weekend's
big games — especially THE
Big Game.
You might know Casper from
his annual Big Game Gaieties
performance. Or maybe you
have seen his mug shot, as it has

appeared several thousand
times in The Daily this year.
Now that you think about it,
perhaps that was him you saw
sitting in the Quad consuming
grapes three-at-a-time and read
ing Richard Nixon's memoirs? If
we could only be so lucky.
Hold back thy tears, but this
might be my conclusive prog
nosticative endeavor of the sea
son. If the Cardinal football ath
letes are sitting at home eating
bon-bons and playing Old Maid
with their little brothers and
sisters come bowl time, I doubt
I shall return to the hallowed
pages of The Daily this year.

Hut fear not. Postseason play
is being handed to Stanford on a
gold-rimmed silver platter. If the
Cardinal can reach out and grab it
without tripping over its own feet,
tomorrow will be another day.
Cal at Stanford
The campus is giddy with the
news that the Cardinal may be
headed to Hawaii for the Aloha
Bowl if the squad can skin the
Bears in Big Came. But Stanford's
fate has yet to be determined, and
you can bet the folks from that
bowl in the middle of the Pacific
will have their profit-maximizing
eyes glued on Stanford this week
end.
Meanwhile, Big Came won't be
a trip to Fantasy Island for the
Cardinal. The squad will have to
maximize its ability and take
advantage of its first realistic
opportunity to win back the Axe in
two years. Otherwise, watching
"Hawaii Five-O" reruns at 3 a.m.
will be the closest the squad will get
to Honolulu over Christmas break.
