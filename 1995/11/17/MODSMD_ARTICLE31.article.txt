# NCAA snubs Cardinal women's soccer for the second straight season
## 
### 
Just what does the NCAA
selection committee have
against lan Sawyers and the
Stanford women's soccer team?
Last year, the top-seeded Cardi
nal was slapped with a trip to
Portland for the regionals, even
though the second-seeded Pilots
already had the rights to the Final
Four. This time around, the No. 7
Cardinal didn't earn one of eight
second-round byes. In fact, Stan
ford had to go on the road. Not
only that, but the Cardinal was
sent to cross-town rival Santa
Clara, the only other top-10 team
not to earn a bye.

The Broncos played in front of
2,800-plus rabid fans. The Cardi
nal suffered a heartbreaking over

time NCAA tournament loss for
third consecutive time. In the
meantime, unranked squads like
Washington and UCLA squared
off against each other in round
one, and teams suffering through
down years like Virginia watched
the first round.
Last year, the NCAA offered
the excuse of a home football
game at Stanford as justification
to send the Cardinal north. That
seemed unfair, maybe, but under
standable. This year's pairing of
Stanford and Santa Clara just to
generate an exciting regional
matchup makes my blood boil. I'll
venture to guess that Sawyers, a
fiercely competitive man and an
outstanding soccer coach, private
ly curses the NCAA every night
before he goes to sleep. The pre
eminent soccer power in the Bay
Area deserves to be dealt a full
house, not the king-high hand the
NCAA doled out.
What's wrong with Bay Area

As I dust off the keyboard for
my brief return to the columnist's
space, I'd like to extend my condo
lences to one of the normal occu
pants of this space. Afler reading
his and the other Bay Area media
pundits' obituaries of the 49ers the
past two weeks, I'm enjoying
watching them peel the egg off
their faces now. Look, I didn't
think they would beat Dallas,
much less in such convincing fash
ion. But to write the Niners off
after back-to-back losses was
laughable.
Nearly every team loses back-to
back on occasion, even against
chumps like New Orleans and Car
olina. Don't write off a team that
has enjoyed unparalleled success
for 12 consecutive seasons after
two straight losses. Besides, Dallas
will never again beat the Niners
until Jerrv Jones signs some exclu

sive contract with Rolex, gets into
trouble with the other owners and
the league, gives his players free
watches and tells them the game
starts at 1 p.m. Pacific, not 1:30
and not 1:15.
What's wrong with Bay Area
media, part II
Glenn Dickey has been at it
again. The Chronicle columnist
either was not a math major at Cal
or, at the very least, is not a careful
typist. In his Oct. 27 column, Dick
ey claimed the Cardinal would
probably enter Big Game needing a
win to finish 6-5-1 — in an 11-
game season.
The man who opposed Willing
ham's hiring from day one also
asserted that last year's team gen
erated more excitement than this
year's and that Bill Walsh was the
model Stanford coach. Apparently,
Dickey's recipe for excitement
includes widespread internal dis
sension and players threatening to
transfer. Dickey believes fans
would rather watch an aloof coach

with three Super Howl rings. I
think most football fans prefer an
intense coach with nothing more
than a singular mission to win.
Dickey also asserted that "Will
ingham's total lack of charisma has
rubbed off on the team." Dickey's
idea of charisma is Walsh astutely
observing that his former Chroni
cle buddy liowell Cohn's articles
appear right above the penile
enlargement ads. Hardy-har-har.
Willingham may be no stand-up
comic, but it's not like rigor mortis
sets in when he's behind a micro
phone. Maybe if Dickey would
attend each press conference
rather than just the one following
Stanford's only consecutive losses
this year, he'd realize that.
Dickey has certainly enjoyed
plenty of opportunities to cover
press conferences after a team has
lost back-to-back games — his Cal
team has become accustomed to it.
By now, he should realize that
Keith Gilbertson's total lack of
competence has nibbed off on the
Cal football team.
