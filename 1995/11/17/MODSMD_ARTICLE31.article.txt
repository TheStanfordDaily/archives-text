# NCAA snubs Cardinal women's soccer for the second straight season
## 
### 
Just what does the NCAA
selection committee have
against lan Sawyers and the
Stanford women's soccer team?
Last year, the top-seeded Cardi
nal was slapped with a trip to
Portland for the regionals, even
though the second-seeded Pilots
already had the rights to the Final
Four. This time around, the No. 7
Cardinal didn't earn one of eight
second-round byes. In fact, Stan
ford had to go on the road. Not
only that, but the Cardinal was
sent to cross-town rival Santa
Clara, the only other top-10 team
not to earn a bye.

The Broncos played in front of
2,800-plus rabid fans. The Cardi
nal suffered a heartbreaking over

time NCAA tournament loss for
third consecutive time. In the
meantime, unranked squads like
Washington and UCLA squared
off against each other in round
one, and teams suffering through
down years like Virginia watched
the first round.
Last year, the NCAA offered
the excuse of a home football
game at Stanford as justification
to send the Cardinal north. That
seemed unfair, maybe, but under
standable. This year's pairing of
Stanford and Santa Clara just to
generate an exciting regional
matchup makes my blood boil. I'll
venture to guess that Sawyers, a
fiercely competitive man and an
outstanding soccer coach, private
ly curses the NCAA every night
before he goes to sleep. The pre
eminent soccer power in the Bay
Area deserves to be dealt a full
house, not the king-high hand the
NCAA doled out.
