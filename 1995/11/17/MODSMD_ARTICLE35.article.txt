# Making a pass
## 
### 
This week they want me to write a col
umn about a subject I know absolutely
nothing about. "After all," my editors
tell me, "it's Big Game Weekend, a football
article would be appropriate."
"But I'm not going to Big Game."
The Daily could care less. "We could care
less," they say, "we're paying you to write
something poignant about pigskin!"
It's not really made from pigs.
"Not good enough! We want 4,000 charac
ters!"
Hey, I had to research that tidbit. (Insert
Kosher joke here.] Anyway, I have no clue
how long 4,000 characters is, but I figure it
must be a lot. And 1 haven't gone to a football
game since freshman year.
I Picture it: Stern Hall, 1992. Jason is in his
bed. His roommate (6 foot 4 inches and built
like a Buick Roadmaster) is bodypainting a
big red "S" across his chest.]
Him: You are going to the game, aren't
you?
Me: I . . . can't . . . breathe ...
IMy Wagnerian Wet Dream of a Roommate
loosens his grip around my neck.]
Me: (cough-cough)
Him: Get out of bed.
Me: I don't like football.
Him: Show some school spirit!
Me: Ouch! Jesus! You're cutting off the
blood supply to my brain!

[I go to the game wearing SPF 15. My room
mate gets a nuclear "S" tattoo and a nasty
case of melanoma.!
(Remember, no tan is a safe tan. Always apply
sunblock vigorously and generously to areas
uncovered by clothes or bodypaint. Ultraviolet
(UV) A radiation is made up of wavelengths 320
to 400 nm and UV B 280 to 320 nm. That's bad
stuff. Stratospheric ozone depletion increases
the amount of these rays that reach the Earth.
The sun protection factor (SPF) number indi
cates the number of times more sun protection
you receive than normal. This message has
been brought to you by your mother.]
But I digress. I'm stuck with this subject I
know nothing about (refer to first paragraph).
"But everyone knows about football," they
goaded me.
"Not me. 1 know nothing about our nation
al pastime."
"That's baseball."
I didn't know that. "Listen guys, I know
less about football than I do about tampons."
(Tampons expand in water.)
"And you call yourself a man?" they
scoffed. I showed them my penis. For some
reason, they didn't stop laughing. "You see, I
don't like spectator sports," I explained,
"because I'm not good at the real thing."
I was always the last to be picked for kick
ball and the first to be pegged in dodge ball.

And remember that game where
you threw the ball against a wall and

caught it with one hand but if you

dropped it you had to stand against
the wall, like in a firing line, covering
your face and genitals, while everyone
else took turns abusing you. I hated

that game.
Okay, maybe 1 can't play sports, but I have
other ways of asserting my manhood: I don't ask
for directions. I don't shave. I don't admit when
I'm wrong. I leave the seat up. I bungee jump
and sky dive. I build with wood and steel. I cro
chet. I drink beer. I drink whiskey like water. I
drink rubbing alcohol. I oppress the weak.
"How can you possibly call yourself a big,
strong, rugged manly man but not watch foot
ball?" they ask. Practice. Remember the tough
kid who used to beat up the short scrawny kid
with glasses? That was me. 1 mean, I was the
kid who got beat up. But I've been drinking
milk and working out (I took Athletics 175:
"Weight Training for Men") and now I feel
strong enough to lift the bar. Once I was a lit
tle man in this Big Man's World, but now I am
older, wiser, faster, stronger — and thanks to
my Bionic Implant, capable of picking up over
500 commercial-free channels. With variety
like that, who has time for football?

Mr. Wishnow will be spending tomorrow at a
Drag Queen Convention. With his girlfriend.
