Over the dinnertime bustle
through Arroyo lounge, freshman
Claudia Aranda speaks with elo
quent conviction about education
— not of the mind in school, but of
the heart in the community.
Aranda will be one of 10 young
adults to receive a National Caring
Award on Dec. 8 in Washington,
D C. Over the past 10 years, the
National Caring Awards, present
ed bv the Caring Institute, have

honored people who have demon
strated extraordinary compassion
in their lives and activities. Among
other recipients this year are Pres
ident Carter and his wife Ros
alynn, who will receive a similar
award in the adult category.
The Caring Award honors
Aranda for her work with the Teen
Volunteer Corps (TVC), an orga
nization she founded in her junior
year at Hanks High School in El
Paso, Texas. As a sophomore, Aran
da discovered many students who
were willing to volunteer but did
not know where to go.
On Make a Difference Day in
1993, Aranda successfully
launched 'I've — a school-based
volunteer network connecting
students and community organi
zations — by generating more
than 2,000 student volunteer
hours in the El Paso community
on that day alone.
That year, TVC connected
nearly 350 students from Hanks
High School with 30 organiza

tions. now involves nearly 60
community organizations.
Although the volunteer net
work became an immediate suc
cess, Aranda learned some diffi
cult lessons in the process. For
example, Aranda said she repeat
edly fought a prevalent notion
that teenagers are selfish and lazy.
"Even if they talk about stu
dents who do good, the headlines
are always about students who
shot somebody [or] the rising
pregnancy rate," Aranda said.
Aranda still advises TVC and is
working to bring the corps onto
the World Wide Web; however,
Stanford's plethora of community
service opportunities is keeping
her busy for now.
"I have already found mv home

in the Haas Center," she said.
Aranda is involved with "You
Can Make A Difference," Stan
ford in Government and Upward
Bound. Yet despite her enthusi
asm for community service on the
Farm, she hasn't lost her revolu
tionary spirit.
"More needs to be done to
encourage the wider population,"
she said. "There are so many
opportunities; every person can
give something."
"GPAs and SAT scores are not
what we're about," she said. "In
the long run, it's about humani
ty."
The Caring Institute was estab
lished in 1985 to promote selfless
ness and teach the value of caring
through the ise of role models.
