# Vigil, fast held to aid institute
## FRI students, faculty protest 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Attempting to use their own
hunger to illustrate what the world
could face without their work, Food
Research Institute students and fac
ulty began a 24-hour fast in White
Plaza yesterday to raise awareness
about the institute's proposed clo
sure.
Nineteen people are participat
ing in the protest, which began at 2
p.m. yesterday and will culminate in
a rally at noon today. The protesters
will then move to the Main Quad,
where the Advisory Board of the
Academic Council is scheduled to
meet to formulate a recommenda
tion on the institute's closure this
afternoon.
The board's recommendation
will then be forwarded to the presi
dent and the provost. Students have
said that they may continue the fast,
as well as appeal to the president,
the provost and the Board of
Trustees, if the Advisory Board rec
ommends closing the institute.
Both University President Ger
hard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice declined yesterday to
comment on the fast.
Earlier this year, Dean of Hu

manities and Sciences John Shoven
proposed the abolition of the Food
Research Institute's international
ly renowned doctoral program, the
merger of the master's program
into International Policy Studies
and the transfer of the institute's
tenured faculty to other University
departments. Additionally, all ju
nior faculty would be laid off within
three years, according to the pro
posal.
Explaining the pertinence of the
fast, Food Research Institute Asst.
Prof. Scott Rozelle said, "We are try
ing to link the ideas of hunger and
poverty that are associated with the
fast to the type of work we do."
"We are fasting because we be
lieve in the work we are doing," said
Eleni Gabre-Madhin, a third-year
doctoral student from Ethiopia.
"The work is relevant to developing
countries. We've come here so we
can go back to our [countries] and
contribute. .. . This is an important
symbol to represent the people we
came here to help. Those people do
not have a voice."
Noting that it is rare for graduate
students to par pate in such a
protest, Gabre-.iv adhin argued that

it must not be taken lightly.
Shoven has said he decided to
close the institute to consolidate a
department which overlaps with
several others and faces a wave of
faculty retirements in the near
future.
The decision has been heavily
criticized by those affiliated with
the institute, who question the
closing of an acclaimed program
which is financially self-sufficient.
They also assert that the review

process was flawed.
"There are no convincing rea
sons to close FRI," said Minggao
Shen, a second-year doctoral
student. "I want to ask Shoven
to give me one good reason to
close FRI, and I don't think he
could."
Even though there are some
parallels between this fast and the
hunger strike two years ago by
Chicano / Latino students who
included a Chicano Studies pro
gram among their demands, FRI
students were careful to point out
the differences.
"We have been careful not to
make this a repeat of how that

protest was done," Gabre-Madhin
said, "We are not asking for some
thing. This is symbolic to raise
awareness of our concern."
"I hope this influences them,"
said Scott Pearson, director of the
institute. "One never knows what
kinds of things influence people to
make up their minds.
Pearson said he is not fasting
because of his meeting with the
Advisory Board today.
"This is a wonderful
upswelling of student conscious
ness about what FRI is and what
we do," he said. "I hope the opin
ions of students matter. They
ought to."
