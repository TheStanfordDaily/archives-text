# Lessons for life
## Stanford leads the country in service-oriented classes 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Most professors urge their
students to apply what they learn
from textbooks and lectures to
their lives outside the classroom.
In Stanford's case, the reverse is
also true.
In an effort to promote greater
intellectual understanding of the
goals and effects of community
service, more and more profes
sors at Stanford are offering
classes that complement academ
ic coursework with service in
ternships.
"There's no dispute. (Service
learning at Stanford] is a tremen
dous academic program, with in
credible range and depth," said
Janet Luce, the service-learning
coordinator for the Haas Center
for Public Service. "It is consid
ered to be a national model."
The statistics back her up.
The number of courses incorpo
rating community service into
the syllabus has more than
tripled in the last five years.
The growing trend toward in
tegrating study and service is in
large part an outgrowth of the
formidable role the 11-year-old
Haas Center has played in pro
moting student participation in
community service. According to
a recently conducted senior sur

vey, approximately 70 percent of
undergraduates participate in
community service during their
time at Stanford.
Timothy Stanton, director of
the Haas Center, said each year
increasing numbers of fresh
men arrive on campus with sub
stantial experience volunteer

ing in their communities. This,
he explained, is another likely
factor influencing the rise in
popularity of service-related
academics.
A comparative perspective
Although there is a nation
wide trend on college campuses

toward promoting student in
volvement in community service,
different schools espouse differ
ent opinions on the integration of
service and study.
At Harvard, for instance, ap
proximately 1,700 students are
