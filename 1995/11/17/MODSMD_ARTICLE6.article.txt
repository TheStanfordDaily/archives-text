# Lessons for life
## Stanford leads the country in service-oriented classes 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Most professors urge their
students to apply what they learn
from textbooks and lectures to
their lives outside the classroom.
In Stanford's case, the reverse is
also true.
In an effort to promote greater
intellectual understanding of the
goals and effects of community
service, more and more profes
sors at Stanford are offering
classes that complement academ
ic coursework with service in
ternships.
"There's no dispute. (Service
learning at Stanford] is a tremen
dous academic program, with in
credible range and depth," said
Janet Luce, the service-learning
coordinator for the Haas Center
for Public Service. "It is consid
ered to be a national model."
The statistics back her up.
The number of courses incorpo
rating community service into
the syllabus has more than
tripled in the last five years.
The growing trend toward in
tegrating study and service is in
large part an outgrowth of the
formidable role the 11-year-old
Haas Center has played in pro
moting student participation in
community service. According to
a recently conducted senior sur

vey, approximately 70 percent of
undergraduates participate in
community service during their
time at Stanford.
Timothy Stanton, director of
the Haas Center, said each year
increasing numbers of fresh
men arrive on campus with sub
stantial experience volunteer

ing in their communities. This,
he explained, is another likely
factor influencing the rise in
popularity of service-related
academics.
A comparative perspective
Although there is a nation
wide trend on college campuses

toward promoting student in
volvement in community service,
different schools espouse differ
ent opinions on the integration of
service and study.
At Harvard, for instance, ap
proximately 1,700 students are

regularly involved with communi
ty service — an impressive por
tion of the student body, although
substantially short of Stanford's
3,000 active volunteers.
While participation in public
service is fairly high at Harvard,
only two service-oriented courses
are offered, reflecting "a sense
that [service learning] is not aca
demically rigorous enough,"
according to Eric Dawson, vice
president of the Phillips Brooks
House Association — a non-profit
corporation which is Harvard's
equivalent to the Haas Center.
"It is not Harvard's role to get
people to do community service,
but rather to educate," Dawson
added.
At the other end of the service
learning spectrum is Rhode
Island's Providence College,
where the country's only interdis
ciplinary bachelor of arts major in
Public and Community Service
Studies is in its first year of imple
mentation.
During the two years it took to
research and pilot the curricu
lum, Richard Battistoni — direc
tor of the college's Feinstein
Institute for Public Service —
said that he "drew a lot of inspira
tion from Stanford's community
service programs."
Aligning with the goals of the
Feinstein Institute, the program

"offers to students, faculty and
the larger community academi
cally based experiences of public
and community service that
encompass broadly conceived
principles of understanding
human diversity, engaged citizen
ship, social justice and human sol
idarity."

From theory to practice
Service learning is a brainchild
of the 19605, born of a spirit for
proactive responses to political and
socio-economic problems. While
the link between study and service
has been a definitive characteristic
of Stanford education over the
past three decades, there has been
a remarkable proliferation of
interest in and support for service
learning in the past five years.
In 1990, there were 15 commu
nity service-oriented courses
offered at Stanford. Today there
are more than 50.
Whether the focus is on

HIV/AIDS education, problems
facing linguistic minorities or the
sociology of mental health, cours
es can introduce students to liter
ature and current research on a
given community need, and
launch them into confrontations
with the Bay Area's problems.
Advice from the Haas Center
and money from a service learn
ing course development fund
financed by the Dean of Student
Affairs Office often facilitate pro
fessors' endeavors to create the
courses they envision, said Luce.
The Community Service Writ
ing (CSW) program, now in its
seventh year, links hundreds of
freshmen to agencies in need of
writing support. Students spend
the quarter developing their con
nection with the agencies, collab
orating on projects such as grant
proposals, brochures and letters
to legislators.
Students in the past have writ
ten op-ed pieces for the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, educational plays
performed for Hay Area youth, lit
erature for the East Palo Alto
Historical and Agricultural Soci
ety, the Stanford IJlood Bank,
Planned Parenthood and a host of
other Bay Area organizations.
"These courses provide oppor
tunities to become informed, eval
uate needs, analyze them, make
decisions about them, then write
about then in a thoughtful, even
handed way," explained Leslie
Townsend, CSW coordinator.
"There is a special value attached
to writing because it serves an

audience, and not just a grade,"
Townsend added.
The program, as Townsend
describes it, is a two-way street of
benefits: Organizations get thor
oughly researched help from
energetic students and students
learn that the written word has
real power — a lesson that is
"intellectually, academically and
personally satisfying."
In another class, "Policy Mak
ing at the Local and Regional
Level," students observe and help
community leaders draft policy.
One year, the class was involved
with the Economic Development
Department of the City of Palo
Alto, helping them grapple with
public land-use issues affecting
the community.
Community policy makers give
"very positive feedback about how
important student input has
been," said Stanton, who teaches
the course.
One of the most popular and
intensive service-related courses
is History Prof. Albert Camaril
lo's "Poverty and Homelessness,"
in which students complement
the study of history and current
research with 5-10 hours per
week of volunteer work in Bay
Area homeless shelters affiliated
with the Emergency Housing
Consortium of Santa Clara and
the Shelter Network of San
Mateo.
"The internship is an exten
sion of the classroom and vice
versa," Camarillo said. "Looking
at tough questions and con

fronting local manifestations of
homelessness is a truly awaken
ing experience for students. ... It
changes people. Faced with ago
nizing situations, people rethink
religion, culture, class and gender
as they relate to extreme pover

Some students have continued
their involvement with homeless

course. Senior Emily Dossett
piloted a peer mentoring pro
gram, called Stanford Peers
Encounter Awesome Kids
(SPEAK), in which Stanford stu
dents lead group discussions with
troubled teens at the Santa Clara
Family Shelter.
Describing how Camarillo's
course motivated her to create the
volunteer organization, Dossett
said, "The class showed me how

to take knowledge, mold it and be
flexible with it. ... It made me
realize what a need there is for
different programs in all realms
of public service. And it was fun."
Building from our resources
Although faculty and adminis
trators at Stanford admire the
merit Providence College's pro
gram assigns to community ser
vice, they are not planning to
emulate it by creating the same
kind of undergraduate major,
Stanton said.
Instead, by encouraging stu
dents to take advantage of exist
ing opportunities to link study
and service — such as the Urban
Studies Community Organization
track, the Children in Society Cur
riculum, Stanford in Washington
and the wide variety of interdisci
plinary courses offered — the Uni
versity will continue to promote
serious reflection on the purpose
of serving the community.
The recently established Pub
lic Service Scholars Program,
which enables students to pro
duce honors theses from their
community service involvement,
explores how research itself can
be a form of public service.
Both inside and outside the
classroom, members of the Stan
ford community will continue
their pursuit of, in Stanton's
words, "a greater understanding
of connections between history,
the common good, and relation
ships between disciplines and
duties to society."
Most professors urge their
students to apply what they learn
from textbooks and lectures to
their lives outside the classroom.
In Stanford's case, the reverse is

piloted a peer mentoring pro

Describing how Camarillo's
course motivated her to create the
volunteer organization, Dossett
said, "The class showed me how

to take knowledge, mold it and be

Building from our resources
Although faculty and adminis
trators at Stanford admire the
merit Providence College's pro
gram assigns to community ser
vice, they are not planning to
emulate it by creating the same
kind of undergraduate major,
Stanton said.
Instead, by encouraging stu
dents to take advantage of exist
ing opportunities to link study
and service — such as the Urban
Studies Community Organization
track, the Children in Society Cur
riculum, Stanford in Washington
and the wide variety of interdisci
plinary courses offered — the Uni
versity will continue to promote
serious reflection on the purpose
of serving the community.
The recently established Pub
lic Service Scholars Program,
which enables students to pro
duce honors theses from their
community service involvement,
explores how research itself can
be a form of public service.
Both inside and outside the
classroom, members of the Stan
ford community will continue
their pursuit of, in Stanton's
words, "a greater understanding
of connections between history,
the common good, and relation
ships between disciplines and
duties to society."
Most professors urge their
students to apply what they learn
from textbooks and lectures to
their lives outside the classroom.
In Stanford's case, the reverse is
also true.
In an effort to promote greater
intellectual understanding of the
goals and effects of community
service, more and more profes
sors at Stanford are offering
classes that complement academ
ic coursework with service in
ternships.
"There's no dispute. (Service
learning at Stanford] is a tremen
dous academic program, with in
credible range and depth," said
Janet Luce, the service-learning
coordinator for the Haas Center
for Public Service. "It is consid
ered to be a national model."
The statistics back her up.
The number of courses incorpo
rating community service into
the syllabus has more than
tripled in the last five years.
The growing trend toward in
tegrating study and service is in
large part an outgrowth of the
formidable role the 11-year-old
Haas Center has played in pro
moting student participation in
community service. According to
a recently conducted senior sur

vey, approximately 70 percent of
undergraduates participate in
community service during their
time at Stanford.
Timothy Stanton, director of
the Haas Center, said each year
increasing numbers of fresh
men arrive on campus with sub
stantial experience volunteer

ing in their communities. This,
he explained, is another likely
factor influencing the rise in
popularity of service-related
academics.
A comparative perspective
Although there is a nation
wide trend on college campuses

toward promoting student in
volvement in community service,
different schools espouse differ
ent opinions on the integration of
service and study.

ty service — an impressive por
tion of the student body, although
substantially short of Stanford's
3,000 active volunteers.
While participation in public
service is fairly high at Harvard,
only two service-oriented courses
are offered, reflecting "a sense
that [service learning] is not aca
demically rigorous enough,"
according to Eric Dawson, vice
president of the Phillips Brooks
House Association — a non-profit
corporation which is Harvard's
equivalent to the Haas Center.
"It is not Harvard's role to get
people to do community service,
but rather to educate," Dawson
added.
At the other end of the service
learning spectrum is Rhode
Island's Providence College,
where the country's only interdis
ciplinary bachelor of arts major in
Public and Community Service
Studies is in its first year of imple
mentation.
During the two years it took to
research and pilot the curricu
lum, Richard Battistoni — direc
tor of the college's Feinstein
Institute for Public Service —
said that he "drew a lot of inspira
tion from Stanford's community
service programs."
Aligning with the goals of the
Feinstein Institute, the program

"offers to students, faculty and
the larger community academi
cally based experiences of public
and community service that
encompass broadly conceived
principles of understanding
human diversity, engaged citizen
ship, social justice and human sol
idarity."

From theory to practice
Service learning is a brainchild
of the 19605, born of a spirit for
proactive responses to political and
socio-economic problems. While
the link between study and service
has been a definitive characteristic
of Stanford education over the
past three decades, there has been
a remarkable proliferation of
interest in and support for service
learning in the past five years.
In 1990, there were 15 commu
nity service-oriented courses
offered at Stanford. Today there
are more than 50.
Whether the focus is on

HIV/AIDS education, problems
facing linguistic minorities or the
sociology of mental health, cours
es can introduce students to liter
ature and current research on a
given community need, and
launch them into confrontations
with the Bay Area's problems.

Affairs Office often facilitate pro

The Community Service Writ

seventh year, links hundreds of
freshmen to agencies in need of
