Former Stanford Prof. Amos Funkenstein
died Saturday of cancer at age 58.
Funkenstein held the first Daniel E.
Koshland Professorship in Jewish Culture and
History at Stanford. He was the Koret Profes
sor of Jewish History at UC-Berkeley at the
time of his death.
Regarded as a distinguished scholar of Jew
ish history, Funkenstein was "an intellectual of
rare originality and erudition," said David Biale
of the Center for Jewish Studies at Berkeley.
Earlier this year, he was awarded Israel's
highest honor, the Israel Prize in History.

The author of several books, Funkenstein
covered a variety of topics in Jewish history in
the course of his studies, including Jewish
intellectual history and the roots of the scien
tific revolution in medieval scholasticism.
In 1993, Funkenstein published "Percep
tions of Jewish History," and at the time of his
death, he had completed most of "Turning
Points in the Concept of Knowledge." He also
wrote extensively in Hebrew.
"He was a teacher of great warmth and
generosity with an abiding commitment to the
intellectual growth of former students in the
United States, Europe and Israel," Stanford
History Prof. Steven Zipperstein, the current
Koshland professor, said in an obituary.

Funkenstein advised more than 20 stu
dents in completing doctoral degrees but
touched many more in seminars and lectures,
Zipperstein said. His lectures were often
"described by students as among their most
remarkable intellectual experiences," Zipper
stein said, as Funkenstein managed "to unset
tle and surprise, to challenge established
knowledge with great erudition and audacity."
Funkenstein was also an activist in the
Israeli peace movement, connecting history to
current problems in several articles in Israeli
press and in lectures.
He is survived by his wife, Estie, of Berke
ley and by two children from a previous mar
riage, Jacob and Daniella.
