InternationaJ and Multicultural Students
In Support ot the Food Research Institute
We urge Stanford University to maintain the Food Research Institute as a separate,
degree-granting, department. We feel that the Food Research Institute contributes greatly
to Stanford's international character and orientation. Current proposals to close FRI and
end it's Ph.D. program will significantly weaken the University's ability to address
important international development issues. Stanford University should preserve FRI and
strengthen its commitment to multicultural and international programs.
