# We've got the Axe: Stanford 29, California 24
## Cardinal victory brings Axe home to Stanford Running game leads to first Big Game success since '92 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
While the howl picture may
look grim, Stanford fans can at
least rejoice about one thing — the
Axe is once again in the hands of
its rightful owners.
"We got the Axe back," said se
nior wide receiver Mark Harris.
"It's been a great season. Nothing
can put that down."
The Cardinal (7-3-1) downed
California (3-8) 29-24 in the 98th
Big (lame before 72,893 specta
tors Saturday, the smallest Big
Game crowd at Stanford Stadium
since 1973. With the victory, Stan
ford equaled the numbers of wins
it had achieved in the 1993 and
1994 campaigns combined.
With eight minutes, 40 seconds
remaining in the game, Cardinal
cornerback Kwame Ellis stripped
the football from Golden Hear
tight end Tony Gonzalez, giving
the Cardinal possession at Cal's
29-yard line.
"1 stood him up and waited for
my teammates to come over," Ellis
said. "Then 1 just took the ball
from him."
The turnover would drastically
change the pattern of the game.
Until that point, the Hears had
matched each Stanford score wit h
one of their own. Ellis' fumble re
covery gave the (Cardinal an oppor
tunity to break that chain.
Stanford took advantage of the
gift. Harris barely kept, his right
foot inbounds as he hauled in a
seven-yard touchdown pass from
senior quarterback Mark Hut tor
field, extending the Cardinal lead
to 12.

"It's just a great feeling, know
ing you did something for people
you care about," said Harris, who
high-stepped off the field after the
victory. He caught four passes for
72 yards on the day to finish the
season with 984 receiving yards,
the third-highest season total in
Stanford history.
Although Cal quickly closed the
gap to six points with a 78-yard
touchdown drive, Stanford would
not allow the Bears another scor
ing opportunity, converting four
first downs and running the final
4:41 off the clock. Butterfield
ended the game by kneeling down
at Cal's 4.
"It's always a helpless feeling,
standing on the sidelines," said
Bear receiver Nail Benjamin. "We
were rooting for the defense, hop
ing to get the ball back one more
time. It just didn't happen."
Cal head coach Keith Gilbert
son, whom many expect will re
ceive a pink slip in the near future,
placed the blame for his team's
loss at the feet of the officiating
crew. Gilbertson felt that Gonza
lez's knee hit the field before Ellis
took t he ball away.
"It's a shame we had to lose this
game on a call where the guy was
clearly down," he said. "This was
adifficult game because if the of
ficial makes a different call
against Gonzalez, we probably
win 24-23."
While Gilbertson correctly as
serted that the call changed the
face of the contest, his claim that
Cal would have prevailed if Gonza
lez were ruled down is questionable.
