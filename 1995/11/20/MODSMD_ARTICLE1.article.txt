# We've got the Axe: Stanford 29, California 24
## Cardinal victory brings Axe home to Stanford Running game leads to first Big Game success since '92 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
While the howl picture may
look grim, Stanford fans can at
least rejoice about one thing — the
Axe is once again in the hands of
its rightful owners.
"We got the Axe back," said se
nior wide receiver Mark Harris.
"It's been a great season. Nothing
can put that down."
The Cardinal (7-3-1) downed
California (3-8) 29-24 in the 98th
Big (lame before 72,893 specta
tors Saturday, the smallest Big
Game crowd at Stanford Stadium
since 1973. With the victory, Stan
ford equaled the numbers of wins
it had achieved in the 1993 and
1994 campaigns combined.
With eight minutes, 40 seconds
remaining in the game, Cardinal
cornerback Kwame Ellis stripped
the football from Golden Hear
tight end Tony Gonzalez, giving
the Cardinal possession at Cal's
29-yard line.
"1 stood him up and waited for
my teammates to come over," Ellis
said. "Then 1 just took the ball
from him."
The turnover would drastically
change the pattern of the game.
Until that point, the Hears had
matched each Stanford score wit h
one of their own. Ellis' fumble re
covery gave the (Cardinal an oppor
tunity to break that chain.
Stanford took advantage of the
gift. Harris barely kept, his right
foot inbounds as he hauled in a
seven-yard touchdown pass from
senior quarterback Mark Hut tor
field, extending the Cardinal lead
to 12.

"It's just a great feeling, know
ing you did something for people
you care about," said Harris, who
high-stepped off the field after the
victory. He caught four passes for
72 yards on the day to finish the
season with 984 receiving yards,
the third-highest season total in
Stanford history.
Although Cal quickly closed the
gap to six points with a 78-yard
touchdown drive, Stanford would
not allow the Bears another scor
ing opportunity, converting four
first downs and running the final
4:41 off the clock. Butterfield
ended the game by kneeling down
at Cal's 4.
"It's always a helpless feeling,
standing on the sidelines," said
Bear receiver Nail Benjamin. "We
were rooting for the defense, hop
ing to get the ball back one more
time. It just didn't happen."
Cal head coach Keith Gilbert
son, whom many expect will re
ceive a pink slip in the near future,
placed the blame for his team's
loss at the feet of the officiating
crew. Gilbertson felt that Gonza
lez's knee hit the field before Ellis
took t he ball away.
"It's a shame we had to lose this
game on a call where the guy was
clearly down," he said. "This was
adifficult game because if the of
ficial makes a different call
against Gonzalez, we probably
win 24-23."
While Gilbertson correctly as
serted that the call changed the
face of the contest, his claim that
Cal would have prevailed if Gonza
lez were ruled down is questionable.

Mitchell blasts by the Bear defense. Mitchell rushed for a total of 138 yards.
Stanford had much mure going for it on Sat
urday than just the Golden Bear turnover.
The Cardinal ground attack put together
one of its finest days of the year, grinding out
246 yards. Behind the excellent blocking of (he
offensive line, junior running back Mike
Mitchell broke the century mark for the first
time in 1995, racking up 138 yards and two
touchdowns while averaging 5.3 yards per
carry. Sophomore Anthony Bookman added
95 yards of his own to finish the year with a
team-high 872 yards.
Stanford abused an over-aggressive Bear
defense by running to the outside and avoid
ing the direct assault of the defensive line.
"They've got great defensive lineman,"
Bookman said "They came in fast and hard.
We just sort of ran away from them."
Time and time again, Cal's front four broke
into the Stanford backfield only to find Mitchell
or Bookman already far out of reach, sweeping
to the right or left behind a few blockers.
"We thought they would come at us with a
smash-mouth running style, and they kind of
took advantage of that." said Bear defensive
tackle Brent Jones. "They went outside more
than we thought they would from watching
the film."
On passing downs, however, Cal's vaunted
pass rush made Butterfield sweat, especially
in the first half. The Stanford quarterback
completed only nine of 17 passes during the
initial 30 minutes of the game, but met with
success on eight of nine attempts in the second
half to finish the day with 207 yards overall.
"In the first half, they were bringing it,"
Butterfield said. "That's definitely the most
heat we've felt all year."
The game began as a defensive struggle. Nei
ther offense moved into its opponent's red zone

until well into the second quarter. The Cardinal
put the game's first points on the board with a
•11-yard field goal by senior Eric Abrams.
"We were moving the ball all right," But
terfield said. "We just couldn't put it in the

end zone.
Cal quickly answered with one of its own, a
46-yarder by Ryan Longwell.
Then Stanford got serious. Butterfield
jump-started a drive with a 12-yard pass to
junior Brian Manning on third-and-10. A few
plays later, he hit Harris for a 30-yard gain on
third-and-six, setting up a three-yard touch
down run by junior fullback Greg Cornelia.
On Cai's ensuing possession, quarterback
Pat Barnes spread the ball liberally among his
receivers, gaining 69 yards through the air on
a drive that culminated in a 23-yard touch
down pass to Gonzalez.
Barnes, who threw for 334 yards, found
Gonzalez often throughout the game. The tight
end snagged 10 passes for 150 yards on the day.
"The middle linebacker [Cardinal Mike
Hall] had me the whole game," Gonzalez said.
"No offense, but he's just not that fast. We
had a lot of mismatches, and we really went
for it."

Despite his troubles with Cal's big tight
end, Hall registered eight tackles on the day to
bring his season total to 107. Fellow lineback
er Chris Draft added five to reach 103. The
two became the first Stanford defenders to
break the century mark since 1989.
Cardinal head coach Tyrone Willingham,
facing a 10-10 deadlock at halftime, wasn't too
pleased with the Cardinal's first-half perfor
mance and let his team know it.
"He was upset with the way we were play
ing," Butterfield said. "That got us fired up."
The speech was a reminder rather than a
tongue-lashing, however.
"There doesn't have to be a whole lot said
for our team," Willingham said. "We just need
to make some adjustments and get back on
track. That's what we've done the last two
weeks and come roaring back in the second
half. They know what's at stake. They have a
lot of character, poise and discipline. We just
needed to focus and lock in."
The two teams traded touchdowns again in
the third quarter. Starting at Cal's 48, Butter
field hit Harris for 32 yards, and two Mitchell
runs put the ball into the end zone. Barnes
found a number of his receivers on his team's
80-yard drive, finally hitting fullback Johnny
Tavake for the score.
Stanford's faced a second-and-23 play on its
next drive, but a 13-yard run by Cornelia
closed the distance to 10 yards. Butterfield
then threw a short completion to Mitchell,
who used a few spin moves to gain 17 yards
and get the first down.
Mitchell scampered for 22 yards on the next
play, setting up his own bullish five-yard touch
down run three snaps later. Abrams shanked
the extra point, making the score 23-17.
The Cardinal was forced to punt on its next
drive, but Cal's first play led to Ellis' decisive
fumble recovery.

end zone.
Cal quickly answered with one of its own, a
46-yarder by Ryan Longwell.
Then Stanford got serious. Butterfield
jump-started a drive with a 12-yard pass to
junior Brian Manning on third-and-10. A few
plays later, he hit Harris for a 30-yard gain on
third-and-six, setting up a three-yard touch
down run by junior fullback Greg Cornelia.
On Cai's ensuing possession, quarterback
Pat Barnes spread the ball liberally among his
receivers, gaining 69 yards through the air on
a drive that culminated in a 23-yard touch
down pass to Gonzalez.
Barnes, who threw for 334 yards, found
Gonzalez often throughout the game. The tight
end snagged 10 passes for 150 yards on the day.
"The middle linebacker [Cardinal Mike
Hall] had me the whole game," Gonzalez said.
"No offense, but he's just not that fast. We
had a lot of mismatches, and we really went
for it."

Despite his troubles with Cal's big tight
end, Hall registered eight tackles on the day to
bring his season total to 107. Fellow lineback
er Chris Draft added five to reach 103. The
two became the first Stanford defenders to
break the century mark since 1989.
Cardinal head coach Tyrone Willingham,
facing a 10-10 deadlock at halftime, wasn't too
pleased with the Cardinal's first-half perfor
mance and let his team know it.
"He was upset with the way we were play
ing," Butterfield said. "That got us fired up."
The speech was a reminder rather than a
tongue-lashing, however.
"There doesn't have to be a whole lot said
for our team," Willingham said. "We just need
to make some adjustments and get back on
track. That's what we've done the last two
weeks and come roaring back in the second
half. They know what's at stake. They have a
lot of character, poise and discipline. We just
needed to focus and lock in."
The two teams traded touchdowns again in
the third quarter. Starting at Cal's 48, Butter
field hit Harris for 32 yards, and two Mitchell
runs put the ball into the end zone. Barnes
found a number of his receivers on his team's
80-yard drive, finally hitting fullback Johnny
Tavake for the score.
Stanford's faced a second-and-23 play on its
next drive, but a 13-yard run by Cornelia
closed the distance to 10 yards. Butterfield
then threw a short completion to Mitchell,
who used a few spin moves to gain 17 yards
and get the first down.
Mitchell scampered for 22 yards on the next
play, setting up his own bullish five-yard touch
down run three snaps later. Abrams shanked
the extra point, making the score 23-17.
The Cardinal was forced to punt on its next
drive, but Cal's first play led to Ellis' decisive
fumble recovery.

While the howl picture may
look grim, Stanford fans can at
least rejoice about one thing — the
Axe is once again in the hands of
its rightful owners.
"We got the Axe back," said se
nior wide receiver Mark Harris.
"It's been a great season. Nothing
can put that down."
The Cardinal (7-3-1) downed
California (3-8) 29-24 in the 98th
Big (lame before 72,893 specta
tors Saturday, the smallest Big
Game crowd at Stanford Stadium
since 1973. With the victory, Stan
ford equaled the numbers of wins
it had achieved in the 1993 and
1994 campaigns combined.
With eight minutes, 40 seconds
remaining in the game, Cardinal
cornerback Kwame Ellis stripped
the football from Golden Hear
tight end Tony Gonzalez, giving
the Cardinal possession at Cal's
29-yard line.
"1 stood him up and waited for
my teammates to come over," Ellis
said. "Then 1 just took the ball
from him."
The turnover would drastically
change the pattern of the game.
Until that point, the Hears had
matched each Stanford score wit h
one of their own. Ellis' fumble re
covery gave the (Cardinal an oppor
tunity to break that chain.
Stanford took advantage of the
gift. Harris barely kept, his right
foot inbounds as he hauled in a
seven-yard touchdown pass from
senior quarterback Mark Hut tor
field, extending the Cardinal lead
to 12.

"It's just a great feeling, know
ing you did something for people
you care about," said Harris, who
high-stepped off the field after the
victory. He caught four passes for
72 yards on the day to finish the
season with 984 receiving yards,
the third-highest season total in
Stanford history.
Although Cal quickly closed the
gap to six points with a 78-yard
touchdown drive, Stanford would
not allow the Bears another scor
ing opportunity, converting four
first downs and running the final
4:41 off the clock. Butterfield
ended the game by kneeling down
at Cal's 4.
"It's always a helpless feeling,
standing on the sidelines," said
Bear receiver Nail Benjamin. "We
were rooting for the defense, hop
ing to get the ball back one more
time. It just didn't happen."
Cal head coach Keith Gilbert
son, whom many expect will re
ceive a pink slip in the near future,
placed the blame for his team's
loss at the feet of the officiating
crew. Gilbertson felt that Gonza
lez's knee hit the field before Ellis
took t he ball away.
"It's a shame we had to lose this
game on a call where the guy was
clearly down," he said. "This was
adifficult game because if the of
ficial makes a different call
against Gonzalez, we probably
win 24-23."
While Gilbertson correctly as
serted that the call changed the
face of the contest, his claim that
Cal would have prevailed if Gonza
lez were ruled down is questionable.

Stanford had much mure going for it on Sat
urday than just the Golden Bear turnover.
The Cardinal ground attack put together
one of its finest days of the year, grinding out
246 yards. Behind the excellent blocking of (he
offensive line, junior running back Mike
Mitchell broke the century mark for the first
time in 1995, racking up 138 yards and two
touchdowns while averaging 5.3 yards per
carry. Sophomore Anthony Bookman added
95 yards of his own to finish the year with a
team-high 872 yards.
Stanford abused an over-aggressive Bear
defense by running to the outside and avoid
ing the direct assault of the defensive line.
"They've got great defensive lineman,"
Bookman said "They came in fast and hard.
We just sort of ran away from them."
Time and time again, Cal's front four broke
into the Stanford backfield only to find Mitchell
or Bookman already far out of reach, sweeping
to the right or left behind a few blockers.
"We thought they would come at us with a
smash-mouth running style, and they kind of
took advantage of that." said Bear defensive
tackle Brent Jones. "They went outside more
than we thought they would from watching
the film."
On passing downs, however, Cal's vaunted
pass rush made Butterfield sweat, especially
in the first half. The Stanford quarterback
completed only nine of 17 passes during the
initial 30 minutes of the game, but met with
success on eight of nine attempts in the second
half to finish the day with 207 yards overall.
"In the first half, they were bringing it,"
Butterfield said. "That's definitely the most
heat we've felt all year."
The game began as a defensive struggle. Nei

until well into the second quarter. The Cardinal
put the game's first points on the board with a
