# Budget standoff ends
## Senate approves bill for funding through Dec. 15 
### 
WASHINGTON <AI») - The Clinton
administration and Republican congressional
leaders ended a six-day budget standoff last
night, sending federal employees back to work
after the White House committed to speedy
negotiations to balance the budget in seven
years.
"Tomorrow the government will go back to
work and now the debate will begin in
earnest," President Clinton said, appearing in
the White 1 louse press room shortly after the
deal was announced.
By voice votes, the Senate and House
adopted identical one-day measures to reopen
the government. The Senate also approved a
bill funding the government through Dec. 15
and the House planned to follow today.
Both sides declared victory — Republicans
lxvause the deal reflected their seven-year
timetable and Clinton because it spoke of pro
tecting programs he considers important.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., said, "I hope in the next
three or four weeks we will produce a bal
anced budget with the president on board."
In the four-week spending bill, the White
House and Republicans agreed the balanced
budget legislation would "protect future gen
erations, secure Medicare solvency, reform
welfare, provide adequate funding for Medi
caid, education, agriculture, national defense,
veterans and the environment."
The bill does not, as the White House had
sought, raise the government's $4.9 trillion

borrowing ceiling. However, private experts
agree the Treasury Department can avoid the
ceiling for months by tapping retirement
trust funds set aside for the civil service.
Yesterday's agreement followed a long day
of negotiating against a backdrop of restless
ness among federal employees and the public.
Forty percent of the federal work force —
nearly 800,000 employees — have been on
furlough.
In a compromise that was key to the agree
ment, the two sides said the Congressional
Budget Office will measure whether or not
any eventual budget deal eliminates deficits,
but only after consulting with the White
Mouse and other government and private
economists.
The argument over whose technical and
economic assumptions are used is important
because the White House budget office's fore
cast would permit nearly $500 billion more in
spending over seven years than the congres
sional office's prediction.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
and their chief deputies held a news confer
ence where they were barely able to contain
their euphoria.
"All I ran say is, 'Yes!' " House Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich, said,
thrusting two clenched fists in the air. Repub
licans credited Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., for
the CBO compromise that proved key to the
agreement.
