## Stanford victorious 
### 
IT'S OUR AXE! After a two
year absence, the Axe has final
ly returned to Stanford, thanks
not only to the excellent play of the
football team, but also to the lead
ership of head coach Tyrone Will
ingham.
The first-year coach has done a
remarkable job with his squad this
year. Saturday's 29-24 Big Game
victory over the Weenies gave
Stanford bragging rights for the
next 363 days. In addition, the
Cardinal triumph capped off a
tremendous regular season and
may have netted Stanford a post
season bowl game.
Stanford's 1995 campaign
stands in stark contrast to the two
previous years under former head
coach 11 Walsh. While Walsh may
have been popular with the media,
the professional ranks and football
fans in general, in his last two
years as coach, he guided the Car
dinal to dismal records of 4-7 and
3-7-1 â€” including two Big Game
losses to the Weenies.

On the other hand, with the
same cast of players minus current
NFL players Steve Stenstrom and
Justin Armour, Willingham man
aged to amass a 7-3-1 mark and
get our precious Axe back. Football
experts had predicted that Stan
ford would battle Oregon State for
second-to-last place in the Pacific
10 Conference. Instead, the Cardi
nal finished fourth.
Yet, some members of the media
still criticize W r illingham and his pro
gram. For instance, Cal alum and
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey
asserted in his Oct. 27 column that
"Willingham's total lack of charisma
has rubbed off on the team."
Interestingly, perhaps Dickey's
accusation only goes to show that a
Cal graduate can't figure out very
simple puzzles. Indeed, if having a
total lack of charisma leads to such
success, then charisma seems
highly overrated.
Hey Dickey, check the vault in
the Cal Athletics Department and
see if you notice anything missing.
