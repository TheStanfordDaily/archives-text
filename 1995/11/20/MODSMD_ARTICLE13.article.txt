LONG THE FOCUS of com
plaints and criticism from
graduate students, University
officials who oversee Escondido Vil
lage are starting to hear something
new — praise. It is gratifying to see
an instance where Stanford admin
istrators listened to student com
plaints and responded quickly and
decisively.
Although complaints had sim
mered for years, the magnitude of
the problems in Escondido became
apparent only last fall, when a group
of residents — dissatisfied with the
responsiveness of Escondido staff —
formed the Escondido Village Fami
ly Council and demanded meetings
with top-level University officials
like Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds. The
complaints included low cleaning
standards, extremely inconvenient
renovation schedules and unfair dis
crepancies in the cost of rent.

In response, Escondido formed
the Village Operations Review
Group, which brought administra
tors and residents together to dis
cuss and address complaints. The
University also strengthened clean
ing and maintenance standards,
including annual inspections of
apartments.
The results have been strong.
According to Assoc. Director of
Housing and Dining Services Rodger
Whitney, resident feedback has been
extremely positive, with Facilities
receiving much higher marks than
before last year's changes. The
schedule of renovations under the
Capital Improvement Program has
been accelerated and should be com
pleted in four years.
In all, kudos to the University for
responding so quickly and positively.
Stanford can learn from its success
here as it takes on other student
complaints.
