## Nudity and boredom at Gaieties 
### 
IMAGINE THIS: YOU are drowning
in a lecture so intensely boring that
you seriously consider whether blud
geoning yourself to death with your cal
culator would be a quicker way to end
your misery than strangling yourself
with your backpack straps when, to no
surprise, you feel a yawn coming on.
The next thing you know, you are
experiencing the most wonderful advan
tage to being alive — an orgasm.
Believe it or not, this is not just some
pathetic fantasy of a 19-year-old male in
complete, total comprehension of what is
meant by the term "sexual peak" (It can
happen). Apparently, researchers have dis
covered that a side effect of a certain new
anti-depressant drug is indeed the zenith
of the sexual experience once thought to
have only been available from an energetic
partner or good motor skills and a little pri
vacy. These researchers are also discover
ing that they have quite a few new friends.
The beauty of this drug is that once
you hit a certain level of boredom, you
will praise God and probably quite loudly
— if that is your thing. The quicker the
experience tries to put you to sleep, the
better. Which brings me to last week's
Gaieties. . . .
In short, it was a little disappointing. I
am not saying it was the most boring
experience of my life, or even my day for

that matter. I am just saying that I would
remember it in a better light if those
yawns had been aimed at my enjoyment,
thanks to the wonder drug I just men
tioned. There was actually quite a bit
about Gaieties that I enjoyed, but I am a
better complainer than I am an ass-kiss
er. Besides, I am beginning to believe that
getting the crap kicked out of you every
once in a while builds character.
My biggest problem was with the plot.
It centered around a group of students
who reminded me a lot of Shaggy and the
gang from "Scooby Doo." I started to
wonder who the guy in the library was
going to bo when they ripped his mask
off. This week's mystery, boys and girls,
was to figure out why Stanford is sooo
boring. It turns out there is a conspiracy
to take all of the fun out of Stanford.
Of course, I knew this was all just
made up, but when they mentioned that
part of the sinister plan was to make
White Plaza smell like crap, I started to
wonder. White Plaza does smell like
crap, and that isn't cool. I started to
believe that these guys had a point —
that Stanford isn't fun. But how is this
supposed to get me pumped for the Big
Game? I was expecting Cal to be humili
ated so Stanford would look tough, but
Cal seemed to appear superior instead.
If these are the "Axe Files." what ax are

we talking about?
There are a couple more things that I
just have to mention about the perfor
mance. First is the two naked guys who
appeared at the end. I have nothing
against nudity and I admire these guys
for their courage because whenever any
one sees a penis in public, even if it is the
size of a baseball bat, that person calls it
small. However, it is hypocritical to make
fun of Cal by bringing up the "naked
guy," a guy so desperate for attention he
walked around naked and t hen to use two
naked Stanford guys to get attention.
And what about poor Casper? I felt sorry
for him, having to stand next to two
naked guys dancing on stage. What is he
supposed to do, join in? He didn't seem to
know either. Besides, where were the
naked women?
The other thing that needs to be men
tioned is that the whole Stanford in
Canada thing wasn't funny. I'm sorry,
but there is nothing funny about Canada.
All there is to know about Canada is that
it is a country, it is cold and all Canadians
are good hockey players.

Mr. McCullough knows where to find
that wonder drug, so if you're nice .. .
