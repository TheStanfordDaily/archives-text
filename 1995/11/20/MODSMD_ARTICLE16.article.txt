Stanford alum decries decline of Honor Code

A PRECIOUS STANFORD tradi
tion is slowly dying, and this
tragedy is occurring while the
University administration watches with
incredible apathy.
The moribund tradition is the Stan
ford Honor Code.
Students for years have observed the
code and have signed it at each exam
with genuine intent to abide by it. If
cheating was observed, students refused
to submit to peer pressure and notified
their professors. The code was a living
document, a moral statement. Rut how
times have changed!
Along with 6,000 other alumni, I
attended the Alumni Weekend this past
October. A delightful student sympo
sium was presented. Titled "Life on the
Farm — students tell it like it is," the
event was chaired by Human Biology
Prof. Herant Katchadourian and includ
ed a cross sect ion of five alert students
who discussed a variety of topics, from

dating and career choices to athletics
and living arrangements.
The topic of the Honor Code was not
discussed initially, but was brought up
when the symposium was opened to
questions by several alumni, who were
concerned with its decline. The respons
es from students were startling. One
student openly admitted to routinely
signing the code without even reading
it. Another student candidly confirmed
that there was widespread reluctance to
report cheating by friends.
As alumni, we were stunned at these
responses. But perhaps we were even
more shocked and disheartened to have
Katchadourian paper over the trenchant
comments by saying that cheating was
not "a current problem."
Me further pontificated that a Uni
versity committee annually reviewed
the problem of cheating on campus rou
tinely and found "no serious decline in
compliance of the code by students."

Later, during a personal meeting
with Katchadourian, he admitted that
no objective data on the incidence of
cheating on campus was available. I
advised him that statistically accurate
and reputable polls have revealed wide
spread cheating sweeping colleges across
America. Subsequently, we have for
warded the following results of the
respected McCabe poll to Katchadouri
an. It claims:
• 57 percent of students at institutions
which have an honor code admit that
cheating is occurring.
• 49 percent said they would not report
an incidence of cheating by another stu
dent on an exam.
• 93 percent said they would not report
a friend who had violated the honor
code.
Stanford is not immune to this
decline in student morals. So I and fel
low alumni ask University President
Gerhard Casper, Provost Condoleezza

Rice and members of the Faculty Senate
to:
• Acknowledge the existence of the prob
lem of students violating the Honor
Code.
• Have an outside source conduct a
study of Stanford students to see if
cheating is as bad a problem as detailed
in the McCabe survey.
• Embark on an aggressive program to
restore integrity to the Stanford Honor
Code.
Stanford has had an honor code since
1921, when it was established at the
request of the students and approved by
the president and academic council.
Now, this hallowed 74-year-old tradition
is in danger of being lost and made
meaningless unless the administration,
the Faculty Senate and the students
wake up and defend vigorously the
I lonor Code's basic precepts.
