# Shen clarifies statements made at the Jackson rally
## 
### 
Since things I've said recently have
apparently been misconstrued, let me
make something very clear right now —
I have no intent ion of getting into a
"pissing" contest with anybody. I'm
writing to clear up some misunderstand
ings regarding my remarks prior to the
Rev. Jesse Jackson's speech last Tues
day.
A letter in The Daily entitled "Shen's
comments . .. belittled students" criti
cized my use of speaking time to inform
students about the Food Research Insti
tute crisis and the screening of the films
"Bosna" and "Sankofa." The author of

the letter felt that these "plugs" had
nothing to do with affirmative action.
I beg to differ. The information
which I chose to share with students
deals with the same issues which are at
the core of the affirmative action
debate — ignorance and racism. FRI is
an internationally respected organiza
tion. Its work in third-world and devel
oping countries has saved an ines
timable number of lives. "Bosna" and
"Sankofa" are films about cultural
genocide and slavery, respectively. I
received personal requests from individ
uals asking me to include the
announcements before my introduc
tion, and I did so with the prior consent
of the Rev. Jackson.
The student who had "some serious
problems" with my introduction also

found it "disturbing" that I had asked
Stanford students to take time away
from their golf and sailing classes to get
involved. This is disturbing to me as
well, because this is not what I said. I
pointed out a fact that most students
would agree to — Stanford is a comfort
able school. I explicitly said that there
was nothing wrong with this. The
request I made to students was to find
time in our schedules to be educated and
informed.
Apparently, I also stereotyped oppo
nents of affirmative action as "white
hairs." I would never make such a com
ment (I'm not blind to The Review). I
never even spoke of "white hairs" when
I "mentioned . . . affirmative action," as
the letter states. My remark about
"white hairs" came in the context of

youth activism and political involve
ment. I was airing my concerns that
decisions are constantly being made by
older people not necessarily in touch
with the concerns of young America. It's
time that we became involved in the
political decision-making process.
I want to thank the student author
who pointed out to me that many of my
comments may have been misinterpret
ed. I hope now that I have adequately
clarified any distortions which may have
clouded a day of inspiration for myself
and fellow students.
And as for my alleged "political agen
da," I can't even find time in my sched
ule to eat and sleep, much less keep a
political agenda.
