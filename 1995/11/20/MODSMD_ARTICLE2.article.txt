# Postseason uncertain
## With USC defeat, UCLA gets Aloha Bowl bid 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Tyrone Willingham, you and your Stan
ford football team just beat California, re
turned the Axe to the Farm and finished
your first season as head coach with a 7-3-1
record. Where are you going now?
Maybe nowhere.
Although the Cardinal had hoped to gain
an invitation to Hawaii with a Big Game
victory, the Aloha Bowl extended its bid to
UCLA after the Bruins upset No. 11 USC
24-20 Saturday.
The Aloha Bowl could choose a fourth
Pac-1() team but was not required to invite
the fourth-place finisher. UCLA finished
the season with worse overall and confer
ence records (7-4 overall, 4-4 Pacific 10('(in
ference) than Stanford — which finished
fourth in the Pac-10 with a 5-3 mark — but
did defeat the Cardinal 42-28 on Oct. 21.
Mike Savod, a representative of the
Aloha Bowl, attended Saturday's Stanford-
Cal matchup. Although the Cardinal was
making a case for itself on the field, Savod's
attention was split as the press box con
stantly updated the score of the UCLA

USC contest.
Immediately following the game, Savod
foreshadowed the Aloha Howl's intentions.
"UCLA winning puts them hack in very
good position to be invited." he said. "Stan
ford's loss to UCIJV puts them at a disad
vantage."
Late Saturday night, the Aloha Bowl ex
tended its bid to the Bruins.
In his post-game comments, Willingham
asserted that Stanford's bowl uncertain
ties would not put a damper on the enjoy
ment of defeating the Golden Bears. "How
can it?" he said. "You win the game of the
year, a game that makes the season in it
self. Does (the bowl situation] put a cloud
over it? No."
The Stanford team, however, which
proved countless doubters wrong through
out the year, will be disappointed if there is
no postseason in its future.
"It's nice to win this game," said sopho
more running back Anthony Bookman.
"I'm not going to lie to you and tell you (the
bowl situation] isn't on my mind, but it's
out of our control. We just need to rejoice in

this victory and see what plays out."
Bookman hopes the Cardinal will
not be overlooked by the Independence
Bowl or the Liberty Bowl, the two pos
sibilities remaining for Stanford. "If
we don't go to a bowl, it will be disap
pointing," he said. "We have seven
wins, we've had a great season, and we
should go somewhere. We have to hope
someone gives us justice and chooses
us."
B<x)kman does not doubt that poli
tics play a role in the selection process.
"Everything in America comes down
to money," he said. "I didn't think it
was political. But now that we're in the
thick of it, I'm finding out that it's very
political."
The Independence Bowl, which will
take place Dec. 29 in Shreveport, La.,
and the Liberty Bowl, to be played Dec.
30 in Memphis, Tenn., have both said
they are interested in a Pac-10 team.
Both game committees, however, have
said that Arizona state has contacted
them while Stanford has not.
"We haven't heard from Stanford,

and ASU is pursuing us strongly," saic
Independence Bowl Chairman Car
Mikovich. "We want the team ths
desires to be here, all things bein;
equal."
No doubt, members of the Cardinal

'We have seven wins,
we've had a great sea
son, and we should go
somewhere. We have
to hope someone
gives us justice and
chooses us.'
— Anthony Bookman

football team want to play a 12th
game. Anything else will be a letdown
"This was a great win, and it's great
to be 7-3-1," said Stanford quarter
back Mark Butterfield. "But we
deserve another game."
