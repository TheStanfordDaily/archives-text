# Ellis forces fumble to seal game
## 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
It's a sentiment so often echoed
by head coaches that it's almost
become a cliche — turnovers, they
will tell you, decide big games.
That sentiment rang true loud
and clear on Saturday afternoon in
the biggest game of them all, Big
Game itself, when Cardinal corner
back Kwame Ellis stripped Califor
nia's superhuman tight end Tony
Gonzalez of the football in a crucial
fourth-quarter turn of events.
With just eight minutes, 40 sec
onds remaining in the contest and
Stanford leading 23-17, Gonzalez
hauled in a pass from quarterback
John Barnes and chugged 14 yards
down the right sideline, carrying
several defenders on his back.
That's when Ellis reached in from
behind, wrested the ball out of Gon
zalez's arms with both hands and
fell on it.
"It was just a routine strip drill,"
Ellis said. "I took him head on, and
he wasn't expecting it. He didn't

protect the ball."
Though replays do not decisively
show whether or not Gonzalez's
knee hit the ground before the ball
came loose, Cal players and coaches
believed the fumble should have
been negated.
"I was down," Gonzalez said.
"And my forward progress was
stopped. When they were going for
the strip, I immediately tried to
drop down to a knee."
Instead, Stanford took over at
the Cal 29. Four plays later, Mark
Harris's circus catch in the corner
of the end zone gave the Cardinal a
29-17 advantage, sealing the Bears'
fate and securing Stanford's
retrieval of the sacred Axe.
"If the official doesn't guess on a
call," said Cal head coach Keith
Gilbertson, "we probably win 24-
23."
For Ellis, the strip and fumble
recovery merely highlighted a spec
tacular second-half performance.
The senior took away Cal's big-play
threat with his aggressive coverage,
breaking up two deep fourth-quar

ter passes to Cal wideout Hobby
Shaw and nearly intercepting one of
the throws. Ellis tallied three break
ups on the day.
"His second half of play was as
good as you'll see from a cornerback
this year," said Stanford head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "They tried
him deep — he responded. They
tried him short — he responded. He
came up with the big strip."
Indeed, Big Game was big for
Ellis. "This was one of my best
games at Stanford," he said. "I
needed to step up, and I stepped
up."
Hailing from Oakland, Ellis grew
up rooting for Cal but was able to
savor Saturday's Big Game victory
that much more. "Half the players
from my high school play over
there. I know almost their whole
team," he said. "A game like this
means so much to me. My high
school team is here. It's always a big
game for me."
It was also shaping up like a big
