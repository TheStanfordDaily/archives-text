# Ground attack makes roadkill of Bears
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
For all those who wondered how Mike
Mitchell was the top high school running
back in the nation, Big Game provided a long
awaited answer.
The junior has rushed for more yards
before, as has his sophomore sidekick Antho
ny Bookman. On Saturday, though, the Car
dinal twosome demonstrated time and again
that maybe two featured backs are better
than one. On a day that the California
defense contained wideouts Mark Harris and
Brian Manning, Mitchell and Bookman com
bined for 304 yards from scrimmage.
Even with two star runners, Stanford has
steered clear from a running back controver
sy and turned the surplus into a luxury.
"It keeps people off balance," Mitchell
said. "I think me and Book have different
qualities we bring to the table. Today, I think
both of us clicked. Whoever was in there was
pretty much having success."
Coach Tyrone Willingham had limited the
powerful Mitchell to no more than 18 carries
in a game due to nagging injuries, hoping to

keep him fresh for the long haul. But on Sat
urday, with no future games for at least a
month or maybe nine, Willingham turned
Mitchell loose for a career-high 26 carries.
Mitchell and Bookman began to steal the
show in the second half.
Mitchell ripped off nine- and seven-yard
runs to give Stanford the first score of the
second half, and after Cal evened the score, a
holding penalty put Stanford in a second
and-23 hole from its own 32. After junior
Greg Cornelia rushed for 13 yards on a sweep,
Stanford turned exclusively to Nos. 32 and 4.
Senior quarterback Mark Butterfield
threw behind the line of scrimmage on third
down to Mitchell, who ran back to the middle
of the field and, with two dazzling spin
moves, gained 17 yards. On the next play, the
Cardinal ran its bread-and-butter play of the
day, a sweep right. Mitchell followed a crush
ing block from junior right guard Brad Bad
ger for 22 yards down the sideline.
"It's usually one play that works each
game," Mitchell said. "Today it was that play.
You had Brad coming around that corner just
killing people. I was just waiting for him to do
what he does."

Then, Bookman moved the ball nine yards
on two carries, and after junior banger Adam
Salina converted a key fourth-and-one,
Mitchell inflicted some bruises of his own,
plowing through the Bears' interior defen
sive line for the score that put Stanford
ahead to stay.
"Mike Mitchell had one of the great days
I've seen," Willingham said. "He really
stepped it up, especially with the pressure."
Bookman kept the pressure on after Tony
Gonzalez fumbled on the first play of the
ensuing Cal drive, breaking free for a 21-yard
run that set up first-and-goal. The speedy
Bookman, a converted receiver, ended with
12 rushes for 95 yards, giving him a career
high average of almost eight yards per
attempt.
Mitchell's 138 yards nearly doubled his
previous season-high of 75 against UCLA
and marked his best total since the 1994
home season-opener against San Jose State.
On the other hand, Bookman's 95-yard effort
brought his total to 872 on the season, ninth
best in Cardinal history.
Now the Cardinal can only hope that
Bookman gets a chance to rush for 1,000.
