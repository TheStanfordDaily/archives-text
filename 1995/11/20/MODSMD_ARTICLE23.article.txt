# Disappointing Big Game crowd did not act with Big Game zest
## 
### 
Big Game turned out to be a
Big Bore. Sure, the Cardi
nal emerged victorious. But
nobody goes to Big Game only for
the football. It's those other
events that generally transpire
during the contest that really
draw a crowd.

But this year, things were tame.
No bottles were chucked on the
field after the game. No fruit was
heaved at the Stanford band. No
Golden Bear fans rushed the field

at halftime to dismantle the Tree.
Overall, it was a real drag.
If you had a keen eye for sub
tleties, however, you might have
caught some of the exciting action
around the stadium. If you either
didn't pay attention or were too
drunk to care, I'll attempt to
enlighten you.
• Just in case you thought the
Stanford Band seemed well
behaved at the game, allow me to
dispel the myth. While outside
alcohol is not allowed in Stanford
Stadium, the Band has developed
a clever way around the rule (as it
has in almost every other area of
law). Instead of bringing alcohol
into the stadium, it brings in an
ice chest full of ice so band mem
bers can keep cool in those blazing
hot black slacks. Sounds reason
able enough. But that's not
frozen water. It's frozen fun.
Sucking on ice cubes has never

been so enjoyable.
• I like to classify Stanford foot
ball fans into three categories,
and Saturday's game helped to
delineate the groups.
The first is parents and fami
lies. They either have a son play
ing on the team, a child attending
the University or are just out for a
relaxing Saturday afternoon with
the family. If it's at all possible,
you can bet that mom will see fit
to bring a three-month-old infant
to the game, subjecting the other
72,999 fans who decided to come
to a football game instead of a
maternity ward to an afternoon of
football and baby whining (com
monly known as "hikes and
tykes").
The second group is the college
socialites. These fans are loud.
They're obnoxious. And they reek


Reagan
Demas
of beer. It's the magical trio of
qualities that make up an auspi
cious Stanford student crowd.
The really odious ones generally
have blood-alcohol levels higher
than their IQs and are .-ill self-pro
claimed experts on the intricacies
of football. Many members of this
group get more excited waiting
for the three-foot inflatable foot
hall to be batted near their seats
than they do over t he athletic con
test.
The third and final classifica
tion can be dubbed the "annoyed
stiffs." They are usually alumni,
take all of the seats near the 50-
yard line up to the press box and
have an average age of "recently
deceased." Many in this crew will
wear old Stanford sweatshirts with
the raving Indian logo from their
college days. Such attire generally
draws the ire of current students.
Needless to say, there is little love
lost between the two groups just
in case you were wondering why
they always sit diametrically oppo
site one another in the stadium.

• And who were those fellas lead
ing the Cal fans in Golden Bear
cheers? With their casual slacks,
denim shirts and sporty ties, they
looked like they had just finished
filming a Docker's commercial.
But they were sorely needed. The
Cal crowd sat on its thumbs for
much of the game, only to be
injected with a shot of adrenaline
each time the Golden Bears
scored. Soon, however, the high
wore off and all 30,000 of them
planted their rears back on their
seats and wallowed in the misery
of their season. The crowd was up
and down with each score, like a
repetitive and deranged .Jack-in
t he-Box — except for the fact t hat
a Jack-in-the-Box doesn't suck.
• Did you notice those empty seats
scattered around Stanford Stadi
um? The Cardinal athletics rev
enue account sure did. This year's
Big Game drew 72,893 folks, the
lowest total at Stanford since
1973. Perhaps the Golden Bears'
less-than-stellar 3-7 record did
not add to the attraction of the
event. But there were no more
Stanford students at the game
than there were Cal pupils.
Certain political groups on
campus would call that, along

with every other example of peo
ple not doing something, "apa
thy." I disagree. After all, it is pos
sible to make a decision not to do
something and still care about
that decision.
• Three cheers for the stick-in-the
mud performance by the Stanford
fans after the victory. If they
weren't going to throw bottles and
shout obscenities at the opponent,
the least they could do was storm
the field. Instead, they chose to
stay in the stands and cheer in an
honorable and decent fashion.
The next thing you know, Big
Game will turn into a respectable,
esteemed matchup between two
outstanding schools both on and
off the gridiron.
But not on my watch.
• One final hip-hip-hooray for the
Stanford crowd. The periodic sta
dium announcements of UCLA's
pending upset of USC drew
cheers and shouts of joy from the
Cardinal throng.
It's just too bad that the Bruin
victory cost Stanford a sure berth
in the Aloha Bowl.
So congratulations to the Stan
ford fans, who miraculously
found a way to cheer simultane
ously for and against their squad.

• Did you notice those empty seats

um? The Cardinal athletics rev

Big Game drew 72,893 folks, the
lowest total at Stanford since
1973. Perhaps the Golden Bears'
less-than-stellar 3-7 record did
not add to the attraction of the

Stanford students at the game

Certain political groups on

something and still care about
that decision.
• Three cheers for the stick-in-the
mud performance by the Stanford
fans after the victory. If they
weren't going to throw bottles and
shout obscenities at the opponent,
the least they could do was storm
the field. Instead, they chose to
stay in the stands and cheer in an
honorable and decent fashion.
The next thing you know, Big
Game will turn into a respectable,

outstanding schools both on and

But not on my watch.
• One final hip-hip-hooray for the
Stanford crowd. The periodic sta

cheers and shouts of joy from the
Cardinal throng.
It's just too bad that the Bruin
victory cost Stanford a sure berth
in the Aloha Bowl.
So congratulations to the Stan

found a way to cheer simultane

Big Game turned out to be a
Big Bore. Sure, the Cardi
nal emerged victorious. But
nobody goes to Big Game only for
the football. It's those other
events that generally transpire
during the contest that really
draw a crowd.

But this year, things were tame.
No bottles were chucked on the
field after the game. No fruit was
heaved at the Stanford band. No
Golden Bear fans rushed the field

at halftime to dismantle the Tree.
Overall, it was a real drag.
If you had a keen eye for sub
tleties, however, you might have
caught some of the exciting action
around the stadium. If you either
didn't pay attention or were too
drunk to care, I'll attempt to
enlighten you.
• Just in case you thought the
Stanford Band seemed well
behaved at the game, allow me to
dispel the myth. While outside
alcohol is not allowed in Stanford
Stadium, the Band has developed
a clever way around the rule (as it
has in almost every other area of
law). Instead of bringing alcohol
into the stadium, it brings in an
ice chest full of ice so band mem
bers can keep cool in those blazing
hot black slacks. Sounds reason
able enough. But that's not
frozen water. It's frozen fun.
Sucking on ice cubes has never

been so enjoyable.
• I like to classify Stanford foot
ball fans into three categories,
and Saturday's game helped to
delineate the groups.
The first is parents and fami
lies. They either have a son play
ing on the team, a child attending
the University or are just out for a
relaxing Saturday afternoon with
the family. If it's at all possible,
you can bet that mom will see fit
to bring a three-month-old infant
to the game, subjecting the other
72,999 fans who decided to come
to a football game instead of a
maternity ward to an afternoon of
football and baby whining (com
monly known as "hikes and
tykes").
The second group is the college
socialites. These fans are loud.
They're obnoxious. And they reek

of beer. It's the magical trio of
qualities that make up an auspi
cious Stanford student crowd.
The really odious ones generally
have blood-alcohol levels higher
than their IQs and are .-ill self-pro
claimed experts on the intricacies
of football. Many members of this
group get more excited waiting
for the three-foot inflatable foot
hall to be batted near their seats
than they do over t he athletic con
test.
The third and final classifica
tion can be dubbed the "annoyed
stiffs." They are usually alumni,
take all of the seats near the 50-
yard line up to the press box and
have an average age of "recently
deceased." Many in this crew will
wear old Stanford sweatshirts with
the raving Indian logo from their
college days. Such attire generally
draws the ire of current students.
Needless to say, there is little love
lost between the two groups just
in case you were wondering why
they always sit diametrically oppo
site one another in the stadium.

• And who were those fellas lead
ing the Cal fans in Golden Bear
cheers? With their casual slacks,
denim shirts and sporty ties, they
looked like they had just finished
filming a Docker's commercial.
But they were sorely needed. The
Cal crowd sat on its thumbs for
much of the game, only to be
injected with a shot of adrenaline
each time the Golden Bears
scored. Soon, however, the high
wore off and all 30,000 of them
planted their rears back on their
seats and wallowed in the misery
of their season. The crowd was up
and down with each score, like a
repetitive and deranged .Jack-in
t he-Box — except for the fact t hat
a Jack-in-the-Box doesn't suck.
