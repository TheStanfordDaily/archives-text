# Disappointing Big Game crowd did not act with Big Game zest
## 
### 
Big Game turned out to be a
Big Bore. Sure, the Cardi
nal emerged victorious. But
nobody goes to Big Game only for
the football. It's those other
events that generally transpire
during the contest that really
draw a crowd.

But this year, things were tame.
No bottles were chucked on the
field after the game. No fruit was
heaved at the Stanford band. No
Golden Bear fans rushed the field

at halftime to dismantle the Tree.
Overall, it was a real drag.
If you had a keen eye for sub
tleties, however, you might have
caught some of the exciting action
around the stadium. If you either
didn't pay attention or were too
drunk to care, I'll attempt to
enlighten you.
• Just in case you thought the
Stanford Band seemed well
behaved at the game, allow me to
dispel the myth. While outside
alcohol is not allowed in Stanford
Stadium, the Band has developed
a clever way around the rule (as it
has in almost every other area of
law). Instead of bringing alcohol
into the stadium, it brings in an
ice chest full of ice so band mem
bers can keep cool in those blazing
hot black slacks. Sounds reason
able enough. But that's not
frozen water. It's frozen fun.
Sucking on ice cubes has never

been so enjoyable.
• I like to classify Stanford foot
ball fans into three categories,
and Saturday's game helped to
delineate the groups.
The first is parents and fami
lies. They either have a son play
ing on the team, a child attending
the University or are just out for a
relaxing Saturday afternoon with
the family. If it's at all possible,
you can bet that mom will see fit
to bring a three-month-old infant
to the game, subjecting the other
72,999 fans who decided to come
to a football game instead of a
maternity ward to an afternoon of
football and baby whining (com
monly known as "hikes and
tykes").
The second group is the college
socialites. These fans are loud.
They're obnoxious. And they reek
