# Students are ready to restore the Bay
## 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
Beginning this fall, the tiger
salamanders that dwell in Lake
Lagunita aren't the only critters
in peril some Stanford students
will be trying to save.
Green Corps, a national Held
school that trains recent college
graduates with a one-year pro
gram in environmental grassroots
organization, has recruited five
interns and 25 volunteers from
Stanford to work on its "Restore
the Bay" project. The project is an
effort to protect the San Francisco
Bay's natural resources to ensure
water quality and a safe habitat
for endangered species.
Founded in 1991, Green Corps
places its volunteers around the

country to work specifically with
individual universities.
As a kickofT event to publicize
their work, the organizers of the
project sponsored an All Species
Day Parade and Festival last Sat
urday in Sunnyvale's Baylands
Park. The festival, which focused
on informing people about such
endangered animals as the Cali
fornia clapper rail and the harvest
mouse, featured speeches by Sun
nyvale Mayor Barbara Waldman
and Bay Area environmental
activists.
According to Kimberly Larson,
one of this year's 15 Green Corps
volunteers and the coordinator for
the San Francisco area, about 130
people attended â€” including some
30 school children, who displayed
banners they had prepared for the

event. Students for Environmen
tal Education at Stanford cooper
ated with Green Corps by having
students at the Castario Elemen
tary School in East Palo Alto send
a banner to the parade.
Stanford sophomore Rebekah
Harrison, the media intern for the
project, said she was disappointed,
however, with the general turnout
at the parade, saying that the peo
ple "lacked a community spirit."
That sort of apathy is some
thing Harrison believes she has
also witnessed on the Stanford
campus.
"Stanford is a great place to go
to school," said Harrison, an aspir
ing environmental biology major.
"But especially as a science major,
I don't get a real feeling of involve
ment and dedication" regarding
environmental concerns, she
explained.
Sophomore Sheleika Herbey,
another intern, concurred, saying
that although she thinks "people
are pretty aware at Stanford,"
there is a group of students "who
couldn't care less.
"It would be nice to get more
people involved," she said.
According to Larson, however,
the people who do participate in
volunteer efforts at Stanford are
effective. A 1995 graduate of the
University of Vermont, Larson
said she has been impressed with
the Stanford volunteers, most of
whom are undergraduates.
"They're fantastic. The caliber
of the volunteers is wonderful,"
she said, adding that she appreci
ated the effort it takes for the stu-

dents to balance their schoolwork
with volunteering.
In addition to learning about
environmental issues, the volun
teers are receiving solid training
in organization.
Harrison, who said she got
involved with the Green Corps
project because of her interest in
environmental issues and a desire
to "give back to the community
around me," had equal praise for
Larson.
"She's a great organizer and a
cool person to work with," Harri
son said.
Herbey described her work for
Green Corps as "a very education
al and rewarding experience.
"I expected to get training, but
I didn't expect to learn so much in
so short a time," Herbey said. She
added that she has gained experi
ence in "getting people organized,
figuring out how to get things
done [and] how to get volunteers
motivated."
In the future, Larson and the
Stanford volunteers hope to carry
out campaigns dealing with habi
tat destruction, pesticide runoff
and military base pollution.
Other goals include forming a
coalition of local environmental
groups and performing "extensive
community outreach," Larson
said.
Herbey explained her involve
ment by saying, "I've always been
concerned with how our environ
ment is being treated and I decid
ed it was time to do something
about it instead of sitting back and
watching it be destroyed."
